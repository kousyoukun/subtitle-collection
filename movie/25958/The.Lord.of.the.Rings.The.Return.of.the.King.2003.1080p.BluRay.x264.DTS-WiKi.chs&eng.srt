1
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:41,123
魔戒3：王者无敌

2
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:18,933
史麦戈！
Smeagol!

3
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,374
我钓到了！
I've got one!

4
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:24,004
我钓到一条鱼了，史麦戈！
I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol!

5
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:27,276
快钓上来，快呀，加油
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.

6
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:37,324
德戈！
SMEAGOL: Deagol!

7
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:36,583
德戈？
SMEAGOL: Deagol?

8
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:41,353
德戈
Deagol.

9
00:02:57,175 --> 00:02:59,234
好兄弟，把那玩意给我
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

10
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:05,512
为什么？
Why?

11
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:08,848
因为…
Because...

12
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,786
今天是我生日，我要它
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

13
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,296
我的宝贝
My precious.

14
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,748
他们咒骂我们
GOLLUM: They cursed us.

15
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:53,321
杀人凶手
[WHISPERS] Murderer.

16
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:55,982
还说我们是“杀人凶手”
"Murderer" they called us.

17
00:04:56,127 --> 00:05:00,882
他们诅咒我们然后把我们赶走
They cursed us and drove us away.

18
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,728
咕鲁
Gollum.

19
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:05,630
咕鲁
Gollum.

20
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:07,725
咕鲁
Gollum.

21
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:14,301
我们哭得好惨，宝贝
And we wept, precious.

22
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,039
我们好孤单，哭得好惨
We wept to be so alone.

23
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:24,406
池塘的鱼儿好甘甜
- And cool So nice for feet

24
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:29,780
我唯一的愿望就是抓到
And we only wish To catch a fish

25
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,225
甘甜的鱼儿
So juicy sweet

26
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:43,099
我们忘记面包的滋味…
And we forgot the taste of bread...

27
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:46,903
树木的声音…
...the sound of trees...

28
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:50,975
和轻柔的微风
...the softness of the wind.

29
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:57,281
甚至忘记自己的名字
We even forgot our own name.

30
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:11,823
我的宝贝
My precious.

31
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:58,343
快醒醒！
Wake up!

32
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:01,044
醒醒！
Wake up!

33
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:03,015
爱睡虫，醒醒
Wake up, sleepies.

34
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:05,052
我们得走了
We must go, yes.

35
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:07,884
我们得马上出发
We must go at once.

36
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:14,522
佛罗多，你都没睡吗？
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

37
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:19,292
我睡过头了
I've gone and had too much.

38
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:22,434
天色一定很晚了
Must be getting late.

39
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:24,096
没有
FRODO: No.

40
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,163
并不晚
It isn't.

41
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:29,369
都还没过中午
It isn't midday yet.

42
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:32,141
天空越来越阴暗
The days are growing darker.

43
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:38,582
走吧！
Come on!

44
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,289
快走吧，没时间了！
Must go! No time!

45
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:45,827
佛罗多得先吃东西再走
Not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.

46
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:48,851
不能浪费时间啦，笨蛋
No time to lose, silly.

47
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:58,903
拿去
SAM: Here.

48
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:03,943
那你呢？
What about you?

49
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:07,504
我不饿，反正我不爱吃兰巴斯干粮
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Leastways, not for lembas bread.

50
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,484
山姆
Sam.

51
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,580
好吧
All right.

52
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:16,248
干粮剩不多了
We don't have that much left.

53
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:19,316
不省点吃很快就会吃完
We have to be careful or we're going to run out.

54
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:24,389
你先吃吧，佛罗多
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

55
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:26,001
我算过
I've rationed it.

56
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,165
这趟路应该够吃
There should be enough.

57
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:31,535
哪趟路？
For what?

58
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,939
回家的路呀
The journey home.

59
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:45,118
来吧，小哈比人
Come, Hobbitses.

60
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,378
就快到了
Very close now.

61
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,790
就快到魔多了
Very close to Mordor.

62
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:54,624
这儿不安全
No safe places here.

63
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:56,959
快走吧
Hurry.

64
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:45,006
王者再临

65
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,249
这就好像辛苦了一整天…
PIPPIN: I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon...

66
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,752
回到绿龙旅店享清福
...after a hard day's work.

67
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:55,380
你从来就没辛苦过一整天
MERRY: Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

68
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:09,630
各位大爷…
Welcome, my lords...

69
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:12,071
欢迎光临艾辛格！
...to Isengard!

70
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:16,174
好小子！咱们拼了老命找你们…
You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...

71
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:21,341
你们却在这儿大吃大喝还在抽烟斗！
...and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!

72
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:24,715
我们打了一场大胜仗…
We are sitting on a field of victory...

73
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:28,380
当然要好好享受战果
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

74
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,282
这块腌猪肉超好吃的
The salted pork is particularly good.

75
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:36,197
腌猪肉？
Salted pork?

76
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:40,822
-哈比人-我们奉了树须的命令…
- Huh. Hobbits. - We're under orders from Treebeard...

77
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:43,838
他接管了艾辛格
...who's taken over management of Isengard.

78
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:49,369
年轻的甘道夫
TREEBEARD: Young Master Gandalf.

79
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:54,142
我很高兴你来了
I'm glad you've come.

80
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:58,709
我能处理树和水、岩石和货物
Wood and water, stock and stone I can master.

81
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:02,552
但是这儿有一个巫师要对付…
But there is a wizard to manage here...

82
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:04,717
他被关在高塔上
...locked in his tower.

83
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:09,252
你要继续把萨鲁曼关在那儿，树须
And there Saruman must remain under your guard, Treebeard.

84
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,594
把他的头砍掉不就结了
Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.

85
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,794
不行
No.

86
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:16,904
他已经不能兴风作浪了
He has no power anymore.

87
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:20,999
萨鲁曼的污秽…
The filth of Saruman...

88
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:25,000
被冲得一干二净
...is washing away.

89
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:29,710
树木将回来住在这儿
Trees will come back to live here.

90
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,381
年轻的树木
Young trees.

91
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:34,786
-狂野的树木-皮聘！
- Wild trees. - Pippin!

92
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:46,395
我的老天！
Bless my bark!

93
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,458
皮瑞格林图克！
GANDALF: Peregrin Took!

94
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,233
拿给我，小子
I'll take that, my lad.

95
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,296
快点交给我
Quickly, now.

96
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:34,286
今晚让我们纪念
THEODEN: Tonight we remember those who gave their blood...

97
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,671
为祖国壮烈牺牲的勇士
...to defend this country.

98
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:39,346
为死去的同胞干杯
Hail the victorious dead.

99
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:42,151
干杯！
ALL: Hail!

100
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:30,533
我为你感到高兴
THEODEN: I am happy for you.

101
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,297
他是个男子汉
He is an honorable man.

102
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:36,167
你们都是男子汉
You are both honorable men.

103
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:43,339
率领洛汗人打胜仗的并不是我希优顿王
It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.

104
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,414
你不必听我发牢骚
Ah, don't listen to me.

105
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:55,722
你还年轻
You are young.

106
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,764
今晚属于你
And tonight is for you.

107
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:00,039
你可以在远方寻觅或是把酒喝到见底
Oh, you can search far and wide You can drink the whole town dry

108
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,790


109
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,765
但是却没有比在家乡更醇的啤酒
But you'll never find a beer so brown But you'll never find a beer so brown

110
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:11,335
但是却没有比在家乡更醇的啤酒
As the one we drink in our hometown As the one we drink in our hometown

111
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:15,406
你可以一杯接一杯狂饮上等麦酒
You can drink your fancy ales You can drink 'em by the flagon

112
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:18,749
但是只有绿龙旅店
But the only brew for the brave and true

113
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:21,652
才有勇士喝的美酒
Comes from The Green Dragon

114
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,454
谢谢大家，我赢了！
MERRY: Thank you! I win!

115
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,457
没有佛罗多的消息？
No news of Frodo?

116
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:35,127
一点消息也没有
No word. Nothing.

117
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:38,134
还有时间
We have time.

118
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:42,908
佛罗多越来越接近魔多了
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

119
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,739
我们能确定吗？
Do we know that?

120
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:52,612
你有什么直觉？
What does your heart tell you?

121
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:01,695
佛罗多还活着
That Frodo is alive.

122
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,965
没错
Yes.

123
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:10,404
他还活着
Yes, he's alive.

124
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:15,474
太冒险了，太冒险了
GOLLUM: Too risky. Too risky.

125
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:16,908
这些小偷
Thieves.

126
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,105
他们从我们手上偷走它
They stole it from us.

127
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:22,514
杀死他们，把他们两个都杀死
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

128
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,688
安静，不能吵醒他们
Shh! Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

129
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:30,383
不然就会前功尽弃
Mustn't ruin it now.

130
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,619
可是他们知道了
But they knows.

131
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,661
他们都知道了
They knows.

132
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:37,459
他们对我们起了疑心
They suspects us.

133
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:42,229
你是怎么了，好兄弟？
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

134
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:45,967
史麦戈是不是怕了？
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

135
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:49,032
没有，我不怕
No. Not.

136
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:53,444
我才不怕呢，史麦戈痛恨臭哈比人
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

137
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:58,441
史麦戈要给他们死
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

138
00:15:58,622 --> 00:16:01,147
我们会杀死他们
And we will.

139
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:05,386
史麦戈杀过人，可以再下毒手
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

140
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:11,360
它是我们的！
It's ours!

141
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:14,197
我们的！
Ours!

142
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,194
我们一定要得到宝贝一定要把它抢回来
We must get the precious. We must get it back.

143
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,799
耐心点，你要有点耐心
Patience! Patience, my love.

144
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:26,336
我们要先把他们带到她那儿
First we must lead them to her.

145
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:32,211
带他们走上弯曲阶梯
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

146
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,051
没错，然后呢？
Yes, the stairs. And then?

147
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:38,217
一直往上爬、往上爬…
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

148
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:44,823
直到我们来到那条隧道
...until we come to the tunnel.

149
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:48,330
他们一进去…
And when they go in...

150
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:51,303
就永远出不来
...there's no coming out.

151
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,064
她一直都胜子饿
She's always hungry.

152
00:16:55,846 --> 00:17:00,044
她要填饱胜子
She always needs to feed.

153
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:01,650
就一定要吃肉
She must eat.

154
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,911
她只吃得到臭半兽人
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

155
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,851
味道又臭又难吃，对吧，宝贝？
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?

156
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:09,083
对
No.

157
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:13,992
一点也不好吃
Not very nice at all, my love.

158
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:16,962
她一直想吃更甜美的肉
She hungers for sweeter meats.

159
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:18,965
哈比人的肉
Hobbit meat.

160
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:23,926
等她吃饱了把骨头和衣服都吐出来…
And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes...

161
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:27,201
我们就会找到它
...then we will find it.

162
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:31,700
然后我要把它拿走！
And take it for me!

163
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,883
是我们
For us.

164
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:38,385
对，我是说“我们”
Yes. We meant "for us."

165
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:42,013
咕鲁、咕鲁
Gollum. Gollum.

166
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:46,686
只要小哈比人一死…
The precious will be ours...

167
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:51,357
宝贝就属于我们！
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

168
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:53,301
你这个可恶的小坏蛋！
You treacherous little toad!

169
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,337
不！主人！
No! No! Master!

170
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,100
住手，山姆，别打他！
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

171
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:03,673
我亲耳听见他说要杀死我们
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.

172
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:07,977
没有，史麦戈连苍蝇都不敢杀
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

173
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:12,080
他是个又胖又丑的哈比人…
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

174
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:13,813
他讨厌史麦戈…
...who hates Smeagol...

175
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,823
所以才乱编谎话
...and who makes up nasty lies.

176
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:19,587
你这小坏蛋，我要把你揍扁！
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!

177
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,293
山姆！
Sam!

178
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,963
敢说我骗人？你才当面撒谎！
SAM: Call me a liar? You're a liar!

179
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:28,860
-你把他吓跑我们就会迷路！-我不管，我办不到
- You scare him off, we're lost! - I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

180
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,167
-我不能坐着让他杀死我们！-我不会把他赶走
- I won't wait around for him to kill us! - I'm not sending him away.

181
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,100
你看不出来吗？
SAM: You don't see it, do you?

182
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,676
他是个坏蛋
He's a villain.

183
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:40,308
我们光靠自己不行没有人带路就到不了
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide.

184
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:44,040
我需要你在我身边
I need you on my side.

185
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:47,153
我一直在你身边，佛罗多
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

186
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:51,616
我知道，山姆，我知道
I know, Sam. I know.

187
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:54,153
你要相信我
Trust me.

188
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:56,697
来吧，史麦戈
Come, Smeagol.

189
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:26,421
星光被阴影遮住
The stars are veiled.

190
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,922
东方有什么在蠢蠢欲动
Something stirs in the east.

191
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:34,729
一股永不歇息的邪恶力量
A sleepless malice.

192
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,504
敌人的邪眼在移动
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

193
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,644
你在干嘛？
MERRY: What are you doing?

194
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:01,787
皮聘！
MERRY [WHISPERS]: Pippin!

195
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:09,966
皮聘？
Pippin?

196
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,751
皮聘
Pippin.

197
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:28,550
-你发疯了吗？-我只想看一眼
- What, are you mad? - I just want to look at it.

198
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:29,953
我只想再看一眼
Just one more time.

199
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:32,185
放回去
MERRY: Put it back.

200
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:44,235
皮聘
Pippin.

201
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,270
不！
No!

202
00:20:57,354 --> 00:20:58,582
皮聘
Pippin.

203
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:03,153
他在这儿
He is here.

204
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,624
我看到你了
SAURON: I see you.

205
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:10,229
皮聘！
Pippin!

206
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:27,645
救命啊，甘道夫！
MERRY: Help! Gandalf, help!

207
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,251
快救救他！
Someone help him!

208
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:38,855
皮聘！
Pippin!

209
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:41,224
你这个蠢小子！
Fool of a Took!

210
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,549
看着我
Look at me.

211
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:10,619
甘道夫，原谅我
Gandalf, forgive me.

212
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:12,682
看着我
GANDALF: Look at me.

213
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:14,693
你看到什么？
What did you see?

214
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:20,260
一棵树
A tree.

215
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:23,102
有一棵白树…
There was a white tree...

216
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:24,763
在石砌的庭院中央
...in a courtyard of stone.

217
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:28,839
它枯死了
It was dead.

218
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,880
城市在燃烧
The city was burning.

219
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:38,407
米那斯提力斯？你只看到这些？
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

220
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:41,114
我还看到…
I saw...

221
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:45,893
我看到他
I saw him.

222
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:51,128
我听到他的声音
I could hear his voice in my head.

223
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,724
你跟他说了什么？
And what did you tell him?

224
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:56,394
快说！
Speak!

225
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:03,039
他问我是谁，我没回答
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

226
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:04,703
他伤害了我
He hurt me.

227
00:23:04,848 --> 00:23:07,339
你有没有提到佛罗多和魔戒？
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

228
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,311
我看得出皮聘没说谎
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

229
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:16,354
他是个蠢小子…
A fool...

230
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:18,824
不过是个诚实的蠢小子
...but an honest fool he remains.

231
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:22,817
他没跟索伦提到佛罗多和魔戒的事
He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

232
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:26,256
我们算是很幸运
We've been strangely fortunate.

233
00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:30,293
皮聘在真知晶球上看到敌人的计划
Pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

234
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:35,166
索伦打算攻击米那斯提力斯
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.

235
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:39,510
他在圣盔谷的惨败让他知道一件事
His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.

236
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:42,014
伊兰迪尔的继承人出现了
He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.

237
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:44,312
人类并没有他想的那么脆弱
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

238
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:48,275
人类仍有勇气，也许有足够力量挑战他
There is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him.

239
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:50,356
索伦害怕这一点
Sauron fears this.

240
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:54,850
他不能让中土世界的人民在同一个旗帜下奋勇作战
He will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

241
00:23:56,032 --> 00:23:58,421
他打算摧毁米那斯提力斯…
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

242
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:02,093
阻止人类的王者再临
...before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.

243
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:06,197
如果刚铎点燃烽火洛汗国必须准备参战
If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

244
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:09,338
告诉我…
Tell me...

245
00:24:09,512 --> 00:24:11,191
他们没来帮助我们
...why should we ride to the aid...

246
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,325
凭什么要我们出兵救援？
...of those who did not come to ours?

247
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:19,018
我们欠刚铎什么吗？
What do we owe Gondor?

248
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:22,181
-那我去好了-不行！
- I will go. - No!

249
00:24:22,358 --> 00:24:25,521
-一定要警告他们-他们会受到警告
- They must be warned. - They will be.

250
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:31,457
你要从另一条路去那儿
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.

251
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:36,495
溯河而上，寻找黑色大船
Follow the river and look to the black ships.

252
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,396
你们要明白：
Understand this:

253
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:43,239
大战有如箭在弦上一触即发
Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.

254
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:46,840
我要去米那斯提力斯…
I ride for Minas Tirith...

255
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:51,747
但我不会一个人去
...and I won't be going alone.

256
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,187
皮瑞格林图克你这个爱管闲事的哈比人
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

257
00:24:58,194 --> 00:24:59,855
快！快！
Hurry! Hurry!

258
00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:02,764
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going?

259
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:04,160
你为什么要乱看咧？
Why did you look?

260
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:07,098
你为什么每次都要乱看？
Why do you always have to look?

261
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,364
-不晓得，我忍不住-你每次都忍不住
- I don't know. I can't help it. - You never can.

262
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,240
对不起啦
I'm sorry, all right?

263
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,234
-我下次不敢了-你还不懂吗？
- I won't do it again. - Don't you understand?

264
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,937
魔王以为魔戒在你手上
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

265
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:23,882
他会来找你，皮聘他们一定要把你带走
He's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here.

266
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:27,950
你呢？你会跟我来吧？
And you...? You're coming with me?

267
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,592
梅里？
Merry?

268
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:33,058
走吧
Come on.

269
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:39,933
米那斯提力斯有多远？
How far is Minas Tirith?

270
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,731
骑马要骑三天，戒灵都用飞的
Three days' ride, as the Nazg?l flies.

271
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:46,398
你最好祈祷他们不会追上来
And you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.

272
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,600
拿去
Here.

273
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:50,541
给你在路上抽
Something for the road.

274
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:53,403
最后一包长底烟草
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

275
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:57,576
我知道你抽完了，你抽得太凶了
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.

276
00:25:57,754 --> 00:26:00,245
可是，我们很快会再见面
But... But we'll see each other soon.

277
00:26:03,593 --> 00:26:06,084
-对吧？-我不知道
- Won't we? - I don't know.

278
00:26:08,064 --> 00:26:10,123
我不知道以后的事
[TEARFULLY] I don't know what's going to happen.

279
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,995
-梅里-快跑，影疾
- Merry. - Run, Shadowfax.

280
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:13,658
用最快速度狂奔
Show us the meaning of haste.

281
00:26:13,803 --> 00:26:15,691
梅里！
Merry!

282
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:27,313
梅里！
Merry!

283
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:55,607
带她走最安全的路
ELROND: Take her by the safest road.

284
00:26:55,778 --> 00:26:58,269
有一艘船停靠在灰港岸
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

285
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:02,305
等着载她到海外仙境
It waits to carry her across the sea.

286
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:06,114
这是亚文安多米尔的最后之旅
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

287
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:14,581
你留下来什么也没有…
There is nothing for you here...

288
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:17,286
只有死亡
...only death.

289
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:25,864
亚文公主…
ELF ESCORT: Lady Arwen...

290
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:28,691
不能再耽误时间了
...we cannot delay.

291
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:32,402
公主！
My lady!

292
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:54,422
-告诉我你看到什么-亚文
ARWEN: Tell me what you have seen. ELROND: Arwen.

293
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,553
你有预知的能力
ARWEN: You have the gift of foresight.

294
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,530
你看见什么？
What did you see?

295
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:02,501
我看见你的未来有死亡
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

296
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,166
但是也有新生
But there is also life.

297
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:11,103
有一个小孩，那是我的儿子
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

298
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:14,308
这个未来可能无法成真
ELROND: That future is almost gone.

299
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:16,440
但是仍有希望
But it is not lost.

300
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:21,250
你不能确定
Nothing is certain.

301
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:25,688
我只确定一件事
Some things are certain.

302
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:32,320
如果我现在离开他…
If I leave him now...

303
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:35,096
一定会终生悔恨
...I will regret it forever.

304
00:29:36,205 --> 00:29:38,537
是时候了
It is time.

305
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,568
火花将从死灰中复燃
ARWEN: From the ashes a fire shall be woken

306
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,140
光明将从阴影中再现
A light from the shadow shall spring

307
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,619
断裂的圣剑将重新接上
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

308
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:05,224
失去王冠者将成为人皇
The crownless again shall be king

309
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:11,036
请你重铸圣剑
Re-forge the sword.

310
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,597
你的手好冰冷
ELROND: Your hands are cold.

311
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:55,114
你已失去精灵的永生
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

312
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:00,443
这是我的选择
This was my choice.

313
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,555
不管你答不答应…
Whether by your will or not...

314
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:10,184
我都不会搭船离开这儿
...there is no ship now that can bear me hence.

315
00:31:57,413 --> 00:32:00,246
我们刚刚越过刚铎边界
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

316
00:32:11,627 --> 00:32:14,152
米那斯提力斯
Minas Tirith.

317
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,060
众王之城
City of kings.

318
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:50,261
让开！
Make way!

319
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:21,293
就是那棵树
It's the tree.

320
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:23,125
甘道夫、甘道夫
Gandalf. Gandalf.

321
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:25,563
这就是刚铎的圣白树
GANDALF: Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

322
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:27,532
王者之树
The tree of the king.

323
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:30,228
但迪耐瑟并不是国王
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

324
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,235
他只是刚铎的宰相和摄政王
He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.

325
00:33:33,976 --> 00:33:37,503
给我听好了迪耐瑟大人是波罗莫的父亲
Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

326
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:41,835
你最好别让他知道他爱子的死讯
To give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise.

327
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:45,776
也别提起佛罗多和魔戒的事
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

328
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:49,385
更别提到亚拉冈
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

329
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:55,118
你最好一句话都不要说，皮瑞格林图克
In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

330
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:31,757
迪耐瑟大人，爱克西里昂之子刚铎的宰相和摄政王
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor.

331
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:42,006
我在黑暗的时刻，前来提供我的忠告
I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel.

332
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:46,334
也许你能给我一个交代
Perhaps you come to explain this.

333
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:56,516
也许你是来告诉我我儿子的死因
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.

334
00:35:10,973 --> 00:35:13,999
波罗莫是为了救我们而死…
Boromir died to save us...

335
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:15,803
我跟我的同胞
...my kinsman and me.

336
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:19,470
-他为了保护我们壮烈牺牲-皮聘
- He fell defending us from many foes. - Pippin.

337
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:28,445
为了回报他的救命之恩…
I offer you my service, such as it is...

338
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:31,857
我愿意效忠于你
...in payment of this debt.

339
00:35:33,395 --> 00:35:35,124
起来
Get up.

340
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:39,893
大人，请你以后再为波罗莫哀悼…
My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...

341
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:42,132
现在并不是时候
...but it is not now.

342
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:45,033
大战即将展开
War is coming.

343
00:35:45,374 --> 00:35:49,799
敌军已经逼近边界，你身为刚铎宰相…
The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged...

344
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:54,109
必须捍卫这座城市刚铎的大军在哪里？
...with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies?

345
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:59,175
你仍然有盟友，并不会孤军奋战
You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight.

346
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:03,849
向洛汗国的希优顿王求救，点燃烽火
Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.

347
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:08,954
你自以为很聪明，米斯兰达
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

348
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:12,191
但是你却低估了我
Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.

349
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:18,500
你以为我是瞎了眼睛吗？
Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?

350
00:36:18,674 --> 00:36:21,734
我知道的比你想像的多
I have seen more than you know.

351
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:25,108
你一方面想利用我对抗魔多
With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor.

352
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:28,170
另一方面想趁机推翻我
And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.

353
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,047
我知道谁在协助希优顿王
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

354
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:38,148
没错，我早就听过亚拉冈了他是亚拉松之子
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

355
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:43,185
我要告诉你我才不会向北方游侠屈服…
And I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North...

356
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:47,859
他只是失去王位的落魄王族
...last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.

357
00:36:48,037 --> 00:36:53,828
你没有权利拒绝人皇回归，宰相大人
Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward.

358
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:58,434
除了我没有别人能统治刚铎
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

359
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:05,416
来吧
GANDALF: Come.

360
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,072
我猜我只是挂名的卫兵吧
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.

361
00:37:22,238 --> 00:37:26,470
我是说我不必真的上战场吧
I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting.

362
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:31,306
-对不对？-你已经对宰相宣誓效忠
- Do they? - You're in the service of the steward now.

363
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,868
你必须奉命行事皮瑞格林图克，
You're going to have to do as you're told.

364
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,712
刚铎卫兵
GANDALF: Peregrin Took, Guard of the Citadel.

365
00:37:40,723 --> 00:37:43,214
好安静哦
It's so quiet.

366
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:47,658
这只是暴风雨前的宁静
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

367
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,686
我并不想上战场…
I don't want to be in a battle...

368
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:57,494
但是等待一场不可避免的大战更令人害怕
...but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.

369
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:04,672
甘道夫佛罗多和山姆有成功的希望吗？
Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?

370
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:09,109
他们的希望并不大
GANDALF: There never was much hope.

371
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:13,708
只有一线希望
Just a fool's hope.

372
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:21,525
敌人已蓄势待发
Our enemy is ready.

373
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:24,325
他集结了强大兵力
His full strength's gathered.

374
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,992
不只是半兽人，还有人类
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

375
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,230
来自南方的哈拉德林人部队…
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

376
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:34,103
以及来自海岸的佣兵
...mercenaries from the coast.

377
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:36,836
全都听从魔多的命令
All will answer Mordor's call.

378
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:38,570
来吧
MAN: Come on.

379
00:38:39,715 --> 00:38:43,014
刚铎将难逃灭亡的命运
This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.

380
00:38:43,185 --> 00:38:46,575
敌人会对这里展开猛烈攻势
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

381
00:38:47,523 --> 00:38:51,846
如果安都因河被占领奥斯吉力亚斯碉堡被攻陷…
If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

382
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:55,690
这座城市的最后防线就会瓦解
...the last defense of this city will be gone.

383
00:38:55,864 --> 00:38:59,925
还有你这个白袍巫师你一定会有办法的
But we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something.

384
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:07,400
对吧，甘道夫？
Gandalf?

385
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:14,776
索伦还没派出最厉害的手下…
GANDALF: Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...

386
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,038
他将率领魔多大军进行攻击
...the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.

387
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:24,420
据说没有活人杀得了他
The one they say no living man can kill.

388
00:39:25,427 --> 00:39:27,588
安格马的巫王
The Witch-king of Angmar.

389
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:31,030
你见过他
You've met him before.

390
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,294
他在风云顶刺了佛罗多一剑
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

391
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:43,539
他就是戒灵之王…
He is the lord of the Nazg?l...

392
00:39:44,012 --> 00:39:46,503
九骑士之首
...the greatest of the Nine.

393
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:48,377
他的巢穴是米那斯魔窟
Minas Morgul...is his lair.

394
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,054


395
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:57,249
死城
GOLLUM: The Dead City.

396
00:39:57,426 --> 00:40:02,659
很可怕的地方，到处都是敌人
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

397
00:40:09,872 --> 00:40:12,033
快点，快呀
Quick. Quick.

398
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:16,200
他们会看到我们
They will see. They will see.

399
00:40:25,454 --> 00:40:30,744
别过去，别过去，瞧，我们找到了
Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.

400
00:40:30,926 --> 00:40:34,783
通往魔多的路
The way into Mordor.

401
00:40:34,963 --> 00:40:39,286
秘密阶梯
The secret stair.

402
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:42,101
往上爬
Climb.

403
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:05,121
-不，佛罗多！-不是那里！
- No, Mr. Frodo! - Not that way!

404
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:12,559
-他在干嘛？-别去
GOLLUM: What's it doing? - No.

405
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:16,090
-戒灵在召唤我-糟了
- They're calling me. GOLLUM: No.

406
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:48,691
快躲起来！躲起来！
GOLLUM: Hide! Hide!

407
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:35,106
我感觉得到他的剑锋
I can feel his blade.

408
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:49,958
决战时刻终于来临
We come to it at last.

409
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:53,587
魔戒圣战即将展开
The great battle of our time.

410
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:36,039
来吧，小哈比人，我们一定要爬上去
Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.

411
00:43:45,887 --> 00:43:48,913
棋盘已经摆好
The board is set.

412
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:51,616
棋子开始移动
The pieces are moving.

413
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:55,382
皮聘，你要完成一项任务
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.

414
00:43:55,564 --> 00:44:00,160
让你这哈比人有机会再一次证明自己的能力
Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

415
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:06,565
你绝对不能失败
You must not fail me.

416
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:50,279
安静
Quiet.

417
00:44:50,752 --> 00:44:53,915
-快赶到河边，快点-快点
- To the river. Quick. Quick. - Go. Go.

418
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:55,420
来吧
Come on.

419
00:44:58,393 --> 00:45:00,122
划快一点
Faster.

420
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:15,641
拔剑
Draw swords.

421
00:46:10,198 --> 00:46:12,758
挡住他们！
FARAMIR: Hold! Hold!

422
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:34,946
那是什么？
What?

423
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:50,384
阿蒙丁
Amon D?n.

424
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:57,762
阿蒙丁的烽火点燃了
GUARD: The beacon. The beacon of Amon D?n is lit.

425
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:05,241
终于燃起一线希望
Hope is kindled.

426
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:41,996
米那斯提力斯的烽火！烽火点燃了！
ARAGORN: The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!

427
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:45,839
刚铎向我们求救
Gondor calls for aid.

428
00:49:55,357 --> 00:49:58,246
洛汗国将前往支援
And Rohan will answer.

429
00:49:58,693 --> 00:50:01,457
洛汗国全军集结
Muster the Rohirrim.

430
00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:18,500
召集登哈洛大军
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

431
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,071
尽量召集人马，我给你两天时间
As many men as can be found. You have two days.

432
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:28,507
第三天就整装出发，前往刚铎展开大战

433
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:30,822
-前进-很好
MAN 1: Forward. MAN 2: Very good, sir.

434
00:50:30,992 --> 00:50:32,323
-加姆林-王上

435
00:50:32,494 --> 00:50:34,086
全速跨越洛汗平原

436
00:50:34,262 --> 00:50:36,355
召集人马前往登哈洛

437
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:38,658
遵命

438
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:45,400
-你跟我们一起去吗？-我最远只能跟到营地
- Will you ride with us? - Just to the encampment.

439
00:50:45,573 --> 00:50:49,464
按照传统，王女必须向士兵送行
It's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men.

440
00:50:56,017 --> 00:50:57,939
人民找到他们的领袖
The men have found their captain.

441
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:01,452
他们愿意跟随你作战甚至愿意壮烈牺牲

442
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:04,217
你给了我们希望
You have given us hope.

443
00:51:18,606 --> 00:51:22,064
米那斯提力斯的攻城战…
THEODEN: So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...

444
00:51:22,243 --> 00:51:26,134
将决定人类是否将会灭亡
...the doom of our time will be decided.

445
00:51:28,716 --> 00:51:34,245
这是决战时刻洛汗骑士，你们曾誓死奋战
Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

446
00:51:34,422 --> 00:51:37,983
现在该行动了，为吾王及国土作战！
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land! Hyah!

447
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:23,025
法拉墨！
Faramir!

448
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:33,041
我们抵挡不了，城市已经沦陷
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

449
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:36,675
下令撤退，我们退回米那斯提力斯
Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.

450
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,724

451
00:52:50,098 --> 00:52:52,589
快找掩护！
SOLDIER 1: Take cover!

452
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:55,259
戒灵！
SOLDIER 2: Nazg?l!

453
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:59,099
撤退，退回米那斯提力斯！
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

454
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,545
快撤退！
Fall back!

455
00:53:14,622 --> 00:53:19,184
-撤退！撤退！-快点！
- Retreat! Retreat! SOLDIER 3: Come on!

456
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:47,774
人类的时代结束了
The age of Men is over.

457
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:53,553
半兽人的时代来临了
The time of the Orc has come.

458
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,262
快找掩护！
SOLDIER 1: Take cover! SOLDIER 2: Faster, faster!

459
00:53:59,901 --> 00:54:02,267
大人，快找掩护！
Take cover, my lord!

460
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,901
他们来了！
It's coming!

461
00:54:09,477 --> 00:54:12,833
-是米斯兰达-白袍骑士！
MAN: It's Mithrandir. - The White Rider!

462
00:54:52,738 --> 00:54:54,137
打开城门！
GUARD: Pull!

463
00:55:11,857 --> 00:55:14,246
米斯兰达
FARAMIR: Mithrandir.

464
00:55:14,426 --> 00:55:16,189
他们攻破我们的防线
They broke through our defenses.

465
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:18,557
占领了桥梁和西岸
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

466
00:55:19,665 --> 00:55:21,768
-半兽人大军正越河而来-
Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.

467
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,861
迪耐瑟大人早就料到了
IORLAS: It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

468
00:55:23,969 --> 00:55:28,531
-他早就预知这种结局-他却什么也不做
- Long has he foreseen this doom. - Foreseen and done nothing.

469
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:34,299
法拉墨？
Faramir?

470
00:55:36,248 --> 00:55:40,070
这不是你第一次见到半身人
This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path.

471
00:55:40,252 --> 00:55:42,447
没错
No.

472
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:45,313
你见到佛罗多和山姆？
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

473
00:55:46,225 --> 00:55:49,615
-在哪里？几时？-在伊西力安
- Where? When? - In lthilien.

474
00:55:49,795 --> 00:55:51,888
不到两天前
Not two days ago.

475
00:55:52,331 --> 00:55:56,791
他们往魔窟谷的方向前进
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.

476
00:55:57,536 --> 00:56:00,130
然后会通过西力斯昂哥隘口
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

477
00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:04,735
这是什么意思？
What does that mean?

478
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:09,802
-怎么了？-法拉墨，把一切经过告诉我
- What's wrong? - Faramir, tell me everything.

479
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:40,073
小心点，主人，小心点
GOLLUM: Careful, master. Careful.

480
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:43,544
这座山谷很深
Very far to fall.

481
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:49,709
这些阶梯很危险
Very dangerous are the stairs.

482
00:56:52,424 --> 00:56:54,949
来吧，主人
Come, master.

483
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:03,894
到史麦戈这儿
Come to Smeagol.

484
00:57:10,242 --> 00:57:11,766
佛罗多
SAM: Mr. Frodo.

485
00:57:12,745 --> 00:57:14,303
你给我退后！
Get back, you!

486
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,675
别碰他！
Don't touch him!

487
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,652
他为什么痛恨可怜的史麦戈？
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

488
00:57:23,822 --> 00:57:27,519
史麦戈对他做了什么？
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

489
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:30,059
主人？
Master?

490
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:34,321
主人身上的担子好沉重
Master carries heavy burden.

491
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,893
史麦戈知道，好沉重的担子
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

492
00:57:40,072 --> 00:57:43,337
小胖子不会懂
Fat one cannot know.

493
00:57:45,377 --> 00:57:48,141
史麦戈会照顾主人
Smeagol look after master.

494
00:57:49,348 --> 00:57:51,543
他想要它
He wants it.

495
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:56,245
他需要它，我从他的眼神看得出来
He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

496
00:57:56,422 --> 00:58:01,883
他很快就会向你要，你等着瞧
Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.

497
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:05,917
小胖子会把它从你手中抢过来
The fat one will take it from you.

498
00:58:13,138 --> 00:58:17,495
派出所有军队
WITCH-KING: Send forth all legions.

499
00:58:17,676 --> 00:58:21,703
全力进攻直到把城市攻陷
Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.

500
00:58:22,414 --> 00:58:25,542
把他们赶尽杀绝
Slay them all.

501
00:58:27,219 --> 00:58:32,976
-巫师呢？-我会对付他
- What of the wizard? - I will break him.

502
00:58:36,361 --> 00:58:38,750
希优顿王的骠骑呢？
GUARD: What of Theoden's riders?

503
00:58:38,931 --> 00:58:41,525
洛汗大军会来吗？
Will Rohan's army come?

504
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,930
米斯兰达
Mithrandir.

505
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:48,861
你们最犀利的武器就是勇气
Courage is the best defense that you have now.

506
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:53,363
我在此宣誓效忠刚铎…
PIPPIN: Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...

507
00:58:53,545 --> 00:58:55,035
不管和平或战争…
...in peace or war...

508
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:58,172
置生死于度外…
...in living or dying...

509
00:58:59,518 --> 00:59:00,746
从…
...from...

510
00:59:03,422 --> 00:59:06,220
从现在开始…
From this hour henceforth...

511
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:08,313
直到大人解除我的誓言…
...until my lord release me...

512
00:59:09,828 --> 00:59:12,023
或是直到我死为止
...or death take me.

513
00:59:12,598 --> 00:59:15,089
我不会忘记你的誓言…
And I shall not forget it...

514
00:59:15,267 --> 00:59:18,657
也一定会回应你的效忠
...nor fail to reward that which is given.

515
00:59:26,245 --> 00:59:28,543
以爱回应忠诚
Fealty with love.

516
00:59:29,615 --> 00:59:31,276
以荣誉回应英勇
Valor with honor.

517
00:59:32,885 --> 00:59:36,218
以复仇回应背叛
Disloyalty with vengeance.

518
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:48,924
你不该轻易放弃边界防线…
I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses...

519
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:51,865
那是你兄长一直坚守的防线
...defenses that your brother long held intact.

520
00:59:52,037 --> 00:59:54,528
-你要我怎么做？-我要你夺回…
- What would you have me do? - I will not yield...

521
00:59:54,706 --> 00:59:57,470
帕兰诺平原和碉堡
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

522
00:59:57,643 --> 00:59:59,304
你一定要夺回奥斯吉力亚斯
Osgiliath must be retaken.

523
00:59:59,478 --> 01:00:01,537
奥斯吉力亚斯已经被攻陷
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

524
01:00:02,214 --> 01:00:04,978
打仗一定有风险
Much must be risked in war.

525
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:11,578
有哪位将军，有勇气替摄政王效命？
Is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will?

526
01:00:17,796 --> 01:00:21,061
你希望我跟哥哥交换命运…
You wish now that our places had been exchanged...

527
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,833
你宁愿让我死，让波罗莫活
...that I had died and Boromir had lived.

528
01:00:28,273 --> 01:00:30,002
是的
Yes.

529
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:32,904
我是这么希望
I wish that.

530
01:00:41,286 --> 01:00:43,777
既然你失去了波罗莫…
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

531
01:00:45,624 --> 01:00:48,513
我就代替他执行这项任务
...I will do what I can in his stead.

532
01:00:56,702 --> 01:01:01,162
如果我能生还，请你肯定我的能力
If I should return, think better of me, Father.

533
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:06,870
这要看你是不是能凯旋归来
That will depend on the manner of your return.

534
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,181
Ugh.

535
01:02:30,195 --> 01:02:32,527
你想干什么？
SAM: What are you up to?

536
01:02:32,698 --> 01:02:33,926
你想偷溜，对吧？
Sneaking off, are we?

537
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:36,463
偷溜？
Sneaking?

538
01:02:37,502 --> 01:02:39,663
偷溜？
Sneaking?!

539
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:44,236
小胖子真有良心
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

540
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:49,506
史麦戈带他们找到没有人找得到的秘密通道…
Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find...

541
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:51,808
他却说我想“偷溜”
...and they say "sneak."

542
01:02:52,451 --> 01:02:55,045
偷溜？
Sneak?

543
01:02:55,654 --> 01:02:58,384
你真是个好朋友，是啊你真是个好兄弟
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

544
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:01,151
-好兄弟-够了，够了！
- Very nice, very nice. - All right. All right!

545
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:04,622
我只是被你吓了一跳
You just startled me is all.

546
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,961
你刚才在干嘛？
What were you doing?

547
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,727
偷溜呀
Sneaking.

548
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,163
好吧，随便你
Fine. Have it your own way.

549
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:18,932
很抱歉把你吵醒
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

550
01:03:19,311 --> 01:03:21,267
我们得出发了
We have to be moving on.

551
01:03:26,451 --> 01:03:28,009
天色还是很暗
It's dark still.

552
01:03:28,186 --> 01:03:30,416
天色一直都很暗
It's always dark here.

553
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:36,581
不见了！
It's gone!

554
01:03:37,796 --> 01:03:40,651
-精灵干粮不见了-什么？
- The Elven bread. - What?

555
01:03:40,832 --> 01:03:42,322
我们只剩下那点粮食
That's all we have left.

556
01:03:46,371 --> 01:03:48,862
他拿走了，一定是他偷的！
He took it. He must have!

557
01:03:49,374 --> 01:03:52,639
你说我？可怜的史麦戈才没拿
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

558
01:03:52,811 --> 01:03:55,700
史麦戈最讨厌吃精灵干粮
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

559
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:59,078
你骗人，你拿到哪儿了？
You're a lying wretch! What did you do with it?!

560
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:00,775
他不吃那玩意
He doesn't eat it.

561
01:04:01,787 --> 01:04:04,119
-不可能是他拿的-瞧
- He can't have taken it. GOLLUM: Look.

562
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:06,988
那是什么？
What's this?

563
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:12,994
他的外套上有干粮屑，是他拿的！
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

564
01:04:13,698 --> 01:04:15,359
是他偷走的
He took it.

565
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:18,846
我亲眼看到，他老是趁主人不注意偷吃
I seen him. He's always stuffing his face...when master's not looking.

566
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:22,369
你说谎！
- That's a filthy lie!

567
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:24,771
你这个狡猾的小坏蛋！
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

568
01:04:24,943 --> 01:04:26,171
-山姆！-你敢说是我…
- Sam! SAM: Call me...

569
01:04:26,344 --> 01:04:27,572
住手！
FRODO: Stop it!

570
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,808
山姆！
Sam!

571
01:04:31,082 --> 01:04:34,711
-我要宰了他！-山姆，不！
- I'll kill him! - Sam! No!

572
01:04:35,754 --> 01:04:41,317
对不起，我不是故意的我只是…气炸了
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

573
01:04:41,493 --> 01:04:43,620
来，休息一下吧
Here, just... Let's just rest a bit.

574
01:04:43,795 --> 01:04:45,854
-我很好-不
- I'm all right. - No.

575
01:04:46,031 --> 01:04:49,125
你不好，你累坏了
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

576
01:04:49,301 --> 01:04:51,394
都是咕鲁害的
It's that Gollum.

577
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,299
这地方有鬼
It's this place.

578
01:04:53,471 --> 01:04:56,031
你戴的魔戒太沉重了
It's that thing around your neck.

579
01:04:59,544 --> 01:05:00,841
我可以帮忙
I could help a bit.

580
01:05:01,012 --> 01:05:03,674
我可以替你戴一下
I could carry it for a while.

581
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:05,578
我可以替你戴一阵子
Carry it for a while.

582
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,012
我可以替你戴一下
[VOICE ECHOING] I could carry it.

583
01:05:07,652 --> 01:05:13,079
减轻你的负担
Share the load... Share the load... the load... the load.

584
01:05:13,258 --> 01:05:14,486
走开！
Get away!

585
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:16,217
我并不想要它
I don't want to keep it.

586
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:21,789
我只想帮忙
I just want to help.

587
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:26,463
瞧？瞧？
See? See?

588
01:05:26,638 --> 01:05:30,062
他想把它占为己有
He wants it for himself.

589
01:05:30,242 --> 01:05:31,937
给我闭嘴！
Shut up, you!

590
01:05:32,477 --> 01:05:34,342
快滚！给我走吧！
Go away! Get out of here!

591
01:05:34,512 --> 01:05:36,343
不，山姆
No, Sam.

592
01:05:36,514 --> 01:05:37,742
你才该走
It's you.

593
01:05:41,953 --> 01:05:43,648
很抱歉，山姆
I'm sorry, Sam.

594
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:46,721
他是个骗子
But he's a liar.

595
01:05:46,892 --> 01:05:49,554
他在挑拨我们的感情
He's poisoned you against me.

596
01:05:50,962 --> 01:05:52,884
你再也帮不了我
You can't help me anymore.

597
01:05:54,866 --> 01:05:56,731
这不是你的真心话
You don't mean that.

598
01:05:59,237 --> 01:06:01,034
回家吧
Go home.

599
01:07:21,052 --> 01:07:22,849
法拉墨！
GANDALF: Faramir!

600
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:24,909
法拉墨！
Faramir!

601
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:28,483
你父亲完全失去理智
Your father's will has turned to madness.

602
01:07:29,661 --> 01:07:31,686
不要白白去送死
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

603
01:07:32,464 --> 01:07:34,762
我必须誓死效忠刚铎
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

604
01:07:39,504 --> 01:07:42,894
你父亲很爱你，法拉墨
Your father loves you, Faramir.

605
01:07:43,608 --> 01:07:46,634
他最后会明白的
He will remember it before the end.

606
01:08:56,247 --> 01:08:57,771
你会唱歌吗，小哈比人？
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

607
01:09:00,652 --> 01:09:02,142
这个嘛…
Well...

608
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,312
会啊
...yes.

609
01:09:05,023 --> 01:09:08,789
我的同胞觉得我唱得不错
At least, well enough for my own people.

610
01:09:10,428 --> 01:09:12,817
不过我们唱的歌谣都很粗俗…
But we have no songs for great halls...

611
01:09:13,865 --> 01:09:15,127
不能登大雅之堂
...and evil times.

612
01:09:15,967 --> 01:09:19,130
怎么会不能登大雅之堂？
And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?

613
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,339
来吧，唱一首来听听
Come, sing me a song.

614
01:09:34,385 --> 01:09:37,741
家园在后方
[SINGING] Home is behind

615
01:09:37,922 --> 01:09:41,653
世界在前方
The world ahead

616
01:09:44,062 --> 01:09:49,887
路途多遥远、千辛又万苦
And there are many paths to tread

617
01:09:51,703 --> 01:09:55,264
穿过幽暗阴影
Through shadow

618
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,570
迎向黑夜边缘
To the edge of night

619
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:06,342
直到夜空繁星闪烁
Until the stars are all alight

620
01:10:09,354 --> 01:10:13,677
迷雾和阴影
Mist and shadow

621
01:10:13,858 --> 01:10:18,147
乌云和黑暗
Cloud and shade

622
01:10:20,532 --> 01:10:23,865
全都消失
All shall fade

623
01:10:26,237 --> 01:10:30,230
全都消失
All shall

624
01:10:36,014 --> 01:10:38,380
消散一空
Fade

625
01:11:02,774 --> 01:11:06,232
前进！前进！
LEAD ORC: March! March!

626
01:11:06,411 --> 01:11:11,610
前进！前进！
March! March! March!

627
01:11:15,086 --> 01:11:17,418
国王来了
MAN 1: Make way for the king.

628
01:11:18,923 --> 01:11:20,914
让开
Make way.

629
01:11:23,394 --> 01:11:25,419
国王来了
MAN 2: The king is here.

630
01:11:27,398 --> 01:11:29,025
王上
MAN 3: My lord.

631
01:11:30,268 --> 01:11:32,224
吾王万岁
MAN 4: Hail to you, sire.

632
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:33,898
葛林伯，有多少人马？
Grimbold, how many?

633
01:11:34,072 --> 01:11:36,495
我从西谷带来五百人
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

634
01:11:37,475 --> 01:11:40,137
沼境来了三百人，希优顿王
FENMARCH MAN: We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.

635
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:45,238
-雪界河来了多少骑士？-一个也没有，王上
- Where are the riders from Snowbourn? GAMLING: None have come, my lord.

636
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,427
六千名长矛手
THEODEN: Six thousand spears.

637
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,461
比我预期的少一半
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

638
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:11,128
六千人不能突破魔多大军防线
Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.

639
01:12:13,878 --> 01:12:15,641
会有更多人马来到
More will come.

640
01:12:16,014 --> 01:12:18,972
时间拖久了刚铎就会沦陷
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

641
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:21,710
只能等到天亮，然后就要出发
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

642
01:12:41,205 --> 01:12:43,537
战马焦躁不安…
The horses are restless...

643
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:45,198
战士却寂静无声
...and the men are quiet.

644
01:12:45,677 --> 01:12:48,805
他们紧张得说不出话来
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.

645
01:12:51,282 --> 01:12:53,147
那条路…
GIMLl: That road there...

646
01:12:54,052 --> 01:12:56,145
通往哪里？
...where does that lead?

647
01:12:56,888 --> 01:13:00,710
那里是丁祸，黑暗之门
It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain.

648
01:13:01,459 --> 01:13:04,451
没有人进去能活着出来
None who venture there ever return.

649
01:13:05,663 --> 01:13:07,528
那是亡灵之山
That mountain is evil.

650
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,436
MAN: Hold!

651
01:13:30,488 --> 01:13:32,319
亚拉冈
GIMLl: Aragorn.

652
01:13:33,057 --> 01:13:34,945
咱们去找吃的
Let's find some food.

653
01:13:51,442 --> 01:13:52,875
好了
There.

654
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:56,803
你也是洛汗骠骑了
A true esquire of Rohan.

655
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:02,442
我也要打仗
I'm ready.

656
01:14:04,055 --> 01:14:05,317
对不起
Sorry.

657
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,754
这把剑并不锐利
It isn't all that dangerous.

658
01:14:08,259 --> 01:14:10,591
它其实挺钝的
It's not even sharp.

659
01:14:11,262 --> 01:14:14,652
那可不行，用钝剑可杀不了半兽人
Well, that's no good. You won't kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

660
01:14:14,832 --> 01:14:16,322
来吧
Come on.

661
01:14:20,538 --> 01:14:23,029
去找铁匠磨剑，去吧！
To the smithy. Go!

662
01:14:24,475 --> 01:14:27,000
你不该怂恿他
You should not encourage him.

663
01:14:27,178 --> 01:14:29,669
你不该对他没信心
You should not doubt him.

664
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:33,113
他很有勇气，只是个子太小
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.

665
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,412
梅里为什么不能上战场？
Why should Merry be left behind?

666
01:14:37,588 --> 01:14:40,216
他跟你一样有参战的理由
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

667
01:14:42,393 --> 01:14:45,521
他为什么就不能为他所爱的人奋战？
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

668
01:15:14,725 --> 01:15:18,422
我选择了凡人的生命
ARWEN: I choose a mortal life.

669
01:15:21,332 --> 01:15:24,221
我希望能见到他…
I wish I could've seen him...

670
01:15:25,336 --> 01:15:28,066
最后一面
...one last time.

671
01:15:39,217 --> 01:15:40,650
大人？
Sir?

672
01:15:42,487 --> 01:15:45,047
希优顿王找你
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

673
01:16:05,843 --> 01:16:07,799
我先走了
I take my leave.

674
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:23,688
爱隆王
My lord Elrond.

675
01:16:24,295 --> 01:16:27,753
我是为了挚爱的女儿而来
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

676
01:16:30,868 --> 01:16:32,859
亚文就快死了
Arwen is dying.

677
01:16:37,675 --> 01:16:41,702
她无法抵抗魔多的邪恶力量
She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.

678
01:16:42,446 --> 01:16:45,836
暮星的光芒越来越微弱
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

679
01:16:46,017 --> 01:16:50,010
索伦的力量日益强大她就逐渐失去生命力
As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.

680
01:16:50,187 --> 01:16:53,918
她的生命和魔戒的命运息息相关
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.

681
01:16:54,692 --> 01:16:57,252
魔影即将笼罩我们
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

682
01:16:57,628 --> 01:16:59,323
世界末日即将来临
The end has come.

683
01:16:59,697 --> 01:17:02,291
这是魔王的末日，不是人类的终结
It will not be our end, but his.

684
01:17:03,067 --> 01:17:06,628
你们绝对无法获得胜利
You ride to war, but not to victory.

685
01:17:07,672 --> 01:17:11,335
索伦的邪恶大军正向米那斯提力斯前进
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.

686
01:17:11,509 --> 01:17:15,900
他另外又派一支军队从河面展开攻击
But in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river.

687
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,770
他派昂巴海盗船从南方进攻
A fleet of Corsairs ships sails from the south.

688
01:17:20,418 --> 01:17:22,477
两天后就会攻到
They'll be in the city in two days.

689
01:17:22,987 --> 01:17:25,842
你们寡不敌众
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

690
01:17:26,557 --> 01:17:28,684
你们需要搬更多救兵
You need more men.

691
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,789
没有救兵可搬了
There are none.

692
01:17:32,563 --> 01:17:36,454
亡灵之山住了一些人
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

693
01:17:45,476 --> 01:17:47,637
他们是杀人凶手…
Murderers...

694
01:17:47,812 --> 01:17:49,245
叛徒
...traitors.

695
01:17:51,682 --> 01:17:53,877
你要我找他们帮忙？
You would call upon them to fight?

696
01:17:54,051 --> 01:17:55,609
他们什么都不相信
They believe in nothing.

697
01:17:55,786 --> 01:17:57,913
也不听任何人的命令
They answer to no one.

698
01:17:58,089 --> 01:18:01,149
他们会听刚铎人皇的命令
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

699
01:18:08,299 --> 01:18:13,430
安都瑞尔，西方之炎用纳希尔圣剑碎片重铸而成
Anduril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil.

700
01:18:27,752 --> 01:18:32,143
索伦绝对不会忘记伊兰迪尔圣剑
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.

701
01:18:46,203 --> 01:18:50,958
曾经破碎的圣剑将再度回到米那斯提力斯
The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.

702
01:18:51,142 --> 01:18:53,531
能驾驭这把圣剑的人…
The man who can wield the power of this sword...

703
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:57,568
将召集史上最强大的军队
...can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.

704
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:01,577
把游侠的身份放下
Put aside the Ranger.

705
01:19:01,752 --> 01:19:05,085
成为你命中注定该当的人皇
Become who you were born to be.

706
01:19:05,256 --> 01:19:07,281
往丁祸走上亡者之道
Take the Dimholt road.

707
01:19:11,328 --> 01:19:14,024
我给人类希望
[IN ELVISH]

708
01:19:17,368 --> 01:19:21,429
我不是为了自己

709
01:19:33,317 --> 01:19:34,978
你为什么要走？
Why are you doing this?

710
01:19:35,419 --> 01:19:38,616
大战即将展开，你不能临阵脱逃
The war lies to the east. You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

711
01:19:41,058 --> 01:19:43,151
你不能抛弃这些弟兄
You cannot abandon the men.

712
01:19:44,428 --> 01:19:46,020
伊欧文…
Eowyn...

713
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:48,392
我们需要你
We need you here.

714
01:19:49,533 --> 01:19:51,398
你为什么跟来？
Why have you come?

715
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:55,026
难道你不知道吗？
Do you not know?

716
01:20:04,348 --> 01:20:07,340
你爱的只是一个理想、一个幻影
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.

717
01:20:11,255 --> 01:20:13,644
我不能回报你的爱
I cannot give you what you seek.

718
01:20:34,011 --> 01:20:36,309
你想去哪儿？
Just where do you think you're off to?

719
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,811
这次不行
Not this time.

720
01:20:37,982 --> 01:20:40,177
你要留下来，金雳
- This time you must stay, Gimli. - Mm.

721
01:20:42,887 --> 01:20:45,720
你还不知道矮人族最固执吗？
Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

722
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:49,553
你就认了吧，我们要跟你去
You might as well accept it. We're going with you, laddie.

723
01:21:11,882 --> 01:21:14,043
-怎么回事？-他要去哪儿？
MAN 1: What's happening? - Where is he going?

724
01:21:14,385 --> 01:21:16,250
他要去哪儿？
Where's he going?

725
01:21:18,856 --> 01:21:20,881
我不明白
I don't understand.

726
01:21:25,296 --> 01:21:27,093
亚拉冈大人！
MAN 2: Lord Aragorn!

727
01:21:27,531 --> 01:21:30,227
他为什么在大战前夕离开？
MAN 1: Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

728
01:21:31,435 --> 01:21:33,528
因为他觉得没有希望
- He leaves because there is no hope.

729
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:36,298
因为他非走不可
- He leaves because he must.

730
01:21:36,473 --> 01:21:38,202
我们势单力薄
GAMLING: Too few have come.

731
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:40,502
不可能击败魔多大军
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

732
01:21:43,047 --> 01:21:44,674
没错…
No...

733
01:21:45,115 --> 01:21:46,377
是不可能
...we cannot.

734
01:21:49,253 --> 01:21:53,041
但是我们还是要誓死奋战
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.

735
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:09,200
我留下了指示
I have left instruction.

736
01:22:11,876 --> 01:22:15,141
我死后人民要听你的命令
The people are to follow your rule in my stead.

737
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:23,983
坐上我在金殿的王位
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

738
01:22:25,222 --> 01:22:28,055
如果我们不幸落败…
Long may you defend Edoras...

739
01:22:28,225 --> 01:22:30,557
你要全力捍卫伊多拉斯
...if the battle goes ill.

740
01:22:31,662 --> 01:22:35,052
你还要我尽什么职责？
What other duty would you have me do, my lord?

741
01:22:37,301 --> 01:22:39,223
职责？
Duty?

742
01:22:41,405 --> 01:22:42,770
没有了
No.

743
01:22:51,048 --> 01:22:53,175
我只希望你能重展笑容…
I would have you smile again...

744
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:01,580
别再为死去的人难过
...not grieve for those whose time has come.

745
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:09,957
你要率领洛汗人民重建家园…
You shall live to see these days renewed...

746
01:23:14,305 --> 01:23:17,035
永远不再悲伤
...and no more despair.

747
01:23:23,247 --> 01:23:26,944
什么人会住在这种鬼地方？
GIMLl: What kind of army would linger in such a place?

748
01:23:27,117 --> 01:23:28,948
受到诅咒的人
LEGOLAS: One that is cursed.

749
01:23:30,921 --> 01:23:33,446
很久以前亡灵之山的人…
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...

750
01:23:33,891 --> 01:23:36,655
向刚铎最后一位人皇宣誓…
...to the last king of Gondor...

751
01:23:37,227 --> 01:23:38,819
只要他一声令下…
...to come to his aid...

752
01:23:38,996 --> 01:23:40,691
就会前来奋战
...to fight.

753
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:43,359
但是当那一刻来临…
But when the time came...

754
01:23:44,001 --> 01:23:46,595
刚铎的战况危急…
...when Gondor's need was dire...

755
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:48,658
他们却仓惶逃亡…
...they fled...

756
01:23:48,839 --> 01:23:52,195
消失在亡灵之山的阴影中
...vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.

757
01:23:53,243 --> 01:23:55,575
于是埃西铎诅咒他们…
And so Isildur cursed them...

758
01:23:57,114 --> 01:24:00,971
实现誓言前将永远不得安息
...never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.

759
01:24:15,265 --> 01:24:18,564
我全身的血液都结冰了
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.

760
01:24:24,108 --> 01:24:26,030
黑暗之门被封住
The way is shut.

761
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:28,766
这是亡者打造的门
It was made by those who are dead.

762
01:24:29,413 --> 01:24:31,643
由他们负责掌管
And the Dead keep it.

763
01:24:32,182 --> 01:24:33,706
路被封住了
The way is shut.

764
01:24:45,095 --> 01:24:46,585
布理哥！
Brego!

765
01:24:50,067 --> 01:24:52,797
我不怕死
I do not fear death.

766
01:25:05,082 --> 01:25:07,505
从来没听过有这种事
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

767
01:25:07,684 --> 01:25:12,348
连精灵都肯进入地底矮人却不敢？
An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?

768
01:25:12,523 --> 01:25:13,854
真是的
Oh.

769
01:25:14,024 --> 01:25:16,857
我一定会被笑死了
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

770
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:34,105
减轻负担全速赶去
We must ride light and swift.

771
01:25:34,278 --> 01:25:36,041
前面的路很长
It is a long road ahead.

772
01:25:36,213 --> 01:25:39,273
人和马都要保留精力赶到战场上作战
And man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight.

773
01:25:44,788 --> 01:25:47,814
小哈比人不该上战场，梅里大爷
Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.

774
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:50,114
我的朋友都参战了
All my friends have gone to battle.

775
01:25:50,294 --> 01:25:52,182
只有我留下来会很丢脸
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

776
01:25:52,362 --> 01:25:54,455
到米那斯提力斯要骑三天
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

777
01:25:54,631 --> 01:25:57,020
我的骑士不能浪费力气载你
And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.

778
01:25:58,035 --> 01:26:00,162
我想要参战
- I want to fight.

779
01:26:00,637 --> 01:26:02,662
别再说了
- I will say no more.

780
01:26:19,456 --> 01:26:21,412
跟我一起去
Ride with me.

781
01:26:22,893 --> 01:26:24,292
王女
My lady.

782
01:26:24,461 --> 01:26:26,827
整装出发！
EOMER: Form up! Move out!

783
01:26:26,997 --> 01:26:30,228
整装出发！
Form up! Move out!

784
01:26:33,303 --> 01:26:34,531
出发吧！
THEODEN: Ride!

785
01:26:34,705 --> 01:26:37,629
前往刚铎！
Ride now to Gondor!

786
01:27:25,522 --> 01:27:30,653
是谁闯入我的领土？
KING OF THE DEAD: Who enters my domain?

787
01:27:34,398 --> 01:27:36,628
你们要效忠的主人
One who will have your allegiance.

788
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:44,928
亡者不能容许活人过去
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

789
01:27:45,275 --> 01:27:47,903
你要容许我过去
You will suffer me.

790
01:28:11,435 --> 01:28:14,825
黑暗之门被封住了
KING OF THE DEAD: The way is shut.

791
01:28:16,006 --> 01:28:20,431
这是亡者打造的门
It was made by those who are dead.

792
01:28:20,844 --> 01:28:25,008
由他们负责掌管
And the Dead keep it.

793
01:28:34,124 --> 01:28:37,218
路被封住了
The way is shut.

794
01:28:38,996 --> 01:28:41,590
你非死不可
Now you must die.

795
01:28:45,469 --> 01:28:48,324
我命令你实现你的誓言
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

796
01:28:48,672 --> 01:28:53,598
只有刚铎人皇才能命令我
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

797
01:28:59,216 --> 01:29:01,377
圣剑早就断裂
That line was broken.

798
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:06,216
圣剑经过重铸
It has been remade.

799
01:29:14,131 --> 01:29:15,655
为我们作战…
Fight for us...

800
01:29:15,832 --> 01:29:18,392
重拾你们的尊严
...and regain your honor.

801
01:29:22,572 --> 01:29:23,903
你们怎么说？
What say you?

802
01:29:36,119 --> 01:29:37,572
你们怎么说？
What say you?

803
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,248
你在浪费时间，亚拉冈
Ah! You waste your time, Aragorn.

804
01:29:40,357 --> 01:29:43,554
他们活着没尊严，死后更没有
They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.

805
01:29:44,061 --> 01:29:46,552
我是埃西铎的子嗣
I am Isildur's heir.

806
01:29:47,097 --> 01:29:49,053
只要为我作战…
Fight for me...

807
01:29:49,633 --> 01:29:53,228
你们的誓言就算实现了
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

808
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:59,096
怎么样？
What say you?

809
01:30:09,553 --> 01:30:12,113
把门打开，快点！
IORLAS: Open the gate! Quick!

810
01:30:43,153 --> 01:30:45,144
快点！
Quick! Hurry!

811
01:30:49,726 --> 01:30:51,353
法拉墨！
Faramir!

812
01:30:52,329 --> 01:30:55,594
别跟我说他死了
Say not that he has fallen.

813
01:30:56,767 --> 01:30:58,291
他们寡不敌众
They were outnumbered.

814
01:30:58,735 --> 01:31:00,293
没有人生还
None survived.

815
01:31:01,037 --> 01:31:02,993
恐惧
Fear.

816
01:31:03,573 --> 01:31:06,770
全城充满恐惧
The city is rank with it.

817
01:31:09,112 --> 01:31:11,603
让我们为他们消除恐惧
Let us ease their pain.

818
01:31:11,815 --> 01:31:13,578
把犯人还给他们
Release the prisoners.

819
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,706
发射！
Catapults!

820
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:20,724
MAN: Shields up!

821
01:31:29,065 --> 01:31:32,489
我的儿子都死了
[TEARFULLY] My sons are spent.

822
01:31:33,537 --> 01:31:36,461
我的家族香火断绝了
My line has ended.

823
01:31:39,309 --> 01:31:40,708
他还活着！
PIPPIN: He's alive!

824
01:31:40,877 --> 01:31:44,040
宰相世家绝后了
The House of Stewards has failed.

825
01:31:44,214 --> 01:31:45,704
大人，他需要救治
He needs medicine, my lord.

826
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:49,378
我绝子绝孙了！
My line has ended!

827
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:52,877
大人！
PIPPIN: My lord!

828
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:01,848
ORC: Put it in!

829
01:32:06,436 --> 01:32:08,267
洛汗人…
Rohan...

830
01:32:09,005 --> 01:32:11,394
抛弃了我们
...has deserted us.

831
01:32:25,856 --> 01:32:29,053
希优顿背叛了我
Theoden's betrayed me.

832
01:32:40,103 --> 01:32:42,025
弃守吧！
Abandon your posts!

833
01:32:43,073 --> 01:32:46,998
快逃吧，快逃命吧！
Flee! Flee for your lives!

834
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,647
Oh!

835
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,678
准备迎敌！
Prepare for battle!

836
01:32:59,222 --> 01:33:02,385
快到墙边，保护城墙！

哈比人不该上战场

主人一定要进入隧道

黏答答的，这是什么？
It's sticky. What is it?

878
01:38:58,848 --> 01:39:01,146
你待会就知道

小小的苍蝇

891
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:54,477
他为什么哭？

892
01:42:55,051 --> 01:42:58,384
你被困在网中

也不会永远沉睡等待腐朽

916
01:47:32,749 --> 01:47:37,914
我们会像先王一样被烧成灰烬

别丢下我一个人

939

你是死了
Dead.

940

这是什么？
ORC: What's this?

941
01:53:58,701 --> 01:54:01,465
看来尸罗又跑出来打猎
Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.

942
01:54:03,439 --> 01:54:05,964
她又杀了一个猎物？
URUK-HAl: Killed another one, has she?

943
01:54:06,175 --> 01:54:08,131
没有
No.

944
01:54:10,846 --> 01:54:12,837
这小子没死
This fellow ain't dead.

945
01:54:13,182 --> 01:54:15,446
他没死？
Not dead?

946
01:54:15,618 --> 01:54:21,409
她先用毒刺刺他他就像死鱼一样动弹不得
She jabs him with her stinger, and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

947
01:54:21,757 --> 01:54:24,521
然后她再慢慢享用大餐
Then she has her way with them.

948
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:26,555
这是她的独门秘方

949

保持肉的鲜度

950
01:54:29,365 --> 01:54:31,697
把他抬到高塔上！
Get him to the tower!

951
01:54:35,137 --> 01:54:36,866
山姆卫斯，你这个笨蛋
Samwise, you fool.

952
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:39,872
这臭小子两小时后就会活过来
URUK-HAl: This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.

953
01:54:40,042 --> 01:54:42,533
到时候他就会不想活了

他已经没救了

956
01:55:13,709 --> 01:55:15,040
他在燃烧着
Already burning.

957
01:55:15,411 --> 01:55:17,402

他没有死！
He's not dead!

- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin. PIPPIN: No! No! No!

963
01:55:32,228 --> 01:55:35,527
我解除你的职务
I release you from my service.

964
01:55:36,866 --> 01:55:41,189
你想怎么死就去死吧
Go now and die in what way seems best to you.

965
01:55:43,405 --> 01:55:45,737
把燃油倒上去！
Pour oil on the wood!

966
01:55:47,443 --> 01:55:49,468
快呀！别站在那里！

967
01:55:49,979 --> 01:55:52,868
-快点！动作快点！-甘道夫！

968
01:55:53,282 --> 01:55:54,715
甘道夫呢？
Where is Gandalf?

969
01:55:55,851 --> 01:55:57,250
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

970
01:56:02,625 --> 01:56:03,751
撤退！
GANDALF: Retreat!

971
01:56:05,928 --> 01:56:07,657
城门被攻破了！
The city is breached!

972
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:10,788
回到上面！
Fall back to the second level!

973

让妇孺撤退！
Get the women and children out!

974

撤退！
Retreat!

快呀，来吧

攻进城内、赶尽杀绝

979
01:56:57,479 --> 01:57:00,334
战斗！奋战到底！

980
01:57:00,516 --> 01:57:01,813
为生存战斗！
Fight for your lives!

981
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:52,890
鼓起勇气，梅里
Courage, Merry.

982
01:57:53,035 --> 01:57:55,401
为我们的朋友鼓起勇气
Courage for our friends.

983
01:57:58,941 --> 01:58:02,035
组成阵形，笨蛋，组成阵形！
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

984
01:58:02,211 --> 01:58:05,442
长矛手在前、弓箭手在后
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

985
01:58:13,555 --> 01:58:16,683
伊欧墨，率兵攻击左翼
THEODEN: Eomer, take your eored down the left flank.

986
01:58:16,859 --> 01:58:18,121
攻击左翼
EOMER: Flank ready.

987
01:58:18,293 --> 01:58:21,148
加姆林，跟着王旗向中锋进攻
THEODEN: Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.

988
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:25,061
葛林伯，率领精兵攻击右翼
Grimbold, take your company right after you pass the wall.

989
01:58:25,234 --> 01:58:27,964
前进吧，别害怕黑暗！
Forth, and fear no darkness!

990
01:58:28,137 --> 01:58:31,959
起来吧，希优顿王的骑士！
Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!

991
01:58:32,241 --> 01:58:37,406
长矛向前刺、盾牌用力挡…
Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered...

992
01:58:37,613 --> 01:58:41,310
举剑奋战…
...a sword-day, a red day...

993
01:58:41,483 --> 01:58:45,078
用敌人的鲜血染红大地！
...ere the sun rises!

994
01:58:52,828 --> 01:58:57,151
不管怎样都紧跟着我，我会保护你
Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.

995
01:59:03,505 --> 01:59:05,598
冲啊！
THEODEN: Ride now!

996
01:59:07,076 --> 01:59:09,203
冲啊！
Ride now!

997
01:59:09,812 --> 01:59:12,576
为了捍卫中土世界…
Ride! Ride for ruin...

998
01:59:12,748 --> 01:59:15,512
勇往直前！
...and the world's ending!

999
01:59:17,453 --> 01:59:18,852
誓死奋战！
Death!

1000
01:59:19,288 --> 01:59:22,177
誓死奋战！
ALL: Death!

1001
01:59:22,357 --> 01:59:25,588
-誓死奋战！-誓死奋战！
THEODEN: Death! ALL: Death!

1002
01:59:26,028 --> 01:59:27,620
-誓死奋战！-誓死奋战！
- Death! - Death!

1003
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:31,754
-誓死奋战！-誓死奋战！
- Death! - Death!

1004
01:59:36,872 --> 01:59:39,295
冲啊，伊欧子嗣！
Forth Eorlingas!

1005
02:00:22,251 --> 02:00:24,014
放箭！
Fire!

1006
02:00:27,823 --> 02:00:29,017
誓死奋战！
Death!

1007
02:00:33,228 --> 02:00:34,525
冲啊！
Charge!

1008
02:00:34,963 --> 02:00:36,555
快放箭！
Fire at will!

1009
02:01:03,458 --> 02:01:04,686
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

1010
02:01:07,229 --> 02:01:10,960
甘道夫，迪耐瑟发疯了！
Gandalf! Denethor has lost his mind!

1011
02:01:11,266 --> 02:01:13,530
他要活活烧死法拉墨！
He's burning Faramir alive!

1012
02:01:13,702 --> 02:01:15,465
快跳上来！
Up! Quickly!

1013
02:01:46,268 --> 02:01:49,533
在我们身上点火
Set a fire in our flesh.

1014
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:08,952
快给我住手！
Stay this madness!

1015
02:02:43,292 --> 02:02:45,021
不！
No!

1016
02:02:45,193 --> 02:02:47,855
你不能夺走我儿子！
You will not take my son from me!

1017
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:50,362
不！不！
[SCREAMS]

1018
02:02:50,613 --> 02:02:51,905
Yah!

1019
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:02,971
法拉墨
Faramir.

1020
02:03:16,525 --> 02:03:20,484
爱克西里昂之子迪耐瑟死了
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1021
02:03:48,023 --> 02:03:49,786
把他们赶到河边！
Drive them to the river!

1022
02:03:52,561 --> 02:03:54,552
捍卫王都！
Make safe the city!

1023
02:04:34,569 --> 02:04:36,491
重组阵形！
Re-form the line!

1024
02:04:37,639 --> 02:04:39,595
重组阵形！
Re-form the line!

1025
02:04:46,615 --> 02:04:49,243
准备进攻，正面迎敌！
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1026
02:04:49,851 --> 02:04:52,012
冲啊！
Charge!

1027
02:05:58,186 --> 02:05:59,585
杀了他！
MAN 1: Cut him down!

1028
02:06:01,356 --> 02:06:03,244
跟我来！
MAN 2: Follow me!

1029
02:06:26,281 --> 02:06:28,875
你来拉缰绳！
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1030
02:06:31,286 --> 02:06:32,548
往左拉！
Left!

1031
02:06:49,971 --> 02:06:51,632
瞄准他们的头射箭！
Aim for their heads!

1032
02:06:57,646 --> 02:07:00,911
把他扳倒，把他扳倒！
Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!

1033
02:07:14,763 --> 02:07:16,287
梅里！
Merry!

1034
02:07:37,986 --> 02:07:40,011
没想到我的生命在这儿走到了尽头
I didn't think it would end this way.

1035
02:07:41,323 --> 02:07:42,722
尽头？
End?

1036
02:07:43,959 --> 02:07:46,086
不，这不是尽头
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1037
02:07:48,597 --> 02:07:51,725
死亡只是另一条路…
Death is just another path...

1038
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:53,995
我们都要走的路
...one that we all must take.

1039
02:07:55,236 --> 02:07:58,694
当灰色的天空变晴…
The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...

1040
02:07:58,873 --> 02:08:02,502
眼前一片银白透明
...and all turns to silver glass.

1041
02:08:04,679 --> 02:08:06,601
你就会看见它
And then you see it.

1042
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:10,916
什么？
What, Gandalf?

1043
02:08:12,053 --> 02:08:13,384
看见什么？
See what?

1044
02:08:14,623 --> 02:08:16,818
洁白的海岸…
White shores...

1045
02:08:18,526 --> 02:08:20,915
死后的世界
...and beyond.

1046
02:08:22,397 --> 02:08:24,160
在黎明的晨羲中…
A far green country...

1047
02:08:24,899 --> 02:08:27,788
有一片辽阔的绿茵
...under a swift sunrise.

1048
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,364
哇塞…
Well...

1049
02:08:33,541 --> 02:08:35,202
听起来不错嘛
...that isn't so bad.

1050
02:08:35,377 --> 02:08:36,776
是啊
No.

1051
02:08:38,813 --> 02:08:40,474
是不错
No, it isn't.

1052
02:08:56,898 --> 02:09:00,197
大家围过来！围过来！
Rally to me! To me!

1053
02:09:20,989 --> 02:09:25,517
好好享用他的肉
WITCH-KING: Feast on his flesh.

1054
02:09:29,864 --> 02:09:32,230
你敢碰他我就杀了你
I will kill you if you touch him.

1055
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:37,861
别阻挡戒灵对他的猎物下手
WITCH-KING: Do not come between the Nazg?l and his prey.

1056
02:10:46,274 --> 02:10:49,471
你们迟到了，混蛋海盗！
ORC COMMANDER: Late as usual, pirate scum!

1057
02:10:49,911 --> 02:10:52,141
准备大开杀戒吧
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1058
02:10:52,313 --> 02:10:55,544
快点，臭海盗！快滚下船！
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

1059
02:11:11,032 --> 02:11:13,125
再来比比谁杀的敌人多
There's plenty for the both of us.

1060
02:11:13,301 --> 02:11:15,394
最猛的矮人才会赢
May the best Dwarf win.

1061
02:11:39,928 --> 02:11:42,158
你真蠢
WITCH-KING: You fool.

1062
02:11:42,330 --> 02:11:45,720
没有男人杀得了我
No man can kill me.

1063
02:11:48,102 --> 02:11:51,265
领死吧
Die now.

1064
02:12:01,950 --> 02:12:03,941
我不是男人
I am no man.

1065
02:12:20,702 --> 02:12:24,160
-十五！十六！-十七！
- Fifteen! Sixteen! GIMLl: Seventeen!

1066
02:12:40,188 --> 02:12:42,816
-二十九！-勒苟拉斯！
GIMLl: Twenty-nine! - Legolas!

1067
02:13:05,213 --> 02:13:07,602
三十三，三十四
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1068
02:13:54,696 --> 02:13:57,062
那样也只能算一个！
That still only counts as one!

1069
02:13:57,231 --> 02:13:59,392
好，来吧！
All right, then. Come on!

1070
02:14:43,111 --> 02:14:45,944
我认得你…
THEODEN: I know your face...

1071
02:14:47,815 --> 02:14:49,680
伊欧文
...Eowyn.

1072
02:14:52,253 --> 02:14:54,619
我就快死了
My eyes darken.

1073
02:14:55,757 --> 02:14:57,122
不
No.

1074
02:14:57,959 --> 02:14:59,586
不
No.

1075
02:15:01,696 --> 02:15:04,187
我会救你
I am going to save you.

1076
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:07,866
你已经救了我
You already did.

1077
02:15:11,506 --> 02:15:13,133
伊欧文…
Eowyn...

1078
02:15:14,642 --> 02:15:17,133
我的伤势太重了
...my body is broken.

1079
02:15:22,183 --> 02:15:24,674
你要让我走
You have to let me go.

1080
02:15:30,558 --> 02:15:33,118
我将加入列祖列宗…
I go to my fathers...

1081
02:15:34,595 --> 02:15:37,428
就算在伟大的先王身边…
...in whose mighty company...

1082
02:15:37,865 --> 02:15:41,198
我也不会感到羞愧
...I shall not now feel ashamed.

1083
02:15:57,819 --> 02:15:59,446
伊欧文
Eowyn.

1084
02:16:45,933 --> 02:16:48,424
让我们走吧
Release us.

1085
02:16:50,338 --> 02:16:52,033
最好不要
Bad idea.

1086
02:16:52,206 --> 02:16:56,028
这些死人头，在危机时刻还挺有用的
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they're dead.

1087
02:16:56,210 --> 02:16:58,201
你答应过我们
You gave us your word.

1088
02:16:59,981 --> 02:17:02,074
你们实现了誓言
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1089
02:17:03,417 --> 02:17:04,748
去吧
Go.

1090
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:07,315
安息吧
Be at peace.

1091
02:17:41,956 --> 02:17:43,446
梅里
Merry.

1092
02:17:46,194 --> 02:17:47,456
梅里，是我
Merry, it's me.

1093
02:17:50,097 --> 02:17:51,621
我是皮聘
It's Pippin.

1094
02:17:54,135 --> 02:17:56,399
我就知道你会找到我
I knew you'd find me.

1095
02:17:56,571 --> 02:17:57,799
当然
Yes.

1096
02:18:00,208 --> 02:18:02,301
你要撇下我不管吗？
Are you going to leave me?

1097
02:18:02,843 --> 02:18:04,538
不，梅里
No, Merry.

1098
02:18:05,846 --> 02:18:08,076
我要照顾你
I'm going to look after you.

1099
02:18:52,093 --> 02:18:53,526
别碰它！
Hands off!

1100
02:18:53,694 --> 02:18:56,857
那件银衣是我的
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1101
02:18:57,098 --> 02:19:01,262
我要把一切，都交给伟大的邪眼
It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else.

1102
02:19:02,803 --> 02:19:06,625
我才不听魔窟鼠辈的命令！
URUK-HAl: I don't take orders from stinking Morgul rats!

1103
02:19:07,508 --> 02:19:12,673
你敢碰它我就一剑把你刺死
ORC: You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.

1104
02:19:33,367 --> 02:19:35,130
那混球想杀我
The scum tried to knife me.

1105
02:19:35,303 --> 02:19:37,066
宰了他！
Kill him!

1106
02:20:55,447 --> 02:20:56,905
Argh!

1107
02:20:58,319 --> 02:21:00,310
这是为了佛罗多！
That's for Frodo!

1108
02:21:00,721 --> 02:21:02,814
这是为了夏尔！
And for the Shire!

1109
02:21:06,427 --> 02:21:08,554
这是为了我的老爹！
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1110
02:21:30,484 --> 02:21:33,783
别哎哎叫了，臭小子
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1111
02:21:34,922 --> 02:21:39,655
我要在你身上刺个透明窟窿
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1112
02:21:47,001 --> 02:21:48,662
我先要你的命
- Not if I stick you first.

1113
02:21:48,836 --> 02:21:50,360
山姆！
- Sam!

1114
02:21:55,409 --> 02:21:57,434
山姆，对不起
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1115
02:21:57,611 --> 02:21:59,670
我真是对不起你
Sorry for everything.

1116
02:22:00,181 --> 02:22:03,810
-我先把你救出去-太迟了，一切都完了
- Let's get you out of here. - It's too late. It's over.

1117
02:22:03,984 --> 02:22:06,873
他们把它拿走了…
They've taken it. Sam...

1118
02:22:07,655 --> 02:22:09,145
他们把魔戒拿走了
...they took the Ring.

1119
02:22:09,924 --> 02:22:12,620
放心，他们并没有
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1120
02:22:24,605 --> 02:22:26,800
我以为你死了
I thought I'd lost you.

1121
02:22:27,208 --> 02:22:28,903
所以我把它拿走
So I took it.

1122
02:22:30,077 --> 02:22:32,136
我只是保管它
Only for safekeeping.

1123
02:22:33,414 --> 02:22:35,143
把它给我
Give it to me.

1124
02:22:38,719 --> 02:22:40,914
把魔戒给我
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1125
02:22:45,593 --> 02:22:46,821
山姆
[VOICE ECHOING] Sam.

1126
02:22:48,429 --> 02:22:50,385
把魔戒交给我
Give me the Ring.

1127
02:23:11,118 --> 02:23:12,380
你必须明白
You must understand.

1128
02:23:15,890 --> 02:23:17,721
魔戒是我的责任
The Ring is my burden.

1129
02:23:18,926 --> 02:23:21,053
它会毁了你
It will destroy you, Sam.

1130
02:23:24,231 --> 02:23:26,187
来吧，佛罗多
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1131
02:23:27,535 --> 02:23:29,162
你最好找衣服穿
We best find you some clothes.

1132
02:23:29,336 --> 02:23:32,362
你不能光着身子去魔多
You can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin.

1133
02:23:54,094 --> 02:23:56,324
我们到了，佛罗多
SAM: We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1134
02:23:56,830 --> 02:23:59,128
我们到了魔多
We made it to Mordor.

1135
02:24:00,467 --> 02:24:02,128
有好多敌人
FRODO: There are so many of them.

1136
02:24:03,070 --> 02:24:05,664
我们一定会被发现
We'll never get through unseen.

1137
02:24:10,811 --> 02:24:14,144
是他，邪眼
It's him, the Eye.

1138
02:24:21,855 --> 02:24:24,449
我们非去不可
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1139
02:24:24,925 --> 02:24:26,984
没别的选择
There's nothing for it.

1140
02:24:29,964 --> 02:24:34,389
来吧，先下了山再说
Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.

1141
02:24:43,744 --> 02:24:47,009
我看不到佛罗多的行踪
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1142
02:24:48,349 --> 02:24:51,147
黑暗笼罩大地
The darkness is deepening.

1143
02:24:51,352 --> 02:24:53,718
如果魔戒被索伦夺去就完了
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

1144
02:24:53,887 --> 02:24:55,912
这是迟早的事
It's only a matter of time.

1145
02:24:57,424 --> 02:24:59,813
他是吃了场败仗…
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1146
02:25:00,894 --> 02:25:05,388
但是他正在魔多，重新集结大军
...but behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.

1147
02:25:05,566 --> 02:25:07,397
让他留在那里吧
Let him stay there.

1148
02:25:07,568 --> 02:25:10,230
让他去死吧！我们为什么要怕他？
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1149
02:25:10,404 --> 02:25:15,569
因为有一万半兽人大军会阻止佛罗多前往末日火山
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1150
02:25:22,316 --> 02:25:24,807
我等于是让他去送死
I've sent him to his death.

1151
02:25:26,387 --> 02:25:27,649
不
No.

1152
02:25:28,155 --> 02:25:30,578
佛罗多仍有一线希望
There is still hope for Frodo.

1153
02:25:30,924 --> 02:25:35,054
他需要时间穿越葛哥洛斯平原
He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1154
02:25:36,130 --> 02:25:38,724
-我们能替他争取时间-该怎么做？
- We can give him that. - How?

1155
02:25:39,033 --> 02:25:41,763
把索伦的大军引出来
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1156
02:25:41,935 --> 02:25:44,028
让魔多变成空城
Empty his lands.

1157
02:25:44,271 --> 02:25:47,331
然后我们以全部兵力进攻黑门
Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.

1158
02:25:47,975 --> 02:25:51,032
我们的兵力不能打败敌人
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.

1159
02:25:51,145 --> 02:25:52,703
不必打败他们
Not for ourselves.

1160
02:25:52,946 --> 02:25:58,509
只要让索伦心无旁骛专心地对付我们
But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1161
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:04,108
佛罗多就有成功的机会
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1162
02:26:04,858 --> 02:26:06,086
声东击西
A diversion.

1163
02:26:06,860 --> 02:26:09,283
索伦一定会起疑心
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1164
02:26:10,064 --> 02:26:12,123
他不会上当
He will not take the bait.

1165
02:26:12,299 --> 02:26:13,891
成功机会很小…
Certainty of death...

1166
02:26:14,068 --> 02:26:16,662
而且必死无疑…
...small chance of success...

1167
02:26:17,705 --> 02:26:19,297
咱们还在等什么？
...what are we waiting for?

1168
02:26:37,891 --> 02:26:40,917
快去防守大门！
LEAD ORC: To the Gate, you slugs!

1169
02:26:41,829 --> 02:26:45,356
动作快，防守大门！
Move it! To the Gate!

1170
02:26:51,438 --> 02:26:53,099
你看，那些半兽人…
SAM: Look, the Orcs...

1171
02:26:53,574 --> 02:26:55,599
他们走了
...they're moving off.

1172
02:26:56,777 --> 02:26:58,768
你看吧，佛罗多…
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1173
02:26:58,946 --> 02:27:01,141
我们终于有好运气了
...some luck at last.

1174
02:27:56,103 --> 02:27:57,730
拿去
Take mine.

1175
02:27:58,238 --> 02:28:00,331
里面还有几滴水
There's a few drops left.

1176
02:28:15,589 --> 02:28:18,149
可是回程就没水喝了
There will be none left for the return journey.

1177
02:28:19,059 --> 02:28:22,256
我想我们是回不去了，佛罗多
I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1178
02:29:15,148 --> 02:29:17,309
佛罗多，快趴下！
Frodo, get down!

1179
02:29:19,052 --> 02:29:20,940
快躲起来！
Hide!

1180
02:29:31,098 --> 02:29:33,123
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1181
02:29:38,972 --> 02:29:40,405
他们在哪里？
Where are they?

1182
02:30:16,558 --> 02:30:19,618
黑暗魔君快现身！
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1183
02:30:20,529 --> 02:30:23,362
我要让他就地正法！
Let justice be done upon him!

1184
02:30:55,798 --> 02:30:57,595
退回去
Fall back.

1185
02:30:57,900 --> 02:30:59,925
退回去！
Fall back!

1186
02:31:12,147 --> 02:31:14,172
它走了
SAM: It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1187
02:31:16,118 --> 02:31:19,645
它往北方去了
The light's passed on, away towards the north.

1188
02:31:19,855 --> 02:31:21,652
它被什么引开来
Something's drawn its gaze.

1189
02:31:39,174 --> 02:31:41,938
稳住，稳住
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1190
02:31:44,012 --> 02:31:48,005
刚铎和洛汗的好男儿，我的好兄弟！
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1191
02:31:50,886 --> 02:31:52,774
我在你们眼中…
I see in your eyes...

1192
02:31:53,155 --> 02:31:57,182
看见我心中也感受到的恐惧
...the same fear that would take the heart of me.

1193
02:31:59,161 --> 02:32:02,517
有一天人类将失去勇气…
A day may come when the courage of Men fails...

1194
02:32:02,698 --> 02:32:06,520
我们会众叛亲离、一败涂地
...when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship.

1195
02:32:06,702 --> 02:32:09,364
但不是在今天
But it is not this day.

1196
02:32:09,671 --> 02:32:12,697
有一天邪将胜正…
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...

1197
02:32:12,875 --> 02:32:15,730
人类的世界也会完全毁灭
...when the age of Men comes crashing down.

1198
02:32:15,911 --> 02:32:18,402
但不是在今天
But it is not this day.

1199
02:32:18,547 --> 02:32:20,208
今天我们要誓死奋战！
This day we fight!

1200
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:26,339
为了你们在世上所珍惜的一切…
By all that you hold dear on this good earth...

1201
02:32:26,522 --> 02:32:30,754
一定要奋战到底，西方的人类！
...I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1202
02:33:59,248 --> 02:34:02,775
我从来没想过会跟一个精灵一起战死
Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an Elf.

1203
02:34:03,252 --> 02:34:05,584
跟一个朋友一起战死呢？
What about side by side with a friend?

1204
02:34:09,124 --> 02:34:10,887
好
Aye.

1205
02:34:11,727 --> 02:34:13,490
我愿意
I could do that.

1206
02:34:43,825 --> 02:34:45,884
你还记得夏尔吗？
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

1207
02:34:48,864 --> 02:34:51,128
春天就快来到
Lt'll be spring soon.

1208
02:34:51,933 --> 02:34:54,629
果树都会开花
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1209
02:34:54,803 --> 02:34:58,466
鸟儿也会在榛树上筑巢
And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.

1210
02:34:59,841 --> 02:35:03,834
人们很快就要收割大麦…
And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields...

1211
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:09,237
沾鲜奶油吃初摘的草莓
...and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.

1212
02:35:11,186 --> 02:35:13,677
你记得草莓的味道吗？
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

1213
02:35:15,290 --> 02:35:16,985
不记得
[HOARSELY] No, Sam.

1214
02:35:17,159 --> 02:35:20,083
我不记得食物的味道…
I can't recall the taste of food...

1215
02:35:21,229 --> 02:35:24,528
也不记得流水声…
...nor the sound of water...

1216
02:35:24,700 --> 02:35:28,295
或是稻草香
...nor the touch of grass.

1217
02:35:29,237 --> 02:35:30,761
我…
I'm...

1218
02:35:31,673 --> 02:35:33,038
赤裸裸站在黑暗中
...naked in the dark.

1219
02:35:34,710 --> 02:35:37,008
我和邪眼之间
There's... There's nothing.

1220
02:35:37,179 --> 02:35:41,878
没有任何阻隔
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.

1221
02:35:43,118 --> 02:35:45,040
我的双眼…
I can see him...

1222
02:35:45,487 --> 02:35:47,114
清楚地看到他
...with my waking eyes.

1223
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:50,681
那就把它毁掉吧…
Then let us be rid of it...

1224
02:35:51,226 --> 02:35:53,490
让它永远消失
...once and for all.

1225
02:35:54,196 --> 02:35:56,255
来吧，佛罗多
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1226
02:35:56,431 --> 02:35:59,059
我不能替你背负这重担…
I can't carry it for you...

1227
02:35:59,501 --> 02:36:01,526
但是我可以背你
...but I can carry you.

1228
02:36:02,070 --> 02:36:03,833
来吧！
Come on!

1229
02:36:34,236 --> 02:36:37,160
亚拉冈
SAURON: Aragorn.

1230
02:36:48,750 --> 02:36:51,344
伊力萨王
Elessar.

1231
02:37:03,331 --> 02:37:05,754
为了佛罗多
For Frodo.

1232
02:37:40,702 --> 02:37:42,192
你看，佛罗多
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1233
02:37:42,904 --> 02:37:45,134
一道门
A doorway.

1234
02:37:45,707 --> 02:37:47,368
就快到了
We're almost there.

1235
02:37:49,711 --> 02:37:53,670
聪明的哈比人爬到这么高！
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1236
02:38:53,308 --> 02:38:55,173
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1237
02:39:22,270 --> 02:39:24,033
巨鹰
Eagles.

1238
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:26,930
巨鹰来帮忙了！
The eagles are coming!

1239
02:39:49,764 --> 02:39:51,652
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1240
02:39:56,905 --> 02:39:58,202
我在这里，山姆
I'm here, Sam.

1241
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:07,272
毁了它！
Destroy it!

1242
02:40:17,859 --> 02:40:21,124
快点，快呀！
Go on! Now!

1243
02:40:21,296 --> 02:40:23,856
把它丢入烈焰中！
Throw it in the fire!

1244
02:40:37,245 --> 02:40:39,907
你还在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

1245
02:40:41,783 --> 02:40:44,149
快放手！
Just let it go!

1246
02:41:17,352 --> 02:41:19,616
魔戒是我的
The Ring is mine.

1247
02:41:23,158 --> 02:41:24,921
不
No.

1248
02:41:25,326 --> 02:41:26,623
不要
No.

1249
02:41:35,036 --> 02:41:37,698
不！
No!

1250
02:43:22,143 --> 02:43:24,008
好耶！
GOLLUM: Yes!

1251
02:43:25,213 --> 02:43:26,908
好耶！
Yes!

1252
02:43:28,049 --> 02:43:30,904
宝贝！宝贝！
Precious! Precious!

1253
02:43:31,085 --> 02:43:34,248
宝贝！宝贝！
Precious! Precious!

1254
02:44:27,175 --> 02:44:29,006
把手伸出来！
Give me your hand!

1255
02:44:37,352 --> 02:44:39,775
抓住我的手！
Take my hand!

1256
02:44:42,457 --> 02:44:43,754
不！
No!

1257
02:44:51,032 --> 02:44:52,988
千万别放手
Don't you let go.

1258
02:44:57,572 --> 02:44:59,164
别放手
Don't let go.

1259
02:45:00,775 --> 02:45:02,265
抓住！
Reach!

1260
02:46:31,432 --> 02:46:34,287
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1261
02:46:34,869 --> 02:46:37,895
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1262
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:01,079
它不见了
It's gone.

1263
02:48:05,326 --> 02:48:07,317
任务完成了
It's done.

1264
02:48:07,795 --> 02:48:09,786
没错，佛罗多
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1265
02:48:11,199 --> 02:48:13,588
一切都结束了
It's over now.

1266
02:48:39,026 --> 02:48:41,620
我看得到夏尔了
I can see the Shire.

1267
02:48:43,831 --> 02:48:46,163
烈酒河
The Brandywine River.

1268
02:48:48,302 --> 02:48:50,293
袋底洞
Bag End.

1269
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:55,336

在宴会上放的花火
The lights in the Party Tree.

1271
02:49:01,015 --> 02:49:04,143
小玫卡顿在跳舞
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1272
02:49:05,286 --> 02:49:07,982
她头上绑了丝带
She had ribbons in her hair.

1273
02:49:10,925 --> 02:49:13,849
如果我要娶老婆…
If ever I was to marry someone...

1274
02:49:14,795 --> 02:49:17,025
一定要娶她
...it would've been her.

1275
02:49:18,499 --> 02:49:20,524
一定会是她
It would've been her.

1276
02:49:32,413 --> 02:49:35,905
我很高兴有你在，山姆…
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

1277
02:49:40,188 --> 02:49:43,112
跟我一起走到尽头
...here at the end of all things.

1278
02:51:32,800 --> 02:51:34,825
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

1279
02:51:54,488 --> 02:51:56,479
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1280
02:52:16,277 --> 02:52:18,108
金雳！
Gimli!

1281
02:54:01,081 --> 02:54:04,847
人皇的时代来临了
Now come the days of the king.

1282
02:54:09,857 --> 02:54:12,155
愿神祝福你
May they be blessed.

1283
02:54:32,446 --> 02:54:35,108
这一天的辉煌不是属于一个人…
This day does not belong to one man...

1284
02:54:35,282 --> 02:54:37,147
而是属于每一个人
...but to all.

1285
02:54:38,819 --> 02:54:41,743
让我们同心协力重建家园…
Let us together rebuild this world...

1286
02:54:41,922 --> 02:54:46,154
一起分享太平盛世
...that we may share in the days of peace.

1287
02:57:20,648 --> 02:57:22,741
我的朋友们…
My friends...

1288
02:57:28,022 --> 02:57:30,684
你们不必向任何人鞠躬
...you bow to no one.

1289
02:58:14,868 --> 02:58:16,995
故事终于告一段落
FRODO: And thus it was.

1290
02:58:17,171 --> 02:58:20,800
中土世界第四纪元就此展开
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1291
02:58:20,974 --> 02:58:23,499
至于魔戒远征队…
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1292
02:58:23,677 --> 02:58:28,171
虽然他们的友谊永远长存…
...though eternally bound by friendship and love...

1293
02:58:28,348 --> 02:58:30,771
但是也该曲终人散
...was ended.

1294

甘道夫派我们踏上这段旅程的十三个月后…
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

1295
02:58:40,728 --> 02:58:44,960
我们终于再度看到熟悉的景象
...we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.

1296
02:58:47,501 --> 02:58:50,197
我们回家了
We were home.

1297
02:58:56,744 --> 02:58:58,632
嗨
Hi.

1298
02:59:15,829 --> 02:59:18,024
小心我的南瓜
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1299
02:59:25,504 --> 02:59:27,547

晚安，各位
Good night, lads.

1302
03:00:54,510 --> 03:00:55,802
PIPPIN: Hm?

1303
03:01:07,441 --> 03:01:11,434
你该怎么重拾以往的生活？
FRODO: How do you pick up the threads of an old life?

1304
03:01:12,746 --> 03:01:14,976
你该怎么继续下去…
How do you go on...

1305
03:01:15,148 --> 03:01:20,347
当你在内心深处早就知道…
...when in your heart you begin to understand...

1306
03:01:21,622 --> 03:01:24,546
你已无法回头？
...there is no going back?

1307
03:01:25,259 --> 03:01:28,922
有些事情无法弥补…
There are some things that time cannot mend...

1308
03:01:29,463 --> 03:01:32,352
有些伤痛太深沉…
...some hurts that go too deep...

1309
03:01:34,134 --> 03:01:36,967
你将永远无法复元
...that have taken hold.

佛罗多？
Mr. Frodo?

1312
03:02:20,347 --> 03:02:21,712
怎么了？
What is it?

1313
03:02:23,550 --> 03:02:27,475
我在风云顶上被刺这一剑已经过了四年了
It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.

1314
03:02:28,188 --> 03:02:30,884
伤口还是没完全愈合
It's never really healed.

你写完了
You finished it.

1318
03:02:50,177 --> 03:02:51,701
还没有
FRODO: Not quite.

1319
03:02:52,512 --> 03:02:55,072
还有一些故事没写完
There's room for a little more.

1320
03:02:57,718 --> 03:03:01,916
比尔博曾说他的故事终会结束…
Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end...

1321
03:03:02,089 --> 03:03:05,388
每个人都有精采的一页
...that each of us must come and go in the telling.

1322
03:03:06,259 --> 03:03:09,092
他的故事已经结束
Bilbo's story was now over.

1323
03:03:09,596 --> 03:03:12,485
比尔博即将踏上…
There would be no more journeys for him...

1324
03:03:12,666 --> 03:03:14,224
最后的旅程
...save one.

1325
03:03:14,968 --> 03:03:18,529
再告诉我，我们要去哪儿？
BILBO [WEAKLY]: Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1326
03:03:18,705 --> 03:03:20,696
去港口呀
FRODO: To the harbor, Bilbo.

1327
03:03:20,874 --> 03:03:23,604
精灵赐给你最高的荣誉…
The Elves have accorded you a special honor...

1328
03:03:23,777 --> 03:03:26,405
跟他们一起搭船离开中土世界
...a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

1329
03:03:27,881 --> 03:03:30,111
佛罗多…
Frodo...

1330
03:03:31,184 --> 03:03:35,712
我能再见到那只戒指吗？
...any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?

1331
03:03:36,356 --> 03:03:39,018
我给你的那只戒指
The one I gave you.

1332
03:03:42,229 --> 03:03:44,390
对不起，叔叔
Sorry, Uncle.

1333
03:03:46,967 --> 03:03:49,561
我把它弄丢了
I'm afraid I lost it.

1334
03:03:49,736 --> 03:03:51,533
噢
Oh.

1335
03:03:51,972 --> 03:03:54,133
真可惜
Pity.

1336
03:03:56,376 --> 03:04:00,233
我很想再持有它最后一次
I should like to have held it one last time.

1337
03:04:25,095 --> 03:04:26,554
Oh!

1338
03:04:29,409 --> 03:04:34,437
我没见过这么大的场面
Well, here's a sight I have never seen before.

1339
03:04:48,662 --> 03:04:51,961
精灵族的三只魔戒力量已消失
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1340
03:04:52,766 --> 03:04:55,564
人类统治的时代…
The time has come...

1341
03:04:55,735 --> 03:04:59,034
已经来临
...for the dominion of Men.

1342

大海在召唤我们回家
[IN ELVISH]

1343
03:05:11,418 --> 03:05:13,579
我想…
I think I'm...

1344
03:05:13,753 --> 03:05:18,110
我准备好再踏上另一场冒险之旅
...quite ready for another adventure.

1345
03:05:49,189 --> 03:05:51,487
再会吧…
Farewell...

我的任务已经完成
My work is now finished.

1348
03:06:02,035 --> 03:06:07,166
在这大海的岸边…
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...

1349
03:06:07,841 --> 03:06:10,674
魔戒远征队终于解散了
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1350
03:06:14,214 --> 03:06:16,739
我不会叫你们不要哭…
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1351
03:06:17,384 --> 03:06:21,411
因为有些泪水是好的
...for not all tears are an evil.

1352
03:06:38,738 --> 03:06:40,865
该走了，佛罗多
It is time, Frodo.

1353
03:06:46,179 --> 03:06:48,909
他是什么意思？
SAM: What does he mean?

1354
03:06:50,884 --> 03:06:53,739
我们的任务是拯救夏尔
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1355
03:06:55,355 --> 03:06:58,085
夏尔安然无恙
And it has been saved.

1356
03:07:01,795 --> 03:07:04,423
但我不能留下来
But not for me.

1357
03:07:05,365 --> 03:07:07,856
你不是说真的
You don't mean that.

1358
03:07:09,035 --> 03:07:11,128
你不能走
You can't leave.

最后几页是留给你的，山姆
The last pages are for you, Sam.

亲爱的山姆：
FRODO: My dear Sam:

1361
03:11:00,166 --> 03:11:03,499
你不能一心两用
You cannot always be torn in two.

1362
03:11:03,670 --> 03:11:07,800
你必须全心全意为家庭奉献
You will have to be one and whole for many years.

You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do.

1364
03:11:15,281 --> 03:11:19,012
你在故事中的角色将继续下去
Your part in the story will go on.

1365
03:11:19,185 --> 03:11:21,312
好了…
Well...

1366
03:11:22,555 --> 03:11:25,115
我回家了

赶走你一身的疲备
Your sweet and weary head

安睡吧
Sleep now

1373

作梦吧，让你以前做过的梦
And dream Of the ones who came before

越过遥远的海岸

召唤着你
From across The distant shore

1376
03:13:49,469 --> 03:13:54,702
你为何哭泣？
Why do you weep?

1377
03:13:54,874 --> 03:13:59,834
你的脸上为什么流下晶莹泪珠？
What are these tears Upon your face?

1378
03:14:00,013 --> 03:14:05,076

消失在漆黑的夜晚
Into the world of night

海上出现一道光芒
A light on the water

1415

灰色帆船驶过
