1
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:35,025
THE BLOOD ROSE

2
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,671
THE PAST...

3
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:20,405
In an ancestral manor house,
two men reflect on their past

4
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:25,181
They await a doctor's verdict

5
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,733
The gallery was packed.
Frederic Lansac was a star artist

6
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,609
Frederic and I were co-owners
of a health club

7
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:56,178
And an art gallery, where
I was the master ofceremonies

8
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,351
Moira...

9
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,412
It all began with her...

10
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,383
My dear Moira

11
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,655
- Where've you been?
- Travelling...

12
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,664
l simply had to see lndia

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,268
My God! Such suffering
and poverty

14
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,699
Yes, how terrible

15
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,836
But you bring all the charms
of Paris

16
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,502
And you all its flattery

17
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,778
Oh, Albert!
Please say yes...

18
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,511
Just think of it...

19
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,279
A Lansac
in our living room

20
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,816
Please, Albert...

21
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,558
We'll take the Lansac.
My wife really likes it

22
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,257
A good choice

23
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,162
-A good investment, too
- Really...

24
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,768
Can you deal with this?

25
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,436
- How can l meet him?
- Who?

26
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,872
Lansac, of course.
You're good friends

27
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,709
Not right now.
He's preparing a new exhibition...

28
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,248
That big canvas...
ls it still for sale?

29
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,176
You like it?

30
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,988
Maybe.
lt'll suit my new decor

31
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,553
Now, about Lansac...

32
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,329
Lansac...

33
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,800
It didn't take her long
to get what she wanted

34
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,263
Anew lover to boast about
to her friends

35
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,103
Someone who filled
the gossip columns

36
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:32,971
Lansac the great

37
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,547
Lansac the genius

38
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,082
Lansac the decadent

39
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,070
Stop fidgeting, for God's sake!
l can't work like this

40
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,541
You didn't complain last night

41
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,437
No, the one from Renoma

42
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:12,211
Anne?
Yes, l've been back two months

43
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,944
l'm having a party on Friday

44
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,884
You can meet Frederic Lansac

45
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,923
Yes, the painter

46
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,219
You know
l like famous people

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,230
Come as a marquise.
You'll look great

48
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,336
He must have finished by now

49
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,512
This waiting is unbearable.
I must know

50
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,248
I accepted the invitation
and hired a costume

51
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,216
That was how I met Anne

52
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,422
Anne, who became...

53
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,196
Anne, whom I loved at once

54
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,672
We forgot about Moira's party.
We wanted to be alone

55
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,004
I'd never felt like this before

56
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,232
l love these films

57
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,863
The Vampires, all that blood...
Wonderful!

58
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,972
Where's your Frederic?

59
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,169
These artists are always late

60
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,205
Yes, it's me

61
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:20,810
lmpossible

62
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,510
l have work to finish

63
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,951
Another one
for your private museum

64
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,689
l've told you l can't

65
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,066
Apologise to your guests

66
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,016
I left my old life behind

67
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,721
I thought only of Anne

68
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,191
She became my muse

69
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,291
Inspired my best work

70
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,431
I felt real love
for the first time in my life

71
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,972
We left for the country
where I owned a chateau

72
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,141
I wished to surprise her

73
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,870
Private Property.
Keep Out. No Trespassers

74
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,685
Baron Frederic de Lansac...
17 12 to 1786

75
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,120
My great, great, great, great
grandfather

76
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:29,952
- He was a baron?
- Yes...

77
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,657
But my great great grandfather
was a gambler

78
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,564
He lost the title in a dice game

79
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,363
A shame. Baroness Anne de Lansac
sounds good

80
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,834
- You grew up here?
- Yes

81
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,241
Until my parents died

82
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,405
Left to myself,
l decided to travel

83
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,377
- You knew Wilfried then?
- No

84
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:56,812
l was in Brazil. He had a conference
about tropical plants

85
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,490
l was his only audience

86
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,616
- You were interested in plants
- Not at all

87
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,995
l just wanted to speak French

88
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,728
By the time we finished talking
l'd begun to share his obsession

89
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,959
The next day we left for Paris

90
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,334
The rest is history...

91
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:14,871
ls there a ghost?

92
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,906
l think he's asleep right now

93
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,983
l want to live here

94
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,928
You'd soon get bored.
There's no life here

95
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,994
l don't need anyone else.
Please...

96
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:50,171
Welcome, Madame
to your domain

97
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,911
l'll tell the ghost the good news

98
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,697
Don't be scared

99
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,540
There's nothing to fear

100
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,206
They've lived here years

101
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,338
My parents took them in

102
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,311
When l left here
l told them they could stay

103
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,149
l forgot about them

104
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,775
Who knows where they're from

105
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:39,590
My father found them in the village,
some boys were mocking them

106
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,350
He decided
to look after them

107
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,491
What are they called?

108
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,361
lgor and Olaf

109
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,664
l'll tell them to go
before we move in

110
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,060
Yes, please do...

111
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,564
No...Frederic, they can stay

112
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,703
They just scared me

113
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,222
Beautiful Anne

114
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,434
Hurry, hurry...
I must know

115
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:30,032
After our wedding,
we threw a huge party

116
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:35,270
The climax was to be
a grand sound and light show

117
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,122
Come on...

118
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,057
Our guests are here

119
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,401
Don't move, Anna.
You were never prettier

120
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,979
l feel pretty in your arms

121
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,478
l've never been happier

122
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,752
So happy that sometimes
it scares me

123
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,895
- Afraid that something...
- Nothing and nobody

124
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,825
can destroy our happiness

125
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,697
Nobody!

126
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,378
Mr Lansac, please!

127
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,685
l guess you forgot to invite me
to the party

128
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,720
Well, you're here now

129
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,190
- And l'm glad you are
- Don't touch me

130
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,164
Moira was furious

131
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,467
Anne backed away from her

132
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,432
Then it happened...

133
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,639
Look out, Anne!

134
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:44,839
Look out!!

135
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,800
lt's a miracle she's still alive

136
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,608
She's suffered severe burns

137
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,140
She'll never walk again

138
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,119
Her eyesight
aill be severely impaired

139
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,487
And her face...

140
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,450
Her face...

141
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,024
ls badly disfigured

142
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,587
She'll wake up soon

143
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,100
THE PRESENT...

144
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,105
The manor has become a tomb

145
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,336
Anne Lansac
had her death announced

146
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,740
Frederic is a broken man

147
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,779
The time of suffering
begins...

148
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:08,578
lt was a terrible shock for Frederic,
losing his aife like that

149
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,408
Such a beautiful woman

150
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,643
Very beautiful

151
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,715
Now he's shut himself away
from the world

152
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,691
- l hope you'll enjoy it here, Mr...?
- Romer

153
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,065
Careful!

154
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,404
That plant is very dangerous!

155
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,401
Come on, l'm listening

156
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,679
Get on with it

157
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,741
Frederic, pull yourself together

158
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,382
Frederic, make an effort

159
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,322
l know it's tough, but...

160
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,357
What's the point?

161
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,355
There's no Frederic

162
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,163
Frederic's dead!!

163
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,432
Lansac...
The great Lansac

164
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,159
He can't even hold a brush

165
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,033
Can't mix a color

166
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,167
Can't paint his wife.
Because you don't paint monsters!

167
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,123
l need you

168
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,529
l'm going away for a while.
You must run things

169
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,266
Romer...?

170
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,261
l don't really trust him yet

171
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,031
Anyway, you're my partner...

172
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,731
l can't leave Anne

173
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,234
l'll get a nurse
to live here

174
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,641
lmpossible.
People think she's dead

175
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,216
She wants
to see no-one

176
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,045
lt'll be fine

177
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,249
She won't talk

178
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,387
She'll never agree

179
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,220
You can't spend all your life
in this room

180
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,426
Locked up in this castle
with a wife who...

181
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,298
Look what you've become.
You need to get away

182
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,285
l leave tomorrow morning.
l'll see you at the club before l go

183
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,972
Take this plant
to Mr Lansac's car

184
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,638
Be careful,
it's highly dangerous

185
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,042
- What is it?
- A new hybrid

186
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,847
Mr Lansac's
not named it yet

187
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:44,114
He wants to study it at home
before we use it

188
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,757
The thorns
at the heart of this plant

189
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,386
secrete a deadly poison

190
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,036
Hello, Anne

191
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,161
You're back then?

192
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,770
Yes...

193
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,876
Olaf... Olaf!

194
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,645
Don't touch that plant

195
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,880
See those thorns
in the centre?

196
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,018
One touch and you die

197
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,950
Understand? You die

198
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,452
Pick it up

199
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,749
Take it to the plant room

200
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,960
And warn lgor

201
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,753
Careful, now

202
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,068
That's right

203
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,118
There....

204
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,655
- lt's done
- Just makes me feel worse

205
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:29,919
But, Madame...

206
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,460
Get out! Leave me alone

207
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,825
-Anything else...?
- Yes! Get out!

208
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,471
l hate that girl.
Get rid of her

209
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:43,741
You're upset

210
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,767
You want her.
So go and console her

211
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,642
-Anne...
- Stop it! Don't touch me

212
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,515
- But why?...
- Go on, run after her!

213
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,196
Why does she hate me so?

214
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,970
She doesn't hate you, Agnes.
lt's what you represent

215
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,368
Her lost beauty

216
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,406
Give it time

217
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,311
lt's hard for her

218
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,281
We have no idea

219
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,116
She's lost everything

220
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,918
Everything...

221
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,281
Yes, Madame?

222
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,473
l'm sorry about yesterday.
l was hateful

223
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:26,014
- lt's all right
- My husband says l was very unfair

224
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,454
lt's just my job

225
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,087
No, he's right.
lt won't happen again

226
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,398
Dear Agnes...
so sweet, so pretty

227
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,533
What a strange plant

228
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,895
l never saw one like it

229
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,305
My husband brought it here.
lt's very rare

230
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,409
Could you water it for me,
please

231
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:54,377
Move the leaves.
The water must get right inside

232
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,614
The leaves aren't delicate

233
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,290
Yes, there

234
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:08,298
Agnes...
So sweet, so pretty!

235
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,671
l would have attended
your wife's funeral, but...

236
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,610
lt's alright.
l wanted no-one there

237
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:31,015
l feel for you.
She was so pretty

238
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,518
A fascinating face

239
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,919
Fascinating, indeed

240
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,207
She was coming between us.
She had to die

241
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,074
l killed her to save our love

242
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:32,510
Frederic, l couldn't bear
to see her face... her body

243
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,418
She was beautiful...
Too beautiful

244
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,709
- Yes sir?
- Professor Romer

245
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,181
- He's in the solarium
- l'll find him

246
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:19,578
You have to do it!
The police are after me...

247
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,985
- So when can you operate?
- Not so loud

248
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,648
This evening

249
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,959
Don't come here again.
lt's too dangerous

250
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,040
There...The mould is ready

251
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,474
l'll operate Friday evening

252
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,843
- That institute's a good cover...
- Shut up!

253
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,148
Come back Friday evening

254
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,948
Very interesting, Mr Romer

255
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,585
- You heard it all?
- Yes

256
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,618
A risky hobby you have

257
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,893
The law might be very interested
in your amateur...

258
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:49,629
surgery

259
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,868
- l can explain
- Explain what?

260
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,964
That you're using my place
as a cover

261
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:59,233
That nice Mr Romer
who looks after plants is really...

262
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,772
...nothing but a damn butcher

263
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:07,040
You are risking my reputation
for your trade in human flesh

264
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,882
lt won't do, Romer.
lt won't do at all

265
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,619
- l trusted you...
- Please, let me explain

266
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:22,489
The word ''butcher''
hurts me

267
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,860
l was a famous surgeon

268
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,270
l saved many people's lives

269
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,703
l had one passion

270
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,908
The face...

271
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:43,413
The human face has always had
a strange attraction for me

272
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:49,155
lt's miraculous symmetries
fascinate me

273
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,120
The lines... the shapes...

274
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,363
The texture, the colors

275
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,932
Twelve years ago,
in tragic circumstances

276
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,301
l had to operate on a child's face

277
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,641
l should never have done it

278
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,575
But l saw it as
a new experience

279
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,616
The operation failed

280
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:23,152
The parents lodged a complaint.
l was found guilty and sent to prison

281
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,926
When l came out,
l was finished

282
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,791
A man who knew nothing
but surgery but...

283
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,268
...had no right to practice it

284
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,238
One day...

285
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:40,208
l agreed to operate on the face
of a man l knewfrom prison

286
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,275
A man who was
wanted by the police

287
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,272
And before long

288
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,009
l acquired a certain reputation

289
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,756
A few months later l decided
to put an end to all that

290
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,059
and fade into the shadows

291
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,491
Then your partner
offered me this position

292
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,530
A chance to be clear of my past

293
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:08,661
And then this man turns up
threatening to expose me

294
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,470
l was stuck

295
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,439
And now, Mr Lansac...

296
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,137
do your duty as a good citizen

297
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,312
We're leaving

298
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,221
Leaving? For where?

299
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,453
To my chateau

300
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,492
To meet someone

301
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,663
Someone who'll be delighted
to meet you

302
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:38,698
My wife

303
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,659
l can do nothing.
The tissue is gone

304
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,729
l brought you here
to find a solution

305
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,225
There is no way.
l can do nothing

306
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,697
There's one possibility,
but science isn't ready for it

307
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,746
lf we had a complete face
of living tissue

308
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,773
lt would kill the donor

309
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,446
lt's impossible

310
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,518
Unthinkable

311
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:36,459
lt would mean cutting the face
off a living woman

312
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,954
lt's too horrible

313
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:39,989
lt's impossible

314
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:45,158
No... No.
lt's impossible

315
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:46,833
lsn't it...?

316
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,839
You can't... No,
it's monstrous

317
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,500
lsn't it...?

318
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,743
THE FUTURE?

319
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,914
The face of a living woman...

320
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,048
The idea grew in the mind
of a madman

321
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,583
Thus began the search
for a future victim

322
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,575
Until one day...!

323
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:22,853
My Dear Agnes...

324
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,891
It's been a long time
since we heard from you

325
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,827
I hope you are enjoying
your newjob

326
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:37,032
Just a few lines to let you know
Paul and I are getting married

327
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:43,239
I hope you will find the time
to come and see us

328
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:44,941
I miss you a lot

329
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,213
I can't wait to hear from you

330
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,915
Paul sends his love

331
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,747
Your loving sister,
Barbara

332
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,887
You must reply

333
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,788
Say that her sister has left...

334
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,690
Still staring at that letter?

335
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,062
Why shouldn't she have
gone travelling?

336
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,770
lt's not like her

337
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,200
She's not the adventurous type

338
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,804
''Your sister left a week ago...''

339
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,405
''Some friends of ours
needed a nurse...''

340
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,709
''...to travel to Japan with them''

341
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,610
No, Paul. Not Agnes

342
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,915
Don't worry

343
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:29,186
Tomorrow you'll get a post card
from... Tokyo

344
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:33,955
l'm going there

345
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,127
Japan?

346
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,626
No! To the chateau
where she worked

347
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,928
You'll look silly

348
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,526
Really, your honor?

349
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:46,133
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
can you really blame

350
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,008
this poor abandoned child...?

351
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,112
You can go, l'll lock up

352
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,158
Thank you.
Good night, sir

353
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:10,562
Romer?

354
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,592
We're going now.
Fetch her

355
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,950
Please don't scream.
l won't hurt you

356
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,021
l don't trust Romer

357
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,060
- l don't think he'll do it
- He has no choice

358
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,968
Believe me, it'll be all right

359
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:38,833
l want to see this girl.
Bring her to me

360
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:40,539
Now?.

361
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:46,448
l want to be sure about her...
Her face

362
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:47,907
Her beauty

363
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,657
Go get her

364
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,305
You killed her!
You killed her!

365
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,842
You want me to be a monster,
like you!

366
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,350
Please come in

367
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:05,186
What's wrong?
You seem afraid

368
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:09,531
l heard something in the woods.
An animal, l suppose

369
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,595
l'm a bit suggestive

370
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,300
Come in
and sit by the fire

371
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,768
To what do l owe
my good fortune...

372
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:21,334
to have a such a pretty guest
in this sinister chateau?

373
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:24,378
l was researching
a guide to the area

374
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,481
And l was hoping
to write something about this place

375
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,391
Your room is ready

376
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,631
You live here alone?

377
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:49,200
Yes

378
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:52,565
My wife died in an accident

379
01:01:56,946 --> 01:02:01,246
The elements have conspired
to trap you here

380
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,880
So it seems

381
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,188
Now l'll have to stay

382
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,214
Some more wine?

383
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,540
They're just my servants

384
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,646
You'll get used to them

385
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:40,289
l'll show you the chateau
tomorrow

386
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:47,025
Come...
l'll show you your room

387
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:48,259
Come

388
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:17,022
l've grown used to the solitude

389
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:21,885
After my wife's death
l thought to move away, but...

390
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,497
What's that noise?

391
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:26,759
The storm...?

392
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,268
That room's been empty
a long time

393
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:32,863
Far too long

394
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,038
- lt was my aife's room
- l'm sorry

395
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,515
Here's your room

396
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,086
l hope the storm
won't keep you awake

397
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:54,895
Good night

398
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,215
That room's been empty
a long time

399
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,725
It was my wife's room

400
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:51,983
Agnes...?

401
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:57,054
Agnes?

402
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,170
Who are you?

403
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:12,674
Where's Agnes?

404
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,633
- Where's my sister?
- l killed her

405
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,903
Because she was pretty
and l'm not

406
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,109
Now you will give me
your face

407
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:24,853
All is ready

408
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,515
And you won't really die,
you'll live in me

409
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,569
Hans Romer?

410
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:11,809
Yes

411
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,749
Professor Hans Romer?

412
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,847
- l'm no longer...
- Sorry, l forgot...

413
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,215
- You've been struck off
- Who are you?

414
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:23,953
Why these questions?

415
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,825
Of course.
Sorry, Professor....

416
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:28,991
Chief lnspector Dorsay

417
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,140
- Do you knowthis man?
- No

418
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,265
No?
And this one?

419
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,271
- No
- Really?

420
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:47,807
Look closer.
See a similarity?

421
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:52,184
lt's the same man.
Before and after...

422
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:54,788
l already told you
l don't know these men

423
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,055
This man

424
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,148
His face was altered

425
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:00,661
By a great specialist

426
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,563
A very great specialist

427
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,563
Come on, Professor

428
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:10,805
- l already told you, l'm not...
- l know, l know

429
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:15,439
But your skill,
that remains

430
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:19,407
You operated on this man

431
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:24,110
Since my conviction l never
touched a scalpel

432
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:25,711
My life has changed

433
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,945
l've no connections
with the past

434
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:33,157
Don't you think l've paid enough,
lnspector?

435
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,058
All right

436
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:39,032
This is just a...
routine visit

437
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:43,397
The man in the photo
was arrested last week

438
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,133
But something was wrong.
His prints didn't match

439
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,475
His face was different

440
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,570
There were still scars

441
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:56,176
And so you thought of
the awful Dr Romer

442
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:57,452
The torturer

443
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,912
The man who carves up children

444
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:02,090
The pervert

445
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:07,018
l understand how you feel.
But l'm just doing my job

446
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:12,563
A human cog in a complex
electronic machine

447
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:17,296
A face remade.
Punch a button...

448
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:20,236
and a few seconds later,
out comes a little card

449
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:21,809
With my name on

450
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:22,940
Correct

451
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:24,703
lt's the new way

452
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:29,015
One day the machine will
ask the questions too

453
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,190
Yes, it's me

454
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:40,893
Get here at once

455
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,727
We operate tonight

456
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,162
That's impossible

457
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:47,131
l can't

458
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:52,800
- l told you, it's impossible
- You have no choice

459
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,677
l'm sure the police
aill be interested...

460
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,873
Yes, l understand....
Yes, l will

461
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,040
See you later

462
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,216
Problems?

463
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:10,157
- Hope it wasn't serious
- Not at all

464
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:13,323
Some plants are arriving
at the institute

465
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:17,464
l have to get down there
to check that things are all right

466
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,325
Shall l come aith you?

467
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,669
No, that's quite all right

468
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:24,133
We can talk again later

469
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,467
Unless l'm under arrest?

470
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,334
Very funny, Professor

471
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:33,776
l told you,
this was just a routine call

472
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,918
l look forward
to talking again later

473
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,419
lt's all right.
l'll see myself out

474
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:58,194
Tonight...

475
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,468
Romer's here.
He's getting ready

476
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,634
l'm scared

477
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,578
What if it doesn't work?

478
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,575
l'd rather die
than stay like this

479
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,545
You must help me die

480
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,710
Stop this.
You'll live, Anne

481
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:13,377
You'll be beautiful

482
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:17,549
We'll go away and forget all this.
lt'll be just a bad dream

483
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,462
And l will be your wife again.
Kiss me, Frederic

484
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:26,630
Kiss me

485
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:47,579
Soon l'll be able
to look at myself again

486
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,715
Soon my pain aill be over

487
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:52,210
Beautiful...

488
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,818
l want no more monsters here

489
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:59,790
Burn all those black dresses!
l never want to see them again

490
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:03,125
l want only bright clothes.
Worthy of my beauty

491
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:16,367
Frederic you'll learn
to love me again

492
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,373
To desire me

493
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,578
l will be desirable again

494
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:56,913
No chance.
There's no chance this will work

495
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:01,553
This poor girl will die pointlessly

496
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,990
I'm caught in a hellish trap

497
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,993
On one side
that damned policeman

498
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,855
On the other,
this monstrous couple

499
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,566
Sleep....

500
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,364
The drugs are working

501
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,103
What monstrous dreams
she must be having

502
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:27,774
No, l beg you...

503
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,156
Please, have pity

504
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,997
lsn't the death
of two women enough?

505
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:58,377
You're not like them.
They are evil

506
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:01,148
l beg you, let me go

507
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,087
Please! l want to live...

508
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:19,583
lt's all over

509
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,681
l'll be like this forever

510
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:26,417
That's what you wanted

511
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,689
You and your monsters

512
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:30,993
lt's you who killed Romer

513
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,267
You feared my beauty

514
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,233
l'll kill you for what you've done!
Kill you!

515
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,499
You're happy now it's failed

516
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,546
Take me away from here!
Take me away

517
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:48,939
You want me
to be a monster like you

518
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:51,852
Take me away

519
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:32,966
What's going on, Barbara?

520
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,507
What's happened here?
Where's Agnes?

521
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:37,233
Let's go! Now!

522
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:28,521
l've just killed my aife
and my servants

523
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:35,259
There's a woman
buried here too

524
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:42,901
That's right.
The Lansac chateau
