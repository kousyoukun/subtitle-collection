1
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:35,326
THE BLOOD ROSE

2
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,971
THE PAST...

3
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,705
In an ancestral manor house,
two men reflect on their past

4
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,481
They await a doctor's verdict

5
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:48,033
The gallery was packed.
Frederic Lansac was a star artist

6
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,909
Frederic and I were co-owners
of a health club

7
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,479
And an art gallery, where
I was the master ofceremonies

8
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,652
Moira...

9
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,713
It all began with her...

10
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,683
My dear Moira

11
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,956
- Where've you been?
- Travelling...

12
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,964
l simply had to see lndia

13
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,568
My God! Such suffering
and poverty

14
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes, how terrible

15
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,137
But you bring all the charms
of Paris

16
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,803
And you all its flattery

17
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,079
Oh, Albert!
Please say yes...

18
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,811
Just think of it...

19
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,579
A Lansac
in our living room

20
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,117
Please, Albert...

21
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,858
We'll take the Lansac.
My wife really likes it

22
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,558
A good choice

23
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,462
-A good investment, too
- Really...

24
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,068
Can you deal with this?

25
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,736
- How can l meet him?
- Who?

26
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,172
Lansac, of course.
You're good friends

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,009
Not right now.
He's preparing a new exhibition...

28
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,548
That big canvas...
ls it still for sale?

29
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,476
You like it?

30
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:11,288
Maybe.
lt'll suit my new decor

31
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,854
Now, about Lansac...

32
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,630
Lansac...

33
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:25,100
It didnt take her long
to get what she wanted

34
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,563
Anew lover to boast about
to her friends

35
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,403
Someone who filled
the gossip columns

36
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,271
Lansac the great

37
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,847
Lansac the genius

38
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,382
Lansac the decadent

39
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,370
Stop fidgeting, for God's sake!
l can't work like this

40
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,841
You didn't complain last night

41
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,737
No, the one from Renoma

42
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,512
Anne?
Yes, l've been back two months

43
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,244
l'm having a party on Friday

44
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,184
You can meet Frederic Lansac

45
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,223
Yes, the painter

46
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,519
You know
l like famous people

47
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,530
Come as a marquise.
You'll look great

48
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,636
He must have finished by now

49
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,812
This waiting is unbearable.
I must know

50
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,548
I accepted the invitation
and hired a costume

51
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,516
That was how I met Anne

52
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,722
Anne, who became...

53
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,497
Anne, whom I loved at once

54
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:11,972
We forgot about Moira's party.
We wanted to be alone

55
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,304
I'd never felt like this before

56
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,532
l love these films

57
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:43,164
The Vampires, all that blood...
Wonderful!

58
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,272
Where's your Frederic?

59
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,469
These artists are always late

60
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,505
Yes, it's me

61
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,110
lmpossible

62
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,810
l have work to finish

63
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,251
Another one
for your private museum

64
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,989
l've told you l can't

65
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,367
Apologise to your guests

66
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,316
I left my old life behind

67
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,022
I thought only of Anne

68
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,491
She became my muse

69
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,592
Inspired my best work

70
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,732
I felt real love
for the first time in my life

71
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:56,273
We left for the country
where I owned a chateau

72
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,442
I wished to surprise her

73
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:03,170
Private Property.
Keep Out. No Trespassers

74
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,985
Baron Frederic de Lansac...
17 12 to 1786

75
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,420
My great, great, great, great
grandfather

76
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,252
- He was a baron?
- Yes...

77
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,958
But my great great grandfather
was a gambler

78
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,864
He lost the title in a dice game

79
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,664
A shame. Baroness Anne de Lansac
sounds good

80
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,135
- You grew up here?
- Yes

81
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,541
Until my parents died

82
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,705
Left to myself,
l decided to travel

83
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,677
- You knew Wilfried then?
- No

84
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:57,112
l was in Brazil. He had a conference
about tropical plants

85
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,790
l was his only audience

86
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,916
- You were interested in plants
- Not at all

87
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,295
l just wanted to speak French

88
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,029
By the time we finished talking
l'd begun to share his obsession

89
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,259
The next day we left for Paris

90
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,634
The rest is history...

91
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,172
ls there a ghost?

92
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,206
l think he's asleep right now

93
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,283
l want to live here

94
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,228
You'd soon get bored.
There's no life here

95
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,294
l don't need anyone else.
Please...

96
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,472
Welcome, Madame
to your domain

97
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,212
l'll tell the ghost the good news

98
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,997
Don't be scared

99
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,840
There's nothing to fear

100
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,506
They've lived here years

101
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,638
My parents took them in

102
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,611
When l left here
l told them they could stay

103
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,449
l forgot about them

104
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,076
Who knows where they're from

105
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,890
My father found them in the village,
some boys were mocking them

106
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,650
He decided
to look after them

107
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,791
What are they called?

108
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,662
lgor and Olaf

109
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,964
l'll tell them to go
before we move in

110
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,360
Yes, please do...

111
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,864
No...Frederic, they can stay

112
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,003
They just scared me

113
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,522
Beautiful Anne

114
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,734
Hurry, hurry...
I must know

115
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,333
After our wedding,
we threw a huge party

116
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,570
The climax was to be
a grand sound and light show

117
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,422
Come on...

118
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,357
Our guests are here

119
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,701
Don't move, Anna.
You were never prettier

120
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,279
l feel pretty in your arms

121
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,778
l've never been happier

122
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,053
So happy that sometimes
it scares me

123
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,195
- Afraid that something...
- Nothing and nobody

124
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,125
can destroy our happiness

125
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:29,997
Nobody!

126
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,678
Mr Lansac, please!

127
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,985
l guess you forgot to invite me
to the party

128
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,020
Well, you're here now

129
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,491
- And l'm glad you are
- Don't touch me

130
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,465
Moira was furious

131
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,767
Anne backed away from her

132
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,732
Then it happened...

133
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:42,939
Look out, Anne!

134
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,139
Look out!!

135
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,100
lt's a miracle she's still alive

136
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,908
She's suffered severe burns

137
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,440
She'll never walk again

138
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,420
Her eyesight
will be severely impaired

139
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,788
And her face...

140
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:06,750
Her face...

141
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,325
ls badly disfigured

142
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,887
She'll wake up soon

143
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,400
THE PRESENT...

144
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,406
The manor has become a tomb

145
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,636
Anne Lansac
had her death announced

146
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,040
Frederic is a broken man

147
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,080
The time of suffering
begins...

148
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:08,878
lt was a terrible shock for Frederic,
losing his wife like that

149
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,709
Such a beautiful woman

150
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:13,943
Very beautiful

151
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,016
Now he's shut himself away
from the world

152
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,991
- l hope you'll enjoy it here, Mr...?
- Romer

153
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,365
Careful!

154
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,705
That plant is very dangerous!

155
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,702
Come on, l'm listening

156
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,979
Get on with it

157
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,041
Frederic, pull yourself together

158
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,682
Frederic, make an effort

159
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,623
l know it's tough, but...

160
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,657
What's the point?

161
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,656
There's no Frederic

162
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,463
Frederic's dead!!

163
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,732
Lansac...
The great Lansac

164
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,459
He can't even hold a brush

165
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,333
Can't mix a color

166
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,467
Can't paint his wife.
Because you don't paint monsters!

167
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,423
l need you

168
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,829
l'm going away for a while.
You must run things

169
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,566
Romer...?

170
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,562
l don't really trust him yet

171
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,331
Anyway, you're my partner...

172
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,031
l can't leave Anne

173
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,534
l'll get a nurse
to live here

174
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,942
lmpossible.
People think she's dead

175
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,517
She wants
to see no-one

176
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,346
lt'll be fine

177
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,550
She won't talk

178
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,687
She'll never agree

179
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,520
You can't spend all your life
in this room

180
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,726
Locked up in this castle
with a wife who...

181
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:54,599
Look what you've become.
You need to get away

182
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:08,585
l leave tomorrow morning.
l'll see you at the club before l go

183
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,272
Take this plant
to Mr Lansac's car

184
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,938
Be careful,
it's highly dangerous

185
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,342
- What is it?
- A new hybrid

186
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,147
Mr Lansac's
not named it yet

187
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,414
He wants to study it at home
before we use it

188
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,057
The thorns
at the heart of this plant

189
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,686
secrete a deadly poison

190
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,336
Hello, Anne

191
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,462
You're back then?

192
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,070
Yes...

193
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,176
Olaf... Olaf!

194
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,946
Don't touch that plant

195
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,180
See those thorns
in the centre?

196
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,319
One touch and you die

197
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,251
Understand? You die

198
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:52,753
Pick it up

199
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,050
Take it to the plant room

200
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,260
And warn lgor

201
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,053
Careful, now

202
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,368
That's right

203
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,419
There....

204
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,955
- lt's done
- Just makes me feel worse

205
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,220
But, Madame...

206
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,760
Get out! Leave me alone

207
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,125
-Anything else...?
- Yes! Get out!

208
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,771
l hate that girl.
Get rid of her

209
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,041
You're upset

210
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,068
You want her.
So go and console her

211
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,942
-Anne...
- Stop it! Don't touch me

212
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,816
- But why?...
- Go on, run after her!

213
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,497
Why does she hate me so?

214
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:48,270
She doesn't hate you, Agnes.
lt's what you represent

215
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,668
Her lost beauty

216
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,706
Give it time

217
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,611
lt's hard for her

218
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,581
We have no idea

219
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,417
She's lost everything

220
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,219
Everything...

221
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:17,581
Yes, Madame?

222
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,774
l'm sorry about yesterday.
l was hateful

223
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:26,314
- lt's all right
- My husband says l was very unfair

224
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,754
lt's just my job

225
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,388
No, he's right.
lt won't happen again

226
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,699
Dear Agnes...
so sweet, so pretty

227
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,833
What a strange plant

228
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,195
l never saw one like it

229
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,606
My husband brought it here.
lt's very rare

230
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,710
Could you water it for me,
please

231
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,678
Move the leaves.
The water must get right inside

232
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,914
The leaves aren't delicate

233
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,590
Yes, there

234
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:08,598
Agnes...
So sweet, so pretty!

235
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,972
l would have attended
your wife's funeral, but...

236
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,911
lt's alright.
l wanted no-one there

237
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:31,315
l feel for you.
She was so pretty

238
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,818
A fascinating face

239
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,219
Fascinating, indeed

240
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,507
She was coming between us.
She had to die

241
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,374
l killed her to save our love

242
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:32,810
Frederic, l couldn't bear
to see her face... her body

243
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,718
She was beautiful...
Too beautiful

244
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,009
- Yes sir?
- Professor Romer

245
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,482
- He's in the solarium
- l'll find him

246
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:19,878
You have to do it!
The police are after me...

247
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,285
- So when can you operate?
- Not so loud

248
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,948
This evening

249
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:31,259
Don't come here again.
lt's too dangerous

250
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,340
There...The mould is ready

251
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,774
l'll operate Friday evening

252
00:36:56,013 --> 00:37:00,143
- That institute's a good cover...
- Shut up!

253
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,449
Come back Friday evening

254
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,248
Very interesting, Mr Romer

255
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,886
- You heard it all?
- Yes

256
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,918
A risky hobby you have

257
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,193
The law might be very interested
in your amateur...

258
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:49,929
surgery

259
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,168
- l can explain
- Explain what?

260
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,265
That you're using my place
as a cover

261
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,534
That nice Mr Romer
who looks after plants is really...

262
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,072
...nothing but a damn butcher

263
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,340
You are risking my reputation
for your trade in human flesh

264
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,183
lt won't do, Romer.
lt won't do at all

265
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,920
- l trusted you...
- Please, let me explain

266
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:22,789
The word ''butcher''
hurts me

267
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,161
l was a famous surgeon

268
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,571
l saved many people's lives

269
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,003
l had one passion

270
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,208
The face...

271
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:43,713
The human face has always had
a strange attraction for me

272
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:49,456
lt's miraculous symmetries
fascinate me

273
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,421
The lines... the shapes...

274
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,663
The texture, the colors

275
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,233
Twelve years ago,
in tragic circumstances

276
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,601
l had to operate on a child's face

277
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,941
l should never have done it

278
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:11,875
But l saw it as
a new experience

279
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,917
The operation failed

280
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:23,452
The parents lodged a complaint.
l was found guilty and sent to prison

281
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,226
When l came out,
l was finished

282
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,091
A man who knew nothing
but surgery but...

283
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,568
...had no right to practice it

284
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:36,538
One day...

285
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,508
l agreed to operate on the face
of a man l knewfrom prison

286
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,575
A man who was
wanted by the police

287
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,572
And before long

288
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,310
l acquired a certain reputation

289
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:54,057
A few months later l decided
to put an end to all that

290
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,359
and fade into the shadows

291
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,791
Then your partner
offered me this position

292
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,831
A chance to be clear of my past

293
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:08,961
And then this man turns up
threatening to expose me

294
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,770
l was stuck

295
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,740
And now, Mr Lansac...

296
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,437
do your duty as a good citizen

297
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:24,612
We're leaving

298
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,521
Leaving? For where?

299
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,753
To my chateau

300
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,792
To meet someone

301
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,963
Someone who'll be delighted
to meet you

302
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:38,998
My wife

303
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,959
l can do nothing.
The tissue is gone

304
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,030
l brought you here
to find a solution

305
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,525
There is no way.
l can do nothing

306
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,997
There's one possibility,
but science isn't ready for it

307
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,046
lf we had a complete face
of living tissue

308
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,074
lt would kill the donor

309
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,746
lt's impossible

310
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,818
Unthinkable

311
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,759
lt would mean cutting the face
off a living woman

312
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,255
lt's too horrible

313
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,289
lt's impossible

314
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:45,458
No... No.
lt's impossible

315
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,133
lsn't it...?

316
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:52,139
You can't... No,
it's monstrous

317
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:53,800
lsn't it...?

318
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,043
THE FUTURE?

319
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,214
The face of a living woman...

320
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,348
The idea grew in the mind
of a madman

321
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,883
Thus began the search
for a future victim

322
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:42,875
Until one day...!

323
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,154
My Dear Agnes...

324
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,191
It's been a long time
since we heard from you

325
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,128
I hope you are enjoying
your newjob

326
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:37,332
Just a few lines to let you know
Paul and I are getting married

327
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:43,539
I hope you will find the time
to come and see us

328
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,241
I miss you a lot

329
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,513
I can't wait to hear from you

330
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,215
Paul sends his love

331
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,047
Your loving sister,
Barbara

332
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,187
You must reply

333
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,088
Say that her sister has left...

334
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,990
Still staring at that letter?

335
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:07,362
Why shouldn't she have
gone travelling?

336
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,070
lt's not like her

337
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,500
She's not the adventurous type

338
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:16,104
''Your sister left a week ago...''

339
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,705
''Some friends of ours
needed a nurse...''

340
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,010
''...to travel to Japan with them''

341
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,910
No, Paul. Not Agnes

342
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,216
Don't worry

343
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:29,486
Tomorrow you'll get a post card
from... Tokyo

344
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,256
l'm going there

345
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:35,427
Japan?

346
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,927
No! To the chateau
where she worked

347
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,229
You'll look silly

348
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,826
Really, your honor?

349
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,434
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
can you really blame

350
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,308
this poor abandoned child...?

351
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,412
You can go, l'll lock up

352
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,459
Thank you.
Good night, sir

353
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:10,863
Romer?

354
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,893
We're going now.
Fetch her

355
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:11,250
Please don't scream.
l won't hurt you

356
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,321
l don't trust Romer

357
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:32,361
- l don't think he'll do it
- He has no choice

358
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,268
Believe me, it'll be all right

359
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:39,133
l want to see this girl.
Bring her to me

360
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:40,839
Now?.

361
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:46,748
l want to be sure about her...
Her face

362
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,207
Her beauty

363
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:04,957
Go get her

364
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,606
You killed her!
You killed her!

365
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:40,142
You want me to be a monster,
like you!

366
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,650
Please come in

367
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:05,487
What's wrong?
You seem afraid

368
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,832
l heard something in the woods.
An animal, l suppose

369
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:11,895
l'm a bit suggestive

370
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,600
Come in
and sit by the fire

371
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,069
To what do l owe
my good fortune...

372
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:21,634
to have a such a pretty guest
in this sinister chateau?

373
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,679
l was researching
a guide to the area

374
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,782
And l was hoping
to write something about this place

375
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:43,692
Your room is ready

376
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:46,932
You live here alone?

377
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,501
Yes

378
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:52,866
My wife died in an accident

379
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:01,546
The elements have conspired
to trap you here

380
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,180
So it seems

381
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:07,488
Now l'll have to stay

382
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,514
Some more wine?

383
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,841
They're just my servants

384
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,946
You'll get used to them

385
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:40,589
l'll show you the chateau
tomorrow

386
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:47,325
Come...
l'll show you your room

387
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,560
Come

388
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:17,322
l've grown used to the solitude

389
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:22,186
After my wife's death
l thought to move away, but...

390
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:23,797
What's that noise?

391
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,059
The storm...?

392
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:30,569
That room's been empty
a long time

393
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,164
Far too long

394
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:37,338
- lt was my wife's room
- l'm sorry

395
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:49,815
Here's your room

396
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,387
l hope the storm
won't keep you awake

397
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:55,195
Good night

398
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,516
That room's been empty
a long time

399
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,026
It was my wife's room

400
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,283
Agnes...?

401
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:57,355
Agnes?

402
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:11,470
Who are you?

403
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:12,974
Where's Agnes?

404
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,933
- Where's my sister?
- l killed her

405
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,204
Because she was pretty
and l'm not

406
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,409
Now you will give me
your face

407
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,153
All is ready

408
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,816
And you won't really die,
you'll live in me

409
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:10,870
Hans Romer?

410
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:12,109
Yes

411
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,049
Professor Hans Romer?

412
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,148
- l'm no longer...
- Sorry, l forgot...

413
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:21,515
- You've been struck off
- Who are you?

414
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,253
Why these questions?

415
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:27,125
Of course.
Sorry, Professor....

416
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,292
Chief lnspector Dorsay

417
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:39,440
- Do you knowthis man?
- No

418
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,565
No?
And this one?

419
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,571
- No
- Really?

420
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:48,107
Look closer.
See a similarity?

421
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:52,484
lt's the same man.
Before and after...

422
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,088
l already told you
l don't know these men

423
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,355
This man

424
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:58,449
His face was altered

425
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,962
By a great specialist

426
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:03,864
A very great specialist

427
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,864
Come on, Professor

428
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:11,105
- l already told you, l'm not...
- l know, l know

429
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,740
But your skill,
that remains

430
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:19,707
You operated on this man

431
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:24,410
Since my conviction l never
touched a scalpel

432
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,011
My life has changed

433
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,246
l've no connections
with the past

434
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:33,457
Don't you think l've paid enough,
lnspector?

435
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:34,358
All right

436
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:39,332
This is just a...
routine visit

437
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:43,697
The man in the photo
was arrested last week

438
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:47,433
But something was wrong.
His prints didn't match

439
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,775
His face was different

440
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:52,870
There were still scars

441
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:56,476
And so you thought of
the awful Dr Romer

442
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:57,752
The torturer

443
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:01,212
The man who carves up children

444
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:02,390
The pervert

445
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:07,318
l understand how you feel.
But l'm just doing my job

446
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:12,863
A human cog in a complex
electronic machine

447
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:17,597
A face remade.
Punch a button...

448
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:20,537
and a few seconds later,
out comes a little card

449
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:22,109
With my name on

450
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:23,240
Correct

451
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,003
lt's the new way

452
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:29,315
One day the machine will
ask the questions too

453
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:39,490
Yes, it's me

454
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,194
Get here at once

455
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,027
We operate tonight

456
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:44,462
That's impossible

457
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:47,431
l can't

458
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:53,101
- l told you, it's impossible
- You have no choice

459
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:56,977
l'm sure the police
will be interested...

460
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:03,174
Yes, l understand....
Yes, l will

461
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:04,341
See you later

462
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:06,517
Problems?

463
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:10,457
- Hope it wasn't serious
- Not at all

464
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:13,624
Some plants are arriving
at the institute

465
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:17,764
l have to get down there
to check that things are all right

466
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,625
Shall l come with you?

467
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,970
No, that's quite all right

468
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,434
We can talk again later

469
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:26,768
Unless l'm under arrest?

470
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,634
Very funny, Professor

471
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:34,076
l told you,
this was just a routine call

472
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:37,218
l look forward
to talking again later

473
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,719
lt's all right.
l'll see myself out

474
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,495
Tonight...

475
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,768
Romer's here.
He's getting ready

476
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:02,934
l'm scared

477
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:04,878
What if it doesn't work?

478
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,875
l'd rather die
than stay like this

479
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:09,845
You must help me die

480
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:12,010
Stop this.
You'll live, Anne

481
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:13,677
You'll be beautiful

482
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:17,849
We'll go away and forget all this.
lt'll be just a bad dream

483
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:22,762
And l will be your wife again.
Kiss me, Frederic

484
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:26,930
Kiss me

485
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:47,879
Soon l'll be able
to look at myself again

486
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,015
Soon my pain will be over

487
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:52,510
Beautiful...

488
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:56,118
l want no more monsters here

489
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,091
Burn all those black dresses!
l never want to see them again

490
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:03,425
l want only bright clothes.
Worthy of my beauty

491
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:16,668
Frederic you'll learn
to love me again

492
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,673
To desire me

493
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,879
l will be desirable again

494
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:57,213
No chance.
There's no chance this will work

495
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:01,853
This poor girl will die pointlessly

496
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:04,290
I'm caught in a hellish trap

497
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:08,293
On one side
that damned policeman

498
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,155
On the other,
this monstrous couple

499
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:14,866
Sleep....

500
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,664
The drugs are working

501
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:22,403
What monstrous dreams
she must be having

502
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:28,074
No, l beg you...

503
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,456
Please, have pity

504
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:52,297
lsn't the death
of two women enough?

505
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:58,677
You're not like them.
They are evil

506
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:01,448
l beg you, let me go

507
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:09,387
Please! l want to live...

508
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:19,883
lt's all over

509
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:23,981
l'll be like this forever

510
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,718
That's what you wanted

511
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:28,989
You and your monsters

512
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:31,293
lt's you who killed Romer

513
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,567
You feared my beauty

514
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,533
l'll kill you for what you've done!
Kill you!

515
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,800
You're happy now it's failed

516
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:45,846
Take me away from here!
Take me away

517
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:49,239
You want me
to be a monster like you

518
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:52,152
Take me away

519
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:33,266
What's going on, Barbara?

520
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,807
What's happened here?
Where's Agnes?

521
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:37,534
Let's go! Now!

522
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:28,822
l've just killed my wife
and my servants

523
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:35,559
There's a woman
buried here too

524
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:43,201
That's right.
The Lansac chateau
