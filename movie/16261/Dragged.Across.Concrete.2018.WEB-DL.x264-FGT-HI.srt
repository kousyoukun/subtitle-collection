00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:54,462
I liked you back when
we was in elementary...

4
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,682
in Mr. Lorenzo's class.

5
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,771
I liked you, too.

6
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,298
Wish I knew that.

7
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,520
Though I would've needed
an instruction manual back then.

8
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,003
Ever thought about doing
something else?

9
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,484
Some other kind of work?

10
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,183
Not real serious or anything.

11
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,233
Worked at the mall
for a little while.

12
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,285
Let me look if you don't mind.

13
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,507
I've had a long intermission.

[music playing over car radio]

I'mma talk with Andre
on Tuesday.

00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,114
You interested
if something comes up?

17
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,335
Before I consider
that kind of vocation,

18
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,120
I need to get myself acclimated.

19
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,296
Certainly.

20
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:34,039
Walk around, breathe some air,
gaze at the sky,

see how blue it looks
on the outside.

22
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:39,306
Enjoy yourself.

23
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,134
Once I've settled,
I'll let you know.

24
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:44,833
Anyhow...

25
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,444
thanks for setting that up
with Lana.

26
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,533
And for fetching.

27
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,579
Certainly.

28
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,237

okay?

Yeah.

00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,349
I got company right now. I--

39
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,917
Put some clothes on
and eject that nigga

Okay, okay.

00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,159
Let us get ourselves dressed.
Damn.

47
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:51,525
Forcing my friend out.

48
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:55,065
You gotta promise
you're not gonna hurt him.

49
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,171
Out.

50
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:09,543
Call my mother again
and I'll crack your skull.

51
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,807
- Understand?
- I do.

'Aight.

you been doing this?

57
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,835
Not long.

58
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,512
What happened to your job
at the grocery?

59
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:44,621

Plenty for twice as long.

Yeah...

00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,300
And I can see its footprints
up and down your arms.

Look, you ain't got no right
lecturing me about nothing.

Your ass went to jail.
I did what I had to do.

Ma, let's fast-forward all this.

Ain't no point in arguing
about a bunch of yesterdays.

of Ethan at all ever.

He ain't a toddler no more.

73
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,183
And you doing those things
around him,

74
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,620
it'll mess him up permanent.

75

So, you gonna take care of us
now, huh?

did

was coming over later.

Ma, you got any?
Some kind that smells good.

I got the Italian kind
with the cork in it.

99
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,579
That'll work.

Looks like you've been
working out.

101
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,763
Yeah, I've been doing curls.

those video games

in your letters?

Are you gonna stay here?

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,784
I am...

You didn't think to go back
and get me another?

Accelerated the event.

113

and less inclination.

[second man] Sorry
to bother you, Mr. Vasquez,

132
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,452
but there's a leak
coming from your apartment.

133
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,716
I need to come in
and check the pipes.

I don't see any leaks.

Mi novia.

She's in the bedroom, man.
It's just her.

Yeah, I noticed.
What's her name?

- Rosalinda.
- That sounds like two names.

- At least.
- Yeah. Well, it's just one.

there's only one woman in there?

00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,964
and you're out there
crouching on fire escapes

330
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,749
in the cold for hours

331
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:52,534
with a partner that's 20 years
younger than you.

332
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:55,581
Hey, Anthony's got a mouth with
its own engine but he's solid.

333
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:57,191
That wasn't my point.

334
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:10,378
Thanks for letting us know
about this situation

335
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:12,946
and any word you can have
with the inspector on our behalf

336
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:14,489
would be greatly appreciated.

337
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,863
One thing before you go.

338
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:21,563
I watched that video
a couple times.

339
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,133
You threw a lot more cast-iron
than you needed to.

340
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,572
And when we worked together...

341
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,793
you weren't that rough.

342
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,403
And?

343
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,711
It's not healthy for you

344
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:41,191
to scuff concrete
as long as you have.

345
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:44,151
You get results,

346
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:46,849
but you're losing perspective
and compassion.

347
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,852
Couple more years out there
and you're gonna be

348
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:52,681
a human steamroller
covered with spikes...

349
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,466
and fueled by bile.

350
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,426
There's a lot of imbeciles
out there.

351
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:04,737
Yeah.

352
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:18,272
Use your time off
to think about things.

353
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,317
Talk it over with Melanie.

354
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,712
Spend some time with her
and Sara.

355
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:25,758
Yeah, I will.

356
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:30,823
I won't.

357
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:33,695
I won't.

358
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,046
Sara?

359
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:41,877
Yeah, Mom, it's me.

360
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:48,797
Sweetie?

361
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:51,147
What's wrong?

362
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,068
Sweetie?

363
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:02,637
Come here.

364
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,956
Good evening.
And welcome back, Mr. Lurasetti.

365
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,567
Anybody born in New York

366
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,309
- calls me Tony.
- Tony it is.

367
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,398
One moment, please.

368
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:50,032
Is something wrong with it,
Tony?

369
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:56,256
No, no, it's beautiful.
Exactly like you promised.

370
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:00,129
It's... If Denise has any doubts
about saying yes

371
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,436
when I'm on my knee, this will

372
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,829
nudge her
in the right direction.

373
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:08,137
I got an issue at work.

374
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,313
Do you need a payment plan?

375
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,620
- I'd be more than happy to--
- Thanks.

376
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:15,579
I saved enough for this. It's a
different kind of problem.

377
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:18,800
My wife has two brothers
who are therapists

378
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,455
and three sisters
who were lawyers.

379
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:26,677
Well, my problems don't require
those kinds of professionals.

380
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,463
I just... I'm thinking about
the kind of future

381
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:32,509
I can offer my girlfriend
and, you know,

382
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,381
that life won't have
a lot of diamonds.

383
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,539
You must be ready
by tomorrow night.

384
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,066
Okay. You gotta be careful
around these parts.

385
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,285
It's got lions.

386
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,200
Can we shoot them?

387
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:57,246
Well, yeah.
But it's gonna be pretty hard

388
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,074
unless you have
a pump-action shotgun.

389
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:01,729
Not if we get one-- Oh, shit.

390
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,297
Okay, look. Get behind me.

391
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:06,690
Okay, stay there.

392
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:11,304
Nigga iced that feline.

393
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:13,393
Okay, look, we gotta go.
There's more coming.

394
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,396
Okay, once you get across
this stream,

395
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,050
we gotta look out for
boa constrictors.

396
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,879
This nigga's ready
for a real safari.

397
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,924
Even if my legs worked right

398
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:25,187
I wouldn't wanna be
hunting animals for real.

399
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:27,624
It's like some
rich white people shit.

400
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,802
Still, you're real good
at this game.

401
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,501
And the other ones we played,
too.

402
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:38,592
Well, yeah, this is what I wanna
do when I grow up.

403
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:44,728
- Play games?
- No. No, be a game designer.

404
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,036
To create worlds that are,

405
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,908
you know,
different from the outside.

406
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:53,302
There's schools that teach you
how to do that?

407
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:56,262
- College or something?
- Yeah. They got schools.

408
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,310
Maybe once you finish
high school, you can--

- [cell phone vibrates]

410
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:08,927
I gotta go.

411
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:11,712
Can you save this adventure?

412
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:13,932
Yeah. I can save it.

413
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,936
All right.

414
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,647
His cousins are gonna be there
this time.

415
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,779
Yeah, they are.

416
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:39,870
I don't like doing things

417
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:41,829
with so many question marks
everywhere.

418
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:44,266
Yeah. Me neither.

419
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:47,748
But they was moved up.

420
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:49,663
You already got our advances.

421
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,926
Plus, Andrei already vouched for
'em.

422
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,451
Andrei himself is questionable.

423
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:58,672
You got our insurance?

424
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:00,979
In the glove compartment.

425
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,204
Why'd you want them wrapped
in cellophane?

426
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:14,557
There's some times a nigga
ain't got time for gloves...

427
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:17,256
or to wipe things down.

428
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,825
Yeah. We don't need
to use those.

429
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:25,003
We'll stash them in the vehicles
when we get the chance.

430
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,396
The van and the get-away.

431
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:45,371
It's all cotton candy.

[reporter] The two detectives
were filmed by a concerned

Bulwark citizen this morning.

434
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,333
Both partners have been
suspended.

435
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,119
Brett Ridgeman was charged
with excessive force

436
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:55,207
in 1998 and 2004...

437
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,733
And Anthony Lurasetti
was suspended for violating

438
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:01,691
the code of conduct last year.

439
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:06,392
The police commissioner
has declined to comment...

440
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:17,098
You've got five seconds
to hand me your drawer.

441
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,405
Okay. Okay.

442

I forgot.

454
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,669
- Hey.
- Hey.

455
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:54,021
- Want a beer?
- No, thanks.

456
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:56,197
I have to take some extra meds
today.

457
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,504
I'm sorry to hear that.

458
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,114
You okay?

459
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:02,116
Fair.

460
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:08,992
What's that about?

461
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:12,344
Some kids were menacing Sara
on her way back from the bus

462
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:15,564
and one of them threw a cup of
orange soda all over her.

463
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:18,654
- What kids?
- The one she didn't recognize.

464
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,961
Four blacks, one on a bike.

465
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:24,007
But does it actually matter who?
That's the fifth time.

466
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:25,618
This fucking neighborhood,

467
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,228
it just keeps getting worse
and worse.

468
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,925
- Is she okay?
- Well, yeah. But,

469
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,363
coming home from school
and walking four blocks

470
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:34,540
- shouldn't be an ordeal.
- No. It shouldn't.

471
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:38,021
Did you offer to pick her up
at the bus, escort her back?

472
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:39,458
Of course I did.

473
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:42,025
She knows it isn't easy for me
to get around a lot

474
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:44,289
and she'd be too embarrassed
anyways.

475
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:50,512
Well, she's got two sets of cop
DNA, so of course she's tough.

476
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,645
Yeah, especially for her age
and gender.

477
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:55,038
But she's getting older,
more womanly.

478
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:57,606
And these boys are gonna start
having different kinds of ideas

479
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,695
about her pretty soon,
if they don't already.

480
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,831
You know, I never thought
I was a racist

481
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,398
before living in this area.

482
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:10,619
I'm about as liberal as any
ex-cop could ever be. But now...

483
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:13,927
- We really need to move.
- I know.

484
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,190
No. Yesterday or the day before.

485
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,104
I know.

486
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:20,499
Well, this thing that's going on
with you and Anthony right now,

487
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:23,197
- it's not gonna help.
- You saw the Vasquez footage?

488
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:25,243
- I did.
- And?

489
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,984
It's really time
you got a new windbreaker.

490
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:29,595
Yeah.

491
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:31,901
A couple people made comments.

492
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,078
Well, I was starting to say
before

493
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:38,125
that I called up
Bulwark Security Provider

494
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:40,780
- and I asked them--
- You're not doing security work.

495
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:42,129
We need money to move.

496
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:43,870
Absolutely not.

497
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:47,395
- I can take painkillers if--
- No. You're taking painkillers

498
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,963
to peel potatoes as it is.
It's not worth debating.

499
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:53,009
But I wanna do something.

500
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,273
I need to do something

501
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:58,276
as a mother, as a former cop.

502
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:02,802
Or someday, someday you and me
we are in a hospital room

503
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:05,108
with our daughter talking
to a rape counselor.

504
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:11,767
Yeah.

505
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,086
I'll handle this.

506
00:38:26,956 --> 00:38:27,957
How?

507
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,266
There's a way.

508
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:37,793
But it's not something
that we're gonna talk about...

509
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:39,969
ever.

510
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:45,627
Okay.

511
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:55,768
[knocking] Sara.

512
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,291
Yeah?

513
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,124
That show
about the lion cubs is on

514
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,517
if you wanna watch it with me.

515
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,391
If you'd rather read that's,
you know...

516
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:11,958
No, it's fine.

517
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:15,396
Been staring at the same page
for the past 20 minutes anyway.

518
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,267
Hey, you want something to
nibble?

519
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:18,356
Sure.

520
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:36,896
Are you okay with what happened?

521
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:40,943
Yeah, I'm fine.

522
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:43,729
Hey.

523
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,513
Hey.

524
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,386
- Do you want a cookie?
- No, thank you.

525
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:02,878
They're so cute
before they get big.

526
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:15,848
I got an errand to run.
Be back in a couple hours.

527
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:05,898
I'm here to talk with Friedrich
or Freddie if he prefers.

528
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,944
- And who can I say is--
- Tell him Ridgeman is here.

529
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,253
- I'll go see if he's available.
- He is.

530
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,918
How much are these?
I don't see a tag.

531
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:27,310
Five thousand dollars.

532
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:29,878
So they're bulletproof?

533
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:34,230
You care for a drink?

534
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:36,581
I'm not here for a beverage.

535
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,018
Yes.

536
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,639
You're looking for a new suit?

537
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,818
Now that you have violently
earned some leisure time.

538
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,518
- I'm not.
- Why then have you decided

539
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:03,999
to inhabit my shop this evening?

540
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:05,348
How's your son doing?

541
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,046
Well, very well.

542
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:09,352
His mother and I

543
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:13,008
are taking him to visit
some campuses next month.

544
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,839
He scored very high
on his tests.

545
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:19,537
I thought he had potential.

546
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,714
Thank you.

547
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,501
I know that you're not inclined
towards exceptions.

548
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,025
Well, he was a kid,
the ringleaders are in jail

549
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:32,593
and I knew I could get something
more valuable from you someday

550
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:34,377
if I let him slip
through a crack.

551
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:39,992
- How can I be of aid?
- I need a lead.

552
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:43,865
And what are you hoping to find?

553
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,954
A dealer, or a buyer.

554
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:48,740
Preferably one from out of town.

555
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:53,266
I am not as well-informed as I
once was.

556
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:55,529
Call someone that is.

557
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:08,063
I shall.

558
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:12,372
Now.

559
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:16,028
Anthony. Yeah.

560
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:18,813
Be outside my place at 4:30.

561
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:21,163
Yup, a.m.

562
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:23,862
Put on your fake license plate.

563
00:43:23,905 --> 00:43:26,516
Bring all your hardware
and dress nonchalant.

564
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,497
[cell phone vibrates]

565
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:47,946
Are you the famous police
officer I saw in the news?

566
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:03,048
Any reason you're back there?

567
00:45:04,397 --> 00:45:05,398
There is.

568
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:09,315
Things okay with you
and Melanie?

569
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:10,664
They're fine.

570
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,976
Are you gonna tell me
the nature of this endeavor?

571
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,368
I'm gonna sleep.

572
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:21,980
What are we here--

573
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:24,112
You're gonna drive
to 19th and Brant.

574
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:26,593
Why are we going all the way
up there?

575
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:28,943
Every answer I give you

576
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:31,206
is gonna engender
three times as many questions.

577
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,947
Let me sleep while I can and

578
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:34,949
once we're there,
you'll get your answers

579
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:36,516
and a nap if you need one.

580
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:38,866
Sounds like a stake out.

581
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:41,216
19th and Brant.

582
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,787
You realize we're suspended.

583
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:48,354
Wake me at 18th.

584
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:09,244
We're at 18th.

585
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:18,732
Corner right.

586
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:36,271
Before you touch anything.

587
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:45,977
Ash tray.

588
00:46:48,457 --> 00:46:51,809
One of these big orange things
opened up by my apartment.

589
00:46:52,548 --> 00:46:54,028
Ripe and Fresh.

590
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,466
- Shit?
- I haven't been in it.

591
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:01,340
I thought Denise cooked.

592
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:04,038
Only at her place.

593
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:07,955
She only shops at organic stores

594
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:10,349
that specialize
in assuaging guilt.

595
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:17,356
Let's pull over the other side
of this dumpster.

596
00:47:27,714 --> 00:47:29,847
- Is this good?
- It's perfect.

597
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:43,208
Take two.

598
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:58,353
Something's going on in Room 633
of that tan stucco.

599
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:00,268
What?

600
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:02,531
Hard to tell.

601
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:07,362
Especially because Apartment 633
doesn't even exist.

602
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:10,757
How do you mean?

603
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:14,717
Well, there's no door marked
633.

604
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,676
There's no windows or a buzzer.

605
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:19,418
No mail gets delivered there
either.

606
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:21,899
But it's there.

607
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:26,164
This is sounding metaphysical.

608
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:28,906
You got a tip on this?

609
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:30,516
Yeah.

610
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:34,781
My contact tells me
that one Lorentz Vogelmann

611
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:36,914
is looking for an invisible
residence.

612
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:40,787
And 633 in this tan stucco
is where he landed.

613
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,577
Vogelmann, I don't know
that name.

614
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,579
Well, he's not local.

615
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:53,408
What line of work is he in?

616
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,323
Distribution.

617
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:58,370
Heroin mostly.

618
00:48:58,413 --> 00:48:59,675
Large bundles.

619
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:06,595
What are we doing here?

620
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:11,209
You asking me
this question as a civilian?

621
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:13,167
Because that's what we are
right now, civilians.

622
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:15,517
No different than
kindergarten teachers or the bum

623
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:17,563
that collects aluminum cans
outside my building.

624
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:19,608
I know where I flung my badge
yesterday.

625
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,046
What are we doing here?

626
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:25,266
We're monitoring
a suspicious individual

627
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:28,966
to try and figure out if he's
got any money he doesn't need.

628
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:38,540
Anchovies.

629
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,547
- If you don't wanna be part of--
- Christ.

630
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,682
Are you insane?

631
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:54,339
You get suspended,
not for the first time

632
00:49:54,382 --> 00:49:55,383
in your career either.

633
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,038
Now you decide to become
a criminal?

634
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,302
And what the hell
are you even thinking with this?

635
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:06,307
Well...

636
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:10,659
Say something.

637
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:12,922
Talk!

638
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:19,712
I'm a month away from my 60th...

639
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,063
I'm still the same rank
I was at 27.

640
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:25,848
For a lot of years, I believed
that the quality of my work,

641
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:29,156
what we do together, what I did
with my previous partners...

642
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:32,420
would get me what I deserved.

643
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:37,686
But I don't politic and I don't
change with the times.

644
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,645
And it turns out
that that shit's more important

645
00:50:39,688 --> 00:50:40,994
than good honest work.

646
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:46,521
So yesterday, after we stop
a massive amount of drugs

647
00:50:46,565 --> 00:50:48,262
from getting into
the school system,

648
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:50,743
we get suspended
because it wasn't done politely.

649
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:54,268
When I go home and I find
my daughter has been assaulted

650
00:50:54,312 --> 00:50:56,053
for the fifth time in two years

651
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:58,577
Because of the shit neighborhood

652
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,666
my shit wage
has forced me to live in.

653
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,581
And my wife can't help.

654
00:51:02,885 --> 00:51:05,410
She's barely getting through
the day on her meds as it is.

655
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,195
They okay?

656
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:12,808
Yeah. Melanie's coping.
Sara's doing okay.

657
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:15,289
She's dealing with it better
than most kids her age would.

658
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:18,466
But who knows what kind of
long-term damage

659
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,554
is going on with her.

660
00:51:30,435 --> 00:51:32,785
There has been opportunities
before, more than a few.

661
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:36,310
Take a bribe,
pocket a bundle, pilfer cash.

662
00:51:38,356 --> 00:51:41,141
I was a cop on active duty.
Today, I'm a poor civilian

663
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:42,708
who's nearly 60.

664
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:44,013
I can accept that,

665
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:46,059
but I'm not gonna ask
my wife and daughter to.

666
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:51,064
If we put all
our collars together,

667
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,674
every imbecile we ever nabbed,

668
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:54,981
it'd probably fill
two entire wings

669
00:51:55,024 --> 00:51:56,896
of the state prison.
Maybe three.

670
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:03,207
We have the skills and the right
to acquire proper compensation.

671
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,128
- Christ.
- Weddings aren't cheap.

672
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,782
Don't be an asshole. That's not
what I'm thinking about.

673
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:16,089
Do you think our wages
accurately reflect what we did?

674
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,438
Enough with the justifications.

675
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:19,136
I'm smarter than you
by a yard stick,

676
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:20,485
you're not gonna manipulate me.

677
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:23,923
I saw how you looked
at that duffel bag yesterday.

678
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,272
Quiet.

679
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:27,753
Let me think.

680
00:52:37,545 --> 00:52:38,633
Anchovies.

681
00:52:40,026 --> 00:52:41,027
Look, if you don't wanna
hear any more about this,

682
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,637
fling the gear and drop me off.

683
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:49,209
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I don't need a guardian.

684
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,906
I can do this myself
if I have to.

685
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,169
You don't know that.

686
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:54,780
Not for sure, no.
But if things get tricky,

687
00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:56,521
I'll disengage and find
something else.

688
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,524
This is a bad idea.

689
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:03,397
It's bad for you,
and it's bad for me.

690
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,008
It's bad like lasagna in a can.

691
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,447
Well, then, fling the gear
and drop me off.

692
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:19,848
Look, if you do this,
you do it for yourself.

693
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,461
You don't do it
because you pity my situation.

694
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:25,550
Or because we're partners
or because we're friends

695
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:28,117
that grill burgers on Sundays,
or go to the fights.

696
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,253
You do it solely because you
wanna earn. And that's it.

697
00:53:45,787 --> 00:53:47,746
We disguise ourselves
at the point of contact.

698
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:51,097
Yeah, I got ballistic masks
and vests in the garbage bags,

699
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,751
some teargas bombs as well.

700
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:57,451
I'm in until I'm not.

701
00:53:59,584 --> 00:54:01,629
- Lorentz Vogelmann?
- Yeah.

702
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,859
He looks cast iron.

703
00:54:13,902 --> 00:54:14,990
He is.

704
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:20,953
Any idea if his merchandise
is in 633?

705
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,825
No idea, but after we confirm
that he's there,

706
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:26,306
we'll tail him
and we'll learn his itinerary.

707
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:28,700
You got a timeframe?

708
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:32,965
My contact said
he's rendered 633 for two weeks.

709
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:34,445
We're at day two of that period.

710
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,014
You know anything else about
him, vehicles, associates?

711
00:54:40,146 --> 00:54:41,452
That's what we're learning now.

712
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:45,020
Camera?

713
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,501
Thanks.

714
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:52,419
Why don't you take a nap?

715
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:54,247
Gladly.

716
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:58,283
Make sure to ask me
if I'm still in when I wake up.

717
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,678
I've been processing here for
five hours.

718
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:36,289
You should have given me
a nudge.

719
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,551
There wasn't a reason to.

720
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:39,727
Are you still in?

721
00:55:41,816 --> 00:55:43,340
I am until I'm not.

722
00:55:44,993 --> 00:55:46,865
- You see Vogelmann yet?
- Nope.

723
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:02,228
I'm gonna get something
from this big orange thing.

724
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,536
You want egg salad on rye toast?

725
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,276
Two of them, and root beer.

726
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:21,133
Amen.

727
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:27,052
I've been listening to and
smelling that

728
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:28,749
for the last 98 minutes.

729
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:34,842
Best part of a stake out,

730
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:37,410
other than when it ends...

731
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:39,760
is when you're eating.

732
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,850
A single red ant
could've eaten it faster.

733
00:57:58,997 --> 00:57:59,867
Nope.

734
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,268
Take two.

735
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,401
I'm still enjoying
the aftertaste.

736
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:14,491
Not all of us are.

737
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:28,505
Where did you park?

738
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,110
I've been telling you,
you're getting senile.

739
00:58:32,683 --> 00:58:33,945
You didn't lock it?

740
00:58:34,772 --> 00:58:35,773
I for...

741
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:39,952
I was thinking about something
else at the time. Sorry.

742
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,615
This your duffel?

743
00:58:52,224 --> 00:58:53,573
I don't think so.

744
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,097
Face the windshield.

745
00:58:57,098 --> 00:59:00,058
Put on your seat belts
and lock the doors.

746
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:15,900
Paco...

747
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:20,557
put up that sunshade, por favor.

748
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:31,263
Good. Now empty your pockets.

749
00:59:31,306 --> 00:59:32,873
Put everything
in that duffel bag,

750
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:34,962
or you'll be
painting houses in heaven.

751
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:36,050
No, please.

752
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:37,312
You have five seconds.

753
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:39,271
Four...

754
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:41,055
- Three...
- That's all I got.

755
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:42,622
Me too, I swear to God.

756
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,624
Show me your pocket whites.

757
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:50,674
See?

758
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:33,804
Shut off that phone.

759
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:39,070
Bye.

760
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,031
I expected you--

761
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:49,341
You'll f--

762
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:05,096
Airless.

763
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:10,634
Please, allow me
to show you the interior.

764
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,407
If anything moves in there,

765
01:01:12,451 --> 01:01:14,540
a rat, a mouse,

766
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:16,237
a baby mosquito,

767
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,457
you'll get to ring
Allah's doorbell.

768
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:36,475
Pop the hood.

769
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,592
All is as expected?

770
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:26,264
The blood is gratis.

771
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:29,006
Keys.

772
01:02:40,626 --> 01:02:42,019
[Melanie] Brett, that you?

773
01:02:42,715 --> 01:02:43,760
Confirmed.

774
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:47,111
Look in the closet,
I got you something.

775
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:01,473
Try it on.

776
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:04,998
Everything you get me
fits perfect.

777
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:19,230
Thanks for getting it.

778
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:22,015
Thank me in bed.

779
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:33,940
So, did you guys beat up
any minorities today?

780
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,247
That's only when we're
on the clock.

781
01:03:36,595 --> 01:03:40,164
- This was really delicious.
- Glad you liked it.

782
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,819
And should I infer
from your reticence

783
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:45,256
this is one of those times
you can't talk about your work?

784
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:48,302
Please,
infer about my reticence.

785
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,132
Even though
you've been suspended

786
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:53,742
and you're technically
a civilian?

787
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:56,833
Criminals don't stop
doing what they do

788
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,225
just 'cause
two cops get benched.

789
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:01,141
And we don't do what we do
just for the paycheck.

790
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:06,799
What?

791
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:10,107
Don't try and bluff somebody
who's smarter than you are.

792
01:04:11,195 --> 01:04:12,892
Smarter by a yardstick.

793
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:20,682
Did you see I brought cannolis
from Theo Renzo"s?

794
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:25,905
Just don't do anything to
jeopardize your career, please.

795
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,168
I won't.

796
01:04:40,137 --> 01:04:41,660
Seven unaccounted for.

797
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,228
If Vogelmann's
in that tan stucco

798
01:04:44,271 --> 01:04:46,534
and owns a vehicle,
one of them is his.

799
01:04:53,715 --> 01:04:54,803
Are you still in?

800
01:04:57,328 --> 01:04:58,807
At the outermost edge.

801
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:01,462
Denise?

802
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:05,162
She guessed that something
wasn't right.

803
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,469
I didn't say anything.

804
01:05:10,515 --> 01:05:11,385
So?

805
01:05:13,735 --> 01:05:15,433
Picked up the engagement ring.

806
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:16,825
- From Feinbaum?
- Yeah.

807
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:18,523
Okay.

808
01:05:19,828 --> 01:05:21,569
Got it the day we busted,
uh, Vasquez and...

809
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:23,702
Well, the timing wasn't great,
but...

810
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,307
I was gonna propose anyway,
I wasn't gonna let some

811
01:05:26,574 --> 01:05:29,534
work bullshit interfere with my
private life, but turned out...

812
01:05:30,535 --> 01:05:32,450
she was in a bad mood that night

813
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:36,802
because of some drama at her
job, and I didn't do it.

814
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:39,631
And then yesterday you bring me
here, suggest this thing,

815
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,763
and I'm sort of okay
with the idea,

816
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:44,070
us taking money off
some fuckhead dealer.

817
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:46,768
If the risk isn't too great.

818
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:50,163
But, you know, that night,

819
01:05:50,729 --> 01:05:53,950
when I see Denise, even before
she suspected anything...

820
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:59,216
I know that I can't propose to
her until this thing is done.

821
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:01,566
I evade her questions at dinner
and for the first time

822
01:06:01,609 --> 01:06:03,263
since I went to the jeweler...

823
01:06:04,221 --> 01:06:06,832
I'm not certain she'd say yes
if I proposed.

824
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:11,750
Yeah. I'm driving you home.

825
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:14,318
I haven't made a decision yet.
I'm just pondering--

826
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:17,321
Bullshit. You're decided,
even if you think you aren't.

827
01:06:19,366 --> 01:06:21,586
You're younger than me,
you've got more options.

828
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:23,414
Request a new partner
when we're back on duty,

829
01:06:23,457 --> 01:06:25,285
they'll probably make you
a sergeant one day.

830
01:06:25,329 --> 01:06:26,721
I don't want a new partner.

831
01:06:26,765 --> 01:06:28,680
And I told you that
I'd finish out the shift.

832
01:06:28,723 --> 01:06:30,899
Yeah, I appreciate it.
But look, you're not obligated.

833
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:33,337
- I have done it with--
- My word is an obligation.

834
01:06:36,818 --> 01:06:37,819
Thanks.

835
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:45,305
Two egg salads,

836
01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:48,400
and I'll pay for yours, too,
if it's not Sobrasada.

837
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:49,483
Here's one.

838
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:56,577
This guy's parking.

839
01:07:11,853 --> 01:07:13,855
These brothers
have seen some stuff.

840
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:16,293
Yeah, they're tainted.

841
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:20,427
Think they're with Vogelmann?

842
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:21,950
His buyers?

843
01:07:22,864 --> 01:07:25,302
Twenty-percent.
Go-betweens or local muscles

844
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:26,781
probably more like it.

845
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:31,569
And two root beers.

846
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:48,689
No choice.

847
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:53,564
Ridgeman?

848
01:08:57,002 --> 01:08:58,656
- Vogelmann?
- Yeah.

849
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,745
The black dudes we saw before.

850
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:31,689
They're going west.

851
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,170
Are you sure?

852
01:09:39,523 --> 01:09:42,961
[engine sputtering]

853
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,485
The grey lady
needs a decongestant.

854
01:09:50,577 --> 01:09:52,057
Don't give 'em a wedgie.

855
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,364
Driving any slower than this
will get us noticed.

856
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:00,587
I don't know this area
real well. What's west?

857
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:02,067
Well, more of this.

858
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:04,461
Then the turnpike
and then the school district.

859
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:07,768
Probably not doing all this
to steal crayons.

860
01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:12,773
You feel like
some construction work?

861
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:16,734
Is that necessary right now?

862
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,171
Five percent.

863
01:10:20,564 --> 01:10:22,348
That's for shooting out tires,
sending a warning,

864
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:23,480
things like that, right?

865
01:10:23,523 --> 01:10:25,264
We're not going after
any precedence.

866
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:26,874
I need a better answer
than that.

867
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,487
Right now, we're heading
into new territory.

868
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,272
Foggy gray landscape,
but I know all of my limits,

869
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:34,578
but maybe not yours.

870
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,015
So before I build
a killing instrument

871
01:10:37,058 --> 01:10:38,843
that I last used in the army,

872
01:10:39,452 --> 01:10:42,281
I wanna hear that you don't plan
on executing a human being

873
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:43,935
to facilitate a robbery.

874
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:45,719
We're not executing anybody.

875
01:10:47,547 --> 01:10:50,028
That boundary is reinforced
in steel concrete.

876
01:10:50,071 --> 01:10:51,421
Agreed. Now, build.

877
01:11:18,578 --> 01:11:21,277
The carpool lane.
Right by the black SUV.

878
01:11:24,236 --> 01:11:25,629
Don't let that catch you cold.

879
01:11:41,558 --> 01:11:43,429
You think the transactions
happened today?

880
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:45,083
Oh, this is business.

881
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:48,260
Two tainted black dudes
and an out-of-town convict

882
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,175
going for a drive before dawn.

883
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:53,004
Although it's probably
just a preliminary.

884
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:59,967
Vogelmann was carrying two black
briefcases when he got in.

885
01:12:05,799 --> 01:12:07,932
Is there anything else
you forgot to tell me?

886
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:11,283
- No.
- No. Are you sure?

887
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,329
Something subtle, like maybe
one of the black dudes

888
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:14,721
- had a bazooka?
- Hey.

889
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:19,375
I was up for hours listening to
you process air. It escaped me.

890
01:12:21,249 --> 01:12:22,250
Fine.

891
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:28,387
And I suppose you could have let
me sleep through all of this,

892
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:30,389
and been done with the whole
thing.

893
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:33,697
I definitely should have.

894
01:12:39,006 --> 01:12:40,660
Considering the briefcases...

895
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:44,185
seventy percent
this is the transaction.

896
01:12:45,186 --> 01:12:46,536
What's the other 30?

897
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:51,149
Vogelmann maybe showing somebody
some cash, or some merchandise,

898
01:12:51,192 --> 01:12:53,107
depending on which end
of the deal he's doing.

899
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:55,719
The briefcases?

900
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:00,593
The financial district?

901
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,509
What's going on here?

902
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:05,598
Any idea?

903
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:07,687
I'm trying to flush
the ideas I have

904
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:09,559
'cause none of them
seem to fit this.

905
01:13:34,627 --> 01:13:36,194
Still under construction.

906
01:13:37,108 --> 01:13:39,676
Want me to mail or hand deliver
your genius award?

907
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,447
Nice.

908
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:12,883
Real stylish.

909
01:14:14,406 --> 01:14:16,706
You're saying this before
you use your gay hair shit?

910
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,236
Can't say it after.

911
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:23,197
Time for a walk by?

912
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:25,330
At 5:45.

913
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:27,463
Why is that?

914
01:14:29,073 --> 01:14:31,771
Well, the nearest most likely
time for a meet up is 5:30,

915
01:14:31,815 --> 01:14:34,600
and we should allow the other
party room for tardiness.

916
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:37,385
Unless Vogelmann
is 19 minutes late.

917
01:14:37,908 --> 01:14:39,866
Possible, but not probable.

918
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,912
And I'm doing the walk
by myself.

919
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:45,481
- Usually--
- You're barely here as it is.

920
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:49,267
Any and every bigger risk
we come upon is mine to take.

921
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,147
[spraying]

922
01:15:10,288 --> 01:15:11,202
[coughs]

923
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,699
I'll do you first.

924
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:31,875
Don't make no mess of it.

925
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,095
I used to graffiti
back in the day.

926
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:36,967
And I remember
what it looked like.

927
01:15:38,185 --> 01:15:40,231
You would know better yourself,
you know that?

928
01:15:40,274 --> 01:15:41,885
I was only doing tags.

929
01:15:42,146 --> 01:15:44,017
You was the one
trying to make art.

930
01:15:44,844 --> 01:15:47,412
Nigga painted a pitbull
everybody thought was a turtle.

931
01:16:47,037 --> 01:16:47,937
Nothing.

932
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:52,230
How about getting on a nearby
roof for a better vantage?

933
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,174
Not worth the exposure,

934
01:16:54,653 --> 01:16:57,743
or the risk of us getting split
up in case things get urgent.

935
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,443
This is a bad location for--

936
01:17:20,897 --> 01:17:22,594
Who the hell are those guys?

937
01:17:25,858 --> 01:17:28,644
Must have been here
since before Vogelmann arrived.

938
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:02,286
It's them.

939
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:04,027
Who?

940
01:18:05,376 --> 01:18:06,682
The black dudes.

941
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:08,640
The ones who drove Vogelmann.

942
01:18:40,977 --> 01:18:42,456
- Anchovies.
- Crud.

943
01:18:46,025 --> 01:18:47,766
Any idea what's going on here?

944
01:18:48,506 --> 01:18:50,421
I dunno. These guys
expect to be exposed

945
01:18:50,464 --> 01:18:52,379
to people or a camera
at some point.

946
01:18:53,032 --> 01:18:55,165
That's the only way those
disguises make any sense.

947
01:18:57,863 --> 01:18:59,169
What kind of job?

948
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:01,258
Robbery?

949
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:02,389
Kidnapping?

950
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:05,915
- Murder?
- One or some of those. Yeah.

951
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:35,335
Ma'am?

952
01:19:36,206 --> 01:19:37,685
You need some assistance?

953
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:40,558
Sorry.

954
01:19:54,224 --> 01:19:55,399
Can you hold that?

955
01:19:58,141 --> 01:19:59,882
Please hold it. Ma'am?

956
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,505
Jeffrey?

957
01:20:20,206 --> 01:20:21,642
Jeffrey, let me in.

958
01:20:25,995 --> 01:20:28,388
- Open this.
- Kelly, please stop yelling.

959
01:20:28,432 --> 01:20:31,130
- I was in the bathroom.
- Why put the chain on the door?

960
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:32,871
Why aren't you
on your way to work?

961
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:35,134
You are not allowed to answer
a question with a question.

962
01:20:35,178 --> 01:20:36,919
Don't shout at me, okay?

963
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:39,312
Just... You need to go back downstairs,

964
01:20:39,356 --> 01:20:41,184
get on the bus and go to work.

965
01:20:41,575 --> 01:20:44,013
- Open this right now.
- I can't.

966
01:20:44,056 --> 01:20:46,015
What do you mean you can't?
Of course you can.

967
01:20:46,058 --> 01:20:48,495
I want to, I really,
really do, but I can't.

968
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:51,237
The maternity leave ended four
weeks ago.

969
01:20:51,281 --> 01:20:53,152
You've used all of your vacation

970
01:20:53,196 --> 01:20:55,894
and every single sick day
staying here with Jackson.

971
01:20:56,764 --> 01:20:58,070
He needed me.

972
01:20:59,332 --> 01:21:01,030
I'm taking good care of him...

973
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:06,165
and I will continue to do so
until you're home from work.

974
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:10,735
I hate you.

975
01:21:11,257 --> 01:21:13,042
And I love you twice as much.

976
01:21:13,564 --> 01:21:16,393
You need to go to work... today.

977
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:22,660
My job is so stupid.

978
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:28,840
I go there and I sell

979
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:32,713
chunks of my life
for a paycheck, so that...

980
01:21:33,323 --> 01:21:35,325
rich people I've never even met

981
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:37,849
can put money
in places I've never even seen.

982
01:21:40,983 --> 01:21:43,115
How am I supposed to sit
at a stupid desk

983
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:46,336
and talk about bank accounts
when my baby is here?

984
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:09,707
Jackson needs diapers, and
clothes and gourmet baby food.

985
01:22:10,534 --> 01:22:13,363
Eventually, he's gonna need
school supplies.

986
01:22:13,754 --> 01:22:15,495
And if he's anything
like me and my brothers,

987
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:16,844
he'll need braces, too.

988
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:21,498
Now, all these things cost money
and you make way more than I do.

989
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:23,373
Yeah, I know.

990
01:22:24,156 --> 01:22:26,245
Please get on the bus
and go to work.

991
01:22:27,116 --> 01:22:28,073
Okay.

992
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:31,903
I'm sorry I said I hate you.

993
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:33,426
That's all right.

994
01:22:34,775 --> 01:22:36,255
I know what you really meant.

995
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:38,997
Can I see him though?

996
01:22:40,259 --> 01:22:41,957
Just through the opening.

997
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:46,048
I promise, I'll go if you let me
see him just for a second.

998
01:23:12,074 --> 01:23:14,206
- I need to touch him.
- Kelly, please--

999
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:16,687
I... Just for a second.
I swear I'll go.

1000
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,950
You've broken that swear before
and recently.

1001
01:23:19,733 --> 01:23:21,909
Do you swear
on the life of our baby

1002
01:23:21,953 --> 01:23:24,347
that you will leave
after you've touched him?

1003
01:23:27,393 --> 01:23:28,568
No, no, no.

1004
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:32,268
Say it out loud for it to count,
that's how swears work.

1005
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:36,924
I swear on the life of our child
that I will go to work

1006
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:38,404
after I've touched him.

1007
01:23:52,157 --> 01:23:53,593
You swore on his life.

1008
01:24:08,347 --> 01:24:10,523
I'll see you both
when I get home from work.

1009
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:30,804
So cute.

1010
01:25:05,578 --> 01:25:06,579
Hey.

1011
01:25:07,145 --> 01:25:08,407
- Hey.
- Hi.

1012
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:11,062
- Welcome back, bonita.
- Thank you.

1013
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,673
Good heavens
and praise be to Him.

1014
01:25:16,807 --> 01:25:18,939
Can that radiant vision of
maternity

1015
01:25:18,983 --> 01:25:21,855
that just walked through our
front doors

1016
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:24,641
possibly be
our beloved Mrs. Summer?

1017
01:25:26,295 --> 01:25:27,557
Welcome back.

1018
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,167
Welcome back and congratulations

1019
01:25:29,211 --> 01:25:33,476
on bringing such a lovely
boy child into this world.

1020
01:25:33,519 --> 01:25:35,130
Thank you, Mr. Edmington.

1021
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:38,611
All of us in the bank have great
expectations for your boy.

1022
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:41,440
Wondrous expectations
on a global scale.

1023
01:25:41,962 --> 01:25:42,920
So do I.

1024
01:25:44,356 --> 01:25:46,489
Well, in that case,
our expectations are aligned.

1025
01:25:47,316 --> 01:25:48,708
- Yeah.
- Welcome back.

1026
01:25:48,752 --> 01:25:50,232
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

1027
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:54,279
Mrs. Summer, your absence
was a weight upon us,

1028
01:25:54,932 --> 01:25:57,674
your return
is a divine blessing.

1029
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:01,765
It was just three months.

1030
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,898
Nevertheless, a doleful era.

1031
01:26:06,073 --> 01:26:08,815
You really shouldn't look that
good after having a baby.

1032
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:10,165
Thanks.

1033
01:26:11,383 --> 01:26:12,336
It's kind of annoying
how good you look.

1034
01:26:12,341 --> 01:26:15,170
- Thank you.
- I made cupcakes.

1035
01:26:15,213 --> 01:26:17,650
- Oh, double chocolate.
- Of course.

1036
01:26:24,483 --> 01:26:27,182
Oh, yeah, your husband
helped me with that part.

1037
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:31,098
A small token, a minuscule
manifestation of our affections.

1038
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:33,405
Mr. Edmington,
everybody, really,

1039
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:35,668
thank you for this, really.

1040
01:26:39,629 --> 01:26:41,979
It was really hard
to leave the baby, but--

1041
01:26:42,022 --> 01:26:44,242
Any deliveries
scheduled for today?

1042
01:26:46,244 --> 01:26:47,854
No, not that I'm aware of.

1043
01:26:50,074 --> 01:26:51,162
Everyone, listen.

1044
01:26:52,555 --> 01:26:55,250
Hands up, and keep them there
or this man dies.

1045
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:10,529
[distorted voice]
Keep your hands raised.

1046
01:27:10,834 --> 01:27:12,270
Cooperate.

1047
01:27:12,705 --> 01:27:16,970
If you make any sudden moves,
you will be executed.

1048
01:27:17,014 --> 01:27:21,323
If the police show up
everyone will be executed.

1049
01:27:22,802 --> 01:27:26,806
Do not prioritize money
over having a heartbeat.

1050
01:27:27,154 --> 01:27:29,156
Do you understand?

1051
01:27:29,592 --> 01:27:30,462
Yes.

1052
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:37,252
- Mr. Edmington.
- Sir.

1053
01:27:38,078 --> 01:27:41,081
Are there any employees
in the back?

1054
01:27:41,604 --> 01:27:45,085
If so, get them right now.

1055
01:27:45,129 --> 01:27:47,653
You have 20 seconds.

1056
01:27:50,743 --> 01:27:53,529
No, there is no one in the back,
everyone is here in the front.

1057
01:27:54,965 --> 01:27:57,620
Are you certain
of this response?

1058
01:27:58,577 --> 01:28:00,579
You appear to be uncertain.

1059
01:28:00,623 --> 01:28:02,233
No, I'm quite certain
everyone is here

1060
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:03,539
in the front of the bank.

1061
01:28:03,887 --> 01:28:06,150
We will accept this response.

1062
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:10,372
If you are mistaken, your
testicles will be removed...

1063
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,243
with this.

1064
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:17,596
Please, let's not talk about
anything rash.

1065
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:18,902
Everyone is here, as I said,

1066
01:28:18,945 --> 01:28:20,469
- in the front of the bank--
- You.

1067
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,649
You seem honest and obedient.

1068
01:28:26,692 --> 01:28:29,521
Handcuff every single person
here,

1069
01:28:29,913 --> 01:28:31,567
except for the manager.

1070
01:28:32,742 --> 01:28:33,917
Use these.

1071
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:40,315
Fasten their hands
behind their backs.

1072
01:28:40,358 --> 01:28:41,359
Tight.

1073
01:28:42,665 --> 01:28:45,058
Do not say anything to anyone
at any time,

1074
01:28:45,102 --> 01:28:46,973
or you will be executed.

1075
01:29:00,813 --> 01:29:02,467
Mr. Edmington.

1076
01:29:02,859 --> 01:29:03,773
Sir.

1077
01:29:05,035 --> 01:29:06,635
One of us will follow you
to the vaults.

1078
01:29:06,776 --> 01:29:08,343
Open them all.

1079
01:29:08,778 --> 01:29:11,998
I will open every vault that I
am capable of opening for you.

1080
01:29:12,042 --> 01:29:14,261
If our associate does not return

1081
01:29:14,305 --> 01:29:16,916
with gold bullion
in three minutes or less,

1082
01:29:17,177 --> 01:29:20,355
we will execute this woman.

1083
01:29:21,573 --> 01:29:24,141
[clock ticking]

1084
01:29:46,163 --> 01:29:47,425
Send it.

1085
01:30:08,664 --> 01:30:11,318
Will you make sure
my baby gets this?

1086
01:30:13,277 --> 01:30:14,887
His name is Jackson.

1087
01:30:21,764 --> 01:30:23,113
Must have gone this way.

1088
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,071
Think they know we're following?

1089
01:30:25,115 --> 01:30:26,159
Thirty percent.

1090
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,022
Though I'm hoping they saw us
at Brownvine.

1091
01:30:30,207 --> 01:30:31,861
You're hoping they saw us?

1092
01:30:31,904 --> 01:30:34,254
Yeah, if they know they've been
spotted, maybe they'll abort

1093
01:30:34,298 --> 01:30:35,734
whatever it is they got planned.

1094
01:30:37,823 --> 01:30:39,477
Glad to hear
your priorities changed.

1095
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:43,960
Well, civilians are at risk,
they're the priority.

1096
01:30:44,003 --> 01:30:46,441
Money or no money, badge or no
badge. You had doubts?

1097
01:30:46,876 --> 01:30:48,617
Microscopic ones, if any, but...

1098
01:30:48,878 --> 01:30:50,532
good to hear things articulated.

1099
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:54,536
Trusted bank of North Bulwark.

1100
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,409
That isn't ambiguous.
Is that an embrasure?

1101
01:30:58,931 --> 01:31:01,368
- What's an embrasure?
- See that opening?

1102
01:31:01,586 --> 01:31:03,936
The horizontal slit
above the word security.

1103
01:31:06,983 --> 01:31:08,419
A guy's in there.

1104
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:13,685
So it's a robbery.

1105
01:31:14,207 --> 01:31:15,165
Yup.

1106
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,590
We wait until they drive off?

1107
01:31:49,373 --> 01:31:50,374
Yeah.

1108
01:31:52,028 --> 01:31:55,128
It's a robbery until somebody
turns it into something worse.

1109
01:32:04,257 --> 01:32:05,868
You looking to box them in?

1110
01:32:07,086 --> 01:32:08,218
Pointlessly.

1111
01:32:08,697 --> 01:32:10,699
Financial district in a weekday.

1112
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,527
Shouldn't engage them here.

1113
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:17,183
You think they'd go back to
the parking garage after this?

1114
01:32:17,619 --> 01:32:18,707
Fifty percent.

1115
01:32:24,669 --> 01:32:26,758
Fifty percent doesn't value
anything.

1116
01:32:26,802 --> 01:32:28,325
Any yes or no question.

1117
01:32:32,329 --> 01:32:34,679
Hope this asshole doesn't get
too curious.

1118
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:44,210
"The bank will reopen
in 15 minutes, come back then."

1119
01:32:44,733 --> 01:32:47,431
He might have said 50, but why?

1120
01:32:48,214 --> 01:32:49,302
Probably not.

1121
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,440
This guy's
like a cigarette commercial.

1122
01:33:20,507 --> 01:33:21,596
They're loading.

1123
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:30,648

Christ.

1125
01:33:54,803 --> 01:33:56,152
We could have stopped this.

1126
01:34:01,766 --> 01:34:04,290
- Are you gonna say anything?
- Focus on that.

1127
01:34:07,424 --> 01:34:09,208
We let those people get killed.

1128
01:34:12,255 --> 01:34:13,822
You're not gonna say anything?

1129
01:34:17,564 --> 01:34:20,132
You don't have anything to say
about our culpability?

1130
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:22,918
Those Italian emotions
are saying plenty.

1131
01:34:22,961 --> 01:34:25,660
- Go to hell, you heartless fuck.
- I never saw that opera.

1132
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:28,880
Look, by the time we knew
it wasn't a routine drug deal,

1133
01:34:28,924 --> 01:34:31,404
- it was already too late.
- You could have called it in.

1134
01:34:32,362 --> 01:34:34,233
When the van
left the parking garage.

1135
01:34:34,277 --> 01:34:35,670
Put the Bulwark PD on alert.

1136
01:34:35,974 --> 01:34:36,974
We didn't.

1137
01:34:38,063 --> 01:34:39,674
The chance of that
accomplishing anything

1138
01:34:39,717 --> 01:34:43,590
in the 16-minute interim,
less than 50 percent or even 25.

1139
01:34:44,287 --> 01:34:47,246
You wanna call the Bulwark PD,
the state police, the Feds,

1140
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:48,726
let them handle it, go ahead.

1141
01:34:49,466 --> 01:34:52,034
But that van,
and the cut-throats inside,

1142
01:34:52,338 --> 01:34:55,733
they'll be vapor before any
enforcement agency can respond.

1143
01:34:57,996 --> 01:34:59,041
We're it.

1144
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,718
You said you weren't
gonna kill anyone

1145
01:35:23,761 --> 01:35:26,503
unless it was in self-defense.
You gave us your word.

1146
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:30,289
Get on the interstate.

1147
01:35:32,422 --> 01:35:34,467
It was excessive
what happened back there.

1148
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:38,907
Do you wish to expand upon
your critique?

1149
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:41,692
Give us the urban point of view?

1150
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,433
He ain't got
nothing more to say.

1151
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,217
Hush that flap, nigga.

1152
01:35:45,652 --> 01:35:48,612
Keep your attention on the road.
We'll get through this.

1153
01:35:51,354 --> 01:35:52,485
Muscles,

1154
01:35:52,834 --> 01:35:54,096
Slim.

1155
01:35:54,661 --> 01:35:55,575
Yeah.

1156
01:35:56,838 --> 01:35:58,665
Place your firearms
inside of the glove box.

1157
01:36:03,322 --> 01:36:05,281
That wasn't a suggestion.

1158
01:36:10,416 --> 01:36:11,461
All right.

1159
01:36:26,824 --> 01:36:29,305
Cover that weaponry
with the sport section.

1160
01:36:35,224 --> 01:36:36,355
Close the door.

1161
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,447
Close the door.

1162
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:43,798
It's closed.

1163
01:36:44,624 --> 01:36:46,235
We didn't hear it click.

1164
01:36:46,278 --> 01:36:48,193
We want to hear it click.

1165
01:37:00,858 --> 01:37:02,729
Do not open that glove box

1166
01:37:02,773 --> 01:37:04,557
unless I have
given you my permission.

1167
01:37:06,124 --> 01:37:06,995
All right.

1168
01:37:15,525 --> 01:37:16,725
You see something?

1169
01:37:19,529 --> 01:37:20,922
Nah, nothing.

1170
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:32,368
Crud, the interstate.

1171
01:37:34,457 --> 01:37:36,067
Any idea
where they're gonna land?

1172
01:37:36,111 --> 01:37:38,896
Somewhere rural, where they're
gonna exchange vehicles,

1173
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,028
but where that is...

1174
01:38:29,773 --> 01:38:31,209
Need gas pretty soon.

1175
01:38:31,253 --> 01:38:32,819
Yeah, so do they.

1176
01:38:32,863 --> 01:38:34,821
We'll curb when they pull in
somewhere.

1177
01:38:35,822 --> 01:38:37,085
The cans in the truck?

1178
01:38:37,781 --> 01:38:39,652
Is that a question
you just asked me?

1179
01:38:47,051 --> 01:38:48,618
[squeals]

1180
01:38:50,881 --> 01:38:51,926
Quiet.

1181
01:38:52,578 --> 01:38:54,667
I need to pee.

1182
01:38:56,234 --> 01:38:57,192
[groans]

1183
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,934
The other quiet.

1184
01:39:08,072 --> 01:39:11,249
Say another word
and you're a pirate.

1185
01:39:18,343 --> 01:39:19,518
Cover that up.

1186
01:39:35,317 --> 01:39:36,317
Hold still.

1187
01:39:41,932 --> 01:39:42,977
[struggling]

1188
01:39:55,902 --> 01:39:56,902
Squirt.

1189
01:40:03,736 --> 01:40:04,737
Slim.

1190
01:40:06,261 --> 01:40:07,262
Yeah?

1191
01:40:07,305 --> 01:40:09,438
Come get rid of this lady piss.

1192
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,258
We'll get through this.

1193
01:40:48,912 --> 01:40:51,480
Just do what you're paid to do
and never mind them back there.

1194
01:41:07,713 --> 01:41:10,020
Remember when your ma brung us
out here for your birthday?

1195
01:41:12,153 --> 01:41:15,286
You and me,
at least ten other locals.

1196
01:41:21,031 --> 01:41:22,598
Severos was there too,

1197
01:41:23,555 --> 01:41:25,514
even though we ain't really
want him around.

1198
01:41:27,429 --> 01:41:29,083
But there was
your sister's friends

1199
01:41:29,126 --> 01:41:30,519
and a couple of neighbors,
I think.

1200
01:41:36,829 --> 01:41:40,006
You wanted an ice cream cake
so your ma brung it in a cooler.

1201
01:41:40,703 --> 01:41:41,834
What was it again?

1202
01:41:45,838 --> 01:41:47,362
Tyrannosaurus rex.

1203
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:50,016
That's right. That's right.

1204
01:41:51,714 --> 01:41:53,759
I remember now.
Nigga was a T-rex.

1205
01:42:00,592 --> 01:42:03,334
And its fangs was made out
of candy corns.

1206
01:42:04,466 --> 01:42:06,555
The ones that was white
with red on the tips

1207
01:42:06,598 --> 01:42:07,904
that look like blood.

1208
01:42:09,297 --> 01:42:10,863
The meal he just ate,

1209
01:42:11,342 --> 01:42:13,518
Stegosaurus or whoever.

1210
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:17,000
I was really into dinosaurs
back then.

1211
01:42:17,043 --> 01:42:18,132
Yeah, you was.

1212
01:42:18,871 --> 01:42:20,351
And you got all pissed and shit

1213
01:42:20,395 --> 01:42:22,353
'cause your ma gave me
the biggest piece.

1214
01:42:23,659 --> 01:42:26,227
Yeah. Yeah.

1215
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:28,011
The birthday boy
gets the biggest piece.

1216
01:42:29,404 --> 01:42:31,057
And that's in
the moms' handbook.

1217
01:42:31,623 --> 01:42:32,624
Yeah.

1218
01:42:33,582 --> 01:42:34,757
But she probably knew my ma

1219
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,454
wasn't taking care of me
too good.

1220
01:42:40,415 --> 01:42:41,503
She knew.

1221
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:45,768
Always had a crush on you.

1222
01:42:49,032 --> 01:42:50,381
She knew that, too.

1223
01:42:58,389 --> 01:42:59,390
Thanks, bro.

1224
01:43:01,436 --> 01:43:02,741
We'll get through this.

1225
01:43:04,395 --> 01:43:05,396
Together.

1226
01:43:11,837 --> 01:43:13,361
Is anybody following us?

1227
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:15,276
- Well, there's a--
- No.

1228
01:43:16,842 --> 01:43:18,540
Only things behind us are
a green pickup and a gray car

1229
01:43:18,583 --> 01:43:20,237
that got on a little while back.

1230
01:43:23,675 --> 01:43:24,763
Be vigilant.

1231
01:43:27,288 --> 01:43:28,376
Always am.

1232
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:42,694
First estimate
is five people dead.

1233
01:43:43,608 --> 01:43:45,088
Two in critical, one missing.

1234
01:43:45,131 --> 01:43:47,743
Crud. That last one's a hostage.

1235
01:43:48,309 --> 01:43:49,919
Looks like a large amount
of gold bullion

1236
01:43:49,962 --> 01:43:51,268
was delivered two days ago.

1237
01:43:51,312 --> 01:43:52,661
Not a coincidence.

1238
01:43:59,668 --> 01:44:00,568
Christ.

1239
01:44:02,148 --> 01:44:03,715
Six people got punctuation.

1240
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:15,423
Six human beings died.

1241
01:44:25,128 --> 01:44:26,172
I gotta know.

1242
01:44:26,912 --> 01:44:28,174
In case we don't come back,

1243
01:44:28,218 --> 01:44:29,741
I gotta know
what she would have said.

1244
01:44:29,785 --> 01:44:31,134
We're coming back.

1245
01:44:32,831 --> 01:44:33,876
One hundred percent?

1246
01:44:37,053 --> 01:44:38,228
I'm at 80.

1247
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:40,186
Maybe even 85, you're 70.

1248
01:44:42,101 --> 01:44:43,101
Experience?

1249
01:44:43,451 --> 01:44:46,280
Yeah, plus I'm not Italian.

1250
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:53,199
That's her voicemail.

1251
01:44:56,377 --> 01:44:57,987
Hey, Denise, I...

1252
01:44:58,901 --> 01:45:00,381
I got a favor to ask you.

1253
01:45:00,424 --> 01:45:01,556
Pretty important.

1254
01:45:01,599 --> 01:45:04,341
I'm just out of town right now

1255
01:45:04,385 --> 01:45:06,909
and I need some information
back at my place.

1256
01:45:06,952 --> 01:45:09,303
So if you could swing by
and get it,

1257
01:45:09,346 --> 01:45:11,348
I would really,
really appreciate it.

1258
01:45:12,784 --> 01:45:15,787
It's in the right pocket
of my tan blazer,

1259
01:45:16,179 --> 01:45:19,748
herringbone one that I wore
to your sister's the last time.

1260
01:45:20,618 --> 01:45:22,664
And I know this is inconvenient,

1261
01:45:22,707 --> 01:45:26,407
but it would really be
helping me out.

1262
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:28,800
Call me when you get it.

1263
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,761
That's it,
I'll talk to you soon.

1264
01:45:33,675 --> 01:45:35,329
Love you, bye.

1265
01:45:36,591 --> 01:45:38,897
Ain't the most romantic way
to propose.

1266
01:45:39,376 --> 01:45:40,464
It isn't.

1267
01:45:40,508 --> 01:45:42,988
Denise is smart,
she's very clear-minded.

1268
01:45:43,032 --> 01:45:45,121
She's not gonna change
her answer one way or the other

1269
01:45:45,164 --> 01:45:46,557
because of how I asked her.

1270
01:45:46,601 --> 01:45:48,733
- I'd give you about--
- Don't tell me a percentage.

1271
01:45:57,002 --> 01:45:58,264
Watch this up here.

1272
01:46:00,745 --> 01:46:01,703
I see it.

1273
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:06,272
Let's grab take out
when we're done with this.

1274
01:46:08,884 --> 01:46:11,495
I'm really in the mood
for some cellophane noodles.

1275
01:46:17,545 --> 01:46:18,459
Okay.

1276
01:46:36,781 --> 01:46:37,782
Muscles.

1277
01:46:39,131 --> 01:46:40,132
Yeah?

1278
01:46:40,698 --> 01:46:42,483
Is anybody following after us?

1279
01:46:43,658 --> 01:46:45,616
The green pickup, the gray car?

1280
01:46:47,052 --> 01:46:49,315
- No.
- Please check your mirrors.

1281
01:46:54,059 --> 01:46:55,452
Nothing but rust and air.

1282
01:46:55,887 --> 01:46:57,236
I'll keep an eye out.

1283
01:46:58,368 --> 01:47:00,022
- [indicator clicks]
- Muscles...

1284
01:47:01,502 --> 01:47:02,894
to whom are you signaling?

1285
01:47:03,852 --> 01:47:05,070
Nobody, no one.

1286
01:47:06,202 --> 01:47:07,725
I just did it out of habit.

1287
01:47:20,129 --> 01:47:21,130
Possum.

1288
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:27,615
Refrigerator, dead rat.

1289
01:47:41,237 --> 01:47:42,238
We here.

1290
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:46,503
We are here or we're here.

1291
01:47:47,069 --> 01:47:48,418
No, we here.

1292
01:47:49,375 --> 01:47:50,725
You understood me, didn't you?

1293
01:47:54,511 --> 01:47:56,339
- Didn't you?
- Please face forward.

1294
01:47:58,384 --> 01:48:00,343
Figure he's exacerbating.

1295
01:48:37,815 --> 01:48:39,556
The garage door is still intact?

1296
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:41,515
Look like.

1297
01:48:49,131 --> 01:48:50,480
Open the right bay.

1298
01:48:50,785 --> 01:48:52,874
Can I take my gun
out the glove box in case?

1299
01:48:52,917 --> 01:48:54,005
You may not.

1300
01:50:18,176 --> 01:50:19,525
[distant gunshots]

1301
01:50:34,584 --> 01:50:35,585
Possum.

01:50:40,764 --> 01:50:41,764
Dead rat.

1304
01:50:56,127 --> 01:50:57,346
Give me the key.

1305
01:51:01,959 --> 01:51:03,004
Give me the key.

1306
01:51:03,744 --> 01:51:05,354
Shoot him and use the spare key.

1307
01:51:06,007 --> 01:51:08,400
The spare is on the ring
that I gave to Slim.

1308
01:51:12,927 --> 01:51:14,102
Where is the key?

1309
01:51:15,016 --> 01:51:16,713
Did you check
your mother's rectum?

1310
01:51:30,771 --> 01:51:31,902
Where is the key?

1311
01:51:33,556 --> 01:51:35,166
Ask a proctologist.

1312
01:51:46,177 --> 01:51:47,352
Hold tight, nigga.

1313
01:51:51,095 --> 01:51:52,575
Hey, get out of here.

1314
01:51:54,011 --> 01:51:55,970
Just leave me, man.
Get out of here.

1315
01:51:56,013 --> 01:51:57,580
- Shut that flap, nigga.
- [groans]

1316
01:51:57,623 --> 01:51:59,756
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Henry, stop!

1317
01:52:02,541 --> 01:52:03,541
Damn.

1318
01:52:04,848 --> 01:52:08,547
This whole thing was my fault.
My idea.

1319
01:52:09,244 --> 01:52:10,245
Get.

1320
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,337
Henry.

1321
01:52:17,643 --> 01:52:18,819
You get to go.

1322
01:52:19,297 --> 01:52:20,864
Give something to my Ma.

1323
01:52:21,169 --> 01:52:22,431
I take care of her good.

1324
01:52:22,823 --> 01:52:23,737
Yeah.

1325
01:52:24,955 --> 01:52:27,523
Get her a nice television.
One of those--

1326
01:52:40,144 --> 01:52:41,624
Do you see the key?

1327
01:52:42,277 --> 01:52:43,495
He swallowed it.

1328
01:52:43,974 --> 01:52:45,933
And Slim's still out there.

1329
01:52:53,984 --> 01:52:56,334
Should we drive past him
and come at him from behind?

1330
01:52:56,378 --> 01:52:59,947
No. We need to box him in
right here, right now.

1331
01:53:03,037 --> 01:53:04,690
Conflict couldn't happen in

1332
01:53:04,734 --> 01:53:07,128
a better less populated place
than this.

1333
01:53:20,619 --> 01:53:22,491
Looks like problems
with the hired help.

1334
01:53:33,023 --> 01:53:36,505
- So Reed's still alive?
- That front door looks armored.

1335
01:53:37,158 --> 01:53:38,681
Why are they making her do that?

1336
01:53:38,724 --> 01:53:40,726
They wanna clean things up
before they go?

1337
01:53:40,944 --> 01:53:43,860
- Seventy-five percent.
- What's the other 25?

1338
01:53:43,904 --> 01:53:46,863
I'm not sure. Something weird.

1339
01:53:59,528 --> 01:54:00,703
This is excessive.

1340
01:54:32,996 --> 01:54:34,998
- We got a leak.
- I'm aware.

1341
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:38,872
Don't get shot.

1342
01:54:39,655 --> 01:54:41,135
They don't have the right angle.

1343
01:54:45,530 --> 01:54:47,054
Unless they get on the ground.

1344
01:54:48,185 --> 01:54:50,622
Since I'm already here,
I'll get off the first shots.

1345
01:54:50,666 --> 01:54:52,189
You learn that in the army?

1346
01:54:52,233 --> 01:54:53,712
Geometry actually.

1347
01:54:53,756 --> 01:54:55,714
Did you see what happened
to that other helper?

1348
01:54:56,977 --> 01:54:58,892
- The skinny black guy?
- Him.

1349
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:00,284
No.

1350
01:55:01,677 --> 01:55:03,635
I think he disappeared
during the first barrage.

1351
01:55:04,723 --> 01:55:06,595
That's a variable
we didn't need.

1352
01:55:11,992 --> 01:55:13,167
Start the party.

1353
01:55:25,527 --> 01:55:26,727
Did you miss?

1354
01:55:29,313 --> 01:55:30,508
Don't be an asshole.

1355
01:55:41,891 --> 01:55:44,067
They're rolling bunkers
on airless tires.

1356
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:49,159
Remove the stomach,

1357
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:51,683
so that the key doesn't fall
into his entrails.

1358
01:55:52,119 --> 01:55:53,120
I will.

1359
01:56:09,701 --> 01:56:10,964
Think they're cops?

1360
01:56:14,837 --> 01:56:18,101
Not unless they're crooked ones,
looking for the gold.

1361
01:56:19,537 --> 01:56:21,887
I suspect these men
are Slim's associates.

1362

[gunshot ricochets]

1363
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:25,848
Just stay focused on your work.

1364
01:56:26,457 --> 01:56:29,591
This duo isn't properly armed
for an engagement with us.

1365
01:56:33,943 --> 01:56:36,337
It's the pale sac in there,
the one that looks like--

1366
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:38,165
I know which one it is.

1367
01:56:40,558 --> 01:56:42,386
Careful not to pop his liver.

1368
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:45,607
That is the worst smell in the
world, black guys especially.

1369
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,523
Let's dump him and drive.

1370
01:57:40,879 --> 01:57:41,879
Shells.

1371
01:57:53,588 --> 01:57:55,938
Should we call this in,
anonymously?

1372
01:57:56,895 --> 01:57:58,201
I'm not equipped for it.

1373
01:58:07,341 --> 01:58:08,690
Things are getting weird.

1374
01:58:12,128 --> 01:58:13,128
Get in.

1375
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:31,626
- Protection?
- A hundred percent.

1376
01:58:31,669 --> 01:58:33,845
- Thanks for letting me know.
- You heard me. Buckle.

1377
01:59:29,771 --> 01:59:31,990
Is her home address literally
in that picture?

1378
01:59:32,339 --> 01:59:35,777
Completely. And she's younger
than she looks.

1379
01:59:37,779 --> 01:59:39,650
She probably had kids.

1380
01:59:47,484 --> 01:59:50,183
Do you have any loved ones
at this address?

1381
01:59:57,581 --> 02:00:00,323
That photo had some
very unpleasant instructions

1382
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:01,977
that will go to our associates.

1383
02:00:03,108 --> 02:00:05,807
Unless you do exactly
what we tell you to do.

1384
02:00:16,731 --> 02:00:18,341
The drip has become a trickle.

1385
02:00:19,124 --> 02:00:20,343
Yeah. I got ears.

1386
02:00:22,998 --> 02:00:24,173
I'm concerned.

1387
02:00:38,056 --> 02:00:39,536
Should we make an announcement?

1388
02:00:40,058 --> 02:00:42,060
- Say we're cops?
- No.

1389
02:00:42,844 --> 02:00:45,281
That will increase the
likelihood of hostage situation

1390
02:00:45,325 --> 02:00:46,500
by 60 percent.

1391
02:00:48,632 --> 02:00:49,546
Hey!

1392
02:00:50,330 --> 02:00:51,374
Shitheads!

1393
02:00:51,418 --> 02:00:52,549
Listen up!

1394
02:00:53,246 --> 02:00:55,335
This is the only deal
you're gonna get.

1395
02:00:56,336 --> 02:00:59,077
We're just here for the gold.
That's it.

1396
02:01:00,122 --> 02:01:03,647
Leave the bullion where it is
and come on out.

1397
02:01:03,691 --> 02:01:05,127
We'll let you walk away.

1398
02:01:06,084 --> 02:01:08,870
You stay in the van,
we'll kill all of you,

02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:15,137
sidekick number two, the girl,
everybody.

1401
02:01:23,232 --> 02:01:24,320
Get the gas.

1402
02:01:25,582 --> 02:01:26,714
Teargas?

1403
02:01:27,584 --> 02:01:28,846
- The gas?
- Gasoline.

1404
02:01:44,384 --> 02:01:46,995
Don't hold the meeting for me.
I've been delayed.

1405
02:01:48,823 --> 02:01:50,520
I don't think
the budget is realistic

1406
02:01:50,564 --> 02:01:52,305
for wheelchair access
and metal detectors

1407
02:01:52,348 --> 02:01:54,002
so we need to provide them both.

1408
02:01:54,785 --> 02:01:56,483
Well, let me just do this thing
for Tony

1409
02:01:56,526 --> 02:01:58,572
and then we can get into it
when I get back.

1410
02:01:59,442 --> 02:02:01,314
Thanks. Bye.

1411
02:02:49,144 --> 02:02:51,799
You got 45 seconds to come out.

1413
02:03:09,382 --> 02:03:11,340
You got 15 seconds.

- [woman] Stop! [whimpers]
- [gunshot]

1415
02:03:36,757 --> 02:03:38,585
Looks female but verify.

1416
02:03:41,414 --> 02:03:42,458
She's a she.

1417
02:03:52,294 --> 02:03:53,426
Mrs. Reed?

1418
02:04:00,476 --> 02:04:02,870
What happened to Vogelmann
and his sidekicks?

1419
02:04:09,529 --> 02:04:11,531
Can you get on the other side
of this vehicle?

1420
02:04:21,715 --> 02:04:23,238
Mrs. Reed, did you hear me?

1421
02:04:25,283 --> 02:04:26,328
I'm coming.

1422
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:31,725
Keep coming, Mrs. Reed.
You're doing great.

1423
02:04:35,250 --> 02:04:36,469
You're almost here.

1424
02:04:49,656 --> 02:04:50,787
You okay?

1425
02:05:07,412 --> 02:05:08,412
Hey.

1426
02:05:19,990 --> 02:05:21,165
Stop.

1427
02:05:21,209 --> 02:05:23,224
I don't want to see
what's under there.

1428
02:05:23,254 --> 02:05:24,255
Okay.

1429
02:05:31,306 --> 02:05:32,829
That girl was innocent.

1430
02:05:35,919 --> 02:05:38,008
Want me to drive you
to the emergency room?

1431
02:05:38,052 --> 02:05:39,749
No, it's too much to move.

1432
02:05:41,882 --> 02:05:43,144
And there's no reason.

1433
02:05:48,192 --> 02:05:50,499
Don't have the right words
for this situation.

1434
02:05:51,631 --> 02:05:54,547
God, I really hope that this...

1435
02:05:56,157 --> 02:05:57,288
mistake...

1436
02:05:58,376 --> 02:05:59,943
is not what I'm remembered for.

1437
02:06:01,075 --> 02:06:02,598
I'll keep your name out of it.

1438
02:06:04,208 --> 02:06:05,645
- I hope you can.
- I will.

1439
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:11,825
Want me to get that?

1440
02:06:15,655 --> 02:06:16,699
When she called?

1441
02:06:18,614 --> 02:06:19,814
I don't know.

1442
02:06:19,876 --> 02:06:21,443
Well, I'll type for you.

1443
02:06:22,183 --> 02:06:24,359
- Passcode is--
- I know, I know what it is.

1444
02:06:27,101 --> 02:06:28,929
- Let me hold it.
- Yeah.

1445
02:06:47,687 --> 02:06:48,887
I'm sorry.

1446
02:06:49,514 --> 02:06:52,779
It wasn't what I wanted to hear.

1447
02:06:58,436 --> 02:06:59,655
Want me to break it?

1448
02:07:00,351 --> 02:07:01,352
Yeah.

1449
02:07:11,449 --> 02:07:12,537
Damn!

1450
02:07:15,410 --> 02:07:16,411
Damn!

1451
02:07:17,151 --> 02:07:18,152
Good?

1452
02:08:53,290 --> 02:08:55,728
I'm surrendering.
Taking your deal.

1453

You should have trusted a nigga.

1610
02:23:32,473 --> 02:23:34,780
All I ever did for this was
steal some autos,

1611
02:23:34,823 --> 02:23:36,223
peddle some blow

1612
02:23:37,347 --> 02:23:40,347
and put the fool who crippled
my brother into intensive.

1613
02:23:41,351 --> 02:23:42,962
I ain't never killed nobody.

1614
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:45,921
Damn.

1615
02:23:50,578 --> 02:23:52,188
Bury my friend, please.

1616
02:23:53,929 --> 02:23:55,714
I don't want him
involved in this.

1617
02:23:58,717 --> 02:24:00,675
- All right.
- Thanks.

1618
02:24:02,590 --> 02:24:04,679
You was being true and honest
when you said that shit

1619
02:24:04,723 --> 02:24:06,594
about your baby girl
getting attacked

1620
02:24:07,464 --> 02:24:09,118
and your wife with her mess?

1621
02:24:09,771 --> 02:24:11,164
I was being honest.

1622
02:24:12,905 --> 02:24:14,297
All right. I'll give them some.

1623
02:24:14,602 --> 02:24:15,821
Forty percent.

1624
02:24:17,039 --> 02:24:18,388
They ain't getting 40.

1625
02:24:20,869 --> 02:24:22,479
But I'll take good care of them.

1626
02:25:00,604 --> 02:25:02,563
Sorry to put you
into these, cops,

1627
02:25:03,607 --> 02:25:05,522
but I can't be
finicky right now.

1628
02:25:18,971 --> 02:25:20,973
After all this
is finished, forgotten,

1629
02:25:21,843 --> 02:25:23,323
I'll come back
and bury you right.

1630
02:26:02,144 --> 02:26:03,276
Hey, Henry.

1631
02:26:05,104 --> 02:26:08,498
Oh, I could have Christopher
finish this in the guest room

1632
02:26:08,542 --> 02:26:10,196
- if you want.
- No problem, Ma.

1633
02:26:10,718 --> 02:26:13,242
I know you like to look at the
ocean when you get massaged.

1634
02:26:13,286 --> 02:26:14,287
Yes.

1635
02:26:15,941 --> 02:26:19,683
Oh, you had some stuff come in
the mail while you were gone.

1636
02:26:20,293 --> 02:26:21,773
I think it was your broker.

1637
02:26:22,425 --> 02:26:24,776
Been up too many hours
to look at numbers right now.

1638
02:26:25,298 --> 02:26:27,082
Ethan's home or at Jeremy's?

1639
02:26:27,735 --> 02:26:28,954
He's in the game room.

1640
02:26:29,606 --> 02:26:30,607
All right.

1641
02:26:32,174 --> 02:26:33,523
You want sushi for dinner?

1642
02:26:35,090 --> 02:26:37,179
I'll make you something
homemade if you want.

1643
02:26:38,877 --> 02:26:39,977
Thanks.

1644
02:26:40,226 --> 02:26:41,793
I would enjoy your cooking.

1645
02:27:00,463 --> 02:27:01,464
Your game good?

1646
02:27:04,772 --> 02:27:05,773
You done with everything?

1647
02:27:07,035 --> 02:27:08,080
Finally.

1648
02:27:09,298 --> 02:27:10,865
[reporter] The victims of the home invasion

1649
02:27:10,909 --> 02:27:12,817
that occurred in south-east
Bulwark Thursday night...

1650
02:27:12,824 --> 02:27:13,999
Hey, sweetie.

1651
02:27:15,478 --> 02:27:17,828
- There's a package downstairs--
- Close the door, please.

1652
02:27:17,829 --> 02:27:19,918
No suspect
for this violent crime

1653
02:27:19,961 --> 02:27:22,268
has been apprehended
at this time.

1654
02:27:22,311 --> 02:27:24,618
The police commissioner
has neither confirmed...

1655
02:27:24,661 --> 02:27:25,662
I think it's from Dad.

1656
02:27:30,667 --> 02:27:32,321
What does
the return address say?

1657
02:27:33,018 --> 02:27:34,889
It says Ridgeman and a PO Box.

1658
02:27:35,934 --> 02:27:37,283
Let me have it, please.

1659
02:27:43,245 --> 02:27:44,856
Oh, God. This is heavy.

1660
02:27:46,161 --> 02:27:48,468
- I can help you open it.
- Uh, no, no.

1661
02:27:49,121 --> 02:27:52,298
It's addressed to me, and I want
to open it myself, in private.

1662
02:27:52,820 --> 02:27:55,083
- Mom, I wanna--
- Sara, please.

1663
02:27:58,608 --> 02:27:59,479
Okay.

1664
02:28:00,959 --> 02:28:03,559
I wasn't able to cook tonight
so I ordered Chinese.

1665
02:28:03,657 --> 02:28:05,441
- Okay.
- Kiss.

1666
02:29:05,197 --> 02:29:06,241
Thank you.

1667
02:29:14,336 --> 02:29:15,495
Pause this.

1668
02:29:19,167 --> 02:29:20,952
When I was out
mailing that package,

1669
02:29:21,822 --> 02:29:24,390
I start thinking about that game

1670
02:29:24,433 --> 02:29:28,220
we was playing right before
everything changed for us,

1671
02:29:29,308 --> 02:29:30,570
the one in the jungle.

1672
02:29:31,745 --> 02:29:32,746
You still got it?

1673
02:29:34,139 --> 02:29:35,444
Shotgun Safari?

1674
02:29:37,316 --> 02:29:38,447
Yeah.

1675
02:29:43,278 --> 02:29:44,473
You ready?

1676
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:48,414
Yeah.

1677
02:29:49,589 --> 02:29:51,584
Let's hunt some lions.
