00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:54,539
小学的时候我们都是洛伦佐老师班上的

2
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,705

你有想过要做点几别的吗

换个另外的工作什么的?

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,404
我在超市干过一段时间

00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,580
我有好长时间没有看过女人的身体了
I've had a Iong intermission.

12
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,623
我周二要找安德烈谈一谈

如果有空缺的职位你会感兴趣吗

四处走走 呼吸一些新鲜空气 凝望蓝天
Walk around, breathe some air, gaze at the sky,

18
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,683

他又不是小孩了

但是她睡觉时候不戴

159
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,609
这个胖子看起来就是那种睡觉打呼噜的
He Iooks Iike a snorer.

160

那叫睡眠呼吸中止症

- Oh. Come on. Come on, man. - This Will be snug.

165
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,258
紧的我的血液都不流通 了
Shit, that's cutting off my circulation.

166
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,635
我们会在你腿变紫色之前回来
We'‖ be back before your foot turns blue.

167
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,628
别抱太大希望

168
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,193
比我住的地方好多 了
A Iot nicer than my place.

我有个表弟就是干这个的

174
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,346
把瓦斯克兹铐上了吗?
Vasquez a shackle?

175
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,219
铐在消防通道了
On the fire escape.

176
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,683
他的聋子女友还在里面
His deaf girlfriend's in here.

177
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,190
你们要枪击她吗?

178
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,313
- 她有枪吗 - 十有八九是有的
- She's got a gun. - 75-percent chance, yeah.

179
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,614

他就应该让 "水管工” 进来的
Should've let the plumber ín.

182
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,513
我们是警察
Police. Okay?

183
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,890
能听懂吗
Comprende Si or no?

184
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,180
她的包有点儿沉
Her handbag seemed a little heavy.

185
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,816
拉美洲女人的化妆品都很多

186
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,902
- 你有考虑进去吗? - 就算有也不可能这么重
- Latinas carry? - Yeah, even sti‖.

187
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,694
包里有枪
She's got a gun.

188
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,422
宝贝 过来
Come on. Come on, honey.

189
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,289
在这儿别动
You stay there.

190
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,466
把门关上 风扇开到最大
Why don't you shut the doors and crank up the fans?

191
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,565
你男朋友昨晚交给你的绿色帆布袋
Where did your novío put that green duffel bag

192
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,733
放哪儿了?

193
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,403
能给我件衣服穿吗?
Can l haVe something to Wear?

194
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,526
我冷
l'm cold.

195
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,281
我没听懂他说的 你听懂了么
l didn't understand that, did you?

196
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,248
没有
No.

197
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,417
她好像在说 “海豚” 什么的
Sounded kind of like dolphin.

198
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,915
如果她能老实回答我们的问题
l eXpect she'‖ get more intelligible

199
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,333
或许她说的话会更好懂一些
When she ansWers 0ur questions.

200
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,291
- 绿的帆布袋在哪儿 - 我要见我的律师
- Where's the green duffel bag? - l'm gonna call a IaWyer.

201
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,718
我想
I Wannam

202
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,466
绿帆布袋在哪儿
Where's the green duffel bag?

203
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,763
我们亲眼看见瓦斯克兹 昨晚十一点把它带到这儿来了
We saW Vasquez bring it here Iast níght at 11:O0,

204
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,890
就是那个要抛弃你 自己逃跑的混蛋
that sWe‖ guy Who fled and Ieft you here With us.

205
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,361
选择灵魂伴侣
You see, a timem

206
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,774
还需谨慎
...to get a soulmate.

207
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,617
趁我和我搭档
Tell us Where it is

208
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,702
还能赶上波尔特家的早餐特供
and my partner and l Will be done in time

209
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,621
赶快把帆布袋的位置告诉我们
to get the breakfast special at Bert's.

210
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,328
也许我们能网开一面 不去追究你的责任
Maybe that's reason enough to forget a‖ about you

211
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,671
你包里的枪我们也权当没看见
and that gun of yours.

212
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,839
它在哪儿?
Where is it?

213
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,430
衣橱里
The closet.

214
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,682
那边
There.

215
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,358
在西装后面的墙里
ln the Wa‖ behind the suits.

216
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,958
我己经能闻到双面煎蛋的香昧了
l smell three eggs over easy.

217
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,338
还有土豆泥
Hash brownsm

218
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,386
还有全麦面包土司
and pumpernickel toast.

219
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,634
还有你欠我的那杯咖啡
Plus that coffee you oWe me.

220
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,358
- 警宫 - 警探?
- Officer. - DeteCflVe?

221
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,486
把瓦斯克兹押进来
Drag VasqueZ back inside.

222
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,783
我们要把赃款 毒品和这两个笨蛋
We got cash, narcotics, and tWo imbeciles

223
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,406
带回局里并且具结画押
to drive doWntoWn and paper.

224
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,874
你答应我的 如果我告诉你东西在哪儿就放了我的
You said íf l told you Where the bag Was you'‖ let me go.

225
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,087
- 你能听懂她说什么吗 - 不能
- Can you understand her? - No.

226
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,733
这歌是男的还是女的唱的
This a guy or a girl singing this song?

227
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,618
不好说
Can't te‖.

228
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,751
反正这年代是男是女已经不重要 了
Not that there's much of a difference these days.

229
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,375
我觉得底线已经没有 了
lthink that Iine Was obliterated.

230
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,874
自从男人开始说我们怀孕 了” 那天起 底线消失了
The day men started saying, "We're pregnant,"

231
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,467
但真正怀孕的是他们的老婆
When their Wives Were.

232
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,554
你们的早餐特供
Your breakfast specials.

233
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,520
谢谢
Thanks.

234
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,911
没想到警督对这些谣言这么感兴趣
Didn't knoW the Chief Lieutenant Was so fond of intrigue.

235
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,904
不好意思
Excuse me.

236
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,921
麻烦您帮我们打包一下 好吗?
Could you boX our food up in to-go containers?

237
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,500
我刚刚那么费劲地把餐盘给你们拿过来
You Want me to pack up everything

238
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,840
你们现在居然要我打包?
ljust carried from all the Way oVer there?

239
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,753
正确
Correct.

240
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,928
我去拿打包盒
l'Il get some take-out boXes.

241
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,151
你们俩是开车撞进早餐店了吗 身上一股食物的味道
You tW0 crashed into a truck filled With breakfast buffet?

242
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,186
我们俩刚才在波尔特家吃早餐特供
We Were getting the breakfast specials at Bert's

243
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,187
然后就收到了你的消息
When We got your message

244
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,532
我们就让服务员打包了 开车来的路上也反思了很久
and We boxed them up and rode in With the ruminations.

245
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,996
我很喜欢他家的面包土司
l Iike their pumpernickel toast.

246
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,658
他们是街对面的面包店
They get it fresh from 」eanette's,

247
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,700
珍妮特糕点买的
bakery across the Way.

248
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,543
你们俩今夭早的逮捕行动出问题了
There's an issue With the bust you tWo made this morning.

249
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,460
谁又投诉了
Who's complaining?

250
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,629
群众反映的 他们看见你们俩在消防通道上
Civílian, saW you out on the fire escape.

251
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,003
瓦斯克兹荷枪实弹是一个实实在在的威胁
Vasquez Was armed and a threat.

252
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,721
- 我们的做法没错 - 他拍了录像
- We did What Wasm - There's a Video.

253
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,561
你看过了吗
You've seen it?

254
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,143
看了 不算太糟
I have. lt's not terrible.

255
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,059
但也不算太妙
Certainly could be much, much better.

256
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,565
好在收音效果很烂
Sound is shit.

257
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,188
那个市民离现场很远 没录到什么关键信息
Civílian Was too far aWay to get anything inte‖igible.

258
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,608
- 这对我们来说是个好事儿 - 谁告的密
- That helps us. - Who tipped you off?

259
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,731
我在第七频道的联系人
My contact at Channel 7.

260
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,699
河边无青草 哪来的多嘴驴
Anchovies.

261
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,043
- 节目什么时候播出 - 六点
- When's it airing? - Six o'clock.

262
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,909
你们死不了
You'Il survive.

263
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:13,257
不过 我们之前谈的升职加薪的事情
Though, l think it'll end our current discussions

264
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,717
可能就得缓一缓了
about raises and promotions.

265
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,712
干他妈的多嘴驴
Anchovies.

266
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,136
我们没太为难瓦斯克兹
We didn't give Vasquez that much cast-iron.

267
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,760
- 主要是我 安东尼他...- 他也没少使坏
- lt Was mostly me, Anthonym - He gave him plenty.

268
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,066
卢拉赛提先生也在视频里
Mr. Lurasetti's in that video, too,

269
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,191
当你把脚踩在那位仁兄的脸上时
smiling Iíke a yearbook picture

270
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,777
他在旁边笑的跟花儿似的
When you put your foot on that hombrek cabeza

271
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,612
咱们的督察员
Our inspectorm

272
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,781
就是那位墨西哥裔的督察员 好像对此非常不满
our MeXican-American inspector, is unlikely to be Ienient.

273
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,032
虽然你们的办案效率非常值得褒奖 但这也只能让你们
Though your productivity is eXemplary and it'‖ keep you

274
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,533
免于丢掉工作
from Iosing your badges.

275
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,665
就像以前一样 还是政治问题
Politics like alWays.

276
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,001
就跟手机一样 处处扰人
Like cell phones andjust as annoying,

277
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,174
但却无处不在
politics are everyWhere.

278
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,174
被舆论定下种族歧视的罪名
Being branded a racist in today's public forum

279
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,723
就像在50年代被指控为共产主义分子一样要命
is Iike being accused of communism in the '50s

280
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,184
不论你只是在手机上发表了一条
Whether it's a possibly offensive remark

281
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,185
带有冒犯色彩的言论 还是你真的实施了类似
made in a private phone ca‖ 0r the indelicate treatment

282
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,609
卖毒品给小孩这样的龌龊行为
of a minority Who se‖s drugs to children.

283
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,946
像这种娱乐产业 特别是新闻
The entertainment industry, formerly knoWn as the neWs,

284
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,319
- 需要这样的恶人来当反面教材 - 这些媒体
- needs vi‖ains. - There's certainly nothing

285
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,162
就喜欢断章取义 妄下结论 随便给人贴标签
hypocritical about the media handling every perceived

286
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,033
这可真是一种伪善的做法啊
intolerance With complete and utter intolerance.

287
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,335
简直就是胡来
lt's bu‖shit.

288
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,630
可这就是现实
But it's reality.

289
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,215
但我不是种族主义者
But l'm not racist.

290
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,670
就连每个马丁路德金日我都会点一杯焦糖咖啡呢
Every Martin Luther King Day l order a cup of dark roast.

291
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,887
这次停职多久
HoW long is this suspension gonna be?

292
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,969
6个星期
Six Weeks.

293
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,145
不带薪
No pay.

294
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,027
工作时长得给我们算上
We need the hours.

295
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,862
这个不用你教 我懂
l knoW What detectives make and more.

296
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,840
去吃点面包吧
Go have some pumpernickeL

297
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:28,895
瑞支曼
Ridgeman.

298
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,012
以后你得注意一点了
Gotta be aWare of this stuff.

299
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,806
现在到处都是摄像头
Digital eyes are everyWhere.

300
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,737
我出去执行任务的时候的所作所为都是我认为最合适的
ldo What l think best When l'm out there.

301
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,774
我们之前搭档 的时候 我就这样
l Was that Way When We Were partners

302
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,032
现在我也没变
and l'm still that Way noW.

303
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,946
这就是为什么我坐在这个桌子里面当领导
There's a reason I'm sitting behind this desk running things

304
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,029
而你只能跟一个比你小四岁的搭档在这么冷的天
and you're out there crouching on fire escapes

305
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,871
爬上消防道执行任务
in the cold for hours

306
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,707
这都是有原因的
With a partner that's 20 years younger than you.

307
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,703
嘿 安东尼虽然满嘴跑火车 但他是个老实人
Hey, Anthony's got a mouth With its oWn engine but he's solid.

308
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,208
这不是我想说的重点
That Wasn't my point.

309
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,384
感谢你把这个情况提前告知我们
Thanks for Ietting us knoW about this situation

310
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,057
如果你能在督察员那里 帮我们说说好话的话
and any Word you can have With the inspector on our behalf

311
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,145
那就真是感激不尽
Would be greatly appreciated.

312
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,943
在你走之前 还有一个事儿
One thing before you go.

313
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,732
我看了那个视频很多遍
l Watched that Video a couple times.

314
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,154
你有好几次都采取了没有必要的镇压措施
You threW a Iot more cast-iron than you needed to.

315
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,746
我们之前搭档的时候
And When We Worked togetherm

316
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,911
你也没有这么强硬啊
you Weren't that rough.

317
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,367
所以呢
And?

318
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,829
一直负重前行
lt's not healthy for you

319
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,206
对你来说不健康
to scuff concrete as Iong as you have.

320
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,171
虽然这么做得到了你想要的结果
You get results,

321
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,921
但同 时你会失去明察事理的能力和怜悯心
but you're losing perspective and compassion.

322
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,969
再过几年 你就会变成一个满身是刺
Couple more years out there and you're gonna be

323
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,809
以愤怒为燃料 只会以强硬措施打压他人的
a human steamroller covered Wíth spikesm

324
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,429
破案机器
and fueled by bile.

325
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,390
外面要抓的坏蛋可多了去了
There's a Iot of imbeciles out there.

326
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,854
好吧
Yeah.

327
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,293
好好利用这段时间 想想我说的这些话
Use your time off to think about things.

328
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,329
跟梅拉妮聊聊这事儿

Well, yeah. But it's gonna be pretty hard

364

不一样的世界

397
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,519
安德雷这个人本身就挺不可信的
Andrei himself is questionable.

398
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,696
你带 "安保工具”了吗

操蛋的社区
This fucking neighborhood,

440
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,193
情况真是越来越糟 了
itjust keeps getting Worse and Worse.

441
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,937
- 她没事儿吧 - 没什么大事儿 不过
- Is she okay? - We‖, yeah. But,

442
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,530
让她放学后走4个街区的路回家 已经很辛苦了
coming home from school and Walking four blocks

443
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,617
- 现在还碰上这种事 - 我知道

446
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:42,037
她知道要我走这么远的路很不方便
She knoWs it isn't easy for me to get around a lot

447
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,411
而且我去了 她也会尴尬
and she'd be too embarrassed anyWays.

448
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,633
老爸老妈都是警察 她这么要强不是没有道理
We‖, she's got tWo sets of cop DNA, so of course she's tough.

449
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,719
是啊 特别是考虑到她的性别和现在的年纪
Yeah, especially for her age and gender.

450
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,046
她再长大一点 会变得更有女人味
But she's getting older, more Womanly.

451
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,720

And these boys are gonna start haVing different kinds of ideas

452
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,763

455
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,695
我跟其他退役警察不同 我的思想非常开朗 可现在...

00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,274
你就会冒出来更多的问题
is gonna engender three times as many questions.

549
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,068
我想趁现在补会觉
Let me sleep While l can and

550
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,073
到了目的地后 你的所有问题就会迎刃而解
once We're there, you'll get your ansWers

551
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,484
到时候你想补个觉也行
and a nap if you need one.

552
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,990
听起来像一个监视任务
Sounds Iike a stake out.

553
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,284
快去柏大道布朗特街
19th and Brant.

554
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,957
我们被停职了 你不会忘了吧
You realize We're suspended

555
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,374
到十八大道的时候 叫醒我
Wake me at 18th.

556
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,319
到十八大道了
We're at 18th.

557
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,658
前面右拐
Corner right.

558
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,339
先擦擦手
Before you touch anything.

559
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,099
垃圾桶
Ash tray.

560
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,976
我公寓附近也开了一家这种橘色商店
One of these big orange things opened up by my apartment

561
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,145
"每日鲜"
Ripe and Fresh.

562
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,482
- 很差劲吗 - 我没去逛过
- Shit? - l haVen't been in it.

563
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,371
德尼斯不是要做饭吗
lthought Denise cooked.

564
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,154
只在她家做
Only at her place.

565
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,125
她买食材只去那种有机商店
She only shops at organic stores

566
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,380
能够稍微减轻一些摄取热量的负罪感
that specialize in assuaging guilt.

567
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,380
停在这个垃圾桶的对面
Let's pull over the other side of this dumpster.

568
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,772
- 可以吗 - 完美
- ls this good? - It's perfect

569
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,277
吃两粒吧
Take tW0.

570
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:58,421
那栋灰色建筑里的633号房有蹊跷
Something's going on in Room 633 of that tan stucco.

571
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,335
什么蹊跷
What?

572
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,553
难说
Hard to te‖.

573
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,430
主要是因为那栋楼里根本就没有633号房
Especially because Apartment 633 doesn't even eXist.

574
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,725
此话怎讲
H0W do you mean?

575
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,725
那栋楼里没有633这个门牌
Well, there's no door marked 633.

576
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,648
没有窗户也没有 门铃
There's no WindoWs or a buzzen

577
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,442
甚至没有邮件曾邮寄过这个地方
No mail gets delivered there either.

578
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,823
但那个房间却存在
But it's there.

579
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,282
这听起来有点玄乎啊
This ís sounding metaphysicaL

580
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,076
你有线索吗
You got a tip on this?

581
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,532
有
Yeah.

582
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,795
我的线人告诉我 一个叫洛伦兹 沃格曼的人
My contact te‖s me that one Lorentz Vogelmann

583
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,834
正在找一处隐形住宅
is looking for an invisible residence.

584
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,756
这栋楼里的633号房就是他的根据地
And 633 in this tan stucco is Where he Ianded.

585
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,593
沃格曼 没听说过这个名字
Vogelmann, l don't knoW that name.

586
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,598
他不是本地人
Well, he's not local.

587
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,472
他干什么的
What Iine of Work is he in?

588
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,391
毒贩
Distribution.

589
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,439
主要分销海洛因
Heroin mostly.

590
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,694
数额巨大
Large bundles.

591
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,614
咱们来这儿干什么
What are We doing here?

592
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,323
你是以平民的身份问我这个问题吗
You asking me this question as a civilian?

593
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,325
因为这就是现实 我们就是平民
Because that's What We are right noW, civilians.

594
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,578
跟那些幼儿园老师 或者在我家门口
N0 different than kindergarten teachers or the bum

595
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,625
捡易拉罐的流浪汉亳无差别
that collects aluminum cans outside my buílding.

596
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,623
咋天我把警徽给上交了我又不是忘了
l knoW Where l flung my badge yesterday.

597
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,168
到底咱们来这干什么
What are We doing here?

598
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,337
我们正在监视一个嫌疑人
We're monitoring a suspicious individual

599
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,887
看他是否拥有一笔目前还用不上的资金
to try and figure out if he's got any money he doesn't need.

600
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,558
简直吃饱了撑的
Anchovies.

601
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,574
- 你要是不想干 - 天哪
- If you don't Wanna be part of... - Christ.

602
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,699
你疯了吗
Are you ínsane?

603
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,454
你被停职了 而且这己经不是你职业生涯中
You get suspended, not for the first time

604
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,450
第一次被停职了
in your career either.

605
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,207
现在你居然还想变成一个罪犯?
NoW you decide to become a criminal?

606
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,419
你到底在打什么主意?
And What the hell are you even thinking With this?

607
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,378
嗯
We‖...

608
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,681
解释一下
Say something.

609
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:12,889
说话
Talkl

610
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,729
我还有一个月就60岁了
l'm a month aWay from my 60th...

611
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,031
我的官衔却停留在了我27岁那年
l'm still the same rank l Was at 27.

612
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,864
多年来 我一直相信只要保证工作质量
For a Iot of years, l believed that the quality of my Work,

613
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,281
好好跟你合作 跟我之前的搭档合作
What We do togethen What l did With my previous partnersm

614
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,488
能够让我获得我应得的回报
Would get me What I deserved.

615
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,744
但是我不会说场面话 也不懂得与时俱进
But I don't politic and l don't change With the times.

616
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,711
结果发现 原来这些虚的比诚恳的工作
And it turns out that that shit's more important

617
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,955
更重要
than good honest Work.

618
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,631
所以昨天我们虽然阻止了一场
So yesterday, after We stop a massive amount of drugs

619
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,424
大量毒品流入学校的犯罪事件
from getting into the school system,

620
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,764
我们还是被停职了 就因为我们的做法"不礼貌”
We get suspended because it Wasn't done politely.

621
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,431
我回家后 发现我女儿经历了这两年来的
When l go home and l find my daughter has been assaulted

622
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,973
第五次被骚扰
for the fifth time in tWo years

623
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,639
全都是因为我这少得可怜的工资
Because of the shit neighborhood

624
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,686
被追让她生活在那个糟糕的社区
my shit Wage has forced me to Iive in.

625
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,601
而我的妻子根本帮不上忙
And my Wife can't help.

626
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,479
她现在只能勉强依靠药物维持生活
She's barely getting through the day on her meds as it is.

627
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,856
她们没事吧
They okay?

628
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,820
梅拉妮还应付得了 萨拉心态也很好
Yeah. Melanie's coping. Sara's doing okay.

629
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,413
好在她比同龄人要成熟很多
She's dealing With it better than most kids her age Would.

630
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,575
不过这样长期下去 谁知道会对她的
But Who knoWs What kind of long-term damage

631
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,622
身心造成多大的伤 害
is going on With her.

632
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,802
以前类似的机会有很多 还不是一次两次
There has been opportunities before, more than a feW.

633
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,428
受贿 贪污 顺手牵羊
Take a bribe, pocket a bundle, pilfer cash.

634
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,098
我以前是一个出外勤警察 现如今我只是一个年近60的
lWas a cop on actiVe duty. Today, l'm a poor civilian

635
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,771
可怜平民
Who's nearly 60.

636
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,767
我能接受贫穷
l can accept that,

637
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,986
但是我不能让我的妻子女儿和我一起承受
but l'm not gonna ask my Wife and daughter to.

638
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,025
要是把我们俩一起破过的案子
lf We put a‖ our collars togethen

639
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,697
一起抓到的罪犯加在一起
every imbecile We ever nabbed,

640
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,949
差不多都够关满州监狱的两间大牢房了
it'd probably fill tWo entire Wings

641
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,868
甚至是3间
of the state prison. Maybe three.

642
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:03,329
我们有实力 也有权利 要求适当的补偿
We have the skills and the right to acquire proper compensation.

643
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,094
- 天哪 - 结婚可不便宜
- Christ. - Weddings aren't cheap.

644
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,839
少犯浑了 我想的不是这个问题
Don't be an asshole. That's not What l'm thinking about

645
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,058
你觉得 我们现在的工资和我们的付出成正比吗
Do you think our Wages accurately reflect What We did?

646
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,562
别跟我说这些
Enough With thejustifications.

647
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,098
我比你聪明多了
I'm smarter than you by a yard stick,

648
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,562
休想给我洗脑
you're not gonna manipulate me.

649
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,891
我看到了你昨天看那个帆布袋的眼神
l saW hoW you looked at that duffel bag yesterday.

650
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,396
闭嘴
Quiet.

651
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,773
让我想想
Let me think.

652
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,704
巧舌如簧
Anchovies.

653
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,036
如果你不想再听到我说这些
Look, if you don't Wanna hear any more about this,

654
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,705
你可以马上开车 把我扔在这里
fling the gear and drop me off.

655
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,170
- 我不想让你受伤 - 我不需要保镖
- l don't Want you to get hurt. - l don't need a guardian.

656
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,918
如果可以的话 我一个人也能干
l can do this myself ifl have to.

657
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:51,884
那可不一定
You don't knoW that.

658
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,842
没错 是不一定会成功 但如果情况有变
Not for sure, no. But if things get tricky,

659
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,590
我能立马抽身 再想其他办法
I'll disengage and find something else.

660
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,593
这不是个好主意
This is a bad idea.

661
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,513
对你 对我都不好
lt's bad for you, and it's bad for me.

662
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,982
这个主意简直是烂到无以复加
lt's bad Iíke lasagna in a can.

663
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,562
那就开车吧 把我一个人扔在这里就行
Well, then, fling the gear and drop me off.

664
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,867
如果你要干 你一定要为自己而干
Lo0k, if you do this, you do ít for yourself.

665
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,583
不用同情我的处境 然后选择加入
You don't do it because you pity my situation.

666
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,669
也不能因为我们是搭档 或者我们是一起在周日
Or because We're partners or because We're friends

667
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,083
烤汉堡 一起练拳击的朋友才选择加入
that grill burgers on Sundays, or go t0 the fights.

668
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:33,423
你必须是因为你自己也想赚钱才选择加入的
You do it solely because you Wanna earn. And that's it.

669
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,773
我们在行动的时候必须乔装改扮
We disguise ourselves at the point of contact

670
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,103
我在垃圾袋里 防弹面具与防弹背心
Yeah, I got ballistic masks and vests in the garbage bags,

671
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,775
还有几颗催泪弹
some teargas bombs as We‖.

672
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,568
那我暂时加入吧
l'm in until l'm not.

673
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,701
- 洛伦兹 沃格曼 - 对
- Lorentz Vogelmann? - Yeah.

674
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,921
他看起来是个强硬派
He looks cast iron.

675
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:14,964
对
He is.

676
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,969
你确定他的货都藏在633号房吲
Any idea if his merchandise is in 633?

677
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,894
不确定 但一旦我们确认他就住在这里
No idea, but after We confirm that he's there,

678
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,479
我们就可以尾随他 进而掌握他的行程轨迹
We'Il tail him and We'll Iearn his itinerary.

679
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,772
你有时间表吗
You got a timeframe?

680
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,989
我的线人说他交了两个星期的租金

你快睡一会吧
Why don't you take a nap?

687
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,165
求之不得
Gladly_

688
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,715
醒了记得问问我还要不要和你一起干
Make sure to ask me if l'm still in When l Wake up.

689
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,751
我都快睡了五个小时了
l'Ve been processing here for five hours.

690
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,250
你应该叫 醒我的
You should have given me a nudge.

691
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,671
没这个必要
There Wasn't a reason to.

692
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,802
你还加入吗
Are you still in?

693
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,507
暂时加入
Iam until l'm not.

694
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,885
- 看见沃格曼了吗 - 还没有
- You see Vogelmann yet? - Nope.

695
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,196
我要去那个橘色便利店买点东西
l'm gonna get something from this big orange thing.

696
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,704
你要加了蛋黄酱的黑麦吐司 吗
You Want egg salad on rye toast?

697
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,242
帮我买两片外加一瓶沙士
TWo of them, and root beer.

698
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,146
阿门
Amen.

699
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,110
过去98分钟里 我一直在听你吧唧嘴的声音
l'Ve been Iistening to and sme‖ing that

700
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,828
还一直闻 到食物的昧道
for the last 98 minutes.

701
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,917
监视最爽的地方就是
Best part of a stake out,

702
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,336
除了最后任务结束的时候
other than When it endsm

703
00:57:38,323 --> 00:57:39,842
就是吃东西的 时候了
is When you're eating.

704
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,926
一只蚂蚁都比你吃的快一些
A single red ant could've eaten it faster.

705
00:57:59,017 --> 00:57:59,939
不是他
Nope.

706
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,243
吃两粒吧
Take tW0.

707
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,364
我还在享受口中的余味
I'm still enjoying the aftertaste.

708
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,658
我一点都不享受
Not all of us are.

709
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,429
你把车停哪儿了
Where did you park?

710
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,679
我就说吧 你越来越健忘了
I've been telling you, you're getting senile.

711
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,017
你没锁吗
You didn't Iock it?

712
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:35,887
我忘
I form

713
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,141
我之前在想其他的事 抱歉
IWas thínking about something else at the time. Sorry.

714
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,740
这是你的包?
This your duffel?

715
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,739
不是
Idon't think so.

716
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,124
面向挡风玻璃
Face the Wíndshield.

717
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,086
系上安全带 锁好车门
Put on your seat belts and lock the doors.

718
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:15,969
帕科
Pacom

719
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,474
麻烦你把遮阳布拉上
put up that sunshade, por favon

720
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,284
很好 现在把口袋里的钱都拿出来
Good. NoW empty your pockets.

721
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,994
把所有东西都放到包里
Put everything in that duffel bag,

722
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,080
不然我就送你去见上帝
or you'll be painting houses in heaven.

723
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,118
求你不要杀我
No, please.

724
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,293
给你们5秒
You have five seconds.

725
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,284
5
Fourm

- Threem - That's a‖ l got.

727
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,792
我也是 我发誓
l\/le to0, I sWear to God.

728
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,789
把口袋翻出来看看
Show me your pocket Whites.

729
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,803
看见了吗
See?

730
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,930
把手机关了
Shut off that phone.

731
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,135
再见
Bye.

732
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,099
我还以为你
I expected youm

733
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,361
你要
You'Il f...

734
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,161
彻底没气了
Airless.

735
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,216
请允许我为你展示一下车的内部状况
Please, a‖oW me to shoW you the ínterior.

736
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,426
如果里面有活物
If anything moves in there,

737
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,546
老鼠
a 「at, a mOUSe,

738
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,263
或者蚊子
a baby mosquito,

739
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,429
我就送你去见阿拉
you'll get to ring A‖ah's doorbe‖.

740
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,446
把引擎盖打开
P0p the hood.

741
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,560
还满意吗?
All is as expected?

742
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,292
这血是附送的吗
The blood is gratis.

743
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,124
钥匙
Keys.

744
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,137
布雷特 是你吗
Brett, that you?

745
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,676
是的
Confirmed.

746
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:47,191
看看衣柜里 我给你准备了一个惊喜
Look in the closet, I got you something.

747
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,444
试试看
Try it on.

748
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,123
你买的都很合身
Everything you get me fits perfect

749
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,299
谢谢你帮我买衣服
Thanks for getting it.

750
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,135
在床上谢我吧
Thank me in bed.

751
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:34,065
你们今天有去欺负那些有色族裔的人吗?
S0, did you guys beat up any minorities today?

752
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,316
我们只有在执行任务的的时候才这么干
That's only When We're on the clock.

753
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:40,237
- 这个太好吃了 - 你喜欢就好
- This Was really delicious. - Glad you Iiked it.

754
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,781
考虑到你现在这种沉默寡言的状态
And should l infer from your reticence

755
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,371
我推测这一次你又不方便谈论你的工作吧?
this is one of those times you can't talk about your Work?

756
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,367
得了吧 我哪有沉默寡言
Please, infer about my reticence.

757
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,248
虽然你被停职了
Even though you've been suspended

758
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,713
但严格来讲 你普通人的身份没被剥夺吧?
and you're technically a civilian?

759
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,795
罪犯不会因为两个誓察被停职
Criminals don't stop doing What they do

760
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,293
就不再犯罪了
just 'cause tWo cops get benched.

761
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,262
而且我们警察也不是为了拿工资才接受这份工作的
And We don't do What We dojust for the paycheck.

762
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:06,725
怎么了
What?

763
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,225
别拿这种哄小孩的话来搪塞比你聪明的人
Don't try and bluff somebody Who's smarter than you are.

764
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,062
我可比你聪明多了
Smarter by a yardstick.

765
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,653
你有没有看到我从西奥伦佐家买了奶油煎饼卷?
Did you see l brought cannolis from Theo Renzo's?

766
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:26,075
别做自毁前途的事就好
Just don't do anything tojeopardize your career, please.

767
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,239
我不会的
lWon't.

768
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,628
还有7个车位没人用
Seven unaccounted for.

769
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:44,346
如果沃格曼真的住在那个楼里
lf Vogelmann's in that tan stucco

770
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,557
他有车的话 其中一个车位一定是他的
and oWns a vehicle, one of them is his.

771
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,773
你没打退堂鼓吧
Are you still in?

772
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,770
己经在要退不退的边缘了
At the outermost edge.

773
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,485
因为德尼斯
Denise?

774
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,284
她好像猜到了我有什么事瞒着她
She guessed that something Wasn't right.

775
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,495
我只字未提
Ididn't say anything.

776
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,453
所以昵
So?

777
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,499
我己经把订婚戒指了取回来了
Picked up the engagement ríng.

778
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:16,791
- 从费因鲍姆珠宝店? - 对
- From Feinbaum? - Yeah.

779
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,539
行吧

780
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,588
我们被停职那天去取的
Got it the day We busted, uh, Vasquez andm

781
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,677
时机不算太好但是...
We‖, the timing Wasn't great, butm

782
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,130
我想着这个婚早晚都要求 我不想因为工作上的不顺
IWas gonna propose anyWay, I Wasn't gonna let some

783
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,559
来影响我的个人生活 结果...
Work bullshit interfere With my private Iife, but turned outm

784
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:32,474
那晚她碰巧因为工作上的一些纠纷
she Was in a bad mood that night

785
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,775
心情非常的不好 所以我没有求
because of some drama at herjob, and l didn't do it.

786
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:39,651
然后昨天你又把我带到这几来 提议干这个事儿
And then yesterday you bring me here, suggest this thing,

787
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,779
虽然我并不抗拒 我感觉从那些
and l'm sort of okay With the idea,

788
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,194
人渣毒贩手里抢些钱 也算不上伤天害理的事
us taking money off some fuckhead dealer.

789
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,742
如果风险不是很大的话
lf the risk isn't too great.

790
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,284
但昨天晚上
But, you knoW, that night,

791
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:54,121
当我看见德尼斯 在她起疑心之前
When I see Denise, even before she suspected anythingm

792
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,335
我就意识到必须等到这一切结束 我才能向她求婚
l knoW that I can't propose to her until this thing is done.

793
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,628
我当时回避了她的问题 自我从珠宝店回来之后
I evade her questions at dinner and for the first time

794
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,342
只有在那一刻
since I Went to the jewelerm

795
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,796
我才突然动摇了 怀疑她是否会答应我的求婚
I'm n0t certain she'd say yes ifl proposed.

796
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,718
好了 我送你回家
Yeah. I'm driving you home.

797
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,432
我还没做好决定昵 我只是在犹豫...
l haven't made a decision yet. l'mjust ponderingm

798
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:17,398
放屁 你早就心里做好决定了
Bu‖shit. You're decíded, even if you think you aren't.

799
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,652
你比我年轻 你有更多的选择
You're younger than me, you've got more options.

800
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,521
等我们复职之后 你就申请换一个新搭档
Request a neW partner When We're back on duty,

801
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,398
说不定你以后还能混个巡官当当
they'll probably make you a sergeant one day.

802
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,741
我不想换搭档
l don't Want a neW partner.

803
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:28,700
我也跟你说过 我要跟你一起完成这项任务
And l told you that l'd finish out the shift

804
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,862
我很感激 但是你没有义务和责任非要这么做
Yeah, l appreciate it. But look, you're not obligated.

805
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:33,410
- 我别无选择 - 我的口头承诺就是一种责任
- I haVe done it Withm - My Word is an obligation.

806
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:37,785
谢谢
Thanks.

807
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,380
两片蛋黄酱面包
TWo egg salads,

808
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,379
如果你不买生香肠 你的那份我就请了
and I'II pay for yours, too, if it's not Sobrasada.

809
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,554
来车了
Here's one.

810
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,599
他在停车
This guy's parking.

811
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,821
这两个人看起来很可疑
These brothers have seen some stuff.

812
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,415
嗯 他们有问题
Yeah, they're taínted.

813
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,495
你觉得他们是沃格曼的人吗
Think they're With Vogelmann?

814
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,917
还是他的买家
His buyers?

815
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,424
有20%的可能性 但也有可能是中间人
TWenty-percent. Go-betWeens or Iocal muscles

816
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,759
或者打手
probably more like it.

817
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,593
再买两杯沙士
And tWo root beers.

818
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:48,715
没有退路了
No choice.

819
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:53,633
瑞支曼
Ridgeman?

820
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,684
- 是沃格曼吗 - 对
- Vogelmann? - Yeah.

821
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:00,769
还有之前的那两个黑人
The black dudes We saW before.

822
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,709
他们往西走了
They're going West.

823
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,337
你确定吗
Are you sure?

824
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,556
这辆破车需要上点润滑油 了
The grey lady needs a decongestant

825
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,066
开慢点 不要打草惊蛇
Don't giVe 'em a Wedgie.

826
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,485
现在减速的话反倒会引起他们的怀疑
Driving any sloWer than this Will get us noticed.

827
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,697
这片儿我不熟 西面到底有什么
l don't knoW this area real We‖. What's West?

828
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,073
再往前面开一截
Well, more of this.

829
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:04,541
就有一条高速公路之后是学区
Then the turnpike and then the school district.

830
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,791
希望他们不是大费周章去学校偷蜡笔
Probably not doing all this to steal crayons.

831
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,799
我们要不要先约法三章
You feel like some construction Work?

832
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,762
你觉得有必要吗
ls that necessary right noW?

833
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,094
没什么必要
FiVe percent

834
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,518
难道不需要为之后可能遇到的情况制定一个行为标准
That's for shooting out tires, sending a Warning,

835
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:23,385
比如交火 发出警告什么的?
things like that, right?

836
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,228
我们不会做出任何出格行为的
We're not going after any precedence.

837
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,894
我需要一个更肯定的答案
I need a better ansWer than that.

838
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,609
现在我们正驶向一片未知区域
Ríght noW, We're heading into neW territory.

839
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,229
期间我们可能会碰上任何情况我很清楚自己的底线
Foggy gray Iandscape, but l knoW all of my limits,

840
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,651
但是我不知道你的
but maybe not yours.

841
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,032
所以在我像参军的时候那样
So before l build a killing instrument

842
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,867
启动杀人模式之前
that l Iast used in the army,

843
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:42,447
我必须要你亲口保证在你实施抢劫的过程中
lwanna hear that you don't plan on executing a human being

844
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:43,959
你没有计划杀死任何一个人
to facilitate a robbery.

845
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,791
我们绝不杀人
We're not executing anybody.

846
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,041
好 这条准则必须用钢筋混凝土加固
That boundary is reinforced in steel concrete.

847
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,539
同意加固
Agreed. NoW, build.

848
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:21,448
他们在拼车车道那辆黑色SUV的旁边
The carpool Iane. Right by the black SUV.

849
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,701
把枪收起来 别走火了
Don't Iet that catch you cold.

850
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,595
你觉得他们今天是来交易的吗?
You think the transactions happened today?

851
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,058
看起来挺像
Oh, this is business.

852
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:48,228
两个行为可疑的黑人和另一个外地罪犯
TWo tainted black dudes and an out-of-toWn convict

853
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,143
在天亮前驱车外出
going for a drive before daWn.

854
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,017
虽然很有可能只是初步行动
Although it's probablyjust a preliminary.

855
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,983
沃格曼上车前 手里拿着两个黑色的公文包
Vogelmann Was carrying tWo black briefcases When he got in.

856
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,957
你还有什么事情是忘了告诉我的
ls there anything else you forgot to te‖ me?

857
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,248
- 没了 - 你确定
- No. - No. Are you sure?

858
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:13,291
比如说一些细节 比如那两个黑人中有人
Something subtle, Iike maybe one of the black dudes

859
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,789
- 带着火箭筒 -嘿
- had a bazooka? - Hey.

860
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,839
我盯了好几个小时的哨 而且你一直在打呼 我突然忘了嘛
IWas up for hours listening t0 you process air. lt escaped me.

861
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:22,212
行吧
Fine.

862
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,557
我想你应该全程都不叫醒我
And l suppose you could haVe Iet me sleep through all of this,

863
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:30,554
自己一个人把事情搞定
and been done With the Whole thíng.

864
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,774
我确实应该不叫醒你
l definitely should have.

865
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,739
考虑到公文包的出现
Considering the bríefcasesm

866
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:44,155
有百分之七十的概率他们今天要进行交易
seventy percent this is the transaction.

867
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,654
剩下的百分之三十昵
What's the other 30?

868
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:51,159
那个公文包里装的可能是现金 也可能是毒品
Vogelmann maybe shoWing somebody some cash, or some merchandise,

869
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,081
所以沃格曼要么是去卖毒品 要么就是去买
depending on Which end of the deal he's doing.

870
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:55,795
公文包
The briefcases?

871
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,718
金融区?
The financial district?

872
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:03,640
他们走这边干嘛
What's going on here?

873
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:05,718
你有什么想法吗
Any idea?

874
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,807
我的大脑正在飞速运转
l'm trying to flush the ideas l have

875
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,677
然而并不知道他们究竟在打什么算盘
'cause none of them seem to fit this.

876
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,165
施工中
Still under construction.

877
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:39,795
要我把天才奖寄绐你 还是直接亲手献上
Want me to mail or hand deliver your genius aWard?

878
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,363
厉害了
Nice.

879
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:12,948
真有型
Real stylish.

880
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,039
你要在把头染成基佬发型之前 说这句话?
You're saying this before you use your gay hair shit?

881
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,211
之后就说不出口了
Can't say it after.

882
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,175
要出去探探情况吗?
Time for a Walk by?

883
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,297
到5点45再说
At 5:45.

884
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,387
为什么
Why is that?

885
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,884
他们见面时间最有可能是定在5点半的 考虑到交易中的一方
Well, the nearest most Iikely time for a meet up is 5:30,

886
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,728
可能会出现迟到的情况 我们得把这个时间留出来
and We should alloW the other party room for tardiness.

887
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,352
除非沃格曼迟到了1 9分钟
Unless Vogelmann is 19 minutes Iate.

888
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,975
理论上是可能的 但是实际上不太可能
Possible, but not probable.

889
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,977
我一个人过去打探情况
And l'm doing the Walk by myself.

890
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,398
- 但是一般... - 你人在这儿心不在这儿
- Usua‖y... - You're barely here as it is.

891
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,239
我来承担风险
Any and every bigger risk We come upon is mine to take.

892
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,817
我先帮你弄
I'll do you first.

893
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:31,952
别搞砸了
Don't make no mess of it.

894
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,163
我之前可是涂鸦老手
l used to graffiti back in the day.

895
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:37,032
我还记得你的作品有多难看
And l remember What it Iooked like.

896
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,248
你自己什么水平 还好意思说我?
You Would knoW better yourself, you kn0W that?

897
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,962
我也就写写涂鸦字体
IWaS only doing tags.

898
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:44,085
口口声声说要创作艺术的人可是你
You Was the one trying to make art.

899
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:47,384
那个声称要画一头斗牛犬 结果被大家以为画的是乌龟的人是谁
Nígga painted a pitbull everybody thought Was a turtle.

900
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:47,978
没有发现
Nothing.

901
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:50,864
我们到附近的楼顶上 可能视野会更好些
HoW about getting on a nearby roof for a better vantage?

902
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:54,197
这样太引人注目了 而且为了防止意外
N0t Worth the exposure,

903
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:57,868
我们最多只能派一个人去屋顶 这样风险也会更大
or the risk of us getting split up in case things get urgent

904
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:02,409
这个地方真不合适
This is a bad location for...

905
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,513
那些家伙又是谁
Who the he‖ are those guys?

906
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,818
可能在沃格曼到之前就一直在里面
Must have been here since before Vogelmann arrived.

907
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,310
是他们
lt's them.

908
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,096
谁
Who?

909
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:06,606
那两个黑人
The black dudes.

910
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,566
跟沃格曼一起上车的那两个
The ones Who drove Vogelmann.

911
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,434
一该死 -妈的
- Anchovies. - Crud.

912
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:47,939
你知道现在是什么情况吗
Any idea What's going on here?

913
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:50,441
我不知道 这些人之后肯定有
l dunno. These guys eXpect to be exposed

914
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,402
暴露在人群或者监控器范围内的行动
to people or a camera at some point.

915
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,231
所以他们才会做如此伪装
That's the only Way those disguises make any sense.

916
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,235
他们到底要干什么?
What kind ofjob?

917
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,327
抢劫?
R0bbe「y?

918
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:02,411
绑架?
Kldnapping?

919
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:06,037
- 谋杀? - 差不多就这些吧
- Murder? - One or some of those. Yeah.

920
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:35,353
女士
Ma'am?

921
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,648
你需要帮助吗?
You need some assistance?

922
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,530
抱歉
Sorry.

923
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:55,415
能帮我按-下吗?
Can you hold that?

924
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,008
请等一下 女士
PIease hold it. Ma'am?

925
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,522
杰佛利

926
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:21,616
杰佛利 让我进去
Jeffrey, let me in.

927
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,456
- 快开门 - 凯莉 别叫了
- Open this. - Kely please Stop ye////7g.

928
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:31,247
- 我在厕所昵 - 为什么要挂上锁?
- lwas in the bathroom - Why put the chain on the door?

929
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,836
你为什么还没去上班
Why aren Tyou 0n your Way to W0r/(?

930
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,251
你不能用问题来回答我的问题
You are not a‖oWed to ansWer a question With a question.

931
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,090
别跟我喊 好吗 ?
Don 'z' Shout at me okay?

932
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,380
你必须马上下楼
justu You need to go back downsta/m

933
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,253
坐上公交车 然后去上班
get on the bus and go to Work

934
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:44,173
- 给我开门 - 我做不到
- Open this right noW. - /can't

935
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,174
什么叫你不做不到 你当然做得到
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can.

936
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,518
我真的很想绐你开门 但我不能这么做
/ Want t0, / 唧励 rea/A/ da but / Can 't

937
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:51,350
你的产假四个星期前就结束 了
The matern/Ty /ea Ve ended four Weeks aga

938
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,269
你为了在这里陪杰克逊
You'Ve used all of your vacation

939
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:56,064
己经把所有可以请的假都请完 了
and every single sick day staying here With Jackson.

940
01:20:56,726 --> 01:20:58,194
他需要我
He needed me.

941
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,148
我能照顾好他
I'm taking good care of himm

942
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:06,240
我会在你下班回来之前一直好好照顾他的
and I Will continue to do so until you're home from Work.

943
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:10,699
我恨你
l hate you.

944
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:13,167
但我很爱你
And I loVe you tWice as much.

945
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:16,421
你今天必须要去上班
You need to go to Workm today.

946
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,635
我的工作太蠢了
Myjob is so stupid.

947
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,759
我去到那里
l go there and I se‖

948
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:32,687
耗费大把青春就为了换取一张工资条
chunks of my life for a paycheck, so thatm

949
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,436
就为了让那些与我素未蒙面的有钱人
rich people l've never even met

950
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:37,776
把他们的钱存进我从来都没见过的地方
can put money in places l'Ve never even seen.

951
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,274
我心里惦记着自己的宝贝
HoW am l supposed to sit at a stupid desk

1085
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,296
百分之五十这个答案等于没说
Any yes or no question.

1086
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,799
但愿这个家伙不要太过于好奇了
Hope this asshole doesn't get too curious.

1087
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:44,230
银行会在1 5分钟后重新营业 晚点再来吧
"The bank Wi‖ reopen in 15 minutes, come back then.“

1088
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:47,399
他也有可能说50分钟 但是为什么呢?
He might have said 50, but Why?

1089
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:49,276
也可能不是
Probably not.

1090
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,412
这家伙是做烟草广告的吗
This guy's Iike a cigarette commerciaL

1091
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:21,766
他们在装货了
They're l0adir1g.

1092
01:33:48,497 --> 01:33:49,840
天啊
Christ.

1093
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,183
我们本来可以阻止这一切的
We could haVe stopped this.

1094
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,309
- 你不想说点什么吗 - 现在不能分心
- Are you gonna say anything? - Focus on that

1095
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:09,234
是我们害死那些人的
We let those people get ki‖ed.

1096
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:13,944
你不应该说点什么吗
You're not gonna say anything?

1097
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:20,200
你不想为我们的失职说点什么吗?
You don't have anything to say about our culpability?

1098
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:23,032
那这个情绪激动的意大利人说的己经够多了
Those ltalian emotions are saying plenty.

1099
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:25,581
- 去死吧 你这个没良心的混蛋 - 我不喜欢感情用事
- Go to he‖, you heartless fuck. - l never saW that opera.

1100
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,043
从我们知道这不是一出 常规的毒品交易时开始
Look, by the time We kneW it Wasn't a routine drug deal,

1101
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:31,382
- 一切都晚了 - 你可以上报的啊
- it Was already too late. - You could have ca‖ed it in.

1102
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,301
当那辆车离开停车场的时候
When the Van Ieft the parking garage.

1103
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:35,590
你可以向堡垒市警察通报的
Put the BulWark PD on alert.

1104
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:36,967
我们没这么做
We didn't.

1105
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,632
在他们到达银行期间只有1 6分钟
The chance of that accomplishing anything

1106
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:43,557
这段时间警局做出有效回应的几率只有50% 甚至25%
in the 16-minute interim, less than 50 percent or even 25.

1107
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:47,307
你可以打电话给堡垒市警察局或者联邦调查局
You Wanna call the BulWark PD, the state police, the Feds,

1108
01:34:47,306 --> 01:34:48,899
叫他们来处理这个案子
Iet them handle it, go ahead.

1109
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:52,107
但是那辆货车 还有车上那些混蛋
But that van, and the cut-throats inside,

1110
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:55,903
绝对会在任何执行机构做出回应之前跑的无影无踪
they'll be Vapor before any enforcement agency can respond.

1111
01:34:58,067 --> 01:34:59,114
只能靠我们了
We're it.

1112
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:23,684
你们说过除非是自卫
You said you Weren't gonna kill anyone

1113
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:26,475
否则是不会杀死任何人的 你们保证过的
unless it Was in self-defense. You gave us your Word.

1114
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:30,308
上州际公路
Get on the interstate.

1115
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,441
你们在银行里办的事纯属多余
lt Was excessive What happened back there.

1116
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:39,071
你是想继续高谈阔论批评我们?
Do you Wish to expand upon your critique?

1117
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:41,660
想给我们上一课不成?
Give us the urban point of vieW?

1118
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:43,450
他没什么想说的了
He ain't got nothing more to say.

1119
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:45,281
别再说了 伙计
Hush that flap, nigga.

1120
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,577
好好开车 我们不会有事的
Keep your attention on the road. We'Il get through this.

1121
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:52,462
肌肉男

1122
01:35:52,955 --> 01:35:54,172
瘦子

1123

1124
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,628
把你们的枪放进贮物箱里
Place your firearms inside of the glove box.

1125
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,308
这是命令
That Wasn't a suggestion.

1126
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:11,432
好的
AIl right.

1127
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:29,333
用报纸把枪遮起来
Cover that Weaponry With the sport section.

1128
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:36,381
把门关上
Close the door.

1129
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,462
把门关上
Close the door.

1130
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:43,973
己经关上 了
lt's closed.

1131
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,342
我没听见响声
We didn't hear ít click.

1132
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:48,265
我们要听到关上的响声
We Want to hear it click.

1133
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:02,696
除非有我的允许
Do not open that glove boX

1134
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:04,534
否则绝对不要打开贮物箱
unless I have given you my permissi0n.

1135
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:07,117
知道了
AIl right.

1136
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:16,460
有什么发现吗?
You see something?

1137
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:21,044
没有
Nah, nothing.

1138
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:32,388
该死他们居然上州际公路了
Crud, the interstate.

1139
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:36,191
你觉得他们会去哪儿?
Any idea Where they're gonna land?

1140
01:37:36,183 --> 01:37:39,062
肯定是去一个穷乡僻壤的地方 他们要换车
SomeWhere rural, Where they're gonna exchange vehicles,

1141
01:37:39,061 --> 01:37:40,153
但是具体会去哪儿呢?
but Where that is...

1142
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:31,330
他们一会儿就得加油了
Need gas pretty soon.

1143
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:32,790
他们也一样
Yeah, so do they.

1144
01:38:32,781 --> 01:38:34,749
他们一旦停车 我们就限制住他们

1145
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,211
车里的汽油桶吗
The cans in the truck?

1146
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,622
你刚刚不是问过我这个问题吗?

1147
01:38:50,799 --> 01:38:51,846
安静

1148
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,641
我想尿尿
I need to pee.

1149
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:00,101
我叫你闭嘴
The other quiet

1150
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:11,321
再敢说一个字我就挖了你的眼睛

1151
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,536

把这个女人尿的尿处理了
Come get rid of this Iady piss.

1157
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:47,379
我们会没事的
We'll get through this.

1158
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:51,549
做好我们自己的事情就行 别管后面的人
Just do What you're paid to do and never mind them back there.

1159
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:09,947
还记得你妈妈带我们出来庆祝你的生日吗?
Remember When your ma brung us out here for your birthday?

1160
01:41:12,274 --> 01:41:15,403

还有几个邻居

1165
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,974
你想吃冰淇淋蛋糕 所以你妈妈就用冰柜装了一个来
You Wanted an ice cream cake so your ma brung it in a cooler.

1166
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:41,811

1167

01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:49,982
没错
That's right That's right.

1169

牙身是白色的 尖上还有红色

还有它正在吃的猎物
The meal he just ate,

1174
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:13,586
应该是剑龙还是什么的
Stegosaurus or Whoever.

1175
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:16,964
我小时候是个恐龙迷啊
IWas rea‖y into dinosaurs back then.

1176
01:42:16,965 --> 01:42:18,057
是啊 你特别喜欢

1177
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:20,514
而且因为你妈妈给了我最大的一块
And you got all pissed and shit

1178
01:42:20,509 --> 01:42:22,477
你还生气了好久呢

1180
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:27,983
寿星就应该吃最大的那块
The birthday boy gets the biggest piece.

1181
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,020
这是每个妈妈都该奉行的真理

我妈对我不是很好

1185
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:41,576

Only things behind us are a green pickup and a gray car

初步统计有五人死亡

2人重伤 1人失踪

他妈的 失踪的那个是人质

1200
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:49,940

1201
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:51,434
被送到银行
Was delivered tWo days ago.

1202
01:43:51,433 --> 01:43:52,730
这绝对不是个巧合

1203
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:00,610
天哪
Christ.

1204
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:03,783
6条人命画上了句号
Six people got punctuation.

1205
01:44:13,997 --> 01:44:15,544
6个人就这么死了
Six human beings died.

1206
01:44:25,093 --> 01:44:26,094
我想知道
l gotta kn0W.

1207
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,144
如果我们回不来了
ln case We don't come back,

1208
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:29,809
我想知道她会说什么
I gotta knoW What she Would haVe said.

1209
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:31,102
我们会活着回来的
We're coming back.

1210
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:33,896
100%吗?
One hundred percent?

1211
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:38,192
我有80%的概率
l'm at 80.

1212
01:44:38,188 --> 01:44:40,156
甚至更高 高到85% 但你只有70%
Maybe even 85, you're 70.

1213
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:42,989
因为你比我有经验?
Experience?

1214
01:44:43,569 --> 01:44:46,197
没错 而且我不是意大利人
Yeah, plus l'm not ltalian.

1215
01:44:51,953 --> 01:44:53,125
我接通到她的语音信箱了
That's her voicemail.

1216
01:44:56,498 --> 01:44:58,011
嘿 德尼斯

1224
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:19,818

我知道这很麻烦

我知道

打开右面的车库门

他吞下去了

1292
01:52:44,091 --> 01:52:46,059
瘦子跑了
And Slim's still out there.

1293
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:56,398
我们要不要开到他们前面去 然后在拦住他们的去路
Should We drive past him and come at him from behind?

1294
01:52:56,394 --> 01:53:00,069
不 我们要把他们困在这里

没有比垃圾场
Conflict couldn't happen in

1296
01:53:04,652 --> 01:53:07,201
更适合交火的地点了
a better less populated place than this.

1297
01:53:20,585 --> 01:53:22,462
看起来他们跟请的帮手起了矛盾
Looks Iike problems With the hired help.

1298
01:53:33,139 --> 01:53:36,518
- 所以里德还活着 - 前门看上去有人把守
- So Reed's still alive? - That front door looks armored.

1299
01:53:37,227 --> 01:53:38,649
他们为什么让她来搬尸体?
Why are they making her do that?

1300
01:53:38,686 --> 01:53:40,688
他们想在离开前把这里收拾干净
They Wanna clean things up before they go?

1301
01:53:41,064 --> 01:53:44,034
- 有75%的概率 - 剩下的25%昵?
- Seventy-five percent - What's the other 25?

1302
01:53:44,025 --> 01:53:47,029
我不确定 有不详的预感
l'm not sure. Something Weird.

1303
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:00,668
这也太过分了
This is excessive.

1304
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:35,118
- 咱们车漏油了 - 我知道
- We got a leak. - l'm aWare.

1305
01:54:37,787 --> 01:54:39,039
别被击中了
Don't get shot

1306
01:54:39,622 --> 01:54:41,249
他们角度不对 打不到我的
They don't have the right angle.

1307
01:54:45,545 --> 01:54:47,172
除非他们趴在地上
Unless they get on the ground.

1308
01:54:48,256 --> 01:54:50,634
不过我己经就位了 所以主动权在我手上
Since I'm already here, l'Il get off the first shots.

1309
01:54:50,633 --> 01:54:52,306
这也是在军队学的?
You Iearn that in the army?

1310
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:53,724
这是几何学
Geometry actua‖y.

1311
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,688
你看见另外一个帮手是什么情况吗?
Did you see What happened to that other helper?

1312
01:54:56,891 --> 01:54:59,064
- 那个瘦的黑人? - 对
- The skinny black guy? - Him.

1313
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:00,359
没看见
No.

1314
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:03,609
我觉得在第一次交火时就跑了
lthink he disappeared during the first barrage.

1315
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:06,612
又多了一个对我们不利的参数
That's a variable We didn't need.

1316
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:13,248
开始表演吧
Start the party.

1317
01:55:25,543 --> 01:55:26,510
没打中吗?
Did you miss?

1318
01:55:29,381 --> 01:55:30,507
现在就别挖苦了
Don't be an asshole.

1319
01:55:41,809 --> 01:55:44,198
他们的轮胎没有充气
They're rolling bunkers on airless tíres.

1320
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:49,276
把胃切下来
RemoVe the stomach,

1321
01:55:49,442 --> 01:55:51,661
保证钥匙别溜进他的肠子里
so that the key doesn't fa‖ into his entrails.

1322
01:55:52,236 --> 01:55:53,237
好的
lWi.

1323
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:11,139
是警察吗?
Think they're cops?

1324
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:18,226
要不然也是坏人正在打金条的主意呢
Not unless they're crooked ones, looking for the gold.

1325
01:56:19,555 --> 01:56:21,853
我怀疑是瘦子的帮手
l suspect these men are Slim's associates.

1326
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:25,823
专心干你的话
Just stay focused on your Work.

1327
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:29,608
这两个家伙没什么武器 不是我们的对手
This duo isn't properly armed for an engagement With us.

1328
01:56:33,861 --> 01:56:36,455
这个是胆囊 看起来像
lt's the pale sac in there, the one that looks Iike...

1329
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:38,291
我知道这是什么
l knoW Which one it is.

1330
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:42,499
小心点儿 别捅到他的肝
Careful not to pop his Iiver.

1331
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:45,625
那玩意奇臭无比 尤其是黑人的
That is the Worst smell in the World, black guys especially.

1332
01:57:30,918 --> 01:57:32,591
把它扔下去 开车走人
Let's dump him and drive.

1333
01:57:40,845 --> 01:57:41,767
填弹
shell5.

1334
01:57:53,608 --> 01:57:55,906
我们应不应该匿名报告警方
Should We call this in, anonymously?

1335
01:57:56,861 --> 01:57:58,329
我不太会用这把枪
l'm not equipped for it.

1336
01:58:07,414 --> 01:58:08,711
事情越来越奇怪了
Things are getting Weird.

1337
01:58:12,043 --> 01:58:12,919
上车
Get in.

- Thanks for Ietting me knoW. - You heard me. Buckle.

1340
01:59:29,787 --> 01:59:31,960
她家的地址是拍进去了吗?
ls her home address literally in that picture?

1341
01:59:32,456 --> 01:59:35,801
绝对没错 而且她实际上比看起来更年轻
Completely. And she's younger than she looks.

1342
01:59:37,795 --> 01:59:39,672
说不定连孩子都有了
She probably had kids.

1343
01:59:47,555 --> 01:59:50,354
有没有你亲人住在这个地址里
Do you have any loved ones at this address?

1344
01:59:57,648 --> 02:00:00,492
我们会把这张照片发给我们的同伙
That photo had some very unpleasant instructions

1345
02:00:00,485 --> 02:00:01,953
他们都是狠角色
that Will go to our associates.

1346
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:05,829
除非你按照我们说的去做 不然你的家人就会有危险
Unless you do exactly What We tell you to do.

1347
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:18,469
汽油漏的越来越凶了
The drip has become a trickle.

1348
02:00:19,045 --> 02:00:20,467
我听得到

1349
02:00:22,966 --> 02:00:24,092
我很担心
I'm concerned.

1350
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:39,615
我们要不要跟他们挑明了
Should We make an announcement?

1351
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:42,026
- 告诉他们我们是警察 - 不行
- Say We're cops? - No.

1352
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:45,249
这样会让人质处境的危险程度

1353
02:00:45,238 --> 02:00:46,581

This is the only deal you're gonna get.

1358
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:59,048
我们是为了金条来的
We'rejust here for the gold. That's it.

1359
02:01:00,086 --> 02:01:03,761
把金条留在车上 从车里出来
Leave the bu‖ion Where it is and come on out.

1360

1361
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:08,894
如果你们选择待在车里 我们就杀了所有人
You stay in the van, We'‖ kill a‖ of you,

1362
02:01:09,136 --> 02:01:11,764
沃格曼 助手1 号

把汽油拿来

02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:28,872
- 什么油? - 汽油
- The gas? - Gasoline.

你们先开会吧 不用等我了 我有事要处理
Don't hold the meeting for me. I've been delayed.

1368
02:01:48,843 --> 02:01:50,686
如果我们既要提供无障碍通道
Idon't think the budget is realistic

1369
02:01:50,678 --> 02:01:52,271
又要安装金属探测器
for Wheelchair access and metal detectors

1370
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:53,981
那这点预算是显然不够的
so We need to provide them both.

1371
02:01:54,849 --> 02:01:56,647
等一下我帮托尼把这事儿搞定了

你能到车的这边来吗?

那个女的是无辜的

1392
02:05:35,986 --> 02:05:38,080
要我带你去急救室吗?
Want me to drive you to the emergency room?

1393
02:05:38,072 --> 02:05:39,870
不用了 我己经走不动了
No, it's too much to move.

1394
02:05:41,952 --> 02:05:43,169
而且也没有必要了
And there's no reason.

1395
02:05:48,207 --> 02:05:50,426
这种情况我都不知道该说什么了
Don't have the right Words for this situation.

天哪 我真的希望这一切

1420

1422
02:09:40,147 --> 02:09:43,196
要不你过来亲自解决夫格曼

1423
02:09:43,192 --> 02:09:45,069

Can execute naked Women and everything.

1427
02:09:55,121 --> 02:09:56,043
混蛋

02:10:12,763 --> 02:10:15,186
不要把钱看得
Do not pr/0r/t/2e money

比自己命还重要

1430
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:37,671
下一发子弹可就不是闹着玩的了
The neXt bullet ain't a Warning.

1431
02:10:43,168 --> 02:10:45,842
你穿的防弹衣挺不错的
That bulletproof vest you got there's real nice.

1432
02:10:45,838 --> 02:10:47,340
显瘦
Makes you look svelte.

1433
02:10:48,549 --> 02:10:50,392
就像女人穿上了塑身衣
Like When a female puts on a girdle.

1434
02:10:53,554 --> 02:10:55,556
比你之前那脚踩那个墨西哥人
lt's much more flattering than that Windbreaker

1435
02:10:55,557 --> 02:10:58,185

1436
02:10:59,269 --> 02:11:00,521
你是在哪发现我的?
Where did you spot me?

1437
02:11:01,436 --> 02:11:02,733
你们从银行开始跟着我们的时候
When you droVe by the bank.

1438
02:11:03,730 --> 02:11:06,734
还有在林园大道上跟踪我们的时候

for Wiping out a‖ these cruel-ass thugs.

1443
02:11:18,662 --> 02:11:20,664
被停职的警察难道都好这一 口
That's What most cops do When they get suspended.

1444
02:11:22,124 --> 02:11:23,376
劫抢这些银行抢劫犯
Go rob bank robbers.

1445
02:11:25,253 --> 02:11:26,505
你脱了干什么?

我有问题要问你

1449
02:11:37,347 --> 02:11:38,815
你要是敢不说实话
You tell me some bullshit

1450
02:11:39,433 --> 02:11:40,901
我就把你杀死那个白人女孩的录像

1457
02:12:22,476 --> 02:12:23,728
有话直说
Make some Words.

1458
02:12:26,272 --> 02:12:29,196
我们应该把这个地方收拾干净然后把金子分了
We should clean up this mess together and split the gold.

1459
02:12:31,611 --> 02:12:33,363
我们也可以继续斗下去
We can fight each other some more,

1460
02:12:34,488 --> 02:12:38,368
直到两败俱伤 但是我们也可以双赢
do this until We're crippled or dead, or We can both be rich.

1461
02:12:39,201 --> 02:12:41,169
我觉得这个选择题不难做
ldon't see hoW this is a dilemma.

1462
02:12:41,829 --> 02:12:43,251
你让我相信一个誓察
Trusting a c0p,

1463
02:12:43,747 --> 02:12:46,466
一个作风如此不正的警察 还不好选择吗?
one that's crooked as fuck, is the dilemma.

1464
02:12:47,626 --> 02:12:49,594
我对你只有一件事情非常肯定
Only thing absolutely certain about y0u

1465

那就是你对干入职宣言上的内容根本不在平
is that you don't gíve a shit about any oath you sWear to.

1466
02:13:01,431 --> 02:13:04,526
我女几两天前又被人骚扰了 已经是第五次了
My daughter got assaulted for the fifth time tWo days ago.

1467
02:13:05,852 --> 02:13:08,571
我妻子有严重的多发性硬化症
l\/ly Wife has multiple sclerosis and can't even Walk

1468
02:13:08,563 --> 02:13:10,236
不拄拐都走不了
half the time Wíthout a cane.

1469
02:13:12,317 --> 02:13:13,489
我需要这笔钱

1470
02:13:19,741 --> 02:13:22,164
- 73分 - 64分

1471
02:13:24,579 --> 02:13:25,626
成交
'Aight.

1472
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,718
车库里有备用车?
There's a getaWay car in there?

1473
02:13:30,627 --> 02:13:31,924
警宫真精明
Detective is astute.

1474
02:13:33,672 --> 02:13:35,595
我们得把这个扔到湖里沉了
We need to toW this one to the lake.

1475
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:37,385

1476
02:13:42,723 --> 02:13:45,852
咱们一起慢慢的卸掉枪里所有的子弹
Let's unload the guns together and sloWIy

1477
02:13:45,851 --> 02:13:47,728
谁都别动歪脑筋
so neither one of us is tempted.

1478
02:13:50,523 --> 02:13:51,570
好的
AIl right.

1479
02:13:54,277 --> 02:13:55,654
那我们的朋友怎么办?
What We do With our friends?

1480
02:13:57,696 --> 02:13:58,663
不能把他们留在这儿
Can't Ieave them here.

1481
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:02,243
但也不能把他们带回去
We can't go bringing them back With us neither

1482
02:14:02,242 --> 02:14:03,915
这样会暴露我们的
Without exposing ourselves.

1483
02:14:04,828 --> 02:14:06,250
把他们埋了吧
We bury them.

1484
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:53,844
我都不知道他们会抓个女的当人质
ldidn't knoW they Was gonna grab no Woman.

1485
02:14:55,337 --> 02:14:57,715
也没有人应该被枪杀 除非那个人先用枪指着我们
Nobody Was supposed to get shot unless they pu‖ed a gun on us.

1486
02:14:57,923 --> 02:14:59,550
这是我们说好了的
That Was the deal.

1487
02:14:59,549 --> 02:15:01,597
你真的相信他们的鬼话 还是只是自欺欺人而己?
Did you believe that or did you just Want to?

1488
02:15:08,642 --> 02:15:09,985
这几没有枪
Ain't no guns in here.

1489

那辆货车里有很多枪

We go in the van at the same time.

1492
02:15:22,865 --> 02:15:25,459
随便吧 反正都是手到擒来的事情
Whatever you Want lt's a‖ cotton candy.

1493
02:15:26,827 --> 02:15:28,795
那里面的味道不会好闻
lt's not gonna smell great in there.

1494
02:15:37,838 --> 02:15:39,636
我们把金子放在这
We'‖ put the gold in here.

1495
02:15:39,631 --> 02:15:41,633
为什么 这个车已经面目全非了
Why? This Wreck is dead as an insect.

1496
02:15:41,633 --> 02:15:43,727
我知道 但我得坐在这车上驾驶
Right, but l got to sit in it and steer.

1497
02:15:43,718 --> 02:15:45,106
如果把东西都放在你车上
l don't Want you cutting me loose

1498
02:15:45,095 --> 02:15:47,473
那你突然变卦 带着东西逃之夭夭怎么办?
and driving off With everything in your trunk.

1499
02:15:47,472 --> 02:15:48,985
你太能妄想了 疑心太重了
You're so paranoid and suspicious

1500
02:15:48,974 --> 02:15:50,772
害的我都有点疑心病了
you're making me paranoid and suspicious.

1501
02:15:50,767 --> 02:15:52,690
我只是怕你骗我而己
l'm just trying to avoid temptation.

1502
02:15:53,145 --> 02:15:54,692
警官看来还是个神职人员啊
Detective is a priest.

1503
02:16:14,541 --> 02:16:15,713
动作慢点
We go sloW.

1504
02:16:16,042 --> 02:16:17,510
用得着这么担心吗
lt's a‖ cotton candy.

1505
02:16:29,514 --> 02:16:32,438
这味道就像诏气池炸了一样
Sme‖s like a‖ these dudes shitted themselves.

1506
02:16:46,531 --> 02:16:48,078
不要碰
Don't fondle any guns.

1507
02:16:50,535 --> 02:16:51,923
过父亲节的时候
On Father's Day,

1508
02:16:51,912 --> 02:16:54,756
你女几会给你敬一个礼还是两个?

1509
02:16:54,748 --> 02:16:56,000

对

1512
02:17:02,088 --> 02:17:04,477
有几块掉了
Some Ioose bits on the concrete.

1513
02:20:11,903 --> 02:20:13,200
我来把这个解开

1514

我去拿包

1515
02:20:56,948 --> 02:20:57,949
抱歉
Sorry.

1516
02:21:42,952 --> 02:21:45,125
记得避开那摊淤泥
Don't driVe too close to that muck.

1517
02:21:45,497 --> 02:21:47,875
你确定你不是小学老师吗?
You sure you ain't an elementary teacher,

1518
02:21:47,874 --> 02:21:50,172
你是不是习惯了和那些啥都不懂的小屁孩打交道的那种
used to dealing With Iittle kids Who don't know nothing?

1519
02:21:50,752 --> 02:21:54,131
我要说的应该是“什么都不知道吧”
l believe What you meant to say Was, "Who don't knoW anythíng."

1520
02:21:54,839 --> 02:21:56,227
你懂我意思 对吗
You understood me, didn't you?

1521
02:21:56,758 --> 02:21:59,181
是 但是你说的话会看起来智商不太高
Yeah, but you're a lot smarter than you sound,

1522
02:21:59,177 --> 02:22:01,350
事实上 你是个很聪明的人
a Whole lot smarter from What l'Ve seen.

1523
02:22:01,804 --> 02:22:03,806
被低估是件好事儿
lt's good to be underestimated.

1524
02:22:09,354 --> 02:22:11,106
你这么做是为了防止我以为我自己
You're doing that in case I confuse

1525
02:22:11,105 --> 02:22:13,028
- 开的是一艘潜水艇? - 没错
- this car With a submarine? - Yup.

1526
02:22:33,962 --> 02:22:34,963
别激动
Keep calm.

1527
02:22:36,214 --> 02:22:38,387
- 你搞什么 - 只是个预防措施
- What the fuck is this shit? - Just a precautionary measure.

1528
02:22:38,383 --> 02:22:40,977
我不想伤害你 把你的手机拿出来
l don't intend t0 hurt you. Take out your cell phone.

1529
02:22:42,512 --> 02:22:44,810
那段录像是我的保险单
That video is my insurance policy.

1530
02:22:44,806 --> 02:22:47,980
错了 如果他们让你去坐牢你能指认我
Wrong. You can identify me if they toss you injail.

1531
02:22:47,976 --> 02:22:50,445
相反 我也可以指认你 我们两个本身
lf We get brought to tral, l can do the same to you.

1532
02:22:50,436 --> 02:22:53,235
就能让对方保持沉默 这才是最公平的做法
We keep each other quiet. That's fair. That's balanced.

1533
02:22:53,439 --> 02:22:56,238
但是那段录像加大了我受到你勒索的风险
But that video opens me up to extortion from you,

1534
02:22:56,276 --> 02:22:58,404
不止是你 所有收到你视频的人或者
or anyone you send it to, or for anyone that hacks

1535

- into your hardWare. - None of that's gonna happen.

1537
02:23:02,907 --> 02:23:04,784
我只是在排除不稳定的因素

1538
02:23:06,327 --> 02:23:07,795
把枪放下

1539
02:23:07,787 --> 02:23:09,755
把手机给我 密码告诉我

我根本就不会要挟你的

你应该相信我的
You should haVe trusted a nigga.
