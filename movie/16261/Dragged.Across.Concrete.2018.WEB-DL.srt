fling the gear and drop me off.

You don't know that.

00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,780
Not for sure, no. But if things get tricky,

666
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,520
I'll disengage and find something else.

667
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,520
This is a bad idea.
这个点子很不好

00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:09,440
Well, then, fling the gear and drop me off.

Look, if you do this, you do it for yourself.
你要是干的话 就是为你自己干
672
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,460
You don't do it because you pity my situation.

673
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,550
Or because we're partners or because we're friends

00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,110
that grill burgers on Sundays, or go to the fights.

你干只是因为自己想挣点钱 没别的
676
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,740

-Lorentz Vogelmann? -Yeah.
-洛伦兹@沃格曼？-是的

00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:14,990

683
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,950
Any idea if his merchandise is in 633?
知不知道他的货在不在633号？
684
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,820
No idea, but after we confirm that he's there,

685
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,300
we'll tail him and we'll learn his itinerary.

00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,700
You got a timeframe?
你有时间表了吗
687
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:32,960
My contact said he's rendered 633 for two weeks.

688
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,440
We're at day two of that period.

689
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,010
You know anything else about him, vehicles, associates?

690
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,450
That's what we're learning now.
这是我们现在正要了解的
691
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,020
Camera?

Make sure to ask me if I'm still in when I wake up.
等我醒来后 一定要问问我还干不干
696
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,670
I've been processing here for five hours.

697
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,280
You should have given me a nudge.

698
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,550
There wasn't a reason to.

699
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,720
Are you still in?
你还干吗
700
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:43,340

701
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,860
-You see Vogelmann yet? -Nope.
-看到沃格曼了吗 -没有
702
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,220
I'm gonna get something from this big orange thing.

703
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,530
You want egg salad on rye toast?

704
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,270
Two of them, and root beer.

705
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,130
Amen.

706
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:27,050
I've been listening to and smelling that

707
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,740
for the last 98 minutes.

708
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,840
Best part of a stake out,
这是盯梢最快乐的时候
709
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,410
other than when it ends...
除了盯梢结束时
710
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:39,760
is when you're eating.
就是吃东西的时候
711
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,850
A single red ant could've eaten it faster.
一只红蚂蚁吃的也比你快
712
00:57:58,990 --> 00:57:59,860
Nope.

I'm still enjoying the aftertaste.
我还在回味余味呢
715
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,490
Not all of us are.
但我不是
716
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,500
Where did you park?
你把车停在哪儿了？
717
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,110
I've been telling you, you're getting senile.
我说过多次 你老了
718
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,940
You didn't lock it?
你没锁上？
719
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:35,770
I for...
我忘…
720
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,950
I was thinking about something else at the time. Sorry.
当时我再想别的了 对不起
721
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,610
This your duffel?
这是你的帆布包？
722
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,570
I don't think so.
不是
723
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,090
Face the windshield.
面向前方
724
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:00,050
Put on your seat belts and lock the doors.
系上安全带 锁上车门
725
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:15,900
Paco...

726
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,550
put up that sunshade, por favor.

727
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,260
Good. Now empty your pockets.
好的 现在把口袋的东西掏出来
728
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,870
Put everything in that duffel bag,
把东西都放在帆布包里
729
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,960
or you'll be painting houses in heaven.
否则你们就要上天堂了
730
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,050
No, please.
不 求你了
731
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,310
You have five seconds.
给你们五秒钟时间
732
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,270
Four...
四
733
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,050
-Three... -That's all I got.
-三 -我兜里只有它
734
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,620
Me too, I swear to God.
我也是 我对天发誓
735
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,620
Show me your pocket whites.
翻开口袋让我看看
736
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:50,670
See?
看
737
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:33,800
Shut off that phone.
把手机关了
738
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,070
Bye.
再见
739
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:44,030
I expected you...
我想你会…
740
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,340
You'll f...
你会…
741
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,090
Airless.
没气了
742
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,630
Please, allow me to show you the interior.
请让我让你看看内部
743
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,400
If anything moves in there,
如果里面有任何能动的
744
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,540
a rat, a mouse,
一只耗子 一只老鼠
745
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,230
a baby mosquito,
一只小蚊子
746
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,450
you'll get to ring Allah's doorbell.
你就可以去敲真主的门了
747
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,470
Pop the hood.
打开引擎盖
748
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,590
All is as expected?
都在你意料之中吧
749
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,260
The blood is gratis.

750
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,000
Keys.
钥匙
751
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,010
Brett, that you?
布雷特 是你吗
752
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:43,760
Confirmed.
是我
753
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,110
Look in the closet, I got you something.

754
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,470
Try it on.
穿上试试
755
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,990
Everything you get me fits perfect.
你给我买的都是合身的
756
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,230
Thanks for getting it.

757
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,010
Thank me in bed.
在床上谢我吧
758
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,940
So, did you guys beat up any minorities today?
你们今天又打了少数民族了吗
759
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,240
That's only when we're on the clock.

760
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:40,160
-This was really delicious. -Glad you liked it.
-这真好吃 -你爱吃就好
761
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,810
And should I infer from your reticence
我是不是该从你的沉默中
762
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,250
this is one of those times you can't talk about your work?
推断这是你不想谈论工作的时候？
763
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:48,300
Please, infer about my reticence.

764
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:52,130
Even though you've been suspended

765
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,740
and you're technically a civilian?

766
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:56,830
Criminals don't stop doing what they do
坏人不会因为两个警察被停职
767
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:58,220
just 'cause two cops get benched.
就停止做坏事
768
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:01,140
And we don't do what we do just for the paycheck.
我们做事也不是只为了工资
769
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,790
What?
怎么了
770
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,100
Don't try and bluff somebody who's smarter than you are.
不要试图糊弄一个比你明白的人
771
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,890
Smarter by a yardstick.
比你明白的多
772
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,680
Did you see I brought cannolis from Theo Renzo"s?

773
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,900
Just don't do anything to jeopardize your career, please.
只要别作任何影响你职业生涯的事情
774
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,160
I won't.
我不会的
775
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,660
Seven unaccounted for.

776
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,220
If Vogelmann's in that tan stucco

777
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,530
and owns a vehicle, one of them is his.

778
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:54,800
Are you still in?
你还干吗
779
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,800
At the outermost edge.
已经很犹豫了
780
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:01,460
Denise?
因为丹妮丝？
781
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,160
She guessed that something wasn't right.
她猜出来有些不对劲
782
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,460
I didn't say anything.
我啥都没说
783
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:11,380
So?
怎么样
784
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,430
Picked up the engagement ring.

785
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:16,820
-From Feinbaum? -Yeah.

786
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,520
Okay.
好
787
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,560
Got it the day we busted, uh, Vasquez and...
就是在我们抓捕瓦斯克斯的那天去取的
788
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:23,700
Well, the timing wasn't great, but...

789
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,300
I was gonna propose anyway, I wasn't gonna let some

790
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:29,530
work bullshit interfere with my private life, but turned out...

791
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:32,450
she was in a bad mood that night
她那晚心情也不好
792
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:36,800
because of some drama at her job, and I didn't do it.

793
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,630
And then yesterday you bring me here, suggest this thing,

794
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,760
and I'm sort of okay with the idea,

795
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,070
us taking money off some fuckhead dealer.

796
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,760
If the risk isn't too great.
只要风险不是太大的话
797
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:50,160
But, you know, that night,
不过 在那晚
798
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,950
when I see Denise, even before she suspected anything...
当我看到丹妮丝 即使在她还没开始怀疑什么的时候
799
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,210
I know that I can't propose to her until this thing is done.
我就知道办完这件事之前 才能向她求婚
800
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,560
I evade her questions at dinner and for the first time

801
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,260
since I went to the jeweler...

802
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:06,830
I'm not certain she'd say yes if I proposed.
不确定她是否会答应我的求婚
803
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,750
Yeah. I'm driving you home.
我送你回去
804
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,310
I haven't made a decision yet. I'm just pondering...
我还没做决定 我只是在考虑…
805
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,320
Bullshit. You're decided, even if you think you aren't.
扯淡 你已经做了决定 即使你自己还不知道
806
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,580
You're younger than me, you've got more options.
你比我年轻 你的选择比我多
807
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,410
Request a new partner when we're back on duty,
复职后你申请换个搭档
808
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:25,280
they'll probably make you a sergeant one day.

809
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,720
I don't want a new partner.
我不想换搭档
810
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,680
And I told you that I'd finish out the shift.

811
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,890
Yeah, I appreciate it. But look, you're not obligated.

812
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:33,330
-I have done it with... -My word is an obligation.

813
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:37,810
Thanks.
谢谢
814
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,300
Two egg salads,

815
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,400
and I'll pay for yours, too, if it's not Sobrasada.

816
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,480
Here's one.
来了一辆车
817
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,570
This guy's parking.
这个人在停车
818
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,850
These brothers have seen some stuff.

819
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,290
Yeah, they're tainted.

820
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:20,420
Think they're with Vogelmann?

821
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:21,950
His buyers?
是他的买家？
822
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:25,300
Twenty-percent. Go-betweens or local muscles

823
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,780
probably more like it.

824
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,560
And two root beers.
和两瓶根汁汽水
825
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:48,680
No choice.

826
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:53,560
Ridgeman?
里奇曼
827
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,650
-Vogelmann? -Yeah.
-沃格曼？-是的
828
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:00,740
The black dudes we saw before.
我们见过的那个黑人
829
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,680
They're going west.
他们在向西去
830
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,170
Are you sure?
你确定？
831
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,480
The grey lady needs a decongestant.

832
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:52,050
Don't give 'em a wedgie.

833
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,360
Driving any slower than this will get us noticed.

834
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,580
I don't know this area real well. What's west?

835
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,060
Well, more of this.

836
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:04,460
Then the turnpike and then the school district.
之后是收费公路 再之后是学校区
837
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,760
Probably not doing all this to steal crayons.

838
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:12,770
You feel like some construction work?

839
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,730
Is that necessary right now?

840
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,170
Five percent.

841
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,340
That's for shooting out tires, sending a warning,

842
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,480
things like that, right?

843
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,260
We're not going after any precedence.

844
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,870
I need a better answer than that.
我需要个更好的回答
845
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,480
Right now, we're heading into new territory.

846
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,270
Foggy gray landscape, but I know all of my limits,

847
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:34,570
but maybe not yours.

848
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,010
So before I build a killing instrument

849
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,840
that I last used in the army,

850
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:42,280
I wanna hear that you don't plan on executing a human being

851
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,930
to facilitate a robbery.

852
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:45,710
We're not executing anybody.
我们不杀任何人
853
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,020
That boundary is reinforced in steel concrete.

854
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,420
Agreed. Now, build.

855
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,270
The carpool lane. Right by the black SUV.

856
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,620
Don't let that catch you cold.

857
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,420
You think the transactions happened today?

858
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,080
Oh, this is business.

859
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:48,260
Two tainted black dudes and an out-of-town convict

860
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,170
going for a drive before dawn.

861
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Although it's probably just a preliminary.

862
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,960
Vogelmann was carrying two black briefcases when he got in.

863
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:07,930
Is there anything else you forgot to tell me?
你还有什么忘记告诉我的吗
864
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,280
-No. -No. Are you sure?
-没了 -你确定？
865
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,320
Something subtle, like maybe one of the black dudes
比如其中一个黑人扛着个火箭筒
866
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,720
-had a bazooka? -Hey.
-这样的小细节？-喂
867
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:19,370
I was up for hours listening to you process air. It escaped me.

868
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,250
Fine.
好吧
869
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:28,380
And I suppose you could have let me sleep through all of this,

870
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:30,380
and been done with the whole thing.

871
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:33,690
I definitely should have.
我确实应该
872
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,660
Considering the briefcases...
考虑到手提箱
873
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:44,180
seventy percent this is the transaction.
有七成的可能这次就是交易
874
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,530
What's the other 30?
另外三成呢
875
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:51,140
Vogelmann maybe showing somebody some cash, or some merchandise,

876
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:53,100
depending on which end of the deal he's doing.

877
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:55,710
The briefcases?

878
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,590
The financial district?
金融区？
879
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,500
What's going on here?
这是怎么回事
880
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:05,590
Any idea?

881
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,680
I'm trying to flush the ideas I have

882
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,550
'cause none of them seem to fit this.

883
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,190
Still under construction.

884
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,670
Want me to mail or hand deliver your genius award?

885
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,440
Nice.
不错
886
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:12,880
Real stylish.
很时髦
887
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,700
You're saying this before you use your gay hair shit?

888
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,230
Can't say it after.

889
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,190
Time for a walk by?

890
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:25,330
At 5:45.

891
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:27,460
Why is that?
为什么
892
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:31,770
Well, the nearest most likely time for a meet up is 5:30,
最有可能的见面时间是5点半
893
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:34,600
and we should allow the other party room for tardiness.
我们应该给交易的一方留出点拖沓的时间
894
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,380
Unless Vogelmann is 19 minutes late.

895
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,860
Possible, but not probable.
有可能 但可能性不大
896
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,910
And I'm doing the walk by myself.

897
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:45,480
-Usually... -You're barely here as it is.

898
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,260
Any and every bigger risk we come upon is mine to take.
我们碰到的任何重大风险都是我一个人承担
899
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,690
I'll do you first.

900
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,870
Don't make no mess of it.

901
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,090
I used to graffiti back in the day.

902
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,960
And I remember what it looked like.
我还记得是什么样子
903
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:40,230
You would know better yourself, you know that?

904
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,880
I was only doing tags.

905
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:44,010
You was the one trying to make art.
是你想做成艺术品
906
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,410
Nigga painted a pitbull everybody thought was a turtle.
你画了个斗牛犬 别人都以为是乌龟
907
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:47,930
Nothing.
没动静
908
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:52,230
How about getting on a nearby roof for a better vantage?
要不要去附近的楼顶找个更好的位置
909
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,170
Not worth the exposure,
不值得暴露
910
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:57,740
or the risk of us getting split up in case things get urgent.
或者有紧急情况的话 我们分开了也不好
911
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,440
This is a bad location for...
这个地方真不适合…
912
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,590
Who the hell are those guys?
这些人是谁
913
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,640
Must have been here since before Vogelmann arrived.
肯定是在沃格曼之前来的
914
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,280
It's them.
是他们
915
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,020
Who?
谁
916
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,680
The black dudes.
那俩黑人
917
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:08,640
The ones who drove Vogelmann.
开车带着沃格曼的
918
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,450
-Anchovies. -Crud.

919
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,760
Any idea what's going on here?
知道这是怎么回事吗
920
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,420
I dunno. These guys expect to be exposed

921
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,370
to people or a camera at some point.

922
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:55,160
That's the only way those disguises make any sense.

923
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:59,160
What kind of job?

924
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,250
Robbery?
抢劫？
925
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,380
Kidnapping?
绑架？
926
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:05,910
-Murder? -One or some of those. Yeah.
-杀人？-其中之一吧
927
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:35,330
Ma'am?
小姐
928
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,680
You need some assistance?
你需要协助吗
929
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:40,550
Sorry.
对不起
930
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:55,390
Can you hold that?
帮忙挡一下电梯
931
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:59,880
Please hold it. Ma'am?
请挡一下 小姐
932
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,500
Jeffrey?
杰弗里
933

Jeffrey, let me in.
杰弗里 让我进去
934
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:28,380
-Open this. -Kelly, please stop yelling.
-开门 -凯莉 别喊了
935
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:31,130
-I was in the bathroom. -Why put the chain on the door?
-我刚才在卫生间 -你为什么挂上门链
936
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:32,870
Why aren't you on your way to work?
你为什么没去上班
937
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:35,130
You are not allowed to answer a question with a question.
你不能用问题来回答问题
938
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:36,910
Don't shout at me, okay?
别对我喊 好吗
939
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,310
Just... You need to go back downstairs,
你需要回楼下去
940
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:41,180
get on the bus and go to work.
乘公交车去上班
941
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,010
-Open this right now. -I can't.
-马上开门 -我不行
942
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:46,010
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can.
怎么不行 你当然可以
943
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,490
I want to, I really, really do, but I can't.
我也想开门 真的 但我不能
944
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,230
The maternity leave ended four weeks ago.
你的产假四周前就结束了
945
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,150
You've used all of your vacation

946
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:55,890
and every single sick day staying here with Jackson.

947
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,070
He needed me.
他需要我
948
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:01,030
I'm taking good care of him...
我会照顾他
949
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:06,160
and I will continue to do so until you're home from work.

You need to go to work... today.
你今天要去上班
953
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,660
My job is so stupid.

954
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,840
I go there and I sell

955
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,710
chunks of my life for a paycheck, so that...

956
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,320
rich people I've never even met
让我不认识的有钱人
957
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,840
can put money in places I've never even seen.
把钱放在我从没见过的地方
958
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:43,110
How am I supposed to sit at a stupid desk

959
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:46,330
and talk about bank accounts when my baby is here?

960
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:09,700
Jackson needs diapers, and clothes and gourmet baby food.
杰克逊需要尿布 衣服和好吃的婴儿食品
961
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:13,360
Eventually, he's gonna need school supplies.
将来他还需要上学用品
962
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,490
And if he's anything like me and my brothers,

963
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:16,840
he'll need braces, too.

964
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:21,490
Now, all these things cost money and you make way more than I do.
这些事都需要花钱 而且你挣的钱比我多得多
965
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,370

I'm sorry I said I hate you.
对不起说了我恨你
969
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,420
That's all right.
没关系
970
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:36,250
I know what you really meant.
我知道你真正的意思
971
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,990
Can I see him though?
但能让我看看他吗
972
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,950
Just through the opening.
就从门缝里看
973
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:46,040
I promise, I'll go if you let me see him just for a second.

974

-I need to touch him. -Kelly, please...
-我得摸摸他 -凯莉 拜托
975
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:16,680
I... Just for a second. I swear I'll go.
就一会 我保证会去的
976
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,950
You've broken that swear before and recently.
你以前和最近都打破过这保证
977
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:21,900
Do you swear on the life of our baby
你能以我们孩子的性命发誓
978
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:24,340
that you will leave after you've touched him?

979
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:28,560
No, no, no.
不不
980
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,260
Say it out loud for it to count, that's how swears work.
要说出来才算数 发誓都是这样的
981
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:36,920
I swear on the life of our child that I will go to work

982
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,400
after I've touched him.

983
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,590
You swore on his life.
你以他的性命发过誓
984
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,520
I'll see you both when I get home from work.

So cute.

989
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,670

990
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,930
Can that radiant vision of maternity
这位刚刚走进门的
991
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:21,850

01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:24,640
possibly be our beloved Mrs. Summer?

Thank you, Mr. Edmington.

998
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,440

999
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,920
So do I.

01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,480
Well, in that case, our expectations are aligned.

1006
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,890
Nevertheless, a doleful era.

1007
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:08,810
You really shouldn't look that good after having a baby.

1008

Thanks.

-Thank you. -I made cupcakes.

Oh, yeah, your husband helped me with that part.

1013
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:31,090
A small token, a minuscule manifestation of our affections.

Any deliveries scheduled for today?

1075
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,400

We didn't.

1111
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:39,670
The chance of that accomplishing anything

1112
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:43,590
in the 16-minute interim, less than 50 percent or even 25.

1122
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,900

1319
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:00,280
No.
没看到
1320
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:03,630
I think he disappeared during the first barrage.

1321
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,590
That's a variable we didn't need.
这是个我们不需要的变量因素
1322
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:13,160
Start the party.

Did you miss?

1324

Don't be an asshole.

1325
01:55:41,890 --> 01:55:44,060
They're rolling bunkers on airless tires.

1326
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:49,150
Remove the stomach,

1327
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:51,680
so that the key doesn't fall into his entrails.

1328
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:53,120
I will.

1329

Think they're cops?

Not unless they're crooked ones, looking for the gold.
除非是腐败警察 想得到金子
1331
01:56:19,530 --> 01:56:21,880
I suspect these men are Slim's associates.
我怀疑他们是瘦子的同伙
1332
01:56:24,230 --> 01:56:25,840
Just stay focused on your work.
只管专心做你的事
1333
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:29,590
This duo isn't properly armed for an engagement with us.
这两个人没有足够的武器跟我们交火
1334
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:36,330
It's the pale sac in there, the one that looks like...

1335
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:38,160
I know which one it is.
我知道哪个是胃
1336
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:42,380
Careful not to pop his liver.
小心别弄破他的肝
1337
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:45,600
That is the worst smell in the world, black guys especially.
那是世上最难闻的气味 尤其是黑人的肝
1338
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,520
Let's dump him and drive.
我们把他扔下去开车走吧
1339
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:41,870

1340
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:55,930
Should we call this in, anonymously?

1341
01:57:56,890 --> 01:57:58,200
I'm not equipped for it.
我的装备不行
1342
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:08,690
Things are getting weird.

1343
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:13,120
Get in.

Is her home address literally in that picture?

Completely. And she's younger than she looks.

1348
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:39,650
She probably had kids.

01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:50,180
Do you have any loved ones at this address?
这个地址里有你爱的人吗
1350
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:00,320
That photo had some very unpleasant instructions

1351
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:01,970
that will go to our associates.

1352
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:05,800
Unless you do exactly what we tell you to do.

The drip has become a trickle.

-Say we're cops? -No.

1358
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:45,280

by 60 percent.

别等我开会了 我有事耽搁了
1374
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:50,520
I don't think the budget is realistic

1375
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,300
for wheelchair access and metal detectors

1376
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:54,000
so we need to provide them both.

1377
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:56,480
Well, let me just do this thing for Tony

1378
