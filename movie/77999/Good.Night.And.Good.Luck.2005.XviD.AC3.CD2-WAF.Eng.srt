1
00:00:00,114 --> 00:00:01,407
Feel like a Scotch?

2
00:00:01,991 --> 00:00:04,076
I think everybody
could use a Scotch.

3
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:58,964
- It's 3:30, early editions are out.
- I'm not worried about that.

4
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:00,716
Of course not.
Shirley, honey,..

5
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,760
..would you go across the street
and get the early editions?

6
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:05,804
- All of them?
- Just get O'Brian!

7
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:10,350
- Hey, watch my drink!
- Yeah.

8
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,551
Okay. Here we go.

9
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:48,054
- At last!
- The Times. - The Times...

10
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:49,222
- First?
- Good.

11
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,725
- Who wrote it?
- Jack Gould.

12
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,601
Gould...

13
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:57,605
Edward R. Murrow's television program
on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy..

14
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,526
..was an exciting and provocative
examination of the man and his methods.

15
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:05,155
It was crusading journalism
of high responsibility and courage.

16
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:07,991
For TV so often plagued
by timidity and hesitation,..

17
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:11,870
..the program was a milestone
that reflected enlightened citizenship.

18
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:13,246
The program.... Hold on!

19
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:16,124
The program was no less
an indictment of those who wish..

20
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:19,294
..the problems posed
by the Senator's tactics and theatrics..

21
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:21,379
..would just go away
and leave them alone.

22
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:24,424
That was Mr. Murrow's
and television's triumph,..

23
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:26,050
..and a very great one.

24
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:30,555
Here! Here!

25
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:32,849
- He hated it.
- Yeah. What's his beef?

26
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,351
Send the NewYorkTimes
a bottle of Scotch.

27
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,478
I already did. How do you think
we got that review?

28
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:39,522
- How'sthe Post?
- Pretty good!

29
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,233
- What about O'Brian?
- Uh, the same.

30
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:46,779
- Go on, read O'Brian!
- I don't have it.

31
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:48,322
- Got it.
- Oh. Here.

32
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:52,451
- There we go.
- Shirley, that....

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,667
We can't saywe were surprised at
Murrow's "Hate McCarthy" telecast..

34
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,712
..last evening, when his explosively
one-sided propaganda,..

35
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:06,132
..edited with deviously clever
selectivity from McCarthy's march..

36
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:08,634
..against Communism,
was finished last evening..

37
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:12,138
..by equally Machiavellian coincidence
the following telecast..

38
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,224
..featured Murrow's PM prot¨¦g¨¦,
Hollenbeck.

39
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:18,352
In an obviously gloating mood,
Hollenbeck..

40
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:21,897
..hoped viewers had witnessed
his patron's triumph..

41
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,315
..from and for the Left.

42
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:25,693
So on. So on...

43
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:27,903
Shirley, it's okay.
Go ahead, finish it.

44
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:31,156
- No, that's it. That's it.
- Shirley, please, finish it.

45
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:38,998
The CBS has been in a lengthy
"clean house of Lefties" mood.

46
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,791
The worst offenders
on lesser levels..

47
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:43,085
..have been quietly
pushed out of the company.

48
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:47,131
Don Hollenbeck, a graduate
of the demised pinko publication PM,..

49
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:51,010
..attacked conservative papers
with sly and slanted propaganda.

50
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:53,429
He then proceeded
through an equally..

51
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,057
..tilted review of the day's events..

52
00:03:57,141 --> 00:04:00,519
..with McCarthy dominating his words,
actions, attitudes.

53
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:02,479
So on.

54
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:08,193
- It's O'Brian. - He didn't get
the Scotch, that's all.

55
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:11,697
- Is it grammatically correct?
- I'll have that cigarette, Ed.

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,285
- Thanks, Shirley.
- Oh. - Mmh. - Thankyou.

57
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,745
Joe... Shirley...

58
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,960
It doesn't matter.

59
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:31,341
To Jack Gould!

60
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,345
- To Jack! To Jack! To Jack Gould!
- To Jack Gould!

61
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:36,430
I love Jack Gould!

62
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,933
May he rest in peace.

63
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:44,980
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Fred, congratulations! - Thankyou.

64
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:48,149
I got such a hangover
to go along with the ulcer.

65
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,110
All the ad guys on the 3rd floor
watched the show.

66
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:52,195
Got a good review
in the NewYork Times. Jack Gould.

67
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,655
We're putting out a press release..

68
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:56,616
..saying that calls came in
15 to 1 in favor of the show. - Really?

69
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,077
- Yeah. - 15 to 1?
- We got calls from everywhere.

70
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:02,706
- East Coast or West Coast?
- Yeah. Kansas City, Cincinnati....

71
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:04,833
Mr. Paley...

72
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:08,086
- Morning, Fred.
- Morning, Mr. Paley.

73
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,217
How's your wife?

74
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:16,845
She's fine.
We're getting ready to move.

75
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:20,014
- Really? Where to? - Riverdale.
We found a nice house there.

76
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,099
It's nice there.

77
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,017
Yes, sir.

78
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,067
Excuse me.

79
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:35,113
Fred! McCarthy wants William Buckley
to do his rebuttal.

80
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:37,448
I said no.

81
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:40,284
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,667
Hey, Johnny!

83
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:50,169
- Radulovich has been reinstated.
- What?!

84
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:53,005
Radulovich.... Guys!
Radulovich has been reinstated.

85
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,966
- Jesse! Jesse!
- Where is Ed?

86
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:57,593
- He's in the bullpen. Why?
What's going on? - Jess!

87
00:05:57,677 --> 00:05:59,178
Got some very good news.

88
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:02,890
Special announcement
from the Secretary of the Air Force!

89
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:05,017
Fellas! Listen up! Everyone!

90
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:08,020
I have decided
that it is consistent..

91
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:10,856
..with the interests
of the National Security to retain..

92
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,235
..Lieutenant Radulovich
in the United StatesAir Force. Stop.

93
00:06:14,402 --> 00:06:17,738
He is not, in my opinion,
a security risk. Full stop.

94
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:23,994
There you go. Harold E. Talbott,
Secretary from theAir Force.

95
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:25,663
Great job!

96
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:27,665
- Make a copy of that for me!
- I will do, Fred!

97
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:29,708
Back to work, guys!
We got a lot of work to do.

98
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,043
This means something.

99
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:32,711
- Good news, huh?
- Congratulations!

100
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:36,841
- This absolutely means something.
- Absolutely. This is the start of....

101
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:44,848
Palmer!

102
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:49,979
The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you.

103
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:54,608
When?

104
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:56,318
Tomorrow.

105
00:06:57,236 --> 00:07:00,614
I don't want you to get paranoid,
they're talking to everybody.

106
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:01,740
Any ideas?

107
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:04,952
Just tell them what you know.

108
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:07,746
- Now is that testimony true?
- No, sir, it is not.

109
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,041
Not at any time have I been
a member of the Communist Party..

110
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:13,460
..and I have never seen
a Communist card.

111
00:07:13,544 --> 00:07:15,879
- You've never seen a Communist card?
- That's right.

112
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:17,923
Have you ever attended
any Communist meetings?

113
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:19,633
No, sir, never.

114
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:21,969
Have you ever subscribed
to The Daily Worker?

115
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:25,847
No, sir. I didn't subscribe to it
and I wouldn't pay for it.

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,853
Uh... Now, Mrs. Markward,
who was working for the FBI,..

117
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:35,899
..who joined the Communist Party
under orders from the FBI,..

118
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:39,194
..has testified that while
she never met you personally..

119
00:07:39,403 --> 00:07:42,614
..at a Communist meeting
that your name was on the list..

120
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,866
..of Communists
who were paying dues.

121
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:48,119
Uh... Can you shed
any light upon that?

122
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:51,873
No, sir. I don't even know
what the dues are..

123
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,544
..or where they were paid.
- So you have never paid any money..

124
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,421
..to the Communist Party.

125
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:00,882
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

126
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,176
You've never paid
any dues, payment....

127
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:04,928
Thank you very much, Leo!

128
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,681
Good work, Joe, Charlie.

129
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:09,641
Now what is the show?

130
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:12,477
Is it defending Annie Lee Moss
as not being a Communist?

131
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,146
- Or is it her Constitutional rights?
- Both. - The latter.

132
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,690
We're much better sticking out
the Constitutional issues.

133
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:19,484
- Agreed?
- The woman is not a Communist spy.

134
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:22,195
Joe McCarthy said that they have
a spy in the Pentagon,..

135
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:23,988
..that spy has gotten
into the code room,..

136
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,824
..and that that spy
is Annie Lee Moss.

137
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:28,409
I've got NewYorkTimes reports.
McCarthy asserts he has..

138
00:08:28,493 --> 00:08:31,329
..a new red link toArmy. Quote,
"Senator McCarthy charged today.."

139
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,957
"..that the Army now employs
a woman in its code room.."

140
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,626
"..who was, and still may be,
an active Communist."

141
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,211
It's the front page
of the New YorkTimes.

142
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:41,965
No sooner is he done chastising the
other committee members for wanting..

143
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:45,009
..to push into the afternoon,
than what? Seven questions in,..

144
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:46,719
..he ducks out, leaves....
- Right.

145
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:49,806
- He leaves. - It's all over
the headlines, all over the country.

146
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,474
Get me copies from any newspaper..

147
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:53,184
..that printed anything
about that assertion.

148
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:56,604
That's a good idea. You should get
the Cincinnati Inquirer.

149
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:59,732
- Chicago. - Couple other pieces
I think we should include.

150
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:02,944
The fact that there's 3Annie Lee Moss's
in the phone book.

151
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:06,072
There are 2 Robert Halls,
one's colored, one's white.

152
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:08,074
We have some footage
of the empty chair.

153
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:11,327
I think that says it all.
Just that picture of McCarthy not....

154
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,247
McCarthy leaving the hearing
after 7 questions..

155
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,499
..and then we'll cut
to the shot of the chair.

156
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:19,251
- We gotta do something about it.
- All right, so....

157
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:23,214
Excuse me. Mr. Murrow!
McCarthy wantsApril 6th.

158
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,302
Thank you, Natalie.

159
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:36,185
Fine. If Charlie shoots it, we get
to see it first. We should offer.

160
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:38,854
- It's a long shot.
- What the hell could McCarthy do?

161
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:41,440
Is he gonna debate himself?
We just used his words!

162
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:46,987
Johnny! Johnny! We know
what it's going to be.

163
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:50,074
He's going to come after me.
There's nothing more he can do.

164
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,660
He's gonna bet that
a Senator trumps a newsman.

165
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:54,620
He'll lose.

166
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,664
Not if we're playing bridge.

167
00:09:58,374 --> 00:10:01,251
- I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean
to interrupt. - Hey, Don.

168
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,504
- It's getting fun now!
- Ed, you have a minute?

169
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:07,591
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- All right, boys. Playtime's over.

170
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:09,343
We have 4 days..

171
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:12,096
..to do a 28 minute show.
- Yeah. - All right.

172
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,639
All right, go ahead.
Hi, Mary.

173
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:15,432
Hello, Mr. Hollenbeck.
Mr. Murrow...

174
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,351
- Could you give us a moment?
- Sure.

175
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:20,312
Thank you, dear.

176
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:24,775
I have to ask you something, Ed.
It's about O'Brian.

177
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,777
- O'Brian doesn't matter.
- He's killing me, Ed.

178
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,654
He doesn't amount to that much
in the newsroom.

179
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:30,155
We've got to let that guy have it.

180
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:33,533
We're not going after O'Brian. I will
not take on McCarthy and Hearst.

181
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:34,910
I can't defeat them both.

182
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:39,289
Just don't read the papers.
Or don't read O'Brian, anyway.

183
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:46,797
Okay. I guess not.

184
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,174
Sorry, Don.

185
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,148
Although Mrs. Moss
offered to testify,..

186
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,360
..Senator McCarthy suggested
that she was too sick.

187
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:12,155
- She agreed.... - Mr. Cohn wanted
to know about Mrs. Moss's connection....

188
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,909
....to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,..

189
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,160
..so help you God?

190
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:23,625
May we get your full name
for the record, please?

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,335
Annie Lee Moss.

192
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:28,129
- M-O-S-S?
- That's right.

193
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:31,716
Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record,
for your information,..

194
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,010
..for the information
of your counsel,..

195
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,471
..that you are not here because..

196
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:42,852
..you are considered important
in the Communist apparatus.

197
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:46,481
We have the testimony that you are,
and have been, a Communist.

198
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,069
We are rather curious, however,
to know how you suddenly..

199
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:53,780
..were shifted from..

200
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,743
..a worker in a cafeteria
to the code room.

201
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:02,330
I am today much more interested..

202
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,793
..in the handling of your case..

203
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:10,755
..by your superiors
than in your own personal activities.

204
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,301
However, counsel will question you
about your own activities also.

205
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,721
- Mr. Chairman!
- We will not hear from counsel.

206
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,307
You have been told what the rule is.

207
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:24,644
If you have anything to say,
say it through your client.

208
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,068
Chairman. Did you begin work
at the General Accounting Office in..

209
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:35,154
..1 945?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,284
And, prior to that time,
had you been a cafeteria worker?

211
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:41,702
Yes, I had.

212
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:46,332
I see. While in the Pentagon,
since 1 950,..

213
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,418
..have you had any connections
with coded messages?

214
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:51,462
Have you ever handled
coded messages?

215
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:55,090
- No more than to transmit 'em.
- Pardon me?

216
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,593
No more than to transmit
the message.

217
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,054
Than to transmit them?
Did you transmit codes?

218
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:02,848
To receive or transmit messages
was all I had to do.

219
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:05,559
And I've never been
into a courtroom in my life.

220
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,394
Do you know the..

221
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:11,065
..type of classification....

222
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:15,319
- Do you know if they were secret,
top secret, confidential? - No, sir.

223
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:18,947
- You wouldn't know the degree
of classification? - No, sir.

224
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:20,407
I see.

225
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:24,786
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to excuse myself, I've got..

226
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:30,000
..a rather important appointment
to workon right now..

227
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:34,338
..and I wonder if, Senator Mundt,
you would take over as Chairman?

228
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:40,844
- Chairman. Uh...
- Cohn.

229
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:43,972
I have no further questions
of this witness at this time.

230
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:48,185
We have the testimony of Mrs. Markward,
the undercover agent for the FBI,..

231
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:52,022
..stating thatAnnie Lee Moss
was a member, a dues-paying member..

232
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:53,857
..of the Communist Party,..

233
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,610
..the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

234
00:13:56,693 --> 00:14:00,030
We have corroboration
of that testimony by another..

235
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:03,283
..witness who was called
before the Committee..

236
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,202
..and gave a sworn statement
to the effect..

237
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:07,954
..that she also knew Mrs. Moss
as a member..

238
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:10,081
..of the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

239
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:14,419
She's already lost her job. She's been
suspended because of this action.

240
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,715
I'm not defending her. If she's
a Communist, I want her exposed.

241
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:22,719
But to make these statements
as we've got corroborating evidence..

242
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:26,347
..that she is a Communist,
under these circumstances,..

243
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:30,059
..I thinkshe's entitled to have it
produced here in her presence..

244
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:33,521
..and let the public know about it
and let her know about it.

245
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:40,236
I don't like to try people
by hearsay evidence.

246
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:44,365
I'd like to get the witnesses here
and try them..

247
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:47,785
..by testimony, under oath.

248
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:51,664
The Chair will rule
that the comment of Mr. Cohn..

249
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,374
..be stricken from the record.

250
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,169
I didn't ask that, Mr. Chairman!

251
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:58,880
....whether we should try to produce
a witness in public..

252
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:02,175
..because the FBI may have
her undercover and we don't want to....

253
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:06,804
You can't strike these statements
made by counsel here as to evidence..

254
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:11,100
..that we're having and withholding.
You cannot strike that from the press..

255
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:16,314
..nor from the public mind
once it's planted there. That's the..

256
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:19,567
..evil of it!

257
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:23,070
- Well, I'd look at it....
- I don't think it's fair to a witness,..

258
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,614
..to a citizen of this country,..

259
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:26,782
..to bring them up here
and cross-examine them,..

260
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,284
..then when they get through, say,..

261
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:31,329
.."The FBI has got something on you
that condemns you."

262
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:34,123
- The Chair agrees....
- It is not sworn testimony,..

263
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:37,835
..it's convicting people
by rumor and hearsay and innuendo.

264
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:43,132
You will notice that neither Senator
McClellan or Senator Symington..

265
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:47,553
..nor this reporter know or claim
that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist.

266
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,641
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

267
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:52,725
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

268
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:11,660
One month ago tonight we presented
a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.

269
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,871
We labeled it as controversial.

270
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:18,083
Most of that report consisted
of words and pictures of the Senator.

271
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,210
At that time, we said,..

272
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:24,298
.."If the Senator believes we have done
violence to his words or pictures,.."

273
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,967
"..if he desires to speak,
to answer himself,.."

274
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,179
"..an opportunity would be
afforded him on this program."

275
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,182
The Senator sought the opportunity
after 3 weeks..

276
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:38,353
..because he was very busy and wished
adequate time to prepare his reply.

277
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:39,938
We agreed.

278
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:44,609
We placed no restrictions on the manner
of the presentation of his reply..

279
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:47,821
..and we suggested that we would not
take time to comment..

280
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:49,656
..on this particular program.

281
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:54,161
Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,
junior Senator from Wisconsin.

282
00:16:55,579 --> 00:17:01,918
Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow,
Educational Director of the CBS,..

283
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,255
..devoted his program
to an attack..

284
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:08,550
..on the work of the US Senate
Investigating Committee,..

285
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:11,177
..and on me personally
as its Chairman.

286
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:15,640
Now, over the past 4 years,
he has made repeated attacks upon me..

287
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,892
..and those fighting Communists.

288
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,522
Of course, neither Joe McCarthy
nor Edward R. Murrow..

289
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,109
..is of any great importance
as individuals.

290
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:28,695
We are only important..

291
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:33,074
..in our relation to the great struggle
to preserve our American liberties.

292
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:38,246
Now ordinarily, I wouldn't take time
out from the important work at hand..

293
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:40,248
..to answer Murrow.

294
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:42,292
However, in this case,..

295
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:46,171
..I feel justified in doing so
because Murrow is the symbol,..

296
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:48,006
..the leader..

297
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:53,428
..and the cleverest of the jackal pack
which is always found at the throat..

298
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:57,890
..of anyone who dares to expose
individual Communists and traitors.

299
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,019
And I am compelled by the fact,..

300
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:03,938
..to say to you
that Mr. Edward R. Murrow,..

301
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:07,066
..as far back as 20 years ago,..

302
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:11,154
..was engaged in propaganda
for Communist causes.

303
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:15,408
For example, the Institute
of International Education,..

304
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,869
..of which he was
theActing Director,..

305
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:21,414
..was chosen to act
as a representative..

306
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:23,457
..by a Soviet agency..

307
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:30,006
..to do a job which would normally
be done by the Russian secret police.

308
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:34,593
Mr. Murrow, by his own admission,
was a member of the IWW,..

309
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:37,221
..that's the Industrial Workers
of the World,..

310
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:40,099
..a terrorist organization
cited as subversive..

311
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:43,185
..by an Attorney General
of the United States.

312
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:46,689
Mr. Murrow said on this program
and I quote,..

313
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:51,193
.."The actions of the junior
Senator from Wisconsin.."

314
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:56,574
"..have given considerable comfort
to the enemy."

315
00:18:57,199 --> 00:19:01,120
That is the language of our statute
of treason, rather strong language.

316
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:07,209
If I am giving comfort to our enemies,
I ought not to be in the Senate.

317
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:09,461
If, on the other hand,
Mr. Murrow..

318
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,006
..is giving comfort to our enemies,..

319
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:14,717
..he ought not to be brought
into the homes..

320
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:18,512
..of millions of Americans
by the CBS.

321
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:20,097
And I want to assure you..

322
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:24,226
..that I will not be deterred..

323
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:30,816
..by the attacks of the Murrows,
the Lattimores, the Fosters,..

324
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:35,571
..The Daily Worker
or the Communist Party itself.

325
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:40,868
And I make no claim to leadership.

326
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:44,746
In complete humility..

327
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:50,711
..I do ask you and every American
who loves this country..

328
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,046
..to join with me.

329
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,201
[Everyone talks about the weather]

330
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:26,871
[Wherever you look
on America's modern farms,.]

331
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:31,626
[..aluminum is on the job, helping the
farmer do something about the weather]

332
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:35,755
[Aluminum for the farm
is one more example of how Alcoa,.]

333
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,215
[..since 1888,..]

334
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:41,386
[..has continued to pioneer
new uses for this vital metal]

335
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,099
[New uses of aluminum that mean
better farms and better farming]

336
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:50,395
[The aluminum from the nation's
first and leading producer,.]

337
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:54,440
[..Alcoa,
Aluminum Company of America]

338
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:57,443
Last week, Senator McCarthy
appeared on this program..

339
00:20:57,527 --> 00:21:00,029
..to correct any errors
he might have thought we made..

340
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:01,698
..in our report of March 9th.

341
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:05,201
Since he made no reference to any
statements of fact that we made,..

342
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:08,037
..we must conclude
that he found no errors of fact.

343
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:11,457
He proved again
that anyone who exposes him,..

344
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:16,170
..anyone who doesn't share his disregard
for decency and human dignity..

345
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:18,798
..and the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution..

346
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:21,592
..must be either a Communist
or a fellow traveler.

347
00:21:22,176 --> 00:21:23,970
I fully expected this treatment.

348
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:28,224
The Senator added this reporter's name
to a long list of individuals..

349
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:31,811
..and institutions he has accused
of serving the Communist cause.

350
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:33,938
His proposition is very simple:

351
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:37,775
..anyone who criticizes or opposes
Senator McCarthy's methods..

352
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:39,402
..must be a Communist.

353
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:43,864
And if that be true, there are
an awful lot of Communists in the USA.

354
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:48,160
For the record, let's consider briefly
some of the Senator's charges.

355
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:50,329
He claimed, but offered no proof,..

356
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:53,749
..that I had been a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World.

357
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,000
That is false.

358
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:59,380
I was never a member of the IWW,
never applied for membership.

359
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:03,092
The Senator charged
that Professor Harold Laski,..

360
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:06,220
..a British scholar and politician,
dedicated a book to me.

361
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:07,388
That's true.

362
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,141
He is dead.
He was a socialist, I am not.

363
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:13,894
He was a civilized individual..

364
00:22:13,978 --> 00:22:17,231
..who did not insist upon agreement
with his political principles..

365
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:20,150
..as a pre-condition
for conversation or friendship.

366
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,820
I do not agree
with his political ideas.

367
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:26,240
Laski, as he makes clear
in the introduction,..

368
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:29,785
..dedicated the book to me,
not because of political agreement,..

369
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:33,705
..but because he held my wartime
broadcast from London in high regard.

370
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:35,916
And the dedication so reads.

371
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,962
I believed 20 years ago
and I believe today..

372
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,049
..that mature Americans can engage
in conversation and controversy,..

373
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:47,386
..the clash of ideas, with Communists
anywhere in the world..

374
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:50,013
..without becoming
contaminated or converted.

375
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:53,392
I believe that our faith,
our conviction,..

376
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:56,269
..our determination
are stronger than theirs..

377
00:22:56,561 --> 00:23:00,982
..and that we can successfully compete,
not only in the area of bombs,..

378
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:03,276
..but in the area of ideas.

379
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:08,198
I have worked with CBS
for more than 19 years.

380
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:12,327
The company has subscribed fully
to my integrity and responsibility..

381
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,830
..as a broadcaster
and as a loyal American.

382
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:19,125
I require no lectures from the junior
Senator from Wisconsin..

383
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,836
..as to the dangers
or terrors of Communism.

384
00:23:22,963 --> 00:23:25,340
Having searched my conscience
and my files,..

385
00:23:25,423 --> 00:23:28,468
..I cannot contend that
I have always been right or wise,..

386
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:31,680
..but I have attempted to pursue
the truth with diligence..

387
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:32,889
..and to report it,..

388
00:23:32,973 --> 00:23:36,059
..even though, as in this case,
I had been warned in advance..

389
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:39,688
..that I would be subjected
to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.

390
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:44,776
We shall hope to deal with matters
of more vital interest next week.

391
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,278
Good night, and good luck.

392
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:58,790
In the last analysis, the Senator was
perched on the television high dive..

393
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:01,167
..and all prepared
to make a resounding splash.

394
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:03,962
He jumped beautifully,
but he neglected to check first..

395
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:06,839
..where he was going to land.
It must have been a shock..

396
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:10,426
..to discover that Mr. Murrow
had drained the water out of the pool.

397
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:13,888
- Is that the Times? Gould?
- Yeah, it's Jack Gould.

398
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:16,057
- He's a hell of a writer.
- Yes, he is.

399
00:24:16,683 --> 00:24:19,352
- If we can afford him!
- Stanton's got a public opinion....

400
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:21,020
Senate's investigating McCarthy.

401
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:23,147
What?

402
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:26,901
TheArmy's charging that McCarthy
and Cohn exercised undue pressure..

403
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:30,363
..to get preferential treatment
for Schine. - Who's the source?

404
00:24:30,446 --> 00:24:34,492
- Got a second source? - There isn't,
but this is coming out in 2 hours.

405
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:37,912
- Who's heading up the investigation?
- It's not gonna be McCarthy!

406
00:24:37,995 --> 00:24:39,789
- Really?
- What happened?

407
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:42,833
- Also get me the Washington Post!
- What's going on?

408
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,418
It's Williams
for Jack Thompson.

409
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:46,295
The Senate's investigating McCarthy.

410
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:49,256
There is an added bit of comedy
to this whole story.

411
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,342
The Committee cannot convene
for several days..

412
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:54,178
..because Senator McCarthy
has a slight case of laryngitis.

413
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:58,140
And he must recover
over the desert air of Arizona.

414
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:04,980
- But Stevens is going after him
and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah.

415
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:07,483
They're gonna allow each side
to call witnesses..

416
00:25:07,566 --> 00:25:09,401
..and be privy to other testimony.

417
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:13,572
- Fred, we still have a meeting!
- We're gonna go to talk to Thompson.

418
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:17,618
No, thanks, Jack. Bye.

419
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:21,455
Freddy, we're a hit.
Right up there with "Howdy Dowdy"!

420
00:25:22,748 --> 00:25:24,750
Can I have
an outlet satellite, please?

421
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:33,217
- 74, 76, 47. Thank you.
- Murrayville 3, 1 -2-7-6.

422
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:56,365
The fact of newscaster
Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday..

423
00:25:56,448 --> 00:26:00,410
..does not remove from the record
that peculiar history..

424
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,166
..of the leftist slanting of news
indulged consistently by the CBS.

425
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:10,796
Hollenbeck was what most astute
students of CBS's strange..

426
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:13,465
..and questionable new methods
considered..

427
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:19,137
.."typical of its newscasters".
By Jack O'Brian.

428
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:55,399
Oh, yeah. I like it like that.

429
00:27:57,651 --> 00:28:01,572
One of the best programs I ever heard
was called "CBS Views The Press".

430
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,742
A great many people liked it,
some didn't,..

431
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,745
..but no one ever called it
anything but honest.

432
00:28:08,162 --> 00:28:11,957
It was the workof an honest reporter.
Don Hollenbeck.

433
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,294
He also worked occasionally
on "See It Now".

434
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:18,839
He did the 11 p.m. news
over some of these stations.

435
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:22,259
He had been sick lately
and he died this morning.

436
00:28:22,843 --> 00:28:25,429
The police said
it was suicide... gas.

437
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,432
Not much of an obit.

438
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:32,061
But, at least we got our facts
straight, and it was brief.

439
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:35,647
And that's all Don Hollenbeck
would have asked.

440
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:38,400
Good night, and good luck.

441
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:46,158
Got to be in Philadelphia
this morning.

442
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:48,744
What time is your train?

443
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,829
8:00.

444
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:55,000
- Charlie going with you?
- Uh-huh.

445
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,218
Here's a thought.

446
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:08,430
What if we're wrong?

447
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:12,351
We're not wrong.

448
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:15,771
We're not going to look back..

449
00:29:17,814 --> 00:29:19,941
..and saywe protected
the wrong side?

450
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,699
Protected them from what? In the name
of what? What would we be preserving?

451
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:32,245
Argument could be made,
"for the greater good".

452
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:37,208
Not once you give it all away.
It's no good then.

453
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:40,295
It's just a thought.

454
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:51,765
Senator, may we not drop this? We know
he belonged to the Lawyer's Guild.

455
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:54,434
And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me.

456
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:58,480
- I did you, I think, no personal
injury, Mr. Cohn. - No, sir.

457
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,191
- I meant to do you
no personal injury. - No.

458
00:30:01,357 --> 00:30:04,444
And if I did, I beg your pardon.

459
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:10,325
Let us not assassinate this lad
further, Senator. You've done enough.

460
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:14,203
- Let's... let's....
- Have you no sense of decency, sir?

461
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:19,542
At long last, have you left
no sense of decency?

462
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:23,921
- I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.
- Senator, I think it hurts you, too.

463
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:27,550
- I'd like to finish this.
- Have you some private reservation..

464
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:31,429
..when you take the oath
that you will tell the whole truth..

465
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:34,974
..that lets you be the judge
of what you will testify to?

466
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:38,770
The answer is there's no reservation
about telling the whole truth.

467
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:44,275
Thank you, sir. Then tell us
who delivered the documents to you!

468
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:47,403
I don't want to mean that
this new fashion is not chic.

469
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:51,240
- I think it's just no good for me.
- Uh, not for you.

470
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:54,243
Milko, anything you care to say
on that subject?

471
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:55,703
I think no comment.

472
00:30:59,332 --> 00:31:02,710
It's got to be there. If you can't
find it, I can't write about it.

473
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:05,212
- Check again.
- Charlie said he dropped it off.

474
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,466
- Charlie said he dropped....
- Shirley, can I see you a minute?

475
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:10,301
- I got to call you back.
- Joe!

476
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:11,427
You, too.

477
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:22,813
Close the door.

478
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:27,151
Have a seat.

479
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,907
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah.

480
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:37,661
Uh, you both are aware
that there's a policy at CBS..

481
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:39,872
..that no two employees
can be married.

482
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:46,086
I want to ask you a question,
but I don't want you to answer it.

483
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,921
I want you to consider it.

484
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:50,758
I know you two are married.

485
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:53,969
Everyone knows.

486
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:56,430
That's not my question.

487
00:31:56,805 --> 00:31:59,892
In the next few weeks
I have to lay off a couple of people.

488
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:02,811
We're making some significant cuts
across the board.

489
00:32:04,104 --> 00:32:05,731
I wanted you to know that,..

490
00:32:05,939 --> 00:32:08,900
..because you could save
someone else being fired.

491
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:14,948
I'm asking you to consider
making this decision a little easier.

492
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:18,952
I don't need an answer now.

493
00:32:20,495 --> 00:32:22,539
Just think about it.

494
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:25,208
Good.

495
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:38,388
- Well, Joe...
- Well?

496
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:42,017
- Sure we're gonna miss you
around here. - I'll pack my things.

497
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,981
- I think it's for the best.
- We'll find out!

498
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:51,901
Mrs. Wershba...

499
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:55,947
Everybody knew.

500
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:06,958
Natalie, did he say
what it was about?

501
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:09,919
No. Just that he wanted to talk
to you in his office.

502
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:26,769
Uh-oh!

503
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:33,651
The problem isn't simply
that you've lost your sponsor.

504
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:36,362
With Alcoa, "See It Now"
still loses money.

505
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:37,822
The fee is 50,000 dollars.

506
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:40,491
Last week's episode we did
for less than 50,000 dollars.

507
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:42,493
Fred, you're speaking
beyond your competence.

508
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,996
We'll certainly find another sponsor.

509
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:48,791
"64,000 Dollar Question" brings in
over 80,000 in sponsors..

510
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,085
..and it costs one-third
of what you do.

511
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:54,171
Ed, I've got Tuesday night
programming that's number one.

512
00:33:54,255 --> 00:33:57,717
People want to enjoy themselves.
They don't want a civics lesson.

513
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,720
- What do you want, Bill?
- I don't want to get a stomachache..

514
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:03,306
..every time you take on
a controversial subject.

515
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:08,102
I'm afraid that's the price
you have to be willing to pay.

516
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,481
Let's walk very carefully
through these next few moments.

517
00:34:12,565 --> 00:34:14,984
The content of what we're doing
is more important..

518
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:18,446
..than what some guy in Cincinnati....
- It's what you're doing, Ed. Not me.

519
00:34:18,529 --> 00:34:19,655
Not Frank Stanton. You.

520
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,034
"CBS News", "See It Now"
all belong toyou, Bill.

521
00:34:24,118 --> 00:34:25,244
You wouldn't know it.

522
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:31,792
- What is ityou want? Credit?
- I never censored a single program.

523
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:37,172
I hold on to affiliates
whowanted entertainment from us.

524
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:39,341
I fight to keep the license..

525
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:42,803
..with the very same politicians
that you are bringing down,..

526
00:34:42,886 --> 00:34:47,933
..and I never,
never said no to you. Never.

527
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:52,438
I would argue that we have done
very well by one another.

528
00:34:53,564 --> 00:34:55,482
I would argue that this network..

529
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:59,778
..is defined by what the news
department has accomplished.

530
00:34:59,862 --> 00:35:03,907
And I would also argue that never saying
no is not the same as not censoring.

531
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:07,160
Really? You should teach journalism.
You and Mr. Friendly.

532
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:14,876
Let me ask you this:

533
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:18,380
..why didn't you correct McCarthy..

534
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:21,508
..when he said that Alger Hiss
was convicted of treason?

535
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:25,387
He was only convicted of perjury.
You corrected everything else.

536
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:29,266
Did you not want the appearance
of defending a known Communist?

537
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:32,185
I would argue that everyone censors,
including you.

538
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:37,899
What do you want to do, Bill?

539
00:35:41,903 --> 00:35:44,865
I'm taking your program
from a half an hour to an hour.

540
00:35:44,948 --> 00:35:48,451
And it won't be a weekly program
and it won't be Tuesday nights.

541
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:51,454
- When would it be?
- Sunday afternoons.

542
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,252
- How many episodes?
- 5.

543
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:01,923
Why don't you just fire me, Bill?

544
00:36:02,048 --> 00:36:04,426
I don't think
it's what either of us wants.

545
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:10,265
You owe me 5 shows.

546
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:22,902
- You won't like the subject matter.
- Probably not.

547
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:25,238
Fred, I'll need you for a moment.

548
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:42,296
- Thank you, Mary.
- Goodbye, Mr. Friendly.

549
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:51,848
- He wants me to lay a few people off.
- I'm sure he does.

550
00:36:52,014 --> 00:36:55,059
Let's do our first show
about the downfall of television.

551
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:01,607
- Senate's gonna vote to censure
McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably.

552
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:04,902
- And then what happens?
- He sits in the back row. - Right.

553
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:09,448
- They keep him in the Senate.
They don't kick him out. - No, he stays.

554
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:22,294
Well, we might as well
go down swinging.

555
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:29,218
Did you know the most trusted man
in America is Milton Berle?

556
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:31,262
See, you should have worn a dress!

557
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:35,599
- How does a Scotch sound?
- Scotch sounds good.

558
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:39,186
- Did you know Joe and Shirley
were married? - Sure.

559
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,313
- Did everyone know?
- Pretty much.

560
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:44,191
We are proud because
from the beginning of this nation..

561
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,110
..man can walk upright.

562
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:51,073
No matter who he is
or who she is.

563
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:55,911
He can walk upright
and meet his friend or his enemy.

564
00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:59,832
And he does not fear
that because that enemy..

565
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,960
..may be in a position
of great power..

566
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:08,715
..that he can be suddenly
thrown in jail..

567
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:13,762
..to rot there without charges
and with no recourse to justice.

568
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:18,892
We have the Habeas CorpusAct
and we respect it.

569
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:22,938
I began by saying that our history
will be what we make it.

570
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:25,232
If we go on as we are,..

571
00:38:25,524 --> 00:38:29,111
..then history will take its revenge,
and retribution will not limp..

572
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:30,612
..in catching up with us.

573
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:36,118
Just once in a while, let us exalt the
importance of ideas and information.

574
00:38:37,494 --> 00:38:40,956
Let us dream to the extent of saying
that on a given Sunday night..

575
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,291
..the time normally
occupied by Ed Sullivan..

576
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:47,170
..is given over to a clinical survey
on the state of American education.

577
00:38:47,254 --> 00:38:50,674
And a weekor two later, the time
normally used by Steve Allen..

578
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:55,053
..is devoted to a thorough-going study
of American policy in the Middle East.

579
00:38:56,012 --> 00:38:59,557
Would the corporate image of their
respective sponsors be damaged?

580
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:03,061
Would the shareholders rise up
in their wrath and complain?

581
00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:04,854
Would anything happen..

582
00:39:04,938 --> 00:39:08,733
..other than a few million people would
have received a little illumination..

583
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:12,070
..on subjects that may well determine
the future of this country..

584
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:14,656
..and therefore the future
of the corporations?

585
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:18,827
To those who say, "People wouldn't
look, they wouldn't be interested,.."

586
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,913
"..they're too complacent,
indifferent and insulated"..

587
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:26,000
..I can only reply: there is,
in one reporter's opinion,..

588
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:29,087
..considerable evidence
against that contention.

589
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:33,132
But even if they are right,
what have they got to lose?

590
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:34,968
Because if they are right,..

591
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:37,095
..and this instrument
is good for nothing..

592
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:39,722
..but to entertain,
amuse and insulate,..

593
00:39:40,431 --> 00:39:42,308
..then the tube isflickering now..

594
00:39:42,392 --> 00:39:45,478
..and we will soon see
that the whole struggle is lost.

595
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:47,980
This instrument can teach.

596
00:39:48,398 --> 00:39:50,900
It can illuminate
and it can even inspire.

597
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:55,655
But it can do so only to the extent
that humans are determined to use it..

598
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:57,156
..towards those ends.

599
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:01,160
Otherwise,
it is merely wires and lights..

600
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:03,037
..in a box.

601
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:08,584
Good night, and good luck.
