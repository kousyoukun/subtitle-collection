1
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,289
In 1935, Ed Murrow
began his careerwith CBS.

2
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,750
When World WarTwo broke out,..

3
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,627
..his voice brought
the battle of Britain home to us..

4
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,172
..through his "This Is London"
radio series.

5
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,632
He started with us all,..

6
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:53,178
..many of us here tonight,
when television was in its infancy,..

7
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:55,722
..with the news documentary show,
"See It Now".

8
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,640
He threw stones at giants.

9
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:01,978
Segregation, exploitation
of migrant workers,..

10
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:04,272
..apartheid, J. Edgar Hoover,..

11
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:09,277
..not the least of which, his historical
fight with Senator McCarthy.

12
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:14,032
He is the host of our enormously
popular show "Person to Person"..

13
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,535
..and tonight he is here
with his son, Casey,..

14
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:21,331
..wife, Janet, and all of you
who he's worked with,..

15
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:24,751
..inspired, lectured, and taught.

16
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:27,212
Ladies and gentlemen,..

17
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:31,466
..the Radio-Television News Directors'
Association and Foundation welcomes..

18
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:33,802
..Mr. Edward R. Murrow.

19
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:56,616
This might just do nobody any good.

20
00:03:57,492 --> 00:04:01,246
At the end of this discourse
a few people may accuse this reporter..

21
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,540
..of fouling
his own comfortable nest,..

22
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:07,502
..and your organization may be
accused of having given hospitality..

23
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:09,963
..to heretical
and even dangerous ideas.

24
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:13,299
But the elaborate structure
of networks,..

25
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:17,220
..advertising agencies, and sponsors
will not be shaken or altered.

26
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:21,516
It is my desire, if not my duty,
to try to talk to you journeymen..

27
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,145
..with some candor about what
is happening to radio and television.

28
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:27,188
And if what I say is responsible,..

29
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:30,191
..I alone am responsible
for the saying of it.

30
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,570
Our history will be
what we make of it.

31
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:38,033
And if there are any historians
about 50 or 100 years from now,..

32
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,743
..and there should be preserved..

33
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:42,662
..the kinescopes of one week
of all three networks,..

34
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,750
..they will there find recorded
in black and white, and in color,..

35
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:49,377
..evidence of decadence,
escapism,..

36
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:53,089
..and insulation from the realities
of the world in which we live.

37
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,427
We are currently wealthy, fat,
comfortable, and complacent.

38
00:04:58,303 --> 00:05:01,973
We have a built-in allergy to
unpleasant or disturbing information.

39
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:04,392
Our mass media reflect this.

40
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,771
But unless we get up off
our fat surpluses..

41
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:10,315
..and recognize
that television in the main..

42
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:14,611
..is being used to distract, delude,
amuse, and insulate us,..

43
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:17,405
..then television
and those who finance it,..

44
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:20,408
..those who look at it
and those who work at it..

45
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:23,328
..may see a totally
different picture too late.

46
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,503
Millie! Just the person
I wanted to see! Come here!

47
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:25,473
This goes at the top
of the Roy Campanella piece.

48
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:26,683
Yes! Give me a half an hour.

49
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:28,601
I may need it
a little quicker than that!

50
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,813
- Can I get some coffee first?
- Come on! Get me some coffee!

51
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:35,066
Morning, Johnny!

52
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,278
I have some new notes that go
with the Tito footage for Fred.

53
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:39,612
Fred's gonna be in
in an hour.

54
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:42,907
I already put them on his desk.
Can you just make sure that..

55
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:45,785
..he doesn't look at the film
until he reads the notes?

56
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:47,203
- Yes.
- Thank you.

57
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:48,580
Hey, Joe! Shirley!

58
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:52,500
- What's going on in here?
- What do you mean?

59
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,502
Two attractive people
alone in the copy room!

60
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:55,879
Don't tell Paley, he'll fire me.

61
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,464
He'll fire both of us, Shirley.

62
00:06:57,547 --> 00:07:00,342
- Rules are made to be broken!
- You can afford to say that.

63
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,222
Let me see this.

64
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:13,480
- It's simply a loyalty oath.
- To CBS? - And to America.

65
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,231
You promise to be a loyal American?

66
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:17,484
I know. All of the reporters
have signed this.

67
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,277
Who are you promising this to?
CBS?

68
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:21,363
Fred signed it.
Murrow signed it.

69
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:22,822
- Murrow signed it?
- Yeah.

70
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:26,034
Are you now
or have you ever been....

71
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:28,370
I thought it was a joke,
but there's a lot of pressure.

72
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:30,997
....on the Attorney General's list
of subversive groups?

73
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:33,291
- I don't know.
- Let's think about it.

74
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,961
What is it really saying? Is it a civil
liberties issue or censorship?

75
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,381
Am I simply stating to CBS
that I'm not a Communist?

76
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:41,800
- Murrow signed this?
- And Fred and Stanton.

77
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:45,053
- Maybe you should talkto Murrow.
- Maybe I should sign it.

78
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,015
If you don't sign this,
are you and I a target?

79
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,269
If I don't sign it,
they'll fire me.

80
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:00,735
Sign it.

81
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:03,321
Finally we can tell everyone
the truth.

82
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:08,034
If I could express it
in what's in my heart now,..

83
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,789
..I'd do it in the terms
of the poet who once said,..

84
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:16,751
.."Ah, 'tis but a dainty flower
I bring to you."

85
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:19,796
"Yes, 'tis but a violet,.."

86
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:22,257
"..glistening with dew."

87
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:26,803
"But still in its heart
there lie beauties concealed."

88
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,556
"So in our heart,.."

89
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:32,559
"..our love for you.."

90
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,146
"..lies unrevealed."

91
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:39,774
I used to..

92
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:50,952
..pride myself on the idea
that I was a bit... tough,..

93
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:58,960
..especially overthe past
18-19 months, when we've been..

94
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,630
..kicked around,
and bullwhipped, and damned.

95
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:05,258
I didn't thinkthat..

96
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:10,555
..I could be... touched very deeply.

97
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:13,016
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough, Leo.

98
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,143
- It's short.
- How long is the piece?

99
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:16,978
It's 4 minutes,
but we can cut it down.

100
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:19,856
It can't stand alone, but it might be
a nice companion piece.

101
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:22,275
Let's go through this one more time.
Palmer!

102
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:25,695
Yep, got a call from the office
of Senator Morse this morning,..

103
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:28,907
..interested in setting up
a debate possibly with Senator Kerr..

104
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,451
..over the comments
Bentsen made on last night's show.

105
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:34,788
Secretary of Agriculture? Good idea!
Can they do it by this week?

106
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:37,457
No, it would have to be 2 weeks
at the earliest,..

107
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,877
..depending on Morse's schedule.
But still it's a great idea.

108
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,297
Let's follow up on that.
"Hoover speaks on Benjamin Franklin."

109
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:47,509
We're having better luck
with Mr. Benjamin Franklin..

110
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:48,843
..than with Mr. Hoover.

111
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:51,388
It may progress better
as a "Person to Person".

112
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,932
"At home with Ben Franklin.
His electricity awards."

113
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:55,934
We've got the footage,
we need to contact him.

114
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:59,729
See if you can contact him and get the
shot. He wants to do the story. Joe!

115
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:01,564
Member Delbert Clark?.
No longer with us.

116
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,192
- New YorkTimes? - Yeah.
- Our friend at the Times.

117
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,986
This was yesterday morning,
they're saying it's....

118
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:10,782
- How old was he?
- 53. Sudden illness.

119
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:13,535
- Home of a friend.
- No, it's not an obit piece.

120
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:16,246
Natalie send some flowers
over there from us.

121
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:19,040
Couple things.
Case before the Supreme Court..

122
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:23,044
..involving the constitutionality of a
section of the Internal Security Act..

123
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:25,088
..provides for the deportation
of any alien..

124
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,924
..if he becomes a Communist
after entering this country.

125
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:29,551
Can you take this?

126
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:32,220
All right. McCarthy interrupting
his wedding trip..

127
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:35,807
..to take charge of the investigation
of Communist infiltration....

128
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,309
- Natalie, send some flowers.
- Poor Mrs. McCarthy!

129
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:40,520
May I finish?
It's national security!

130
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:43,398
- A real ladies' man!
- Well, they're in love.

131
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:48,278
We have no show for Tuesday, fellows.
So get out there and make some news.

132
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:52,449
Rob a bank. Mug an old lady.
Do something.

133
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,869
- You look at the Secretary Stevens
footage? - We will.

134
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:58,496
Watch it all the way to the end,
it's worth it.

135
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:01,291
Thank you, John.

136
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,585
There's not much there.

137
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,213
I can't tie it to the Eisenhower
in the back of the train piece.

138
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:10,884
- You ever spend any time in Detroit,
Fred? - Not recently.

139
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,513
There's a story here
in the Detroit News, Dexter, Michigan.

140
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:18,350
A kid named Milo Radulovich.

141
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:23,688
- Italian? - Irish. Air Force
kicked him out because his dad..

142
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:28,401
..read some Serbian newspaper.
- Was he a Communist? - I don't know.

143
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:30,320
- Who brought the charges?
- Air Force.

144
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:33,740
Charges were in a sealed envelope,
nobody saw them.

145
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:37,118
- Not even at the hearing? - He was
declared guilty without a trial..

146
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:38,953
..and told if he wanted
to keep his job..

147
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:42,332
..he had to denounce his father
and his sister. Thank you, Natalie.

148
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,876
- His sister?
- He told them to take a hike.

149
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:50,256
Let's send Joe and Charlie down there,
see if he's any good on camera.

150
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,634
Is he being brought
before the Committee?

151
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:54,344
No.

152
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,846
Then it's not McCarthy.

153
00:11:58,473 --> 00:11:59,474
Isn't it?

154
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:07,107
Milo Radulovich.

155
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:12,779
What happens to your children,..

156
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,782
..your 5-year-old and your 5-month-old
in terms of you?

157
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,827
If I am being judged
on my relatives,..

158
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:24,916
..are my children going
to be asked to denounce me?

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,045
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

160
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:34,759
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc..

161
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:37,178
..why their father
is a security risk?

162
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:42,809
If the thing is let stand
as it, the first recommendation,..

163
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:47,313
..was sent out by the board,
I see a chain reaction that..

164
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,400
..has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

165
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:58,408
Well, that's new.

166
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:01,244
You can't call this
a neutral piece.

167
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:04,622
The other side's been represented
rather well for the last 2 years.

168
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:06,291
The Air Force
hasn't gone on the record.

169
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:09,419
So you want to forego the standards
you've stuckto for 1 5 years,..

170
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:10,754
..both sides, no commentary.

171
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:13,840
- We all editorialize. - I'm just
making sure we identify what....

172
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:15,592
We're giving them
the information up front,..

173
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,260
..and we're asking them
to comment on it.

174
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:18,386
Frank, hold on.

175
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:20,805
I've searched my conscience.

176
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:24,184
I can't for the life of me
find any justification for this.

177
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:27,145
I simply cannot accept
that there are, on every story,..

178
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,272
..two equal and logical sides
to an argument.

179
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:32,317
- Call it editorializing, if you'd like.
- It is editorializing.

180
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,110
They'll have equal time
to defend themselves.

181
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,279
Do you understand the position
you're putting us in?

182
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:39,324
We are all in this together,
if the Senate wants to investigate....

183
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:40,450
Do me a favor,..

184
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,870
..avoid any big speeches about how
we're all in a big boat together!

185
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,163
Please, don't insult me.

186
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:49,834
I have to go back to Mr. Paley
and Alcoa, who sponsors your show..

187
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:52,671
..and also have
some military contracts,..

188
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:55,965
..and I have to tell them that
they're going to be in a tough bind..

189
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:58,093
..because of a beef you had
with Joe McCarthy.

190
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:01,304
- We're not going at McCarthy.
- You're starting the goddamn fire.

191
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:04,766
Excuse me. Mr. Friendly,
there's a Colonel Anderson to see you?

192
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:08,353
- Colonel? - He's in your office.
There are two of them.

193
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:13,400
Maybe they liked the transcript,
and want to compliment us on it.

194
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:15,026
Excuse me.

195
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:25,954
Go after Joe Kennedy.
We'll pay for it.

196
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,540
I've got a great story about Hoover.

197
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:34,963
You know how many shows
you're going to have to do..

198
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:38,133
..to make up for this? - And Judy
and her daughter Liza next week.

199
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:40,301
No, no.
You're interviewing Rin Tin Tin!

200
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,933
I'll talk to Mr. Paley.

201
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,354
Alcoa won't pay for the ads.

202
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:56,026
And we probably won't either.
But nobody'll stop you.

203
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,277
How much are the ads?

204
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:02,699
- 3,000.
- I'll split it with Fred.

205
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:07,620
He just won't have Christmas presents
for his kids this year.

206
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:11,166
- He's a Jew. - Don't tell him that,
he loves Christmas.

207
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:23,345
- To be clear, you did speak
with the lawyers? - Yes, we did.

208
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:26,723
And we read the transcript. We've not
been allowed to see the footage.

209
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:29,851
Mack is on a plane from Dexter
right now with the last interviews.

210
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,686
We'll be going
right down to the wire.

211
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,441
Your show airs tomorrow. How can we
possibly approve and check..

212
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:40,236
..your story in the limited amount
of time you have given us?

213
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,032
With all due respect, you have been
invited to participate in this piece,..

214
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:45,492
..not to approve it.

215
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:49,162
We are going with the story
that says that the U.S. Air Force..

216
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:51,790
..tried Milo Radulovich
without any evidence..

217
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:54,459
..and found him guilty
of being a security risk,..

218
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:58,213
..without his Constitutional rights....
- You have not seen the evidence..

219
00:15:58,296 --> 00:16:00,632
..and are claiming
he's not a security risk.

220
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:04,844
Wouldn't you guess that those who have
seen the contents of that envelope..

221
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:08,973
..might have a better idea of what
makes someone a danger to his country?

222
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:12,394
- Who? Who? - Or do you think
it should just be you that decides?

223
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:15,063
Who are the people?
Are they elected? Are they appointed?

224
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,816
Do they have an axe to grind?
Is it you, sir?

225
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:22,320
Or you, Colonel Jenkins? Do you know
the contents of that sealed envelope?

226
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:28,868
We have been a friend and ally of both
Mr. Murrow and CBS News for many years.

227
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:32,747
The story you are going
to run tomorrow is without merit.

228
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:36,376
So before you take any steps
that cannot be undone,..

229
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:39,421
..I strongly urge you
to reconsider your stand.

230
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:43,550
These are very dangerous waters
you are attempting to navigate.

231
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:55,520
We have had no hearing at all.
We have had no day in court.

232
00:16:55,937 --> 00:17:00,066
In all the 32 years that I have been
a practicing attorney in Detroit,..

233
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:04,821
..I have never witnessed such a farce
and travesty upon justice..

234
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:06,906
..as this thing has developed.

235
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,993
- Now this whole theory....
- Eddie, just take the first reel.

236
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,037
Tell John I left
5 seconds extra leader.

237
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,498
5 seconds! I got it! Palmer,
where's Joe? Have you seen Joe?

238
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:16,875
He's on his way
to the control room.

239
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,626
We're gonna have to do
the voice-over live.

240
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,503
Natalie, I need a booth
with a live mic.

241
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:21,838
Booth is there, it's already set.

242
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:24,132
We didn't have time
to sync the voice-over out.

243
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:26,051
That's not what I asked for.

244
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,679
It's missing the voice-over
on the last piece.

245
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:31,890
There's a commercial in the booth.
What shall I do?

246
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:34,726
- 2 minutes to air! - There's not
supposed to be a commercial!

247
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:36,102
Get him out of the booth!

248
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:41,858
2-and-a-half minutes
on the end piece.

249
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:45,737
Keep it down, please.
It's a little loud.

250
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:47,155
2 minutes to air, fellas.

251
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:51,910
- He's gonna add a joke.
- Charlie, loan me your lighter.

252
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:57,123
Make sure you know that I swap
with those two pieces of parents.

253
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:00,210
- As long as he talks fast because....
- He will talkfast.

254
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,508
We got the film.

255
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:08,968
Will it be ready?

256
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:10,512
You bet.

257
00:18:16,476 --> 00:18:17,727
Funny thing, Freddy!

258
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:21,481
Every time you light a cigarette
for me, I know you're lying.

259
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,999
It occursto me
we might not get away with this one.

260
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,425
Alcoa, the aluminum company
of America....

261
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:50,677
- 1 0 seconds.
- You fellas, ready? Okay.

262
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:52,220
Ready on camera 1.

263
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:03,481
5, 4, 3, 2.

264
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,610
Pan, camera 1.

265
00:19:09,154 --> 00:19:10,155
Good evening.

266
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:14,284
A few weeks ago there occurred a few
obscure notices in the newspapers..

267
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,161
..about Milo Radulovich,..

268
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,747
..a lieutenant
in the Air Force Reserves.

269
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,751
And, also, something aboutAir Force
regulation 35-62,..

270
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:27,213
..which states that a man
may be regarded as a security risk..

271
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:30,550
..if he has close and continuing
association with Communists..

272
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:33,345
..or people believed
to have Communist sympathies.

273
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:37,807
Lieutenant Radulovich was asked
to resign in August. He declined.

274
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:40,268
A board was called
and heard his case.

275
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:43,980
At the end it was recommended that
he be severed from the Air Force,..

276
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:47,484
..although it was also stated
that there was no question whatever..

277
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,402
..as to the Lieutenant's loyalty.

278
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,946
We propose to examine,
in so far as we can,..

279
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,157
..the case of Lieutenant Radulovich.

280
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:57,160
Our reporter, Joe Wershba,
cameraman, Charlie Mack.

281
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:01,081
This is the town of Dexter, Michigan.
Population 1 500.

282
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:04,793
This statue is at the end
of Ann Arbor Street erected by....

283
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,836
What did the General
tell you yesterday?

284
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:10,256
- A Colonel. There were two of them.
- That makes a General.

285
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:11,758
They weren't too pleased.

286
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,594
You're gonna get audited this year.

287
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:18,139
Not me, you. I told them
I didn't want to do the story.

288
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:22,060
- You always were yellow.
- Better than red.

289
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:30,318
In 10 seconds.

290
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:37,409
This is the sister,
Margaret Radulovich Fishman.

291
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:40,954
She neither defends nor explains
her political activities.

292
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:45,959
I feel that my activities,
be what they may,..

293
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:49,004
..or my political beliefs
are my own private affair.

294
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:54,676
Are my children going to be asked
to denounce me?

295
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:58,888
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

296
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:04,269
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc..

297
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:06,438
..why their father
is a security risk?

298
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:12,277
I see, absolutely,
that this is a chain reaction.

299
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:16,948
If the thing is let stand as it,
the first recommendation,..

300
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:21,328
..was sent out by the board
I see a chain reaction..

301
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:24,873
..that has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

302
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:28,835
Perhaps you will permit me
to read a few sentences..

303
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:32,047
..because I would like to say
rather precisely what I mean.

304
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:35,216
We have told the Air Force
that we will provide facilities..

305
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,386
..for any comments, criticisms,
or corrections it may wish to make..

306
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,472
..as to the case of Milo Radulovich.

307
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:45,268
We are unable to judge the charges
against his father or sister..

308
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:48,688
..because neither we, nor you,
nor they, nor the lawyers,..

309
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:52,817
..northe Lieutenant, knowwhatwas
contained in that manila envelope.

310
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:56,696
Was it hearsay,
rumor, gossip, slander,..

311
00:21:56,946 --> 00:22:00,992
..or hard ascertainable facts that
could be backed by credible witnesses?

312
00:22:01,326 --> 00:22:02,535
We do not know.

313
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,665
We believe the son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father.

314
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,293
Even though that iniquity be proved
and in this case it was not.

315
00:22:11,336 --> 00:22:14,631
But we believe too that this case
illustrates the urgent need..

316
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:18,635
..for the Armed Forces to communicate
more fully than they have so far done..

317
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:21,179
..the procedures and regulations
to be followed..

318
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:23,682
..in attempting to protect
the national security..

319
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:26,518
..and the rights of the individual
at the same time.

320
00:22:27,602 --> 00:22:30,313
Whatever happens in this area
of the relationship..

321
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:32,524
..between the individual
and the state,..

322
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:34,192
..we will do it ourselves,..

323
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:39,197
..it cannot be blamed on Malenkov
or Mao Tse-Tung or even our allies.

324
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:43,284
And, it seems to us,
Fred Friendly and myself,..

325
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:47,288
..that this is a subject
that should be argued about endlessly.

326
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:50,750
Good night, and good luck.

327
00:22:57,632 --> 00:22:58,800
And we're out.

328
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:35,105
May I tell you something
about yourself..

329
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:36,815
May I tell you something
about yourself..

330
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:39,317
..as a member
of the "Person to Person" audience?

331
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:41,486
Based on audience
research studies,..

332
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:45,615
..you are well above average
in education and intelligence.

333
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:49,369
Your interests are wide,
from world affairs and science..

334
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:51,371
..to sports and show business.

335
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:54,916
And you have one characteristic
that's rather encouraging to me..

336
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,920
..and that's the fact that you are
not easily persuaded by advertising.

337
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:02,507
The makers of Kent considered
all these characteristics..

338
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,759
..when they chose
Mr. Murrow's program..

339
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:06,386
..to tell you about Kent.

340
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:11,725
Of all leading filter cigarettes,
Kent filters best.

341
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:15,103
If you try Kent with that in mind,
I think you'll agree..

342
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:18,398
..with many other thinking people
who have changed to Kent.

343
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:23,653
They find that it makes good sense
to smoke Kent and good smoking, too.

344
00:25:24,612 --> 00:25:27,907
- Did you get the changes?
- Edward Murrow, "Person to Person",..

345
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:31,828
..on the CBS Television Network.
- No, no. You there? Okay. We got it.

346
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:33,496
Now backto Ed Murrow.

347
00:25:34,748 --> 00:25:37,667
Not since the silent movies
and the idols they produced..

348
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:41,504
..has Hollywood witnessed the sort
of pilgrimage that is now going on.

349
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:45,675
Each day, oblivious to time,
weather, and the state of the world,..

350
00:25:45,842 --> 00:25:49,679
..sightseers head in the direction
of California's San Fernando Valley.

351
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:53,391
For there, at the end
of the tourist line, is Sherman Oaks..

352
00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:56,811
..and the home Liberace
has built for himself and his mother.

353
00:25:56,978 --> 00:26:00,857
This is the front and nobody knows
how many people have seen that view.

354
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:04,736
This is the back of the house
and that's Liberace's bedroom.

355
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:07,906
- Good evening, Lee.
- Good evening, Ed.

356
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:12,744
- What are you doing? - I'm dictating
my weekly syndicated newspaper column..

357
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:19,751
..and on my trusty tape recorder here,
I'm also dictating a book.

358
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:22,212
- It's an inspirational book.
- Lee, what about you?

359
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:25,298
Have you given much thought
to getting married and settling down?

360
00:26:25,382 --> 00:26:28,009
Actually, I've given
a lot of thought to it,..

361
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:32,013
..but I don't believe in getting married
just for the sake of getting married.

362
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:34,808
I want to some day
find the perfect mate..

363
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:39,270
..and settle down to what I hope will
be a marriage that will be blessed..

364
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:42,023
..by faith
and will be a lasting union.

365
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:47,278
I was reading
about lovely young Princess Margaret..

366
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:50,490
..and she's looking
for her dream man, too,..

367
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:53,076
..and I hope she finds him some day.

368
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:58,206
Uh-huh. Lee, thanks very much
for letting us come and visit you.

369
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,457
It's been very pleasant.

370
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:01,710
And will you say good night
to your family for us?

371
00:27:01,793 --> 00:27:03,503
- I certainly will.
- Thanks a lot.

372
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:05,422
- Good night, Ed.
- Good night, Lee.

373
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:09,634
Next week, we'll take you
to Beverly Hills, California,..

374
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:12,387
..to the house of Mickey Rooney
and his new bride.

375
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,140
Until then,
good night, and good luck.

376
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:22,981
Good show, Mr. Murrow!

377
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:47,422
Excuse me, Mr. Murrow.

378
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:50,216
Could you take a look at this
and sign it for me, please?

379
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,428
Thank you. Dr. Stanton
would like to have a drink with you.

380
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:55,555
- When?
- Now. He's at the Pentagon Bar.

381
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:57,849
I can't. What the hell
is he doing there?

382
00:27:57,932 --> 00:28:00,810
- I believe he's waiting for you.
- Just call him! - Fine.

383
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:03,563
- Oppenheimer next week.
- It's a good show, Ed.

384
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:06,733
- Hey, Don!
- Ed!

385
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:09,194
You're getting good at this!

386
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:11,529
They're gonna think you like it!

387
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:13,990
Pays the bills. How are you, Don?

388
00:28:15,283 --> 00:28:16,326
Ah, it's..

389
00:28:17,786 --> 00:28:18,995
..day to day.

390
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:22,666
If she saw how good you look
right now, she'd be back.

391
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:26,628
You tell her that
if you see her, will you?

392
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:31,341
- I read the O'Brian piece.
- Yeah, it's tough.

393
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:34,761
I'm a pinko.
I slant the news.

394
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:38,682
I'm just waiting for him
to say my wife left me too.

395
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:41,893
- Nobody worth their salt reads him.
- You read him.

396
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:44,104
Well, see, I rest my case.

397
00:28:45,814 --> 00:28:50,068
- Does Paley read him?
- Bill Paley's not gonna do anything.

398
00:28:53,238 --> 00:28:54,364
Thanks, Ed.

399
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:58,994
I just came by to tell you
how great the Lieutenant piece was.

400
00:28:59,077 --> 00:29:02,288
- Thanks. - How's the fallout?
- Mostly good, surprisingly.

401
00:29:02,497 --> 00:29:05,291
Is this the start?
Are you taking sides?

402
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:10,922
It's just a little poke
with a stick, see what happens.

403
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:12,882
You let me know if I can help.

404
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:14,551
But you're a pinko.

405
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:18,555
I'll see you.

406
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:37,198
Hey, Joe! What's all this
Radulovich junkyou're putting out?

407
00:29:37,282 --> 00:29:40,201
I can't talkto you now. I have
to get this film back to NewYork.

408
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:41,619
What would you say if I told you..

409
00:29:41,703 --> 00:29:44,289
..that Murrow was
on the Soviet payroll in 1935?

410
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:49,544
- Uh! Charlie, you wanna....
- Sure. I'll set up outside.

411
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:53,298
McCarthy going
to the Eisenhower dinner?

412
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:56,968
- I have no idea. I don't keep the
Senator's calendar for him! - Really?

413
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:04,809
Have you ever seen any spy films?
You don't hand me a classified folder!

414
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:07,020
You're supposed to slip it
into my briefcase!

415
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:10,273
I didn't know who to give
this information to, Paley or Murrow.

416
00:30:10,357 --> 00:30:13,943
As you can imagine, Fred and I
aren't very friendly. No pun intended.

417
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,820
No pun elocuted.

418
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:21,284
- What do you got, Donald?
- In short?

419
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:24,287
Murrow's been a Communist
sympathizer since the 1930's.

420
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:27,916
Member of the International Workers,
sponsored educational trips to Moscow,..

421
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:30,543
..and on the Soviet payroll
in 1 935. It's all there.

422
00:30:30,627 --> 00:30:32,504
You wanna know
why that's not possible?

423
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:34,089
Why you'll lose this one?

424
00:30:34,547 --> 00:30:36,549
Because everyone in this country..

425
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:39,761
..knows that Ed Murrow
is a loyal American, he's a patriot.

426
00:30:41,721 --> 00:30:44,474
Did you know the word "gullible"
isn't in the dictionary?

427
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:47,560
- Can I give this to him?
- I'd love it! I have copies!

428
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:52,190
I think you guys go too far.

429
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:54,901
Well, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck.

430
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:03,076
Yes, Mr. Paley.

431
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:05,704
Right away.
Yes, sir.

432
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:08,873
No, he hasn't called.

433
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:14,004
Yes, sir, the second he calls.
If you're in a meeting, shall I...?

434
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:17,215
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.

435
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:21,052
Mr. Murrow!

436
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:23,680
Mr. Paley will see you now.

437
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:31,271
- Mr. Paley, Mr. Murrow is here.
- Thanks, Miss Mary.

438
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:34,649
- Hello, Ed. - Bill...
- Sit over here, will you?

439
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:36,568
How's Janet?

440
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:39,404
- Your son?
- All well, thanks. How's Babe?

441
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,699
She's fine. Her fundraiser
got rained on, so....

442
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:45,994
- Oh! That's why I never plan
on anything. - Really?

443
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:48,788
You'd never know.

444
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:53,960
Reading fiction?

445
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:56,463
I hope so. You tell me.

446
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:59,716
Now we know
how they're gonna come at us.

447
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:02,719
That's just the first shot.
Somebody's going to go down.

448
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:05,430
Have you checked your facts?
Are you on safe ground?

449
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:10,602
- Bill, it's time. Show our cards.
- My cards.

450
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:15,357
You lose, what happens?
5 guys find themselves out of work.

451
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:19,986
I'm responsible for a lot more
than 5 goddamn reporters. Let it go.

452
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:23,907
McCarthy will self-destruct,
Cohn, all of them.

453
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,451
You said Corporate
would not interfere with Editorial..

454
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:28,036
..and that the News
was to be left....

455
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,913
We don't make the news,
we report the news.

456
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:32,749
99% of the time he's wrong about those
he's marked as Communists.

457
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:34,876
If he goes too far,
the Senate will investigate him..

458
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:35,960
..and we will report on that.

459
00:32:36,044 --> 00:32:39,339
But he's wrong 1 00% of the time when
he oversteps people's civil liberties.

460
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:40,548
And you're trying him in the press?

461
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:42,634
Does he get the right
to face his accuser?

462
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:45,220
You've decided on this
and you're presenting it as fact.

463
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:47,639
- What I am doing....
- I write your check.

464
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:51,601
I put you in your country house,
and I put your son through school!

465
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:55,605
You should have told me about this
before it went so far down the road!

466
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:10,996
Everyone of your boys needs to be
clean. Do you understand? No ties.

467
00:33:11,204 --> 00:33:15,792
If Aaron's mother went to a group
fundraiser in 1 932, he's out.

468
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:19,713
Hewitt, too. Anyone in that room.
You make no mistake,..

469
00:33:19,838 --> 00:33:23,466
..I will cut them loose. Corporate
won't interfere with Editorial.

470
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,970
But Editorial will not jeopardize
the hundreds of employees..

471
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:30,390
..of the CBS.
Do I make myself clear?

472
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:32,976
Yes?

473
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,818
Fellas, our next show is gonna be
about Senator McCarthy.

474
00:33:42,902 --> 00:33:44,696
And we're gonna go right at him.

475
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:48,116
I don't need to tell you
how careful we have to be.

476
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:51,369
If we are to do this, Ed and I
need you to be straight with us.

477
00:33:51,453 --> 00:33:53,663
We need to know,
for the good of the piece,..

478
00:33:53,747 --> 00:33:57,584
..if any of you have any connection,
if you subscribed to a newsletter,..

479
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,544
..if you attended a party,
anything,..

480
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:02,797
..anything that could compromise this,
anything at all,..

481
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:05,592
..because now would be
the time to tell us.

482
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:13,058
Ed, I think I should excuse myself.

483
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:15,477
Palmer, you kidding?

484
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:18,980
My ex was a....
I wouldn't say she was a Communist,..

485
00:34:19,064 --> 00:34:22,150
..but she attended meetings.
It was before we were married.

486
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:25,195
I didn't even really know about it
until after the divorce.

487
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:28,740
But it was different then.
We were all on the same side.

488
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:33,203
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know. The thing is..

489
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:34,746
..somebody'll find out.

490
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:37,957
They'll hurt us with it.

491
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:41,961
I should have told you sooner, Ed,
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:44,214
Fred.

493
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:50,095
If none of us had ever read
a "dangerous" book,..

494
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:52,472
..or had a friend
who was "different",..

495
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:55,225
..or never joined an organization
that advocated "change",..

496
00:34:55,308 --> 00:34:58,144
..we'd all be the kind of people
Joe McCarthy wants.

497
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:03,733
We're gonna go with the story,
because the terror is in this room.

498
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:10,031
John! Jesse!
Go through the HUAC hearings.

499
00:35:10,115 --> 00:35:14,035
Eddie! Palmer! Look at who
did the interviews and any speeches.

500
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:16,663
Okay, fellas, here we go.

501
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,249
His own words,
that's what we need.

502
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:21,876
....said that he wouldn't remove
a General from theArmy..

503
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,963
..who supported a Communist Major.
I said, "Then, General,.."

504
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:27,382
"..you should be removed
from any command."

505
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:31,678
"Any man who says, 'I will protect
and honor a General'.."

506
00:35:31,928 --> 00:35:36,266
"..'who protects Communists', is not
fit to wear that uniform, General."

507
00:35:36,558 --> 00:35:38,184
Ethically, we're fine.

508
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:42,105
But legally, if we air this, are we
leaking closed hearing testimony?

509
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:44,607
- But he chose to read it.
- We're not misquoting him.

510
00:35:44,691 --> 00:35:48,111
- There are other reporters.
- If it's a legal issue, it's his.

511
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:49,571
I'll check with Campbell in Legal.

512
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:51,698
And wait till you hear
the bleeding hearts..

513
00:35:52,157 --> 00:35:54,284
..scream and cry about our methods..

514
00:35:55,493 --> 00:35:57,537
..of trying to drag the truth..

515
00:35:59,122 --> 00:36:01,291
..from those who know
or should know..

516
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:05,086
..who covered up
a Fifth Amendment Communist Major.

517
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:07,339
But they say, "Oh,.."

518
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,344
"..it's all right to uncover them,
but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy."

519
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:18,975
Did a Civil Liberties Union provide
you with an attorney at that time?

520
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:21,603
I had many offers of attorneys..

521
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:25,607
..and from the American Civil Liberties
Union, too. - The questions is:

522
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,652
..did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

523
00:36:28,735 --> 00:36:31,321
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

524
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:32,447
The answer is yes.

525
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,033
You know the Civil Liberties Union
has been listed..

526
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:38,328
..as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

527
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:40,789
Mr. Chairman, this was 1932!

528
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:43,541
I know this was in 1932.

529
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,794
Do you know that they since
have been listed..

530
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:48,421
..as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

531
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,757
I do not know
that they have been listed so, sir.

532
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,218
- You don't know?
- I have heard that mentioned....

533
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:54,552
All right, Leo. Turn it off.

534
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:58,431
- I need those three cans of Stevens!
- Has anybody read this book yet?

535
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:00,850
It would be nice
if this guy isn't a Commie.

536
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:03,353
- Did Millie give it to you?
- I wanna read the book.

537
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:05,021
- Nobody else, Joe.
- I hear you, boss.

538
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:07,440
I'll put it on a kinescope,
push through the end.

539
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:08,733
Palmer, cut it at 2:30.

540
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:11,194
I prefer it one on each end,
let it run through.

541
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:13,113
It'd be more powerful.
Cut Kennedy?

542
00:37:13,196 --> 00:37:16,032
Joe, file it for me.
I'll see the Mundt piece later.

543
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:17,659
Are we gonna make it, Fred?

544
00:37:17,993 --> 00:37:20,161
We lost the telecine,
but we'll make it.

545
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:25,500
Did you finish your closing piece?

546
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:27,460
It's Shakespeare.

547
00:37:29,337 --> 00:37:30,672
Write your closing.

548
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:02,495
My argument was if you just show
the images of McCarthy..

549
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,122
..it doesn't make any difference.

550
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:06,499
If you agree with him,
you're gonna hate the piece.

551
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,625
If you don't, you'll love it.

552
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:09,711
Maybe they should wait
till they get more footage.

553
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:11,296
I don't think
we can take that chance.

554
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:14,007
We've got to hit McCarthy
before he comes after Ed.

555
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:19,137
The blue one. They haven't gone
after the Alsops or Herb Block.

556
00:38:19,346 --> 00:38:22,140
Honey, the Alsops and Herb Block..

557
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:26,478
..didn't work for the Institute
of International Education in 1 934.

558
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,646
Then I guess it's time.

559
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:36,946
You worried?

560
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:41,117
I didn't think I was.

561
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:44,412
I don't know why.
I was in the office on Friday.

562
00:38:44,746 --> 00:38:47,791
And I answered the phone,
it was Howard calling from London.

563
00:38:47,874 --> 00:38:50,335
And he asked what was going on
with McCarthy.

564
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:55,757
And before I answered him, I turned
and looked over my shoulder..

565
00:38:56,091 --> 00:38:58,968
..to see who was listening.
- And who was listening?

566
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:02,013
Chairman Mao...

567
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:09,771
I'll see you at the office.

568
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,357
- Hey, your ring!
- Uh!

569
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:17,112
Name me another wife..

570
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,323
..who reminds her husband
to take off his wedding ring..

571
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:23,618
..before he goes to the office.
- Ava Gardner.

572
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:34,713
Excuse me, Mr. Friendly. Mr. Murrow,
Mr. Paley's on the line for you.

573
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:40,427
- Maybe he wants to reimburse us
for those ads. - You'd like that!

574
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,637
- I would like that!
- This is Ed.

575
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:46,349
There's a Knickerbocker game tonight.
I've got front row seats.

576
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:47,851
Are you interested?

577
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:51,646
I'm busy bringing down
the network tonight, Bill.

578
00:39:51,938 --> 00:39:52,939
Is that tonight?

579
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:55,942
We're covered, Bill.

580
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,944
All right.

581
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:04,576
- I'm with you today, Ed, and I'm
with you tomorrow. - Thanks, Bill.

582
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:22,635
Do you know the timing
on the first piece?

583
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:26,097
Can we hold all the calls, please?

584
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:28,558
Hold the calls till after the show.
Thank you.

585
00:40:28,975 --> 00:40:31,102
- You fellas, awake down there?
- Okay.

586
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:34,230
- Just... what are we? 20?
- 30 seconds, Ed.

587
00:40:50,121 --> 00:40:51,414
1 0 seconds.

588
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:00,298
5, 4, 3, 2.

589
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:03,134
And pan, camera one.

590
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:10,266
Because a report on Senator McCarthy
is by definition controversial,..

591
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:13,019
..we want to say exactly
what we mean to say..

592
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,855
..and request your permission
to read from a script..

593
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:18,483
..whatever remarks Murrow
and Friendly may make.

594
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:22,821
If the Senator feels that we have done
violence to his words or pictures..

595
00:41:22,904 --> 00:41:25,156
..and desires to answer himself,..

596
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:28,201
..an opportunity will be afforded him
on this program.

597
00:41:28,618 --> 00:41:31,204
Our working thesis tonight
is this quotation:

598
00:41:31,913 --> 00:41:33,581
.."If this fight
against Communism.."

599
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:37,002
"..has made a fight between
America's two great political parties,.."

600
00:41:37,085 --> 00:41:40,588
"..theAmerican people know that one
of these parties will be destroyed.."

601
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:44,134
"..and the Republic cannot endure
very long as a one-party system."

602
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:46,177
We applaud that statement..

603
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:48,513
..and we think
Senator McCarthy ought to.

604
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:51,057
He said it
17 months ago in Milwaukee.

605
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,478
TheAmerican people realize
that this cannot be made a fight..

606
00:41:55,603 --> 00:41:58,231
..between America's
two great political parties.

607
00:41:58,314 --> 00:41:59,941
If this fight against Communism..

608
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:03,236
..is made a fight againstAmerica's
two great political parties,..

609
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,948
..theAmerican people know that one
of those parties will be destroyed..

610
00:42:07,032 --> 00:42:10,452
..and the Republic can't endure
very long as a one-party system.

611
00:42:11,286 --> 00:42:13,913
On one thing the Senator
has been consistent.

612
00:42:14,456 --> 00:42:17,792
Often operating as a one-man
committee, he has traveled far,..

613
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:20,086
..interviewed many,
terrorized some,..

614
00:42:20,587 --> 00:42:22,630
..accused civilian
and military leaders..

615
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:25,175
..of the past administration
of a great conspiracy..

616
00:42:25,258 --> 00:42:27,260
..to turn over the country
to Communism.

617
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:31,765
I was extremely shocked when I heard
that Secretary Stevens..

618
00:42:32,265 --> 00:42:36,603
..told 2Army officers that they had
to take part in the cover up..

619
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:39,689
..of those who promoted
and coddled Communists.

620
00:42:39,898 --> 00:42:42,817
As I read his statement, I..

621
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:46,780
..thought of that quotation,
"On what meat.."

622
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,699
"..doth this our Caesar feed?".

623
00:42:49,824 --> 00:42:50,825
The questions is:

624
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:53,953
..did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

625
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:56,623
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

626
00:42:56,706 --> 00:42:57,707
The answer is yes.

627
00:42:57,791 --> 00:43:00,543
Do you think this book
did considerable harm?

628
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:02,170
Its publication,..

629
00:43:03,254 --> 00:43:05,965
..by an expression of the views
contained in it?

630
00:43:06,257 --> 00:43:09,594
The sale of that book
was so abysmally small,..

631
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:14,474
..it was so unsuccessful,
that the question of its influence....

632
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:16,726
You can go back
to the publisher,..

633
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,480
..you'll see it was one of the most
unsuccessful books he ever put out.

634
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:22,732
He's still sorry about it,
just as I am.

635
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:26,236
Well, I thinkthat's a compliment
toAmerican intelligence.

636
00:43:27,112 --> 00:43:28,238
I'll say that.

637
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:32,617
The Reed Harris hearing demonstrates
one of the Senator's techniques.

638
00:43:32,701 --> 00:43:33,952
Twice he said,..

639
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:38,081
.."The American Civil Liberties Union
was listed as a subversive front."

640
00:43:38,164 --> 00:43:41,167
The Attorney General's list does not
and never has listed..

641
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:44,087
..theACLU as subversive,
nor does the FBI,..

642
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,423
..or any other
federal government agency.

643
00:43:46,756 --> 00:43:49,884
And the American Civil Liberties Union
holds in its files..

644
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:52,595
..letters of commendation
from President Truman,..

645
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,306
..President Eisenhower,
and General MacArthur.

646
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:00,812
Earlier, the Senator asked, "Upon what
meat does this our Caesar feed?".

647
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:03,815
Had he looked three lines earlier
in Shakespeare's "Caesar"..

648
00:44:03,898 --> 00:44:07,485
..he would have found this line,
which is not altogether inappropriate.

649
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:11,865
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

650
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:14,826
No one familiar with the history
of this country..

651
00:44:14,909 --> 00:44:17,620
..can deny that Congressional
committees are useful.

652
00:44:17,704 --> 00:44:20,582
It is necessary to investigate
before legislating,..

653
00:44:20,665 --> 00:44:24,252
..but the line between investigating
and persecuting is a very fine one..

654
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:28,214
..and the junior Senator from Wisconsin
has stepped over it repeatedly.

655
00:44:28,381 --> 00:44:30,967
We must not confuse dissent
with disloyalty.

656
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:34,637
We must remember always
that accusation is not proof..

657
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:38,683
..and that conviction depends
upon evidence and due process of law.

658
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:41,936
We will not walk in fear,
one of another.

659
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,898
We will not be driven by fear
into an age of unreason..

660
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:47,651
..if we dig deep
in our history and doctrine,..

661
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:51,154
..and remember that we are not
descended from fearful men,..

662
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,866
..not from men who feared to write,
to associate, to speak,..

663
00:44:54,949 --> 00:44:58,370
..and to defend the causes
that were for the moment unpopular.

664
00:44:58,953 --> 00:45:02,332
This is no time for men who oppose
Senator McCarthy's methods..

665
00:45:02,415 --> 00:45:05,001
..to keep silent,
or for those who approve.

666
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,254
We can deny our heritage
and our history,..

667
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:11,132
..but we cannot escape
responsibility for the results.

668
00:45:11,716 --> 00:45:14,010
We proclaim ourselves,
indeed as we are,..

669
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:18,056
..the defenders of freedom wherever
it continues to exist in the world,..

670
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:21,643
..but we cannot defend freedom abroad
by deserting it at home.

671
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:24,604
The actions of the junior Senator
from Wisconsin..

672
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,691
..have caused alarm and dismay
amongst our allies abroad..

673
00:45:27,774 --> 00:45:30,318
..and given considerable comfort
to our enemies.

674
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:33,863
And whose fault is that?
Not really his.

675
00:45:34,322 --> 00:45:36,658
He didn't create
this situation of fear,..

676
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:39,911
..he merely exploited it,
and rather successfully.

677
00:45:41,454 --> 00:45:42,789
Cassius was right.

678
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:47,711
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

679
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,797
Good night, and good luck.

680
00:45:58,513 --> 00:45:59,639
And we're out.

681
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:14,321
Nothing?

682
00:46:17,532 --> 00:46:19,034
Maybe nobody watched.

683
00:46:24,122 --> 00:46:26,499
- We got nothing.
- I don't know. - Nothing.

684
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,586
Should I turn the phones back on,
Mr. Williams?

685
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:33,465
Yes. Now would be
a good time for that.

686
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:36,384
Turn the phones on!
Turn the pho --

687
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:38,762
Mr. Friendly wants the phones on.

688
00:46:38,845 --> 00:46:40,597
It's the Junior Senator
calling collect.

689
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,933
Don't kid yourself. It's Reed Harris
thanking us for mentioning him.

690
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:47,020
I don't know whether all of you
have seen what I just saw,..

691
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:49,814
..but I want to associate myself
and this program..

692
00:46:49,898 --> 00:46:51,524
..with what Ed Murrow
has just said,..

693
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,361
..and say I have never been
prouder of CBS.

694
00:46:57,238 --> 00:47:01,326
Senator McCarthy said today that he
would demand equal free television....

695
00:47:06,122 --> 00:47:10,043
Stevenson had charged that the Senator
made demagoguery and deceit..

696
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:12,087
..the national policy....

697
00:47:14,756 --> 00:47:16,925
- Is that Hollenbeck?.
- Congratulations!

698
00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:18,051
Great show!

699
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:20,178
Feel like a Scotch?

700
00:47:20,762 --> 00:47:22,847
I think everybody
could use a Scotch.

701
00:48:14,177 --> 00:48:17,389
- It's 3:30, early editions are out.
- I'm not worried about that.

702
00:48:17,472 --> 00:48:19,140
Of course not.
Shirley, honey,..

703
00:48:19,224 --> 00:48:22,185
..would you go across the street
and get the early editions?

704
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:24,229
- All of them?
- Just get O'Brian!

705
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:28,775
- Hey, watch my drink!
- Yeah.

706
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:02,976
Okay. Here we go.

707
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,479
- At last!
- The Times. - The Times...

708
00:49:06,604 --> 00:49:07,647
- First?
- Good.

709
00:49:08,315 --> 00:49:10,150
- Who wrote it?
- Jack Gould.

710
00:49:10,692 --> 00:49:12,027
Gould...

711
00:49:12,527 --> 00:49:16,031
Edward R. Murrow's television program
on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy..

712
00:49:16,114 --> 00:49:19,951
..was an exciting and provocative
examination of the man and his methods.

713
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:23,580
It was crusading journalism
of high responsibility and courage.

714
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:26,416
For TV so often plagued
by timidity and hesitation,..

715
00:49:26,499 --> 00:49:30,295
..the program was a milestone
that reflected enlightened citizenship.

716
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,671
The program.... Hold on!

717
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:34,549
The program was no less
an indictment of those who wish..

718
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:37,719
..the problems posed
by the Senator's tactics and theatrics..

719
00:49:37,802 --> 00:49:39,804
..would just go away
and leave them alone.

720
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:42,849
That was Mr. Murrow's
and television's triumph,..

721
00:49:42,932 --> 00:49:44,476
..and a very great one.

722
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:48,980
Here! Here!

723
00:49:49,147 --> 00:49:51,274
- He hated it.
- Yeah. What's his beef?

724
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,777
Send the NewYorkTimes
a bottle of Scotch.

725
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,904
I already did. How do you think
we got that review?

726
00:49:55,987 --> 00:49:57,947
- How'sthe Post?
- Pretty good!

727
00:49:58,657 --> 00:50:00,659
- What about O'Brian?
- Uh, the same.

728
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,205
- Go on, read O'Brian!
- I don't have it.

729
00:50:05,288 --> 00:50:06,748
- Got it.
- Oh. Here.

730
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,877
- There we go.
- Shirley, that....

731
00:50:14,506 --> 00:50:18,093
We can't saywe were surprised at
Murrow's "Hate McCarthy" telecast..

732
00:50:18,176 --> 00:50:21,137
..last evening, when his explosively
one-sided propaganda,..

733
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:24,557
..edited with deviously clever
selectivity from McCarthy's march..

734
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:27,060
..against Communism,
was finished last evening..

735
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:30,563
..by equally Machiavellian coincidence
the following telecast..

736
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:33,650
..featured Murrow's PM protg,
Hollenbeck.

737
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,778
In an obviously gloating mood,
Hollenbeck..

738
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:40,323
..hoped viewers had witnessed
his patron's triumph..

739
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:41,741
..from and for the Left.

740
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,119
So on. So on...

741
00:50:44,202 --> 00:50:46,329
Shirley, it's okay.
Go ahead, finish it.

742
00:50:46,413 --> 00:50:49,582
- No, that's it. That's it.
- Shirley, please, finish it.

743
00:50:52,752 --> 00:50:57,424
The CBS has been in a lengthy
"clean house of Lefties" mood.

744
00:50:57,507 --> 00:50:59,217
The worst offenders
on lesser levels..

745
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:01,511
..have been quietly
pushed out of the company.

746
00:51:01,594 --> 00:51:05,557
Don Hollenbeck, a graduate
of the demised pinko publication PM,..

747
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,436
..attacked conservative papers
with sly and slanted propaganda.

748
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:11,855
He then proceeded
through an equally..

749
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,483
..tilted review of the day's events..

750
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:18,945
..with McCarthy dominating his words,
actions, attitudes.

751
00:51:19,904 --> 00:51:20,905
So on.

752
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,619
- It's O'Brian. - He didn't get
the Scotch, that's all.

753
00:51:27,078 --> 00:51:30,123
- Is it grammatically correct?
- I'll have that cigarette, Ed.

754
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:34,711
- Thanks, Shirley.
- Oh. - Mmh. - Thankyou.

755
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:37,172
Joe... Shirley...

756
00:51:42,093 --> 00:51:43,386
It doesn't matter.

757
00:51:48,642 --> 00:51:49,768
To Jack Gould!

758
00:51:50,894 --> 00:51:53,772
- To Jack! To Jack! To Jack Gould!
- To Jack Gould!

759
00:51:53,855 --> 00:51:54,856
I love Jack Gould!

760
00:51:56,816 --> 00:51:58,360
May he rest in peace.

761
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,406
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Fred, congratulations! - Thankyou.

762
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:06,576
I got such a hangover
to go along with the ulcer.

763
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,536
All the ad guys on the 3rd floor
watched the show.

764
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,622
Got a good review
in the NewYork Times. Jack Gould.

765
00:52:10,705 --> 00:52:12,082
We're putting out a press release..

766
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:15,043
..saying that calls came in
15 to 1 in favor of the show. - Really?

767
00:52:15,126 --> 00:52:17,504
- Yeah. - 15 to 1?
- We got calls from everywhere.

768
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:21,132
- East Coast or West Coast?
- Yeah. Kansas City, Cincinnati....

769
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,259
Mr. Paley...

770
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,513
- Morning, Fred.
- Morning, Mr. Paley.

771
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:32,644
How's your wife?

772
00:52:33,103 --> 00:52:35,271
She's fine.
We're getting ready to move.

773
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:38,441
- Really? Where to? - Riverdale.
We found a nice house there.

774
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:39,526
It's nice there.

775
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,444
Yes, sir.

776
00:52:48,493 --> 00:52:49,494
Excuse me.

777
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:53,540
Fred! McCarthy wants William Buckley
to do his rebuttal.

778
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:55,875
I said no.

779
00:52:57,669 --> 00:52:58,712
Yes, sir.

780
00:53:05,093 --> 00:53:06,094
Hey, Johnny!

781
00:53:06,344 --> 00:53:08,596
- Radulovich has been reinstated.
- What?!

782
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,433
Radulovich.... Guys!
Radulovich has been reinstated.

783
00:53:11,516 --> 00:53:13,393
- Jesse! Jesse!
- Where is Ed?

784
00:53:13,476 --> 00:53:16,021
- He's in the bullpen. Why?
What's going on? - Jess!

785
00:53:16,104 --> 00:53:17,605
Got some very good news.

786
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:21,318
Special announcement
from the Secretary of the Air Force!

787
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:23,445
Fellas! Listen up! Everyone!

788
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:26,448
I have decided
that it is consistent..

789
00:53:26,531 --> 00:53:29,284
..with the interests
of the National Security to retain..

790
00:53:29,367 --> 00:53:32,662
..Lieutenant Radulovich
in the United StatesAir Force. Stop.

791
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:36,166
He is not, in my opinion,
a security risk. Full stop.

792
00:53:38,793 --> 00:53:42,422
There you go. Harold E. Talbott,
Secretary from theAir Force.

793
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,090
Great job!

794
00:53:44,174 --> 00:53:46,092
- Make a copy of that for me!
- I will do, Fred!

795
00:53:46,176 --> 00:53:48,136
Back to work, guys!
We got a lot of work to do.

796
00:53:48,219 --> 00:53:49,471
This means something.

797
00:53:49,554 --> 00:53:51,139
- Good news, huh?
- Congratulations!

798
00:53:51,222 --> 00:53:55,268
- This absolutely means something.
- Absolutely. This is the start of....

799
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:03,276
Palmer!

800
00:54:06,363 --> 00:54:08,406
The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you.

801
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:13,036
When?

802
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,746
Tomorrow.

803
00:54:15,664 --> 00:54:19,042
I don't want you to get paranoid,
they're talking to everybody.

804
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:20,168
Any ideas?

805
00:54:21,753 --> 00:54:23,380
Just tell them what you know.

806
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:26,174
- Now is that testimony true?
- No, sir, it is not.

807
00:54:26,257 --> 00:54:29,469
Not at any time have I been
a member of the Communist Party..

808
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:31,888
..and I have never seen
a Communist card.

809
00:54:31,972 --> 00:54:34,307
- You've never seen a Communist card?
- That's right.

810
00:54:34,391 --> 00:54:36,351
Have you ever attended
any Communist meetings?

811
00:54:36,434 --> 00:54:38,061
No, sir, never.

812
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:40,397
Have you ever subscribed
to The Daily Worker?

813
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,275
No, sir. I didn't subscribe to it
and I wouldn't pay for it.

814
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:50,281
Uh... Now, Mrs. Markward,
who was working for the FBI,..

815
00:54:50,991 --> 00:54:54,327
..who joined the Communist Party
under orders from the FBI,..

816
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:57,622
..has testified that while
she never met you personally..

817
00:54:57,831 --> 00:55:01,042
..at a Communist meeting
that your name was on the list..

818
00:55:01,126 --> 00:55:03,294
..of Communists
who were paying dues.

819
00:55:03,795 --> 00:55:06,548
Uh... Can you shed
any light upon that?

820
00:55:07,424 --> 00:55:10,302
No, sir. I don't even know
what the dues are..

821
00:55:10,468 --> 00:55:13,972
..or where they were paid.
- So you have never paid any money..

822
00:55:15,015 --> 00:55:16,850
..to the Communist Party.

823
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,311
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

824
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:21,604
You've never paid
any dues, payment....

825
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:23,356
Thank you very much, Leo!

826
00:55:24,274 --> 00:55:26,109
Good work, Joe, Charlie.

827
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:28,069
Now what is the show?

828
00:55:28,153 --> 00:55:30,905
Is it defending Annie Lee Moss
as not being a Communist?

829
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:33,575
- Or is it her Constitutional rights?
- Both. - The latter.

830
00:55:33,658 --> 00:55:36,119
We're much better sticking out
the Constitutional issues.

831
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:37,912
- Agreed?
- The woman is not a Communist spy.

832
00:55:37,996 --> 00:55:40,623
Joe McCarthy said that they have
a spy in the Pentagon,..

833
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:42,417
..that spy has gotten
into the code room,..

834
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,252
..and that that spy
is Annie Lee Moss.

835
00:55:44,336 --> 00:55:46,838
I've got NewYorkTimes reports.
McCarthy asserts he has..

836
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:49,758
..a new red link toArmy. Quote,
"Senator McCarthy charged today.."

837
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:52,385
"..that the Army now employs
a woman in its code room.."

838
00:55:52,469 --> 00:55:55,055
"..who was, and still may be,
an active Communist."

839
00:55:55,138 --> 00:55:56,640
It's the front page
of the New YorkTimes.

840
00:55:56,723 --> 00:56:00,393
No sooner is he done chastising the
other committee members for wanting..

841
00:56:00,477 --> 00:56:03,438
..to push into the afternoon,
than what? Seven questions in,..

842
00:56:03,521 --> 00:56:05,148
..he ducks out, leaves....
- Right.

843
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:08,234
- He leaves. - It's all over
the headlines, all over the country.

844
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:09,903
Get me copies from any newspaper..

845
00:56:09,986 --> 00:56:11,613
..that printed anything
about that assertion.

846
00:56:11,696 --> 00:56:15,033
That's a good idea. You should get
the Cincinnati Inquirer.

847
00:56:15,116 --> 00:56:18,161
- Chicago. - Couple other pieces
I think we should include.

848
00:56:18,244 --> 00:56:21,373
The fact that there's 3Annie Lee Moss's
in the phone book.

849
00:56:21,456 --> 00:56:24,501
There are 2 Robert Halls,
one's colored, one's white.

850
00:56:24,584 --> 00:56:26,503
We have some footage
of the empty chair.

851
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:29,756
I think that says it all.
Just that picture of McCarthy not....

852
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,676
McCarthy leaving the hearing
after 7 questions..

853
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:34,928
..and then we'll cut
to the shot of the chair.

854
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:37,681
- We gotta do something about it.
- All right, so....

855
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:41,643
Excuse me. Mr. Murrow!
McCarthy wantsApril 6th.

856
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:46,731
Thank you, Natalie.

857
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:54,614
Fine. If Charlie shoots it, we get
to see it first. We should offer.

858
00:56:54,698 --> 00:56:57,283
- It's a long shot.
- What the hell could McCarthy do?

859
00:56:57,367 --> 00:56:59,869
Is he gonna debate himself?
We just used his words!

860
00:57:03,206 --> 00:57:05,417
Johnny! Johnny! We know
what it's going to be.

861
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,503
He's going to come after me.
There's nothing more he can do.

862
00:57:08,586 --> 00:57:11,089
He's gonna bet that
a Senator trumps a newsman.

863
00:57:12,007 --> 00:57:13,049
He'll lose.

864
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,093
Not if we're playing bridge.

865
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:19,681
- I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean
to interrupt. - Hey, Don.

866
00:57:19,764 --> 00:57:21,933
- It's getting fun now!
- Ed, you have a minute?

867
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:26,021
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- All right, boys. Playtime's over.

868
00:57:26,396 --> 00:57:27,772
We have 4 days..

869
00:57:28,023 --> 00:57:30,525
..to do a 28 minute show.
- Yeah. - All right.

870
00:57:30,608 --> 00:57:32,068
All right, go ahead.
Hi, Mary.

871
00:57:32,152 --> 00:57:33,862
Hello, Mr. Hollenbeck.
Mr. Murrow...

872
00:57:33,945 --> 00:57:35,780
- Could you give us a moment?
- Sure.

873
00:57:37,657 --> 00:57:38,742
Thank you, dear.

874
00:57:40,493 --> 00:57:43,204
I have to ask you something, Ed.
It's about O'Brian.

875
00:57:43,288 --> 00:57:45,206
- O'Brian doesn't matter.
- He's killing me, Ed.

876
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,083
He doesn't amount to that much
in the newsroom.

877
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:48,585
We've got to let that guy have it.

878
00:57:48,668 --> 00:57:51,963
We're not going after O'Brian. I will
not take on McCarthy and Hearst.

879
00:57:52,047 --> 00:57:53,340
I can't defeat them both.

880
00:57:54,424 --> 00:57:57,719
Just don't read the papers.
Or don't read O'Brian, anyway.

881
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:05,226
Okay. I guess not.

882
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:07,604
Sorry, Don.

883
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:23,578
Although Mrs. Moss
offered to testify,..

884
00:58:23,662 --> 00:58:26,790
..Senator McCarthy suggested
that she was too sick.

885
00:58:26,873 --> 00:58:30,585
- She agreed.... - Mr. Cohn wanted
to know about Mrs. Moss's connection....

886
00:58:30,669 --> 00:58:34,339
....to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,..

887
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:35,590
..so help you God?

888
00:58:39,386 --> 00:58:42,055
May we get your full name
for the record, please?

889
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,765
Annie Lee Moss.

890
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:46,559
- M-O-S-S?
- That's right.

891
00:58:46,893 --> 00:58:50,146
Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record,
for your information,..

892
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,440
..for the information
of your counsel,..

893
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:54,901
..that you are not here because..

894
00:58:56,236 --> 00:59:01,282
..you are considered important
in the Communist apparatus.

895
00:59:01,408 --> 00:59:04,911
We have the testimony that you are,
and have been, a Communist.

896
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:09,499
We are rather curious, however,
to know how you suddenly..

897
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:12,210
..were shifted from..

898
00:59:14,129 --> 00:59:17,173
..a worker in a cafeteria
to the code room.

899
00:59:17,465 --> 00:59:20,760
I am today much more interested..

900
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:25,223
..in the handling of your case..

901
00:59:25,974 --> 00:59:29,185
..by your superiors
than in your own personal activities.

902
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:33,732
However, counsel will question you
about your own activities also.

903
00:59:34,065 --> 00:59:37,152
- Mr. Chairman!
- We will not hear from counsel.

904
00:59:37,736 --> 00:59:39,738
You have been told what the rule is.

905
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:43,074
If you have anything to say,
say it through your client.

906
00:59:46,745 --> 00:59:50,498
Chairman. Did you begin work
at the General Accounting Office in..

907
00:59:51,374 --> 00:59:53,585
..1 945?
- Yes, sir.

908
00:59:54,461 --> 00:59:58,715
And, prior to that time,
had you been a cafeteria worker?

909
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:00,133
Yes, I had.

910
01:00:00,425 --> 01:00:04,763
I see. While in the Pentagon,
since 1 950,..

911
01:00:05,096 --> 01:00:07,849
..have you had any connections
with coded messages?

912
01:00:07,932 --> 01:00:09,893
Have you ever handled
coded messages?

913
01:00:10,977 --> 01:00:13,521
- No more than to transmit 'em.
- Pardon me?

914
01:00:13,813 --> 01:00:16,024
No more than to transmit
the message.

915
01:00:16,107 --> 01:00:18,485
Than to transmit them?
Did you transmit codes?

916
01:00:18,568 --> 01:00:21,279
To receive or transmit messages
was all I had to do.

917
01:00:21,363 --> 01:00:23,990
And I've never been
into a courtroom in my life.

918
01:00:24,532 --> 01:00:25,825
Do you know the..

919
01:00:27,827 --> 01:00:29,496
..type of classification....

920
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:33,750
- Do you know if they were secret,
top secret, confidential? - No, sir.

921
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,379
- You wouldn't know the degree
of classification? - No, sir.

922
01:00:37,796 --> 01:00:38,838
I see.

923
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:43,218
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to excuse myself, I've got..

924
01:00:44,386 --> 01:00:48,431
..a rather important appointment
to workon right now..

925
01:00:48,515 --> 01:00:52,769
..and I wonder if, Senator Mundt,
you would take over as Chairman?

926
01:00:57,732 --> 01:00:59,275
- Chairman. Uh...
- Cohn.

927
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,404
I have no further questions
of this witness at this time.

928
01:01:02,487 --> 01:01:06,616
We have the testimony of Mrs. Markward,
the undercover agent for the FBI,..

929
01:01:06,908 --> 01:01:10,453
..stating thatAnnie Lee Moss
was a member, a dues-paying member..

930
01:01:10,537 --> 01:01:12,288
..of the Communist Party,..

931
01:01:12,747 --> 01:01:15,041
..the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

932
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:18,461
We have corroboration
of that testimony by another..

933
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:21,715
..witness who was called
before the Committee..

934
01:01:21,798 --> 01:01:23,633
..and gave a sworn statement
to the effect..

935
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:26,386
..that she also knew Mrs. Moss
as a member..

936
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:28,513
..of the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

937
01:01:28,596 --> 01:01:32,851
She's already lost her job. She's been
suspended because of this action.

938
01:01:33,601 --> 01:01:37,147
I'm not defending her. If she's
a Communist, I want her exposed.

939
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,151
But to make these statements
as we've got corroborating evidence..

940
01:01:41,609 --> 01:01:44,779
..that she is a Communist,
under these circumstances,..

941
01:01:44,863 --> 01:01:48,491
..I thinkshe's entitled to have it
produced here in her presence..

942
01:01:48,658 --> 01:01:51,953
..and let the public know about it
and let her know about it.

943
01:01:55,373 --> 01:01:58,668
I don't like to try people
by hearsay evidence.

944
01:02:00,045 --> 01:02:02,797
I'd like to get the witnesses here
and try them..

945
01:02:04,507 --> 01:02:06,217
..by testimony, under oath.

946
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:10,096
The Chair will rule
that the comment of Mr. Cohn..

947
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,806
..be stricken from the record.

948
01:02:12,057 --> 01:02:14,601
I didn't ask that, Mr. Chairman!

949
01:02:14,684 --> 01:02:17,312
....whether we should try to produce
a witness in public..

950
01:02:17,395 --> 01:02:20,607
..because the FBI may have
her undercover and we don't want to....

951
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:25,236
You can't strike these statements
made by counsel here as to evidence..

952
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,532
..that we're having and withholding.
You cannot strike that from the press..

953
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:34,746
..nor from the public mind
once it's planted there. That's the..

954
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:37,999
..evil of it!

955
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:41,503
- Well, I'd look at it....
- I don't think it's fair to a witness,..

956
01:02:41,586 --> 01:02:43,046
..to a citizen of this country,..

957
01:02:43,129 --> 01:02:45,215
..to bring them up here
and cross-examine them,..

958
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:46,716
..then when they get through, say,..

959
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,761
.."The FBI has got something on you
that condemns you."

960
01:02:49,844 --> 01:02:52,555
- The Chair agrees....
- It is not sworn testimony,..

961
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:56,267
..it's convicting people
by rumor and hearsay and innuendo.

962
01:02:57,936 --> 01:03:01,564
You will notice that neither Senator
McClellan or Senator Symington..

963
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:05,986
..nor this reporter know or claim
that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist.

964
01:03:06,611 --> 01:03:11,074
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

965
01:03:11,074 --> 01:03:11,157
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

966
01:03:26,006 --> 01:03:30,093
One month ago tonight we presented
a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.

967
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,304
We labeled it as controversial.

968
01:03:32,846 --> 01:03:36,516
Most of that report consisted
of words and pictures of the Senator.

969
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,643
At that time, we said,..

970
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,731
.."If the Senator believes we have done
violence to his words or pictures,.."

971
01:03:42,814 --> 01:03:45,400
"..if he desires to speak,
to answer himself,.."

972
01:03:45,483 --> 01:03:48,611
"..an opportunity would be
afforded him on this program."

973
01:03:48,903 --> 01:03:52,615
The Senator sought the opportunity
after 3 weeks..

974
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:56,786
..because he was very busy and wished
adequate time to prepare his reply.

975
01:03:57,329 --> 01:03:58,371
We agreed.

976
01:03:58,872 --> 01:04:03,043
We placed no restrictions on the manner
of the presentation of his reply..

977
01:04:03,168 --> 01:04:06,254
..and we suggested that we would not
take time to comment..

978
01:04:06,338 --> 01:04:08,089
..on this particular program.

979
01:04:08,632 --> 01:04:12,594
Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,
junior Senator from Wisconsin.

980
01:04:14,012 --> 01:04:20,352
Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow,
Educational Director of the CBS,..

981
01:04:21,353 --> 01:04:23,688
..devoted his program
to an attack..

982
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:26,983
..on the work of the US Senate
Investigating Committee,..

983
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,611
..and on me personally
as its Chairman.

984
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:34,074
Now, over the past 4 years,
he has made repeated attacks upon me..

985
01:04:34,532 --> 01:04:36,326
..and those fighting Communists.

986
01:04:37,744 --> 01:04:40,955
Of course, neither Joe McCarthy
nor Edward R. Murrow..

987
01:04:41,623 --> 01:04:44,542
..is of any great importance
as individuals.

988
01:04:45,627 --> 01:04:47,128
We are only important..

989
01:04:47,462 --> 01:04:51,508
..in our relation to the great struggle
to preserve our American liberties.

990
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:56,680
Now ordinarily, I wouldn't take time
out from the important work at hand..

991
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:58,682
..to answer Murrow.

992
01:04:59,182 --> 01:05:00,725
However, in this case,..

993
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:04,604
..I feel justified in doing so
because Murrow is the symbol,..

994
01:05:05,355 --> 01:05:06,439
..the leader..

995
01:05:06,731 --> 01:05:11,861
..and the cleverest of the jackal pack
which is always found at the throat..

996
01:05:12,278 --> 01:05:16,324
..of anyone who dares to expose
individual Communists and traitors.

997
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:19,452
And I am compelled by the fact,..

998
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:22,372
..to say to you
that Mr. Edward R. Murrow,..

999
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:25,500
..as far back as 20 years ago,..

1000
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:29,587
..was engaged in propaganda
for Communist causes.

1001
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:33,842
For example, the Institute
of International Education,..

1002
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:36,303
..of which he was
theActing Director,..

1003
01:05:36,886 --> 01:05:39,848
..was chosen to act
as a representative..

1004
01:05:40,223 --> 01:05:41,891
..by a Soviet agency..

1005
01:05:43,018 --> 01:05:48,440
..to do a job which would normally
be done by the Russian secret police.

1006
01:05:49,357 --> 01:05:53,028
Mr. Murrow, by his own admission,
was a member of the IWW,..

1007
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:55,655
..that's the Industrial Workers
of the World,..

1008
01:05:55,739 --> 01:05:58,533
..a terrorist organization
cited as subversive..

1009
01:05:59,117 --> 01:06:01,619
..by an Attorney General
of the United States.

1010
01:06:01,786 --> 01:06:05,123
Mr. Murrow said on this program
and I quote,..

1011
01:06:05,915 --> 01:06:09,628
.."The actions of the junior
Senator from Wisconsin.."

1012
01:06:10,962 --> 01:06:15,008
"..have given considerable comfort
to the enemy."

1013
01:06:15,634 --> 01:06:19,554
That is the language of our statute
of treason, rather strong language.

1014
01:06:20,305 --> 01:06:25,644
If I am giving comfort to our enemies,
I ought not to be in the Senate.

1015
01:06:25,977 --> 01:06:27,896
If, on the other hand,
Mr. Murrow..

1016
01:06:28,355 --> 01:06:30,440
..is giving comfort to our enemies,..

1017
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,151
..he ought not to be brought
into the homes..

1018
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,946
..of millions of Americans
by the CBS.

1019
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:38,531
And I want to assure you..

1020
01:06:39,658 --> 01:06:42,661
..that I will not be deterred..

1021
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:49,250
..by the attacks of the Murrows,
the Lattimores, the Fosters,..

1022
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:54,005
..The Daily Worker
or the Communist Party itself.

1023
01:06:56,174 --> 01:06:59,302
And I make no claim to leadership.

1024
01:07:01,596 --> 01:07:03,181
In complete humility..

1025
01:07:05,016 --> 01:07:09,145
..I do ask you and every American
who loves this country..

1026
01:07:09,854 --> 01:07:11,481
..to join with me.

1027
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:41,636
[Everyone talks about the weather]

1028
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:45,307
[Wherever you look
on America's modern farms,.]

1029
01:07:45,598 --> 01:07:50,061
[..aluminum is on the job, helping the
farmer do something about the weather]

1030
01:07:50,937 --> 01:07:54,190
[Aluminum for the farm
is one more example of how Alcoa,.]

1031
01:07:54,274 --> 01:07:55,650

1032

[..has continued to pioneer
new uses for this vital metal]

1033
01:08:00,405 --> 01:08:04,534
[New uses of aluminum that mean
better farms and better farming]

1034
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,830
[The aluminum from the nation's
first and leading producer,.]

1035
01:08:09,414 --> 01:08:12,876
[..Alcoa,
Aluminum Company of America]

1036
01:08:13,376 --> 01:08:15,879
Last week, Senator McCarthy
appeared on this program..

1037
01:08:15,962 --> 01:08:18,465
..to correct any errors
he might have thought we made..

1038
01:08:18,548 --> 01:08:20,133
..in our report of March 9th.

1039
01:08:20,216 --> 01:08:23,637
Since he made no reference to any
statements of fact that we made,..

1040
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,473
..we must conclude
that he found no errors of fact.

1041
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,893
He proved again
that anyone who exposes him,..

1042
01:08:29,976 --> 01:08:34,606
..anyone who doesn't share his disregard
for decency and human dignity..

1043
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:37,233
..and the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution..

1044
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:40,028
..must be either a Communist
or a fellow traveler.

1045
01:08:40,612 --> 01:08:42,405
I fully expected this treatment.

1046
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,660
The Senator added this reporter's name
to a long list of individuals..

1047
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:50,246
..and institutions he has accused
of serving the Communist cause.

1048
01:08:50,622 --> 01:08:52,374
His proposition is very simple:

1049
01:08:52,707 --> 01:08:56,211
..anyone who criticizes or opposes
Senator McCarthy's methods..

1050
01:08:56,419 --> 01:08:57,837
..must be a Communist.

1051
01:08:58,546 --> 01:09:02,300
And if that be true, there are
an awful lot of Communists in the USA.

1052
01:09:02,968 --> 01:09:06,596
For the record, let's consider briefly
some of the Senator's charges.

1053
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,765
He claimed, but offered no proof,..

1054
01:09:08,848 --> 01:09:12,185
..that I had been a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World.

1055
01:09:12,268 --> 01:09:13,436
That is false.

1056
01:09:14,062 --> 01:09:17,816
I was never a member of the IWW,
never applied for membership.

1057
01:09:18,942 --> 01:09:21,528
The Senator charged
that Professor Harold Laski,..

1058
01:09:21,611 --> 01:09:24,656
..a British scholar and politician,
dedicated a book to me.

1059
01:09:24,739 --> 01:09:25,824
That's true.

1060
01:09:26,116 --> 01:09:29,577
He is dead.
He was a socialist, I am not.

1061
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,330
He was a civilized individual..

1062
01:09:32,414 --> 01:09:35,667
..who did not insist upon agreement
with his political principles..

1063
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:38,586
..as a pre-condition
for conversation or friendship.

1064
01:09:39,004 --> 01:09:41,256
I do not agree
with his political ideas.

1065
01:09:42,173 --> 01:09:44,676
Laski, as he makes clear
in the introduction,..

1066
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:48,221
..dedicated the book to me,
not because of political agreement,..

1067
01:09:48,305 --> 01:09:52,142
..but because he held my wartime
broadcast from London in high regard.

1068
01:09:52,642 --> 01:09:54,352
And the dedication so reads.

1069
01:09:55,937 --> 01:09:58,398
I believed 20 years ago
and I believe today..

1070
01:09:58,857 --> 01:10:02,485
..that mature Americans can engage
in conversation and controversy,..

1071
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:05,822
..the clash of ideas, with Communists
anywhere in the world..

1072
01:10:05,905 --> 01:10:08,450
..without becoming
contaminated or converted.

1073
01:10:09,242 --> 01:10:11,828
I believe that our faith,
our conviction,..

1074
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:14,706
..our determination
are stronger than theirs..

1075
01:10:14,998 --> 01:10:19,419
..and that we can successfully compete,
not only in the area of bombs,..

1076
01:10:19,878 --> 01:10:21,713
..but in the area of ideas.

1077
01:10:23,965 --> 01:10:26,635
I have worked with CBS
for more than 19 years.

1078
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:30,764
The company has subscribed fully
to my integrity and responsibility..

1079
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:33,266
..as a broadcaster
and as a loyal American.

1080
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:37,562
I require no lectures from the junior
Senator from Wisconsin..

1081
01:10:37,646 --> 01:10:40,273
..as to the dangers
or terrors of Communism.

1082
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:43,777
Having searched my conscience
and my files,..

1083
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,905
..I cannot contend that
I have always been right or wise,..

1084
01:10:46,988 --> 01:10:50,116
..but I have attempted to pursue
the truth with diligence..

1085
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,326
..and to report it,..

1086
01:10:51,409 --> 01:10:54,496
..even though, as in this case,
I had been warned in advance..

1087
01:10:54,579 --> 01:10:58,124
..that I would be subjected
to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.

1088
01:10:59,084 --> 01:11:03,213
We shall hope to deal with matters
of more vital interest next week.

1089
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:05,715
Good night, and good luck.

1090
01:11:13,431 --> 01:11:17,227
In the last analysis, the Senator was
perched on the television high dive..

1091
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:19,604
..and all prepared
to make a resounding splash.

1092
01:11:19,688 --> 01:11:22,399
He jumped beautifully,
but he neglected to check first..

1093
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:25,276
..where he was going to land.
It must have been a shock..

1094
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,863
..to discover that Mr. Murrow
had drained the water out of the pool.

1095
01:11:29,739 --> 01:11:32,325
- Is that the Times? Gould?
- Yeah, it's Jack Gould.

1096
01:11:32,409 --> 01:11:34,494
- He's a hell of a writer.
- Yes, he is.

1097
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,789
- If we can afford him!
- Stanton's got a public opinion....

1098
01:11:37,872 --> 01:11:39,457
Senate's investigating McCarthy.

1099
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:41,584
What?

1100
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:45,338
TheArmy's charging that McCarthy
and Cohn exercised undue pressure..

1101
01:11:45,422 --> 01:11:48,800
..to get preferential treatment
for Schine. - Who's the source?

1102
01:11:48,883 --> 01:11:52,929
- Got a second source? - There isn't,
but this is coming out in 2 hours.

1103
01:11:53,013 --> 01:11:56,349
- Who's heading up the investigation?
- It's not gonna be McCarthy!

1104
01:11:56,433 --> 01:11:58,226
- Really?
- What happened?

1105
01:11:58,393 --> 01:12:01,271
- Also get me the Washington Post!
- What's going on?

1106
01:12:01,354 --> 01:12:02,856
It's Williams
for Jack Thompson.

1107
01:12:02,939 --> 01:12:04,733
The Senate's investigating McCarthy.

1108
01:12:05,567 --> 01:12:07,694
There is an added bit of comedy
to this whole story.

1109
01:12:07,777 --> 01:12:09,779
The Committee cannot convene
for several days..

1110
01:12:09,863 --> 01:12:12,615
..because Senator McCarthy
has a slight case of laryngitis.

1111
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:16,578
And he must recover
over the desert air of Arizona.

1112
01:12:19,873 --> 01:12:23,418
- But Stevens is going after him
and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah.

1113
01:12:23,501 --> 01:12:25,920
They're gonna allow each side
to call witnesses..

1114
01:12:26,004 --> 01:12:27,839
..and be privy to other testimony.

1115
01:12:28,131 --> 01:12:32,010
- Fred, we still have a meeting!
- We're gonna go to talk to Thompson.

1116
01:12:34,554 --> 01:12:36,056
No, thanks, Jack. Bye.

1117
01:12:36,931 --> 01:12:39,893
Freddy, we're a hit.
Right up there with "Howdy Dowdy"!

1118
01:12:41,186 --> 01:12:43,188
Can I have
an outlet satellite, please?

1119
01:12:45,023 --> 01:12:51,655
- 74, 76, 47. Thank you.
- Murrayville 3, 1 -2-7-6.

1120
01:13:11,675 --> 01:13:14,803
The fact of newscaster
Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday..

1121
01:13:14,886 --> 01:13:18,848
..does not remove from the record
that peculiar history..

1122
01:13:19,557 --> 01:13:24,604
..of the leftist slanting of news
indulged consistently by the CBS.

1123
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:29,234
Hollenbeck was what most astute
students of CBS's strange..

1124
01:13:29,567 --> 01:13:31,903
..and questionable new methods
considered..

1125
01:13:31,987 --> 01:13:37,575
.."typical of its newscasters".
By Jack O'Brian.

1126
01:15:11,795 --> 01:15:13,838
Oh, yeah. I like it like that.

1127
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:20,011
One of the best programs I ever heard
was called "CBS Views The Press".

1128
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,181
A great many people liked it,
some didn't,..

1129
01:15:23,556 --> 01:15:26,184
..but no one ever called it
anything but honest.

1130
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:30,397
It was the workof an honest reporter.
Don Hollenbeck.

1131
01:15:31,356 --> 01:15:33,733
He also worked occasionally
on "See It Now".

1132
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:37,278
He did the 11 p.m. news
over some of these stations.

1133
01:15:37,988 --> 01:15:40,699
He had been sick lately
and he died this morning.

1134
01:15:41,282 --> 01:15:43,868
The police said
it was suicide... gas.

1135
01:15:45,578 --> 01:15:46,871
Not much of an obit.

1136
01:15:47,330 --> 01:15:50,500
But, at least we got our facts
straight, and it was brief.

1137
01:15:51,543 --> 01:15:54,087
And that's all Don Hollenbeck
would have asked.

1138
01:15:55,046 --> 01:15:56,840
Good night, and good luck.

1139
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,597
Got to be in Philadelphia
this morning.

1140
01:16:05,682 --> 01:16:07,183
What time is your train?

1141
01:16:08,268 --> 01:16:09,269
8:00.

1142
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:13,440
- Charlie going with you?
- Uh-huh.

1143
01:16:22,449 --> 01:16:23,658
Here's a thought.

1144
01:16:25,493 --> 01:16:26,870
What if we're wrong?

1145
01:16:29,539 --> 01:16:30,790
We're not wrong.

1146
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,210
We're not going to look back..

1147
01:16:36,254 --> 01:16:38,381
..and saywe protected
the wrong side?

1148
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:46,139
Protected them from what? In the name
of what? What would we be preserving?

1149
01:16:47,265 --> 01:16:50,685
Argument could be made,
"for the greater good".

1150
01:16:52,937 --> 01:16:55,649
Not once you give it all away.
It's no good then.

1151
01:16:57,359 --> 01:16:58,735
It's just a thought.

1152
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:10,205
Senator, may we not drop this? We know
he belonged to the Lawyer's Guild.

1153
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:12,874
And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me.

1154
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:16,920
- I did you, I think, no personal
injury, Mr. Cohn. - No, sir.

1155
01:17:17,003 --> 01:17:19,631
- I meant to do you
no personal injury. - No.

1156
01:17:19,798 --> 01:17:22,884
And if I did, I beg your pardon.

1157
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:28,765
Let us not assassinate this lad
further, Senator. You've done enough.

1158
01:17:29,099 --> 01:17:32,644
- Let's... let's....
- Have you no sense of decency, sir?

1159
01:17:32,852 --> 01:17:37,983
At long last, have you left
no sense of decency?

1160
01:17:38,358 --> 01:17:42,362
- I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.
- Senator, I think it hurts you, too.

1161
01:17:42,487 --> 01:17:45,991
- I'd like to finish this.
- Have you some private reservation..

1162
01:17:46,074 --> 01:17:49,869
..when you take the oath
that you will tell the whole truth..

1163
01:17:50,245 --> 01:17:53,415
..that lets you be the judge
of what you will testify to?

1164
01:17:53,581 --> 01:17:57,210
The answer is there's no reservation
about telling the whole truth.

1165
01:17:57,377 --> 01:18:02,716
Thank you, sir. Then tell us
who delivered the documents to you!

1166
01:18:02,799 --> 01:18:05,844
I don't want to mean that
this new fashion is not chic.

1167
01:18:05,927 --> 01:18:09,681
- I think it's just no good for me.
- Uh, not for you.

1168
01:18:09,973 --> 01:18:12,684
Milko, anything you care to say
on that subject?

1169
01:18:12,767 --> 01:18:14,144
I think no comment.

1170
01:18:17,772 --> 01:18:21,151
It's got to be there. If you can't
find it, I can't write about it.

1171
01:18:21,234 --> 01:18:23,653
- Check again.
- Charlie said he dropped it off.

1172
01:18:23,737 --> 01:18:26,906
- Charlie said he dropped....
- Shirley, can I see you a minute?

1173
01:18:27,115 --> 01:18:28,742
- I got to call you back.
- Joe!

1174
01:18:28,867 --> 01:18:29,868
You, too.

1175
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,254
Close the door.

1176
01:18:44,507 --> 01:18:45,592
Have a seat.

1177
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,349
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah.

1178
01:18:53,016 --> 01:18:56,102
Uh, you both are aware
that there's a policy at CBS..

1179
01:18:56,186 --> 01:18:58,313
..that no two employees
can be married.

1180
01:19:01,107 --> 01:19:04,527
I want to ask you a question,
but I don't want you to answer it.

1181
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:06,363
I want you to consider it.

1182
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:09,199
I know you two are married.

1183
01:19:11,284 --> 01:19:12,410
Everyone knows.

1184
01:19:13,578 --> 01:19:14,871
That's not my question.

1185
01:19:15,246 --> 01:19:18,333
In the next few weeks
I have to lay off a couple of people.

1186
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:21,252
We're making some significant cuts
across the board.

1187
01:19:22,545 --> 01:19:24,172
I wanted you to know that,..

1188
01:19:24,381 --> 01:19:27,342
..because you could save
someone else being fired.

1189
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:33,390
I'm asking you to consider
making this decision a little easier.

1190
01:19:35,725 --> 01:19:37,394
I don't need an answer now.

1191
01:19:38,937 --> 01:19:40,981
Just think about it.

1192
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:43,650
Good.

1193
01:19:55,578 --> 01:19:56,830
- Well, Joe...
- Well?

1194
01:19:57,247 --> 01:20:00,458
- Sure we're gonna miss you
around here. - I'll pack my things.

1195
01:20:03,712 --> 01:20:06,423
- I think it's for the best.
- We'll find out!

1196
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:10,343
Mrs. Wershba...

1197
01:20:13,221 --> 01:20:14,389
Everybody knew.

1198
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,400
Natalie, did he say
what it was about?

1199
01:20:25,483 --> 01:20:28,361
No. Just that he wanted to talk
to you in his office.

1200
01:20:44,085 --> 01:20:45,211
Uh-oh!

1201
01:20:48,632 --> 01:20:52,093
The problem isn't simply
that you've lost your sponsor.

1202
01:20:52,469 --> 01:20:54,804
With Alcoa, "See It Now"
still loses money.

1203
01:20:54,888 --> 01:20:56,264
The fee is 50,000 dollars.

1204
01:20:56,348 --> 01:20:58,933
Last week's episode we did
for less than 50,000 dollars.

1205
01:20:59,017 --> 01:21:00,935
Fred, you're speaking
beyond your competence.

1206
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:03,438
We'll certainly find another sponsor.

1207
01:21:03,521 --> 01:21:07,233
"64,000 Dollar Question" brings in
over 80,000 in sponsors..

1208
01:21:07,317 --> 01:21:09,527
..and it costs one-third
of what you do.

1209
01:21:09,611 --> 01:21:12,614
Ed, I've got Tuesday night
programming that's number one.

1210
01:21:12,697 --> 01:21:16,159
People want to enjoy themselves.
They don't want a civics lesson.

1211
01:21:16,242 --> 01:21:19,162
- What do you want, Bill?
- I don't want to get a stomachache..

1212
01:21:19,245 --> 01:21:21,748
..every time you take on
a controversial subject.

1213
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:26,544
I'm afraid that's the price
you have to be willing to pay.

1214
01:21:27,963 --> 01:21:30,924
Let's walk very carefully
through these next few moments.

1215
01:21:31,007 --> 01:21:33,426
The content of what we're doing
is more important..

1216
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,888
..than what some guy in Cincinnati....
- It's what you're doing, Ed. Not me.

1217
01:21:36,972 --> 01:21:38,098
Not Frank Stanton. You.

1218
01:21:38,473 --> 01:21:42,477
"CBS News", "See It Now"
all belong toyou, Bill.

1219
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,687
You wouldn't know it.

1220
01:21:45,438 --> 01:21:50,235
- What is ityou want? Credit?
- I never censored a single program.

1221
01:21:51,194 --> 01:21:55,615
I hold on to affiliates
whowanted entertainment from us.

1222
01:21:55,991 --> 01:21:57,784
I fight to keep the license..

1223
01:21:57,867 --> 01:22:01,246
..with the very same politicians
that you are bringing down,..

1224
01:22:01,329 --> 01:22:06,376
..and I never,
never said no to you. Never.

1225
01:22:07,752 --> 01:22:10,880
I would argue that we have done
very well by one another.

1226
01:22:12,007 --> 01:22:13,925
I would argue that this network..

1227
01:22:15,176 --> 01:22:18,221
..is defined by what the news
department has accomplished.

1228
01:22:18,305 --> 01:22:22,350
And I would also argue that never saying
no is not the same as not censoring.

1229
01:22:22,434 --> 01:22:25,603
Really? You should teach journalism.
You and Mr. Friendly.

1230
01:22:31,985 --> 01:22:33,320
Let me ask you this:

1231
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:36,823
..why didn't you correct McCarthy..

1232
01:22:36,906 --> 01:22:39,951
..when he said that Alger Hiss
was convicted of treason?

1233
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,830
He was only convicted of perjury.
You corrected everything else.

1234
01:22:44,497 --> 01:22:47,709
Did you not want the appearance
of defending a known Communist?

1235
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:50,629
I would argue that everyone censors,
including you.

1236
01:22:54,633 --> 01:22:56,343
What do you want to do, Bill?

1237
01:23:00,347 --> 01:23:03,308
I'm taking your program
from a half an hour to an hour.

1238
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:06,895
And it won't be a weekly program
and it won't be Tuesday nights.

1239
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,898
- When would it be?
- Sunday afternoons.

1240
01:23:13,401 --> 01:23:15,695
- How many episodes?
- 5.

1241
01:23:18,448 --> 01:23:20,367
Why don't you just fire me, Bill?

1242
01:23:20,492 --> 01:23:22,869
I don't think
it's what either of us wants.

1243
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:28,708
You owe me 5 shows.

1244
01:23:38,718 --> 01:23:41,346
- You won't like the subject matter.
- Probably not.

1245
01:23:41,513 --> 01:23:43,682
Fred, I'll need you for a moment.

1246
01:23:58,405 --> 01:24:00,740
- Thank you, Mary.
- Goodbye, Mr. Friendly.

1247
01:24:06,955 --> 01:24:10,292
- He wants me to lay a few people off.
- I'm sure he does.

1248
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:13,503
Let's do our first show
about the downfall of television.

1249
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:20,051
- Senate's gonna vote to censure
McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably.

1250
01:24:20,135 --> 01:24:23,346
- And then what happens?
- He sits in the back row. - Right.

1251
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,892
- They keep him in the Senate.
They don't kick him out. - No, he stays.

1252
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,739
Well, we might as well
go down swinging.

1253
01:24:44,743 --> 01:24:47,662
Did you know the most trusted man
in America is Milton Berle?

1254
01:24:47,746 --> 01:24:49,706
See, you should have worn a dress!

1255
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:54,044
- How does a Scotch sound?
- Scotch sounds good.

1256
01:24:55,086 --> 01:24:57,631
- Did you know Joe and Shirley
were married? - Sure.

1257
01:24:57,714 --> 01:24:59,758
- Did everyone know?
- Pretty much.

1258
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:02,636
We are proud because
from the beginning of this nation..

1259
01:25:03,094 --> 01:25:04,554
..man can walk upright.

1260
01:25:07,265 --> 01:25:09,517
No matter who he is
or who she is.

1261
01:25:10,393 --> 01:25:14,356
He can walk upright
and meet his friend or his enemy.

1262
01:25:15,231 --> 01:25:18,276
And he does not fear
that because that enemy..

1263
01:25:19,235 --> 01:25:21,404
..may be in a position
of great power..

1264
01:25:22,364 --> 01:25:27,160
..that he can be suddenly
thrown in jail..

1265
01:25:28,703 --> 01:25:32,207
..to rot there without charges
and with no recourse to justice.

1266
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:37,337
We have the Habeas CorpusAct
and we respect it.

1267
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:41,383
I began by saying that our history
will be what we make it.

1268
01:25:42,133 --> 01:25:43,677
If we go on as we are,..

1269
01:25:43,969 --> 01:25:47,555
..then history will take its revenge,
and retribution will not limp..

1270
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:49,057
..in catching up with us.

1271
01:25:50,558 --> 01:25:54,562
Just once in a while, let us exalt the
importance of ideas and information.

1272
01:25:55,939 --> 01:25:59,401
Let us dream to the extent of saying
that on a given Sunday night..

1273
01:25:59,484 --> 01:26:01,736
..the time normally
occupied by Ed Sullivan..

1274
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,615
..is given over to a clinical survey
on the state of American education.

1275
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:09,119
And a weekor two later, the time
normally used by Steve Allen..

1276
01:26:09,202 --> 01:26:13,498
..is devoted to a thorough-going study
of American policy in the Middle East.

1277
01:26:14,457 --> 01:26:18,003
Would the corporate image of their
respective sponsors be damaged?

1278
01:26:18,295 --> 01:26:21,506
Would the shareholders rise up
in their wrath and complain?

1279
01:26:22,299 --> 01:26:23,300
Would anything happen..

1280
01:26:23,383 --> 01:26:27,178
..other than a few million people would
have received a little illumination..

1281
01:26:27,262 --> 01:26:30,515
..on subjects that may well determine
the future of this country..

1282
01:26:30,598 --> 01:26:33,101
..and therefore the future
of the corporations?

1283
01:26:33,852 --> 01:26:37,272
To those who say, "People wouldn't
look, they wouldn't be interested,.."

1284
01:26:37,355 --> 01:26:40,358
"..they're too complacent,
indifferent and insulated"..

1285
01:26:40,567 --> 01:26:44,446
..I can only reply: there is,
in one reporter's opinion,..

1286
01:26:44,904 --> 01:26:47,532
..considerable evidence
against that contention.

1287
01:26:48,575 --> 01:26:51,578
But even if they are right,
what have they got to lose?

1288
01:26:51,828 --> 01:26:53,413
Because if they are right,..

1289
01:26:53,496 --> 01:26:55,540
..and this instrument
is good for nothing..

1290
01:26:55,624 --> 01:26:58,168
..but to entertain,
amuse and insulate,..

1291
01:26:58,877 --> 01:27:00,754
..then the tube isflickering now..

1292
01:27:00,837 --> 01:27:03,923
..and we will soon see
that the whole struggle is lost.

1293
01:27:04,883 --> 01:27:06,426
This instrument can teach.

1294
01:27:06,843 --> 01:27:09,346
It can illuminate
and it can even inspire.

1295
01:27:10,013 --> 01:27:14,100
But it can do so only to the extent
that humans are determined to use it..

1296
01:27:14,184 --> 01:27:15,602
..towards those ends.

1297
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:19,606
Otherwise,
it is merely wires and lights..

1298
01:27:20,315 --> 01:27:21,483
..in a box.

1299
01:27:24,569 --> 01:27:27,030
Good night, and good luck.
