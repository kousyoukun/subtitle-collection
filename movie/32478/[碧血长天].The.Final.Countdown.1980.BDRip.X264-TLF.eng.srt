1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:16,300


2
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:30,552
Have a nice day.

3
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:19,067


4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,414


5
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,463
Mr. Tideman.

6
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:50,098


7
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:02,110


8
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:07,115


9
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:12,461
Mr. Lasky?
AW3 Marty Padanski.

10
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:17,796


11
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,398
Mr. Lasky? I'm Richard Tideman's
executive assistant.

12
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:52,835
- Glad to know ya. Are you going with me?
- No.

13
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,203
Mr. Tideman just wanted
to see you off.

14
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,807
- Is that him in the car?
- Yes.

15
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:02,046
Well, we've never met.
Can I introduce myself?

16
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:04,275
It isn't necessary,
Mr. Lasky.

17
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:07,784
As I said,
he came to see you off.

18
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:11,049
Well, thank him for me.

19
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:59,228


20
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,569
Take a look, sir.

21
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:14,877
Arizona Memorial.

22
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,103
She's now resting in 33 feet of water
in an upright position.

23
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,834
There were only 289 survivors.

24
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:49,779
Russian trawler.

25
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,683
What's it doing?

26
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,124
Not doing
much fishing!

27
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:54,402


28
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:02,516
I'll take it, sir.

29
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:05,590
Mr. Lasky, I'm Commander
Dan Thurman, executive officer.

30
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:08,057
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

31
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:10,390
Now follow me
to the Bridge.

32
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:13,090
Stand clear, spot 3.

33
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:16,726
Helo-733, rotating.

34
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,736
- Give me 25 knots of wind over the deck.
- Aye, Captain.

35
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:21,829
- All ahead full.
- All ahead full, aye.

36
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,171
- Indicate 1 00 R.P.M.
- Indicate 1 00 R.P.M. Aye, sir.

37
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:29,372
Central Bridge,
all ahead full, 1 00 R.P.M.

38
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:32,440
- Continue fixed wing recovery.
- Aye, Captain.

39
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,611
Let's bring the Kag aboard.

40
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:37,746
Victor-200,
your signal is Charlie.

41
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:40,825
- Set 52, Tomcat.
- Set 52, Tomcat.

42
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,023
T-minus 30 seconds.

43
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:56,170
Tomcat 200.
I'm on approach and lining up.

44
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,301
Gear coming down.

45
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,386
200, slightly right.

46
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,017
Gear down and locked.

47
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,684
Add power. Power.

48
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,920
All indicators green.

49
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,724
Hold there.

50
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:22,626
Hold it. Slightly left.

51
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,401
In the groove. Looks good.

52
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:18,549
In the port, Cat 1. Get below.
We still have aircraft to land.

53
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:20,682
I hear you're on assignment
from Tideman Industries

54
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,056
to the Defense Department, right?

55
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,151
- Yeah, that's right.
- What is your job, Mr. Lasky?

56
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:27,993
- I'm a systems analyst.
- Oh, efficiency expert, right?

57
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:30,193
Yeah, you could say that.

58
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,407
- That's a quick change in the weather.
- Yeah!

59
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,844
Sure is.

60
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:55,583
- Hi, Kag.
- It's getting a little strange out there, boys.

61
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:57,958
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Lasky.
- Thank you, Captain.

62
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:01,897
- Are we headed for a squall?
- Not an official one.

63
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:04,231
Sir, this is Commander Damon,
operations officer.

64
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,327
- How do you do, Mr. Lasky?
- Fine, thank you.

65
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,395
And Lieutenant Perry,
officer of the deck.

66
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:09,700
- How do you do, sir?
- Good, sir.

67
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:11,070
Mr. Lasky is going to be
taking a look

68
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:13,303
at how we do things
here aboard the Nimitz.

69
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,675
- We'll give you whatever help we can, sir.
- Thank you.

70
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,716
Our departure
was delayed two days

71
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:22,378
- at the request of your mysterious boss.
- I'm sorry about that, Captain

72
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:25,150
but I'm afraid Mr. Richard Tideman
is as much a mystery to me

73
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:28,624
- as he is to the rest of the world.
- Two days.

74
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,195
Perhaps the fact that Tideman
helped design and build this ship

75
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:33,730
affords him some
special privileges.

76
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,597
Corporal Kullman will escort you
while you're aboard ship.

77
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,796
- Right this way, sir.
- Oh, Mr. Lasky?

78
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,339
I'd be delighted if
you'd join me for dinner.

79
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,366
Thank you, Captain.
I'd like that.

80
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:09,793
Am I mistaken, or was Black Cloud's
forecast this morning

81
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:14,567
- for clear skies and sunshine?
- I'll bet he wishes it wasn't, sir.

82
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,073
Hand me that weather report,
please.

83
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,576
Thank you.

84
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:39,559
What do you think it is?

85
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:43,499
It wasn't there
on the morning run.

86
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,729
Check all projection lenses,
and if it's not there, check all receivers.

87
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:48,830
Aye, aye, sir.

88
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,524
The Nimitz. Who's that?

89
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,359
- A Russian trawler.
- What's he want?

90
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:17,595
A big fish!

91
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:20,331
You've been assigned
Navigator's inport cabin, sir.

92
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:23,498
Connects with Commander Owens,
our air wing commander.

93
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:27,440
Your luggage has
been delivered, sir.

94
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,241
I'll be just outside, sir,
if there's anything you need.

95
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:31,679
Thank you.

96
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:10,946
Hello?

97
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:36,703
"'Pacific At War,
Commander Richard T. Owens.''

98
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,215
Very well.

99
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:52,824
We're having communication problems
with the incoming flights.

100
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:56,128
- What do you mean?
- It's interference from the storm, sir.

101
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:59,260
- Get Black Cloud up here.
- Yes, sir.

102
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,638
Sunshine and clear skies.

103
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,181
- Anything else you'd like to see?
- I beg your pardon.

104
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:17,448
What the hell are you
doing in my cabin?

105
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:18,544
I'm terribly sorry.

106
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:20,783
You're Commander Owens.
I'm Warren Lasky.

107
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,258
They put me next door.

108
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:27,354
Mr. Lasky, the one thing
we cherish aboard a ship is privacy.

109
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,558
Maybe it's because we get
so damn little of it.

110
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,465
I understand.
I hope you'll forgive me.

111
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:37,034
You know, from what I've read,
your manuscript is very good:

112
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:38,166
I mean, really very good.

113
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:41,177
Thank you.
You a historian, Mr. Lasky?

114
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:45,012
I'm a little bit of everything, I guess.
I work for Tideman Industries.

115
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,278
What exactly is your job
aboard this ship?

116
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:50,013
Very simply, I look at the way
you people do things

117
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,612
and if I can think
of any alternatives

118
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:56,683
I write it up and submit a report
to the Department of Defense.

119
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:59,262
Think you'll find some?

120
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,731
Well, there are always
alternatives, Commander.

121
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,860
Mr. Lasky, please don't
look for them in here.

122
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,974
Excuse me.

123
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,149
Boss, Kag's here.

124
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:30,717
George, any further word
from Stanton?

125
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:34,027
We know he's inbound, but we can't
talk to him. His radios are garbled.

126
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:37,693
Just wish he had more experience.

127
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,363
Yes, Captain.
Yes, sir. He's right here.

128
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:43,032
- Kag?
- Yes, Skipper?

129
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:46,110
- How many planes have you got in the air?
-Just one, sir.

130
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:49,169
- Our newest pilot, Stanton.
- Well, get him aboard as fast as you can.

131
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,613
- I want to get out of this weather.
- Right away, Skipper.

132
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,151
- He wants him down now. Keep trying.
- Corsair, 41 2.

133
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:57,211
Air Ops Primary, try again on 41 2.
See if you can reach him.

134
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:10,098


135
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:13,262
Take a look
at the scope, sir.

136
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:16,397
The water temperature's
down five degrees

137
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:19,466
and even the barometer's
giving improper readings.

138
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,240
It should be down,
and it's way up.

139
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:28,183
- What the hell is that?
- It seems to have a cycle, sir.

140
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:31,483
One run it's there,
the next one is clear.

141
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:36,322
One run it's there, the next one is clear.
I've never seen anything like it.

142
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:39,295
Turn those destroyers around
and head them back to Pearl Harbor.

143
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:42,230
- No need for them to go through this.
- Yes, sir.

144
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,064
Keep it in the wind till we get
that Corsair aboard.

145
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:46,569
It's one of our new pilots.

146
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:49,834
All units in Romeo Alpha,
this is Kilo Bravo.

147
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,980
This is 4 1 2. I have an unsafe
hook indicator. Over.

148
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:09,583
4 1 2, roger. Unsafe hook.
Recycle your hook.

149
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,254
Negative.
I've tried that.

150
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,629
4 1 2,your transmission's poor.
Say your fuel's state.

151
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,759
Captain Boss, that Corsair's in real trouble.
Can't get his tail hook down.

152
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,963
- I think we better take him in the barricade.
- Rig it!

153
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,940
Air Ops, tri-flight.
On the flight deck!

154
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:27,706
We have an A-7 Corsair in trouble.
Can't get his hook down.

155
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:32,910
This is not a drill.

156
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:36,681
Repeat, this is not a drill.
Now rig the barricade.!

157
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:40,986
Bow deck.! Bow deck.!
This is no drill.!

158
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,051
All right.! Let's go.!

159
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,858
Go on.! Let's hustle now.!

160
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,970
All personnel
off the deck now.!

161
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:07,114
Barricade coming up.
Clear the area.!

162
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:09,278
Clear the flight deck.!

163
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:20,157
- Do you see him out there yet?
- Yeah, there he is!

164
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:23,689
Head's up! Green deck,
land aircraft.

165
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,033
My God. Look at that.

166
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:09,100
Have Central come up on theJ.A.

167
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:12,136
- Steady as she goes.
- Steady as she goes, aye.

168
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,701
Central Bridge,
pick up theJ.A.

169
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:19,344
- Aye, sir.
- Where's that plane?

170
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:23,319
I don't see it,
Captain.

171
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,388
Sound general quarters.

172
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:33,555
- Aye, Captain. Boatswain.
- Boatswain mate. Aye, sir.

173
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:35,690
- Sound general quarters.
- Aye, sir.

174
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:47,166
General quarters,
general quarters.

175
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,304
All hands,
man your battle stations.

176
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,941
Go up and forward on your starboard side,
down and aft on your port side.

177
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,450
General quarters,
general quarters.

178
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:07,431
Time plus two minutes.

179
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:22,002
- What the hell's goin' on?
- General quarters, sir. Come with me.

180
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,139
Time plus three minutes.

181
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:36,017
Time plus four.

182
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:38,789
Report when all stations
are manned and ready.

183
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:42,332
Got him right there!
Comin' in! A-7 Corsair!

184
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:47,630
Heads up on deck!
He's in bound to the barricade.

185
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,935
Green jackets
to the barricade.

186
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:02,952
We can't hear you.

187
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,026
All right.

188
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:29,646
Crash on deck! Crash on deck!
All personnel respond now!

189
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,478
Let's get out there
and watch for fire.!

190
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:38,444
Red shirts, front and center!
Move it, move it!

191
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,891
Move it!

192
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,861
- Go back to course 3 50.
- Aye, aye, sir.

193
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,339
Okay! Take 'er down!

194
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:09,512
All personnel on the Flight Deck,
let's turn to.

195
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:17,255
Blue shirts, locks and chains
on the aircraft.

196
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:28,869
Is this the last known position
of our destroyers before the storm?

197
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:31,601
- Yes, sir, Captain.
- Skipper.

198
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:35,167
Dan, go down and check out
the Threat Board.

199
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:39,410
- Keep me posted.
- Right.

200
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,348
- Get Kag up here.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,614
I want to talk
to CI NPAC Fleet.

202
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:47,418
Captain, we're down across the board.
Antennas check out, but we're off the air.

203
00:23:47,525 --> 00:23:49,925
- Any word from our destroyers?
- We aren't getting anything

204
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:52,621
except some code transmissions
in the 200-meter band.

205
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,392
Otherwise, we're dead
as a doornail.

206
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:58,196
- Ops, what's our radar picture?
- Radar shows us clear, sir.

207
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:01,238
Clear? Can't you see
that Russian trawler?

208
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:03,738
I have the signal officer
on deck, but no visual sighting, sir.

209
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:06,742
Keep me advised.
Navigator, what's our posi?

210
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:10,678
27 0, Captain.
280 miles west of Pearl Harbor.

211
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:15,378
Oh, Dick. Launch a Hawkeye
to check ship's communications

212
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:19,150
a Crusader to make a photo run over
Pearl and put two Tomcats on ready alert.

213
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:22,350
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Captain! Captain!

214
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,724
Hey, what happened?

215
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:27,764
Frankly, I don't know.

216
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:31,266
Lieutenant, have the heads
of all departments

217
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,963
meet me at C.V.I.C.
immediately after the launch.

218
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,128
Aye, aye, sir.

219
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:38,369
- Mr. Lasky, I want you to stay with me.
- Captain's off the Bridge.

220
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,876
It's a code.

221
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:43,105
Can you break it,
Chief?

222
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,809
- I think someone's putting us on.
- Why?

223
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:50,183
Because I learned this code
at Great Lakes. It's ancient.

224
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:53,120
Thanks, Chief.

225
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,921
Stand clear at 0 1 2.
Hawkeye rotating.

226
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:23,209
Off the bow, stand clear.

227
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,414
736 lifting for plane guard.

228
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:53,139
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

229
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,343
- Go hold your own!
- Who said that?

230
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:57,920
Chrissakes, Chief, all we want to know
is what's going on.

231
00:25:57,988 --> 00:26:00,513
- Whatever it is, you'll be told.
- When?

232
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:03,754
- As soon as the skipper's ready.
- That's what they always say!

233
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:11,195
Hey, Ex-O, what's goin' on?
Attention on deck!

234
00:26:11,268 --> 00:26:13,361
Carry on.

235
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:24,073
Gentlemen, we're at general quarters,
because I don't have any idea what's happened.

236
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:27,708
But I don't exclude
the possibility of war.

237
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:32,620
- A nuclear strike?
- Possibility.

238
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,285
- Now, what action's been taken?
- Well, Skipper

239
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:37,883
there's nothing on the Threat Board

240
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:40,122
and there's been no
significant damage to the ship.

241
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:43,655
- The crew's in good shape.
- Air wing is intact. First team's ready to go.

242
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:46,294
E-2 is now showing the area clear,
and reconnaissance aircraft

243
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:48,132
should be coming up on Pearl, sir.

244
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:52,170
The reactor is stable.
All readings are normal.

245
00:26:52,242 --> 00:26:54,938
Capable for maximum speed,
Captain.

246
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:57,503
- Lloyd.
- We can transmit and receive

247
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:00,016
- but we haven't been able to reach anybody.
- Why's that?

248
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:02,551
Tried everybody in the book--
CI NPAC,Joint Chiefs--

249
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,451
I even took a crack
at the White House.

250
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:06,512
Now, we do have some low-band
transmissions--

251
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,455
strictly manual
stuff with very low power.

252
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:11,221
We'll have to do some retuning
to transmit in that range.

253
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:12,852
Get on with it!

254
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,127
- Ops?
- All radar's up, all weapon systems check out.

255
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:22,194
- We're ready, sir.
- Mr. Lasky. You have anything to add?

256
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,433
- No, sir, not at this time.
- Skipper.

257
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:27,567
I have a reconnaissance report
coming in now, sir.

258
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:34,207
Flight level 250.
Camera rolling.

259
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:39,916
There doesn't appear to be any damage.
Seems to be some unusual shipping traffiic.

260
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,151
I'll make another pass
for a close-up series.

261
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:45,353
- Over.
- E.T.A. to Nimitz, 1 2 minutes, sir.

262
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:48,989
Skipper, we're picking up some weird
traffic on the A.M. broadcast band

263
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:52,058
on the entertainment circuit,
but the signal strength is very weak.

264
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:56,163
Boss, I told you. I tried and tried,
and I can't get Carmichael to go to sleep.

265
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:58,901
Rochester, that polar bear's
got to go to sleep.

266
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:01,103
- He's supposed to hibernate.
-Jack Benny?

267
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:04,272
Where is he now?

268
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:07,043
Sittin'up in bed,
readin' Esquire.

269
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:09,847
Esquire? Well,
take it away from him.

270
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,653
Oh, come now, boss.
He's been around.

271
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:17,091
Lloyd, tape and monitor
all transmissions.

272
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:20,686
Ops, I want a closer look on all air,
surface and subsurface contacts

273
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,891
within 250 miles
of this ship.

274
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,492
Dick, put some tankers and a medium-sized
strike force on a 30-minute alert.

275
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:28,571
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Any questions?

276
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:32,735
Skipper, the ship is still at general quarters.
Request permission to go to condition 3.

277
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:37,270
Granted. I'll be on the Bridge.
I want answers.

278
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,578
Attention on deck!

279
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:50,082
Secure from general quarters.
Set condition 3.

280
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,424
- I stand relieved.
- Very well.

281
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:30,160
- Bridge.
- Captain's on the Bridge.

282
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:35,967
Captain, C.I.C. reports a surface contact
bearing 3 50 at 1 30 miles.

283
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:40,107
- I want an I.D. on the surface contact.
- Yes, sir.

284
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:42,372
- Launch the ready alert.
- Aye, sir.

285
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:20,174
Which, translated
into world terms

286
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,119
means a worldwide reduction
of armaments

287
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:30,592
to such a point
and in such a thorough fashion

288
00:30:30,627 --> 00:30:34,222
that no nation
will be in a position

289
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:36,856
to commit an act
of physical aggression

290
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:40,597
against any neighbor anywhere

291
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,935
in the world.

292
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,701
What the hell's the matter with him?

293
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:47,437
He's asking us to trust our enemies,
and he knows better.

294
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:50,012
You're absolutely right.

295
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:01,019
Hey, Laurel,
you finished that very quickly.

296
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:06,859
Well, I hope so. Let's see,
where were we? Uhh--

297
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:10,492
''And there''-- Oops.
''And therefore''-- Ah, here we are.

298
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,865
''So if he does choose
to support my program

299
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,234
let Senator Chapman
be assured now

300
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:17,899
that I am fully aware
of those qualities in him

301
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:21,035
which recommend him
as cabinet material.''

302
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:24,410
I think that says it exactly.
You agree, Arthur?

303
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:28,281
- Miss Scott, you should've been a diplomat.
- I rather thought I was.

304
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:31,411
Well, you certainly cooked up
a compromise that's gonna make your boss

305
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:34,013
the next vice president
of the United States.

306
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:37,254
I better type this up before you two start
trying to improve on it.

307
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:39,852
- Thanks, Laurel.
- Here in downtown Honolulu

308
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,263
the weather is 78
under partly cloudy skies.

309
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:46,928
Arthur, will you leave the girl
enough clothes on not to catch cold?

310
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:48,301
She's too valuable to me.

311
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:49,963
Have you slept with her yet?

312
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,305
What kind of a question is
that to ask a married man?

313
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,402
- You son of a gun!
- Think I better go check what she's doin'.

314
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:59,505
- Oh, sure!
- Arthur, have another drink

315
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:01,846
and stop thinking about how
much everybody else is gettin'.

316
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,320
- Thanks!
- See you later.

317
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:12,919
We swung it, Laurel. How about that?
We really swung it!

318
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,625
- Did you tell him you were sleeping with me?
- What?

319
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:19,463
Laurel. I wish I was.

320
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:22,562
- I'm not gonna lie about it.
- People assume you are anyway.

321
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:26,541
- I'll just have to live with the fact.
- Fact?

322
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:29,044
Of what they think.

323
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:31,444
You're a strange girl,
Laurel.

324
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:35,712
You give more back talk and less
cooperation than any girl on Capitol Hill.

325
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:38,254
I don't know why I put up with
you and your dog.

326
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:40,256
I don't know why
I just don't fire you.

327
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,554
Because I'm the best
political assistant you'll find

328
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,957
and you're still more interested
in politics than sex.

329
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:47,997
Charlie!

330
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:50,295
What is he barking at?

331
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:55,669
Charlie, what is it?

332
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,906
Listen.

333
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:24,465
They had U.S. markings.

334
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:27,162
- You sure of that?
- I thought so too.

335
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,705
Their speed!
Are they ours?

336
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:33,867
I don't know. But if they are ours,
they've kept them a close secret.

337
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:39,512
- I want inquiries made as soon as we return.
- Yes, Senator.

338
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,684
Bridge.

339
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:55,130
Skipper, the F-1 4s
are on top of the contact.

340
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:59,197
Alert 1 , this is Eagle 1 .
What have you got?

341
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,794
We've overflown
the craft, sir.

342
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:05,000
It's a civilian yacht,
flying U.S. flag

343
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:07,805
about 50 feet in length,
old but in mint condition.

344
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:11,507
- Over.
- Hold observation position.

345
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:14,106
Dispatching 86 tanker
for refueling.

346
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:25,991
Stand clear, Path 1.

347
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,156
86 tanker departing.

348
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,371
The challenger's back with one,
two, threejabs to the mouth.

349
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:41,001
Louis responds with a right to the head.
Cuts with a left to the body.

350
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:43,706
- Brings it up to the head.
- Hey, who's that fighting?

351
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,874
- Louis takes another left and a right.
- I don't know.

352
00:34:46,983 --> 00:34:50,885
Louis is staggered by a right to thejaw.
He almost goes down.

353
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:53,455
There's the bell ending round 1 2.

354
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:56,219
Look sharp, feel sharp

355
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:59,353
Be sharp and listen, mister
How are you fixed for blades

356
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:02,660
- Do you have plenty?
- How are you fixed for blades

357
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:04,165
You're better off--

358
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:05,724
Let's get some air.

359
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,963
Captain's off the Bridge.

360
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:14,401
I don't know.

361
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:20,213
Dan, what's this all about?
What do you make of it?

362
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:23,150
Nostalgia broadcasting
on the Armed Forces band.

363
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,314
Broadcasting
after a strike? Nah.

364
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:28,823
Excuse me.

365
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:35,120
Sir, is it possible that this could be
part of some secret naval maneuver?

366
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:37,656
- Course not.
- There are a few people

367
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:42,137
- who'd like to watch us work under pressure.
- What are you saying, Dan?

368
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:44,265
The Department of Defense sent
him out here.

369
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,673
Maybe they wanted
to give him something to watch.

370
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:49,268
Now, that makes more sense
than anything else so far.

371
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:53,476
Now, wait a minute, gentlemen. You may
be the victims of some kind of joke.

372
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,142
But whether the Pentagon's
behind it

373
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,550
or the Kremlin
or some little green men from Mars

374
00:35:57,654 --> 00:36:00,384
I promise you, I'm as much
in the dark about it as you are.

375
00:36:00,457 --> 00:36:03,187
Captain, we're getting something
you might wanna hear.

376
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,955
- In the Plot Room.
- Aye, sir.

377
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,564
The Germans are retreating
on the 70-mile front in southern Russia.

378
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:23,271
However, forces were reported
200 miles from Moscow

379
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,180
and long-range artillery fire
was heard in the suburbs of Moscow.

380
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:31,345
- Meanwhile in Washington--
- What the hell's going on here?

381
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:32,615
Sir, I think you ought to see

382
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:34,953
these aerial reconnaissance
photographs of Pearl Harbor.

383
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:37,118
- Turn that off!.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:39,253
That'll be all.
You.

385
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:52,300
- It's not Pearl Harbor.
- Sure as hell is.

386
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:55,503
Look at that old battle rig.

387
00:36:55,612 --> 00:37:00,276
It's a memorial now.
It's the Arizona.

388
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:06,147
- But she's completely intact.
- That's right.

389
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:10,217
- Get Mr. Lasky back up here.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,926
What's the matter
with you?

391
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:21,493
I was just on the Bridge.
They're scared. Real scared.

392
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:25,530
- What happened?
- It's crazy.

393
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:29,237
The Russians, us,
even the Germans.

394
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:32,179
- We've finally done it.
- Done what, for Christ's sake?

395
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:37,653
- War. We're at war.
- You always talkin' shit.

396
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:45,588
I want a straight answer

397
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:48,961
and I don't give a damn about any orders
you've had elsewhere.

398
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:51,056
Is there something
you've held back?

399
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,635
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing, Captain.

400
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:59,573
All right.
I accept that.

401
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:04,477
Here's a photo taken by our reconnaissance
pilots less than an hour ago.

402
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:11,918
- May I suggest something, Captain?
- I'm wide open.

403
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:15,151
I suggest that you ask Commander Owens
to come up here right away

404
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:17,625
and bring the photos he's using
to illustrate his book.

405
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:19,059
Why?

406
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:22,621
I think he'll have something
very interesting to show you.

407
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:23,859
All right.

408
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:36,001
Tanker, this is Alert 1. You got
two thirsty Tomcats. Whaddya got?

409
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:38,637
I've got the hard stuff.
Pull right in.

410
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:51,323
Contact.

411
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:52,690
We've got a green light.

412
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:55,856
Fill 'er up, check the oil
and clean the windshield. Over.

413
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:04,263
Dick, where'd you get these?

414
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:08,402
I got them from the Smithsonian, sir.
They're old agency photos of Pearl.

415
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:11,447
-Just like these.
- Not like these.

416
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:14,244
That one was taken
less than an hour ago.

417
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:18,545
I don't understand, sir.
These are pre-World War II pictures.

418
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:20,782
This is the fleet
that was destroyed.

419
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:25,692
Sir, C.I.C. reports two bogeys
at low altitude. Distance, 1 25 miles.

420
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:29,163
- Have our fighters take an I.D. pass.
- Aye, Captain.

421
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:38,036
Have our fighters investigate and
identify the contact 090, signal Buster.

422
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,906
Aye, sir. Alert 1 ,
this is Eagle Control.

423
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:44,640
Vector 2 1 0 for the bogeys.
Bogeys low and slow.

424
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:48,047
Your signal is Buster.
I say again,your signal is Buster.

425
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:51,645
Roger, Eagle Control.
Alert 2 now completing its fueling.

426
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:54,053
Vectoring 2 1 0. Out.

427
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:03,387
That's the Arizona,
Tennessee, West Virginia.

428
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,924
You're saying

429
00:40:06,002 --> 00:40:08,800
that these are both photographs
of Pearl Harbor

430
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:11,669
on December 6, 1 941 ?

431
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:18,906
Yes, sir.

432
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:20,983
Our reconnaissance plane
has just taken pictures

433
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,780
of something
that hasn't existed

434
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:26,583
for over 40 years.

435
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:29,921
Sir, we've got I.D.
on the bogeys.

436
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:34,521
- Captain's on the Bridge.
- What button?

437
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:36,599
Eleven, sir.

438
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:41,297
Alert 1 , this is Eagle 1 .
What have you got?

439
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:44,568
- TwoJapanese Zeros, sir.
- Two what?

440
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:49,169
Two trophy-class Mitsubishi
A6Ms in original condition

441
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:51,304
complete with all markings.

442
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:54,282
- I mean, they look brand new, sir.
- Have you been spotted?

443
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:57,342
Negative. We're right
on the side at 6.:00 high.

444
00:40:57,387 --> 00:41:00,288
Stay in visual contact.
Take no action without clearance.

445
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:02,950
Wilco, Eagle 1. Out.

446
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:08,659
-Jack Benny and Rochester.
- And newscasts from World War II.

447
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:11,427
Somebody
for some reason

448
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:13,969
wants us to believe
that we're back in 1 941 .

449
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,061
- Now, who wants it?
- The Russians.

450
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:18,231
- Oh, Dan.
- Maybe. Power of psychology.

451
00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:20,333
Excuse me, Captain

452
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,038
but we also have to consider
one alternative possibility.

453
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:24,579
What's that?

454
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:27,616
The possibility that what's
happening here is real.

455
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:29,276
Geez, that's ridiculous.

456
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:32,786
Maybe, but we have some
pretty strong evidence, sir.

457
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:35,518
Let's not just write off one
possible explanation for it

458
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:38,993
- because we don't happen to like it.
- How would that be possible?

459
00:41:39,095 --> 00:41:41,495
- Could you explain that to me?
- No, sir, I can't.

460
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:44,022
But all of us know that movement
through time is possible.

461
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,658
Einstein proved it.

462
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:47,930
- In theory.
- In theory.

463
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:50,700
So all we have to do is move
through some storm at sea, and bingo--

464
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:53,071
we're all much more
clever than Einstein.

465
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:56,805
What sort of storm was that, Commander?
Certainly nothing like I've ever seen.

466
00:41:56,913 --> 00:42:00,076
Nothing like any of us
have ever seen.

467
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:01,343
There are forces in the universe

468
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,282
which we're only now just
beginning to understand.

469
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:05,878
I mean, understand through science,
not superstition.

470
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:08,981
There are black holes in space,
antimatter, curved space--

471
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:10,423
things that are as strange to us

472
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:13,155
as electricity would have been
to people in the Middle Ages

473
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:17,188
or this ship
in World War II.

474
00:42:19,836 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, crew is anxious
for an explanation too.

475
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:29,304
Now, we've gotta get
a clearer picture of all this.

476
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:32,706
Let's go to C.I.C.

477
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:50,262
Hey.

478
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:53,028
- What is it?
- Listen.

479
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:02,603
It's those planes again.

480
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:06,740
No, no.
Different noise entirely.

481
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:08,909
There they are.

482
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:32,807
- They're not ours, are they?
- No, certainly not.

483
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:35,207
They haveJapanese markings.

484
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:50,051
They're comin' in again.

485
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:57,289
Laurel, ask the captain
to radio Hawaii.

486
00:43:57,367 --> 00:44:00,427
Find out aboutJapanese
fighter planes in the area.

487
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:02,595
Yes, Senator.

488
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:15,643
Oh, God! They're shooting!

489
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:25,719
Oh, my God.

490
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:30,628
- Oh, no.
- The captain send the message?

491
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,332
We've gotta
get off this boat.

492
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:38,499
Come on, Laurel!

493
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,401
Eagle Control,
this is Alert 1.

494
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:46,209
Theyjust strafed the hell
out of that yacht.!

495
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:48,011
Why would they
attack a yacht?

496
00:44:48,785 --> 00:44:52,448
Their job would be to destroy anything
with a radio that could warn Pearl Harbor.

497
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:55,980
Providing you
and Mr. Einstein are correct.

498
00:44:56,025 --> 00:45:02,021
Dick, where would theJapanese fleet be
at this time on December 6, 1 941 ?

499
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:03,998
Well, sir, they'd be off the scope

500
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,694
but an educated guess
would be around about here.

501
00:45:06,803 --> 00:45:10,330
Excuse me. They'd have to be here,
up around the northwest sector.

502
00:45:10,406 --> 00:45:13,307
Let's get this settled once and for all.
Have the E-2 check it out.

503
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:15,900
I wanna see if theJapanese
task force is out there.

504
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:17,036
Yes, sir.

505
00:45:17,113 --> 00:45:20,674
Eagle Control, Alert 1.
They're making another run.

506
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,548
Jesus.! They'll shoot that
damn yacht to pieces.!

507
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:25,678
Request permission
to arm and fire.

508
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:28,019
- For God sakes, Skipper--
- Negative.

509
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,789
- Charlie? Charlie!
- No, Laurel! Not now!

510
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:34,728
Come on! Those planes are coming in!
Come on!

511
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:37,766
Let's go! Come on, Harvey!

512
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:57,252
Eagle Control, they blew it to bits.
They must've hit the fuel tank.!

513
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:00,811
- Any survivors?
- Stand by.

514
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:05,020
Affiirmative.
One, two, three Mae Wests.!

515
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:07,562
Hey, wait a minute!
Those bastards are turning back!

516
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:10,327
They're gonna strafe them in the water!
Request permission to fire.

517
00:46:10,399 --> 00:46:14,062
This is Eagle 1 . You are cleared to arm,
but do not fire.

518
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,003
Throw them off,
play with them, but don't fire.

519
00:46:17,073 --> 00:46:19,098
Affirmative.

520
00:46:22,578 --> 00:46:26,571
- Sam! Sam.
- All right. It's all right. I'm all right.

521
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:29,510
Look up!

522
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:32,383
Oh, no!
They're coming again!

523
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:39,420
Harvey! Get that life preserver off
and dive!

524
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:41,622
I can't swim!

525
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:44,257
Here they come!

526
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,542
He's dead.

527
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,690
It's okay. Easy, boy.
Up you go.

528
00:47:26,242 --> 00:47:29,769
Hey, Fox, that woke 'em up!

529
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:32,508
I think we should
give 'em another shot.

530
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,314
Why the hell are we
playing with these guys?

531
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:22,718
Radar shows enemy planes
heading on course, 220.

532
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:25,818
- 220.
- SweetJesus.

533
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:28,295
Skipper, they're headed
straight for us

534
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:31,765
and we've got an armed strike force
just sitting on the deck.

535
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:38,566
Alert 1 , this is Eagle 1 .
You're cleared to fire.

536
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:42,610
Splash the Zeros.
I say again, splash the Zeros.

537
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:47,012
- Yes, sir.
- This has gotta be a dream.

538
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:51,872
Eagle Control, Alert 1.

539
00:50:51,947 --> 00:50:54,541
Splash two. Repeat.

540
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,709
Splash two.

541
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:59,653
Possibly one survivor
in the water.

542
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:02,519
Captain, the E-2
is coming upon Point Charlie.

543
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:06,052
Eagle Control, we have
multiple radar contacts

544
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:08,960
picking up on 456 heading.

545
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:12,728
Possible carriers
and 2 4 escort ships.

546
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:14,827
Southeasterly heading.

547
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:17,168
Negative radio
or radar emissions.

548
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:19,833
Request instructions.
Over.

549
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:21,900
That is theJapanese
attack force.

550
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:25,777
Yeah. I guess
now we know.

551
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:30,284
Look, Dick. Take personal charge
of a rescue team

552
00:51:30,386 --> 00:51:32,911
and keep the survivors
isolated.

553
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:35,013
- Crazy situation.
- Yes, sir.

554
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,956
- You know what I want.
- I understand.

555
00:51:37,026 --> 00:51:38,891
Keep the fighters airborne
to cover the rescue.

556
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:39,653
Aye, aye, Skipper.

557
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:43,255
Now track and report all movements
of theJapanese task force.

558
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:45,323
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Do you still think it's a dream?

559
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:47,892
It's a nightmare.

560
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,574
Let go!
Forget the damn dog!

561
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,758
- Boss, 36.
- Go ahead, 36.

562
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:56,764
We got two survivors
and now we're waiting to pick up Kag.

563
00:53:56,832 --> 00:54:00,859
- Kag? What the hell is he doing in the water?
- Damned if I know.

564
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:14,511
Charlie!

565
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:24,186
You all right,
ma'am?

566
00:54:26,462 --> 00:54:28,453
How you feeling, sir?

567
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:32,125
What the hell kind of machine is this thing?
And what's your ship, Commander?

568
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:35,500
It's an aircraft carrier, sir.
I'm Air Wing Commander Richard Owens.

569
00:54:35,571 --> 00:54:39,302
- Sam Chapman.
- Senator Samuel Chapman?

570
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,502
That's right.

571
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:43,841
Sure am glad
you were out here.

572
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:49,815
Yes, sir.

573
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:26,715
Okay, Senator,
watch yourself.

574
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:28,847
Watch your head.

575
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,457
- All right, take it easy.
- Hang on to me, sir.

576
00:55:32,528 --> 00:55:34,962
You'll be just fine.

577
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:42,126
It's all right, ma'am.
Go with him.

578
00:55:42,237 --> 00:55:44,296
I'll take the dog,
Commander.

579
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:19,203
Little bastard.

580
00:56:40,028 --> 00:56:42,019
Corporal!

581
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:54,342
Mind the store, Ray.
I'm going forward.

582
00:56:59,014 --> 00:57:03,974
- Holy cow.
- It's the wholeJapanese fleet.

583
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:21,794
Have these things returned
to theJapanese pilot. Get this translated.

584
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:27,537
Captain's on the Bridge.

585
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:39,653
Mr. Lasky.
Gentlemen.

586
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:42,156
Captain's off the Bridge.

587
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:54,793
We can't ignore it
any longer.

588
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,361
Every man on this ship knows
that we have radar and visual contact

589
00:57:57,473 --> 00:57:59,941
with a Japanese fleet
approaching Pearl Harbor

590
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:03,637
on December 6, 1 941 .

591
00:58:03,712 --> 00:58:06,203
- Now, what do we do about it?
- Skipper,

592
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:09,773
what we do about it
is blow them out of the water.

593
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:13,082
The U.S.S. Nimitz declares war
on theJapanese empire?

594
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:16,851
That's what we'd be doing. But they haven't
attacked Pearl Harbor yet.

595
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:20,725
The only evidence we have that
they intend to is in the history books.

596
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:24,698
It opens up some
amazing possibilities.

597
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,827
Think of the firepower
of the U.S.S. Nimitz back in 1 941 .

598
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:31,395
What kind of possibilities,
Mr. Lasky?

599
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,273
Possibilities for the future,
Mr. Owens.

600
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:36,971
Think of the history
of the next 40 years.

601
00:58:38,714 --> 00:58:41,342
I have a suspicion history will be a little
more difficult to beat

602
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:43,577
than you imagine,
Mr. Lasky.

603
00:58:43,652 --> 00:58:46,746
I'm talking about
the classic paradox of time.

604
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:50,019
Imagine, for example, I go back in time
to meet my own grandfather

605
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:52,593
long before he got married,
before he had children.

606
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:54,652
We have an argument,
and I kill him.

607
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:58,530
Now, if that happens,
how am I ever gonna be born?

608
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:01,102
And if I can never be born,
how can I go back in history

609
00:59:01,169 --> 00:59:04,332
and meet
my very own grandfather?

610
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:07,636
I'm not half the theorist
you are, Mr. Lasky

611
00:59:07,743 --> 00:59:10,712
but I still have a gut instinct
that things only happen once.

612
00:59:10,779 --> 00:59:13,805
And if they have happened, then there's
nothing we can do to change them

613
00:59:13,882 --> 00:59:16,715
- nor should we try.
- How are you gonna avoid it?

614
00:59:16,785 --> 00:59:19,583
It's already happening,
and we're already involved.

615
00:59:19,655 --> 00:59:23,648
For Christ's sake, what is this?
Some half-ass Princeton debating society?

616
00:59:23,759 --> 00:59:26,227
We are in a war situation.

617
00:59:26,295 --> 00:59:28,320
This is a United States
warship

618
00:59:28,397 --> 00:59:30,524
or at least
it used to be.

619
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:33,659
Or will be.
Or what the hell ever.

620
00:59:33,769 --> 00:59:35,964
Oh, goddamn it, you can
drive yourself crazy

621
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:37,663
trying to think about this stuff.

622
00:59:37,773 --> 00:59:40,503
-Jesus, I must be dreaming!
- Now, hold it.

623
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:43,670
All right.
Let's all calm down.

624
00:59:43,779 --> 00:59:48,182
Let's take it one step at a time
and by the book.

625
00:59:48,283 --> 00:59:51,684
If the United States of America
falls under attack

626
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,382
our job is to defend her

627
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:56,821
in the past, present
or future.

628
00:59:56,892 --> 00:59:59,884
- And after that?
- After that, we take our orders

629
00:59:59,928 --> 01:00:02,897
from the commander in chief
of the United States Armed Forces.

630
01:00:04,499 --> 01:00:07,332
Franklin Delano Roosevelt?

631
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:28,347
- Everything all right here?
- You in command of this ship?

632
01:00:28,423 --> 01:00:31,881
Oh, hardly. No, I'm a doctor.
Ship's commander is Captain Yelland.

633
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,019
I'm sure he'll be down to see you
as soon as possible.

634
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:36,689
- I certainly hope so.
- Meanwhile, you both seem

635
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:39,461
- none the worse for your little mishap.
- Mishap?

636
01:00:39,534 --> 01:00:41,525
You call getting a boat shot out
from under you

637
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:44,038
and three people dead a mishap?

638
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:46,801
- Are we at war? Is that what happened?
- I'm not in a position to--

639
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:55,541
Am I glad to see you.

640
01:00:57,152 --> 01:00:59,643
Doctor

641
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:02,418
would you please inform the captain
that Senator Samuel Chapman

642
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:04,391
cochairman of the Senate
Defense Committee

643
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:05,790
would like to see him at once?

644
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:08,295
Of course, Senator.

645
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:11,858
Doctor, I believe
I said at once.

646
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:15,528
First, a vitamin shot.
Now, if you'll both roll up your sleeves.

647
01:01:15,604 --> 01:01:18,300
- Senator.
- No, goddamn it!

648
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:20,637
Now, you can take up
your needles, Doctor

649
01:01:20,709 --> 01:01:24,008
and whatever's in them
and get the hell out of here!

650
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:28,674
Corporal?

651
01:01:38,093 --> 01:01:41,187
What the hell
are we, prisoners?

652
01:02:37,052 --> 01:02:40,146
Holy shit.

653
01:02:47,095 --> 01:02:50,223
Smoking lamp is lighted
in all authorized spaces.

654
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:06,170
Son of a--

655
01:03:07,582 --> 01:03:09,982
So, history may be tougher
to beat than I imagined.

656
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:12,713
You're becoming
a real pain in the ass, Lasky.

657
01:03:12,788 --> 01:03:15,450
You take an awful lot of risks for someone
who's supposed to be intelligent.

658
01:03:15,524 --> 01:03:20,325
Do I? ''The attack on Pearl Harbor
was far from a surprise for many people

659
01:03:20,395 --> 01:03:23,990
among them, the prominent
and ambitious Samuel S. Chapman

660
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:25,430
who had only two weeks before

661
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,492
publicly argued for an increase
in our strength in the Pacific.

662
01:03:28,537 --> 01:03:31,165
Ironically, the senator disappeared
and was presumed dead

663
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:33,707
following the attack
he had foreseen so clearly.

664
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:36,209
Had he lived,
it's very possible

665
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:40,714
Chapman could have been Roosevelt's
running mate in the 1 944 election

666
01:03:40,749 --> 01:03:44,947
and upon his death, the next
president of the United States.''

667
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,716
Now if that doesn't come under
the heading of trying to beat history

668
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:48,687
I don't know what does.

669
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:51,123
Lasky, I realized who we had
the moment I heard his name.

670
01:03:51,226 --> 01:03:52,386
Why'd you keep it to yourself?

671
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,792
I don't have your appetite
for playing God with the world.

672
01:03:54,863 --> 01:03:57,525
What was I supposed to do,
throw him back in the sea?

673
01:03:57,632 --> 01:03:58,894
At least that would have
preserved

674
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:00,935
the natural order
of history as you've written it.

675
01:04:01,036 --> 01:04:03,004
Go to hell, Lasky.

676
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,596
Go to hell yourself.
I wanna meet Chapman.

677
01:04:08,443 --> 01:04:10,673
Goddamn it.

678
01:04:10,745 --> 01:04:12,872
If this wasn't happening to me,
I wouldn't believe it.

679
01:04:12,948 --> 01:04:16,281
- Who the hell are these people?
- The navy.

680
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:19,616
Yeah, the navy, yeah.
But what part of it?

681
01:04:19,688 --> 01:04:22,316
I've never seen machines
like they got onboard this thing.

682
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:25,120
And where have they been
developing aircraft like that?

683
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:28,356
The navy would have to
appear before my committee

684
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:31,432
and I've never even heard
a whisper about it.

685
01:04:31,499 --> 01:04:35,595
Rocket planes and that thing
they pulled us out of the sea with.

686
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:39,470
And naming this ship after Chester Nimitz,
an active-duty admiral.

687
01:04:39,574 --> 01:04:41,542
What the hell's
going on here?

688
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:45,910
Yeah, Roosevelt.
He owns the military.

689
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,245
That's it.

690
01:04:48,316 --> 01:04:50,079
That's exactly who.

691
01:04:50,185 --> 01:04:53,086
F.D.R. has wanted the United States
in this war since it started

692
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:54,850
but he knows there's no way
it's gonna happen

693
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:56,117
except in response to an attack.

694
01:04:56,191 --> 01:04:59,354
- You always said theJapanese would attack.
- That's right.

695
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:01,657
And who's sitting out here
with no press

696
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,198
while the White House takes
all the credit for raising the alarm

697
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:07,029
and being ready
to hit back?

698
01:05:07,102 --> 01:05:10,367
- Obviously, we are.
- Goddamn it!

699
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:26,577
Anything?

700
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:28,350
Whoever he is,
he's either too scared

701
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:30,084
or too well briefed
to talk about it.

702
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:34,260
Excuse me.

703
01:05:38,066 --> 01:05:40,057
All right, Corporal.

704
01:05:40,135 --> 01:05:44,333
Commander, I demand to know
why we're being held prisoners.

705
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,767
Here wait. I got him.

706
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,775
Jesus Christ!

707
01:05:57,852 --> 01:06:00,582
No, don't!

708
01:06:01,957 --> 01:06:03,925
Oh, my God.

709
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:46,363
The prisoner has shot one,
maybe two of your men.

710
01:06:46,434 --> 01:06:48,425
Move in!

711
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:56,706
Captain, prisoner
grabbed a weapon.

712
01:06:56,811 --> 01:06:59,780
He shot one of my men,
maybe two.

713
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:02,442
We're in position.
The area is sealed off.

714
01:07:02,517 --> 01:07:04,678
Stand by.

715
01:07:06,421 --> 01:07:08,912
Get Lieutenant Kajima
up here on the double.

716
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:13,784
Can't we get a translator
down here, for God's sakes?

717
01:07:13,862 --> 01:07:17,025
How the hell do we know what he's saying
if we can't understand him?

718
01:07:17,132 --> 01:07:19,532
We need a translator to tell him
we need a translator.

719
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:24,597
Maybe that's just what
he's trying to tell us.

720
01:07:47,862 --> 01:07:52,265
All right, Dick, Lieutenant Kajima is here.
Put it on the box.

721
01:08:01,409 --> 01:08:03,400
Ask him what he wants.

722
01:08:16,391 --> 01:08:19,019
He wants access
to a radio, sir.

723
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:20,789
Does he say why?

724
01:08:20,895 --> 01:08:24,296
Because he wants to
warn his commander

725
01:08:24,332 --> 01:08:26,823
about us.

726
01:08:38,813 --> 01:08:41,338
He repeats the demand.

727
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:44,817
- Or else?
- He will kill again.

728
01:08:47,555 --> 01:08:49,079
Do you think there's a chance
they might believe him?

729
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:54,655
There's no chance if things remain
the way they are.

730
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:02,803
Tell him we agree.

731
01:09:43,378 --> 01:09:46,711
- You son of a--
- No! Don't shoot! Back off!.

732
01:09:46,781 --> 01:09:48,874
Don't shoot!

733
01:09:48,983 --> 01:09:51,474
Back off!. Back off!.
Don't shoot!

734
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:54,419
What the hell's
going on down there?

735
01:10:04,332 --> 01:10:07,859
He says one more attempt to trick him
and the girl is dead.

736
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:12,100
There'll be no tricks. He can use
the radio room if he frees the girl.

737
01:10:24,652 --> 01:10:27,018
Says he doesn't believe you.

738
01:10:29,023 --> 01:10:31,548
Why don't you tell him
what's going on here, Commander?

739
01:10:31,626 --> 01:10:34,060
You're an expert on what's
gonna happen tomorrow

740
01:10:34,128 --> 01:10:35,857
tell him about it,
for God's sakes.

741
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:38,763
Go on, tell him!
We got nothing to lose!

742
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:43,761
Go ahead, tell him.

743
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:50,477
26 November, six carriers
left the Coral Isles north ofJapan.

744
01:10:59,354 --> 01:11:03,347
The carriers were
the Akagi, Kaga, Shokaku

745
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:05,983
Zuikaku, Hiryu, Soryu.

746
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:10,861
Tomorrow at dawn,
these carriers will send 3 53 planes

747
01:11:10,965 --> 01:11:13,729
to attack Pearl Harbor.

748
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:16,531
How in the hell
do you know all that?

749
01:11:21,409 --> 01:11:25,778
Your code is
''Climb Mount Niitaka.''

750
01:12:18,132 --> 01:12:20,464
What's going on?

751
01:12:23,838 --> 01:12:27,069
Please, Miss Scott,
don't ask me any questions.

752
01:12:27,141 --> 01:12:30,042
There isn't anything
I can tell you at this time.

753
01:12:42,757 --> 01:12:44,748
All right?

754
01:12:46,294 --> 01:12:50,663
Where's Charlie?
Where's my dog?

755
01:12:50,765 --> 01:12:54,166
We'll find him,
Miss Scott.

756
01:12:54,268 --> 01:12:56,498
He can't get off
the ship.

757
01:12:59,273 --> 01:13:04,575
Casualties will be moved
down to secondary triage.

758
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:08,342
I wanna get out of this bathrobe
and into some clothes!

759
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:10,748
Will somebody please get me
some clothes? For God's sakes!

760
01:13:10,818 --> 01:13:14,845
- Chief, get the senator some clothes.
- Yes, sir.

761
01:13:14,922 --> 01:13:17,891
Senator, Matt Yelland,
commanding officer.

762
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:22,725
Where and how did you get
all this information I've been hearing?

763
01:13:22,797 --> 01:13:25,357
- And is it true?
- Yes, sir.

764
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:28,266
Did you inform
Pearl Harbor Command?

765
01:13:28,336 --> 01:13:30,964
- No, Senator.
- Why the hell not?

766
01:13:34,342 --> 01:13:37,641
Well, the reasons are a little complicated,
but, uh, believe me, Senator

767
01:13:37,712 --> 01:13:41,239
this carrier is capable of handling
any attack should it occur.

768
01:13:41,315 --> 01:13:43,340
One carrier
against a whole fleet?

769
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:45,409
What kind of an idiot
do you take me for?

770
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,715
- Senator, calm down.
- The hell with you.

771
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:50,757
Tell Pearl Harbor what's happening here,
or I'll talk to them.

772
01:13:50,825 --> 01:13:53,191
Very well.

773
01:13:53,261 --> 01:13:56,628
Dan, set up the communications
in my inport cabin.

774
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:01,898
Wouldn't you like to talk to them
with some clothes on?

775
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:08,102
- Thank you, Captain.
- Follow me, sir.

776
01:14:14,882 --> 01:14:18,181
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir, I'm fine.

777
01:14:18,252 --> 01:14:20,777
Can you do that, Captain?

778
01:14:20,855 --> 01:14:24,791
Contact Pearl Harbor
back in 1 941 .

779
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:28,552
I think so.

780
01:14:28,663 --> 01:14:32,394
- Then what do you do?
- One step at a time.

781
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:36,130
Yeah. Like a minefield.

782
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:57,451
This is, uh, Senator Samuel S. Chapman
of the United States Senate

783
01:14:57,525 --> 01:15:00,517
onboard
the aircraft carrier Nimitz.

784
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:03,120
Captain Yelland
is here with me.

785
01:15:03,197 --> 01:15:05,427
- You're on what?
- I repeat.

786
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,493
I am Senator Samuel S. Chapman
onboard the U.S.S. Nimitz.

787
01:15:09,604 --> 01:15:11,902
All right,
whoever the hell you are

788
01:15:12,006 --> 01:15:16,136
use of military frequencies
by unauthorized personnel is a felony.

789
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,405
Now just a minute here, sir.

790
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:22,244
As we have no aircraft carrier Nimitz
and no Captain Yelland

791
01:15:22,316 --> 01:15:26,582
I suggest, asshole, that you stop
impersonating some other asshole

792
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:27,951
and get off the air.

793
01:15:28,022 --> 01:15:30,047
You're wasting our time.

794
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:33,560
How dare you talk to me that way!
Captain, tell him who you are.

795
01:15:33,628 --> 01:15:35,118
Speak to them!

796
01:15:39,934 --> 01:15:43,165
You, what are you doing here?
You're a civilian.

797
01:15:43,237 --> 01:15:45,171
Yes, sir, I'm with
the Department of Def--

798
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:46,729
I mean, the Navy Department.

799
01:15:46,774 --> 01:15:48,901
That's more like it.
What's going on here?

800
01:15:48,976 --> 01:15:51,604
I'm afraid I'm just
an observer here, sir.

801
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,943
I couldn't tell you anything more
than you already know.

802
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:58,211
What's happening here?

803
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:02,716
Who are you people?

804
01:16:09,697 --> 01:16:11,927


805
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:14,399
-join him in his inport cabin.
- Thank you.

806
01:16:19,106 --> 01:16:21,404
I'll wait outside
while you change.

807
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:26,640
Please, I really don't want to
be left alone right now.

808
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:29,239
I'll just be a minute.

809
01:16:35,323 --> 01:16:38,190
Just exactly what is it you do
for the senator, Miss Scott?

810
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:41,853
I work for him, Commander.

811
01:16:41,929 --> 01:16:44,727
I'd like to think I'm more
than just a secretary.

812
01:16:44,799 --> 01:16:49,133
I write most of his speeches,
and in general, I'm his assistant.

813
01:16:49,203 --> 01:16:51,797
It's quite an accomplishment
for a woman in your day--

814
01:16:51,906 --> 01:16:53,100
this day and age.

815
01:16:53,207 --> 01:16:57,200
Let me tell you something.
I'm ambitious and very capable.

816
01:16:57,311 --> 01:17:00,508
That's a combination
that's not much appreciated.

817
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:03,379
It's a man's world.
I'm sure you'll agree.

818
01:17:05,519 --> 01:17:07,612
It certainly is, Miss Scott.

819
01:17:07,722 --> 01:17:10,156
I spent a lot of time
trying to hide the way I look

820
01:17:10,224 --> 01:17:12,715
hoping to be recognized
for my ability.

821
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:16,228
- How's it going so far?
- Well, let me put it this way.

822
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:20,061
If the way I look gets me in the door,
then God help them when I get through.

823
01:17:20,134 --> 01:17:22,932
You're a remarkable woman,
Miss Scott.

824
01:17:24,872 --> 01:17:26,863
Shall we?

825
01:17:26,941 --> 01:17:28,841
Yeah.

826
01:17:41,255 --> 01:17:44,349
Enemy fleet bears 042 degrees.

827
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:46,983
Captain,
they bear 042 degrees

828
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:51,225
range 1 82 miles,
course 1 80, speed 1 2.

829
01:17:51,298 --> 01:17:53,323
Very well.
Keep me advised.

830
01:18:03,577 --> 01:18:07,308
35 degrees, 1 7 miles north,
northwest of Pearl.

831
01:18:07,381 --> 01:18:09,008
Laurel, are you all right?

832
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,109
Miss Scott, I'm Matt Yelland,
skipper of this ship.

833
01:18:12,186 --> 01:18:13,778
Thank you for your hospitality,
Captain

834
01:18:13,888 --> 01:18:15,287
but I insist you fly
Miss Scott and myself

835
01:18:15,389 --> 01:18:17,357
to Pearl Harbor immediately.

836
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:25,292
- Very well. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

837
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:28,163
Follow this officer. He'll see
that you're fully equipped

838
01:18:28,235 --> 01:18:30,760
and then escort you
to the hangar deck.

839
01:18:30,838 --> 01:18:32,271
Thank you, Captain.

840
01:18:34,508 --> 01:18:37,739
- Charlie?
- Forget about the dog. He'll be all right.

841
01:18:37,812 --> 01:18:41,976
Wait a minute, Captain.
I think you're making a big mistake here.

842
01:18:42,049 --> 01:18:46,611
That man mysteriously disappeared
on December 7, 1 941 . That's today, sir.

843
01:18:46,721 --> 01:18:49,952
Now, at the present time, he
is the front-running candidate

844
01:18:50,024 --> 01:18:53,425
for the vice presidential spot
on the Democratic ticket in 1 944.

845
01:18:53,527 --> 01:18:55,154
And if he survives,
he's almost certain

846
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:57,254
to become the president
of the United States

847
01:18:57,331 --> 01:18:59,993
when Roosevelt dies
in April of 1 945.

848
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:05,300
Sir, don't you think he'd be a whole lot
safer to stay on the ship for the time being?

849
01:19:05,372 --> 01:19:09,775
Mr. Lasky, my job is to make decisions
here, now

850
01:19:09,844 --> 01:19:12,210
not worry about what politician
may be in the White House

851
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:15,112
- four years from now or 40 years ago.
- But, sir--

852
01:19:15,182 --> 01:19:18,151
And right now, I don't like
having two civilians on my ship

853
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:19,584
when I'm about to do battle.

854
01:19:19,653 --> 01:19:22,588
You've got three civilians.

855
01:19:22,656 --> 01:19:25,147
Mr. Lasky, you're free
to go with them if you like.

856
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:37,494
Dick.

857
01:19:39,306 --> 01:19:43,538
Just got enough time to drop them off
on a deserted spot on this island.

858
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:45,602
Not Pearl, sir?

859
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,409
Hell, no. They'll be
a whole lot safer there.

860
01:19:48,482 --> 01:19:51,974
We'll equip them
to look after themselves till it's over.

861
01:19:52,086 --> 01:19:55,283
I'll feel a lot easier
with them off my hands.

862
01:19:55,389 --> 01:19:57,380
Yes, sir.

863
01:20:00,594 --> 01:20:03,028
Be sure you're back by 07 00.

864
01:20:03,097 --> 01:20:06,123
I want my best man
commanding that strike force.

865
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,634
Yes, sir.

866
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:18,669
Now hear this.
Now hear this.

867
01:20:18,746 --> 01:20:20,509
All hands, stand by

868
01:20:20,614 --> 01:20:23,708
for special announcement
from the captain in 1 5 minutes.

869
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:34,689
What are you doing here,
Mr. Lasky?

870
01:20:34,762 --> 01:20:37,458
I wanna go to
Pearl Harbor with you.

871
01:20:43,437 --> 01:20:47,965
Wait a minute.
You're not going to Pearl, are you?

872
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,680
Do they know?

873
01:21:29,783 --> 01:21:34,777
Captain, enemy fleet 1 7 0 miles
north, northwest Pearl.

874
01:21:35,522 --> 01:21:40,755
TheJapanese fleet now bears
055 degrees, 1 62 miles.

875
01:21:55,009 --> 01:21:56,169
Look at all this ordnance.

876
01:21:56,243 --> 01:21:58,905
Yeah, it's gotta be
the real thing.

877
01:22:02,049 --> 01:22:03,311
Watch that wing tip!

878
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:13,752
This is the captain.

879
01:22:13,827 --> 01:22:16,728
I'm speaking to every man
aboard this ship.

880
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:20,322
In the past few hours,
many things have happened

881
01:22:20,434 --> 01:22:23,062
but rumors
of nuclear attacks

882
01:22:23,137 --> 01:22:26,470
and a third world war
are totally untrue.

883
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:30,567
We have no reason to believe
that any aggression has been taken

884
01:22:30,644 --> 01:22:34,045
against our homes
and families.

885
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:39,041
I believe that what we have stumbled
across is not man-made

886
01:22:39,086 --> 01:22:42,715
but a phenomena of nature.

887
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:46,317
One that
can't be explained.

888
01:22:46,393 --> 01:22:49,988
Now, this phenomena is a storm
which the Nimitz went through

889
01:22:50,064 --> 01:22:52,658
less than 1 8 hours ago.

890
01:22:52,766 --> 01:22:56,668
This storm has had some effect
on time as we know it.

891
01:22:56,704 --> 01:23:02,336
It created a portal,
a door into another era.

892
01:23:03,477 --> 01:23:07,436
Today is December 7, 1 94 1.

893
01:23:08,682 --> 01:23:13,244
I'm sure we're all aware
of the significance of this date

894
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,618
and its place in history.

895
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:18,522
We're about to fight a battle
that was lost

896
01:23:18,592 --> 01:23:21,322
before most of you
were born.

897
01:23:21,395 --> 01:23:25,798
This time, with God's help

898
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:27,892
it's going to be different.

899
01:23:28,936 --> 01:23:30,062
Good luck.

900
01:24:27,094 --> 01:24:30,689
Hey, Charlie.

901
01:24:30,764 --> 01:24:34,495
Good boy.
Where you been hiding?

902
01:24:34,568 --> 01:24:37,696
You wanna come with me?
Come on, boy.

903
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:46,779
Eagle Control, 736.

904
01:24:46,814 --> 01:24:49,282
E. T.A. destination
three minutes.

905
01:25:35,429 --> 01:25:37,556
All right, let's move it!

906
01:25:40,367 --> 01:25:42,733
This isn't Pearl Harbor!

907
01:25:42,836 --> 01:25:45,304
Following orders,
Commander?

908
01:25:45,372 --> 01:25:47,932
That's right, Senator.

909
01:26:01,155 --> 01:26:05,148


910
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:24,701
Is Commander Owens
in the air yet?

911
01:26:24,778 --> 01:26:26,803
- No, sir.
- Let me know the moment he's airborne.

912
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,871
Yes, sir.

913
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:33,009
Why didn't you
go with them?

914
01:26:33,086 --> 01:26:35,213
I wasn't invited.

915
01:26:48,101 --> 01:26:50,160
Skipper,
it's time to go.

916
01:26:50,237 --> 01:26:53,331
Then let's go...
to Pearl Harbor.

917
01:26:53,407 --> 01:26:55,466
You shoot that in here,
we're all going up.

918
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:59,205
Then you better do what I say.
Take off. Now!

919
01:27:38,051 --> 01:27:40,076
Don't let it go off!.

920
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:47,183
- I lost it. I lost the helo!
- What?

921
01:27:47,261 --> 01:27:50,389
I tell you, I lost it.
It just disappeared from the scope.

922
01:27:52,699 --> 01:27:54,564
What the hell do you mean
it just disappeared?

923
01:27:54,668 --> 01:27:55,726
That's it, Captain.

924
01:27:55,802 --> 01:27:58,771
One second it was on the scope,
the next it was gone.

925
01:27:58,872 --> 01:28:00,169
Search party?

926
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:05,542
It's too late. Officer of the deck,
turn the Nimitz into the wind.

927
01:28:05,612 --> 01:28:07,637
Aye, aye, Captain.

928
01:28:08,815 --> 01:28:11,079
- Launch aircraft.
- Yes, sir, Captain.

929
01:28:11,184 --> 01:28:16,486
That's it. Let's go. Cats, you got
green lights. Get 'em in the air!

930
01:30:02,396 --> 01:30:07,390


931
01:30:36,163 --> 01:30:38,495
Victory 2 1 0,
this is Zulu-5-Bravo.

932
01:30:38,565 --> 01:30:44,026
Your vector 1 20.
Estimated time of intercept 07 40. Over.

933
01:30:44,137 --> 01:30:48,665
Zulu-5-Bravo,
this is Victory 2 1 0.

934
01:30:48,742 --> 01:30:50,676
Nine minutes
to intercept.

935
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:56,206
Sir, I think
you oughta see this.

936
01:30:56,283 --> 01:30:58,683
It suddenly appeared
behind us.

937
01:31:01,555 --> 01:31:04,524
I don't believe this.
It's starting again.

938
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:07,384
Do you think
we can outrun it?

939
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:11,363
Maybe we oughta be asking ourselves
should we even be trying to outrun it.

940
01:31:11,398 --> 01:31:13,866
Six minutes to intercept.

941
01:31:14,668 --> 01:31:16,863
Change course to 1 80.

942
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:20,531
- All ahead, flank speed.
- Steady course 1 80.

943
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:23,735
- Come to course 1 80, aye, sir.
- All ahead flank.

944
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:27,268
- Indicate 1 25 R.P.M.
- All ahead flank, indicate 1 25 R.P.M.

945
01:31:39,826 --> 01:31:42,454
Zulu-5-Bravo,
this is Victory 2 1 0.

946
01:31:42,529 --> 01:31:46,898
I have enemy bandits on radar.
Approximately four minutes to intercept.

947
01:31:46,933 --> 01:31:50,300
2 1 0, this is Zulu-5-Bravo.
You're cleared to arm.

948
01:31:58,311 --> 01:32:00,711
Sir, when we changed course,
the storm changed course.

949
01:32:00,814 --> 01:32:03,715
It's following us
and growing at the same time.

950
01:32:03,817 --> 01:32:06,411
I'm recalling those planes.

951
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,011
- Wait a minute, sir. You can't do that.
- What are you talking about?

952
01:32:09,122 --> 01:32:11,181
We've got an incredible
opportunity here.

953
01:32:11,258 --> 01:32:14,125
We know where all the mistakes
are gonna be made for the next 40 years

954
01:32:14,227 --> 01:32:16,252
and you've got the power
to correct them.

955
01:32:17,364 --> 01:32:19,594
You stay out of this.

956
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:22,533
Scrub the mission.
Get those planes back.

957
01:32:30,577 --> 01:32:33,910
Your signal is Buster.
I say again, your signal is Buster.

958
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:36,608
Read you loud and clear.

959
01:32:36,683 --> 01:32:38,913
Strike Force,
this is Strike Leader.

960
01:32:38,985 --> 01:32:42,182
Return to base.
Mission aborted.

961
01:32:42,255 --> 01:32:45,486
Mission aborted?
But we can see 'em?

962
01:32:45,559 --> 01:32:48,460
Shit, they're gonna
let theJaps do it again.

963
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:56,192
This is the captain.
Now hear this, men.

964
01:32:56,269 --> 01:32:59,670
We've been through it once,
we're going through it again.

965
01:32:59,706 --> 01:33:02,607
Prepare for approaching storm.

966
01:33:21,394 --> 01:33:24,522
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special news bulletin.

967
01:33:27,634 --> 01:33:32,662
The enemy bombers appeared
over Pearl Harbor at about 7.:55 a.m.

968
01:33:48,121 --> 01:33:51,022
December 7, 1 94 1--

969
01:33:52,859 --> 01:33:56,317
a date which will live
in infamy--

970
01:34:18,151 --> 01:34:20,176
- Any contact with our planes?
- No, sir.

971
01:34:20,253 --> 01:34:23,416
Keep trying.

972
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:26,459
- Dan, get me a damage report.
- Right, Skipper.

973
01:34:26,493 --> 01:34:28,688
- Get a phone check with all stations.
- Yes, sir.

974
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:30,821
- You have control of the rudder.
- Bridge has control of the rudder, sir.

975
01:34:30,897 --> 01:34:34,355
- Very well.
- All stations who experienced contact.

976
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:44,636
There they are!
Lo, on the right!

977
01:35:54,447 --> 01:35:58,508
Stand by to render honors
to port U.S.S. Arizona.

978
01:36:00,687 --> 01:36:02,951
Attention to port.

979
01:36:03,056 --> 01:36:04,489
And salute.

980
01:36:06,059 --> 01:36:07,458
Two. Carry on.

981
01:36:16,369 --> 01:36:19,202
Pacific Fleet arriving.

982
01:36:27,113 --> 01:36:29,274
3rd Fleet arriving.

983
01:36:35,221 --> 01:36:37,348
Carrier Group 8 arriving.

984
01:36:44,931 --> 01:36:46,922
Matt, what the hell's
going on here?

985
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,490
Admiral, I don't know
where to begin.

986
01:36:48,601 --> 01:36:50,762
Aircraft carrier getting lost
in the Pacific Ocean.

987
01:36:50,837 --> 01:36:52,361
What kind of navy is this?

988
01:36:57,811 --> 01:37:00,746
He'll never believe it.

989
01:37:37,951 --> 01:37:39,976
Captain, the admirals
have departed.

990
01:37:40,053 --> 01:37:41,543
Thank you.

991
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:47,086
You seem to have a 40-year-old dog
on your hands.

992
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:49,720
Yeah, you could say that.

993
01:37:49,796 --> 01:37:52,765
- Good luck, Mr. Lasky.
- Thank you, Mr. Thurman. Good-bye.

994
01:37:56,369 --> 01:37:58,462
You know, in a way, Captain,
I think we're lucky.

995
01:37:58,571 --> 01:38:00,562
How's that?

996
01:38:00,673 --> 01:38:04,006
At least we came back
to the same world we left.

997
01:38:04,077 --> 01:38:06,671
Most of us have.

998
01:38:06,779 --> 01:38:09,805
Did Commander Owens
have any family?

999
01:38:09,883 --> 01:38:11,475
No one.

1000
01:38:12,785 --> 01:38:15,686
Lasky, you've been
a pain in the ass.

1001
01:38:17,090 --> 01:38:18,455
But I'm glad to have known you.

1002
01:38:18,524 --> 01:38:20,515
Thank you, Captain.
I appreciate that.

1003
01:38:20,593 --> 01:38:21,855
Good luck to you.

1004
01:38:23,396 --> 01:38:24,658
And you too.

1005
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:40,345
Wait a minute, boy. Here, Charlie!
Charlie, come back here.

1006
01:38:49,422 --> 01:38:52,585
Mr. and Mrs. Tideman
would like you to join them.

1007
01:38:59,332 --> 01:39:01,300
Mr. Tideman?

1008
01:39:09,976 --> 01:39:13,275
Welcome back, Mr. Lasky.

1009
01:39:13,346 --> 01:39:17,112
Laurel.
Commander Owens.

1010
01:39:18,251 --> 01:39:20,685
Please,join us.

1011
01:39:24,457 --> 01:39:27,085
We have a lot to talk about.
