<i>Have a nice day.</i>

2
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,844
Mr. Tideman.

3
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:05,498
Mr. Lasky?
AW3 Marty Padanski.

4
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,947
Mr. Lasky? I'm Richard Tideman's
executive assistant.

5
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,251
- Glad to know ya. Are you going with me?
- No.

6
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:46,555
Mr. Tideman just wanted
to see you off.

7
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:49,979
- Is that him in the car?
- Yes.

8
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,086
Well, we've never met.
Can I introduce myself?

9
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:55,255
It isn't necessary,
Mr. Lasky.

10
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,591
As I said,
he came to see you off.

11
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,624
Well, thank him for me.

12
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,957
Take a look, sir.

13
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,966
<i>Arizona</i> Memorial.

14
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,338
<i>She's now resting in 33 feet of water</i>
<i>in an upright position.</i>

15
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:23,991
<i>There were only 289 survivors.</i>

16
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:36,438
Russian trawler.

17
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,149
What's it doing?

18
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:42,491
Not doing
much fishing!

19
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:43,739
I'll take it, sir.

20
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,621
Mr. Lasky, I'm Commander
Dan Thurman, executive officer.

21
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,020
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

22
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,290
Now follow me
to the Bridge.

23
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,846
<i>Stand clear, spot 3.</i>

24
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:57,332
<i>Helo-733, rotating.</i>

25
00:06:57,472 --> 00:07:00,189
- Give me 25 knots of wind over the deck.
- Aye, Captain.

26
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,079
- All ahead full.
- All ahead full, aye.

27
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,145
- Indicate 100 R.P.M.
- Indicate 100 R.P.M. Aye, sir.

28
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,494
Central Bridge,
all ahead full, 100 R.P.M.

29
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,349
- Continue fixed wing recovery.
- Aye, Captain.

30
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:14,495
Let's bring the Kag aboard.

31
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:17,398
Victor-200,
your signal is Charlie.

32
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:20,414
- Set 52, Tomcat.
- Set 52, Tomcat.

33
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,389
<i>T- minus 30 seconds.</i>

34
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:35,161
<i>Tomcat 200.</i>
<i>I'm on approach and lining up.</i>

35
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:37,238
<i>Gear coming down.</i>

36
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:46,845
<i>200, slightly right.</i>

37
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:50,392
<i>Gear down and locked.</i>

38
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:52,917
<i>Add power. Power.</i>

39
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,095
<i>All indicators green.</i>

40
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,759
<i>Hold there.</i>

41
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,182
<i>Hold it. Slightly left.</i>

42
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:04,155
<i>In the groove. Looks good.</i>

43
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,167
<i>In the port, Cat 1. Get below.</i>
<i>We still have aircraft to land.</i>

44
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:56,245
I hear you're on assignment
from Tideman Industries

45
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:57,562
to the Defense Department, right?

46
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,573
- Yeah, that's right.
- What is your job, Mr. Lasky?

47
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,192
- I'm a systems analyst.
- Oh, efficiency expert, right?

48
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,366
Yeah, you could say that.

49
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:16,056
- That's a quick change in the weather.
- Yeah!

50
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,466
Sure is.

51
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,749
- Hi, Kag.
- It's getting a little strange out there, boys.

52
00:09:29,823 --> 00:09:31,994
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Lasky.
- Thank you, Captain.

53
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:35,673
- Are we headed for a squall?
- Not an official one.

54
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,010
Sir, this is Commander Damon,
operations officer.

55
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,935
- How do you do, Mr. Lasky?
- Fine, thank you.

56
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:41,723
And Lieutenant Perry,
officer of the deck.

57
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:43,256
- How do you do, sir?
- Good, sir.

58
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,415
Mr. Lasky is going to be
taking a look

59
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,422
at how we do things
here aboard the <i>Nimitz.</i>

60
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:48,762
- We'll give you whatever help we can, sir.
- Thank you.

61
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:51,837
Our departure
was delayed two days

62
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:55,263
- at the request of your mysterious boss.
- I'm sorry about that, Captain

63
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:57,751
but I'm afraid Mr. Richard Tideman
is as much a mystery to me

64
00:09:58,175 --> 00:10:01,311
- as he is to the rest of the world.
- Two days.

65
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,613
Perhaps the fact that Tideman
helped design and build this ship

66
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:06,268
affords him some
special privileges.

67
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,010
Corporal Kullman will escort you
while you're aboard ship.

68
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,118
- Right this way, sir.
- Oh, Mr. Lasky?

69
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:14,492
I'd be delighted if
you'd join me for dinner.

70
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:17,460
Thank you, Captain.
I'd like that.

71
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,854
Am I mistaken, or was Black Cloud's
forecast this morning

72
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:45,399
- for clear skies and sunshine?
- I'll bet he wishes it wasn't, sir.

73
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,836
Hand me that weather report,
please.

74
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:51,164
Thank you.

75
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:09,368
What do you think it is?

76
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,147
It wasn't there
on the morning run.

77
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:16,311
Check all projection lenses,
and if it's not there, check all receivers.

78
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,325
Aye, aye, sir.

79
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:40,024
The <i>Nimitz.</i> Who's that?

80
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,744
- A Russian trawler.
- What's he want?

81
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,911
A big fish!

82
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:48,503
You've been assigned
Navigator's inport cabin, sir.

83
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,574
Connects with Commander Owens,
our air wing commander.

84
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:55,288
Your luggage has
been delivered, sir.

85
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:57,975
I'll be just outside, sir,
if there's anything you need.

86
00:11:58,143 --> 00:11:59,387
Thank you.

87
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:37,077
Hello?

88
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,780
<i>"Pacific At War,</i>
Commander Richard T. Owens."

89
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:12,765
Very well.

90
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:17,239
We're having communication problems
with the incoming flights.

91
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:20,409
- What do you mean?
- It's interference from the storm, sir.

92
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,413
- Get Black Cloud up here.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:28,571
Sunshine and clear skies.

94
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,681
- Anything else you'd like to see?
- I beg your pardon.

95
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:40,855
What the hell are you
doing in my cabin?

96
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:41,907
I'm terribly sorry.

97
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,055
You're Commander Owens.
I'm Warren Lasky.

98
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,436
They put me next door.

99
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:50,356
Mr. Lasky, the one thing
we cherish aboard a ship is privacy.

100
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,470
Maybe it's because we get
so damn little of it.

101
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:55,193
I understand.
I hope you'll forgive me.

102
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,575
You know, from what I've read,
your manuscript is very good;

103
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:00,725
I mean, really very good.

104
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:03,515
Thank you.
You a historian, Mr. Lasky?

105
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,224
I'm a little bit of everything, I guess.
I work for Tideman Industries.

106
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:09,463
What exactly is your job
aboard this ship?

107
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,902
Very simply, I look at the way
you people do things

108
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:13,309
and if I can think
of any alternatives

109
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:18,429
I write it up and submit a report
to the Department of Defense.

110
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,894
Think you'll find some?

111
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,091
Well, there are always
alternatives, Commander.

112
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:27,284
Mr. Lasky, please don't
look for them in here.

113
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:31,165
Excuse me.

114
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,660
Boss, Kag's here.

115
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:51,069
George, any further word
from Stanton?

116
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,298
We know he's inbound, but we can't
talk to him. His radios are garbled.

117
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:57,781
Just wish he had more experience.

118
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,341
Yes, Captain.
Yes, sir. He's right here.

119
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,900
- Kag?
- Yes, Skipper?

120
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:05,726
- How many planes have you got in the air?
- Just one, sir.

121
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:08,476
- Our newest pilot, Stanton.
- Well, get him aboard as fast as you can.

122
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:11,131
- I want to get out of this weather.
- Right away, Skipper.

123
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:13,532
- He wants him down now. Keep trying.
- Corsair, 412.

124
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,532
Air Ops Primary, try again on 412.
See if you can reach him.

125
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:31,926
Take a look
at the scope, sir.

126
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,933
The water temperature's
down five degrees

127
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,788
and even the barometer's
giving improper readings.

128
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,471
It should be down,
and it's way up.

129
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,204
- What the hell is that?
- It seems to have a cycle, sir.

130
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:49,400
One run it's there,
the next one is clear.

131
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,976
One run it's there, the next one is clear.
I've never seen anything like it.

132
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:56,826
Turn those destroyers around
and head them back to Pearl Harbor.

133
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,642
- No need for them to go through this.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,360
Keep it in the wind till we get
that Corsair aboard.

135
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:03,836
It's one of our new pilots.

136
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:07,000
All units in Romeo Alpha,
this is Kilo Bravo.

137
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:23,422
<i>This is 412. I have an unsafe</i>
<i>hook indicator. Over.</i>

138
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,918
<i>412, roger. Unsafe hook.</i>
<i>Recycle your hook.</i>

139
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:28,468
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>I've tried that.</i>

140
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,738
<i>412,your transmission's poor.</i>
<i>Say your fuel's state.</i>

141
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,741
Captain Boss, that Corsair's in real trouble.
Can't get his tail hook down.

142
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:36,854
- I think we better take him in the barricade.
- Rig it!

143
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,610
Air Ops, tri-flight.
On the flight deck!

144
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:43,255
<i>We have an A-7 Corsair in trouble.</i>
<i>Can't get his hook down.</i>

145
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:48,311
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

146
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,862
<i>Repeat, this is not a drill.</i>
<i>Now rig the barricade!</i>

147
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,056
<i>Bow deck! Bow deck!</i>
<i>This is no drill!</i>

148
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,910
<i>All right! Let's go!</i>

149
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,398
<i>Go on! Let's hustle now!</i>

150
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,181
<i>All personnel</i>
<i>off the deck now!</i>

151
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,114
<i>Barricade coming up.</i>
<i>Clear the area!</i>

152
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:23,190
<i>Clear the flight deck!</i>

153
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:33,622
- Do you see him out there yet?
- Yeah, there he is!

154
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:36,956
Head's up! Green deck,
land aircraft.

155
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:40,217
My God. Look at that.

156
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:18,037
Have Central come up on theJ.A.

157
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:20,926
- Steady as she goes.
- Steady as she goes, aye.

158
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,228
Central Bridge,
pick up theJ.A.

159
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,929
- Aye, sir.
- Where's that plane?

160
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:31,675
I don't see it,
Captain.

161
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,414
Sound general quarters.

162
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,557
- Aye, Captain. Boatswain.
- Boatswain mate. Aye, sir.

163
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:43,604
- Sound general quarters.
- Aye, sir.

164
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:54,588
<i>General quarters,</i>
<i>general quarters.</i>

165
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,661
<i>All hands,</i>
<i>man your battle stations.</i>

166
00:19:56,766 --> 00:20:00,115
<i>Go up and forward on your starboard side,</i>
<i>down and aft on your port side.</i>

167
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:02,491
<i>General quarters,</i>
<i>general quarters.</i>

168
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,788
<i>Time plus two minutes.</i>

169
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:27,997
- What the hell's goin' on?
- General quarters, sir. Come with me.

170
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,028
<i>Time plus three minutes.</i>

171
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,460
Time plus four.

172
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:44,054
Report when all stations
are manned and ready.

173
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:47,484
Got him right there!
Comin' in! A-7 Corsair!

174
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:52,566
Heads up on deck!
He's in bound to the barricade.

175
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,807
<i>Green jackets</i>
<i>to the barricade.</i>

176
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:07,260
We can't hear you.

177
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,806
All right.

178
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:32,795
Crash on deck! Crash on deck!
All personnel respond now!

179
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,544
<i>Let's get out there</i>
<i>and watch for fire!</i>

180
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:41,243
Red shirts, front and center!
Move it, move it!

181
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:45,529
Move it!

182
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:48,345
- Go back to course 350.
- Aye, aye, sir.

183
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:07,124
Okay! Take 'er down!

184
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,125
<i>All personnel on the Flight Deck,</i>
<i>let's turn to.</i>

185
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:18,487
<i>Blue shirts, locks and chains</i>
<i>on the aircraft.</i>

186
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:29,624
Is this the last known position
of our destroyers before the storm?

187
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,278
- Yes, sir, Captain.
- Skipper.

188
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:35,709
Dan, go down and check out
the Threat Board.

189
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:39,799
- Keep me posted.
- Right.

190
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,593
- Get Kag up here.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,831
I want to talk
to CI NPAC Fleet.

192
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:47,414
Captain, we're down across the board.
Antennas check out, but we're off the air.

193
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:49,851
- Any word from our destroyers?
- <i>We aren't getting anything</i>

194
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:52,438
except some code transmissions
in the 200-meter band.

195
00:22:52,574 --> 00:22:55,061
Otherwise, we're dead
as a doornail.

196
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,751
- Ops, what's our radar picture?
- Radar shows us clear, sir.

197
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,668
Clear? Can't you see
that Russian trawler?

198
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,099
I have the signal officer
on deck, but no visual sighting, sir.

199
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,948
Keep me advised.
Navigator, what's our posi?

200
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:09,722
270, Captain.
280 miles west of Pearl Harbor.

201
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:14,261
Oh, Dick. Launch a Hawkeye
to check ship's communications

202
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,846
a Crusader to make a photo run over
Pearl and put two Tomcats on ready alert.

203
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:20,981
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Captain! Captain!

204
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,257
Hey, what happened?

205
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:26,046
Frankly, I don't know.

206
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:29,243
Lieutenant, have the heads
of all departments

207
00:23:29,598 --> 00:23:31,125
meet me at C.V.I.C.
immediately after the launch.

208
00:23:31,262 --> 00:23:32,190
Aye, aye, sir.

209
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,151
- Mr. Lasky, I want you to stay with me.
- Captain's off the Bridge.

210
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:38,715
It's a code.

211
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:40,886
Can you break it,
Chief?

212
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,254
- I think someone's putting us on.
- Why?

213
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:47,353
Because I learned this code
at Great Lakes. It's ancient.

214
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:50,425
Thanks, Chief.

215
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,070
<i>Stand clear at 012.</i>
<i>Hawkeye rotating.</i>

216
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,262
<i>Off the bow, stand clear.</i>

217
00:24:19,262 --> 00:24:22,197
<i>736 lifting for plane guard.</i>

218
00:24:46,174 --> 00:24:47,996
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

219
00:24:48,158 --> 00:24:50,165
- Go hold your own!
- Who said that?

220
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,604
Chrissakes, Chief, all we want to know
is what's going on.

221
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:55,101
- Whatever it is, you'll be told.
- When?

222
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,230
- As soon as the skipper's ready.
- That's what they always say!

223
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:05,302
Hey, Ex-O, what's goin' on?
Attention on deck!

224
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,444
Carry on.

225
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:17,719
Gentlemen, we're at general quarters,
because I don't have any idea what's happened.

226
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:21,182
But I don't exclude
the possibility of war.

227
00:25:21,182 --> 00:25:25,688
- A nuclear strike?
- Possibility.

228
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:29,406
- Now, what action's been taken?
- Well, Skipper

229
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:30,780
there's nothing on the Threat Board

230
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,110
and there's been no
significant damage to the ship.

231
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:36,476
- The crew's in good shape.
- Air wing is intact. First team's ready to go.

232
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:38,995
E-2 is now showing the area clear,
and reconnaissance aircraft

233
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:40,727
should be coming up on Pearl, sir.

234
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:44,599
The reactor is stable.
All readings are normal.

235
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:47,253
Capable for maximum speed,
Captain.

236
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,724
- Lloyd.
- We can transmit and receive

237
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:52,156
- but we haven't been able to reach anybody.
- Why's that?

238
00:25:52,286 --> 00:25:54,588
Tried everybody in the book...
CI NPAC, Joint Chiefs...

239
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:56,377
I even took a crack
at the White House.

240
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,364
Now, we do have some low-band
transmissions...

241
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,217
strictly manual
stuff with very low power.

242
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:02,869
We'll have to do some retuning
to transmit in that range.

243
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:04,467
Get on with it!

244
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,640
- Ops?
- All radar's up, all weapon systems check out.

245
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:13,405
- We're ready, sir.
- Mr. Lasky. You have anything to add?

246
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:15,605
- No, sir, not at this time.
- Skipper.

247
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,612
I have a reconnaissance report
coming in now, sir.

248
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:24,957
Flight level 250.
Camera rolling.

249
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:30,421
<i>There doesn't appear to be any damage.</i>
<i>Seems to be some unusual shipping traffic.</i>

250
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:32,598
<i>I'll make another pass</i>
<i>for a close-up series.</i>

251
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:35,669
- <i>Over.</i>
- E.T.A. to <i>Nimitz,</i> 12 minutes, sir.

252
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:39,123
Skipper, we're picking up some weird
traffic on the A.M. broadcast band

253
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:42,012
on the entertainment circuit,
but the signal strength is very weak.

254
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:46,036
<i>Boss, I told you. I tried and tried,</i>
<i>and I can't get Carmichael to go to sleep.</i>

255
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:48,510
<i>Rochester, that polar bear's</i>
<i>got to go to sleep.</i>

256
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,517
- <i>He's supposed to hibernate.</i>
- Jack Benny?

257
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:53,813
<i>Where is he now?</i>

258
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:56,406
<i>Sittin'up in bed,</i>
<i>readin'</i> Esquire.

259
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,094
Esquire? <i>Well,</i>
<i>take it away from him.</i>

260
00:26:59,262 --> 00:27:03,702
<i>Oh, come now, boss.</i>
<i>He's been around.</i>

261
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,074
Lloyd, tape and monitor
all transmissions.

262
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:09,523
Ops, I want a closer look on all air,
surface and subsurface contacts

263
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,550
within 250 miles
of this ship.

264
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,845
Dick, put some tankers and a medium-sized
strike force on a 30-minute alert.

265
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,054
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Any questions?

266
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:20,949
Skipper, the ship is still at general quarters.
Request permission to go to condition 3.

267
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:25,404
Granted. I'll be on the Bridge.
I want answers.

268
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:28,631
Attention on deck!

269
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,692
<i>Secure from general quarters.</i>
<i>Set condition 3.</i>

270
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,535
- I stand relieved.
- Very well.

271
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:16,150
- Bridge.
- Captain's on the Bridge.

272
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:21,654
Captain, C.I.C. reports a surface contact
bearing 350° at 130 miles.

273
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:25,656
- I want an I.D. on the surface contact.
- Yes, sir.

274
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:27,798
- Launch the ready alert.
- Aye, sir.

275
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:04,148
<i>Which, translated</i>
<i>into world terms</i>

276
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:08,825
<i>means a worldwide reduction</i>
<i>of armaments</i>

277
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:14,075
<i>to such a point</i>
<i>and in such a thorough fashion</i>

278
00:29:14,205 --> 00:29:17,588
<i>that no nation</i>
<i>will be in a position</i>

279
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:20,115
<i>to commit an act</i>
<i>of physical aggression</i>

280
00:29:20,254 --> 00:29:23,702
<i>against any neighbor anywhere</i>

281
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:25,977
<i>in the world.</i>

282
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:27,604
What the hell's the matter with him?

283
00:29:27,774 --> 00:29:30,262
He's asking us to trust our enemies,
and he knows better.

284
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,732
You're absolutely right.

285
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,321
Hey, Laurel,
you finished that very quickly.

286
00:29:43,422 --> 00:29:48,823
Well, I hope so. Let's see,
where were we? Uhh...

287
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,372
"And there"...Oops.
"And therefore"...Ah, here we are.

288
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,681
"So if he does choose
to support my program

289
00:29:54,782 --> 00:29:56,953
let Senator Chapman
be assured now

290
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,421
that I am fully aware
of those qualities in him

291
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:02,291
which recommend him
as cabinet material."

292
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:05,753
I think that says it exactly.
You agree, Arthur?

293
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:09,399
- Miss Scott, you should've been a diplomat.
- I rather thought I was.

294
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:12,468
Well, you certainly cooked up
a compromise that's gonna make your boss

295
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:14,941
the next vice president
of the United States.

296
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,070
I better type this up before you two start
trying to improve on it.

00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:20,540
- Thanks, Laurel.

299
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:27,316
Arthur, will you leave the girl
enough clothes on not to catch cold?

300
00:30:27,454 --> 00:30:28,664
She's too valuable to me.

301
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:30,228
Have you slept with her yet?

302
00:30:30,366 --> 00:30:33,464
What kind of a question is
that to ask a married man?

303
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,435
- You son of a gun!
- Think I better go check what she's doin'.

304
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:39,411
- Oh, sure!
- Arthur, have another drink

305
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:41,661
and stop thinking about how
much everybody else is gettin'.

306
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:44,825
- Thanks!
- See you later.

307
00:30:48,478 --> 00:30:52,308
We swung it, Laurel. How about that?
We really swung it!

308
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:55,797
- Did you tell him you were sleeping with me?
- What?

309
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:58,487
Laurel. I wish I was.

310
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,427
- I'm not gonna lie about it.
- People assume you are anyway.

311
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:05,241
- I'll just have to live with the fact.
- Fact?

312
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,707
Of what they think.

313
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:10,041
You're a strange girl,
Laurel.

314
00:31:10,142 --> 00:31:14,135
You give more back talk and less
cooperation than any girl on Capitol Hill.

315
00:31:14,238 --> 00:31:16,507
I don't know why I put up with
you and your dog.

316
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:18,393
I don't know why
I just don't fire you.

317
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:20,696
Because I'm the best
political assistant you'll find

318
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:23,002
and you're still more interested
in politics than sex.

319
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:25,851
Charlie!

320
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:28,119
What is he barking at?

321
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:33,241
Charlie, what is it?

322
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:38,231
Listen.

323
00:31:58,654 --> 00:32:00,858
They had U.S. markings.

324
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:03,444
- You sure of that?
- I thought so too.

325
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:05,883
Their speed!
Are they ours?

326
00:32:06,014 --> 00:32:09,908
I don't know. But if they are ours,
they've kept them a close secret.

327
00:32:11,678 --> 00:32:15,256
- I want inquiries made as soon as we return.
- Yes, Senator.

328
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:26,036
Bridge.

329
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:30,201
Skipper, the F-14s
are on top of the contact.

330
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:34,200
Alert 1, this is Eagle 1.
What have you got?

331
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:36,668
We've overflown
the craft, sir.

332
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,678
It's a civilian yacht,
flying U.S. flag

333
00:32:39,678 --> 00:32:42,198
about 50 feet in length,
old but in mint condition.

334
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,973
- Over.
- Hold observation position.

335

<i>Cuts with a left to the body.</i>

340
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:16,853
- <i>Brings it up to the head.</i>
- Hey, who's that fighting?

341
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:19,805
- <i>Louis takes another left and a right.</i>
- I don't know.

342
00:33:19,805 --> 00:33:23,449
<i>Louis is staggered by a right to the jaw.</i>
<i>He almost goes down.</i>

<i>Be sharp and listen, mister</i>
<i>How are you fixed for blades</i>

346
00:33:31,997 --> 00:33:35,063
- <i>Do you have plenty?</i>
- <i>How are you fixed for blades</i>

347
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:36,474
<i>You're better off</i>...

348
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:37,980
Let's get some air.

349
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:42,068
Captain's off the Bridge.

350
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:46,323
I don't know.

351
00:33:48,253 --> 00:33:51,831
Dan, what's this all about?
What do you make of it?

352
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,648
Nostalgia broadcasting
on the Armed Forces band.

353
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:57,749
Broadcasting
after a strike? Nah.

354
00:33:57,853 --> 00:34:00,122
Excuse me.

355
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:06,107
Sir, is it possible that this could be
part of some secret naval maneuver?

356
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,604
- Course not.
- There are a few people

357
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:12,857
- who'd like to watch us work under pressure.
- What are you saying, Dan?

358
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,964
The Department of Defense sent
him out here.

359
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,274
Maybe they wanted
to give him something to watch.

360
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:19,740
Now, that makes more sense
than anything else so far.

361
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,798
Now, wait a minute, gentlemen. You may
be the victims of some kind of joke.

362
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:25,363
But whether the Pentagon's
behind it

363
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:27,705
or the Kremlin
or some little green men from Mars

364
00:34:27,806 --> 00:34:30,359
I promise you, I'm as much
in the dark about it as you are.

365
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,046
Captain, we're getting something
you might wanna hear.

366
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:34,741
- In the Plot Room.
- Aye, sir.

367
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,836
<i>The Germans are retreating</i>
<i>on the 70-mile front in southern Russia.</i>

368
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:52,341
<i>However, forces were reported</i>
<i>200 miles from Moscow</i>

369
00:34:52,477 --> 00:34:56,055
<i>and long-range artillery fire</i>
<i>was heard in the suburbs of Moscow.</i>

370
00:34:56,221 --> 00:35:00,116
- <i>Meanwhile in Washington</i>...
- What the hell's going on here?

371
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:01,334
Sir, I think you ought to see

372
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:03,576
these aerial reconnaissance
photographs of Pearl Harbor.

373
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:05,652
- Turn that off!
- Yes, sir.

374
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:07,700
That'll be all.
You.

375
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:20,181
- It's not Pearl Harbor.
- Sure as hell is.

376
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:23,284
Look at that old battle rig.

377
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,798
It's a memorial now.
It's the <i>Arizona.</i>

378
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:33,492
- But she's completely intact.
- That's right.

379
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:37,140
- Get Mr. Lasky back up here.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:43,831
What's the matter
with you?

381
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:48,189
I was just on the Bridge.
They're scared. Real scared.

382
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:52,027
- What happened?
- It's crazy.

383
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,605
The Russians, us,
even the Germans.

384
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:58,392
- We've finally done it.
- Done what, for Christ's sake?

385
00:35:58,558 --> 00:36:03,675
- War. We're at war.
- You always talkin' shit.

386
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:11,318
I want a straight answer

387
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,553
and I don't give a damn about any orders
you've had elsewhere.

388
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:16,563
Is there something
you've held back?

389
00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:19,004
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing, Captain.

390
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:24,697
All right.
I accept that.

391
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:29,369
Here's a photo taken by our reconnaissance
pilots less than an hour ago.

392
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:36,503
- May I suggest something, Captain?
- I'm wide open.

393
00:36:36,669 --> 00:36:39,669
I suggest that you ask Commander Owens
to come up here right away

394
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:42,010
and bring the photos he's using
to illustrate his book.

395
00:36:42,141 --> 00:36:43,385
Why?

396
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:46,813
I think he'll have something
very interesting to show you.

397
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:48,021
All right.

398
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:59,611
<i>Tanker, this is Alert 1. You got</i>
<i>two thirsty Tomcats. Whaddya got?</i>

<i>I've got the hard stuff.</i>
<i>Pull right in.</i>

<i>and clean the windshield. Over.</i>

403
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:26,547
Dick, where'd you get these?

404
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:30,740
I got them from the Smithsonian, sir.
They're old agency photos of Pearl.

405
00:37:30,845 --> 00:37:33,595
- Just like these.
- Not like these.

406
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:36,277
That one was taken
less than an hour ago.

407
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,434
I don't understand, sir.
These are pre-World War II pictures.

408
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:42,613
This is the fleet
that was destroyed.

409
00:37:42,717 --> 00:37:47,256
Sir, C.I.C. reports two bogeys
at low altitude. Distance, 125 miles.

410
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:50,585
- Have our fighters take an I.D. pass.
- Aye, Captain.

411
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:59,094
Have our fighters investigate and
identify the contact 090, signal Buster.

412
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:01,847
Aye, sir. Alert 1,
this is Eagle Control.

413

<i>Tennessee, West Virginia.</i>

418
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:25,884
You're saying

419
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,599
that these are both photographs
of Pearl Harbor

420
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,351
on December 6, 1941?

421
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,357
Yes, sir.

422
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:40,284
Our reconnaissance plane
has just taken pictures

423
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:42,965
of something
that hasn't existed

424
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,653
for over 40 years.

425
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:48,920
Sir, we've got I.D.
on the bogeys.

426
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:53,331
- Captain's on the Bridge.
- What button?

427
00:38:53,437 --> 00:38:55,259
Eleven, sir.

428
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:59,829
Alert 1, this is Eagle 1.
What have you got?

429
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:02,967
- <i>Two Japanese Zeros, sir.</i>
- <i>Two what?</i>

430
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:07,293
<i>Two trophy-class Mitsubishi</i>
<i>A6Ms in original condition</i>

<i>complete with all markings.</i>

432
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:12,217
- <i>I mean, they look brand new, sir.</i>
- Have you been spotted?

433
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:15,130
<i>Negative. We're right</i>
<i>on the side at 6:00 high.</i>

434
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:17,977
Stay in visual contact.
Take no action without clearance.

435
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:20,562
<i>Wilco, Eagle 1. Out.</i>

436
00:39:23,038 --> 00:39:26,071
- Jack Benny and Rochester.
- And newscasts from World War II.

437
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:28,660
Somebody
for some reason

438
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:31,131
wants us to believe
that we're back in 1941.

439
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:33,171
- Now, who wants it?
- The Russians.

440
00:39:33,277 --> 00:39:35,252
- Oh, Dan.
- Maybe. Power of psychology.

441
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:37,267
Excuse me, Captain

442
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:39,829
but we also have to consider
one alternative possibility.

443
00:39:39,965 --> 00:39:41,306
What's that?

444
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:44,186
The possibility that what's
happening here is real.

445
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,811
Geez, that's ridiculous.

446
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:49,146
Maybe, but we have some
pretty strong evidence, sir.

447
00:39:49,277 --> 00:39:51,765
Let's not just write off one
possible explanation for it

448
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:55,130
- because we don't happen to like it.
- How would that be possible?

449
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:57,498
- Could you explain that to me?
- No, sir, I can't.

450
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,964
But all of us know that movement
through time is possible.

451
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:01,522
Einstein proved it.

452
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:03,734
- In theory.
- In theory.

453
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:06,325
So all we have to do is move
through some storm at sea, and bingo...

454
00:40:06,493 --> 00:40:08,664
we're all much more
clever than Einstein.

455
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:12,212
What sort of storm was that, Commander?
Certainly nothing like I've ever seen.

456
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,325
Nothing like any of us
have ever seen.

457
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:16,405
There are forces in the universe

458
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:18,392
which we're only now just
beginning to understand.

459
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:20,829
I mean, understand through science,
not superstition.

460
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:23,699
There are black holes in space,
antimatter, curved space...

461
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:25,273
things that are as strange to us

462
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:27,893
as electricity would have been
to people in the Middle Ages

463
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:31,738
or this ship
in World War II.

464
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:38,326
Well, crew is anxious
for an explanation too.

465
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:43,380
Now, we've gotta get
a clearer picture of all this.

466
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:46,676
Let's go to C.I.C.

467
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:03,453
Hey.

468
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:05,941
- What is it?
- Listen.

469
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:15,349
It's those planes again.

470
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:19,315
No, no.
Different noise entirely.

471
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:21,396
There they are.

472
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,250
- They're not ours, are they?
- No, certainly not.

473
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:46,616
They haveJapanese markings.

474
00:41:58,813 --> 00:42:00,852
They're comin' in again.

475
00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:07,772
Laurel, ask the captain
to radio Hawaii.

476
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,803
Find out aboutJapanese
fighter planes in the area.

477
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:12,884
Yes, Senator.

478
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:25,363
Oh, God! They're shooting!

479
00:42:32,157 --> 00:42:35,060
Oh, my God.

480
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:39,702
- Oh, no.
- The captain send the message?

481
00:42:42,717 --> 00:42:45,173
We've gotta
get off this boat.

482
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:47,316
Come on, Laurel!

483
00:42:49,661 --> 00:42:51,995
<i>Eagle Control,</i>
<i>this is Alert 1.</i>

484
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,645
<i>They just strafed the hell</i>
<i>out of that yacht!</i>

485
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:56,373
Why would they
attack a yacht?

486
00:42:57,213 --> 00:43:00,661
Their job would be to destroy anything
with a radio that could warn Pearl Harbor.

487
00:43:00,797 --> 00:43:04,026
Providing you
and Mr. Einstein are correct.

488
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:09,820
Dick, where would theJapanese fleet be
at this time on December 6, 1941?

489
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:11,704
Well, sir, they'd be off the scope

490
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:14,325
but an educated guess
would be around about here.

491
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:17,810
Excuse me. They'd have to be here,
up around the northwest sector.

492
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:20,573
Let's get this settled once and for all.
Have the E-2 check it out.

493
00:43:20,573 --> 00:43:22,940
I wanna see if theJapanese
task force is out there.

494
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:24,275
Yes, sir.

495
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:27,677
<i>Eagle Control, Alert 1.</i>
<i>They're making another run.</i>

496
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:30,263
<i>Jesus! They'll shoot that</i>
<i>damn yacht to pieces!</i>

497
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:32,477
<i>Request permission</i>
<i>to arm and fire.</i>

498
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:34,582
- For God sakes, Skipper...
- Negative.

499
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:38,422
- Charlie? Charlie!
- No, Laurel! Not now!

500
00:43:38,525 --> 00:43:41,181
Come on! Those planes are coming in!
Come on!

501
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:43,930
Let's go! Come on, Harvey!

502
00:43:58,621 --> 00:44:02,811
<i>Eagle Control, they blew it to bits.</i>
<i>They must've hit the fuel tank!</i>

503
00:44:02,845 --> 00:44:06,107
- Any survivors?
- <i>Stand by.</i>

504
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:10,293
<i>Affirmative.</i>
<i>One, two, three Mae Wests!</i>

505
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,666
Hey, wait a minute!
Those bastards are turning back!

506
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:15,318
They're gonna strafe them in the water!
Request permission to fire.

507
00:44:15,484 --> 00:44:18,749
This is Eagle 1. You are cleared to arm,
but do not fire.

508
00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:21,367
<i>Throw them off,</i>
<i>play with them, but don't fire.</i>

509
00:44:21,885 --> 00:44:23,794
Affirmative.

510
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,907
- Sam! Sam.
- All right. It's all right. I'm all right.

511
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:33,780
Look up!

512
00:44:33,885 --> 00:44:36,470
Oh, no!
They're coming again!

513
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:43,284
Harvey! Get that life preserver off
and dive!

514
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,396
I can't swim!

515
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,889
Here they come!

516
00:45:04,444 --> 00:45:05,459
He's dead.

517
00:45:13,181 --> 00:45:17,109
It's okay. Easy, boy.
Up you go.

518
00:45:28,221 --> 00:45:31,549
Hey, Fox, that woke 'em up!

519
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:34,004
I think we should
give 'em another shot.

520
00:47:12,093 --> 00:47:14,646
Why the hell are we
playing with these guys?

521
00:47:17,373 --> 00:47:19,861
Radar shows enemy planes
heading on course, 220.

522
00:47:19,997 --> 00:47:22,866
- 220.
- SweetJesus.

523
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,209
Skipper, they're headed
straight for us

524
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:28,505
and we've got an armed strike force
just sitting on the deck.

525
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:35,060
Alert 1, this is Eagle 1.
You're cleared to fire.

526
00:47:35,197 --> 00:47:38,906
Splash the Zeros.
I say again, splash the Zeros.

527
00:47:39,068 --> 00:47:43,192
- Yes, sir.
- This has gotta be a dream.

528
00:48:42,478 --> 00:48:44,900
<i>Eagle Control, Alert 1.</i>

529
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:47,459
<i>Splash two. Repeat.</i>

530
00:48:47,598 --> 00:48:49,573
<i>Splash two.</i>

531
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:52,329
<i>Possibly one survivor</i>
<i>in the water.</i>

532
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:55,080
Captain, the E-2
is coming upon Point Charlie.

533
00:48:56,526 --> 00:48:58,533
<i>Eagle Control, we have</i>
<i>multiple radar contacts</i>

534
00:48:58,638 --> 00:49:01,256
<i>picking up on 456 heading.</i>

535
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:04,870
<i>Possible carriers</i>
<i>and 24 escort ships.</i>

536
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:06,948
<i>Southeasterly heading.</i>

537
00:49:07,055 --> 00:49:09,193
<i>Negative radio</i>
<i>or radar emissions.</i>

538
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:11,715
<i>Request instructions.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

539
00:49:11,855 --> 00:49:13,677
That is theJapanese
attack force.

540
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,383
Yeah. I guess
now we know.

541
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:21,740
Look, Dick. Take personal charge
of a rescue team

542
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:24,259
and keep the survivors
isolated.

543
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:26,307
- Crazy situation.
- Yes, sir.

544
00:49:26,415 --> 00:49:28,105
- You know what I want.
- I understand.

545
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,961
Keep the fighters airborne
to cover the rescue.

546
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:30,693
Aye, aye, Skipper.

547
00:49:30,862 --> 00:49:34,178
Now track and report all movements
of theJapanese task force.

548
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:36,140
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Do you still think it's a dream?

549
00:49:36,302 --> 00:49:38,604
It's a nightmare.

550
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:57,899
Let go!
Forget the damn dog!

551
00:51:37,198 --> 00:51:39,369
- Boss, 36.
- Go ahead, 36.

552
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,187
We got two survivors
and now we're waiting to pick up Kag.

553
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,179
- Kag? What the hell is he doing in the water?
- Damned if I know.

554
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,207
Charlie!

555
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,486
You all right,
ma'am?

556
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:12,643
How you feeling, sir?

557
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:16,132
What the hell kind of machine is this thing?
And what's your ship, Commander?

558
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:19,402
It's an aircraft carrier, sir.
I'm Air Wing Commander Richard Owens.

559
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:22,983
- Sam Chapman.
- Senator Samuel Chapman?

560
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,158
That's right.

561
00:52:25,262 --> 00:52:27,401
Sure am glad
you were out here.

562
00:52:30,926 --> 00:52:33,130
Yes, sir.

563
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:08,454
Okay, Senator,
watch yourself.

564
00:53:08,622 --> 00:53:10,564
Watch your head.

565
00:53:11,694 --> 00:53:13,865
- All right, take it easy.
- Hang on to me, sir.

566
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:16,395
You'll be just fine.

567
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,139
It's all right, ma'am.
Go with him.

568
00:53:23,406 --> 00:53:25,381
I'll take the dog,
Commander.

569
00:53:56,686 --> 00:53:58,857
Little bastard.

570
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:20,684
Corporal!

571
00:54:29,774 --> 00:54:32,491
Mind the store, Ray.
I'm going forward.

572
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:41,707
- Holy cow.
- It's the wholeJapanese fleet.

573
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:58,627
Have these things returned
to theJapanese pilot. Get this translated.

574
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:04,327
Captain's on the Bridge.

575
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:15,854
Mr. Lasky.
Gentlemen.

576
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,156
Captain's off the Bridge.

577
00:55:28,622 --> 00:55:30,531
We can't ignore it
any longer.

578
00:55:30,638 --> 00:55:32,972
Every man on this ship knows
that we have radar and visual contact

579
00:55:33,134 --> 00:55:35,436
with a Japanese fleet
approaching Pearl Harbor

580
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,981
on December 6, 1941.

581
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:41,452
- Now, what do we do about it?
- Skipper,

582
00:55:41,582 --> 00:55:44,877
what we do about it
is blow them out of the water.

583
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:48,072
The U.S.S. <i>Nimitz</i> declares war
on theJapanese empire?

584
00:55:48,174 --> 00:55:51,622
That's what we'd be doing. But they haven't
attacked Pearl Harbor yet.

585
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:55,335
The only evidence we have that
they intend to is in the history books.

586
00:55:55,502 --> 00:55:59,146
It opens up some
amazing possibilities.

587
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:02,990
Think of the firepower
of the U.S.S. <i>Nimitz</i> back in 1941.

588
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,292
What kind of possibilities,
Mr. Lasky?

589
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,328
Possibilities for the future,
Mr. Owens.

590
00:56:08,494 --> 00:56:10,949
Think of the history
of the next 40 years.

591
00:56:12,653 --> 00:56:15,141
I have a suspicion history will be a little
more difficult to beat

592
00:56:15,277 --> 00:56:17,317
than you imagine,
Mr. Lasky.

593
00:56:17,422 --> 00:56:20,356
I'm talking about
the classic paradox of time.

594
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:23,495
Imagine, for example, I go back in time
to meet my own grandfather

595
00:56:23,598 --> 00:56:25,932
long before he got married,
before he had children.

596
00:56:26,062 --> 00:56:27,884
We have an argument,
and I kill him.

597
00:56:28,046 --> 00:56:31,592
Now, if that happens,
how am I ever gonna be born?

598
00:56:31,758 --> 00:56:34,030
And if I can never be born,
how can I go back in history

599
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:37,029
and meet
my very own grandfather?

600
00:56:37,326 --> 00:56:40,392
I'm not half the theorist
you are, Mr. Lasky

601
00:56:40,493 --> 00:56:43,276
but I still have a gut instinct
that things only happen once.

602
00:56:43,438 --> 00:56:46,307
And if they have happened, then there's
nothing we can do to change them

603
00:56:46,414 --> 00:56:49,032
- nor should we try.
- How are you gonna avoid it?

604
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:51,783
It's already happening,
and we're already involved.

605
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,692
For Christ's sake, what is this?
Some half-ass Princeton debating society?

606
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:58,188
We are in a war situation.

607
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:00,228
This is a United States
warship

608
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,341
or at least
it used to be.

609
00:57:02,446 --> 00:57:05,348
Or will be.
Or what the hell ever.

610
00:57:05,453 --> 00:57:07,559
Oh, goddamn it, you can
drive yourself crazy

611
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:09,156
trying to think about this stuff.

612
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:11,846
- Jesus, I must be dreaming!
- Now, hold it.

613
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:14,949
All right.
Let's all calm down.

614
00:57:15,053 --> 00:57:19,243
Let's take it one step at a time
and by the book.

615
00:57:19,374 --> 00:57:22,570
If the United States of America
falls under attack

616
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:25,189
our job is to defend her

617
00:57:25,326 --> 00:57:27,530
in the past, present
or future.

618
00:57:27,662 --> 00:57:30,317
- And after that?
- After that, we take our orders

619
00:57:30,317 --> 00:57:33,001
from the commander in chief
of the United States Armed Forces.

620
00:57:34,957 --> 00:57:37,575
Franklin Delano Roosevelt?

621
00:57:55,469 --> 00:57:57,444
- Everything all right here?
- You in command of this ship?

622
00:57:57,901 --> 00:58:01,163
Oh, hardly. No, I'm a doctor.
Ship's commander is Captain Yelland.

623
00:58:01,294 --> 00:58:03,236
I'm sure he'll be down to see you
as soon as possible.

624
00:58:03,342 --> 00:58:05,764
- I certainly hope so.
- Meanwhile, you both seem

625
00:58:05,902 --> 00:58:08,389
- none the worse for your little mishap.
- Mishap?

626
00:58:08,557 --> 00:58:10,346
You call getting a boat shot out
from under you

627
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,812
and three people dead a mishap?

628
00:58:12,942 --> 00:58:15,430
- Are we at war? Is that what happened?
- I'm not in a position to...

629
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:23,843
Am I glad to see you.

630
00:58:25,454 --> 00:58:27,661
Doctor

631
00:58:27,661 --> 00:58:30,182
would you please inform the captain
that Senator Samuel Chapman

632
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,297
cochairman of the Senate
Defense Committee

633
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:33,705
would like to see him at once?

634
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:36,075
Of course, Senator.

635
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:39,525
Doctor, I believe
I said at once.

636
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:42,958
First, a vitamin shot.
Now, if you'll both roll up your sleeves.

637
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:45,446
- Senator.
- No, goddamn it!

638
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:47,944
Now, you can take up
your needles, Doctor

639
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:51,177
and whatever's in them
and get the hell out of here!

640
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:55,652
Corporal?

641
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:07,652
What the hell
are we, prisoners?

642
01:00:01,229 --> 01:00:04,196
Holy shit.

643
01:00:10,893 --> 01:00:13,861
<i>Smoking lamp is lighted</i>
<i>in all authorized spaces.</i>

644
01:00:27,278 --> 01:00:29,100
Son of a...

645
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,779
So, history may be tougher
to beat than I imagined.

646
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:35,397
You're becoming
a real pain in the ass, Lasky.

647
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:38,022
You take an awful lot of risks for someone
who's supposed to be intelligent.

648
01:00:38,158 --> 01:00:42,664
Do I? "The attack on Pearl Harbor
was far from a surprise for many people

649
01:00:42,829 --> 01:00:46,212
among them, the prominent
and ambitious Samuel S. Chapman

650
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:47,469
who had only two weeks before

651
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:50,186
publicly argued for an increase
in our strength in the Pacific.

652
01:00:50,638 --> 01:00:53,093
Ironically, the senator disappeared
and was presumed dead

653
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:55,470
following the attack
he had foreseen so clearly.

654
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,739
Had he lived,
it's very possible

655
01:00:57,902 --> 01:01:02,058
Chapman could have been Roosevelt's
running mate in the 1944 election

656
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:06,343
and upon his death, the next
president of the United States."

657
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:08,934
Now if that doesn't come under
the heading of trying to beat history

658
01:01:09,134 --> 01:01:09,865
I don't know what does.

659
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,234
Lasky, I realized who we had
the moment I heard his name.

660
01:01:12,366 --> 01:01:13,478
Why'd you keep it to yourself?

661
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:15,785
I don't have your appetite
for playing God with the world.

662
01:01:15,886 --> 01:01:18,373
What was I supposed to do,
throw him back in the sea?

663
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,565
At least that would have
preserved

664
01:01:19,565 --> 01:01:21,321
the natural order
of history as you've written it.

665
01:01:21,773 --> 01:01:23,566
Go to hell, Lasky.

666
01:01:23,566 --> 01:01:25,900
Go to hell yourself.
I wanna meet Chapman.

667
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:31,014
Goddamn it.

668
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:33,124
If this wasn't happening to me,
I wouldn't believe it.

669
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,394
- Who the hell are these people?
- The navy.

670
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:39,592
Yeah, the navy, yeah.
But what part of it?

671
01:01:39,694 --> 01:01:42,149
I've never seen machines
like they got onboard this thing.

672
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:44,805
And where have they been
developing aircraft like that?

673
01:01:44,973 --> 01:01:47,973
The navy would have to
appear before my committee

674
01:01:48,078 --> 01:01:50,733
and I've never even heard
a whisper about it.

675
01:01:50,733 --> 01:01:54,628
Rocket planes and that thing
they pulled us out of the sea with.

676
01:01:55,021 --> 01:01:58,567
And naming this ship after Chester Nimitz,
an active-duty admiral.

677
01:01:58,734 --> 01:02:00,556
What the hell's
going on here?

678
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:04,809
Yeah, Roosevelt.
He owns the military.

679
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,048
That's it.

680
01:02:07,149 --> 01:02:08,742
That's exactly who.

681
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:11,592
F.D.R. has wanted the United States
in this war since it started

682
01:02:11,757 --> 01:02:13,318
but he knows there's no way
it's gonna happen

683
01:02:13,486 --> 01:02:14,598
except in response to an attack.

684
01:02:14,702 --> 01:02:17,701
- You always said theJapanese would attack.
- That's right.

685
01:02:17,805 --> 01:02:19,854
And who's sitting out here
with no press

686
01:02:19,854 --> 01:02:22,123
while the White House takes
all the credit for raising the alarm

687
01:02:22,446 --> 01:02:24,999
and being ready
to hit back?

688
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:28,264
- Obviously, we are.
- Goddamn it!

689
01:02:41,901 --> 01:02:43,810
Anything?

690
01:02:43,918 --> 01:02:45,422
Whoever he is,
he's either too scared

691
01:02:45,422 --> 01:02:46,916
or too well briefed
to talk about it.

692
01:02:48,877 --> 01:02:51,146
Excuse me.

693
01:02:54,861 --> 01:02:56,684
All right, Corporal.

694
01:02:56,846 --> 01:03:00,839
Commander, I demand to know
why we're being held prisoners.

695
01:03:01,613 --> 01:03:03,140
Here wait. I got him.

696
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:13,708
Jesus Christ!

697
01:03:13,837 --> 01:03:16,357
No, don't!

698
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:19,562
Oh, my God.

699
01:03:58,157 --> 01:04:00,328
The prisoner has shot one,
maybe two of your men.

700
01:04:00,429 --> 01:04:02,251
Move in!

701
01:04:06,189 --> 01:04:10,248
Captain, prisoner
grabbed a weapon.

702
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:13,132
He shot one of my men,
maybe two.

703
01:04:13,294 --> 01:04:15,715
We're in position.
The area is sealed off.

704
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,893
Stand by.

705
01:04:19,597 --> 01:04:21,932
Get Lieutenant Kajima
up here on the double.

706
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:26,604
Can't we get a translator
down here, for God's sakes?

707
01:04:26,734 --> 01:04:29,733
How the hell do we know what he's saying
if we can't understand him?

708
01:04:29,837 --> 01:04:32,106
We need a translator to tell him
we need a translator.

709
01:04:34,574 --> 01:04:36,963
Maybe that's just what
he's trying to tell us.

710
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:03,466
All right, Dick, Lieutenant Kajima is here.
Put it on the box.

711
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:13,834
Ask him what he wants.

712
01:05:26,669 --> 01:05:29,157
He wants access
to a radio, sir.

713
01:05:29,294 --> 01:05:30,820
Does he say why?

714
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:34,186
Because he wants to
warn his commander

715
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:36,651
about us.

716
01:05:48,173 --> 01:05:50,562
He repeats the demand.

717
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:53,865
- Or else?
- He will kill again.

718
01:05:56,589 --> 01:05:57,996
Do you think there's a chance
they might believe him?

719
01:05:59,437 --> 01:06:03,366
There's no chance if things remain
the way they are.

720
01:06:09,293 --> 01:06:11,116
Tell him we agree.

721
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:53,257
- You son of a...
- No! Don't shoot! Back off!

722
01:06:53,389 --> 01:06:55,364
Don't shoot!

723
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,836
Back off! Back off!
Don't shoot!

724
01:06:57,966 --> 01:07:00,616
What the hell's
going on down there?

725
01:07:10,094 --> 01:07:13,389
He says one more attempt to trick him
and the girl is dead.

726
01:07:13,678 --> 01:07:17,638
There'll be no tricks. He can use
the radio room if he frees the girl.

727
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:31,913
<i>Says he doesn't believe you.</i>

728
01:07:33,901 --> 01:07:36,237
Why don't you tell him
what's going on here, Commander?

729
01:07:36,237 --> 01:07:38,474
You're an expert on what's
gonna happen tomorrow

730
01:07:38,797 --> 01:07:40,301
tell him about it,
for God's sakes.

731
01:07:40,301 --> 01:07:42,887
Go on, tell him!
We got nothing to lose!

732
01:07:45,614 --> 01:07:47,980
Go ahead, tell him.

733
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:54,122
26 November, six carriers
left the Coral Isles north ofJapan.

734
01:08:02,957 --> 01:08:06,786
The carriers were
the <i>Akagi, Kaga, Shokaku</i>

735
01:08:06,893 --> 01:08:09,282
<i>Zuikaku, Hiryu, Soryu.</i>

736
01:08:09,421 --> 01:08:13,927
Tomorrow at dawn,
these carriers will send 353 planes

737
01:08:14,093 --> 01:08:16,679
to attack Pearl Harbor.

738
01:08:16,845 --> 01:08:19,365
How in the hell
do you know all that?

739
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:28,265
Your code is
"Climb Mount Niitaka."

740
01:09:18,509 --> 01:09:20,713
What's going on?

741
01:09:24,013 --> 01:09:27,079
Please, Miss Scott,
don't ask me any questions.

742
01:09:27,181 --> 01:09:29,831
There isn't anything
I can tell you at this time.

743
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:44,035
All right?

744
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:49,673
Where's Charlie?
Where's my dog?

745
01:09:49,805 --> 01:09:53,035
We'll find him,
Miss Scott.

746
01:09:53,165 --> 01:09:55,304
He can't get off
the ship.

747
01:09:57,965 --> 01:10:03,053
<i>Casualties will be moved</i>
<i>down to secondary triage.</i>

748
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:06,500
I wanna get out of this bathrobe
and into some clothes!

749
01:10:06,573 --> 01:10:08,745
Will somebody please get me
some clothes? For God's sakes!

750
01:10:09,069 --> 01:10:12,898
- Chief, get the senator some clothes.
- Yes, sir.

751
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,754
Senator, Matt Yelland,
commanding officer.

752
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:20,390
Where and how did you get
all this information I've been hearing?

753
01:10:20,557 --> 01:10:22,946
- And is it true?
- Yes, sir.

754
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,703
Did you inform
Pearl Harbor Command?

755
01:10:25,741 --> 01:10:28,196
- No, Senator.
- Why the hell not?

756
01:10:31,405 --> 01:10:34,536
Well, the reasons are a little complicated,
but, uh, believe me, Senator

757
01:10:34,861 --> 01:10:38,177
this carrier is capable of handling
any attack should it occur.

758
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,226
One carrier
against a whole fleet?

759
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,156
What kind of an idiot
do you take me for?

760
01:10:42,317 --> 01:10:44,422
- Senator, calm down.
- The hell with you.

761
01:10:44,525 --> 01:10:47,275
Tell Pearl Harbor what's happening here,
or I'll talk to them.

762
01:10:47,437 --> 01:10:49,641
Very well.

763
01:10:49,773 --> 01:10:52,937
Dan, set up the communications
in my inport cabin.

764
01:10:54,893 --> 01:10:58,024
Wouldn't you like to talk to them
with some clothes on?

765
01:11:00,493 --> 01:11:03,941
- Thank you, Captain.
- Follow me, sir.

766
01:11:10,509 --> 01:11:13,640
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir, I'm fine.

767
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:16,077
Can you do that, Captain?

768
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:19,721
Contact Pearl Harbor
back in 1941.

769
01:11:21,709 --> 01:11:23,531
I think so.

770
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:27,206
- Then what do you do?
- One step at a time.

771
01:11:27,373 --> 01:11:30,821
Yeah. Like a minefield.

772
01:11:46,253 --> 01:11:51,109
This is, uh, Senator Samuel S. Chapman
of the United States Senate

773
01:11:51,405 --> 01:11:54,187
onboard
the aircraft carrier <i>Nimitz.</i>

774
01:11:54,349 --> 01:11:56,716
Captain Yelland
is here with me.

775
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,950
- <i>You're on what?</i>
- I repeat.

776
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:02,795
I am Senator Samuel S. Chapman
onboard the U.S.S. <i>Nimitz.</i>

777
01:12:02,957 --> 01:12:05,160
<i>All right,</i>
<i>whoever the hell you are</i>

778
01:12:05,261 --> 01:12:09,222
<i>use of military frequencies</i>
<i>by unauthorized personnel is a felony.</i>

779
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,397
Now just a minute here, sir.

780
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:15,014
<i>As we have no aircraft carrier</i> Nimitz
<i>and no Captain Yelland</i>

781
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:19,239
<i>I suggest, asshole, that you stop</i>
<i>impersonating some other asshole</i>

782
01:12:19,341 --> 01:12:20,551
<i>and get off the air.</i>

783
01:12:20,653 --> 01:12:22,562
<i>You're wasting our time.</i>

784
01:12:22,669 --> 01:12:25,898
How dare you talk to me that way!
Captain, tell him who you are.

785
01:12:26,029 --> 01:12:27,371
Speak to them!

786
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:34,951
You, what are you doing here?
You're a civilian.

787
01:12:35,245 --> 01:12:37,001
Yes, sir, I'm with
the Department of Def...

788
01:12:37,165 --> 01:12:38,506
I mean, the Navy Department.

789
01:12:38,637 --> 01:12:40,644
That's more like it.
What's going on here?

790
01:12:40,749 --> 01:12:43,204
I'm afraid I'm just
an observer here, sir.

791
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:45,479
I couldn't tell you anything more
than you already know.

792
01:12:47,085 --> 01:12:49,540
What's happening here?

793
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:53,829
Who are you people?

794
01:13:02,829 --> 01:13:05,065
- join him in his inport cabin.
- Thank you.

795
01:13:09,644 --> 01:13:11,816
I'll wait outside
while you change.

796
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:16,837
Please, I really don't want to
be left alone right now.

797
01:13:16,941 --> 01:13:19,308
I'll just be a minute.

798
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:27,848
Just exactly what is it you do
for the senator, Miss Scott?

799
01:13:28,013 --> 01:13:31,395
I work for him, Commander.

800
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:33,996
I'd like to think I'm more
than just a secretary.

801
01:13:33,996 --> 01:13:38,088
I write most of his speeches,
and in general, I'm his assistant.

802
01:13:38,509 --> 01:13:40,930
It's quite an accomplishment
for a woman in your day...

803
01:13:41,068 --> 01:13:42,213
this day and age.

804
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:46,146
Let me tell you something.
I'm ambitious and very capable.

805
01:13:46,253 --> 01:13:49,229
That's a combination
that's not much appreciated.

806
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:51,782
It's a man's world.
I'm sure you'll agree.

807
01:13:54,156 --> 01:13:56,131
It certainly is, Miss Scott.

808
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:58,538
I spent a lot of time
trying to hide the way I look

809
01:13:58,669 --> 01:14:01,003
hoping to be recognized
for my ability.

810
01:14:01,132 --> 01:14:04,361
- How's it going so far?
- Well, let me put it this way.

811
01:14:04,493 --> 01:14:08,006
If the way I look gets me in the door,
then God help them when I get through.

812
01:14:08,173 --> 01:14:10,758
You're a remarkable woman,
Miss Scott.

813
01:14:12,717 --> 01:14:14,539
Shall we?

814
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:16,424
Yeah.

815
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:31,364
<i>Enemy fleet bears 042 degrees.</i>

816
01:14:31,469 --> 01:14:33,858
Captain,
they bear 042 degrees

817
01:14:33,997 --> 01:14:37,958
range 182 miles,
course 180, speed 12.

818
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,970
Very well.
Keep me advised.

819
01:14:49,805 --> 01:14:53,318
<i>35 degrees, 17 miles north,</i>
<i>northwest of Pearl.</i>

820
01:14:53,484 --> 01:14:54,979
Laurel, are you all right?

821
01:14:55,117 --> 01:14:57,986
Miss Scott, I'm Matt Yelland,
skipper of this ship.

822
01:14:58,093 --> 01:14:59,554
Thank you for your hospitality,
Captain

823
01:14:59,692 --> 01:15:01,001
but I insist you fly
Miss Scott and myself

824
01:15:01,133 --> 01:15:02,955
to Pearl Harbor immediately.

825
01:15:07,149 --> 01:15:10,597
- Very well. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

826
01:15:10,733 --> 01:15:13,292
Follow this officer. He'll see
that you're fully equipped

827
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:15,627
and then escort you
to the hangar deck.

828
01:15:15,981 --> 01:15:17,290
Thank you, Captain.

829
01:15:19,469 --> 01:15:22,567
- Charlie?
- Forget about the dog. He'll be all right.

830
01:15:22,669 --> 01:15:26,630
Wait a minute, Captain.
I think you're making a big mistake here.

831
01:15:26,732 --> 01:15:31,042
That man mysteriously disappeared
on December 7, 1941. That's today, sir.

832
01:15:31,213 --> 01:15:34,221
Now, at the present time, he
is the front-running candidate

833
01:15:34,221 --> 01:15:37,417
for the vice presidential spot
on the Democratic ticket in 1944.

834
01:15:37,709 --> 01:15:39,235
And if he survives,
he's almost certain

835
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:41,282
to become the president
of the United States

836
01:15:41,389 --> 01:15:43,876
when Roosevelt dies
in April of 1945.

837
01:15:44,012 --> 01:15:48,845
Sir, don't you think he'd be a whole lot
safer to stay on the ship for the time being?

838
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:53,002
Mr. Lasky, my job is to make decisions
here, now

839
01:15:53,389 --> 01:15:55,593
not worry about what politician
may be in the White House

840
01:15:55,724 --> 01:15:58,342
- four years from now or 40 years ago.
- But, sir...

841
01:15:58,508 --> 01:16:01,225
And right now, I don't like
having two civilians on my ship

842
01:16:01,388 --> 01:16:02,665
when I'm about to do battle.

843
01:16:02,796 --> 01:16:05,513
You've got three civilians.

844
01:16:05,676 --> 01:16:07,978
Mr. Lasky, you're free
to go with them if you like.

845
01:16:17,964 --> 01:16:19,874
Dick.

846
01:16:21,485 --> 01:16:25,478
Just got enough time to drop them off
on a deserted spot on this island.

847
01:16:25,773 --> 01:16:27,595
Not Pearl, sir?

848
01:16:27,756 --> 01:16:30,277
Hell, no. They'll be
a whole lot safer there.

849
01:16:30,444 --> 01:16:33,740
We'll equip them
to look after themselves till it's over.

850
01:16:33,868 --> 01:16:36,934
I'll feel a lot easier
with them off my hands.

851
01:16:37,037 --> 01:16:38,946
Yes, sir.

852
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,329
Be sure you're back by 0700.

853
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:47,330
I want my best man
commanding that strike force.

854
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:49,706
Yes, sir.

855
01:16:56,429 --> 01:16:59,363
<i>Now hear this.</i>
<i>Now hear this.</i>

856
01:16:59,469 --> 01:17:01,062
<i>All hands, stand by</i>

857
01:17:01,229 --> 01:17:04,196
<i>for special announcement</i>
<i>from the captain in 15 minutes.</i>

858
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:14,661
What are you doing here,
Mr. Lasky?

859
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:17,316
I wanna go to
Pearl Harbor with you.

860
01:17:23,117 --> 01:17:27,427
Wait a minute.
You're not going to Pearl, are you?

861
01:17:32,109 --> 01:17:33,832
Do they know?

862
01:18:07,564 --> 01:18:12,354
Captain, enemy fleet 170 miles
north, northwest Pearl.

863
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:18,086
<i>The Japanese fleet now bears</i>
<i>055 degrees, 12 miles.</i>

864
01:18:31,756 --> 01:18:32,869
Look at all this ordnance.

865
01:18:32,972 --> 01:18:35,460
Yeah, it's gotta be
the real thing.

866
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:39,718
Watch that wing tip!

867
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:49,644
This is the captain.

868
01:18:49,644 --> 01:18:52,328
I'm speaking to every man
aboard this ship.

869
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:56,001
In the past few hours,
many things have happened

870
01:18:56,141 --> 01:18:58,629
but rumors
of nuclear attacks

871
01:18:58,765 --> 01:19:01,929
and a third world war
are totally untrue.

872
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:05,858
<i>We have no reason to believe</i>
<i>that any aggression has been taken</i>

873
01:19:05,964 --> 01:19:09,128
<i>against our homes</i>
<i>and families.</i>

874
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:13,897
<i>I believe that what we have stumbled</i>
<i>across is not man-made</i>

875
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:17,476
<i>but a phenomena of nature.</i>

876
01:19:17,613 --> 01:19:20,929
<i>One that</i>
<i>can't be explained.</i>

877
01:19:21,068 --> 01:19:24,451
<i>Now, this phenomena is a storm</i>
<i>which the</i> Nimitz <i>went through</i>

878
01:19:24,589 --> 01:19:27,010
<i>less than 18 hours ago.</i>

879
01:19:27,148 --> 01:19:30,764
<i>This storm has had some effect</i>
<i>on time as we know it.</i>

880
01:19:30,764 --> 01:19:36,067
<i>It created a portal,</i>
<i>a door into another era.</i>

881
01:19:37,421 --> 01:19:41,163
<i>Today is December 7, 1941.</i>

882
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:46,700
<i>I'm sure we're all aware</i>
<i>of the significance of this date</i>

883
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,872
<i>and its place in history.</i>

884
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:51,782
<i>We're about to fight a battle</i>
<i>that was lost</i>

885
01:19:51,948 --> 01:19:54,469
<i>before most of you</i>
<i>were born.</i>

886
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:58,664
<i>This time, with God's help</i>

887
01:19:58,893 --> 01:20:00,835
it's going to be different.

888
01:20:01,869 --> 01:20:02,916
Good luck.

889
01:20:57,644 --> 01:21:01,027
Hey, Charlie.

890
01:21:01,164 --> 01:21:04,644
Good boy.
Where you been hiding?

891
01:21:04,812 --> 01:21:07,780
You wanna come with me?
Come on, boy.

892
01:21:14,156 --> 01:21:16,425
<i>Eagle Control, 736.</i>

893
01:21:16,557 --> 01:21:18,826
<i>E. T.A. destination</i>
<i>three minutes.</i>

894
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:05,188
All right, let's move it!

895
01:22:07,724 --> 01:22:09,928
This isn't Pearl Harbor!

896
01:22:10,252 --> 01:22:12,587
Following orders,
Commander?

897
01:22:12,716 --> 01:22:15,105
That's right, Senator.

898
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,242
Is Commander Owens
in the air yet?

899
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:52,418
- <i>No, sir.</i>
- Let me know the moment he's airborne.

900
01:22:52,524 --> 01:22:54,346
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

901
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,369
Why didn't you
go with them?

902
01:22:58,476 --> 01:23:00,483
I wasn't invited.

903
01:23:12,876 --> 01:23:14,818
Skipper,
it's time to go.

904
01:23:14,924 --> 01:23:17,804
Then let's go...
to Pearl Harbor.

905
01:23:17,804 --> 01:23:19,746
You shoot that in here,
we're all going up.

906
01:23:20,012 --> 01:23:23,460
Then you better do what I say.
Take off. Now!

907
01:24:00,748 --> 01:24:02,690
Don't let it go off!

908
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:09,451
- I lost it. I lost the helo!
- What?

909
01:24:09,613 --> 01:24:12,580
I tell you, I lost it.
It just disappeared from the scope.

910
01:24:14,828 --> 01:24:16,519
What the hell do you mean
it just disappeared?

911
01:24:16,685 --> 01:24:17,699
<i>That's it, Captain.</i>

912
01:24:17,804 --> 01:24:20,553
<i>One second it was on the scope,</i>
<i>the next it was gone.</i>

913
01:24:20,716 --> 01:24:21,960
Search party?

914
01:24:24,428 --> 01:24:27,046
It's too late. Officer of the deck,
turn the <i>Nimitz</i> into the wind.

915
01:24:27,212 --> 01:24:29,121
Aye, aye, Captain.

916
01:24:30,284 --> 01:24:32,422
- Launch aircraft.
- Yes, sir, Captain.

917
01:24:32,524 --> 01:24:37,609
That's it. Let's go. Cats, you got
green lights. Get 'em in the air!

918
01:26:51,596 --> 01:26:53,708
<i>Victory 210,</i>
<i>this is Zulu-5-Bravo.</i>

919
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:58,858
<i>Your vector 120.</i>
<i>Estimated time of intercept 0740. Over.</i>

920
01:26:59,212 --> 01:27:03,522
<i>Zulu-5-Bravo,</i>
<i>this is Victory 210.</i>

921
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,416
<i>Nine minutes</i>
<i>to intercept.</i>

922
01:27:07,436 --> 01:27:10,752
Sir, I think
you oughta see this.

923
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:13,129
It suddenly appeared
behind us.

924
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:18,698
I don't believe this.
It's starting again.

925
01:27:20,012 --> 01:27:21,473
Do you think
we can outrun it?

926
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:25,224
Maybe we oughta be asking ourselves
should we even be trying to outrun it.

927
01:27:25,388 --> 01:27:27,657
<i>Six minutes to intercept.</i>

928
01:27:28,524 --> 01:27:30,597
Change course to 180.

929
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:34,083
- All ahead, flank speed.
- Steady course 180.

930
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:37,187
- Come to course 180, aye, sir.
- All ahead flank.

931
01:27:37,292 --> 01:27:40,553
- Indicate 125 R.P.M.
- All ahead flank, indicate 125 R.P.M.

932
01:27:52,652 --> 01:27:55,107
<i>Zulu-5-Bravo,</i>
<i>this is Victory 210.</i>

933
01:27:55,244 --> 01:27:59,368
<i>I have enemy bandits on radar.</i>
<i>Approximately four minutes to intercept.</i>

934
01:27:59,468 --> 01:28:02,631
<i>210, this is Zulu-5-Bravo.</i>
<i>You're cleared to arm.</i>

935
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:12,616
Sir, when we changed course,
the storm changed course.

936
01:28:12,747 --> 01:28:15,464
It's following us
and growing at the same time.

937
01:28:15,627 --> 01:28:18,083
I'm recalling those planes.

938
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:20,587
- Wait a minute, sir. You can't do that.
- What are you talking about?

939
01:28:20,716 --> 01:28:22,540
We've got an incredible
opportunity here.

940
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:25,158
We know where all the mistakes
are gonna be made for the next 40 years

941
01:28:25,612 --> 01:28:27,554
and you've got the power
to correct them.

942
01:28:28,652 --> 01:28:30,757
You stay out of this.

943
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:33,511
Scrub the mission.
Get those planes back.

944
01:28:41,324 --> 01:28:44,488
Your signal is Buster.
I say again, your signal is Buster.

945
01:28:44,588 --> 01:28:47,043
Read you loud and clear.

946
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,285
Strike Force,
this is Strike Leader.

947
01:28:49,388 --> 01:28:52,421
Return to base.
Mission aborted.

948
01:28:52,524 --> 01:28:55,532
Mission aborted?
But we can see 'em?

949
01:28:55,532 --> 01:28:58,183
Shit, they're gonna
let theJaps do it again.

950
01:29:02,988 --> 01:29:05,857
<i>This is the captain.</i>
<i>Now hear this, men.</i>

951
01:29:05,964 --> 01:29:09,127
<i>We've been through it once,</i>
<i>we're going through it again.</i>

952
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,943
<i>Prepare for approaching storm.</i>

953
01:29:30,028 --> 01:29:33,028
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you a special news bulletin.</i>

954
01:29:36,044 --> 01:29:40,833
<i>The enemy bombers appeared</i>
<i>over Pearl Harbor at about 7:55 a.m.</i>

955
01:29:55,692 --> 01:29:58,343
<i>December 7, 1941</i>...

956
01:30:00,236 --> 01:30:03,497
<i>a date which will live</i>
<i>in infamy</i>...

957
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,402
- Any contact with our planes?
- <i>No, sir.</i>

958
01:30:26,508 --> 01:30:29,508
Keep trying.

959
01:30:29,612 --> 01:30:32,329
- Dan, get me a damage report.
- Right, Skipper.

960
01:30:32,492 --> 01:30:34,565
- Get a phone check with all stations.
- Yes, sir.

961
01:30:34,668 --> 01:30:36,610
- You have control of the rudder.
- Bridge has control of the rudder, sir.

962
01:30:36,716 --> 01:30:39,945
- Very well.
- All stations who experienced contact.

963
01:30:47,372 --> 01:30:49,827
There they are!
Lo, on the right!

964
01:31:56,843 --> 01:32:00,706
Stand by to render honors
to port U.S.S. <i>Arizona.</i>

965
01:32:02,828 --> 01:32:04,967
<i>Attention to port.</i>

966
01:32:05,067 --> 01:32:06,409
<i>And salute.</i>

967
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,256
<i>Two. Carry on.</i>

968
01:32:17,868 --> 01:32:20,486
<i>Pacific Fleet arriving.</i>

969
01:32:28,171 --> 01:32:30,211
<i>3rd Fleet arriving.</i>

970
01:32:35,947 --> 01:32:37,955
<i>Carrier Group 8 arriving.</i>

971
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,082
Matt, what the hell's
going on here?

972
01:32:47,244 --> 01:32:48,618
Admiral, I don't know
where to begin.

973
01:32:48,748 --> 01:32:50,820
Aircraft carrier getting lost
in the Pacific Ocean.

974
01:32:50,924 --> 01:32:52,331
What kind of navy is this?

975
01:32:57,612 --> 01:33:00,329
He'll never believe it.

976
01:33:36,108 --> 01:33:38,017
Captain, the admirals
have departed.

977
01:33:38,124 --> 01:33:39,498
Thank you.

978
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:44,748
You seem to have a 40-year-old dog
on your hands.

979
01:33:44,748 --> 01:33:47,137
Yeah, you could say that.

980
01:33:47,468 --> 01:33:50,217
- Good luck, Mr. Lasky.
- Thank you, Mr. Thurman. Good-bye.

981
01:33:53,772 --> 01:33:55,746
You know, in a way, Captain,
I think we're lucky.

982
01:33:55,852 --> 01:33:57,761
How's that?

983
01:33:57,868 --> 01:34:01,031
At least we came back
to the same world we left.

984
01:34:01,164 --> 01:34:03,585
Most of us have.

985
01:34:03,723 --> 01:34:06,626
Did Commander Owens
have any family?

986
01:34:06,732 --> 01:34:08,194
No one.

987
01:34:09,259 --> 01:34:11,942
Lasky, you've been
a pain in the ass.

988
01:34:13,644 --> 01:34:14,888
But I'm glad to have known you.

989
01:34:15,019 --> 01:34:16,841
Thank you, Captain.
I appreciate that.

990
01:34:17,003 --> 01:34:18,181
Good luck to you.

991
01:34:19,691 --> 01:34:20,869
And you too.

992
01:34:32,844 --> 01:34:35,561
Wait a minute, boy. Here, Charlie!
Charlie, come back here.

993
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:47,653
Mr. and Mrs. Tideman
would like you to join them.

994
01:34:54,124 --> 01:34:55,946
Mr. Tideman?

995
01:35:04,364 --> 01:35:07,495
Welcome back, Mr. Lasky.

996
01:35:07,596 --> 01:35:11,109
Laurel.
Commander Owens.

997
01:35:12,267 --> 01:35:14,569
Please, join us.

998
01:35:18,251 --> 01:35:20,707
We have a lot to talk about.
