1
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:38,835
Gone to earth!

2
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:52,195
Foxy?

3
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:15,261
They're out tonight, father.
I heard 'em.

4
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,657
Foxy heard 'em too.

5
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:35,555
You little blessin'...
running away like that.

6
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:42,043
If you're lost, I'm lost.

7
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:45,742
Sit you there.
There's bones for supper.

8
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:51,346
I've gotten some tin cups over
by God's little mountain.

9
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:55,555
Get up!

10
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,803
Maybe the black meet's set
for tonight...

11
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,672
like it says here in my mam's
book.

12
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,355
I never looked back or I'd be
dead by now.

13
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:35,835
But you're not dead, I see.

14
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:42,235
No daughter of mine will stuff
herself with them old wives' tales!

15
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:45,032
You old beast, you!

16
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:55,107
You don't take a needle to that dress,
you'll be motherin' naked within a week!

17
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:56,742
It will not mend.

18
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:59,647
Foxy would like me to get
a new one!

19
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,155
I'll go to Wenlock in the morning.

20
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:18,781
The stew's burned again!

21
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:37,364
Stop yammering!

22
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,332
Play "Harps in Heaven."

23
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:41,672
"The Mountain Ash."

24
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:59,668
Beneath the roots lays
father dear,

25
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,378
So dear

26
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:09,483
She be the tree that grew
from out upon him

27
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
<i>The mountain ash will bring me
luck and treasures many,</i>

28
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:47,504
The Mother Ash is life

29
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:51,548
<i>and
rare as angel's hair</i>

30
00:07:53,392 --> 00:08:02,392
<i>Beneath her shade we shelter
beasts and men all free from care.</i>

31
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,467
Hey, missy!

32
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:38,914
You forgot the old one!

33
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:57,207
Margerine, Mr. James, is just as
good as butter.

34
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:58,987
Butter's made of milk!

35
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,557
But where does milk come from?
From the cows.

36
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:04,035
- And what does the cow eat?
- Buttercups, eh?

37
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:06,053
Vegetation.

38
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,366
Now what...

39
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,675
I say... Hazel !

40
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,635
How do I look, cousin Albert ?

41
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:21,675
Jam!
My word, you're jam, Hazel!

42
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:24,384
I'm going to tea at auntie's now.
I'm fair famished!

43
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:26,875
I can always take ten minutes
for tea time!

44
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:29,179
Are you staying the night,
Hazel?

45
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,995
There's a magic lantern show on tonight.

46
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,555
Maybe your mother won't ask me to stay.

47
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,484
You leave that to me, Hazel!

48
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:42,675
You were saying when we
was interrupted, Albert...

49
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,355
Sorry, Mr. James, what was I saying?

50
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:46,675
Vegetation.

51
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,174
Oh vegetation, yes, now...

52
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,277
Margerine is made from vegetation,
like...

53
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:53,835
well, like butter.

54
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,315
Made by machines, not cows!

55
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:58,795
Just as good. Now let me explain...

56
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:02,129
Butter doesn't need
any explanation, Albert.

57
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:03,795
Good day.

58
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,075
Good day, Mr. James.

59
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,115
I never seen a
magic lantern show, Albert!

60
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:20,521
By gum, Hazel, you're...

61
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:23,475
you're butter!

62
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:25,835
A disgrace the way you look in that
dress!

63
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:27,995
You look like an actress!

64
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:29,800
Do I, Aunt Prowde?

65
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,247
You do.

66
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,315
You quite draw men's eyes.

67
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,915
It's nice to draw men's eyes.
Ain't it, Aunt Prowde?

68
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,634
Jam!

69
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,790
If you go on the way you're going,
you'll get picked up my girl.

70
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:48,795
I'd like to see anyone pick me up!
I'd kick!

71
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:52,309
I don't know about that.
You take after your ma.

72
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,030
I'd be glad.

73
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,505
You ought to be as glad to take after
one parent as another.

74
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,336
Your mother was a gypsy.

75
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:03,973
Some Christian to be born in a caravan
as she were.

76
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:06,035
She was as good a Christian as
some folk!

77
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,804
Are you going back to the store?

78
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,075
Well, see you later, Hazel.

79
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:24,755
You won't see her later cause Hazel must
start now to get back before nightfall.

80
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:26,715
Hazel's staying the night,
mother, surely!

81
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:29,917
She must go back to her father.
We're short a room as it is.

82
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,607
She can have my room.

83
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,475
Hazel cannot have your room.
It's not suitable.

84
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,462
Well... let her share yours, then.

85
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:42,805
Little I thought when your dear father
went, that before three years passed,

86
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:46,401
you'd be so forgetful of my comfort
as to suggest such a thing!

87
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:49,685
As long as I live, my room's mine!

88
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,837
When I'm gone...

89
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:55,152
the sooner the better for you,
no doubt...

90
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:58,984
you can put her in my room,
and yourself, too!

91
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:02,584
See here, that he never will!
I keeps myself to myself!

92
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,035
What the devil are you doing down there?

93
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,575
She would not let me bide the night.

94
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:57,595
My foot's blistered in a balloon...

95
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,235
and there's blood on my new dress.

96
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:12,195
What's your name?

97
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:14,299
Hazel.

98
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,753
Hazel what?

99
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:17,355
Just Hazel.

100
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:21,738
Well mine's Reddin...
Jack Reddin...

101
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,835
and why you're so dark about yours,
I don't know.

102
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:27,189
But up you get anyway.

103
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:41,587
Your arm pulling me in
be like the Sunday school tale

104
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:44,389
of Jesus Christ and Peter
on the wild sea.

105
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:46,280
Me bein' Peter.

106
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:55,925
Vessons!

107
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:13,741
- Young lady's lost her way.
- You'll find it for her, I've no doubt.

108
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:16,789
Get the brood mares in.
They should have been in by this hour.

109
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,529
There, Randler...

110
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:54,819
I cannot bear hound dogs...

111
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:57,100
Nasty snapping things.

112
00:14:57,587 --> 00:14:58,378
What's the matter with you?

113
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,475
You lie down, you fool.
You've seen a girl before.

114
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,876
You hunt poor foxes?

115
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:08,832
So we ought.

116
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,006
Vermin.

117
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,544
You look like a hound dog
when you laugh.

118
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:18,690
And you, you keep away from our Foxy.

119
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:20,595
Who's Foxy?

120
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,635
A little small cub as I took and reared.

121
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,475
You reared her, did you?

122
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:30,819
Aye, she lost her mam.

123
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,355
I'm her mam now.

124
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,368
You like that picture?

125
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:01,739
Or is it the dress you like?

126
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:48,700
If you stayed the night, then you could
wear a new dress every day of the week.

127
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:52,978
If ifs and ands were beans and bacon,
there's few would go with empty bellies!

128
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:07,235
Put it on.

129
00:17:07,547 --> 00:17:10,323
I'll see how Vessons
is getting on with the supper.

130
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:48,275
- She'll do.
- How d'you know you'll do yourself?

131
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,624
I can't stand your manners much
longer, Vessons!

132
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,772
Give me notice, then.

133
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:57,145
Get back to your kitchen.

134
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:00,228
Never shall it be said that a poor
unprotected female

135
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:03,595
- found no friend in Andrew Vessons.
- Oh shut up.

136
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:35,115
Who taught you to sing?

137
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,699
Father.

138
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,035
Who is your father?

139
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,421
Father's wonderful with the music.

140
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:05,641
He wins money prizes.

141
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:08,435
And he plays the chapel weekends
up on God's Little Mountain.

142
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,993
Supper's burnt!

143
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:14,963
How did you do that,
you fool?

144
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,035
I think to the lady teaching me
how to sing.

145
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:19,515
Get out of the stable and stay there.

146
00:19:32,283 --> 00:19:33,515
Can't he stay in the house?

147
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:50,480
Put it on.

148
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:53,340
I'd rather not.

149
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,275
Put it on, m'lady.

150
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,240
I ain't your lady.

151
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,381
Old feller...

152
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:23,430
Where be you?

153
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,621
What, after the older now?

154
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,735
I will not stay alone with him.

155
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:31,393
So he's had his trouble for nothing.

156
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,168
Hazel ?

157
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,142
Alright, sulk. It doesn't hurt me.

158
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:49,242
I never ran after a woman
in my life.

159
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,470
Hungry?

160
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:03,937
You can have my room above the stables
for the night. There's a key to it.

161
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:13,234
Here you be.

162
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,742
- Where will you sleep, Mr. Vessons?
- Never you mind!

163
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:30,995
No woman should ever tell Andrew
Vessons where to sleep.

164
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:35,405
I'll wake you at daybreak.

165
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:42,067
- A mug of beer? I brew it myself.
- If you don't mind, I'd rather tea.

166
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,699
Tea?

167
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:47,722
Lord, how furiously do the women
rage after tea.

168
00:21:48,737 --> 00:21:50,103
Tea it shall be!

169
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:12,811
Come on!

170
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,980
Come on, Mary Ann!

171
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:13,632
Where do you live?

172
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:18,387
You needn't be scared to tell me.
I'm six and sixty.

173
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:22,901
- You'll not tell him?
- Him?

174
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:26,663
Not wild horses shall drag it
from me...

175
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:29,796
nor yet, blood horses!

176
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:33,362
Nor hunters,
nor cart-horses...

177
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:36,509
Nor Suffolk punches.

178
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:38,575
I lived at the Callow.

179
00:23:38,763 --> 00:23:39,784
Callow?

180
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,511
That lost and forgotten place to the
side of God's little mountain?

181
00:23:46,397 --> 00:23:48,399
It isn't lost and forgotten.

182
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:52,301
- We've got bees.
- So have I got bees!

183
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:54,208
And the music.

184
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:58,838
The music? What's a music?
You can't eat a music.

185
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,532
- My dad makes coffins.
- Does he now?

186
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:04,878
Ahh, but you haven't got a swan
made out of a euc tree.

187
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:07,515
Twenty years I've been
a-clippin' it.

188
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:10,014
Only the beak is missing.

189
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:19,955
Never tell him where I live.

190
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:21,534
Never in life!

191
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:26,113
Never tell him...

192
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,755
unless he asks it to you,
and cannot rest.

193
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:31,614
He may ask till doomsday.

194
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:40,592
This is to Undern ?
Never will I...

195
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,075
- Edward ?
- Yes mother?

196
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:25,875
You told me a lady singer
was coming.

197
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:29,600
Yes, that's right. Her father
accompanies her on the harp.

198
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,755
Mr. and Ms. Woodus.

199
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:36,201
Hazel!

200
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:37,932
Come on, girl!

201
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:54,719
Take care!

202
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:21,904
A while since,
before you were born,

203
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:25,635
a cow and a calf fell down
that there place.

204
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:27,531
Hundreds of feet.

205
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:31,125
- Did you save them?
- Psssht -- lord, no.

206
00:26:31,392 --> 00:26:33,049
They was all of a jelly.

207
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,435
Oh, I cannot bear it.
It's a fearsome place.

208
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:38,915
Lord, now what's the matter
with the girl?

209
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:40,805
Naught...

210
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,195
Only it came on me as...

211
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:47,832
- I'll die as well as others.
- You just found that out?

212
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:50,675
What a queen of fools you be!

213
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:55,563
Seems the world's a big spring
trap and us in it.

214
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,635
Hark, to the music!

215
00:27:06,436 --> 00:27:09,385
You're too nesh [susceptible],
that's what you be.

216
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:11,435
Nesh.

217
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:22,797
Good afternoon, Mr. Woodus.
Glad to see you, and you, Miss Woodus.

218
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,749
It's a fine day!

219
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:28,702
We were afraid you weren't
coming.

220
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:40,255
Minister, there's Abel Woodus

221
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:41,806
and his girl now.

222
00:28:01,352 --> 00:28:02,664
"Harps in heaven."

223
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:13,125
Harps in heaven,
play for you,

224
00:28:13,564 --> 00:28:17,827
Played for Christ
with his eyes so blue

225
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:22,482
Played for Peter
and for Paul

226
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:27,810
But never played for me at all

227
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:35,548
Harps in heaven,
made all of glass,

228
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:41,008
Greener than the rainy grass,

229
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:46,395
Played for Peter
and for Paul

230
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:53,239
But never played for me at all

231
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:58,875
Harps in heaven

232
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,755
Play high

233
00:29:01,014 --> 00:29:02,551
Play low

234
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:09,007
In the cold rainy wind I go

235
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:10,315
To find

236
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,435
- My harp...
- Keep time girl!

237
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:16,782
As green as spring

238
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:20,941
My splintered harp

239
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:26,844
without a string

240
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:38,927
This your neck of the woods, my man?*

241
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:41,297
Many of 26 six years,
come Autumn it is.

242
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:46,179
You know a chap around here plays the
fiddle well? With a pretty daughter.

243
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:49,052
Can't say a sight comes to mind.

244
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:00,435
Go on Hazel, have another one.

245
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:03,758
Why not? All the years I've been here
I've
had tartlets, and tartlets I love.

246
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:05,895
I pay the same as others.

247
00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:07,755
They're all gone, Mr. James.

248
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:09,832
I've had no finger in emptying
of 'em.

249
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,135
You sang beautifully,
Miss Woodus.

250
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:13,675
Very beautifully.

251
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:16,801
Have a tartlet,
minister?

252
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:31,147
If he's not fixed on his sermon...

253
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:38,355
I should be very pleased if you'd
come to supper on Sunday.

254
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,355
What will the sweet old lady say?

255
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:43,715
Oh, my mother would be very
pleased too.

256
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,271
And you can tell your father
I should see you at home.

257
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,955
I'm much obliged.

258
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:53,995
Then we shall meet again Sunday.

259
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,199
Thank you.

260
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:03,839
Mother,

261
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:07,073
I've asked Miss Woodus to
supper, on Sunday.

262
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,715
- She is not of your class, Edward.
- What does class matter?

263
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:17,242
Whether it is mistaken kindness, dear,
or silly flirtation,

264
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,720
it can only do you harm
at the congretation.

265
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:21,929
Don't bother with the congregation.

266
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:26,479
People are waiting for you
to say grace, dear.

267
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:33,475
Sisters and brethren,

268
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,675
silence for grace.

269
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,192
For what we have received,

270
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:43,846
may the Lord make us truly
thankful.

271
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:48,911
I have not received tartlets,
I am not thankful.

272
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,395
That little vixen again!

273
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:19,840
Foxy! Get out!

274
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,830
Next time it's the pond
and a spin round in it!

275
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:33,047
- You daren't!
- We'll see if I dare'st!

276
00:32:37,174 --> 00:32:38,730
There, there, Foxy.

277
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:42,995
She's lonesome.

278
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,433
I must take her along with us.

279
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,195
I thought so...

280
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:53,881
Would a terrier do that?
A well-trained terrier?

281
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:55,758
She's a fox.

282
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:59,465
Fox or terriers, I make the laws.
What goes against me gets drowned.

283
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:02,448
It ain't all for you.

284
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,939
The world wasn't made in 7 days
all over Abel Woodus !

285
00:33:09,438 --> 00:33:11,427
Put her in the coffin.

286
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:40,884
You've come back very pert from Wenlock
this time, very pert you are.

287
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:43,235
You're too uppish!

288
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,282
It's time you was married!

289
00:33:45,475 --> 00:33:47,573
If anyone be fool enough
to ask you.

290
00:33:48,312 --> 00:33:50,405
Maybe there's many as would!

291
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:52,961
Maybe I'll marry a fine
gentleman.

292
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,946
It'd be worth it to get away
from the cabin.

293
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:57,385
Well, your house couldn't be
any dirtier than it is now!

294
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:00,984
I swear I'll wed the first that comes,
the very first.

295
00:34:03,015 --> 00:34:04,635
What will you swear by?

296
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:10,486
Will you swear by God's
little mountain?

297
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:16,279
You swear to marry the first who
comes, whoever he be?

298
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:19,629
I swear.

299
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:35,954
Two pints of rough.

300
00:34:54,537 --> 00:34:56,830
Might be the black huntsman himself.

301
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,910
- Hey, lord!
- Come in, sir.

302
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,774
Good evening.

303
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:04,515
- I'll hold your horse. - No, I won't
come in, sherry out here please.

304
00:35:05,078 --> 00:35:07,086
Sarah, a glass of sherry for the
gentleman.

305
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:10,300
Do you know any pretty girl around here,
with black hair, green eyes...

306
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,933
No sir, what women there are around
here are weathered and hardened.

307
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:16,420
Little fiddler chap?
Plays at the parrish meetings.

308
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,181
If it's music you're after, I know
music better than fiddles. That's harp!

309
00:35:20,445 --> 00:35:22,149
Think I look like an angel?

310
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:25,312
A concert, funeral or a wedding,
I'm your man.

311
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:28,633
- Might be the last.
- Weddin' or beddin', eh squire?

312
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,795
He's got the blood of little
foxes on him, Foxy.

313
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,969
Any fiddlers in your parrish,
parson?

314
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:55,169
Yes. There's one the far
side of the mountain.

315
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:59,506
- Pretty daughter?
- No. He's only 20.

316
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:22,474
And I told father I'd marry
the first would come.

317
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,499
I swore it by the mountain.

318
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:30,052
- And eh, nobody came?
- Never a one.

319
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:33,081
Nobody at all?

320
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,239
Never a one.

321
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:46,651
And if anyone came and asked you
to marry him,

322
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:51,501
- you would?
- Well, I'm bound to, seemingly.

323
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,133
But none'll ever come.
What for should they?

324
00:36:58,243 --> 00:37:00,053
Should you like to be married?

325
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:02,221
My mam did not like it.

326
00:37:02,414 --> 00:37:06,304
She said tears and torment, tears
and torment was a married lot.

327
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:09,228
And she said "keep yourself
to yourself,

328
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,122
"You weren't made for marrying
anymore than me.

329
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,044
"Eat in company but sleep alone."
That's what she said, Mr. Marston.

330
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:31,315
And how many brothers and sisters
have you, my dear?

331
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:34,188
Never a one.
Nobody but our Foxy.

332
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:36,054
Edward too has none.

333
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,268
- Give her a chair, my dear.
- I'm well enough as I am.

334
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,094
And who is Foxy?

335
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:50,146
My little cub.

336
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:53,215
You speak as if the animal were
a relation, dear.

337
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:55,635
So all animals be my brothers
and sisters.

338
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:57,605
I know dear, quite right,

339
00:37:57,798 --> 00:38:00,810
all animals in conversation,
should be so.

340
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:04,722
But any single animal, in reality,
is only an animal.

341
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:06,755
And animals have no souls.

342
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:08,357
Yes, they have them.

343
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,736
If they have none, you have none.

344
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:16,475
Perhaps you will read to us, dear.

345
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:22,867
Yes mother.

346
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:27,041
I wonder who that can be
at this hour?

347
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:28,982
Martha will answer it.

348
00:38:33,592 --> 00:38:35,975
Who can it be ridin' late at night,
Mrs. Marston?

349
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,755
Did you hear a horse, my dear?

350
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,316
I don't know...

351
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:45,499
A fiddler chap with a pretty daughter!

352
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:50,673
Mother...

353
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:54,811
I'm sorry to look in so late,
Mrs. Marston,

354
00:38:54,978 --> 00:38:58,629
but I met a gentleman on horseback in
the lane asking all kinds of questions

355
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:01,756
And I had to walk back with him
to the crossroads.

356
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:04,416
You said you wanted something
from Wenlock?

357
00:39:04,817 --> 00:39:06,794
Oh yes, some knitting wool,
the same as before.

358
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:10,435
Edward, Miss Woodus wants
to go home.

359
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:19,943
Were there anybody else there,
at the door?

360
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:28,042
I thought I heard someone.

361
00:40:13,147 --> 00:40:14,671
Will you marry me, Hazel?

362
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:30,659
You've been mighty quick
about it.

363
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,528
Yes, I know I have.

364
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:41,856
It's me!

365
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:44,155
Bide a minute, Mr. Marston.

366
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,843
Here she is.

367
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:14,141
So this is Foxy.

368
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:30,738
Will you marry me, Hazel?

369
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,330
I can give you a good home.

370
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:35,957
And I'll try and be a good husband
to you.

371
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:37,995
And I love you.

372
00:41:39,654 --> 00:41:41,835
Do you love me as much
as I love Foxy?

373
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:44,005
Far more.

374
00:41:52,038 --> 00:41:53,380
Ain't she a dear?

375
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:57,160
Go along now.

376
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,964
- Blast you! I oughtta ring her neck.
- I let her go loose.

377
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,306
- Who's here?
- Edward Marston.

378
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,504
Oh, it's you, minister.

379
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,446
Had a long walk for your trouble?

380
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:29,006
I wanted to see you.

381
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:33,952
Well, here I be.

382
00:42:37,843 --> 00:42:39,316
I want to marry Hazel.

383
00:42:46,556 --> 00:42:48,007
You want her?

384
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:50,023
You want to marry her?

385
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:51,389
Yes.

386
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:03,403
Well, I suppose her is a woman
grown.

387
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,197
You can have her.

388
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:13,912
When do you want her?

389
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,035
Hazel must decide that.

390
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:19,902
Lord, man, tell her what to do,
she'll do it...

391
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,703
you take a stick to her now and again.

392
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:32,532
When will you be my wife, Hazel?

393
00:43:34,898 --> 00:43:36,162
I don't know.

394
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,147
Not for days and days.

395
00:43:38,314 --> 00:43:41,797
Look at her. Throw somethin'
at her man!

396
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:43,517
I think I should prefer
your absence.

397
00:43:43,684 --> 00:43:44,751
Go away!

398
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,727
That's the way to talk to him.

399
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:55,537
What do you say to next August?

400
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:57,524
I'd like it right well.

401
00:43:58,432 --> 00:44:00,050
The Sunday after the county fair.

402
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:03,042
- Dad and me are going.
- Then we'll go together.

403
00:44:03,784 --> 00:44:05,947
My mother would help
to gather things.

404
00:44:06,142 --> 00:44:07,367
What kind of things?

405
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:10,114
Pretty clothes.

406
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,735
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

407
00:44:16,604 --> 00:44:18,397
Thank you kindly, minister.

408
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:19,564
Edward.

409
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,500
It's not lack of belief in Thy
will, Father,

410
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:57,778
but I ask You to marry me now.

411
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:02,527
Because what I want,

412
00:45:04,144 --> 00:45:05,595
is not for myself.

413
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,123
I want to protect her.

414
00:45:10,553 --> 00:45:11,861
To cherish her.

415
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:14,015
In my house...

416
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:17,142
like a flower.

417
00:45:18,947 --> 00:45:20,684
And this I promise

418
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:23,526
that I shall ask nothing of her.

419
00:45:25,073 --> 00:45:26,597
Nothing...

420
00:45:28,086 --> 00:45:30,626
until she wants to be wife to me.

421
00:47:55,325 --> 00:47:57,062
It seems he's run off.

422
00:48:07,445 --> 00:48:08,817
What's wrong, Jack?

423
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:26,792
Well, you've given me a long
enough chase.

424
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,838
Go away Mr. Reddin.

425
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:37,192
What's this I hear about you
and the parson?

426
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,395
- He's going to marry me tomorrow.
- The devil he is.

427
00:48:39,645 --> 00:48:40,807
Who to?

428
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,145
To him!

429
00:48:43,328 --> 00:48:45,435
- What?
- We're going to be wed.

430
00:48:46,734 --> 00:48:48,758
The parson and you?

431
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:50,716
And Foxy's comin' too.

432
00:48:50,883 --> 00:48:53,036
And he's givin' me a box full
of clothes.

433
00:48:53,203 --> 00:48:54,155
So did I.

434
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:56,772
Yours are old ones!

435
00:48:57,984 --> 00:49:00,924
- You've got to come and talk to me
while they're dancing. - I can't.

436
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:03,755
If you don't, I'll tell the parson you
stayed the night at Undern.

437
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,111
And he won't marry you!

438
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:08,246
You wouldn't do that, Mr. Reddin!

439
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,365
Wouldn't I?

440
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:17,915
Is the minister staying for
the dancing?

441
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:21,115
Is your father here?

442
00:49:22,605 --> 00:49:24,988
Well then tell the parson
you're staying with him.

443
00:49:29,765 --> 00:49:32,337
- What went wrong, Mr. Reddin?
- Everything!

444
00:51:04,965 --> 00:51:07,513
I saw you with Mr. Reddin
this afternoon.

445
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,164
I only wanted to say in a sisterly
and Christian spirit

446
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:12,955
he's not a good man.

447
00:51:13,413 --> 00:51:14,873
Well, that's something anyway!

448
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:20,035
If you take my advice,
you'll leave him alone.

449
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,263
I cannot.

450
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,223
Oh, why not?

451
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,789
He will not let me.

452
00:51:52,232 --> 00:51:54,155
Hazel, can't you see that I'm in
love with you?

453
00:51:54,724 --> 00:51:56,113
What for be?

454
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,771
There's you, and there's Edward.

455
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:00,995
Why can't you leave me be?

456
00:52:01,978 --> 00:52:04,315
I never thought I'd come to 40
and be like this.

457
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:06,342
Be 40?

458
00:52:08,445 --> 00:52:10,915
- I suppose the parson's young.
- Him the right age.

459
00:52:11,117 --> 00:52:12,559
I'll show you who's the right age!

460
00:52:12,778 --> 00:52:14,322
Hands off, Mr. Reddin!

461
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:27,065
Now come and dance.

462
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,096
Let's see if a man of 40
can't tie you!

463
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:33,055
What's the good, Mr. Reddin?
I'm promised.

464
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:37,540
Hazel, you do like me, don't you?
Better than the parson.

465
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:41,140
Who's that?

466
00:52:41,307 --> 00:52:42,389
Father.

467
00:52:47,356 --> 00:52:48,715
I want to marry your daughter.

468
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:59,430
First the parson, then the squire. It'll
be the king on his throne next!

469
00:52:59,636 --> 00:53:01,121
Did you hear what I said?

470
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:03,232
She's set.

471
00:53:04,411 --> 00:53:06,593
Set. Bespoke. Let.

472
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:13,822
- She has a right to change her mind.
- A bargain's a bargain.

473
00:53:14,621 --> 00:53:16,484
The cake's made, mister,

474
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:18,676
and so's the bed.

475
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:19,835
50 pounds!

476
00:53:20,495 --> 00:53:22,475
You should go away with a check
in your pocket if she comes with me.

477
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:26,720
50 pounds!

478
00:53:27,098 --> 00:53:29,129
It's all I've got in money cash.

479
00:53:33,021 --> 00:53:35,262
Hey, mister, you didn't need to go
and entice me.

480
00:53:40,002 --> 00:53:41,279
I could have...

481
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,262
I could have the garden lined
with beehives from end to end.

482
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,636
The wood I could buy,
and the white paint.

483
00:53:51,191 --> 00:53:53,184
And queens from foreign parts.

484
00:53:57,483 --> 00:53:59,923
A bargain's a bargain, Hazel.

485
00:54:04,932 --> 00:54:07,210
You may not go with this gentleman.

486
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:12,494
Mind you.

487
00:54:13,094 --> 00:54:15,713
Many's the time in the past
you've gone against me,

488
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,474
against what I've said.

489
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:21,213
Many a time...

490
00:54:38,888 --> 00:54:41,350
I know you don't like hurting things,
Hazel...

491
00:54:41,634 --> 00:54:43,311
you're hurting me.

492
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:45,295
It ain't my fault!

493
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:47,392
I'm always hurtin' things...

494
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:49,391
ain't my fault.

495
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:53,691
Edward will look after me, and Foxy,
and the others.

496
00:54:54,484 --> 00:54:57,369
And you, you've got blood on you,
Mr. Reddin!

497
00:54:57,536 --> 00:55:00,638
Well, I'll even forget the hunting
if you check the parson, I promise!

498
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:02,514
You wouldn't keep it.

499
00:55:02,706 --> 00:55:04,971
Seems I have to go against
you or Edward.

500
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,723
And I cannot go against
Edward.

501
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:09,969
He set store by me...

502
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,537
and I swore by the mountain.

503
00:55:12,704 --> 00:55:13,632
What?

504
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:15,741
If I broke that oath...

505
00:55:15,908 --> 00:55:18,896
my cold sould would wander
about the mountain...

506
00:55:19,063 --> 00:55:21,306
finding never a bit of rest...

507
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,768
and Edward thinkin' it
were the wind.

508
00:55:26,713 --> 00:55:28,472
What was it you swore?

509
00:55:28,803 --> 00:55:30,968
To marry the first that comes.

510
00:55:31,793 --> 00:55:34,354
It wasn't you, Mr. Reddin!
It wasn't you!

511
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:49,392
Bring us back a piece of
wedding cake!

512
00:56:12,879 --> 00:56:15,782
Long live the minister say I!

513
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:28,967
You'll not get another bite
of that apple!

514
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:39,395
The animal has no business
in a place of worship.

515
00:56:39,645 --> 00:56:40,675
What for not?

516
00:56:40,925 --> 00:56:41,835
Because not!

517
00:56:42,047 --> 00:56:43,728
Whoever made you made Foxy.

518
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,262
"Let be other sheep I have which
are not of this fold.

519
00:56:50,682 --> 00:56:52,635
"Them also will I bring."

520
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:14,195
"We are gathered together here to
witness the union of this man

521
00:57:14,445 --> 00:57:16,715
"and this woman in the
sacred covenant of marriage.

522
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:19,032
"To hear their vows,

523
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:22,511
and to seek for them the blessing
of God in whose presence we stand

524
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:27,654
"Therefore it is fit that we bear in
mind that marriage was ordained of God

525
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:32,534
"for the increase of mankind
according to His will..."

526
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:15,336
Mrs. Marston...

527
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,890
Shall I draw the blind, ma'am?

528
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:25,519
Oh let me in.

529
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:12,572
On the profession of thy faith
in Christ,

530
01:01:13,687 --> 01:01:15,145
I baptize thee...

531
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:17,965
in the name of the Father...

532
01:01:18,779 --> 01:01:19,923
and of the Son...

533
01:01:21,446 --> 01:01:23,504
and of the Holy Spirit.

534
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,676
My dear... it was beautiful,
beautiful.

535
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:50,740
One of the nicest baptisms
I ever saw!

536
01:01:51,445 --> 01:01:54,035
Oh, dear... there's always someone.

537
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:56,701
Hazel, you'd better go upstairs,
dear.

538
01:02:06,905 --> 01:02:07,912
Good afternoon.

539
01:02:08,217 --> 01:02:10,445
I'd like to see the minister
May I come in?

540
01:02:10,654 --> 01:02:12,383
Oh yes, yes. Do come in.

541
01:02:13,665 --> 01:02:15,406
Such a hot day...

542
01:02:16,724 --> 01:02:18,593
My son won't be a moment.

543
01:02:19,164 --> 01:02:21,407
Can I get you something
to drink, Mr...?

544
01:02:21,574 --> 01:02:22,652
Reddin.

545
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:24,952
Jack Reddin, of Undern.

546
01:02:25,753 --> 01:02:27,668
If you have a little sherry, perhaps?

547
01:02:27,965 --> 01:02:31,256
I must doubt that we have any of last
Christmas pudding's bottle left...

548
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,982
but I'll go and see.

549
01:02:48,325 --> 01:02:49,355
Hazel?

550
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:02,814
Or shall I come up?

551
01:03:24,837 --> 01:03:26,113
Leave me be.

552
01:03:29,298 --> 01:03:31,025
You don't want me to.

553
01:03:39,937 --> 01:03:43,989
Meet me at "Hunter's Spinny",
next Sunday, same time as now.

554
01:03:45,463 --> 01:03:47,578
<i>Martha, the best glasses...</i>

555
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:49,012
Promise.

556
01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:50,292
Why?

557
01:03:51,317 --> 01:03:53,019
Because I say so.

558
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:05,572
I'm quite put out about that sherry,

559
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:08,768
but here's some sparkling gooseberry
wine.

560
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,837
Four years old last midsummer.

561
01:04:11,058 --> 01:04:14,014
Oh, you've met my daughter-in-law,
Mrs. Edward Marston?

562
01:04:15,401 --> 01:04:16,401
Allow me...

563
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:23,410
Quite up, you see!

564
01:04:25,263 --> 01:04:26,723
Are you alright, Hazel?

565
01:04:26,892 --> 01:04:31,168
Edward, there's a gentleman to see
you, dear. Mr. Reddin of Undern.

566
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:33,071
Ah yes, Mr. Reddin.

567
01:04:33,238 --> 01:04:34,450
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

568
01:04:36,855 --> 01:04:41,075
I saw a bit of your baptism. Very
amusing.
Perhaps I'll come again one day.

569
01:04:42,307 --> 01:04:43,932
You're welcome, Mr. Reddin.

570
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:46,515
The next time, perhaps you'll find
it even more amusing.

571
01:04:46,872 --> 01:04:49,286
The third time,
you'll be singing hymns with us...

572
01:04:49,575 --> 01:04:50,675
and the fourth time... thank
you mother...

573
01:04:52,426 --> 01:04:54,195
I might even be baptizing you.

574
01:04:55,167 --> 01:04:57,155
You seem very sure of yourself,
Parson.

575
01:04:58,059 --> 01:04:59,881
I'm sure of my faith, Squire.

576
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,944
Sorry, Hazel.

577
01:05:39,404 --> 01:05:42,725
- "The Harper's Charm" ?
- It's my mam's book.

578
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:44,495
Hazel, may I...

579
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,507
may I see it?

580
01:05:53,822 --> 01:05:55,637
"When at once, a little at midnight,

581
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:59,947
"climbed to the steepest stones on
the top of God's little mountain.

582
01:06:01,311 --> 01:06:03,957
"Lay your shawl
on the "The Devil's Chair"...

583
01:06:04,765 --> 01:06:06,341
"and walk around it..."

584
01:06:07,907 --> 01:06:10,655
- Finish it?
- That's the other way to the sun.

585
01:06:11,859 --> 01:06:13,448
"Ask your wish.

586
01:06:14,126 --> 01:06:15,956
"And if the undertaking is good,

587
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:20,251
"you will hear the fairy music.

588
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:25,113
"If you hear it, ever so faintly,

589
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:29,867
"you can go to the end of your
undertaking.

590
01:06:30,746 --> 01:06:32,882
"And there'll be no tears in it."

591
01:06:34,728 --> 01:06:38,475
This is a sure charm...
It cannot be broke.

592
01:06:45,037 --> 01:06:48,138
What is this...
"important undertaking" ?

593
01:06:53,755 --> 01:06:55,576
Has it anything to do with me?

594
01:06:59,069 --> 01:07:00,581
Hazel, can't you tell me?

595
01:07:18,078 --> 01:07:21,791
If I was caught in a trap, Eddard,
who'd help me out?

596
01:07:23,823 --> 01:07:24,715
God would.

597
01:07:26,055 --> 01:07:28,090
He didn't let the others out.

598
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:32,059
He does answer prayers, Hazel.

599
01:07:32,801 --> 01:07:35,824
If he did, where would the fox-huntin'
gents be?

600
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,339
And who'd eat rabbit pie?

601
01:07:55,046 --> 01:07:56,506
Hazel, are you really happy here?

602
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,542
Ah... I be.

603
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:06,647
I'd thought...

604
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:09,391
you might...

605
01:08:11,935 --> 01:08:12,915
Father?

606
01:08:14,685 --> 01:08:16,230
You're my father...

607
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,975
and mother both.

608
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:29,988
Goodnight, Hazel.

609
01:10:50,442 --> 01:10:52,898
If I be to go down to
"Hunter's Spinny..."

610
01:10:53,568 --> 01:10:55,047
If I be to go...

611
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,316
let me hear the fairy music.

612
01:14:33,213 --> 01:14:34,740
Mrs. Marston!

613
01:14:59,172 --> 01:15:00,315
Martha, look.

614
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:13,355
Call your master.

615
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:33,135
Mother... Hazel is safe.

616
01:15:37,546 --> 01:15:38,907
Thank you, all of you.

617
01:15:55,173 --> 01:15:56,672
Please excuse me.

618
01:17:28,429 --> 01:17:29,588
Where is she?

619
01:17:32,694 --> 01:17:34,352
You's the one should know.

620
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:39,362
Isn't she here?

621
01:17:40,258 --> 01:17:41,258
Nope.

622
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:43,834
Ain't she on the mountain?

623
01:17:45,137 --> 01:17:46,139
No...

624
01:17:47,021 --> 01:17:48,411
She's gone.

625
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:52,213
Run off, is she?

626
01:17:55,497 --> 01:17:56,642
Have you...

627
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:58,828
have you any idea where she is?

628
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:00,697
- Haven't you?
- Have you!?

629
01:18:03,768 --> 01:18:05,670
No, I don't. I ain't.

630
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:10,784
A bargain's a bargain.
That's what I told her.

631
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:24,388
You married her.
You best find her.

632
01:19:17,701 --> 01:19:19,901
You're up early for a married woman...

633
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:21,835
or whatever you may be, missy.

634
01:19:22,838 --> 01:19:24,027
Haha, you're jealous!

635
01:19:24,209 --> 01:19:26,275
"A Mrs. of Undern?
Never will I!"

636
01:19:30,011 --> 01:19:32,379
Them blackbirds!
Is after my fruit.

637
01:19:32,546 --> 01:19:34,495
I'll kill 'em!
I'll kill 'em dead!

638
01:19:54,763 --> 01:19:57,195
If you shoot a blackbird,
the milk'll turn bloody!

639
01:20:03,344 --> 01:20:04,866
Jack! Jack, come and stop him!

640
01:20:15,045 --> 01:20:16,226
Stop it, Vessons !

641
01:20:18,873 --> 01:20:20,098
Vessons, do you hear?

642
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:28,944
I'd rather it was me
than the blackbirds!

643
01:20:35,715 --> 01:20:37,189
He's got another one.

644
01:20:38,323 --> 01:20:40,950
It's like I've killed 'em
comin' here to Undern.

645
01:20:41,627 --> 01:20:42,787
Nonsense.

646
01:21:13,432 --> 01:21:14,813
Bloody, is it?

647
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:17,533
Well is it?

648
01:21:23,204 --> 01:21:26,214
And now it's notice.
Notice has been given,

649
01:21:26,733 --> 01:21:30,970
One month, by Andrew Vessons
to John Reddin, as friar of Undern!

650
01:21:36,056 --> 01:21:38,792
- You and I can't part, you know that.
- We must!

651
01:21:39,449 --> 01:21:41,675
But why, man?
What's wrong, Andrew?

652
01:21:44,295 --> 01:21:46,002
She mocked me.

653
01:21:46,862 --> 01:21:47,750
Did you, Hazel?

654
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:49,715
- I only said--
- Her said "never will I"!

655
01:21:50,313 --> 01:21:53,315
Ah, that's what her said!
Never will I, that's what I say.

656
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:55,915
What have you been doing to
the old man?

657
01:21:57,685 --> 01:21:59,649
I do know a woman's will.

658
01:22:00,316 --> 01:22:03,555
Maiden I stay
to my dying day.

659
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:10,035
Now look here, man. Be reasonable.
Listen to me.

660
01:22:10,956 --> 01:22:13,536
- I'm your master, aren't I?
- Ah, till a month.

661
01:22:14,885 --> 01:22:16,735
And you take your orders from me.

662
01:22:19,178 --> 01:22:20,507
I'm master here.

663
01:22:24,132 --> 01:22:25,500
So we say no more about it.

664
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:47,339
Notice is took back.

665
01:22:52,182 --> 01:22:53,558
Come back here, Hazel!

666
01:23:14,718 --> 01:23:15,868
Open the door!

667
01:23:37,988 --> 01:23:39,630
Ah, what's the matter?

668
01:23:39,825 --> 01:23:42,065
You want that old feller more
than you want me!

669
01:23:42,232 --> 01:23:43,794
Don't be silly.

670
01:23:44,016 --> 01:23:46,507
He has his uses,
you have yours.

671
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:49,317
If you ain't gonna be civil-spoken,
I'll go.

672
01:23:50,803 --> 01:23:52,251
You can't go.

673
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,426
Shall I tell you why?

674
01:24:04,509 --> 01:24:07,389
- Who cried in "Hunter's Spinny" ?
- No, don't, Hazel...

675
01:24:09,264 --> 01:24:11,209
Who had tears in his eyes?

676
01:24:12,157 --> 01:24:14,034
Who sat there without a breath
in him...

677
01:24:14,994 --> 01:24:17,666
and the tears comin' down his cheeks
like a baby?

678
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:25,148
You do want to stay.

679
01:24:25,369 --> 01:24:27,177
You did want to come with me,
didn't you?

680
01:24:29,094 --> 01:24:30,814
Not till you made me.

681
01:24:33,308 --> 01:24:35,432
But maybe you couldn't help it...

682
01:24:36,013 --> 01:24:37,746
maybe you was drove to it.

683
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:40,385
What by?

684
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:45,684
Something strong, as drives us all.

685
01:24:49,461 --> 01:24:50,461
Hazel, if...

686
01:24:51,091 --> 01:24:54,250
- if I told you that...
- No. Don't say aught.

687
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,314
If you're gonna run words, come from
below your tongue like Eddard can.

688
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:10,131
I wish I had Foxy here.

689
01:25:12,855 --> 01:25:14,543
I'll go get her in the morning.

690
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:17,779
No, let her bide.

691
01:25:19,567 --> 01:25:21,288
She's safe at Eddard's.

692
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:25,482
Tea, Edward.

693
01:26:01,558 --> 01:26:03,808
I know where Hazel is.

694
01:26:07,619 --> 01:26:09,131
You know where she is, Mother?

695
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:14,020
Why didn't you tell me?

696
01:26:14,194 --> 01:26:17,055
I am telling you, dear. It's all over
the town. Most unpleasant.

697
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:20,301
- But I never thought Hazel was
steadfast... - Mother, where is she?

698
01:26:20,754 --> 01:26:23,866
You're all in a fever,
you've had nothing to eat yet.

699
01:26:24,033 --> 01:26:25,776
A little preserves.

700
01:26:27,296 --> 01:26:30,191
Your poor father always said you'd
break that some day and you have.

701
01:26:30,358 --> 01:26:34,349
The best dish. Well, jam, I'll say
nothing about jam, it's jam after all!

702
01:26:34,516 --> 01:26:35,874
Mother! Where is she?

703
01:26:36,122 --> 01:26:38,555
It was much more peaceful without her.
And I wish Mr. Reddin well.

704
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:43,297
Reddin?

705
01:26:43,505 --> 01:26:45,012
Mr. Reddin, of Undern.

706
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:52,235
Where are you going?

707
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:38,495
Listen, Jack...

708
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:42,750
Just like my dad's harp...

709
01:27:43,228 --> 01:27:44,661
I've got a horse and trap outside.

710
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:51,075
I've come to take you home.

711
01:27:52,444 --> 01:27:53,585
Oh Eddard!

712
01:28:07,766 --> 01:28:09,142
Get your things.

713
01:28:10,252 --> 01:28:11,832
What for did you come?

714
01:28:12,884 --> 01:28:14,356
He'll be back any minute.

715
01:28:14,564 --> 01:28:16,805
You're my wife and you're
coming back with me.

716
01:28:22,352 --> 01:28:24,163
Do you want me to drag you out?

717
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:26,971
Or are you coming of your own accord?

718
01:28:27,687 --> 01:28:30,566
You went with him of your own accord,
didn't you? Didn't you?

719
01:28:31,122 --> 01:28:34,773
Uh-huh, but I didn't want to,
I didn't..

720
01:28:35,309 --> 01:28:37,338
How can both be true?

721
01:28:39,601 --> 01:28:41,581
How did he compel you to go?
How?

722
01:28:44,656 --> 01:28:47,277
The signs said to go down
to "Hunter's Spinny."

723
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:49,531
And then...

724
01:28:51,873 --> 01:28:54,700
and then he pulled me on his horse
and brought me here.

725
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:57,127
The signs...

726
01:29:01,372 --> 01:29:03,509
The harper's charm.

727
01:29:04,144 --> 01:29:07,769
And then you went to the end of your
undertaking and there were no tears.

728
01:29:09,296 --> 01:29:10,650
How simple!

729
01:29:14,373 --> 01:29:15,783
How very simple.

730
01:29:18,323 --> 01:29:21,880
Every village I went through this
evening... everybody knew it!

731
01:29:22,515 --> 01:29:25,290
- Everybody except me.
- Oh, leave me be, Eddard.

732
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:27,151
I can't bear it.

733
01:29:27,619 --> 01:29:29,647
You told a good many lies,
didn't you?

734
01:29:31,911 --> 01:29:33,388
Be kind, Eddard.

735
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:38,309
What a fool I was.

736
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:42,066
Well, I'm not particular.

737
01:29:55,196 --> 01:29:56,275
And you're my wife.

738
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,678
She was never your wife.

739
01:30:18,943 --> 01:30:20,793
Go on, get your things.

740
01:30:21,023 --> 01:30:22,687
No use talking, Parson.

741
01:30:26,494 --> 01:30:27,843
She's mine.

742
01:30:31,078 --> 01:30:32,472
From head to foot.

743
01:30:35,514 --> 01:30:36,755
You swine.

744
01:30:38,352 --> 01:30:39,600
Now you're talking.

745
01:30:41,131 --> 01:30:43,893
- If you want to fight come outside.
- Don't lay a finger on him!

746
01:30:44,196 --> 01:30:46,900
Why, is it bad manners to fight
in front of a lady?

747
01:30:47,523 --> 01:30:49,949
Or is the guest beneath
your roof sacred?

748
01:30:50,116 --> 01:30:51,355
And not his wife under his own.

749
01:30:51,605 --> 01:30:54,204
- You want to fight, say so, but don't
preach all night. - Hands off him!

750
01:30:54,395 --> 01:30:56,522
Can't you see she needs a man,
not a short-winded Parson?

751
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,477
She needs a man to hold her,
and not by preaching!

752
01:30:59,675 --> 01:31:02,027
She and the other little vixen.

753
01:31:05,073 --> 01:31:06,153
Let me go!

754
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:09,530
I want to go with Eddard and Foxy !

755
01:31:12,887 --> 01:31:14,893
You don't know what you want.

756
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:20,285
I don't want to see you ever,
Jack Reddin.

757
01:31:20,485 --> 01:31:23,691
You're a cruel beast.
And you got blood on you.

758
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:29,711
Well, go with him then.
See how you like it.

759
01:31:35,465 --> 01:31:36,595
You can have her, Marston.

760
01:31:37,966 --> 01:31:40,129
When I want her, she'll come running.

761
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:46,065
Come, my soul.

762
01:31:52,651 --> 01:31:54,475
Has she ever called you that?

763
01:31:58,143 --> 01:32:01,010
Get out of here, both of you,
before I throw you out.

764
01:32:17,521 --> 01:32:19,293
Will you be three for dinner?

765
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:21,083
Or one?

766
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,994
Get out!

767
01:32:39,942 --> 01:32:42,744
Are you going to bring this woman
back under your roof?

768
01:32:44,365 --> 01:32:48,071
If you bring that woman here,
I will be no mother to you!

769
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:51,965
<i>Eddie...</i>

770
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:53,312
<i>No!</i>

771
01:32:54,648 --> 01:32:57,736
My little lad,
I'm getting old, dear.

772
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:01,497
I haven't many more years.
She has all her lifetime.

773
01:33:02,305 --> 01:33:04,227
You will put me before her...?

774
01:33:33,657 --> 01:33:35,817
When the Mrs. goes, I go.

775
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,801
I kept myself respectable
all these years

776
01:33:38,968 --> 01:33:41,337
and I'll serve no light woman...

777
01:33:41,878 --> 01:33:43,299
Very well, Martha.

778
01:33:43,737 --> 01:33:46,640
... Nor sleep in a house
given over to sin.

779
01:33:49,016 --> 01:33:50,575
You're not going tonight, mother.

780
01:33:52,237 --> 01:33:54,465
I will not stay for one hour

781
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:57,578
under the same roof
as that wicked woman.

782
01:34:00,199 --> 01:34:01,627
What are you staring at?

783
01:34:02,546 --> 01:34:03,967
The world, Mother.

784
01:34:09,795 --> 01:34:12,028
I shall stay the night at the
hunter's arms.

785
01:34:13,088 --> 01:34:15,225
Martha can pack my things tomorrow.

786
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:13,090
Morning.

787
01:35:16,995 --> 01:35:18,561
Good morning, Master.

788
01:36:54,593 --> 01:36:56,326
You wish to speak to us?

789
01:36:58,815 --> 01:37:00,066
To you.

790
01:37:07,794 --> 01:37:08,794
Come in.

791
01:37:20,336 --> 01:37:23,489
This young woman might, I think,
absent herself.

792
01:37:24,607 --> 01:37:26,392
Would you rather stay or go, Hazel?

793
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:28,445
Stay along with you, Eddard.

794
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,934
We've come, minister, six god-fearing
men,

795
01:37:45,248 --> 01:37:47,502
With me, spokesman,
being senior deacon...

796
01:37:47,669 --> 01:37:49,075
Yes, get on with it.

797
01:37:54,217 --> 01:37:58,028
We bring you the Lord's message,
minister. I speak for Him.

798
01:37:59,511 --> 01:38:00,875
You're sure?

799
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:05,787
Has not he answered us each and several
with a loud voice in the night watches?

800
01:38:06,061 --> 01:38:07,875
- Praise the Lord.
- Ay, that be true.

801
01:38:08,171 --> 01:38:10,297
What we are to say is this...

802
01:38:11,721 --> 01:38:13,355
the adulteress must go.

803
01:38:27,718 --> 01:38:30,955
If you don't dismiss this female,
we'll take it to the church meeting.

804
01:38:31,172 --> 01:38:32,997
No need.
We're going.

805
01:38:34,285 --> 01:38:36,115
Oh, don't say that, minister.

806
01:38:38,531 --> 01:38:40,017
Oh yes. I'm giving up the ministry.

807
01:38:40,448 --> 01:38:43,357
If you take this woman with you,
you'll be accursed.

808
01:38:45,038 --> 01:38:47,055
I suppose you know what they're saying?

809
01:38:47,277 --> 01:38:49,577
- Saying?
- That you've made a tidy bit.

810
01:38:51,446 --> 01:38:54,324
Mr. James, the check signed J.
Reddin goin' into your bank, dear me.

811
01:38:56,758 --> 01:39:00,122
Of course, we know it isn't true,
minister.

812
01:39:09,154 --> 01:39:12,178
Don't mind 'em, my soul.

813
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:16,229
Curse you!

814
01:39:17,067 --> 01:39:19,127
Curse you for
tormentin' my Eddard!

815
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,315
It is the best man in all the county.

816
01:39:21,565 --> 01:39:24,355
The best! And you, yourself,
a sinner!

817
01:39:27,112 --> 01:39:28,910
And who are you to judge?

818
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:31,927
How do you know it was Hazel's
fault?

819
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:34,913
It was mine.

820
01:39:36,605 --> 01:39:38,579
I could try and explain...

821
01:39:42,738 --> 01:39:44,165
but not to you!

822
01:39:45,204 --> 01:39:48,867
You think everybody has a price, as you
have, James. Now let me finish.

823
01:39:51,726 --> 01:39:54,428
I'd like to flog you off the mountain,
James.

824
01:39:58,183 --> 01:40:00,272
But you rule this world,

825
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:06,156
little, smug, pompy gods.

826
01:40:06,717 --> 01:40:07,824
Get out!

827
01:40:11,918 --> 01:40:14,029
Please go, all of you.

828
01:40:37,713 --> 01:40:39,049
Foxy... Foxy, darling.

829
01:41:27,874 --> 01:41:28,915
Alright then, let 'em in.

830
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:33,823
Try over there...

831
01:41:44,877 --> 01:41:46,819
Drown 'em out... drown 'em out!

832
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:04,855
You'll find him. You'll find him there.

833
01:43:14,243 --> 01:43:15,807
They're after us, Foxy.

834
01:43:21,324 --> 01:43:23,315
Follow, follow...

835
01:43:39,209 --> 01:43:41,399
Gone away...

836
01:44:29,081 --> 01:44:30,091
Hazel?

837
01:45:00,828 --> 01:45:01,795
My God, it's a girl!

838
01:45:02,165 --> 01:45:04,106
- It's a girl!
- Call 'em off then!

839
01:45:05,444 --> 01:45:07,478
Which way are they headin'?

840
01:45:08,038 --> 01:45:09,563
"Hunter's Spinny"!

841
01:45:12,405 --> 01:45:13,906
Head aloft!

842
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,755
Coming, Hazel!

843
01:45:37,325 --> 01:45:39,212
- They'll pull you down!
- Drop it, they'll pull you down!

844
01:45:43,685 --> 01:45:45,475
Give her to me, you little fool,
give her to me!

845
01:46:08,926 --> 01:46:13,149
Gone to earth!
