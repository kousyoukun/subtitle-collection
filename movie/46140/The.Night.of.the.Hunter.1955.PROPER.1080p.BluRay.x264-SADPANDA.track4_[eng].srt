<i>Oh, now, did you two
make this together?</i>

1229
01:30:36,474 --> 01:30:37,975
You helped us some.

1230
01:30:47,193 --> 01:30:51,239
That's the richest gift
a body could have.

1231
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:54,951
And your presents are in the cupboard
under the china closet.

Oh, look what you've got!</i>

1237
01:31:18,099 --> 01:31:20,852
Lord save little children.

1238
01:31:20,935 --> 01:31:24,647
You'd think the world would be ashamed to
name such a day as Christmas for one of them...

1239
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:27,108
and then go on in the same old way.

1240
01:31:28,401 --> 01:31:32,905
My soul is humble when I see the way
little ones accept their lot.

That watch sure is a fine loud ticker.

1246
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:18,117
Be nice to have someone around the house
who can give me the right time of day.

1247
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:22,663
This watch
is the nicest watch I ever had.

1248
01:32:22,747 --> 01:32:26,417
Well, a fella just can't go round
with rundown, busted watches.

They abide, and they endure.
