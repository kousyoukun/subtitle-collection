1
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,487
Now, you remember, children,
how I told you

2
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:06,072
about the good Lord going up into the
mountain and talking to the people?

3
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:10,541
And how he said: "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God"?

4
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:13,746
And howhe said
that King Solomon in all his glory

5
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:16,923
was not as beautiful as
the lilies of the field?

6
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,674
And I know you won't forget
"Judge not lest ye be judged",

7
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,880
because I explained that to you.

8
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:25,298
And then the good Lord went on to say:

9
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:29,012
"Beware of false prophets

10
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:32,179
which come to you in sheep's clothing

11
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:35,229
but inwardly they are ravening wolves."

12
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:38,435
"Ye shall know them by their fruits."

13
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,149
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,

14
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,651
45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,

15
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:47,037
75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100!

16
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:49,282
Here I come, ready or not.

17
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:53,161
What's wrong?

18
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,928
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,

19
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:12,270
neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit."

20
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:16,267
"Wherefore by their fruits
ye shall know them."

21
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,565
Well now, what's it to be, Lord?

22
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:24,151
Another widow?

23
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,612
How many's it been? Six?

24
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,365
Twelve?

25
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,909
I disremember.

26
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:37,622
You say the word, Lord. I'm on my way.

27
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,015
You always send me money
to go forth and preach your word.

28
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:55,639
A widow with a little wad of bills
hid away in the sugar bowl.

29
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:08,571
Lord, I am tired.

30
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,828
Sometimes I wonder
if you really understand.

31
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,870
Not that you mind the killings.
Your book is full of killings.

32
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,251
But there are things you do hate, Lord.

33
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,421
Perfume-smelling things.

34
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,257
Lacy things. Things with curly hair.

35
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,388
There are too many of them.

36
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,766
You can't kill a world.

37
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,735
You driving a touring car
with a Moundsville licence?

38
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,395
Harry Powell,
for the theft of that touring car

39
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,610
you'll spend 30 days
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

40
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:31,831
Preacher Harry Powell.
A car thief. Picked up where you were.

41
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,577
A man of God? Harry Powell...

42
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,186
Hold Miss Jenny still.

43
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,354
Stand still, Miss Jenny.

44
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,774
There. What's so hard about that?

45
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,866
Daddy!

46
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:21,580
Where's your mom?
Out shopping.

47
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,248
You're bleeding, Dad.

48
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:28,170
Listen. We have to hide this money before
they get to me. There's close to $10,000.

49
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:31,219
Where? Under a rock
in the smokehouse? No, no.

50
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:35,812
Under the bricks in the grape arbour.
No, no. They'd dig for it.

51
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,265
Sure. That's the place.

52
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:46,815
That's him.
He probably still has that gun.

53
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:50,534
Listen to me, son. You've got to swear.
Swear means promise.

54
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,871
First swear you'll take care of little Pearl.
Guard her with your life, boy.

55
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:56,661
Then swear you won't never tell where
the money's hid. Not even your mom.

56
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:58,127
Yes, Dad.
You understand?

57
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:00,963
Not even her?
You've got common sense, she ain't.

58
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:03,087
When you grow up
that money'll belong to you.

59
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:05,926
Now stand up straight.
Raise your right hand.

60
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:10,423
Now swear. I'll guard Pearl with my life.
I will guard Pearl with my life.

61
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:15,641
And I won't never tell about the money.
And I won't never tell about the money.

62
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:18,014
You, Pearl. You swear too.

63
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:23,228
Ben Harper.

64
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:26,323
I'm going now, children. Goodbye.

65
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,695
Drop that gun, Harper.
We don't want the kids hurt.

66
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:31,406
Just mind what you swore, son.
Mind, boy.

67
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,034
Don't.

68
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:39,494
Don't!

69
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,998
Dad.

70
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:06,065
Ben Harper, it is the sentence of this court

71
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:09,652
that for the murder of Ed Smiley
and Corey South

72
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:12,530
you be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

73
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:14,822
May God have mercy on your soul.

74
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:26,167
I got you all buffaloed.

75
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:29,715
You ain't none of you
gonna get it out of me.

76
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,298
Where, Ben? Where?

77
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:35,098
Where?

78
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:37,427
And a little child shall lead them.

79
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:40,140
Come on, boy. Tell me.

80
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:47,028
Ben! I'm a man of God.

81
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:50,150
Making me talk about it in my sleep.
No, Ben. No.

82
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:52,319
What did I say?

83
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:54,237
You was quoting the scripture, Ben.

84
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,284
You said
"And a little child shall lead them."

85
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:07,292
You killed two men, Ben Harper.

86
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:10,006
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank

87
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:15,434
cos I got tired of seeing children
roaming the woodlands without food.

88
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,053
Children roaming the highways
in this year of Depression.

89
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,724
Children sleeping in old abandoned
car bodies on junk heaps.

90
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:27,187
I promised myself I'd never see
the day when my young 'uns would want.

91
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,605
With that $10,000
I could build a tabernacle

92
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:33,068
and make that Wheeling Island tabernacle
look like a chicken house.

93
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:35,402
Would you have free candy for the kids?

94
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:38,616
Think of it, Ben.
With that cursed, bloody gold.

95
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,543
How come you got that stickknife
hid up in your blankets, Preacher?

96
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:46,329
The Lord blinded mine enemies when
they brought me in this evil place.

97
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:49,840
I smuggled it in right under
the noses of them guards.

98
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,047
"I come not with peace,

99
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:55,840
but with a sword."
You, Preacher?

100
00:09:57,102 --> 00:10:01,051
The sword has served me through
many an evil time, Ben Harper.

101
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,357
What religion do you profess, Preacher?

102
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:11,574
The religion the Almighty and me
worked out betwixt us.

103
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:14,152
I'll bet!

104
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:19,159
Salvation is a lastminute business, boy.

105
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,623
Keep talking, Preacher.

106
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:23,750
If you let that money serve the Lord,

107
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:26,673
he might feel kindly towards you.
Keep talking.

108
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:31,051
Now, don't you think the Lord might
change his mind if you was to...

109
00:10:41,314 --> 00:10:46,141
Lord, you sure knowed
what you was doing

110
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:49,860
when you put me
in this very cell at this very time.

111
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:57,571
A man with $10,000 hid somewhere
and a widow in the making.

112
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,967
Any trouble?
No.

113
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,346
He was a cool one, that Harper.
Never broke.

114
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,511
Carried on some. Kicked.

115
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,979
They say he left a wife and two kids.
I never heard.

116
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,732
He never told about the money?
No.

117
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,979
What do you figure he done with it?

118
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:34,152
He took the secret with him
when I dropped him.

119
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,404
That you, Bart? Supper's waiting.

120
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:58,181
Mother, sometimes I think it might be
better if I was to quit my job as guard.

121
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:03,012
You're always this way when there's a
hanging. You never have to be there.

122
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,396
Sometimes I wish I was back in the mine.

123
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:10,854
And leave me a widow after
another blast like the one in '24?

124
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:13,023
Not on your life, old mister.

125
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:33,718
& Hing, hang, hung

126
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:36,295
& See what the hangman done

127
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,595
& See what the hangman done

128
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:44,680
& Hung, hang, hing

129
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:46,812
& See the robber swing

130
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,148
& Hing, hang, hung

131
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,315
& Now my song is done

132
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:18,963
Are you going to buy it, John?

133
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:23,426
So your mommy's
keeping you out of school.

134
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,931
How is your poor, poor mother?

135
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,438
She's at Spoon's icecream parlour.

136
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:34,196
Did they ever find out what your father
done with all that money he stole?

137
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:37,859
Pearl and me, we have to go.

138
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,456
You'd better not sing that song.
Why?

139
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,620
Cos you're too little.

140
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:52,881
Can we get some candy?

141
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:56,211
No.

142
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:02,267
Willa Harper, there are certain
plain facts of life that adds up

143
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:05,352
just like two plus two makes four,
and one of them is this.

144
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:08,309
No woman is able to raise
growing youngsters alone.

145
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,394
The Lord meant that job for two.
Icey, I just don't want a husband.

146
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,331
T'ain't a question of wanting
or not wanting.

147
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,910
You've got two little young 'uns.

148
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:28,871
It's a man you need in the house,
Willa Harper.

149
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,260
Tell me a story, John.

150
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:49,101
Well, once upon a time...

151
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:54,692
there was a rich king
who had himself a son and a daughter.

152
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:59,612
They all lived in a castle over in Africa.

153
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:08,119
Then one day this king
got taken away by some bad men.

154
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:14,998
Before he got took off he told his son to
kill anyone who tried to steal his gold.

155
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:19,589
And before long,
the bad men came back and...

156
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:41,735
Just a man.

157
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:45,743
Good night, Pearl.
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.

158
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:48,868
Night, Miss Jenny.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

159
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:49,469
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing
no more but she still blows as she passes.

160
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:55,893
Come on in and have a cup of coffee, boy.

161
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:58,313
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.

162
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,868
Ain't nobody going to neither,
as long as Uncle Birdie's round.

163
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:10,036
First day my joints is limber enough I'll
haul her out and give her a good caulking.

164
00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:15,245
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, boy.
I've been minding Pearl.

165
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,381
Ain't it a caution what a woman'll load
onto a man's back when he ain't looking?

166
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:36,521
Excuse me, Cap, while l...
sweeten my coffee.

167
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,952
Dead and gone these twenty-five year
and never takes her eyes off me.

168
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:58,793
Man of my years needs a little snort
in the morning to heat the boilers.

169
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:01,176
Yeah.

170
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:06,089
I was talking to this stranger up at
the boarding house. He knowed your dad.

171
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,513
Where'd he know Dad?
I'll not hide it.

172
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:11,390
He knowed him
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

173
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:15,525
I've got to go now, Uncle Birdie.
Why, you just got here, boy.

174
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:20,566
I told Mom I'd be back
to Spoon's for Pearl.

175
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,053
God works in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform.

176
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,016
Yes, I was with Brother Harper
right up to the end.

177
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:52,762
Now that I'm no longer employed by
the penitentiary

178
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,560
it is my joy to bring this
small comfort to his loved ones.

179
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:58,189
It's a mighty good man
would go out of his way

180
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:01,065
to bring a word of cheer
to a grieving widow.

181
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,316
So you ain't with the state no more?

182
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,448
No, brother, I resigned only yesterday.

183
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:10,032
The heartrending spectacle of them
poor men was just too much for me.

184
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:12,865
Ah, little lad,
you're staring at my fingers.

185
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,874
Would you like me to tell you the little
story of Righthand, Lefthand?

186
00:19:16,964 --> 00:19:19,040
The story of good and evil.

187
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,917
H-ATE.

188
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:23,386
It was with this left hand

189
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:26,886
that old Brother Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

190
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:29,050
LO-VE.

191
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,972
See these fingers, dear hearts? They has
veins that run straight to the soul of man.

192
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:36,769
The right hand, friends.
The hand of love.

193
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:39,772
Now watch and
I'll show you the story of life.

194
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:43,776
These fingers is always a-warring and
a-tugging, one agin t'other.

195
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,194
Now watch 'em.

196
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,196
Old Brother Lefthand.

197
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,198
Lefthand hates a-fighting.

198
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,367
And it looks like Love's a goner.

199
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:55,828
But wait a minute!

200
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,253
Hot dog! Love's a?winning.

201
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:03,006
Yes, sirree. It's Love that won.

202
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:06,423
And old Lefthand Hate
is down for the count.

203
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10,759
I never heard it better told.

204
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:15,601
I wish every soul in this community
could get the benefit.

205
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,735
You've just got to stay
for our picnic Sunday.

206
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,070
No, I must wend my way downriver
on the Lord's business.

207
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,778
You ain't leaving in no hurry
if we can help it.

208
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:27,741
John, mind your manners!

209
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:30,319
Take that look off your face. Act nice.

210
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:33,244
He don't mean no impudence,
do you, boy?

211
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,993
Do you, boy?

212
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:39,461
Many's the time poor Brother Ben
told me about these young 'uns.

213
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:40,958
What did he tell you?

214
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,668
He told me what fine little lambs
you and your sister both was.

215
00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:46,422
Is that all?

216
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:49,550
Why, no, boy.
He told me lots and lots of things.

217
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:52,552
Nice things, boy.
Thank you.

218
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:59,020
My, that fudge smells yummy.

219
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,067
It's for the picnic.

220
00:21:01,154 --> 00:21:06,029
And you don't get a smidgen of my fudge
unless you stayfor the picnic.

221
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:53,325
Don't he have the grandest singing voice?

222
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:56,036
John! Pearl!
Run along and play, you two.

223
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:59,039
Where?
Down by the river. My goodness!

224
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,417
That fella's aching to settle down with
some nice woman and make a home.

225
00:22:05,844 --> 00:22:08,417
Icey, it's awful soon after Ben's passing.

226
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:10,672
If ever I saw a sign from heaven...

227
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:14,803
John don't like him much.
Pearl dotes on him.

228
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:17,179
The boy worries me.

229
00:22:17,273 --> 00:22:21,140
I know it's silly, but it's like there's
something still between him and his dad.

230
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:23,311
What he needs is a dose of salts.

231
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:26,270
Oh, there's something else.
What?

232
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:27,856
The money.

233
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:32,243
I declare, Willa Harper, you'll let
that money haunt you to your grave.

234
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,073
Icey, I would love to be satisfied

235
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:37,035
that Harry Powell don't think
I got that money hid somewhere.

236
00:22:37,126 --> 00:22:39,747
You come right out
and ask that man of God.

237
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:44,418
Mr Powell! Clear that evil mud
out of your soul.

238
00:22:44,676 --> 00:22:48,460
John! Pearl!
Come along here and get some fudge.

239
00:22:48,555 --> 00:22:51,176
I don't want no fudge.
You do what you're told!

240
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:53,092
You go set down by the river.

241
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,971
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight.
Get along with you!

242
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:03,644
You...!

243
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:10,487
That young lady better look sharp or
some smart sister is gonna snap him up.

244
00:23:10,577 --> 00:23:12,653
She's not the only fish in the river!

245
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:15,865
Now you two stay put.
Shillyshallying around.

246
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,158
A husband's one piece of store goods
you never know

247
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,706
till you get it home and take the paper off.

248
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:25,837
Did Ben Harper ever tell you what
he done with the money he stole?

249
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:28,002
My dear child, don't you know?

250
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:32,048
She's mooning about Ben Harper.

251
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:36,845
That wasn't love. That was just
flapdoodle. Have some fudge, lambs.

252
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:38,728
When you've been married
to a man 40 years,

253
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:41,684
you know all that
don't amount to a hill of beans.

254
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:45,642
I've been married to my Walt that long
and I swear, in all that time,

255
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:48,525
I just lie there thinking about my canning.

256
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:53,987
John!

257
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:08,881
A woman's a fool to marry for that.
That's something for a man.

258
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,881
The good Lord never meant for a decent
woman to want that. Not really want it.

259
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:16,467
It's all just a fake and a pipe dream.

260
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:21,855
John, Mr Powell has something to tell you.

261
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,608
Well, John.

262
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:31,274
The night before your father died he
told me what he did with that money.

263
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:38,160
That money's at the bottom of the river,
wrapped around a 12pound cobblestone.

264
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,036
Thank you, Harry.

265
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:45,421
I feel clean now.

266
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:48,757
My whole body's just aquivering
with cleanness.

267
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:55,839
John, come here. Your tie is crooked.

268
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:32,800
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear you, boy.

269
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:43,896
When'll the skiff be ready?

270
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:46,939
Have her ready inside a week
and then we'll go fishing.

271
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:50,562
How's your ma?
Oh, she's all right.

272
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:52,696
How's sister Pearl?
Just fine.

273
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:55,820
You leaving, boy?
Got to watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

274
00:25:55,912 --> 00:25:58,699
Well, good night, boy.
Come again any time.

275
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:04,044
And mind, boy, I'll have your
pa's skiff shipshape inside a week.

276
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,526
Somebody there?

277
00:26:45,546 --> 00:26:47,622
Anybody there?

278
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,794
Anybody here?

279
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:54,963
Good evening, John.

280
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,969
I had a little talk with
your mother tonight, John.

281
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:04,557
And your mother decided it might be best
for me to let you know the news.

282
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:10,104
Your mother told me she wanted me to
be a daddy to you and your sister.

283
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:12,272
We're going to get married, boy.

284
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:16,193
Did you hear what I said, boy?

285
00:27:17,328 --> 00:27:20,447
Married. We're going to
Sisterville tomorrow.

286
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:24,203
And when we get back...
You ain't my dad.

287
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:26,209
You'll never be my dad.

288
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:29,462
When we get back
we're all going to be friends

289
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,708
and share our fortunes together, John.

290
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:36,052
You think you can make me tell,
but I won't. I won't!

291
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:42,428
Tell me what, boy?
Nothing.

292
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:46,136
We're not keeping secrets
from each other, are we?

293
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,726
No.

294
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,355
Well, no matter.

295
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:55,064
We've got a long time together, boy.

296
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,657
Wave your hands! Great sakes!

297
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:08,497
Now you wait here
while I get your night things.

298
00:28:13,511 --> 00:28:15,587
Now can I tell?

299
00:28:16,222 --> 00:28:19,425
When Mr Powell's our daddy
then can I tell him about it?

300
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:21,390
You swore, Pearl.
John, don't.

301
00:28:21,477 --> 00:28:23,884
You promised Dad you wouldn't tell.

302
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:26,304
I love Mr Powell lots and lots, John.

303
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:00,215
Men!

304
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:14,730
Harry?

305
00:29:16,742 --> 00:29:18,818
Fix that window shade.

306
00:29:29,922 --> 00:29:31,998
I was praying.

307
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:37,302
I'm sorry. I didn't know. I thought...

308
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:40,092
You thought, Willa,
that the moment you walked in that door

309
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:43,348
I'd start to pawing you
in that abominable way

310
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:46,685
that men are supposed to do
on their wedding night.

311
00:29:46,856 --> 00:29:48,932
Ain't that right, now?
No.

312
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,443
I think it's time we made one thing
perfectly clear, Willa.

313
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:58,356
Marriage to me represents a blending of
two spirits in the sight of heaven.

314
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,164
Get up, Willa.

315
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:16,209
Harry, what...
Get up.

316
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:22,717
Now, go look at yourself yonder
in that mirror.

317
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,637
Do as I say.

318
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:41,443
Look at yourself.

319
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:45,698
What do you see, girl?

320
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,451
You see the body of a woman.

321
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:51,207
The temple of creation and motherhood.

322
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,295
You see the flesh of Eve
that man since Adam has profaned.

323
00:30:55,717 --> 00:30:57,958
That body was meant
for begetting children.

324
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:00,294
It was not meant for the lust of men.

325
00:31:03,016 --> 00:31:05,055
Do you want more children, Willa?

326
00:31:05,144 --> 00:31:06,851
l...

327
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:08,395
No.

328
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,765
It's the business of this marriage
to mind those two you have now,

329
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:13,898
not to beget more.

330
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:16,062
Yes.

331
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:26,328
All right. You can get in bed now
and stop shivering.

332
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:33,793
Help me to get clean, so I can be
what Harry wants me to be.

333
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:46,342
Meanest, orneriest, sneakiest critter
in the whole river, boy. A gar.

334
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:50,723
Here are your hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Pshaw, boy!

335
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:53,685
Ain't a hook in the land
strong enough to land Mr Gar.

336
00:31:54,402 --> 00:31:57,984
What a fella needs is mother wit
and a horse hair.

337
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:01,106
Golly! Won't it bust it, Uncle Birdie?

338
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:03,739
No, horse hair'll hold a lumpin' whale!

339
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:06,697
You mind my cussin', boy?
No.

340
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:11,792
Well, the reason I ask,
your steppa bein' a preacher an' all...

341
00:32:14,422 --> 00:32:17,541
Never was much of a one
for preachers my own self.

342
00:32:18,343 --> 00:32:20,549
I don't know what's wrong
up at your house,

343
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:24,052
but always remember, Cap,
if you're ever in trouble,

344
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:28,139
holler and come arunnin'.
Uncle Birdie's your friend.

345
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:38,728
There! You slimy, snag-toothed,
baitstealin' soandso!

346
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:41,607
Amen.

347
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,776
You have all sinned.
Yes!

348
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,739
But which one of you can say,
as I can say,

349
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:50,948
that you drove a good man to murder?

350
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:57,089
Because I kept ahoundin' him for
perfume and clothes and face paint!

351
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:01,465
And... he slew two human beings!

352
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:04,711
And he come to me and he said

353
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:09,515
"Take this money and buy yourself
the clothes and the paint."

354
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:13,014
But brethren...

355
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,432
Oh, that's where the Lord stepped in!

356
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,311
Yes!

357
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:22,279
Alleluia!

358
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:24,989
He said, the Lord, to that man

359
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,495
"You take that money
and you throw it in the river!"

360
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:34,077
In the river!
In the river!

361
00:33:57,194 --> 00:33:59,815
Now, you're John and you're Pearl.

362
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:05,739
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a sin.

363
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:08,529
I didn't tell no one.

364
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:16,035
It's all here.

365
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,813
John?

366
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:35,764
Yes?

367
00:34:35,858 --> 00:34:38,812
What are you doin', boy?
Gettin' Pearl to bed.

368
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:41,939
What's takin' you so long about it?
Nothing.

369
00:34:47,996 --> 00:34:50,035
What's that you're playin' with?

370
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:51,498
Pearl's junk.

371
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,786
Mom gets mad when she plays out here
and don't put it away.

372
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:56,954
Come on, children.

373
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:02,417
Off to bed with the both of you.

374
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:11,135
Come here, John.

375
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:16,596
Your mother tells me you tattled on me.

376
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:20,232
She said you told her
I asked where that money was hid.

377
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:24,906
That wasn't very nice, boy. Have a heart.

378
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:27,902
Yeah!

379
00:35:28,245 --> 00:35:31,744
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's your word against mine.

380
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:34,081
It's me your mother believes.

381
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:42,418
Were you impudent again
to Mr Powell, John?

382
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:44,627
Mom, I didn't mean it.

383
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:48,047
What were you impudent about?

384
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:51,132
He asked me about
the money again, Mom.

385
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:54,052
John, you always make up that lie.

386
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:58,306
There is no money. Why can't you
get that through your head?

387
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,148
The boy's as stubborn
and as mulish as a sheep.

388
00:36:02,238 --> 00:36:03,648
It's a shame.

389
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:05,530
Good night, Icey.
Good night, honey.

390
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:07,941
Good night, Walt.

391
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:12,197
Plan on a longer visit next time.

392
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:15,287
You hardly settle before
you're frettin' to get home.

393
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:18,045
I'm needed to keep peace
and harmony betwixt them.

394
00:36:18,129 --> 00:36:20,667
It's my burden and I'm proud of it, Icey.

395
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:34,468
Where's the money hid?
I don't know.

396
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:37,598
She thinks that money's
at the bottom of the river.

397
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:39,979
But you and me,
we know better, don't we?

398
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:42,144
I don't know nothin'.

399
00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:45,732
Well, never mind, boy.
The summer's young yet.

400
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:49,360
Pearl. Come here.

401
00:36:52,956 --> 00:36:55,956
John's a fella likes to keep secrets.
I'll tell you a secret.

402
00:36:56,043 --> 00:36:59,162
Yes?
I knowed your daddy.

403
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:02,956
And you know what your daddy told me?

404
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:08,087
He said "You tell my little girl Pearl there's
to be no secrets between her and you."

405
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,971
Yes?

406
00:37:10,057 --> 00:37:12,133
All right. Now it's your turn.

407
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,635
What secret shall I tell?

408
00:37:15,938 --> 00:37:18,014
What's your name?

409
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:20,598
You're just fooling. My name's Pearl!

410
00:37:23,028 --> 00:37:25,435
Well, I reckon I'll have to try again.

411
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:28,233
Where's the money hid?

412
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:33,197
Pearl! You swore you wouldn't tell!
You swore!

413
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:35,906
You hit Daddy with the hairbrush.

414
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:42,002
Now, you see?
We can't have anything to do with John.

415
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:45,169
You and me'll go on down
to the parlour, Pearl.

416
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,527
John's just plumb bad
through and through.

417
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:08,732
John's bad.
Yes, John's bad.

418
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:14,155
Tell me another secret about my dad.
Oh, no! Your turn.

419
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:16,572
All right. What secret shall I tell?

420
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:20,992
Where's the money hid?
John's bad.

421
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:23,622
Where's the money hid?

422
00:38:23,924 --> 00:38:27,043
Tell me, you little wretch,
or I'll tear your arm off!

423
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:42,772
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
How do you mean?

424
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,772
I'm figurin' how to say it
so as you won't get mad.

425
00:38:45,863 --> 00:38:47,902
Say what, Walt Spoon?

426
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,278
Somethin's wrong about it.
About what?

427
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:52,858
About Mr Powell. All of it.
Walt...!

428
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:58,573
A body's got a right to their feelings.
May the Lord have mercy on you.

429
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:00,080
I was just...

430
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,291
Amen.

431
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,586
Are you through praying?

432
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:12,047
I'm through, Harry.

433
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:14,719
You were listening
outside the parlour window.

434
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:17,928
It ain't in the river, is it, Harry?
Answer me.

435
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:21,812
Ben never told you he throwed it
in the river, did he?

436
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:36,828
The children know where it's hid.
John knows. Is that it, Harry?

437
00:39:42,128 --> 00:39:47,003
Then it's still here amongst us.
Tainting us.

438
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,508
You must have known about it
all along, Harry.

439
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:56,927
But that ain't the reason
why you married me.

440
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,762
I know that much.

441
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:03,852
Because the Lord just wouldn't let it be.

442
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:11,024
He made you marry me so you could
show me the Way and the Life.

443
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,777
And the salvation of my soul.

444
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,115
Ain't that so, Harry?

445
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,917
So you might say that it was the money
that brung us together.

446
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,248
The rest of it don't matter.

447
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:26,934
Walt. Come quick.

448
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,232
What's wrong, Mother?
Shhh! He's in there.

449
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:33,318
Who?
Mr Powell. Willa has run away.

450
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:37,786
I'll be switched! Just went?
She took out in that old Model T.

451
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:40,572
Is he hit pretty bad?
All to pieces.

452
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,824
Well, there's a little
peach brandy in here...

453
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:45,954
A man of the cloth?
Well, just a sip.

454
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,834
Walt Spoon, that's for sickness
in the house!

455
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:54,253
Well, what can we do?
If you talked to him, another man...

456
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:57,263
Now, Mother, please. I'm no good at...

457
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:01,425
Mr Powell?

458
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,189
A strange woman is a narrow pit.
Amen.

459
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:09,018
She lieth in wait as for prey and
increaseth the transgressors among men.

460
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:12,572
Oh, my dear friends.
Whatever would I do without you?

461
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:16,026
Mr Powell!
Well, if there's anythin' we can...

462
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,618
No, it's my shame. It's my crown
of thorns. I must wear it bravely.

463
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:22,742
What could have possessed that girl?
Satan.

464
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:25,541
Didn't you have no inklin'?

465
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:28,035
Yes, I did. From the very first night.

466
00:42:28,506 --> 00:42:30,582
First night?
Our honeymoon.

467
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:33,460
How's that?

468
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:36,839
She turned me out of the bed.
No!

469
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,468
Well, what do you figure to do?

470
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,142
Do? Why, just stay right here
and take care of them kids.

471
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:49,559
Maybe it was never meant for a woman
like Willa to taint their young lives.

472
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,527
It's mighty brave of you.

473
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:55,112
I reckon it was just ordained that way,
Brother Spoon.

474
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,984
Didn't she leave no word?

475
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:02,198
A scrawl. On a notepaper on the bureau.

476
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,076
I burned it.

477
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:08,585
Tore it up and burned it,
it stank so strong of hellfire.

478
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:10,545
Amen!

479
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:13,716
The pitcher has went to the well
once too often, friends.

480
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,506
Oh, she'll come
draggin' her tail back home.

481
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:20,381
She'll not be back.
I reckon I'm safe in promisin' you that.

482
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:22,723
Maybe she's just on a spree.
Oh, no.

483
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:27,231
Well, there's no harm in hopin'.
Ain't no sense in it neither.

484
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:30,650
I figured somethin' was brewin'
when she went to bed last night.

485
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:32,812
How?

486
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:36,317
Well, she tarried around
in the kitchen after I'd gone up.

487
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:39,659
And when I went downstairs
to see what was wrong...

488
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:43,486
Well, she'd found
this jar of dandelion wine

489
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:48,044
that the husband, this Harper,
had hid somewheres in the cellar.

490
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,705
She was drinkin'.

491
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:53,466
I tried to save her.

492
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:57,299
I know you did, Mr Powell.
Oh, I knowhowhard you tried.

493
00:43:57,388 --> 00:43:59,464
But the devil wins sometimes.

494
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:03,302
Can't nobody say
I didn't do my best to save her.

495
00:45:26,104 --> 00:45:27,728
Children!

496
00:45:43,455 --> 00:45:45,531
Pearl?

497
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:50,077
Careful.

498
00:45:51,004 --> 00:45:53,080
Why do we have to hide, John?

499
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:57,629
Where's Mom?

500
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:00,174
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?

501
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:02,339
Yes, I reckon that's it.

502
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,059
Now, listen to me, Pearl.
You and me is runnin' off tonight.

503
00:46:13,152 --> 00:46:14,943
Why?

504
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:17,780
If we stay here
somethin' awful'll happen to us.

505
00:46:17,865 --> 00:46:20,106
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?

506
00:46:20,242 --> 00:46:23,408
No. That's just it. No.

507
00:46:31,545 --> 00:46:35,044
Where we going, John?
Somewheres. I don't know yet.

508
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:37,377
I'm hungry, John.

509
00:46:37,468 --> 00:46:40,587
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
It'll spoil our suppers.

510
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,756
Pearl?

511
00:46:47,145 --> 00:46:50,145
I can hear you whisperin', children,
so I know you're down there.

512
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:52,556
I can feel myself gettin' awful mad.

513
00:46:56,529 --> 00:47:00,277
I'm out of patience, children.
I'm coming to find you now.

514
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:04,403
Mr Powell!

515
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,701
Well, well, Mrs Spoon.

516
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:15,577
Where are the children?
Down there in that cellar playin' games.

517
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:17,750
And they won't mind me when I call them.

518
00:47:17,842 --> 00:47:19,918
I'm at my wit's end, Mrs Spoon.

519
00:47:21,221 --> 00:47:23,297
John? Pearl?

520
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:32,181
Shake a leg!

521
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:40,775
Well, well, well! What's that?

522
00:47:40,866 --> 00:47:44,199
Just a little hot supper
I fixed for you and the children.

523
00:47:44,286 --> 00:47:46,777
It seemed the least we could do.

524
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,031
I won't have you worryin'
poor Mr Powell another minute.

525
00:47:51,126 --> 00:47:54,162
Just look at you!
Dust and filth from top to toe.

526
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,871
Want me to take 'em up
and wash 'em good?

527
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:01,550
No. No, thank you, dear Icey.
I'll tend to them. Thank you.

528
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,890
Don't be too hard on them, Preacher.
Poor, motherless children.

529
00:48:06,058 --> 00:48:09,640
Remember, now, Mr Powell.
Don't be afraid to call on us.

530
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:16,650
Goodbye.

531
00:48:16,736 --> 00:48:19,227
Goodbye, Mrs Spoon. And thanks again.

532
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:32,041
Now, weren't you afraid, little lambs?
Down there in all that dark?

533
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:50,344
They'll think it was me.

534
00:48:50,854 --> 00:48:53,641
They'll think it was poor old Uncle Birdie.

535
00:48:56,777 --> 00:48:59,018
Oh, if you could have seen it, Bess.

536
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:02,898
Down there in the deep place.

537
00:49:03,867 --> 00:49:09,869
With her hair wavin' soft and lazy
like meadow grass under flood water.

538
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:16,042
And that slit in her throat
like she had an extra mouth.

539
00:49:20,551 --> 00:49:24,050
You're the only human mortal
I can go to, Bess.

540
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:29,682
If I go to the law, they'll hang it on me.

541
00:49:36,108 --> 00:49:39,441
Sweet heaven, save poor old Uncle Birdie!

542
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:47,823
I'm hungry.
Sure.

543
00:49:48,663 --> 00:49:53,241
And there's fried chicken, sweet
potatoes, corn bread and apple cobbler.

544
00:49:54,419 --> 00:49:57,206
Can I have my supper, please?
Naturally.

545
00:49:57,422 --> 00:50:01,550
Can I have milk too?
Mmhm. But first we'll have a little talk.

546
00:50:02,176 --> 00:50:04,252
About our secrets.
No.

547
00:50:04,554 --> 00:50:07,223
And why not, pray tell?
Cos John said I mustn't.

548
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:09,383
Never mind what John said!

549
00:50:10,393 --> 00:50:12,385
John's a meddler.

550
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:14,555
Now stop that snivellin'.

551
00:50:14,773 --> 00:50:16,931
Looky here. You know what that is?

552
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:20,350
Want to see somethin' cute? Now looky.

553
00:50:22,614 --> 00:50:24,690
How about that!

554
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:27,401
This is what I use on meddlers.

555
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:30,279
John might be a meddler.

556
00:50:30,747 --> 00:50:33,119
No, little lamb. Don't touch it.

557
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,332
Don't touch my knife.
That makes me mad. Very, very mad.

558
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:41,710
Now, just tell me. Where's the money hid?

559
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:44,416
But I swore.
I promised John I wouldn't tell.

560
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:46,587
John doesn't matter!

561
00:50:47,765 --> 00:50:52,890
Can't I get that through your head,
you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch?

562
00:50:57,983 --> 00:51:00,390
There now. You made me lose my temper.

563
00:51:02,446 --> 00:51:05,363
I'm sorry. I'm real sorry.

564
00:51:06,283 --> 00:51:08,904
Now, just tell me. Where's it hid, honey?

565
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,943
I'll tell.
I told youto keep your mouth shut.

566
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:16,416
It ain't fair to make Pearl tell
when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.

567
00:51:16,502 --> 00:51:18,044
Well, I declare!

568
00:51:18,129 --> 00:51:21,913
Sometimes I think poor ol' John
might make it to heaven yet.

569
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:27,382
All right, boy. Where's the money?
In the cellar. Under a stone in the floor.

570
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:32,343
It'll go hard if I find you're lyin', boy.
I'm not lyin'. Go look for yourself.

571
00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:36,805
All right.

572
00:51:46,741 --> 00:51:48,817
Come along.
What?

573
00:51:52,164 --> 00:51:54,240
Go ahead of me. The both of you.

574
00:51:55,584 --> 00:51:57,660
Down those stairs.

575
00:52:01,715 --> 00:52:04,040
You don't reckon I'd leave you,
do you, boy?

576
00:52:04,134 --> 00:52:08,083
Well, don't you believe me?
Why, sure, boy. Sure.

577
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:14,092
And where now? Mind, no tricks, now.

578
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:16,429
I can't abide a liar.

579
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:18,723
Yonder.

580
00:52:21,902 --> 00:52:23,978
Oh, no, you don't.

581
00:52:28,617 --> 00:52:32,116
Now where, boy, where?
Under the stone in the floor.

582
00:52:41,797 --> 00:52:43,873
This is concrete.

583
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:47,050
John made a sin. John told a lie.

584
00:52:49,847 --> 00:52:51,923
The Lord's a-talking to me now.

585
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:57,842
He's asaying "A liar
is an abomination before mine eyes."

586
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:01,600
Speak, boy, where's it hid?

587
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,143
Speak.

588
00:53:04,237 --> 00:53:08,863
Speak, or I'll cut your throat and leave you
to drip like a hog in butchering time.

589
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,950
Pearl, shut up. Pearl, you swore!

590
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:15,204
You could save him, little bird.

591
00:53:15,623 --> 00:53:17,699
It's in my doll!

592
00:53:21,296 --> 00:53:23,372
The doll!

593
00:53:26,259 --> 00:53:28,335
Why, sure!

594
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:31,425
The last place anybody'd think to look.

595
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,866
Uncle Birdie Steptoe.

596
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:05,298
Open that door, you spawn
of the devil's own strumpet!

597
00:54:32,994 --> 00:54:35,070
Uncle Birdie!

598
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:39,617
Uncle Birdie.
John.

599
00:54:40,001 --> 00:54:43,416
Hide us, Uncle Birdie.
He's acoming with his knife.

600
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:49,085
It's me. John Harper and Pearl.
You told me to come.

601
00:54:49,177 --> 00:54:51,383
Johnny?
Uncle Birdie, oh, please.

602
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:53,344
Please! Wake up!

603
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:56,597
I swear on the Book, I never done it.

604
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:14,527
There's still the river.

605
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:24,703
The skiff is under the willow.

606
00:55:43,649 --> 00:55:45,725
Children!

607
00:58:33,113 --> 00:58:34,773
"Dear Walt and Icey,

608
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:38,031
I bet you've been worried
and gave us up for lost."

609
00:58:38,577 --> 00:58:43,073
"Took the kids down here with me
for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm."

610
00:58:44,166 --> 00:58:47,202
"Thought a little change of scenery
would do us all a world of good

611
00:58:47,295 --> 00:58:49,786
after so much trouble and heartache."

612
00:58:50,548 --> 00:58:54,332
"At least the kids will get
aplenty of good home cooking."

613
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,336
"Your devoted Harry Powell."

614
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:58,505
Now, ain't you relieved, Walt?

615
00:58:58,723 --> 00:59:03,965
Sure. But you was worried too, Mother.
Taking off with never a word of goodbye!

616
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:07,395
I figured them gypsies busted in
and done off with all three of them.

617
00:59:07,482 --> 00:59:10,020
You and your gypsies.
They been gone a week.

618
00:59:10,109 --> 00:59:14,189
Sure. But not before one of 'em
knifed a farmer and stole his horse.

619
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,687
Never caught the gypsy. Nor the horse.

620
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:36,460
Such times,
when young 'uns run the roads.

621
00:59:36,553 --> 00:59:38,629
Go away, children.

622
00:59:45,312 --> 00:59:47,019
Hungry, I suppose?

623
00:59:47,105 --> 00:59:50,438
Well, I can't spare you more
than one potato apiece.

624
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,648
Where are yourfolks?
Ain't got none.

625
00:59:53,779 --> 00:59:55,855
Oh, go away, go away.

626
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:08,660
An ungrateful child is an
abomination before the eyes of God.

627
01:00:08,753 --> 01:00:13,794
The world is going to damnation because
of young 'uns flying in the face of age.

628
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:29,730
They make soup out of them,

629
01:00:29,816 --> 01:00:33,149
but I wouldn't know
how to go about getting him open.

630
01:01:30,002 --> 01:01:32,493
We're going to spend the night on land.

631
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:41,814
Are we going home now, John?

632
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:55,450
Don't he never sleep?

633
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:03,543
Pearl, wake up. Come on!

634
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:50,385
You two youngsters
get up here to me this instant.

635
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:55,261
Get on up to my house.
Mind me, now. I'll get me a switch.

636
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:13,861
Don't you hurt her.
Hurt her? Wash her's more like it!

637
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:18,786
Ruby! Clary! Mary!
Yes, Miss Cooper.

638
01:08:20,003 --> 01:08:22,079
Bring your baskets.

639
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:28,008
Nicely picked, Clary.

640
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,546
Mary, put the big ones on top.

641
01:08:30,805 --> 01:08:33,177
Ruby, most of them
ain't fit to go to market.

642
01:08:33,266 --> 01:08:34,760
Put them down.

643
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:38,718
Ruby, run to the house and fetch
the tub and put it by the pump.

644
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:42,146
Clary... Mary,
run up and fetch a bar of laundry soap.

645
01:08:42,234 --> 01:08:43,609
Yes, Miss Cooper.

646
01:08:43,694 --> 01:08:47,027
And a scrub brush!
Come on up to the house, children.

647
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:52,028
Gracious, if you ain't a sight to beat all!

648
01:08:52,411 --> 01:08:54,487
Where you from?

649
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:57,412
Where are your folks?

650
01:08:57,499 --> 01:08:59,575
Come on, speak up, now.

651
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:04,541
Gracious,
so I've got two more mouths to feed.

652
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:34,109
Howdy, Miss Cooper.
What happened to my milk?

653
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:35,745
Price of milk what it is, not on your life.

654
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,571
Do better making butter
with the cream. Sell it retail.

655
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:42,331
Make smearcase for the children,
feed what's left to my hogs.

656
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,626
She talks to herself.
All the time.

657
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:48,462
Your ma's funny.
She ain't our ma. We just live with her.

658
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,085
Where are your folks?
Someplace.

659
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:53,052
My daddy's in Detroit.

660
01:09:54,683 --> 01:09:56,759
Mary!

661
01:09:58,186 --> 01:10:00,095
Honey. Good morning, Miss Cooper.

662
01:10:00,188 --> 01:10:02,429
I'm saving up to buy you a bracelet.

663
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:07,773
Never mind that, don't forget your visit
this Sunday  and come to church with us.

664
01:10:08,864 --> 01:10:10,940
See you Sunday, love.

665
01:10:11,742 --> 01:10:13,818
Take your baskets in, children.

666
01:10:14,328 --> 01:10:16,285
Women is fools.

667
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:18,447
All of 'em.

668
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:21,783
Looky there.

669
01:10:21,877 --> 01:10:24,415
She'll be losing her mind
to a tricky mouth and a full moon,

670
01:10:24,505 --> 01:10:28,502
and like as not, I'll be saddled
with the consequences.

671
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:31,335
Here's what you owe me.

672
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,672
One, two, three, four, five...

673
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:37,012
Where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?

674
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:38,559
She went.

675
01:10:38,644 --> 01:10:40,720
John, you go find Ruby.

676
01:10:40,938 --> 01:10:44,556
Big Ruby's my bothersome girl.
She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em.

677
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:49,062
But she's got mother hands with the
young 'uns, so what are you to say?

678
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,689
How about tonight, Ruby?

679
01:10:51,782 --> 01:10:54,189
What gives?
The old lady's around.

680
01:10:55,411 --> 01:10:57,487
How about Thursday?

681
01:10:58,789 --> 01:11:02,323
The old gal thinks she comes in
for sewing lessons on Thursday.

682
01:11:02,418 --> 01:11:04,494
Miss Cooper wants you.

683
01:11:07,799 --> 01:11:10,669
And will you show me your dolly,
little lady?

684
01:11:11,928 --> 01:11:13,920
I see you got two more peeps
to your brood.

685
01:11:14,013 --> 01:11:17,547
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How's your own boy, Miss Cooper?

686
01:11:17,642 --> 01:11:22,469
Haven't heard from Ralph since last
Christmas. Still, I've got a new crop.

687
01:11:23,523 --> 01:11:26,559
I'm a strong tree
with branches for many birds.

688
01:11:26,901 --> 01:11:30,649
I'm good for something in this old world,
and I know it too.

689
01:11:53,387 --> 01:11:57,598
Now, old Pharaoh,
he was king of Egypt land,

690
01:11:58,267 --> 01:12:00,058
and he had a daughter.

691
01:12:00,644 --> 01:12:02,720
And once upon a time,

692
01:12:04,565 --> 01:12:06,391
she was walking along by the river bank

693
01:12:06,483 --> 01:12:10,148
and she seen something bumping
and scraping along on a sand bar

694
01:12:10,237 --> 01:12:14,021
down under the willows.
And you know what it was, children?

695
01:12:14,408 --> 01:12:15,321
No.

696
01:12:15,409 --> 01:12:18,160
Now, it was a skiff, washed up on the bar.

697
01:12:19,497 --> 01:12:21,323
And who do you reckon was in it?

698
01:12:21,415 --> 01:12:23,491
Pearl and John.

699
01:12:23,918 --> 01:12:28,912
Not this time. There was only
one young 'un, a little boy babe.

700
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,294
And you know who he was, children?
No.

701
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,256
It was Moses. A king of men.

702
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,966
Moses, children.

703
01:12:40,476 --> 01:12:42,552
Now, off to bed with you.

704
01:12:42,937 --> 01:12:45,641
John, get me an apple.

705
01:13:01,957 --> 01:13:04,033
And get one for yourself too.

706
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:19,382
John, where are your folks?

707
01:13:19,766 --> 01:13:21,842
Dead.

708
01:13:23,645 --> 01:13:25,721
Where are you from?

709
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:28,057
Upriver.

710
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:33,729
I didn't figure you'd rowed that skiff
all the way up from Parkersburg.

711
01:13:47,378 --> 01:13:49,454
Tell me that story again.

712
01:13:49,922 --> 01:13:51,998
Story? What story, honey?

713
01:13:53,259 --> 01:13:54,753
About them kings.

714
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:58,711
And the queen found down on
the sand bar that time in the skiff.

715
01:13:58,806 --> 01:14:02,009
Kings?
Why, there was only one king, honey.

716
01:14:03,311 --> 01:14:05,387
I mind you said there was two.

717
01:14:06,647 --> 01:14:09,316
Well, shoot now. Maybe there was.

718
01:14:10,777 --> 01:14:13,268
Yes, come to think of it, there was two.

719
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,131
Must be Thursday. Here comes Ruby.

720
01:14:49,816 --> 01:14:51,892
Here I go.

721
01:14:58,075 --> 01:15:00,447
Why, you're Ruby, ain't you, my child?

722
01:15:00,536 --> 01:15:01,781
Can I have this?

723
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:04,408
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.

724
01:15:04,581 --> 01:15:06,324
Will you buy me an ice cream?
Of course.

725
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:08,789
Watch out, Preacher.
Why, Preacher!

726
01:15:08,877 --> 01:15:10,953
Shut your dirty mouths.

727
01:15:22,266 --> 01:15:23,676
Ain't I pretty?

728
01:15:23,768 --> 01:15:27,812
Why, you're the prettiest thing
I ever seen in all my wandering.

729
01:15:27,897 --> 01:15:30,435
Ain't nobody never told you that, Ruby?

730
01:15:30,858 --> 01:15:33,230
No, no one never did.

731
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:36,070
There's two new ones out your place,
ain't there?

732
01:15:36,155 --> 01:15:38,231
Uhhuh.

733
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:41,024
What's their names?
Pearl and John.

734
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:46,495
Is there a doll?
Only they don't never let me play with it.

735
01:15:54,382 --> 01:15:57,751
Did you ever see such pretty eyes
in all your born days?

736
01:15:57,844 --> 01:15:59,635
Don't let him get away, sugar.

737
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:04,466
He ain't like you all. Next time, I won't
even ask him to buy me an ice cream.

738
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,894
I's bitten bad.

739
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,907
Ruby, you didn't have money to buy this.
You'll whip me.

740
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,618
When did I ever?

741
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:27,286
This man at the drugstore, he gave...
The drugstore?

742
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:31,873
Miss Cooper, I never been
to sewing lessons all them times.

743
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,038
What you been up to, Ruby?

744
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,624
I been out with men.

745
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:40,294
Child.

746
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:48,845
You were looking for love, Ruby,
in the only foolish way you knewhow.

747
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,018
We all need love, Ruby.

748
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,729
I lost the love of my son.

749
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,231
I found it with you all.

750
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,284
You're going to grow up to be a strong,
fine woman.

751
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:09,452
I'm going to see to it that you do.
This gentleman weren't like them.

752
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:12,329
He just give me a book
and buy me an ice cream.

753
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:15,628
Now, who was this?
He didn't ask me for nothing.

754
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:18,586
What did you talk about?
Pearl and John.

755
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:22,464
John and Pearl? Is he their pap?

756
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:24,840
I don't know.

757
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,806
Wonder why he hasn't been to the house.

758
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:48,572
Miss Cooper!

759
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:51,501
What?
The man!

760
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,755
Good morning, ladies.

761
01:17:57,841 --> 01:18:01,210
How do?
Why, you're Miss Cooper, I take it?

762
01:18:01,929 --> 01:18:04,087
It's about that John and that Pearl?

763
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:06,257
Oh, them poor little lambs.

764
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:08,888
To think I never hoped
to see them again in this world.

765
01:18:08,978 --> 01:18:13,390
Oh, dear madam, if you was to know
what a crown of thorns I've borne

766
01:18:13,482 --> 01:18:15,723
in my search for them stray chicks.

767
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:18,811
Ruby, go fetch them kids.

768
01:18:21,949 --> 01:18:24,736
Oh, madam,
I see you're looking at my hands.

769
01:18:25,494 --> 01:18:29,538
Shall I tell you the story of Lefthand,
Righthand, the tale of good and evil?

770
01:18:29,624 --> 01:18:33,621
It was with this left hand that Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

771
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:37,625
Them kids is yours?
My own flesh and blood.

772
01:18:38,007 --> 01:18:42,051
Where's your missus?
She run off with a drummer.

773
01:18:42,762 --> 01:18:45,300
During prayer meeting.
Where's she at?

774
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:47,963
Down the river somewheres.
Parkersburg, Cincinnati.

775
01:18:48,059 --> 01:18:51,677
One of them Sodoms of the Ohio river.
She took them kids with her?

776
01:18:51,771 --> 01:18:54,807
Oh, heaven only knows
what unholy sights and sounds

777
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:59,442
them innocent babes has heard in the
dens of perdition where she dragged 'em.

778
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:04,356
Right funny, ain't it, how they rode
all the way upriver in a ten-foot john boat.

779
01:19:05,952 --> 01:19:09,617
Are they well, Miss Cooper?
A sight better than they was.

780
01:19:11,124 --> 01:19:14,706
Gracious, gracious,
you are a good woman, Miss Cooper.

781
01:19:15,003 --> 01:19:17,576
How you figuring to raise them two
without a woman?

782
01:19:17,673 --> 01:19:21,088
The Lord will provide.
The Lord is merciful.

783
01:19:21,802 --> 01:19:24,090
Oh, what a day this is.

784
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:26,255
And there's little John.

785
01:19:26,473 --> 01:19:28,964
What's wrong, John?
Come to me, boy.

786
01:19:29,184 --> 01:19:32,054
What's wrong, John?
Didn't you hear me, boy?

787
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:34,518
When your dad says "come"
you should mind him.

788
01:19:34,606 --> 01:19:36,479
He ain't my dad.

789
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:42,353
No, and he ain't no preacher neither.

790
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:53,873
Just march yourself yonder
to your horse, mister.

791
01:19:57,046 --> 01:19:59,122
March, mister. I'm not foolin'!

792
01:20:02,301 --> 01:20:06,250
All right. But you haven't
heard the last of Harry Powell yet!

793
01:20:07,348 --> 01:20:10,763
The Lord God Jehovah
will guide my hand in vengeance.

794
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:14,471
You devils!

795
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:18,774
You whores of Babylon!

796
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:25,858
I'll be back! When it's dark!

797
01:22:00,588 --> 01:22:05,166
Shame on you, Ruby, mooning around
the house after that mad dog of a man.

798
01:22:07,137 --> 01:22:08,797
Merciful heavens!

799
01:22:09,806 --> 01:22:13,673
Ruby, go get the children out of bed
and bring them down here.

800
01:22:15,687 --> 01:22:17,763
Women are such darn fools.

801
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:39,409
It's a hard world for little things.

802
01:23:01,067 --> 01:23:05,064
Now, there was this sneaking,
noaccount, ornery King Herod,

803
01:23:05,154 --> 01:23:07,360
and when he heard of
little Jesus growin' up,

804
01:23:07,448 --> 01:23:11,280
he figured "Well, shoot, there
won't be room for the both of us."

805
01:23:11,661 --> 01:23:13,036
"I'll nip this in the bud."

806
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:16,786
But he wasn't sure which of all them
babies in the land was King Jesus.

807
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:19,281
So that cruel old King Herod figured,

808
01:23:19,377 --> 01:23:23,125
if he was to kill all the babies in the land
he'd be sure and get little Jesus.

809
01:23:23,715 --> 01:23:26,206
When little King Jesus'
ma and pa heard about this,

810
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:27,843
what do you reckon they done?

811
01:23:27,927 --> 01:23:30,548
They hid in a closet.
They hid under the porch.

812
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:32,714
No. They went arunning.

813
01:23:33,266 --> 01:23:37,050
Well, now, John, you're right.
That's just what they done.

814
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:39,677
Little King Jesus' ma and pa
saddled a mule

815
01:23:39,773 --> 01:23:42,228
and they rode all the way down
into Egypt land.

816
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:45,686
Yeah, and that's where the queen
found them in the bulrushes.

817
01:23:45,779 --> 01:23:48,863
Oh, no, that wasn't the same story.
That was little King Moses.

818
01:23:48,949 --> 01:23:52,816
But just the same, it did seem like
it was a plague time for little ones.

819
01:23:52,911 --> 01:23:55,449
Them olden days. Them hard, hard times.

820
01:24:02,963 --> 01:24:04,789
Figured I was gone, huh?

821
01:24:04,882 --> 01:24:07,586
Run. Hide on the staircase. Run quick!

822
01:24:07,968 --> 01:24:10,044
Ruby, get!

823
01:24:10,471 --> 01:24:12,796
What do you want?
I want them kids.

824
01:24:13,474 --> 01:24:15,217
What do you want them for?

825
01:24:15,309 --> 01:24:18,263
None of your business, madam.
I'm giving you to the count of three to go.

826
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:21,473
Then I'm coming across
to the kitchen to shoot you!

827
01:24:35,746 --> 01:24:37,822
Miss Booth? Rachel Cooper.

828
01:24:37,999 --> 01:24:40,075
Get your state troopers out to my place.

829
01:24:40,168 --> 01:24:42,409
I got something trapped in my barn.

830
01:24:53,264 --> 01:24:55,885
I'll go see to Pearl.
I'll make coffee.

831
01:25:06,152 --> 01:25:08,228
She's all right.

832
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,446
John, you know when you're little
you have more endurance

833
01:25:12,534 --> 01:25:14,775
than God is ever to grant you again?

834
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:18,406
Children are man at his strongest.
They abide.

835
01:25:32,888 --> 01:25:36,885
Why didn't you call us before now?
Didn't want your dirty shoes on my floor.

836
01:25:36,975 --> 01:25:38,137
Is that him?

837
01:25:38,227 --> 01:25:41,181
Yes. Mind where you shoot, boys.
There are children here.

838
01:25:41,271 --> 01:25:45,564
Harry Powell, you're under arrest
for the murder of Willa Harper.

839
01:25:47,069 --> 01:25:49,145
Drop that knife, Powell.

840
01:25:50,739 --> 01:25:51,734
Don't.

841
01:25:57,913 --> 01:25:59,455
Here!

842
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,698
Take it back, Dad. Take it back!

843
01:26:01,792 --> 01:26:04,995
I don't want it, Dad! It's too much! Here!

844
01:26:16,432 --> 01:26:18,508
Lynch him!

845
01:26:19,185 --> 01:26:21,011
Bluebeard!

846
01:26:21,104 --> 01:26:24,104
25 wives!
And he killed every last one of 'em.

847
01:26:24,190 --> 01:26:27,440
If the people of Marshall County...
Bluebeard!

848
01:26:33,825 --> 01:26:35,901
Will you identify the prisoner?

849
01:26:36,578 --> 01:26:38,036
Please, little lad,

850
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:43,328
won't you look yonder and tell the court
if that is the man that killed your mother?

851
01:26:50,592 --> 01:26:54,126
It's all right, Mrs Cooper,
you can take the little fellow away.

852
01:26:54,346 --> 01:26:56,587
Merry Christmas to you and yours,
Mrs Cooper.

853
01:26:56,682 --> 01:27:01,094
And what's Santa Claus going to
bring you for Christmas, little man?

854
01:27:11,613 --> 01:27:13,689
That's Pearl!
Get your coats.

855
01:27:14,533 --> 01:27:16,572
Them's her orphans.

856
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,403
Where's Ruby?
She went.

857
01:27:18,495 --> 01:27:21,330
Them poor little lambs.

858
01:27:21,415 --> 01:27:25,364
Them is the ones he sinned against,
my friends.

859
01:27:25,836 --> 01:27:27,912
Go out the back door.

860
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:33,875
Ain't we going to the bus depot?

861
01:27:35,513 --> 01:27:39,047
Dragging the name of the Lord
through the evil mud of his soul!

862
01:27:39,142 --> 01:27:43,887
String that Bluebeard up to a post!
He's Satan hiding behind the cross!

863
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:33,895
I love him. You think he's like them others.

864
01:28:39,912 --> 01:28:41,988
You were so mad, you shot him.

865
01:28:58,055 --> 01:28:59,513
Hey, Bart.
Yeah?

866
01:28:59,598 --> 01:29:03,547
We're saving this bird up for you.
This time it'll be a privilege.

867
01:29:29,504 --> 01:29:32,125
I'm glad they sent me nothing.
It's never nothing I want.

868
01:29:32,215 --> 01:29:37,042
Just something to show me how fancy
and smart they've come up in the world.

869
01:29:42,767 --> 01:29:44,676
Can we give you your presents now?

870
01:29:44,769 --> 01:29:49,514
Shoot, you don't mean to say
you got me a present? Shoot, now.

871
01:29:56,198 --> 01:29:57,478
Ruby.

872
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,276
A potholder!

873
01:30:00,369 --> 01:30:03,073
And it's much neater than last year, Ruby.

874
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:05,497
Clary.

875
01:30:06,917 --> 01:30:12,077
Another potholder! Ain't that thoughtful.
I'm always burning my hands.

876
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,587
This doesn't look basted.
This looks made!

877
01:30:18,554 --> 01:30:21,045
And you finished the edge
with a chainstitch.

878
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:23,216
Oh, that's just dandy, Clary.

879
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:28,263
Another potholder?

880
01:30:33,527 --> 01:30:36,196
Oh, now, did you two make this together?

881
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,356
He helped us some.

882
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:50,037
That's the richest gift a body could have.

883
01:30:51,462 --> 01:30:55,411
And your presents are in the
cupboard under the china closet.

884
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:58,468
Ruby.

885
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:02,297
This is yours.

886
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:22,284
Lord save little children.
You'd think the world'd be ashamed

887
01:31:22,369 --> 01:31:27,196
to name such a day as Christmas for one
of them, then go on in the same old way.

888
01:31:28,417 --> 01:31:32,960
My soul is humble when I see the way
little ones accept their lot.

889
01:31:34,339 --> 01:31:36,497
Lord save little children.

890
01:31:36,592 --> 01:31:38,999
The wind blows and the rains are cold...

891
01:31:40,012 --> 01:31:42,088
yet they abide.

892
01:32:10,293 --> 01:32:12,700
That watch sure is a fine loud ticker.

893
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:19,291
Be nice to have someone round the house
who can give me the right time of day.

894
01:32:19,385 --> 01:32:22,006
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.

895
01:32:22,722 --> 01:32:27,015
Well, a fella just can't go around
with rundown, busted watches.

896
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,476
They abide and they endure.
