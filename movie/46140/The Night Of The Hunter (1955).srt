1
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,740
Dream, little one, dream

2
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,780
Dream, my little one, dream

3
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,180
Oh, the hunter

4
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
In the night

5
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,620
Fills your childish heart

6
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,220
With fright

7
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,660
Fear is only a dream

8
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,060
So dream, little one

9
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,300
Dream

10
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,740
Now, you remember, children,
how I told you last Sunday...

11
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,140
about the good Lord going up into the
mountain and talking to the people...

12
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,060
and how He said, "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God"...

13
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,580
and how He said that King Solomon
in all his glory...

14
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,420
was not as beautiful
as the lilies of the field?

15
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,060
And I know you won't forget,
"Judge not lest ye be judged"...

16
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,180
because I explained that to you.

17
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,780
And then the Good Lord
went on to say...

18
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,660
"Beware of false prophets...

19
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,460
which come to you
in sheep's clothing...

20
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,740
but inwardly
they are ravening wolves.

21
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,660
Ye shall know them
by their fruits."

22
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,700
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty,
twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five...

23
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,260
forty, forty-five, fifty, fifty-five,
sixty, sixty-five, seventy...

24
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,500
seventy-five, eighty, eighty-five,
ninety, ninety-five, one hundred!

25
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,700
Here I come, ready or not!

26
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,380
What's wrong?

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Hey! Hey!

28
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,260
"A good tree cannot
bring forth evil fruit.

29
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,780
Neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit.

30
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,340
Wherefore, by their fruits,
ye shall know them."

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,900
Well, now, what's it to be, Lord?

32
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,180
Another widow?

33
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,860
How many has it been? Six?

34
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,860
Twelve? I disremember.

35
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,900
You say the word, Lord,
I'm on my way.

36
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,980
You always send me money
to go forth and preach Your Word.

37
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,340
A widow with a little wad of bills
hid away in a sugar bowl.

38
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,180
Lord, I am tired.

39
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,940
Sometimes I wonder
if You really understand, Lord.

40
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,740
Not that you mind the killings.
Your book is full of killings.

41
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,660
But there are things
You do hate, Lord.

42
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,180
Perfume-smelling things,
lacy things...

43
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,740
things with curly hair.

44
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,820
There are too many of them.
You can't kill a world.

45
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,700
You driving a touring car
with a Moundsville license?

46
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,340
Harry Powell, for the theft
of that touring car...

47
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,380
you'll spend 30 days
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

48
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,980
- Preacher Harry Powell.
- A car thief.

49
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,020
Picked up where you were?
A man of God?

50
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,460
Harry Powell.

51
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,700
- Hold Miss Jenny still.
- Stand still, Miss Jenny.

52
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,900
There. What's so hard about that?

53
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,620
Daddy!

54
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,500
- Where's your mom?
- Out shoppin'.

55
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,780
- You're bleedin', Dad.
- Listen to me, John.

56
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,940
This money here-- We gotta hide it
before they get to me.

57
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,100
There's close to $10,000.
Where?

58
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,580
Under a rock in the smokehouse? No.

59
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,940
In the bricks in the grape harbor.
No, they'd dig for it.

60
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,060
Sure. That's the place.

61
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,300
- That's him.
- He probably still has that gun.

62
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,860
Listen to me, son. You've gotta swear.
Swear means promise.

63
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,940
First, swear you'll take care of little
Pearl, guard her with your lif e, boy.

64
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,660
Then, swear you won't never tell where
the money's hid, not even your mom.

65
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,340
- Yes, Dad.
- You understand?

66
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,860
- Not even her?
- You've got common sense. She ain't.

67
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,940
When you grow up,
that money will belong to you.

68
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,700
Now stand up straight, look me
in the eye and raise your right hand.

69
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,900
Now swear,
"I'll guard Pearl with my lif e."

70
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,980
I will guard Pearl with my lif e.

71
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,900
"And I won't never
tell about the money."

72
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,780
And I won't never tell
about the money.

73
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,900
You, Pearl, you swear too.

74
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,220
Ben Harper.

75
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,100
I'm going now, children.
Good-bye.

76
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,460
Drop that gun, Harper.
We don't want the kids hurt.

77
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,420
Just mind what you swore, son.
Mind, boy.

78
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,860
Don't. Don't!

79
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,260
Dad.

80
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,740
Ben Harper, it is the sentence
of this court...

81
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,740
that for the murder
of Ed Smiley and Corey South...

82
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,500
you be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

83
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,020
And may God have mercy
on your soul.

84
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,380
- It's mine.
- Where, Ben? Where?

85
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,860
"And the little child
shall lead them."

86
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,300
Come on, boy. Tell me.

87
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,620
Ben, I'm a man of God.

88
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,540
Trying to make me talk about it
in my sleep.

89
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,740
What'd I say? What? What?

90
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,660
You was quotin'
the scripture, Ben.

91
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,660
You said, "And the little child
shall lead them."

92
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,900
- You killed two men, Ben Harper.
- That's right, preacher.

93
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,140
I robbed that bank
'cause I got tired of seein'...

94
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,260
children roamin' the woodlands
without food--

95
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,260
children roamin' the highways
in this era of depression--

96
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,860
children sleepin' in old abandoned
car bodies and junk heaps.

97
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,220
I promised myself I'd never see the day
when my young 'uns would want.

98
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,580
With that $10,000,
I could build a tabernacle...

99
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,740
make that Wheeling Tabernacle
look like a chicken house.

100
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,100
Would you have free candy
for the kids, preacher?

101
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,300
Think of it, Ben.
With that cursed, bloody gold.

102
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,780
How come you got that stick knif e
hid up in your bed blankets, preacher?

103
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,460
The Lord blinded mine enemies when
they brought me into this evil place.

104
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,580
I smuggled it in right
under the noses of them guards.

105
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,540
I come not with peace,
but with a sword.

106
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,660
You, preacher?

107
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,140
This sword has served me through
many an evil time, Ben Harper.

108
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,580
What religion
do you prof ess, preacher?

109
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,700
The religion the Almighty and me
worked out betwixt us.

110
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,620
I'll bet.

111
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,180
Salvation is a last-minute
business, boy.

112
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,340
Keep talkin', preacher.

113
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,900
If you let that money serve the Lord's
purpose, He might f eel kind towards you.

114
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,340
Keep talkin', preacher.

115
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,900
Now, don't you think the Lord
might change His mind if you was to--

116
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,980
Lord, You sure knowed
what you was doing...

117
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,820
when You put me in this very cell
at this very time.

118
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,420
A man with $10,000 hidden somewhere...

119
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,020
and a widow in the making.

120
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,420
- Any trouble?
- No.

121
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,820
He was a cool one, that Harper.
Never broke.

122
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,860
Carried on some, kicked.

123
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
They say he left a wif e
and two kids.

124
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,900
I never heard.

125
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,660
- He never told about the money?
- No.

126
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,020
What do you figure
he done with it?

127
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,780
He took the secret with him
when I dropped him.

128
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,300
That you, Bart?
Supper's waitin'.

129
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,860
Mother, sometimes I think it might be
better if I was to quit my job as guard.

130
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,300
You're always this way after a hanging.
You never have to be there.

131
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,700
Sometimes I wish
I was back in the mine.

132
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,100
And leave me a widow after
another blast like the one in '24?

133
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,420
Not on your lif e, old mister.

134
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,740
Hing, hang, hung
See what the hangman done

135
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,700
Hing, hang, hing, hang
Hing, hang, hung

136
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,500
See what the hangman done

137
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,500
Hung, hang, hing
See the robber swing

138
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,020
Hing, hang, hing, hang
Hing, hang, hing, hang

139
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,900
Hing, hang, hung
Now my song is done

140
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,500
Hing, hang, hung
See what the hangman done

141
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,340
Hung, hang, hing
See the robber swing

142
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,380
Are you going to buy it, John?

143
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,700
Oh, so your mommy's keeping you
out of school these days.

144
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,420
How is your poor, poor mother?

145
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
She's at Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor.

146
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,700
Did they ever find out what your father
done with all that money he stole?

147
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,780
Pearl and me,
we have to go.

148
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,740
- You better not sing that song.
- Why?

149
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,980
'Cause you're too little.

150
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,740
Can we get some candy?

151
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,980
Willa Harper, there are certain
plain facts of lif e that adds up...

152
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,860
just like two plus two makes four,
and one of them is this--

153
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,660
No woman is able to raise
growing youngsters alone.

154
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,820
The Lord meant that job for two.

155
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,540
Icey, I just don't want a husband.

156
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,140
It ain't a question
of wanting or not wanting.

157
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,860
You're no spring chicken.
You're a grown woman with two children.

158
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,420
It's a man you need
in the house, Willa Harper.

159
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,380
Tell me a story, John.

160
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,380
Well, once upon a time...

161
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,780
there was a rich king who had himself
a son and a daughter.

162
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,140
They all lived in a castle
over in Africa.

163
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,220
And one day, this king
got taken away by some bad men.

164
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,660
And before he got took off...

165
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,420
he told his son to kill anyone
who tried to steal his gold.

166
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,100
And before long,
the bad men came back and--

167
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,940
Leaning

168
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,180
Just a man.
Good night, Pearl.

169
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,100
Sleep tight
and don't let the bedbugs bite.

170
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,900
Good night, Miss Jenny.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

171
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,340
Leaning

172
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:52,620
Leaning on the everlasting Arm

173
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,500
She don't put in here no more,
but she still blows as she passes.

174
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,380
Come on in and have
a cup of coff ee, boy.

175
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,100
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.

176
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,780
Ain't nobody gonna, neither,
long as Uncle Birdie's around.

177
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,860
First day my joints is limberin' up,
I'll go and give her a good caulkin'.

178
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,300
Ain't seen ya
in a coon's age, boy.

179
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,660
- I've been mindin' Pearl.
- Shucks, ain't it a caution...

180
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,900
what a woman will load
onto a man's back when he ain't lookin'?

181
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,260
Excuse me, Cap,
while I sweeten' my coff ee.

182
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,180
Dead and gone these 25 years,
and never takes her eyes off me.

183
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,260
A man of my years needs a little snort
in the mornin', heat the boilers.

184
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,060
Yeah.

185
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,900
I was talkin' to this stranger
up at the boardin' house.

186
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,900
- He knowed your dad.
- Where did he know Dad?

187
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,300
I'll not hide it from you, boy. He
knowed in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

188
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,740
- I gotta go now, Uncle Birdie.
- Well, you just got here, boy.

189
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,860
I told Mom I'd be back
to Spoon's for Pearl.

190
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,660
God works in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform.

191
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,900
Yes, I was with Brother Harper
right up to the end.

192
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,620
Now that I'm no longer employed
by the penitentiary...

193
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,260
it is my joy to bring
this small comfort to his loved ones.

194
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,820
It's a mighty good man
would go out of his way...

195
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,700
to bring a word of cheer
to a grievin' widow.

196
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,860
- So you ain't with the state no more?
- No, brother, I resigned yesterday.

197
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,300
The heartrendin' spectacle of them
poor men was just too much for me.

198
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,860
Ah, little lad,
you're starin' at my fingers.

199
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,420
Would you like me to tell you the little
story of "Right Hand, Left Hand--"

200
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,500
the story of good and evil?

201
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,460
"H-A-T-E."

202
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,660
It was with this left hand
that old Brother Cain...

203
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,220
struck the blow
that laid his brother low.

204
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,060
"L-O-V-E."
You see these fingers, dear hearts?

205
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,020
These fingers has veins that run
straight to the soul of man.

206
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,820
The right hand, friends.
The hand of love.

207
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,860
Now watch, and I'll show you
the story of lif e.

208
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,740
These fingers is always a-warrin'
and a-tuggin' one again' the other.

209
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,660
Now watch 'em.

210
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,540
Old Brother Left Hand.
Left Hand hates a-fightin'.

211
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,860
It looks like Love's a goner.

212
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,980
But wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

213
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,220
Love's a-winnin'.
Yes, sirree.

214
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,300
It's Love that won...

215
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,660
and old Left Hand Hate
is down for the count!

216
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,980
I never heard it better told.

217
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,900
I wish every soul in this community
could get the benefit.

218
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,900
Oh, you've just got to stay
for our picnic Sunday.

219
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,060
No, I must wend my way downriver
on the Lord's business.

220
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,700
You ain't leavin' in no hurry
if we can help it.

221
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,540
John, mind your manners.
Take that look off your face. Act nice.

222
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,860
Why, he don't mean
no impudence, do you, boy?

223
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,620
Do you, boy?

224
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,460
Many's the time poor Brother Ben
told me about these young 'uns.

225
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,940
What'd he tell you?

226
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,380
Why, he told me what fine little lambs
you and your sister both was.

227
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,940
Is that all?

228
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,020
Why, no, boy.
He told me lots and lots of things.

229
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,940
- Nice things, boy.
- Thank you.

230
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,780
My, that fudge smells yummy.

231
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,700
It's for the picnic.

232
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,380
And you don't get a smidgen of my fudge
unless you stay for the picnic.

233
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,380
Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves

234
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,780
We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves

235
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,980
Sowing in the morning
Sowing seeds of kindness

236
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,300
Sowing in the noontime
and the dewy eve

237
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,580
Waiting for the harvest
and the time of reaping

238
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,220
We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves

239
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,100
Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves

240
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,300
We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves

241
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,620
Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves

242
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,940
We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves

243
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,780
Don't he have the grandest
singin' voice?

244
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,660
John, Pearl,
run along and play, you two.

245
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,900
- Where?
- Down by the river. My goodness!

246
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,620
That f ella's just achin' to settle down
with some nice woman...

247
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,660
and make a home for himself.

248
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,180
Icey, it's awful soon
after Ben's passing.

249
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,540
- If ever I saw a sign from heaven.
- John don't like him much.

250
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,820
- Pearl dotes on him.
- The boy worries me.

251
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,380
I know it's silly, but it's like there's
something still between him and his dad.

252
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,940
What he needs
is a dose of sauce.

253
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,700
- No, there's somethin' else.
- What?

254
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,300
- The money.
- I declare, Willa Harper...

255
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,020
you'll let that money haunt you
to your grave.

256
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,020
Icey, I would
love to be satisfied...

257
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,780
that Harry Powell don't think I got
that money hid somewhere.

258
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,860
You come right out
and ask that man of God.

259
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,900
Mr. Powell! Clear that evil mud
out of your soul.

260
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,620
John! Pearl! Come along here,
get some fudge.

261
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,140
- I don't want no fudge.
- You do what you're told!

262
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,380
- You go sit down by the river.
- Oh, Icey, I'm a sight.

263
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,340
Get along with you.

264
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,420
You!

265
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,180
That young lady better look sharp,
or some smart sister...

266
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,780
is gonna snap him up
right from under her nose.

267
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,860
She's not the only fish
in the river.

268
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,060
Now, you two stay put.
Shilly-shallying around.

269
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,340
A husband's one piece of store goods
you never know...

270
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,500
till you get it home
and take the paper off.

271
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,180
Did Ben Harper ever tell you
what he done with the money he stole?

272
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,220
My dear child, don't you know?

273
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,580
She's moanin' about Ben Harper.

274
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,220
That wasn't love.
That was just flapdoodle.

275
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,140
Have some fudge, lambs.

276
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,100
When you've been married
to a man for 40 years...

277
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,660
you know all that don't amount
to a hill of beans.

278
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,420
I've been married to my Walt that long,
and I swear in all that time...

279
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,460
I just lie there
thinkin' about my canning.

280
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,740
A woman's a fool to marry for that.
That's somethin' for a man.

281
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,500
The Good Lord never meant
for a decent woman to want that.

282
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,660
Not really want it.

283
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,460
It's all just a fake
and a pipe dream.

284
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,060
John, Mr. Powell
has something to tell you.

285
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,100
Well, John, the night before
your father died...

286
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,540
he told me what he did
with that money.

287
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,020
That money's
at the bottom of the river...

288
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,460
wrapped around
a 12-pound cobblestone.

289
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,100
Thank you, Harry.

290
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
I f eel clean now.

291
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,820
My whole body's
just a-quiverin' with cleanness.

292
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,380
John, come here.

293
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Your tie is crooked.

294
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,500
Along the river shore

295
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,940
Birdie Steptoe was a pilot

296
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,860
In the good ol' days of yore

297
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,140
Now he sets in his ol' wharf boat

298
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,860
All the big boats heave a sigh

299
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,900
- When will Dad's skiff be ready?
- Can't hear you, boy.

300
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,460
They blow for Uncle Birdie and

301
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,860
The times that ere gone by

302
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,820
When will the skiff be ready?

303
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,820
Have her ready inside a week,
and then we'll go fishin'.

304
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,220
- How's your ma?
- Oh, she's all right.

305
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
- How's your sister Pearl?
- Just fine.

306
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,340
- You leavin', boy?
- Yep. Gotta watch out for Pearl.

307
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,140
Well, good night, boy.
Come again anytime.

308
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,820
And mind, boy, I'll have your pa's skiff
shipshape inside a week.

309
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,260
Is somebody there?

310
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,860
Anybody there?

311
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,900
Anybody here?

312
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Good evenin', John.

313
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,780
I had a little talk
with your mother tonight, John...

314
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,860
and your mother decided it might be best
for me to let you know the news.

315
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,500
Your mother told me she wanted me
to be a daddy to you and your sister.

316
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,580
We're gonna get married, boy.

317
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,420
Did you hear what I said, boy?
Married.

318
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,300
We're going to Sisterville tomorrow,
and when we get back--

319
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,860
You ain't my dad.
You'll never be my dad.

320
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,380
When we get back,
we're all going to be friends...

321
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,220
and share our fortunes
together, John.

322
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,540
You think you can make me tell,
but I won't, I won't, I won't!

323
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,740
- Tell me what, boy?
- Nothin'.

324
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,140
We're not keeping secrets
from each other, are we, little lad?

325
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,620
Well, no matter.
We've got a long time together, boy.

326
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,420
Raise your hand! Great sakes!

327
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,300
Now you wait here
while I get your night things.

328
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,740
- Now can I tell?
- Hmm?

329
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,940
Mr. Powell's our daddy now.
Can I tell him about--

330
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,860
- You swore, Pearl.
- John, don't.

331
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,900
You promised Dad
you wouldn't tell.

332
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,260
I love Mr. Powell
lots and lots, John.

333
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,420
Men.

334
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,860
Fix that window shade.

335
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,300
I was praying.

336
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,540
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I thought--

337
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,340
You thought, Willa, that
the moment you walked in that door...

338
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,340
I'd start to pawin' you
in that abominable way...

339
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,100
that men are supposed to do
on their weddin' night.

340
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,900
Ain't that right?

341
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,140
I think it's time we made on thing
perf ectly clear, Willa.

342
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,300
Marriage, to me, represents a blending
of two spirits in the sight of heaven.

343
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,500
Get up, Willa.

344
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,620
- Harry, what--
- Get up.

345
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,100
Now go look at yourself
yonder in that mirror.

346
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,780
Do as I say.

347
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,100
Look at yourself.

348
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,860
What do you see, girl?

349
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,780
You see the body of a woman,
a temple of creation and motherhood.

350
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,740
You see the flesh of Eve
that man since Adam has profaned.

351
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,060
That body was meant
for begettin' children.

352
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,260
It was not meant
for the lust of men.

353
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,620
Do you want more children, Willa?

354
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,180
It's the business of this marriage
to mind those two you have now...

355
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,140
not to beget more.

356
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,540
Yes.

357
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,500
All right, you can get in bed now
and stop shiverin'.

358
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,740
Help me to get clean...

359
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,740
so I can be
what Harry wants me to be.

360
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,860
Meanest, orneriest, sneakiest critter
in the whole river, boy.

361
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,300
The gar.

362
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,580
- Here's your can of hooks.
- P'shaw, boy.

363
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,980
Ain't a hook in the land
strong enough to land Mr. Gar.

364
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,140
What a f ellow needs
is a mother wit and a horsehair.

365
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,620
Golly, won't it bust it,
Uncle Birdie?

366
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,820
No, horsehair'll hold
a lumpin' whale.

367
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,300
- You mind my cussin', boy?
- No.

368
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,020
Well, the reason I ask--
Your step-pa bein' a preacher and all.

369
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,660
Never was much of a one
for preachin' myself.

370
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,700
I don't know what's wrong
up at your house...

371
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,300
but always remember, cap...

372
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,660
if you're ever in trouble,
holler and come a-runnin'.

373
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,820
Uncle Birdie's your friend.

374
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,420
There! You slimy, snag-toothed,
bait-stealin' so-and-so!

375
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,380
Amen!

376
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,980
You have all sinned!

377
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,980
Which one of you can say,
as I can say...

378
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,700
that you drove a good man
to murder?

379
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,940
Because I kept a-houndin' him...

380
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,340
for perfume and clothes
and face paint.

381
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,580
And he slew two human beings...

382
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,620
and he come to me and he said...

383
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,460
"Take this money and buy yourself
the clothes and the paint."

384
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,340
But brethren, brethren...

385
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,020
that's where the Lord stepped in.

386
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,540
Yes!

387
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,460
He said, the Lord to that man...

388
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,460
"You take that money
and you throw it in the river."

389
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,220
- In the river!
- In the river!

390
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,500
Now, you're John and you're Pearl.

391
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,700
You'll get awful mad, John.
I done a sin.

392
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,260
I didn't tell no one.

393
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,260
It's all here.

394
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,100
- Oh, yes?
- What are you doing, boy?

395
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,700
- Gettin' Pearl to bed.
- What's takin' you so long about it?

396
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,140
Nothing.

397
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,860
- What's that you're playin' with?
- Pearl's junk.

398
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,060
Mom gets mad when she plays out here
and don't put it away.

399
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,980
Come on, children.

400
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,660
Off to bed with the both of you.

401
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,660
Come here, John.

402
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,980
Your mother tells me
you tattled on me.

403
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,500
She said you told her
I asked where that money was hid.

404
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,260
That wasn't very nice, boy.

405
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,620
- Have a heart.
- Yeah.

406
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,780
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's your word against mine.

407
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,820
It's me your mother believes.

408
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,780
Were you impudent again
to Mr. Powell, John?

409
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,060
Mom, I didn't mean it.

410
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,540
What were you impudent about?

411
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,660
He asked me
about the money again, Mom.

412
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,060
John, you always make up that lie.
There is no money.

413
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,100
Why can't you get that
through your head?

414
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,820
That boy's as stubborn
and as mulish as a sheep.

415
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,940
- It's a shame.
- Good night, Icey.

416
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,980
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Walt.

417
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,260
Good night, Willa.

418
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,580
Plan on a longer visit next time.

419
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,340
You hardly get settled before
you're frettin' to get home again.

420
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,980
I'm needed to keep peace
and harmony betwixt them.

421
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,820
It's my burden,
and I'm proud of it, Icey.

422
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,780
- Where is the money hid?
- I don't know.

423
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,580
She thinks that money's
at the bottom of the river.

424
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,100
But you and me, we know better,
don't we, little lad?

425
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,140
I don't know nothin'.

426
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,660
Well, never mind, boy.
Summer's young yet.

427
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,260
Come here.

428
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,420
John's a f ellow
that likes to keep secrets.

429
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,900
- I'll tell you a secret.
- Yes?

430
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,380
I knowed your daddy.

431
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,340
And do you know
what your daddy told me?

432
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,500
He said,
"You tell my little girl Pearl...

433
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,220
that there's to be no secrets
between her and you."

434
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,700
- Yes.
- All right, now it's your turn.

435
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,620
What secret shall I tell?

436
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,180
Oh, uh, what's your name?

437
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,340
You're just foolin'.
My name's Pearl.

438
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,660
Well, I reckon I'll have to try again.
Where's the money hid?

439
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,460
Pearl, you swore you wouldn't tell!
You swore! You swore!

440
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,180
You hit Daddy with a hairbrush.

441
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,460
Now, you see, we just can't have
anything to do with John.

442
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,860
You and me'll go on down
to the parlor, Pearl.

443
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,940
John is just plumb bad,
through and through.

444
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,980
- John's bad.
- Yes, John's bad.

445
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,460
Tell me another secret
about my dad.

446
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,300
Oh, no. Your turn.

447
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,540
Well, like,
what secret shall I tell?

448
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,940
Where's the money hid?

449
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,900
- John's bad.
- Where's the money hid?

450
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,620
Tell me, you little wretch,
or I'll tear your arm off!

451
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,980
- Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
- How do you mean?

452
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,700
Well, I'm figurin' how to say it
so as you won't get mad.

453
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,700
Say what, Walt Spoon?

454
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,860
- There's somethin' wrong about it.
- About what?

455
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,620
About Mr. Powell.
All of it.

456
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,820
Now, Mother, a body's
got a right to their f eelings.

457
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,060
May the Lord have mercy on you,
Walt Spoon.

458
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,340
Mother, I was just--

459
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,700
Amen.

460
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,820
- Are you through praying?
- I'm through, Harry.

461
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,420
You were listening
outside the parlor window.

462
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,740
- It ain't in the river, is it, Harry?
- Answer me!

463
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,460
Ben never told you
he throwed it in the river, did he?

464
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,260
The children know where it's hid.

465
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,940
John knows.
Is that it, Harry?

466
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,740
Then it's still here
amongst us...

467
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,140
tainting us.

468
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,740
You must've known about it
all along, Harry.

469
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,340
But that ain't the reason
why you married me.

470
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,300
I know that much.

471
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,260
Because the Lord
just wouldn't let it be.

472
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,140
He made you marry me...

473
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,780
so you could show me
the way and the lif e...

474
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,260
and the salvation of my soul.

475
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,420
Ain't that so, Harry.

476
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,140
So you might say that it was the money
that brung us together.

477
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,980
The rest of it don't matter.

478
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,620
Walt, come quick!

479
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,340
- What's wrong, Mother?
- Shhh! He's in there.

480
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,780
- Who?
- Mr. Powell.

481
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,780
Willa has run away.

482
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,300
Just went?

483
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,980
She took off some time in the night
in that old Model-T.

484
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,380
- Oh, is he hit pretty bad?
- All to pieces.

485
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,460
Well, there's a little
peach brandy in here--

486
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,940
- A man of the cloth?
- Well, just a sip.

487
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,140
Walt Spoon,
that's for sickness in the house!

488
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,660
What can we do, Mother?

489
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,740
I thought if you went
and talked to him.

490
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,220
Now, Mother, please.
I'm no good--

491
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,860
- Mr. Powell.
- A strange woman is a narrow pit.

492
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,860
She lieth in wait as for pray and
increaseth the transgressors among men.

493
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,980
My dear, dear friends,
whatever would I do without you?

494
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,100
- Mr. Powell.
- Well, if there's anything--

495
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,660
No, it's my shame, my crown of thorns.
I must wear it bravely.

496
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,100
- What could have possessed that girl?
- Satan.

497
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,780
Didn't you have no inkling?

498
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,060
Yes I did,
from the very first night.

499
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,780
- First night?
- Our honeymoon.

500
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,820
How's that?

501
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,180
She turned me out of the bed.

502
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,380
No!

503
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,660
Well, what do you figure to do?

504
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,620
Do? Why, just stay right here
and take care of them kids.

505
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,860
Maybe it was never meant for a woman
like Willa to taint their young lives.

506
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,380
That's mighty brave of you, preacher.

507
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,940
Oh, I reckon it was just
ordained that way, Brother Spoon.

508
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,540
Didn't she leave no word?

509
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,140
A scrawl, on a notepaper
on the bureau.

510
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,060
I burned it.

511
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,700
Tore it up and burned it,
it stank so strong of hellfire.

512
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,540
Amen!

513
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,660
The pitcher has went to the well
once too often, friends.

514
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,220
Oh, she'll come
draggin' her tail back home.

515
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,980
She'll not be back.
I reckon I'm saf e in promisin' you that.

516
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,220
- Maybe she just run offon a spree.
- Oh, no.

517
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,220
- Well, there's no harm in hoping.
- Ain't no sense in it, neither.

518
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,860
I figured somethin' like that was
brewin' when she went to bed last night.

519
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,980
How?

520
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,180
Well, she tarried around in the kitchen
after I'd gone up.

521
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,260
- When I went to see what was wrong--
- What?

522
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,140
Well, she'd found this jar
of dandelion wine...

523
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,500
that the husband, that Harper,
had hid somewhere in the cellar.

524
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,860
She was drinkin'.

525
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,340
- I tried to save her.
- I know you did, Mr. Powell.

526
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,340
I know how hard you tried.

527
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,140
But the Devil wins sometimes.

528
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,500
Can't nobody say I didn't do
my best to save her.

529
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,460
Leaning

530
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,060
Saf e and secure from all alarm

531
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,540
Leaning

532
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,340
Leaning on the everlasting Arm

533
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,060
Children!

534
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,860
Careful.

535
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,420
Why do we have to hide, John?

536
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,780
- Where's Mom?
- She's gone to Moundsville.

537
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,940
- To see Dad?
- Yes, I reckon that's it.

538
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,500
Now, listen to me, Pearl.
You and me is runnin' off tonight.

539
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,780
Why?

540
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,140
If we stay here,
somethin' awful will happen to us.

541
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,340
- Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
- No.

542
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,060
That's just it. No.

543
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,820
- Where are we going, John?
- Somewhere. I don't know yet.

544
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,180
- I'm hungry, John.
- We'll steal something to eat.

545
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,460
It'll spoil our supper.

546
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,780
I can hear you whisperin', children,
so I know you're down there.

547
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,700
I can f eel myself gettin' awful mad.

548
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,940
I'm out of patience, children.
I'm coming to find you now.

549
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,620
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Powell!

550
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,340
- Well, well, Mrs. Spoon.
- Where are the children?

551
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,500
They're down there
in that cellar playin' games.

552
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,420
They won't mind me when I call them.
I'm at my wit's end, Mrs. Spoon.

553
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,460
Shake a leg!

554
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,460
Well, well, well. What's that?

555
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,900
Just a little hot supper
I fixed for you and the children.

556
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,500
It seemed the least we could do.

557
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,540
I won't have you worryin'
poor Mr. Powell another minute.

558
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,580
Just look at you.
Dust and filth from top to toe.

559
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,180
Want me to take 'em up
and wash 'em good?

560
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,380
No, thank you, dear Icey.
Thank you. I'll tend to them.

561
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,780
Don't be too hard on them, preacher.
Poor, motherless children.

562
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,820
Remember now, Mr. Powell,
don't be afraid to call on us.

563
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,940
Good-bye, Mrs. Spoon,
and thanks again.

564
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,260
Now, weren't you afraid, little lambs,
down there in all that dark?

565
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,580
They'll think it was me.

566
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,740
They'll think it was
poor old Uncle Birdie.

567
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,180
Oh, if you could've seen her, Bess.

568
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,460
Down there in the deep place...

569
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,900
with her hair wavin' soft and lazy...

570
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,300
like meadow grass under floodwater.

571
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,900
And that slit in her throat...

572
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,500
like she had an extra mouth.

573
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,900
You're the only human mortal
I can go to, Bess.

574
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,180
If I go to the law,
they'll hang it on me.

575
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,260
Sweet heaven,
save poor old Uncle Birdie.

576
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,780
- I'm hungry.
- Sure.

577
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,780
And there's fried chicken, sweet
potatoes, corn bread and apple cobbler.

578
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,620
- Can I have my supper, please?
- Naturally.

579
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,060
- Can I have milk too?
- Mm-hmm.

580
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,380
But first we'll have a little talk
about our secrets.

581
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,740
- No.
- And why not, pray tell?

582
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,860
- 'Cause John said I mustn't.
- Never mind what John said!

583
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,980
John's a meddler.

584
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,340
Now, stop that snivelin'.

585
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,300
Here. Do you know what that is?

586
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,500
Want to see something cute?
Now look.

587
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,180
How about that?

588
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,940
This is what I use on meddlers.

589
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,140
John might be a meddler.

590
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,300
No! No, little lamb,
don't touch it.

591
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,580
Don't touch my knif e.
That makes me mad.

592
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,380
It makes me very, very mad.

593
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,340
Now just tell me,
where's the money hid?

594
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,820
But I swore, I promised John
I wouldn't tell.

595
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,620
John doesn't matter!

596
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,540
Can't I get that through your head,
you poor, silly disgusting wretch?

597
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,340
There, now, you made me
lose my temper.

598
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,380
I'm sorry. I'm real sorry.

599
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,620
Just tell me, where's it hid, honey?

600
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,100
- I'll tell.
- I told you to keep your mouth shut.

601
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,780
It ain't fair to make Pearl tell
when she swore she wouldn't.

602
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,860
- I'll tell.
- Well, I declare.

603
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,700
Sometimes I think poor old John
might make it to heaven yet.

604
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,260
All right, boy,
where's the money?

605
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,260
In the cellar, buried
under a stone in the floor.

606
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,340
It'll go hard if I find
you're lying, boy.

607
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,780
I'm not lying.
Go look for yourself.

608
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,420
All right.

609
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,620
- Come along.
- What?

610
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,740
Go ahead of me, the both of you.

611
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,380
Down those stairs.

612
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,980
You don't reckon I'd leave here,
do you, boy?

613
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,060
- Don't you believe me?
- Why, sure, boy. Sure.

614
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,180
Where, now?

615
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,220
Mind, no tricks, now.
I can't abide a liar.

616
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,740
Yonder.

617
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,420
Oh, no, you don't.

618
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,060
Now, where, boy? Where?

619
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,700
Under the stone on the floor.

620
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,540
- This is concrete!
- John made a sin.

621
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,460
John told a lie.

622
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,540
The Lord's a-talkin' to me now.

623
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,260
He's a-sayin'...

624
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,660
"A liar is an abomination
before Mine eyes."

625
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,820
Speak, boy.
Where's it hid?

626
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,780
Speak!

627
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,820
Speak, or I'll cut your throat
and leave you to drip...

628
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,100
like a hog hung up
in butcherin' time.

629
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,380
Pearl, Shut up!
Pearl, You swore!

630
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,380
You could save him, little bird.

631
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,340
It's on my doll!

632
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,020
The doll!

633
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,100
Why, sure.

634
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,420
Last place anybody'd think to look.

635
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,380
Uncle Birdie Steptoe.

636
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,420
Open that door, you spawn
of the devil's own strumpet!

637
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,660
Uncle Birdie!

638
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,140
Hide us, Uncle Birdie!
He's a-comin' with his knif e!

639
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:03,060
It's me. John Harper and Pearl.
You told me to come.

640
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,700
Oh, please!

641
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,620
Please wake up!

642
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,780
I swear on the Book,
I never done it.

643
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,700
I never--

644
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,860
There's still the river.

645
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,540
The skiff is under the willows.

646
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,580
Children!

647
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,900
Once upon a time

648
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:39,180
There was a pretty fly

649
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,900
He had a pretty wif e

650
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,300
This pretty fly

651
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:50,340
But one day she flew away

652
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,260
Flew away

653
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,220
She had two pretty

654
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,980
Children

655
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,100
But one night

656
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,940
These two pretty children

657
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,860
Flew away

658
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,900
Into the sky

659
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,580
Into the moon

660
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,300
"Dear Walt and Icey,
I bet you've been worried...

661
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,540
and gave us up for lost.

662
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,620
Took the kids down here with me
for a visit...

663
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,820
to my sister Elsie's farm.

664
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,820
Thought a little change of scenery
would do us all a world of good...

665
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,860
after so much trouble and heartache.

666
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,620
At least the kids will get
a-plenty of good home cookin'.

667
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,740
Your devoted Harry Powell."

668
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,860
Now, ain't you relieved, Walt?

669
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,100
Sure. But you was worried too, Mother.

670
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,820
Takin' off with never a word
of good-bye.

671
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,180
I got to figurin' maybe them gypsies
busted in and done off with all of them.

672
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,660
You and your gypsies.
They've been gone a week.

673
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,580
Sure. But not before one of them knif ed
a farmer and stole his horse.

674
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,100
Never caught the gypsy,
nor the horse.

675
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,900
Such times
when young 'uns run the roads.

676
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,860
Go away, children.

677
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:50,820
Hungry, I suppose. Well, I can't
spare you more than one potato apiece.

678
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,500
- Where are your folks?
- I ain't got none.

679
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,980
Oh, go away. Go away.

680
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:08,780
An ungrateful child is an abomination
before the eyes of God.

681
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,700
The world is fast
going to damnation...

682
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,220
because of impudent young 'uns
flyin' in the face of age.

683
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,220
I make soup out of them...

684
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,820
but I wouldn't know how
to go about getting him open.

685
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,260
We're gonna spend the night on land.

686
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,980
Hush, little one

687
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,420
Hush

688
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,900
Hush, my little one

689
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,740
Hush

690
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,580
Morning soon

691
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:18,060
Shall light your pillow

692
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,060
Birds will sing

693
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,420
In yonder

694
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,900
Willow

695
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,740
Hush, my little one

696
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,300
Hush

697
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,140
Are we going home now, John?

698
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,780
Rest, dearest one

699
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,620
Rest

700
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,420
Rest here

701
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,580
On my breast

702
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,580
Little child

703
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:09,300
With heart so brave

704
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,780
Angel hosts

705
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:16,660
Will keep you saf e

706
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,780
Rest, my little one

707
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,300
Rest

708
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:28,900
Rest, little one

709
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,940
Rest

710
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,660
Leaning

711
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,820
Saf e and secure

712
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,900
From all alarm

713
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,100
Leaning

714
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,540
Leaning on

715
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,020
The Everlasting

716
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,180
Arm

717
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,740
What a f ellowship

718
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,900
What a peace is mine

719
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,180
Leaning on

720
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,580
- The Everlasting Arm
- Don't he never sleep?

721
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,980
What a blessedness

722
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,180
What a joy divine

723
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,140
Pearl! Wake up!
Come on! Pearl!

724
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,220
The Everlasting Arm

725
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,820
Leaning

726
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,540
You two youngsters get up
to me this instant.

727
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,900
Get on up to my house!
Mind me, now!

728
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,900
I'll get me a switch.

729
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,580
- Don't you hurt her!
- Hurt her, nothing.

730
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,100
Wash her's more like it.

731
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:59,180
- Ruby! Clary! Mary!
- Yes, Miss Cooper?

732
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,900
Bring your baskets.

733
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,660
Nicely picked, Clary.

734
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:10,300
Mary, put the big ones on top.

735
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,500
Ruby, most of them ain't fit
to go to market.

736
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:15,660
Well, put your baskets down.
Ruby, run to the house...

737
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,100
and f etch the tub
and put it by the pump.

738
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,220
Clary, Mary, run up and f etch
a bar of laundry soap.

739
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,780
- Yes, Miss Cooper.
- And a scrub brush.

740
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,940
Come on up to the house, children.

741
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,740
Gracious, if you ain't
a sight to beat all.

742
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,660
Where are you from?

743
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,260
Where are your folks?

744
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,460
Come on. Speak up, now.

745
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,540
Gracious, so I've got
two more mouths to f eed.

746
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,020
Howdy, Miss Cooper.
What happened to our milk supply?

747
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,860
Price of milk what it is,
not on your lif e.

748
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,340
Do better makin' butter with the cream.
Sell it retail.

749
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:17,700
Make smearcase for the children.
Feed what's left to my hogs.

750
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,180
- She talks to herself.
- All the time.

751
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,420
- Your ma's funny.
- She ain't our ma.

752
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,220
- We just live at her house.
- Where are your folks?

753
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:29,220
- Someplace.
- My daddy's in Detroit.

754
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:38,340
Good morning, Miss Cooper. Guess what?
I'm savin' to buy you a charm bracelet.

755
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,300
Never mind the talk. Don't forget your
visit Sunday. Come to church with us.

756
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,740
See you Sunday, love.

757
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:49,300
Take your baskets in, children.

758
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,580
Reminiscent fools.

759
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:52,980
All of 'em.

760
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,660
Look there.

761
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,580
She'll be losing her mind
to a tricky mouth and a full moon...

762
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:03,140
and like as not,
I'll be saddled with the consequences.

763
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,540
Here's what you owe me.

764
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,260
One, two, three, four, five.

765
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,420
Where's the other basket?
Where's Ruby?

766
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,900
- She went.
- John, you go find Ruby.

767
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,900
Big Ruby's my bothersome girl.

768
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,860
She can't gather eggs
without bustin' 'em...

769
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,620
but she's got mother hands with
a young 'un, so what are you to say?

770
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,420
How about tonight, Ruby?

771
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,700
- What gives?
- The old lady's around.

772
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,100
How about Thursday?

773
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:35,180
The old gal thinks she comes in
for sewing lessons on Thursday.

774
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,220
Miss Cooper wants you.

775
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,060
And will you show me
your dolly, little lady?

776
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,180
- I see you got two more to your brood.
- Yeah...

777
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,220
- and ornerier than the rest.
- How's your own boy, Miss Cooper?

778
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:52,940
Haven't heard from Ralph
since Christmas. Don't matter, though.

779
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,580
I've got a new crop.

780
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:58,940
I'm a strong tree
with branches for many birds.

781
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:02,260
I'm good for something in this world,
and I know it too.

782
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,260
Now, old Pharaoh...

783
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,980
he was king of Egypt-land.

784
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,940
And he had a daughter.

785
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,140
And once upon a time...

786
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,180
she was walkin' along by the riverbank,
and she seen somethin'...

787
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:41,020
bumpin' and scrapin' along
on a sandbar...

788
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,700
down under the willows.

789
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,540
- And you know what it was, children?
- No.

790
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,580
Now, it was a skiff
washed up on the bar.

791
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,940
- And who do you reckon was in it?
- Pearl and John.

792
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,700
Not this time.
There was only one young 'un--

793
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,100
a little boy babe.

794
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,060
- And you know who he was, children?
- No.

795
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:06,740
It was Moses, a king of men.

796
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,460
Moses, children.

797
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,820
Now, off to bed with you.

798
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,860
John, get me an apple.

799
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:32,620
And get one for yourself too.

800
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,180
John, where are your folks?

801
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,660
- Dead.
- Dead.

802
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,180
Where you from?

803
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,820
Upriver.

804
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,420
Didn't figure you'd rode that skiff
all the way up from Parkersburg.

805
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,260
Tell me that story again.

806
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,300
Story? What story, honey?

807
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,020
About them kings.

808
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,700
And the queen found down on the sandbar
that time in the skiff.

809
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:29,100
Kings? Why, there was only
one king, honey.

810
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,980
I mind you said there was two.

811
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,340
Well, shoot, now.
Maybe there was.

812
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,940
Yes, come to think of it,
there was two.

813
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,860
Must be Thursday.
Here comes Ruby.

814
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,540
Here I go.

815
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,980
Why, you're Ruby,
ain't you, my child?

816
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,140
- Can I have this?
- Surely.

817
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:29,020
- I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
- Will you buy me an ice cream?

818
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,900
- Of course.
- Watch out, Preacher.

819
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,940
- Why, Preacher!
- Shut your dirty mouths.

820
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:47,740
-Ain't I pretty?
-You're the prettiest thing I've seen...

821
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,140
in all my wanderin'.

822
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,780
Ain't nobody ever told you that, Ruby?

823
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,660
No one never did.

824
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:58,180
There's two new ones
out at your place, ain't there?

825
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,620
Uh-huh.

826
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,780
- What's their names?
- Pearl and John.

827
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:08,300
- Is there a doll?
- Only they never let me play with it.

828
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,780
Did you ever see such pretty eyes
in all your born days?

829
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,940
- Don't let him get away, sugar.
- He ain't like you all.

830
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:24,900
Next time I won't even ask him
to buy me an ice cream.

831
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,180
I's been bad.

832
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,940
Ruby, you didn't have money
to buy this.

833
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,580
- You'll whip me.
- When did I ever?

834
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,620
- This man at the drugstore, he gave--
- The drugstore?

835
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,620
Miss Cooper, I never been
to sewing lessons all them times.

836
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,100
What you been up to, Ruby?

837
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,100
I've been out with men.

838
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,300
Child.

839
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:07,620
You were looking for love, Ruby,
in the only foolish way you knew how.

840
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,220
We all need love, Ruby.

841
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,740
I lost the love of my son.

842
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,860
I found it with you all.

843
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:23,820
You're gonna grow up to be
a strong, fine woman...

844
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,060
and I'm gonna see that you do.

845
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:30,460
The gentleman weren't like them. He just
give me a book and buy me ice cream.

846
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,540
- Now, who was this?
- He didn't ask me for nothin'.

847
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:37,220
- What did you talk about?
- Pearl and John.

848
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,380
John and Pearl?
Is he their pap?

849
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:43,140
I don't know.

850
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,500
Wonder why he hasn't been
to the house.

851
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:06,020
- Miss Cooper! Miss Cooper!
- What?

852
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,380
The man! The man!

853
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:14,100
Good mornin', ladies.

854
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:17,780
- How do?
- Why, you're Miss Cooper, I take it.

855
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,140
It's about that John
and that Pearl?

856
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,260
Oh, them poor little lambs.

857
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,700
To think I never hoped to see them
again in this world.

858
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:27,340
Oh, dear madam,
if you was to know...

859
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:31,980
what a crown of thorns I've borne
in my search for them strayed chicks.

860
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,140
Ruby, go f etch them kids.

861
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,260
Oh, madam, I see
you're looking at my hands.

862
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:42,220
Would you like me
to tell you a story...

863
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,620
of left hand and right hand,
the tale of good and evil?

864
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,500
It was with this left hand that
old brother Cain struck the blow...

865
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:50,100
- that laid his brother low.
- Them kids is yours?

866
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:54,020
- My own flesh and blood.
- Where's your missus?

867
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:58,540
She run off with a drummer
during prayer meeting.

868
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,740
- Where's she at?
- Down the river somewheres.

869
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:04,220
Parkersburg or Cincinnati--
one of them Sodoms of the Ohio River.

870
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,300
She took them kids with her?

871
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,820
Heaven only knows
what unholy sights and sounds...

872
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,740
them innocent
little babes has heard...

873
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:13,100
in the dens of perdition
where she dragged 'em.

874
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:16,780
Right funny, ain't it, how they rode
all the way upriver in a ten-foot boat?

875
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:22,860
- Are they well, Miss Cooper?
- A sight better than they was.

876
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:28,020
Gracious, gracious, you are
a good woman, Miss Cooper.

877
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,580
How you figurin' to raise
them two without a woman?

878
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,860
The Lord will provide.

879
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,500
The Lord is merciful.

880
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,820
Oh, what a day this is.

881
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,820
And there's little John.

882
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,580
- What's wrong, John?
- Come to me, boy.

883
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,340
- What's wrong, John?
- Didn't you hear me, boy?

884
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,820
John, when your dad says come,
you should mind him.

885
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,780
He ain't my dad.

886
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,980
No, and he ain't
no preacher, neither.

887
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,980
Just march yourself yonder
to your horse, mister!

888
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,860
March, mister!
I'm not foolin'!

889
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:18,060
All right, but you haven't heard
the last of Harry Powell yet.

890
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:21,340
The Lord God Jehovah will guide
my hand in vengeance!

891
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,860
You devils!

892
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,140
You whores of Babylon!

893
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,500
I'll be back when it's dark.

894
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,260
Leaning

895
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,940
Saf e and secure

896
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:57,820
From all alarms

897
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,700
Leaning

898
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,300
Leaning on

899
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:11,700
The Everlasting Arms

900
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,980
What a f ellowship

901
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,260
What a joy divine

902
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:24,180
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms

903
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,300
What a blessedness

904
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:31,180
What a peace is mine

905
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:36,940
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms

906
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:40,060
- Leaning on Jesus
- Leaning

907
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:47,500
Saf e and secure from all

908
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:50,220
Alarms

909
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,660
- Leaning on Jesus
- Leaning

910
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,660
Leaning on

911
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:05,260
The Everlasting Arms

912
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:11,220
Shame on you, Ruby, mooning around
the house after that mad dog of a man.

913
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,900
Merciful heavens!

914
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,660
Ruby, go get the children out of bed
and bring them down here.

915
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,660
Women is such durn fools.

916
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,500
It's a hard world for little things.

917
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:08,780
Now, there was this sneaking
no-account, ornery King Herod.

918
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,500
And when he heard tell of
little Jesus growin' up, he figured...

919
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,660
"Well, shoot. There won't be
no room for the both of us.

920
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:16,580
I'll just nip this in the bud."

921
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:19,900
But he wasn't sure which of all those
babies in the land was King Jesus.

922
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,380
So that cruel old
King Herod figured...

923
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:26,020
if he killed all the babies in the land,
he'd be sure and get little Jesus.

924
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,060
And when little King Jesus' ma and pa
heard about this plan...

925
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,780
- what do you reckon they went and done?
- They hid in a broom closet.

926
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:35,700
- They hid under the porch.
- No. They went a-runnin'.

927
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:39,460
Well, now, John, you're right.
That's just what they done.

928
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,900
Little King Jesus' ma and pa
saddled a mule...

929
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:44,380
and they rode all the way down
into Egypt-land.

930
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,660
Yeah. And that's where the queen
found them in the billy rushes.

931
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,820
Oh, no. That wasn't the same story
at all. That was little King Moses.

932
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,580
But just the same, it did seem like
it was plague time for little ones.

933
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:57,540
Them olden days.
Them hard, hard times.

934
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,060
Figured I was gone, huh?

935
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,940
Run! Hide in the staircase!
Run quick!

936
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:11,260
Ruby, get!

937
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:14,260
- What do you want?
- I want them kids.

938
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:17,340
- What do you want them for?
- That's none of your business, madam.

939
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,420
I'm givin' you till the count of three
to get out of here, then I'm shootin'!

940
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,820
Miss Booher? Rachel Cooper.

941
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,940
Get your state troopers
out to my place.

942
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,420
I got something trapped
in my barn.

943
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:55,460
- I'll go see to Pearl.
- I'll make coff ee.

944
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,660
She's all right.

945
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,900
John, you know, when you're little,
you have more endurance...

946
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:13,500
than God is ever
to grant you again?

947
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:16,500
Children are man at his strongest.
They abide.

948
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:33,140
- Why didn't you call us before now?
- Didn't want your dirty shoes...

949
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,420
- trackin' up my clean floors.
- Is that him, ma'am?

950
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:38,220
Yes. Mind where you shoot, boys.
There are children here.

951
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:41,900
Harry Powell, you're under arrest
for the murder of Willa Harper.

952
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,260
Drop that knif e.

953
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,500
Don't!

954
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,860
Here, here, take it back!

955
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:00,580
Take it back! I don't want it, Dad!
It's too much!

956
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:01,900
Here!

957
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,860
Lynch him!

958
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:17,740
- Bluebeard!
- Twenty-five wives!

959
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,540
And he killed them all!

960
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:22,500
- If the people of Marshall County--
- Bluebeard!

961
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,180
Will you identify the prisoner?

962
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:35,140
Please, little lad, won't you look
yonder and tell the court...

963
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,700
if that is the man
that killed your mother?

964
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:48,420
It's all right, Mrs. Cooper.
You can take the little f ellow away.

965
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,740
Merry Christmas to you and yours,
Mrs. Cooper.

966
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:53,820
And what's Santa Claus going to bring
you for Christmas, little man?

967
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,620
Bluebeard!

968
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:07,940
- There's Pearl!
- Get your coats.

969
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,020
Them's her orphans!

970
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:11,660
- Where's Ruby?
- She went.

971
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:14,500
Them poor little lambs!

972
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:18,540
Them is the ones
he sinned against, my friends!

973
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,460
Go out the back door!

974
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,780
Ain't we goin' to the bus depot?

975
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,460
Draggin' the name of the Lord
through the evil mud of his soul!

976
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:35,580
- String that Bluebeard up to a post!
- He's Satan hiding behind the cross!

977
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,380
Come on!

978
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:23,940
I love him.
You think he's like them others.

979
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:31,740
You were so mad, you shot him!

980
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,740
- Hey, Bart.
- Yeah?

981
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:52,460
- We're savin' this bird up for you.
- This time it'll be a privilege.

982
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,980
I'm glad they didn't send me nothin'.
Whenever they do, it's nothin' I want...

983
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:23,620
but just somethin' to show me how fancy
and smart they've come up in the world.

984
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,780
- Can we give you your presents now?
- Shoot.

985
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:35,340
You don't mean to say
you got me a present.

986
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,940
Shoot, now.

987
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,980
A potholder.

988
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,900
And it's much neater
than last year, Ruby.

989
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:55,220
Another potholder!

990
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:58,580
Now, ain't that thoughtful.
I'm always burning my hands.

991
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,420
This doesn't look basted.
This looks made!

992
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,980
And you finished the edge
with a chain-stitch.

993
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:09,100
Oh, that's just dandy, Clary.

994
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:13,620
Another potholder?

995
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:21,420
Oh, now, did you two
make this together?

996
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,980
You helped us some.

997
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:34,740
That's the richest gift
a body could have.

998
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:39,460
And your presents are in the cupboard
under the china closet.

999
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,220
This is yours.

1000
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,060
Lord, save little children.

1001
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:07,140
You'd think the world would be ashamed
to name such a day as Christmas...

1002
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:10,100
for one of them and then go on
in the same old way.

1003
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:15,780
My soul is humbled when I see the way
little ones accept their lot.

1004
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,180
Lord, save little children.

1005
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,340
The wind blows,
and the rains are cold.

1006
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:24,140
Yet they abide.

1007
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:53,780
That watch is sure
a fine, loud ticker.

1008
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:59,060
Be nice to have someone around the house
who can give me the right time of day.

1009
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,380
This watch is the nicest watch
I ever had.

1010
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:07,180
Well, a fellow can't just go around
with run-down, busted watches.

1011
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:16,100
They abide and they endure.
