1
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,593
Now, you remember, children,
how I told you

2
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,031
about the good Lord going up into the
mountain and talking to the people?

3
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,318
And how he said: "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God"?

4
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,392
And how he said
that King Solomon in all his glory

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,438
was not as beautiful as
the lilies of the field?

6
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,035
And I know you won't forget
"Judge not lest ye be judged",

7
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,151
because I explained that to you.

8
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,470
And then the good Lord went on to say:

9
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,031
"Beware of false prophets

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,069
which come to you in sheep's clothing

11
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,994
but inwardly they are ravening wolves."

12
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,069
"Ye shall know them by their fruits."

13
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,671
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,071
45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,318
75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100!

16
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,471
Here I come, ready or not.

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,191
What's wrong?

18
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,353
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,

19
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,517
neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit."

20
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,350
"Wherefore by their fruits
ye shall know them."

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,431
Well now, what's it to be, Lord?

22
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,911
Another widow?

23
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,271
How many's it been? Six?

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,911
Twelve?

25
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,351
I disremember.

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,830
You say the word, Lord. I'm on my way.

27
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,715
You always send me money
to go forth and preach your word.

28
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,109
A widow with a little wad of bills
hid away in the sugar bowl.

29
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,511
Lord, I am tired.

30
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,593
Sometimes I wonder
if you really understand.

31
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,388
Not that you mind the killings.
Your book is full of killings.

32
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,630
But there are things you do hate, Lord.

33
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,711
Perfume-smelling things.

34
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,390
Lacy things. Things with curly hair.

35
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,631
There are too many of them.

36
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,911
You can't kill a world.

37
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,677
You driving a touring car
with a Moundsville license?

38
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,228
Harry Powell,
for the theft of that touring car

39
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,312
you'll spend 30 days
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

40
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,359
- Preacher Harry Powell.
- A car thief. Picked up where you were.

41
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,952
A man of God? Harry Powell...

42
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,552
Hold Miss Jenny still.

43
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,631
Stand still, Miss Jenny.

44
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,870
There. What's so hard about that?

45
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,671
Daddy!

46
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,070
- Where's your mom?
- Out shopping.

47
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,669
You're bleeding, Dad.

48
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,390
Listen. We have to hide this money before
they get to me. There's close to $10,000.

49
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,313
Where? Under a rock
in the smokehouse? No, no.

50
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,719
Under the bricks in the grape arbor.
No, no. They'd dig for it.

51
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,071
Sure. That's the place.

52
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,271
- That's him.
- He probably still has that gun.

53
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,837
Listen to me, son. You've got to swear.
Swear means promise.

54
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,037
First swear you'll take care of little Pearl.
Guard her with your life, boy.

55
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,714
Then swear you won't never tell where
the money's hid. Not even your mom.

56
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,119
- Yes, Dad.
- You understand?

57
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,839
- Not even her?
- You've got common sense, she ain't.

58
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,876
When you grow up
that money'll belong to you.

59
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,599
Now stand up straight.
Raise your right hand.

60
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,912
- Now swear. I'll guard Pearl with my life.
- I will guard Pearl with my life.

61
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,915
- And I won't never tell about the money.
- And I won't never tell about the money.

62
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,191
You, Pearl. You swear too.

63
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,191
Ben Harper.

64
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,160
I'm going now, children. Goodbye.

65
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,435
Drop that gun, Harper.
We don't want the kids hurt.

66
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,034
Just mind what you swore, son.
Mind, boy.

67
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,431
Don't.

68
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,791
Don't!

69
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,151
Dad.

70
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,273
Ben Harper, it is the sentence of this court

71
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,713
that for the murder of Ed Smiley
and Corey South

72
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,473
you be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

73
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,671
May God have mercy on your soul.

74
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,551
I got you all buffaloed.

75
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,954
You ain't none of you
gonna get it out of me.

76
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,431
Where, Ben? Where?

77
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,116
Where?

78
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,350
And a little child shall lead them.

79
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,951
Come on, boy. Tell me.

80
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,558
Ben! I'm a man of God.

81
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,552
- Making me talk about it in my sleep.
- No, Ben. No.

82
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,631
What did I say?

83
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,472
You was quoting the scripture, Ben.

84
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,393
You said
"And a little child shall lead them."

85
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,991
You killed two men, Ben Harper.

86
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,594
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank

87
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,800
cos I got tired of seeing children
roaming the woodlands without food.

88
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,229
Children roaming the highways
in this year of Depression.

89
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,750
Children sleeping in old abandoned
car bodies on junk heaps.

90
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,071
I promised myself I'd never see
the day when my young 'uns would want.

91
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,390
With that $10,000
I could build a tabernacle

92
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,711
and make that Wheeling Island tabernacle
look like a chicken house.

93
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,950
Would you have free candy for the kids?

94
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,032
Think of it, Ben.
With that cursed, bloody gold.

95
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,798
How come you got that stick-knife
hid up in your blankets, Preacher?

96
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,429
The Lord blinded mine enemies when
they brought me in this evil place.

97
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,796
I smuggled it in right under
the noses of them guards.

98
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,871
"I come not with peace,

99
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,550
- but with a sword."
- You, Preacher?

100
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,548
The sword has served me through
many an evil time, Ben Harper.

101
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,594
What religion do you profess, Preacher?

102
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,639
The religion the Almighty and me
worked out betwixt us.

103
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,111
I'll bet!

104
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,913
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.

105
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,276
Keep talking, Preacher.

106
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,316
If you let that money serve the Lord,

107
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,119
- he might feel kindly towards you.
- Keep talking.

108
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,318
Now, don't you think the Lord might
change his mind if you was to...

109
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,790
Lord, you sure knowed
what you was doing

110
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,357
when you put me
in this very cell at this very time.

111
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,751
A man with $10,000 hid somewhere -
and a widow in the making.

112
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,393
- Any trouble?
- No.

113
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,675
He was a cool one, that Harper.
Never broke.

114
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,751
Carried on some. Kicked.

115
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,077
- They say he left a wife and two kids.
- I never heard.

116
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,636
- He never told about the money?
- No.

117
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,790
What do you figure he done with it?

118
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,833
He took the secret with him
when I dropped him.

119
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,870
That you, Bart? Supper's waiting.

120
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,878
Mother, sometimes I think it might be
better if I was to quit my job as guard.

121
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,511
You're always this way when there's a
hanging. You never have to be there.

122
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,715
Sometimes I wish I was back in the mine.

123
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,031
And leave me a widow after
another blast like the one in '24?

124
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,111
Not on your life, old mister.

125
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,958
<i># Hing, hang, hung</i>

126
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,429
<i># See what the hangman done</i>

127
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,471
<i>#</i> See what the hangman done

128
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,471
<i>#</i> Hung, hang, hing

129
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,516
<i>#</i> See the robber swing

130
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,633
<i>#</i> Hing, hang, hung

131
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,711
<i>#</i> Now my song is done

132
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,350
Are you going to buy it, John?

133
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,629
So your mommy's
keeping you out of school.

134
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,031
How is your poor, poor mother?

135
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,436
She's at Spoon's ice-cream parlor.

136
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,958
Did they ever find out what your father
done with all that money he stole?

137
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,471
Pearl and me, we have to go.

138
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,716
- You'd better not sing that song.
- Why?

139
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,791
Cos you're too little.

140
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,878
Can we get some candy?

141
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,071
No.

142
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,879
Willa Harper, there are certain
plain facts of life that adds up

143
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,838
just like two plus two makes four,
and one of them is this.

144
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,673
No woman is able to raise
growing youngsters alone.

145
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,550
- The Lord meant that job for two.
- Icey, I just don't want a husband.

146
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,039
T' ain't a question of wanting
or not wanting.

147
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,553
You've got two little young 'uns.

148
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,393
It's a man you need in the house,
Willa Harper.

149
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,151
Tell me a story, John.

150
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,793
Well, once upon a time...

151
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,156
there was a rich king
who had himself a son and a daughter.

152
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,874
They all lived in a castle over in Africa.

153
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,032
Then one day this king
got taken away by some bad men.

154
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,629
Before he got took off he told his son to
kill anyone who tried to steal his gold.

155
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,033
And before long,
the bad men came back and...

156
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,271
Just a man.

157
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,115
Good night, Pearl.
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.

158
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,112
Night, Miss Jenny.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

159
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,230
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing
no more but she still blows as she passes.

160
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,390
Come on in and have a cup of coffee, boy.

161
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,711
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.

162
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,079
Ain't nobody going to neither,
as long as Uncle Birdie's round.

163
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,954
First day my joints is limber enough I'll
haul her out and give her a good caulking.

164
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,949
- Ain't seen you in a coon's age, boy.
- I've been minding Pearl.

165
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,875
Ain't it a caution what a woman'll load
onto a man's back when he ain't looking?

166
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,353
Excuse me, Cap, while I...
sweeten my coffee.

167
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,152
Dead and gone these twenty-five year
and never takes her eyes off me.

168
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,712
Man of my years needs a little snort
in the morning to heat the boilers.

169
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,998
Yeah.

170
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,710
I was talking to this stranger up at
the boarding house. He knowed your dad.

171
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,035
- Where'd he know Dad?
- I'll not hide it.

172
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,793
He knowed him
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

173
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,759
- I've got to go now, Uncle Birdie.
- Why, you just got here, boy.

174
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,594
I told Mom I'd be back
to Spoon's for Pearl.

175
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,036
God works in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform.

176
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,837
Yes, I was with Brother Harper
right up to the end.

177
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,470
Now that I'm no longer employed by
the penitentiary

178
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,154
it is my joy to bring this
small comfort to his loved ones.

179
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,674
It's a mighty good man
would go out of his way

180
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,433
to bring a word of cheer
to a grieving widow.

181
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,592
So you ain't with the state no more?

182
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,636
No, brother, I resigned only yesterday.

183
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,032
The heart-rending spectacle of them
poor men was just too much for me.

184
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,749
Ah, little lad,
you're staring at my fingers.

185
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,594
Would you like me to tell you the little
story of Right-hand, Left-hand?

186
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,671
The story of good and evil.

187
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,431
H-A-T-E.

188
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,839
It was with this left hand

189
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,196
that old Brother Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

190
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,271
L-O-V-E.

191
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,991
See these fingers, dear hearts? They has
veins that run straight to the soul of man.

192
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,674
The right hand, friends.
The hand of love.

193
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,554
Now watch and
I'll show you the story of life.

194
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,394
These fingers is always a-warring and
a-tugging, one agin t'other.

195
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,671
Now watch 'em.

196
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,591
Old Brother Left-hand.

197
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,511
Left-hand hates a-fighting.

198
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,591
And it looks like Love's a goner.

199
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,951
But wait a minute!

200
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,236
Hot dog! Love's a-winning.

201
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,835
Yes, sirree. It's Love that won.

202
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,113
And old Left-hand Hate
is down for the count.

203
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,271
I never heard it better told.

204
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,915
I wish every soul in this community
could get the benefit.

205
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,879
You've just got to stay
for our picnic Sunday.

206
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,077
No, I must wend my way downriver
on the Lord's business.

207
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,674
You ain't leaving in no hurry
if we can help it.

208
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,557
John, mind your manners!

209
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,029
Take that look off your face. Act nice.

210
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,834
He don't mean no impudence,
do you, boy?

211
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,471
Do you, boy?

212
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,797
Many's the time poor Brother Ben
told me about these young 'uns.

213
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,233
What did he tell you?

214
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,790
He told me what fine little lambs
you and your sister both was.

215
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,472
Is that all?

216
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,472
Why, no, boy.
He told me lots and lots of things.

217
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,351
- Nice things, boy.
- Thank you.

218
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,554
My, that fudge smells yummy.

219
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,517
It's for the picnic.

220
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,276
And you don't get a smidgen of my fudge
unless you <i>stay</i> for the picnic.

221
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,634
Don't he have the grandest singing voice?

222
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,234
John! Pearl!
Run along and play, you two.

223
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,114
- Where?
- Down by the river. My goodness!

224
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,231
That fella's aching to settle down with
some nice woman and make a home.

225
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,108
Icey, it's awful soon after Ben's passing.

226
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,270
If ever I saw a sign from heaven...

227
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,232
- John don't like him much.
- Pearl dotes on him.

228
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,511
The boy worries me.

229
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,309
I know it's silly, but it's like there's
something still between him and his dad.

230
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,391
What he needs is a dose of salts.

231
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,229
- Oh, there's something else.
- What?

232
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,750
The money.

233
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,958
I declare, Willa Harper, you'll let
that money haunt you to your grave.

234
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,712
Icey, I would love to be satisfied

235
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,553
that Harry Powell don't think
I got that money hid somewhere.

236
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,154
You come right out
and ask that man of God.

237
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,633
Mr. Powell! Clear that evil mud
out of your soul.

238
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,509
John! Pearl!
Come along here and get some fudge.

239
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,114
- I don't want no fudge.
- You do what you're told!

240
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,952
You go set down by the river.

241
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,713
- Oh, Icey, I'm a sight.
- Get along with you!

242
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,071
You!

243
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,634
That young lady better look sharp or
some smart sister is gonna snap him up.

244
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,711
She's not the only fish in the river!

245
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,792
Now you two stay put.
Shilly-shallying around.

246
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,991
A husband's one piece of store goods
you never know

247
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,435
till you get it home and take the paper off.

248
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,355
Did Ben Harper ever tell you what
he done with the money he stole?

249
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,431
My dear child, don't you know?

250
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,311
She's mooning about Ben Harper.

251
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,912
That wasn't love. That was just
flapdoodle. Have some fudge, lambs.

252
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,718
When you've been married
to a man 40 years,

253
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,553
you know all that
don't amount to a hill of beans.

254
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,349
I've been married to my Walt that long
and I swear, in all that time,

255
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,113
I just lie there thinking about my canning.

256
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,351
John!

257
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,636
A woman's a fool to marry for that.
That's something for a man.

258
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,430
The good Lord never meant for a decent
woman to want that. Not really want it.

259
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,910
It's all just a fake and a pipe dream.

260
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,078
John, Mr. Powell has something to tell you.

261
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,636
Well, John.

262
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,111
The night before your father died he
told me what he did with that money.

263
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,714
That money's at the bottom of the river,
wrapped around a 12-pound cobblestone.

264
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,431
Thank you, Harry.

265
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,678
I feel clean now.

266
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,877
My whole body's just a-quivering
with cleanness.

267
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,669
John, come here. Your tie is crooked.

268
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,116
- When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
- Can't hear you, boy.

269
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,757
When'll the skiff be ready?

270
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,675
Have her ready inside a week
and then we'll go fishing.

271
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,150
- How's your ma?
- Oh, she's all right.

272
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,196
- How's sister Pearl?
- Just fine.

273
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,192
- You leaving, boy?
- Got to watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

274
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,953
Well, good night, boy.
Come again any time.

275
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,079
And mind, boy, I'll have your
pa's skiff shipshape inside a week.

276
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,271
Somebody there?

277
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,871
Anybody there?

278
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,831
Anybody here?

279
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,911
Good evening, John.

280
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,713
I had a little talk with
your mother tonight, John.

281
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,112
And your mother decided it might be best
for <i>me</i> to let you know the news.

282
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,432
Your mother told me she wanted me to
be a daddy to you and your sister.

283
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,511
We're going to get married, boy.

284
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,271
Did you hear what I said, boy?

285
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,352
Married. We're going to
Sisterville tomorrow.

286
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,954
- And when we get back...
- You ain't my dad.

287
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,878
You'll never be my dad.

288
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,997
When we get back
we're all going to be friends

289
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,110
and share our fortunes together, John.

290
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,317
You think you can make me tell,
but I won't. I won't!

291
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,432
- Tell me what, boy?
- Nothing.

292
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,988
We're not keeping secrets
from each other, are we?

293
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,471
No.

294
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,951
Well, no matter.

295
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,550
We've got a long time together, boy.

296
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,749
Wave your hands! Great sakes!

297
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,432
Now you wait here
while I get your night things.

298
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,231
Now can I tell?

299
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,912
When Mr. Powell's our daddy
then can I tell him about it?

300
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,797
- You swore, Pearl.
- John, don't.

301
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,189
You promised Dad you wouldn't tell.

302
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,510
I love Mr. Powell lots and lots, John.

303
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,031
Men!

304
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,951
Harry?

305
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,871
Fix that window shade.

306
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,511
I was praying.

307
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,598
I'm sorry. I didn't know. I thought...

308
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,274
You thought, Willa,
that the moment you walked in that door

309
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,397
I'd start to pawing you
in that abominable way

310
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,597
that men are supposed to do
on their wedding night.

311
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,751
- Ain't that right, now?
- No.

312
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,078
I think it's time we made one thing
perfectly clear, Willa.

313
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,790
Marriage to me represents a blending of
two spirits in the sight of heaven.

314
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,031
Get up, Willa.

315
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,911
- Harry, what...
- Get up.

316
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,152
Now, go look at yourself yonder
in that mirror.

317
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,911
Do as I say.

318
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,111
Look at yourself.

319
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,191
What do you see, girl?

320
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,831
You see the body of a woman.

321
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,474
The temple of creation and motherhood.

322
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,395
You see the flesh of Eve
that man since Adam has profaned.

323
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,950
That body was meant
for begetting children.

324
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,190
It was not meant for the lust of men.

325
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,756
Do you want more children, Willa?

326
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,478
I...

327
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,959
No.

328
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,191
It's the business of this marriage
to mind those two you have now,

329
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,236
not to beget more.

330
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,311
Yes.

331
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,157
All right. You can get in bed now
and stop shivering.

332
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,316
Help me to get clean, so I can be
what Harry wants me to be.

333
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,351
Meanest, orneriest, sneakiest critter
in the whole river, boy. A gar.

334
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,552
- Here are your hooks, Uncle Birdie.
- Pshaw, boy!

335
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,393
Ain't a hook in the land
strong enough to land Mr. Gar.

336
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,516
What a fella needs is mother wit -
and a horse hair.

337
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,510
Golly! Won't it bust it, Uncle Birdie?

338
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,034
No, horse hair'll hold a lumpin' whale!

339
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,871
- You mind my cussin', boy?
- No.

340
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,757
Well, the reason I ask,
your step-pa bein' a preacher an' all...

341
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,272
Never was much of a one
for preachers my own self.

342
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,156
I don't know what's wrong
up at your house,

343
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,516
but always remember, Cap,
if you're ever in trouble,

344
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,435
holler and come a-runnin'.
Uncle Birdie's your friend.

345
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,590
There! You slimy, snag-toothed,
bait-stealin' so-and-so!

346
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,351
Amen.

347
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,431
- You have all sinned.
- Yes!

348
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,231
But which one of you can say,
as I can say,

349
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,310
that you drove a good man to murder?

350
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,198
Because I kept a-houndin' him for
perfume and clothes and face paint!

351
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,396
And... he slew two human beings!

352
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,508
And he come to me and he said

353
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,116
"Take this money and buy yourself
the clothes and the paint."

354
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,471
But brethren...

355
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,749
Oh, that's where the Lord stepped in!

356
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,469
Yes!

357
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,357
Alleluia!

358
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,955
He said, the Lord, to that man

359
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:48,236
"You take that money
and you throw it in the river!"

360
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,671
- In the river!
- In the river!

361
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,354
Now, you're John and you're Pearl.

362
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,036
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a sin.

363
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,711
I didn't tell no one.

364
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,909
It's all here.

365
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,918
John?

366
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,830
Yes?

367
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,753
- What are you doin', boy?
- Gettin' Pearl to bed.

368
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,752
- What's takin' you so long about it?
- Nothing.

369
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,516
What's that you're playin' with?

370
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,919
Pearl's junk.

371
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,072
Mom gets mad when she plays out here
and don't put it away.

372
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,151
Come on, children.

373
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,391
Off to bed with the both of you.

374
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,751
Come here, John.

375
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,989
Your mother tells me you tattled on me.

376
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,476
She said you told her
I asked where that money was hid.

377
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,958
That wasn't very nice, boy. Have a heart.

378
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,831
Yeah!

379
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,516
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's your word against mine.

380
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,757
It's me your mother believes.

381
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,753
Were you impudent again
to Mr. Powell, John?

382
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,871
Mom, I didn't mean it.

383
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,151
What were you impudent about?

384
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,109
He asked me about
the money again, Mom.

385
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,910
John, you always make up that lie.

386
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,989
There is no money. Why can't you
get that through your head?

387
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,674
The boy's as stubborn
and as mulish as a sheep.

388
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,113
It's a shame.

389
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,918
- Good night, Icey.
- Good night, honey.

390
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,230
Good night, Walt.

391
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,311
Plan on a longer visit next time.

392
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,274
You hardly settle before
you're frettin' to get home.

393
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm needed to keep peace
and harmony betwixt them.

394
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,434
It's my burden and I'm proud of it, Icey.

395
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,670
- Where's the money hid?
- I don't know.

396
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,672
She thinks that money's
at the bottom of the river.

397
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,955
But you and me,
we know better, don't we?

398
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,031
I don't know nothin'.

399
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,472
Well, never mind, boy.
The summer's young yet.

400
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,952
Pearl. Come here.

401
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,278
John's a fella likes to keep secrets.
I'll tell <i>you</i> a secret.

402
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,352
- Yes?
- I knowed your daddy.

403
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,990
And you know what your daddy told me?

404
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,911
He said "You tell my little girl Pearl there's
to be no secrets between her and you."

405
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,718
Yes?

406
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,791
All right. Now it's your turn.

407
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,191
What secret shall I tell?

408
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,431
What's your name?

409
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,909
You're just fooling. My name's Pearl!

410
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,549
Well, I reckon I'll have to try again.

411
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,231
Where's the money hid?

412
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,992
Pearl! You swore you wouldn't tell!
You swore!

413
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,590
You hit Daddy with the hairbrush.

414
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,437
Now, you see?
We can't have anything to do with John.

415
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,473
You and me'll go on down
to the parlor, Pearl.

416
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,998
John's just plumb bad
through and through.

417
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,072
- John's bad.
- Yes, John's bad.

418
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,272
- Tell me another secret about my dad.
- Oh, no! Your turn.

419
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,590
All right. What secret shall I tell?

420
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,829
- Where's the money hid?
- John's bad.

421
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,351
Where's the money hid?

422
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,632
Tell me, you little wretch,
or I'll tear your arm off!

423
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,717
- Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
- How do you mean?

424
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,594
I'm figurin' how to say it
so as you won't get mad.

425
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,636
Say what, Walt Spoon?

426
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,915
- Somethin's wrong about it.
- About what?

427
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,389
- About Mr. Powell. All of it.
- Walt!

428
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,870
- A body's got a right to their feelings.
- May the Lord have mercy on you.

429
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,315
I was just...

430
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,271
Amen.

431
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,431
Are you through praying?

432
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,791
I'm through, Harry.

433
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,354
You were listening
outside the parlor window.

434
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,432
- It ain't in the river, is it, Harry?
- Answer me.

435
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,157
Ben never told you he throwed it
in the river, did he?

436
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,557
The children know where it's hid.
John knows. Is that it, Harry?

437
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,316
Then it's still here amongst us.
Tainting us.

438
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,553
You must have known about it
all along, Harry.

439
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,833
But that ain't the reason
why you married me.

440
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,551
I know that much.

441
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,474
Because the Lord just wouldn't let it be.

442
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,352
He made you marry me so you could
show me the Way and the Life.

443
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,951
And the salvation of my soul.

444
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,111
Ain't that so, Harry?

445
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,757
So you might say that it was the money
that brung us together.

446
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,911
The rest of it don't matter.

447
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,151
Walt. Come quick.

448
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,356
- What's wrong, Mother?
- Shhh! He's in there.

449
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,274
- Who?
- Mr. Powell. Willa has run away.

450
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,559
- I'll be switched! Just went?
- She took out in that old Model T.

451
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,230
- Is he hit pretty bad?
- All to pieces.

452
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,390
Well, there's a little
peach brandy in here...

453
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,392
- A man of the cloth?
- Well, just a sip.

454
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,113
Walt Spoon, that's for sickness
in the house!

455
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,351
- Well, what can we do?
- If you talked to him, another man...

456
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,238
Now, Mother, please. I'm no good at...

457
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,229
Mr. Powell?

458
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,880
- A strange woman is a narrow pit.
- Amen.

459
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,511
She lieth in wait as for prey and
increaseth the transgressors among men.

460
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,919
Oh, my dear friends.
Whatever would I do without you?

461
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,231
- Mr. Powell!
- Well, if there's anythin' we can...

462
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,676
No, it's my shame. It's my crown
of thorns. I must wear it bravely.

463
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,672
- What could have possessed that girl?
- Satan.

464
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,357
Didn't you have no inklin'?

465
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,749
Yes, I did. From the very first night.

466
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,191
- First night?
- Our honeymoon.

467
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,951
How's that?

468
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,192
- She turned me out of the bed.
- No!

469
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,672
Well, what do you figure to do?

470
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,196
Do? Why, just stay right here
and take care of them kids.

471
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,391
Maybe it was never meant for a woman
like Willa to taint their young lives.

472
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,278
It's mighty brave of you.

473
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,716
I reckon it was just ordained that way,
Brother Spoon.

474
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,470
Didn't she leave no word?

475
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,512
A scrawl. On a notepaper on the bureau.

476
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,271
I burned it.

477
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,637
Tore it up and burned it,
it stank so strong of hellfire.

478
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,517
Amen!

479
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,558
The pitcher has went to the well
once too often, friends.

480
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,234
Oh, she'll come
draggin' her tail back home.

481
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,949
She'll not be back.
I reckon I'm safe in promisin' you that.

482
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,196
- Maybe she's just on a spree.
- Oh, no.

483
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,519
- Well, there's no harm in hopin'.
- Ain't no sense in it neither.

484
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,798
I figured somethin' was brewin'
when she went to bed last night.

485
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,871
How?

486
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,233
Well, she tarried around
in the kitchen after I'd gone up.

487
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,437
And when I went downstairs
to see what was wrong...

488
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,108
Well, she'd found
this jar of dandelion wine

489
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,479
that the husband, this Harper,
had hid somewheres in the cellar.

490
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,031
She was drinkin'.

491
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,679
I tried to save her.

492
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,355
I know you did, Mr. Powell.
Oh, I know how hard you tried.

493
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,431
But the devil wins sometimes.

494
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,112
Can't nobody say
I didn't do <i>my</i> best to save her.

495
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,078
Children!

496
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,151
Pearl?

497
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,511
Careful.

498
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,391
Why do we have to hide, John?

499
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,754
Where's Mom?

500
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,195
- She's gone to Moundsville.
- To see Dad?

501
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,271
Yes, I reckon that's it.

502
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,552
Now, listen to me, Pearl.
You and me is runnin' off tonight.

503
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,358
Why?

504
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,079
If we stay here
somethin' awful'll happen to us.

505
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,310
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?

506
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,477
No. That's just it. No.

507
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,636
- Where we going, John?
- Somewheres. I don't know yet.

508
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,873
I'm hungry, John.

509
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,952
- We'll steal somethin' to eat.
- It'll spoil our suppers.

510
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,031
Pearl?

511
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,118
I can hear you whisperin', children,
so I know you're down there.

512
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,430
I can feel myself gettin' awful mad.

513
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,835
I'm out of patience, children.
I'm coming to find you now.

514
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,791
Mr. Powell!

515
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,831
Well, well, Mrs. Spoon.

516
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,508
- Where are the children?
- Down there in that cellar playin' games.

517
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,591
And they won't mind me when I call them.

518
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,671
I'm at my wit's end, Mrs. Spoon.

519
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,911
John? Pearl?

520
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,431
Shake a leg!

521
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,673
Well, well, well! What's that?

522
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,957
Just a little hot supper
I fixed for you and the children.

523
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,429
It seemed the least we could do.

524
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,509
I won't have you worryin'
poor Mr. Powell another minute.

525
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,512
Just look at you!
Dust and filth from top to toe.

526
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,109
Want me to take 'em up
and wash 'em good?

527
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,597
No. No, thank you, dear Icey.
I'll tend to them. Thank you.

528
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,759
Don't be too hard on them, Preacher.
Poor, motherless children.

529
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,356
Remember, now, Mr. Powell.
Don't be afraid to call on us.

530
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,078
Goodbye.

531
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,549
Goodbye, Mrs. Spoon. And thanks again.

532
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,838
Now, weren't you afraid, little lambs?
Down there in all that dark?

533
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,391
They'll think it was me.

534
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,553
They'll think it was poor old Uncle Birdie.

535
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,710
Oh, if you could have seen it, Bess.

536
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,431
Down there in the deep place.

537
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:49,117
With her hair wavin' soft and lazy
like meadow grass under flood water.

538
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,037
And that slit in her throat
like she had an extra mouth.

539
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,716
You're the only human mortal
I can go to, Bess.

540
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,118
If I go to the law, they'll hang it on me.

541
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,477
Sweet heaven, save poor old Uncle Birdie!

542
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,515
- I'm hungry.
- Sure.

543
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,711
And there's fried chicken, sweet
potatoes, corn bread and apple cobbler.

544
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,513
- Can I have my supper, please?
- Naturally.

545
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,679
- Can I have milk too?
- Mm-hm. But first we'll have a little talk.

546
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,271
- About our secrets.
- No.

547
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,120
- And why not, pray tell?
- Cos John said I mustn't.

548
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,191
Never mind what John said!

549
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,071
John's a meddler.

550
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,151
Now stop that snivellin'.

551
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,430
Looky here. You know what that is?

552
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,709
Want to see somethin' cute? Now looky.

553
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,871
How about that!

554
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,471
This is what I use on meddlers.

555
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,231
John might be a meddler.

556
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,955
No, little lamb. Don't touch it.

557
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,996
Don't touch my knife.
That makes me mad. Very, very mad.

558
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,194
Now, just tell me. Where's the money hid?

559
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,789
But I swore.
I promised John I wouldn't tell.

560
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,871
John doesn't matter!

561
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,915
Can't I get that through your head,
you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch?

562
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,109
There now. You made me lose my temper.

563
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,878
I'm sorry. I'm real sorry.

564
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,274
Now, just tell me. Where's it hid, honey?

565
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,188
- I'll tell.
- I told <i>you</i> to keep your mouth shut.

566
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,478
It ain't fair to make Pearl tell
when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.

567
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,039
Well, I declare!

568
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,749
Sometimes I think poor ol' John
might make it to heaven yet.

569
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,995
- All right, boy. Where's the money?
- In the cellar. Under a stone in the floor.

570
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,752
- It'll go hard if I find you're lyin', boy.
- I'm not lyin'. Go look for yourself.

571
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,031
All right.

572
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,551
- Come along.
- What?

573
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,751
Go ahead of me. The both of you.

574
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,031
Down those stairs.

575
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,150
You don't reckon I'd leave you,
do you, boy?

576
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,028
- Well, don't you believe me?
- Why, sure, boy. Sure.

577
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,790
And where now? Mind, no tricks, now.

578
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,031
I can't abide a liar.

579
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,231
Yonder.

580
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,271
Oh, no, you don't.

581
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,076
- Now where, boy, where?
- Under the stone in the floor.

582
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,351
This is concrete.

583
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,398
John made a sin. John told a lie.

584
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,071
The Lord's a-talking to me now.

585
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,748
He's a-saying "A liar
is an abomination before mine eyes."

586
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,351
Speak, boy, where's it hid?

587
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,791
Speak.

588
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,317
Speak, or I'll cut your throat and leave you
to drip like a hog in butchering time.

589
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,278
Pearl, shut up. Pearl, you swore!

590
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,398
You could save him, little bird.

591
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,791
It's in my doll!

592
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,231
The doll!

593
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,991
Why, sure!

594
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,954
The last place anybody'd think to look.

595
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,189
Uncle Birdie Steptoe.

596
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,439
Open that door, you spawn
of the devil's own strumpet!

597
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,991
Uncle Birdie!

598
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,352
- Uncle Birdie.
- John.

599
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,996
Hide us, Uncle Birdie.
He's a-coming with his knife.

600
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,432
It's me. John Harper and Pearl.
You told me to come.

601
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,636
- Johnny?
- Uncle Birdie, oh, please.

602
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,517
Please! Wake up!

603
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,637
I swear on the Book, I never done it.

604
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,831
There's still the river.

605
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,591
The skiff is under the willow.

606
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,751
Children!

607
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,872
"Dear Walt and Icey,

608
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,997
I bet you've been worried
and gave us up for lost."

609
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,832
"Took the kids down here with me
for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm."

610
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,792
"Thought a little change of scenery
would do us all a world of good

611
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,269
after so much trouble and heartache."

612
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,629
"At least the kids will get
a-plenty of good home cooking."

613
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,552
"Your devoted Harry Powell."

614
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,631
Now, ain't you relieved, Walt?

615
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,868
Sure. But you was worried too, Mother.
Taking off with never a word of goodbye!

616
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,157
I figured them gypsies busted in
and done off with all three of them.

617
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,674
You and your gypsies.
They been gone a week.

618
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,673
Sure. But not before one of 'em
knifed a farmer and stole his horse.

619
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,069
Never caught the gypsy. Nor the horse.

620
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,031
Such times,
when young 'uns run the roads.

621
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,111
Go away, children.

622
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,158
Hungry, I suppose?

623
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,437
Well, I can't spare you more
than one potato apiece.

624
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,514
- Where are <i>your</i> folks?
- Ain't got none.

625
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,631
Oh, go away, go away.

626
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,911
An ungrateful child is an
abomination before the eyes of God.

627
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,835
The world is going to damnation because
of young 'uns flying in the face of age.

628
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,118
They make soup out of them,

629
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,397
but I wouldn't know
how to go about getting him open.

630
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,309
We're going to spend the night on land.

631
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,789
Are we going home now, John?

632
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,949
Don't he never sleep?

633
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,711
Pearl, wake up. Come on!

634
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,717
You two youngsters
get up here to me this instant.

635
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,392
Get on up to my house.
Mind me, now. I'll get me a switch.

636
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,230
- Don't you hurt her.
- Hurt her? Wash her's more like it!

637
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,954
- Ruby! Clary! Mary!
- Yes, Miss Cooper.

638
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,111
Bring your baskets.

639
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,798
Nicely picked, Clary.

640
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,231
Mary, put the big ones on top.

641
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,755
Ruby, most of them
ain't fit to go to market.

642
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,273
Put them down.

643
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,069
Ruby, run to the house and fetch
the tub and put it by the pump.

644
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,357
Clary... Mary,
run up and fetch a bar of laundry soap.

645
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,759
Yes, Miss Cooper.

646
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,037
And a scrub brush!
Come on up to the house, children.

647
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,834
Gracious, if you ain't a sight to beat all!

648
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,191
Where you from?

649
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,997
Where are your folks?

650
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,071
Come on, speak up, now.

651
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,833
Gracious,
so I've got two more mouths to feed.

652
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,190
Howdy, Miss Cooper.
What happened to my milk?

653
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,759
Price of milk what it is, not on your life.

654
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,469
Do better making butter
with the cream. Sell it retail.

655
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,075
Make smearcase for the children,
feed what's left to my hogs.

656
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,276
- She talks to herself.
- All the time.

657
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,955
- Your ma's funny.
- She ain't our ma. We just live with her.

658
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,470
- Where are your folks?
- Someplace.

659
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,357
My daddy's in Detroit.

660
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,911
Mary!

661
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,111
Honey. Good morning, Miss Cooper.

662
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,350
I'm saving up to buy you a bracelet.

663
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,474
Never mind that, don't forget your visit
this Sunday - and come to church with us.

664
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,511
See you Sunday, love.

665
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,271
Take your baskets in, children.

666
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,637
Women is fools.

667
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,711
All of 'em.

668
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,911
Looky there.

669
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,434
She'll be losing her mind
to a tricky mouth and a full moon,

670
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,354
and like as not, I'll be saddled
with the consequences.

671
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,071
Here's what you owe me.

672
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,271
One, two, three, four, five...

673
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,516
Where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?

674
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,999
She went.

675
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,071
John, you go find Ruby.

676
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,750
Big Ruby's my bothersome girl.
She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em.

677
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,072
But she's got mother hands with the
young 'uns, so what are you to say?

678
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,591
How about tonight, Ruby?

679
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,989
- What gives?
- The old lady's around.

680
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,151
How about Thursday?

681
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,790
The old gal thinks she comes in
for sewing lessons on Thursday.

682
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,871
Miss Cooper wants you.

683
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,793
And will you show me your dolly,
little lady?

684
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,911
I see you got two more peeps
to your brood.

685
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,390
- Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
- How's your own boy, Miss Cooper?

686
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,110
Haven't heard from Ralph since last
Christmas. Still, I've got a new crop.

687
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,032
I'm a strong tree
with branches for many birds.

688
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,955
I'm good for something in this old world,
and I know it too.

689
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:40,799
Now, old Pharaoh,
he was king of Egypt land,

690
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,158
and he had a daughter.

691
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,711
And once upon a time,

692
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,232
she was walking along by the river bank

693
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,835
and she seen something bumping
and scraping along on a sand bar

694
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,549
down under the willows.
And you know what it was, children?

695
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:57,796
No.

696
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,519
Now, it was a skiff, washed up on the bar.

697
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,552
And who do you reckon was in it?

698
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,631
Pearl and John.

699
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:10,830
Not this time. There was only
one young 'un, a little boy babe.

700
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,073
- And you know who he was, children?
- No.

701
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,832
It was Moses. A king of men.

702
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,431
Moses, children.

703
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,911
Now, off to bed with you.

704
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,874
John, get me an apple.

705
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,511
And get one for yourself too.

706
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,231
John, where are your folks?

707
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,591
Dead.

708
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,311
Where are you from?

709
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,551
Upriver.

710
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,991
I didn't figure you'd rowed that skiff
all the way up from Parkersburg.

711
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,071
Tell me that story again.

712
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,511
Story? What story, honey?

713
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,153
About them kings.

714
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,949
And the queen found down on
the sand bar that time in the skiff.

715
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,112
Kings?
Why, there was only one king, honey.

716
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,351
I mind you said there was two.

717
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,120
Well, shoot now. Maybe there was.

718
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,909
Yes, come to think of it, there was two.

719
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,590
Must be Thursday. Here comes Ruby.

720
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,951
Here I go.

721
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,155
Why, you're Ruby, ain't you, my child?

722
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,434
Can I have this?

723
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,954
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.

724
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,792
- Will you buy me an ice cream?
- Of course.

725
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,155
- Watch out, Preacher.
- Why, Preacher!

726
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,231
Shut your dirty mouths.

727
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,433
Ain't I pretty?

728
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,399
Why, you're the prettiest thing
I ever seen in all my wandering.

729
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,914
Ain't nobody never told you that, Ruby?

730
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,595
No, no one never did.

731
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,319
There's two new ones out your place,
ain't there?

732
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,391
Uh-huh.

733
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,069
- What's their names?
- Pearl and John.

734
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,316
- Is there a doll?
- Only they don't never let me play with it.

735
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,111
Did you ever see such pretty eyes
in all your born days?

736
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,918
Don't let him get away, sugar.

737
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,551
He ain't like you all. Next time, I won't
even ask him to buy me an ice cream.

738
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,551
I's bitten bad.

739
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,277
- Ruby, you didn't have money to buy this.
- You'll whip me.

740
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,918
When did I ever?

741
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,436
- This man at the drugstore, he gave...
- The drugstore?

742
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,835
Miss Cooper, I never been
to sewing lessons all them times.

743
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,911
What you been up to, Ruby?

744
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,391
I been out with men.

745
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,911
Child.

746
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,112
You were looking for love, Ruby,
in the only foolish way you knew how.

747
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,031
We all need love, Ruby.

748
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,631
I lost the love of my son.

749
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,031
I found it with you all.

750
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,877
You're going to grow up to be a strong,
fine woman.

751
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:39,874
- I'm going to see to it that you do.
- This gentleman weren't like them.

752
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,633
He just give me a book
and buy me an ice cream.

753
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,797
- Now, who was this?
- He didn't ask me for nothing.

754
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,634
- What did you talk about?
- Pearl and John.

755
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,353
John and Pearl? Is he their pap?

756
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,631
I don't know.

757
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,476
Wonder why he hasn't been to the house.

758
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,391
Miss Cooper!

759
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,200
- What?
- The man!

760
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,198
Good morning, ladies.

761
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,511
- How do?
- Why, you're Miss Cooper, I take it?

762
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,270
It's about that John and that Pearl?

763
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,351
Oh, them poor little lambs.

764
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,875
To think I never hoped
to see them again in this world.

765
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,192
Oh, dear madam, if you was to know
what a crown of thorns I've borne

766
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,430
in my search for them stray chicks.

767
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,391
Ruby, go fetch them kids.

768
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,073
Oh, madam,
I see you're looking at my hands.

769
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,679
Shall I tell you the story of Left-hand,
Right-hand, the tale of good and evil?

770
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,594
It was with this left hand that Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

771
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,434
- Them kids is yours?
- My own flesh and blood.

772
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,679
- Where's your missus?
- She run off with a drummer.

773
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,794
- During prayer meeting.
- Where's she at?

774
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,348
Down the river somewheres.
Parkersburg, Cincinnati.

775
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,910
- One of them Sodoms of the Ohio river.
- She took them kids with her?

776
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,912
Oh, heaven only knows
what unholy sights and sounds

777
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,357
them innocent babes has heard in the
dens of perdition where she dragged 'em.

778
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,070
Right funny, ain't it, how they rode
all the way upriver in a ten-foot john boat.

779
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,115
- Are they well, Miss Cooper?
- A sight better than they was.

780
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,996
Gracious, gracious,
you are a good woman, Miss Cooper.

781
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,748
How you figuring to raise them two
without a woman?

782
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,116
The Lord will provide.
The Lord is merciful.

783
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,995
Oh, what a day this is.

784
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,071
And there's little John.

785
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,669
- What's wrong, John?
- Come to me, boy.

786
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,633
- What's wrong, John?
- Didn't you hear me, boy?

787
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,995
When your dad says "come"
you should mind him.

788
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,877
He ain't my dad.

789
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,509
No, and he ain't no preacher neither.

790
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,557
Just march yourself yonder
to your horse, mister.

791
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,591
March, mister. I'm not foolin'!

792
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,428
All right. But you haven't
heard the last of Harry Powell yet!

793
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,756
The Lord God Jehovah
will guide my hand in vengeance.

794
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,311
You devils!

795
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,438
You whores of Babylon!

796
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,231
I'll be back! When it's dark!

797
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:23,471
Shame on you, Ruby, mooning around
the house after that mad dog of a man.

798
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,952
Merciful heavens!

799
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,629
Ruby, go get the children out of bed
and bring them down here.

800
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,551
Women are such darn fools.

801
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,310
It's a hard world for little things.

802
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,914
Now, there was this sneaking,
no-account, ornery King Herod,

803
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,116
and when he heard of
little Jesus growin' up,

804
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,875
he figured "Well, shoot, there
won't be room for the both of us."

805
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,559
"I'll nip this in the bud."

806
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,155
But he wasn't sure which of all them
babies in the land was King Jesus.

807
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,549
So that cruel old King Herod figured,

808
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,235
if he was to kill all the babies in the land
he'd be sure and get little Jesus.

809
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,189
When little King Jesus'
ma and pa heard about this,

810
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,759
what do you reckon they done?

811
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,354
- They hid in a closet.
- They hid under the porch.

812
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,431
No. They went a-running.

813
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:51,589
Well, now, John, you're right.
That's just what they done.

814
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,109
Little King Jesus' ma and pa
saddled a mule

815
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,555
and they rode all the way down
into Egypt land.

816
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,871
Yeah, and that's where the queen
found them in the bulrushes.

817
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,918
Oh, no, that wasn't the same story.
That was little King Moses.

818
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,709
But just the same, it did seem like
it was a plague time for little ones.

819
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,234
Them olden days. Them hard, hard times.

820
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,192
Figured I was gone, huh?

821
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,874
Run. Hide on the staircase. Run quick!

822
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,231
Ruby, get!

823
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,870
- What do you want?
- I want them kids.

824
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,192
What do you want them for?

825
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:31,113
- None of your business, madam.
- I'm giving you to the count of three to go.

826
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,192
Then I'm coming across
to the kitchen to shoot you!

827
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,871
Miss Booth? Rachel Cooper.

828
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,031
Get your state troopers out to my place.

829
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,270
I got something trapped in my barn.

830
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,194
- I'll go see to Pearl.
- I'll make coffee.

831
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,031
She's all right.

832
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,076
John, you know when you're little
you have more endurance

833
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,310
than God is ever to grant you again?

834
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,792
Children are man at his strongest.
They abide.

835
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:46,514
- Why didn't you call us before now?
- Didn't want your dirty shoes on my floor.

836
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,715
Is that him?

837
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,633
Yes. Mind where you shoot, boys.
There are children here.

838
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:54,838
Harry Powell, you're under arrest
for the murder of Willa Harper.

839
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,271
Drop that knife, Powell.

840
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,755
Don't.

841
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,159
Here!

842
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,310
Take it back, Dad. Take it back!

843
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,472
I don't want it, Dad! It's too much! Here!

844
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,431
Lynch him!

845
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,832
Bluebeard!

846
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,798
- 25 wives!
- And he killed every last one of 'em.

847
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,997
- If the people of Marshall County...
- Bluebeard!

848
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,111
Will you identify the prisoner?

849
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,159
Please, little lad,

850
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:50,234
won't you look yonder and tell the court
if that is the man that killed your mother?

851
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,590
It's all right, Mrs. Cooper,
you can take the little fellow away.

852
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,950
Merry Christmas to you and yours,
Mrs. Cooper.

853
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,272
And what's Santa Claus going to
bring you for Christmas, little man?

854
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,351
- That's Pearl!
- Get your coats.

855
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,116
Them's her orphans.

856
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,872
- Where's Ruby?
- She went.

857
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,679
Them poor little lambs.

858
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,548
Them is the ones he sinned against,
my friends.

859
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,991
Go out the back door.

860
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,710
Ain't we going to the bus depot?

861
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:43,670
Dragging the name of the Lord
through the evil mud of his soul!

862
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,311
- String that Bluebeard up to a post!
- He's Satan hiding behind the cross!

863
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,270
I love him. You think he's like them others.

864
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,031
You were so mad, you shot him.

865
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,839
- Hey, Bart.
- Yeah?

866
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:04,708
- We're saving this bird up for you.
- This time it'll be a privilege.

867
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,114
I'm glad they sent me nothing.
It's never nothing I want.

868
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:36,830
Just something to show me how fancy
and smart they've come up in the world.

869
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,151
Can we give you your presents now?

870
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:48,791
Shoot, you don't mean to say
you got me a present? Shoot, now.

871
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,428
Ruby.

872
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,111
A pot-holder!

873
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,794
And it's much neater than last year, Ruby.

874
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,119
Clary.

875
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:10,429
Another pot-holder! Ain't that thoughtful.
I'm always burning my hands.

876
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,713
This doesn't look basted.
This looks made!

877
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,029
And you finished the edge
with a chain-stitch.

878
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,111
Oh, that's just dandy, Clary.

879
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,951
Another pot-holder?

880
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,560
Oh, now, did you two make this together?

881
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,631
He helped us some.

882
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,834
That's the richest gift a body could have.

883
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,988
And your presents are in the
cupboard under the china closet.

884
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,919
Ruby.

885
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,591
This is yours.

886
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:17,759
Lord save little children.
You'd think the world'd be ashamed

887
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:22,470
to name such a day as Christmas for one
of them, then go on in the same old way.

888
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:27,997
My soul is humble when I see the way
little ones accept their lot.

889
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,390
Lord save little children.

890
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,789
The wind blows and the rains are cold...

891
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,751
yet they abide.

892
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,109
That watch sure is a fine loud ticker.

893
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:12,430
Be nice to have someone round the house
who can give me the right time of day.

894
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,034
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.

895
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,838
Well, a fella just can't go around
with run-down, busted watches.

896
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,951
They abide and they endure.

897
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,630
