1
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,353
Now, you remember, children,
how l told you

2
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,791
about the good Lord going up into the
mountain and talking to the people?

3
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,078
And how he said: "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God"?

4
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,152
And howhe said
that King Solomon in all his glory

5
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,198
was not as beautiful as
the lilies of the field?

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,795
And l know you won't forget
"Judge not lest ye be judged",

7
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,911
because l explained that to you.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,230
And then the good Lord went on to say:

9
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,791
"Beware of false prophets

10
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,829
which come to you in sheep's clothing

11
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,754
but inwardly they are ravening wolves."

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,829
"Ye shall know them by their fruits."

13
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,431
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,

14
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,831
45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,078
75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100!

16
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,231
Here l come, ready or not.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,951
What's wrong?

18
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,113
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,

19
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,277
neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit."

20
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,110
"Wherefore by their fruits
ye shall know them."

21
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,191
Well now, what's it to be, Lord?

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,671
Another widow?

23
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,031
How many's it been? Six?

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,671
Twelve?

25
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,111
l disremember.

26
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,590
You say the word, Lord. l'm on my way.

27
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,475
You always send me money
to go forth and preach your word.

28
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,869
A widow with a little wad of bills
hid away in the sugar bowl.

29
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,271
Lord, l am tired.

30
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,353
Sometimes l wonder
if you really understand.

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,148
Not that you mind the killings.
Your book is full of killings.

32
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,390
But there are things you do hate, Lord.

33
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,471
Perfume-smelling things.

34
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,150
Lacy things. Things with curly hair.

35
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,391
There are too many ofthem.

36
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,671
You can't kill a world.

37
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,437
You driving a touring car
with a Moundsville licence?

38
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,988
Harry Powell,
for the theft ofthat touring car

39
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,072
you'll spend 30 days
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

40
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,119
 Preacher Harry Powell.
 A car thief. Picked up where you were.

41
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,712
A man of God? Harry Powell...

42
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,312
Hold Miss Jenny still.

43
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,391
Stand still, Miss Jenny.

44
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,630
There. What's so hard about that?

45
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,431
Daddy!

46
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,830
 Where's your mom?
 Out shopping.

47
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,429
You're bleeding, Dad.

48
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,150
Listen. We have to hide this money before
they get to me. There's close to $10,000.

49
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,073
Where? Under a rock
in the smokehouse? No, no.

50
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,479
Under the bricks in the grape arbour.
No, no. They'd dig for it.

51
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,831
Sure. That's the place.

52
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,031
 That's him.
 He probably still has that gun.

53
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,597
Listen to me, son. You've got to swear.
Swear means promise.

54
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,797
First swear you'll take care of little Pearl.
Guard her with your life, boy.

55
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,474
Then swear you won't never tell where
the money's hid. Not even your mom.

56
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,879
 Yes, Dad.
 You understand?

57
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,599
 Not even her?
 You've got common sense, she ain't.

58
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,636
When you grow up
that money'll belong to you.

59
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,359
Now stand up straight.
Raise your right hand.

60
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,672
 Now swear. l'll guard Pearl with my life.
 l will guard Pearl with my life.

61
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,675
 And l won't never tell about the money.
 And l won't never tell about the money.

62
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,951
You, Pearl. You swear too.

63
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,951
Ben Harper.

64
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,920
l'm going now, children. Goodbye.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,195
Drop that gun, Harper.
We don't want the kids hurt.

66
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,794
Just mind what you swore, son.
Mind, boy.

67
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,191
Don't.

68
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,551
Don't!

69
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,911
Dad.

70
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,033
Ben Harper, it is the sentence ofthis court

71
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,473
that for the murder of Ed Smiley
and Corey South

72
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,233
you be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

73
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,431
May God have mercy on your soul.

74
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,311
l got you all buffaloed.

75
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,714
You ain't none of you
gonna get it out of me.

76
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,191
Where, Ben? Where?

77
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,876
Where?

78
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,110
And a little child shall lead them.

79
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,711
Come on, boy. Tell me.

80
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,318
Ben! l'm a man of God.

81
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,312
 Making me talk about it in my sleep.
 No, Ben. No.

82
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,391
What did l say?

83
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,232
You was quoting the scripture, Ben.

84
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,153
You said
"And a little child shall lead them."

85
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,751
You killed two men, Ben Harper.

86
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,354
That's right, Preacher. l robbed that bank

87
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,560
cos l got tired of seeing children
roaming the woodlands without food.

88
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,989
Children roaming the highways
in this year of Depression.

89
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,510
Children sleeping in old abandoned
car bodies on junk heaps.

90
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,831
l promised myself l'd never see
the day when my young 'uns would want.

91
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,150
With that $10,000
l could build a tabernacle

92
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,471
and make that Wheeling lsland tabernacle
look like a chicken house.

93
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,710
Would you have free candy for the kids?

94
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,792
Think of it, Ben.
With that cursed, bloody gold.

95
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,558
How come you got that stickknife
hid up in your blankets, Preacher?

96
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,189
The Lord blinded mine enemies when
they brought me in this evil place.

97
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,556
l smuggled it in right under
the noses ofthem guards.

98
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,631
"l come not with peace,

99
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,310
 but with a sword."
 You, Preacher?

100
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,308
The sword has served me through
many an evil time, Ben Harper.

101
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,354
What religion do you profess, Preacher?

102
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,399
The religion the Almighty and me
worked out betwixt us.

103
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,871
l'll bet!

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,673
Salvation is a lastminute business, boy.

105
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,036
Keep talking, Preacher.

106
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,076
lf you let that money serve the Lord,

107
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,879
 he might feel kindly towards you.
 Keep talking.

108
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,078
Now, don't you think the Lord might
change his mind if you was to...

109
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,550
Lord, you sure knowed
what you was doing

110
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,117
when you put me
in this very cell at this very time.

111
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,511
A man with $10,000 hid somewhere
and a widow in the making.

112
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,153
 Any trouble?
 No.

113
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,435
He was a cool one, that Harper.
Never broke.

114
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,511
Carried on some. Kicked.

115
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,837
 They say he left a wife and two kids.
 l never heard.

116
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,396
 He never told about the money?
 No.

117
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,550
What do you figure he done with it?

118
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,593
He took the secret with him
when l dropped him.

119
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,630
That you, Bart? Supper's waiting.

120
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,638
Mother, sometimes l think it might be
better if l was to quit myjob as guard.

121
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,271
You're always this way when there's a
hanging. You never have to be there.

122
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,475
Sometimes l wish l was back in the mine.

123
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,791
And leave me a widow after
another blast like the one in '24?

124
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,871
Not on your life, old mister.

125
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,718
& Hing, hang, hung

126
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,189
& See what the hangman done

127
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,231
& See what the hangman done

128
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,231
& Hung, hang, hing

129
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,276
& See the robber swing

130
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,393
& Hing, hang, hung

131
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,471
& Now my song is done

132
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,110
Are you going to buy it, John?

133
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,389
So your mommy's
keeping you out of school.

134
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,791
How is your poor, poor mother?

135
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,196
She's at Spoon's icecream parlour.

136
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,718
Did they ever find out what your father
done with all that money he stole?

137
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,231
Pearl and me, we have to go.

138
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,476
 You'd better not sing that song.
 Why?

139
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,551
Cos you're too little.

140
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,638
Can we get some candy?

141
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,831
No.

142
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,639
Willa Harper, there are certain
plain facts of life that adds up

143
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,598
just like two plus two makes four,
and one ofthem is this.

144
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,433
No woman is able to raise
growing youngsters alone.

145
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,310
 The Lord meant thatjob for two.
 lcey, l just don't want a husband.

146
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,799
T'ain't a question ofwanting
or not wanting.

147
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,313
You've got two little young 'uns.

148
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,153
lt's a man you need in the house,
Willa Harper.

149
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,911
Tell me a story, John.

150
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,553
Well, once upon a time...

151
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,916
there was a rich king
who had himself a son and a daughter.

152
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,634
They all lived in a castle over in Africa.

153
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,792
Then one day this king
got taken away by some bad men.

154
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,389
Before he got took off he told his son to
kill anyone who tried to steal his gold.

155
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,793
And before long,
the bad men came back and...

156
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,031
Just a man.

157
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,875
Good night, Pearl.
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.

158
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,872
Night, Miss Jenny.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

159
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,990
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing
no more but she still blows as she passes.

160
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,150
Come on in and have a cup of coffee, boy.

161
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,471
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.

162
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,839
Ain't nobody going to neither,
as long as Uncle Birdie's round.

163
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,714
First day myjoints is limber enough l'll
haul her out and give her a good caulking.

164
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,709
 Ain't seen you in a coon's age, boy.
 l've been minding Pearl.

165
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,635
Ain't it a caution what a woman'll load
onto a man's back when he ain't looking?

166
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,113
Excuse me, Cap, while l...
sweeten my coffee.

167
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,912
Dead and gone these twenty-five year
and never takes her eyes off me.

168
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,472
Man of my years needs a little snort
in the morning to heat the boilers.

169
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,758
Yeah.

170
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,470
l was talking to this stranger up at
the boarding house. He knowed your dad.

171
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,795
 Where'd he know Dad?
 l'll not hide it.

172
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,553
He knowed him
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

173
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,519
 l've got to go now, Uncle Birdie.
 Why, you just got here, boy.

174
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,354
l told Mom l'd be back
to Spoon's for Pearl.

175
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,796
God works in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform.

176
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,597
Yes, l was with Brother Harper
right up to the end.

177
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,230
Now that l'm no longer employed by
the penitentiary

178
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,914
it is myjoy to bring this
small comfort to his loved ones.

179
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,434
lt's a mighty good man
would go out of his way

180
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,193
to bring a word of cheer
to a grieving widow.

181
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,352
So you ain't with the state no more?

182
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,396
No, brother, l resigned only yesterday.

183
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,792
The heartrending spectacle ofthem
poor men was just too much for me.

184
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,509
Ah, little lad,
you're staring at my fingers.

185
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,354
Would you like me to tell you the little
story of Righthand, Lefthand?

186
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,431
The story of good and evil.

187
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,191
H-ATE.

188
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,599
lt was with this left hand

189
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,956
that old Brother Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

190
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,031
LO-VE.

191
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,751
See these fingers, dear hearts? They has
veins that run straight to the soul of man.

192
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,434
The right hand, friends.
The hand of love.

193
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,314
Now watch and
l'll show you the story of life.

194
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,154
These fingers is always a-warring and
a-tugging, one agin t'other.

195
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,431
Now watch 'em.

196
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,351
Old Brother Lefthand.

197
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,271
Lefthand hates a-fighting.

198
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,351
And it looks like Love's a goner.

199
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,711
But wait a minute!

200
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,996
Hot dog! Love's a?winning.

201
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,595
Yes, sirree. lt's Love that won.

202
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,873
And old Lefthand Hate
is down for the count.

203
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,031
l never heard it better told.

204
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,675
l wish every soul in this community
could get the benefit.

205
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,639
You've just got to stay
for our picnic Sunday.

206
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,837
No, l must wend my way downriver
on the Lord's business.

207
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,434
You ain't leaving in no hurry
if we can help it.

208
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,317
John, mind your manners!

209
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,789
Take that look off your face. Act nice.

210
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,594
He don't mean no impudence,
do you, boy?

211
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,231
Do you, boy?

212
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,557
Many's the time poor Brother Ben
told me about these young 'uns.

213
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,993
What did he tell you?

214
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,550
He told me what fine little lambs
you and your sister both was.

215
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,232
ls that all?

216
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,232
Why, no, boy.
He told me lots and lots ofthings.

217
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,111
 Nice things, boy.
 Thank you.

218
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,314
My, that fudge smells yummy.

219
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,277
lt's for the picnic.

220
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,036
And you don't get a smidgen of my fudge
unless you stayfor the picnic.

221
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,394
Don't he have the grandest singing voice?

222
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,994
John! Pearl!
Run along and play, you two.

223
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,874
 Where?
 Down by the river. My goodness!

224
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,991
That fella's aching to settle down with
some nice woman and make a home.

225
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,868
lcey, it's awful soon after Ben's passing.

226
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,030
lf ever l saw a sign from heaven...

227
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,992
 John don't like him much.
 Pearl dotes on him.

228
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,271
The boy worries me.

229
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,069
l know it's silly, but it's like there's
something still between him and his dad.

230
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,151
What he needs is a dose of salts.

231
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,989
 Oh, there's something else.
 What?

232
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,510
The money.

233
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,718
l declare, Willa Harper, you'll let
that money haunt you to your grave.

234
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,472
lcey, l would love to be satisfied

235
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,313
that Harry Powell don't think
l got that money hid somewhere.

236
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,914
You come right out
and ask that man of God.

237
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,393
Mr Powell! Clear that evil mud
out of your soul.

238
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,269
John! Pearl!
Come along here and get some fudge.

239
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,874
 l don't want no fudge.
 You do what you're told!

240
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,712
You go set down by the river.

241
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,473
 Oh, lcey, l'm a sight.
 Get along with you!

242
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,831
You...!

243
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,394
That young lady better look sharp or
some smart sister is gonna snap him up.

244
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,471
She's not the only fish in the river!

245
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,552
Now you two stay put.
Shillyshallying around.

246
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,751
A husband's one piece of store goods
you never know

247
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,195
till you get it home and take the paper off.

248
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,115
Did Ben Harper ever tell you what
he done with the money he stole?

249
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,191
My dear child, don't you know?

250
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,071
She's mooning about Ben Harper.

251
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,672
That wasn't love. That was just
flapdoodle. Have some fudge, lambs.

252
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,478
When you've been married
to a man 40 years,

253
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,313
you know all that
don't amount to a hill of beans.

254
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,109
l've been married to my Walt that long
and l swear, in all that time,

255
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,873
l just lie there thinking about my canning.

256
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,111
John!

257
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,396
A woman's a fool to marry for that.
That's something for a man.

258
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,190
The good Lord never meant for a decent
woman to want that. Not really want it.

259
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,670
lt's all just a fake and a pipe dream.

260
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,838
John, Mr Powell has something to tell you.

261
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,396
Well, John.

262
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,871
The night before your father died he
told me what he did with that money.

263
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,474
That money's at the bottom ofthe river,
wrapped around a 12pound cobblestone.

264
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,191
Thank you, Harry.

265
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,438
l feel clean now.

266
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,637
My whole body's just aquivering
with cleanness.

267
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,429
John, come here. Your tie is crooked.

268
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,876
 When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
 Can't hear you, boy.

269
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,517
When'll the skiff be ready?

270
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,435
Have her ready inside a week
and then we'll go fishing.

271
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,910
 How's your ma?
 Oh, she's all right.

272
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,956
 How's sister Pearl?
 Just fine.

273
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,952
 You leaving, boy?
 Got to watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

274
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,713
Well, good night, boy.
Come again any time.

275
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,839
And mind, boy, l'll have your
pa's skiff shipshape inside a week.

276
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,031
Somebody there?

277
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,631
Anybody there?

278
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,591
Anybody here?

279
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,671
Good evening, John.

280
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,473
l had a little talk with
your mother tonight, John.

281
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,872
And your mother decided it might be best
for me to let you know the news.

282
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,192
Your mother told me she wanted me to
be a daddy to you and your sister.

283
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,271
We're going to get married, boy.

284
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,031
Did you hear what l said, boy?

285
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,112
Married. We're going to
Sisterville tomorrow.

286
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,714
 And when we get back...
 You ain't my dad.

287
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,638
You'll never be my dad.

288
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,757
When we get back
we're all going to be friends

289
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,870
and share our fortunes together, John.

290
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,077
You think you can make me tell,
but l won't. l won't!

291
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,192
 Tell me what, boy?
 Nothing.

292
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,748
We're not keeping secrets
from each other, are we?

293
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,231
No.

294
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,711
Well, no matter.

295
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,310
We've got a long time together, boy.

296
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,509
Wave your hands! Great sakes!

297
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,192
Now you wait here
while l get your night things.

298
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,991
Now can l tell?

299
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,672
When Mr Powell's our daddy
then can l tell him about it?

300
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,557
 You swore, Pearl.
 John, don't.

301
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,949
You promised Dad you wouldn't tell.

302
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,270
l love Mr Powell lots and lots, John.

303
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,791
Men!

304
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,711
Harry?

305
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,631
Fix that window shade.

306
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,271
l was praying.

307
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,358
l'm sorry. l didn't know. l thought...

308
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,034
You thought, Willa,
that the moment you walked in that door

309
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,157
l'd start to pawing you
in that abominable way

310
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,357
that men are supposed to do
on their wedding night.

311
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,511
 Ain't that right, now?
 No.

312
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,838
l think it's time we made one thing
perfectly clear, Willa.

313
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,550
Marriage to me represents a blending of
two spirits in the sight of heaven.

314
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,791
Get up, Willa.

315
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,671
 Harry, what...
 Get up.

316
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,912
Now, go look at yourself yonder
in that mirror.

317
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,671
Do as l say.

318
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,871
Look at yourself.

319
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,951
What do you see, girl?

320
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,591
You see the body of a woman.

321
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,234
The temple of creation and motherhood.

322
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,155
You see the flesh of Eve
that man since Adam has profaned.

323
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,710
That body was meant
for begetting children.

324
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,950
lt was not meant for the lust of men.

325
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,516
Do you want more children, Willa?

326
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,238
l...

327
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,719
No.

328
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,951
lt's the business ofthis marriage
to mind those two you have now,

329
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,996
not to beget more.

330
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,071
Yes.

331
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,917
All right. You can get in bed now
and stop shivering.

332
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,076
Help me to get clean, so l can be
what Harry wants me to be.

333
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,111
Meanest, orneriest, sneakiest critter
in the whole river, boy. A gar.

334
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,312
 Here are your hooks, Uncle Birdie.
 Pshaw, boy!

335
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,153
Ain't a hook in the land
strong enough to land Mr Gar.

336
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,276
What a fella needs is mother wit
and a horse hair.

337
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,270
Golly! Won't it bust it, Uncle Birdie?

338
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,794
No, horse hair'll hold a lumpin' whale!

339
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,631
 You mind my cussin', boy?
 No.

340
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,517
Well, the reason l ask,
your steppa bein' a preacher an' all...

341
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,032
Never was much of a one
for preachers my own self.

342
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,916
l don't know what's wrong
up at your house,

343
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,276
but always remember, Cap,
if you're ever in trouble,

344
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,195
holler and come arunnin'.
Uncle Birdie's your friend.

345
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,350
There! You slimy, snag-toothed,
baitstealin' soandso!

346
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,111
Amen.

347
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,191
 You have all sinned.
 Yes!

348
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,991
But which one of you can say,
as l can say,

349
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,070
that you drove a good man to murder?

350
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,958
Because l kept ahoundin' him for
perfume and clothes and face paint!

351
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,156
And... he slew two human beings!

352
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,268
And he come to me and he said

353
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,876
"Take this money and buy yourself
the clothes and the paint."

354
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,231
But brethren...

355
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,509
Oh, that's where the Lord stepped in!

356
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,229
Yes!

357
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,117
Alleluia!

358
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,715
He said, the Lord, to that man

359
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,996
"You take that money
and you throw it in the river!"

360
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,431
 ln the river!
 ln the river!

361
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,114
Now, you're John and you're Pearl.

362
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,796
You'll get awful mad, John. l done a sin.

363
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,471
l didn't tell no one.

364
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,669
lt's all here.

365
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,678
John?

366
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,590
Yes?

367
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,513
 What are you doin', boy?
 Gettin' Pearl to bed.

368
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,512
 What's takin' you so long about it?
 Nothing.

369
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,276
What's that you're playin' with?

370
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,679
Pearl's junk.

371
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,832
Mom gets mad when she plays out here
and don't put it away.

372
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,911
Come on, children.

373
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,151
Off to bed with the both of you.

374
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,511
Come here, John.

375
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,749
Your mother tells me you tattled on me.

376
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,236
She said you told her
l asked where that money was hid.

377
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,718
That wasn't very nice, boy. Have a heart.

378
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,591
Yeah!

379
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,276
Well, it doesn't matter.
lt's your word against mine.

380
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,517
lt's me your mother believes.

381
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,513
Were you impudent again
to Mr Powell, John?

382
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,631
Mom, l didn't mean it.

383
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,911
What were you impudent about?

384
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,869
He asked me about
the money again, Mom.

385
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,670
John, you always make up that lie.

386
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,749
There is no money. Why can't you
get that through your head?

387
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,434
The boy's as stubborn
and as mulish as a sheep.

388
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,873
lt's a shame.

389
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,678
 Good night, lcey.
 Good night, honey.

390
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,990
Good night, Walt.

391
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,071
Plan on a longer visit next time.

392
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,034
You hardly settle before
you're frettin' to get home.

393
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,680
l'm needed to keep peace
and harmony betwixt them.

394
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,194
lt's my burden and l'm proud of it, lcey.

395
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,430
 Where's the money hid?
 l don't know.

396
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,432
She thinks that money's
at the bottom ofthe river.

397
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,715
But you and me,
we know better, don't we?

398
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,791
l don't know nothin'.

399
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,232
Well, never mind, boy.
The summer's young yet.

400
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,712
Pearl. Come here.

401
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,038
John's a fella likes to keep secrets.
l'll tell you a secret.

402
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,112
 Yes?
 l knowed your daddy.

403
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,750
And you know what your daddy told me?

404
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,671
He said "You tell my little girl Pearl there's
to be no secrets between her and you."

405
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,478
Yes?

406
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,551
All right. Now it's your turn.

407
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,951
What secret shall l tell?

408
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,191
What's your name?

409
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,669
You're just fooling. My name's Pearl!

410
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,309
Well, l reckon l'll have to try again.

411
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,991
Where's the money hid?

412
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,752
Pearl! You swore you wouldn't tell!
You swore!

413
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,350
You hit Daddy with the hairbrush.

414
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,197
Now, you see?
We can't have anything to do with John.

415
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,233
You and me'll go on down
to the parlour, Pearl.

416
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,758
John's just plumb bad
through and through.

417
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,832
 John's bad.
 Yes, John's bad.

418
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,032
 Tell me another secret about my dad.
 Oh, no! Your turn.

419
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,350
All right. What secret shall l tell?

420
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,589
 Where's the money hid?
 John's bad.

421
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,111
Where's the money hid?

422
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,392
Tell me, you little wretch,
or l'll tear your arm off!

423
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,477
 lcey, l'm worried about Willa.
 How do you mean?

424
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,354
l'm figurin' how to say it
so as you won't get mad.

425
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,396
Say what, Walt Spoon?

426
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,675
 Somethin's wrong about it.
 About what?

427
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,149
 About Mr Powell. All of it.
 Walt...!

428
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,630
 A body's got a right to their feelings.
 May the Lord have mercy on you.

429
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,075
l was just...

430
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,031
Amen.

431
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,191
Are you through praying?

432
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,551
l'm through, Harry.

433
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,114
You were listening
outside the parlour window.

434
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,192
 lt ain't in the river, is it, Harry?
 Answer me.

435
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,917
Ben never told you he throwed it
in the river, did he?

436
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,317
The children know where it's hid.
John knows. ls that it, Harry?

437
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,076
Then it's still here amongst us.
Tainting us.

438
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,313
You must have known about it
all along, Harry.

439
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,593
But that ain't the reason
why you married me.

440
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,311
l know that much.

441
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,234
Because the Lord just wouldn't let it be.

442
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,112
He made you marry me so you could
show me the Way and the Life.

443
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,711
And the salvation of my soul.

444
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,871
Ain't that so, Harry?

445
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,517
So you might say that it was the money
that brung us together.

446
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,671
The rest of it don't matter.

447
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,911
Walt. Come quick.

448
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,116
 What's wrong, Mother?
 Shhh! He's in there.

449
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,034
 Who?
 Mr Powell. Willa has run away.

450
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,319
 l'll be switched! Just went?
 She took out in that old Model T.

451
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,990
 ls he hit pretty bad?
 All to pieces.

452
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,150
Well, there's a little
peach brandy in here...

453
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,152
 A man ofthe cloth?
 Well, just a sip.

454
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,873
Walt Spoon, that's for sickness
in the house!

455
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,111
 Well, what can we do?
 lf you talked to him, another man...

456
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,998
Now, Mother, please. l'm no good at...

457
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,989
Mr Powell?

458
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,640
 A strange woman is a narrow pit.
 Amen.

459
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,271
She lieth in wait as for prey and
increaseth the transgressors among men.

460
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,679
Oh, my dear friends.
Whatever would l do without you?

461
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,991
 Mr Powell!
 Well, ifthere's anythin' we can...

462
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,436
No, it's my shame. lt's my crown
of thorns. l must wear it bravely.

463
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,432
 What could have possessed that girl?
 Satan.

464
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,117
Didn't you have no inklin'?

465
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,509
Yes, l did. From the very first night.

466
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,951
 First night?
 Our honeymoon.

467
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,711
How's that?

468
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,952
 She turned me out ofthe bed.
 No!

469
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,432
Well, what do you figure to do?

470
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,956
Do? Why, just stay right here
and take care ofthem kids.

471
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,151
Maybe it was never meant for a woman
like Willa to taint their young lives.

472
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,038
lt's mighty brave of you.

473
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,476
l reckon it was just ordained that way,
Brother Spoon.

474
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,230
Didn't she leave no word?

475
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,272
A scrawl. On a notepaper on the bureau.

476
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,031
l burned it.

477
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,397
Tore it up and burned it,
it stank so strong of hellfire.

478
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,277
Amen!

479
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,318
The pitcher has went to the well
once too often, friends.

480
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,994
Oh, she'll come
draggin' her tail back home.

481
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,709
She'll not be back.
l reckon l'm safe in promisin' you that.

482
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,956
 Maybe she's just on a spree.
 Oh, no.

483
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,279
 Well, there's no harm in hopin'.
 Ain't no sense in it neither.

484
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,558
l figured somethin' was brewin'
when she went to bed last night.

485
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,631
How?

486
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,993
Well, she tarried around
in the kitchen after l'd gone up.

487
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,197
And when l went downstairs
to see what was wrong...

488
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,868
Well, she'd found
this jar of dandelion wine

489
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,239
that the husband, this Harper,
had hid somewheres in the cellar.

490
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,791
She was drinkin'.

491
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,439
l tried to save her.

492
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,115
l know you did, Mr Powell.
Oh, l knowhowhard you tried.

493
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,191
But the devil wins sometimes.

494
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,872
Can't nobody say
l didn't do my best to save her.

495
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,838
Children!

496
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,911
Pearl?

497
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,271
Careful.

498
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,151
Why do we have to hide, John?

499
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,514
Where's Mom?

500
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,955
 She's gone to Moundsville.
 To see Dad?

501
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,031
Yes, l reckon that's it.

502
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,312
Now, listen to me, Pearl.
You and me is runnin' offtonight.

503
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,118
Why?

504
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,839
lf we stay here
somethin' awful'll happen to us.

505
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,070
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?

506
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,237
No. That's just it. No.

507
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,396
 Where we going, John?
 Somewheres. l don't know yet.

508
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,633
l'm hungry, John.

509
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,712
 We'll steal somethin' to eat.
 lt'll spoil our suppers.

510
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,791
Pearl?

511
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,878
l can hear you whisperin', children,
so l know you're down there.

512
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,190
l can feel myself gettin' awful mad.

513
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,595
l'm out of patience, children.
l'm coming to find you now.

514
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,551
Mr Powell!

515
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,591
Well, well, Mrs Spoon.

516
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,268
 Where are the children?
 Down there in that cellar playin' games.

517
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,351
And they won't mind me when l call them.

518
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,431
l'm at my wit's end, Mrs Spoon.

519
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,671
John? Pearl?

520
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,191
Shake a leg!

521
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,433
Well, well, well! What's that?

522
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,717
Just a little hot supper
l fixed for you and the children.

523
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,189
lt seemed the least we could do.

524
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,269
l won't have you worryin'
poor Mr Powell another minute.

525
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,272
Just look at you!
Dust and filth from top to toe.

526
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,869
Want me to take 'em up
and wash 'em good?

527
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,357
No. No, thank you, dear lcey.
l'll tend to them. Thank you.

528
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,519
Don't be too hard on them, Preacher.
Poor, motherless children.

529
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,116
Remember, now, Mr Powell.
Don't be afraid to call on us.

530
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,838
Goodbye.

531
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,309
Goodbye, Mrs Spoon. And thanks again.

532
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,598
Now, weren't you afraid, little lambs?
Down there in all that dark?

533
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,151
They'll think it was me.

534
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,313
They'll think it was poor old Uncle Birdie.

535
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,470
Oh, if you could have seen it, Bess.

536
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,191
Down there in the deep place.

537
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:39,877
With her hair wavin' soft and lazy
like meadow grass under flood water.

538
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,797
And that slit in her throat
like she had an extra mouth.

539
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,476
You're the only human mortal
l can go to, Bess.

540
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,878
lf l go to the law, they'll hang it on me.

541
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,237
Sweet heaven, save poor old Uncle Birdie!

542
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,275
 l'm hungry.
 Sure.

543
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,471
And there's fried chicken, sweet
potatoes, corn bread and apple cobbler.

544
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,273
 Can l have my supper, please?
 Naturally.

545
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,439
 Can l have milk too?
 Mmhm. But first we'll have a little talk.

546
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,031
 About our secrets.
 No.

547
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,880
 And why not, pray tell?
 Cos John said l mustn't.

548
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,951
Never mind what John said!

549
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,831
John's a meddler.

550
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,911
Now stop that snivellin'.

551
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,190
Looky here. You know what that is?

552
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,469
Want to see somethin' cute? Now looky.

553
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,631
How about that!

554
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,231
This is what l use on meddlers.

555
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,991
John might be a meddler.

556
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,715
No, little lamb. Don't touch it.

557
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,756
Don't touch my knife.
That makes me mad. Very, very mad.

558
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,954
Now, just tell me. Where's the money hid?

559
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,549
But l swore.
l promised John l wouldn't tell.

560
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,631
John doesn't matter!

561
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,675
Can't l get that through your head,
you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch?

562
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,869
There now. You made me lose my temper.

563
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,638
l'm sorry. l'm real sorry.

564
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,034
Now, just tell me. Where's it hid, honey?

565
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,948
 l'll tell.
 l told youto keep your mouth shut.

566
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,238
lt ain't fair to make Pearl tell
when she swore she wouldn't. l'll tell.

567
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,799
Well, l declare!

568
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,509
Sometimes l think poor ol' John
might make it to heaven yet.

569
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,755
 All right, boy. Where's the money?
 ln the cellar. Under a stone in the floor.

570
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,512
 lt'll go hard if l find you're lyin', boy.
 l'm not lyin'. Go look for yourself.

571
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,791
All right.

572
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,311
 Come along.
 What?

573
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,511
Go ahead of me. The both of you.

574
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,791
Down those stairs.

575
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,910
You don't reckon l'd leave you,
do you, boy?

576
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,788
 Well, don't you believe me?
 Why, sure, boy. Sure.

577
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,550
And where now? Mind, no tricks, now.

578
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,791
l can't abide a liar.

579
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,991
Yonder.

580
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,031
Oh, no, you don't.

581
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,836
 Now where, boy, where?
 Under the stone in the floor.

582
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,111
This is concrete.

583
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,158
John made a sin. John told a lie.

584
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,831
The Lord's a-talking to me now.

585
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,508
He's asaying "A liar
is an abomination before mine eyes."

586
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,111
Speak, boy, where's it hid?

587
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,551
Speak.

588
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,077
Speak, or l'll cut your throat and leave you
to drip like a hog in butchering time.

589
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,038
Pearl, shut up. Pearl, you swore!

590
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,158
You could save him, little bird.

591
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,551
lt's in my doll!

592
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,991
The doll!

593
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,751
Why, sure!

594
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,714
The last place anybody'd think to look.

595
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,949
Uncle Birdie Steptoe.

596
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,199
Open that door, you spawn
of the devil's own strumpet!

597
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,751
Uncle Birdie!

598
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,112
 Uncle Birdie.
 John.

599
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,756
Hide us, Uncle Birdie.
He's acoming with his knife.

600
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,192
lt's me. John Harper and Pearl.
You told me to come.

601
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,396
 Johnny?
 Uncle Birdie, oh, please.

602
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,277
Please! Wake up!

603
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,397
l swear on the Book, l never done it.

604
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,591
There's still the river.

605
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,351
The skiff is under the willow.

606
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,511
Children!

607
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,632
"Dear Walt and lcey,

608
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,757
l bet you've been worried
and gave us up for lost."

609
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,592
"Took the kids down here with me
for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm."

610
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,552
"Thought a little change of scenery
would do us all a world of good

611
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,029
after so much trouble and heartache."

612
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,389
"At least the kids will get
aplenty of good home cooking."

613
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,312
"Your devoted Harry Powell."

614
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,391
Now, ain't you relieved, Walt?

615
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:09,628
Sure. But you was worried too, Mother.
Taking offwith never a word of goodbye!

616
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,917
l figured them gypsies busted in
and done offwith all three ofthem.

617
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,434
You and your gypsies.
They been gone a week.

618
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,433
Sure. But not before one of 'em
knifed a farmer and stole his horse.

619
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,829
Never caught the gypsy. Nor the horse.

620
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,791
Such times,
when young 'uns run the roads.

621
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,871
Go away, children.

622
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,918
Hungry, l suppose?

623
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,197
Well, l can't spare you more
than one potato apiece.

624
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,274
 Where are yourfolks?
 Ain't got none.

625
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,391
Oh, go away, go away.

626
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,671
An ungrateful child is an
abomination before the eyes of God.

627
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,595
The world is going to damnation because
of young 'uns flying in the face of age.

628
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,878
They make soup out ofthem,

629
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,157
but l wouldn't know
how to go about getting him open.

630
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,069
We're going to spend the night on land.

631
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,549
Are we going home now, John?

632
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,709
Don't he never sleep?

633
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,471
Pearl, wake up. Come on!

634
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,477
You two youngsters
get up here to me this instant.

635
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,152
Get on up to my house.
Mind me, now. l'll get me a switch.

636
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,990
 Don't you hurt her.
 Hurt her? Wash her's more like it!

637
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,714
 Ruby! Clary! Mary!
 Yes, Miss Cooper.

638
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,871
Bring your baskets.

639
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,558
Nicely picked, Clary.

640
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,991
Mary, put the big ones on top.

641
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,515
Ruby, most ofthem
ain't fit to go to market.

642
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,033
Put them down.

643
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,829
Ruby, run to the house and fetch
the tub and put it by the pump.

644
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,117
Clary... Mary,
run up and fetch a bar of laundry soap.

645
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,519
Yes, Miss Cooper.

646
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,797
And a scrub brush!
Come on up to the house, children.

647
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,594
Gracious, if you ain't a sight to beat all!

648
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,951
Where you from?

649
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,757
Where are your folks?

650
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,831
Come on, speak up, now.

651
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,593
Gracious,
so l've got two more mouths to feed.

652
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,950
Howdy, Miss Cooper.
What happened to my milk?

653
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,519
Price of milk what it is, not on your life.

654
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,229
Do better making butter
with the cream. Sell it retail.

655
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,835
Make smearcase for the children,
feed what's left to my hogs.

656
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,036
 She talks to herself.
 All the time.

657
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,715
 Your ma's funny.
 She ain't our ma. We just live with her.

658
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,230
 Where are your folks?
 Someplace.

659
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,117
My daddy's in Detroit.

660
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,671
Mary!

661
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,871
Honey. Good morning, Miss Cooper.

662
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,110
l'm saving up to buy you a bracelet.

663
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:46,234
Never mind that, don't forget your visit
this Sunday  and come to church with us.

664
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,271
See you Sunday, love.

665
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,031
Take your baskets in, children.

666
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,397
Women is fools.

667
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,471
All of 'em.

668
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,671
Looky there.

669
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,194
She'll be losing her mind
to a tricky mouth and a full moon,

670
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:06,114
and like as not, l'll be saddled
with the consequences.

671
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,831
Here's what you owe me.

672
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,031
One, two, three, four, five...

673
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,276
Where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?

674
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,759
She went.

675
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,831
John, you go find Ruby.

676
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,510
Big Ruby's my bothersome girl.
She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em.

677
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,832
But she's got mother hands with the
young 'uns, so what are you to say?

678
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,351
How about tonight, Ruby?

679
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,749
 What gives?
 The old lady's around.

680
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,911
How about Thursday?

681
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,550
The old gal thinks she comes in
for sewing lessons on Thursday.

682
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,631
Miss Cooper wants you.

683
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,553
And will you show me your dolly,
little lady?

684
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,671
l see you got two more peeps
to your brood.

685
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,150
 Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
 How's your own boy, Miss Cooper?

686
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,870
Haven't heard from Ralph since last
Christmas. Still, l've got a new crop.

687
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,792
l'm a strong tree
with branches for many birds.

688
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,715
l'm good for something in this old world,
and l know it too.

689
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,559
Now, old Pharaoh,
he was king of Egypt land,

690
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,918
and he had a daughter.

691
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,471
And once upon a time,

692
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,992
she was walking along by the river bank

693
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,595
and she seen something bumping
and scraping along on a sand bar

694
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:47,309
down under the willows.
And you know what it was, children?

695
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,556
No.

696
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,279
Now, it was a skiff, washed up on the bar.

697
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,312
And who do you reckon was in it?

698
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,391
Pearl and John.

699
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:01,590
Not this time. There was only
one young 'un, a little boy babe.

700
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,833
 And you know who he was, children?
 No.

701
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,592
lt was Moses. A king of men.

702
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,191
Moses, children.

703
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,671
Now, offto bed with you.

704
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,634
John, get me an apple.

705
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,271
And get one for yourselftoo.

706
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,991
John, where are your folks?

707
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,351
Dead.

708
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,071
Where are you from?

709
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,311
Upriver.

710
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,751
l didn't figure you'd rowed that skiff
all the way up from Parkersburg.

711
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,831
Tell me that story again.

712
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,271
Story? What story, honey?

713
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,913
About them kings.

714
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,709
And the queen found down on
the sand bar that time in the skiff.

715
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,872
Kings?
Why, there was only one king, honey.

716
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,111
l mind you said there was two.

717
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,880
Well, shoot now. Maybe there was.

718
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,669
Yes, come to think of it, there was two.

719
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,350
Must be Thursday. Here comes Ruby.

720
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,711
Here l go.

721
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,915
Why, you're Ruby, ain't you, my child?

722
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,194
Can l have this?

723
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,714
Surely. l'd like to talk to you, my dear.

724
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,552
 Will you buy me an ice cream?
 Of course.

725
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,915
 Watch out, Preacher.
 Why, Preacher!

726
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,991
Shut your dirty mouths.

727
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,193
Ain't l pretty?

728
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,159
Why, you're the prettiest thing
l ever seen in all my wandering.

729
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,674
Ain't nobody never told you that, Ruby?

730
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,355
No, no one never did.

731
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,079
There's two new ones out your place,
ain't there?

732
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,151
Uhhuh.

733
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,829
 What's their names?
 Pearl and John.

734
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,076
 ls there a doll?
 Only they don't never let me play with it.

735
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,871
Did you ever see such pretty eyes
in all your born days?

736
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,678
Don't let him get away, sugar.

737
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,311
He ain't like you all. Next time, l won't
even ask him to buy me an ice cream.

738
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,311
l's bitten bad.

739
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,037
 Ruby, you didn't have money to buy this.
 You'll whip me.

740
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,678
When did l ever?

741
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,196
 This man at the drugstore, he gave...
 The drugstore?

742
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,595
Miss Cooper, l never been
to sewing lessons all them times.

743
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,671
What you been up to, Ruby?

744
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,151
l been out with men.

745
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,671
Child.

746
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,872
You were looking for love, Ruby,
in the only foolish way you knewhow.

747
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,791
We all need love, Ruby.

748
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,391
l lost the love of my son.

749
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,791
l found it with you all.

750
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,637
You're going to grow up to be a strong,
fine woman.

751
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,634
 l'm going to see to it that you do.
 This gentleman weren't like them.

752
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,393
He just give me a book
and buy me an ice cream.

753
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,557
 Now, who was this?
 He didn't ask me for nothing.

754
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,394
 What did you talk about?
 Pearl and John.

755
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,113
John and Pearl? ls he their pap?

756
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,391
l don't know.

757
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,236
Wonder why he hasn't been to the house.

758
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,151
Miss Cooper!

759
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,960
 What?
 The man!

760
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,958
Good morning, ladies.

761
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,271
 How do?
 Why, you're Miss Cooper, l take it?

762
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,030
lt's about that John and that Pearl?

763
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,111
Oh, them poor little lambs.

764
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,635
To think l never hoped
to see them again in this world.

765
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:31,952
Oh, dear madam, if you was to know
what a crown ofthorns l've borne

766
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,190
in my search for them stray chicks.

767
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,151
Ruby, go fetch them kids.

768
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,833
Oh, madam,
l see you're looking at my hands.

769
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,439
Shall l tell you the story of Lefthand,
Righthand, the tale of good and evil?

770
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,354
lt was with this left hand that Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

771
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:55,194
 Them kids is yours?
 My own flesh and blood.

772
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,439
 Where's your missus?
 She run offwith a drummer.

773
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,554
 During prayer meeting.
 Where's she at?

774
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,108
Down the river somewheres.
Parkersburg, Cincinnati.

775
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,670
 One ofthem Sodoms ofthe Ohio river.
 She took them kids with her?

776
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,672
Oh, heaven only knows
what unholy sights and sounds

777
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,117
them innocent babes has heard in the
dens of perdition where she dragged 'em.

778
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:20,830
Right funny, ain't it, how they rode
all the way upriver in a ten-footjohn boat.

779
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,875
 Are they well, Miss Cooper?
 A sight better than they was.

780
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,756
Gracious, gracious,
you are a good woman, Miss Cooper.

781
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,508
How you figuring to raise them two
without a woman?

782
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,876
The Lord will provide.
The Lord is merciful.

783
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,755
Oh, what a day this is.

784
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,831
And there's little John.

785
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,429
 What's wrong, John?
 Come to me, boy.

786
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,393
 What's wrong, John?
 Didn't you hear me, boy?

787
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,755
When your dad says "come"
you should mind him.

788
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,637
He ain't my dad.

789
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,269
No, and he ain't no preacher neither.

790
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,317
Just march yourself yonder
to your horse, mister.

791
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,351
March, mister. l'm not foolin'!

792
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,188
All right. But you haven't
heard the last of Harry Powell yet!

793
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,516
The Lord God Jehovah
will guide my hand in vengeance.

794
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,071
You devils!

795
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,198
You whores of Babylon!

796
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,991
l'll be back! When it's dark!

797
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,231
Shame on you, Ruby, mooning around
the house after that mad dog of a man.

798
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,712
Merciful heavens!

799
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,389
Ruby, go get the children out of bed
and bring them down here.

800
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,311
Women are such darn fools.

801
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,070
lt's a hard world for little things.

802
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,674
Now, there was this sneaking,
noaccount, ornery King Herod,

803
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,876
and when he heard of
little Jesus growin' up,

804
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:17,635
he figured "Well, shoot, there
won't be room for the both of us."

805
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,319
"l'll nip this in the bud."

806
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,915
But he wasn't sure which of all them
babies in the land was King Jesus.

807
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,309
So that cruel old King Herod figured,

808
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,995
if he was to kill all the babies in the land
he'd be sure and get little Jesus.

809
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,949
When little King Jesus'
ma and pa heard about this,

810
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,519
what do you reckon they done?

811
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,114
 They hid in a closet.
 They hid under the porch.

812
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,191
No. They went arunning.

813
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,349
Well, now, John, you're right.
That's just what they done.

814
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,869
Little King Jesus' ma and pa
saddled a mule

815
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,315
and they rode all the way down
into Egypt land.

816
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,631
Yeah, and that's where the queen
found them in the bulrushes.

817
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,678
Oh, no, that wasn't the same story.
That was little King Moses.

818
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,469
But just the same, it did seem like
it was a plague time for little ones.

819
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,994
Them olden days. Them hard, hard times.

820
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,952
Figured l was gone, huh?

821
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,634
Run. Hide on the staircase. Run quick!

822
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,991
Ruby, get!

823
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,630
 What do you want?
 l want them kids.

824
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,952
What do you want them for?

825
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,873
 None of your business, madam.
 l'm giving you to the count ofthree to go.

826
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,952
Then l'm coming across
to the kitchen to shoot you!

827
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,631
Miss Booth? Rachel Cooper.

828
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,791
Get your state troopers out to my place.

829
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,030
l got something trapped in my barn.

830
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,954
 l'll go see to Pearl.
 l'll make coffee.

831
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,791
She's all right.

832
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,836
John, you know when you're little
you have more endurance

833
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,070
than God is ever to grant you again?

834
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,552
Children are man at his strongest.
They abide.

835
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:37,274
 Why didn't you call us before now?
 Didn't want your dirty shoes on my floor.

836
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,475
ls that him?

837
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,393
Yes. Mind where you shoot, boys.
There are children here.

838
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:45,598
Harry Powell, you're under arrest
for the murder ofWilla Harper.

839
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,031
Drop that knife, Powell.

840
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,515
Don't.

841
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,919
Here!

842
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,070
Take it back, Dad. Take it back!

843
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,232
l don't want it, Dad! lt's too much! Here!

844
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,191
Lynch him!

845
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,592
Bluebeard!

846
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,558
 25 wives!
 And he killed every last one of 'em.

847
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,757
 lfthe people of Marshall County...
 Bluebeard!

848
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,871
Will you identify the prisoner?

849
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,919
Please, little lad,

850
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,994
won't you look yonder and tell the court
if that is the man that killed your mother?

851
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,350
lt's all right, Mrs Cooper,
you can take the little fellow away.

852
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,710
Merry Christmas to you and yours,
Mrs Cooper.

853
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:58,032
And what's Santa Claus going to
bring you for Christmas, little man?

854
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,111
 That's Pearl!
 Get your coats.

855
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,876
Them's her orphans.

856
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,632
 Where's Ruby?
 She went.

857
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,439
Them poor little lambs.

858
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,308
Them is the ones he sinned against,
my friends.

859
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,751
Go out the back door.

860
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,470
Ain't we going to the bus depot?

861
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,430
Dragging the name ofthe Lord
through the evil mud of his soul!

862
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:39,071
 String that Bluebeard up to a post!
 He's Satan hiding behind the cross!

863
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:27,030
l love him. You think he's like them others.

864
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,791
You were so mad, you shot him.

865
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,599
 Hey, Bart.
 Yeah?

866
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:55,468
 We're saving this bird up for you.
 This time it'll be a privilege.

867
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,874
l'm glad they sent me nothing.
lt's never nothing l want.

868
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,590
Just something to show me how fancy
and smart they've come up in the world.

869
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,911
Can we give you your presents now?

870
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,551
Shoot, you don't mean to say
you got me a present? Shoot, now.

871
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,188
Ruby.

872
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,871
A potholder!

873
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,554
And it's much neater than last year, Ruby.

874
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,879
Clary.

875
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:01,189
Another potholder! Ain't that thoughtful.
l'm always burning my hands.

876
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,473
This doesn't look basted.
This looks made!

877
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,789
And you finished the edge
with a chainstitch.

878
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,871
Oh, that's just dandy, Clary.

879
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,711
Another potholder?

880
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,320
Oh, now, did you two make this together?

881
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,391
He helped us some.

882
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,594
That's the richest gift a body could have.

883
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,748
And your presents are in the
cupboard under the china closet.

884
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,679
Ruby.

885
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,351
This is yours.

886
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,519
Lord save little children.
You'd think the world'd be ashamed

887
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:13,230
to name such a day as Christmas for one
of them, then go on in the same old way.

888
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,757
My soul is humble when l see the way
little ones accept their lot.

889
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,150
Lord save little children.

890
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,549
The wind blows and the rains are cold...

891
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,511
yet they abide.

892
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,869
That watch sure is a fine loud ticker.

893
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,190
Be nice to have someone round the house
who can give me the right time of day.

894
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,794
This watch is the nicest watch l ever had.

895
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:10,598
Well, a fella just can't go around
with rundown, busted watches.

896
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,711
They abide and they endure.

897
