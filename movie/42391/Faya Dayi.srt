01:38.000 --> 01:41.125
Look how far God has brought us.

01:41.708 --> 01:44.792
We can only go where God guides us to.

01:45.042 --> 01:47.792
We are exactly where God wants us to be.

01:57.042 --> 01:58.542
Look at the creator's work.

01:58.625 --> 02:00.958
Humans, we can only see
physical appearances

02:01.125 --> 02:03.208
but can we tell what's on the inside?

04:08.333 --> 04:15.167
Once upon a time there was
an old amir called Azurkherlaini.

04:19.583 --> 04:21.583
He was a pious man.

04:25.167 --> 04:28.625
One day, fear entered him.

04:32.167 --> 04:35.958
He began to pray,

04:38.750 --> 04:47.042
"My Lord, why has fear entered me?
I know I am ready to die".

04:54.083 --> 05:01.375
That night, God spoke to him in a dream

05:07.792 --> 05:12.208
"You must find Maoul Hayat".

05:14.917 --> 05:17.250
"Maoul-Hayat" he said,

05:17.292 --> 05:22.292
"it is the water of eternal life".

08:38.125 --> 08:39.875
I remember...

08:46.375 --> 08:52.083
My father and I
used to grow coffee on our land.

08:58.875 --> 09:03.458
This coffee brought memories of him.

09:05.208 --> 09:10.292
The scent of coffee has changed.

09:12.542 --> 09:16.833
It doesn't taste the same.

09:19.833 --> 09:22.250
Our coffee was beautiful,

09:22.292 --> 09:26.042
but it needs a lot of rain.

09:29.708 --> 09:34.000
We replaced it with khat.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.917
- You're back?
- Yeah, I'm here.

13:38.042 --> 13:40.250
- There's some more over there.
- OK.

13:40.292 --> 13:42.292
Go and get those.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.583
- This is it, right?
- Yes.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.292
I could have been there by now.

13:59.042 --> 14:01.083
Where?

14:01.958 --> 14:03.750
I could have been in Egypt by now.

14:04.542 --> 14:07.458
- In Metema.
- Where is Metema?

14:08.708 --> 14:10.583
The border of Ethiopia.

14:32.125 --> 14:35.583
Do they take you to Egypt
straight from the border

14:35.625 --> 14:37.583
or do you go by yourself?

14:38.875 --> 14:41.250
They take you across the border.

14:41.292 --> 14:44.708
Then you take the boat to Egypt.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.250
How much money do you need?

14:54.708 --> 14:56.042
From here to Egypt

14:56.458 --> 15:01.958
expenses alone,
you need at least $30,000 birr.

15:03.708 --> 15:06.167
From Egypt all the way to Europe on a boat

15:06.208 --> 15:10.625
you need another $50,000 birr.

15:12.125 --> 15:15.625
There is a mountain trek,
and then it takes

15:16.583 --> 15:19.000
15 to 19 days on the boat.

15:19.792 --> 15:23.167
What do you eat?
Do they feed you?

15:24.625 --> 15:26.750
No, no one feeds you.

15:27.333 --> 15:30.625
You have to bring your own food?
But you are travelling...

15:30.667 --> 15:33.750
You have to buy dry foods like beso.

15:34.375 --> 15:39.417
If you get hungry on the road,
no one will feed you.

15:40.917 --> 15:44.458
You will fast the night.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.292
Why did you come back?

16:04.333 --> 16:06.833
I came back for my mother.

16:07.125 --> 16:09.750
I would have left

16:10.042 --> 16:13.875
but I came back because of her.

16:31.042 --> 16:34.625
My mom left when I was little.

16:36.875 --> 16:41.208
She crossed the sea.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.583
She never came back.

17:23.958 --> 17:27.167
You know the kid was a brilliant student.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.250
Brilliant!

17:28.292 --> 17:32.292
Woyone unfairly gave him incomplete marks
despite his good grades.

17:33.458 --> 17:38.083
He slipped through our fingers
to Sudan.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.958
- That kid is lucky.
- What luck?

17:42.042 --> 17:44.333
To be a migrant in a foreign land,
is that luck?

18:02.167 --> 18:05.792
Fertile land, country of honey dew.

18:05.958 --> 18:08.750
There is nothing like our own country.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.792
Yet every regime has kept us
from working our own fertile land.

18:14.125 --> 18:17.625
Instead of spending $50,000
to go to Europe...

18:17.667 --> 18:19.792
I swear you can't make a difference
in a short time.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.333
Listen here,
if you opened a business here,

18:22.375 --> 18:24.125
I swear, you could!

18:27.167 --> 18:30.458
Better than becoming food
for the crocodiles.

18:31.375 --> 18:35.583
We shouldn't have to perish in the deserts
and the seas to change our lives.

18:42.375 --> 18:45.417
There is nothing like your own country,
it's true.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.625
The love you get from your mother can
you get that same love from a stepmother?

18:50.667 --> 18:52.208
No.

18:52.250 --> 18:55.042
It's the same with a country
that is not your own.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.042
To leave your country is

19:01.042 --> 19:03.208
a very, very serious thing.

20:23.875 --> 20:25.292
There she is...

20:25.833 --> 20:28.708
the bride.

20:40.458 --> 20:41.833
Will you take me with you?

20:44.458 --> 20:46.542
You are still a kid.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.542
What will you do there?

21:02.292 --> 21:05.583
When you left, did you miss home?

21:13.792 --> 21:15.292
You leave everything behind...

21:17.333 --> 21:18.917
then you start remembering

21:19.708 --> 21:20.958
the sound of birds

21:22.917 --> 21:24.583
nature, the feel of clean air.

21:36.333 --> 21:42.875
Memories, that is all you travel with.

22:28.542 --> 22:34.333
May the lord deliver
our children from suffering.

23:03.167 --> 23:04.917
May the creator make our dreams come true!

23:05.042 --> 23:06.875
May the creator make our dreams come true!

23:07.083 --> 23:08.833
May the creator make our dreams come true!

23:09.208 --> 23:10.958
May the creator make our dreams come true!

23:11.208 --> 23:12.958
May the creator make our dreams come true!

23:13.042 --> 23:14.792
May the creator make our dreams come true!

23:14.875 --> 23:16.833
God fulfill our dreams!

24:11.458 --> 24:16.792
From the first day I saw you

24:16.833 --> 24:20.583
you stole my heart.

24:22.708 --> 24:25.792
My love, let's agree,

24:26.708 --> 24:29.333
bring my heart back to me.

24:31.875 --> 24:34.417
All of this sky and earth

24:34.458 --> 24:38.417
all to myself suffocates me.

24:40.167 --> 24:42.250
All I eat and all I drink

24:42.292 --> 24:44.083
is bitter as bile.

24:50.792 --> 24:54.417
Your beauty, like the angel of love

24:54.458 --> 24:57.417
appears right in front of me.

24:58.583 --> 25:01.417
Wrecks my heart every time.

25:03.042 --> 25:05.833
Denies me the remedy.

25:31.167 --> 25:33.000
I had never opened my heart

25:33.042 --> 25:37.083
for anyone but you.

25:37.125 --> 25:40.083
You knew all about my dreams.

25:41.792 --> 25:45.417
You knew all about my dreams.

25:46.333 --> 25:49.125
From the very first day I saw you.

26:16.125 --> 26:18.792
Everyone chews to get away.

26:21.833 --> 26:25.875
Their flesh is here
but their soul is gone.

26:33.708 --> 26:34.792
Household, how are you?

26:34.833 --> 26:38.083
How have you been Mohammed?
Come in. How are you?

26:38.375 --> 26:41.125
Thanks to God, I'm good.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.667
What can I get for you?

26:42.708 --> 26:45.708
Highland water, charcoal, shisha.

26:48.458 --> 26:50.708
Allah, this is not enough money
for everything.

26:50.750 --> 26:54.000
- Oh come on, it's enough.
- No, it's not enough, charcoal is 15 bir.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.708
Shisha is 30, the water is 12.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.958
- Don't you know?
- Come on, it's enough!

27:03.958 --> 27:08.458
It's not like that.
Can you choose charcoal or shisha?

27:08.750 --> 27:10.917
You'll find it cheaper at the big market.

27:10.958 --> 27:13.583
Go to the bigger market.
The money is enough.

27:13.792 --> 27:16.833
- Come on, go my dear.
- Okay.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.333
Household.

27:38.292 --> 27:39.750
Peace be upon you.

27:40.042 --> 27:41.958
And peace be upon you too.

27:42.917 --> 27:44.250
Thank you.

27:44.958 --> 27:46.417
Bless you.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.083
Amen.

27:50.208 --> 27:51.667
- Bottle of water.
- A liter?

27:51.708 --> 27:53.583
Yes.
And cigarettes.

28:47.958 --> 28:50.458
- Household.
- Visitors, come in.

28:56.625 --> 29:00.417
- Where did you go?
- The closer store was closed.

29:05.792 --> 29:07.792
Ok, thank you!

29:40.708 --> 29:43.250
Dear lord, mercy
and heaven for Azurkherlaini.

29:43.542 --> 29:45.333
Nabi Khedir, fulfill our desires.

30:25.875 --> 30:27.875
Household.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.458
This is not khat from Khalifa!

32:20.125 --> 32:23.083
Where is Husena? There it is!

32:23.375 --> 32:24.875
This is not it!

32:25.625 --> 32:27.042
This is not it!

32:29.750 --> 32:31.583
Please, this is not it!

36:03.583 --> 36:05.583
Jamila.

36:07.208 --> 36:10.583
How do you feel now that he's back?

36:10.625 --> 36:15.000
You know how I feel about him,

36:16.042 --> 36:20.167
but when people live apart for a while

36:20.208 --> 36:22.208
you never know what they're thinking.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.042
I really missed you.

36:33.083 --> 36:36.083
That's the way it is my son,
thank God we are together again.

36:55.250 --> 36:59.750
Does anyone know me better than you?

37:42.333 --> 37:43.458
Mom?

37:44.458 --> 37:49.083
How is Jamila?
Did she get married like the rest?

37:51.917 --> 37:54.875
You know we've loved each other
since we were kids.

37:54.917 --> 37:55.958
Right.

38:03.667 --> 38:06.000
I know, that's why she is waiting for you.

38:35.333 --> 38:38.708
Trust me dear mom,
I'll make you proud one day.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.250
I've done it before, haven't I?

38:41.542 --> 38:43.958
I'll make you proud.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.167
Let me go see my father now.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.958
Good, your brother is there too.

38:59.417 --> 39:03.208
Our only wealth is our farm,
they are working the land.

39:08.583 --> 39:12.583
I am so happy you came my son,
thank God I lived to see you again.

39:26.583 --> 39:30.958
Thank God I lived to see you too.

39:39.042 --> 39:41.750
To see you grow and grow

39:42.250 --> 39:45.667
I just want to see you married
with children of your own someday.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.583
Fatuma?

42:13.542 --> 42:15.583
Fatuma, wake up.

42:34.667 --> 42:37.333
Come back to yourself.

43:11.458 --> 43:13.333
My child, my love.

43:14.833 --> 43:16.708
We all went through this.

43:18.042 --> 43:19.667
But, sadness passes.

43:20.292 --> 43:21.875
Nothing stays the same.

43:34.708 --> 43:38.292
My mother had warned me.

43:44.375 --> 43:47.583
"Let him divorce his wife first".

43:47.625 --> 43:51.125
"Let him divorce his merkhana first".

44:02.250 --> 44:06.625
Made you forget your kid, your home.

44:09.417 --> 44:11.208
Merkhana.

44:13.958 --> 44:17.333
They call her Merkhana.

44:22.958 --> 44:24.958
The ghost who abandons your warm bed

44:25.000 --> 44:27.167
every morning when you wake.

44:45.792 --> 44:53.958
The scent of incense remains
even when the smoke disappears.

45:01.375 --> 45:07.333
I am losing your scent.

45:19.042 --> 45:21.292
I can't remember your touch.

45:21.917 --> 45:25.208
It's been so long...

45:25.250 --> 45:32.292
only fabric caresses my body.

45:57.125 --> 45:59.292
Do you know loneliness?

46:33.792 --> 46:36.750
I am forgotten.

46:41.917 --> 46:44.917
Do you know what I want?

46:49.333 --> 46:51.583
To leave this darkness.

46:57.625 --> 47:00.125
I want to run to a place

47:00.958 --> 47:03.375
where I can't hear these thoughts.

47:19.167 --> 47:21.375
A quiet place where I can forget.

49:44.542 --> 49:47.583
We loved your father like a brother.

49:48.458 --> 49:51.167
We lost him too soon.

49:53.333 --> 49:59.208
At your age this should not be your job.

49:59.792 --> 50:06.542
We would not wish this job upon you.

50:07.625 --> 50:12.708
But you are here because of a tragedy.

50:12.750 --> 50:16.542
You are here to help your family.

51:10.208 --> 51:12.125
- Are you going to school?
- Yes.

51:12.208 --> 51:15.583
May God help you, you are young.

51:15.625 --> 51:21.375
You can do this job
and also continue your studies.

51:29.458 --> 51:32.042
- Do you chew khat?
- No.

51:32.125 --> 51:33.500
Great, don't chew.

51:33.542 --> 51:37.083
You are still a boy,
you have a lot of growing to do.

51:37.167 --> 51:41.208
Don't stop your studies,
and don't start a chewing habit.

51:48.458 --> 51:49.958
Be courageous.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.458
You have a future ahead of you.

55:19.208 --> 55:21.167
Hello, Mom.

55:22.125 --> 55:23.250
How are you?

55:23.958 --> 55:25.542
Is everything okay?

55:26.167 --> 55:27.167
I'm fine I swear.

55:30.958 --> 55:35.958
Yes, I'm eating right
now in the cafeteria.

59:00.208 --> 59:06.750
That night,
God spoke to Azurkherlaini in a dream.

59:09.292 --> 59:13.792
"You have to find
the water of eternal life".

59:16.958 --> 59:19.417
The wise amirs Khedir and Elias

59:19.458 --> 59:23.083
agreed to join Azurkherlaini
on his search for Maoul Hayat.

59:26.333 --> 59:29.625
Khedir silently prayed,

59:29.667 --> 59:34.000
"God, please allow me
to find Maoul Hayat,"

59:34.042 --> 59:36.292
"for all the people in the world".

59:44.958 --> 59:50.792
Elias prayed to find Maoul Hayat
for all the people in the world,

59:50.833 --> 59:53.417
and for himself as well.

59:59.542 --> 01:00:03.375
Azurkherlaini was so blinded by fear,

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:09.000
he prayed to find Maoul Hayat
just for himself.

01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:32.167
Mohammed!

01:01:42.542 --> 01:01:45.167
Come on, hurry up!

01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:48.083
I am talking to you.

01:01:54.417 --> 01:01:56.542
You piss me off, just like your mother!

01:01:57.583 --> 01:02:00.083
Huh!
Where is my setup?

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:02.333
- I just got here.
- Where is it? Where were you?

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:04.375
Allah, Allah, please!

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:05.917
Where is my setup?

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:09.583
- Allah Father, I'll do it now.
- So where is it?

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:11.958
Why are you doing this to me?
Come here!

01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:14.542
You are driving me crazy!

01:02:14.833 --> 01:02:16.875
My Harara is boiling up my head!

01:02:17.958 --> 01:02:19.667
Wait, you'll be back!

01:02:20.917 --> 01:02:22.958
Unbelievable,
you make me burn up inside!

01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:27.833
I'm the one
who spoiled you and your mother!

01:02:46.417 --> 01:02:50.333
Mom, when harara time comes,

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:54.167
dad becomes a crazy man.

01:03:02.167 --> 01:03:05.458
He is losing it with khat.

01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:15.917
In the morning,
before he chews he is a different person.

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:18.958
In the afternoon,
at his harara hour he is another.

01:03:19.625 --> 01:03:22.958
At night,
after chewing he is another person.

01:03:23.292 --> 01:03:25.583
You know him.

01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:41.667
I never know which person to expect.

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:30.667
I don't know what to do about my Dad.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.917
Mom, why can't I be with you?

01:04:42.542 --> 01:04:45.208
What's wrong if I come to you?

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:53.750
She put up with him for two years.

01:08:04.583 --> 01:08:07.375
- What does one become?
- Two years.

01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:11.542
Not easy.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.208
When you keep things inside too long,
you start dreading it.

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:29.792
It makes you want
to throw everything in to the fire.

01:11:17.167 --> 01:11:20.250
Harramaya was a very big lake.

01:11:20.583 --> 01:11:22.958
But, it dried.

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:26.667
But, like Sheikh Elias said

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:29.625
we sinned too much

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:32.708
so Allah dried it up.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:12.000
You never loved anyone after him?

01:13:12.042 --> 01:13:14.875
No one, it's true.

01:13:16.292 --> 01:13:18.917
Everyone else is invisible.

01:13:41.958 --> 01:13:44.625
I remember when we were in the struggle

01:13:46.167 --> 01:13:52.625
my friend Tadesse Dendena
was shot by a bullet

01:13:53.583 --> 01:13:56.292
but we couldn't even take
him to the hospital.

01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:05.417
So many were injured by tear gas.

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:07.542
It is on our own land that we are dying,

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:11.167
being imprisoned and forced into exile.

01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:16.708
All of this because we are Oromo.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.625
Nothing else.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.583
Our struggle is not new.

01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:30.833
Our grandparents and great grandparents
went through it.

01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:45.583
Having to leave school, being imprisoned,

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:48.208
beaten, tortured.

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:53.125
This is the price we've
had to pay for our people.

01:15:56.792 --> 01:16:02.208
The sacrifice we made was worth it.

01:16:04.042 --> 01:16:08.167
And I am happy, I am not bitter.

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:16.750
It is hard for me to open up
and say what I feel inside.

01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:26.958
That's all,
I am very happy we made it to this day.

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:37.958
This token freedom is not enough for us.

01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:42.250
Our struggle will continue.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.750
The creator fulfils.

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:09.958
May Badru help us.

01:18:10.542 --> 01:18:13.750
The times are cruel.

01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:22.667
May the creator help me too.

01:18:22.792 --> 01:18:25.417
- May the creator help you.
- Lord, stay by my side.

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:28.833
May he help us.

01:18:29.583 --> 01:18:30.875
The children...

01:18:30.917 --> 01:18:33.417
may the creator shield the children
from suffering.

01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:50.250
Chew! Chew! Chew!
It's alright!

01:18:50.458 --> 01:18:52.917
It's alright!

01:18:55.583 --> 01:18:58.167
You still have more blessings to do
for the world.

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:31.208
They say everyone inherits their kin.

01:19:32.292 --> 01:19:35.792
Fathers to sons, mothers to daughters.

01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:48.958
I'm afraid of becoming like my father.

01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:53.958
People say I have his nose
and his personality.

01:20:59.083 --> 01:21:01.125
45, 46...

01:21:01.708 --> 01:21:05.958
47, 48, 49, 50...

01:21:06.625 --> 01:21:11.458
1, 2, 3, 4...

01:21:12.042 --> 01:21:16.125
5, 6, 7, 8...

01:21:16.417 --> 01:21:21.542
9, 10, 11, 12...

01:21:21.708 --> 01:21:25.917
13, 14, 15, 16...

01:21:26.083 --> 01:21:29.750
17, 18, 19, 20

01:21:30.083 --> 01:21:35.375
21, 22, 23, 24...

01:21:35.958 --> 01:21:40.167
25, 26, 27, 28...

01:21:40.792 --> 01:21:44.917
29, 30, 31, 32....

01:21:45.417 --> 01:21:49.333
33, 34, 35, 36...

01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:56.667
37, 38, 39, 40.

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:18.375
838 Biftu

01:22:18.792 --> 01:22:21.125
838 Biftu

01:22:30.458 --> 01:22:34.750
21, 22, 23, 24...

01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:41.917
26, 28, 30, 31...

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:46.958
32, 33, 34, 36...

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:53.292
40...

01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:56.833
42, 43, 44...

01:22:56.875 --> 01:22:58.833
46...

01:22:58.875 --> 01:23:00.958
47, 48...

01:24:45.208 --> 01:24:49.167
I wish they would let us see their eyes.

01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:54.875
So many locked up

01:24:59.958 --> 01:25:01.292
they did nothing wrong

01:25:01.333 --> 01:25:03.292
they are just fighting for their rights.

01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:11.292
I'm just worried about my mom,
day and night she cries.

01:25:12.958 --> 01:25:15.792
Don't let it get you down.

01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:19.625
Be strong, she needs you.

01:25:19.958 --> 01:25:21.750
Everything is in God's hands.

01:26:10.042 --> 01:26:11.625
Urji?

01:26:18.708 --> 01:26:19.833
Urji

01:26:21.458 --> 01:26:23.417
Are you sleeping?

01:26:25.875 --> 01:26:27.208
You sleeping?

01:26:30.333 --> 01:26:31.583
Nure.

01:26:33.625 --> 01:26:34.917
How are you?

01:26:34.958 --> 01:26:36.250
Come in.

01:26:42.167 --> 01:26:43.417
This looks good.

01:26:44.417 --> 01:26:45.708
It looks ready.

01:26:47.208 --> 01:26:48.458
Yeah, it's ready.

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:16.125
From the very first day I saw you...

01:31:43.375 --> 01:31:45.417
Everything ends.

01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:49.167
Yes.

01:33:52.833 --> 01:33:54.708
Mom?

01:35:39.792 --> 01:35:41.167
The softest!

01:35:41.667 --> 01:35:42.833
Look at these!

01:35:51.083 --> 01:35:52.750
What did you say?

01:35:53.292 --> 01:35:54.667
Bring it here.

01:35:54.917 --> 01:35:56.875
How much is a kilo?

01:35:58.542 --> 01:36:00.208
Saida, talk to me.

01:36:34.917 --> 01:36:36.708
Mustafa.

01:37:07.125 --> 01:37:10.625
Good, I found you in health.

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:13.833
Take my voice and broadcast
it to the world

01:37:13.875 --> 01:37:16.333
for the political prisoners.

01:37:16.375 --> 01:37:19.042
The children are
in a big crisis in Aweday.

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:22.083
43 people are in serious peril.

01:37:22.833 --> 01:37:26.000
Jawar has the truth. He should be able
to eat for the rest of his life.

01:37:26.042 --> 01:37:29.292
His conscience is at peace.
He uplifts the poor.

01:37:29.542 --> 01:37:31.583
Guided by truth and the creator

01:37:31.625 --> 01:37:36.042
he broke the blade of the axe
and ignited the fire within us.

01:37:36.208 --> 01:37:40.833
He lights the fire with his blood
He lifts big mountains up to the sky.

01:37:40.875 --> 01:37:42.750
He was chosen to lead,
the creator knows that.

01:37:42.792 --> 01:37:45.625
He doesn't stray from the truth
with a hammer in hand...

01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:48.250
May the creator keep the evil eye
away from him.

01:37:48.292 --> 01:37:50.292
Freedom is an art,
let's find the harmony.

01:37:50.458 --> 01:37:53.042
Harmony is the work of God.

01:38:48.583 --> 01:38:51.583
When dad has no money to chew,

01:38:52.917 --> 01:38:55.458
Dukak comes for him in his sleep at night.

01:38:57.667 --> 01:39:00.917
The Dukak puts him inside a bottle

01:39:00.958 --> 01:39:04.333
and drops him on a highway.

01:39:05.958 --> 01:39:10.750
"Please get me out of here," he screams

01:39:11.667 --> 01:39:14.917
but there is no one there to hear him.

01:39:17.125 --> 01:39:21.542
He chases and chases him.

01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:26.042
He runs and runs and runs

01:39:32.917 --> 01:39:35.667
but he can't get away.

01:39:41.292 --> 01:39:43.250
We begged and took him to Sheikh Hashim.

01:39:44.208 --> 01:39:45.792
They did a blessing.

01:39:46.333 --> 01:39:49.125
Cut bread.
Cut the rope.

01:39:50.708 --> 01:39:52.542
But he is not healing.

01:39:53.958 --> 01:39:55.833
You know how he is.

01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:26.250
I found the number for the boat man,
I called him.

01:40:27.083 --> 01:40:29.000
Tomorrow, he said.

01:40:29.792 --> 01:40:32.208
We are leaving tomorrow morning at 4 AM.

01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:35.708
- He said not to bring anything.
- What, we're leaving tomorrow?

01:40:35.875 --> 01:40:39.875
- But what do we need to bring?
- He said not to bring anything.

01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:45.042
Just to wear a warm jacket,
closed shoes for the cold and water.

01:40:46.083 --> 01:40:47.917
But we don't even know him!

01:40:47.958 --> 01:40:52.333
He is a sheikh,
he is a God fearing poor man.

01:40:52.375 --> 01:40:54.708
How do we know that?

01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:57.833
What can he do to us?
He is a Muslim, he is a Sheikh!

01:40:57.875 --> 01:41:00.708
- He himself would be coming with us.
- Exactly!

01:41:00.792 --> 01:41:04.167
- But we don't even know who he is.
- What do you mean?

01:41:05.917 --> 01:41:07.167
Who is calling?

01:41:08.958 --> 01:41:10.542
- It's my mom.
- Don't pick up.

01:41:10.625 --> 01:41:13.375
Don't pick up,
you're gonna get us caught.

01:41:14.167 --> 01:41:17.417
We've been planning to go away
for months and now you're not going?

01:41:17.583 --> 01:41:20.458
- Hang up!
- Man, I'd rather miss out.

01:41:20.625 --> 01:41:23.333
- Why can you miss out on this?
- I'm not going.

01:41:23.458 --> 01:41:25.583
Come on, we talked about this,
let's go.

01:41:27.958 --> 01:41:29.542
Let him go man!

01:41:30.417 --> 01:41:32.667
What, are you staying here
to go to school?

01:41:32.875 --> 01:41:35.917
How far do graduates go?
They're all chewing khat all day.

01:41:35.958 --> 01:41:37.833
Don't miss out, think about it.

01:42:26.167 --> 01:42:27.583
Peace be upon you.

01:42:27.625 --> 01:42:30.708
And peace be upon you too.

01:42:35.333 --> 01:42:37.500
- God bless you.
- Amen.

01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:40.083
Come in, welcome.

01:42:47.583 --> 01:42:49.000
Thank you.

01:43:29.042 --> 01:43:31.417
You are not leaving today?

01:43:33.542 --> 01:43:35.125
Are you ok?

01:43:37.167 --> 01:43:38.875
What's wrong?

01:43:39.583 --> 01:43:43.792
Don't be afraid, speak up.

01:43:54.042 --> 01:43:56.500
I am tired of everything.

01:43:56.542 --> 01:43:59.833
Tell me about your world, where you go.

01:43:59.875 --> 01:44:02.167
Don't fantasize about it.

01:44:11.542 --> 01:44:15.125
I heard someone say
that when people are high

01:44:15.292 --> 01:44:17.958
they start watching films in their mind.

01:44:26.292 --> 01:44:28.667
Once you go in,
you won't find your way out.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:05.375
The world we carved for ourselves
is an empty and lonely hideout

01:46:06.625 --> 01:46:09.667
where no one can ever visit you

01:46:09.708 --> 01:46:13.167
our own dark and lonely world.

01:46:51.667 --> 01:46:54.000
Wherever I turn, all I see is darkness.

01:46:54.042 --> 01:46:58.250
To my left, to my right,
behind me, in front of me.

01:47:07.917 --> 01:47:11.958
Do you want to live in darkness?

01:48:07.583 --> 01:48:11.208
After a long journey
in search of the water of eternal life,

01:48:12.458 --> 01:48:18.042
Khedir was the first
one to find Maoul Hayat.

01:48:23.083 --> 01:48:29.375
He drank the water of eternal life
and became daylight.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.833
When Elias arrived at Maoul Hayat,
he found only muddy water.

01:48:51.708 --> 01:48:57.458
He drank the muddy water...

01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:04.875
Elias became the darkness of night.

01:49:10.333 --> 01:49:15.292
When Azurkherlaini arrived,
the water had dried.

01:49:17.208 --> 01:49:21.708
He was so afraid, he began to pray.

01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:29.083
"I have no wife, no children".

01:49:29.125 --> 01:49:34.250
"Who will remember me when I die?"

01:49:35.417 --> 01:49:41.125
God heard his prayers
and grew khat for him.

01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:47.583
"From now on," God said,
"whoever eats khat"

01:49:47.625 --> 01:49:53.208
"will always remember you".

01:50:48.417 --> 01:50:52.042
We ate together and drank together.

01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:02.542
You knew about love.

01:51:34.708 --> 01:51:37.458
Oh, never mind...

01:52:16.875 --> 01:52:21.583
All those moments we shared.

01:52:26.958 --> 01:52:29.792
My belly can't take it.

01:52:35.292 --> 01:52:43.875
Better to keep the murmurs
of the heart to oneself.
