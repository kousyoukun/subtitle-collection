1
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:48,381
{\2c&H0388CF&}SANJURO

2
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,572
So Mutsuta refused?

3
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,830
Count my uncle out.

4
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,916
I gave him our proposal
to purge the clan of corruption.

5
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,213
He just glanced at it and said,
"I'm aware of the situation."

6
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,882
- Then why does he do nothing?
- I asked him that.

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,844
"Why overlook the corruption
of your vice-chamberlain

8
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,180
and provincial steward
in the daimyo's absence?"

9
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,808
He smiled and said,

10
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,562
"Perhaps I'm behind it.

11
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,359
You all think I'm a good-natured halfwit,
a scarecrow who'll do your bidding.

12
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,821
People aren't what they seem.
Be careful.

13
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,367
You'd never suspect
who the worst are. Be careful."

14
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,911
Then he tore -
- He tore it up?

15
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,206
He really went too far.

16
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:28,833
And then?

17
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,877
I gave up on him.

18
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,213
I met with Superintendent Kikui,
as we planned.

19
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,923
What did he say?

20
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,551
He understood our position,
just as expected.

21
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,722
At first he seemed troubled and said
he'd discuss it with my uncle,

22
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,516
but when I told him my uncle's words,
he was shocked.

23
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,604
He thought about it and said,
"All right. I'm with you.

24
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:57,028
I'd like to talk with your group.
Gather all your men quickly."

25
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,070
There you have it.

26
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,950
- Kikui's the real thing!
- We can reason with him.

27
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,538
He's extremely influential.
He's no good-natured scarecrow.

28
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,090
Wait just a minute.

29
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,946
- That's quite a story.
- You heard us? Stop him!

30
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,867
Imbecile.

31
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,120
Do I look
like I'm going anywhere?

32
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,586
What the hell
are you doing here?

33
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,757
It's a free room for the night.

34
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:05,846
By the way,
you should be glad I overheard you.

35
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,310
"The spectator sees more than the player."
He can judge the right course of action.

36
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,437
Listen.

37
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,857
If you ask me,

38
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,485
the chamberlain is the real thing,

39
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,697
and the superintendent
is a phony.

40
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,491
What? Such insolence
won't go unpunished!

41
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,326
Don't get all testy.

42
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,038
I haven't seen
either of their faces,

43
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:36,168
so I can't be fooled
by their looks.

44
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,173
The chamberlain
is ugly, isn't he?

45
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,347
I guess I must be right.

46
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:54,395
But judging from your story,
he must be a great man

47
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,150
who doesn't care
if you think he's a fool.

48
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,822
But this Superintendent Kikui -

49
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:09,744
You say he's the real thing,
"just as expected."

50
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,374
That must mean
he looks the part.

51
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,051
Am I right?

52
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,179
But people aren't
what they seem.

53
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,848
Be careful.

54
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,434
Enough! What does
a worthless ronin know?

55
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,063
I'm just repeating
what the chamberlain said.

56
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,733
Don't you get it?
His words were even more precise:

57
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,571
"You'd never suspect
who the worst are. Be careful."

58
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,952
I may be wrong, but it sounds like
Kikui is the rotten one.

59
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,746
Fool!

60
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,248
Quiet down and listen.

61
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,918
What's the superintendent's job?

62
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,421
To quiet discord
in the ranks, right?

63
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:06,592
Instead,
he's inciting you to revolt.

64
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,970
Don't you find that odd?

65
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:21,190
What's more,
he told you to gather quickly.

66
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,442
That's a bad sign.

67
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,905
If he's the mastermind,
he can kill you all in one fell swoop.

68
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,118
Don't do as he says.
Just watch and wait.

69
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,920
But we're meeting him
here tonight.

70
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,214
What?

71
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,948
I was right.
Take a look.

72
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,249
We're completely surrounded.

73
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,878
Not even an ant could escape.

74
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,689
The foolishness
never ends, does it?

75
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,859
Put your swords away.
This is no time to play war.

76
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,070
Shut up!
We're not listening to you!

77
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,821
Suit yourselves.

78
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:36,408
I'm sure Kikui will be delighted
to see you all dead.

79
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,794
But... we're surrounded.

80
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,131
Just leave it to me.

81
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,110
Superintendent Kikui sent us.
Surrender!

82
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,449
You're surrounded!

83
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,868
Do not resist!

84
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,048
What a racket!
What do you want?

85
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,980
What do you think you're doing?

86
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,113
Take your shoes off
before you go in my room!

87
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,456
Who is this guy?

88
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,334
So... you wanna fight?

89
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:13,088
Watch out. You woke me up,
and I'm in a bad mood.

90
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,160
Pull back!

91
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,207
It's not him we're looking for.

92
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,132
Besides, disposing of this one
would take too long.

93
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,888
You're quite able.

94
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:10,104
If you wish to serve our clan, come
see me at the superintendent's estate.

95
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,981
My name is Hanbei Muroto.

96
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,928
It's safe now. Come out.

97
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,240
We don't know
how to thank you.

98
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,578
No thanks needed,
but some money would be nice.

99
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,791
I've been starving for days.
A cup of sake and some food's enough.

100
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,480
This'll do.

101
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,863
See ya around.

102
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:01,006
But what will you do now?

103
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,176
You've opened our eyes.

104
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:08,222
We'll rush to apologize to my uncle
and follow his instructions.

105
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,644
Very reasonable.
Good boys.

106
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,109
Wait. That won't do.

107
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,613
The chamberlain's
in danger now.

108
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,823
- The chamberlain?
- That's right.

109
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,202
If I were Kikui, I'd arrest him,

110
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,081
since he seems to know
that Kikui is behind the corruption.

111
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,926
- Where are you going?
- To my uncle's.

112
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,136
So they can catch you?

113
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,223
They know you.
Show your face and you're finished.

114
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,059
But it's my fault.
If I hadn't been so stupid -

115
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,980
We're all responsible.
You were just following our plan.

116
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,399
But if anything happens
to my uncle -

117
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,568
Idiot! Stop saying "my uncle"!

118
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:06,029
You can't just act
on your own whims.

119
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,864
That's right.

120
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,909
The nine of us
are in this together.

121
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,456
The ten of us!

122
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,668
I can't watch you
blunder your way to your deaths.

123
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,155
It's quiet.
Everything seems all right.

124
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,618
No, something's wrong.
The shutters are usually closed now.

125
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,371
Are there fish in this pond?

126
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,250
A lot of big carp.

127
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,608
Must have been a fish.

128
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,670
Just as you suspected.
Those three are Kikui's men.

129
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,757
That's my uncle's room.
He must be in trouble.

130
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,678
Don't be hasty.
Let's wait and see.

131
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,529
We can't move like this,
like a centipede.

132
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,699
Is there somewhere
we can hide?

133
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,034
There's a barn just ahead.

134
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,286
Good. Let's go.

135
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,391
Koiso! What's wrong?

136
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,560
Master Izaka!

137
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,486
Fool! This is no time for tears.

138
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,239
My lord is in terrible trouble!

139
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,075
Calm down.
Tell us what happened.

140
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,747
The superintendent suddenly
arrived with a host of men.

141
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,417
We were eating -
- Never mind that. Where's my uncle?

142
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,586
Ten men took him away.

143
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,672
Where the hell were the guards?

144
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,093
They were taken by surprise
and locked up in the main house.

145
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,678
And my aunt?

146
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,890
I don't know.
Probably under watch somewhere.

147
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,224
And Chidori?

148
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,103
I think she's with her mother.

149
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:29,357
- How many men are on watch?
- Fourteen or 15.

150
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,568
Then how did you escape?

151
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,987
The sentries asked me
to get some sake,

152
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,406
so I pretended to go
to the kitchen.

153
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,743
- Unaccompanied?
- A man followed me the first time.

154
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,746
This time they let me go alone.

155
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,165
Send her right back.

156
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,293
- Send her back?
- Yes, to Kikui's men.

157
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,255
Too bad,
since she managed to get away,

158
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,300
but they'll raise the alarm
if she disappears.

159
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,888
Best to get them
drunk on sake.

160
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,351
Then we can rescue
the chamberlain's old lady and the girl.

161
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,145
I see.

162
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,190
Koiso, will you go back?

163
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,113
Yes, I will.

164
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,997
Now there's a samurai.

165
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,335
More reliable than all of you.

166
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,855
We're grateful,
but please watch your language.

167
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,440
Calling the chamberlain's wife
his "old lady"...

168
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:57,028
And it's annoying to have you
decide our every move.

169
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,739
You want to rescue
the ladies first,

170
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,868
but the chamberlain's safety
is more pressing.

171
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:07,205
Very well.
Where is he then?

172
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,709
We can't rescue him
without knowing where he is.

173
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,963
What's the superintendent
planning to do with him?

174
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,633
We can't do anything
without knowing that.

175
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:25,307
Kikui must've told the old lady
why he hauled her husband off.

176
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,394
Don't you wanna ask her
what she knows?

177
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,193
Understand now?

178
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,487
Good. Now split up.

179
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:44,409
You three and I
will rescue the old lady.

180
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,662
The rest of you,
look for the chamberlain.

181
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:53,793
We'll meet in a safe place.
Is there anything around here?

182
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,256
We can't go far at night
with the ladies in tow.

183
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,258
My house is closest.

184
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,511
Are you crazy?
You're next door to Kurofuji.

185
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:08,767
- Who's Kurofuji?
- One of the traitors. A vice-chamberlain.

186
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,478
Sounds like fun.
Let's meet there.

187
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,438
That's ridiculous!

188
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:17,567
Were you born in the Year of the Ox?
You always fly off the handle.

189
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,865
Nobody thinks to look
right under his own nose.

190
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,244
There are three guards.

191
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:15,667
I'll knock one down,
and you two take him prisoner.

192
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,752
Don't kill him.

193
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,339
He may tell us
where the chamberlain is.

194
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:28,138
While I do away
with the other two,

195
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,307
you rush in
and rescue the women folk.

196
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:36,438
We'll meet back at the barn.
Got it?

197
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,908
Why are you looking
at me like that?

198
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,662
You want to draw your swords?
Forget it.

199
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,623
A stupid friend's sword
is deadlier than an enemy's.

200
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,334
I don't want to get cut to pieces.

201
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:10,680
That's the guardhouse.
Your plan seems to have worked.

202
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,061
Now's our chance.

203
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,219
That was close.

204
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,304
They've changed the guard.

205
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,224
Muroto.
You just met him at the shrine.

206
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,270
He offered me a job.

207
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,023
What's he do for Kikui?
- Henchman and enforcer.

208
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,443
Let's go now. He's alone.

209
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,362
Are you blind?

210
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,573
Those three guards
are kitty cats.

211
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,619
He may be alone,
but he's a tiger.

212
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,432
What the hell's that racket?

213
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,353
The guards are drunk, sir.

214
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,778
Your faces are red.

215
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,992
Wash them in the pond.

216
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,757
Do it!

217
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,849
I'm going to the main house.
Stand guard.

218
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:52,634
Kikui said he arrested Uncle to stop him
from destroying evidence of corruption.

219
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,552
Is that right?

220
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,098
He thought of everything,
didn't he?

221
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,898
Who is that gentleman?

222
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:12,320
It's hard to explain. A strange series
of events has made him our ally.

223
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:16,616
Indeed, he saved our lives.
- Is that so?

224
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,077
Thank you.

225
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,473
What's keeping those two?
It's dangerous staying here.

226
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,687
Yes, but I've never run so
in my entire life.

227
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:49,440
I must rest a bit
or I shan't even be able to walk.

228
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,949
This is my first time here.

229
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,744
The hay smells lovely.

230
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,248
I love this smell.

231
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:10,253
We come here often,
don't we, Iori?

232
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,927
I'll find those two.

233
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,183
Why do you two come here?

234
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,853
It's so quiet,
even in the daytime.

235
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:32,400
You can lean back in the hay
and feel like you're floating.

236
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:38,156
Enveloped in its scent,
you drift into a dreamy haze.

237
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,700
You know,

238
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:47,248
I even fell asleep once
on Iori's arm.

239
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,420
Not very ladylike.

240
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,965
But...

241
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,926
actually...

242
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,350
it does smell nice.

243
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,612
No wonder they were late.

244
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,532
They were dunking his head in the pond
to make him spit out my uncle's location.

245
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,702
Stubborn bastard wouldn't talk.

246
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,581
- Only spat out water, eh?
- He may not know anything.

247
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,708
Why should I talk?

248
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,044
Son of a bitch!

249
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,629
What do we do?

250
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,382
He saw our faces.
We have to kill him.

251
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,759
That just won't do.

252
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,597
And you killed
the other two as well, didn't you?

253
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,728
I did it to rescue you.
I had no choice.

254
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:55,608
I hesitate to say this
after you so kindly saved us,

255
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,487
but killing people
is a bad habit.

256
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:11,416
You glisten too brightly.

257
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,627
- Glisten?
- Yes.

258
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,587
Like a drawn sword.

259
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,631
A drawn sword?

260
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:24,429
You're like a sword
without a sheath.

261
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,848
You cut well,

262
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:32,270
but the best sword
is kept in its sheath.

263
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,944
So what do we do with him?

264
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:45,616
Come with us, will you?

265
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,828
We won't harm you.

266
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,708
- Over here!
- What is it?

267
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,296
Hurry!
Over the rear wall!

268
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,440
That way!

269
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,193
Guard the front gate!

270
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,989
Hurry!

271
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:30,453
That may be easy for you,
but for us it's impossible.

272
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,704
Just try.

273
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,999
We can't.
Isn't that right, Mother?

274
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,168
Hurry!

275
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,922
Use me as a footstool.

276
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,510
- No, I couldn't.
- Never mind that.

277
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,178
But -

278
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:52,016
No buts. Your hesitation
will force me to kill more men.

279
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,185
Hurry!

280
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,229
Please forgive me.

281
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,868
Please hurry.

282
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,539
We can't let
Kurofuji's men see us.

283
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:40,439
- I'm hungry. Get me some food.
- The servants are making rice balls.

284
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,066
Got any sake?

285
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:46,904
This is no time for drinking.
We need to plan our next steps.

286
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,740
I'm smarter when I drink.

287
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:57,164
Sounds like Kikui plans to pin
his crimes on Chamberlain Mutsuta.

288
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:01,377
They may even force him
to write a confession, and then -

289
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,672
And then what?

290
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,515
You can be frank with us.

291
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,232
They'll make him commit harakiri.

292
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,236
What shall we do, Mother?

293
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,280
There's nothing to fear.

294
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,825
Your father is a shrewd old fox.

295
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,622
It won't be easy to make him
commit harakiri.

296
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:47,089
Now, what do you gentlemen
intend to do next?

297
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:51,844
First we'll find Uncle
and bring him back. Then -

298
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,971
That's all you need to do.

299
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:59,518
Pinning the blame on your uncle
is practically a confession of guilt.

300
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,064
If we rescue him,
they're finished.

301
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,818
That's quite correct.

302
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,488
But can we get him back?

303
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,032
If not, we're the ones
who're finished.

304
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:17,453
Well, then,
please do your best.

305
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:30,675
But please refrain
from excessive violence.

306
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,139
By the way,
may we know your name?

307
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,016
My name?

308
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,823
My name is...

309
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,377
Sanjuro Tsubaki...
(30-year-old Camellia)

310
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,754
though I'm now almost 40.

311
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,551
You're a most interesting man.

312
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,434
Speaking of camellias,
those are truly splendid.

313
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,771
Kurofuji's estate has so many
that it's called Camellia Mansion.

314
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,149
Let's see
what they're up to.

315
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,330
Anything happening?

316
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,420
It's very quiet.

317
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,821
Who's there?

318
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,200
It's just the camellias.

319
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:26,957
Why don't you calm down
and have another drink?

320
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,799
But Kurofuji,
what's going to happen?

321
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:39,470
I doubt Mutsuta will write
a confession so easily.

322
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:43,057
Leave that to Kikui.
Have a drink.

323
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,145
But Kikui's made
one blunder after another.

324
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:14,547
Chamberlain Mutsuta
is making trouble.

325
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,800
We underestimated him.
- You mean -

326
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,344
No, there's still a way.

327
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,681
We'll use his wife and daughter.

328
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,601
Who's there?
- Muroto.

329
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,742
Muroto's reporting
to Kurofuji right now.

330
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,203
Telling him he lost my aunt
and Chidori, no doubt.

331
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,039
If he's taking
that report next door,

332
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,250
that means the traitors
are there right now.

333
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,752
The three of them
must be hatching a scheme.

334
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:58,757
If they're in that house,
my uncle must be there too.

335
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,595
You idiot!
What were the guards doing?

336
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:07,600
Now what? We can't use
the women anymore.

337
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,727
Actually, we can.

338
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,439
Mutsuta doesn't know
we lost them.

339
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:18,152
The problem is,
they must be watching our homes.

340
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,990
They saw you enter.
They'll know we're here.

341
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,368
- We're in danger!
- Don't worry.

342
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:31,832
I sent messengers
to your homes as well.

343
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,921
Something's fishy at Kikui's place.
A man just rushed in.

344
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,505
What?

345
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,927
There's a commotion at Takebayashi's.
A messenger just barreled in.

346
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,014
It seems they're not together.

347
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,558
Then where's my uncle?

348
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:55,272
They'll eventually have to meet
where they have him confined.

349
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,941
We must wait for now.

350
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:00,945
Don't just wait.
The chamberlain has disappeared.

351
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:06,116
Raise a stink so people
demand to know why.

352
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:12,206
They want to kill him
before that happens. Don't let them.

353
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,751
They'll panic
and have a meeting.

354
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,097
- The emergency drum!
- What's going on?

355
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,682
It's part of our plan.

356
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:51,453
"We have found that Chamberlain
Mutsuta abused his authority.

357
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:57,334
Accused of malfeasance,
he tried to destroy the evidence.

358
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,628
Therefore,

359
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,590
the elders have sent a messenger
to Edo for instructions

360
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:08,554
and detained the chamberlain
as a precaution.

361
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,349
He seems to have
many followers.

362
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:16,437
Remain calm.
Do not let them incite you.

363
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,272
Superintendent Kikui."

364
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,154
They beat us to the punch.

365
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,406
They're clever enemies.

366
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,159
This is bad.

367
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:34,872
With the clan on their side,
we can't do anything.

368
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,375
Whatever we do
only proves their claims.

369
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,504
Meanwhile, they'll have
time to carry out their plan.

370
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,758
They won't make any rash moves.
- Yes, they will.

371
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,762
They don't know
there are only ten of us.

372
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,723
They said "many followers," right?

373
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,809
They can't sit idly by.

374
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,901
At any rate, we've done
everything we could.

375
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,863
Relax, Takebayashi.

376
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,365
We must focus
on breaking Mutsuta down.

377
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,909
And his men?

378
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,620
Their hands are tied.

379
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:21,168
That's what worries me.
Desperate men will try anything.

380
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,046
They're too dangerous.
We must act.

381
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,760
Very well.
Here's what we'll do.

382
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,597
We'll lure them out
once again, and then -

383
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,224
How will you do that?

384
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,767
There's one way:

385
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:40,771
Let them know
where the chamberlain is.

386
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,401
As you said,

387
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:51,281
they're desperate and will try
anything to get him back.

388
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,534
We'll arrest them
when they arrive.

389
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,246
Idiot! Are you mad?

390
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,332
I was afraid it would come to this.
- Listen.

391
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,627
It won't be here, of course.

392
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:07,506
We can lure them
to a place of our choosing.

393
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:11,135
We just let them know
where we'll be meeting.

394
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,472
- Never!
- Don't worry. There'll be no danger.

395
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,561
Our palanquins will arrive
at the meeting,

396
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:24,064
but we don't have
to be in them.

397
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,460
They're finally making a move!

398
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,963
I'll follow them.
Tell the others.

399
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,655
Kurofuji left in a palanquin.

400
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,747
Kurofuji's arrived
at Kikui's house.

401
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,291
- Kikui's house?
- That means -

402
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,379
Two palanquins
have left Kikui's.

403
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,257
- Two?
- Kurofuji and Kikui.

404
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,301
Where the hell are they going?

405
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,972
They've entered
Takebayashi's compound.

406
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,933
All three in the same place?

407
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,726
- That means -
- Yes, it must.

408
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,273
Three palanquins
have left Takebayashi's place.

409
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,485
They took the Akamatsu road west.
- West?

410
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,320
Kurofuji's villa is along that road.

411
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,364
That's the place. Let's go!

412
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,782
Wait.

413
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,285
If their men see you,
you're in trouble.

414
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,289
But there's only
one guard per palanquin.

415
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:09,962
This is fishy. The ten of us
could easily capture them all.

416
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,380
Good idea!

417
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,507
Capture them,
then make 'em talk.

418
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:17,719
Fool! Doesn't it seem
too good to be true?

419
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:21,014
And if it seems so,
it usually is.

420
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,726
But we can't
let this chance slip away.

421
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,646
Let's follow them for now.

422
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,607
Circumstances will decide
whether we attack or not.

423
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,734
What do you say?

424
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,864
It's a stupid plan, but some excitement
might keep me awake.

425
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,334
- Are they really inside?
- How should he know?

426
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,336
Are there any booby traps?

427
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,589
Idiot! That's even harder to tell.
What about hidden guards?

428
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,632
None at all.

429
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,676
Good, let's attack.

430
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,012
Quickly, before they enter the villa!

431
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,097
Wait.

432
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,184
I don't like the looks of this.

433
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,798
I told you to wait.

434
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,009
Something's not right here.
- Shut up!

435
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:24,221
Suit yourselves.
It isn't my problem.

436
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,140
Let's go!

437
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,837
Pardon us.

438
00:45:56,963 --> 00:46:02,092
These seem to be the palanquins
of our clan leaders.

439
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,179
We learned today
of the chamberlain's misdeeds

440
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,057
and that he has many followers.

441
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,852
It's careless to have
so few guards.

442
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:16,898
We offer you our services.

443
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:23,655
Surrender!

444
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,948
You're under arrest!

445
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,283
Under arrest?

446
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:31,788
Don't play dumb! Do you claim
not to be the chamberlain's men?

447
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,417
The chamberlain's men?
That's ridiculous!

448
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,296
Your denials ring hollow!
This is all Lord Kikui's trap.

449
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:43,216
You followed these decoy palanquins
right to your own downfall.

450
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,177
Wait.

451
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,984
I'm out of patience.
I've had enough of you idiots.

452
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:17,626
How did you get out?

453
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:24,216
I happened to sneeze loudly,
and the lady heard me.

454
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,760
She let me out of the closet.

455
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,972
This fool's wearing my best kimono.

456
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,225
I apologize.
She let me wear it.

457
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,228
But why didn't you escape?

458
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:43,860
It never occurred to the lady
that I would, so I couldn't.

459
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:48,740
Also, I've overheard
your discussions since last night,

460
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,868
and they contradict
everything I've been told.

461
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,995
I've learned a great deal.

462
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,795
Now, if you'll excuse me.

463
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,808
The lady is hopelessly naïve.

464
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:18,061
She's a little slow, that's all.

465
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:24,859
So you mean the horsemen
weren't the conspirators?

466
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,403
Yes.

467
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,906
We know that...

468
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:35,078
because we released them,
but they refused to go.

469
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:42,002
They even went to the estate,
demanding an explanation.

470
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,385
Trapped by your own little tricks!

471
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:54,055
You've made yet more enemies.

472
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,932
I wonder about that.

473
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,520
They were coming
to our defense.

474
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,818
If we explain why we used the decoys,
they may agree to help us.

475
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,069
What do you think?

476
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:12,741
Indeed.
They're proud of their skills

477
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,118
and will gladly
use them to aid us.

478
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,620
Good.

479
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,664
Add them to my roster
and send them here.

480
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:25,795
This isn't like you.
That will reveal that we're here.

481
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,299
And why not?

482
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,385
It's time for a showdown.

483
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,651
We've come as far as we can.

484
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,280
Judging from those horsemen,

485
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,241
the clan members
are all on the traitors' side.

486
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,077
That's right.

487
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,829
We're as good as dead.

488
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,041
We don't stand a chance, do we?

489
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:08,046
It doesn't matter. Live or die,
the nine of us are together.

490
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,382
Ten of us.

491
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,348
I'll go see Kikui.

492
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,976
What for?

493
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,062
To offer my services.

494
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:27,232
Muroto kindly offered me a job.

495
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,417
- Where are you going?
- After him.

496
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,044
- To see what he's up to.
- What if he betrays us?

497
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,004
Idiots!

498
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,341
Why tell us his plan
if he intends to betray us?

499
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,177
Muroto's invitation allows him
to look around the grounds.

500
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,263
- I agree.
- Me too.

501
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,558
- Shut up, little boy!
- No! He would never do that to us!

502
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,394
I'd like to think so too,
but the way he said it -

503
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,814
He was just provoking us.
That's how he is.

504
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,692
It's true.

505
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:14,154
But you never know
what he'll do.

506
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:16,489
He's a monster!

507
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:44,309
- What the hell do you want?
- Tell Muroto I'm here.

508
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,311
He's busy!

509
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:25,767
So you made it!

510
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,394
I've been waiting for you.

511
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:34,234
But I hear you're busy.
I'll come again.

512
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,736
I don't mind. Come in.

513
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,664
I don't care what you say.
I trust him.

514
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,542
Think how many times
he's saved our lives!

515
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,127
It doesn't mean
he'll do it again!

516
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,505
Why should we mean
anything to him?

517
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,216
He has to worry about himself.

518
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,678
He has a job waiting
if he turns us in.

519
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:05,640
How dare you! He may dress in rags,
but he's a true samurai.

520
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:09,853
Look how he thrashed Kikui's men!
- Quiet!

521
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:15,108
He begged us for money.
A samurai would starve rather than beg.

522
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:19,070
He's just outspoken
and a bit eccentric.

523
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,155
I refuse to doubt him.

524
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,075
He's a good man.
I don't care what logic says.

525
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,246
You're the lady's kin.
You'll trust anyone, but -

526
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,081
What is it?

527
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:40,675
You were shouting so loudly.
Mother sent me to ask what's wrong.

528
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,719
Nothing.

529
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,388
But -

530
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:46,681
It's nothing!

531
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,152
Excuse me.

532
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,785
I've been listening carefully
from the closet.

533
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,580
- Get back in there!
- In a moment.

534
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,250
I trust that ronin as well.

535
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,960
Please listen.

536
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:21,507
It may sound strange,
but when the lady climbed the wall,

537
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:26,137
he got on all fours
to serve as her footstool.

538
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:30,934
He was moved by her purity of soul.
That alone shows he's a good man.

539
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:35,313
Nonsense!
He called her "a little slow."

540
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:40,193
As someone said,
that's just his odd way of speaking.

541
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,029
His praise
comes out as abuse.

542
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,663
- Now you understand?
- No, I don't!

543
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,457
- You still insist?
- Enough talk!

544
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,502
We're following him.
He's dangerous.

545
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,796
We mustn't fight
among ourselves.

546
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:03,174
Our judgment will be skewed
if only the doubters go.

547
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:06,135
Let's take two from each side.

548
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,807
Yasukawa and Kawahara,
Izaka and Hirose.

549
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:48,011
The household is nearly empty,
so we can't welcome you properly.

550
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:51,472
But we can still
share a drink.

551
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,854
I'm grateful.

552
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:04,277
With your help,
we'll see some real results.

553
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,239
You came just in time.

554
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,200
I saw the notice board.

555
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,370
It seems
there's unrest in the clan.

556
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:19,584
A large contingent of men just left.
Where did they go?

557
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,336
I'll take you there now.

558
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:30,386
Just so you know, everything
in that notice was a bald-faced lie.

559
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:34,974
Superintendent Kikui
is the rotten one.

560
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,352
- But you're his -
- Retainer.

561
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:42,231
Like attracts like.
I'm rotten too.

562
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:51,741
You see, Chamberlain Mutsuta
is a shrewd character.

563
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,910
Not easy to break.

564
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:59,248
But with him out of the way,
this clan is ours for the taking.

565
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,628
Kikui is cunning
but not a commanding presence.

566
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:06,255
He pushes Mutsuta
out of the way -

567
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,258
And you and I eat him up.

568
00:57:09,802 --> 00:57:11,511
Precisely.

569
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:17,308
I'll take you to him now.

570
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:22,105
But remember:
He has an inflated view of himself, so -

571
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,359
Stroke his ego
and he'll purr?

572
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:31,948
You catch on fast.
Good boy.

573
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,052
Someone's following us.

574
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,682
Turn right at the corner.

575
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,802
Take them alive!

576
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:44,937
Fool! What's this?

577
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,940
I was against it,
but they said you'd betray us.

578
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,444
Idiot! Now you'll have
to give yourself up.

579
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:55,239
Muroto's coming. Attack me!
Don't just stand there!

580
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,451
Come on!

581
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,046
This greenhorn here
put up a good fight.

582
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:16,594
A fine present.
He's the leader of the resistance.

583
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,888
Izaka, the chamberlain's nephew.

584
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,657
They make a good present,

585
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,826
but they're too heavy
to carry to Kikui.

586
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:01,555
Take them away.

587
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,434
Get up!

588
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:17,488
We should take more men.
The others will try to rescue these four.

589
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,324
We're defenseless
on the road.

590
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,702
Very well.

591
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,463
Bring reinforcements quickly.

592
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,884
It's not safe to go alone.

593
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,594
Take two men with you.

594
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:55,443
Three's not enough.
I'll go too.

595
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,631
I'm going with you.

596
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,527
It's me! Open up!

597
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,073
What happened?

598
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,992
Those three are already dead.

599
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,541
It must have been them.

600
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,508
I'll go instead.
Where is it?

601
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:04,387
Nobody knows you there.
I'll go. You take charge here.

602
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,819
We've had enough
of your trouble.

603
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,749
What are you doing?

604
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,086
Can't you tell?

605
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,422
I'm setting them free.

606
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,732
This butchery
is all thanks to you.

607
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,456
Tie me up!

608
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:12,449
We're too late. Ten men stay
to clean up. The rest hurry back.

609
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,811
What's this mess?

610
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,730
I expected more from you.

611
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,898
I'm deeply ashamed.

612
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:50,321
But when you're that outnumbered,
you can only surrender.

613
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:57,661
I'm not bound by duty
to die like these guys here.

614
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,497
This isn't good.

615
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:06,128
I can't recommend you
after a disgrace like this.

616
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,881
I'm sorry.

617
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,844
But I remember
that greenhorn's face.

618
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,139
I'll redeem myself
by bringing him to you.

619
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,651
You're all so damned clever!

620
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:32,071
You ruined my well-laid plan.

621
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:36,283
And you still don't know
where Kikui's huge army went.

622
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,830
What a life of leisure!

623
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:46,001
At this rate,
by the time you find Mutsuta,

624
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:50,047
I'll be a silver-haired
70-year-old.

625
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,891
How beautiful!

626
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:06,063
This water comes
from the Camellia Mansion next door.

627
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,565
How do you know that?

628
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:13,445
I once heard Terada tell Iori,

629
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:19,034
"They say stealing another's water
is wrong even if you're parched,

630
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:23,872
but I'm drinking the water
of that blackguard Kurofuji."

631
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,672
Look.

632
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:40,222
Iori’s name is on that paper.

633
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:43,350
I see Terada's name too.

634
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:47,271
What's that red blot?

635
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,151
- It's signed in blood!
- Blood?

636
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,820
Iori!

637
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,576
Not so loud!
Kurofuji is next door.

638
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:04,288
But you should see this.
Shouldn't he, Mother?

639
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,457
What is that?

640
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:30,272
So Uncle tore up our petition,
then placed it in his sleeve.

641
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,235
He wore the same kimono
when Kikui abducted him

642
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,781
as when I met
with him earlier that day.

643
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,575
Right?

644
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,622
That means -

645
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:50,042
Look what I found in the stream!

646
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,669
Pieces of the torn petition.

647
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,799
No doubt about it.

648
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,051
Uncle is next door.

649
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:05,182
In order to protect us,
fools that we are,

650
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,978
he seized a moment
when his captors weren't looking

651
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,065
and threw these in the stream.

652
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,323
Aren't you tired
of being stupid yet?

653
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,370
You want to attack?
That's what they're waiting for.

654
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:33,043
Don't you get it?
Kikui's men are next door.

655
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,712
Take a look
if you doubt me.

656
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,218
- He wrote it?
- Finally?

657
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,698
What is this?

658
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,992
This isn't a confession!

659
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,911
It's an indictment!

660
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,414
The skunk!
How long will he keep this up?

661
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,416
What now?

662
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:08,805
There are a great many of them.

663
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,149
What do we do?

664
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,944
They overestimate our number,
which is worse.

665
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,737
That's it!

666
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:28,283
I'll go tell them
I know where you are.

667
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:35,332
They overestimate
the size of your group.

668
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:39,169
If I say an army
has assembled somewhere,

669
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,340
Kikui will send his men there.

670
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,343
The house will be empty,

671
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,471
leaving you free to raid it.

672
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,643
Where shall I say you are?

673
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:58,814
Another shrine would be boring.
How about a temple?

674
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:05,404
I'll say I was snoozing on the second floor
of the gate and heard you swarm in.

675
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:08,448
Not a bad plan, eh?
You know a good temple?

676
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:15,330
Far enough away to give you time
to rescue the chamberlain.

677
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:20,711
Komyo Temple.
A good distance, and very secluded.

678
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,630
Good. Komyo Temple it is.

679
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,383
But listen.

680
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:31,513
Even after Kikui's men leave,
wait for my signal.

681
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,225
Once you're inside,
rescue him quickly.

682
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,769
They're still willing to kill him
as a last recourse.

683
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,658
There's no other way.

684
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,374
We must turn
to our last recourse.

685
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,545
Understand?

686
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:09,051
Wait until I signal
that it's safe to rescue him.

687
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,011
We understand.
What's the signal?

688
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,930
Wait until I've set
the house ablaze.

689
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:17,100
Goodness, no!
That's too reckless.

690
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,897
I have an idea.

691
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:27,194
Send something
down the stream.

692
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:32,407
We'll watch the stream
and see your signal for sure.

693
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:37,913
My dear,
that's a marvelous idea.

694
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:41,124
Such a beautifully gentle approach.

695
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:45,587
Mother, since it's
from Camellia Mansion,

696
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:48,590
wouldn't camellias be nice?

697
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:52,427
Red camellias...

698
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,888
how lovely that would be.

699
01:13:55,181 --> 01:14:00,060
I rather prefer white myself.

700
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:05,107
What's the difference?
It's all camellias.

701
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:07,484
But sometimes
they fall in naturally.

702
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,945
I'll dump in a pile of 'em.

703
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,509
Open up!

704
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,803
I want to see Muroto.

705
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:47,524
Bad news!

706
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:51,987
Komyo Temple's gate
doesn't have a second story!

707
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:55,240
They'll see
right through his story!

708
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:08,503
How did you know I was here?

709
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,592
I heard the superintendent's men
were here.

710
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,969
I assumed you would be too.

711
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,558
What do you want?

712
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,812
I brought you a nice gift.

713
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:32,444
I was asleep on the second floor
of the gate at Komyo Temple...

714
01:15:43,915 --> 01:15:47,292
- What'll we do?
- It's too late.

715
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:50,295
We didn't catch
the mistake right off.

716
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,299
Maybe they won't either.

717
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,136
I'll have a look.

718
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,978
Wait in here for now.

719
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,622
- What? 130 men at Komyo Temple?
- So he says.

720
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:13,211
- Who's this ronin asleep above the gate?
- Never mind that now.

721
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,881
Kikui, we can't afford
another failure.

722
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:21,052
Very well.
I'll go myself this time.

723
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,821
We're going to Komyo Temple.
You're coming with us.

724
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:47,162
Actually, I haven't
eaten since yesterday.

725
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,831
I can't fight
on an empty stomach.

726
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,083
Give me something to eat.

727
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,503
I'll catch up with you
after I've eaten.

728
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:32,123
It worked!
The men have left!

729
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,250
- You sure?
- Even Kikui was on his horse.

730
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:37,003
- Kikui left too?
- He was livid!

731
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,516
Thank you for your patience.

732
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:35,270
I want to eat alone.
Scram. It's cramped in here.

733
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,582
What are you doing?

734
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,546
I like camellias.

735
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,425
Enough games!

736
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,271
Wait a minute!

737
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:04,192
The gate at Komyo Temple -
It's all a lie!

738
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,501
Is anybody here?

739
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:29,717
It's a trap! That temple gate
has no second floor!

740
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:32,136
Call your men back!
It's a trap!

741
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:35,640
There's blood on your sword,
and it's fresh.

742
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:38,351
You tricked me last night,
you scum.

743
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,062
You can question him later!
Hurry!

744
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,048
You guys are done for.

745
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:12,844
No, you are.

746
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:17,599
Poor fools,
you have no idea.

747
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:21,436
They'll be attacking soon.

748
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:22,979
Who?

749
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:26,566
The conspirators, of course.

750
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:32,614
They're next door,
waiting for my signal.

751
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:37,744
Without my signal to abort,
you'll be dead before the army returns.

752
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:43,875
Take a look
if you don't believe me.

753
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:19,243
- Still no signal?
- What's taking him so long?

754
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,372
If something's happened to him,
he can't signal.

755
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:25,500
- What shall we do?
- We can't wait.

756
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:27,960
Let's attack!
- But...

757
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:36,511
We can't wait!

758
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:40,723
Hold on! We always botch things
by ignoring his orders.

759
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,934
Let's wait for the signal.

760
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:56,614
It's just as he said!
We have to do something quick!

761
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,909
See? You'd better hurry.

762
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,830
But I'll make you an offer.

763
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,874
I'll tell you the signal
for fifty ryo.

764
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:10,503
Gramps, they were
watching the stream, right?

765
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:12,714
He's right.

766
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:16,259
You'd better hurry and send
something down the stream.

767
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:22,890
He had a lot of red camellias
when he was caught!

768
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:26,978
What are they the signal for?

769
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,899
- Give me fifty ryo.
- Tell us or we'll kill you!

770
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,194
Okay, 30.

771
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:38,823
All right, I'll tell you.

772
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:42,493
Red camellias mean to attack.

773
01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:45,246
White means to abort.

774
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:50,042
No signal means I'm in trouble,
and they'll attack.

775
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,755
Don't forget: the white ones!

776
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,179
Hurry!

777
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,559
Don't be stingy! Pile them in!

778
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,166
The signal!

779
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:33,169
How beautiful!

780
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,052
What a close call!

781
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:46,933
Thanks for your help, fellas!
The color made no difference.

782
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:51,479
130 men are on their way!
Flap around all you like!

783
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,111
Don't kill them!

784
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,716
Open up! It's Muroto!

785
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,010
Open the gate!

786
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,970
It's all over.

787
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:53,267
This one's late.

788
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:56,938
What was his name again?
- Tsubaki.

789
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:01,359
Forgetting the name of the man
who saved your life -

790
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:04,946
that's awful.
- Yes, I know.

791
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,491
Dear, will you ask him
to come in?

792
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:12,203
Let him know everyone is waiting.

793
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:27,593
Let's get this unpleasant subject
over with now.

794
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:32,264
The traitors
have been sentenced.

795
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:40,272
Kikui chose to commit harakiri
soon after the incident.

796
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,401
A regrettable turn of events.

797
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:48,030
Like the other two, his family name
would have been revoked,

798
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,992
and he and his household banished,

799
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:56,956
but I could have at least
had his life spared.

800
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:06,215
I had hoped to deal
with the corruption more discreetly.

801
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:12,013
I'd planned to gather
evidence of their traitorous intent

802
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,183
and force them to retire quietly.

803
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,771
Forgive us.

804
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:24,025
No need to apologize.

805
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:29,113
I'm at fault for not inspiring
your confidence.

806
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:35,161
This long horse face of mine
causes all sorts of trouble.

807
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,875
A long time ago,

808
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:46,672
someone saw me on horseback
and said,

809
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:50,926
"The rider has a longer face
than the horse!"

810
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:10,071
- He's gone.
- Gone?

811
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:13,574
I found only this kimono
in his room.

812
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:16,202
So he left in his rags?

813
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:20,623
Gentlemen, please break
into groups and find him.

814
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:21,999
Quickly!

815
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:37,515
Thank goodness he won't return.

816
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:40,518
Thank goodness?

817
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:44,271
He's a great man.

818
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:50,444
But extraordinary men like him
just make me look bad.

819
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,864
Listen.

820
01:30:54,616 --> 01:31:00,371
He would find it
too confining here.

821
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,416
He wouldn't want
to wear these fine garments

822
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:09,630
and be a docile servant
of the clan.

823
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:22,143
- I don't see him anywhere.
- The guard said he went west.

824
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,478
Then it has to be this road.

825
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,903
There he is!

826
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:44,748
Go home.
I'm not going back.

827
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:55,384
- You insist on fighting?
- Yes.

828
01:31:56,011 --> 01:32:00,431
I've never been so outraged.
You made a fool of me.

829
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:02,933
Don't get so angry.

830
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,102
I had to do it.

831
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,523
I knew you were stronger than me,
so I had to -

832
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:12,610
It's too late for words.
Draw!

833
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:16,906
I'd rather not.

834
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:20,284
If I do, one of us must die.

835
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:22,286
It's not worth it.

836
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:24,914
It is to me.

837
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:29,877
Otherwise I can
never be at peace.

838
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:34,423
Very well.

839
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:39,220
But even if you kill me,

840
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:41,597
you mustn't kill them.

841
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:45,267
No matter what,
you all stay out of this!

842
01:33:55,005 --> 01:33:56,380
That was brilliant!

843
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,884
Idiot!
What do you know about anything?

844
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:13,564
Be careful.

845
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:17,484
I'm in a bad mood.

846
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:33,167
He was just like me.

847
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:38,672
A drawn sword
that wouldn't stay in its sheath.

848
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:44,053
But you know,
the lady was right.

849
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,973
The best sword
is kept in its sheath.

850
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,354
You'd better stay in yours.

851
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:07,076
Stop following me
or I'll kill you!

852
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,561
See ya around.

853
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:47,908
