1
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:10,448
Bow to the board.

2
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,459
This is the boy.

3
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:17,760
Born here in the workhouse.
Moved to the parish farm.

4
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,660
Nine years old today.
Time to be moved back here.

5
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,164
What's your name, boy?

6
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,367
-Oliver Twist.
-What?

7
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:34,136
-That boy's a fool.
-Boy. Listen to me.

8
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:36,736
You know you are an orphan,
I suppose.

9
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:39,314
-What's that?
-The boy is a fool. I thought he was.

10
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,711
You know you've got
no father or mother...

11
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,582
...and that you were brought up
by the parish, don't you?

12
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:47,348
-Yes, sir.
-What are you crying for?

13
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:50,321
I hope you say your prayers
every night.

14
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:54,292
Pray for those that feed you
and take care of you...

15
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:55,691
...Iike a Christian.

16
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:57,799
-Yes, sir.
-Well...

17
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,901
...you have come here
to be educated...

18
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:02,435
...and to be taught a useful trade.

19
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:17,683
Here, where do you want these?

20
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:36,295
Learn from the boy next to you.

21
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:40,633
-What am I to learn, sir?
-Learn to pick out the oakum.

22
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,171
What's oakum, sir?

23
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,940
Stop asking so many questions.

24
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:48,477
Oakum's the fibers you unpick
from the old rope.

25
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:52,845
Then it's used again
for the ships of Her Majesty's navy.

26
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:55,247
You're serving your country.

27
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,046
Now, get on with it.

28
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:34,424
Tom, give it a rest, will you?
We're trying to sleep.

29
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:40,626
-Can't sleep, too hungry.
-We're all hungry.

30
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,298
Yes, but I'm frightened.

31
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:45,058
Frightened? Why?

32
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:47,731
Why? Why?

33
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:52,430
I'm so hungry, I'm frightened I might
eat the lad that sleeps next to me.

34
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,532
O Lord God...

35
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:32,734
...for the blessing of this generous
and bountiful meal...

36
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:35,038
...that thou hast placed before us...

37
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,976
...we give thanks. Amen.

38
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:40,549
Amen.

39
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:03,527
Please, sir. I want some more.

40
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,457
What?

41
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,158
Please, sir, I want some more.

42
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:23,573
Fetch the beadle!

43
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,880
Mr. Limbkins.

44
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,718
I beg your pardon, sir.

45
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:39,328
Oliver Twist has asked for more.

46
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:42,195
For more?!

47
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:45,129
Compose yourself, Mr. Bumble,
and answer me distinctly.

48
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:49,931
Do I understand that he asked for
more after he had eaten his supper?

49
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,401
He did, sir.

50
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:57,371
That boy will be hanged.

51
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:12,425
"Five pounds and a b--"

52
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:19,858
When I says "whoa,"
I means "whoa"!

53
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,966
"Health-- Healthy...

54
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:27,574
...appren-- apprentice.

55
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,040
Five pounds."

56
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,580
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.

57
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:38,150
Young boys have been smothered
in chimneys before now.

58
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:41,583
That's because they damp the straw
afore they light it in the chimney...

59
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:45,588
...to make them come out again.
Damp straw makes smoke.

60
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,920
Smoke sends a boy to sleep,
and that's what he wants.

61
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:51,120
Boys is very lazy, gentlemen.

62
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:54,788
But there's nothing like a good hot
blaze to make them come out in a run.

63
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:57,997
It's humane too. Yes.

64
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:01,263
Because even if they've
stuck in the chimney...

65
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:06,536
...roasting their feet makes them
struggle to extricate theirselves.

66
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,076
Yes.

67
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,181
I suppose he's fond of
chimney sweeping?

68
00:10:10,382 --> 00:10:12,612
He dotes on it, Your Worship.

69
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:15,547
Very well. I will sign the indentures...

70
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:19,718
...to make him Mr....

71
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:23,984
Mr. Gamfield's apprentice.

72
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:34,496
My boy.

73
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:40,440
My boy, you look pale and alarmed.

74
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:41,805
What's the matter?

75
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:45,280
Please, sir. Please, sir.

76
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,540
What is it, my boy?

77
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:49,513
-Don't....
-Now then.

78
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,846
Don't.... Don't....

79
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:54,922
Go on, my boy. Don't what?

80
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:58,285
Please don't send me away
with this dreadful man, sir.

81
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:01,496
Of all the designing orphans
that I've ever seen....

82
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:04,394
-Hold your tongue, beadle.
-Did Your Worship speak to me?

83
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:07,160
Yes, hold your tongue.

84
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:11,366
No. No, out of the question.

85
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:15,508
We refuse to sanction
these indentures.

86
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,175
Take the boy away.

87
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,878
And treat him kindly.

88
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,712
He seems to want it.

89
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,864
I've just taken the measure of
the two women that died last night.

90
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,903
You'll make your fortune,
Mr. Sowerberry.

91
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,401
Think so?

92
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,742
The prices allowed by the board
are very small.

93
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,211
So are the coffins.

94
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:03,517
By the by, you don't know anybody
who wants a boy, do you?

95
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:09,285
Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry.
Liberal terms.

96
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:21,727
Now, as you are to meet
your new master...

97
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:23,929
...pull that cap off your eyes.

98
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:28,332
Hold your head up, sir.

99
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,307
Dry your eyes, sir.

100
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:42,390
-ls that you, Bumble?
-No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.

101
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:45,754
I've brought the orphan,
Oliver Twist.

102
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,589
So this is the orphan, is it?

103
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,231
Mrs. Sowerberry...

104
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:53,595
...will you have the goodness
to come here a moment, my dear?

105
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:56,362
Oliver Twist.

106
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,869
How comes an orphan
to have any name at all?

107
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:01,507
-I invented it.
-You, Mr. Bumble?

108
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,301
I, Mr. Sowerberry.

109
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:06,946
I name all our foundlings
in alphabetical order.

110
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:08,842
The last was S.

111
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:10,846
Swubble, I named him.

112
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,817
This was a T. Twist,
I named him.

113
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,615
Next one as comes
will be Unwin...

114
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:19,519
...and the next, Vilkins.

115
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:23,492
I've got names ready
all through the alphabet, right up to Z.

116
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:27,096
Why, you're quite
a literary character, sir.

117
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,494
Well, well...

118
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:31,692
-...perhaps I may be.
-Mrs. Sowerberry...

119
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:34,497
...this is the orphan
from the workhouse.

120
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,207
Dear me, he's very small.

121
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,400
But he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry.
He'll grow.

122
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:45,106
Yes, I daresay he will.
On our food and drink.

123
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:50,048
Workhouse boys always cost more
to keep than they're worth.

124
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:53,554
Get downstairs, you bag of bones.

125
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:55,858
Here, Charlotte...

126
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:59,723
...give this boy some of the cold bits
that were put by for the dog.

127
00:14:28,123 --> 00:14:30,852
You don't mind sleeping
among the coffins, I suppose.

128
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:33,459
Well, it doesn't much matter
whether you do or don't...

129
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:36,152
...for you can't sleep anywhere else.

130
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,062
Open the door, will you?

131
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:10,047
-You the new boy?
-Yes, sir.

132
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:13,379
-How old are you?
-Ten, sir.

133
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:17,718
Then I'll whop you one when I get in,
you workhouse brat.

134
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,835
I beg your pardon, sir.
Did you knock?

135
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:38,237
I kicked.

136
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:40,878
Did you want a coffin, sir?

137
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,809
-You don't know who I am, I suppose.
-No, sir.

138
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:47,452
Well, I'm Mr. Noah Claypole.
And you're under me.

139
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:50,178
Now, take down the shutters.

140
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:59,225
Saved a nice little bit of bacon for you
from the master's breakfast.

141
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,971
In the corner with you.
And be quick about it.

142
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:10,334
They'll want you to mind the shop.
Do you hear?

143
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:12,338
Do you hear, Workhouse?
In the corner.

144
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:14,976
Oh, Lord, Noah, let the boy alone.

145
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,943
Let him alone?

146
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:19,083
Why, everybody's let him alone.

147
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:23,810
His mother, father and all
his relations has let him alone.

148
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:26,615
So he needs someone who don't.

149
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,004
Supper.

150
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:52,177
Oliver, ain't you done yet?

151
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:57,545
I've never known such an idle boy.
Get down them stairs.

152
00:17:57,752 --> 00:17:59,117
Mr. Sowerberry...

153
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,015
...supper.

154
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:04,389
-I've had a thought, my dear.
-Had a thought?

155
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:07,425
You want to be careful,
Mr. Sowerberry, you'll get brain fever.

156
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,155
-It's about young Twist.
-What about him?

157
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:14,891
-A very good-looking boy.
-He will be. He eats enough.

158
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:19,661
There's an expression of melancholy
in his face, my dear.

159
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:23,433
He would make a delightful mute,
my love.

160
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,806
I-- I don't mean a regular mute to
attend grown-up funerals, my dear...

161
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,815
...but only for children's practice.

162
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,327
Look at him.

163
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:51,897
Look at him.

164
00:18:52,904 --> 00:18:56,999
A workhouse boy and a sneak.
Look at him.

165
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,334
Mark my words, I'll see him hung.

166
00:18:59,844 --> 00:19:02,175
Can't be too soon.

167
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:08,005
Workhouse, how's your mother?

168
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:11,043
She's dead.

169
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:14,146
What'd she die of, Workhouse?

170
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:19,159
You gonna cry, Workhouse?

171
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:22,798
-What set you off?
-Not you.

172
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:28,865
-Not me, eh?
-No, not you.

173
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:31,535
And you better not say anything
about my mother.

174
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,710
Better not?

175
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:38,011
About your mother?

176
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:41,182
Well, I'm very sorry,
and I pity you very much.

177
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:43,044
But you must know, Workhouse...

178
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,411
...your mother was
a regular right-down bad one.

179
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,547
-What did you say?
-A regular right-down bad one.

180
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,555
It's a good thing she died
when she did...

181
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,126
...or she'd be hard laboring
or transported.

182
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,663
Or hung. Which is most likely,
isn't it, Workhouse?

183
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,499
Help, Mrs. Charlotte!

184
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,467
He'll murder me. Help!

185
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,098
Help. Get off!

186
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,409
For God's sake, help me!

187
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,707
My missus, he's murdering me!

188
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,382
-Get off. Get off me now!
-Get him, Charlotte.

189
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:22,179
Get him now. Go out with him.
Come on.

190
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,550
-Workhouse devil.
-I'll learn you!

191
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,553
-You brat!
-Get the door, Charlotte.

192
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,786
In with him. In.

193
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:42,931
Very violent indeed, sir.

194
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:45,203
And the missus said...

195
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:48,038
...if Mr. Bumble can spare the time...

196
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:50,941
...then Mr. Bumble's to flog him...

197
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:52,978
...because the master's out.

198
00:20:58,154 --> 00:21:00,485
-ln there.
-Oliver?

199
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,554
Let me out of here!

200
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:05,488
-Do you know this here voice, Oliver?
-Yes.

201
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:07,286
Ain't you afraid of it, sir?

202
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:10,055
Ain't you trembling
while I speak, sir?

203
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:12,063
No!

204
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:18,868
-He must be mad.
-It's not madness, ma'am, it's meat.

205
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:20,938
-Meat?
-Meat, ma'am, meat.

206
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:22,336
You've overfed him.

207
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:25,376
If you'd kept this boy on gruel,
this would never have happened.

208
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,845
Dear, dear.
This comes of being liberal.

209
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:31,479
What's all this?

210
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:34,313
Oliver Twist has turned violent,
Mr. Sowerberry.

211
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:37,251
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.

212
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:43,622
Now then. Now then.

213
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,663
-You're a nice young fellow, ain't you?
-He called my mother names.

214
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:51,894
Well, and what if he did,
you little ungrateful wretch!

215
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,003
She deserved what he said
and worse.

216
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:55,399
-She didn't!
-She did!

217
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:57,302
It's a lie!

218
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:05,716
Do something, Mr. Sowerberry.
He called me a liar.

219
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:08,346
Do something!

220
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,812
I beg your pardon, miss...

221
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:39,144
...but would you be so kind--?

222
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:42,052
Get off my land.

223
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:44,881
I don't want no beggars here.
Go on!

224
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:48,855
Get off! Or I'll put the dog on you!

225
00:26:28,362 --> 00:26:33,231
I haven't much,
but you're more than welcome to it.

226
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:36,397
Be careful, it's hot.

227
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:50,409
Seeing you gave me such a turn.

228
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:55,051
My eyes ain't what they were.
But...

229
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:58,882
...I just thought for a moment....

230
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:10,693
Why are you on the road at all,
a little mite like you?

231
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:14,602
-Where are you headed?
-London, ma'am.

232
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,974
London?

233
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:20,006
London.

234
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:24,205
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

235
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:49,988
Hello, my man.

236
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,995
And what's your game?

237
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:58,124
You're not from these parts?

238
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,663
Where you from, then?

239
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:06,276
I've been walking. Seven days.

240
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:09,538
Seven days? Cor.

241
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:10,941
I expect you want grub?

242
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:13,712
And you shall have it.

243
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,443
I'm at a low-water mark meself
just at the moment...

244
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:19,151
...but I'll fork out and stump.

245
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,119
Come on, up with you, on your pins.

246
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,624
And these won't get out again?

247
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:33,825
Thank you very much.

248
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:35,833
Oh, by the by...

249
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:39,872
...my name is Jack Dawkins,
better known as the Artful Dodger.

250
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:42,372
Oliver Twist.

251
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:46,503
Why are you known as
the Artful Dodger?

252
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:49,049
That's why.

253
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:58,490
Got any lodgings?

254
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:00,455
Money?

255
00:30:01,027 --> 00:30:04,485
I suppose you want someplace
to sleep tonight, don't you?

256
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:42,529
Baby newt.

257
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:45,965
Buy a baby newt, 4 pennies.

258
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:51,040
I expect you walking for so long
was a beak's order.

259
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:54,768
-What does that mean?
-Don't you know what a beak is?

260
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,970
-A bird's mouth, isn't it?
-Cor, you are green.

261
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:01,413
A beak's a magistrate, my son.
Where you been all your life?

262
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:03,245
Get off me, you!

263
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:05,422
That's it, you asked for it.

264
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:12,592
Come back here.
I wanna talk to you.

265
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,193
Lucky heather.

266
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:34,506
--from where I am, mate,
I'm telling you.

267
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,250
Go home!

268
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:46,753
Get off of that!

269
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,361
Go back home!

270
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:57,226
-Now then.
-Plummy and slam.

271
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:02,637
-There's two of you. Who's he?
-A new pal.

272
00:32:02,842 --> 00:32:04,741
-Where'd he come from?
-Greenland.

273
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:08,538
-ls the old one there?
-Upstairs, sorting the wipes.

274
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,222
This is him, Fagin.
My new friend, Oliver Twist.

275
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:33,335
Well, well, Oliver Twist.

276
00:32:35,106 --> 00:32:38,837
I hope I have the honor
of a more intimate acquaintance.

277
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:42,538
We're very glad to see you, Oliver.
Very.

278
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:45,145
Dodger, take off the sausages...

279
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:50,182
...and let's make a space
at the table for Oliver.

280
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:53,856
You were staring at the
pocket handkerchiefs, eh, my dear?

281
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,026
There's a good many of them,
ain't there?

282
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:58,353
We've just looked them out,
ready for the wash.

283
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:00,459
That's all, my dear.

284
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:03,626
Blow it.

285
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:08,392
Hot. Blow it.

286
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:11,299
Now then, Oliver,
what you must have...

287
00:33:11,773 --> 00:33:15,037
...is a hot gin and water.
Warms the cockles.

288
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:19,042
Only, drink it quick because another
of these gentlemen wants the tumbler.

289
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:43,164
He's such a nice lad.

290
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:46,806
I have a feeling he'll turn out
a hard worker.

291
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:49,372
Yeah, a hard worker.

292
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:16,667
Oliver?

293
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:21,962
Oliver?

294
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:37,768
Clever dogs.

295
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,381
Clever dogs.

296
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:52,146
Fine fellows.

297
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:58,151
All fine fellows.

298
00:36:00,397 --> 00:36:03,925
Fine fellows.

299
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:06,625
Fine fellows.

300
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:11,305
Fine fellows.

301
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,575
Fine fellows.

302
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:22,474
What do you watch me for?
Why are you awake?

303
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:24,312
What have you seen?
Speak out, boy!

304
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,646
Quick. Quick, or it's your life!

305
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:28,915
I wasn't able to sleep
any longer, sir.

306
00:36:29,124 --> 00:36:30,614
I'm very sorry if I disturbed you.

307
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:32,690
-You were not awake a moment ago?
-No, sir.

308
00:36:32,895 --> 00:36:35,055
-You sure?
-Yes, sir.

309
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:41,295
Of course you were asleep, my dear.
I know that.

310
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:43,296
I only tried to frighten you.

311
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,396
You're a brave boy, Oliver.

312
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:50,835
Did you see any
of those pretty things, my dear?

313
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,739
Yes, sir.

314
00:36:53,214 --> 00:36:54,805
They....

315
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:58,283
They're mine, Oliver.
My little property.

316
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:00,715
For my old age.

317
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:03,148
It's our secret.

318
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:06,353
-You understand, my dear?
-Yes, sir.

319
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:09,155
Can I go up now, sir?

320
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,393
Now....

321
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:57,168
I hope you've been at work
this morning, my dears.

322
00:37:57,372 --> 00:37:58,566
-Hard.
-As nails.

323
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,140
Good boys.

324
00:38:00,342 --> 00:38:01,810
Good boys.

325
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:04,536
-What you got, Dodger?
-Couple of pocketbooks.

326
00:38:04,746 --> 00:38:06,941
-Lined?
-Pretty well.

327
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:12,009
Yeah.

328
00:38:20,728 --> 00:38:22,662
Dodge.

329
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,327
I don't know, Dodge.

330
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:30,236
Well...

331
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:32,735
...not as heavy as they might be...

332
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:34,338
...but very neat...

333
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:37,238
...and nicely made.

334
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:40,073
Ingenious workman,
ain't he, Oliver?

335
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,976
Indeed, sir.

336
00:38:42,182 --> 00:38:44,548
And, Charley, what have you got,
my dear?

337
00:38:44,751 --> 00:38:46,775
-Wipes.
-Wipes?

338
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:53,682
They're very good ones.

339
00:38:53,894 --> 00:38:55,725
Very.

340
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:02,057
You haven't marked them well.

341
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:07,196
The marks should be picked out
with a needle. And we'll--

342
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:09,032
We'll teach Oliver how to do it.

343
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,105
-Shall us, Oliver?
-lf you please, sir.

344
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:14,938
You'd like to make handkerchiefs as
easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you?

345
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:17,706
Very much indeed,
if you'll teach me, sir.

346
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,884
I've never met anyone so green.

347
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:39,832
Now then, boys...

348
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:41,764
...the game.

349
00:39:43,472 --> 00:39:45,598
We'll show Oliver...

350
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:47,741
...how to make
pocket handkerchiefs.

351
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,113
You'd like to play a game,
wouldn't you?

352
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:54,043
Yes, sir.

353
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:23,031
-Got the time, guv?
-It's...

354
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,496
...8:00.

355
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:38,340
-Playing the game, were we, Fagin?
-As is our custom, my dear.

356
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:42,003
-He's new. Who's he?
-Oh, this is Oliver.

357
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:43,774
Oliver...

358
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,751
...these are our very good friends
Bet and Nancy.

359
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,420
See, Dodger,
you wanna learn from him.

360
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:56,694
He's got manners, he has.
A proper gentleman.

361
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,157
We popped in
because we were that cold inside.

362
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:02,928
As is your custom, my dear.

363
00:42:03,203 --> 00:42:05,968
-Charley.
-Come on, Oliver. Join us.

364
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:08,403
Or don't you sit
with the common folk?

365
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:12,140
Now, you wanna be
careful of this lot, Oliver.

366
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:14,869
-They'll have you picking--
-Picking out the marks.

367
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:18,380
Just what we was teaching him,
ain't it, Oliver, my dear?

368
00:42:18,584 --> 00:42:20,347
-Yes, sir.
-"Yes, sir"?

369
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:23,351
You know who you're talking to,
do you?

370
00:42:24,091 --> 00:42:26,490
What's your mother got to say
about you being here?

371
00:42:26,692 --> 00:42:29,125
I haven't got a mother.
I'm an orphan.

372
00:42:29,328 --> 00:42:30,817
You're in the right company, then.

373
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:36,232
Come on, Oliver,
I'll teach you how to play.

374
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:38,527
It's called Spec or Speculation.

375
00:42:38,735 --> 00:42:42,263
Three cards each,
and then the one he turns up...

376
00:42:42,474 --> 00:42:44,442
...is trumps.

377
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:56,545
This is a pleasant life,
ain't it, my dear?

378
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:04,786
-When can I go out, sir?
-Soon. Soon.

379
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:07,823
Let's--

380
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,555
Let's see what you've learned.

381
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,093
-Would you like that?
-Oh, yes, sir.

382
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:17,869
See if you can take this out...

383
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:21,168
...without my feeling it.

384
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:49,732
Is it gone?

385
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:54,673
You're a clever boy, my dear.

386
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:58,003
I never saw a sharper lad.

387
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,179
Here's a shilling for you.

388
00:44:06,884 --> 00:44:09,581
Make the Dodger and Charley
your models.

389
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:11,312
Especially the Dodger, my dear.

390
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:15,014
He'll be a great man himself,
make you one too.

391
00:44:15,226 --> 00:44:16,921
You go on this way...

392
00:44:17,129 --> 00:44:19,962
...you'll be the greatest man
of the time.

393
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,124
Thank you very much, sir.

394
00:44:32,909 --> 00:44:36,572
Lovely white apples.
Get your lovely apples.

395
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:42,777
Biggest cabbages in town.
Come on.

396
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:46,955
You mean that one
with the wide rim?

397
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:49,585
Too expensive.

398
00:45:39,105 --> 00:45:41,232
Thief! Your handkerchief, sir.

399
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,738
Stop, thief!

400
00:45:47,113 --> 00:45:48,307
Stop!

401
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:50,141
Thief!

402
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:53,150
-You're a thief!
-Get him!

403
00:45:53,953 --> 00:45:55,853
-Stop him!
-Stop that boy!

404
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,682
Thief!

405
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,589
Stop, thief!

406
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,593
Thief!

407
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,657
Stop him!

408
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,227
Stop him!

409
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,500
Mind out.

410
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,732
Stop, thief!

411
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:22,510
There, over there.

412
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,875
That way!

413
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:28,982
-Stop, thief! Stop!
-Thief!

414
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:47,565
-What's your name, boy?
-Give him some air.

415
00:46:48,403 --> 00:46:49,733
He's scared to death.

416
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:53,135
-Where's the gentleman?
-Here's the gentleman now.

417
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:55,366
-ls this the boy, sir?
-Yes, I'm afraid it is.

418
00:46:55,575 --> 00:46:58,101
That's a good one.
Did you hear him, "afraid it is"?

419
00:46:58,313 --> 00:47:01,612
-Poor fellow's hurt himself.
-Yeah, I did that, sir.

420
00:47:01,816 --> 00:47:05,548
Hurt me knuckle against his mouth.
But I stopped him.

421
00:47:05,753 --> 00:47:08,688
-Get up!
-lt wasn't me, sir. It wasn't me.

422
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:11,322
Of course it wasn't. It never is.

423
00:47:11,525 --> 00:47:13,186
-Now get up.
-Don't hurt him.

424
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:16,658
Oh, no, sir, I won't hurt him.

425
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:20,834
This way, gentlemen.

426
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,425
This way, gentlemen.

427
00:47:24,435 --> 00:47:27,429
-What's next?
-That is my name and address, sir.

428
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:30,108
Officer, who is this fellow?

429
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,210
-My name is Brownlow.
-Hold your tongue.

430
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:34,811
Officer, what's this fellow
charged with?

431
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:37,139
Oh, no, no. He's not charged,
Your Worship.

432
00:47:37,348 --> 00:47:39,146
He appears against the boy.

433
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,942
-Swear him.
-Before I am sworn...

434
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:43,712
-...I must beg to say one word.
-Hold your tongue, sir.

435
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,912
-I will not, sir!
-Hold your tongue this instant.

436
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:49,491
You're an insolent,
impertinent fellow.

437
00:47:49,695 --> 00:47:51,957
-How dare you bully a magistrate.
-What?

438
00:47:52,163 --> 00:47:55,654
Swear this person.
I'll not hear another word. Swear him.

439
00:47:55,866 --> 00:47:59,233
"l do solemnly swear to tell
the whole truth, so help me God."

440
00:47:59,436 --> 00:48:02,269
-What's the charge against the boy?
-I was at a bookstore when--

441
00:48:02,472 --> 00:48:04,497
Hold your tongue!
Where's the policeman?

442
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:06,971
Policeman, what is this?
Are there any witnesses?

443
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,474
-None, Your Worship.
-The boy is ill.

444
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:12,272
Oh, yes, I daresay.

445
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:15,575
Come along, you vagabond.
None of your tricks here.

446
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:17,514
What's your name?

447
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,746
What's your name,
you hardened scoundrel?

448
00:48:20,956 --> 00:48:24,050
-Officer, what's his name?
-What's your name, boy?

449
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,992
Some water. Some water.

450
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,493
He says his name is Sam Waters,
Your Worship.

451
00:48:29,697 --> 00:48:31,392
-Where does he live?
-Where do you live?

452
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,898
-Anywhere he can, Your Worship.
-Stuff and nonsense.

453
00:48:35,102 --> 00:48:36,662
Don't try to make a fool out of me.

454
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,863
No, I think he really is ill,
Your Worship.

455
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:41,940
I know better,
or my name's not Fang.

456
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:44,270
Stand away, officer. He's shamming.

457
00:48:45,346 --> 00:48:46,903
He stands committed
for three months.

458
00:48:47,114 --> 00:48:48,979
Hard labor, of course.
Clear the office.

459
00:48:49,183 --> 00:48:51,481
Stop. Stop, stop!
Don't take him away.

460
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:54,585
What is this? Who is this?
Turn this man out.

461
00:48:54,787 --> 00:48:58,985
-Clear the office.
-I will not be turned out! I will speak!

462
00:48:59,194 --> 00:49:01,252
I saw it all. I own the bookshop.

463
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:04,160
-I demand to be heard.
-What have you got to say?

464
00:49:04,362 --> 00:49:07,298
-lt was not this boy.
-Not this boy? Who was it, then?

465
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,491
The robbery was committed by
two others while the man was reading.

466
00:49:10,702 --> 00:49:13,967
I saw it done. I saw that this boy
was perfectly amazed by it.

467
00:49:14,172 --> 00:49:15,469
Why didn't you come before?

468
00:49:16,106 --> 00:49:19,200
-I hadn't a soul to mind the shop.
-Reading, you say?

469
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,003
A book, I suppose.

470
00:49:21,479 --> 00:49:23,209
Yes, the very one
he has in his hand.

471
00:49:24,315 --> 00:49:26,216
Oh, dear me, I forgot all about it.

472
00:49:26,418 --> 00:49:27,941
Well, you're a nice one.

473
00:49:28,153 --> 00:49:31,713
To prefer a charge
against an innocent boy.

474
00:49:32,156 --> 00:49:34,954
I consider, sir,
that you've obtained that book...

475
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:38,150
...under very suspicious
and disreputable circumstances.

476
00:49:38,362 --> 00:49:39,555
-Damn me!
-Bookseller...

477
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:41,730
...do you want to press charges
against him?

478
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:43,364
-Certainly not.
-Well...

479
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,001
...think yourself fortunate...

480
00:49:46,202 --> 00:49:48,501
...that the owner of the book
declines to prosecute.

481
00:49:48,805 --> 00:49:49,965
The boy is discharged.

482
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:51,366
-Clear the office.
-Damn me.

483
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:53,906
Clear the office!
Clear the office!

484
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,101
Next case.

485
00:49:56,745 --> 00:50:00,237
Come on. Move along, sir, please.
Just move along, sir.

486
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:01,973
There's a good gentleman, sir.

487
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,743
Hold on, Harry. I'll give you a hand.

488
00:50:04,953 --> 00:50:07,820
Mind that step.
Just mind that step there.

489
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:11,522
Make way for the law, sir.

490
00:50:12,595 --> 00:50:16,154
-Careful. Careful with him.
-He seems very young too.

491
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:18,960
Call a coach, pray.

492
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:22,135
-Yeah, right away, sir.
-I'm sorry.

493
00:50:23,638 --> 00:50:25,538
Poor boy.

494
00:50:30,077 --> 00:50:32,739
-Mind yourself, madam.
-Thank you, sir.

495
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:35,680
-Got one, sir.
-Thank you, officer.

496
00:50:36,316 --> 00:50:37,874
Let me, sir.

497
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:39,779
There we go.

498
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:44,282
-Will you drop me off, sir?
-Of course.

499
00:50:45,391 --> 00:50:46,586
All right.

500
00:50:46,792 --> 00:50:49,283
If you could just take his head, sir.

501
00:50:50,496 --> 00:50:53,362
-Where to, sir?
-Pentonville.

502
00:50:53,565 --> 00:50:55,261
-Pentonville.
-Yes.

503
00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:57,269
Answer me! Where is he?

504
00:50:57,269 --> 00:50:57,894
Answer me! Where is he?

505
00:50:58,102 --> 00:51:00,628
What's become of the boy?
Speak out, or I'll throttle you!

506
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:03,864
The traps have got him!
Let go of me, will you?!

507
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:13,009
Bullseye!

508
00:51:13,216 --> 00:51:16,617
Who pitched this here at me?
Who done it?

509
00:51:18,588 --> 00:51:22,117
Bullseye.
Come in, you sneaking warmint.

510
00:51:22,326 --> 00:51:24,987
What you stopping outside for?

511
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:27,723
Lay down.

512
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:33,226
What you up to, Fagin?
Ill-treating the boys again?

513
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:37,335
A wonder they don't murder you.
I would, if I was them.

514
00:51:37,539 --> 00:51:41,270
Don't speak so loud.
You seem out of sorts, Bill.

515
00:51:41,477 --> 00:51:44,002
Give us a drink.
And mind you don't poison it.

516
00:51:44,213 --> 00:51:45,941
Charley.

517
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:48,542
Good stuff, Bill.

518
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,451
So, Dodger...

519
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:54,452
-...what's it all about?
-A new boy.

520
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:56,749
Come out with us
afore he was rightly up to it.

521
00:51:57,125 --> 00:52:00,389
-Got nabbed by the traps.
-You see, Bill...

522
00:52:00,595 --> 00:52:05,622
...I'm afraid he may say something
which will get us into trouble.

523
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:09,000
You were blowed upon, Fagin.

524
00:52:09,204 --> 00:52:10,398
And about time.

525
00:52:10,604 --> 00:52:13,539
And I'm afraid, you see, Bill,
that if the game was up with us...

526
00:52:13,742 --> 00:52:18,370
...it would come out rather worse
for you than it would for me, my dear.

527
00:52:19,213 --> 00:52:20,509
There's only one thing for it.

528
00:52:20,713 --> 00:52:24,113
Somebody's gotta find out at the office
what's being done to him.

529
00:52:24,317 --> 00:52:26,284
Somebody's gotta
get hold of him somehow.

530
00:52:26,486 --> 00:52:29,649
I ain't going near no police office.
Not for nobody, nohow.

531
00:52:29,988 --> 00:52:32,857
I have it, the very thing.
Bet will go.

532
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,619
-Won't you, my dear?
-I'm blessed if I will.

533
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:37,590
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?

534
00:52:37,796 --> 00:52:40,856
It won't do. There's no use
in trying it on, Fagin.

535
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:42,829
-What do you mean by that?
-What I say.

536
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,934
Why, you're just
the very person for it.

537
00:52:45,136 --> 00:52:46,967
Nobody about here
knows anything about you.

538
00:52:47,172 --> 00:52:49,765
And as I don't want them to neither.

539
00:52:49,975 --> 00:52:52,169
It's rather more "no" than "yes"
with me, Bill.

540
00:52:52,376 --> 00:52:54,435
-She'll go, Fagin.
-No, she won't, Fagin.

541
00:52:54,646 --> 00:52:56,636
Yes, she will, Fagin.

542
00:53:07,524 --> 00:53:10,925
-Can I help you, miss?
-I'm looking for my little brother.

543
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:14,152
-Now, who would he be?
-A lovely little boy.

544
00:53:14,362 --> 00:53:17,595
Lovely manners.
Gentle as falling snow.

545
00:53:18,601 --> 00:53:20,465
We don't get many of those.

546
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:23,297
I think you'll be wanting
Mr. Fang's court.

547
00:53:29,745 --> 00:53:32,977
George, this here young lady
is looking for her brother.

548
00:53:33,182 --> 00:53:35,207
The one that fainted
and got away with it.

549
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:37,715
Oh, yeah.
Gentleman took him away.

550
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,048
What gentleman? Gracious heavens,
what gentleman?

551
00:53:41,256 --> 00:53:43,850
Well, lives in Pentonville, I believe.

552
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:46,357
Oh, my God.

553
00:53:46,895 --> 00:53:48,953
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

554
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:51,563
His card's here somewhere.

555
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,061
Here we are.

556
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:03,068
Thank you, sir.

557
00:55:02,631 --> 00:55:04,362
Mr. Brownlow.

558
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,660
Mr. Brownlow.

559
00:55:34,528 --> 00:55:36,188
There's something in him...

560
00:55:36,397 --> 00:55:39,298
...that touched my heart,
Mrs. Bedwin.

561
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,525
Can't explain it.

562
00:55:41,734 --> 00:55:44,499
I feel the same, sir.

563
00:55:44,704 --> 00:55:46,729
Who is he? What is he?

564
00:55:46,939 --> 00:55:48,703
You know nothing of him.

565
00:55:48,908 --> 00:55:51,034
He had a fever. What of that?

566
00:55:51,477 --> 00:55:53,967
Bad people have fevers sometimes.

567
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:56,978
I knew a man in Jamaica who was
hanged for murdering his master.

568
00:55:57,182 --> 00:55:59,377
He had a fever six times.

569
00:55:59,718 --> 00:56:02,745
-I know there is goodness in him.
-How do you know it?

570
00:56:02,955 --> 00:56:04,480
Goodness and innocence.

571
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,514
-I knew it the first moment I saw him.
-He'll deceive you.

572
00:56:07,726 --> 00:56:09,659
Let you down
at the first opportunity...

573
00:56:09,862 --> 00:56:12,523
...Iike all your other
good and innocent causes.

574
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:17,258
If that boy's good and innocent,
I'll eat my own head, sir.

575
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,340
How do you feel, my dear?

576
00:56:28,545 --> 00:56:30,241
Very happy, sir.

577
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:34,406
-And very grateful to you indeed, sir.
-Good boy.

578
00:56:35,451 --> 00:56:39,149
Have you given him any nourishment,
Bedwin? Any slops?

579
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:42,256
Not slops, sir. Broth.

580
00:56:42,891 --> 00:56:44,416
A couple of glasses of port wine...

581
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:47,187
...would have done him
a great deal more good.

582
00:56:47,396 --> 00:56:49,457
Wouldn't they, Sam?

583
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:51,634
My name is Oliver, sir.

584
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:53,665
Oliver?

585
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:57,899
-Oliver what? Oliver Waters?
-No, sir. Twist. Oliver Twist.

586
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:01,538
Why did you tell the magistrate
your name was Waters?

587
00:57:01,744 --> 00:57:03,608
I never told him so, sir.

588
00:57:04,512 --> 00:57:07,446
-You did not?
-No, sir.

589
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,948
-You're not angry with me, are you?
-No, no.

590
00:57:14,087 --> 00:57:15,646
Queer name.

591
00:57:15,857 --> 00:57:17,084
Oliver Twist.

592
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,419
There are a great many books,
are there not, my boy?

593
00:57:22,628 --> 00:57:24,823
A great number, sir.

594
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:27,262
Never saw so many.

595
00:57:29,702 --> 00:57:31,965
How would you like
to grow up a clever man...

596
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:34,139
...and write books?

597
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,865
I think I'd rather read them, sir.

598
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:39,805
Wouldn't you like to be
a book writer?

599
00:57:41,013 --> 00:57:44,574
I think it'd be a better thing
to be a bookseller, sir.

600
00:57:46,651 --> 00:57:50,143
You have said a very good thing.

601
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:51,816
Well, well.

602
00:57:52,023 --> 00:57:55,423
We won't make an author of you while
there's an honest trade to be learned...

603
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:57,787
...or brickmaking to turn to.

604
00:57:57,994 --> 00:58:01,293
-Are you going to send me away, sir?
-No, my dear child.

605
00:58:01,499 --> 00:58:04,228
You need not be afraid
that I am going to desert you...

606
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:06,903
-...unless you give me cause.
-I never, never will, sir.

607
00:58:07,103 --> 00:58:08,297
I hope not...

608
00:58:08,505 --> 00:58:11,371
...because I feel strongly disposed
to trust you.

609
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:12,836
Thank you, sir.

610
00:58:22,352 --> 00:58:24,513
I'm pleased
I won't have to wear those again.

611
00:58:24,722 --> 00:58:26,451
So are we all, my dear.

612
00:58:28,891 --> 00:58:30,621
There.

613
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:29,275
Hello.

614
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,141
What's that?

615
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:33,215
This is young Oliver Twist.

616
00:59:33,418 --> 00:59:35,079
The bookseller's boy
brought a package.

617
00:59:35,287 --> 00:59:38,778
Oh, stop him, Oliver.
There's some books to go back.

618
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:42,083
-ls that the boy who had the fever?
-That's the boy.

619
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:59,475
Mind out!

620
01:00:09,453 --> 01:00:13,149
-No sign of him, sir.
-Oh, dear, I'm very sorry for that.

621
01:00:13,355 --> 01:00:15,789
I particularly wished some books
to be returned tonight.

622
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:19,687
Why not send Oliver with them?
He'll be sure to deliver them safely.

623
01:00:19,894 --> 01:00:21,328
Yes, do let me take them.

624
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,657
If you please, sir.
I'll run all the way.

625
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:34,674
You shall go, my dear.

626
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:36,900
Ask Mrs. Bedwin
to show you the way.

627
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:40,739
-And, Oliver....
-Yes, sir?

628
01:00:40,947 --> 01:00:43,782
Give the bookseller this.

629
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:49,280
The money I owe him.

630
01:00:55,828 --> 01:00:57,591
I won't be long, sir.

631
01:00:59,231 --> 01:01:03,190
-How long do you think it'll take him?
-You really expect him to come back?

632
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:07,632
-You don't?
-With a ¡ê5 note in his pocket?

633
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,501
No, I do not.

634
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:12,770
If ever that boy
returns to this house...

635
01:01:12,978 --> 01:01:15,003
...I'll eat my own head, sir.

636
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:17,641
And yours.

637
01:01:34,631 --> 01:01:36,565
Oh, my little brother!

638
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:39,829
-I don't believe my eyes.
-Let me go. Help!

639
01:01:40,036 --> 01:01:43,905
-It's a miracle. Oh, I've found him.
-Please let me go.

640
01:01:44,107 --> 01:01:46,871
-Oh, Oliver. Oliver.
-Nancy.

641
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:50,409
You're such a naughty boy to make me
suffer such distress on your account.

642
01:01:50,612 --> 01:01:52,705
-Let go of me!
-What's the matter, ma'am?

643
01:01:52,915 --> 01:01:54,646
He ran away from his parents.

644
01:01:54,851 --> 01:01:57,115
-Get off me!
-Hard-working, respectable people...

645
01:01:57,319 --> 01:01:59,880
...and joined a set of thieves
and bad characters.

646
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:01,386
Broke his mother's heart.

647
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,058
Young wretch.
Go home, you little brute.

648
01:02:04,259 --> 01:02:05,725
I haven't got any parents.

649
01:02:05,928 --> 01:02:07,691
I'm an orphan.
I live in Pentonville.

650
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:10,090
Oh, only hear him,
how he braves it out.

651
01:02:10,298 --> 01:02:12,528
-What? Young Oliver.
-It's true.

652
01:02:14,534 --> 01:02:16,526
You come home
to your poor mother.

653
01:02:16,736 --> 01:02:19,797
I don't belong to them!
I don't know them! Help! Help!

654
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:21,200
"Help, help"?

655
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:24,674
I'll give you "help, help,"
you little wretch!

656
01:02:24,879 --> 01:02:26,437
And these books.

657
01:02:26,647 --> 01:02:29,341
Have you been a-stealing them,
have you, eh?

658
01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:32,984
-You little villain.
-That's right. You give it to him.

659
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:36,416
-Only way to bring him to his senses.
-I will, missus.

660
01:02:36,623 --> 01:02:38,385
And you come with me,
you little wretch.

661
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,286
It'll do him good.

662
01:02:40,491 --> 01:02:42,961
-Who is this man? Help!
-Bullseye, mind him, boy.

663
01:02:43,162 --> 01:02:45,629
-Mind him.
-Help! Help!

664
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:49,065
Look at him, Fagin.

665
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,462
Hold me, somebody.

666
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:54,229
Hold me, somebody,
while I laugh it out.

667
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,531
Look at his togs, Fagin.

668
01:02:56,741 --> 01:02:59,368
Delighted to see you
looking so well, my dear.

669
01:02:59,577 --> 01:03:02,204
Why didn't you write, my dear,
and say you was coming?

670
01:03:02,413 --> 01:03:05,541
We'd have got something warm
for supper.

671
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:08,445
Hello, Fagin. What's that?
That's mine, Fagin.

672
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:11,314
Oh, no, my dear. Mine, Bill, mine.
You shall have the books.

673
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:14,183
If that ain't mine and Nancy's,
I'll take the boy back again.

674
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,652
Come on, hand over, will you?

675
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,984
This is hardly fair, Bill.
Hardly fair, Nancy.

676
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:21,596
Fair or not fair,
hand over, I tell you.

677
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,358
Give it here, you avaricious
old skeleton. Give it here!

678
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,766
That's for our share of the trouble,
and not half enough neither.

679
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:32,642
You may keep the books if you're fond
of reading. If you ain't, sell them.

680
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:36,901
They're very pretty.
Beautiful writing, isn't it, Oliver?

681
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:40,104
Send them back.
They belong to Mr. Brownlow.

682
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,147
Send them back.
The books and the money.

683
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,079
He'll think I stole them.

684
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,083
-Please send them back.
-The boy's right.

685
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:49,848
You're right, Oliver. You're right.
They will think you've stolen them.

686
01:03:51,258 --> 01:03:53,750
It couldn't have happened better
if we'd chosen our time.

687
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:55,863
Help! Help! Police!

688
01:03:56,064 --> 01:03:58,362
Fetch the police! The police!

689
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:01,658
Keep back the dog, Bill.
He'll tear the boy to pieces.

690
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:04,770
-Serve him right.
-Help! Fetch the police!

691
01:04:05,772 --> 01:04:06,966
Fetch the police!

692
01:04:07,174 --> 01:04:09,471
Step aside, or I'll split
your head against the wall.

693
01:04:09,676 --> 01:04:10,769
I don't care.

694
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:14,469
That child shan't be torn down
by the dog unless you kill me first.

695
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:19,215
Bullseye. Here. Bullseye!

696
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:28,258
Dodger!

697
01:04:28,793 --> 01:04:31,091
Get after him!

698
01:04:33,998 --> 01:04:37,126
Take your hands off me!

699
01:05:08,265 --> 01:05:11,165
So you wanted to get away,
my dear, did you?

700
01:05:11,368 --> 01:05:13,631
Wanted to call for the police,
did you?

701
01:05:13,837 --> 01:05:16,567
We'll soon cure you of that.

702
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:21,007
I won't stand by
and see this done, Fagin.

703
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,144
You got the boy.
What more do you want?

704
01:05:23,344 --> 01:05:26,405
Keep quiet, Nancy, or I'll quieten you
for a good long time to come.

705
01:05:26,615 --> 01:05:28,583
Let him be. Let him be!

706
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:30,979
You're a fine one for the boy
to make a friend of.

707
01:05:31,185 --> 01:05:33,210
God Almighty help me, I am.

708
01:05:33,421 --> 01:05:36,857
He's a thief, a liar, a devil,
all that's bad from this night forth.

709
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,549
Ain't that enough for the old wretch
without blows?

710
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,661
Come, come, we must have
civil words. Civil words.

711
01:05:42,863 --> 01:05:46,161
Civil words?
Civil words, you old villain!

712
01:05:46,366 --> 01:05:49,200
I thieved for you when I was a child
not half as old as this.

713
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,870
It's your living.

714
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:54,269
Yes, and you're the wretch
that drove me to it...

715
01:05:54,474 --> 01:05:58,637
...and who will keep me at it,
day and night, till I die!

716
01:06:01,347 --> 01:06:05,113
Dodger, Charley,
put Oliver to bed.

717
01:06:05,317 --> 01:06:07,945
Best to take them clothes off.
They're too good to sleep in.

718
01:06:08,153 --> 01:06:11,589
Charley's right. This here suit cost
more than 4 pence ha'penny.

719
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:15,056
I never felt such lovely stuff.
Have you, Dodger?

720
01:06:15,528 --> 01:06:17,391
Not me. But I'm willing to lay odds...

721
01:06:17,596 --> 01:06:21,155
...this is the same stuff
the queen wears on Sundays.

722
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:25,225
Quick, get him.

723
01:06:25,437 --> 01:06:27,370
Take it off.

724
01:06:30,106 --> 01:06:31,300
Lift him up.

725
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:33,771
Up he goes.

726
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:38,441
Get them shoes off.

727
01:07:14,483 --> 01:07:16,848
Little something for your luncheon,
my dear?

728
01:07:34,033 --> 01:07:35,795
Shall we have a little chat?

729
01:07:36,903 --> 01:07:38,699
Oliver?

730
01:07:38,937 --> 01:07:40,700
Shall us?

731
01:07:43,341 --> 01:07:45,833
I expect you'd welcome...

732
01:07:46,044 --> 01:07:50,844
...the sound of a human voice again,
eh, my dear?

733
01:07:55,954 --> 01:07:57,750
Do you know...

734
01:07:58,289 --> 01:08:02,623
...what I consider the greatest sin
in the world, my dear?

735
01:08:03,593 --> 01:08:06,255
Ingratitude.

736
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:10,127
And that's what you're guilty of...

737
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:12,393
...ingratitude.

738
01:08:12,637 --> 01:08:15,970
We took you in, we cherished you. If
we hadn't, you'd have died of hunger.

739
01:08:16,174 --> 01:08:17,835
How do you repay us?
You run away...

740
01:08:18,042 --> 01:08:23,378
...you cry out for the police, you
cause us great anxiety and expense.

741
01:08:27,652 --> 01:08:30,517
There was a lad once, just like you,
and I was a father to him.

742
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,187
He ran away, like you.
He indeed went to the police.

743
01:08:33,391 --> 01:08:36,382
And can you guess
how he ended up?

744
01:08:39,195 --> 01:08:41,663
They hanged him...

745
01:08:41,865 --> 01:08:44,389
...at the Old Bailey.

746
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:50,004
Certain evidence was made available,
not all of it precisely true...

747
01:08:50,872 --> 01:08:54,831
...but all of it necessary to provide
for my own safety...

748
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:56,806
...and that of my friends.

749
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:59,775
Yeah. Poor boy.

750
01:09:00,381 --> 01:09:02,349
Hanged.

751
01:09:02,951 --> 01:09:05,248
It's a terrible thing, hanging, Oliver.

752
01:09:05,453 --> 01:09:07,580
Dawn, the gallows...

753
01:09:07,788 --> 01:09:10,085
...the rope, the noose.

754
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:12,588
You don't always have
to be guilty, you see, Oliver.

755
01:09:12,793 --> 01:09:14,453
They hang you for anything
these days.

756
01:09:14,661 --> 01:09:17,595
That's because they're
so very fond of hanging.

757
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:29,506
But if you do as you're told...

758
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:33,068
...we'll be very good friends yet.

759
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:45,817
You must feel free
to walk about now, Oliver.

760
01:09:47,658 --> 01:09:49,149
Yes, feel free.

761
01:09:56,735 --> 01:09:59,635
-Here, Oliver.
-Yes?

762
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:02,934
I'd like you to assist me
in my toilet straightaway.

763
01:10:04,008 --> 01:10:08,001
-Will you do that for me, my man?
-All right. I'll be glad to have company.

764
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:12,649
There's a good fellow. You may start
by japanning my trotter-cases.

765
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:15,318
In plain English, clean my boots.

766
01:10:19,722 --> 01:10:21,655
What a pity he ain't a prig.

767
01:10:21,858 --> 01:10:24,257
He don't know what's good for him.

768
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,153
I suppose you don't know
what a prig is.

769
01:10:26,361 --> 01:10:28,590
Yes, I do. It's a....

770
01:10:28,797 --> 01:10:31,425
It's a thief.

771
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:33,124
You're one, aren't you?

772
01:10:33,336 --> 01:10:36,064
Yes, I am. And so we all are.
Down to the dog...

773
01:10:36,272 --> 01:10:38,034
...and he's the downiest one
of the lot.

774
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,207
And the least given to peaching.

775
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:42,433
He wouldn't so much as bark
in a witness box...

776
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:47,410
-...for fear of committing himself.
-He's an out-and-out Christian, he is.

777
01:10:47,614 --> 01:10:50,139
Why don't you put yourself
under Fagin, Oliver?

778
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,180
You'll make a fortune out of hand.

779
01:10:52,386 --> 01:10:56,220
Like your old gentleman
in Pentonville. Big house, that.

780
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:59,653
I had a peep at it, I did.
Nice inside, was it?

781
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:04,262
Yes. And I slept in a proper bed.
In my own room.

782
01:11:04,463 --> 01:11:08,058
-Good stuff on the walls, eh?
-Yes. Indeed.

783
01:11:08,267 --> 01:11:09,734
Put yourself under Fagin...

784
01:11:09,935 --> 01:11:13,392
...and you'll be able to retire
to a property just like that.

785
01:11:13,605 --> 01:11:15,572
And do the genteel.

786
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,833
No, he's scared
he'll come to be scragged.

787
01:11:18,043 --> 01:11:19,601
I don't know what that means.

788
01:11:24,082 --> 01:11:26,710
If you don't take pocket handkerchiefs
and watches, Nolly...

789
01:11:27,185 --> 01:11:30,245
...some other cove will. You have
the same right to them as they have.

790
01:11:30,455 --> 01:11:33,185
To be sure. To be sure.

791
01:11:33,392 --> 01:11:36,121
It all lies in a nutshell, my dear,
in a nutshell.

792
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:37,624
Take the Dodger's word for it.

793
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:40,764
He understands the catechism
of his trade.

794
01:11:52,242 --> 01:11:54,106
Cabby?

795
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:17,054
-I've come from Bill.
-For what?

796
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:20,757
-For no harm.
-I don't believe it.

797
01:12:21,936 --> 01:12:25,201
If I could help you, I would,
but I've not the power.

798
01:12:25,405 --> 01:12:28,273
Now, I've promised him
you'll be good and silent.

799
01:12:28,476 --> 01:12:31,411
If you're not, you'll only do
yourself harm.

800
01:12:31,612 --> 01:12:33,581
And me too.

801
01:12:43,223 --> 01:12:45,053
Did he come quiet?

802
01:12:45,258 --> 01:12:46,249
Like a lamb.

803
01:12:49,462 --> 01:12:51,292
Sit down.

804
01:12:56,034 --> 01:12:59,129
And let me read you a lecture.

805
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:06,773
You know what this is?

806
01:13:08,678 --> 01:13:11,805
-Yes.
-Well, then.

807
01:13:15,585 --> 01:13:17,850
This is powder.

808
01:13:25,461 --> 01:13:26,654
That here's a bullet.

809
01:13:30,266 --> 01:13:33,531
And this is a little bit
of an old hat...

810
01:13:33,802 --> 01:13:35,794
...for wadding.

811
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:46,543
-Now it's loaded.
-Yes, I can see it is, sir.

812
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:49,582
If you speak a word
when you're out of doors with me...

813
01:13:49,785 --> 01:13:51,719
...unless I speak to you...

814
01:13:51,919 --> 01:13:55,116
...this loading will go in your head
without notice.

815
01:13:55,322 --> 01:13:59,019
So if you do make up your mind
to speak without leave...

816
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,818
...says your prayers first.

817
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:04,892
The short and long of what you mean
is that if you're crossed by him...

818
01:14:05,099 --> 01:14:07,191
...you'll prevent him
from telling tales after...

819
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,334
...by shooting him through the head.

820
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,901
And you'll take your chance
of swinging for it.

821
01:14:12,106 --> 01:14:15,665
That's it. Women always put things
in the fewest words.

822
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,967
Supper, Nancy.

823
01:14:18,176 --> 01:14:20,338
And then a snooze afore starting.

824
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,833
My pal Bill.

825
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:54,704
The door's open, come in.

826
01:14:56,813 --> 01:14:59,339
Don't make such a row.

827
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:04,153
Show us a glim, Toby.

828
01:15:04,353 --> 01:15:07,583
Barney, a glim.
Show the gentleman in.

829
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:12,554
Barney?
Wake up first, if convenient.

830
01:15:23,871 --> 01:15:26,636
Mr. Sykes. Come in, sir, come in.

831
01:15:45,392 --> 01:15:48,258
Bill, my boy. Glad to see you.

832
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:51,897
Who's...?

833
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:53,997
-Who's this?
-Only the boy.

834
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:57,464
-One of Mr. Fagin's lads?
-Yeah. It's time.

835
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:59,364
Right.

836
01:16:00,707 --> 01:16:02,037
Barkers for me, Barney.

837
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,843
-They're loaded.
-Good.

838
01:16:21,658 --> 01:16:24,685
-The persuaders?
-Got them.

839
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:30,596
Keys, center bits.

840
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,201
Darkies.

841
01:16:47,952 --> 01:16:49,886
Nothing forgotten?

842
01:17:00,729 --> 01:17:02,788
Yeah, it's all quiet.

843
01:17:53,143 --> 01:17:56,203
I can't. I can't.

844
01:17:56,548 --> 01:17:58,243
You will.

845
01:17:58,450 --> 01:17:59,883
It's Mr. Brownlow's house.

846
01:18:29,645 --> 01:18:31,442
Have mercy.
Don't make me steal from him.

847
01:18:31,647 --> 01:18:34,047
-Have mercy on me.
-Come here.

848
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,616
For God's sake, let me run away
and die in the fields.

849
01:18:36,819 --> 01:18:40,185
-I'll never come near London, never.
-Shut it.

850
01:18:40,388 --> 01:18:44,346
Get up. Or I'll strew your brains
on the grass.

851
01:19:24,964 --> 01:19:27,124
I'm putting you through there.

852
01:19:27,332 --> 01:19:30,130
Go to the front door
and unfasten it.

853
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:34,101
I can't, there's a bolt at the top.
I know it, I can't reach it.

854
01:19:34,306 --> 01:19:38,401
-Well, stand on a chair or something.
-Just do it.

855
01:20:34,895 --> 01:20:37,888
To the door.
To the front door, damn you.

856
01:20:40,267 --> 01:20:41,461
Who's there?

857
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,705
Mrs. Bedwin? Is that you?

858
01:21:00,419 --> 01:21:02,011
Come here. Come here.

859
01:21:03,556 --> 01:21:07,458
Save me! Save me!
Save me, for God's sake!

860
01:21:16,133 --> 01:21:17,726
Help!

861
01:21:19,371 --> 01:21:22,168
Help! Police!

862
01:21:31,449 --> 01:21:33,246
Give him here.

863
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:41,156
Oh, damnation, how he bleeds.

864
01:21:41,358 --> 01:21:44,088
-ls he hit bad?
-He's gotta be hit worse.

865
01:21:50,099 --> 01:21:51,623
-Give me a pistol.
-What?

866
01:21:52,669 --> 01:21:55,160
We gotta get rid of him,
or he'll squeal.

867
01:21:55,371 --> 01:21:57,272
We gotta do him in.

868
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,666
Here, here. Down here by the river.

869
01:22:00,876 --> 01:22:03,744
But, Bill! Bill!

870
01:22:06,649 --> 01:22:09,173
-Bill?
-Help!

871
01:22:09,384 --> 01:22:12,181
Help! Help!

872
01:22:13,055 --> 01:22:16,148
-Bill.
-Help!

873
01:22:24,299 --> 01:22:25,890
Snap.

874
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:29,128
Snap.

875
01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:32,331
Snap.

876
01:22:35,141 --> 01:22:36,733
Snap.

877
01:22:39,311 --> 01:22:40,869
Snap.

878
01:22:54,659 --> 01:22:56,593
Well, well.

879
01:22:56,794 --> 01:22:58,352
How are you, Fagey?

880
01:23:00,263 --> 01:23:03,666
Scarce. Scarce!
Where's Bill?

881
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:06,132
-He's-- He's bleeding.
-What happened?

882
01:23:06,337 --> 01:23:08,863
All in good time.

883
01:23:09,074 --> 01:23:12,804
I can't talk business
till I've ate and drank.

884
01:23:19,117 --> 01:23:22,245
Nancy, I said, scarce. Scarce!

885
01:23:22,452 --> 01:23:23,646
Where's Bill?

886
01:23:23,853 --> 01:23:25,913
Well, produce the sustenance,
if you please.

887
01:23:26,123 --> 01:23:27,989
Dodger!

888
01:23:28,191 --> 01:23:29,386
Nancy, scarce!

889
01:23:36,232 --> 01:23:38,757
-The crack failed.
-I smelt that.

890
01:23:38,968 --> 01:23:41,732
For the last time of asking,
where's Bill?

891
01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:45,299
Dodger.

892
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:51,236
Put him to bed,
give him a nip of gin.

893
01:23:58,153 --> 01:24:01,247
The boy was about to blow on us,
Fagey.

894
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:03,717
-He was seen.
-Seen?

895
01:24:03,924 --> 01:24:06,552
He was seen? Who saw him?

896
01:24:06,894 --> 01:24:09,418
Two old ones.
He shouted out.

897
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:11,824
Bill lost his head,
fired his pistol....

898
01:24:12,031 --> 01:24:14,501
-And hit the boy?
-I don't know. There was two shots.

899
01:24:14,702 --> 01:24:17,067
Only one was Bill's.

900
01:24:17,271 --> 01:24:20,727
We made a run for it.
I had ahold of the boy, and Bill fell.

901
01:24:20,941 --> 01:24:22,669
Fell? Was he hurt?

902
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:26,311
No. Last seen, he was swimming
to London.

903
01:24:29,181 --> 01:24:31,149
Bullseye.

904
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:36,549
I told you not to bring a soul here.

905
01:24:36,754 --> 01:24:38,780
Now you've brought the devil.

906
01:24:38,989 --> 01:24:41,356
You said to fetch him.

907
01:24:41,561 --> 01:24:44,323
His fever is that high,
he don't remember nothing.

908
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:48,158
You're not well, are you, Bill?
How do you feel today?

909
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:50,493
I'm as weak as water.

910
01:24:50,702 --> 01:24:52,363
Get us a drink.

911
01:24:53,904 --> 01:24:58,568
-What evil wind has blowed you here?
-No evil wind, my dear.

912
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:02,710
You, Bill, you.
You said we need to speak.

913
01:25:08,352 --> 01:25:10,252
What you done with that boy?
Where is he?

914
01:25:10,454 --> 01:25:12,921
Safe and sound.
The Dodger's minding him.

915
01:25:13,122 --> 01:25:16,717
They're as close as Cain and Abel.

916
01:25:19,929 --> 01:25:22,419
What about the boy, Bill?

917
01:25:24,868 --> 01:25:27,530
We don't want anyone
peaching on us, do we?

918
01:25:27,737 --> 01:25:30,797
And as long as that boy's alive,
we're as good as hung.

919
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:33,530
So, what's to be done?

920
01:25:35,443 --> 01:25:37,377
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

921
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:40,638
-Not till I'm better.
-Then what?

922
01:25:41,483 --> 01:25:44,041
-Then I'll do for him.
-How, Bill? Where?

923
01:25:44,986 --> 01:25:47,979
Outside of London somewhere.
I'll find a river and I'll drown him.

924
01:25:48,189 --> 01:25:50,555
The boy's weak.
Bill, he was wounded.

925
01:25:50,757 --> 01:25:53,192
He can hardly stand, let alone walk.

926
01:25:53,394 --> 01:25:56,419
When he can walk, tell me.
I'll fetch him.

927
01:25:57,831 --> 01:25:59,093
Now, get out of here.

928
01:25:59,833 --> 01:26:01,527
Yes.

929
01:26:02,536 --> 01:26:04,162
Yes.

930
01:26:04,403 --> 01:26:07,395
Bill, you're right.

931
01:26:11,242 --> 01:26:12,506
It's for the best.

932
01:26:17,016 --> 01:26:19,279
I'm burning up.

933
01:26:19,485 --> 01:26:21,076
Give me me physic.
Where's me physic?

934
01:26:23,454 --> 01:26:25,945
You look like a corpse
come back to life again.

935
01:26:26,157 --> 01:26:29,321
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

936
01:26:30,461 --> 01:26:32,190
What do you look at me so hard for?

937
01:26:32,397 --> 01:26:35,561
-What you thinking of?
-Of many things, Bill.

938
01:26:35,768 --> 01:26:37,826
-What odds in that?
-I'll tell you what it is.

939
01:26:38,037 --> 01:26:39,800
If you haven't caught the fever...

940
01:26:40,004 --> 01:26:43,063
...then there's something
more than usual in the wind.

941
01:26:43,274 --> 01:26:45,799
And something dangerous too.

942
01:26:46,843 --> 01:26:49,471
Give me me physic, I say.

943
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:55,140
No, no, no.

944
01:26:55,719 --> 01:26:59,018
There ain't a stauncher-hearted
girl going...

945
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:02,817
...or I'd have cut her throat
three months ago.

946
01:27:04,394 --> 01:27:07,829
She's got a fever coming on.
That's it.

947
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,343
Here. Make you feel better.

948
01:27:39,324 --> 01:27:41,451
Sit aside me.

949
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:47,990
Put on your own face, or I'll alter it
so you won't know it again.

950
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:15,209
-Wait.
-Ma'am.

951
01:29:33,164 --> 01:29:35,632
-Yes?
-Does Mr. Brownlow live here?

952
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:38,963
Who are you? What do you want?
Go around the back.

953
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:41,968
I have information
about Oliver Twist.

954
01:29:46,078 --> 01:29:48,343
Is he all right? Is he safe?

955
01:29:49,515 --> 01:29:53,178
-Where is he?
-I will only talk to Mr. Brownlow.

956
01:29:53,384 --> 01:29:55,875
He's not here.

957
01:29:56,621 --> 01:29:58,452
The boy's innocent, tell him that.

958
01:29:59,624 --> 01:30:02,490
-Where is he?
-Safe.

959
01:30:03,895 --> 01:30:07,262
-But he may not be for long.
-Where is he?

960
01:30:18,909 --> 01:30:20,500
Give Mr. Brownlow a message.

961
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:23,008
Tell him to meet me on Sunday
at midnight...

962
01:30:23,212 --> 01:30:25,442
-...on London Bridge.
-Midnight?

963
01:30:25,647 --> 01:30:27,275
And if I'm not there...

964
01:30:27,483 --> 01:30:31,919
...then tell him to come the next night
and the next. I'll be there. Tell him.

965
01:30:37,592 --> 01:30:41,358
There, my dear,
you look as good as new.

966
01:30:41,863 --> 01:30:45,593
-How do you feel?
-Tired, sir.

967
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,994
Well, yes, yes.

968
01:30:47,201 --> 01:30:50,693
It is long after midnight.
Shortly, you'll sleep a good sleep.

969
01:30:50,905 --> 01:30:52,337
But my meaning was...

970
01:30:52,539 --> 01:30:54,871
...how do you feel
in yourself, Oliver?

971
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:57,339
Better. Thank you, sir.

972
01:30:57,545 --> 01:31:01,538
-But for the ache in my arm.
-Come sit.

973
01:31:04,017 --> 01:31:08,646
I have the very thing for such pains
as yours, my dear.

974
01:31:10,223 --> 01:31:11,485
Undo the bandage.

975
01:31:22,368 --> 01:31:24,996
Oh, my God.

976
01:31:25,672 --> 01:31:28,469
It's a nasty wound.

977
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:33,471
But my magic will do the trick.
You'll see, my dear.

978
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,806
This remedy...

979
01:31:36,014 --> 01:31:37,947
...is older than time. Yes...

980
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:40,448
...my dear, older than time.

981
01:31:40,652 --> 01:31:44,110
It was handed down
from father to son...

982
01:31:44,323 --> 01:31:48,587
...father to son, and comes from...

983
01:31:50,694 --> 01:31:52,992
...who can say where?

984
01:31:55,932 --> 01:31:59,595
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

985
01:31:59,802 --> 01:32:01,929
For your kindness.
I'll always remember it.

986
01:32:02,137 --> 01:32:03,434
Well....

987
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:05,674
Well....

988
01:32:06,877 --> 01:32:08,344
Always.

989
01:32:08,544 --> 01:32:11,137
Yes, always, my dear.

990
01:32:13,549 --> 01:32:16,575
But who knows how long
that will be.

991
01:32:45,044 --> 01:32:47,637
An hour this side of midnight.

992
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,314
Dark and heavy it is too.

993
01:32:50,548 --> 01:32:53,348
Good night for business, this.

994
01:32:53,552 --> 01:32:56,783
What a pity, Bill, my dear,
there's none quite ready to be done.

995
01:32:56,989 --> 01:32:58,650
Yeah, for once, you're right.

996
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:01,559
When will the boy be well enough
to go on his travels?

997
01:33:01,762 --> 01:33:06,221
-Like I say, Bill. In a day or two.
-It's a pity.

998
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:09,764
-For I'm in the humor to.
-Does me good to hear you.

999
01:33:09,968 --> 01:33:13,403
You're like yourself tonight, Bill.
Quite like yourself.

1000
01:33:13,606 --> 01:33:16,871
I don't feel like myself when you lay
that withered claw on my shoulder...

1001
01:33:17,076 --> 01:33:19,236
...so take it away.

1002
01:33:27,785 --> 01:33:29,719
Hello, Nance.

1003
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,013
Where's the girl going to
this time of night?

1004
01:33:32,422 --> 01:33:34,890
-Not far.
-What answer's that?

1005
01:33:35,091 --> 01:33:37,822
-Where you going?
-I say, not far.

1006
01:33:38,028 --> 01:33:40,326
-And I say, where?
-I don't know where.

1007
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:43,523
Then I do, nowhere. Sit down.

1008
01:33:43,733 --> 01:33:47,294
-I'm not well. I want a breath of air.
-Put your head out the window.

1009
01:33:47,503 --> 01:33:50,631
There's not enough there.
I want it in the street.

1010
01:33:54,309 --> 01:33:56,834
Then you won't have it.

1011
01:34:02,117 --> 01:34:06,577
There. Now, stop quietly
where you are, will you?

1012
01:34:11,893 --> 01:34:13,416
Do you know what you're doing?

1013
01:34:14,695 --> 01:34:16,719
Do I know what I'm--?

1014
01:34:16,931 --> 01:34:19,956
I think this girl's lost her senses.
You talking to me in that way?

1015
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:22,191
You'll drive me on
to something desperate.

1016
01:34:22,402 --> 01:34:24,871
Now, let me go, will you?
This minute, this instant.

1017
01:34:25,071 --> 01:34:27,403
-No!
-Tell him to let me go, Fagin.

1018
01:34:28,074 --> 01:34:31,372
It'll be better for him.
Do you hear me?

1019
01:34:32,912 --> 01:34:36,005
Aye, I hear you.

1020
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:40,151
And if I have to listen to you
for half a minute longer...

1021
01:34:40,352 --> 01:34:44,118
...the dog will tear some
of that screaming voice out!

1022
01:34:44,456 --> 01:34:47,254
What's come over you, you jade?
What is it?

1023
01:34:47,459 --> 01:34:49,325
Bill, let me go.

1024
01:34:49,863 --> 01:34:53,764
Let me go.
You don't know what you're doing.

1025
01:34:53,967 --> 01:34:55,194
For only one hour.

1026
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:59,201
Cut my limbs off one by one if I don't
think the girl's stark raving mad.

1027
01:34:59,404 --> 01:35:03,135
-Get up. Get up!
-No.

1028
01:35:10,147 --> 01:35:11,341
Now, stay there!

1029
01:35:14,285 --> 01:35:15,946
What a precious, strange girl that is.

1030
01:35:16,154 --> 01:35:18,179
You may say that, Bill,
you may say that.

1031
01:35:18,389 --> 01:35:20,618
Why did she take it in her head
to go out tonight?

1032
01:35:21,124 --> 01:35:23,921
Obstinacy. Women's obstinacy,
I suppose, my dear.

1033
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,423
I thought I tamed her of that.
But she's as bad as ever.

1034
01:35:30,033 --> 01:35:33,229
I think she's got a touch of my fever
in her blood and it won't come out.

1035
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:34,925
Like enough.

1036
01:35:35,137 --> 01:35:38,129
Well, if she's taken that way again,
I'll let her a little blood.

1037
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:41,308
Without troubling the doctor.

1038
01:35:56,825 --> 01:35:59,622
Why, now she's on the other tack.

1039
01:36:00,994 --> 01:36:02,394
Good night.

1040
01:36:02,596 --> 01:36:07,089
In two days, Bill,
come for the boy.

1041
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:11,094
Light him down.

1042
01:36:11,304 --> 01:36:15,104
It's a pity he should fall and break
his neck without anyone seeing it.

1043
01:36:17,243 --> 01:36:18,609
Show him a light.

1044
01:36:27,988 --> 01:36:31,683
What is it, Nancy dear,
the reason for all this?

1045
01:36:31,891 --> 01:36:34,120
-What do you mean?
-That matter just now.

1046
01:36:34,326 --> 01:36:36,350
We'll speak of this anon.

1047
01:36:36,562 --> 01:36:38,620
You have a friend in me, Nance.

1048
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:41,025
A staunch friend.
You know me of old, Nance.

1049
01:36:41,565 --> 01:36:44,329
I know you well. Good night.

1050
01:36:49,774 --> 01:36:51,172
Dodge...

1051
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:53,240
...pull it in.

1052
01:36:56,446 --> 01:36:59,507
My glass is full already,
can't you see?

1053
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:07,383
Trouble?

1054
01:37:10,961 --> 01:37:12,756
Dodger.

1055
01:37:15,931 --> 01:37:18,628
-Let's find out where old Tom is, eh?
-He's in the Ten Bells.

1056
01:37:18,834 --> 01:37:21,325
Shall we both take him home?

1057
01:37:21,803 --> 01:37:23,235
Honestly...

1058
01:37:23,438 --> 01:37:26,065
...I haven't seen her.

1059
01:37:27,276 --> 01:37:29,005
Something up?

1060
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:33,209
I....

1061
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:40,617
I want you to do a piece of work for me
that requires great care and caution.

1062
01:37:40,922 --> 01:37:43,413
What is it?
I ain't going near no police office.

1063
01:37:43,623 --> 01:37:47,150
-That don't suit me, that don't.
-There's not the smallest danger in it.

1064
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,453
Not the smallest.
I want someone dodged.

1065
01:37:50,663 --> 01:37:53,188
-Who, an old one?
-Young one.

1066
01:37:53,399 --> 01:37:54,660
-Who is she?
-One of us.

1067
01:37:54,868 --> 01:37:56,335
Who?

1068
01:37:56,536 --> 01:37:58,470
Nancy?

1069
01:37:59,973 --> 01:38:02,737
-What's she been up to?
-Not sure she's been up to anything...

1070
01:38:02,943 --> 01:38:06,241
...my dear, that's why
I want her dodged.

1071
01:38:08,248 --> 01:38:11,081
She may want to talk to people
she shouldn't want to talk to.

1072
01:38:11,283 --> 01:38:16,243
I want to know where she goes,
who she sees, what she says.

1073
01:38:18,623 --> 01:38:20,387
Nancy.

1074
01:38:20,593 --> 01:38:23,221
I don't know. She's a good one,
is Nancy.

1075
01:38:23,428 --> 01:38:27,921
A pound, my dear.
One whole pound.

1076
01:39:08,204 --> 01:39:10,171
Mr. Brownlow?

1077
01:39:12,072 --> 01:39:13,768
Yes.

1078
01:39:16,977 --> 01:39:20,071
I'm afraid to speak to you here.
Come away. Follow me.

1079
01:39:34,628 --> 01:39:36,562
This is far enough.

1080
01:39:36,763 --> 01:39:39,755
-Why can't we speak up there?
-I told you, I'm afraid.

1081
01:39:39,967 --> 01:39:42,093
I may be followed.

1082
01:39:46,839 --> 01:39:48,170
I'm here because you told...

1083
01:39:48,373 --> 01:39:51,137
...my housekeeper you have
information concerning Oliver Twist.

1084
01:39:51,343 --> 01:39:53,539
-So I have.
-Tell me.

1085
01:39:55,214 --> 01:39:56,841
He's being held by the devil...

1086
01:39:57,049 --> 01:40:01,543
...and he's handing him over
to another what means to....

1087
01:40:01,754 --> 01:40:04,187
I must know more.
Is it someone close to you?

1088
01:40:05,223 --> 01:40:08,555
-One is. One ain't.
-These men, whoever they are...

1089
01:40:08,759 --> 01:40:11,320
-...must be delivered up by you.
-Never.

1090
01:40:11,529 --> 01:40:16,626
Bad a life as he has led, I've led a bad
life too, and I will not turn upon him.

1091
01:40:17,234 --> 01:40:19,065
The other.

1092
01:40:19,804 --> 01:40:22,968
-Fagin. He has the boy.
-Fagin.

1093
01:40:23,174 --> 01:40:24,572
Find Fagin, you'll find the boy.

1094
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:27,174
-Where is he?
-Spitalfields.

1095
01:40:27,377 --> 01:40:30,437
That's all I'll say.
I've said too much.

1096
01:40:30,847 --> 01:40:32,747
No one must never know
who told you.

1097
01:40:32,948 --> 01:40:35,416
-Promise.
-I promise.

1098
01:40:35,617 --> 01:40:39,747
-Tomorrow I'll go to the police.
-No, you must do it tonight.

1099
01:40:39,954 --> 01:40:41,946
Just say Fagin,
and the traps will know.

1100
01:40:42,157 --> 01:40:45,183
-The traps?
-The police.

1101
01:40:45,394 --> 01:40:48,659
-What can I do to serve you?
-Nothing.

1102
01:40:48,864 --> 01:40:52,162
You can do nothing.
I am past all hope indeed.

1103
01:40:52,368 --> 01:40:54,426
Take this as a reward.

1104
01:40:54,635 --> 01:40:58,001
No, I've not done this for money.

1105
01:40:58,206 --> 01:40:59,605
God bless you.

1106
01:40:59,806 --> 01:41:02,867
Good night. Good night.

1107
01:41:03,076 --> 01:41:06,012
Never-- Never say who told you.

1108
01:41:17,924 --> 01:41:19,118
Look at him.

1109
01:41:20,926 --> 01:41:22,791
What a shame it is. With his face...

1110
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:25,190
...he could pick old ladies' pockets
in church.

1111
01:41:25,398 --> 01:41:28,801
His face could be a fortune to us.

1112
01:41:29,469 --> 01:41:31,493
You changing your mind?

1113
01:41:31,705 --> 01:41:33,297
No.

1114
01:41:33,907 --> 01:41:36,034
No, Bill, it has to be done.

1115
01:41:36,242 --> 01:41:38,142
Fagin! Fagin.

1116
01:41:43,549 --> 01:41:46,813
-What's got into you, Dodger?
-I have to see Fagin alone.

1117
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:48,712
No, no, you can speak
in front of Bill.

1118
01:41:48,921 --> 01:41:52,356
-No, I can't.
-Yes, you can. Speak, Dodger, tell us.

1119
01:41:52,557 --> 01:41:54,683
-Nancy.
-What about Nancy?

1120
01:41:54,893 --> 01:41:57,726
He done a bit of work for me, Bill.
I had him dodge Nancy.

1121
01:41:57,928 --> 01:41:59,519
What do you mean?

1122
01:41:59,731 --> 01:42:01,789
Tell us, Dodger. You followed her?

1123
01:42:01,999 --> 01:42:04,159
Yes. To London Bridge.

1124
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:06,733
And what?
What on London Bridge?

1125
01:42:07,069 --> 01:42:09,094
She met an old one. A gentleman.

1126
01:42:09,305 --> 01:42:11,034
-And....
-And?

1127
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:13,332
Speak, will you?!

1128
01:42:14,177 --> 01:42:17,112
She peached.
She told him Fagin had Oliver.

1129
01:42:17,313 --> 01:42:21,340
And the old man was
to go to the traps. Now, tonight.

1130
01:42:27,389 --> 01:42:29,414
-Let me go. Let me out!
-Bill! Bill! A word--

1131
01:42:29,623 --> 01:42:33,821
-Don't speak to me, it's not safe!
-Hear me speak a word!

1132
01:42:34,161 --> 01:42:36,288
Bill, you won't be....

1133
01:42:37,264 --> 01:42:39,460
You won't be too violent, Bill?

1134
01:42:52,313 --> 01:42:53,678
Flit, boys, flit!

1135
01:42:53,881 --> 01:42:56,679
The traps will be at the door
afore you can say "Spitalfields."

1136
01:42:56,884 --> 01:42:58,043
Flit! Flit! Flit!

1137
01:42:58,252 --> 01:42:59,809
Flit!

1138
01:43:00,254 --> 01:43:01,983
Flit!

1139
01:43:02,223 --> 01:43:03,883
Flit!

1140
01:43:04,091 --> 01:43:05,853
Flit!

1141
01:43:06,994 --> 01:43:08,688
Flit!

1142
01:43:11,130 --> 01:43:12,791
Flit!

1143
01:43:40,057 --> 01:43:41,580
Come on.

1144
01:44:07,248 --> 01:44:09,443
Oh, it's you.

1145
01:44:12,923 --> 01:44:14,514
Bill?

1146
01:44:14,722 --> 01:44:16,622
What's the matter?

1147
01:44:24,831 --> 01:44:27,459
Bill, why do you look like that at me?

1148
01:44:29,169 --> 01:44:31,228
There's enough light
for what I've gotta do.

1149
01:44:31,438 --> 01:44:33,929
What--? What have I done?

1150
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:37,544
-Speak to me.
-You know.

1151
01:44:37,745 --> 01:44:40,144
You was watched tonight.

1152
01:44:40,547 --> 01:44:43,243
Every word you said was heard.

1153
01:44:45,419 --> 01:44:47,944
I-- I never said your name, Bill.

1154
01:44:48,154 --> 01:44:49,417
Never.

1155
01:44:49,623 --> 01:44:50,816
Never.

1156
01:44:51,023 --> 01:44:53,048
Bill. Bill. Bill!

1157
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:57,091
Oh, God.
Oh, God, have mercy!

1158
01:45:21,851 --> 01:45:23,753
Nance?

1159
01:45:28,425 --> 01:45:30,222
Nance?

1160
01:45:51,813 --> 01:45:53,838
I haven't done nothing.

1161
01:45:54,049 --> 01:45:56,279
Go on, be off with you.

1162
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:21,174
Hello, Fagey.

1163
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:23,604
Hello, lads.

1164
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:27,511
What's the news, Toby?
What's the news?

1165
01:46:27,713 --> 01:46:30,774
I have it here, Fagin.
It's all in The Chronicle.

1166
01:46:30,983 --> 01:46:34,351
You're in it. Bill's in it.
Oliver's in it.

1167
01:46:34,555 --> 01:46:35,749
The Chronicle?

1168
01:46:36,156 --> 01:46:39,489
Fancy that. You're famous, Fagin.

1169
01:46:39,692 --> 01:46:40,716
Read it.

1170
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:43,157
"More information has reached
your correspondent...

1171
01:46:43,362 --> 01:46:46,194
...concerning the foul
and bestial murder...

1172
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:49,799
...that took place in Spitalfields and
which has shocked and appalled...

1173
01:46:50,001 --> 01:46:51,195
...the citizens of London.

1174
01:46:52,904 --> 01:46:55,998
It is believed that the victim,
a young woman...

1175
01:46:56,207 --> 01:46:58,301
...now identified as Nancy...

1176
01:46:58,510 --> 01:47:01,273
...was brutally beaten to death...

1177
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,113
...by one William Sykes...

1178
01:47:04,314 --> 01:47:07,249
...a well-known, dangerous villain.

1179
01:47:07,451 --> 01:47:09,510
The motive is as yet unclear...

1180
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:12,517
...but your correspondent has learned
that the murdered woman...

1181
01:47:12,723 --> 01:47:14,554
...had informed on her associate...

1182
01:47:14,757 --> 01:47:17,727
...and on an infamous fence, Fagin...

1183
01:47:18,694 --> 01:47:23,962
...who is now wanted for the abduction
of a young boy, Oliver Twist.

1184
01:47:25,534 --> 01:47:28,661
Neither Fagin nor Sykes
are presently in custody...

1185
01:47:28,871 --> 01:47:31,499
...but the police are engaged
in searching for them...

1186
01:47:31,707 --> 01:47:34,039
...throughout the city and beyond.

1187
01:47:35,209 --> 01:47:37,234
Sykes, according to the police...

1188
01:47:37,445 --> 01:47:42,279
...is usually accompanied
by a fierce white dog."

1189
01:47:45,018 --> 01:47:46,280
How about that, eh?

1190
01:47:59,032 --> 01:48:02,024
Come. Come back here.

1191
01:48:05,205 --> 01:48:06,969
We're going back to London.

1192
01:48:09,110 --> 01:48:11,099
I'll have people to speak to.

1193
01:48:11,311 --> 01:48:15,042
I'll force shiners out of Fagin,
get to France.

1194
01:48:15,248 --> 01:48:16,272
Damn me, we'll risk it.

1195
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:23,220
Who's he done in?

1196
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:27,822
-They say-- They say it's a woman.
-He's done in a woman?

1197
01:48:54,251 --> 01:48:56,185
Bullseye.

1198
01:48:57,353 --> 01:48:59,878
Don't you hear me when I whistle?

1199
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:02,790
You gone deaf or something?

1200
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:05,685
Come here. Come on.

1201
01:49:07,563 --> 01:49:10,464
I ain't gonna harm you. Come on.
Come on, Bullseye.

1202
01:49:11,466 --> 01:49:13,592
Come here.

1203
01:49:13,802 --> 01:49:16,736
Stop it! I'm warning you.

1204
01:49:16,938 --> 01:49:18,907
Let go, I ain't playing with you!

1205
01:49:19,107 --> 01:49:21,734
Let it go, you stinking varmint!

1206
01:49:21,943 --> 01:49:23,843
Bullseye!

1207
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:31,213
Bullseye. Bullseye.

1208
01:49:31,653 --> 01:49:33,882
Get back here. Get back here.

1209
01:49:36,190 --> 01:49:37,851
Damn it!

1210
01:49:43,263 --> 01:49:44,925
Look, it's his dog.

1211
01:49:45,132 --> 01:49:47,396
It's his dog!

1212
01:49:52,172 --> 01:49:53,537
Here, boy.

1213
01:49:53,739 --> 01:49:55,708
-Here.
-Don't go near him.

1214
01:50:01,981 --> 01:50:04,677
There is a child in danger,
lnspector Blathers...

1215
01:50:04,884 --> 01:50:06,375
...but you only seem interested...

1216
01:50:06,586 --> 01:50:08,611
...in apprehending this man,
William Sykes.

1217
01:50:08,821 --> 01:50:10,413
Your concern should be...

1218
01:50:10,623 --> 01:50:12,818
-...for the safety of the boy.
-Allow me to say...

1219
01:50:13,024 --> 01:50:15,584
...this is our usual way
of doing business.

1220
01:50:16,761 --> 01:50:18,523
My thinking is this:

1221
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:21,460
If we get Sykes, we get Fagin.

1222
01:50:21,665 --> 01:50:23,361
-And if we get Fagin--
-Look.

1223
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:27,192
Sir, we found the dog.

1224
01:50:29,339 --> 01:50:31,968
Are we going to sit here
waiting for the traps to find us?

1225
01:50:32,175 --> 01:50:35,269
-Shut it.
-No, he's right.

1226
01:50:35,479 --> 01:50:37,878
We should do another flit.

1227
01:50:40,517 --> 01:50:42,484
The traps!

1228
01:50:58,033 --> 01:50:59,295
What?

1229
01:50:59,734 --> 01:51:00,928
It's him.

1230
01:51:01,871 --> 01:51:03,804
-Don't let him in.
-We must.

1231
01:51:05,839 --> 01:51:07,568
Go on.

1232
01:51:09,711 --> 01:51:11,576
Go on!

1233
01:51:17,852 --> 01:51:20,343
Don't leave us in the dark.

1234
01:52:16,506 --> 01:52:18,633
Damn you all.

1235
01:52:19,275 --> 01:52:21,869
Have you nothing to say to me?

1236
01:52:22,244 --> 01:52:27,046
-Not safe for you to stop here, Bill.
-lf it's safe for you, it's safe for me.

1237
01:52:31,254 --> 01:52:32,720
Is it...?

1238
01:52:33,889 --> 01:52:35,413
The body, is it buried?

1239
01:52:43,764 --> 01:52:46,426
Dodger, let him in quick.

1240
01:52:48,737 --> 01:52:49,705
Dodger.

1241
01:52:50,939 --> 01:52:52,567
Do as I say.

1242
01:52:56,544 --> 01:52:58,774
Don't come near me, you monster.

1243
01:53:02,616 --> 01:53:04,743
You're my witnesses.
I'm not afraid of him.

1244
01:53:06,185 --> 01:53:08,620
And if they come here after him,
I'll give him up.

1245
01:53:08,822 --> 01:53:10,448
I'll tell them you're here.

1246
01:53:11,724 --> 01:53:15,092
He may kill me if he likes,
but if I'm here, I'll give him up.

1247
01:53:15,295 --> 01:53:17,889
If he was to be boiled alive,
so I would.

1248
01:53:18,097 --> 01:53:20,328
Why, you little--

1249
01:53:21,333 --> 01:53:22,824
Get off me!

1250
01:53:23,035 --> 01:53:24,799
Or I'll tear you limb from limb!

1251
01:53:30,942 --> 01:53:32,205
Help, he's here!

1252
01:53:32,410 --> 01:53:34,640
-He's here. Break down the door!
-Up at the window!

1253
01:53:34,846 --> 01:53:36,872
Help! Come up, please!

1254
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:41,345
-That's Bill Sykes!
-Damn you all!

1255
01:53:41,553 --> 01:53:43,578
Do your worst. I'll cheat you yet!

1256
01:53:55,065 --> 01:53:58,261
No! Bill, no.
He's our bargaining tool.

1257
01:53:58,469 --> 01:54:01,495
Not yours, Fagin. Mine.

1258
01:54:03,906 --> 01:54:05,464
Bill!

1259
01:54:16,685 --> 01:54:18,117
Don't fire.

1260
01:54:19,687 --> 01:54:21,622
-Don't fire.
-Hold your fire, men.

1261
01:54:21,823 --> 01:54:24,019
-Hold your fire.
-I'll let the boy go.

1262
01:54:24,226 --> 01:54:26,252
I'll let him drop.

1263
01:54:26,462 --> 01:54:28,929
Don't try nothing,
or I'll let him go!

1264
01:54:32,767 --> 01:54:34,667
Get up there.

1265
01:54:35,103 --> 01:54:37,162
Cross, cross.

1266
01:54:40,407 --> 01:54:44,069
Up there. Up there.

1267
01:54:48,015 --> 01:54:51,644
Grab hold of there.
Grab hold of it.

1268
01:55:00,859 --> 01:55:03,054
We must give chase, sir.

1269
01:55:14,506 --> 01:55:16,166
Get down.

1270
01:55:20,511 --> 01:55:21,978
They're getting away!

1271
01:55:22,181 --> 01:55:24,239
There, there. There he is!

1272
01:55:25,283 --> 01:55:26,544
Get him! Get him!

1273
01:55:26,751 --> 01:55:28,480
Damn it!

1274
01:56:01,817 --> 01:56:03,306
Grab it.

1275
01:56:03,518 --> 01:56:05,316
Grab it!

1276
01:57:25,229 --> 01:57:27,320
Oliver?

1277
01:57:27,530 --> 01:57:29,224
Oliver!

1278
01:57:31,768 --> 01:57:33,828
Oliver!

1279
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:41,507
-Here he is, sir.
-Come along, my boy.

1280
01:57:41,711 --> 01:57:45,510
Mr. Grimwig has something
to say to you.

1281
01:57:46,749 --> 01:57:48,215
Do the honors, Mrs. Bedwin.

1282
01:57:48,417 --> 01:57:53,218
Now then, young man,
I confess I misjudged you.

1283
01:57:53,422 --> 01:57:57,380
Truth to tell, I feared your benefactor
would make me eat my head.

1284
01:57:58,527 --> 01:58:01,689
But he's a good friend
and has pardoned me.

1285
01:58:01,897 --> 01:58:04,456
-And one for Oliver.
-Thank you, sir.

1286
01:58:04,665 --> 01:58:06,327
-So--
-And you too, Mrs. Bedwin.

1287
01:58:06,534 --> 01:58:08,365
-I don't know as I should, sir.
-You must.

1288
01:58:08,568 --> 01:58:13,301
So I'll take the liberty,
if you'll allow me, to salute you.

1289
01:58:14,107 --> 01:58:17,008
-To Sam Waters.
-Oliver Twist.

1290
01:58:17,377 --> 01:58:20,541
Oliver Twist. To Oliver Twist.

1291
01:58:21,314 --> 01:58:23,077
Yes.

1292
01:58:25,585 --> 01:58:29,988
Why, Oliver.
My child, what's the matter?

1293
01:58:30,589 --> 01:58:32,420
Why are you so sad?

1294
01:58:59,648 --> 01:59:02,345
Are you certain, Oliver,
you wish to go through with this?

1295
01:59:02,551 --> 01:59:04,247
Yes, sir.

1296
01:59:04,454 --> 01:59:06,319
Certain.

1297
01:59:12,294 --> 01:59:14,159
Yes?

1298
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,499
Is the young gentleman
to come too, sir?

1299
02:00:02,742 --> 02:00:05,176
It's not a sight for children, sir.

1300
02:00:05,378 --> 02:00:08,677
It is not indeed, my friend.
But this child has seen this man...

1301
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,144
...in the full career
of his success and villainy.

1302
02:00:11,349 --> 02:00:14,375
And it is his wish, even at the cost
of some pain and fear...

1303
02:00:14,586 --> 02:00:16,952
...that he should see him now.

1304
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,315
Eighteen.

1305
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:08,232
Hey!

1306
02:01:12,474 --> 02:01:13,735
Good boy.

1307
02:01:13,943 --> 02:01:15,773
Good boy, Charley.

1308
02:01:15,977 --> 02:01:17,969
Well done.

1309
02:01:25,521 --> 02:01:28,717
Good boy, Charley, well done.
Well done.

1310
02:01:29,057 --> 02:01:31,490
-Take the boy away to bed.
-Don't be frightened.

1311
02:01:31,692 --> 02:01:33,387
Fagin.

1312
02:01:33,661 --> 02:01:35,458
That's me. An old man, my lord.

1313
02:01:35,663 --> 02:01:38,256
A-- A very old-- Old man.

1314
02:01:38,865 --> 02:01:40,331
Someone here wants to see you.

1315
02:01:40,767 --> 02:01:42,427
-Strike! Strike them all dead!
-Easy.

1316
02:01:42,636 --> 02:01:44,569
What right have they to butcher me?

1317
02:01:44,770 --> 02:01:46,829
Speak to him now.
Quick, if you please.

1318
02:01:47,039 --> 02:01:49,008
For he grows worse
as the time goes on.

1319
02:01:51,211 --> 02:01:53,839
Fagin, you were kind to me.

1320
02:01:54,046 --> 02:01:55,411
Yes, yes.

1321
02:01:55,614 --> 02:01:57,275
I'll be kind again.

1322
02:01:57,483 --> 02:01:59,508
I'll be kind again.

1323
02:01:59,717 --> 02:02:02,117
I'll be kind again.

1324
02:02:07,357 --> 02:02:10,190
-I'm not afraid.
-Oliver!

1325
02:02:14,765 --> 02:02:18,201
Let-- Let me whisper to you.

1326
02:02:20,437 --> 02:02:23,133
You remember the box, Oliver?

1327
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:26,433
With my pretty things
for my old age, Oliver?

1328
02:02:26,642 --> 02:02:29,805
It's hid a little way up the chimney
in the top front room.

1329
02:02:30,012 --> 02:02:32,207
It's yours, Oliver.

1330
02:02:32,415 --> 02:02:35,473
-Yours, but we must talk.
-Yes, yes.

1331
02:02:35,685 --> 02:02:38,211
But shall we say a prayer
together first?

1332
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:39,615
Do.

1333
02:02:39,823 --> 02:02:43,383
Say only one, upon your knees,
with me...

1334
02:02:43,593 --> 02:02:46,255
...and we can talk all morning.

1335
02:02:46,862 --> 02:02:48,454
Outside. Outside.

1336
02:02:48,665 --> 02:02:51,427
You can say I've gone to sleep.
They'll believe you.

1337
02:02:51,634 --> 02:02:55,729
You can get me out. The pretty
things are yours, my dear, yours.

1338
02:02:55,938 --> 02:03:00,068
-Oh, God, forgive this wretched man.
-That's right, that's right.

1339
02:03:00,276 --> 02:03:01,470
That will help us on.

1340
02:03:01,677 --> 02:03:05,772
If-- lf-- lf-- If l...

1341
02:03:05,981 --> 02:03:10,441
...shake and tremble as we pass
the gallows, don't-- Don't--

1342
02:03:10,851 --> 02:03:14,617
Don't you mind, hurry on.
Now, now, now.

1343
02:03:14,822 --> 02:03:17,484
-Have you more to say to him, sir?
-Nothing more.

1344
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:20,591
-You'd better leave him.
-Press on, press on, press on.

1345
02:03:20,793 --> 02:03:22,818
Press on, press on.

1346
02:03:23,030 --> 02:03:25,521
Softly. Softly. No, no!

1347
02:03:25,733 --> 02:03:27,064
It hurts!

1348
02:03:27,267 --> 02:03:29,291
Faster, faster!

1349
02:03:29,502 --> 02:03:31,436
Faster, faster!

1350
02:03:31,639 --> 02:03:35,539
Faster, faster, faster, faster!

1351
02:05:08,534 --> 02:05:12,458
THE END
