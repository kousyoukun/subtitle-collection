2
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:23,124
芝加哥今日天朗气清 气温在70度以上
It is a beautiful day in Chicago. Temperatures in the upper 70's.

3
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,070
目前在湖畔的气温是75度 中途岛73度，奥黑尔73度
Right now, 75 at the lakefront, 74 at Midway, 73 at O'Hare.

4
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:37,948
汤姆
Tom!

5
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:44,148
 什么事？  是费利，看他的样子
 What's the matter?  It's Ferris Look at him

6
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,289
费利？
Ferris?

7
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:54,523
他没有发烧 但胃痛又头晕眼花
He doesn't have a fever, but his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots

8
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:58,669
 费利，你没事吧？  爸爸？
 What's the matter, Ferris?  Papa?

9
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:02,864
摸一下他双手，又冷又湿
Feel his hands, they're cold and clammy

10
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:10,960
 我没事，我要起床  不行
 I'm fine I'll get up  No!

11
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:14,281
 我今天有测验  不行
 I have a test today  No

12
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:20,083
我一定要参加测验 我要进优秀大学，有丰盛人生
I must take it I want to go to a good college, so I can have a fruitful life

13
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:23,693
乖儿子，你这样子绝不能上学
Honey, you're not going to school like this

14
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:27,888
 他怎么了？  他不舒服
 What's his problem?  He doesn't feel well

15
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:31,625
弄干你的手 湿得可以灌溉草地
Dry that one out, you can fertilise the lawn

16
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:36,069
珍妮，是你么？
Jeanie, is that you?

17
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:39,836
你站到那么远，我看不清楚
I can't see that far Jeanie?

18
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:43,481
珍妮，我...
Jeanie, I

19
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,746
 老弟，别装蒜  珍妮，快上学去
 Bite the big one, junior  Jeanie, you get to school

20
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:56,690
就算我双眼流血，你们仍会 要我上学，这实在不公平
If I was bleeding out my eyes, you'd make me go to school It's so unfair

21
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:01,798
珍妮，别为我难过 你该庆幸自己那么健康
Jeanie, don't be upset with me You have your health, be thankful

22
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:11,273
够了，我不要再留在这个家
That's it! I want out of this family

23
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:18,802
我没事的，我会继续睡 或许在正午左右吃止痛药
I'm okay I'll just sleep I'll have an aspirin around noon

24
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:24,005
我今天会带佛蒙特来的那家人 去看房子
I'm showing some houses to that family from Vermont today

25
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:29,322
若要找我，问我的同事便可以
My office will know just where I am if you need me

26
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:35,524
 我会来电看你怎样  你们实在关心我
 I'll check on you too, pal  I have such loving, caring parents

27
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:39,670
你们实在太好人了
You're both very special people

28
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:48,540
 多点休息吧，乖孩子  好的
 You get better, pumpkin  Okay, pumpkin

29
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:52,774
我会准六时回来 若有任何需要，记紧来电
I'll be home at six sharp If you need anything, call

30
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,453
打电话
Ringy-dingy

31
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,183
 宝贝，再见  我也爱你们
 We love you, sweetie  I love you, too

32
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:06,731
有需要尽管来电
Call if you need us

33
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:17,400
他们上当了
They bought it

34
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:31,981
难以置信，我的表现那么不济 他们竟没怀疑
Incredible! A terrible performance, and they never doubted it for a second

35
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:41,022
像这样一天我怎能上学呢？
How could I be expected to handle school on a day like this?

36
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:56,112
这已是我在本学期第九次病倒 实在再难想出什么新病症来
This is my ninth sick day It's tough coming up with new illnesses

37
00:03:56,168 --> 00:04:02,110
第十次时可能要吐出肺部 所以，我要好好利用今天病假
If I go for ten, I'll have to barf up a lung So I'd better make this one count

38
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:07,856
湿而冷的双手 是骗倒父母的关键
The key to faking out the parents is the clammy hands

39
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,520
是"百搭"病徵，万试万灵
It's a good non-specific symptom I'm a big believer in it

40
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:16,393
很多人说装作发烧是最好方法
A lot of people will tell you to go for a phoney fever

41
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:23,268
但若你母亲太紧张的话 你可能要看医生，这样更糟
But if you get a nervous mother, you could wind up in a doctor's office

42
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:26,308
你装作胃抽筋
You fake a stomach cramp

43
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:30,948
在弯腰呻吟时，顺势舔湿手掌
When you're bent over wailing, you lick your palms

44
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,778
这样既幼稚又无聊 但上中学又何尝不是呢？
It's childish and stupid, but then, so is high school

45
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:39,716
人生匆匆
Life moves pretty fast

46
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:45,752
若你不偶尔停下来四处看看 会错过很多事
If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it

47
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,400
今天确有测验，我没有说谎
I do have a test today, that wasn't bullshit

48
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:54,903
题目是欧洲社会主义 但测验有什么用呢？
It's on European socialism What's the point?

49
00:04:55,107 --> 00:05:00,374
我又不是欧洲人 管他是不是社会主义
I'm not European, so who gives a crap if they're socialists?

50
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:04,879
就算是法西斯无政府主义者 也无法令我有车代步
They could be fascist anarchists, it still wouldn't buy me a car

51
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:11,786
我记起秋天时的中央公园
I recall Central Park in fall

52
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,359
你怎样撕破自己的裙子 我承认，真是一团糟...
how you tore your dress what a mess, I confess...

53
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:28,232
我并非容忍法西斯主义 或任何主义
It's not that I condone fascism, or any "ism"

54
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,401
人不该相信什么主义 该相信自己
A person should not believe in an "ism", he should believe in himself

55
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:39,209
约翰连侬说过 我不相信披头四，我相信自己
I quote John Lennon: "I don't believe in Beatles I just believe in me"

56
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,252
有道理，毕竟他是海象
A good point there After all, he was the walrus

57
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:47,721
我也可以这样 但我仍要坐人家的顺风车
I could be the walrus, I'd still have to bum rides off people

58
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,521
艾当斯，艾当利
Adams Adamly

59
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:55,756
 在  艾当基，艾当逊
 Here  Adamowlsky, Adamson

60
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:59,300
 艾迪拿  在
 Adler  Here

61
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:03,770
 安德逊，安德逊？  在
 Anderson Anderson?  Here

62
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:06,342
布费利
Bueller

63
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:10,040
布费利
Bueller

64
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:13,913
布费利…
Bueller Bueller

65
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:19,716
他病了，我好友妹妹的男友 的哥哥的女朋友
He's sick My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend -

66
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:25,765
看到费利昨晚在快餐店晕倒 情况好像颇为严重
 saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavours last night I guess it's pretty serious

67
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:29,957
 谢谢你告诉我  别客气
 Thank you, Simone  No problem whatsoever

68
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,534
范马伦
Frye

69
00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:36,367
范马伦
Frye Frye

70
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,513
 喂？  马伦，发生什么事？
 Hello?  Cameron, what's happening?

71
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:53,956
 没什么  你觉得怎样？
 Very little  How do you feel?

72
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:57,458
 完全崩溃  你妈妈在你房间么？
 Shredded  Is your mother in the room?

73
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:01,564
她在迪凯特 可惜她并非留在那儿
She's in Decatur Unfortunately she's not staying

74
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:07,836
 你在哪里？  我休息一天，过来吧
 Where are you?  I'm taking the day off, come on over

75
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,771
 不行，我病倒了  心理作用而已
 I can't, stupid, I'm sick.  That's all in your head

76
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:16,676
 过来吧  我很不舒服，哪里也不能去
 Come on over.  I feel like shit I can't go anywhere

77
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:21,842
实在很遗憾，快驾车过来接我
I'm sorry to hear that Now come on over and pick me up

78
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,627
我快死了
I'm dying

79
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:43,400
不是的，你只是无所事事罢了
You're not dying. Youjust can't think of anything good to do.

80
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:48,780
马伦实在需要放假一天
Cameron really needs a day off

81
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:55,442
他在上大学前有很多东西 要搞清楚
He has a lot of things to sort out before he goes to college

82
00:07:55,654 --> 00:08:00,990
当马伦在埃及
When Cameron was in Egypt's land

83
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:07,256
让我的马伦走吧
let my Cameron go.

84
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,333
马伦紧张得很…
Cameron is so tight -

85
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:13,936
若把碳塞进他的屁股 会变成钻石
 that a lump of coal stuck up his ass would turn into a diamond

86
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:25,141
 我是布凯蒂  我是训导主任罗艾华
 Katie Bueller  Edward Rooney, Dean of Students.

87
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,846
对不起，我忘了致电给你们
I'm so sorry I completely forgot to call

88
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:37,825
 你知否令O今天没上学？  知道，费利病了，在家休息
 You know your son isn't in school?  Yes. Ferris is home sick.

89
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:43,865
我今早要开会 忘记致电你们，很抱歉
I had a meeting this morning. I forgot to call. I'm very sorry.

90
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:46,936
请问你知否…
Are you also aware -

91
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,838
费利的上课率并非太好？
 that Ferris does not have an exemplary attendance record.

92
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:54,046
什么？
What?

93
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:58,080
他有多天没上课
He has missed an unacceptable number of school days.

94
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:01,879
费利没有认真对待学业
Ferris is not taking his academic growth seriously.

95
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:07,115
我今早一直在翻查他的纪录
I've spent my morning examining his records

96
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:13,787
若费利以为他这样可顺利毕业 就大错特错了
If Ferris thinks he can coast through to graduation, he is sorely mistaken

97
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:17,058
我十分赞成… 
I have no reservation whatsoever-

98
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:21,467
把他留级
 about holding him back another year

99
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:26,007
 我完全不知道这些事  通常都是这样的
 This is all news to me  It usually is

100
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:32,913
 他在本学期已缺课了九次  九次？
 He has been absent nine times  Nine times?

101
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:37,316
 九次  他并没病倒过九次
 Nine times  He hasn't been sick nine times

102
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:42,550
这大概因为他根本没有病 他逃学
That's probably because he wasn't sick, he was skipping school

103
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:45,628
清醒吧
Wake up and smell the coffee

104
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:49,858
他愚弄了你，他逃学
It's a fool's paradise He's leading you down the primrose path

105
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:54,003
 我不相信  证据就在我面前
 I can't believe it.  It's right here in front of me

106
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,640
他已缺课了九天...
He has missed nine days

107
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:04,049
缺课次数，5，4，3，2...

108
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:09,719
我想要汽车，却得到一台电脑 真不幸
I asked for a car I got a computer How's that for being born unlucky?

109
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:15,203
姬丝
Grace!

110
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:21,526
罗先生，费利在家 他很不舒服
Mr Rooney, Ferris is home and he is very ill

111
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:25,930
 我甚至不想抛下他一人  姬丝
 I debated even leaving him.  Grace!

112
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:30,073
每年这时候 孩子最容易不想上学
At this time of year, children are prone to taking the day off

113
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:34,713
但我可保证费利真的是不舒服
But I can assure you that Ferris is a very sick boy

114
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:42,648
无师自通
Never had one lesson

115
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:51,954
1930年，众议院为减轻什么？
In 1930 the House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of

116
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:54,166
有没有人知道？
Anyone?

117
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:59,998
减轻大萧条的影响 通过了什么？
The Great Depression Passed the anyone?

118
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:04,575
荷里史莫特关税法案
The Holly-Smoot Tariff Act

119
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:08,075
把关税调高或调低？
Which raised or lowered?

120
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,843
把关税调高以增加政府收入
Raised tariffs in an effort to collect more government revenue

121
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:18,284
有没有效呢？ 有没有人知道？
Did it work? Anyone know the effects?

122
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,120
没有效，美国更加萧条
It did not work and the United States sank deeper into the Depression

123
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:28,322
今日，我们亦有类似的辩论 有没有人知道是什么？
Today, we have a similar debate over this Anyone know what this is?

124
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:32,494
有没有人看过这个？
Anyone seen this before?

125
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,731
拉弗曲线 有没有人知道当中理论？
The Laffer curve Anyone know what this says?

126
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,967
理论指在收入曲线的这一点…
It says that at this point on the revenue curve -

127
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:45,172
你得到的收入会跟这一点一样
 you will get exactly the same amount of revenue as at this point

128
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:50,946
有没有人知道 副总统布殊在80年说过什么？
Does anyone know what Bush called this in 1980?

129
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:57,686
有没有人知道？什么经济？ 伏都经济
Anyone? Something-doo economics Voodoo economics

130
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,909
珍妮，我为你弟弟的事难过
Jeanie, I'm really sorry about your brother

131
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:16,274
你难过什么？ 要与他同住的是我
What are you sorry for? I have to live with him

132
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:20,679
 我听闻他病得很重  谁说的？
 I heard he's really sick  Who said he's sick?

133
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:24,252
好些人说他快死了
A bunch of people say he's close to death

134
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:30,326
据闻若费利死了 他会把眼睛捐给史堤菲温达
I heard that if Ferris dies, he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder

135
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,986
他实在好心，再见
He's such a sweetie Got to go

136
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:37,531
 珍妮  闭嘴
 Hi, Jeanie  Shut up

137
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:41,035
情况有多严重？
How desperate is the situation?

138
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,935
你有否看过异形？
Did you see "Alien"?

139
00:12:44,142 --> 00:12:47,908
记不记得当异形 破开那男人肚子出来的情形
When the creature was in that guy's stomach?

140
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:51,310
就是那样子了 新生
It feels like that Freshman

141
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:56,453
 你说笑吧？  我似在说笑吗？
 Are you kidding?  Do I sound like I'm kidding?

142
00:12:56,654 --> 00:13:00,488
 是布费利  他助我离开暑期学校
 It's Ferris Bueller  He got me out of summer school

143
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:05,652
谢谢你告诉我们你的病情
We appreciate you letting us know how you're doing.

144
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:10,700
他千万不要死 否则我今夏一定很难捱
I hope he doesn't die I can't handle summer school

145
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:15,032
 叫别的人来听吧  好的，等一下
 Give me somebody else  Sure, hold on

146
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:19,403
 你有否看过异形？  有，此话何解？
 Did you see "Alien"?  Yeah, why?

147
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:24,545
喂？费利，你的身体怎样？
Hello? Hi, Ferris, how's your bod?

148
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:28,185
你好像病得很重
You're dying?

149
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,486
 严重么？  希望不严重
 Is it serious?  I hope not

150
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:41,825
 我或需要换肾  天呀，你是否很不开心？
 I may need a kidney transplant  Shit! Are you upset?

151
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:46,131
 对不起  你本周末还会活著么？
 Excuse me  Will you be alive this weekend?

152
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:50,535
 会的  好极，或许到时来探望你吧
 Yeah, I'd say so  Great Maybe I'll see you

153
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:10,052
我绝对不相信这小子 我恨不得撵他走
I don't trust this kid any further than I can throw him

154
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:17,133
你膝部有旧患 不该撵走任何人
With your bad knee, Ed, you shouldn't throw anybody It's true

155
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:23,001
他最危险之处是教坏好学生
What is so dangerous about him is that he gives good kids bad ideas

156
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:30,138
我不想见到有1500个 布费利的信徒在学校四处走
The last thing I need is 1,500 Bueller disciples running around these halls

157
00:14:30,348 --> 00:14:34,114
他危害到我管理学生的能力
He jeopardises my ability to govern this student body

158
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:40,815
 他令你看来像个傻瓜  谢谢，但你错了
 He makes you look like an ass  Thank you, but you're wrong

159
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:43,823
他很受欢迎
He's very popular

160
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:48,465
爱运动的、爱驾车的、古怪的 放荡的、爱浪费的…
Sportoes, motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wasteoids, -

161
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:53,831
爱哭的、愚蠢的，都喜欢他
 dweebies, dickheads, they all adore him

162
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,707
所以我才要抓到他
That is why I have got to catch him

163
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,007
向其他学生证明 他这样是没前途的
To show these kids that his example is a first-class ticket to nowhere

164
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:08,743
你活像“卑鄙哈利”啊
Ed! You sounded like Dirty Harry just then

165
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:12,389
真的？
Really?

166
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:18,453
过奖，姬丝
Thanks, Grace

167
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:24,396
 你不能这样子要我等  让我安息吧
 You can't make me wait like this  Let me rot in peace.

168
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:31,235
这是我第九次病倒，若被抓到 便无法毕业，我是为了你冒险
It's my ninth sick day If I get caught, I won't graduate I'm doing this for you

169
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:35,469
 知道什么是心律舒张期吗？  吃些消化药
 Do you know what my diastolic is?  Take some Pepto Bismal

170
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,446
 快穿好衣服，然后过来  闭嘴
 Get dressed and come on over  Shut up

171
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:46,318
等一下，有人来电...喂？
Hold your water for a second I've got another call Hello?

172
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:53,794
 费利，你似乎仍很不舒服  我还以为自己的情况好转
 Ferris. You sound terrible.  Darn, I thought I was improving.

173
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:57,593
 你是否在睡觉？  爸爸，你可否等一下？
 Were you sleeping?  Dad, can you hang on for a second?

174
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:00,497
 好的  等一下
 Sure, pal  Hang on

175
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:04,641
 马伦，是我爸来的  好极，别拖我落水
 Cameron, it's my dad  Great Keep me out of it

176
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:10,906
若你在15分钟内还不过来 找另一个好朋友吧
If you're not over here in 15 minutes, you can find a new best friend

177
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:18,113
爸爸，跟你说话后 我又有点头晕
Dad, all this talking has made me kind of light-headed

178
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:23,818
 我还是躺下  用热毛巾敷在额上
 I think I ought to lie down  Wrap a hot towel round your head

179
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:30,490
 敷热毛巾  喝点热汤，然后再睡一会
 Wrap a hot towel round my head?  Make some soup, then get a nap

180
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:36,580
 费利，好好休息  你真关心我
 Ferris, I love you, pal  I love you, too

181
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:45,575
我敢打睹马伦正坐在车里 盘算应否出门
I bet Cameron is sitting in his car debating whether or not to go out

182
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:53,649
他会不断来电至我往他那儿
He'll keep calling me until I come over

183
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:56,952
他会令我感内疚
He'll make me feel guilty

184
00:16:57,161 --> 00:17:00,904
实在荒谬，去吧
This is ridiculous I'll go I'll go

185
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,768
去吧，真气人
I'll go Shit!

186
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:12,672
怎么搞的
Goddammit!

187
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,554
算了
Forget it That's it

188
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:50,246
作者以什么方法...
In what way

189
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,745
用监狱去...
does the author's use of the prison

190
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,954
象徵...
symbolise

191
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:15,966
故事主人翁的挣扎？
the protagonist's struggle?

192
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:19,507
这样又跟我们所讨论的
And how does this relate -

193
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:24,080
讽刺手法有何关系呢？
 to our discussion of the uses of irony?

194
00:18:25,717 --> 00:18:29,346
卢先生，抱歉打扰你
Mr Nolan, may I interrupt, please?

195
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:39,530
白思朗，可否跟你谈谈？
Sloane Peterson, may I have a word with you, dear?

196
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:47,304
恐怕我有坏消息要对告诉你
I'm afraid that I am the bearer of bad tidings

197
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:52,772
令尊来电说你的外婆刚去世
Your father called Your grandmother has just passed

198
00:18:54,846 --> 00:19:00,785
 不...  真可怜
 No  Oh, darling! Honey

199
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:05,649
 外婆死了？  白先生是这样说的
 Dead grandmother?  That's what Mr Peterson said

200
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:09,884
我叫了史兰丝通知她
I had Florence Sparrow notify the poor little lamb

201
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:15,225
 她跟谁拍拖？  这些日子很难说啊
 Who is this girl going out with?  It's so hard to tell these days

202
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:19,300
但我见到她跟布费利来往颇密
I do see her with Ferris Bueller quite a bit

203
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:24,470
替我找白先生的联络电话号码
Would you get me Mr Peterson's daytime number?

204
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:30,137
 罗艾华办公室  我是白佐治
 Ed Rooney's Office  This is George Peterson.

205
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:36,509
请稍等，是白先生来电
Please hold What do you know, it's Mr Peterson

206
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:40,014
还要不要他的联络电话号码？
Do you still want his daytime number?

207
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:47,963
 我是罗艾华  我是白佐治
 Ed Rooney  Ed, this is George Peterson.

208
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:53,160
 你好吗？  其实并不好
 How are you today, sir?  Well, we've had a bit of bad luck.

209
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:58,671
我有所听闻，请节哀顺变
Yeah, I heard I'm all broken up Boy, what a blow

210
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:02,540
今早真难熬
Yeah, it's been a tough morning.

211
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,716
我们有很多家事要办
We've got a lot of family business.

212
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:09,478
若你准许思朗休息，我很感激
If you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane, I'd appreciate it.

213
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:12,520
我乐意这样做
Sure, I'd be happy to

214
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:17,319
只要你给我看尸体 我就会让思朗走
You just produce a corpse, and I'll release Sloane

215
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:21,294
我要亲眼见到这死去的外婆
I want to see this dead grandmother first-hand

216
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:26,799
不要紧，是布费利 我在设陷阱
It's all right, it's Ferris Bueller I'm setting a trap for him

217
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:33,300
你是否说要看到尸体？
Ed, I'm sorry, did you say you wanted to see a body?

218
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:39,211
是的，送尸体来，我就放人
Yeah, roll her old bones over here and I'll dig up your daughter

219
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:43,046
这是学校政策，是你母亲么？
That's school policy Was this your mother?

220
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:46,280
不是，是内子的母亲
No, my wife's mother.

221
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:53,253
 罗艾华办公室  我是布费利，想找罗先生
 Ed Rooney's Office  This is Ferris Bueller for Mr Rooney

222
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:59,134
稍等...
Hold

223
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:03,535
告诉你，笨蛋 若你不喜欢我的政策
I'll tell you what, dipshit, if you don't like my policies, -

224
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:08,337
你可以来这儿舐我的肥臀
 you can come down here and smooch my big old white butt

225
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:13,506
 知道没有，什么事？  布费利在二线
 Pucker up, Buttercup What?  Ferris Bueller is on line two

226
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:29,727
罗先生，我今天不舒服
Mr Rooney, I'm not feeling very well today.

227
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:35,201
可否把我的家课交给我姐姐？
Could my sister bring home any assignments from my classes?

228
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:38,068
谢谢你，再见
Have a nice day.

229
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:57,559
白先生…我要向你道歉
Mr Peterson I think I owe you an apology

230
00:21:57,762 --> 00:22:02,165
 当然  我...
 I should say you do  I

231
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:05,529
你早该向我道歉
I think you should be sorry, for Christ's sake

232
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:09,968
我的亲人死了，你却侮辱我 你怎么了？
A family member dies and you insult me! What's wrong with you?

233
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:14,270
其实...我也不知道
Well I really don't know

234
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:17,709
我以为我在跟别人说话
I didn't think I was talking to you.

235
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:25,618
我绝不会蓄意侮辱你的
You know that I would never deliberately insult you like that

236
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:30,851
恕我直言，你实在是个大笨蛋
Pardon my French, but you're an asshole! Asshole!

237
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:36,032
你说得对，快去找她
You're absolutely right, sir Find out where she is

238
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:40,795
 我不会就此罢休，你听到没？  听得很清楚
 This isn't over yet Do you read me?  Loud and clear, Mr Peterson

239
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:45,135
 叫我做先生  是的，先生
 Call me sir, goddammit!  Yes, sir

240
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:47,709
这样才像样
That's better.

241
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:52,281
你要打醒十二分精神 并记著你要应付的是谁
You mind your P's and Q's, and remember who you're dealing with

242
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,012
是布费利
Bueller Ferris Bueller

243
00:22:56,134 --> 00:23:00,462
我很害怕 若他认出我的声音那怎办？
I'm scared What if he recognises my voice?

244
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:03,994
没可能，你装得十分相像
Impossible You're doing great

245
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:15,932
罗，冷静
Rooney! Rooney, calm down

246
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:24,047
 等一下  办公室小意外
 Just a moment  Just a little office difficulty

247
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:29,846
我没时间整天骂你，长话短说
I don't have all day to bark at you, so I'm going to make this short

248
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:35,185
我要小女在十分钟后 一个人在学校门口
I want my daughter out in front of the school by herself

249
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:39,486
 什么事？  那样太惹人怀疑了
 What?  That's too suspicious

250
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,164
 继续说  你
 Talk  You!

251
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:49,964
 继续说  罗，你听著
 Talk!  Rooney! Pay attention

252
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:55,942
我要你陪她在校门 我有话要跟你说
I want you out there with her I want a few words with you

253
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:02,876
我们现在没时间 午饭时间再跟你说
We don't have time to talk right now We'll get together over lunch

254
00:24:03,702 --> 00:24:08,244
 你怎么了？  慢著
 What's wrong with you?  Wait!

255
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:13,261
 你怎么搞的？  你为何踢我？
 Where's your brain?  Why did you kick me?

256
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:20,174
若罗跟思朗一起，怎接她呢？
How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney is there with her?

257
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:25,140
我说要她独个在校门 你又害怕
I said for her to be there alone and you freaked

258
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:30,411
我没有打你，不过轻力拍你
I didn't hit you I lightly slapped you

259
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:33,412
你有打我
You hit me

260
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:41,915
若你不喜欢我的方式 就别要我参与你的无聊大计
Don't ask me to participate in your crap if you don't like the way I do it

261
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:45,287
是你要我起床来这里
You make me get out of bed and come here

262
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:49,945
是你要我致电给罗艾华
You make me make a phoney call to Edward Rooney

263
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:53,035
那人可以把我置诸死地
The man could squash my nuts

264
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,669
 而你竟然全不理会我的感受  我没有
 And you deliberately hurt my feelings  No

265
00:24:56,774 --> 00:25:02,474
我没有不理会你的感受
I did not deliberately hurt your feelings I didn't

266
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:09,679
 你做什么？  再见，我回家了
 What are you doing?  See you later I'm going home

267
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,486
 祝你好运  慢著
 Have a nice life  Cameron, wait a minute

268
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:19,411
我不是有意发脾气，对不起
I didn't mean to lose my temper I'm sorry, it was uncalled for

269
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:21,465
 真的？  真的
 Seriously?  Yeah

270
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:34,042
 来吧  劳驾
 Here you go  Thank you

271
00:25:35,794 --> 00:25:40,983
但你的确弄砸了事情
You did screw up though, right?

272
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:46,919
 但也不尽是你的错  为什么？
 Not that it was completely your fault  Why?

273
00:25:47,124 --> 00:25:53,586
为挽救这情况，我要你帮忙
To fix the situation, I'm going to have to ask you for a favour

274
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:16,478
那辆1961年250GT法拉利跑车
The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California

275
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:22,957
全球不足100辆
Less than a hundred were made

276
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,221
我爸爸用了三年修好它
My father spent three years restoring this car

277
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:30,922
那是他的至爱，他的命根
It is his love It is his passion

278
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:35,298
是他的错，他没锁好车房
It is his fault he didn't lock the garage

279
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:39,067
你在说什么？
Ferris, what are you talking about?

280
00:26:41,745 --> 00:26:44,373
我爸爸视这车如命
My father loves this car more than life

281
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:50,179
这样的男人配不上这种车
A man with such priorities doesn't deserve this fine automobile

282
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:53,349
不行
No

283
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:57,552
你似乎不明白
Apparently you don't understand

284
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:03,707
他从没驾驶过它 只以餐巾抹它
He never drives it He just rubs it with a diaper

285
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:08,671
记不记得我弄破了固体位时 他是多么的愤怒？
Remember how insane he went when I broke my retainer?

286
00:27:08,872 --> 00:27:13,673
那不过是块胶，而这是法拉利
That was a piece of plastic This is a Ferrari

287
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:19,310
我们不能用你的车去接思朗
We can't pick up Sloane in your car

288
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:22,779
罗不会相信白先生驾那辆废铁
Mr Rooney would never believe Mr Peterson drives that piece of shit

289
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:27,385
 那并非废铁  是废铁
 It's not a piece of shit  It is

290
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:32,824
我连废铁也没有，我很羡慕你
Don't worry I don't even have a piece of shit I have to envy yours

291
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:38,466
抱歉…已别无他法
I'm sorry There's nothing else we can do

292
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,115
 他知道车子的里数  他不相信你吗？
 He knows the mileage  He doesn't trust you?

293
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:57,721
 从不相信，亦永不会相信  其实很简单
 Never has, never will  This is real simple

294
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:01,721
只要把多走的里数删掉便是
Whatever miles we put on, we'll take off

295
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,454
 我们倒驶它回家便行  不行
 We'll drive home backwards  No

296
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:12,329
真的不行，你还是放弃
No, Ferris, forget it I'm putting my foot down

297
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:17,405
不如我们租一辆佳得力吧 我出钱
How about we rent a nice Cadillac? My treat

298
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:24,447
我们可以租轿车 特长那种，车内有电视和酒吧
We could call a limo A stretch job with a TV and a bar

299
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:31,381
来，开心一点吧
Come on, live a little

300
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:38,255
我为你的事很难过
Let me tell you how deeply saddened I am by your loss

301
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:43,422
我亦曾有外婆…更有两个
I had a grandmother once Two, actually

302
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:52,301
生命苦短
"Man hath but a short time to live and is full of misery"

303
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:56,240
刹那光华，朝花夕拾
"He cometh up and is cut down like a flower"

304
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:59,575
如梦似烟…
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow -

305
00:28:59,717 --> 00:29:03,175
昙花一现
 and never continueth in one stay"

306
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:07,039
天呀
Oh, dear

307
00:29:10,194 --> 00:29:14,927
若要从悲伤和空虚中选择 我会选悲伤
Between grief and nothing, I'll take grief

308
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,536
好极
Great

309
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:30,979
思朗，赶快
Sloane, dear, hurry along now

310
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:36,543
是我爸，我要走了
I guess that's my dad I've got to go

311
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:44,787
罗…艾华先生
Mr Rooney Ed

312
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:48,487
 你确是个君子  过奖
 You're a beautiful man  Thank you

313
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:53,760
谢谢你那么体贴和关心
I want to thank you for your warmth and compassion

314
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:05,592
垃圾
Shit!

315
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:10,685
 不给爸爸一个吻？  你说笑吧
 Do you have a kiss for Daddy?  Are you kidding?

316
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:22,998
原来这是他们的家族习惯
So that's how it is in their family

317
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:32,933
 马伦，你舒服么？  不舒服
 Hi, Cameron, are you comfortable?  Hi, Sloane No

318
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:41,942
 我们打算做什么？  该是我们打算不做什么？
 What are we going to do?  What aren't we going to do?

319
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:45,883
别说我们打算不驾这辆车回家
Don't say we're not going to take the car home

320
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:51,550
若你可驾驶到这样的靓车 你会否立即驶它回家？
If you had access to a car like this, would you take it back right away?

321
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:54,754
我也不会
Neither would I

322
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:28,471
费利，别那么快
Ferris, don't go so fast

323
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:33,825
救救费利，谢谢你，你很慷慨
Save Ferris God bless you You're very generous

324
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:37,033
救救布费利
Save Ferris Bueller

325
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:39,503
 救救费利？  什么？
 Save Ferris?  What?

326
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:45,132
我们为布费利筹款 好让他可以换肾
We're collecting money to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney

327
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:48,111
 往别处滚吧  你说什么？
 Go piss up a flagpole  I'm sorry?

328
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:51,339
 你真可悲  喂
 You should be  Hey!

329
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:56,247
若你有日要布费利帮忙那怎样
What if you need a favour someday from Ferris Bueller?

330
00:32:56,453 --> 00:33:01,755
第一线接通了白先生的家 今次小心说话
Peterson home on line one Watch your mouth this time

331
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:04,759
去死吧
Go suck your hat

332
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:11,896
我们目前不能接电话 我们有家人逝世
We can't come to the phone now. We've had a death in the family.

333
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:16,801
一定是布费利弄出的好事
Ferris Bueller is behind this, there is no doubt in my mind

334
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:21,629
 现在白思朗也同流合污  还有她的外婆
 Now Sloane Peterson is involved  Her grandmother, too

335
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:24,246
你这呆子
You pinhead

336
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:28,282
若想找我们，请拨以下号码
If you need to reach us, we'll be at the following number.

337
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:41,389
我能当上训导主任 自有过人之处
I did not achieve my position by having a punk leave my cheese in the wind

338
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:46,935
这是卡顿兄弟殡仪馆
You have reached the Carlton Brothers Mortuary.

339
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:51,597
请留下姓名和电话号码 我们很快会回覆你
If you leave your name and number, we'll get back to you.

340
00:33:56,113 --> 00:34:01,050
有不妥，我要找出是什么不妥
Something is going on, and I'm going to find out what it is

341
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:05,347
我要抓到这小子 毁掉他的前途
I'm going to catch this kid and put a dent in his future

342
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:10,720
15年后当他回看 自己失败一生…
15 years from now, when he looks back on the ruin his life has become, -

343
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:14,193
他会记得罗艾华
 he will remember Edward Rooney

344
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:37,979
 不行  什么？
 Wrong  What?

345
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:41,954
不是这里 我们不会把车子停在这里
Not here We're not leaving the car here

346
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,095
 为什么？  我要把它停在所属的地方
 Why not?  I want the car home where it belongs

347
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,822
 走吧  停在车房里不会有事的
 Let's go  What can happen in a garage?

348
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:55,596
车子可能遭毁坏、被偷去 遭刮花、有黑烟
It could get wrecked, stolen, scratched, breathed on wrong

349
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:59,469
 甚至有雀粪  冷静
 A pigeon could shit on it  Calm down

350
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:02,305
我会给那厮五元看管车子
I'll give the guy a fiver to watch it

351
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:05,140
什么那厮？
What guy?

352
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,757
你好吗？你会说英语吗？
Hey, how are you doing? You speak English?

353
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:20,358
你以为这是什么国家？
What country do you think this is?

354
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:25,534
好，我想你特别照顾这辆汽车
Okay, I want you to take extra special care of this vehicle

355
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:28,602
没问题，相信我
No problem Trust me

356
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:34,219
 先生  来吧
 Sir  Come on

357
00:35:44,988 --> 00:35:47,786
放心
Relax

358
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:56,759
你绝对不用担心，我是专业
You have nothing to worry about I'm a professional

359
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,654
什么专业？
A professional what?

360
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,484
有钱使得鬼推磨
See what a finski can do to a guy's attitude?

361
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:18,520
来吧
Come on

362
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:35,420
希望他没事
Bless his little heart

363
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,906
九次
Nine times.

364
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:35,790
 你认为车子有没有事？  当然没有
 You think the car's all right?  Sure

365
00:38:35,993 --> 00:38:40,054
 这是全球最高的大厦  我觉得不大舒服
 This is the world's tallest building  I don't feel too good

366
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,231
来，像这样爬上去
Here, climb up on this

367
00:38:47,638 --> 00:38:50,937
大家都来吧，马伦
Come on, everybody Cameron

368
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:56,208
好，身子向前倾 像这样抵著玻璃窗
Okay, lean forward against the glass like this

369
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:02,543
 天啊  是否很棒？
 Oh, my God!  Isn't that great?

370
00:39:02,752 --> 00:39:05,949
从这儿看，全城看似很平静
The city looks so peaceful from up here

371
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:10,512
由1353英尺高空看下去 什么也似很平静
Anything is peaceful from 1,353 feet

372
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:17,600
 我好像看到老爸  我们还有很多事要做，走吧
 I think I see my dad  We've got a lot to do Let's go

373
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:23,239
这混蛋一定在某处
Shit! The son of a bitch is down there somewhere

374
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:47,886
 你想不想结婚？  想
 You want to get married?  Sure

375
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:52,553
就在今天？我是认真的
Today? I'm serious

376
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:57,105
 我不想结婚  为什么？
 I'm not getting married  Why not?

377
00:39:57,307 --> 00:40:02,108
 考虑一下  我除了太年轻…
 Think about it  Besides being too young

378
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:04,974
又没地方住…
Having no place to live

379
00:40:05,181 --> 00:40:08,947
你亦会成为唯一有丈夫的 啦啦队队员外...
You being the only cheerleader with a husband

380
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:13,851
 说出一个为何不好的理由  看我的父母便可以
 Give me one good reason why not?  Look at my mother and father

381
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:19,955
 他们讨厌对方  那又怎样？
 They hate each other  So what?

382
00:40:20,196 --> 00:40:24,895
就像那辆法拉利 他爱那法拉利，却讨厌妻子
It's like that car He loves the car, he hates his wife

383
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:35,004
多谢
Thank you

384
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:54,625
可否离开这里？ 这儿令我毛骨悚然
Can we please get out of here? This place gives me the creeps

385
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:59,568
为何不早说我们要往…
Why didn't you tell me?

386
00:41:01,204 --> 00:41:04,867
 请问有什么可以效劳？  有的
 Hello, may I help you?  You can sure as hell try

387
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:09,136
我是霍艾比，订了12时，三位
I'm Abe Froman, party of three for 12

388
00:41:12,816 --> 00:41:17,014
 有问题吗？  你是霍艾比？
 Is there a problem?  You're Abe Froman?

389
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:24,319
 芝加哥香肠大王？  本人正是
 The sausage king of Chicago?  Yeah, that's me

390
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:30,557
我很忙碌，你们返回俱乐部吧
I'm very busy Why don't you kids go back to the clubhouse?

391
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,668
你以为我并非霍艾比？
Are you suggesting I'm not who I say I am?

392
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:40,275
你们最好在我发火前离开
I'm suggesting that you leave before I have to get snooty

393
00:41:40,477 --> 00:41:44,436
 艾比，走吧  我不会走的
 Okay, Abe, let's go  I'm not going anywhere

394
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:51,519
 请带我们就座  我要报警了
 No, we'd like to be seated  I'm going to have to call the police

395
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:55,248
 你要报警？  是的
 You're going to call the police?  Yes

396
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:59,952
 好极，让我亲自动手  好的
 Fine! I'll call them myself  Yes

397
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:04,605
报警吧，你们定会成为笑柄
Call the police This'll be a hoot

398
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:15,778
拿电话来，有来电
Give me the phone I have another call

399
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:20,348
你碰我，我就大叫 用别的电话
You touch me, I yell rat Find another phone

400
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,212
好极了
Wonderful

401
00:42:24,187 --> 00:42:27,816
我为未来悲哀
I weep for the future

402
00:42:30,093 --> 00:42:34,860
 费利，走吧  你太过分了
 Ferris, let it go  Please, you've gone too far

403
00:42:35,098 --> 00:42:38,363
你会被警察抓的
You're going to get busted

404
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:44,030
首先，并没所谓过分这回事 而且我也不会被这种人抓到
You can never go too far, and I won't be busted by a guy like that

405
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,540
 走吧，艾比  请霍艾比听电话
 Come on, Abe!  Ask for Abe Froman

406
00:42:48,745 --> 00:42:51,839
 你好  请替我找霍艾比？
 Chez Quis?  May I speak to Abe Froman?

407
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:59,117
 芝加哥香肠大王  让我找找看
 The sausage king of Chicago  Let me check the restaurant

408
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:03,259
 可否形容一下他的外貌？  他穿皮夹克
 Could you describe him for me?  Leatherjacket

409
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:05,950
白色汗衫，冷背心
White T-shirt, sweater vest.

410
00:43:06,196 --> 00:43:09,577
十分之英俊
Devastatingly handsome

411
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:14,414
 请等一下  劳驾
 Hold on one moment.  Thank you

412
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:28,449
霍，我是芝加哥警局的白沙展
Froman, this is Sergeant Peterson, Chicago Police.

413
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:36,158
 谢谢你明白事理  别客气
 I appreciate your understanding  Don't think twice

414
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,957
明白事理令我们这种人 容忍像你这类人
Understanding allows people like us to tolerate a person like yourself

415
00:43:45,735 --> 00:43:48,670
 谢谢  何足挂齿
 Thank you  Don't mention it

416
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:55,273
请慢用午餐
Enjoy your luncheon

417
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:58,572
宝贝，你真棒
Darling, you were wonderful

418
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:13,159
马伦，你不该以为 我们不会玩得开心
Cameron, you thought we wouldn't have any fun Shame on you

419
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:24,203
或许我反应过激 或许费利不是那么差劲
Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe Ferris isn't such a bad guy.

420
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:28,707
毕竟我得到车子，他只有电脑
After all, I got a car. He got a computer.

421
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:34,645
但为何他可以随心所欲？
Still, why should he get to do whatever he wants?

422
00:44:34,851 --> 00:44:38,150
为何他用一切都那么顺利？
Why should everything work out for him?

423
00:44:38,354 --> 00:44:41,585
他有啥特别？
What makes him so goddam special?

424
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,759
去死吧
Screw him

425
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:50,161
我还以为只有我家是怪家庭 跟著我看到马伦的家
I used to think that my family was the only one with weirdness in it

426
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:55,861
 他的家庭生活实在匪夷所思
Then I saw Cameron's family His home life is really twisted

427
00:44:56,105 --> 00:44:59,939
所以他老是生病 他的家庭生活困扰著他
That's why he's sick all the time It really bothers him

428
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:03,670
他病倒反而觉得更好
He feels better when he's sick

429
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,783
若我住在他的家 我也恨不得快些病倒
If I had to live in that house, I'd pray for a disease, too

430
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:14,117
那儿就像博物馆，很美，很冷
The place is like a museum It's very beautiful and very cold

431
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:17,293
你不许碰任何东西
You're not allowed to touch anything

432
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:23,125
若你是个婴孩 住在那里会怎样呢？
Can you appreciate what it must have been like to be there as a baby?

433
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:31,240
能弄到那辆车，我自己也惊讶 我看过假装马伦驾驶它
I'm amazed that I got the car out I caught Cameron digging the ride

434
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:34,968
今次这经验有助他 应付自己的恐惧
It's good for him It teaches him to deal with his fear

435
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:40,082
还有，坦白说…
Plus, I must be honest here

436
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:43,947
我爱驾驶它，那是多么有型
I love driving it It is so choice

437
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:48,954
我强烈建议你们 也试找辆来驾驶一下
If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up

438
00:45:49,158 --> 00:45:53,060
 劳驾  多谢
 Thank you  Yes, sir

439
00:46:04,407 --> 00:46:07,137
珍妮，又有谁烦著你？
Jeanie, who's bothering you now?

440
00:46:07,343 --> 00:46:10,540
 罗先生在么？  不在，我可以帮忙么？
 Is Mr Rooney in?  No, can I help you?

441
00:46:10,747 --> 00:46:14,808
 没有，他何时会回来？  不晓得
 I doubt it When is he back?  I don't know

442
00:46:15,017 --> 00:46:19,181
 他因私务外出  什么意思？
 He's out on personal business  What's that supposed to mean?

443
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:23,655
即是说不关你的事
I suppose it means it's none of your business, young lady

444
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:27,825
态度真好
Nice attitude

445
00:46:28,064 --> 00:46:32,967
 你不是要上夏太太的课吗？  也许是吧
 Is Mrs Hagel expecting you in class?  Probably

446
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:39,739
真讨厌
What an asshole

447
00:46:39,942 --> 00:46:44,777
 增加你们的广告预算  我们没有钱
 Raise your advertising budget  We don't have the money

448
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:49,442
有付出才有收获，就这么简单
If you want to sell, you have to spend It's as simple as that

449
00:46:49,652 --> 00:46:54,204
这区有4000间食肆 我偏选中我爸吃午餐那一间
4,000 restaurants in the area I pick the one my father goes to

450
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:56,886
我们今次死定了
We're pinched for sure

451
00:46:57,093 --> 00:47:01,359
胆小的人才会死 勇敢的人会活下来，走吧
Only the meek get pinched The bold survive Let's go

452
00:47:01,597 --> 00:47:04,498
 我们投降吧  绝对不行
 Let's surrender  Never

453
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:13,505
大卫，事情并非这样
Dave, I'm telling you that it's not the case

454
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:19,447
 我们没有钱  大卫，你也知道要多少钱啊
 We don't have the money  Dave, you know what it takes

455
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:25,632
我们会集中在电视上宣传 亦会在电台和报刊卖广告
We're going to go heavy on TV We'll lighten up on radio and print

456
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:28,590
来我的办公室
Come on back to my office

457
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:32,591
我们知道他是有钱的 只是不肯花费
We know you've got the money We just have to spend it bonehead!

458
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:28,974
布费利
Bueller.

459
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:45,567
即是说你完蛋了
Lesjeux sont faits. Translation: The game is up

460
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:49,202
你屁股要开花了
Your ass is mine

461
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:19,728
跑垒者在一垒，没有人出局
Runner at first base, nobody out.

462
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:26,807
这是第五局的首个安打 亦是全场比赛的第四个安打
The first hit since the fifth inning, only the fourth hit in the game.

463
00:49:28,544 --> 00:49:33,004
没有人上垒，两人出局 要得分了，左边
0 and 2 the count. There's a drive. Left field.

464
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:36,707
出界
Twisting into foul territory.

465
00:49:38,554 --> 00:49:44,220
他们竟在那局不思进取
I'm really surprised they didn't go for it in that inning.

466
00:49:44,427 --> 00:49:47,294
 比数是？  0比0
 What's the score?  Nothing-nothing

467
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:51,227
 谁占优？  熊人队
 Who's winning?  The Bears

468
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:11,418
 我的拇指好像断了  挥棒…击球…
 I think I broke my thumb  Hey, batter, batter Swing, batter

469
00:50:18,561 --> 00:50:22,520
救救费利

470
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:28,534
若我们循规蹈矩的话 现在应在上体育课
Do you realise that if we played by the rules, right now we'd be in gym?

471
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:40,049
来，努力
Come on, boys, let's go

472
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:44,317
我们要出人头地，努力
We'll never get out of here Move!

473
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,360
我讨厌他
I hate him

474
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:38,940
谁呀？
Who is it?

475
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:47,276
是罗艾华，我想跟你谈谈
It's Ed Rooney, Ferris I'd like to have a word with you

476
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:52,682
抱歉，我不能出来 我的情况很坏...
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door right now. In my weakened condition -

477
00:51:52,888 --> 00:51:58,087
下楼梯时我可能会跌倒 并要多休息数天
 I could take a spill down the stairs and suffer further school absences.

478
00:51:58,294 --> 00:52:02,731
 少来这套，下来  到我父母工作的公司找他们
 Save it, Ferris Come down here  You can reach my parents at work.

抱歉，我不能出来 我的情况很坏...
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door right now. In my weakened condition -

 I could take a spill down the stairs and suffer further school absences.

00:53:23,913 --> 00:53:26,313
尽是泥...
Mud

491
00:53:53,075 --> 00:53:56,044
讨厌
Son of a bitch!

492
00:54:05,721 --> 00:54:08,747
我的鞋子
My shoe

493
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:48,819
小狗，你好
Hi, doggy

494
00:55:52,194 --> 00:55:54,958
别动
Stay, boy

495
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:58,291

496
00:55:58,534 --> 00:56:02,101
坐下
Sit!

497
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:06,736
坐下，蹲著，别动
Sit! Heel! Stay!

498
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:34,026
 还是快些去拿车子吧  六时才够钟
 We'd better go and get the car  We have until six

499
00:58:34,232 --> 00:58:40,728
我知道你一于少理 但这可与我生死攸关
I know you don't care, but it does mean my ass

500
00:58:40,972 --> 00:58:44,032
你这样说我很伤心
That hurts, Cameron

501
00:58:45,478 --> 00:58:49,209
 你今天看到什么？  没什么好的
 What have you seen today?  Nothing good

502
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:55,752
没什么？你这是什么意思？
Nothing! What do you mean, nothing good?

503
00:58:55,955 --> 00:58:59,516
我们什么好东西都见过了 我们走遍了全城
We've seen everything good, we've seen the whole city

504
00:58:59,592 --> 00:59:04,322
我们去过博物馆 看到很多无价艺术品
We went to a museum and saw priceless works of art

505
00:59:04,414 --> 00:59:10,665
什么事？有何不妥？
What? What's wrong?

506
00:59:15,273 --> 00:59:18,265
看那边
Look over there

507
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:55,538
 他在做什么？  他在弄不文手势
 What's he doing?  He's making obscene gestures

508
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,680
什么
What?

509
01:00:07,126 --> 01:00:10,926
病态年轻人在社区结集

510
01:00:34,919 --> 01:00:39,219
 他没有离开  很拥挤
 He didn't leave  It really busts my hump

511
01:00:39,425 --> 01:00:44,658
 他不会丢下我们的  他或许已返回学校
 He didn't ditch us  He might be back at school

512
01:00:44,864 --> 01:00:52,566
 他不会返回学校的  他这样做以令我不安
 He would not go back to school  He'd do it just to make me sweat

513
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:58,108
各位，我们想为大家演奏
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to play a little tune for you.

514
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:05,579
我把这曲送给一位 以为今天不好玩的男士
I dedicate it to a man who doesn't think he's seen anything good today.

515
01:01:05,785 --> 01:01:08,686
范马伦，这曲是送给你的
Cameron Frye, this one is for you.

516
01:01:14,376 --> 01:01:18,756
 下来吧  你在做什么？
 Get off the float!  What are you doing?

517
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:04,838
他做每一件事都那么顺利
As long as I've known him, everything works for him

518
01:02:05,076 --> 01:02:09,513
没什么事他处理不了 我则什么也处理不了
There's nothing he can't handle I can't handle anything

519
01:02:09,748 --> 01:02:15,209
学校、父母、未来 费利无所不能
School, parents, the future Ferris can do anything

520
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:24,161
 我不知道自己未来该做什么  上大学
 I don't know what I'm going to do  College

521
01:02:24,362 --> 01:02:27,354
是的，但上大学做什么？
Yeah, but to do what?

522
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:33,264
你对什么有兴趣？
What are you interested in?

523
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:37,301
对什么也没兴趣
Nothing

524
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:40,841
我也是
Me neither

525
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:48,552
你疯了
You're crazy!

526
01:02:50,456 --> 01:02:54,449
你认为费利会做什么？
What do you think Ferris is going to do?

527
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:58,891
他会成为厨师
He's going to be a fry cook

528
01:05:47,866 --> 01:05:53,065
祝早日康复 英文系职员上

529
01:05:54,506 --> 01:05:56,474
老天...
Christ

530
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:08,851
看艾华叔叔有什么给你
Look what Uncle Ed has for you, you little fucker

531
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,827
天啊
Jesus!

532
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:21,863
救救费利

533
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:27,561
安睡吧
Sleep tight, pooch

534
01:06:52,197 --> 01:06:54,563
我早知道是这样
I knew it!

535
01:07:04,642 --> 01:07:08,544
她在哪儿？我是她的女儿
Well, where is she? This is her daughter

536
01:07:13,418 --> 01:07:18,014
知不知道她在哪里？何时回来
Do you know where she is? Do you know when she'll be back?

537
01:07:18,223 --> 01:07:21,420
你究竟知道什么？
Do you know anything?

538
01:08:09,407 --> 01:08:13,434
 费利  布
 Ferris  Bueller

539
01:08:34,432 --> 01:08:38,129
你这疯子，你完全疯了
You're psychotic You're out of your mind

540
01:08:38,336 --> 01:08:42,932
你竟然上了巡游车队
I can't believe you went on a goddam parade float!

541
01:08:43,174 --> 01:08:45,870
慢著
Okay, wait

542
01:08:46,111 --> 01:08:51,981
这曲是我的至爱
"Yeah, this tune is one of my personal favourites"

543
01:08:52,183 --> 01:08:56,176
 有很多人会看到你啊  你死定了
 A lot of people saw you  You are nailed

544
01:08:56,388 --> 01:08:59,323
有谁会相信我参加巡游？
Who'd believe I was in a parade?

545
01:08:59,524 --> 01:09:04,826
要抓我的人都不会参加巡游
Anybody who would nail me wouldn't go to a parade

546
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:08,022
很快啊
That was so quick

547
01:09:08,889 --> 01:09:16,303
 我觉得没有不妥  似乎没什么，走吧
 This looks okay to me, Cameron  It looks great Let's roll

548
01:09:16,374 --> 01:09:19,343
给你的，劳驾
Here you go Thank you

549
01:09:19,544 --> 01:09:25,141
你真慷慨，请随时回来光顾
You're a very generous individual Come back anytime

550
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:28,376
 小心座位  对不起
 Watch the seat  Sorry

551
01:09:32,788 --> 01:09:37,614
再见
See you later

552
01:09:37,835 --> 01:09:43,700
我们一定要再来一次
We've got to do this again

553
01:09:46,471 --> 01:09:50,931
我并非报假案 的确有人闯入屋
This is not a phoney call There is an intruder, -

554
01:09:51,142 --> 01:09:56,478
是白种男性 在厨房里，可能有枪
 male Caucasian, possibly armed, in my kitchen

555
01:09:56,681 --> 01:10:00,173
我姓布
My name's Bueller

556
01:10:01,286 --> 01:10:05,313
你希望我弟弟快些康复？ 我现在有危险
You hope my brother's feeling better? I'm in danger!

557
01:10:05,523 --> 01:10:12,122
我很爱惜自己身体 不想受伤或被杀
I am very protective of my body I do not want it violated or killed

558
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:14,696
我需要帮忙
I need help!

559
01:10:14,899 --> 01:10:18,892
你懂英语吗？笨蛋
Speak any English? Dickhead

560
01:10:32,017 --> 01:10:38,183
若你仍在屋子里 告诉你我已报警
Excuse me, if you're still in the house, I'vejust called the police.

561
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:43,885
若你懂得想的话，就立即离开
If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll get out real quick.

562
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:49,328
我手上还有家父的手枪 和著疹
I also have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.

563
01:10:57,542 --> 01:11:00,909
慢著，那是我的车子 别拖走它
Wait, that's my car! I'll move it

564
01:11:02,001 --> 01:11:06,310
他拿了我的车匙
He got my keys

565
01:11:06,464 --> 01:11:09,812
你这呆子
You shithead!

566
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:23,398
我觉得很好，真的
I feel pretty good I feel real good

567
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:28,436
车房里的人十分好 我之前确有点担心他们
Those guys at the garage were nice I was a little worried about them

568
01:11:28,672 --> 01:11:31,835
但结果一切都很好
It turned out good

569
01:11:36,014 --> 01:11:38,642
喂
Hey

570
01:11:41,286 --> 01:11:44,016
 马伦  什么事？
 Cameron  Yeah?

571
01:11:44,222 --> 01:11:48,181
我们离开时车子走了多少里？
How many miles did you say this thing had on it when we left?

572
01:11:48,393 --> 01:11:53,194
126又3/10至4/10里左右
126 and halfway between three and four tenths

573
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:57,994
为何这样问？现在里数多少？
Why? How many miles are on it now?

574
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:04,703
马伦就在这时爆发了
Here's where Cameron goes berserk

575
01:12:24,429 --> 01:12:27,660
马伦，你没事吧？
Cameron, are you okay?

576
01:12:27,866 --> 01:12:31,302
别这样
Cut that out

577
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,329
谁呀？
Who is it?

578
01:12:35,573 --> 01:12:41,478
抱歉，我不能出来 我的情况很坏...
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door right now. In my weakened condition -

579
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,672
下楼梯时我可能会跌倒…
 I could take a spill down the stairs...

580
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:50,286
太好了，我有救了 谢天谢地
God bless the police I'm saved Thank you, God

581
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:56,049
 谢谢…  听说你不舒服
 Thank...  I heard that you were feeling ill

582
01:12:56,261 --> 01:12:59,492
头痛、发烧又发冷
headache, fever and a chill

583
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:02,758
我是来令你回复健康的
I came to help restore your pluck

584
01:13:02,967 --> 01:13:05,765
因为我是护士…
'cause I'm the nurse who likes to...

585
01:13:12,711 --> 01:13:16,306
似乎是真的
This may very well be for real

586
01:13:16,514 --> 01:13:19,608
他可能真的傻了
He might have blown a microchip or two

587
01:13:19,818 --> 01:13:25,313
他一向紧张兮兮 我只想令他放松一天
He's always been a little keyed up I just wanted to give him a good day

588
01:13:25,523 --> 01:13:28,924
我们快毕业了
We're going to graduate soon

589
01:13:29,127 --> 01:13:34,326
到暑假时，他和我都会工作
We'll have the summer He'll work and I'll work

590
01:13:34,532 --> 01:13:38,059
我们会在晚上和周末见面
We'll see each other at night and on the weekends

591
01:13:38,269 --> 01:13:42,000
跟著我们会分别到 不同学校升学
Then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another

592
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,403
基本上是这样
Basically that will be it

593
01:13:45,915 --> 01:13:50,576
思朗则是一个大问题
Sloane's as big a problem

594
01:13:50,648 --> 01:13:55,312
她尚有一年才高中毕业 我该怎处理呢？
She has another year of high school How do I deal with that?

595
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,889
我跟她求婚时是认真的
I was serious when I said I'd marry her I would

596
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:02,581
马伦？
Cameron?

597
01:14:02,794 --> 01:14:07,060
你听不听到？
Can you hear me?

598
01:14:07,265 --> 01:14:11,998
若明白的话就眨眼
Cameron, blink if you understand me

599
01:14:12,203 --> 01:14:17,470
马伦从没谈过恋爱 从没有人爱上他
Cameron has never been in love Well, nobody has been in love with him

600
01:14:17,709 --> 01:14:23,841
若情况没改善 他将与首个上床的女孩结婚
If things don't change for him, he's going to marry the first girl he lays

601
01:14:24,049 --> 01:14:28,577
她会视他如粪土，更会令他…
And she's going to treat him like shit, because she will have given him -

602
01:14:28,787 --> 01:14:34,248
噩梦成真，即是世界末日
 what he has built up in his mind as the end all, be all of our existence

603
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:36,893
她不会尊重他
She won't respect him

604
01:14:37,095 --> 01:14:42,226
因为你不会尊重奉承你的人
You can't respect somebody who kisses your ass It just doesn't work

605
01:14:42,434 --> 01:14:46,894
试别的方法吧，这样没效
Ferris, we'd better try something else This isn't working

606
01:14:52,022 --> 01:14:56,232
马伦，你好了点没有？
Are you feeling better, Cameron?

607
01:14:56,443 --> 01:15:02,044
进来，很舒服啊
Why don't you come in here? It's really nice

608
01:15:04,856 --> 01:15:10,453
不要紧，我也很容易发疯
Cameron, I can flip out real easy, too It's okay

609
01:15:11,763 --> 01:15:16,359
迟早所有人都会发疯
Sooner or later, everybody goes to the zoo

610
01:15:20,372 --> 01:15:25,901
或许他真的有病 他并非在折磨自己
Maybe he's really sick Maybe he isn't just torturing himself

611
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:14,013
马伦
Hey! Hey, Cameron!

612
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:19,127
马伦，醒来
Cameron, wake up

613
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:24,291
来，马伦，快醒吧
Come on, Cameron Wake up!

614
01:16:28,106 --> 01:16:33,567
 怎么了？  布费利，你实在是我的英雄
 What is that?  Ferris Bueller, you're my hero

615
01:16:33,812 --> 01:16:37,908
 你确很重视我啊  你这畜牲
 That was pretty impressive, man  You son of a bitch

616
01:16:45,857 --> 01:16:49,084
一点也不好笑
It's not funny

617
01:17:14,351 --> 01:17:18,185
毒品？
Drugs?

618
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,154
谢谢，但我不吸毒的
Thank you, no I'm straight

619
01:17:21,358 --> 01:17:24,555
我是问你是否因毒品被抓？
I meant, are you in here for drugs?

620
01:17:26,264 --> 01:17:28,926
 你为何在这里？  因为毒品
 Why are you here?  Drugs

621
01:17:29,134 --> 01:17:33,195
 我不知道自己为何在这里  你为何不回家？
 I don't know why I'm here  Why don't you go home?

622
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:38,351
你为何要多管闲事？
Why don't you put your thumb up your butt?

623
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:45,895
你的眼部化妆太浓
You wear too much eye make-up

624
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:53,555
我姐姐化妆太浓 人们以为她是妓女
My sister wears too much People think she's a whore

625
01:17:58,897 --> 01:18:03,095
 你不想跟我谈谈你的问题吗？  跟你谈？你说真的？
 You don't want to talk about it?  With you? Are you serious?

626
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,792
 当然  你去死吧
 I'm serious  Blow yourself

627
01:18:11,276 --> 01:18:15,975
好，你想知道问题出于哪里？
All right, you want to know what's wrong?

628
01:18:16,181 --> 01:18:19,912
我知道问题出于那里 但我想听你说出来
I know what's wrong I just want to hear you say it

629
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:23,986
总言之，我讨厌我的弟弟
In a nutshell, I hate my brother How's that?

630
01:18:24,189 --> 01:18:28,683
你炸死了他？
That's cool Did you blow him away or something?

631
01:18:28,892 --> 01:18:32,293
不，还未
No, not yet

632
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:38,993
他逃学，当我回家查看时 有人在屋里
He was ditching school When I went home to check, some guy was there

633
01:18:39,204 --> 01:18:42,666
警察以为我报假案所以抓我
The cops picked me up for making a phoney call

634
01:18:42,706 --> 01:18:47,143
你的弟弟逃学又与你何干？
What do you care if your brother ditches school?

635
01:18:47,344 --> 01:18:51,337
 人人都上学  你自己也可以逃学
 Everybody else has to go  You could ditch

636
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:56,953
 我会被发现的  说得对
 I'd get caught  Yes

637
01:18:57,155 --> 01:19:02,320
你愤怒的原因是 他逃学又没被发现？
You're pissed off because he ditches and doesn't get caught, is that it?

638
01:19:03,862 --> 01:19:06,524
 基本上是的  基本上是的
 Basically  Basically

639
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:11,793
 那问题出于你自己身上  什么？
 Your problem is you  Excuse me?

640
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:17,440
你该担心自己 而非担心你弟弟做什么
Worry about yourself, not about what your brother does

641
01:19:18,877 --> 01:19:23,473
 那不过是我个人见解  你是何许人？心理学家吗？
 That's just an opinion  What are you, a psychiatrist?

642
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:27,275
请别意见多多
Keep your opinions to yourself

643
01:19:30,255 --> 01:19:33,747
你该跟某人好好谈谈
There's somebody you should talk to

644
01:19:36,895 --> 01:19:40,353
若你是指费利，省一口气吧
If you say Ferris Bueller, you lose a testicle

645
01:19:40,565 --> 01:19:43,556
原来你认识他
Oh, you know him

646
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:54,975
那时候我不断想 希望一切都结束
That whole time I was just thinking things over

647
01:19:57,015 --> 01:20:00,678
我就像…在冥想
I was like meditating

648
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:06,851
我好像看到自己的内心
Then I sort of watched myself from inside

649
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:13,829
我发现害怕实在…太荒谬了
I realised it was ridiculous being afraid

650
01:20:14,032 --> 01:20:18,059
杞人忧天，希望自己死了等等
Worrying about everything Wishing I was dead

651
01:20:18,268 --> 01:20:21,533
我已厌倦了这样子
All that shit I'm tired of it

652
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:27,811
今天是我一生最精采一天
It was the best day of my life

653
01:20:30,814 --> 01:20:34,511
明年我将会怀念你们
I'm going to miss you guys next year

654
01:20:42,459 --> 01:20:47,590
马伦，可否问你一条问题？
Cameron, can I ask you a question?

655
01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:50,768
问吧
Yeah

656
01:20:50,969 --> 01:20:57,272
你有没有偷看我更衣？
Did you see me change out of my clothes by the jacuzzi?

657
01:20:57,374 --> 01:21:00,111
有没有？
Did you?

658
01:21:00,138 --> 01:21:06,851
你偷看我？ 我还以为你患上紧张症
You saw me? I thought you were catatonic

659
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:14,019
不要紧，我并不尴尬
That's okay I'm not embarrassed

660
01:21:14,027 --> 01:21:20,088
我还是去看看那辆法拉利
I better check on the car

661
01:21:32,543 --> 01:21:35,307
费利
Hey, Ferris!

662
01:21:35,512 --> 01:21:38,242
什么事？
Yeah?

663
01:21:39,283 --> 01:21:45,381
我们倒行，但里数并没倒退
The miles aren't coming off going in reverse

664
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:54,395
真的？那么有麻烦了
No I thought that might be a problem

665
01:21:54,598 --> 01:21:58,534
我们得弄开里程计 以人手把里数倒退
We have to open the odometer, roll it back by hand

666
01:21:59,803 --> 01:22:03,572
不，不用了
No, forget it

667
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:06,810
不用了
Forget it

668
01:22:10,748 --> 01:22:13,376
我要勇敢站起来
I've got to take a stand

669
01:22:17,488 --> 01:22:20,457
我是窝囊废
I'm bullshit

670
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,487
我什么也哑忍
I put up with everything

671
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:32,325
被老父操纵
My old man pushes me around

672
01:22:33,981 --> 01:22:38,392
我从没话事权
I never say anything

673
01:22:42,112 --> 01:22:46,276
有问题的不是他，是我
He's not the problem I'm the problem

674
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:54,651
我得有立场
I've got to take a stand

675
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:59,289
我得站起来对抗他
I've got to take a stand against him

676
01:23:01,733 --> 01:23:04,827
我不会坐以待毙…
I am not going to sit on my ass -

677
01:23:04,905 --> 01:23:08,868
不会任由宰割
 as the events that affect me unfold to determine the course of my life

678
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:14,002
我要站起来保护自己
I'm going to take a stand and defend it

679
01:23:14,021 --> 01:23:19,782
无论对与错 我也要保护自己的原则
Right or wrong, I'm going to defend it

680
01:23:29,494 --> 01:23:32,463
我已厌了这废铁
I'm so sick of this shit

681
01:23:32,663 --> 01:23:35,328
我再不能忍受他 我讨厌他的车子
I can't stand him and I hate this goddam car

682
01:23:35,417 --> 01:23:39,865
你爱谁？你爱上一辆车
Who do you love? You love a car

683
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:43,164
你这畜牲
You son of a bitch

684
01:24:04,928 --> 01:24:07,055
糟了
Shit

685
01:24:08,766 --> 01:24:12,395
我把他的爱车弄成这样子
I dented the shit out of it

686
01:24:15,606 --> 01:24:18,006
好极
Good

687
01:24:19,502 --> 01:24:25,373
我爸会看到我做过什么
My father will see what I did I can't hide this

688
01:24:27,418 --> 01:24:32,014
他回家之后就要会整治我
He'll come home and he'll have to deal with me

689
01:24:32,222 --> 01:24:35,521
我不管，我真的不管
I don't care I really don't

690
01:24:35,726 --> 01:24:39,662
我已厌了担惊受怕
I'm just tired of being afraid

691
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:48,400
管他的
The hell with him

692
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:53,910
我恨不得快些看到他样子
I can't wait to see the look on his face

693
01:25:23,307 --> 01:25:26,242
我做了什么？
What did I do?

694
01:25:34,985 --> 01:25:41,205
 我做了什么？  你把车子变成废铁
 What did I do?  You killed the car

695
01:26:17,895 --> 01:26:20,659
哗
Whoa!

696
01:26:20,956 --> 01:26:25,248
老天
Holy shit!

697
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:42,007
这是我的错，我会承担责任
It's my fault I'll take the heat for it

698
01:26:42,219 --> 01:26:48,283
他回家后，对他说是我做的 反正他一直讨厌我
When he comes home, we'll tell him that I did it He hates me anyway

699
01:26:52,429 --> 01:26:55,312
不，让我负责任
No, I'll take it

700
01:26:55,532 --> 01:27:00,204
 让我来吧  但今次非同小可
 I'll take it  No, you don't want this much heat

701
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:03,671
若我怕负责 就不会让你驶走那辆车
If I didn't want it, I wouldn't have let you take the car

702
01:27:03,907 --> 01:27:10,870
 是我令你驶走那辆车的  我大可以阻止你
 I made you take that car  I could have stopped you

703
01:27:11,115 --> 01:27:14,414
就让我承担责任吧
I want it I'm going to take it, that's it

704
01:27:15,586 --> 01:27:20,785
摩利回家后，我们会好好谈谈
When Morris comes home, he and I will just have a little chat

705
01:27:22,926 --> 01:27:26,794
妙极，不，真的棒极
It's cool No, it's going to be good

706
01:27:27,898 --> 01:27:31,183
谢谢你
Thanks anyway

707
01:27:38,641 --> 01:27:43,078
我很震惊 首先，我不知为何她不在学校
This is a shock to me I don't know why she left school

708
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:47,808
亦不知为何她会编出 有人闯入的故事
And why would she come up with a story about an intruder?

709
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:51,954
无论为什么，她确受了惊
For whatever reason she did it, she's had a scare

710
01:27:52,156 --> 01:27:59,392
谢谢你来电 我们会好好跟她谈谈
I appreciate you calling We'll have a long talk with her at home

711
01:27:59,596 --> 01:28:01,860
谢谢
Thank you

712
01:28:01,999 --> 01:28:05,662
 希望令O快些康复  什么？
 I hope your son is feeling better  Pardon?

713
01:28:05,869 --> 01:28:10,101
转告他警局内的人都为他打气
Tell him all the guys at the station are pulling for him

714
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,207
好的
Right

715
01:28:20,683 --> 01:28:23,675
 嗨  别“嗨”我
 Hi  Don't "hi" me, young lady

716
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:26,006
我想立即离开这里
I want to get out of here now Now

717
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:30,622
好的…
Okay Fine!

718
01:28:37,368 --> 01:28:41,634
 她有点神经过敏  是的
 She's a little hyper  Yeah

719
01:28:43,849 --> 01:28:48,878
我们还是不要滔滔不绝说下去
Let's not ruin this with a lot of talk, okay?

720
01:28:49,113 --> 01:28:54,176
 你还没告诉我你名字  我叫珍妮
 You didn't tell me your name  It's Jean

721
01:28:54,385 --> 01:28:58,446
但男孩大多叫我做桑娜
But a lot of guys call me Shauna

722
01:28:58,655 --> 01:29:02,557
 好的，珍妮  好极
 Okay, Jean  Cool

723
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,456
好
That's great

724
01:29:05,662 --> 01:29:09,154
迟些见
I'll see you, okay?

725
01:29:12,436 --> 01:29:15,064
珍妮，走吧
Jeanie, now!

726
01:29:15,272 --> 01:29:18,298
 立即  好的
 Now!  Okay

727
01:29:26,749 --> 01:29:31,311
 我今天玩得很开心  的确不错
 I had a great time today  Yeah, it was pretty cool

728
01:29:33,756 --> 01:29:36,623
马伦不会有事吧？
Will Cameron be okay?

729
01:29:36,827 --> 01:29:41,093
一生以来第一次没有事
Yeah, sure, for the first time in his life

730
01:29:41,298 --> 01:29:43,960
他不会有事的
He's going to be just fine

731
01:29:50,673 --> 01:29:55,042
你今早醒来时 知否自己会做什么？
You knew what you were doing when you woke up this morning

732
01:29:55,245 --> 01:29:58,078
我？不知道
Me? No

733
01:30:17,034 --> 01:30:19,002
糟了
Oh, shit!

734
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:22,862
我要走了
I have to go

735
01:30:22,972 --> 01:30:26,339
 我今晚致电你  好的
 I'll call you tonight  Okay

736
01:30:29,012 --> 01:30:33,039
 我爱你  我也爱你
 I love you  I love you, too

737
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:35,684
他会跟我结婚
He's going to marry me

738
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:45,189
你知否往警局接女儿的滋味？
Do you know what it's like to pick up your daughter at the police station?

739
01:30:45,396 --> 01:30:51,596
我本来快要跟 佛蒙特的人达成协议
I was about to close the deal with the Vermont people

740
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:58,704
我本来快要收到佣金 给你小弟买辆车
I was going to take my commission and buy Ferris a car

741
01:30:58,942 --> 01:31:03,677
你究竟在搞什么？想拖垮全家
What the hell are you doing? Are you trying to kill us?

742
01:31:03,746 --> 01:31:09,107
看这儿一团糟 我怎也不能再整理好这些
Look at this mess I'll never get these papers back in order

743
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:31,000
 慢些  你不断骂我，我驾不了车
 Slow down  I can't drive with you yelling at me!

744
01:32:00,803 --> 01:32:05,580
你们好，我叫布费利
Hi, I'm Ferris Bueller

745
01:33:31,962 --> 01:33:36,092
别起来，很香
No, don't get up That smells delicious

746
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,667
 晚餐准备好了  什么？那是谁？
 Dinner's ready  What? Who was that?

747
01:34:12,236 --> 01:34:14,727
有什么不妥？
What's wrong?

748
01:34:14,937 --> 01:34:19,772
一切也不妥 我刚往警局接珍妮回来
Everything I just picked up Jeanie at the police station

749
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:26,444
她接获超速告票 我则因她失去了佛蒙特那交易
She got a speeding ticket and I lost the Vermont deal because of her

750
01:34:33,856 --> 01:34:36,916
是否在找这个？
Looking for this?

751
01:34:47,171 --> 01:34:49,731
我抓到你了，费利
I got you, Ferris

752
01:34:49,972 --> 01:34:54,033
费利怎样？我们去看看他吧
How's Ferris? Let's go in and check on him

753
01:34:54,278 --> 01:35:00,511
我一直梦想有这么一天 而今次…
I have dreamed about this And this time

754
01:35:00,547 --> 01:35:06,384
你这小鬼就被我人脏俱获
you little bastard, I've got you right where I want you

755
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:09,582
费利，我们回家了
Ferris, we're home

756
01:35:09,607 --> 01:35:17,964
留级一年，我亲自监督你
How would you feel about another year at high school?

757
01:35:18,167 --> 01:35:22,900
你觉得怎样？
Under my close, personal supervision?

758
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:25,131
你好
Hi

759
01:35:27,511 --> 01:35:32,471
幸好你没事，我们担心死了
Thank God you're all right We've been worried sick about you

760
01:35:36,085 --> 01:35:39,885
罗先生，谢谢你送他回家
Thank you, Mr Rooney, for driving him home

761
01:35:40,089 --> 01:35:43,547
快上床睡觉
Go upstairs and get in bed

762
01:35:54,805 --> 01:35:57,467
快
Scoot!

763
01:35:57,708 --> 01:36:03,112
他病得那么重 竟还想由医院步行回家
Can you imagine someone that sick trying to walk home from hospital?

764
01:36:03,347 --> 01:36:05,747
小孩子真是的
Kids!

765
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:12,019
说开又说，你把钱包遗在厨房
By the way, you left your wallet on the kitchen floor

766
01:37:18,287 --> 01:37:20,881
乖儿子
Honey

767
01:37:21,090 --> 01:37:24,958
 他仍然很热  你觉得怎样？
 He's still awfully warm  How do you feel?

768
01:37:25,162 --> 01:37:28,825
好得多
150% better, thank you

769
01:37:29,031 --> 01:37:35,266
别再要我留在家了，我要上学
Don't make me stay home again I want to go to school

770
01:37:35,471 --> 01:37:40,374
我得在6月毕业，而且…
I have to graduate in June, and I

771
01:37:40,576 --> 01:37:45,536
费利，你有病，别勉强 否则弄坏身体
Ferris, you're sick Don't push it and make yourself worse

772
01:37:45,782 --> 01:37:49,843
 或许你说得对  我当然说得对
 Maybe you're right, Dad  I know I'm right, pal

773
01:37:50,052 --> 01:37:57,176
 你怎会那么可爱？  日子有功
 How did you get to be so sweet?  From years of practice

774
01:38:05,323 --> 01:38:08,530
毛毯…
Blanket

775
01:38:17,648 --> 01:38:19,912
快些休息
Get well

776
01:38:24,588 --> 01:38:30,288
我安顿好后会弄碗汤给你
I'm going to get myself settled, then I'll bring you a hot cup of soup

777
01:38:39,236 --> 01:38:45,197
我之前已说过，并会再说一遍 人生匆匆
