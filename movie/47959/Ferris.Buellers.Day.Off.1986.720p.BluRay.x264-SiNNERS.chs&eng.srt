1
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:23,124
芝加哥今日天朗气清 气温在70度以上
It is a beautiful day in Chicago. Temperatures in the upper 70's.

2
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,070
目前在湖畔的气温是75度 中途岛73度，奥黑尔73度
Right now, 75 at the lakefront, 74 at Midway, 73 at O'Hare.

3
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:37,948
汤姆
Tom!

4
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:44,148
- 什么事？ - 是费利，看他的样子
- What's the matter? - It's Ferris Look at him

5
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,289
费利？
Ferris?

6
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:54,523
他没有发烧 但胃痛又头晕眼花
He doesn't have a fever, but his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots

7
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:58,669
- 费利，你没事吧？ - 爸爸？
- What's the matter, Ferris? - Papa?

8
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:02,864
摸一下他双手，又冷又湿
Feel his hands, they're cold and clammy

9
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:10,806
- 我没事，我要起床 - 不行
- I'm fine I'll get up - No!

10
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:14,281
- 我今天有测验 - 不行
- I have a test today - No

11
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:20,083
我一定要参加测验 我要进优秀大学，有丰盛人生
I must take it I want to go to a good college, so I can have a fruitful life

12
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:23,693
乖儿子，你这样子绝不能上学
Honey, you're not going to school like this

13
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:27,888
- 他怎么了？ - 他不舒服
- What's his problem? - He doesn't feel well

14
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:31,625
弄干你的手 湿得可以灌溉草地

15
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:31,522
Dry that one out, you can fertilise the lawn

16
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:36,069
珍妮，是你么？
Jeanie, is that you?

17
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:39,836
你站到那么远，我看不清楚
I can't see that far Jeanie?

18
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:43,481
珍妮，我...
Jeanie, I

19
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,746
- 老弟，别装蒜 - 珍妮，快上学去
- Bite the big one, junior - Jeanie, you get to school

20
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:56,690
就算我双眼流血，你们仍会 要我上学，这实在不公平

21
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:56,627
If I was bleeding out my eyes, you'd make me go to school It's so unfair

22
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:01,798
珍妮，别为我难过 你该庆幸自己那么健康
Jeanie, don't be upset with me You have your health, be thankful

23
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,273
够了，我不要再留在这个家
That's it! I want out of this family

24
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:18,679
我没事的，我会继续睡 或许在正午左右吃止痛药
I'm okay I'll just sleep I'll have an aspirin around noon

25
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:23,878
我今天会带佛蒙特来的那家人 去看房子
I'm showing some houses to that family from Vermont today

26
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:29,322
若要找我，问我的同事便可以
My office will know just where I am if you need me

27
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:35,524
- 我会来电看你怎样 - 你们实在关心我
- I'll check on you too, pal - I have such loving, caring parents

28
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:39,670
你们实在太好人了
You're both very special people

29
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:48,540
- 多点休息吧，乖孩子 - 好的
- You get better, pumpkin - Okay, pumpkin

30
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:52,774
我会准六时回来 若有任何需要，记紧来电
I'll be home at six sharp If you need anything, call

31
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,453
打电话
Ringy-dingy

32
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,183
- 宝贝，再见 - 我也爱你们
- We love you, sweetie - I love you, too

33
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:06,731
有需要尽管来电
Call if you need us

34
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:17,400
他们上当了
They bought it

35
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:31,981
难以置信，我的表现那么不济 他们竟没怀疑
Incredible! A terrible performance, and they never doubted it for a second

36
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:41,022
像这样一天我怎能上学呢？
How could I be expected to handle school on a day like this?

37
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:56,112
这已是我在本学期第九次病倒 实在再难想出什么新病症来
This is my ninth sick day It's tough coming up with new illnesses

38
00:03:57,616 --> 00:04:02,110
第十次时可能要吐出肺部 所以，我要好好利用今天病假
If I go for ten, I'll have to barf up a lung So I'd better make this one count

39
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:07,856
湿而冷的双手 是骗倒父母的关键
The key to faking out the parents is the clammy hands

40
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,520
是"百搭"病徵，万试万灵
It's a good non-specific symptom I'm a big believer in it

41
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:16,393
很多人说装作发烧是最好方法
A lot of people will tell you to go for a phoney fever

42
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:23,268
但若你母亲太紧张的话 你可能要看医生，这样更糟
But if you get a nervous mother, you could wind up in a doctor's office

43
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:26,308
你装作胃抽筋
You fake a stomach cramp

44
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:30,948
在弯腰呻吟时，顺势舔湿手掌
When you're bent over wailing, you lick your palms

45
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,778
这样既幼稚又无聊 但上中学又何尝不是呢？
It's childish and stupid, but then, so is high school

46
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:39,716
人生匆匆
Life moves pretty fast

47
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:45,752
若你不偶尔停下来四处看看 会错过很多事
If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it

48
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,400
今天确有测验，我没有说谎
I do have a test today, that wasn't bullshit

49
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:54,903
题目是欧洲社会主义 但测验有什么用呢？
It's on European socialism What's the point?

50
00:04:55,107 --> 00:05:00,374
我又不是欧洲人 管他是不是社会主义
I'm not European, so who gives a crap if they're socialists?

51
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:04,879
就算是法西斯无政府主义者 也无法令我有车代步
They could be fascist anarchists, it still wouldn't buy me a car

52
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:11,786
我记起秋天时的中央公园
I recall Central Park in fall

53
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,359
你怎样撕破自己的裙子 我承认，真是一团糟...
how you tore your dress what a mess, I confess...

54
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:28,232
我并非容忍法西斯主义 或任何主义
It's not that I condone fascism, or any "ism"

55
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,401
人不该相信什么主义 该相信自己
A person should not believe in an "ism", he should believe in himself

56
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:39,209
约翰连侬说过 我不相信披头四，我相信自己
I quote John Lennon: "I don't believe in Beatles I just believe in me"

57
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,252
有道理，毕竟他是海象
A good point there After all, he was the walrus

58
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:47,721
我也可以这样 但我仍要坐人家的顺风车
I could be the walrus, I'd still have to bum rides off people

59
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,521
艾当斯，艾当利
Adams Adamly

60
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:55,756
- 在 - 艾当基，艾当逊
- Here - Adamowlsky, Adamson

61
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:59,300
- 艾迪拿 - 在
- Adler - Here

62
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:03,770
- 安德逊，安德逊？ - 在
- Anderson Anderson? - Here

63
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:06,342
布费利
Bueller

64
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:10,006
布费利
Bueller

65
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:13,913
布费利…
Bueller Bueller

66
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:19,716
他病了，我好友妹妹的男友 的哥哥的女朋友
He's sick My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend -

67
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:25,761
看到费利昨晚在快餐店晕倒 情况好像颇为严重

68
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:25,765
- saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavours last night I guess it's pretty serious

69
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:29,957
- 谢谢你告诉我 - 别客气
- Thank you, Simone - No problem whatsoever

70
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,534
范马伦
Frye

71
00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:36,367
范马伦
Frye Frye

72
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,513
- 喂？ - 马伦，发生什么事？
- Hello? - Cameron, what's happening?

73
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:53,956
- 没什么 - 你觉得怎样？
- Very little - How do you feel?

74
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:57,458
- 完全崩溃 - 你妈妈在你房间么？
- Shredded - Is your mother in the room?

75
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:01,564
她在迪凯特 可惜她并非留在那儿
She's in Decatur Unfortunately she's not staying

76
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:07,836
- 你在哪里？ - 我休息一天，过来吧
- Where are you? - I'm taking the day off, come on over

77
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,771
- 不行，我病倒了 - 心理作用而已
- I can't, stupid, I'm sick. - That's all in your head

78
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:16,676
- 过来吧 - 我很不舒服，哪里也不能去
- Come on over. - I feel like shit I can't go anywhere

79
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:21,842
实在很遗憾，快驾车过来接我
I'm sorry to hear that Now come on over and pick me up

80
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,627
我快死了
I'm dying

81
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:43,400
不是的，你只是无所事事罢了
You're not dying. Youjust can't think of anything good to do.

82
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:48,780
马伦实在需要放假一天
Cameron really needs a day off

83
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:55,442
他在上大学前有很多东西 要搞清楚
He has a lot of things to sort out before he goes to college

84
00:07:55,654 --> 00:08:00,990
当马伦在埃及
When Cameron was in Egypt's land

85
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:07,256
让我的马伦走吧
let my Cameron go.

86
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,333
马伦紧张得很…
Cameron is so tight -

87
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:13,936
若把碳塞进他的屁股 会变成钻石
- that a lump of coal stuck up his ass would turn into a diamond

88
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:25,141
- 我是布凯蒂 - 我是训导主任罗艾华
- Katie Bueller - Edward Rooney, Dean of Students.

89
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,846
对不起，我忘了致电给你们
I'm so sorry I completely forgot to call

90
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:37,825
- 你知否令O今天没上学？ - 知道，费利病了，在家休息
- You know your son isn't in school? - Yes. Ferris is home sick.

91
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:43,865
我今早要开会 忘记致电你们，很抱歉
I had a meeting this morning. I forgot to call. I'm very sorry.

92
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:46,936
请问你知否…
Are you also aware -

93
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,838
费利的上课率并非太好？
- that Ferris does not have an exemplary attendance record.

94
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:54,034
什么？
What?

95
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:58,080
他有多天没上课
He has missed an unacceptable number of school days.

96
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:01,879
费利没有认真对待学业
Ferris is not taking his academic growth seriously.

97
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:07,115
我今早一直在翻查他的纪录
I've spent my morning examining his records

98
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:13,787
若费利以为他这样可顺利毕业 就大错特错了
If Ferris thinks he can coast through to graduation, he is sorely mistaken

99
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:17,058
我十分赞成…-
I have no reservation whatsoever-

100
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:21,467
把他留级
- about holding him back another year

101
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:26,007
- 我完全不知道这些事 - 通常都是这样的
- This is all news to me - It usually is

102
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:32,913
- 他在本学期已缺课了九次 - 九次？
- He has been absent nine times - Nine times?

103
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:37,316
- 九次 - 他并没病倒过九次
- Nine times - He hasn't been sick nine times

104
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:42,550
这大概因为他根本没有病 他逃学
That's probably because he wasn't sick, he was skipping school

105
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:45,628
清醒吧
Wake up and smell the coffee

106
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:49,858
他愚弄了你，他逃学
It's a fool's paradise He's leading you down the primrose path

107
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:54,003
- 我不相信 - 证据就在我面前
- I can't believe it. - It's right here in front of me

108
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,640
他已缺课了九天...
He has missed nine days

109
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:04,049
缺课次数，5，4，3，2...

110
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:09,719
我想要汽车，却得到一台电脑 真不幸
I asked for a car I got a computer How's that for being born unlucky?

111
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:11,980
姬丝
Grace!

112
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:21,526
罗先生，费利在家 他很不舒服
Mr Rooney, Ferris is home and he is very ill

113
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:25,930
- 我甚至不想抛下他一人 - 姬丝
- I debated even leaving him. - Grace!

114
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:30,073
每年这时候 孩子最容易不想上学
At this time of year, children are prone to taking the day off

115
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:34,713
但我可保证费利真的是不舒服
But I can assure you that Ferris is a very sick boy

116
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:42,648
无师自通
Never had one lesson

117
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:51,954
1930年，众议院为减轻什么？
In 1930 the House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of

118
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:54,166
有没有人知道？
Anyone?

119
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:59,998
减轻大萧条的影响 通过了什么？
The Great Depression Passed the anyone?

120
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:04,575
荷里史莫特关税法案
The Holly-Smoot Tariff Act

121
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:08,075
把关税调高或调低？
Which raised or lowered?

122
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,843
把关税调高以增加政府收入
Raised tariffs in an effort to collect more government revenue

123
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:18,284
有没有效呢？ 有没有人知道？
Did it work? Anyone know the effects?

124
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,120
没有效，美国更加萧条
It did not work and the United States sank deeper into the Depression

125
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:28,322
今日，我们亦有类似的辩论 有没有人知道是什么？
Today, we have a similar debate over this Anyone know what this is?

126
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:32,469
有没有人看过这个？
Anyone seen this before?

127
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,731
拉弗曲线 有没有人知道当中理论？
The Laffer curve Anyone know what this says?

128
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,967
理论指在收入曲线的这一点…
It says that at this point on the revenue curve -

129
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:45,172
你得到的收入会跟这一点一样
- you will get exactly the same amount of revenue as at this point

130
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:50,946
有没有人知道 副总统布殊在80年说过什么？
Does anyone know what Bush called this in 1980?

131
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:57,686
有没有人知道？什么经济？ 伏都经济
Anyone? Something-doo economics Voodoo economics

132
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,909
珍妮，我为你弟弟的事难过
Jeanie, I'm really sorry about your brother

133
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:16,274
你难过什么？ 要与他同住的是我
What are you sorry for? I have to live with him

134
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:20,679
- 我听闻他病得很重 - 谁说的？
- I heard he's really sick - Who said he's sick?

135
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:24,252
好些人说他快死了
A bunch of people say he's close to death

136
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:30,326
据闻若费利死了 他会把眼睛捐给史堤菲温达
I heard that if Ferris dies, he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder

137
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,986
他实在好心，再见
He's such a sweetie Got to go

138
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:37,531
- 珍妮 - 闭嘴
- Hi, Jeanie - Shut up

139
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:41,035
情况有多严重？
How desperate is the situation?

140
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,935
你有否看过异形？
Did you see "Alien"?

141
00:12:44,142 --> 00:12:47,908
记不记得当异形 破开那男人肚子出来的情形
When the creature was in that guy's stomach?

142
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:51,310
就是那样子了 新生
It feels like that Freshman

143
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:56,453
- 你说笑吧？ - 我似在说笑吗？
- Are you kidding? - Do I sound like I'm kidding?

144
00:12:56,654 --> 00:13:00,488
- 是布费利 - 他助我离开暑期学校
- It's Ferris Bueller - He got me out of summer school

145
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:05,652
谢谢你告诉我们你的病情
We appreciate you letting us know how you're doing.

146
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:10,700
他千万不要死 否则我今夏一定很难捱
I hope he doesn't die I can't handle summer school

147
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:15,032
- 叫别的人来听吧 - 好的，等一下
- Give me somebody else - Sure, hold on

148
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:19,403
-你有否看过异形？ -有，此话何解？
- Did you see "Alien"? - Yeah, why?

149
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:24,545
喂？费利，你的身体怎样？
Hello? Hi, Ferris, how's your bod?

150
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:28,185
你好像病得很重
You're dying?

151
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,486
- 严重么？ - 希望不严重
- Is it serious? - I hope not

152
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:41,825
- 我或需要换肾 - 天呀，你是否很不开心？
- I may need a kidney transplant - Shit! Are you upset?

153
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:46,131
- 对不起 - 你本周末还会活著么？
- Excuse me - Will you be alive this weekend?

154
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:50,535
- 会的 - 好极，或许到时来探望你吧
- Yeah, I'd say so - Great Maybe I'll see you

155
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:10,052
我绝对不相信这小子 我恨不得撵他走
I don't trust this kid any further than I can throw him

156
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:17,133
你膝部有旧患 不该撵走任何人
With your bad knee, Ed, you shouldn't throw anybody It's true

157
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:23,001
他最危险之处是教坏好学生
What is so dangerous about him is that he gives good kids bad ideas

158
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:30,138
我不想见到有1500个 布费利的信徒在学校四处走
The last thing I need is 1,500 Bueller disciples running around these halls

159
00:14:30,348 --> 00:14:34,114
他危害到我管理学生的能力
He jeopardises my ability to govern this student body

160
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:40,815
- 他令你看来像个傻瓜 - 谢谢，但你错了
- He makes you look like an ass - Thank you, but you're wrong

161
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:43,823
他很受欢迎
He's very popular

162
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:48,465
爱运动的、爱驾车的、古怪的 放荡的、爱浪费的…
Sportoes, motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wasteoids, -

163
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:53,831
爱哭的、愚蠢的，都喜欢他
- dweebies, dickheads, they all adore him

164
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,707
所以我才要抓到他
That is why I have got to catch him

165
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,007
向其他学生证明 他这样是没前途的
To show these kids that his example is a first-class ticket to nowhere

166
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:08,743
你活像“卑鄙哈利”啊
Ed! You sounded like Dirty Harry just then

167
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:12,389
真的？
Really?

168
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:18,453
过奖，姬丝
Thanks, Grace

169
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:24,396
- 你不能这样子要我等 - 让我安息吧
- You can't make me wait like this - Let me rot in peace.

170
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:31,235
这是我第九次病倒，若被抓到 便无法毕业，我是为了你冒险
It's my ninth sick day If I get caught, I won't graduate I'm doing this for you

171
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:35,469
- 知道什么是心律舒张期吗？ - 吃些消化药
- Do you know what my diastolic is? - Take some Pepto Bismal

172
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,446
- 快穿好衣服，然后过来 - 闭嘴
- Get dressed and come on over - Shut up

173
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:46,318
等一下，有人来电...喂？
Hold your water for a second I've got another call Hello?

174
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:53,794
- 费利，你似乎仍很不舒服 - 我还以为自己的情况好转
- Ferris. You sound terrible. - Darn, I thought I was improving.

175
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:57,593
- 你是否在睡觉？ - 爸爸，你可否等一下？
- Were you sleeping? - Dad, can you hang on for a second?

176
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:00,497
- 好的 - 等一下
- Sure, pal - Hang on

177
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:04,641
- 马伦，是我爸来的 - 好极，别拖我落水
- Cameron, it's my dad - Great Keep me out of it

178
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:10,906
若你在15分钟内还不过来 找另一个好朋友吧
If you're not over here in 15 minutes, you can find a new best friend

179
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:18,113
爸爸，跟你说话后 我又有点头晕
Dad, all this talking has made me kind of light-headed

180
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:23,818
- 我还是躺下 - 用热毛巾敷在额上
- I think I ought to lie down - Wrap a hot towel round your head

181
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:30,490
- 敷热毛巾 - 喝点热汤，然后再睡一会
- Wrap a hot towel round my head? - Make some soup, then get a nap

182
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:36,139
- 费利，好好休息 - 你真关心我
- Ferris, I love you, pal - I love you, too

183
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:45,575
我敢打睹马伦正坐在车里 盘算应否出门
I bet Cameron is sitting in his car debating whether or not to go out

184
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:53,649
他会不断来电至我往他那儿
He'll keep calling me until I come over

185
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:56,952
他会令我感内疚
He'll make me feel guilty

186
00:16:57,161 --> 00:17:01,564
实在荒谬，去吧
This is ridiculous I'll go I'll go

187
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,768
去吧，真气人
I'll go Shit!

188
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:12,672
怎么搞的
Goddammit!

189
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,554
算了
Forget it That's it

190
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:50,246
作者以什么方法...
In what way

191
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,745
用监狱去...
does the author's use of the prison

192
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,954
象徵...
symbolise

193
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:15,966
故事主人翁的挣扎？
the protagonist's struggle?

194
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:19,507
这样又跟我们所讨论的
And how does this relate -

195
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:24,080
讽刺手法有何关系呢？
- to our discussion of the uses of irony?

196
00:18:25,717 --> 00:18:29,346
卢先生，抱歉打扰你
Mr Nolan, may I interrupt, please?

197
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:39,530
白思朗，可否跟你谈谈？
Sloane Peterson, may I have a word with you, dear?

198
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:47,304
恐怕我有坏消息要对告诉你
I'm afraid that I am the bearer of bad tidings

199
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:52,772
令尊来电说你的外婆刚去世
Your father called Your grandmother has just passed

200
00:18:54,846 --> 00:19:00,785
- 不... - 真可怜
- No - Oh, darling! Honey

201
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:05,649
- 外婆死了？ - 白先生是这样说的
- Dead grandmother? - That's what Mr Peterson said

202
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:09,884
我叫了史兰丝通知她
I had Florence Sparrow notify the poor little lamb

203
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:15,225
- 她跟谁拍拖？ - 这些日子很难说啊
- Who is this girl going out with? - It's so hard to tell these days

204
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:19,300
但我见到她跟布费利来往颇密
I do see her with Ferris Bueller quite a bit

205
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:24,470
替我找白先生的联络电话号码
Would you get me Mr Peterson's daytime number?

206
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:30,137
- 罗艾华办公室 - 我是白佐治
- Ed Rooney's Office - This is George Peterson.

207
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:34,341
请稍等，是白先生来电
Please hold What do you know, it's Mr Peterson

208
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:40,014
还要不要他的联络电话号码？
Do you still want his daytime number?

209
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:47,963
- 我是罗艾华 - 我是白佐治
- Ed Rooney - Ed, this is George Peterson.

210
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:53,160
- 你好吗？ - 其实并不好
- How are you today, sir? - Well, we've had a bit of bad luck.

211
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:58,671
我有所听闻，请节哀顺变
Yeah, I heard I'm all broken up Boy, what a blow

212
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:02,540
今早真难熬
Yeah, it's been a tough morning.

213
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,716
我们有很多家事要办
We've got a lot of family business.

214
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:09,478
若你准许思朗休息，我很感激
If you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane, I'd appreciate it.

215
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:12,520
我乐意这样做
Sure, I'd be happy to

216
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:17,319
只要你给我看尸体 我就会让思朗走
You just produce a corpse, and I'll release Sloane

217
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:21,294
我要亲眼见到这死去的外婆
I want to see this dead grandmother first-hand

218
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:26,799
不要紧，是布费利 我在设陷阱
It's all right, it's Ferris Bueller I'm setting a trap for him

219
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:33,300
你是否说要看到尸体？
Ed, I'm sorry, did you say you wanted to see a body?

220
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:39,211
是的，送尸体来，我就放人
Yeah, roll her old bones over here and I'll dig up your daughter

221
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:43,046
这是学校政策，是你母亲么？
That's school policy Was this your mother?

222
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:46,280
不是，是内子的母亲
No, my wife's mother.

223
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:53,253
- 罗艾华办公室 - 我是布费利，想找罗先生
- Ed Rooney's Office - This is Ferris Bueller for Mr Rooney

224
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:59,134
稍等...
Hold

225
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:03,535
告诉你，笨蛋 若你不喜欢我的政策
I'll tell you what, dipshit, if you don't like my policies, -

226
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:08,337
你可以来这儿舐我的肥臀
- you can come down here and smooch my big old white butt

227
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:13,506
- 知道没有，什么事？ - 布费利在二线
- Pucker up, Buttercup What? - Ferris Bueller is on line two

228
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:29,727
罗先生，我今天不舒服
Mr Rooney, I'm not feeling very well today.

229
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:35,201
可否把我的家课交给我姐姐？
Could my sister bring home any assignments from my classes?

230
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:38,068
谢谢你，再见
Have a nice day.

231
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:57,559
白先生…我要向你道歉
Mr Peterson I think I owe you an apology

232
00:21:57,762 --> 00:22:02,165
- 当然 - 我...
- I should say you do - I

233
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:05,529
你早该向我道歉
I think you should be sorry, for Christ's sake

234
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:09,968
我的亲人死了，你却侮辱我 你怎么了？
A family member dies and you insult me! What's wrong with you?

235
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:14,270
其实...我也不知道
Well I really don't know

236
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:17,709
我以为我在跟别人说话
I didn't think I was talking to you.

237
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:25,618
我绝不会蓄意侮辱你的
You know that I would never deliberately insult you like that

238
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:30,851
恕我直言，你实在是个大笨蛋
Pardon my French, but you're an asshole! Asshole!

239
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:36,032
你说得对，快去找她
You're absolutely right, sir Find out where she is

240
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:40,795
- 我不会就此罢休，你听到没？ - 听得很清楚
- This isn't over yet Do you read me? - Loud and clear, Mr Peterson

241
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:45,135
- 叫我做先生 - 是的，先生
- Call me sir, goddammit! - Yes, sir

242
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:47,709
这样才像样
That's better.

243
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:52,281
你要打醒十二分精神 并记著你要应付的是谁
You mind your P's and Q's, and remember who you're dealing with

244
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:56,012
是布费利
Bueller Ferris Bueller

245
00:22:57,388 --> 00:23:00,357
我很害怕 若他认出我的声音那怎办？
I'm scared What if he recognises my voice?

246
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:03,994
没可能，你装得十分相像
Impossible You're doing great

247
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:15,932
罗，冷静
Rooney! Rooney, calm down

248
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:24,047
- 等一下 - 办公室小意外
- Just a moment - Just a little office difficulty

249
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:29,846
我没时间整天骂你，长话短说
I don't have all day to bark at you, so I'm going to make this short

250
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:35,185
我要小女在十分钟后 一个人在学校门口
I want my daughter out in front of the school by herself

251
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:39,486
- 什么事？ - 那样太惹人怀疑了
- What? - That's too suspicious

252
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,164
- 继续说 - 你
- Talk - You!

253
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:49,964
- 继续说 - 罗，你听著
- Talk! - Rooney! Pay attention

254
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:55,942
我要你陪她在校门 我有话要跟你说
I want you out there with her I want a few words with you

255
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:02,876
我们现在没时间 午饭时间再跟你说
We don't have time to talk right now We'll get together over lunch

256
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:08,191
- 你怎么了？ - 慢著
- What's wrong with you? - Wait!

257
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:13,261
- 你怎么搞的？ - 你为何踢我？
- Where's your brain? - Why did you kick me?

258
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:20,174
How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney is there with her?

259
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:20,096
若罗跟思朗一起，怎接她呢？

260
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:25,140
我说要她独个在校门 你又害怕
I said for her to be there alone and you freaked

261
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:30,411
我没有打你，不过轻力拍你
I didn't hit you I lightly slapped you

262
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:33,412
你有打我
You hit me

263
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:41,915
若你不喜欢我的方式 就别要我参与你的无聊大计
Don't ask me to participate in your crap if you don't like the way I do it

264
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:45,687
是你要我起床来这里
You make me get out of bed and come here

265
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,889
是你要我致电给罗艾华
You make me make a phoney call to Edward Rooney

266
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:53,035
那人可以把我置诸死地
The man could squash my nuts

267
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,571
- 而你竟然全不理会我的感受 - 我没有
- And you deliberately hurt my feelings - No

268
00:24:56,774 --> 00:25:02,474
我没有不理会你的感受
I did not deliberately hurt your feelings I didn't

269
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:09,679
- 你做什么？ - 再见，我回家了
- What are you doing? - See you later I'm going home

270
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:14,086
- 祝你好运 - 慢著
- Have a nice life - Cameron, wait a minute

271
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:19,691
I didn't mean to lose my temper I'm sorry, it was uncalled for

272
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:19,251
我不是有意发脾气，对不起

273
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:21,465
- 真的？ - 真的
- Seriously? - Yeah

274
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:34,042
- 来吧 - 劳驾
- Here you go - Thank you

275
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,983
但你的确弄砸了事情
You did screw up though, right?

276
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:46,919
- 但也不尽是你的错 - 为什么？
- Not that it was completely your fault - Why?

277
00:25:47,124 --> 00:25:53,586
为挽救这情况，我要你帮忙
To fix the situation, I'm going to have to ask you for a favour

278
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:16,478
那辆1961年250GT法拉利跑车
The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California

279
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:22,957
全球不足100辆
Less than a hundred were made

280
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,221
我爸爸用了三年修好它
My father spent three years restoring this car

281
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:30,922
那是他的至爱，他的命根
It is his love It is his passion

282
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:35,298
是他的错，他没锁好车房
It is his fault he didn't lock the garage

283
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:39,067
你在说什么？
Ferris, what are you talking about?

284
00:26:41,745 --> 00:26:44,373
我爸爸视这车如命
My father loves this car more than life

285
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:50,179
这样的男人配不上这种车
A man with such priorities doesn't deserve this fine automobile

286
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:53,349
不行
No

287
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:57,460
你似乎不明白
Apparently you don't understand

288
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:02,257
他从没驾驶过它 只以餐巾抹它
He never drives it He just rubs it with a diaper

289
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:08,671
记不记得我弄破了固体位时 他是多么的愤怒？
Remember how insane he went when I broke my retainer?

290
00:27:08,872 --> 00:27:13,673
那不过是块胶，而这是法拉利
That was a piece of plastic This is a Ferrari

291
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:19,310
我们不能用你的车去接思朗
We can't pick up Sloane in your car

292
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:24,579
罗不会相信白先生驾那辆废铁
Mr Rooney would never believe Mr Peterson drives that piece of shit

293
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:27,191
- It's not a piece of shit - It is

294
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:27,985
- 那并非废铁 - 是废铁

295
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:32,788
我连废铁也没有，我很羡慕你
Don't worry I don't even have a piece of shit I have to envy yours

296
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:38,408
I'm sorry There's nothing else we can do

297
00:27:34,632 --> 00:27:38,466
抱歉…已别无他法

298
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,115
- 他知道车子的里数 - 他不相信你吗？
- He knows the mileage - He doesn't trust you?

299
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:57,721
- 从不相信，亦永不会相信 - 其实很简单
- Never has, never will - This is real simple

300
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:01,721
只要把多走的里数删掉便是
Whatever miles we put on, we'll take off

301
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,454
- 我们倒驶它回家便行 - 不行
- We'll drive home backwards - No

302
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:12,329
真的不行，你还是放弃
No, Ferris, forget it I'm putting my foot down

303
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:17,405
不如我们租一辆佳得力吧 我出钱
How about we rent a nice Cadillac? My treat

304
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:24,447
我们可以租轿车 特长那种，车内有电视和酒吧
We could call a limo A stretch job with a TV and a bar

305
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:31,381
来，开心一点吧
Come on, live a little

306
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:38,255
我为你的事很难过
Let me tell you how deeply saddened I am by your loss

307
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:43,422
我亦曾有外婆…更有两个
I had a grandmother once Two, actually

308
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:52,301
生命苦短
"Man hath but a short time to live and is full of misery"

309
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:56,240
刹那光华，朝花夕拾
"He cometh up and is cut down like a flower"

310
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:59,575
如梦似烟…
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow -

311
00:28:59,717 --> 00:29:03,175
昙花一现
- and never continueth in one stay"

312
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:06,913
天呀
Oh, dear

313
00:29:10,194 --> 00:29:14,927
若要从悲伤和空虚中选择 我会选悲伤
Between grief and nothing, I'll take grief

314
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,536
好极
Great

315
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:30,979
思朗，赶快
Sloane, dear, hurry along now

316
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:36,543
是我爸，我要走了
I guess that's my dad I've got to go

317
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:44,787
罗…艾华先生
Mr Rooney Ed

318
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:48,487
- 你确是个君子 - 过奖
- You're a beautiful man - Thank you

319
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:53,760
谢谢你那么体贴和关心
I want to thank you for your warmth and compassion

320
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:03,035
垃圾
Shit!

321
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:10,685
- 不给爸爸一个吻？ - 你说笑吧
- Do you have a kiss for Daddy? - Are you kidding?

322
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:22,998
原来这是他们的家族习惯
So that's how it is in their family

323
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:32,933
- 马伦，你舒服么？ - 不舒服
- Hi, Cameron, are you comfortable? - Hi, Sloane No

324
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:41,942
- 我们打算做什么？ - 该是我们打算不做什么？
- What are we going to do? - What aren't we going to do?

325
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:45,883
别说我们打算不驾这辆车回家
Don't say we're not going to take the car home

326
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:51,550
若你可驾驶到这样的靓车 你会否立即驶它回家？
If you had access to a car like this, would you take it back right away?

327
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:54,754
我也不会
Neither would I

328
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:27,093
费利，别那么快
Ferris, don't go so fast

329
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:33,825
救救费利，谢谢你，你很慷慨
Save Ferris God bless you You're very generous

330
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:37,033
救救布费利
Save Ferris Bueller

331
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:40,203
- 救救费利？ - 什么？
- Save Ferris? - What?

332
00:32:40,437 --> 00:32:44,931
我们为布费利筹款 好让他可以换肾
We're collecting money to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney

333
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:48,111
- 往别处滚吧 - 你说什么？
- Go piss up a flagpole - I'm sorry?

334
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:51,339
- 你真可悲 - 喂
- You should be - Hey!

335
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:56,247
若你有日要布费利帮忙那怎样
What if you need a favour someday from Ferris Bueller?

336
00:32:56,453 --> 00:33:01,755
第一线接通了白先生的家 今次小心说话
Peterson home on line one Watch your mouth this time

337
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:04,759
去死吧
Go suck your hat

338
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:11,896
我们目前不能接电话 我们有家人逝世
We can't come to the phone now. We've had a death in the family.

339
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:16,801
一定是布费利弄出的好事
Ferris Bueller is behind this, there is no doubt in my mind

340
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:21,569
- 现在白思朗也同流合污 - 还有她的外婆
- Now Sloane Peterson is involved - Her grandmother, too

341
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:24,246
你这呆子
You pinhead

342
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:28,282
若想找我们，请拨以下号码
If you need to reach us, we'll be at the following number.

343
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:41,389
我能当上训导主任 自有过人之处
I did not achieve my position by having a punk leave my cheese in the wind

344
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:46,935
这是卡顿兄弟殡仪馆
You have reached the Carlton Brothers Mortuary.

345
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:51,597
请留下姓名和电话号码 我们很快会回覆你
If you leave your name and number, we'll get back to you.

346
00:33:56,113 --> 00:34:01,050
有不妥，我要找出是什么不妥
Something is going on, and I'm going to find out what it is

347
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:05,347
我要抓到这小子 毁掉他的前途
I'm going to catch this kid and put a dent in his future

348
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:10,720
15年后当他回看 自己失败一生…
15 years from now, when he looks back on the ruin his life has become, -

349
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:14,193
他会记得罗艾华
- he will remember Edward Rooney

350
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:37,979
- 不行 - 什么？
- Wrong - What?

351
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:41,954
不是这里 我们不会把车子停在这里
Not here We're not leaving the car here

352
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,095
- 为什么？ - 我要把它停在所属的地方
- Why not? - I want the car home where it belongs

353
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,822
- 走吧 - 停在车房里不会有事的
- Let's go - What can happen in a garage?

354
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:55,596
车子可能遭毁坏、被偷去 遭刮花、有黑烟
It could get wrecked, stolen, scratched, breathed on wrong

355
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:59,469
- 甚至有雀粪 - 冷静
- A pigeon could shit on it - Calm down

356
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:02,305
我会给那厮五元看管车子
I'll give the guy a fiver to watch it

357
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:05,140
什么那厮？
What guy?

358
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,757
你好吗？你会说英语吗？
Hey, how are you doing? You speak English?

359
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:20,358
你以为这是什么国家？
What country do you think this is?

360
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:25,534
好，我想你特别照顾这辆汽车
Okay, I want you to take extra special care of this vehicle

361
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:28,602
没问题，相信我
No problem Trust me

362
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:33,468
- 先生 - 来吧
- Sir - Come on

363
00:35:44,988 --> 00:35:47,786
放心
Relax

364
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:56,759
你绝对不用担心，我是专业
You have nothing to worry about I'm a professional

365
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,367
什么专业？
A professional what?

366
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,414
有钱使得鬼推磨
See what a finski can do to a guy's attitude?

367
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:17,216
Come on

368
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:18,520
来吧

369
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:35,420
希望他没事
Bless his little heart

370
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,906
九次
Nine times.

371
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:35,790
- 你认为车子有没有事？ - 当然没有
- You think the car's all right? - Sure

372
00:38:35,993 --> 00:38:40,054
- 这是全球最高的大厦 - 我觉得不大舒服
- This is the world's tallest building - I don't feel too good

373
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,231
来，像这样爬上去
Here, climb up on this

374
00:38:47,638 --> 00:38:50,937
大家都来吧，马伦
Come on, everybody Cameron

375
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:56,208
好，身子向前倾 像这样抵著玻璃窗
Okay, lean forward against the glass like this

376
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:02,543
- 天啊 - 是否很棒？
- Oh, my God! - Isn't that great?

377
00:39:02,752 --> 00:39:05,949
从这儿看，全城看似很平静
The city looks so peaceful from up here

378
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:10,490
由1353英尺高空看下去 什么也似很平静
Anything is peaceful from 1,353 feet

379
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:17,600
- 我好像看到老爸 - 我们还有很多事要做，走吧
- I think I see my dad - We've got a lot to do Let's go

380
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:23,239
这混蛋一定在某处
Shit! The son of a bitch is down there somewhere

381
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:47,823
- 你想不想结婚？ - 想
- You want to get married? - Sure

382
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:52,501
就在今天？我是认真的
Today? I'm serious

383
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:57,105
- 我不想结婚 - 为什么？
- I'm not getting married - Why not?

384
00:39:57,307 --> 00:40:02,108
- 考虑一下 - 我除了太年轻…
- Think about it - Besides being too young

385
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:04,974
又没地方住…
Having no place to live

386
00:40:05,181 --> 00:40:08,947
你亦会成为唯一有丈夫的 啦啦队队员外...
You being the only cheerleader with a husband

387
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:13,851
- 说出一个为何不好的理由 - 看我的父母便可以
- Give me one good reason why not? - Look at my mother and father

388
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:19,955
- 他们讨厌对方 - 那又怎样？
- They hate each other - So what?

389
00:40:20,196 --> 00:40:24,895
就像那辆法拉利 他爱那法拉利，却讨厌妻子
It's like that car He loves the car, he hates his wife

390
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:35,004
多谢
Thank you

391
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:54,625
可否离开这里？ 这儿令我毛骨悚然
Can we please get out of here? This place gives me the creeps

392
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:59,568
为何不早说我们要往…
Why didn't you tell me?

393
00:41:01,204 --> 00:41:04,867
- 请问有什么可以效劳？ - 有的
- Hello, may I help you? - You can sure as hell try

394
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:09,136
我是霍艾比，订了12时，三位
I'm Abe Froman, party of three for 12

395
00:41:12,816 --> 00:41:17,014
- 有问题吗？ - 你是霍艾比？
- Is there a problem? - You're Abe Froman?

396
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:24,319
- 芝加哥香肠大王？ - 本人正是
- The sausage king of Chicago? - Yeah, that's me

397
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:30,557
我很忙碌，你们返回俱乐部吧
I'm very busy Why don't you kids go back to the clubhouse?

398
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,668
你以为我并非霍艾比？
Are you suggesting I'm not who I say I am?

399
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:40,275
你们最好在我发火前离开
I'm suggesting that you leave before I have to get snooty

400
00:41:40,477 --> 00:41:44,436
- 艾比，走吧 - 我不会走的
- Okay, Abe, let's go - I'm not going anywhere

401
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:51,519
- 请带我们就座 - 我要报警了
- No, we'd like to be seated - I'm going to have to call the police

402
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:55,248
- 你要报警？ - 是的
- You're going to call the police? - Yes

403
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:59,952
- 好极，让我亲自动手 - 好的
- Fine! I'll call them myself - Yes

404
00:42:01,164 --> 00:42:04,565
报警吧，你们定会成为笑柄
Call the police This'll be a hoot

405
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:15,778
拿电话来，有来电
Give me the phone I have another call

406
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:20,348
你碰我，我就大叫 用别的电话
You touch me, I yell rat Find another phone

407
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,212
好极了
Wonderful

408
00:42:24,187 --> 00:42:27,816
我为未来悲哀
I weep for the future

409
00:42:30,093 --> 00:42:34,860
- 费利，走吧 - 你太过分了
- Ferris, let it go - Please, you've gone too far

410
00:42:35,098 --> 00:42:38,363
你会被警察抓的
You're going to get busted

411
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:44,030
首先，并没所谓过分这回事 而且我也不会被这种人抓到
You can never go too far, and I won't be busted by a guy like that

412
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,540
- 走吧，艾比 - 请霍艾比听电话
- Come on, Abe! - Ask for Abe Froman

413
00:42:48,745 --> 00:42:51,839
- 你好 - 请替我找霍艾比？
- Chez Quis? - May I speak to Abe Froman?

414
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:59,117
- 芝加哥香肠大王 - 让我找找看
- The sausage king of Chicago - Let me check the restaurant

415
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:03,259
- 可否形容一下他的外貌？ - 他穿皮夹克
- Could you describe him for me? - Leatherjacket

416
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:05,950
白色汗衫，冷背心
White T-shirt, sweater vest.

417
00:43:06,196 --> 00:43:09,393
十分之英俊
Devastatingly handsome

418
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:13,693
- 请等一下 - 劳驾
- Hold on one moment. - Thank you

419
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:28,449
霍，我是芝加哥警局的白沙展
Froman, this is Sergeant Peterson, Chicago Police.

420
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:36,158
- 谢谢你明白事理 - 别客气
- I appreciate your understanding - Don't think twice

421
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,957
明白事理令我们这种人 容忍像你这类人
Understanding allows people like us to tolerate a person like yourself

422
00:43:45,735 --> 00:43:48,670
- 谢谢 - 何足挂齿
- Thank you - Don't mention it

423
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:55,273
请慢用午餐
Enjoy your luncheon

424
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:58,572
宝贝，你真棒
Darling, you were wonderful

425
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:13,159
马伦，你不该以为 我们不会玩得开心
Cameron, you thought we wouldn't have any fun Shame on you

426
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:24,203
或许我反应过激 或许费利不是那么差劲
Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe Ferris isn't such a bad guy.

427
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:28,707
毕竟我得到车子，他只有电脑
After all, I got a car. He got a computer.

428
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:34,645
但为何他可以随心所欲？
Still, why should he get to do whatever he wants?

429
00:44:34,851 --> 00:44:38,150
为何他用一切都那么顺利？
Why should everything work out for him?

430
00:44:38,354 --> 00:44:41,585
他有啥特别？
What makes him so goddam special?

431
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,759
去死吧
Screw him

432
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:50,161
我还以为只有我家是怪家庭
I used to think that my family was the only one with weirdness in it

433
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:55,852
Then I saw Cameron's family His home life is really twisted

434
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,861
跟著我看到马伦的家 他的家庭生活实在匪夷所思

435
00:44:56,105 --> 00:44:59,939
所以他老是生病 他的家庭生活困扰著他
That's why he's sick all the time It really bothers him

436
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:03,670
他病倒反而觉得更好
He feels better when he's sick

437
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,783
若我住在他的家 我也恨不得快些病倒
If I had to live in that house, I'd pray for a disease, too

438
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:14,117
那儿就像博物馆，很美，很冷
The place is like a museum It's very beautiful and very cold

439
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:17,293
你不许碰任何东西
You're not allowed to touch anything

440
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:23,125
若你是个婴孩 住在那里会怎样呢？
Can you appreciate what it must have been like to be there as a baby?

441
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:31,240
能弄到那辆车，我自己也惊讶 我看过假装马伦驾驶它
I'm amazed that I got the car out I caught Cameron digging the ride

442
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:34,968
今次这经验有助他 应付自己的恐惧
It's good for him It teaches him to deal with his fear

443
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:40,082
还有，坦白说…
Plus, I must be honest here

444
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:43,947
我爱驾驶它，那是多么有型
I love driving it It is so choice

445
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:48,954
我强烈建议你们 也试找辆来驾驶一下
If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up

446
00:45:49,158 --> 00:45:53,060
- 劳驾 - 多谢
- Thank you - Yes, sir

447
00:46:04,407 --> 00:46:07,137
珍妮，又有谁烦著你？
Jeanie, who's bothering you now?

448
00:46:07,343 --> 00:46:10,540
- 罗先生在么？ - 不在，我可以帮忙么？
- Is Mr Rooney in? - No, can I help you?

449
00:46:10,747 --> 00:46:14,808
- 没有，他何时会回来？ - 不晓得
- I doubt it When is he back? - I don't know

450
00:46:15,017 --> 00:46:19,181
- 他因私务外出 - 什么意思？
- He's out on personal business - What's that supposed to mean?

451
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:23,655
即是说不关你的事
I suppose it means it's none of your business, young lady

452
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:27,821
Nice attitude

453
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:27,825
态度真好

454
00:46:28,064 --> 00:46:32,967
- 你不是要上夏太太的课吗？ - 也许是吧
- Is Mrs Hagel expecting you in class? - Probably

455
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:39,739
真讨厌
What an asshole

456
00:46:39,942 --> 00:46:44,777
- 增加你们的广告预算 - 我们没有钱
- Raise your advertising budget - We don't have the money

457
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:49,442
有付出才有收获，就这么简单
If you want to sell, you have to spend It's as simple as that

458
00:46:49,652 --> 00:46:54,055
这区有4000间食肆 我偏选中我爸吃午餐那一间
4,000 restaurants in the area I pick the one my father goes to

459
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:56,886
我们今次死定了
We're pinched for sure

460
00:46:57,093 --> 00:47:01,359
胆小的人才会死 勇敢的人会活下来，走吧
Only the meek get pinched The bold survive Let's go

461
00:47:01,597 --> 00:47:04,498
- 我们投降吧 - 绝对不行
- Let's surrender - Never

462
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:13,505
大卫，事情并非这样
Dave, I'm telling you that it's not the case

463
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:20,547
- 我们没有钱 - 大卫，你也知道要多少钱啊
- We don't have the money - Dave, you know what it takes

464
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,414
我们会集中在电视上宣传 亦会在电台和报刊卖广告
We're going to go heavy on TV We'll lighten up on radio and print

465
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:28,590
来我的办公室
Come on back to my office

466
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:32,591
我们知道他是有钱的 只是不肯花费
We know you've got the money We just have to spend it bonehead!

467
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:28,974
布费利

468
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:45,567
即是说你完蛋了
Lesjeux sont faits. Translation: The game is up

469
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:49,202
你屁股要开花了
Your ass is mine

470
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:19,728
跑垒者在一垒，没有人出局
Runner at first base, nobody out.

471
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:26,807
这是第五局的首个安打 亦是全场比赛的第四个安打
The first hit since the fifth inning, only the fourth hit in the game.

472
00:49:28,544 --> 00:49:33,004
没有人上垒，两人出局 要得分了，左边

473
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:36,707
出界
Twisting into foul territory.

474
00:49:38,554 --> 00:49:44,220
他们竟在那局不思进取
I'm really surprised they didn't go for it in that inning.

475
00:49:44,427 --> 00:49:47,294

- I think I broke my thumb - Hey, batter, batter Swing, batter

478
00:50:18,561 --> 00:50:22,520
救救费利

479
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:28,534
若我们循规蹈矩的话 现在应在上体育课
Do you realise that if we played by the rules, right now we'd be in gym?

480
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:39,906
Come on, boys, let's go

481
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,749
来，努力

482

我们要出人头地，努力

483

我讨厌他

是罗艾华，我想跟你谈谈
It's Ed Rooney, Ferris I'd like to have a word with you

I'm sorry, I can't come to the door right now. In my weakened condition -

509
00:58:34,232 --> 00:58:40,728
我知道你一于少理 但这可与我生死攸关
I know you don't care, but it does mean my ass

510
00:58:40,972 --> 00:58:44,032
你这样说我很伤心
That hurts, Cameron

511
00:58:45,478 --> 00:58:49,209
- 你今天看到什么？ - 没什么好的
- What have you seen today? - Nothing good

512
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:55,752
没什么？你这是什么意思？
Nothing! What do you mean, nothing good?

513
00:58:55,955 --> 00:59:00,016
我们什么好东西都见过了 我们走遍了全城
We've seen everything good, we've seen the whole city

514
00:59:00,226 --> 00:59:04,322
我们去过博物馆 看到很多无价艺术品
We went to a museum and saw priceless works of art

515
00:59:04,414 --> 00:59:10,665
What? What's wrong?

516
00:59:06,264 --> 00:59:09,927
什么事？有何不妥？

517
00:59:15,273 --> 00:59:18,265
看那边
Look over there

518
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:55,538
- 他在做什么？ - 他在弄不文手势
- What's he doing? - He's making obscene gestures

519
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,680
什么
What?

520
01:00:07,126 --> 01:00:10,926
病态年轻人在社区结集

521
01:00:34,919 --> 01:00:39,219
- 他没有离开 - 很拥挤
- He didn't leave - It really busts my hump

522
01:00:39,425 --> 01:00:44,658
- 他不会丢下我们的 - 他或许已返回学校
- He didn't ditch us - He might be back at school

523
01:00:44,864 --> 01:00:52,566
- 他不会返回学校的 - 他这样做以令我不安
- He would not go back to school - He'd do it just to make me sweat

524
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:58,108
各位，我们想为大家演奏
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to play a little tune for you.

525
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:05,579
我把这曲送给一位 以为今天不好玩的男士

526
01:01:00,029 --> 01:01:05,402
I dedicate it to a man who doesn't think he's seen anything good today.

527
01:01:05,785 --> 01:01:08,686
范马伦，这曲是送给你的
Cameron Frye, this one is for you.

528
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:18,756
- 下来吧 - 你在做什么？
- Get off the float! - What are you doing?

529
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:04,838
他做每一件事都那么顺利
As long as I've known him, everything works for him

530
01:02:05,076 --> 01:02:09,513
没什么事他处理不了 我则什么也处理不了
There's nothing he can't handle I can't handle anything

531
01:02:09,748 --> 01:02:15,209
学校、父母、未来 费利无所不能
School, parents, the future Ferris can do anything

532
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:24,161
- 我不知道自己未来该做什么 - 上大学
- I don't know what I'm going to do - College

533
01:02:24,362 --> 01:02:27,354
是的，但上大学做什么？
Yeah, but to do what?

534
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:33,264
你对什么有兴趣？
What are you interested in?

535
01:02:34,673 --> 01:02:37,801
对什么也没兴趣
Nothing

536
01:02:38,043 --> 01:02:40,841
我也是
Me neither

537
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:48,552
你疯了
You're crazy!

538
01:02:50,456 --> 01:02:54,449
你认为费利会做什么？
What do you think Ferris is going to do?

539
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:58,891
他会成为厨师
He's going to be a fry cook

540
01:05:47,866 --> 01:05:53,065
祝早日康复 英文系职员上

541
01:05:54,506 --> 01:05:56,474
老天...
Christ

542
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:08,851
看艾华叔叔有什么给你
Look what Uncle Ed has for you, you little fucker

543
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,827
天啊
Jesus!

544
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:21,863
救救费利

545
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:27,561
安睡吧
Sleep tight, pooch

546
01:06:52,197 --> 01:06:54,563
我早知道是这样
I knew it!

547
01:07:04,642 --> 01:07:08,544
她在哪儿？我是她的女儿
Well, where is she? This is her daughter

548
01:07:13,418 --> 01:07:18,014
知不知道她在哪里？何时回来
Do you know where she is? Do you know when she'll be back?

549
01:07:18,223 --> 01:07:21,420
你究竟知道什么？
Do you know anything?

550
01:08:09,407 --> 01:08:13,434
- 费利 - 布
- Ferris - Bueller

551
01:08:34,432 --> 01:08:38,129
你这疯子，你完全疯了
You're psychotic You're out of your mind

552
01:08:38,336 --> 01:08:42,932
你竟然上了巡游车队
I can't believe you went on a goddam parade float!

553
01:08:43,174 --> 01:08:45,870
慢著
Okay, wait

554
01:08:46,111 --> 01:08:51,981
这曲是我的至爱
"Yeah, this tune is one of my personal favourites"

555
01:08:52,183 --> 01:08:56,176
- 有很多人会看到你啊 - 你死定了
- A lot of people saw you - You are nailed

556
01:08:56,388 --> 01:08:59,323
有谁会相信我参加巡游？
Who'd believe I was in a parade?

557
01:08:59,524 --> 01:09:04,826
要抓我的人都不会参加巡游
Anybody who would nail me wouldn't go to a parade

558
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:08,022
很快啊
That was so quick

559
01:09:08,889 --> 01:09:16,303
- This looks okay to me, Cameron - It looks great Let's roll

560
01:09:11,403 --> 01:09:16,136
- 我觉得没有不妥 - 似乎没什么，走吧

561
01:09:16,374 --> 01:09:19,343
给你的，劳驾
Here you go Thank you

562
01:09:19,544 --> 01:09:25,141
你真慷慨，请随时回来光顾
You're a very generous individual Come back anytime

563
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:28,376
- 小心座位 - 对不起
- Watch the seat - Sorry

564
01:09:34,192 --> 01:09:37,525
再见
See you later

565
01:09:37,835 --> 01:09:43,421
We've got to do this again

566
01:09:40,765 --> 01:09:43,700
我们一定要再来一次

567
01:09:46,471 --> 01:09:50,931
我并非报假案 的确有人闯入屋
This is not a phoney call There is an intruder, -

568
01:09:51,142 --> 01:09:56,478
是白种男性 在厨房里，可能有枪
- male Caucasian, possibly armed, in my kitchen

569
01:09:56,681 --> 01:10:00,173
我姓布
My name's Bueller

570
01:10:01,286 --> 01:10:05,313
你希望我弟弟快些康复？ 我现在有危险
You hope my brother's feeling better? I'm in danger!

571
01:10:05,523 --> 01:10:12,122
我很爱惜自己身体 不想受伤或被杀
I am very protective of my body I do not want it violated or killed

572
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:14,696
我需要帮忙
I need help!

573
01:10:14,899 --> 01:10:18,892
你懂英语吗？笨蛋
Speak any English? Dickhead

574
01:10:32,017 --> 01:10:38,183
若你仍在屋子里 告诉你我已报警
Excuse me, if you're still in the house, I'vejust called the police.

575
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:43,885
若你懂得想的话，就立即离开
If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll get out real quick.

576
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:49,328
我手上还有家父的手枪 和著疹
I also have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.

577
01:10:57,542 --> 01:11:00,909
慢著，那是我的车子 别拖走它
Wait, that's my car! I'll move it

578
01:11:03,415 --> 01:11:07,010
他拿了我的车匙
He got my keys

579
01:11:07,218 --> 01:11:09,812
你这呆子
You shithead!

580
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:23,398
我觉得很好，真的
I feel pretty good I feel real good

581
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:28,436
车房里的人十分好 我之前确有点担心他们
Those guys at the garage were nice I was a little worried about them

582
01:11:28,672 --> 01:11:31,835
但结果一切都很好
It turned out good

583
01:11:36,014 --> 01:11:38,642
喂
Hey

584
01:11:41,286 --> 01:11:44,016
- 马伦 - 什么事？
- Cameron - Yeah?

585
01:11:44,222 --> 01:11:48,181
我们离开时车子走了多少里？
How many miles did you say this thing had on it when we left?

586
01:11:48,393 --> 01:11:53,194
126又3/10至4/10里左右
126 and halfway between three and four tenths

587
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:57,994
为何这样问？现在里数多少？
Why? How many miles are on it now?

588
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:04,703
马伦就在这时爆发了
Here's where Cameron goes berserk

589
01:12:24,429 --> 01:12:27,660
马伦，你没事吧？
Cameron, are you okay?

590
01:12:27,866 --> 01:12:31,302
别这样
Cut that out

591
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,329
谁呀？
Who is it?

592
01:12:35,573 --> 01:12:41,478
抱歉，我不能出来 我的情况很坏...
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door right now. In my weakened condition -

593
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,672
下楼梯时我可能会跌倒…
- I could take a spill down the stairs...

594
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:50,286
太好了，我有救了 谢天谢地
God bless the police I'm saved Thank you, God

595
01:12:51,589 --> 01:12:56,049
- 谢谢… - 听说你不舒服
- Thank... - I heard that you were feeling ill

596
01:12:56,261 --> 01:12:59,492
头痛、发烧又发冷
headache, fever and a chill

597
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:02,758
我是来令你回复健康的
I came to help restore your pluck

598
01:13:02,967 --> 01:13:05,765
因为我是护士…
'cause I'm the nurse who likes to...

599
01:13:12,711 --> 01:13:16,306
似乎是真的
This may very well be for real

600
01:13:16,514 --> 01:13:19,608
他可能真的傻了
He might have blown a microchip or two

601
01:13:19,818 --> 01:13:25,313
他一向紧张兮兮 我只想令他放松一天
He's always been a little keyed up I just wanted to give him a good day

602
01:13:25,523 --> 01:13:28,924
我们快毕业了
We're going to graduate soon

603
01:13:29,127 --> 01:13:34,326
到暑假时，他和我都会工作
We'll have the summer He'll work and I'll work

604
01:13:34,532 --> 01:13:38,059
我们会在晚上和周末见面
We'll see each other at night and on the weekends

605
01:13:38,269 --> 01:13:42,000
跟著我们会分别到 不同学校升学
Then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another

606
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,403
基本上是这样
Basically that will be it

607
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:50,405
思朗则是一个大问题
Sloane's as big a problem

608
01:13:50,648 --> 01:13:55,312
她尚有一年才高中毕业 我该怎处理呢？
She has another year of high school How do I deal with that?

609
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,889
我跟她求婚时是认真的
I was serious when I said I'd marry her I would

610
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:02,581
马伦？
Cameron?

611
01:14:02,794 --> 01:14:07,060
你听不听到？
Can you hear me?

612
01:14:07,265 --> 01:14:11,998
若明白的话就眨眼
Cameron, blink if you understand me

613
01:14:12,203 --> 01:14:17,470
马伦从没谈过恋爱 从没有人爱上他
Cameron has never been in love Well, nobody has been in love with him

614
01:14:17,709 --> 01:14:23,841
若情况没改善 他将与首个上床的女孩结婚
If things don't change for him, he's going to marry the first girl he lays

615
01:14:24,049 --> 01:14:28,577
她会视他如粪土，更会令他…
And she's going to treat him like shit, because she will have given him -

616
01:14:28,787 --> 01:14:34,248
噩梦成真，即是世界末日
- what he has built up in his mind as the end all, be all of our existence

617
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:36,893
她不会尊重他
She won't respect him

618
01:14:37,095 --> 01:14:42,226
因为你不会尊重奉承你的人
You can't respect somebody who kisses your ass It just doesn't work

619
01:14:42,434 --> 01:14:46,894
试别的方法吧，这样没效
Ferris, we'd better try something else This isn't working

620
01:14:52,544 --> 01:14:55,377
马伦，你好了点没有？
Are you feeling better, Cameron?

621
01:14:57,482 --> 01:15:02,044
进来，很舒服啊
Why don't you come in here? It's really nice

622
01:15:04,856 --> 01:15:10,453
不要紧，我也很容易发疯
Cameron, I can flip out real easy, too It's okay

623
01:15:11,763 --> 01:15:16,359
迟早所有人都会发疯
Sooner or later, everybody goes to the zoo

624
01:15:20,372 --> 01:15:25,901
或许他真的有病 他并非在折磨自己
Maybe he's really sick Maybe he isn't just torturing himself

625
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:13,767
Hey! Hey, Cameron!

626
01:16:10,555 --> 01:16:14,013
马伦

627
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:19,127
马伦，醒来
Cameron, wake up

628
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:24,291
来，马伦，快醒吧
Come on, Cameron Wake up!

629
01:16:28,106 --> 01:16:33,567
- 怎么了？ - 布费利，你实在是我的英雄
- What is that? - Ferris Bueller, you're my hero

630
01:16:33,812 --> 01:16:37,908
- 你确很重视我啊 - 你这畜牲
- That was pretty impressive, man - You son of a bitch

631
01:16:45,857 --> 01:16:48,519
一点也不好笑
It's not funny

632
01:17:14,351 --> 01:17:18,185
毒品？
Drugs?

633
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,154
谢谢，但我不吸毒的
Thank you, no I'm straight

634
01:17:21,358 --> 01:17:24,555
我是问你是否因毒品被抓？
I meant, are you in here for drugs?

635
01:17:26,264 --> 01:17:28,926
- 你为何在这里？ - 因为毒品
- Why are you here? - Drugs

636
01:17:29,134 --> 01:17:33,070
- 我不知道自己为何在这里 - 你为何不回家？
- I don't know why I'm here - Why don't you go home?

637
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:37,832
你为何要多管闲事？
Why don't you put your thumb up your butt?

638
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:45,810
你的眼部化妆太浓
You wear too much eye make-up

639
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:53,555
我姐姐化妆太浓 人们以为她是妓女
My sister wears too much People think she's a whore

640
01:17:58,897 --> 01:18:03,095
- 你不想跟我谈谈你的问题吗？ - 跟你谈？你说真的？
- You don't want to talk about it? - With you? Are you serious?

641
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,792
- 当然 - 你去死吧
- I'm serious - Blow yourself

642
01:18:11,276 --> 01:18:15,975
好，你想知道问题出于哪里？
All right, you want to know what's wrong?

643
01:18:16,181 --> 01:18:19,912
我知道问题出于那里 但我想听你说出来
I know what's wrong I just want to hear you say it

644
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:23,986
总言之，我讨厌我的弟弟
In a nutshell, I hate my brother How's that?

645
01:18:24,189 --> 01:18:28,683
你炸死了他？
That's cool Did you blow him away or something?

646
01:18:28,892 --> 01:18:32,293
不，还未
No, not yet

647
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:38,993
他逃学，当我回家查看时 有人在屋里
He was ditching school When I went home to check, some guy was there

648
01:18:39,204 --> 01:18:42,469
警察以为我报假案所以抓我
The cops picked me up for making a phoney call

649
01:18:42,706 --> 01:18:47,143
你的弟弟逃学又与你何干？
What do you care if your brother ditches school?

650
01:18:47,344 --> 01:18:51,337
- 人人都上学 - 你自己也可以逃学
- Everybody else has to go - You could ditch

651
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:56,953
- 我会被发现的 - 说得对
- I'd get caught - Yes

652
01:18:57,155 --> 01:19:02,320
你愤怒的原因是 他逃学又没被发现？
You're pissed off because he ditches and doesn't get caught, is that it?

653
01:19:03,862 --> 01:19:06,524
- 基本上是的 - 基本上是的
- Basically - Basically

654
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:11,793
- 那问题出于你自己身上 - 什么？
- Your problem is you - Excuse me?

655
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:17,440
你该担心自己 而非担心你弟弟做什么
Worry about yourself, not about what your brother does

656
01:19:18,877 --> 01:19:23,473
- 那不过是我个人见解 - 你是何许人？心理学家吗？
- That's just an opinion - What are you, a psychiatrist?

657
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:27,275
请别意见多多
Keep your opinions to yourself

658
01:19:30,255 --> 01:19:33,747
你该跟某人好好谈谈
There's somebody you should talk to

659
01:19:36,895 --> 01:19:40,353
若你是指费利，省一口气吧
If you say Ferris Bueller, you lose a testicle

660
01:19:40,565 --> 01:19:42,999
原来你认识他
Oh, you know him

661
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:54,975
那时候我不断想 希望一切都结束
That whole time I was just thinking things over

662
01:19:57,015 --> 01:20:00,678
我就像…在冥想
I was like meditating

663
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:06,851
我好像看到自己的内心
Then I sort of watched myself from inside

664
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:13,829
我发现害怕实在…太荒谬了
I realised it was ridiculous being afraid

665
01:20:14,032 --> 01:20:18,059
杞人忧天，希望自己死了等等
Worrying about everything Wishing I was dead

666
01:20:18,268 --> 01:20:21,533
我已厌倦了这样子
All that shit I'm tired of it

667
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:27,811
今天是我一生最精采一天
It was the best day of my life

668
01:20:30,814 --> 01:20:34,511
明年我将会怀念你们
I'm going to miss you guys next year

669
01:20:42,459 --> 01:20:47,590
马伦，可否问你一条问题？
Cameron, can I ask you a question?

670
01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:50,768
问吧
Yeah

671
01:20:50,969 --> 01:20:55,872
你有没有偷看我更衣？
Did you see me change out of my clothes by the jacuzzi?

672
01:20:57,374 --> 01:21:00,241
有没有？
Did you?

673
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:04,480
你偷看我？ 我还以为你患上紧张症
You saw me? I thought you were catatonic

674
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:14,019
不要紧，我并不尴尬
That's okay I'm not embarrassed

675
01:21:14,027 --> 01:21:18,569
I better check on the car

676
01:21:16,561 --> 01:21:20,088
我还是去看看那辆法拉利

677
01:21:32,543 --> 01:21:35,307
费利
Hey, Ferris!

678
01:21:35,512 --> 01:21:38,242
什么事？
Yeah?

679
01:21:39,283 --> 01:21:45,381
我们倒行，但里数并没倒退
The miles aren't coming off going in reverse

680
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:54,395
真的？那么有麻烦了
No I thought that might be a problem

681
01:21:54,598 --> 01:21:58,534
我们得弄开里程计 以人手把里数倒退
We have to open the odometer, roll it back by hand

682
01:21:59,803 --> 01:22:02,670
不，不用了
No, forget it

683
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:06,810
不用了
Forget it

684
01:22:10,748 --> 01:22:13,376
我要勇敢站起来
I've got to take a stand

685
01:22:17,488 --> 01:22:20,457
我是窝囊废
I'm bullshit

686
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,487
我什么也哑忍
I put up with everything

687
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:32,325
被老父操纵
My old man pushes me around

688
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:38,304
我从没话事权
I never say anything

689
01:22:42,112 --> 01:22:46,276
有问题的不是他，是我
He's not the problem I'm the problem

690
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:54,651
我得有立场
I've got to take a stand

691
01:22:56,593 --> 01:22:59,289
我得站起来对抗他
I've got to take a stand against him

692
01:23:01,733 --> 01:23:04,827
我不会坐以待毙…
I am not going to sit on my ass -

693
01:23:05,035 --> 01:23:10,268
不会任由宰割
- as the events that affect me unfold to determine the course of my life

694
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:13,807
I'm going to take a stand and defend it

695
01:23:11,975 --> 01:23:15,172
我要站起来保护自己

696
01:23:15,379 --> 01:23:19,782
无论对与错 我也要保护自己的原则
Right or wrong, I'm going to defend it

697
01:23:29,494 --> 01:23:32,463
我已厌了这废铁
I'm so sick of this shit

698
01:23:32,663 --> 01:23:35,928
我再不能忍受他 我讨厌他的车子
I can't stand him and I hate this goddam car

699
01:23:36,134 --> 01:23:39,865
你爱谁？你爱上一辆车
Who do you love? You love a car

700
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:43,164
你这畜牲
You son of a bitch

701
01:24:04,928 --> 01:24:07,055
糟了
Shit

702
01:24:08,766 --> 01:24:12,395
我把他的爱车弄成这样子
I dented the shit out of it

703
01:24:15,606 --> 01:24:18,006
好极
Good

704
01:24:20,778 --> 01:24:24,874
我爸会看到我做过什么
My father will see what I did I can't hide this

705
01:24:27,418 --> 01:24:32,014
他回家之后就要会整治我
He'll come home and he'll have to deal with me

706
01:24:32,222 --> 01:24:35,521
我不管，我真的不管
I don't care I really don't

707
01:24:35,726 --> 01:24:39,662
我已厌了担惊受怕
I'm just tired of being afraid

708
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:48,429
管他的
The hell with him

709
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:53,529
I can't wait to see the look on his face

710
01:24:50,474 --> 01:24:53,910
我恨不得快些看到他样子

711
01:25:23,307 --> 01:25:26,242
我做了什么？
What did I do?

712
01:25:34,985 --> 01:25:40,514
- 我做了什么？ - 你把车子变成废铁
- What did I do? - You killed the car

713
01:26:17,895 --> 01:26:20,659
哗
Whoa!

714
01:26:21,899 --> 01:26:24,697
老天
Holy shit!

715
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:42,007
这是我的错，我会承担责任
It's my fault I'll take the heat for it

716
01:26:42,219 --> 01:26:48,283
他回家后，对他说是我做的 反正他一直讨厌我
When he comes home, we'll tell him that I did it He hates me anyway

717
01:26:52,429 --> 01:26:55,330
不，让我负责任
No, I'll take it

718
01:26:55,532 --> 01:27:00,060
- 让我来吧 - 但今次非同小可
- I'll take it - No, you don't want this much heat

719
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:03,671
若我怕负责 就不会让你驶走那辆车
If I didn't want it, I wouldn't have let you take the car

720
01:27:03,907 --> 01:27:10,870
- 是我令你驶走那辆车的 - 我大可以阻止你
- I made you take that car - I could have stopped you

721
01:27:11,115 --> 01:27:14,414
就让我承担责任吧
I want it I'm going to take it, that's it

722
01:27:15,586 --> 01:27:20,785
摩利回家后，我们会好好谈谈
When Morris comes home, he and I will just have a little chat

723
01:27:22,926 --> 01:27:26,794
妙极，不，真的棒极
It's cool No, it's going to be good

724
01:27:28,532 --> 01:27:31,023
谢谢你
Thanks anyway

725
01:27:38,641 --> 01:27:43,078
我很震惊 首先，我不知为何她不在学校
This is a shock to me I don't know why she left school

726
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:47,808
亦不知为何她会编出 有人闯入的故事
And why would she come up with a story about an intruder?

727
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:51,954
无论为什么，她确受了惊
For whatever reason she did it, she's had a scare

728
01:27:52,156 --> 01:27:59,392
谢谢你来电 我们会好好跟她谈谈
I appreciate you calling We'll have a long talk with her at home

729
01:27:59,596 --> 01:28:01,860
谢谢
Thank you

730
01:28:01,999 --> 01:28:05,662
- 希望令O快些康复 - 什么？
- I hope your son is feeling better - Pardon?

731
01:28:05,869 --> 01:28:10,101
转告他警局内的人都为他打气
Tell him all the guys at the station are pulling for him

732
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,207
好的
Right

733
01:28:20,683 --> 01:28:23,675
- 嗨 - 别“嗨”我
- Hi - Don't "hi" me, young lady

734
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:27,186
我想立即离开这里
I want to get out of here now Now

735
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:30,622
好的…
Okay Fine!

736
01:28:37,368 --> 01:28:41,634
- 她有点神经过敏 - 是的
- She's a little hyper - Yeah

737
01:28:44,441 --> 01:28:48,878
我们还是不要滔滔不绝说下去
Let's not ruin this with a lot of talk, okay?

738
01:28:49,113 --> 01:28:54,176
- 你还没告诉我你名字 - 我叫珍妮
- You didn't tell me your name - It's Jean

739
01:28:54,385 --> 01:28:58,446
但男孩大多叫我做桑娜
But a lot of guys call me Shauna

740
01:28:58,655 --> 01:29:02,557
- 好的，珍妮 - 好极
- Okay, Jean - Cool

741
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,456
好
That's great

742
01:29:05,662 --> 01:29:09,154
迟些见
I'll see you, okay?

743
01:29:12,436 --> 01:29:15,064
珍妮，走吧
Jeanie, now!

744
01:29:15,272 --> 01:29:18,298
- 立即 - 好的
- Now! - Okay

745
01:29:26,749 --> 01:29:31,311
- 我今天玩得很开心 - 的确不错
- I had a great time today - Yeah, it was pretty cool

746
01:29:33,756 --> 01:29:36,623
马伦不会有事吧？
Will Cameron be okay?

747
01:29:36,827 --> 01:29:41,093
一生以来第一次没有事
Yeah, sure, for the first time in his life

748
01:29:41,298 --> 01:29:43,960
他不会有事的
He's going to be just fine

749
01:29:50,673 --> 01:29:55,042
你今早醒来时 知否自己会做什么？
You knew what you were doing when you woke up this morning

750
01:29:55,245 --> 01:29:58,078
我？不知道
Me? No

751
01:30:17,034 --> 01:30:19,002
糟了
Oh, shit!

752
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:22,036
我要走了
I have to go

753
01:30:22,972 --> 01:30:26,339
- 我今晚致电你 - 好的
- I'll call you tonight - Okay

754
01:30:29,012 --> 01:30:33,039
- 我爱你 - 我也爱你
- I love you - I love you, too

755
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:35,684
他会跟我结婚
He's going to marry me

756
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:45,189
你知否往警局接女儿的滋味？
Do you know what it's like to pick up your daughter at the police station?

757
01:30:45,396 --> 01:30:51,596
我本来快要跟 佛蒙特的人达成协议
I was about to close the deal with the Vermont people

758
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:58,704
我本来快要收到佣金 给你小弟买辆车
I was going to take my commission and buy Ferris a car

759
01:30:58,942 --> 01:31:03,538
你究竟在搞什么？想拖垮全家
What the hell are you doing? Are you trying to kill us?

760
01:31:03,746 --> 01:31:07,978
看这儿一团糟 我怎也不能再整理好这些
Look at this mess I'll never get these papers back in order

761
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:31,000
- 慢些 - 你不断骂我，我驾不了车
- Slow down - I can't drive with you yelling at me!

762
01:32:00,803 --> 01:32:03,636
你们好，我叫布费利
Hi, I'm Ferris Bueller

763
01:33:31,962 --> 01:33:36,092
别起来，很香
No, don't get up That smells delicious

764
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,667
- 晚餐准备好了 - 什么？那是谁？
- Dinner's ready - What? Who was that?

765
01:34:12,236 --> 01:34:14,727
有什么不妥？
What's wrong?

766
01:34:14,937 --> 01:34:19,772
一切也不妥 我刚往警局接珍妮回来
Everything I just picked up Jeanie at the police station

767
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:26,444
她接获超速告票 我则因她失去了佛蒙特那交易
She got a speeding ticket and I lost the Vermont deal because of her

768
01:34:33,856 --> 01:34:36,916
是否在找这个？
Looking for this?

769
01:34:47,171 --> 01:34:49,731
我抓到你了，费利
I got you, Ferris

770
01:34:49,972 --> 01:34:54,033
费利怎样？我们去看看他吧
How's Ferris? Let's go in and check on him

771
01:34:54,278 --> 01:35:01,411
我一直梦想有这么一天 而今次…
I have dreamed about this And this time

772
01:35:01,617 --> 01:35:06,384
你这小鬼就被我人脏俱获
you little bastard, I've got you right where I want you

773
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:09,582
费利，我们回家了
Ferris, we're home

774
01:35:10,626 --> 01:35:17,964
留级一年，我亲自监督你
How would you feel about another year at high school?

775
01:35:18,167 --> 01:35:22,900
你觉得怎样？
Under my close, personal supervision?

快
Scoot!

781
01:35:57,708 --> 01:36:03,112
他病得那么重 竟还想由医院步行回家
Can you imagine someone that sick trying to walk home from hospital?

782
01:36:03,347 --> 01:36:05,747
小孩子真是的
Kids!

783
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:12,019
说开又说，你把钱包遗在厨房
By the way, you left your wallet on the kitchen floor

784

我得在6月毕业，而且…
I have to graduate in June, and I

789
01:37:40,576 --> 01:37:45,536
费利，你有病，别勉强 否则弄坏身体
Ferris, you're sick Don't push it and make yourself worse

790
01:37:45,782 --> 01:37:49,843

I've said it before and I'll say it again: Life moves pretty fast

796
01:38:45,409 --> 01:38:50,642
若你不偶尔停下来周围看看 你会错过很多事
If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it

797
01:39:00,723 --> 01:39:03,988
四年来我一直盯紧这小子
Four years I've been chasing this kid

要不要我载你一程？

806
01:42:02,905 --> 01:42:04,896
