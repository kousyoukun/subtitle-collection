-请进。——谢谢。
- Do come in. - Thank you.

15
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,309
这是一种地狱般的驱力?
Was it a hellish drive?

16
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,712
-不不不不客气。-哦,好的。
- No, no, no. Not at all. - Oh, good.

17
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,714
M4可以是野兽。
The M4 can be beastly.

18
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:09,016
“M4,可怕的苦差事。”
"M4, dreadful chore."

19
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,752
这是我们过去常说的。
That's what we used to say.

20
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:14,321
嗯，这是一栋漂亮的房子。
Well, it's a beautiful house.

21
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,390
有的地方已经有近500年的历史了。嗯?
Yes, nearly 500 years old in parts. Hmm?

22
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,594
多好的想法啊，嗯?
What a thought, eh?

23
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,362
莎士比亚。
Shakespeare.

24
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,832
或之前。
Or pre.

25
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,902
听着，你一定有包。
Uh, look, you must have bags.

26
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,470
抱歉?
Sorry?

27
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,507
哦，你一定有包。后备箱?
Oh, you must have bags. Boot of the car?

28
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,580
为什么我不把它们带进来呢?
Why don't I bring them in?

29
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:34,575
我能帮你。

30
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,878
哦，不，不，不。不，不，绝对不行。不。
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, absolutely not. No.

31
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,679
你，别客气。
You, uh, make yourself comfortable.

32
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,448
水壶煮。厨房就在那边。
The kettle's boiled. Kitchen just through there.

33
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,350
茶在橱柜里，牛奶在冰箱里。
Uh, tea in the cupboard, milk in the fridge.

34
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,986
就在你能找到他们的地方。
Just where you'd expect to find them.

35
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,721
太好了。
Great.

36
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:47,755
一会儿就好。
Won't be a jiffy.

37
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:37,470
大便。
Shit.

38
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,372
我能帮忙吗?
Can I help?

39
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,109
嗯,不,不。不,不。没有问题。
Erm, no, no. No, no. No problem.

40
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:55,923
天哪，出了一身汗。
Gosh, broken a sweat.

41
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:58,593
开始希望我能让你帮忙。
Started to wish I'd let you help.

42
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,903
不过，我想你还是需要这些。
Still, I expect you need it all.

43
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,404
你还有两个星期才拿到这个地方，是吗?
It's two weeks you've got the place, isn't it?

44
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,462
是的。没错,是的。
Yeah. That's right, yeah.

45
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,898
你找到茶了。太好了。
Oh, you found the tea. Jolly good.

46
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,068
花园里的苹果?
Apple from the garden?

47
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,503
是的，很好吃。
Yeah, it was delicious.

48
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,906
偷窃,是吗?不，不，不。
Scrumping, eh? No, no, no, no.

49
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,742
不能这样做。禁果。
Mustn't do that. Forbidden fruit.

50
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:19,814
哦。嗯…上帝,对不起,我……我…我在开玩笑。
Oh. Uh... God, sorry, I... I... I'm joking.

51
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:20,982
哦。
Oh.

52
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:24,151
你爱吃多少就吃多少。做酸辣酱。
Have as many as you like. Make chutney.

53
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,887
它们只会掉在地上毁坏。
They only fall to the ground and spoil.

54
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,855
接下来你就会发现，这地方到处都是黄蜂。
Next thing you know, the place is full of wasps.

55
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,424
我带你四处看看好吗?-是的。
- Shall I show you round? - Yeah.

56
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:36,130
我们从一楼开始吧。
Uh, and let's start with the ground floor.

57
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,433
客厅里。
Drawing room.

58
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,971
现在，电视信号不是很好。
Oh, now, not the best reception on the telly.

59
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,607
下雨的时候会有点不协调。
Little bit patchy when it's raining.

60
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:48,109
不知道为什么。
Don't know why.

61
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,177
壁炉准备好了。
Fireplace is good to go.

62
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,980
如果木头用完了，棚里还有一堆呢。
Oh, and if you run out of wood, there's stacks more in the shed.

63
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,951
搬到钢琴室去。
Moving in to the piano room.

64
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:01,122
你会弹钢琴吗?
Do you play the piano?

65
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:03,490
哦,不。
Uh, no.

66
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,660
哦。我也不。
Oh. Me neither.

67
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:10,131
现在我带你去看看餐厅。
Now let me show you the dining room.

68
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,733
很适合周日的高档烤肉。
Good for a slap-up Sunday roast.

69
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:17,939
呃，在衣帽间。外套，雨伞，长筒雨靴，等等。
Uh, the cloak room. Coats, brollies, wellies, blah, blah, blah.

70
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:20,675
但是，很明显，不要在房子里走泥巴。
But, obviously, try not to walk mud through the house.

71
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,110
楼上。
Upstairs.

72
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:25,513
沿着摇摆不定的方向往上走。
Up the wibbly-wobbly way.

73
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,648
有点不平，但别紧张。
Little uneven but hold your nerve.

74
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:34,088
干净的毛巾，大量的肥皂。
Clean towels, plenty of soap.

75
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:38,559
还有一个大浴盆，走了很久以后可以泡澡。
And, uh, good big tub for soaking after a long walk.

76
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,928
啊,唯一……抱歉，不得不说。
Ah, only thing... Sorry, have to say it.

77
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:43,030
女士们，请注意冲水的东西。
Uh, ladies, do watch what you flush.

78
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:45,933
正确的。是的。
Right. Yeah.

79
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,002
化粪池，你看。不能应付。
Septic tank, you see. Can't cope.

80
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,074
好了，我们就不多说了。
Well, let's say no more.

81
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:59,013
最后,哈哈。主卧室。
Finally, ta-da. The master bedroom.

82
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,715
哇。
Wow.

83
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,550
是啊，景色很美，不是吗?
Yeah, wonderful view, isn't it?

84
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:07,088
看到树顶上的教堂尖顶了吗?
See the church spire over the trees?

85
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:10,691
这是村庄。一箭之遥。
That's the village. A stone's throw.

86
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:12,860
如果你感兴趣的话，这是个非常不错的酒吧。
Jolly nice pub if you're interested.

87
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,796
10分钟走过去，30分钟走回来。
10-minute walk there, 30-minute walk back.

88
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,235
干净的床单等等。
Clean sheets and so forth.

89
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:25,840
呃，只有你留下还是…是啊，就是我。
And, uh, will it just be you staying or... Yeah, it's just me.

90
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,275
老公在哪里?
Where's hubby?

91
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,612
原谅我吗?
Excuse me?

92
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,747
“马洛太太”,不是吗?
"Mrs. Marlowe," no?

93
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:36,717
是的,哦,不。
Yeah, uh, no.

94
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:39,787
不,它不是。我还没改呢，"太太"
No, it isn't. I haven't changed it yet, the "Mrs."

95
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,622
或者是姓。
Or the surname.

96
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,092
哦。哦。
Oh. Oh.

97
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,698
干得好,杰弗里。
Well done, Geoffrey.

98
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,933
哦,不。请,这很好。
Oh, no. Please, it's fine.

99
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:58,639
Wi-Fi密码，所有那些乱七八糟的东西都在钢琴上的欢迎包里。
Wi-Fi password, and all that mumbo jumbo is in the welcome pack on the piano.

100
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,875
现在,关键。城堡的钥匙。
Now, key. Key to the castle.

101
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,943
只是一个。
Just the one.

102
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,989
如果你弄丢了也不用担心。说实话，在这里你没必要锁门。
Don't worry if you lose it. To be honest, you don't need to lock your doors 'round here.

103
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,681
好吧,再次感谢。
Well, thanks again.

104
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,817
…这地方真漂亮。
The... The place is lovely.

105
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,994
这正是我所希望的。
It's exactly what I hoped for.

106
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,653
啊。好吧，我不打扰你了。
Ah. Well, I'll leave you to it.

107
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,359
如果你需要我，你有我的电话号码。
Oh, if you need me, you've got my number.

108
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,628
我就住在这条巷子里。
And I live just down the lane.

109
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,164
小屋上有“小心狗”的标志。
The cottage with a "beware of the dog" sign.

110
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:27,768
尽管这老女孩已经死了五年了，她从来没对鹅说过什么。
And even though the old girl's been dead these past five years, and never said boo to a goose.

111
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:29,203
好吧,再次感谢。
Well, thanks again.

112
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,274
——再见!——再见。
- Bye-bye! - Bye.

113
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:44,919
我想我可能有点太挥霍了。
I think I might have splashed out just a little bit too much.

114
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,787
不,它很漂亮。
No, it's gorgeous.

115
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:51,358
是的,是的,是的。它是。这是梦想中的乡村别墅。
Yes, yes, yes. It is. It is the dream country house.

116
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:54,061
你能带我参观一下吗?我想看全部。
Can you give me the tour? I want to see all of it.

117
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,930
是啊，我能晚点再做吗?
Uh, yeah, can I do it later?

118
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,933
我刚和老板杰弗里参观完。
I just finished the tour with the owner, Geoffrey.

119
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,968
他很有个性。
He was quite a character.

120
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,169
继续。
Go on.

121
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:05,239
他是一个非常非常特别的类型。
He was a very, very, specific type.

122
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,176
非常非常的国家。
Very, very country.

123
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,146
你明天会和他一起去猎松鸡吗?
And will you be joining him grouse shooting tomorrow?

124
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,247
这是完美的。
That's perfect.

125
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,152
事实上，他问起了詹姆斯。
He asked about James, actually.

126
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,921
你说他问起詹姆斯是什么意思?如何?
What do you mean, he asked about James? How?

127
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:24,125
我以马洛太太的名义订的。
I booked it under Mrs. Marlowe.

128
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:27,128
只是…我那样做真奇怪。
Just... strange that I did that.

129
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,395
自动的,我猜。
Automatic, I guess.

130
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,397
你跟他说了什么?
So, what did you tell him?

131
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:31,899
我什么都没告诉他。
I didn't tell him anything.

132
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,970
我暗示我离婚了。
I implied I was divorced.

133
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,172
是的。
Yeah.

134
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,243
-哈珀…-别说了，我知道你要说什么
- Harper... - Stop, I know what you're gonna say.

135
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:50,151
我是说，我不知道，但是…听着，这种事会一次又一次地发生。
I mean, I don't know, but... Look, this kind of thing is gonna happen again and again.

136
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:55,334
在某种程度上，这将会发生在我的一生中，所以，我只需要习惯它。
In one way, it's gonna happen my whole life, so, I'm just gonna have to get used to it.

137
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,224
好吧。
Okay.

138
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,427
但你不知道我要说什么。
But you didn't know what I was gonna say.

139
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:05,733
我想说，你知道大象是唯一不会跳的动物吗?
I was gonna say, did you know that elephants are the only animal that can't jump?

140
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:10,871
我想告诉你一个有趣的事实。
Just an interesting fact that I need to share with you.

141
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:12,473
这很有趣。
That is very interesting.

142
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:14,441
是的,这是……
Yeah, and it's...

143
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:22,116
大象盛装舞步从未真正流行起来。
elephant dressage events never really took off.

144
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,820
对不起。站不住脚的。
Sorry. Lame.

145
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,757
不,不。不。不，抱歉，只是信号断了。
No, no. No. No, no, sorry, just the signal cut out.

146
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,159
该死的典型。我是在搞笑。
Fucking typical. I was being hilarious.

147
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:37,307
——嗯…-所以，是的，我会…-待会儿见。-是的,是的。你的赌注。
- Um... - So, yeah, I'll... - I'll see you later. - Yeah, yeah. You bet.

148
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,842
——好的。爱你。再见，爱你。
- All right. Love you. - Bye, love you.

149
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,034
——再见。——再见。
- Bye. - Bye.

150
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,296
你不能和我离婚。
You're not divorcing me.

151
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,836
你离婚…我是如何……过去的一年。
You're divorcing how... how I've been for... for the past year.

152
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,839
我明白，但是有一次…一旦我……詹姆斯。
I get that, but once... once I've... James.

153
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,047
我们……我们承诺过的，哈珀。
We... We made promises, Harper.

154
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,382
在一个教堂。
In a church.

155
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,085
我们做了什么承诺?
What promises did we make?

156
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:34,822
如果我能知道你为什么嫁给我，那我就能减去我现在不一样的地方。
If I can know why you married me, then I can subtract what's different about me now.

157
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,056
- - - - - -詹姆斯。——是吗?
- James. - Yes?

158
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,124
请。
Please.

159
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,998
我要杀了我自己。
I'll kill myself.

160
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:52,339
不,你不能……你不能这么说。
No, you can't... You can't say something like that.

161
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,544
-你不能这么对我说!-我说了。
- You can't say that to me! - I'm saying it.

162
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,181
我之所以这么说，是因为你将不得不接受它。
I say it because you will have to live with it.

163
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,384
你的良心。
On your conscience.

164
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:05,754
不。
No.

165
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:12,893
不,詹姆斯!只是,请…别说“请”了，哈珀!
No, James! Just, please... Stop saying please, Harper!

166
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,129
停止请求!我恳求!
Stop pleading! I am pleading!

167
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,865
我是!
I am!

168
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:24,104
我很抱歉我的死会让你良心不安，但这是事实。
Now, I am sorry you will have to live with my death on your conscience, but it's the truth.

169
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,974
你不能把这个给我。
You can't give this to me.

170
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,084
就像你亲手杀了我一样。
It'll be as if you'd killed me yourself.

171
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,144
你不能这么说。你不能这么做。不,詹姆斯。
You can't say this. You can't do that. No, James.

172
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:34,315
不，那就像你自杀了一样，让人难以忍受。
No, it'll be as if you killed yourself, and would be fucking unbearable.

173
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,188
那是我最不想要的。
That is the last thing I would ever, ever want.

174
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,351
这不是……它不是。
This isn't... It's not.

175
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,554
这不是最后一件事，因为你想和我离婚。
It's not the last thing because you wanna divorce me.

176
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:44,502
这是所以…-太他妈疯狂了!-比起让我活下去，你更想和我离婚!
That's so... - That's so fucking crazy! - You wanna divorce me more than you wanna keep me alive!

177
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:45,993
你没听见你在说什么吗?
Can't you hear what you're saying?

178
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,337
我的命对你来说怎么这么没价值?
How is my life worth so little to you?

179
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:49,463
因为我也有自己的生活!
Because I have a life, too!

180
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,498
我他妈的有自己的生活!
I have a fucking life!

181
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:53,635
你在威胁我。
You are threatening me.

182
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:56,146
-我没有威胁你-你是…这不是威胁。这是一个警告。
- I'm not threatening you. - You are... It's not a threat. It's a warning.

183
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,281
你他妈在威胁我-这太可怕了。-这是事实。
You're fucking threatening me, - and it's fucking horrible. - It's a fact.

184
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,240
它把我撕裂了!
It tears me apart!

185
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:05,412
但当你威胁我不和你离婚时，我们就得离婚了。
But when you threaten me into not divorcing you, that is exactly why we have to get divorced.

186
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:09,450
我要和你离婚，好吗?我是。我是。
And I am going to divorce you, okay? I am. I am.

187
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:14,121
因为我不能活得像…我活不下去……
Because I can't live like... I can't live...

188
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:55,670
啊!
Ahh!

189
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:17,224

是的,很好。
Yeah, good.

199
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:30,924
我正在看你刚送来的数据。
Um, I'm just going through the figures you just sent over.

200
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:32,727
修正,是的。
The revisions, yeah.

201
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:34,681
我只是想再确认几件事。
I just wanted to double-check a couple of things.

202
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:45,640
是的，但是，很抱歉，如果数字正确的话，我们不能给他们这个交易。我们的利润消失。
Yeah, uh, but, sorry, we can't offer them that deal if the figures are correct. Our margins disappear.

203
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:49,476
利润率。
Margins.

204
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:52,112
是的。啊哈。
Yeah. Uh-huh.

205
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,630
好吧。打电话给供应商并核对。

206

再见。

现在?

210
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:30,518
是啊，时机正好。
Yeah, it's perfect timing.

211
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:32,986
——谁?-加油，哈珀!

你住的地方有辆车。你很快就会收到。

270
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:19,781
你跟那个贱人说了什么，莱丽?
What've you said to that bitch, Riley?

271
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:20,848
什么都没有。
Nothing.

272
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:22,984
——解开它。——没有。
- Unlock it. - No.

273
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:24,351
——解开它。——没有。
- Unlock it. - No.

274
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,920
你想瞒我什么?
What are you trying to hide from me?

275
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:30,323
这是我的电话。
It's my phone.

276
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,443
好了，把他抬起来。
Okay, let's get him up.

277
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:51,879
来吧，我的朋友。
Come on then, my friend.

278
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,016
所以你不知道他是谁?
So you don't know who he is?

279
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:58,786
他没带任何证件，这是肯定的。
Well, he wasn't carrying any ID, that's for sure.

280
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,621
看起来他一直露宿街头。
Looks like he's been sleeping rough.

281
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,624
我昨天看见他了。
I saw him yesterday.

282
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,631
嗯…我知道,我……我认为……我想他跟着我走出了树林。
Well... I know, I... I think... I think he followed me out of the woods.

283
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:12,533
森林?
Which woods?

284
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:13,835
天啊，我不了解这片区域。
Oh, God, I don't know the area.

285
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:14,836
我在散步。
I was on a walk.

286
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,538
是田野上方的森林。
Erm, it was the forest just over the fields.

287
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:20,641
科森·伍兹，旧铁路线。
Mm, Cotson Woods, the old railway line.

288
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:22,944
对，他可能就睡在那里。
Yeah, that's probably where he was sleeping.

289
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:29,517
听着，那一定很可怕。
Look, it must've been very frightening.

290
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,052
我能理解。
I do understand.

291
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:34,956
但说实话，我觉得他是无害的。
But honestly, I think he's harmless.

292
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,891
他根本没有反抗。
He didn't resist at all.

293
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,860
看起来有点困惑，有点疯疯癫癫的。
Seemed a bit confused, bit of a nut, you know.

294
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:40,828
对,是的。
Right, yeah.

295
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:42,429
不过他臭气熏天。
He stinks to high heaven, though.

296
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:44,297
那个男人确实需要洗一洗。
That man is definitely in need of a wash.

297
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:46,409
我不指望开车送他去车站。
I'm not looking forward to driving him to the station.

298
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,836
我很高兴你在附近。
Well, I'm just glad you were nearby.

299
00:37:49,537 --> 00:37:51,038
我也是。
Me, too.

300
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:52,840
哦,不。他们来得非常快。
Oh, no. They came really quickly.

301
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:57,477
这真是太幸运了，因为我打赌他们的反应时间肯定会很慢。
Which is bloody lucky 'cause I bet their response time can be really slow out here.

302
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:01,448
请让我上去好吗?
Will you please let me come up?

303
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:02,482
不。
No.

304
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:04,886
哈珀，看在他妈的份上。
Harper, for fuck's sake.

305
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,522
哦，看在你妈的份上。
Oh, for fuck's sake yourself.

306
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:10,390
我不是来害怕的，莱丽。
I didn't come here to be afraid, Riley.

307
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:11,726
你想证明什么?
What are you trying to prove?

308
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,928
这与软弱无关。
This isn't about being weak.

309
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,897
是的,它不是。
Yeah, it isn't.

310
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,734
就是个怪人，好吗?
It was just some weirdo, okay?

311
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:24,605
警察说他不危险，反正他们已经抓到他了，所以…故事结束了。
And the police said he wasn't dangerous, and they've got him now anyway, so... End of story.

312
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:31,879
看，这是美丽乡村里一个安静、漂亮的村庄。
Look, it's a quiet, pretty village in beautiful countryside.

313
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:35,016
我要再做点工作，然后我要四处逛逛。
I'm gonna do a bit more work, and then I'm gonna have a wander around.

314
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:38,586
附近有座老教堂，而且，很显然，那家酒吧不错，所以……
There's an old church nearby, and, apparently, the pub's nice, so...

315
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,093
——好的。——好的。
- Okay. - Okay.

316
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:00,962
那是什么，詹姆斯?
What was that, James?

317
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:04,532
你想赢回我的心?
Your plan to win me back?

318
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:09,136
哈珀……出去。
Harper... Get out.

319
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:11,539
出去。
Get out.

320
00:41:11,572 --> 00:41:13,641
我…对不起,请。
I'm... I'm sorry, please.

321
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:17,511
滚出去!滚出去!
Get out! Get out!

322
00:41:17,545 --> 00:41:19,280
——哈,我……——出去!
- Harper, I... - Get out!

323
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,115
滚出去!
Get out!

324
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:22,883
我很抱歉!
I'm sorry!

325
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:25,720
不!你他妈想道歉?
No! You want to fucking apologize?

326
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:27,688
在威胁要自杀之后?
After threatening to kill yourself?

327
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:29,657
别麻烦了，我他妈不在乎!
Don't bother, I don't give a fuck!

328
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:34,795
没关系，因为不管你说什么，做什么，你都不会再见到我了。
It'll make no difference, because whatever you say, whatever you do, you will never, ever see me again.

329
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:37,231
现在给我滚出去!
Now get the fuck out!

330
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,154
你好。
Hello.

331
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,691
你是谁?
Who are you?

332
00:43:11,392 --> 00:43:13,694
嗯…我哈。
Uh... I'm Harper.

333
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:19,900
想玩个游戏吗?
Wanna play a game?

334
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:24,004
捉迷藏吗?
Hide and seek?

335
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:27,007
你隐藏。我会去找。
You hide. I'll seek.

336
00:43:29,176 --> 00:43:30,878
我…我…我想我做不到。
I... I... I don't think I can.

337
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:33,848
你无法隐藏吗?
You can't hide?

338
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:36,917
继续。
Go on.

339
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:38,319
我打赌你很擅长这个。
I bet you're good at it.

340
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:39,353
我擅长寻找。
And I'm good at seeking.

341
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:41,388
我只是现在没心情玩游戏。
I'm just not in the mood to play a game right now.

342
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:43,190
对不起。
Sorry.

343
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:46,660
撒母耳。回家了。
Samuel. Go home.

344
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:48,229
离这位女士远点。
Leave the lady alone.

345
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,197
不。我想和她玩个游戏。
No. I want to play a game with her.

346
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:53,901
她已经很清楚地告诉你她不想这样。
She's told you perfectly clearly she doesn't feel like it.

347
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,574
也许她以后会，但不是现在。
Perhaps she will later, but not right now.

348
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:57,938
你为什么不滚开?
Why don't you fuck off?

349
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:00,841
你先说。
You first.

350
00:44:13,754 --> 00:44:14,855
愚蠢的婊子。
Stupid bitch.

351
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:19,326
我向您道歉。
I do apologize.

352
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:22,930
塞缪尔是个深受困扰的男孩。
Samuel is a deeply troubled boy.

353
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:25,766
我住在伦敦，我习惯了孩子们骂我。
I live in London, I'm used to kids swearing at me.

354
00:44:27,468 --> 00:44:36,162
不太习惯他们骂牧师，但是…是的,但是,嗯…只是一件事。你介意吗?
Not so used to them swearing at vicars, but... Yes, but, um... Just one thing. Do you mind?

355
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:37,778
不。
No.

356
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:39,947
你很痛苦，是吗?
You're in pain, yes?

357
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:41,949
抱歉?
Sorry?

358
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:44,785
我刚才注意到你了，在教堂里，坐在长椅上。
I noticed you just now, in the church, sitting in the pews.

359
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:51,325
和…一开始，我以为你在祈祷，但后来我意识到你不是在祈祷。
And... At first, I thought you were praying, but then I realized you weren't praying.

360
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,261
你折磨。
You're tormented.

361
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,333
我没有主动，但当然，我应该主动的。
I didn't approach, but of course, I should have.

362
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:02,269
所以…我现在。
So... I am now.

363
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:06,240
你觉得我能帮忙吗?
Do you think I could help?

364
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:11,712
我不知道我是否……
I don't know if I'm...

365
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:17,985
折磨,但是……但是呢?
tormented, exactly, but... But?

366
00:45:18,018 --> 00:45:19,420
感觉更像……
It feels more like...

367
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:23,891
闹鬼吗?
Haunted?

368
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:26,493
是的。
Yeah.

369
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:33,500
我们坐一会儿吧。
Let's sit a while.

370
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:40,741
我和丈夫吵了一架。
I'd had a row with my husband.

371
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:44,144
我们分手了，然后…
We were separating, and...

372
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:50,851
但这是…这是迄今为止最糟糕的一次。
But this was... This was by far the worst.

373
00:45:56,824 --> 00:45:58,259
发生了一件事。
And something happened.

374
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:01,529
他打我。
He hit me.

375
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:10,371
他以前从来没有这样做过。
He'd never done that before.

376
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:14,441
我…我…我冲他尖叫，我很生气。
I... I... I screamed at him, I was so angry.

377
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:19,346
我让他离开，把他扔出去，锁上门。不让他回来。
I made him leave, threw him out, locked the door. Wouldn't let him back in.

378
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:35,129
然后，显然，接下来发生的事情是他把他的箱子推到楼上的公寓里，走到他们家的阳台上，想爬到我们家的阳台上，但他……他滑了一跤。还是……
Then, apparently, what happened next was he pushed his away into the flat upstairs, went to their balcony, tried to climb down to ours, but he... he slipped. Or...

379
00:46:41,502 --> 00:46:43,971
或者让他自己走。
Or let himself go.

380
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:49,577
我真的不知道。
I honestly don't know.

381
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:57,818
当他倒下时，我正往外看。
As he fell past, I was looking out.

382
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:00,555
他往里看。
And he was looking in.

383
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,394
感觉我们可以看到对方。
And it felt like we could see each other.

384
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:11,465
嗯…
Well...

385
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:15,903
我都不确定这是否可行。
Well, I'm not even sure if that's possible.

386
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,341
他能看见我吗?
Could he see me?

387
00:47:21,576 --> 00:47:22,644
是他吗?
As he fell?

388
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:26,614
事情发生得太快了，但我觉得是他干的。
It happened so quickly, but I think he did.

389
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:30,451
这就是困扰我的地方。
And that's what haunts me.

390
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:36,223
我明白了。
I see.

391
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,529
如果我可以…
If I may...

392
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:48,035
我觉得你需要被理解。
I think you need to be understood.

393
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:50,938
我能理解。
And I do understand.

394
00:47:53,407 --> 00:47:55,943
我完全可以想象这对你来说一定很可怕。
I can fully imagine it must be dreadful for you.

395
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:06,253
而且，不可避免地，你也会感到一种可怕的罪恶感。
And, inevitably, you also feel an awful sense of... of guilt.

396
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:09,256
这也困扰着你。
And that haunts you, too.

397
00:48:12,326 --> 00:48:15,929
烧焦的快照映像。
The seared snapshot image.

398
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:28,242
为什么，是的，你带着它。你……你闭上眼睛就能看到，但是…同时，你会不断地问自己:“如果……会怎么样?”
Why, yes, you carry it. You... You see it when you close your eyes, but... Also, you ask yourself repeatedly, "What if?"

399
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:30,978
“如果”。
"If only."

400
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,948
是的,我做的。是的。
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

401
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:52,266
是尖叫。
It's the screaming.

402
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,340
我想他不是在尖叫。
I think he wasn't screaming.

403
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:03,043
不,你的。
No, yours.

404
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,219
你一定很好奇你为什么逼他这么做?
You must wonder why you drove him to it?

405
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,392
什么?不是我逼他的。
What? I didn't drive him to it.

406
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:23,731
好吧,
Well,

407
00:49:26,768 --> 00:49:30,404
他打你之后，你给他道歉的机会了吗?
after he struck you, did you give him a chance to apologize?

408
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:34,709
什么?
What?

409
00:49:34,742 --> 00:49:36,243
……是吗?
Did... Did you?

410
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:43,518
不。我…我…男人有时确实会打女人。
No. I... I... Men do strike women sometimes.

411
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:45,720
这样不好，但也不算死罪。
It's not nice, but it's not a capital offense.

412
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:49,189
什么?
What?

413
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:52,259
你喜欢舒服的东西还是真实的东西?
You prefer things to be comfortable or true?

414
00:49:54,629 --> 00:50:00,467
如果你给他一个道歉的机会，他会不会还活着?
Might it be true that if you'd given him the chance to apologize, he'd still be alive?

415
00:50:04,137 --> 00:50:05,239
滚蛋。
Fuck off.

416
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:10,754
这些不是你问的问题吗?
Aren't these the questions you asked?

417
00:50:10,778 --> 00:50:12,212
滚蛋!
Fuck off!

418
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:38,225
“P-O”…“P-O”的东西,一些东西。
"P-O"... "P-O" something, something.

419
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,463
G，快点，杰弗里，发动引擎。
"G," come on, Geoffrey, fire up the engines.

420
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,736
啊!石榴。很好。
Ah! Pomegranate. Very good.

421
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:02,249
啊!夫人……女士…马洛女士。
Ah! Mrs... Ms... Ms. Marlowe.

422
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:03,918
来把村庄涂成红色，是吗?
Come to paint the village red, eh?

423
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:05,419
我只想喝一杯。
I just want a drink.

424
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:06,921
是啊，我很了解这种感觉。
Yeah, I know the feeling well.

425
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:10,625
小姐，要什么?
What'll it be, Miss?

426
00:53:10,658 --> 00:53:11,959
嗯,伏特加奎宁。
Um, vodka tonic.

427
00:53:11,993 --> 00:53:13,561
-马上就到。-哦，嘿，让我来。
- On its way. - Oh, hey, let me get it.

428
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:14,494
-不不不-不不不
- No, no, no. - No, no, no.

429
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:15,839
——绝对不是。我的呼喊。-我知道了。
- Absolutely not. My shout. - I've got it.

430
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:16,698
我懂了。哦,请。
I've got it. Oh, please.

431
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:18,599
富兰克林，她的钱在这里没用。
Franklin, her money's no good here.

432
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:19,734
你是正确的。
Right you are.

433
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:22,570
您好像没有法定货币。
It seems that you don't have legal tender.

434
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:24,404
谢谢你！
Thank you.

435
00:53:25,439 --> 00:53:26,574
记下来就行了。
Just, um, chalk it up.

436
00:53:29,711 --> 00:53:31,378
定居好吗?没有小精灵吗?
Settled in okay? No gremlins?

437
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:35,616
我刚才在教堂见过你。
I saw you at the church a little while ago.

438
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,350
你找到那扇彩色玻璃窗了吗?
You found the stained glass window?

439
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,046
你知道，在黎明的时候，太阳直接穿过它。
You know, at dawn, the sun shines straight through it.

440
00:53:40,788 --> 00:53:42,456
这是……这就是奇迹。
It's... It's miraculous.

441
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:44,959
你会沐浴在阳光中。
You'd be bathed in light.

442
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:47,662
去散步了吗?
Been for a walk yet?

443
00:53:48,963 --> 00:53:50,497
旧铁路线。
The old railway line.

444
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:53,544
你可以站在那里想象蒸汽火车——因为它们……-喂，喂。
You can stand there and imagine the steam trains - as they... - Oi to the oi.

445
00:53:53,568 --> 00:53:55,970
-穿过树林。——你好,吉米。
- Pass through the woods. - Hello, Jimmy.

446
00:53:56,003 --> 00:53:57,270
弗兰克。杰夫。
Frank. Geoff.

447
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:58,405
——品脱?——当然。
- Pint? - Of course.

448
00:53:59,674 --> 00:54:01,374
晚上,女士。
Evening, ma'am.

449
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:03,443
我希望你现在感觉不错。
I hope you're feeling okay now.

450
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:06,013
-不要太慌乱。好。谢谢。
- Not too rattled. - Mm, fine. Thanks.

451
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:07,691
你听说你租房子的事了吗?
You heard about that business at your rental?

452
00:54:07,715 --> 00:54:08,983
我的租金吗?什么业务?
My rental? What business?

453
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:11,052
是的。闯入者。
Yeah. Intruder on the property.

454
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:12,452
至少是在地面上。
Or on the grounds, anyway.

455
00:54:12,486 --> 00:54:13,621
嗯,肯定不是。
Well, surely not.

456
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:16,758
某个家伙，身无分文。
Some bloke, not a stitch of clothing on him.

457
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:17,992
我善良。
Goodness me.

458
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:20,027
当猫不在的时候，嗯?
When the cat's away, eh?

459
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:21,261
不。
No.

460
00:54:21,863 --> 00:54:22,897
不。
No.

461
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,732
是社区关怀型的。
Was a care of the community type.

462
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:26,067
斯塔克和疯子，是吗?
Starkers and bonkers, eh?

463
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,401
这是他。听起来你认识这个人，杰夫。
That's him. Sounds like you know the guy, Geoff.

464
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,805
-哦，别说了。-你查出他是谁了吗?
- Oh, stop it. - Did you find out who he is?

465
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:32,540
哦，我敢说，是个吉普赛人。
Oh, some gyppo, I dare say.

466
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:34,341
也许吧。
Maybe.

467
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:36,844
我很抱歉，马洛女士。
I'm so sorry, Ms. Marlowe.

468
00:54:36,878 --> 00:54:38,411
不，这不是你的错，杰弗里
No, it's not your fault, Geoffrey.

469
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:39,656
不，你一定很难过。
No, it must've been awful for you.

470
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,715
这是。
It was.

471
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:44,752
但他们现在抓到了他，所以…有他。
But they have him now, so... Had him.

472
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:46,754
一小时前才放了那个混蛋。
Had to release the bugger about an hour ago.

473
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:49,356
什么?
What?

474
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:52,093
你释放他吗?
You released him?

475
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:54,061
是的。是啊，不得不让他走。
Yeah. Yeah, had to let him go.

476
00:54:54,095 --> 00:54:55,295
为什么?
Why?

477
00:54:56,264 --> 00:54:58,465
没什么可指控他的，小姐。
Not much to charge him with, Miss.

478
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:01,102
他又没偷什么东西。
It's not like he stole anything.

479
00:55:01,135 --> 00:55:02,435
就一个苹果，杰夫。
Just one of your apples, Geoff.

480
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,404
偷窃!把他绞死!
Scrumping! Hang him!

481
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:07,675
是的，我们从失物招领处给了他一件夹克和裤子。
Yeah, we gave him a jacket and trousers from lost property.

482
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:10,511
-让他滚蛋。-他在跟踪我
- Sent him packing. - He was stalking me.

483
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:12,445
你为什么这么说?
What makes you say that?

484
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:13,781
我见过他两次。
I saw him twice.

485
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,683
你见过他两次。
You saw him twice.

486
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:21,932
但我不知道他有没有见过你。这是……这不算跟踪，对吧?
But I don't know if he saw you once. It's... It's not quite stalking, is it?

487
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:25,893
他跟着我出了树林，然后试图闯入房子。
He followed me out of the woods, then tried to break into the house.

488
00:55:28,428 --> 00:55:31,532
如果你再见到他，叫我们一声。
Well, you see him again, give us a shout.

489
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:40,440
你要离开吗?
You're leaving?

490
00:55:42,442 --> 00:55:43,778
他妈的枪手吗。
Fucking wankers.

491
00:57:17,071 --> 00:57:18,606
来吧，请接电话。
Come on, please pick up.

492
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,175
来吧。
Come on.

493
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,745
-别告诉我还有别的——还有更多。
- Don't tell me there's more. - There's more.

494
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:26,580
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

495
00:57:26,614 --> 00:57:27,648
我去散步了。
I went for a walk.

496
00:57:27,682 --> 00:57:30,918
我在教堂墓地遇到一个男孩他说我是个蠢婊子。
I meet a boy in a churchyard who tells me I'm a stupid bitch.

497
00:57:30,952 --> 00:57:35,957
然后我遇到牧师，他告诉我是我逼詹姆斯自杀的。
Then I meet Vicar who tells me that I drove James to kill himself.

498
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:41,128
然后我遇到一个警察，他告诉我他们刚刚释放了昨天试图闯入房子的裸体怪人。
Then I meet a policeman who tells me that they just released the naked weirdo who tried to break into the house yesterday.

499
00:57:41,162 --> 00:57:46,801
和…我…我完成了。我完成了。
And... I'm... I'm done. I'm done.

500
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:49,637
我这就上车回家。
I'm just gonna get in the car and go home.

501
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:51,739
他妈的。
Fuck this.

502
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:53,074
-是的。——没有。
- Yeah. - No.

503
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:56,110
他妈的。他妈的这大便。
Fuck this. Fuck this shit.

504
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:59,046
那栋房子是你唯一想要的东西。
That house was the one thing that you wanted for yourself.

505
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,782
你选择了一个疗伤的地方。
What you chose as a place to heal.

506
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:04,986
现在你要放弃了就因为那个该死的疯子!
And now you have to give it up because of some motherfucking nut!

507
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,621
你说要开多久?
How long did you say the drive was?

508
00:58:07,655 --> 00:58:08,656
三个小时吗?
Three hours away?

509
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:12,159
四。
Four.

510
00:58:12,193 --> 00:58:13,527
我三分钟就能搞定。
I'm gonna do it in three.

511
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:16,230
你和我，我们会玩得很开心的。
And you and me, we're gonna have a good fucking time.

512
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:17,898
是的。
We are.

513
00:58:17,932 --> 00:58:21,268
我们会一起散步，一起吃烤肉晚餐。
We're gonna go on walks, and we're gonna eat roast dinners.

514
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:34,582
还有冰淇淋，我会看着你晚上喝醉，如果那个该死的怪人回来，我就拿着斧头把他的鸡巴砍下来，让他窒息。
And ice cream, and I'm gonna watch you get pissed in the evenings, and if that fucking weirdo comes back, I'm gonna take that ax and chop his dick off, and he can fucking choke on it.

515
00:58:35,116 --> 00:58:36,250
ax什么?
What ax?

516
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:38,152
在你后面。
Behind you.

517
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:41,188
那么，我们要这么做吗?
So, do we do it?

518
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:45,926
只要五分钟，我就把东西塞进袋子里，然后在高速公路上乱扔。
Just five minutes for me to stick some shit in a bag, and I'll rag it up the motorway.

519
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:49,063
好吧。
Okay.

520
00:58:49,096 --> 00:58:50,531
地址是什么?
So, what's the address?

521
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:53,968
呃，等一下。
Uh, hang on a second.

522
00:58:56,337 --> 00:58:57,805
好吧。
Okay.

-你有笔吗?——是的。

And the postcode, uh... The postcode is HL89 3XR.

这座房子叫做棉花庄园。
The house is called Cotson Manor.

528
00:59:18,726 --> 00:59:20,895
大便。

00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:26,167
来吧。
Come on.

530

533
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,978
C-O-T-S-O-N。
C-O-T-S-O-N.

534
00:59:38,012 --> 00:59:41,248
邮编是HL89…
And the postcode is HL89...

535
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:56,797
对。
Right.

536
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:04,265
它是什么?发生了什么事?
What is it? What's happened?

537
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:10,671
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

538
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,341
他回来了吗?
Has he come back?

539
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:19,680
你为什么不回复?
Why aren't you replying?

540
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:25,119
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

541
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:58,752
你为什么…你为什么要这么做?
Why are you... Why are you doing this?

542
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:39,086
我有武器!
I have a weapon!

543
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,623
我说我有武器!
I said I have a weapon!

544
01:03:41,656 --> 01:03:43,390
如果你进来，我就用它!
If you come in here, I'm going to use it!

545
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:48,062
马洛女士，你到底在说什么?
Ms. Marlowe, what on earth are you talking about?

546
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:53,033
Geoff……这到底是怎么回事?
Geoff... What the hell is going on?

547
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:55,402
我听到尖叫声，然后窗户被打破了。
I heard screaming, and then a window break.

548
01:03:57,037 --> 01:03:59,273
在那里……有人。
There... There was someone.

549
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:02,209
有人试图闯入。
Someone tried to break in.

550
01:04:02,242 --> 01:04:04,244
是那个该死的男人吗?他回来了吗?
Was it that bloody man? Has he come back?

551
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:05,613
不。不!
No. Don't!

552
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:18,025
哦,上帝!
Oh, God!

553
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:25,165
哦，你这个可怜的家伙。
Oh, you poor thing.

554
01:04:30,471 --> 01:04:32,139
哦，对不起，老姑娘。
Oh, so sorry, old girl.

555
01:04:33,273 --> 01:04:35,008
哦，别看，马洛女士。
Oh, don't look Ms. Marlowe.

556
01:04:38,513 --> 01:04:40,582
很抱歉。
Sorry about that.

557
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:44,952
你看，那折断的翅膀。什么也做不了。
The broken wing, you see. Nothing to be done.

558
01:04:44,985 --> 01:04:47,522
但我很理解它为什么会吓到你。
But I quite understand why it gave you a fright.

559
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:50,424
但是外面有人。
But there was someone outside.

560
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:54,995
他想进去，想把门踢开。
He tried to get in, tried to kick the door in.

561
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:56,897
——谁?——警察。
- Who? - The policeman.

562
01:04:57,665 --> 01:05:00,100
——什么?-我看见警察了。
- What? - I saw the policeman.

563
01:05:00,134 --> 01:05:01,468
和另一个人。
And another man.

564
01:05:02,503 --> 01:05:05,172
这不是我编的。
I'm not making this up.

565
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:08,075
马洛女士，我看你不像个骗子。
Ms. Marlowe, you don't strike me as a liar.

566
01:05:08,108 --> 01:05:09,109
我相信你。
I believe you.

567
01:05:09,143 --> 01:05:11,579
毕竟，今天已经发生过一次了，不是吗?
After all, it's already happened once today, no?

568
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:22,356
,嗯…作为你的房东，我的责任是…好好看看周围。
And, uh... Well, as your landlord, it now falls on me to have a... a good look around.

569
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,458
把这些都清理干净。
Clear all of this up.

570
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:26,460
不，杰弗里，别出去。
No, Geoffrey, don't go outside.

571
01:05:26,493 --> 01:05:28,328
不,无稽之谈。
No, nonsense.

572
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:30,264
身陷困境的少女，我就是那个人。
Damsel in distress, I'm just the fellow.

573
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:31,498
杰弗里,不!
Geoffrey, don't!

574
01:05:35,436 --> 01:05:39,006
"你完全具备了一个失败军人的品质"
"You have precisely the qualities "of a failed military man."

575
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,109
什么?
What?

576
01:05:42,142 --> 01:05:43,310
这是父亲告诉我的。
Father told me that.

577
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:47,181
那时我只有七岁。
I was only seven years old.

578
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:49,675
是时候让他见识见识了?
Time we showed him what's what, eh?

579
01:06:00,762 --> 01:06:02,095
杰弗里?
Geoffrey?

580
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:06,133
这是更好的。
That's better.

581
01:06:10,572 --> 01:06:11,706
清楚。
All clear here.

582
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:41,603
现在,看这里!
Now, look here!

583
01:06:43,505 --> 01:06:49,677
不管外面是谁，我不知道你在玩什么把戏，但是…我不会接受的。
Whoever's out there, I don't know what you think you're playing at, but... it's not gonna sit well with me.

584
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:52,446
不是一点。
Not one bit.

585
01:06:54,414 --> 01:06:55,583
你听到吗?
Do you hear?

586
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:03,791
在我看来他们可能已经走了。
Seems to me like they might've gone.

587
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,968
你真的伤害了我。
You really hurt me.

588
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:02,083
看看你做了什么。
Look what you did.

589
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:05,720
离我远点。
Stay away from me.

590
01:13:07,588 --> 01:13:08,723
你现在打算怎么办?
What are you gonna do now?

591
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:11,125
再次伤害我吗?
Hurt me again?

592
01:13:11,893 --> 01:13:12,960
再刺我吗?
Stab me again?

593
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:16,697
你的意思。
You're so mean.

594
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:18,699
你甚至不会玩捉迷藏的游戏。
You wouldn't even play a game of hide and seek.

595
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:23,470
但我想你现在会了。
But I think you will now.

596
01:13:24,672 --> 01:13:27,074
我他妈要宰了你。
I will fucking cut you.

597
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:36,117
我将这样做。
I'll do it.

598
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:38,552
我想你不会的。
I don't think you will.

599
01:13:55,603 --> 01:13:57,204
但你也许应该这么做。
But you probably should.

600
01:13:59,073 --> 01:14:00,741
这是你最后的机会了。
It'll be the last chance you get.

601
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:07,848
很好，所以你躲起来了。
Good, so you're hiding.

602
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:09,984
我数到十。
I'll count to ten.

603
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:14,789
一个,两个……
One, two...

604
01:14:17,558 --> 01:14:23,698
三个……四个……你应该找个地方躲起来，我知道你在哪里。
three... four... You should be finding somewhere to hide, I know where you are.

五，六，七，八，九

01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:46,187
准备好了没有，我来了。
Ready or not, here I come.

"A shudder in the loins "engenders there "The broken wall, "the burning roof and tower

”与阿伽门农

610

“死了。”
"dead."

611
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:55,382
你他妈是什么东西?
What the fuck are you?

612
01:17:02,089 --> 01:17:03,257
一只天鹅。
A swan.

613
01:17:16,003 --> 01:17:17,638
你什么时候破处的?
When did you lose your virginity?

614
01:17:22,476 --> 01:17:24,211
什么?
What?

615
01:17:24,245 --> 01:17:28,015
我是问你，你是几岁破处的。
I'm asking you at what age you lost your virginity.

616
01:17:32,419 --> 01:17:34,121
我一直在考虑这件事。
I've been thinking about it.

617
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:37,691
我想象过你。
I have pictured you.

618
01:17:39,793 --> 01:17:41,128
双腿打开。
Legs open.

01:17:48,035 --> 01:17:49,203
张着嘴。
Mouth open.

621
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:56,710
我认为你是肉欲方面的专家。
I have decided that you are an expert in carnality.

622
01:17:59,146 --> 01:18:04,718
一个探索了所有他们能做的事情的人，
Someone who has explored all the things that they can do,

623
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:08,088
并对他们做了什么。

624
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:18,399
这些东西现在都存在于我的脑海中。

这就是你的力量。

626
01:18:26,106 --> 01:18:29,243
这是你施加的控制。
This is the control that you exert.

627
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:41,255
"我一定要赢，那是赢不了的，
"I must be won, that cannot win,

628
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:51,065

”或被撤销”。
"or be undone."

630
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,818
你在对我唱歌。
You are singing to me.

631
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:18,259
不是尤利西斯，而是水手。
Not as Ulysses but as sailor.

632
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:24,031
把我撕成碎片
To dash me to pieces

633
01:19:27,835 --> 01:19:29,036
在这岩石上…
on the rocks of this...

634
01:19:32,006 --> 01:19:33,874
这些岩石。
These rocks.

01:19:42,216 --> 01:19:44,485
这个…
This...

638
01:19:46,887 --> 01:19:48,022
这是什么?
What is this?

是的。
Yes.

640

这是刀刃的尖端。
It's the tip of the blade.

642
01:22:22,009 --> 01:22:23,277
杰弗里。

马洛女士吗?
Ms. Marlowe?

647
01:22:55,175 --> 01:22:56,977
马洛夫人!
Mrs. Marlowe!

648
01:33:21,402 --> 01:33:22,903
看着我，哈珀。
Look at me, Harper.

649
01:33:30,244 --> 01:33:31,345
所以我就死了。
So I died.

650
01:33:33,681 --> 01:33:36,150
我的胳膊被铁栏杆划破了。
My arm was ripped through by an iron railing.

651
01:33:39,153 --> 01:33:40,721
我的脚踝断了。
My ankle snapped.

652
01:33:41,856 --> 01:33:43,924
我的内脏被压碎了。
My internal organs, crushed.

653

这就是你所做的。

詹姆斯……
James...
