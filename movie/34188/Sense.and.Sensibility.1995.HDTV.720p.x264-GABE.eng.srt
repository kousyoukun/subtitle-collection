1
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,118
Your son is arrived from London.

2
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,836
- Father ... - John ...

3
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:22,695
You will see in my will the estate of Norland was left to me in a way -

4
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:28,552
- that prevents me from dividing it between my two families.

5
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:36,610
Norland, in its entirety, is therefore yours by law.

6
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:41,991
And l am happy for you and Fanny.

7
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:50,915
But your stepmother, my wife and daughters are left only 500 a year.

8
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:55,369
Barely enough to live on. Nothing for the girls' dowries.

9
00:01:57,163 --> 00:02:02,530
- You must help them. - Of course.

10
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,706
You must promise to do this.

11
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:12,234
l promise, Father. l promise.

12
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:15,814
Help them? What do you mean?

13
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:22,817
l mean to give them 3,000. The interest will be an extra income.

14
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:29,923
- The gift will fulfil my promise. - Without question. More than amply.

15
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,562
One had rather. on such occasions. do too much than too little.

16
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:40,551
Of course, he did not stipulate a particular sum.

17
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:45,637
What do you say to 1,500, then?

18
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:50,918
What brother would be so kind to his real sisters. let alone half-blood?

19
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:56,960
- They can hardly expect more. - What can you afford?

20
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:06,626
100 a year to their mother is better than losing 1,500 at once.

21
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:12,640
Should she live longer than 15 years we'd be completely taken in.

22
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,674
People live forever when an annuity is to be paid them.

23
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:23,658
20 now and then will amply discharge my promise, you're right.

24
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:29,283
l'm convinced that your father had no idea of giving them money.

25
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,764
- They will have 500 a year. - What more could they want for?

26
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:40,584
No housekeeping, carriage, horses, few servants, keeping no company ...

27
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:42,850
How comfortable!

28
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:47,524
They will be much more able to give you something.

29
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:11,622
Marianne. can you play something else?

30
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:15,528
Mamma has been weeping since breakfast.

31
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,015
l meant something less mournful.

32
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:34,092
A visitor in my own home! lt is not to be borne. Elinor.

33
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,612
- Mamma, we have nowhere to go. - John and Fanny will be here soon.

34
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:46,124
Do you expect me to be here to welcome them? Vultures!

35
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,347
l will start making inquiries for a new house at once.

36
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:06,980
Until then, we must try to bear their coming.

37
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:14,632
Margaret, are you there? Come down, John and Fanny will be here soon.

38
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:21,162
Why are they to live at Norland? They have a house in London.

39
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:27,684
Houses go from father to son, not father to daughter. lt is the law.

40
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:35,209
- Come, we'll play with your atlas. - lt's not mine. it's their atlas.

41
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:44,102
Do sit down.

42
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:52,582
We are looking for a new home, and can only retain Thomas and Betsy.

43
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,846
We're sorry to have to leave you all.

44
00:05:56,175 --> 00:06:02,055
But we are certain you will find the new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.

45
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:07,304
My only real concern is how long it will take them to move out.

46
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:33,194
- How is Mrs. Ferrars? - She is always in good health.

47
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,308
My brother is with her this season. Quite the most popular bachelor.

48
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:40,549
He has his own barouche.

49
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:50,218
- You have two brothers? - Yes. Edward is the elder.

50
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,504
He's travelling up from Plymouth and will break his journey here.

51
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:03,972
- lf that is agreeable to you. - Dear John ...

52
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:07,533
This is your home now.

53
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:16,198
- Fanny wants the key to the silver. - What does Fanny want with it?

54
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:20,970
One can presume she wants to count it. What are you doing?

55
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:27,723
Gifts for the servants. Where is Margaret? She's taken to hiding.

56
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:34,377
- At least she can escape Fanny. - You've not said a word to her.

57
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:38,828
l have. l've said yes and no.

58
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:53,964
Good morning, Fanny.

59
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:58,858
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

60
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:02,284
How did you find the silver? Was it all genuine?

61
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:08,905
- When may we expect your brother? - Edward is due tomorrow.

62
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:16,653
He will not stay long. Will Margaret give up her room for him?

63
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:22,825
The view is incomparable, and l want him to see Norland at its best.

64
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:48,456
Mrs. Dashwood. Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.

65
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,853
My brother, Edward Ferrars.

66
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:54,541
Do sit down.

67
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:03,399
Where is Miss Margaret? l'm beginning to doubt of her existence.

68
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:08,879
Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My youngest is shy of strangers at present.

69
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:16,358
l am shy of strangers myself, and l have nothing like her excuse.

70
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:19,211
How do you like your view, Mr. Ferrars?

71
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:27,304
Very much. Your stables are handsome and beautifully kept.

72
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:30,863
Stables? Your windows overlook the lake.

73
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:37,100
An error led me to a family room, but l've rectified the situation.

74
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:41,671
l am happily installed in the guest quarters.

75
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,133
Tea!

76
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:51,470
They're all spoilt. Miss Margaret is always up trees and under furniture.

77
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:54,992
l've barely had a civil word from Marianne.

78
00:09:55,282 --> 00:10:01,577
They've just lost their father. Their lives will never be the same.

79
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,006
That is no excuse.

80
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,226
Library.

81
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:17,805
- These are mostly foreign. - lndeed. Magnificent.

82
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:21,481
l've never liked the smell of books.

83
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:27,495
The dust, perhaps. l hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.

84
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:32,399
l shall have it knocked down to make place for a Grecian temple.

85
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:37,676
That does sound interesting. Would you show me the site?

86
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:49,070
Too expensive, and we do not need four bedrooms. We can share.

87
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,753
This one. then.

88
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,149
We have only 500 a year.

89
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,997
l'll send out more inquiries today.

90
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:09,322
Pardon my intrusion, but l think l have found what you're looking for.

91
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:21,742
Won't you come out? We haven't seen you all day.

92
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:28,463
We'll have to enlarge it. Mattocks will help you adjust to our hours.

93
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:39,502
Forgive me, do you by any chance have a reliable atlas?

94
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:44,880
- l believe so. - l must check the Nile's position.

95
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,782
My sister tells me it is in South America.

96
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:54,859
No! No, she's quite wrong.

97
00:11:56,052 --> 00:12:00,045
l believe it is in Belgium.

98
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:03,440
Surely not. You must be thinking of the Volga.

99
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:09,328
- The Volga, which starts in ... - ln Vladivostok. and ends in ...

100
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:13,515
- Wimbledon. - Yes. where coffee beans come from.

101
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:17,042
The source of the Nile is in Abyssinia.

102
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:21,773
ls it? lnteresting.

103
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:27,469
- How do you do? Edward Ferrars. - Margaret Dashwood.

104
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:32,815
lt adjoins this property, and would be a desirable addition.

105
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:37,965
- l'll ride there and speak to ... - Gibson.

106
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:45,330
- He'll be pleased enough to sell. - He'll want more than it is worth.

107
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:16,463
Have l hurt you?

108
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:19,092
Thank you. Forgive me.

109
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:23,124
That was my father's favourite.

110
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:31,636
Thank you for helping Margaret. She's changed since you came.

111
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:34,797
l enjoy her company.

112
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:38,956
- Has she shown you the tree house? - Not yet.

113
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:44,493
Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood?

114
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:48,468
- lt is very fine out. - With pleasure.

115
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:54,958
- Margaret always wanted to travel. - l know. She's off to China soon.

116
00:14:55,287 --> 00:15:01,200
l'm to go as her servant, on the understanding l'll be badly treated.

117
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:07,627
- What will your duties be? - Sword fighting and swabbing.

118
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,348
Which will take precedence?

119
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:23,892
All l have ever wanted is the quiet of a private life.

120
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:29,233
But my mother is determined to see me distinguished.

121
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:36,018
Orator. Politician. Even a barrister would do. if l drove a barouche.

122
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:38,929
What do you wish for?

123
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:43,925
l prefer the church, but that is not smart enough for my mother.

124
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:48,406
She prefers the army, but that is too smart for me.

125
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:52,241
- Would you stay in London? - l hate London.

126
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,618
Country living is my ideal. A small parish where l might do some good.

127
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,654
Keep chickens ... Give very short sermons.

128
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:10,257
You feel idle and useless. lmagine how that is compounded -

129
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,400
- when one has no choice of any occupation whatsoever.

130
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,818
Our circumstances are therefore precisely the same.

131
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:25,682
Except that you will inherit your fortune.

132
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:29,395
We cannot even earn ours.

133
00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:36,148
Perhaps Margaret is right. Piracy is our only option.

134
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,914
What is swabbing exactly?

135
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:46,648
''No voice divine the storm allayed. No light propitious shone.''

136
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:51,890
''When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone.''

137
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:57,235
''But I, beneath a rougher sea, and whelmed in deeper gulfs than he ...''

138
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,350
No. Edward.

139
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:03,983
''No voice divine the storm allayed. No light propitious shone.''

140
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:08,307
''When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone.''

141
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:13,237
Can you not feel his despair? Try again.

142
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:24,208
''No voice divine the storm allayed. No light propitious shone.''

143
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:29,873
''When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone.''

144
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,000
Mamma ...

145
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,010
Mamma ...

146
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:41,234
Look. This has just arrived.

147
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:47,120
''l should be pleased to offer you a home at Barton Cottage, as soon ...''

148
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:51,542
- lt's from Sir John Middleton. - Even Elinor must approve the rent.

149
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,551
- Has she not yet seen this? - No. l will fetch her.

150
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:58,964
Wait, let us delay.

151
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:05,106
l believe that Edward and Elinor have formed an attachment.

152
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:09,941
lt would be cruel to take her away so soon. Devonshire is so far.

153
00:18:10,234 --> 00:18:15,601
- Do you disapprove her choice? - By no means.

154
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,403
- Edward is very amiable. - Amiable? But ..?

155
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:25,848
There is something wanting. He is too sedate. His reading ...

156
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,302
Elinor has not your feelings.

157
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:35,573
Can he love her? Can the soul be satisfied with polite affections?

158
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:40,437
To love is to be on fire. Like Juliet. Guinevere. Heloise.

159
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,007
- They made rather pathetic ends. - Pathetic? To die for love?

160
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:50,073
- What could be more glorious? - Your romantic sensibilities ...

161
00:18:57,563 --> 00:19:04,403
''ls love a fancy or a feeling? No, it is immortal as immaculate truth.''

162
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:08,724
'''Tis not a blossom shed when youth drops from life's stem.''

163
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:14,714
''lt grows without water, nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom.''

164
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:20,976
A pity Edward has no passion for reading.

165
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:26,097
You asked him to read. then you made him nervous.

166
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:34,226
Your behaviour is cordial. You like him in spite of his reading.

167
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:40,687
l think him everything that is amiable and worthy.

168
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:43,888
Praise. indeed.

169
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:49,044
He shall have my devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother.

170
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:53,495
- What shall l do without you? - Without me?

171
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,194
I'm sure you will be very happy, but promise you won't live far away.

172
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:05,584
- There is no question of ... - Do you love him?

173
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:14,131
l do not deny that l think very highly of him. That l ...

174
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:19,959
... greatly esteem him. l like him.

175
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:25,467
Esteem? Like? Use these words again and l shall leave the room!

176
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:33,130
Believe my feelings to be stronger. Further than that. do not believe.

177
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:37,718
ls love a fancy or a feeling?

178
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:41,906
- Or a Ferrars? - Go to bed.

179
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:47,130
''l do not deny that I think very highly of him.''

180
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:51,703
''That l ... greatly esteem him.''

181
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,950
''That l like him.''

182
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:19,154
We are so happy that you invited Edward to Norland.

183
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,786
We're all very fond of him.

184
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:28,027
We have great hopes for him. Mother expects much of him.

185
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:35,025
And in marriage. She's determined both he and Robert will marry well.

186
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:39,122
But l hope she desires them to marry for love.

187
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:45,912
The heart doesn't always lead us in the most suitable direction.

188
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:53,461
Edward is a compassionate person. Penniless women prey on that type.

189
00:21:53,566 --> 00:22:00,374
Having entered into an understanding he would never go back on his word.

190
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:04,018
But it would lead to his ruin.

191
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:09,527
l'm worried. Mother will withdraw all financial support from him -

192
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:17,110
- should he plant affection in less exalted ground than he deserves.

193
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:22,106
l understand you perfectly.

194
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:27,802
Devonshire?

195
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:31,225
My cousin, Sir John Middleton, has offered us a small house.

196
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,290
He must be a man of property.

197
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,463
He's a widower from Barton Park. It is Barton Cottage he has offered.

198
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:45,370
A cottage? Charming. A cottage is always very snug.

199
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:50,396
You will not leave before the summer?

200
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:55,639
We can no longer trespass upon your sister's goodwill.

201
00:22:55,934 --> 00:23:00,156
- You will come and stay with us. - l should like that.

202
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:03,794
Edward has long been expected by our mother.

203
00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:09,659
Come as soon as you can, Edward. Remember, you're always welcome.

204
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,577
- Can't you take him with you? - We can't afford him.

205
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:46,165
Perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen ... Forgive me.

206
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,185
Miss Dashwood ...

207
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:58,707
Elinor ... l must speak to you.

208
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,022
There is something of great importance that l need to ...

209
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:13,940
... tell you ... about my education.

210
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,145
- Your education? - Yes.

211
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,004
lt was conducted. oddly enough, in Plymouth.

212
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:32,601
- Do you know it? - Plymouth? No.

213
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,610
l was four years there.

214
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:42,776
ln a school run by Mr. Pratt.

215
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,648
- Pratt? - Precisely. Pratt.

216
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:53,782
While l was there ...

217
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,902
That is to say, he had a ... has a ...

218
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:06,261
You're needed in London this instant.

219
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,637
- l'm leaving this afternoon. - Mamma wishes you to leave at once.

220
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,979
Excuse me.

221
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:50,525
Edward promised he would bring the atlas to Barton.

222
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:54,911
l'll wager he will do so in less than a fortnight.

223
00:25:56,993 --> 00:25:58,935
Dear Edward ...

224
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,485
Hello there!

225
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,622
Sir John ...

226
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:43,512
Dear ladies! Upon my word! Here you are!

227
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:49,560
- Sir John, your kindness ... - None of that! Hush, please!

228
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:53,272
Here is my dear mamma-in-law, Mrs. Jennings.

229
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:59,254
You must be Mrs. Dashwood. Was yourjourney tolerable? Poor souls!

230
00:26:59,522 --> 00:27:02,937
Why did you not come up to the park first?

231
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:08,831
- We saw you pass. - l made John call the carriage.

232
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:12,732
- She would not wait. - We have so little company.

233
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:16,670
l feel as though l know you already. Delightful creatures!

234
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:23,038
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily. - Dear Sir John. we cannot ...

235
00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:30,716
No refusals! l'm quite deaf to them. But l insist!

236
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:34,394
Let us settle in. But thank you very much.

237
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:04,289
Send your man up for the carriage as soon as you're ready. Goodbye.

238
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:08,223
Don't thank us.

239
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:29,594
Your feet are cold.

240
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:57,917
What have you been doing? You can grow potatoes in this dirt.

241
00:28:58,212 --> 00:29:01,343
lt's cold. l'm cold.

242
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:15,770
Where can Brandon be? l hope he's not lamed his horse.

243
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:20,475
Col. Brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county.

244
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:26,587
He is bound to go for one of you. He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.

245
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:31,836
But l dare say she's left her heart behind in Sussex.

246
00:29:32,132 --> 00:29:36,507
l see you, Miss Marianne! l think l've unearthed a secret.

247
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:39,357
You are worse than my best pointer.

248
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:47,716
ls he a butcher. baker. candlestick maker? l'll winkle it out of you.

249
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:54,233
- She's good at winkling. - We've none of us any secrets here.

250
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,045
Or if we do. we do not keep them long.

251
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:03,133
- He's curate of the parish. - Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

252
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:07,290
- Give us a clue. ls he in uniform? - He has no profession.

253
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:11,648
He's a gentleman?

254
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:19,164
- You know there is no such person. - There is. His name begins with F.

255
00:30:19,461 --> 00:30:23,868
F? A promising letter.

256
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:30,659
Foster? Forrest? Fotheringay? Featherty?

257
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:33,153
- Fortescue? - Fondant?

258
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:38,754
Might l play your pianoforte?

259
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:43,163
Yes. of course.

260
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,936
- We don't stand on ceremony here. - Please forgive ...

261
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:53,214
l cannot remember when we last had a song in the house.

262
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:14,499
Brandon! Come and meet our beautiful new neighbours.

263
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:21,053
What a pity you're late. You have not heard our songbird.

264
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:23,390
A great pity.

265
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:28,323
This is my good friend Col. Brandon. We served in the East lndies.

266
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:33,797
- Not a better fellow in the world. - You've been to the East lndies?

267
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:37,058
- What's it like? - Hot.

268
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,923
The air is full of spices.

269
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:48,322
Now. Miss Dashwood. it's your turn to entertain us.

270
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:52,958
And l believe l know what key you will sing in.

271
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:56,604
F-major ...

272
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:12,614
You have no right to parade your ignorant assumptions ...

273
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:17,278
- You told me. - l told you nothing.

274
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:22,398
- They'll meet him when he comes. - You don't speak of such things.

275
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:26,307
- Everyone else was. - Mrs. Jennings is not ''everyone''.

276
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:30,406
l like her. She talks about things. We never talk about things.

277
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:38,780
lf you can say nothing appropriate, limit your remarks to the weather.

278
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,229
Surely they have enough reeds for a Moses basket.

279
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:24,896
You know what they're saying?

280
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:32,520
Word is, you've developed a taste for certain company. And why not?

281
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:37,601
A man like you in his prime ... She'd be a fortunate young lady.

282
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:41,574
Marianne Dashwood would no more think of me than of you.

283
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:47,745
- Don't think of yourself so meanly. - And all the better for her.

284
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:17,343
Besotted ... An excellent match.

285
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:22,279
- He's rich and she's handsome. - How long have you known him?

286
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:27,206
As long as l've been here, and l came 15 years back.

287
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:32,102
His estate is but four miles hence. He and John are very thick.

288
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:36,168
He has no wife and children. He had a tragic history.

289
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:43,908
He loved a ward to the family. They were not permitted to marry.

290
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:47,463
- On what grounds? - Eliza was poor.

291
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:52,968
She was flung out of the house, and he was packed off to the army.

292
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:55,844
l think he'd have done himself harm if not for John.

293
00:35:57,419 --> 00:36:02,754
- What became of the lady? - She was passed from man to man.

294
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,919
She disappeared from good society.

295
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:09,862
When Brandon returned from lndia he searched and searched. -

296
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:13,153
- only to find her dying in a poorhouse.

297
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:19,462
l thought my daughter Charlotte might have cheered him up.

298
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:25,286
Look at him now! So attentive!

299
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:32,898
- l should try a little experiment. - Please. let the colonel alone.

300
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:35,650
All suitors need a little help.

301
00:36:35,947 --> 00:36:43,846
- We haven't heard you play of late. - You have a superior musician here.

302
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:51,557
Brandon shares your passion for music. He plays the pianoforte well.

303
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:56,585
You know as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne.

304
00:36:57,835 --> 00:37:03,050
You must play us a duet. Let us see you both side by side.

305
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:08,512
l do not know any duets. Forgive me, Colonel.

306
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:19,621
Will we never have peace? The rent is low. but it comes on hard terms.

307
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:24,705
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's daughters.

308
00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:26,857
There's a parcel arrived.

309
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:31,107
Look!

310
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:38,930
When is a man safe from such wit. if infirmity does not protect him?

311
00:37:39,276 --> 00:37:42,090
lf he is infirm. then l am at death's door.

312
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:49,285
- He complained of rheumatism. - ''A slight ache'' was his phrase.

313
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:57,446
Edward said he would bring it himself.

314
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:06,337
''lt gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its owner.''

315
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:12,649
''Business prevents my delivering it, which will hurt me more than you.''

316
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:16,965
''Memories of your kindness must sustain me. and l remain -

317
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,358
- your devoted servant, E.C. Ferrars.''

318
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:23,275
- Why hasn't he come? - He says he's busy, dear.

319
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:31,812
- He said he'd come. Why hasn't he? - l'm taking you for a walk.

320
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:37,094
- lt is going to rain. - lt is not going to rain.

321
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:42,368
l fear Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.

322
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,955
- You must miss him. Elinor. - We are not engaged, Mamma.

323
00:38:54,061 --> 00:39:00,487
- But he loves you, dearest. - l am by no means assured of that.

324
00:39:00,781 --> 00:39:06,345
And had he such a preference, there would certainly be obstacles -

325
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:11,784
- to his marrying a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar.

326
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:18,307
- But your heart must tell you ... - lt is better to use one's head.

327
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:30,371
- lt can't be good for me. - lt is. Stop complaining.

328
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:34,978
- lt's giving me a cough. - lt is not giving you a cough.

329
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:39,716
lt's lovely. Come on, catch up!

330
00:39:40,782 --> 00:39:45,932
- Over there is a field of rabbits. - l don't want to see rabbits.

331
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:56,168
- ls anything superior to this? - l told you it would rain.

332
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:02,180
- Blue sky! Let us chase it! - l'm not supposed to run.

333
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:09,479
Are you hurt?

334
00:40:11,182 --> 00:40:18,089
- l cannot walk. Run and fetch help. - l will run as fast as l can.

335
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:31,146
Margaret!

336
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,870
Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.

337
00:40:44,782 --> 00:40:48,808
- Are you hurt? - Only my ankle.

338
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:53,956
May l have your permission to ascertain if there are any breaks?

339
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:14,025
lt is not broken.

340
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:18,531
Can you put your arm about my neck?

341
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,850
Allow me to escort you home.

342
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:30,185
At last!

343
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:34,570
She fell down and he's carrying her!

344
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,601
Marianne, are you hurt?

345
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:42,244
lt's a twisted ankle.

346
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:46,699
lt's not serious. l felt the bone. and it's sound.

347
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,499
- l cannot begin to thank you. - Do not think of it.

348
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,688
- Will you not be seated? - l'd leave a water mark.

349
00:41:56,015 --> 00:42:01,731
- But permit me to call tomorrow. - We shall look forward to it.

350
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:04,518
l'll show you out.

351
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,487
Margaret, get the gentleman's hat.

352
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:16,876
- His name! - To whom are we so much obliged?

353
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,982
John Willoughby of Allenham at your service.

354
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:23,271
John Willoughby of Allenham ...

355
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,679
What an impressive gentleman!

356
00:42:28,976 --> 00:42:33,253
He lifted me as if l weighed no more than a dried leaf.

357
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:38,374
- Tell me if l hurt you. - She feels no pain, Mamma.

358
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:42,795
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress.

359
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,469
Please don't say anything important.

360
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:51,372
- He expressed himself well. - With decorum and honour.

361
00:42:51,664 --> 00:42:55,558
- And spirit and wit and feeling. - And economy. Ten words at most.

362
00:42:55,825 --> 00:43:00,647
- Change, or you'll catch a cold. - What care l for colds?

363
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:05,646
- You'll care when your nose swells. - You're right. Help me.

364
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:13,515
He's worth catching. Marianne must not have all the men to herself.

365
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:20,136
- But what do you know of him? - There's not a bolder rider.

366
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:25,135
But what are his tastes. his passions, his pursuits?

367
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:35,170
- He has a smart little pointer ... - Where is Allenham?

368
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:40,714
Nice little estate three miles east. He is to inherit it from a relative.

369
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:44,805
Lady Allen is the name.

370
00:43:49,138 --> 00:43:53,328
lt's Col. Brandon. l should go out and keep watch.

371
00:43:55,889 --> 00:44:01,605
You're looking out for Willoughby. You'll not think of Brandon now.

372
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:04,361
Come in.

373
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:08,680
Good morning, Brandon.

374
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:14,641
- How is the invalid? - Thank you so much, Colonel.

375
00:44:14,961 --> 00:44:21,256
Why set your cap at Willoughby when you've already made such a conquest?

376
00:44:21,522 --> 00:44:24,424
l'll not set my cap at anyone.

377
00:44:24,754 --> 00:44:29,358
- Lady Allen's nephew? - He visits. for he's to inherit.

378
00:44:30,898 --> 00:44:37,772
He has a pretty estate of his own. Combe Magna in Somerset.

379
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:43,565
l'd not give him up to a younger sister for tumbling down hills.

380
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:53,263
The man himself. Come. Brandon. We know when we are not wanted.

381
00:44:54,354 --> 00:44:57,321
Thank you so much for calling.

382
00:44:58,546 --> 00:45:01,164
Marianne. the colonel and Sir John are leaving.

383
00:45:01,426 --> 00:45:04,240
Goodbye. Thank you for the flowers.

384
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:19,217
- How do you do, Colonel? - How do you do, more like.

385
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:43,848
- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure! - The pleasure is all mine.

386
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:48,784
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold? - You've found out my name.

387
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:54,377
The area is crawling with my spies. You cannot venture out to nature ...

388
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:59,278
- So nature must be brought to you. - How beautiful.

389
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:04,655
- These are not from the hothouse. - Mine is not the first offering.

390
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:13,050
- They come from an obliging field. - l always prefer wild flowers.

391
00:46:13,428 --> 00:46:17,650
- Would you ..? - Our gratitude is beyond words.

392
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:25,577
l've grieved for this lonely house. Then l heard it was taken.

393
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:31,952
l felt an interest which nothing can account for but my present delight.

394
00:46:32,276 --> 00:46:35,145
Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby.

395
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:40,048
Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?

396
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:44,050
- Marianne is reading them out. - And which are your favourites?

397
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,635
Mine is 1 16.

398
00:46:47,924 --> 00:46:51,469
''Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments.''

399
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:55,211
''Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds. -

400
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:58,988
- or bends with the remover to remove ...''

401
00:46:59,284 --> 00:47:04,106
- How does it continue? - ''No. it is an ever fixed mark ...''

402
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:10,634
- ''That looks on tempests...'' - ls it ''tempests''?

403
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:18,673
lt's strange you are reading these. l carry them with me always.

404
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,579
Until tomorrow then ...

405
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:37,555
My pocket sonnets are yours. A talisman against further injury.

406
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:40,266
Goodbye. Thank you.

407
00:47:45,717 --> 00:47:51,881
Good work. Marianne. You covered Shakespeare, Scott, poetry.

408
00:47:52,213 --> 00:47:58,159
When you know his views on romance, you'll have nothing left to talk of.

409
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:04,268
l suppose l erred against decorum. l should have talked of the weather.

410
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:08,493
Mr. WilIoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

411
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:11,723
Should l hide my regard?

412
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:17,487
- No. but we know so little of him. - Time does not determine intimacy.

413
00:48:17,782 --> 00:48:22,484
Seven years is too little for some, seven days is enough for others.

414
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:27,148
- Or seven hours. in this case. - l feel l know him already.

415
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:32,267
Had l more shallow feelings, l could perhaps conceal them as you do.

416
00:48:32,565 --> 00:48:36,721
- l'm sorry ... - Don't trouble yourself, Marianne.

417
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,957
l do not understand her.

418
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:13,071
Marianne ...

419
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:19,660
- Haven't you finished yet? - No. Patience.

420
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:34,671
You're not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?

421
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:39,505
- There is nothing under ten pence. - Do you want us to starve?

422
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:43,954
No. Just not to eat beef.

423
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:28,723
lf my behaviour was improper, l should be sensible of it.

424
00:50:29,015 --> 00:50:34,514
lt has caused impertinent remarks. Do you not doubt your discretion?

425
00:50:34,808 --> 00:50:40,405
lf Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove impropriety, we are all offending.

426
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:45,361
Good morning, Colonel.

427
00:50:45,432 --> 00:50:51,444
Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne. l come to issue an invitation.

428
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,408
A picnic on my estate at Delaford.

429
00:50:59,704 --> 00:51:02,671
lf you would care to join us on Thursday next.

430
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,764
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband are travelling up especially.

431
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,043
We should be delighted, Colonel.

432
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:19,508
l will, of course, be including Mr. Willoughby in the party.

433
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:21,806
l should be delighted to join you.

434
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,222
Good morning, Miss Dashwood. Good morning, Colonel.

435
00:51:31,513 --> 00:51:34,382
The colonel has invited us to Delaford.

436
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:40,081
- l hear you have a fine pianoforte. - A Broadwood Grand.

437
00:51:40,376 --> 00:51:45,394
- Then l shall play for you all. - We shall look forward to it.

438
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:04,848
- Your sister seems very happy. - She does not hide her emotions.

439
00:52:06,073 --> 00:52:10,710
Her romantic prejudices tend to set propriety at naught.

440
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:16,367
- She is wholly unspoilt. - Rather too unspoilt.

441
00:52:16,665 --> 00:52:21,585
The sooner she is acquainted with the ways of the world, the better.

442
00:52:25,305 --> 00:52:30,061
l knew a lady with the same sweetness of temper -

443
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:35,664
- who was forced into a better acquaintance with the world.

444
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:41,263
The result was only ruination and despair.

445
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:44,976
Do not desire it. Miss Dashwood.

446
00:52:47,513 --> 00:52:52,302
Col. Brandon's lawn is perfect for kite launching.

447
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,089
Mind the pretty ribbons.

448
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:02,479
lmagine my surprise when Charlotte and her master appeared with Lucy.

449
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,615
The last person l expected to see.

450
00:53:05,913 --> 00:53:10,452
She came to join in the fun. There is no such luxury at home.

451
00:53:10,746 --> 00:53:14,007
l'd not seen you for so long.

452
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:18,837
You sly thing! lt was the Dashwoods she wanted to see.

453
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,944
l've heard nothing but ''Dashwood'' for l don't know how long.

454
00:53:23,194 --> 00:53:29,238
What do you think of them? My mother wrote of little eIse in her letters.

455
00:53:29,562 --> 00:53:32,529
- Are they not as she described? - Nothing like.

456
00:53:33,914 --> 00:53:36,597
You are quite rude today.

457
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:42,323
He's to be an MP. and he is forced to make everybody like him.

458
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:48,334
- l said nothing so irrational. - Mr. Palmer's so droll.

459
00:53:48,635 --> 00:53:53,042
Here he comes! Now you shall see, Charlotte.

460
00:53:58,395 --> 00:54:01,558
Hello, Mr. Willoughby!

461
00:54:02,779 --> 00:54:06,521
You must meet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr. Palmer.

462
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:12,048
- And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele. - Welcome to our party.

463
00:54:18,395 --> 00:54:20,249
May l sit beside you?

464
00:54:21,499 --> 00:54:25,427
l've longed to meet you. I've heard nothing but praise for you.

465
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:32,930
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are too excessive in their compliments.

466
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:38,549
The praise came from another source. One not inclined to exaggeration.

467
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:41,745
What can this be?

468
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:53,913
ls Col. Brandon here?

469
00:55:03,643 --> 00:55:06,806
- My horse! - What's the matter?

470
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:09,881
- l must away to London. - lmpossible!

471
00:55:11,132 --> 00:55:16,434
We can't picnic without our host. Come up to town tomorrow.

472
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:23,191
- Or wait until we return. - l can't afford to lose one minute.

473
00:55:23,516 --> 00:55:27,793
- Forgive me. - l hope it's nothing serious.

474
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:32,599
Upon my soul, this is all very unusual.

475
00:55:34,043 --> 00:55:40,207
- Frailty, thy name is Brandon. - Some cannot bear pleasure.

476
00:55:40,444 --> 00:55:44,753
You are a wicked pair. Col. Brandon will be missed.

477
00:55:45,084 --> 00:55:51,575
Why? Everyone speaks well of him, but no one remembers to talk to him.

478
00:55:51,868 --> 00:55:55,413
Nonsense. He is highly respected at Barton Park.

479
00:55:55,709 --> 00:55:59,800
- Which is enough censure in itself. - Really, Willoughby.

480
00:56:00,092 --> 00:56:04,848
Come, come, Mr. lmpudence. l know your wicked ways.

481
00:56:05,148 --> 00:56:11,607
Reveal your beau. No secrets between friends. l'll winkle it out of you.

482
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:17,464
l'll have you married to the colonel by tea, or l'll swallow my bonnet.

483
00:56:19,228 --> 00:56:23,483
- As if you could marry him. - Why should you dislike him?

484
00:56:25,021 --> 00:56:29,363
Because he threatened me with rain when l wanted it fine.

485
00:56:29,693 --> 00:56:34,427
He found fault with my high flyer and will not buy my brown mare.

486
00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:39,222
If it will be of satisfaction to you, -

487
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:43,924
- l believe his character to be. in all other respects, irreproachable.

488
00:56:44,189 --> 00:56:49,623
ln return for this acknowledgement, don't deny me the privilege -

489
00:56:49,917 --> 00:56:54,008
- of disliking him as much as l adore ...

490
00:56:58,045 --> 00:57:01,306
... this cottage.

491
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:07,675
- l have plans for improvements. - That. l will never consent to.

492
00:57:07,997 --> 00:57:12,023
Not a stone must be added to its walls.

493
00:57:12,285 --> 00:57:17,074
Were l rich enough, l'd rebuild Combe Magna to this exact image.

494
00:57:17,341 --> 00:57:23,538
- With a fire that smokes? - Especially the fire that smokes.

495
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:28,660
Then l'd be as happy at Combe as l've been at Barton.

496
00:57:28,957 --> 00:57:34,172
But this place has one claim on my affections none other can share.

497
00:57:34,974 --> 00:57:37,527
Promise never to change it.

498
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:49,266
l'm honoured you risk your honour by seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

499
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:54,684
- That is what Elinor would say. - And she would be right.

500
00:57:54,974 --> 00:58:00,058
Miss Marianne, will you grant me an interview tomorrow ... alone?

501
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:04,572
- Willoughby, we are always alone. - But there is ...

502
00:58:04,863 --> 00:58:08,823
There is something very particular l should like to ask you.

503
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:14,781
Of course. l shall ask Mamma if I may stay behind from church.

504
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:18,459
Thank you.

505
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,860
Until tomorrow. then.

506
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:38,136
Oh. Virtue ...

507
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:43,164
Silently and with fear, enter the hearts of all that hear me this day.

508
00:58:44,415 --> 00:58:47,611
Will he kneel down when he asks her?

509
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,837
They always kneel down.

510
00:59:04,543 --> 00:59:07,325
What is wrong, dearest?

511
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:12,886
Willoughby? What is the matter?

512
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:17,143
Forgive me ... l am sent ...

513
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:23,222
Lady Allen exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin.

514
00:59:23,686 --> 01:07:07,930
- She is sending me to London. - This morning?

515
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:33,013
What a disappointment. Your business won't detain you for long, l hope?

516
00:59:33,343 --> 00:59:39,038
You are kind. but l have no idea of returning immediately to Devonshire.

517
00:59:40,288 --> 00:59:45,885
- l am invited only once a year. - Can you wait for our invitation?

518
00:59:47,808 --> 00:59:54,070
My engagements are of such a nature ... l dare not flatter my ...

519
00:59:55,584 --> 01:00:00,734
lt's folly to linger in this manner. l will not torment myself further.

520
01:00:01,024 --> 01:00:03,479
Willoughby, come back!

521
01:00:05,088 --> 01:00:08,055
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea for Marianne.

522
01:00:08,352 --> 01:00:13,786
- What is wrong, my love? - Do not ask me questions.

523
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:24,024
- They must have quarrelled. - That is unlikely.

524
01:00:25,408 --> 01:00:30,361
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves of his regard for Marianne.

525
01:00:30,656 --> 01:00:35,544
- An excuse to send him away. - Then why did he not say so?

526
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,997
- lt's not like him to be secretive. - What do you suspect?

527
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:47,031
- Why was his manner so guilty? - You think he's been acting a part?

528
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:52,031
- No. He loves her. l am sure. - Of course!

529
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:55,800
Has he left her any assurance of his return?

530
01:00:56,065 --> 01:00:58,431
Ask if he proposed.

531
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:03,707
No! l cannot force a confidence from Marianne. Neither should you.

532
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:07,830
We must trust her to confide in us in her own time.

533
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:12,408
There was something underhand in his manner.

534
01:01:12,705 --> 01:01:15,039
You will think the worst of him.

535
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:20,095
l give him the benefit of my good opinion. He deserves no less.

536
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,734
l am very fond of Willoughby.

537
01:01:24,033 --> 01:01:27,611
Mamma ... Mamma!

538
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:35,065
She would not let me in.

539
01:02:17,954 --> 01:02:22,329
- lf only this rain would stop. - lf only you would stop.

540
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:29,184
'Twas you took her off my hands, Mr. Palmer. A good bargain, too.

541
01:02:29,506 --> 01:02:34,656
Now l have the whip hand over you, for you cannot give her back.

542
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:42,367
Marianne, play with us. Looking at the weather will not bring him back.

543
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:47,741
- She ate nothing at dinner. - We're all forlorn these days.

544
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:54,076
Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now we might have our ... discussion.

545
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:59,324
- Our discussion? - l've longed to ask you something.

546
01:02:59,619 --> 01:03:04,834
You might think me impertinent. lt is an odd question.

547
01:03:06,147 --> 01:03:12,093
lf only he'd gone to Combe Magna. We live but half a mile away.

548
01:03:12,195 --> 01:03:18,872
- Five and a half. - l cannot believe it is that far.

549
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:22,530
- l can't believe it. - Try.

550
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:29,751
You may ask any manner of question if that is of any help.

551
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:35,963
Are you acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother Mrs. Ferrars?

552
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:42,320
Fanny's mother? No. l have never met her.

553
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:48,290
You must think me strange to ask. lf only l dared tell ...

554
01:03:48,586 --> 01:03:54,150
lf she tells you of the famous Mr. F, you must pass it on.

555
01:03:56,170 --> 01:04:00,512
Will you take a turn with me, Miss Dashwood?

556
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,850
l had no idea you were at all connected with that family.

557
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:13,060
l am nothing to Mrs. Ferrars at present.

558
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:20,390
But the time may come when we may be very intimately connected.

559
01:04:20,681 --> 01:04:23,648
What do you mean?

560
01:04:25,961 --> 01:04:28,775
Do you have an understanding with Fanny's brother Robert?

561
01:04:30,057 --> 01:04:35,905
The youngest? No. l have never met him in my life.

562
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:41,350
- With Edward. - Edward Ferrars?

563
01:04:42,536 --> 01:04:47,456
Edward and l have been secretly engaged these five years.

564
01:04:50,984 --> 01:04:53,602
You may well be surprised.

565
01:04:53,928 --> 01:04:58,532
l only mention it because l entirely trust you to keep our secret.

566
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:05,090
Edward looks on you quite as his own sister.

567
01:05:06,087 --> 01:05:09,435
l am sorry. Surely we ...

568
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:15,773
We surely do not mean the same Mr. Ferrars.

569
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:20,773
Yes. He was under the tutelage of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.

570
01:05:22,023 --> 01:05:27,424
- Has he never spoken of it? - Yes ... Yes. l believe he has.

571
01:05:30,087 --> 01:05:36,578
l wanted his mother's approval, but we loved each other so much.

572
01:05:38,182 --> 01:05:45,852
You must have seen how capable he is of making a woman attached to him.

573
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:52,091
l cannot pretend it has not been hard on both of us.

574
01:05:52,357 --> 01:05:56,993
We can scarcely meet above twice a year.

575
01:06:05,797 --> 01:06:09,593
You seem out of sorts. Are you quite well?

576
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:15,904
- l have not offended you? - l must know what you are saying.

577
01:06:16,165 --> 01:06:23,039
- Promise me you'll not tell a soul. - Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.

578
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:26,850
l give you my word.

579
01:06:27,141 --> 01:06:31,996
- What has so fascinated you? - Tell us all!

580
01:06:32,672 --> 01:06:39,203
- We were talking of London. - Do you hear that, Charlotte?

581
01:06:40,457 --> 01:06:43,087
- Charlotte and l concocted a plan. - The best plan in the world!

582
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:44,784
l make for London shortly, and l invite you, Lucy, -

583
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:48,199


584
01:06:49,177 --> 01:06:51,122
- and both the Misses Dashwood to join me.

585
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:54,393


586
01:06:56,606 --> 01:06:59,289
Can l go?

587
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:05,215
You will all come to my Chelsea home and taste of the season's delights.

588
01:07:03,998 --> 01:07:07,991


589
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:08,210
Please, can l go?

590
01:07:08,227 --> 01:07:14,904
- Do you not long for it to be so? - l came here with no other view.

591
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:22,331
- We can't leave our mother. - She can spare you very well.

592
01:07:22,627 --> 01:07:28,409
- Of course she can! - l could not be more delighted.

593
01:07:28,706 --> 01:07:33,659
l will brook no refusal. Let us strike hands on the bargain.

594
01:07:33,953 --> 01:07:40,215
lf l don't have you married by Michaelmas, it will not be my fault.

595
01:07:47,905 --> 01:07:51,200
l've never been so grateful.

596
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:56,409
l shall see Willoughby, and you will see Edward.

597
01:07:56,673 --> 01:08:01,691
- Are you asleep? - With you in the room?

598
01:08:02,721 --> 01:08:10,042
You can't feel as calm as you look. Oh, l will never sleep tonight.

599
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:14,460
What were you and Miss Steele talking about so long?

600
01:08:14,752 --> 01:08:17,850
Nothing of significance.

601
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:40,376
How do you think l like poking about in that big house without Charlotte?

602
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:47,257
l wrote to Edward, yet l do not know how much l may see of him.

603
01:08:47,551 --> 01:08:52,788
Secrecy is vital. He'll never be able to call.

604
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:57,591
My only comfort has been the constancy of his affection.

605
01:08:57,886 --> 01:09:03,319
You're fortunate never to have had any doubts on that score.

606
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:09,725
l am of a jealous nature. Had he talked more of one young woman ...

607
01:09:10,014 --> 01:09:14,454
But he's not given a moment's alarm on that count.

608
01:09:14,782 --> 01:09:18,556
lmagine how glad he'll be to learn that we are friends.

609
01:09:24,382 --> 01:09:28,822
- Have you missed me, Pigeon? - Very much, ma'am.

610
01:09:29,086 --> 01:09:34,802
- ls everything in order? - l suggest the ordering of coal.

611
01:09:35,101 --> 01:09:41,046
There you are, Pooter. Still alive, l see ... Tea, Pigeon.

612
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:46,675
You do not waste any time. Give it to Pigeon.

613
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:56,170
Mrs. Jennings says your sister will buy her wedding clothes in town.

614
01:09:57,181 --> 01:10:01,752
John and Fanny are in town. We should be forced to see them.

615
01:10:10,396 --> 01:10:14,072
l think it was for next door.

616
01:10:14,396 --> 01:10:19,513
Sit down for two seconds. You're making me nervous.

617
01:10:35,451 --> 01:10:38,298
Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.

618
01:10:39,003 --> 01:10:42,231
lndeed it is.

619
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,514
Excuse me. Colonel.

620
01:10:51,386 --> 01:10:53,841
Colonel ...

621
01:10:55,226 --> 01:10:59,568
What a pleasure to see you. Have you been in London all this while?

622
01:10:59,866 --> 01:11:02,582
What a pleasure to see you. Have you been in London all this while?

623
01:11:03,674 --> 01:11:08,278
l have heard reports through town ...

624
01:11:09,945 --> 01:11:13,873
Tell me once and for all:

625
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:18,675
ls everything resolved between your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

626
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:27,187
Though neither one has informed me of their understanding, -

627
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,578
- l have no doubt of their mutual affection.

628
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:35,511
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

629
01:11:36,953 --> 01:11:40,400
To your sister l wish all imaginable happiness.

630
01:11:41,752 --> 01:11:47,600
To Mr. Willoughby, that he may endeavour to deserve her.

631
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:52,880
What do you mean?

632
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:55,892
Forgive me ...

633
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:02,518
Forgive me.

634
01:12:13,559 --> 01:12:19,570
- Where is dear Edward. John? - And who is Edward?

635
01:12:19,863 --> 01:12:23,059
My brother. Mr. Edward Ferrars.

636
01:12:23,351 --> 01:12:28,369
Ferrars with an F?

637
01:12:33,078 --> 01:12:38,642
Are there any messages? No message at all? No cards?

638
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:44,531
- You do not ask for your messages. - No, for l do not expect any.

639
01:12:44,854 --> 01:12:48,050
l have very little acquaintance in town.

640
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:09,167
Not another word about the ham bone. You and Cartwright sort it out.

641
01:13:09,461 --> 01:13:14,795
- No messages. - Do not fret, my dear.

642
01:13:15,093 --> 01:13:19,631
This good weather is keeping many a sportsman in the country.

643
01:13:19,925 --> 01:13:23,983
But the frost will soon drive them to town. Depend on it.

644
01:13:24,277 --> 01:13:28,619
l had not thought of that.

645
01:13:28,948 --> 01:13:31,664
And Miss Dashwood may set her heart at rest, -

646
01:13:31,956 --> 01:13:37,138
- for your sister-in-law is inviting Mr. F to the ball tonight.

647
01:13:38,324 --> 01:13:42,284
Do be careful. the horses have been here.

648
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:47,499
lt is beginning to rain also. Follow me.

649
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:19,208
Mamma! This is very merry!

650
01:14:20,978 --> 01:14:26,280
- Do you spy anyone we know? - No. Mr. Palmer has a better view.

651
01:14:26,578 --> 01:14:30,472
- Do you see anyone we know? - Unfortunately not.

652
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:38,188
How can you be such a tease? There is Mrs. John Dashwood.

653
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:41,260
Come along, my dears.

654
01:14:45,137 --> 01:14:47,592
There you are!

655
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:53,222
How hot it is ... You are not alone. l trust?

656
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:57,350
John is just gone to fetch my brother.

657
01:14:57,649 --> 01:15:01,805
Your brother! l declare. this is good news, indeed.

658
01:15:03,569 --> 01:15:06,285
l shall faint clean away.

659
01:15:06,608 --> 01:15:11,309
Mrs. Jennings, l am pleased to meet you. My brother-in-law ...

660
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,020
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

661
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,614
Miss Dashwood. Miss Steele. Miss Marianne.

662
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,148
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

663
01:15:25,295 --> 01:15:29,091
You must be the younger brother. ls Mr. Edward not here?

664
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:34,147
- Miss Dashwood was counting on him. - He is far too busy.

665
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:37,894
There's no special acquaintance here to make his attendance worthwhile.

666
01:15:39,503 --> 01:15:44,074
What are the men about these days? Are they in hiding?

667
01:15:45,454 --> 01:15:51,782
ln the absence of your brother you must dance with Miss Dashwood.

668
01:15:55,535 --> 01:15:57,389
lt would be my honour.

669
01:16:03,502 --> 01:16:08,903
Perhaps Miss SteeIe might consider reserving the allemande?

670
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:51,461
You reside in Devonshire. Miss Dashwood?

671
01:16:55,021 --> 01:16:58,403
- ln a cottage? - Yes.

672
01:17:00,044 --> 01:17:03,873
l am excessively fond of a cottage.

673
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:09,601
lf l had any money to spare, l should build one myself.

674
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:23,784
Mr. Willoughby ...

675
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:27,619
- How do you do, Miss Dashwood? - Very well.

676
01:17:27,915 --> 01:17:31,111
- How is your family? - We are all extremely well.

677
01:17:34,155 --> 01:17:36,293
Thank you for your kind inquiry.

678
01:17:39,115 --> 01:17:41,253
Willoughby!

679
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:54,921
Good God, Willoughby ...

680
01:17:56,682 --> 01:17:58,820
Will you not shake hands with me?

681
01:18:00,394 --> 01:18:02,499
How do you do, Miss Marianne?

682
01:18:05,706 --> 01:18:10,310
What is the matter? Why have you not come to see me?

683
01:18:11,497 --> 01:18:15,009
Were you not in London? Have you not received my letters?

684
01:18:15,306 --> 01:18:19,844
l had the pleasure of receiving the information you sent to me.

685
01:18:21,961 --> 01:18:26,238
For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell me what is wrong.

686
01:18:28,617 --> 01:18:30,689
Thank you. l am most obliged.

687
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:35,877
Excuse me, I must rejoin my party.

688
01:18:55,976 --> 01:18:59,292
Go to him. Force him to come to me instantly.

689
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:04,383
You must come away.

690
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:11,389
- Do you know them? - Acquaintances from the country.

691
01:19:19,623 --> 01:19:21,924
Come away, dearest.

692
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:34,848
l do not understand. l must speak to him ...

693
01:19:35,142 --> 01:19:40,640
My goodness. Come, dear. You need some air.

694
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:55,265
Lucy! We must go.

695
01:19:55,557 --> 01:20:00,477
lt would be our pleasure to escort your young charge home.

696
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:02,627
How kind.

697
01:20:03,877 --> 01:20:09,146
She actually sent him messages during the night?

698
01:20:19,012 --> 01:20:23,354
- Marianne, please tell me. - Do not ask me questions.

699
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:29,881
- You have no confidence in me. - You confide in no one.

700
01:20:31,844 --> 01:20:36,961
- l have nothing to tell. - We neither of us do.

701
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:40,994
l, because l conceal nothing. You, because you communicate nothing.

702
01:20:48,451 --> 01:20:53,666
Lady Charteris ought to limit her invitation list. lt was very warm.

703
01:20:53,956 --> 01:20:56,672
l am glad we left early.

704
01:20:57,891 --> 01:21:01,186
There now ...

705
01:21:04,355 --> 01:21:10,334
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal. That letter will do the trick.

706
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:17,019
l must be off. l do hope he doesn't keep her waiting much longer.

707
01:21:17,282 --> 01:21:20,183
lt hurts to see her this way.

708
01:21:22,338 --> 01:21:25,753
What a welcome l had from Edward's family.

709
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:32,127
You never said how agreeable your sister-in-law is. Robert, also.

710
01:21:32,417 --> 01:21:37,566
It is fortunate that none of them knows of your engagement.

711
01:21:46,113 --> 01:21:52,855
''Dear Madam. l am at a loss to see how l might have offended you.''

712
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:58,521
''lf l have given rise to a belief of more than l meant to express, -

713
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:02,492
- l regret not having been more guarded.''

714
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,402
''My affections are engaged elsewhere.''

715
01:22:05,697 --> 01:22:10,966
''lt is with regret that l return your letters and the lock of hair.''

716
01:22:11,264 --> 01:22:15,355
''l am, et cetera, John Willoughby.''

717
01:22:18,048 --> 01:22:20,568
Dearest ...

718
01:22:22,752 --> 01:22:30,105
lt is better than if your engagement had carried on before he ended it.

719
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,985
We're not engaged.

720
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,884
l thought he left you with some kind of understanding.

721
01:22:38,175 --> 01:22:44,666
- He's not so unworthy as you think. - Did he tell you that he loved you?

722
01:22:44,991 --> 01:22:51,635
Yes. No ... Never absolutely. lt was implied but never declared.

723
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:59,132
Sometimes l thought it had been, but it never was. He broke no vow.

724
01:22:59,422 --> 01:23:02,837
He made us all believe he loved you.

725
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:08,664
He did! He loved me as l loved him.

726
01:23:11,645 --> 01:23:16,183
l had to come straight up. How are you, Miss Marianne?

727
01:23:16,478 --> 01:23:21,114
Poor thing, she looks very bad. No wonder. for it is but too true.

728
01:23:21,437 --> 01:23:24,600
l was told by Miss Morton, -

729
01:23:24,893 --> 01:23:29,115
- that he is soon to marry a Miss Grey with 50,000!

730
01:23:29,405 --> 01:23:35,699
lf true, he is a good-for-nothing who used my young friend ill.

731
01:23:35,997 --> 01:23:40,186
And l wish with all my soul that his wife might plague all his heart out.

732
01:23:41,756 --> 01:23:45,847
He's not the only young man worth having.

733
01:23:46,108 --> 01:23:50,166
With your pretty face you'll never want for admirers.

734
01:23:53,052 --> 01:23:57,873
Better let her have her cry out and have done with it.

735
01:23:58,172 --> 01:24:02,427
l will go look out something to tempt her.

736
01:24:02,684 --> 01:24:07,735
- Does she care for olives? - l cannot tell you.

737
01:24:15,036 --> 01:24:17,719
Apparently, they never were engaged.

738
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:22,069
Miss Grey has 50,000. Marianne is virtually penniless.

739
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:27,151
She couldn't expect him to go through with it. But l feel for her.

740
01:24:27,387 --> 01:24:30,201
She will lose her bloom and end a spinster like Elinor.

741
01:24:32,411 --> 01:24:38,291
We might have them to stay for a few days. We are, after all, family.

742
01:24:38,619 --> 01:24:41,106
- And my father ... - My love ...

743
01:24:41,403 --> 01:24:46,640
l would ask them with all my heart, but l've already asked Miss Steele.

744
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:50,864
And we cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings of all her company.

745
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:54,064
We can invite your sisters some other year.

746
01:24:54,362 --> 01:24:59,315
Miss Steele will profit more from your generosity, poor girl.

747
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:02,391
Excellent notion.

748
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:08,371
Colonel Brandon to see you.

749
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:16,450
- Thank you so much for coming. - How is your sister?

750
01:25:11,578 --> 01:25:16,182


751
01:25:16,473 --> 01:25:23,575
l must get her home. Palmer can take us to Cleveland, a day from Barton.

752
01:25:23,864 --> 01:25:30,639
- l'll take you to Barton myself. - l confess, that is what l hoped.

753
01:25:31,608 --> 01:25:34,771
Marianne suffers cruelly.

754
01:25:35,065 --> 01:25:41,775
What pains me most is how hard she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.

755
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,501
Perhaps ...

756
01:25:49,879 --> 01:25:55,595
May l relate some circumstances which only a desire to be useful ...

757
01:25:55,895 --> 01:25:59,473
You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby?

758
01:26:09,078 --> 01:26:12,143
When l quitted Barton last ...

759
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:15,089
No, l must go further back.

760
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:20,244
No doubt ... No doubt ...

761
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:24,620
... Mrs. Jennings has appraised you of certain events in my past.

762
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:29,554
The sad outcome of my connection with a young woman named Eliza.

763
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:37,521
What is not commonly known -

764
01:26:37,846 --> 01:26:43,377
- is that 20 years ago, before she died. Eliza bore a child.

765
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:47,695
The father. whoever he was. abandoned them.

766
01:26:47,989 --> 01:26:53,705
As Eliza lay dying, she begged me to look after the child.

767
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:59,089
l had failed her in ever other way, l could not refuse her now.

768
01:26:59,413 --> 01:27:04,366
l placed the child, Beth, with a family in the country -

769
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:08,851
- where l knew she would be looked after. l saw her whenever l could.

770
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:13,101
She grew up so headstrong, -

771
01:27:13,396 --> 01:27:19,276
- and, God forgive me, l allowed her too much freedom.

772
01:27:19,572 --> 01:27:22,735
Almost a year ago she disappeared.

773
01:27:23,028 --> 01:27:28,145
l instigated a search, but for eight months l imagined the worst.

774
01:27:28,436 --> 01:27:33,072
On the day of the Delaford picnic, l received the first news of her.

775
01:27:34,548 --> 01:27:37,679
She was ... with child.

776
01:27:38,804 --> 01:27:44,270
And the blackguard who had left her with no hint of his whereabouts ...

777
01:27:49,203 --> 01:27:51,853
Do you mean Willoughby?

778
01:27:55,955 --> 01:28:01,551
Before l could confront him. Lady Allen had turned him out.

779
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:06,217
- He fled to London. - He left without any explanation.

780
01:28:06,514 --> 01:28:13,485
He risked losing the estate, and the money that remained to his debtors.

781
01:28:14,738 --> 01:28:17,771
So he abandoned Marianne -

782
01:28:18,065 --> 01:28:21,993
- for Miss Grey and her 50.000.

783
01:28:24,722 --> 01:28:27,110
ls Beth still in town?

784
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:31,882
She has chosen to go to the country for her confinement.

785
01:28:38,705 --> 01:28:42,796
l would not burden you, had l not, from my heart, -

786
01:28:43,089 --> 01:28:48,522
- believed it might, in time, lessen your sister's regrets.

787
01:28:58,096 --> 01:29:03,365
l have described Mr. Willoughby as the worst of libertines.

788
01:29:03,664 --> 01:29:08,398
But l learned from Lady Allen that he did mean to propose that day.

789
01:29:09,648 --> 01:29:16,969
l cannot deny that his intentions towards Marianne were honourable.

790
01:29:18,928 --> 01:29:22,702
l feel certain that he would have married her.

791
01:29:23,951 --> 01:29:27,879
- Had it not been ... - For the money.

792
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:37,705
- Was l right to tell you? - Of course.

793
01:29:40,655 --> 01:29:45,095
Whatever his past actions, whatever his present course, -

794
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:49,101
- you may be certain that he loved you.

795
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:52,553
But not enough.

796
01:29:53,551 --> 01:29:55,438
Not enough ...

797
01:30:03,054 --> 01:30:06,501
Here is someone to cheer you up.

798
01:30:10,637 --> 01:30:16,387
How is your dear sister? Poor thing.

799
01:30:16,686 --> 01:30:21,507
l do not know what I'd do if a man treated me with so little respect.

800
01:30:21,805 --> 01:30:24,804
Are you enjoying your stay with John and Fanny?

801
01:30:25,101 --> 01:30:30,817
l was never so happy in my life. Your sister-in-law has taken to me.

802
01:30:31,117 --> 01:30:35,753
- You cannot imagine what happened. - No. l cannot.

803
01:30:36,108 --> 01:30:43,079
Yesterday l was introduced to his mother. She was more than civil.

804
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:47,747
l have not yet seen Edward, but l feel sure to, very soon.

805
01:30:51,852 --> 01:30:55,780
There is a Mr. Edward Ferrars to see you.

806
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:03,010
Do ask him to come in.

807
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:41,251
What a pleasure to see you. You know Miss Steele. of course.

808
01:31:47,242 --> 01:31:52,937
- How do you do, Miss Steele? - l am well, thank you.

809
01:31:55,722 --> 01:31:58,885
Do sit down.

810
01:32:03,785 --> 01:32:09,251
Are you surprised to find me here and not at your sister's house?

811
01:32:11,241 --> 01:32:15,877
Let me fetch Marianne. She would be disappointed to miss you.

812
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,627
Edward! l heard your voice.

813
01:32:19,913 --> 01:32:26,819
- At last you found us. - My visit is shamefully overdue.

814
01:32:27,049 --> 01:32:33,343
- You're pale. Are you not well? - Don't think of me. Elinor is well.

815
01:32:33,672 --> 01:32:38,406
- That is enough for both of us. - How do you enjoy London?

816
01:32:39,656 --> 01:32:45,798
The sight of you is all the pleasure it has afforded. ls that not so?

817
01:32:47,879 --> 01:32:52,515
- Why have you not visited before? - l have been engaged elsewhere.

818
01:32:52,839 --> 01:32:57,595
But what was that when there were such friends to be met?

819
01:32:57,864 --> 01:33:02,206
Perhaps you think young men never honour their engagements?

820
01:33:02,503 --> 01:33:07,324
Edward is the most incapable of being selfish of anyone l ever saw.

821
01:33:10,215 --> 01:33:16,259
Edward, will you not sit? Help me to persuade him.

822
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:28,195
- Forgive me. l must take my leave. - You are only just arrived.

823
01:33:28,454 --> 01:33:31,268
l've an urgent commission for Fanny.

824
01:33:32,518 --> 01:33:36,347
Perhaps you might escort me back to your sister's house.

825
01:33:39,461 --> 01:33:42,428
lt would be an honour.

826
01:34:00,965 --> 01:34:06,813
- Why did you not urge him to stay? - He must have had his reasons.

827
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:13,370
Yes, your coldness. Were l Edward, l'd assume you didn't care for me.

828
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:23,514
Marianne looked badly. lt makes me fear that l shall never marry.

829
01:34:23,811 --> 01:34:27,106
Nonsense. You will marry far better than the Dashwood girls.

830
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,743
But l have no dowry.

831
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:37,336
There are other important qualities that you have in abundance.

832
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:42,077
lt would not surprise me if you married beyond your expectations.

833
01:34:42,371 --> 01:34:45,786
Oh, l wish that might be so.

834
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:50,940
There is a young man ...

835
01:34:51,235 --> 01:34:54,911
ls he of good fortune and breeding?

836
01:34:55,235 --> 01:35:01,726
Of both. But his family would certainly oppose the match.

837
01:35:02,051 --> 01:35:05,346
They will allow it as soon as they see you.

838
01:35:05,602 --> 01:35:08,318
lt is a very great secret.

839
01:35:08,642 --> 01:35:12,253
l've told nobody in the world for fear of discovery.

840
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:19,485
- l am the soul of discretion. - lf l dared tell ...

841
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:26,490
l can assure you, l am as silent as the grave.

842
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:36,124
Viper in my bosom!

843
01:35:39,521 --> 01:35:42,139
Stop this!

844
01:35:57,216 --> 01:36:04,373
What a commotion! Edward Ferrars. the one l used to joke you about, -

845
01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:08,217
- is engaged these five years to Lucy Steele.

846
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:16,596
His mother has demanded he break the engagement or suffer disinheritance.

847
01:36:16,895 --> 01:36:21,880
But he refuses to break his promise. He has stood by her, -

848
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:26,877
- and is cut off without a penny. She settled it all on Mr. Robert.

849
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:34,388
l must find Lucy. Your sister-in-law drove her to hysteria.

850
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:38,971
How long have you known?

851
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:47,224
- Since Mrs. Jennings invited us. - Why did you not tell me?

852
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:50,550
Lucy told me in confidence.

853
01:36:51,743 --> 01:36:54,393
- l could not break my word. - He loves you!

854
01:36:54,686 --> 01:36:59,770
- He tried to tell me about Lucy. - He cannot marry her.

855
01:37:00,062 --> 01:37:05,495
Should he treat her worse than Willoughby treated you?

856
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:11,735
- He can't marry without love. - He promised a long time ago.

857
01:37:12,029 --> 01:37:18,935
He may harbour some regret, but he he will be happy he kept his word.

858
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:23,288
lt is bewitching to think one's happiness depends on one person, -

859
01:37:29,373 --> 01:37:33,169
- but it is not always possible. We must accept.

860
01:37:33,436 --> 01:37:38,585
Edward will marry Lucy, and you and l will go home.

861
01:37:38,877 --> 01:37:41,560
Always resignation and acceptance.

862
01:37:41,884 --> 01:37:45,331
Always prudence and honour and duty.

863
01:37:45,564 --> 01:37:48,979
Elinor, where is your heart?

864
01:37:50,236 --> 01:37:54,229
What do you know of my heart, or anything but your own suffering?

865
01:37:54,555 --> 01:37:59,344
For weeks this has been pressed on me, when l could not speak of it.

866
01:37:59,644 --> 01:38:05,655
Forced on me by the person whose prior claims ruined all my hopes.

867
01:38:05,979 --> 01:38:11,859
l endured her exaltation, knowing l was divided from Edward forever.

868
01:38:12,123 --> 01:38:15,897
lf not bound to silence. l'd have produced proof of a broken heart.

869
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:50,070
l have heard your Mr. Ferrars has lost his fortune to his brother.

870
01:38:50,362 --> 01:38:55,577
- Have l been rightly informed? - lt is indeed so.

871
01:38:55,866 --> 01:39:01,561
- Are you acquainted with him? - No. we have never met.

872
01:39:03,514 --> 01:39:07,823
But l know only too well the cruelty ...

873
01:39:08,153 --> 01:39:14,317
... of dividing two young people long attached to one another.

874
01:39:16,664 --> 01:39:22,414
l have a proposal that may allow him to marry Miss Steele immediately.

875
01:39:22,713 --> 01:39:28,244
As he is a friend to your family, perhaps you'd mention it to him.

876
01:39:29,496 --> 01:39:35,857
l'm sure he'd be delighted to hear it from your own lips.

877
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:40,276
l think not.

878
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:46,578
His behaviour has proved him proud. ln the best sense.

879
01:39:48,247 --> 01:39:51,891
l feel certain this is the right course.

880
01:39:57,399 --> 01:40:00,115
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

881
01:40:09,814 --> 01:40:12,683
Thank you for responding so quickly.

882
01:40:12,983 --> 01:40:16,278
l was grateful to receive your message.

883
01:40:16,567 --> 01:40:19,283
God knows what you must think of me.

884
01:40:19,606 --> 01:40:24,821
- l have no right to speak ... - l have good news.

885
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:26,964
Do please sit down.

886
01:40:32,726 --> 01:40:37,875
- You know of Col. Brandon. - l've heard his name.

887
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:43,980
Col. Brandon desires me to say, as you wish to join the clergy, -

888
01:40:44,277 --> 01:40:49,295
- that he has pleasure in offering you the parish at Delaford, -

889
01:40:49,589 --> 01:40:54,095
- in the hope it may enable you and Miss Steele to marry.

890
01:40:55,636 --> 01:40:58,931
- Col. Brandon? - Yes.

891
01:40:59,157 --> 01:41:05,005
He means it as testimony of his concern for this cruel situation.

892
01:41:07,316 --> 01:41:10,731
Col. Brandon give me a parish?

893
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:14,672
Can it be possible?

894
01:41:14,964 --> 01:41:20,680
You shouldn't be astonished to find friendship outside your family.

895
01:41:22,196 --> 01:41:27,280
No. Not to find it in you.

896
01:41:27,604 --> 01:41:32,142
l cannot be ignorant that it is certainly to you that l owe this.

897
01:41:32,404 --> 01:41:36,298
l'd express it if l could, but l am no orator ...

898
01:41:36,563 --> 01:41:42,508
You are mistaken. You owe it to your own merit.

899
01:41:46,643 --> 01:41:50,537
Col. Brandon must be a man of great worth.

900
01:41:50,835 --> 01:41:54,763
He is the kindest and best of men.

901
01:41:57,299 --> 01:42:02,383
May l ask why the colonel did not tell me himself?

902
01:42:02,642 --> 01:42:06,416
l think he felt it would be better coming from a friend.

903
01:42:12,402 --> 01:42:16,744
Your friendship has been the most important in my life.

904
01:42:20,785 --> 01:42:23,632
You will always have it.

905
01:42:27,026 --> 01:42:30,025
Forgive me.

906
01:42:31,249 --> 01:42:36,202
You honour your promises. That is more important than anything else.

907
01:42:36,497 --> 01:42:40,686
l wish you both happiness.

908
01:43:18,831 --> 01:43:22,759
What luck for them to find a parish so close to Barton.

909
01:43:23,056 --> 01:43:26,950
You'll all be able to meet very often.

910
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:31,883
l've never disliked a person so much as l do Mr. Willoughby.

911
01:43:32,175 --> 01:43:39,212
We can see his house from the hill! l'll ask Jackson to plant trees.

912
01:43:39,438 --> 01:43:41,859
You won't.

913
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:47,209
l hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was everything of the finest ...

914
01:43:57,646 --> 01:44:03,362
Mrs. Bunting! We're in desperate need of tea.

915
01:44:10,765 --> 01:44:15,554
She's not drawn breath since London. Had l only found another way home.

916
01:44:15,854 --> 01:44:21,702
There was no other way. l'll just take a stroll. A moment's peace.

917
01:44:22,029 --> 01:44:26,600
- l think it is going to rain. - No. it will not rain.

918
01:44:26,893 --> 01:44:33,286
- When you say so, it always does. - l shall keep to the garden.

919
01:44:51,275 --> 01:44:56,839
We are very proud of our Thomas. His papa has such a way with him.

920
01:45:10,283 --> 01:45:16,327
Oh, there you are. Come and meet little Thomas.

921
01:45:31,754 --> 01:45:34,787
l cannot see Marianne.

922
01:46:12,009 --> 01:46:18,370
Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds. -

923
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:23,040
- or bends with the remover to remove.

924
01:46:23,336 --> 01:46:28,638
Oh. no. 'tis an ever fixed mark -

925
01:46:28,968 --> 01:46:33,823
- that looks on tempests and is never shaken.

926
01:46:34,696 --> 01:46:37,663
Willoughby ...

927
01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:42,845
Willoughby ...

928
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:44,965
Willoughby ...

929
01:46:49,895 --> 01:46:51,520
Marianne?

930
01:46:51,815 --> 01:46:58,012
- She'll be wet through. - Thank you for pointing that out.

931
01:46:58,311 --> 01:47:02,107
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood. Brandon will find her.

932
01:47:02,407 --> 01:47:05,755
We can all guess where she went.

933
01:47:34,373 --> 01:47:38,595
She's not hurt. but we must get her warm.

934
01:47:39,653 --> 01:47:43,547
There is a fire lit in my room. Do hurry!

935
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:14,045
l think Marianne may need a doctor.

936
01:48:32,451 --> 01:48:39,073
You'll wear yourself out. A day or two in bed will set her to rights.

937
01:48:39,363 --> 01:48:43,999
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. l've never found a better physician.

938
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:52,572
- What is the diagnosis? - lt is an infectious fever.

939
01:48:52,867 --> 01:48:58,682
- l recommend removing your child. - Mrs. Bunting!

940
01:49:06,562 --> 01:49:11,711
Miss Dashwood ... l am more sorry than l can say.

941
01:49:12,002 --> 01:49:17,915
- lf you prefer me to stay l shall. - That is very kind.

942
01:49:18,242 --> 01:49:21,820
But Col. Brandon and Dr. Harris will look after us.

943
01:49:22,113 --> 01:49:25,309
Thank you for all you have done.

944
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:55,992
She's not doing as well as l would like.

945
01:50:09,695 --> 01:50:12,694
What can l do?

946
01:50:14,207 --> 01:50:20,218
- You've done so much already. - Anything, or l shall run mad.

947
01:50:20,543 --> 01:50:24,437
She would be easier if her mother were here.

948
01:51:07,422 --> 01:51:09,942
l must fetch more laudanum.

949
01:51:10,237 --> 01:51:15,899
l cannot pretend that your sister's condition is not very serious.

950
01:51:21,085 --> 01:51:23,540
You must prepare yourself.

951
01:51:24,508 --> 01:51:28,020
l will return shortly.

952
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:46,134
Marianne ...

953
01:51:46,428 --> 01:51:49,210
Marianne, please try ...

954
01:51:51,612 --> 01:51:54,394
Marianne ...

955
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:59,864
Please try ...

956
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:15,348
l cannot ... l cannot do without you.

957
01:52:23,034 --> 01:52:29,045
l've tried to bear everything else. l will try ...

958
01:52:29,338 --> 01:52:32,949
But please, dearest ...

959
01:52:37,178 --> 01:52:39,544
... beloved Marianne ...

960
01:52:43,577 --> 01:52:46,642
... do not leave me alone.

961
01:53:39,448 --> 01:53:41,717
Elinor ...

962
01:54:06,775 --> 01:54:09,327
My mother ...

963
01:54:17,462 --> 01:54:21,651
She is out of danger. She is out of danger.

964
01:54:34,005 --> 01:54:37,201
- Where is Elinor? - l'm here.

965
01:54:37,525 --> 01:54:40,241
Dearest. l am here.

966
01:54:44,501 --> 01:54:47,370
Col. Brandon ...

967
01:54:54,325 --> 01:54:57,041
Thank you.

968
01:55:36,115 --> 01:55:41,963
He's not so dashing as Willoughby, but he has a pleasing countenance.

969
01:55:43,219 --> 01:55:50,158
There was something in Willoughby's eyes at times that l did not like.

970
01:55:53,042 --> 01:55:56,718
''Nor is the earth the lesse. or loseth aught.''

971
01:55:57,074 --> 01:56:04,297
''What from one place doth fall is with the tide to another brought.''

972
01:56:05,234 --> 01:56:09,838
''For there is nothing lost but may be found ...

973
01:56:11,218 --> 01:56:14,000
... if sought.''

974
01:56:18,194 --> 01:56:23,015
- Shall we continue tomorrow? - No, for l must away.

975
01:56:23,313 --> 01:56:29,193
- Away? Where? - That l cannot tell you.

976
01:56:29,424 --> 01:56:32,587
lt is a secret.

977
01:56:35,088 --> 01:56:37,095
You will not stay away long?

978
01:56:54,735 --> 01:56:57,451
There.

979
01:56:58,512 --> 01:57:02,440
There l fell. and there l first saw Willoughby.

980
01:57:04,399 --> 01:57:08,773
Poor Willoughby. He will always regret you.

981
01:57:09,072 --> 01:57:14,287
Does it follow that. had he chosen me. he would have been content?

982
01:57:14,575 --> 01:57:19,015
He would have had a wife he loved. but no money, -

983
01:57:19,311 --> 01:57:24,907
- and might have learned to rank his pocketbook above his heart.

984
01:57:28,623 --> 01:57:32,517
lf his regrets are half as painful as mine, he will suffer enough.

985
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:39,078
Do you compare your conduct with his?

986
01:57:39,374 --> 01:57:46,116
l compare it to what it ought to have been. With yours.

987
01:57:58,478 --> 01:58:01,641
l fetched those beef fillets. ma'am.

988
01:58:01,933 --> 01:58:07,715
Beef is less expensive in Exeter. Anyway, it's for Marianne.

989
01:58:08,013 --> 01:58:12,136
- Was Exeter crowded? - lt was. ma'am.

990
01:58:12,429 --> 01:58:15,428
Miss Pothington has had another stroke.

991
01:58:17,810 --> 01:58:21,810
And Miss Murden has turned away Coles for his drunkenness.

992
01:58:21,677 --> 01:58:27,044
And Mr. Ferrars is married. but of course you know that.

993
01:58:30,156 --> 01:58:33,003
Who told you he was married?

994
01:58:33,292 --> 01:58:40,580
l saw Mrs. Ferrars myself. She and Mr. Ferrars stopped at the inn.

995
01:58:40,843 --> 01:58:45,098
l saw it was Miss Steele. so l took off my hat.

996
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:49,991
She inquired after all of you, especially Miss Dashwood.

997
01:58:50,283 --> 01:58:57,058
She bade me give their compliments. They're sending a piece of the cake.

998
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:04,202
- Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well? - She said she was vastly contented.

999
01:59:04,491 --> 01:59:09,379
As she was always an affable lady, l made free to wish herjoy.

1000
01:59:09,642 --> 01:59:13,089
Thank you, Thomas.

1001
01:59:42,889 --> 01:59:46,533
- What is it. Thomas? - I'm not sure, but it's heavy.

1002
01:59:47,753 --> 01:59:52,902
''lt is small enough for the parlour. When l follow shortly, l expect -

1003
01:59:53,193 --> 01:59:58,527
- that you've learnt the enclosed. Your friend, Christopher Brandon.''

1004
01:59:58,857 --> 02:00:01,704
lt fits perfectly.

1005
02:00:02,761 --> 02:00:04,800
Here you are, Miss Marianne.

1006
02:00:04,905 --> 02:00:07,293
Fetch some tea.

1007
02:00:08,552 --> 02:00:14,694
- He must like you very much. - lt's for all of us.

1008
02:01:00,423 --> 02:01:03,619
Here is Col. Brandon.

1009
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:19,139
- l do not think it is the coloneI. - He said he would arrive today.

1010
02:01:20,549 --> 02:01:23,036
Edward!

1011
02:01:23,333 --> 02:01:25,951
lt is Edward!

1012
02:01:28,197 --> 02:01:31,841
Calm. We must be calm.

1013
02:01:51,909 --> 02:01:55,072
Mr. Ferrars for you, ma'am.

1014
02:01:58,404 --> 02:02:02,332
Edward ... What a pleasure to see you.

1015
02:02:19,171 --> 02:02:25,248
- l trust l find you all well? - Thank you. We are all very well.

1016
02:02:30,051 --> 02:02:34,807
We've been enjoying fine weather ... Well. we have .

1017
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:41,723
l'm glad to hear it. The roads were very dry.

1018
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:49,337
l wish you great joy, Edward.

1019
02:03:07,713 --> 02:03:11,291
l hope you have left Mrs. Ferrars well.

1020
02:03:13,377 --> 02:03:16,672
Tolerably ... Thank you.

1021
02:03:21,089 --> 02:03:23,707
ls Mrs. Ferrars at the new parish?

1022
02:03:25,121 --> 02:03:29,398
No ... my mother is in town.

1023
02:03:29,696 --> 02:03:32,695
l meant Mrs. Edward Ferrars.

1024
02:03:36,210 --> 02:03:40,130
You've not heard?

1025
02:03:42,304 --> 02:03:47,573
l think you mean my brother. Mrs. Robert Ferrars.

1026
02:03:47,904 --> 02:03:52,889
- Mrs. Robert Ferrars? - Yes.

1027
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:59,880
l received a letter from Miss Steele. -

1028
02:04:00,736 --> 02:04:06,747
- or Mrs. Ferrars, l should say, communicating to me -

1029
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:11,577
- the transfer of her affections to my brother Robert.

1030
02:04:11,903 --> 02:04:16,092
lt seems they were much thrown together in London.

1031
02:04:16,351 --> 02:04:22,744
ln view of my new circumstances l felt it only right -

1032
02:04:23,038 --> 02:04:27,194
- that she be released from our engagement.

1033
02:04:27,486 --> 02:04:32,090
At any rate, they were married last week in Plymouth.

1034
02:04:37,022 --> 02:04:38,876
Then you ...

1035
02:04:41,981 --> 02:04:44,152
... are not married?

1036
02:04:44,254 --> 02:04:46,108
No.

1037
02:05:14,045 --> 02:05:19,609
Elinor ... l met Lucy when l was very young.

1038
02:05:19,965 --> 02:05:26,107
Had l had a profession, l would not have felt such an idle inclination.

1039
02:05:26,364 --> 02:05:32,855
At Norland, l convinced myself that you felt only friendship for me, -

1040
02:05:33,115 --> 02:05:36,497
- and that it was my heart alone that l was risking.

1041
02:05:36,828 --> 02:05:44,563
l have come with no expectations, only to express, now I am able, -

1042
02:05:44,891 --> 02:05:51,862
- that my heart is, and always will be ...

1043
02:05:52,123 --> 02:05:54,261
... yours.

1044
02:06:08,698 --> 02:06:13,782
- He's sitting next to her. - What else?

1045
02:06:14,106 --> 02:06:15,960
Tell us!

1046
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:19,064
He's kneeling down!

1047
02:06:19,064 --> 02:06:19,064


1048
02:06:19,064 --> 02:06:19,064


1049
02:06:19,064 --> 02:06:19,064
