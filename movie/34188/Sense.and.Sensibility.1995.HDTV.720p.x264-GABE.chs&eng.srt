1
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:55,169
奥斯卡(美国电影学院奖)  1996
最佳改编剧本

2
00:00:55,648 --> 00:01:00,449
理智与情感

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,118
你儿子从伦敦回来了
Your son is arrived from London.

4
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,836
-爸... -约翰...
- Father ... - John ...

5
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:22,695
我在遗嘱有交代... 我当初继承诺兰庄园的条件是...
You will see in my will the estate of Norland was left to me in a way -

6
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:28,552
我们两家不能分祖产
- that prevents me from dividing it between my two families.

7
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:36,610
因此...诺兰现在依法归你所有
Norland, in its entirety, is therefore yours by law.

8
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:41,991
我为你和芬妮感到高兴
And l am happy for you and Fanny.

9
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:50,915
但你继母...我的太太和你姐妹们 每年祗得5百英镑
But your stepmother, my wife and daughters are left only 500 a year.

10
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:55,369
仅能糊口 你的姐妹们的嫁妆都没有着落
Barely enough to live on. Nothing for the girls' dowries.

11
00:01:57,163 --> 00:02:02,530
-你一定要帮助她们 -这当然
- You must help them. - Of course.

12
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,706
你一定要向我保证
You must promise to do this.

13
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:12,234
我保证，父亲 我保证
l promise, Father. l promise.

14
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:15,814
帮她们？什么意思？
Help them? What do you mean?

15
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:22,817
我想要给她们3千英镑 所赚得的利息钱也不无小补
l mean to give them 3,000. The interest will be an extra income.

16
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:29,923
-这份礼物就算我履行承诺 -当然，这就够多了
- The gift will fulfil my promise. - Without question. More than amply.

17
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,562
这种事情，宁可要大方一点
One had rather. on such occasions. do too much than too little.

18
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:40,551
当然，爸又没有指定要给多少
Of course, he did not stipulate a particular sum.

19
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:45,637
那你觉得1千5百英镑如何？
What do you say to 1,500, then?

20
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:50,918
别人对亲妹妹都没这么好 更何况是同父异母
What brother would be so kind to his real sisters. let alone half-blood?

21
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:56,960
-她们不能奢望太多 -问题是你能给多少？
- They can hardly expect more. - What can you afford?

22
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:06,626
每年给继母100英镑 总比一次拿1千5百英镑好
100 a year to their mother is better than losing 1,500 at once.

23
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:12,640
她若再活15年以上 那我们岂不是亏大了
Should she live longer than 15 years we'd be completely taken in.

24
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,674
人一有年金可拿就会比较长寿
People live forever when an annuity is to be paid them.

25
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:23,658
偶尔给个20英镑也就行了 你说得对
20 now and then will amply discharge my promise, you're right.

26
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:29,283
我相信你父亲 也没指望你拿钱给她们
l'm convinced that your father had no idea of giving them money.

27
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,764
-反正她们一年会得到5百英镑 -她们还奢求什么？
- They will have 500 a year. - What more could they want for?

28
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:40,584
她们根本没开销，既没有马 也没几个仆人，又不交朋友...
No housekeeping, carriage, horses, few servants, keeping no company ...

29
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:42,850
这样的日子算是很富裕了
How comfortable!

30
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:47,524
她们说不定还有余力给你钱
They will be much more able to give you something.

31
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:11,622
玛丽安，你可否弹别首曲子？
Marianne. can you play something else?

32
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:15,528
妈从一早哭到现在
Mamma has been weeping since breakfast.

33
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,015
我是指比较不悲伤的曲子
l meant something less mournful.

34
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:34,092
竟然叫我们反客为主！ 我咽不下这口气，爱琳娜
A visitor in my own home! lt is not to be borne. Elinor.

35
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,612
-妈，我们无处可去 -约翰和芬妮马上就到了
- Mamma, we have nowhere to go. - John and Fanny will be here soon.

36
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:46,124
别想叫我满脸笑容的欢迎他们 贪得无厌！
Do you expect me to be here to welcome them? Vultures!

37
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,347
我马上开始找房子
l will start making inquiries for a new house at once.

38
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:06,980
在此之前，我们必须要忍耐一下
Until then, we must try to bear their coming.

39
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:14,632
玛格丽特，你在上面吗？快下来 约翰和芬妮马上就到了
Margaret, are you there? Come down, John and Fanny will be here soon.

40
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:21,162
他们为什么非得来诺兰住？ 他们在伦敦有房子
Why are they to live at Norland? They have a house in London.

41
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:27,684
因为房子是传子而非传女 这是法律的规定
Houses go from father to son, not father to daughter. lt is the law.

42
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:35,209
-走，我们去玩你的地图集 -不是我的，是他们的了
- Come, we'll play with your atlas. - lt's not mine. it's their atlas.

43
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:44,102
请坐
Do sit down.

44
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:52,582
我们在另找房子 搬家后，祗能雇用汤玛士和贝丝
We are looking for a new home, and can only retain Thomas and Betsy.

45
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,846
很遗憾我们得分手了
We're sorry to have to leave you all.

46
00:05:56,175 --> 00:06:02,055
不过我们相信新女主人， 戴太太会好好善待各位
But we are certain you will find the new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.

47
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:07,304
我祗关心她们何时才会搬走
My only real concern is how long it will take them to move out.

48
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:33,194
-费洛斯太太好吗？ -家母身体一向很好
- How is Mrs. Ferrars? - She is always in good health.

49
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,308
舍弟在伦敦陪她 他可是个万人迷
My brother is with her this season. Quite the most popular bachelor.

50
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:40,549
他有一辆敞蓬马车
He has his own barouche.

51
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:50,218
-你有两个弟弟吧？ -对，大的叫爱德华
- You have two brothers? - Yes. Edward is the elder.

52
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,504
他要从普利茅斯来这住几天
He's travelling up from Plymouth and will break his journey here.

53
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:03,972
-当然如果你们同意的话... -亲爱的约翰
- lf that is agreeable to you. - Dear John ...

54
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:07,533
现在这个家是你们的了
This is your home now.

55
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:16,198
-芬妮要餐具柜子的钥匙 -她要干嘛？
- Fanny wants the key to the silver. - What does Fanny want with it?

56
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:20,970
想必是要清点，你在干嘛？
One can presume she wants to count it. What are you doing?

57
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:27,723
给雇人的礼物，你有看到 玛格丽特吗？她到处躲
Gifts for the servants. Where is Margaret? She's taken to hiding.

58
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:34,377
-至少她可以躲开芬妮 -你也没跟她说半句话
- At least she can escape Fanny. - You've not said a word to her.

59
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:38,828
我有呀！ 我有说“是”和“不是”
l have. l've said yes and no.

60
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:53,964
早安，芬妮
Good morning, Fanny.

61
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:58,858
早安，玛丽安
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

62
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:02,284
餐具怎么样？都是纯银的吧？
How did you find the silver? Was it all genuine?

63
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:08,905
-令弟什么时候来？ -爱德华明天会到
- When may we expect your brother? - Edward is due tomorrow.

64
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:16,653
他不会待太久 玛格丽特的房间能否让给他？
He will not stay long. Will Margaret give up her room for him?

65
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:22,825
那房间的景致最美 我想让他瞧瞧诺兰之美
The view is incomparable, and l want him to see Norland at its best.

66
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:48,456
这位是戴太太 戴小姐，玛丽娜小姐
Mrs. Dashwood. Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.

67
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,853
舍弟爱德华费洛斯
My brother, Edward Ferrars.

68
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:54,541
请坐
Do sit down.

69
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:03,399
玛格丽特呢？ 我不禁开始怀疑她的存在了
Where is Miss Margaret? l'm beginning to doubt of her existence.

70
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:08,879
费先生，请您原谅 么女最近很怕生人
Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My youngest is shy of strangers at present.

71
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:16,358
我自己也怕生人 却不像她有个好理由
l am shy of strangers myself, and l have nothing like her excuse.

72
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:19,211
还喜欢窗户外的景致吗？ 费先生
How do you like your view, Mr. Ferrars?

73
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:27,304
很喜欢，你们的马厩很漂亮 打理得很好
Very much. Your stables are handsome and beautifully kept.

74
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:30,863
马厩？你窗外应该是一池湖水
Stables? Your windows overlook the lake.

75
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:37,100
我原本被带到主人房间 我发现错误之后
An error led me to a family room, but l've rectified the situation.

76
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:41,671
便住在客房，那里很舒适
l am happily installed in the guest quarters.

77
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,133
喝茶吧！
Tea!

78
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:51,470
她们都被宠坏了 玛格丽特很爱爬树到处躲
They're all spoilt. Miss Margaret is always up trees and under furniture.

79
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:54,992
玛丽安也没对我说上半句好话
l've barely had a civil word from Marianne.

80
00:09:55,282 --> 00:10:01,577
她们的父亲刚过世 生活情况完全改观
They've just lost their father. Their lives will never be the same.

81
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,006
这不是藉口
That is no excuse.

82
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,226
书房
Library.

83
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:17,805
-这些大部份是外文书 -真是太棒了
- These are mostly foreign. - lndeed. Magnificent.

84
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:21,481
我讨厌书的味道
l've never liked the smell of books.

85
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:27,495
也许是灰尘的缘故吧 听说你胡桃园兴工
The dust, perhaps. l hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.

86
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:32,399
我要把把它铲平 盖一座希腊式神殿
l shall have it knocked down to make place for a Grecian temple.

87
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:37,676
听起来不错 你要不要带我参观一下？
That does sound interesting. Would you show me the site?

88
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:49,070
太贵了，况且我们不需要 4间卧房，可以合睡
Too expensive, and we do not need four bedrooms. We can share.

89
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,753
那这个好了
This one. then.

90
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,149
我们一年祗有500英镑
We have only 500 a year.

91
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,997
我今天再写信打听
l'll send out more inquiries today.

92
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:09,322
恕我打扰了，我想我已经... 找到你们所想要找的
Pardon my intrusion, but l think l have found what you're looking for.

93
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:21,742
你出来好不好 我们有一整天没见到你了
Won't you come out? We haven't seen you all day.

94
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:28,463
要加盖 雇人会告诉你时间的
We'll have to enlarge it. Mattocks will help you adjust to our hours.

95
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:39,502
对不起 你们有没有一本好的地图？
Forgive me, do you by any chance have a reliable atlas?

96
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:44,880
-应该有的 -我想查尼罗河的位置
- l believe so. - l must check the Nile's position.

97
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,782
我姐姐说是在南非
My sister tells me it is in South America.

98
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:54,859
不对！ 不，她搞错了
No! No, she's quite wrong.

99
00:11:56,052 --> 00:12:00,045
应该是在...比利时
l believe it is in Belgium.

100
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:03,440
不会吧？你讲的是窝瓦河
Surely not. You must be thinking of the Volga.

101
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:09,328
-窝瓦河的源头是在... -海参崴，流到...
- The Volga, which starts in ... - ln Vladivostok. and ends in ...

102
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:13,515
-温布登 -没错，那里产咖啡豆
- Wimbledon. - Yes. where coffee beans come from.

103
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:17,042
尼罗河的源头是在阿布西尼亚
The source of the Nile is in Abyssinia.

104
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:21,773
是吗？真有意思
ls it? lnteresting.

105
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:27,469
-幸会，爱德华费洛斯 -玛格丽特戴虚伍
- How do you do? Edward Ferrars. - Margaret Dashwood.

106
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:32,815
他家就在旁边 能买下来就太好了
lt adjoins this property, and would be a desirable addition.

107
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:37,965
-我会去找他谈谈...他姓什么？ -吉伯森
- l'll ride there and speak to ... - Gibson.

108
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:45,330
-他应该很乐意出售才对 -他一定会漫天喊价
- He'll be pleased enough to sell. - He'll want more than it is worth.

109
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:16,463
痛不痛？
Have l hurt you?

110
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:19,092
谢谢 对不起
Thank you. Forgive me.

111
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:23,124
这是父亲生前最喜爱的曲子
That was my father's favourite.

112
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:31,636
谢谢你关照玛格丽特 你来了之后，她好了很多
Thank you for helping Margaret. She's changed since you came.

113
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:34,797
我喜欢有她作陪
l enjoy her company.

114
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:38,956
-她有带你参观树屋吗？ 还没有
- Has she shown you the tree house? - Not yet.

115
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:44,493
你能否...带我去看，戴小姐？
Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood?

116
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:48,468
-今天天气很好 -我很乐意
- lt is very fine out. - With pleasure.

117
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:54,958
-玛格丽特很喜欢旅行 -我知道，她最近很想去中国旅行
- Margaret always wanted to travel. - l know. She's off to China soon.

118
00:14:55,287 --> 00:15:01,200
要我当她的仆人 当然她不会亏待我
l'm to go as her servant, on the understanding l'll be badly treated.

119
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:07,627
-你的工作会是什么？ -比剑和打扫
- What will your duties be? - Sword fighting and swabbing.

120
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,348
哪个优先？
Which will take precedence?

121
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:23,892
我祗求生活平静安逸
All l have ever wanted is the quiet of a private life.

122
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:29,233
但我母亲要我出人头地
But my mother is determined to see me distinguished.

123
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:36,018
演讲家，政治家，甚至律师也行 祗要我有豪华马车
Orator. Politician. Even a barrister would do. if l drove a barouche.

124
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:38,929
你的希望是什么呢？
What do you wish for?

125
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:43,925
我一直想当神职人员 但我妈认为不够光彩
l prefer the church, but that is not smart enough for my mother.

126
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:48,406
她喜欢我从军， 但这对我而言太光彩了
She prefers the army, but that is too smart for me.

127
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:52,241
-你会住在伦敦吗？ -我恨伦敦
- Would you stay in London? - l hate London.

128
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,618
我喜欢住在乡下 在小教区行善
Country living is my ideal. A small parish where l might do some good.

129
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,654
养养鸡...讲道而不废话
Keep chickens ... Give very short sermons.

130
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:10,257
你说你觉得游手好闲 一个人没有工作
You feel idle and useless. lmagine how that is compounded -

131
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,400
没有任何选择时那才难过呢！
- when one has no choice of any occupation whatsoever.

132
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,818
我们真是同病相怜
Our circumstances are therefore precisely the same.

133
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:25,682
但你将会继承巨额财产
Except that you will inherit your fortune.

134
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:29,395
我们连想赚点钱都不能
We cannot even earn ours.

135
00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:36,148
也许玛格丽特说得对 干脆去当海盗算了
Perhaps Margaret is right. Piracy is our only option.

136
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,914
拖地要怎么拖？
What is swabbing exactly?

137
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:46,648
“天不从人愿，风暴未歇 吉光未现”
''No voice divine the storm allayed. No light propitious shone.''

138
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:51,890
“奥援竭绝，我们逐一死去”
''When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone.''

139
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:57,235
“而我，更逢惊涛骇浪 即将葬身深海”
''But I, beneath a rougher sea, and whelmed in deeper gulfs than he ...''

140
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,350
不对，你听我念
No. Edward.

141
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:03,983
“天不从人愿，风暴未歇 吉光未现”
''No voice divine the storm allayed. No light propitious shone.''

142
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:08,307
“奥援竭绝，我们逐一死去”
''When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone.''

143
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:13,237
你能体会到他的绝望吗？ 再来一次
Can you not feel his despair? Try again.

144
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:24,208
“天不从人愿，风暴未歇 吉光未现”
''No voice divine the storm allayed. No light propitious shone.''

145
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:29,873
“奥援竭绝，我们逐一死去”
''When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone.''

146
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,000
妈...
Mamma ...

147
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,010
Mamma ...

148
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:41,234
你看，这是刚刚才收到的
Look. This has just arrived.

149
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:47,120
我很乐意 提供巴顿小屋给你们居住...
''l should be pleased to offer you a home at Barton Cottage, as soon ...''

150
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:51,542
-是约翰爵士寄来的 -爱琳娜一定不嫌贵的
- lt's from Sir John Middleton. - Even Elinor must approve the rent.

151
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,551
-她还没看过这信吗？ -我去告诉她
- Has she not yet seen this? - No. l will fetch her.

152
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:58,964
等等，晚点再告诉她
Wait, let us delay.

153
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:05,106
我相信 爱德华和爱琳娜互相喜欢
l believe that Edward and Elinor have formed an attachment.

154
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:09,941
我不忍叫她这么快走 迪凡郡太远了
lt would be cruel to take her away so soon. Devonshire is so far.

155
00:18:10,234 --> 00:18:15,601
-你觉得他不适合她？ -没有啊！
- Do you disapprove her choice? - By no means.

156
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,403
-爱德华很和善 -和善？可是呢
- Edward is very amiable. - Amiable? But ..?

157
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:25,848
可是总缺少了什么 他太严肃了，他读诗的样子...
There is something wanting. He is too sedate. His reading ...

158
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,302
爱琳娜不像你
Elinor has not your feelings.

159
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:35,573
他真的爱她吗？ 如此相敬如宾就能满足吗？
Can he love her? Can the soul be satisfied with polite affections?

160
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:40,437
爱一定要热情如火 就像是茱莉丽、亚瑟皇后一样
To love is to be on fire. Like Juliet. Guinevere. Heloise.

161
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,007
-结果都是悲剧收场 -悲惨？为爱而死？
- They made rather pathetic ends. - Pathetic? To die for love?

162
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:50,073
-有什么比这更荣耀？ -你的感情未免太丰富了
- What could be more glorious? - Your romantic sensibilities ...

163
00:18:57,563 --> 00:19:04,403
“爱情是梦幻还是感觉？ 不，它跟真理一样永恒”
''ls love a fancy or a feeling? No, it is immortal as immaculate truth.''

164
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:08,724
“不似花朵自然凋落”
'''Tis not a blossom shed when youth drops from life's stem.''

165
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:14,714
“爱能生于无水荒漠 不怕缺乏阳光滋润”
''lt grows without water, nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom.''

166
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:20,976
可惜爱德华的朗诵不行
A pity Edward has no passion for reading.

167
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:26,097
是你叫他念的，害他紧张
You asked him to read. then you made him nervous.

168
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:34,226
你待他还很客气，虽然他 念得不好，但你还是喜欢他
Your behaviour is cordial. You like him in spite of his reading.

169
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:40,687
我觉得他...很和善、可敬
l think him everything that is amiable and worthy.

170
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:43,888
真会夸人
Praise. indeed.

171
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:49,044
但如果你要嫁给他 我会好好待他
He shall have my devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother.

172
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:53,495
-我没有你怎么办？ -没有我？
- What shall l do without you? - Without me?

173
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,194
我相信你一定会幸福的 但答应我，千万别住得太远
I'm sure you will be very happy, but promise you won't live far away.

174
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:05,584
-不可能的... -你爱他吗？
- There is no question of ... - Do you love him?

175
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:14,131
我不否认我觉得他很好，我...
l do not deny that l think very highly of him. That l ...

176
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:19,959
非常尊敬他，我喜欢他...
... greatly esteem him. l like him.

177
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:25,467
尊敬？你再这么说，我就走了
Esteem? Like? Use these words again and l shall leave the room!

178
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:33,130
我的感觉是更强烈 但更进一步倒也没有
Believe my feelings to be stronger. Further than that. do not believe.

179
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:37,718
爱情是梦幻还是感觉？
ls love a fancy or a feeling?

180
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:41,906
-莫非是姓费才叫爱 -上床睡觉吧
- Or a Ferrars? - Go to bed.

181
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:47,130
“我不否认...我觉得他很好”
''l do not deny that I think very highly of him.''

182
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:51,703
“我...很尊敬他”
''That l ... greatly esteem him.''

183
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,950
“我喜欢他”
''That l like him.''

184
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:19,154
我们很高兴你邀请爱德华来
We are so happy that you invited Edward to Norland.

185
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,786
我们都很喜欢他
We're all very fond of him.

186
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:28,027
我们对他期望很高 家母对他的期望最高
We have great hopes for him. Mother expects much of him.

187
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:35,025
婚姻也一样，她要他 跟罗伯娶个门当户对的媳妇
And in marriage. She's determined both he and Robert will marry well.

188
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:39,122
希望她要他们为爱结婚
But l hope she desires them to marry for love.

189
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:45,912
但光靠感情 未必会找到适合对象
The heart doesn't always lead us in the most suitable direction.

190
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:53,461
爱德华心肠很好 容易受穷女人骗
Edward is a compassionate person. Penniless women prey on that type.

191
00:21:53,566 --> 00:22:00,374
一旦说定，绝不会食言
Having entered into an understanding he would never go back on his word.

192
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:04,018
不过这也会毁了他
But it would lead to his ruin.

193
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:09,527
我很替他担心 家母已表明她不会给他分文
l'm worried. Mother will withdraw all financial support from him -

194
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:17,110
如果他所爱的人不是门当户对
- should he plant affection in less exalted ground than he deserves.

195
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:22,106
我了解了
l understand you perfectly.

196
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:27,802
搬到迪凡郡？
Devonshire?

197
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:31,225
我表亲约翰爵士 提供一处小房子给我们住
My cousin, Sir John Middleton, has offered us a small house.

198
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,290
他一定很有钱
He must be a man of property.

199
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,463
他太太去世了，跟岳母住在 巴顿公园，他把小屋租给我们
He's a widower from Barton Park. It is Barton Cottage he has offered.

200
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:45,370
小屋？真可爱 住小屋最舒服了
A cottage? Charming. A cottage is always very snug.

201
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:50,396
你们夏天才去吧？
You will not leave before the summer?

202
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:55,639
我们不能再打扰了
We can no longer trespass upon your sister's goodwill.

203
00:22:55,934 --> 00:23:00,156
-你会来住几天吧？ -我很想去
- You will come and stay with us. - l should like that.

204
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:03,794
家母已在伦敦等候很久了
Edward has long been expected by our mother.

205
00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:09,659
爱德华，有空来走走 记得，我们随时欢迎
Come as soon as you can, Edward. Remember, you're always welcome.

206
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,577
-不能带它走吗？ -我们养不起
- Can't you take him with you? - We can't afford him.

207
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:46,165
叫他在厨房帮忙，对不起
Perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen ... Forgive me.

208
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,185
戴小姐...
Miss Dashwood ...

209
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:58,707
爱琳娜...我有话要跟你说
Elinor ... l must speak to you.

210
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,022
有件很重要的事，我必须...
There is something of great importance that l need to ...

211
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:13,940
...跟你说... 是在念书时候的事
... tell you ... about my education.

212
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,145
-念书时候的事？ -是的
- Your education? - Yes.

213
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,004
我是在...普利茅斯念的书
lt was conducted. oddly enough, in Plymouth.

214
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:32,601
-你很熟吗？ -普利茅斯？不熟
- Do you know it? - Plymouth? No.

215
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,610
我在那里念了四年的书
l was four years there.

216
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:42,776
学校校长是布来特先生
ln a school run by Mr. Pratt.

217
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,648
-布来特？ -没错，布来特
- Pratt? - Precisely. Pratt.

218
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:53,782
我在校期间...
While l was there ...

219
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,902
我是说，他当时... 他有个...
That is to say, he had a ... has a ...

220
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:06,261
你得立刻启程去伦敦
You're needed in London this instant.

221
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,637
-我今天下午就走 -妈要你马上动身
- l'm leaving this afternoon. - Mamma wishes you to leave at once.

222
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,979
失陪了
Excuse me.

223
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:50,525
爱德华答应我会带地图集来
Edward promised he would bring the atlas to Barton.

224
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:54,911
我打赌他会在二星期内赶到
l'll wager he will do so in less than a fortnight.

225
00:25:56,993 --> 00:25:58,935
可爱的爱德华...
Dear Edward ...

226
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,485
大家好！
Hello there!

227
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,622
约翰爵士...
Sir John ...

228
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:43,512
太太小姐们...可被我盼到了
Dear ladies! Upon my word! Here you are!

229
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:49,560
-约翰爵士，你太客气了 -别跟我客套，别吵
- Sir John, your kindness ... - None of that! Hush, please!

230
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:53,272
这位是我岳母詹宁斯太太
Here is my dear mamma-in-law, Mrs. Jennings.

231
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:59,254
你一定是戴太太 一路上累了吧，真可怜
You must be Mrs. Dashwood. Was yourjourney tolerable? Poor souls!

232
00:26:59,522 --> 00:27:02,937
怎么不先来我家坐坐
Why did you not come up to the park first?

233
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:08,831
-他看到你们经过 -我马上请约翰备车就来了
- We saw you pass. - l made John call the carriage.

234
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:12,732
-她可是急性子 -这一带朋友少嘛
- She would not wait. - We have so little company.

235
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:16,670
但我们真是一见如故 小姐们还真漂亮
l feel as though l know you already. Delightful creatures!

236
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:23,038
-你们每天一定要来家里吃便饭 -亲爱的约翰，这怎么行呢
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily. - Dear Sir John. we cannot ...

237
00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:30,716
我不接受拒绝 我不管那么多，就这样了
No refusals! l'm quite deaf to them. But l insist!

238
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:34,394
等我们先安顿好再说，谢谢你
Let us settle in. But thank you very much.

239
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:04,289
忙完后 叫人来通知我们一声，再见
Send your man up for the carriage as soon as you're ready. Goodbye.

240
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:08,223
别谢了
Don't thank us.

241
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:29,594
你的脚好冰
Your feet are cold.

242
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:57,917
你怎么弄的？ 这么脏，都可以种菜了
What have you been doing? You can grow potatoes in this dirt.

243
00:28:58,212 --> 00:29:01,343
好冷喔
lt's cold. l'm cold.

244
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:15,770
布莱登跑哪去了？ 不会是他的马跛了吧？
Where can Brandon be? l hope he's not lamed his horse.

245
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:20,475
布上校 是本郡最有价值的单身汉
Col. Brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county.

246
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:26,587
你们其中一位可以嫁给他 以他的年纪比较适合戴小姐
He is bound to go for one of you. He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.

247
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:31,836
就怕她早已名花有主
But l dare say she's left her heart behind in Sussex.

248
00:29:32,132 --> 00:29:36,507
我瞧见了玛丽安 秘密被我发现了
l see you, Miss Marianne! l think l've unearthed a secret.

249
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:39,357
你比我最棒的猎犬还差呢
You are worse than my best pointer.

250
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:47,716
他从事哪一行？ 士农工商？我非打听到不可
ls he a butcher. baker. candlestick maker? l'll winkle it out of you.

251
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:54,233
-她是包打听 -这里可没有秘密
- She's good at winkling. - We've none of us any secrets here.

252
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,045
就算有也不会维持太久
Or if we do. we do not keep them long.

253
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:03,133
-我敢说他是神职人员 -或者是英俊的军官
- He's curate of the parish. - Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

254
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:07,290
-来点暗示吧，他穿不穿制服？ -他没职业
- Give us a clue. ls he in uniform? - He has no profession.

255
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:11,648
他是位绅士？
He's a gentleman?

256
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:19,164
-你明知没有这个人 -就有，他姓的开头是F
- You know there is no such person. - There is. His name begins with F.

257
00:30:19,461 --> 00:30:23,868
F？这就有眉目了
F? A promising letter.

258
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:30,659
佛斯特？ 福瑞特？福林葛？佛斯提
Foster? Forrest? Fotheringay? Featherty?

259
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:33,153
-佛泰斯秋？ -佛顿
- Fortescue? - Fondant?

260
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:38,754
我能否弹你们的钢琴
Might l play your pianoforte?

261
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:43,163
当然可以
Yes. of course.

262
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,936
-大家不要这么拘束 -约翰爵士，请原谅...
- We don't stand on ceremony here. - Please forgive ...

263
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:53,214
上回听歌是哪一年来着？
l cannot remember when we last had a song in the house.

264
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:14,499
布莱登！ 过来见见我们美丽的邻居
Brandon! Come and meet our beautiful new neighbours.

265
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:21,053
真可惜你来迟了 你没听到玛丽安美妙的歌声
What a pity you're late. You have not heard our songbird.

266
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:23,390
确实很可惜
A great pity.

267
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:28,323
这位是我的好友，布莱登上校 东印度的老战友
This is my good friend Col. Brandon. We served in the East lndies.

268
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:33,797
-天下没有比他更好的人 -你去过东印度群岛？
- Not a better fellow in the world. - You've been to the East lndies?

269
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:37,058
-那里是什么样子？ -热得很
- What's it like? - Hot.

270
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,923
空气中全是香味
The air is full of spices.

271
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:48,322
戴小姐，现在轮到你表演了
Now. Miss Dashwood. it's your turn to entertain us.

272
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:52,958
我知道你要唱什么调...
And l believe l know what key you will sing in.

273
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:56,604
F大调
F-major ...

274
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:12,614
乱猜的事你还到处乱讲
You have no right to parade your ignorant assumptions ...

275
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:17,278
-是你说的呀！ -我什么也没说
- You told me. - l told you nothing.

276
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:22,398
-反正他要来 -这种事不能随便说
- They'll meet him when he comes. - You don't speak of such things.

277
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:26,307
-大家都在说 -祗有詹太太
- Everyone else was. - Mrs. Jennings is not ''everyone''.

278
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:30,406
我喜欢她，她爱聊天 我们从不聊天
l like her. She talks about things. We never talk about things.

279
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:38,780
想不到合适的话题 就谈天气好了
lf you can say nothing appropriate, limit your remarks to the weather.

280
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,229
编再大的篮子也够了
Surely they have enough reeds for a Moses basket.

281
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:24,896
你知道外面的传言吧？
You know what they're saying?

282
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:32,520
人家说你看上一个人， 有何不可？
Word is, you've developed a taste for certain company. And why not?

283
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:37,601
你正值壮年...这是她的福气
A man like you in his prime ... She'd be a fortunate young lady.

284
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:41,574
玛丽安看不上我这种人
Marianne Dashwood would no more think of me than of you.

285
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:47,745
-别小看自己 -这样才省她的事
- Don't think of yourself so meanly. - And all the better for her.

286
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:17,343
真是陶醉...他们是天作之合
Besotted ... An excellent match.

287
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:22,279
-他富有，她标致 -你认识他多久了？
- He's rich and she's handsome. - How long have you known him?

288
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:27,206
打从我来这里就认识他了 15年了
As long as l've been here, and l came 15 years back.

289
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:32,102
他家离这里祗有四英哩 他和约翰又是至交
His estate is but four miles hence. He and John are very thick.

290
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:36,168
他没有妻儿 他有段辛酸往事
He has no wife and children. He had a tragic history.

291
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:43,908
他爱上了一个人 但因为家人的反对而没结果
He loved a ward to the family. They were not permitted to marry.

292
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:47,463
-为什么？ -为了钱，伊丽莎很穷
- On what grounds? - Eliza was poor.

293
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:52,968
她被逐出家门，而他被迫从军
She was flung out of the house, and he was packed off to the army.

294
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:55,844
要不是约翰，我想他会想不开
l think he'd have done himself harm if not for John.

295
00:35:57,419 --> 00:36:02,754
-那位小姐后来呢？ -她换了好几个男人
- What became of the lady? - She was passed from man to man.

296
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,919
上流社会就再也没她的踪迹
She disappeared from good society.

297
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:09,862
布莱登从印度回来后 就一直在找她
When Brandon returned from lndia he searched and searched. -

298
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:13,153
在收容所找到时 她已经去逝了
- only to find her dying in a poorhouse.

299
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:19,462
我以为女儿夏洛特 可以令他开心
l thought my daughter Charlotte might have cheered him up.

300
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:25,286
但你看他！多体贴呀！
Look at him now! So attentive!

301
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:32,898
-让我去试探一下 -别去捉弄他吧
- l should try a little experiment. - Please. let the colonel alone.

302
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:35,650
所有的追求者 都需要有人推一把
All suitors need a little help.

303
00:36:35,947 --> 00:36:43,846
-我们好久没听到你弹琴了 -有高手在此，何必班门弄斧
- We haven't heard you play of late. - You have a superior musician here.

304
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:51,557
布兰登跟你一样喜爱音乐 他可是钢琴高手
Brandon shares your passion for music. He plays the pianoforte well.

305
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:56,585
你和玛丽安一样 知道很多哀伤的曲子
You know as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne.

306
00:36:57,835 --> 00:37:03,050
来个二重奏好了 你们合奏一曲
You must play us a duet. Let us see you both side by side.

307
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:08,512
我不会弹二重奏 抱歉，上校
l do not know any duets. Forgive me, Colonel.

308
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:19,621
难道我们没有宁静的一天吗？ 房租虽然便宜，但却要受气
Will we never have peace? The rent is low. but it comes on hard terms.

309
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:24,705
詹太太有钱有闲 她喜欢替人作媒
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's daughters.

310
00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:26,857
有人送包裹来
There's a parcel arrived.

311
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:31,107
你们看！
Look!

312
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:38,930
他又老又虚弱 怎会还有人开这种玩笑？
When is a man safe from such wit. if infirmity does not protect him?

313
00:37:39,276 --> 00:37:42,090
他是虚弱的话 那我不早就是行尸走肉
lf he is infirm. then l am at death's door.

314
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:49,285
他自己说有风湿 他祗说“一点痛”
- He complained of rheumatism. - ''A slight ache'' was his phrase.

315
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:57,446
爱德华说他要亲自拿来的
Edward said he would bring it himself.

316
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:06,337
“谨将地图集物归原主”
''lt gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its owner.''

317
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:12,649
“公事缠身，无法亲自奉还 遗憾之至，恐甚于各位”
''Business prevents my delivering it, which will hurt me more than you.''

318
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:16,965
“感谢各位的盛情 吾将永志难忘”
''Memories of your kindness must sustain me. and l remain -

319
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,358
“祝安，E.C.费洛斯.”
- your devoted servant, E.C. Ferrars.''

320
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:23,275
-他为什么不来？ -亲爱的，他说了他很忙
- Why hasn't he come? - He says he's busy, dear.

321
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:31,812
-他说会来的，为什么不来？ -我带你去散步
- He said he'd come. Why hasn't he? - l'm taking you for a walk.

322
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:37,094
-快要下雨了 -不会的
- lt is going to rain. - lt is not going to rain.

323
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:42,368
我觉得詹太太效应要出现了
l fear Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.

324
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,955
-你一定很想念他，爱琳娜 -妈，我们又没有订婚
- You must miss him. Elinor. - We are not engaged, Mamma.

325
00:38:54,061 --> 00:39:00,487
-可是他爱你，亲爱的 -我不清楚他怎么想
- But he loves you, dearest. - l am by no means assured of that.

326
00:39:00,781 --> 00:39:06,345
就算他有意思，也不代表... 他能娶一位...
And had he such a preference, there would certainly be obstacles -

327
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:11,784
...没地位、 连买糖都嫌贵的女人
- to his marrying a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar.

328
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:18,307
-但你心知肚明... -以现在这情况最好用大脑去想
- But your heart must tell you ... - lt is better to use one's head.

329
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:30,371
-这怎会对我好？ -会的，别抱怨了
- lt can't be good for me. - lt is. Stop complaining.

330
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:34,978
-会害我咳嗽的 -不会的
- lt's giving me a cough. - lt is not giving you a cough.

331

332
00:39:40,782 --> 00:39:45,932
-那里有好多兔子 -我不想看兔子
- Over there is a field of rabbits. - l don't want to see rabbits.

333
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:56,168
-还有什么比这更快乐？ -我说会下雨吧！
- ls anything superior to this? - l told you it would rain.

334
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:02,180
-蓝色的天空！快追！ -我不可以跑的
- Blue sky! Let us chase it! - l'm not supposed to run.

335
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:09,479
有没有受伤？
Are you hurt?

336
00:40:11,182 --> 00:40:18,089
-我不能走了，快去找人帮忙 -我尽量跑快点
- l cannot walk. Run and fetch help. - l will run as fast as l can.

337
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:31,146
玛格丽特！
Margaret!

338
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,870
别害怕，它不会伤害你的
Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.

339
00:40:44,782 --> 00:40:48,808
-你有没有受伤？ -祗伤到脚踝
- Are you hurt? - Only my ankle.

340
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:53,956
我能否看看你是否有骨折？
May l have your permission to ascertain if there are any breaks?

341
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:14,025
骨头没事
lt is not broken.

342
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:18,531
手扶着我脖子好吗？
Can you put your arm about my neck?

343
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,850
让我送你回家吧
Allow me to escort you home.

344
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:30,185
总算回来了！
At last!

345
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:34,570
她摔倒了，他抱她回来！
She fell down and he's carrying her!

346
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,601
玛丽安，你没有受伤？
Marianne, are you hurt?

347
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:42,244
她扭伤了脚踝
lt's a twisted ankle.

348
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:46,699
伤得不严重 我看过骨头了，没事
lt's not serious. l felt the bone. and it's sound.

349
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,499
-不知该怎么谢你才好 -没什么
- l cannot begin to thank you. - Do not think of it.

350
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,688

- Will you not be seated? - l'd leave a water mark.

-我明天能来探望吗？ -欢迎之至
- But permit me to call tomorrow. - We shall look forward to it.

352
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:04,518
我送你出去
l'll show you out.

353
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,487
玛格丽特，这位先生的帽子
Margaret, get the gentleman's hat.

354
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:16,876
-问他叫什么名字！ 请问先生尊姓大名？
- His name! - To whom are we so much obliged?

355
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,982
约翰卫乐比，我住艾伦汉
John Willoughby of Allenham at your service.

356
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:23,271
艾伦汉的约翰卫乐比
John Willoughby of Allenham ...

357
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,679
真是一位绅士！
What an impressive gentleman!

358
00:42:28,976 --> 00:42:33,253
他抱我完全不费吹灰之力
He lifted me as if l weighed no more than a dried leaf.

359
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:38,374
-会痛就告诉我 -妈，她不会痛的
- Tell me if l hurt you. - She feels no pain, Mamma.

360
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:42,795
玛格丽特，请贝丝准备冷敷袋
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress.

361
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,469
等我回来再继续说
Please don't say anything important.

- And spirit and wit and feeling. - And economy. Ten words at most.

- Change, or you'll catch a cold. - What care l for colds?

-等你鼻塞，就会在乎了 -你说的对，快帮我
- You'll care when your nose swells. - You're right. Help me.

366
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:13,515
卫乐比的条件很好 但玛丽安不能要谁就有谁
He's worth catching. Marianne must not have all the men to herself.

367
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:20,136
-你对他了解多少？ -他的马术不错
- But what do you know of him? - There's not a bolder rider.

368
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:25,135
他有何嗜好，作何消遣？
But what are his tastes. his passions, his pursuits?

369
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:35,170
-他的猎狗很灵敏... -艾伦汉在哪？
- He has a smart little pointer ... - Where is Allenham?

370
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:40,714
三哩外的小庄园 他的亲戚将留给他
Nice little estate three miles east. He is to inherit it from a relative.

371
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:44,805
那位亲戚就是艾夫人
Lady Allen is the name.

372
00:43:49,138 --> 00:43:53,328
是布上校，我去外面看着
lt's Col. Brandon. l should go out and keep watch.

373
00:43:55,889 --> 00:44:01,605
你们都在等卫乐比 没人会去想布莱登了
You're looking out for Willoughby. You'll not think of Brandon now.

374
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:04,361
请进
Come in.

375
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:08,680
早安，布莱登
Good morning, Brandon.

376
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:14,641
-病人怎样？ -谢谢你，上校
- How is the invalid? - Thank you so much, Colonel.

377
00:44:14,961 --> 00:44:21,256
你有这么好的对象 何必再想着卫乐比？
Why set your cap at Willoughby when you've already made such a conquest?

378
00:44:21,522 --> 00:44:24,424
我没有想着任何人
l'll not set my cap at anyone.

379
00:44:24,754 --> 00:44:29,358
-艾夫人的外甥是吗？ -他来看所将继承的土地
- Lady Allen's nephew? - He visits. for he's to inherit.

380
00:44:30,898 --> 00:44:37,772
他自己有个漂亮的庄园 在索梅塞的科柏美那
He has a pretty estate of his own. Combe Magna in Somerset.

381
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:43,565
换了我也会舍不得放弃 这个好机会
l'd not give him up to a younger sister for tumbling down hills.

382
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:53,263
他来了，走吧，布莱登 我们最好要识时务
The man himself. Come. Brandon. We know when we are not wanted.

383
00:44:54,354 --> 00:44:57,321
谢谢你们来
Thank you so much for calling.

384
00:44:58,546 --> 00:45:01,164
玛丽安 布上校和约翰爵士要走了
Marianne. the colonel and Sir John are leaving.

385
00:45:01,426 --> 00:45:04,240
再见，谢谢你送的花
Goodbye. Thank you for the flowers.

386
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:19,217
-你好吗，上校？ -问候你自己吧！
- How do you do, Colonel? - How do you do, more like.

387
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:43,848
-卫乐比先生，真高兴再见到你 -完全是我的荣幸
- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure! - The pleasure is all mine.

388
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:48,784
-玛丽安小姐没有感冒吧？ -你知道我的名字了
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold? - You've found out my name.

389
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:54,377
这里到处有我的眼线 你无法接近大自然...
The area is crawling with my spies. You cannot venture out to nature ...

390
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:59,278
-大自然就得来接近你 -好美
- So nature must be brought to you. - How beautiful.

391
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:04,655
-这不是温室里的花朵 -原来有人送过花了
- These are not from the hothouse. - Mine is not the first offering.

392
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:13,050
-这是从田野里摘的 -我一向喜欢野花
- They come from an obliging field. - l always prefer wild flowers.

393
00:46:13,428 --> 00:46:17,650
-帮我放在花瓶里 -我们感激万分
- Would you ..? - Our gratitude is beyond words.

394
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:25,577
我常经过这孤零零的房舍 听说有人住进来
l've grieved for this lonely house. Then l heard it was taken.

395
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:31,952
听说之后就有预感会遇见你们 果然如此
l felt an interest which nothing can account for but my present delight.

396
00:46:32,276 --> 00:46:35,145
请坐，卫先生
Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby.

397
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:40,048
谁在读莎翁的十四行诗？
Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?

398
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:44,050
-玛丽安念给我们听 -你们最喜欢哪一首？
- Marianne is reading them out. - And which are your favourites?

399
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,635
我最喜欢第116首
Mine is 1 16.

400
00:46:47,924 --> 00:46:51,469
“心灵契合，突破阻碍”
''Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments.''

401
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:55,211
说变心就变心...哪能算是爱...
''Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds. -

402
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:58,988
或者任凭抹灭...
- or bends with the remover to remove ...''

403
00:46:59,284 --> 00:47:04,106
-接下来呢？ -“不，爱是永不褪色的印记”
- How does it continue? - ''No. it is an ever fixed mark ...''

404
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:10,634
-纵有狂风暴雨... -是“狂风暴雨”吗？
- ''That looks on tempests...'' - ls it ''tempests''?

405
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:18,673
没想到你也读这个 我随时带在身边
lt's strange you are reading these. l carry them with me always.

406
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,579
明天见
Until tomorrow then ...

407
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:37,555
袖珍诗集就送给你好了 给你当护身符
My pocket sonnets are yours. A talisman against further injury.

408
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:40,266
再见，谢谢你
Goodbye. Thank you.

409
00:47:45,717 --> 00:47:51,881
不错嘛，玛丽安 你们谈了莎翁和其他诗词
Good work. Marianne. You covered Shakespeare, Scott, poetry.

410
00:47:52,213 --> 00:47:58,159
等你知道他对爱情的看法后 你们就没有话题了
When you know his views on romance, you'll have nothing left to talk of.

411
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:04,268
我想我的确不矜持 我应该祗谈天气
l suppose l erred against decorum. l should have talked of the weather.

412
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:08,493
卫先生明t你对他的兴趣
Mr. WilIoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

413
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:11,723
我干嘛要隐藏？
Should l hide my regard?

414
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:17,487
-毕竟我们对他所知不多 -亲密程度不在时间长短
- No. but we know so little of him. - Time does not determine intimacy.

415
00:48:17,782 --> 00:48:22,484
有些人相处七年还是不熟 但对有些人而言七天已足够
Seven years is too little for some, seven days is enough for others.

416
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:27,148
-对你们而言祗需七个小时 -我觉得我对他已经很了解了
- Or seven hours. in this case. - l feel l know him already.

417
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:32,267
我要是隐藏我的感觉， 才会跟你一样
Had l more shallow feelings, l could perhaps conceal them as you do.

418
00:48:32,565 --> 00:48:36,721
-对不起... -用不着解释
- l'm sorry ... - Don't trouble yourself, Marianne.

419
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,957
我真不了解她
l do not understand her.

420
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:13,071
玛丽安...
Marianne ...

421
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:19,660
-画完了没？ -还没，要有耐心
- Haven't you finished yet? - No. Patience.

422
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:34,671
糖不买了，牛肉也不买了吗？
You're not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?

423
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:39,505
-肉都好贵 -你要我们饿肚子吗？
- There is nothing under ten pence. - Do you want us to starve?

424
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:43,954
不是，祗是不吃牛肉
No. Just not to eat beef.

425
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:28,723
如果我的行为真的失当 我自己清楚
lf my behaviour was improper, l should be sensible of it.

426
00:50:29,015 --> 00:50:34,514
外面已经传得很难听了 你不觉得你应该反省吗？
lt has caused impertinent remarks. Do you not doubt your discretion?

427
00:50:34,808 --> 00:50:40,405
若要理会詹太太的话 那我们不就都难过死了
lf Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove impropriety, we are all offending.

428
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:45,361
早，上校
Good morning, Colonel.

429
00:50:45,432 --> 00:50:51,444
戴小姐，玛丽安 我是来邀请你们的
Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne. l come to issue an invitation.

430
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,408
我要在庄园举办野餐
A picnic on my estate at Delaford.

431
00:50:59,704 --> 00:51:02,671
请你们参加 是在下星期四
lf you would care to join us on Thursday next.

432
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,764
詹太太的女儿和女婿也会来
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband are travelling up especially.

433
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,043
我们很乐意参加，上校
We should be delighted, Colonel.

434
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:19,508
我当然也会邀请卫先生
l will, of course, be including Mr. Willoughby in the party.

435
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:21,806
我很乐意参加
l should be delighted to join you.

436
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,222
早安，戴小姐 早，上校
Good morning, Miss Dashwood. Good morning, Colonel.

437
00:51:31,513 --> 00:51:34,382
上校邀请我们去他家作客
The colonel has invited us to Delaford.

438
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:40,081
-听说你有部好钢琴 -布洛伍钢琴
- l hear you have a fine pianoforte. - A Broadwood Grand.

439
00:51:40,376 --> 00:51:45,394
-那我可以弹给你们听 -我们等不及了
- Then l shall play for you all. - We shall look forward to it.

440
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:04,848
-令妹看起来很开心 -她这个人从不隐藏情绪
- Your sister seems very happy. - She does not hide her emotions.

441
00:52:06,073 --> 00:52:10,710
她对爱情的定义 往往使她忘了礼仪
Her romantic prejudices tend to set propriety at naught.

442
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:16,367
-她真是天真浪漫 -是太天真了
- She is wholly unspoilt. - Rather too unspoilt.

443
00:52:16,665 --> 00:52:21,585
她愈早认清这个世界愈好
The sooner she is acquainted with the ways of the world, the better.

444
00:52:25,305 --> 00:52:30,061
我认识一个人很像令妹 个性一样冲动、可爱
l knew a lady with the same sweetness of temper -

445
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:35,664
后来她被迫认清了这个世界
- who was forced into a better acquaintance with the world.

446
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:41,263
结果是痛苦绝望
The result was only ruination and despair.

447
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:44,976
能免则免，戴小姐
Do not desire it. Miss Dashwood.

448
00:52:47,513 --> 00:52:52,302
布上校的草坪最适合放风筝了
Col. Brandon's lawn is perfect for kite launching.

449
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,089
要小心彩带
Mind the pretty ribbons.

450
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:02,479
我事前不知道 夏洛特一家人跟表妹露茜会来
lmagine my surprise when Charlotte and her master appeared with Lucy.

451
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,615
真是太意外了
The last person l expected to see.

452
00:53:05,913 --> 00:53:10,452
她是来玩的 家里没钱办活动
She came to join in the fun. There is no such luxury at home.

453
00:53:10,746 --> 00:53:14,007
好久没见到你
l'd not seen you for so long.

454
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:18,837
你骗人！你是要见戴小姐
You sly thing! lt was the Dashwoods she wanted to see.

455
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,944
她整天戴小姐长，戴小姐短的
l've heard nothing but ''Dashwood'' for l don't know how long.

456
00:53:23,194 --> 00:53:29,238
露茜，你见着了，觉得如何？ 母亲在信里都写你们的事
What do you think of them? My mother wrote of little eIse in her letters.

457
00:53:29,562 --> 00:53:32,529
-妈形容得一点也没错吧？ 错得离谱
- Are they not as she described? - Nothing like.

458
00:53:33,914 --> 00:53:36,597
你今天真没礼貌
You are quite rude today.

459
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:42,323
他要当议员 要讨人喜欢，所以很累
He's to be an MP. and he is forced to make everybody like him.

460
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:48,334
-我哪会说这种离谱的话？ -看他脾气变来变去的
- l said nothing so irrational. - Mr. Palmer's so droll.

461
00:53:48,635 --> 00:53:53,042
他来了！ 夏洛特，你快看看
Here he comes! Now you shall see, Charlotte.

462
00:53:58,395 --> 00:54:01,558
卫先生，你好
Hello, Mr. Willoughby!

463
00:54:02,779 --> 00:54:06,521
来见见我女儿夏洛特和巴先生
You must meet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr. Palmer.

464
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:12,048
-和我的小表妹，史露茜 -欢迎
- And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele. - Welcome to our party.

465
00:54:18,395 --> 00:54:20,249
我能坐你旁边吗？
May l sit beside you?

466
00:54:21,499 --> 00:54:25,427
我早就想认识你 大家对你推崇之至
l've longed to meet you. I've heard nothing but praise for you.

467
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:32,930
约翰爵士他们太会夸奖人了
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are too excessive in their compliments.

468
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:38,549
夸你的是另有他人 而他不会随便赞美人的
The praise came from another source. One not inclined to exaggeration.

469
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:41,745
怎么回事？
What can this be?

470
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:53,913
布莱登上校在吗？
ls Col. Brandon here?

471
00:55:03,643 --> 00:55:06,806
-快牵我的马来！ -怎么回事？
- My horse! - What's the matter?

472
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:09,881
-我得马上赶到伦敦 -这怎么行？
- l must away to London. - lmpossible!

473
00:55:11,132 --> 00:55:16,434
野餐没有主人怎么可以 明天再去吧
We can't picnic without our host. Come up to town tomorrow.

474
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:23,191
-或等野餐结束，才几个小时 -一分钟也耽误不得
- Or wait until we return. - l can't afford to lose one minute.

475
00:55:23,516 --> 00:55:27,793
-请原谅 -希望问题不严重
- Forgive me. - l hope it's nothing serious.

476
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:32,599
这可真反常
Upon my soul, this is all very unusual.

477
00:55:34,043 --> 00:55:40,207
-脆弱，你的名字叫布莱登 -有些人见不得人家开心
- Frailty, thy name is Brandon. - Some cannot bear pleasure.

478
00:55:40,444 --> 00:55:44,753
你们好坏 布上校不在好可惜
You are a wicked pair. Col. Brandon will be missed.

479
00:55:45,084 --> 00:55:51,575
为什么？每个人都说他好 却都不怎么理他
Why? Everyone speaks well of him, but no one remembers to talk to him.

480
00:55:51,868 --> 00:55:55,413
胡说 约翰爵士他们都很敬重他
Nonsense. He is highly respected at Barton Park.

481
00:55:55,709 --> 00:55:59,800
-这等于是在骂他 -卫乐比，你也真是的
- Which is enough censure in itself. - Really, Willoughby.

482
00:56:00,092 --> 00:56:04,848
过来，傲慢先生 我知道你爱乱搞
Come, come, Mr. lmpudence. l know your wicked ways.

483
00:56:05,148 --> 00:56:11,607
快说你的情人是谁，朋友之间 是没有秘密的，我帮你
Reveal your beau. No secrets between friends. l'll winkle it out of you.

484
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:17,464
我要你嫁给上校 否则我马上吞帽
l'll have you married to the colonel by tea, or l'll swallow my bonnet.

485
00:56:19,228 --> 00:56:23,483
-好像他配得上你似的 -你为什么不喜欢他？
- As if you could marry him. - Why should you dislike him?

486
00:56:25,021 --> 00:56:29,363
因为我要晴天，他却爱雨天
Because he threatened me with rain when l wanted it fine.

487
00:56:29,693 --> 00:56:34,427
他爱挑我马车的缺点 又不肯买我的马
He found fault with my high flyer and will not buy my brown mare.

488
00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:39,222
但为了满足你
If it will be of satisfaction to you, -

489
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:43,924
我愿意说 他在其他各方面是完美无瑕
- l believe his character to be. in all other respects, irreproachable.

490
00:56:44,189 --> 00:56:49,623
我既然忍痛承认 就请允许我...
ln return for this acknowledgement, don't deny me the privilege -

491
00:56:49,917 --> 00:56:54,008
讨厌他，就如同我喜爱...
- of disliking him as much as l adore ...

492
00:56:58,045 --> 00:57:01,306
这间小屋
... this cottage.

493
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:07,675
-我计划要整修房子 -这点我绝不赞同
- l have plans for improvements. - That. l will never consent to.

494
00:57:07,997 --> 00:57:12,023
一瓦一砖也不许增加
Not a stone must be added to its walls.

495
00:57:12,285 --> 00:57:17,074
我若有钱 就会把家拆掉照这间重新建造
Were l rich enough, l'd rebuild Combe Magna to this exact image.

496
00:57:17,341 --> 00:57:23,538
-你喜欢冒烟的壁炉？ -尤其是会冒烟的壁炉
- With a fire that smokes? - Especially the fire that smokes.

497
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:28,660
如此我在家就和在这一样开心
Then l'd be as happy at Combe as l've been at Barton.

498
00:57:28,957 --> 00:57:34,172
但我对这房子有特别的感情
But this place has one claim on my affections none other can share.

499
00:57:34,974 --> 00:57:37,527
答应我不要改变它
Promise never to change it.

500
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:49,266
你不怕被说闲话送我一程 让我受宠若惊
l'm honoured you risk your honour by seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

501
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:54,684
-爱琳娜也会这么说 -她说得对
- That is what Elinor would say. - And she would be right.

502
00:57:54,974 --> 00:58:00,058
玛丽安 明天能否和我单独见面？
Miss Marianne, will you grant me an interview tomorrow ... alone?

503
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:04,572
-卫乐比，我们一直都是如此 -可是...
- Willoughby, we are always alone. - But there is ...

504
00:58:04,863 --> 00:58:08,823
我有特别的事要问你
There is something very particular l should like to ask you.

505
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:14,781
当然 我会请妈让我不必上教堂
Of course. l shall ask Mamma if I may stay behind from church.

506
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:18,459
谢谢
Thank you.

507
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,860
明天见
Until tomorrow. then.

508
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:38,136
哦，美德...
Oh. Virtue ...

509
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:43,164
安静地、小心地进入 今天在座的各位心中
Silently and with fear, enter the hearts of all that hear me this day.

510
00:58:44,415 --> 00:58:47,611
你想他会跪着说吗？
Will he kneel down when he asks her?

511
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,837
求婚都得下跪
They always kneel down.

512
00:59:04,543 --> 00:59:07,325
怎么了，亲爱的？
What is wrong, dearest?

513
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:12,886
卫乐比？怎么回事？
Willoughby? What is the matter?

514
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:17,143
对不起...我奉命...
Forgive me ... l am sent ...

515
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:23,222
艾夫人运用富人的特权...
Lady Allen exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin.

516
00:59:23,686 --> 01:07:07,930
-你说呢？ -让我去嘛！我都快12岁了
- She is sending me to London. - This morning?

517
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:33,013
真是遗憾 你应该不会去很久吧？
What a disappointment. Your business won't detain you for long, l hope?

518
00:59:33,343 --> 00:59:39,038
谢谢你的好意 可是我短期之内不会回来了
You are kind. but l have no idea of returning immediately to Devonshire.

519
00:59:40,288 --> 00:59:45,885
-我一年祗被邀请来一次 -若是邀请你，可晚点再走吗？
- l am invited only once a year. - Can you wait for our invitation?

520
00:59:47,808 --> 00:59:54,070
我的事情很紧急...我不敢...
My engagements are of such a nature ... l dare not flatter my ...

521
00:59:55,584 --> 01:00:00,734
这样很不明智 我不想再折磨自己
lt's folly to linger in this manner. l will not torment myself further.

522
01:00:01,024 --> 01:00:03,479
卫乐比，回来！
Willoughby, come back!

523
01:00:05,088 --> 01:00:08,055
请贝丝帮玛丽安泡杯茶
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea for Marianne.

524
01:00:08,352 --> 01:00:13,786
-怎么回事？ -别问我
- What is wrong, my love? - Do not ask me questions.

525
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:24,024
-他们一定是吵架了 -不太像
- They must have quarrelled. - That is unlikely.

526
01:00:25,408 --> 01:00:30,361
也许是艾夫人 不赞成他们在一起
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves of his regard for Marianne.

527
01:00:30,656 --> 01:00:35,544
-找藉口支开他 -那他为何不明说？
- An excuse to send him away. - Then why did he not say so?

528
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,997
-他平常什么事都说的 -那你觉得是什么事呢？
- lt's not like him to be secretive. - What do you suspect?

529
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:47,031
-他为何面有愧色？ -你是说他一直都在做戏？
- Why was his manner so guilty? - You think he's been acting a part?

530
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:52,031
-不，他爱她，这点我敢肯定 -他当然爱她
- No. He loves her. l am sure. - Of course!

531
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:55,800
他有没有保证他会回来？
Has he left her any assurance of his return?

532
01:00:56,065 --> 01:00:58,431
问问看他是否有求婚
Ask if he proposed.

533
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:03,707
不行！我不能去逼问她 你也不该
No! l cannot force a confidence from Marianne. Neither should you.

534
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:07,830
让她自己跟我们说
We must trust her to confide in us in her own time.

535
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:12,408
我总觉得他有问题
There was something underhand in his manner.

536
01:01:12,705 --> 01:01:15,039
你对他有成见
You will think the worst of him.

537
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:20,095
我愿意相信他 我们都应该如此
l give him the benefit of my good opinion. He deserves no less.

538
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,734
妈，我很喜欢卫乐比
l am very fond of Willoughby.

539
01:01:24,033 --> 01:01:27,611
妈...妈！
Mamma ... Mamma!

540
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:35,065
她不让我进去
She would not let me in.

541
01:02:17,954 --> 01:02:22,329
-雨停该有多好 -你能闭嘴更好
- lf only this rain would stop. - lf only you would stop.

542
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:29,184
是你要娶我女儿的 而且算是便宜你了
'Twas you took her off my hands, Mr. Palmer. A good bargain, too.

543
01:02:29,506 --> 01:02:34,656
现在我手上的牌比你强 因为你不能把人还给我
Now l have the whip hand over you, for you cannot give her back.

544
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:42,367
玛丽安，来玩牌 你这样，他也不会回来的
Marianne, play with us. Looking at the weather will not bring him back.

545
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:47,741
-她晚餐都没吃 -最近好无聊
- She ate nothing at dinner. - We're all forlorn these days.

546
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:54,076
戴小姐 我们可以...讨论了吧？
Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now we might have our ... discussion.

547
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:59,324
-讨论？ -有件事我一直想请教你
- Our discussion? - l've longed to ask you something.

548
01:02:59,619 --> 01:03:04,834
就怕有点冒昧，这问题很突兀
You might think me impertinent. lt is an odd question.

549
01:03:06,147 --> 01:03:12,093
如果卫先生回家了，我们可以 陪令妹找他，我们祗相距半哩
lf only he'd gone to Combe Magna. We live but half a mile away.

550
01:03:12,195 --> 01:03:18,872
-是五哩半 -我不相信有那么远
- Five and a half. - l cannot believe it is that far.

551
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:22,530
-我不相信 -试着相信
- l can't believe it. - Try.

552
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:29,751
你可以问我任何问题 如果我可以帮得上忙
You may ask any manner of question if that is of any help.

553
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:35,963
你认识 你大嫂的母亲，费太太吗？
Are you acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother Mrs. Ferrars?

554
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:42,320
芬妮的母亲？ 不，我没见过她
Fanny's mother? No. l have never met her.

555
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:48,290
你一定觉得奇怪 如果我告诉你…
You must think me strange to ask. lf only l dared tell ...

556
01:03:48,586 --> 01:03:54,150
如果她在说F先生的事 你可得要告诉我们
lf she tells you of the famous Mr. F, you must pass it on.

557
01:03:56,170 --> 01:04:00,512
陪我走走好吗？
Will you take a turn with me, Miss Dashwood?

558
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,850
我不知道你跟她家有关系
l had no idea you were at all connected with that family.

559
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:13,060
我目前与费太太毫无关系
l am nothing to Mrs. Ferrars at present.

560
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:20,390
但可能有这么一天 我会跟她相当亲近
But the time may come when we may be very intimately connected.

561
01:04:20,681 --> 01:04:23,648
此话怎讲？
What do you mean?

562
01:04:25,961 --> 01:04:28,775
你是否和芬妮的弟弟，罗伯 有了婚约？
Do you have an understanding with Fanny's brother Robert?

563
01:04:30,057 --> 01:04:35,905
老么？不，我不曾见过他
The youngest? No. l have never met him in my life.

564
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:41,350
-是和爱德华 -爱德华费洛斯？
- With Edward. - Edward Ferrars?

565
01:04:42,536 --> 01:04:47,456
爱德华和我私订终身有五年了
Edward and l have been secretly engaged these five years.

566
01:04:50,984 --> 01:04:53,602
你一定很意外
You may well be surprised.

567
01:04:53,928 --> 01:04:58,532
我知道你一定会保密才跟你说
l only mention it because l entirely trust you to keep our secret.

568
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:05,090
爱德华拿你当妹妹看
Edward looks on you quite as his own sister.

569
01:05:06,087 --> 01:05:09,435
对不起，我们…
l am sorry. Surely we ...

570
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:15,773
我们说的是不同的两个人吧？
We surely do not mean the same Mr. Ferrars.

571
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:20,773
是同一人，我曾就读 我舅舅在普茅利斯主持的学校
Yes. He was under the tutelage of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.

572
01:05:22,023 --> 01:05:27,424
-他没跟你提过？ -对…有的
- Has he never spoken of it? - Yes ... Yes. l believe he has.

573
01:05:30,087 --> 01:05:36,578
我希望得到他母亲的首肯 但我们相爱的无法自拔
l wanted his mother's approval, but we loved each other so much.

574
01:05:38,182 --> 01:05:45,852
你应能体会 他很容易让女人倾心
You must have seen how capable he is of making a woman attached to him.

575
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:52,091
我们相爱得非常辛苦
l cannot pretend it has not been hard on both of us.

576
01:05:52,357 --> 01:05:56,993
我们一年最多祗能见上二次面
We can scarcely meet above twice a year.

577
01:06:05,797 --> 01:06:09,593
你好像有点不对劲 你还好吧？
You seem out of sorts. Are you quite well?

578
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:15,904
-我没冒犯你吧？ -我要知道你们在说什么
- l have not offended you? - l must know what you are saying.

579
01:06:16,165 --> 01:06:23,039
-答应我，绝不说出去 戴小姐好像略有所思
- Promise me you'll not tell a soul. - Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.

580
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:26,850
我答应你
l give you my word.

581
01:06:27,141 --> 01:06:31,996
-什么事让你兴致这么高？ -说来听听！
- What has so fascinated you? - Tell us all!

582
01:06:32,672 --> 01:06:39,203
-我们在谈伦敦的事 -你听到没有 夏洛特？
- We were talking of London. - Do you hear that, Charlotte?

583
01:06:40,457 --> 01:06:43,087
-你们在说悄悄话的时候 夏洛特和我有了个想法
- Charlotte and l concocted a plan. - The best plan in the world!

584
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:44,784
世上最好的想法
l make for London shortly, and l invite you, Lucy, -

585
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:48,199
我马上就要去伦敦 并且邀请你，露茜

586
01:06:49,177 --> 01:06:51,122
和两位戴小姐同行
- and both the Misses Dashwood to join me.

587
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:54,393
-绝妙的主意 -伦敦！

588
01:06:56,606 --> 01:06:59,289
-我可以去吗？ -你还小
Can l go?

589
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:05,215
你们跟我住在雀尔喜 享受社交季节的活动
You will all come to my Chelsea home and taste of the season's delights.

590
01:07:03,998 --> 01:07:07,991
-叫我去伦敦 -今天早上？

591
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:08,210
Please, can l go?

592
01:07:08,227 --> 01:07:14,904
-她们就要去伦敦了 -我来就为了此事
- Do you not long for it to be so? - l came here with no other view.

593
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:22,331
-我们不能丢下家母一个人 -她不必你们操心
- We can't leave our mother. - She can spare you very well.

594
01:07:22,627 --> 01:07:28,409
-一点也没错！ -我高兴都来不及
- Of course she can! - l could not be more delighted.

595
01:07:28,706 --> 01:07:33,659
我不许你拒绝，戴小姐 我们来握手约定
l will brook no refusal. Let us strike hands on the bargain.

596
01:07:33,953 --> 01:07:40,215
如果你们九月还结不了婚 那就不是我的错！
lf l don't have you married by Michaelmas, it will not be my fault.

597
01:07:47,905 --> 01:07:51,200
我从来没这么感激过
l've never been so grateful.

598
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:56,409
我可以见到卫乐比了 你也可以见到爱德华
l shall see Willoughby, and you will see Edward.

599
01:07:56,673 --> 01:08:01,691
-你睡着了？ -有你在我睡得着吗？
- Are you asleep? - With you in the room?

600
01:08:02,721 --> 01:08:10,042
你心里不可能像外表般平静 我今晚睡不着了
You can't feel as calm as you look. Oh, l will never sleep tonight.

601
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:14,460
你跟史小姐说了什么 说这么久？
What were you and Miss Steele talking about so long?

602
01:08:14,752 --> 01:08:17,850
没什么重要的
Nothing of significance.

603
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:40,376
没有女儿陪着 自己一人怎会去住那大房子？
How do you think l like poking about in that big house without Charlotte?

604
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:47,257
我写信给爱德华了 但不知我们能见几次面
l wrote to Edward, yet l do not know how much l may see of him.

605
01:08:47,551 --> 01:08:52,788
保密非常重要，他不能来找我
Secrecy is vital. He'll never be able to call.

606
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:57,591
还好他对我始终如一
My only comfort has been the constancy of his affection.

607
01:08:57,886 --> 01:09:03,319
你很幸运，这么久了 你们之间没有疑虑
You're fortunate never to have had any doubts on that score.

608
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:09,725
我可是个醋坛子 如果他多谈论哪个小姐…
l am of a jealous nature. Had he talked more of one young woman ...

609
01:09:10,014 --> 01:09:14,454
但他从来没让我操心过
But he's not given a moment's alarm on that count.

610
01:09:14,782 --> 01:09:18,556
我们成了朋友 他一定很开心
lmagine how glad he'll be to learn that we are friends.

611
01:09:24,382 --> 01:09:28,822
-皮基安，想不想我？ -想极了，夫人
- Have you missed me, Pigeon? - Very much, ma'am.

612
01:09:29,086 --> 01:09:34,802
-一切都很好吧？ -很好，但可能要买煤炭
- ls everything in order? - l suggest the ordering of coal.

613
01:09:35,101 --> 01:09:41,046
鹦鹉，你还活着 快泡茶，皮基安
There you are, Pooter. Still alive, l see ... Tea, Pigeon.

614
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:46,675
你真是分秒必争 交给皮基安处理
You do not waste any time. Give it to Pigeon.

615
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:56,170
詹太太说令妹要买婚纱
Mrs. Jennings says your sister will buy her wedding clothes in town.

616
01:09:57,181 --> 01:10:01,752
约翰和芬妮在镇上 我们得去见他们
John and Fanny are in town. We should be forced to see them.

617
01:10:10,396 --> 01:10:14,072
是找隔壁的？
l think it was for next door.

618
01:10:14,396 --> 01:10:19,513
你坐下吧 你这样让我好紧张
Sit down for two seconds. You're making me nervous.

619
01:10:35,451 --> 01:10:38,298
爱琳娜，是卫乐比
Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.

620
01:10:39,003 --> 01:10:42,231
是真的
lndeed it is.

621
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,514
对不起，上校
Excuse me. Colonel.

622
01:10:51,386 --> 01:10:53,841
上校…
Colonel ...

623
01:10:55,226 --> 01:10:59,568
真高兴见到你 你一直在伦敦吗？
What a pleasure to see you. Have you been in London all this while?

624
01:10:59,866 --> 01:11:02,582
对不起，戴小姐…
What a pleasure to see you. Have you been in London all this while?

625
01:11:03,674 --> 01:11:08,278
我在镇上听到消息…
l have heard reports through town ...

626
01:11:09,945 --> 01:11:13,873
请你直接了当的说吧
Tell me once and for all:

627
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:18,675
令妹跟卫先生的事决定了没？
ls everything resolved between your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

628
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:27,187
他们都没告诉我是否有约定
Though neither one has informed me of their understanding, -

629
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,578
但我知道他们是彼此相爱
- l have no doubt of their mutual affection.

630
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:35,511
谢谢你，戴小姐
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

631
01:11:36,953 --> 01:11:40,400
我祝令妹一切美满幸福
To your sister l wish all imaginable happiness.

632
01:11:41,752 --> 01:11:47,600
至于卫先生 愿他好自为之让她幸福
To Mr. Willoughby, that he may endeavour to deserve her.

633
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:52,880
这是什么意思？
What do you mean?

634
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:55,892
请原谅，我…
Forgive me ...

635
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:02,518
原谅我
Forgive me.

636
01:12:13,559 --> 01:12:19,570
-约翰，爱德华呢？ -爱德华是谁？
- Where is dear Edward. John? - And who is Edward?

637
01:12:19,863 --> 01:12:23,059
是舍弟，爱德华费洛斯
My brother. Mr. Edward Ferrars.

638
01:12:23,351 --> 01:12:28,369
费洛斯是F开头吗？
Ferrars with an F?

639
01:12:33,078 --> 01:12:38,642
有没有消息？ 什么都没有？没卡片？
Are there any messages? No message at all? No cards?

640
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:44,531
-你都不问有没有信 -对，我没有等信
- You do not ask for your messages. - No, for l do not expect any.

641
01:12:44,854 --> 01:12:48,050
我在这里没有什么熟人
l have very little acquaintance in town.

642
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:09,167
别跟我嘀咕 你们自己去解决
Not another word about the ham bone. You and Cartwright sort it out.

643
01:13:09,461 --> 01:13:14,795
-没有消息，夫人 -别着急，亲爱的
- No messages. - Do not fret, my dear.

644
01:13:15,093 --> 01:13:19,631
因为天气很好 很多人到乡下打球
This good weather is keeping many a sportsman in the country.

645
01:13:19,925 --> 01:13:23,983
但一下霜 他们保证很快就回来
But the frost will soon drive them to town. Depend on it.

646
01:13:24,277 --> 01:13:28,619
我怎么没想到
l had not thought of that.

647
01:13:28,948 --> 01:13:31,664
戴小姐可以放心了
And Miss Dashwood may set her heart at rest, -

648
01:13:31,956 --> 01:13:37,138
听说你大嫂 今晚要邀请F先生参加舞会
- for your sister-in-law is inviting Mr. F to the ball tonight.

649
01:13:38,324 --> 01:13:42,284
小心马粪
Do be careful. the horses have been here.

650
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:47,499
快下雨了，跟我来
lt is beginning to rain also. Follow me.

651
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:19,208
妈！好热闹啊！
Mamma! This is very merry!

652
01:14:20,978 --> 01:14:26,280
-有没认识的人？ -巴先生比较高，叫他看
- Do you spy anyone we know? - No. Mr. Palmer has a better view.

653
01:14:26,578 --> 01:14:30,472
-巴先生，有看到熟人吗？ -可惜没有
- Do you see anyone we know? - Unfortunately not.

654
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:38,188
你真爱捉弄人 那不是约翰戴虚伍夫人吗？
How can you be such a tease? There is Mrs. John Dashwood.

655
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:41,260
亲爱的，快跟我来
Come along, my dears.

656
01:14:45,137 --> 01:14:47,592
你们在这里！
There you are!

657
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:53,222
这里好热…你有伴吧？
How hot it is ... You are not alone. l trust?

658
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:57,350
约翰去找舍弟了
John is just gone to fetch my brother.

659
01:14:57,649 --> 01:15:01,805
令弟来了！真是好消息
Your brother! l declare. this is good news, indeed.

660
01:15:03,569 --> 01:15:06,285
我一定马上昏倒
l shall faint clean away.

661
01:15:06,608 --> 01:15:11,309
詹太太，真高兴见到你 这位是我的小舅子…
Mrs. Jennings, l am pleased to meet you. My brother-in-law ...

662
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,020
罗伯费洛斯
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

663
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,614
戴小姐，史小姐，玛丽安
Miss Dashwood. Miss Steele. Miss Marianne.

664
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,148
各位小姐，我们终于见面了
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

665
01:15:25,295 --> 01:15:29,091
你是弟弟吗？爱德华没来吗？
You must be the younger brother. ls Mr. Edward not here?

666
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:34,147
-戴小姐以为他会来 -他太忙了
- Miss Dashwood was counting on him. - He is far too busy.

667
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:37,894
况且这里没他认识的人 来了没啥意思
There's no special acquaintance here to make his attendance worthwhile.

668
01:15:39,503 --> 01:15:44,074
时下的年青人都在做什么？ 全都躲起来了？
What are the men about these days? Are they in hiding?

669
01:15:45,454 --> 01:15:51,782
既然你哥哥没来 你得和戴小姐跳支舞
ln the absence of your brother you must dance with Miss Dashwood.

670
01:15:55,535 --> 01:15:57,389
这是我的荣幸
lt would be my honour.

671
01:16:03,502 --> 01:16:08,903
或许史小姐也能赏光
Perhaps Miss SteeIe might consider reserving the allemande?

672
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:51,461
戴小姐，你住在迪凡郡吧？
You reside in Devonshire. Miss Dashwood?

673
01:16:55,021 --> 01:16:58,403
-住的是一间小屋？ -是的
- ln a cottage? - Yes.

674
01:17:00,044 --> 01:17:03,873
我非常喜欢小屋
l am excessively fond of a cottage.

675
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:09,601
我若有余钱，也会盖一间
lf l had any money to spare, l should build one myself.

676
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:23,784
卫先生…
Mr. Willoughby ...

677
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:27,619
-你好吗，戴小姐？ 很好，谢谢
- How do you do, Miss Dashwood? - Very well.

678
01:17:27,915 --> 01:17:31,111
-家人好吗？ -我们都很好
- How is your family? - We are all extremely well.

679
01:17:34,155 --> 01:17:36,293
谢谢你的关心
Thank you for your kind inquiry.

680
01:17:39,115 --> 01:17:41,253
卫乐比！
Willoughby!

681
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:54,921
天啊，卫乐比…
Good God, Willoughby ...

682
01:17:56,682 --> 01:17:58,820
你不跟我握手吗？
Will you not shake hands with me?

683
01:18:00,394 --> 01:18:02,499
你好，玛丽安
How do you do, Miss Marianne?

684
01:18:05,706 --> 01:18:10,310
怎么了？你怎么都不来看我？
What is the matter? Why have you not come to see me?

685
01:18:11,497 --> 01:18:15,009
你之前不在伦敦吗？ 有没有收到我的信？
Were you not in London? Have you not received my letters?

686
01:18:15,306 --> 01:18:19,844
谢谢你写信给我
l had the pleasure of receiving the information you sent to me.

687
01:18:21,961 --> 01:18:26,238
看在老天份上，卫乐比 告诉我怎么回事？
For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell me what is wrong.

688
01:18:28,617 --> 01:18:30,689
谢谢，我很感激
Thank you. l am most obliged.

689
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:35,877
恕我失陪，朋友在等我
Excuse me, I must rejoin my party.

690
01:18:55,976 --> 01:18:59,292
去找他，叫他马上过来
Go to him. Force him to come to me instantly.

691
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:04,383
玛丽安，我们走吧
You must come away.

692
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:11,389
-你认识她们吗？ -乡下来的
- Do you know them? - Acquaintances from the country.

693
01:19:19,623 --> 01:19:21,924
走吧，亲爱的
Come away, dearest.

694
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:34,848
我不懂，我一定要跟他说清楚
l do not understand. l must speak to him ...

695
01:19:35,142 --> 01:19:40,640
天啊，走，亲爱的 出去透透气
My goodness. Come, dear. You need some air.

696
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:55,265
露茜！我们要走了
Lucy! We must go.

697
01:19:55,557 --> 01:20:00,477
如果我们能送她回家 这将是我们的荣幸
lt would be our pleasure to escort your young charge home.

698
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:02,627
你人真好
How kind.

699
01:20:03,877 --> 01:20:09,146
她真的在晚上叫人捎信给他？
She actually sent him messages during the night?

700
01:20:19,012 --> 01:20:23,354
-玛丽安，拜托你告诉我 -别问我
- Marianne, please tell me. - Do not ask me questions.

701
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:29,881
-你都不信任我 -你自己还不是都不说
- You have no confidence in me. - You confide in no one.

702
01:20:31,844 --> 01:20:36,961
-我没有什么好说的 -那我们都没话可说
- l have nothing to tell. - We neither of us do.

703
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:40,994
毕竟我是毫无秘密 你则是守口如瓶
l, because l conceal nothing. You, because you communicate nothing.

704
01:20:48,451 --> 01:20:53,666
查夫人应该别请这么多客人 昨晚可把我给热死了
Lady Charteris ought to limit her invitation list. lt was very warm.

705
01:20:53,956 --> 01:20:56,672
幸好我们能提早离开
l am glad we left early.

706
01:20:57,891 --> 01:21:01,186
来了吧
There now ...

707
01:21:04,355 --> 01:21:10,334
爱人吵得凶也去得快 看了信准没事
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal. That letter will do the trick.

708
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:17,019
我得走了 希望他别让她等太久
l must be off. l do hope he doesn't keep her waiting much longer.

709
01:21:17,282 --> 01:21:20,183
真不忍心看她如此难过
lt hurts to see her this way.

710
01:21:22,338 --> 01:21:25,753
爱德华的家人都很欢迎我
What a welcome l had from Edward's family.

711
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:32,127
你大嫂人这么好，你都没说 还有罗伯人也是
You never said how agreeable your sister-in-law is. Robert, also.

712
01:21:32,417 --> 01:21:37,566
幸好他们都不知道你的秘密
It is fortunate that none of them knows of your engagement.

713
01:21:46,113 --> 01:21:52,855
“亲爱的小姐 我完全不清楚有何无礼之处”
''Dear Madam. l am at a loss to see how l might have offended you.''

714
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:58,521
“如果我行为 若有任何误导之嫌”
''lf l have given rise to a belief of more than l meant to express, -

715
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:02,492
“我后悔自己不够谨慎”
- l regret not having been more guarded.''

716
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,402
“我心早有所属”
''My affections are engaged elsewhere.''

717
01:22:05,697 --> 01:22:10,966
“很遗憾得奉还来函 及你相赠之秀发”
''lt is with regret that l return your letters and the lock of hair.''

718
01:22:11,264 --> 01:22:15,355
“谨此，约翰卫乐比”
''l am, et cetera, John Willoughby.''

719
01:22:18,048 --> 01:22:20,568
亲爱的…
Dearest ...

720
01:22:22,752 --> 01:22:30,105
这总比订下婚约许久后 他才反悔得好
lt is better than if your engagement had carried on before he ended it.

721
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,985
我们没有婚约
We're not engaged.

722
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,884
我以为你们有了约定
l thought he left you with some kind of understanding.

723
01:22:38,175 --> 01:22:44,666
-他没你想像中那么坏 -他有没有说他爱你？
- He's not so unworthy as you think. - Did he tell you that he loved you?

724
01:22:44,991 --> 01:22:51,635
有，没有…没明白的说 常有暗示但没明说
Yes. No ... Never absolutely. lt was implied but never declared.

725
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:59,132
有时我以为说了 但却不是，他没违背誓言
Sometimes l thought it had been, but it never was. He broke no vow.

726
01:22:59,422 --> 01:23:02,837
他让我们都以为他爱你
He made us all believe he loved you.

727
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:08,664
他是爱我的！ 他爱我，像我爱他一样
He did! He loved me as l loved him.

728
01:23:11,645 --> 01:23:16,183
我刚刚听说了 你还好吧，玛丽安
l had to come straight up. How are you, Miss Marianne?

729
01:23:16,478 --> 01:23:21,114
可怜，她看来好伤心 也难怪，一点也错不了
Poor thing, she looks very bad. No wonder. for it is but too true.

730
01:23:21,437 --> 01:23:24,600
听莫小姐说…
l was told by Miss Morton, -

731
01:23:24,893 --> 01:23:29,115
他即将迎娶 身价5万镑的盖小姐为妻
- that he is soon to marry a Miss Grey with 50,000!

732
01:23:29,405 --> 01:23:35,699
若是真的 那他就是狼心狗肺的东西
lf true, he is a good-for-nothing who used my young friend ill.

733
01:23:35,997 --> 01:23:40,186
我希望他被老婆折磨一辈子
And l wish with all my soul that his wife might plague all his heart out.

734
01:23:41,756 --> 01:23:45,847
世上又不祗他一个男人
He's not the only young man worth having.

735
01:23:46,108 --> 01:23:50,166
你那么漂亮，还怕没人要吗
With your pretty face you'll never want for admirers.

736
01:23:53,052 --> 01:23:57,873
最好让她发泄一下 哭完就没事了
Better let her have her cry out and have done with it.

737
01:23:58,172 --> 01:24:02,427
我去给她买点东西安慰她
l will go look out something to tempt her.

738
01:24:02,684 --> 01:24:07,735
-她喜不喜欢橄榄？ -我不清楚
- Does she care for olives? - l cannot tell you.

739
01:24:15,036 --> 01:24:17,719
他们显然并无婚约
Apparently, they never were engaged.

740
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:22,069
盖小姐有5万英镑 玛丽安却穷得很
Miss Grey has 50,000. Marianne is virtually penniless.

741
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:27,151
她不能指望人家娶她 但我替玛丽安惋惜
She couldn't expect him to go through with it. But l feel for her.

742
01:24:27,387 --> 01:24:30,201
她会变得憔悴 和爱琳娜一样变成老处女
She will lose her bloom and end a spinster like Elinor.

743
01:24:32,411 --> 01:24:38,291
我们不妨请她们来住几天 毕竟我们是一家人
We might have them to stay for a few days. We are, after all, family.

744
01:24:38,619 --> 01:24:41,106
-何况父亲… -亲爱的…
- And my father ... - My love ...

745
01:24:41,403 --> 01:24:46,640
我非常赞成 但我已经邀请了史小姐
l would ask them with all my heart, but l've already asked Miss Steele.

746
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:50,864
我们不能让詹太太没了伴
And we cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings of all her company.

747
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:54,064
我们可以改年再邀请你妹妹
We can invite your sisters some other year.

748
01:24:54,362 --> 01:24:59,315
史小姐才真的需要招待 可怜的女孩
Miss Steele will profit more from your generosity, poor girl.

749
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:02,391
好主意
Excellent notion.

750
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:08,371
布上校来看您了，戴小姐
Colonel Brandon to see you.

751
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:16,450
- Thank you so much for coming. - How is your sister?

752
01:25:11,578 --> 01:25:16,182
-谢谢你来 -令妹怎么样？

753
01:25:16,473 --> 01:25:23,575
我得尽快送她回家，巴先生可带 我们至他家，离巴顿有一天车程
l must get her home. Palmer can take us to Cleveland, a day from Barton.

754
01:25:23,864 --> 01:25:30,639
-我亲自送你们到回家 -我就希望你能帮忙
- l'll take you to Barton myself. - l confess, that is what l hoped.

755
01:25:31,608 --> 01:25:34,771
玛丽安受了很大的打击
Marianne suffers cruelly.

756
01:25:35,065 --> 01:25:41,775
令我最难过的是 她还替卫乐比辩解
What pains me most is how hard she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.

757
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,501
也许…
Perhaps ...

758
01:25:49,879 --> 01:25:55,595
我能否说明一件事 我是纯粹出自好意…
May l relate some circumstances which only a desire to be useful ...

759
01:25:55,895 --> 01:25:59,473
是有关卫乐比的事？
You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby?

760
01:26:09,078 --> 01:26:12,143
我离开巴顿的时候…
When l quitted Barton last ...

761
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:15,089
不，还要更早
No, l must go further back.

762
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:20,244
毫无疑问…
No doubt ... No doubt ...

763
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:24,620
想必詹太太跟你谈过我的过去
... Mrs. Jennings has appraised you of certain events in my past.

764
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:29,554
我跟伊丽莎交往的不幸结局
The sad outcome of my connection with a young woman named Eliza.

765
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:37,521
大家不知道的是…
What is not commonly known -

766
01:26:37,846 --> 01:26:43,377
20年前 她去世前生下一名私生女
- is that 20 years ago, before she died. Eliza bore a child.

767
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:47,695
孩子的父亲将她们遗弃
The father. whoever he was. abandoned them.

768
01:26:47,989 --> 01:26:53,705
伊丽莎临终前 求我替她照顾小孩
As Eliza lay dying, she begged me to look after the child.

769
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:59,089
我对不起她，此刻哪能拒绝
l had failed her in ever other way, l could not refuse her now.

770
01:26:59,413 --> 01:27:04,366
我把孩子贝丝，带到乡下…
l placed the child, Beth, with a family in the country -

771
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:08,851
请人照顾，我尽可能常去看她
- where l knew she would be looked after. l saw her whenever l could.

772
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:13,101
长大后她脾气非常倔强
She grew up so headstrong, -

773
01:27:13,396 --> 01:27:19,276
上帝原谅我 我太宠她，让她太自由了
- and, God forgive me, l allowed her too much freedom.

774
01:27:19,572 --> 01:27:22,735
约一年前，她失踪了
Almost a year ago she disappeared.

775
01:27:23,028 --> 01:27:28,145
我请人寻找 但八个月来杳无音讯
l instigated a search, but for eight months l imagined the worst.

776
01:27:28,436 --> 01:27:33,072
但在野餐那天 我得到了她的消息
On the day of the Delaford picnic, l received the first news of her.

777
01:27:34,548 --> 01:27:37,679
她…怀孕了
She was ... with child.

778
01:27:38,804 --> 01:27:44,270
那男的离她而去，不知去向
And the blackguard who had left her with no hint of his whereabouts ...

779
01:27:49,203 --> 01:27:51,853
你是指卫乐比？
Do you mean Willoughby?

780
01:27:55,955 --> 01:28:01,551
我还没去找他证实 艾夫人听说后便撵他走
Before l could confront him. Lady Allen had turned him out.

781
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:06,217
-他就跑来伦敦 -他那天没解释就走了
- He fled to London. - He left without any explanation.

782
01:28:06,514 --> 01:28:13,485
他的庄园可能要用来抵债
He risked losing the estate, and the money that remained to his debtors.

783
01:28:14,738 --> 01:28:17,771
所以他舍弃玛丽安
So he abandoned Marianne -

784
01:28:18,065 --> 01:28:21,993
去娶有钱的盖小姐为妻
- for Miss Grey and her 50.000.

785
01:28:24,722 --> 01:28:27,110
贝丝还在城里吗？
ls Beth still in town?

786
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:31,882
她选择回乡下待产
She has chosen to go to the country for her confinement.

787
01:28:38,705 --> 01:28:42,796
我说这些不是要让你难过
l would not burden you, had l not, from my heart, -

788
01:28:43,089 --> 01:28:48,522
祗因为我相信 这或能化解令妹的遗憾
- believed it might, in time, lessen your sister's regrets.

789
01:28:58,096 --> 01:29:03,365
我把卫先生形容得很放荡
l have described Mr. Willoughby as the worst of libertines.

790
01:29:03,664 --> 01:29:08,398
但艾夫人告诉我 他那天的确有意求婚
But l learned from Lady Allen that he did mean to propose that day.

791
01:29:09,648 --> 01:29:16,969
我不能否认他对玛丽安 原本是真心真意的
l cannot deny that his intentions towards Marianne were honourable.

792
01:29:18,928 --> 01:29:22,702
我相信他原本会娶她
l feel certain that he would have married her.

793
01:29:23,951 --> 01:29:27,879
-要不是有… -钱的问题
- Had it not been ... - For the money.

794
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:37,705
-我全说了，这样对吗？ -当然
- Was l right to tell you? - Of course.

795
01:29:40,655 --> 01:29:45,095
不管他过去怎样，今后如何
Whatever his past actions, whatever his present course, -

796
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:49,101
可以确定的是他爱过你
- you may be certain that he loved you.

797
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:52,553
但还不够深
But not enough.

798
01:29:53,551 --> 01:29:55,438
不够深…
Not enough ...

799
01:30:03,054 --> 01:30:06,501
我给你找了个伴
Here is someone to cheer you up.

800
01:30:10,637 --> 01:30:16,387
你妹妹好吗，戴小姐 真可怜
How is your dear sister? Poor thing.

801
01:30:16,686 --> 01:30:21,507
我若给男人这般对待 真不知该怎么办
l do not know what I'd do if a man treated me with so little respect.

802
01:30:21,805 --> 01:30:24,804
你在约翰家住得还好吧？
Are you enjoying your stay with John and Fanny?

803
01:30:25,101 --> 01:30:30,817
我这辈子从来没这么开心过 我想你大嫂喜欢我
l was never so happy in my life. Your sister-in-law has taken to me.

804
01:30:31,117 --> 01:30:35,753
-有件事你一定猜不到 -我是猜不到
- You cannot imagine what happened. - No. l cannot.

805
01:30:36,108 --> 01:30:43,079
昨天我见了爱德华的母亲 她对我不祗客气而已
Yesterday l was introduced to his mother. She was more than civil.

806
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:47,747
我还没见到爱德华 但应该快了
l have not yet seen Edward, but l feel sure to, very soon.

807
01:30:51,852 --> 01:30:55,780
有位爱德华费洛斯找您 戴小姐
There is a Mr. Edward Ferrars to see you.

808
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:03,010
请他进来
Do ask him to come in.

809
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:41,251
真高兴见到你 你一定认识史小姐吧？
What a pleasure to see you. You know Miss Steele. of course.

810
01:31:47,242 --> 01:31:52,937
-你好吗，史小姐？ -我很好，谢谢
- How do you do, Miss Steele? - l am well, thank you.

811
01:31:55,722 --> 01:31:58,885
请坐
Do sit down.

812
01:32:03,785 --> 01:32:09,251
你很意外会在这见到我 你以为我在令姐家吧？
Are you surprised to find me here and not at your sister's house?

813
01:32:11,241 --> 01:32:15,877
我去叫玛丽安 她一定很想见你
Let me fetch Marianne. She would be disappointed to miss you.

814
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,627
爱德华！我听到你的声音
Edward! l heard your voice.

815
01:32:19,913 --> 01:32:26,819
-你终于来了 -我不该这么晚才来拜访
- At last you found us. - My visit is shamefully overdue.

816
01:32:27,049 --> 01:32:33,343
-你脸色好苍白，你生病了？ -别管我，爱琳娜好好的
- You're pale. Are you not well? - Don't think of me. Elinor is well.

817
01:32:33,672 --> 01:32:38,406
-我们该满足了 -还喜欢伦敦吗？
- That is enough for both of us. - How do you enjoy London?

818
01:32:39,656 --> 01:32:45,798
祗有见到你，才有乐趣 对不对，爱琳娜？
The sight of you is all the pleasure it has afforded. ls that not so?

819
01:32:47,879 --> 01:32:52,515
-你怎么现在才来看我们？ -我有事走不开
- Why have you not visited before? - l have been engaged elsewhere.

820
01:32:52,839 --> 01:32:57,595
比跟朋友见面还重要吗？
But what was that when there were such friends to be met?

821
01:32:57,864 --> 01:33:02,206
或许你认为年轻的男人 都不遵守约定
Perhaps you think young men never honour their engagements?

822
01:33:02,503 --> 01:33:07,324
爱德华是我认识 所最不自私的人
Edward is the most incapable of being selfish of anyone l ever saw.

823
01:33:10,215 --> 01:33:16,259
爱德华，怎么不坐 爱琳娜，你叫他坐
Edward, will you not sit? Help me to persuade him.

824
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:28,195
-对不起，我得走了 -你才刚到
- Forgive me. l must take my leave. - You are only just arrived.

825
01:33:28,454 --> 01:33:31,268
我得替芬妮办点急事
l've an urgent commission for Fanny.

826
01:33:32,518 --> 01:33:36,347
那你能送我回令姐家吗？
Perhaps you might escort me back to your sister's house.

827
01:33:39,461 --> 01:33:42,428
这是我的荣幸
lt would be an honour.

828
01:34:00,965 --> 01:34:06,813
-你怎么不留住他？ -他要走，  自然有原因
- Why did you not urge him to stay? - He must have had his reasons.

829
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:13,370
那一定是你太冷淡，换作我 我也会认为你不喜欢我
Yes, your coldness. Were l Edward, l'd assume you didn't care for me.

830
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:23,514
玛丽安那天好可怜 害我不敢结婚
Marianne looked badly. lt makes me fear that l shall never marry.

831
01:34:23,811 --> 01:34:27,106
胡说 你的归宿会比戴家她们都好
Nonsense. You will marry far better than the Dashwood girls.

832
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,743
可是我没有嫁妆
But l have no dowry.

833
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:37,336
你还有其他美德足以弥补
There are other important qualities that you have in abundance.

834
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:42,077
说不定你的婆家 远比你想像的好
lt would not surprise me if you married beyond your expectations.

835
01:34:42,371 --> 01:34:45,786
能那样就好了
Oh, l wish that might be so.

836
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:50,940
是有一个人…
There is a young man ...

837
01:34:51,235 --> 01:34:54,911
他的家境、背景好吗？
ls he of good fortune and breeding?

838
01:34:55,235 --> 01:35:01,726
都很好 但他的家人一定会反对
Of both. But his family would certainly oppose the match.

839
01:35:02,051 --> 01:35:05,346
他们一见到你就一定会赞同的
They will allow it as soon as they see you.

840
01:35:05,602 --> 01:35:08,318
这是天大的秘密
lt is a very great secret.

841
01:35:08,642 --> 01:35:12,253
我谁都没说，深怕被人发现
l've told nobody in the world for fear of discovery.

842
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:19,485
-我这个人最靠得住 -如果我说出来…
- l am the soul of discretion. - lf l dared tell ...

843
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:26,490
我保证，我绝对守口如瓶
l can assure you, l am as silent as the grave.

844
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:36,124
真大胆，敢在太岁头上动土！
Viper in my bosom!

845
01:35:39,521 --> 01:35:42,139
住手！给我滚！
Stop this!

846
01:35:57,216 --> 01:36:04,373
天下大乱了！ 我拿来开玩笑的那位费先生
What a commotion! Edward Ferrars. the one l used to joke you about, -

847
01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:08,217
已经跟史小姐订婚5年了
- is engaged these five years to Lucy Steele.

848
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:16,596
他母亲要求他解除婚约 否则将撤消他的继承权
His mother has demanded he break the engagement or suffer disinheritance.

849
01:36:16,895 --> 01:36:21,880
但他拒绝毁约，他坚持要娶她
But he refuses to break his promise. He has stood by her, -

850
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:26,877
他一毛钱也不要 他妈就把家产给了罗伯
- and is cut off without a penny. She settled it all on Mr. Robert.

851
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:34,388
我要去找露茜 她被你嫂子臭骂了一顿
l must find Lucy. Your sister-in-law drove her to hysteria.

852
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:38,971
这件事你知道多久了？
How long have you known?

853
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:47,224
-詹太太选我们来伦敦那晚 -你为何不告诉我？
- Since Mrs. Jennings invited us. - Why did you not tell me?

854
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:50,550
露茜叫我不要说出去
Lucy told me in confidence.

855
01:36:51,743 --> 01:36:54,393
-我不能食言 -他爱你！
- l could not break my word. - He loves you!

856
01:36:54,686 --> 01:36:59,770
-他试着告诉我露茜的事 -他不能娶她
- He tried to tell me about Lucy. - He cannot marry her.

857
01:37:00,062 --> 01:37:05,495
你要露茜的遭遇比你还惨吗？
Should he treat her worse than Willoughby treated you?

858
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:11,735
-他不能娶自己不爱的人啊！ -他们早有约定
- He can't marry without love. - He promised a long time ago.

859
01:37:12,029 --> 01:37:18,935
他或许有些后悔 但他会很高兴自己信守承诺
He may harbour some regret, but he he will be happy he kept his word.

860
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:23,288
我们希望从别人身上找到幸福
lt is bewitching to think one's happiness depends on one person, -

861
01:37:29,373 --> 01:37:33,169
却未必能够找到，认命吧
- but it is not always possible. We must accept.

862
01:37:33,436 --> 01:37:38,585
爱德华会娶露茜 而你和我就回家
Edward will marry Lucy, and you and l will go home.

863
01:37:38,877 --> 01:37:41,560
你总是听天由命
Always resignation and acceptance.

864
01:37:41,884 --> 01:37:45,331
总是有百般顾虑
Always prudence and honour and duty.

865
01:37:45,564 --> 01:37:48,979
爱琳娜，你的心在哪里？
Elinor, where is your heart?

866
01:37:50,236 --> 01:37:54,229
你怎会了解我的心？ 你知道自己的痛苦
What do you know of my heart, or anything but your own suffering?

867
01:37:54,555 --> 01:37:59,344
这秘密一直闷在我心里 我不能跟任何人说
For weeks this has been pressed on me, when l could not speak of it.

868
01:37:59,644 --> 01:38:05,655
而告诉我的人 就是夺走我希望的人
Forced on me by the person whose prior claims ruined all my hopes.

869
01:38:05,979 --> 01:38:11,859
我听她一再的夸赞 自知和爱德华永无结果
l endured her exaltation, knowing l was divided from Edward forever.

870
01:38:12,123 --> 01:38:15,897
如果我能说的话 你就会明白我的心有多痛
lf not bound to silence. l'd have produced proof of a broken heart.

871
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:50,070
听说你朋友的继承权 被转至他弟弟名下
l have heard your Mr. Ferrars has lost his fortune to his brother.

872
01:38:50,362 --> 01:38:55,577
-这消息正确吗？ -没错
- Have l been rightly informed? - lt is indeed so.

873
01:38:55,866 --> 01:39:01,561
-你认识费先生吗？ -我们未曾见过面
- Are you acquainted with him? - No. we have never met.

874
01:39:03,514 --> 01:39:07,823
但我太清楚那种残酷
But l know only too well the cruelty ...

875
01:39:08,153 --> 01:39:14,317
活生生的拆散一对情侣
... of dividing two young people long attached to one another.

876
01:39:16,664 --> 01:39:22,414
我有个办法 能让他即刻迎娶史小姐
l have a proposal that may allow him to marry Miss Steele immediately.

877
01:39:22,713 --> 01:39:28,244
既然他是你们的好友 我想请你去跟他说
As he is a friend to your family, perhaps you'd mention it to him.

878
01:39:29,496 --> 01:39:35,857
你亲自去说 我想他一定很高兴
l'm sure he'd be delighted to hear it from your own lips.

879
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:40,276
我不这么认为
l think not.

880
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:46,578
他很重面子，这是在说他好
His behaviour has proved him proud. ln the best sense.

881
01:39:48,247 --> 01:39:51,891
我相信这样比较好
l feel certain this is the right course.

882
01:39:57,399 --> 01:40:00,115
爱德华费洛斯先生
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

883
01:40:09,814 --> 01:40:12,683
谢谢你这么快就来
Thank you for responding so quickly.

884
01:40:12,983 --> 01:40:16,278
我很高兴接获你的通知
l was grateful to receive your message.

885
01:40:16,567 --> 01:40:19,283
不知你会怎么想我…
God knows what you must think of me.

886
01:40:19,606 --> 01:40:24,821
-我自知无权多说… -我有好消息
- l have no right to speak ... - l have good news.

887
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:26,964
请坐
Do please sit down.

888
01:40:32,726 --> 01:40:37,875
-你知道布上校吧？ -听说过
- You know of Col. Brandon. - l've heard his name.

889
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:43,980
布上校要我转告你 他知道你想当牧师
Col. Brandon desires me to say, as you wish to join the clergy, -

890
01:40:44,277 --> 01:40:49,295
-便想请你主持他的教区
- that he has pleasure in offering you the parish at Delaford, -

891
01:40:49,589 --> 01:40:54,095
-你和史小姐便可结婚
- in the hope it may enable you and Miss Steele to marry.

892
01:40:55,636 --> 01:40:58,931
-布上校？ -是的
- Col. Brandon? - Yes.

893
01:40:59,157 --> 01:41:05,005
他是想表示对你们困境的关心
He means it as testimony of his concern for this cruel situation.

894
01:41:07,316 --> 01:41:10,731
布上校要我主持教区？
Col. Brandon give me a parish?

895
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:14,672
有可能吗？
Can it be possible?

896
01:41:14,964 --> 01:41:20,680
你不能因为家人的绝情 而拒人于千里之外
You shouldn't be astonished to find friendship outside your family.

897
01:41:22,196 --> 01:41:27,280
不，我不是针对你
No. Not to find it in you.

898
01:41:27,604 --> 01:41:32,142
我知道这一切都是你促成的
l cannot be ignorant that it is certainly to you that l owe this.

899
01:41:32,404 --> 01:41:36,298
我希望我能表达 但我不善言词…
l'd express it if l could, but l am no orator ...

900
01:41:36,563 --> 01:41:42,508
你误会了 这是你自己得来的
You are mistaken. You owe it to your own merit.

901
01:41:46,643 --> 01:41:50,537
布上校的人品一定十分高尚
Col. Brandon must be a man of great worth.

902
01:41:50,835 --> 01:41:54,763
他是世上最好的人
He is the kindest and best of men.

903
01:41:57,299 --> 01:42:02,383
布上校为何不亲自跟我说？
May l ask why the colonel did not tell me himself?

904
01:42:02,642 --> 01:42:06,416
我想他觉得透过朋友比较好
l think he felt it would be better coming from a friend.

905
01:42:12,402 --> 01:42:16,744
你是我一生中最重要的朋友
Your friendship has been the most important in my life.

906
01:42:20,785 --> 01:42:23,632
我永远是你的朋友
You will always have it.

907
01:42:27,026 --> 01:42:30,025
原谅我
Forgive me.

908
01:42:31,249 --> 01:42:36,202
你实践你的承诺 这比什么都重要
You honour your promises. That is more important than anything else.

909
01:42:36,497 --> 01:42:40,686
祝你们幸福美满
l wish you both happiness.

910
01:43:18,831 --> 01:43:22,759
真是幸运 能找到离家近的教区
What luck for them to find a parish so close to Barton.

911
01:43:23,056 --> 01:43:26,950
我们可以常见面
You'll all be able to meet very often.

912
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:31,883
我讨厌死卫乐比了
l've never disliked a person so much as l do Mr. Willoughby.

913
01:43:32,175 --> 01:43:39,212
从我们的小山可以看到 他的房子，我要在山上种大树
We can see his house from the hill! l'll ask Jackson to plant trees.

914
01:43:39,438 --> 01:43:41,859
不可以
You won't.

915
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:47,209
听说盖小姐的婚纱好漂亮…
l hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was everything of the finest ...

916
01:43:57,646 --> 01:44:03,362
班太太 我们快渴死了，快泡茶
Mrs. Bunting! We're in desperate need of tea.

917
01:44:10,765 --> 01:44:15,554
她一路讲，连气都没换 早该另想办法回家
She's not drawn breath since London. Had l only found another way home.

918
01:44:15,854 --> 01:44:21,702
没别的办法 我想走一走，静一下
There was no other way. l'll just take a stroll. A moment's peace.

919
01:44:22,029 --> 01:44:26,600
-好像快下雨了 -不会的
- l think it is going to rain. - No. it will not rain.

920
01:44:26,893 --> 01:44:33,286
-每次你说不会就一定下 -我就在花园里，不会走远
- When you say so, it always does. - l shall keep to the garden.

921
01:44:51,275 --> 01:44:56,839
我们很喜欢这孩子 他爸爸最会逗他
We are very proud of our Thomas. His papa has such a way with him.

922
01:45:10,283 --> 01:45:16,327
你在这儿呀！ 快来看看汤姆士
Oh, there you are. Come and meet little Thomas.

923
01:45:31,754 --> 01:45:34,787
我看不到玛丽安
l cannot see Marianne.

924
01:46:12,009 --> 01:46:18,370
说变心就变心，哪能算是爱
Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds. -

925
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:23,040
哪能任凭抹灭
- or bends with the remover to remove.

926
01:46:23,336 --> 01:46:28,638
不，爱是永不褪色的印记
Oh. no. 'tis an ever fixed mark -

927
01:46:28,968 --> 01:46:33,823
纵使有狂风暴雨 也永不动摇
- that looks on tempests and is never shaken.

928
01:46:34,696 --> 01:46:37,663
卫乐比…
Willoughby ...

929
01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:42,845
卫乐比…
Willoughby ...

930
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:44,965
卫乐比…
Willoughby ...

931
01:46:49,895 --> 01:46:51,520
玛丽安？
Marianne?

932
01:46:51,815 --> 01:46:58,012
-她一定会成落汤鸡 -谢谢你提醒
- She'll be wet through. - Thank you for pointing that out.

933
01:46:58,311 --> 01:47:02,107
放心吧，戴小姐 布莱登会找到她的
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood. Brandon will find her.

934
01:47:02,407 --> 01:47:05,755
我们都猜得出她去哪了
We can all guess where she went.

935
01:47:34,373 --> 01:47:38,595
她没受伤 得快点给她取暖
She's not hurt. but we must get her warm.

936
01:47:39,653 --> 01:47:43,547
我房里生了火，快点
There is a fire lit in my room. Do hurry!

937
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:14,045
我想得帮玛丽安请大夫
l think Marianne may need a doctor.

938
01:48:32,451 --> 01:48:39,073
你会把自己累坏的，上校 别担心，躺一两天就好了
You'll wear yourself out. A day or two in bed will set her to rights.

939
01:48:39,363 --> 01:48:43,999
哈大夫医术很高明，放心吧
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. l've never found a better physician.

940
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:52,572
-是什么问题？ -是一种会传染的热病
- What is the diagnosis? - lt is an infectious fever.

941
01:48:52,867 --> 01:48:58,682
-我建议快将婴儿隔离 -班太太！
- l recommend removing your child. - Mrs. Bunting!

942
01:49:06,562 --> 01:49:11,711
戴小姐…我不知该怎么说
Miss Dashwood ... l am more sorry than l can say.

943
01:49:12,002 --> 01:49:17,915
-你要我留下的话我愿意 -谢谢你的好意
- lf you prefer me to stay l shall. - That is very kind.

944
01:49:18,242 --> 01:49:21,820
但布上校和哈大夫会照顾我们
But Col. Brandon and Dr. Harris will look after us.

945
01:49:22,113 --> 01:49:25,309
谢谢你所做的一切
Thank you for all you have done.

946
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:55,992
她的病情没有好转
She's not doing as well as l would like.

947
01:50:09,695 --> 01:50:12,694
我能做什么？
What can l do?

948
01:50:14,207 --> 01:50:20,218
-你已经帮很多忙了 -给我点事做，不然我会发疯
- You've done so much already. - Anything, or l shall run mad.

949
01:50:20,543 --> 01:50:24,437
家母在会好一些
She would be easier if her mother were here.

950
01:51:07,422 --> 01:51:09,942
我再去拿镇定剂
l must fetch more laudanum.

951
01:51:10,237 --> 01:51:15,899
我不能骗你说 令妹的病情不严重
l cannot pretend that your sister's condition is not very serious.

952
01:51:21,085 --> 01:51:23,540
你要有心里准备
You must prepare yourself.

953
01:51:24,508 --> 01:51:28,020
我马上回来
l will return shortly.

954
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:46,134
玛丽安
Marianne ...

955
01:51:46,428 --> 01:51:49,210
玛丽安，你要振作
Marianne, please try ...

956
01:51:51,612 --> 01:51:54,394
玛丽安…
Marianne ...

957
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:59,864
拜托你振作点…
Please try ...

958
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:15,348
我不能…我不能没有你
l cannot ... l cannot do without you.

959
01:52:23,034 --> 01:52:29,045
别的事我都可设法忍受 我会设法…
l've tried to bear everything else. l will try ...

960
01:52:29,338 --> 01:52:32,949
可是求求你，亲爱的…
But please, dearest ...

961
01:52:37,178 --> 01:52:39,544
亲爱的玛丽安…
... beloved Marianne ...

962
01:52:43,577 --> 01:52:46,642
别丢下我一人
... do not leave me alone.

963
01:53:39,448 --> 01:53:41,717
爱琳娜…
Elinor ...

964
01:54:06,775 --> 01:54:09,327
是我母亲…
My mother ...

965
01:54:17,462 --> 01:54:21,651
她脱离险境了 她脱离险境了
She is out of danger. She is out of danger.

966
01:54:34,005 --> 01:54:37,201
-爱琳娜呢？ -我在这里
- Where is Elinor? - l'm here.

967
01:54:37,525 --> 01:54:40,241
亲爱的，我在这里
Dearest. l am here.

968
01:54:44,501 --> 01:54:47,370
布上校…
Col. Brandon ...

969
01:54:54,325 --> 01:54:57,041
谢谢你
Thank you.

970
01:55:36,115 --> 01:55:41,963
他不如卫乐比潇洒 但亲切稳重得多
He's not so dashing as Willoughby, but he has a pleasing countenance.

971
01:55:43,219 --> 01:55:50,158
我当时总觉得 不喜欢卫乐比的眼神
There was something in Willoughby's eyes at times that l did not like.

972
01:55:53,042 --> 01:55:56,718
“大地毫无消失 依然如故”
''Nor is the earth the lesse. or loseth aught.''

973
01:55:57,074 --> 01:56:04,297
“不论何物，落入海中 终为潮水，流至他处”
''What from one place doth fall is with the tide to another brought.''

974
01:56:05,234 --> 01:56:09,838
“有所失，就有所得”
''For there is nothing lost but may be found ...

975
01:56:11,218 --> 01:56:14,000
只需追求
... if sought.''

976
01:56:18,194 --> 01:56:23,015
-明天再继续好吗？ -不行，我有远行
- Shall we continue tomorrow? - No, for l must away.

977
01:56:23,313 --> 01:56:29,193
-远行？去哪？ -我不能说
- Away? Where? - That l cannot tell you.

978
01:56:29,424 --> 01:56:32,587
这是个秘密
lt is a secret.

979
01:56:35,088 --> 01:56:37,095
你不会去很久吧？
You will not stay away long?

980
01:56:54,735 --> 01:56:57,451
就是那里
There.

981
01:56:58,512 --> 01:57:02,440
我就在那里跌倒 遇见卫乐比的
There l fell. and there l first saw Willoughby.

982
01:57:04,399 --> 01:57:08,773
可怜的卫乐比 没娶你，他会后悔的
Poor Willoughby. He will always regret you.

983
01:57:09,072 --> 01:57:14,287
但娶了我他会满足吗？
Does it follow that. had he chosen me. he would have been content?

984
01:57:14,575 --> 01:57:19,015
纵然有心爱的人但身无分文
He would have had a wife he loved. but no money, -

985
01:57:19,311 --> 01:57:24,907
可能很快会先考虑钱 然后才是爱情
- and might have learned to rank his pocketbook above his heart.

986
01:57:28,623 --> 01:57:32,517
他若有我一半后悔 就够他受的了
lf his regrets are half as painful as mine, he will suffer enough.

987
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:39,078
你拿你的行为跟他比？
Do you compare your conduct with his?

988
01:57:39,374 --> 01:57:46,116
我是跟常理做比较 跟你的行为做比较
l compare it to what it ought to have been. With yours.

989
01:57:58,478 --> 01:58:01,641
牛肉买回来了
l fetched those beef fillets. ma'am.

990
01:58:01,933 --> 01:58:07,715
镇上牛肉比较便宜 是给玛丽安补的
Beef is less expensive in Exeter. Anyway, it's for Marianne.

991
01:58:08,013 --> 01:58:12,136
-镇上人很多吗？ -很多
- Was Exeter crowded? - lt was. ma'am.

992
01:58:12,429 --> 01:58:15,428
白太太又中风了
Miss Pothington has had another stroke.

993
01:58:17,810 --> 01:58:21,810
还有科斯因为酗酒 而被莫小姐开除了
And Miss Murden has turned away Coles for his drunkenness.

994
01:58:21,677 --> 01:58:27,044
费先生结婚了 这你们早已知道
