1
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,803
Your son is arrived from London, Sir.

2
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,812
- Father...
- John...

3
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:28,153
You will see in my will the estate
of Norland was left to me in a way -

4
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:34,576
- that prevents me from dividing it
between my two families.

5
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:42,875
Norland, in its entirety,
is therefore yours by law.

6
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:50,299
And I am happy for you and Fanny.

7
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:57,557
But your stepmother, my wife and
daughters are left only 500 a year.

8
00:01:57,807 --> 00:02:03,855
Barely enough to live on.
Nothing for the girls' dowries.

9
00:02:04,105 --> 00:02:09,652
- You must help them.
- Of course.

10
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:15,283
You must promise to do this.

11
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:20,663
I promise, Father.
I promise.

12
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:23,750
Help them? What do you mean?

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,506
I mean to give them 3,000. The
interest will be an extra income.

14
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:38,513
- The gift will fulfil my promise.
- Without question. More than amply.

15
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:44,770
One had rather, on such occasions,
do too much than too little.

16
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:51,067
Of course, he did not stipulate
a particular sum.

17
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,656
What do you say to 1,500, then?

18
00:02:54,905 --> 00:03:00,368
What brother would be so kind to his
real sisters, let alone half-blood?

19
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:08,251
- They can hardly expect more.
- What can you afford?

20
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:16,718
100 a year to their mother is
better than losing 1,500 at once.

21
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:22,974
Should she live longer than 15 years
we'd be completely taken in.

22
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:29,439
People live forever
when an annuity is to be paid them.

23
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,278
20 now and then will amply
discharge my promise, you're right.

24
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:40,241
I'm convinced that your father
had no idea of giving them money.

25
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:45,955
- They will have 500 a year.
- What more could they want for?

26
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:51,961
No housekeeping, carriage, horses,
few servants, keeping no company...

27
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,464
How comfortable!

28
00:03:54,714 --> 00:04:01,136
They will be much more able
to give "you" something.

29
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:24,410
Marianne,
can you play something else?

30
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,749
Mamma has been weeping
since breakfast.

31
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:42,135
I meant something less mournful.

32
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:48,975
A visitor in my own home!
It is not to be borne, Elinor.

33
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:54,690
- Mamma, we have nowhere to go.
- John and Fanny will be here soon.

34
00:04:54,941 --> 00:05:01,029
Do you expect me to be here
to welcome them? Vultures!

35
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:17,587
I will start making inquiries
for a new house at once.

36
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:23,842
Until then, we must try
to bear their coming.

37
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:31,809
Margaret, are you there? Come down,
John and Fanny will be here soon.

38
00:05:32,143 --> 00:05:36,857
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.

39
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:45,490
Houses go from father to son, not
father to daughter. It is the law.

40
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,538
- Come, we'll play with your atlas.
- It's not mine, it's their atlas.

41
00:05:58,252 --> 00:06:01,338
Do sit down.

42
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:09,263
We are looking for a new home, and
can only retain Thomas and Betsy.

43
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:13,141
We're sorry
to have to leave you all.

44
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:19,565
But we are certain you will find the
new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.

45
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:26,905
My only real concern is how long
it will take them to move out.

46
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:52,180
- How is Mrs. Ferrars?
- She is always in good health.

47
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:57,269
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.

48
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:01,438
He has his own barouche.

49
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:09,822
- You have two brothers?
- Yes. Edward is the elder.

50
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:15,954
He's travelling up from Plymouth
and will break his journey here.

51
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:24,378
- If that is agreeable to you.
- Dear John...

52
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:29,425
This is your home now.

53
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:36,849
- Fanny wants the key to the silver.
- What does Fanny want with it?

54
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,854
One can presume she wants
to count it. What are you doing?

55
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:48,903
Gifts for the servants. Where is
Margaret? She's taken to hiding.

56
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:55,784
- At least she can escape Fanny.
- You've not said a word to her.

57
00:07:56,035 --> 00:08:02,123
I have.
I've said yes and no.

58
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,390
Good morning, Fanny.

59
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:21,476
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

60
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:26,356
How did you find the silver?
Was it all genuine?

61
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:32,278
- When may we expect your brother?
- Edward is due tomorrow.

62
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:39,870
He will not stay long. Will Margaret
give up her room for him?

63
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:48,003
The view is incomparable, and I
want him to see Norland at its best.

64
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,943
Mrs. Dashwood,
Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne.

65
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:17,323
My brother, Edward Ferrars.

66
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:22,369
Do sit down.

67
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:28,376
Where is Miss Margaret? I'm
beginning to doubt of her existence.

68
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:34,423
Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My youngest
is shy of strangers at present.

69
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:42,222
I am shy of strangers myself,
and I have nothing like her excuse.

70
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:47,811
How do you like your view,
Mr. Ferrars?

71
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:53,775
Very much. Your stables are handsome
and beautifully kept.

72
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:57,320
Stables?
Your windows overlook the lake.

73
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:03,785
An error led me to a family room,
but I've rectified the situation.

74
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:08,665
I am happily installed
in the guest quarters.

75
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:12,126
Tea!

76
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:18,758
They're all spoilt. Miss Margaret is
always up trees and under furniture.

77
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:22,554
I've barely had a civil word
from Marianne.

78
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:29,310
They've just lost their father.
Their lives will never be the same.

79
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:34,357
That is no excuse.

80
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,945
Library.

81
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:46,161
- These are mostly foreign.
- Indeed. Magnificent.

82
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:50,122
I've never liked the smell of books.

83
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:56,088
The dust, perhaps. I hear you have
great plans for the walnut grove.

84
00:10:56,337 --> 00:11:01,217
I shall have it knocked down
to make place for a Grecian temple.

85
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:08,641
That does sound interesting.
Would you show me the site?

86
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:18,901
Too expensive, and we do not need
four bedrooms. We can share.

87
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:21,320
This one, then.

88
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,157
We have only 500 a year.

89
00:11:25,406 --> 00:11:30,161
I'll send out more inquiries today.

90
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:40,964
Pardon my intrusion, but I think I
have found what you're looking for.

91
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:52,934
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.

92
00:11:53,184 --> 00:12:02,485
We'll have to enlarge it. Mattocks
will help you adjust to our hours.

93
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:11,703
Forgive me, do you by any chance
have a reliable atlas?

94
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:17,000
- I believe so.
- I must check the Nile's position.

95
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:21,588
My sister tells me
it is in South America.

96
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:28,511
No!
No, she's quite wrong.

97
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:32,849
I believe it is in Belgium.

98
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:37,103
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.

99
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:42,566
- The Volga, which starts in...
- In Vladivostok, and ends in...

100
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:46,779
- Wimbledon.
- Yes, where coffee beans come from.

101
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,575
The source of the Nile
is in Abyssinia.

102
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:55,453
Is it? Interesting.

103
00:12:55,704 --> 00:13:01,502
- How do you do? Edward Ferrars.
- Margaret Dashwood.

104
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:06,966
It adjoins this property,
and would be a desirable addition.

105
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:12,554
- I'll ride there and speak to...
- Gibson.

106
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:21,563
- He'll be pleased enough to sell.
- He'll want more than it is worth.

107
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,220
Have I hurt you?

108
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:58,826
Thank you.
Forgive me.

109
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:03,789
That was my father's favourite.

110
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:10,921
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.

111
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:14,090
I enjoy her company.

112
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:18,470
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.

113
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,808
Would you do me the honour,
Miss Dashwood?

114
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:30,148
- It is very fine out.
- With pleasure.

115
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:35,528
- Margaret always wanted to travel.
- I know. She's off to China soon.

116
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,701
I'm to go as her servant, on the
understanding I'll be badly treated.

117
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:48,417
- What will your duties be?
- Sword fighting and swabbing.

118
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:52,962
Which will take precedence?

119
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:05,558
All I have ever wanted
is the quiet of a private life.

120
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:10,730
But my mother is determined
to see me distinguished.

121
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:18,113
Orator. Politician. Even a barrister
would do, if I drove a barouche.

122
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:21,240
What do "you" wish for?

123
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,203
I prefer the church, but that is not
smart enough for my mother.

124
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:30,999
She prefers the army,
but that is too smart for me.

125
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,087
- Would you stay in London?
- I hate London.

126
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:40,634
Country living is my ideal. A small
parish where I might do some good.

127
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:46,597
Keep chickens...
Give very short sermons.

128
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:53,772
You feel idle and useless.
Imagine how that is compounded -

129
00:16:54,022 --> 00:17:00,946
- when one has no choice
of any occupation whatsoever.

130
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:05,158
Our circumstances are therefore
precisely the same.

131
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:10,706
Except that you will inherit
your fortune.

132
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:15,043
We cannot even earn ours.

133
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:22,675
Perhaps Margaret is right.
Piracy is our only option.

134
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,887
What is swabbing exactly?

135
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:31,434
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

136
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:37,106
"When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

137
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:42,653
"But I, beneath a rougher sea, and
whelmed in deeper gulfs than he..."

138
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:44,905
No, Edward.

139
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:49,619
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

140
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:54,373
"When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

141
00:17:54,623 --> 00:18:01,130
Can you not feel his despair?
Try again.

142
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,098
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

143
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:18,398
"When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

144
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:24,278
Mamma...

145
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:29,282
Look.
This has just arrived.

146
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:34,871
"I should be pleased to offer you a
home at Barton Cottage, as soon..."

147
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:39,418
- It's from Sir John Middleton.
- Even Elinor must approve the rent.

148
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:43,964
- Has she not yet seen this?
- No. I will fetch her.

149
00:18:44,214 --> 00:18:47,258
Wait, let us delay.

150
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:53,473
I believe that Edward and Elinor
have formed an attachment.

151
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:58,771
It would be cruel to take her away
so soon. Devonshire is so far.

152
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,525
- Do you disapprove her choice?
- By no means.

153
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:09,531
- Edward is very amiable.
- Amiable? But...?

154
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:15,244
There is something wanting.
He is too sedate. His reading...

155
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:18,790
Elinor has not your feelings.

156
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,295
Can he love her? Can the soul
be satisfied with polite affections?

157
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:30,301
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet, Guinevere, Heloise.

158
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:36,223
- They made rather pathetic ends.
- Pathetic? To die for love?

159
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:42,981
- What could be more glorious?
- Your romantic sensibilities...

160
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:55,408
"Is love a fancy or a feeling? No,
it is immortal as immaculate truth."

161
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:59,705
"'Tis not a blossom shed
when youth drops from life's stem."

162
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:09,048
"It grows without water, nor ray of
promise cheats the pensive gloom."

163
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:12,551
A pity
Edward has no passion for reading.

164
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:18,974
"You" asked him to read,
then you made him nervous.

165
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:26,106
Your behaviour is cordial. You
like him in spite of his reading.

166
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:33,446
I think him everything
that is amiable and worthy.

167
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:36,532
Praise, indeed.

168
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:41,872
He shall have my devotion when
you tell me he is to be my brother.

169
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:46,501
- What shall I do without you?
- Without me?

170
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,757
I'm sure you will be very happy,
but promise you won't live far away.

171
00:20:53,007 --> 00:21:01,599
- There is no question of...
- Do you love him?

172
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:08,940
I do not deny that I think
very highly of him. That I...

173
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:14,070
...greatly esteem him.
I like him.

174
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,577
Esteem? Like? Use these words again
and I shall leave the room!

175
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:29,418
Believe my feelings to be stronger.
Further than that, do not believe.

176
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:32,629
Is love a fancy or a feeling?

177
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,843
- Or a Ferrars?
- Go to bed.

178
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:43,349
"I do not deny
that I think very highly of him."

179
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:48,896
"That I... greatly esteem him."

180
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:54,526
"That I like him."

181
00:22:11,293 --> 00:22:15,880
We are so happy
that you invited Edward to Norland.

182
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:19,385
We're all very fond of him.

183
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:26,140
We have great hopes for him.
Mother expects much of him.

184
00:22:26,391 --> 00:22:32,397
"And" in marriage. She's determined
both he and Robert will marry well.

185
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:36,692
But I hope she desires them
to marry for love.

186
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:44,617
The heart doesn't always lead us
in the most suitable direction.

187
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:52,458
Edward is a compassionate person.
Penniless women prey on that type.

188
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:59,924
Having entered into an understanding
he would never go back on his word.

189
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:03,427
But it would lead to his ruin.

190
00:23:03,678 --> 00:23:09,350
I'm worried. Mother will withdraw
all financial support from him -

191
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:17,024
- should he plant affection in less
exalted ground than he deserves.

192
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:22,739
I understand you perfectly.

193
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:27,325
Devonshire?

194
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:33,374
My cousin, Sir John Middleton,
has offered us a small house.

195
00:23:33,623 --> 00:23:36,209
He must be a man of property.

196
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,674
He's a widower from Barton Park.
It is Barton Cottage he has offered.

197
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:46,803
A cottage? Charming.
A cottage is always very snug.

198
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:51,058
You will not leave
before the summer?

199
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:56,063
We can no longer trespass
upon your sister's goodwill.

200
00:23:56,312 --> 00:24:00,609
- You will come and stay with us.
- I should like that.

201
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:04,029
Edward has long been expected
by our mother.

202
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:12,412
Come as soon as you can, Edward.
Remember, you're always welcome.

203
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:42,692
- Can't you take him with you?
- We can't afford him.

204
00:24:42,942 --> 00:24:50,366
Perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen... Forgive me.

205
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,914
Miss Dashwood...

206
00:24:57,248 --> 00:25:03,921
Elinor... I must speak to you.

207
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:12,513
There is something of
great importance that I need to...

208
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:19,728
...tell you...
about my education.

209
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:25,650
- Your education?
- Yes.

210
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:33,450
It was conducted,
oddly enough, in Plymouth.

211
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:39,164
- Do you know it?
- Plymouth? No.

212
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:43,752
I was four years there.

213
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:50,175
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.

214
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:57,306
- Pratt?
- Precisely. Pratt.

215
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,435
While I was there...

216
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:06,066
That is to say, he had a...
has a...

217
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,821
You're needed in London
this instant.

218
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:19,787
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Mamma wishes you to leave at once.

219
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:26,376
Excuse me.

220
00:26:54,946 --> 00:27:00,034
Edward promised
he would bring the atlas to Barton.

221
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:05,332
I'll wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight.

222
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:10,421
Dear Edward...

223
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:33,693
Hello there!

224
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:42,368
Sir John...

225
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:54,130
Dear ladies!
Upon my word! Here you are!

226
00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:00,260
- Sir John, your kindness...
- None of that! Hush, please!

227
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,265
Here is my dear mamma-in-law,
Mrs. Jennings.

228
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:10,521
You must be Mrs. Dashwood. Was
your journey tolerable? Poor souls!

229
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,066
Why did you not
come up to the park first?

230
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:19,196
- We saw you pass.
- I made John call the carriage.

231
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:24,076
- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.

232
00:28:24,326 --> 00:28:30,081
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!

233
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:36,255
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John, we cannot...

234
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:43,262
No refusals! I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!

235
00:28:43,512 --> 00:28:48,892
Let us settle in.
But thank you very much.

236
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:17,671
Send your man up for the carriage
as soon as you're ready. Goodbye.

237
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,511
Don't thank us.

238
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:46,324
Your feet are cold.

239
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:13,934
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.

240
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:20,523
It's cold. I'm cold.

241
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:32,829
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.

242
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:37,666
Col. Brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county.

243
00:30:37,915 --> 00:30:44,089
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.

244
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:49,093
But I dare say she's left her heart
behind in Sussex.

245
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:54,474
I see you, Miss Marianne! I think
I've unearthed a secret.

246
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:59,896
You are worse than my best pointer.

247
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:06,236
Is he a butcher, baker, candlestick
maker? I'll winkle it out of you.

248
00:31:06,485 --> 00:31:12,909
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.

249
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,580
Or if we do,
we do not keep them long.

250
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,460
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

251
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:27,757
- Give us a clue. Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.

252
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:31,176
He's a gentleman?

253
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:40,519
- You know there is no such person.
- There is. His name begins with F.

254
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:45,431
F? A promising letter.

255
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:50,904
Foster?
Forrest? Fotheringay? Featherty?

256
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:54,825
- Fortescue?
- Fondant?

257
00:31:55,075 --> 00:32:00,330
Might I play your pianoforte?

258
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:04,001
Yes, of course.

259
00:32:04,251 --> 00:32:09,298
- We don't stand on ceremony here.
- Please forgive...

260
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:16,054
I cannot remember when we last
had a song in the house.

261
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,053
Brandon! Come and meet
our beautiful new neighbours.

262
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:46,060
What a pity you're late.
You have not heard our songbird.

263
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:48,562
A great pity.

264
00:33:48,812 --> 00:33:53,651
This is my good friend Col. Brandon.
We served in the East Indies.

265
00:33:53,901 --> 00:34:00,115
- Not a better fellow in the world.
- You've been to the East Indies?

266
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:03,702
- What's it like?
- Hot.

267
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:09,415
The air is full of spices.

268
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:14,421
Now, Miss Dashwood,
it's your turn to entertain us.

269
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:19,259
And I believe I know
what key you will sing in.

270
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:24,639
F-major...

271
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:39,820
You have no right to parade
your ignorant assumptions...

272
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:44,743
- You told me.
- I told you nothing.

273
00:34:44,993 --> 00:34:49,497
- They'll meet him when he comes.
- You don't speak of such things.

274
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:53,835
- Everyone else was.
- Mrs. Jennings is not "everyone".

275
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:59,131
I like her. She talks about things.
We never talk about things.

276
00:34:59,382 --> 00:35:08,724
If you can say nothing appropriate,
limit your remarks to the weather.

277
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:17,483
Surely they have enough reeds
for a Moses basket.

278
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,186
You know what they're saying?

279
00:35:55,437 --> 00:36:03,028
Word is, you've developed a taste
for certain company. And why not?

280
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:08,283
A man like you in his prime...
She'd be a fortunate young lady.

281
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:12,996
Marianne Dashwood would
no more think of me than of you.

282
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:20,961
- Don't think of yourself so meanly.
- And all the better for her.

283
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:49,824
Besotted... An excellent match.

284
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:54,579
- He's rich and she's handsome.
- How long have you known him?

285
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:59,917
As long as I've been here,
and I came 15 years back.

286
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:05,256
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.

287
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:11,303
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.

288
00:37:11,553 --> 00:37:17,601
He loved a ward to the family.
They were not permitted to marry.

289
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:21,438
- On what grounds?
- Eliza was poor.

290
00:37:21,688 --> 00:37:27,027
She was flung out of the house,
and he was packed off to the army.

291
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:31,447
I think he'd have done himself harm
if not for John.

292
00:37:31,698 --> 00:37:36,704
- What became of the lady?
- She was passed from man to man.

293
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:40,456
She disappeared from good society.

294
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:44,670
When Brandon returned from India
he searched and searched, -

295
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,090
- only to find her dying
in a poorhouse.

296
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:54,388
I thought my daughter Charlotte
might have cheered him up.

297
00:37:54,637 --> 00:38:02,102
Look at him now!
So attentive!

298
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:07,734
- I should try a little experiment.
- Please, let the colonel alone.

299
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:12,154
All suitors need a little help.

300
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:19,954
- We haven't heard you play of late.
- You have a superior musician here.

301
00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:27,754
Brandon shares your passion for
music. He plays the pianoforte well.

302
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:34,344
You know as many melancholy tunes
as Miss Marianne.

303
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:39,973
You must play us a duet.
Let us see you both side by side.

304
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:47,064
I do not know any duets.
Forgive me, Colonel.

305
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:57,450
Will we never have peace? The rent
is low, but it comes on hard terms.

306
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:02,496
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but
marry off everyone else's daughters.

307
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:05,165
There's a parcel arrived.

308
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:10,087
Look!

309
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:17,386
When is a man safe from such wit,
if infirmity does not protect him?

310
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:21,765
If he is infirm,
then I am at death's door.

311
00:39:22,014 --> 00:39:30,482
- He complained of rheumatism.
- "A slight ache" was his phrase.

312
00:39:32,983 --> 00:39:38,448
Edward said
he would bring it himself.

313
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:46,081
"It gives me great pleasure to
restore this atlas to its owner."

314
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:52,378
"Business prevents my delivering it,
which will hurt me more than you."

315
00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:57,175
"Memories of your kindness must
sustain me, and I remain -

316
00:39:57,425 --> 00:40:01,512
- your devoted servant,
E.C. Ferrars."

317
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:07,644
- Why hasn't he come?
- He says he's busy, dear.

318
00:40:07,894 --> 00:40:12,773
- He said he'd come. Why hasn't he?
- I'm taking you for a walk.

319
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:19,530
- It is going to rain.
- It is not going to rain.

320
00:40:19,613 --> 00:40:26,203
I fear
Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.

321
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:36,714
- You must miss him, Elinor.
- We are not engaged, Mamma.

322
00:40:36,964 --> 00:40:43,011
- But he loves you, dearest.
- I am by no means assured of that.

323
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:49,476
And had he such a preference,
there would certainly be obstacles -

324
00:40:49,726 --> 00:40:54,022
- to his marrying a woman of no rank
who cannot afford to buy sugar.

325
00:40:54,273 --> 00:41:01,487
- But your heart must tell you...
- It is better to use one's head.

326
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:13,583
- It can't be good for me.
- It is. Stop complaining.

327
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:18,671
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.

328
00:41:18,922 --> 00:41:23,842
It's lovely. Come on, catch up!

329
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:31,809
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.

330
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:40,526
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.

331
00:41:40,777 --> 00:41:46,616
- Blue sky! Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.

332
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:55,917
Are you hurt?

333
00:41:56,167 --> 00:42:05,051
- I cannot walk. Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.

334
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:18,689
Margaret!

335
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:28,865
Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.

336
00:42:31,368 --> 00:42:35,539
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.

337
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:42,379
May I have your permission to
ascertain if there are any breaks?

338
00:42:58,978 --> 00:43:02,774
It is not broken.

339
00:43:03,024 --> 00:43:08,070
Can you put your arm about my neck?

340
00:43:08,738 --> 00:43:14,326
Allow me to escort you home.

341
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,581
At last!

342
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:24,086
She fell down and he's carrying her!

343
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:27,382
Marianne, are you hurt?

344
00:43:27,632 --> 00:43:31,219
It's a twisted ankle.

345
00:43:31,468 --> 00:43:35,390
It's not serious.
I felt the bone, and it's sound.

346
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,519
- I cannot begin to thank you.
- Do not think of it.

347
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:45,441
- Will you not be seated?
- I'd leave a water mark.

348
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:52,740
- But permit me to call tomorrow.
- We shall look forward to it.

349
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,077
I'll show you out.

350
00:43:56,327 --> 00:44:01,206
Margaret, get the gentleman's hat.

351
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:07,504
- His name!
- To whom are we so much obliged?

352
00:44:07,755 --> 00:44:11,175
John Willoughby of Allenham
at your service.

353
00:44:11,424 --> 00:44:16,221
John Willoughby of Allenham...

354
00:44:16,472 --> 00:44:19,599
What an impressive gentleman!

355
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:24,395
He lifted me as if I weighed no more
than a dried leaf.

356
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:29,651
- Tell me if I hurt you.
- She feels no pain, Mamma.

357
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:33,905
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up
a cold compress.

358
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:37,493
Please don't say anything important.

359
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:43,164
- He expressed himself well.
- With decorum and honour.

360
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:48,837
- And spirit and wit and feeling.
- And economy. Ten words at most.

361
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:52,924
- Change, or you'll catch a cold.
- What care I for colds?

362
00:44:53,174 --> 00:45:00,223
- You'll care when your nose swells.
- You're right. Help me.

363
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,354
He's worth catching. Marianne must
not have all the men to herself.

364
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:13,235
- But what do you know of him?
- There's not a bolder rider.

365
00:45:13,486 --> 00:45:19,992
But what are his tastes,
his passions, his pursuits?

366
00:45:22,411 --> 00:45:28,835
- He has a smart little pointer...
- Where is Allenham?

367
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:34,673
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.

368
00:45:34,923 --> 00:45:39,845
Lady Allen is the name.

369
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:49,062
It's Col. Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.

370
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:56,571
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.

371
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,157
Come in.

372
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:04,160
Good morning, Brandon.

373
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:10,042
- How is the invalid?
- Thank you so much, Colonel.

374
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:16,966
Why set your cap at Willoughby when
you've already made such a conquest?

375
00:46:17,215 --> 00:46:20,260
I'll not set my cap at anyone.

376
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:27,288
- Lady Allen's nephew?
- He visits, for he's to inherit.

377
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:34,064
He has a pretty estate of his own.
Combe Magna in Somerset.

378
00:46:34,315 --> 00:46:41,864
I'd not give him up to a younger
sister for tumbling down hills.

379
00:46:42,741 --> 00:46:50,290
The man himself. Come, Brandon.
We know when we are not wanted.

380
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:55,002
Thank you so much for calling.

381
00:46:55,252 --> 00:46:58,673
Marianne, the colonel and Sir John
are leaving.

382
00:46:58,923 --> 00:47:03,970
Goodbye.
Thank you for the flowers.

383
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:21,111
- How do you do, Colonel?
- How do "you" do, more like.

384
00:47:36,627 --> 00:47:42,841
- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!
- The pleasure is all mine.

385
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:48,264
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
- You've found out my name.

386
00:47:48,513 --> 00:47:54,102
The area is crawling with my spies.
You cannot venture out to nature...

387
00:47:54,352 --> 00:47:59,150
- So nature must be brought to you.
- How beautiful.

388
00:47:59,399 --> 00:48:06,406
- These are not from the hothouse.
- Mine is not the first offering.

389
00:48:06,657 --> 00:48:13,454
- They come from an obliging field.
- I always prefer wild flowers.

390
00:48:13,705 --> 00:48:18,251
- Would you...?
- Our gratitude is beyond words.

391
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:26,384
I've grieved for this lonely house.
Then I heard it was taken.

392
00:48:26,635 --> 00:48:32,806
I felt an interest which nothing can
account for but my present delight.

393
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:36,353
Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby.

394
00:48:36,603 --> 00:48:42,264
Who is reading
Shakespeare's sonnets?

395
00:48:42,316 --> 00:48:45,861
- Marianne is reading them out.
- And which are your favourites?

396
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:49,240
Mine is 116.

397
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:53,578
"Let me not to the marriage
of true minds admit impediments."

398
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:57,499
"Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds, -

399
00:48:57,748 --> 00:49:01,793
- or bends with the remover
to remove..."

400
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:06,757
- How does it continue?
- "No, it is an ever fixed mark..."

401
00:49:07,008 --> 00:49:14,670
- "That looks on tempests..."
- Is it "tempests"?

402
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:23,148
It's strange you are reading these.
I carry them with me always.

403
00:49:30,322 --> 00:49:35,535
Until tomorrow then...

404
00:49:36,578 --> 00:49:41,666
My pocket sonnets are yours.
A talisman against further injury.

405
00:49:41,917 --> 00:49:46,003
Goodbye. Thank you.

406
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:56,682
Good work, Marianne. You covered
Shakespeare, Scott, poetry.

407
00:49:56,932 --> 00:50:03,229
When you know his views on romance,
you'll have nothing left to talk of.

408
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:09,236
I suppose I erred against decorum.
I should have talked of the weather.

409
00:50:09,485 --> 00:50:13,822
Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt
of your enthusiasm for him.

410
00:50:14,073 --> 00:50:16,993
Should I hide my regard?

411
00:50:17,243 --> 00:50:23,291
- No, but we know so little of him.
- Time does not determine intimacy.

412
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:28,463
Seven years is too little for some,
seven days is enough for others.

413
00:50:28,713 --> 00:50:33,342
- Or seven hours, in this case.
- I feel I know him already.

414
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:38,806
Had I more shallow feelings, I could
perhaps conceal them as you do.

415
00:50:39,057 --> 00:50:45,312
- I'm sorry...
- Don't trouble yourself, Marianne.

416
00:50:46,856 --> 00:50:51,443
I do not understand her.

417
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:22,755
Marianne...

418
00:51:22,807 --> 00:51:29,731
- Haven't you finished yet?
- No. Patience.

419
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:43,620
You're not going to deny us
beef as well as sugar?

420
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:48,792
- There is nothing under ten pence.
- Do you want us to starve?

421
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:54,631
No.
Just not to eat beef.

422
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,134
If my behaviour was improper,
I should be sensible of it.

423
00:52:40,385 --> 00:52:47,016
It has caused impertinent remarks.
Do you not doubt your discretion?

424
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:53,855
If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove
impropriety, we are all offending.

425
00:52:54,106 --> 00:52:58,235
Good morning, Colonel.

426
00:52:58,486 --> 00:53:06,368
Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne,
I come to issue an invitation.

427
00:53:07,995 --> 00:53:12,124
A picnic on my estate
at Delaford.

428
00:53:12,374 --> 00:53:16,961
If you would care to join us
on Thursday next.

429
00:53:17,213 --> 00:53:23,760
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband
are travelling up especially.

430
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:27,973
We should be delighted, Colonel.

431
00:53:28,223 --> 00:53:33,061
I will, of course, be including
Mr. Willoughby in the party.

432
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:39,025
I should be delighted to join you.

433
00:53:41,277 --> 00:53:45,281
Good morning, Miss Dashwood.
Good morning, Colonel.

434
00:53:45,531 --> 00:53:48,660
The colonel has invited us
to Delaford.

435
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:54,582
- I hear you have a fine pianoforte.
- A Broadwood Grand.

436
00:53:54,832 --> 00:54:01,881
- Then I shall play for you all.
- We shall look forward to it.

437
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:20,816
- Your sister seems very happy.
- She does not hide her emotions.

438
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:26,613
Her romantic prejudices
tend to set propriety at naught.

439
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:32,369
- She is wholly unspoilt.
- Rather too unspoilt.

440
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:39,459
The sooner she is acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.

441
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:46,633
I knew a lady with the same
sweetness of temper -

442
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:52,473
- who was forced into a
better acquaintance with the world.

443
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:58,312
The result was only
ruination and despair.

444
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:04,400
Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.

445
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:09,948
Col. Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

446
00:55:10,198 --> 00:55:14,452
Mind the pretty ribbons.

447
00:55:14,952 --> 00:55:20,375
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte
and her master appeared with Lucy.

448
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:23,586
The last person I expected to see.

449
00:55:23,837 --> 00:55:28,800
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.

450
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:32,678
I'd not seen you for so long.

451
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:36,932
You sly thing! It was the Dashwoods
she wanted to see.

452
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:41,771
I've heard nothing but "Dashwood"
for I don't know how long.

453
00:55:42,021 --> 00:55:47,985
What do you think of them? My mother
wrote of little else in her letters.

454
00:55:48,236 --> 00:55:52,322
- Are they not as she described?
- Nothing like.

455
00:55:52,573 --> 00:55:55,618
You are quite rude today.

456
00:55:55,868 --> 00:56:01,999
He's to be an MP, and he is forced
to make everybody like him.

457
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:08,172
- I said nothing so irrational.
- Mr. Palmer's so droll.

458
00:56:08,423 --> 00:56:14,762
Here he comes!
Now you shall see, Charlotte.

459
00:56:19,683 --> 00:56:22,477
Hello, Mr. Willoughby!

460
00:56:22,728 --> 00:56:26,940
You must meet my daughter Charlotte,
and Mr. Palmer.

461
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:35,615
- And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.
- Welcome to our party.

462
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:42,581
May I sit beside you?

463
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:47,793
I've longed to meet you. I've heard
nothing but praise for you.

464
00:56:48,045 --> 00:56:54,676
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are
too excessive in their compliments.

465
00:56:54,926 --> 00:57:01,099
The praise came from another source.
One not inclined to exaggeration.

466
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:05,645
What can this be?

467
00:57:14,737 --> 00:57:19,701
Is Col. Brandon here?

468
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:30,003
- My horse!
- What's the matter?

469
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:34,257
- I must away to London.
- Impossible!

470
00:57:34,506 --> 00:57:40,138
We can't picnic without our host.
Come up to town tomorrow.

471
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:46,852
- Or wait until we return.
- I can't afford to lose one minute.

472
00:57:47,103 --> 00:57:51,941
- Forgive me.
- I hope it's nothing serious.

473
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:58,155
Upon my soul,
this is all very unusual.

474
00:57:58,405 --> 00:58:04,911
- Frailty, thy name is Brandon.
- Some cannot bear pleasure.

475
00:58:05,162 --> 00:58:09,542
You are a wicked pair.
Col. Brandon will be missed.

476
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:16,590
Why? Everyone speaks well of him,
but no one remembers to talk to him.

477
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:20,428
Nonsense. He is highly respected
at Barton Park.

478
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:25,557
- Which is enough censure in itself.
- Really, Willoughby.

479
00:58:25,807 --> 00:58:30,646
Come, come, Mr. Impudence.
I know your wicked ways.

480
00:58:30,895 --> 00:58:37,485
Reveal your beau. No secrets between
friends. I'll winkle it out of you.

481
00:58:37,735 --> 00:58:45,034
I'll have you married to the colonel
by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet.

482
00:58:45,284 --> 00:58:51,707
- As if you could marry him.
- Why should you dislike him?

483
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:56,129
Because he threatened me with rain
when I wanted it fine.

484
00:58:56,378 --> 00:59:02,593
He found fault with my high flyer
and will not buy my brown mare.

485
00:59:02,844 --> 00:59:06,221
If it will be
of satisfaction to you, -

486
00:59:06,472 --> 00:59:11,394
- I believe his character to be, in
all other respects, irreproachable.

487
00:59:11,644 --> 00:59:17,149
In return for this acknowledgement,
don't deny me the privilege -

488
00:59:17,399 --> 00:59:23,573
- of disliking him
as much as I adore...

489
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:29,620
...this cottage.

490
00:59:29,871 --> 00:59:36,168
- I have plans for improvements.
- That, I will never consent to.

491
00:59:36,418 --> 00:59:40,589
Not a stone must be added
to its walls.

492
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:45,969
Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild
Combe Magna to this exact image.

493
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:52,726
- With a fire that smokes?
- Especially the fire that smokes.

494
00:59:52,976 --> 00:59:57,940
Then I'd be as happy at Combe
as I've been at Barton.

495
00:59:58,189 --> 01:00:03,862
But this place has one claim on
my affections none other can share.

496
01:00:04,112 --> 01:00:08,993
Promise never to change it.

497
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:19,377
I'm honoured you risk your honour by
seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

498
01:00:19,628 --> 01:00:25,050
- That is what Elinor would say.
- And she would be right.

499
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:30,722
Miss Marianne, will you grant me
an interview tomorrow... alone?

500
01:00:30,972 --> 01:00:35,476
- Willoughby, we are always alone.
- But there is...

501
01:00:35,727 --> 01:00:39,857
There is something very particular
I should like to ask you.

502
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:46,988
Of course. I shall ask Mamma
if I may stay behind from church.

503
01:00:47,237 --> 01:00:50,366
Thank you.

504
01:00:50,617 --> 01:00:55,829
Until tomorrow, then.

505
01:01:08,175 --> 01:01:10,344
Oh, Virtue...

506
01:01:10,595 --> 01:01:16,641
Silently and with fear, enter the
hearts of all that hear me this day.

507
01:01:16,892 --> 01:01:20,938
Will he kneel down when he asks her?

508
01:01:21,188 --> 01:01:26,151
They always kneel down.

509
01:01:37,954 --> 01:01:41,125
What is wrong, dearest?

510
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:46,088
Willoughby?
What is the matter?

511
01:01:46,337 --> 01:01:51,092
Forgive me...
I am sent...

512
01:01:51,343 --> 01:01:56,681
Lady Allen exercised the privilege
of riches upon a dependent cousin.

513
01:01:56,931 --> 01:02:02,729
- She is sending me to London.
- This morning?

514
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:08,651
What a disappointment. Your business
won't detain you for long, I hope?

515
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:14,907
You are kind, but I have no idea of
returning immediately to Devonshire.

516
01:02:15,158 --> 01:02:22,665
- I am invited only once a year.
- Can you wait for our invitation?

517
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:31,007
My engagements are of such a
nature... I dare not flatter my...

518
01:02:31,257 --> 01:02:36,470
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.

519
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:39,640
Willoughby, come back!

520
01:02:39,891 --> 01:02:44,145
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea
for Marianne.

521
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:51,945
- What is wrong, my love?
- Do not ask me questions.

522
01:02:56,657 --> 01:03:01,954
- They must have quarrelled.
- That is unlikely.

523
01:03:02,204 --> 01:03:07,459
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves
of his regard for Marianne.

524
01:03:07,709 --> 01:03:12,589
- An excuse to send him away.
- Then why did he not say so?

525
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,260
- It's not like him to be secretive.
- What do you suspect?

526
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:24,810
- Why was his manner so guilty?
- You think he's been acting a part?

527
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:29,689
- No. He loves her. I am sure.
- Of course!

528
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:33,861
Has he left her any assurance
of his return?

529
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,738
Ask if he proposed.

530
01:03:36,988 --> 01:03:42,119
No! I cannot force a confidence
from Marianne. Neither should you.

531
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:47,331
We must trust her to confide in us
in her own time.

532
01:03:47,582 --> 01:03:51,211
There was something underhand
in his manner.

533
01:03:51,462 --> 01:03:54,005
You "will" think the worst of him.

534
01:03:54,256 --> 01:04:00,178
I give him the benefit of my
good opinion. He deserves no less.

535
01:04:00,429 --> 01:04:03,181
I am very fond of Willoughby.

536
01:04:03,431 --> 01:04:08,394
Mamma... Mamma!

537
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:16,527
She would not let me in.

538
01:04:59,402 --> 01:05:05,784
- If only this rain would stop.
- If only "you" would stop.

539
01:05:06,034 --> 01:05:11,165
'Twas you took her off my hands,
Mr. Palmer. A good bargain, too.

540
01:05:11,415 --> 01:05:18,963
Now I have the whip hand over you,
for you cannot give her back.

541
01:05:19,339 --> 01:05:24,552
Marianne, play with us. Looking at
the weather will not bring him back.

542
01:05:24,803 --> 01:05:30,601
- She ate nothing at dinner.
- We're all forlorn these days.

543
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:37,232
Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now
we might have our... discussion.

544
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:42,445
- Our discussion?
- I've longed to ask you something.

545
01:05:42,696 --> 01:05:49,327
You might think me impertinent.
It is an odd question.

546
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:55,916
If only he'd gone to Combe Magna.
We live but half a mile away.

547
01:05:56,167 --> 01:06:01,589
- Five and a half.
- I cannot believe it is that far.

548
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:08,513
- I can't believe it.
- Try.

549
01:06:08,554 --> 01:06:14,560
You may ask any manner of question
if that is of any help.

550
01:06:14,811 --> 01:06:21,067
Are you acquainted with your
sister-in-law's mother Mrs. Ferrars?

551
01:06:21,317 --> 01:06:27,448
Fanny's mother?
No, I have never met her.

552
01:06:27,697 --> 01:06:34,246
You must think me strange to ask.
If only I dared tell...

553
01:06:34,497 --> 01:06:41,629
If she tells you of the famous
Mr. F, you must pass it on.

554
01:06:42,004 --> 01:06:47,675
Will you take a turn with me,
Miss Dashwood?

555
01:06:49,803 --> 01:06:55,184
I had no idea you were at all
connected with that family.

556
01:06:55,433 --> 01:06:59,770
I am nothing to Mrs. Ferrars
at present.

557
01:07:00,021 --> 01:07:07,445
But the time may come when we
may be very intimately connected.

558
01:07:07,696 --> 01:07:12,659
What do you mean?

559
01:07:13,117 --> 01:07:17,205
Do you have an understanding
with Fanny's brother Robert?

560
01:07:17,456 --> 01:07:23,462
The youngest? No.
I have never met him in my life.

561
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:30,009
- With Edward.
- Edward Ferrars?

562
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:37,183
Edward and I have been
secretly engaged these five years.

563
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:42,021
You may well be surprised.

564
01:07:42,272 --> 01:07:48,777
I only mention it because I entirely
trust you to keep our secret.

565
01:07:49,028 --> 01:07:54,742
Edward looks on you
quite as his own sister.

566
01:07:54,992 --> 01:08:00,372
I am sorry.
Surely we...

567
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:04,710
We surely do not mean
the same Mr. Ferrars.

568
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:11,384
Yes. He was under the tutelage
of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.

569
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:18,932
- Has he never spoken of it?
- Yes... Yes, I believe he has.

570
01:08:20,016 --> 01:08:28,483
I wanted his mother's approval,
but we loved each other so much.

571
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:38,117
You must have seen how capable he is
of making a woman attached to him.

572
01:08:38,826 --> 01:08:42,915
I cannot pretend it has not
been hard on both of us.

573
01:08:43,165 --> 01:08:49,754
We can scarcely meet
above twice a year.

574
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:01,223
You seem out of sorts.
Are you quite well?

575
01:09:01,475 --> 01:09:07,730
- I have not offended you?
- I must know what you are saying.

576
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:16,156
- Promise me you'll not tell a soul.
- Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.

577
01:09:16,405 --> 01:09:19,075
I give you my word.

578
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:24,705
- What has so fascinated you?
- Tell us all!

579
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:32,088
- We were talking of London.
- Do you hear that, Charlotte?

580
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:37,468
- Charlotte and I concocted a plan.
- The best plan in the world!

581
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:42,306
I make for London shortly,
and I invite you, Lucy, -

582
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:48,979
- and both the Misses Dashwood
to join me.

583
01:09:49,938 --> 01:09:53,109
Can I go?

584
01:09:53,358 --> 01:09:59,240
You will all come to my Chelsea home
and taste of the season's delights.

585
01:09:59,489 --> 01:10:02,201
Please, can I go?

586
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:10,500
- Do you not long for it to be so?
- I came here with no other view.

587
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:18,299
- We can't leave our mother.
- She can spare you very well.

588
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:23,388
- Of course she can!
- I could not be more delighted.

589
01:10:23,639 --> 01:10:28,976
I will brook no refusal.
Let us strike hands on the bargain.

590
01:10:29,227 --> 01:10:37,360
If I don't have you married by
Michaelmas, it will not be my fault.

591
01:10:43,659 --> 01:10:47,162
I've never been so grateful.

592
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:52,751
I shall see Willoughby,
and you will see Edward.

593
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:58,923
- Are you asleep?
- With you in the room?

594
01:10:59,174 --> 01:11:06,764
You can't feel as calm as you look.
Oh, I will never sleep tonight.

595
01:11:07,015 --> 01:11:11,352
What were you and Miss Steele
talking about so long?

596
01:11:11,602 --> 01:11:17,192
Nothing of significance.

597
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:40,088
How do you think I like poking about
in that big house without Charlotte?

598
01:11:40,381 --> 01:11:45,636
I wrote to Edward, yet I do not know
how much I may see of him.

599
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:51,350
Secrecy is vital.
He'll never be able to call.

600
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:56,397
My only comfort has been
the constancy of his affection.

601
01:11:56,646 --> 01:12:01,485
You're fortunate never to have had
any doubts on that score.

602
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:08,742
I am of a jealous nature. Had he
talked more of one young woman...

603
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:13,914
But he's not given a moment's alarm
on that count.

604
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:20,670
Imagine how glad he'll be
to learn that we are friends.

605
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:28,929
- Have you missed me, Pigeon?
- Very much, ma'am.

606
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:34,851
- Is everything in order?
- I suggest the ordering of coal.

607
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:41,732
There you are, Pooter.
Still alive, I see... Tea, Pigeon.

608
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:48,447
You do not waste any time.
Give it to Pigeon.

609
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:58,291
Mrs. Jennings says your sister will
buy her wedding clothes in town.

610
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:05,048
John and Fanny are in town.
We should be forced to see them.

611
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:16,141
I think it was for next door.

612
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:23,441
Sit down for two seconds.
You're making me nervous.

613
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:42,000
Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.

614
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:47,005
Indeed it is.

615
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:54,221
Excuse me, Colonel.

616
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:58,474
Colonel...

617
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:03,605
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

618
01:14:03,855 --> 01:14:07,567
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

619
01:14:07,817 --> 01:14:14,324
I have heard
reports through town...

620
01:14:14,376 --> 01:14:18,828
Tell me once and for all:

621
01:14:19,078 --> 01:14:25,126
Is everything resolved between
your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

622
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:32,383
Though neither one has informed me
of their understanding, -

623
01:14:32,632 --> 01:14:37,972
- I have no doubt
of their mutual affection.

624
01:14:38,222 --> 01:14:41,892
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

625
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:46,272
To your sister
I wish all imaginable happiness.

626
01:14:46,522 --> 01:14:55,322
To Mr. Willoughby, that
he may endeavour to deserve her.

627
01:14:55,448 --> 01:14:59,702
What do you mean?

628
01:14:59,952 --> 01:15:04,832
Forgive me...

629
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:11,045
Forgive me.

630
01:15:20,639 --> 01:15:26,854
- Where is dear Edward, John?
- And who is Edward?

631
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:31,983
My brother.
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

632
01:15:32,234 --> 01:15:37,906
Ferrars with an F?

633
01:15:40,992 --> 01:15:46,956
Are there any messages?
No message at all? No cards?

634
01:15:47,207 --> 01:15:52,503
- "You" do not ask for your messages.
- No, for I do not expect any.

635
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:58,342
I have
very little acquaintance in town.

636
01:16:13,191 --> 01:16:18,779
Not another word about the ham bone.
You and Cartwright sort it out.

637
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:24,577
- No messages.
- Do not fret, my dear.

638
01:16:24,828 --> 01:16:29,791
This good weather is keeping
many a sportsman in the country.

639
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:35,338
But the frost will soon
drive them to town. Depend on it.

640
01:16:35,588 --> 01:16:38,757
I had not thought of that.

641
01:16:39,008 --> 01:16:41,969
And Miss Dashwood
may set her heart at rest, -

642
01:16:42,219 --> 01:16:48,643
- for your sister-in-law is inviting
Mr. F to the ball tonight.

643
01:16:48,892 --> 01:16:49,184
Do be careful,
the horses have been here.

644
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:54,315
Do be careful,
the horses have been here.

645
01:16:54,565 --> 01:17:00,821
It is beginning to rain also.
Follow me.

646
01:17:28,097 --> 01:17:33,102
Mamma!
This is very merry!

647
01:17:33,353 --> 01:17:38,358
- Do you spy anyone we know?
- No. Mr. Palmer has a better view.

648
01:17:38,608 --> 01:17:43,488
- Do you see anyone we know?
- Unfortunately not.

649
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:50,869
How can you be such a tease?
There is Mrs. John Dashwood.

650
01:17:52,872 --> 01:17:57,835
Come along, my dears.

651
01:17:58,795 --> 01:18:01,630
There you are!

652
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:06,427
How hot it is...
You are not alone, I trust?

653
01:18:06,678 --> 01:18:11,349
John is just gone
to fetch my brother.

654
01:18:11,598 --> 01:18:17,813
Your brother! I declare,
this is good news, indeed.

655
01:18:18,064 --> 01:18:20,982
I shall faint clean away.

656
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:26,239
Mrs. Jennings, I am pleased
to meet you. My brother-in-law...

657
01:18:26,488 --> 01:18:30,242
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

658
01:18:30,325 --> 01:18:34,872
Miss Dashwood,
Miss Steele, Miss Marianne.

659
01:18:35,122 --> 01:18:40,502
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

660
01:18:40,711 --> 01:18:44,840
You must be the younger brother.
Is Mr. Edward not here?

661
01:18:45,091 --> 01:18:49,969
- Miss Dashwood was counting on him.
- He is far too busy.

662
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:55,475
There's no special acquaintance here
to make his attendance worthwhile.

663
01:18:55,726 --> 01:19:01,189
What are the men about these days?
Are they in hiding?

664
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:10,407
In the absence of your brother
"you" must dance with Miss Dashwood.

665
01:19:12,241 --> 01:19:16,788
It would be my honour.

666
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:28,675
Perhaps Miss Steele might consider
reserving the "allemande"?

667
01:20:06,879 --> 01:20:13,301
You reside in Devonshire,
Miss Dashwood?

668
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:19,224
- In a cottage?
- Yes.

669
01:20:19,475 --> 01:20:24,564
I am excessively fond of a cottage.

670
01:20:24,813 --> 01:20:31,570
If I had any money to spare,
I should build one myself.

671
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:44,458
Mr. Willoughby...

672
01:20:44,708 --> 01:20:48,420
- How do you do, Miss Dashwood?
- Very well.

673
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:55,010
- How is your family?
- We are all extremely well.

674
01:20:55,062 --> 01:20:59,889
Thank you for your kind inquiry.

675
01:21:00,098 --> 01:21:04,102
Willoughby!

676
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:18,116
Good God, Willoughby...

677
01:21:18,492 --> 01:21:22,369
Will you not shake hands with me?

678
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:27,625
How do you do, Miss Marianne?

679
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:32,796
What is the matter?
Why have you not come to see me?

680
01:21:33,047 --> 01:21:37,676
Were you not in London?
Have you not received my letters?

681
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:44,350
I had the pleasure of receiving
the information you sent to me.

682
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:51,065
For heaven's sake, Willoughby,
tell me what is wrong.

683
01:21:51,816 --> 01:21:55,486
Thank you. I am most obliged.

684
01:21:55,737 --> 01:22:01,908
Excuse me, I must rejoin my party.

685
01:22:20,343 --> 01:22:25,182
Go to him.
Force him to come to me instantly.

686
01:22:25,432 --> 01:22:30,604
You must come away.

687
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:38,736
- Do you know them?
- Acquaintances from the country.

688
01:22:45,035 --> 01:22:50,790
Come away, dearest.

689
01:22:56,129 --> 01:23:00,925
I do not understand.
I must speak to him...

690
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:07,515
My goodness. Come, dear.
You need some air.

691
01:23:18,443 --> 01:23:22,863
Lucy!
We must go.

692
01:23:23,114 --> 01:23:28,244
It would be our pleasure
to escort your young charge home.

693
01:23:28,494 --> 01:23:30,746
How kind.

694
01:23:30,997 --> 01:23:37,753
She actually sent him messages
during the night?

695
01:23:46,929 --> 01:23:51,516
- Marianne, please tell me.
- Do not ask me questions.

696
01:23:51,767 --> 01:23:59,984
- You have no confidence in me.
- You confide in no one.

697
01:24:00,233 --> 01:24:05,614
- I have nothing to tell.
- We neither of us do.

698
01:24:05,865 --> 01:24:12,787
I, because I conceal nothing. You,
because you communicate nothing.

699
01:24:17,626 --> 01:24:23,006
Lady Charteris ought to limit her
invitation list. It was very warm.

700
01:24:23,256 --> 01:24:26,843
I am glad we left early.

701
01:24:27,094 --> 01:24:32,765
There now...

702
01:24:34,225 --> 01:24:40,481
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal.
That letter will do the trick.

703
01:24:40,732 --> 01:24:47,447
I must be off. I do hope he doesn't
keep her waiting much longer.

704
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:52,076
It hurts to see her this way.

705
01:24:53,035 --> 01:24:56,539
What a welcome I had
from Edward's family.

706
01:24:56,790 --> 01:25:03,253
You never said how agreeable
your sister-in-law is. Robert, also.

707
01:25:03,504 --> 01:25:10,761
It is fortunate that none of them
knows of your engagement.

708
01:25:17,768 --> 01:25:24,816
"Dear Madam, I am at a loss to see
how I might have offended you."

709
01:25:25,067 --> 01:25:30,656
"If I have given rise to a belief of
more than I meant to express, -

710
01:25:30,906 --> 01:25:34,702
- I regret
not having been more guarded."

711
01:25:34,951 --> 01:25:37,872
"My affections
are engaged elsewhere."

712
01:25:38,121 --> 01:25:43,918
"It is with regret that I return
your letters and the lock of hair."

713
01:25:44,169 --> 01:25:50,509
"I am, et cetera, John Willoughby."

714
01:25:51,051 --> 01:25:55,513
Dearest...

715
01:25:55,890 --> 01:26:03,604
It is better than if your engagement
had carried on before he ended it.

716
01:26:03,855 --> 01:26:06,608
We're not engaged.

717
01:26:06,859 --> 01:26:11,655
I thought he left you
with some kind of understanding.

718
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:18,911
- He's not so unworthy as you think.
- Did he tell you that he loved you?

719
01:26:19,162 --> 01:26:27,796
Yes. No... Never absolutely.
It was implied but never declared.

720
01:26:28,046 --> 01:26:33,051
Sometimes I thought it had been,
but it never was. He broke no vow.

721
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:37,847
He made us all believe he loved you.

722
01:26:38,097 --> 01:26:45,520
He did! He loved me as I loved him.

723
01:26:46,981 --> 01:26:51,777
I "had" to come straight up.
How are you, Miss Marianne?

724
01:26:52,027 --> 01:26:56,741
Poor thing, she looks very bad.
No wonder, for it is but too true.

725
01:26:56,992 --> 01:27:00,452
I was told by Miss Morton, -

726
01:27:00,703 --> 01:27:06,084
- that he is soon to marry
a Miss Grey with 50,000!

727
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:12,005
If true, he is a good-for-nothing
who used my young friend ill.

728
01:27:12,256 --> 01:27:17,470
And I wish with all my soul that his
wife might plague all his heart out.

729
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:22,724
He's not the only young man
worth having.

730
01:27:22,975 --> 01:27:28,773
With your pretty face
you'll never want for admirers.

731
01:27:30,316 --> 01:27:35,194
Better let her have her cry out
and have done with it.

732
01:27:35,445 --> 01:27:39,950
I will go look out something
to tempt her.

733
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:47,083
- Does she care for olives?
- I cannot tell you.

734
01:27:53,046 --> 01:27:55,923
Apparently, they never were engaged.

735
01:27:56,174 --> 01:28:00,553
Miss Grey has 50,000.
Marianne is virtually penniless.

736
01:28:00,804 --> 01:28:05,683
She couldn't expect him to go
through with it. But I feel for her.

737
01:28:05,934 --> 01:28:10,104
She will lose her bloom
and end a spinster like Elinor.

738
01:28:10,355 --> 01:28:17,362
We might have them to stay for a
few days. We are, after all, family.

739
01:28:17,612 --> 01:28:20,865
- And my father...
- My love...

740
01:28:21,115 --> 01:28:26,036
I would ask them with all my heart,
but I've already asked Miss Steele.

741
01:28:26,287 --> 01:28:30,374
And we cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings
of all her company.

742
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:33,753
We can invite your sisters
some other year.

743
01:28:34,002 --> 01:28:39,259
Miss Steele will profit more
from your generosity, poor girl.

744
01:28:39,508 --> 01:28:43,971
Excellent notion.

745
01:28:46,474 --> 01:28:49,351
Colonel Brandon to see you.

746
01:28:49,602 --> 01:28:56,901
- Thank you so much for coming.
- How is your sister?

747
01:28:57,151 --> 01:29:04,199
I must get her home. Palmer can take
us to Cleveland, a day from Barton.

748
01:29:04,449 --> 01:29:12,374
- I'll take you to Barton myself.
- I confess, that is what I hoped.

749
01:29:12,624 --> 01:29:16,294
Marianne suffers cruelly.

750
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:25,344
What pains me most is how hard
she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.

751
01:29:27,097 --> 01:29:31,768
Perhaps...

752
01:29:32,018 --> 01:29:38,025
May I relate some circumstances
which only a desire to be useful...

753
01:29:38,274 --> 01:29:44,155
You have something to tell me
of Mr. Willoughby?

754
01:29:51,913 --> 01:29:55,625
When I quitted Barton last...

755
01:29:55,874 --> 01:29:59,629
No, I must go further back.

756
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:04,592
No doubt...
No doubt...

757
01:30:04,842 --> 01:30:09,389
...Mrs. Jennings has appraised you
of certain events in my past.

758
01:30:09,638 --> 01:30:17,438
The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

759
01:30:17,898 --> 01:30:21,734
What is not commonly known -

760
01:30:21,984 --> 01:30:27,949
- is that 20 years ago,
before she died, Eliza bore a child.

761
01:30:28,199 --> 01:30:32,244
The father, whoever he was,
abandoned them.

762
01:30:32,495 --> 01:30:38,542
As Eliza lay dying, she begged me
to look after the child.

763
01:30:38,793 --> 01:30:44,173
I had failed her in ever other way,
I could not refuse her now.

764
01:30:44,422 --> 01:30:49,553
I placed the child, Beth,
with a family in the country -

765
01:30:49,803 --> 01:30:55,183
- where I knew she would be looked
after. I saw her whenever I could.

766
01:30:55,433 --> 01:30:58,771
She grew up so headstrong, -

767
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:05,360
- and, God forgive me,
I allowed her too much freedom.

768
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:08,864
Almost a year ago she disappeared.

769
01:31:09,114 --> 01:31:13,743
I instigated a search, but for
eight months I imagined the worst.

770
01:31:13,994 --> 01:31:20,667
On the day of the Delaford picnic,
I received the first news of her.

771
01:31:20,917 --> 01:31:25,129
She was... with child.

772
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:32,762
And the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts...

773
01:31:37,434 --> 01:31:43,022
Do you mean Willoughby?

774
01:31:43,356 --> 01:31:49,153
Before I could confront him,
Lady Allen had turned him out.

775
01:31:49,404 --> 01:31:54,075
- He fled to London.
- He left without any explanation.

776
01:31:54,325 --> 01:32:01,665
He risked losing the estate, and the
money that remained to his debtors.

777
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:06,045
So he abandoned Marianne -

778
01:32:06,294 --> 01:32:12,385
- for Miss Grey
and her 50,000.

779
01:32:13,177 --> 01:32:16,471
Is Beth still in town?

780
01:32:16,722 --> 01:32:22,478
She has chosen to go to the country
for her confinement.

781
01:32:28,026 --> 01:32:32,821
I would not burden you,
had I not, from my heart, -

782
01:32:33,072 --> 01:32:39,829
- believed it might, in time,
lessen your sister's regrets.

783
01:32:48,212 --> 01:32:54,301
I have described Mr. Willoughby
as the worst of libertines.

784
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:59,931
But I learned from Lady Allen that
he did mean to propose that day.

785
01:33:00,182 --> 01:33:09,440
I cannot deny that his intentions
towards Marianne were honourable.

786
01:33:09,857 --> 01:33:15,071
I feel certain
that he would have married her.

787
01:33:15,321 --> 01:33:20,911
- Had it not been...
- For the money.

788
01:33:24,914 --> 01:33:31,671
- Was I right to tell you?
- Of course.

789
01:33:32,463 --> 01:33:37,134
Whatever his past actions,
whatever his present course, -

790
01:33:37,384 --> 01:33:41,972
- you may be certain
that he loved you.

791
01:33:42,223 --> 01:33:45,601
But not enough.

792
01:33:45,851 --> 01:33:50,564
Not enough...

793
01:33:56,987 --> 01:34:02,201
Here is someone to cheer you up.

794
01:34:03,327 --> 01:34:09,625
How is your dear sister?
Poor thing.

795
01:34:09,876 --> 01:34:14,796
I do not know what I'd do if a man
treated me with so little respect.

796
01:34:15,047 --> 01:34:18,592
Are you enjoying your stay
with John and Fanny?

797
01:34:18,843 --> 01:34:24,931
I was never so happy in my life.
Your sister-in-law has taken to me.

798
01:34:25,182 --> 01:34:30,103
- You cannot imagine what happened.
- No, I cannot.

799
01:34:30,354 --> 01:34:37,652
Yesterday I was introduced to his
mother. She was more than civil.

800
01:34:37,902 --> 01:34:45,285
I have not yet seen Edward,
but I feel sure to, very soon.

801
01:34:46,703 --> 01:34:53,001
There is a Mr. Edward Ferrars
to see you.

802
01:34:55,169 --> 01:34:59,883
Do ask him to come in.

803
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:41,632
What a pleasure to see you.
You know Miss Steele, of course.

804
01:35:44,468 --> 01:35:53,060
- How do you do, Miss Steele?
- I am well, thank you.

805
01:35:53,352 --> 01:35:58,733
Do sit down.

806
01:36:01,777 --> 01:36:09,201
Are you surprised to find me here
and not at your sister's house?

807
01:36:09,493 --> 01:36:15,541
Let me fetch Marianne. She would be
disappointed to miss you.

808
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:19,545
Edward! I heard your voice.

809
01:36:19,795 --> 01:36:26,092
- At last you found us.
- My visit is shamefully overdue.

810
01:36:26,342 --> 01:36:32,307
- You're pale. Are you not well?
- Don't think of me. Elinor is well.

811
01:36:32,557 --> 01:36:38,897
- That is enough for both of us.
- How do you enjoy London?

812
01:36:39,148 --> 01:36:47,613
The sight of you is all the pleasure
it has afforded. Is that not so?

813
01:36:47,739 --> 01:36:52,786
- Why have you not visited before?
- I have been engaged elsewhere.

814
01:36:53,035 --> 01:36:57,706
But what was that when there were
such friends to be met?

815
01:36:57,957 --> 01:37:02,795
Perhaps you think young men
never honour their engagements?

816
01:37:03,046 --> 01:37:09,719
Edward is the most incapable of
being selfish of anyone I ever saw.

817
01:37:11,053 --> 01:37:19,312
Edward, will you not sit?
Help me to persuade him.

818
01:37:25,401 --> 01:37:30,656
- Forgive me. I must take my leave.
- You are only just arrived.

819
01:37:30,907 --> 01:37:34,118
I've an urgent commission for Fanny.

820
01:37:34,368 --> 01:37:40,040
Perhaps you might escort me
back to your sister's house.

821
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:46,922
It would be an honour.

822
01:38:03,938 --> 01:38:10,112
- Why did you not urge him to stay?
- He must have had his reasons.

823
01:38:10,362 --> 01:38:18,996
Yes, your coldness. Were I Edward,
I'd assume you didn't care for me.

824
01:38:20,998 --> 01:38:27,629
Marianne looked badly. It makes me
fear that I shall never marry.

825
01:38:27,878 --> 01:38:32,676
Nonsense. You will marry far better
than the Dashwood girls.

826
01:38:32,925 --> 01:38:36,095
But I have no dowry.

827
01:38:36,345 --> 01:38:41,893
There are other important qualities
that you have in abundance.

828
01:38:42,143 --> 01:38:47,439
It would not surprise me if you
married beyond your expectations.

829
01:38:47,690 --> 01:38:51,611
Oh, I wish that might be so.

830
01:38:51,861 --> 01:38:55,948
There is a young man...

831
01:38:56,199 --> 01:39:00,286
Is he of good fortune and breeding?

832
01:39:00,537 --> 01:39:06,208
Of both. But his family
would certainly oppose the match.

833
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:11,089
They will allow it
as soon as they see you.

834
01:39:11,338 --> 01:39:14,091
It is a very great secret.

835
01:39:14,341 --> 01:39:19,389
I've told nobody in the world
for fear of discovery.

836
01:39:19,638 --> 01:39:27,521
- I am the soul of discretion.
- If I dared tell...

837
01:39:27,687 --> 01:39:34,611
I can assure you,
I am as silent as the grave.

838
01:39:39,908 --> 01:39:45,455
Viper in my bosom!

839
01:39:46,456 --> 01:39:51,753
Stop this!

840
01:40:05,225 --> 01:40:12,232
What a commotion! Edward Ferrars,
the one I used to joke "you" about, -

841
01:40:12,482 --> 01:40:17,569
- is engaged these five years
to Lucy Steele.

842
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:25,495
His mother has demanded he break the
engagement or suffer disinheritance.

843
01:40:25,744 --> 01:40:31,001
But he refuses to break his promise.
He has stood by her, -

844
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:37,215
- and is cut off without a penny.
She settled it all on Mr. Robert.

845
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:45,722
I must find Lucy. Your sister-in-law
drove her to hysteria.

846
01:40:46,015 --> 01:40:51,645
How long have you known?

847
01:40:52,313 --> 01:40:57,567
- Since Mrs. Jennings invited us.
- Why did you not tell me?

848
01:40:57,818 --> 01:41:00,946
Lucy told me in confidence.

849
01:41:01,197 --> 01:41:05,034
- I could not break my word.
- He loves "you"!

850
01:41:05,284 --> 01:41:11,665
- He tried to tell me about Lucy.
- He cannot marry her.

851
01:41:11,915 --> 01:41:16,420
Should he treat her worse
than Willoughby treated you?

852
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:23,177
- He can't marry without love.
- He promised a long time ago.

853
01:41:23,426 --> 01:41:31,935
He may harbour some regret, but he
he will be happy he kept his word.

854
01:41:32,186 --> 01:41:40,444
It is bewitching to think one's
happiness depends on one person, -

855
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:45,281
- but it is not always possible.
We must accept.

856
01:41:45,532 --> 01:41:50,954
Edward will marry Lucy,
and you and I will go home.

857
01:41:51,204 --> 01:41:54,707
Always resignation and acceptance.

858
01:41:54,958 --> 01:41:58,461
Always prudence and honour and duty.

859
01:41:58,711 --> 01:42:02,632
Elinor, where is your heart?

860
01:42:02,882 --> 01:42:07,302
What do you know of my heart,
or anything but your own suffering?

861
01:42:07,553 --> 01:42:12,642
For weeks this has been pressed
on me, when I could not speak of it.

862
01:42:12,892 --> 01:42:19,814
Forced on me by the person whose
prior claims ruined all my hopes.

863
01:42:20,066 --> 01:42:24,946
I endured her exaltation, knowing
I was divided from Edward forever.

864
01:42:25,196 --> 01:42:32,453
If not bound to silence, I'd have
produced proof of a broken heart.

865
01:42:58,144 --> 01:43:05,568
I have heard your Mr. Ferrars
has lost his fortune to his brother.

866
01:43:05,819 --> 01:43:11,242
- Have I been rightly informed?
- It is indeed so.

867
01:43:11,491 --> 01:43:18,956
- Are you acquainted with him?
- No, we have never met.

868
01:43:19,207 --> 01:43:24,003
But I know only too well
the cruelty...

869
01:43:24,254 --> 01:43:32,054
...of dividing two young people
long attached to one another.

870
01:43:33,221 --> 01:43:39,143
I have a proposal that may allow him
to marry Miss Steele immediately.

871
01:43:39,394 --> 01:43:45,733
As he is a friend to your family,
perhaps you'd mention it to him.

872
01:43:46,567 --> 01:43:54,867
I'm sure he'd be delighted
to hear it from your own lips.

873
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:57,912
I think not.

874
01:43:58,161 --> 01:44:04,627
His behaviour has proved him proud.
In the best sense.

875
01:44:04,878 --> 01:44:10,466
I feel certain
this is the right course.

876
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:20,433
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

877
01:44:28,691 --> 01:44:31,737
Thank you for responding so quickly.

878
01:44:31,988 --> 01:44:35,866
I was grateful
to receive your message.

879
01:44:36,116 --> 01:44:39,160
God knows what you must think of me.

880
01:44:39,411 --> 01:44:44,332
- I have no right to speak...
- I have good news.

881
01:44:44,583 --> 01:44:49,129
Do please sit down.

882
01:44:52,507 --> 01:44:57,846
- You know of Col. Brandon.
- I've heard his name.

883
01:44:58,095 --> 01:45:04,144
Col. Brandon desires me to say,
as you wish to join the clergy, -

884
01:45:04,395 --> 01:45:10,149
- that he has pleasure in offering
you the parish at Delaford, -

885
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:15,947
- in the hope it may enable
you and Miss Steele to marry.

886
01:45:16,198 --> 01:45:19,701
- Col. Brandon?
- Yes.

887
01:45:19,950 --> 01:45:28,334
He means it as testimony of his
concern for this cruel situation.

888
01:45:28,386 --> 01:45:32,714
Col. Brandon give me a parish?

889
01:45:32,965 --> 01:45:36,551
Can it be possible?

890
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:43,391
You shouldn't be astonished to find
friendship outside your family.

891
01:45:43,641 --> 01:45:49,271
No.
Not to find it in you.

892
01:45:49,522 --> 01:45:54,527
I cannot be ignorant that it is
certainly to you that I owe this.

893
01:45:54,777 --> 01:45:58,780
I'd express it if I could,
but I am no orator...

894
01:45:59,031 --> 01:46:06,664
You are mistaken.
You owe it to your own merit.

895
01:46:09,583 --> 01:46:13,879
Col. Brandon must be a man
of great worth.

896
01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:20,135
He is the kindest and best of men.

897
01:46:20,635 --> 01:46:26,016
May I ask why the colonel
did not tell me himself?

898
01:46:26,267 --> 01:46:33,524
I think he felt it would be better
coming from a friend.

899
01:46:36,401 --> 01:46:43,408
Your friendship has been
the most important in my life.

900
01:46:45,243 --> 01:46:50,456
You will always have it.

901
01:46:52,709 --> 01:46:55,962
Forgive me.

902
01:46:56,212 --> 01:47:01,384
You honour your promises. That is
more important than anything else.

903
01:47:01,635 --> 01:47:07,640
I wish you both happiness.

904
01:47:45,803 --> 01:47:49,848
What luck for them
to find a parish so close to Barton.

905
01:47:50,099 --> 01:47:54,269
You'll all be able to meet
very often.

906
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:59,357
I've never disliked a person so much
as I do Mr. Willoughby.

907
01:47:59,608 --> 01:48:07,032
We can see his house from the hill!
I'll ask Jackson to plant trees.

908
01:48:07,282 --> 01:48:09,326
You won't.

909
01:48:09,576 --> 01:48:16,000
I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown
was everything of the finest...

910
01:48:26,426 --> 01:48:33,850
Mrs. Bunting!
We're in desperate need of tea.

911
01:48:39,730 --> 01:48:44,570
She's not drawn breath since London.
Had I only found another way home.

912
01:48:44,819 --> 01:48:51,284
There was no other way. I'll just
take a stroll. A moment's peace.

913
01:48:51,533 --> 01:48:56,164
- I think it is going to rain.
- No, it will not rain.

914
01:48:56,414 --> 01:49:04,005
- When you say so, it always does.
- I shall keep to the garden.

915
01:49:22,149 --> 01:49:32,950
We are very proud of our Thomas.
His papa has such a way with him.

916
01:49:43,085 --> 01:49:50,175
Oh, there you are.
Come and meet little Thomas.

917
01:50:04,231 --> 01:50:09,194
I cannot see Marianne.

918
01:50:45,938 --> 01:50:52,779
Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds, -

919
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:58,325
- or bends with the remover
to remove.

920
01:50:58,576 --> 01:51:03,706
Oh, no, 'tis an ever fixed mark -

921
01:51:03,956 --> 01:51:10,212
- that looks on tempests
and is never shaken.

922
01:51:10,879 --> 01:51:15,134
Willoughby...

923
01:51:15,385 --> 01:51:18,387
Willoughby...

924
01:51:18,637 --> 01:51:23,267
Willoughby...

925
01:51:25,561 --> 01:51:27,563
Marianne?

926
01:51:27,813 --> 01:51:34,444
- She'll be wet through.
- Thank you for pointing that out.

927
01:51:34,695 --> 01:51:38,532
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood.
Brandon will find her.

928
01:51:38,782 --> 01:51:45,122
We can all guess where she went.

929
01:52:12,439 --> 01:52:16,445
She's not hurt,
but we must get her warm.

930
01:52:16,694 --> 01:52:23,368
There is a fire lit in my room.
Do hurry!

931
01:52:49,435 --> 01:52:55,024
I think Marianne may need
a doctor.

932
01:53:12,707 --> 01:53:19,673
You'll wear yourself out. A day or
two in bed will set her to rights.

933
01:53:19,923 --> 01:53:26,305
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel.
I've never found a better physician.

934
01:53:26,554 --> 01:53:33,771
- What is the diagnosis?
- It is an infectious fever.

935
01:53:34,021 --> 01:53:41,653
- I recommend removing your child.
- Mrs. Bunting!

936
01:53:48,243 --> 01:53:53,832
Miss Dashwood...
I am more sorry than I can say.

937
01:53:54,082 --> 01:53:59,795
- If you prefer me to stay I shall.
- That is very kind.

938
01:54:00,046 --> 01:54:04,259
But Col. Brandon and Dr. Harris
will look after us.

939
01:54:04,509 --> 01:54:09,472
Thank you for all you have done.

940
01:54:36,123 --> 01:54:42,171
She's not doing as well
as I would like.

941
01:54:54,141 --> 01:54:58,562
What can I do?

942
01:54:58,812 --> 01:55:05,152
- You've done so much already.
- Anything, or I shall run mad.

943
01:55:05,402 --> 01:55:11,366
She would be easier
if her mother were here.

944
01:55:53,867 --> 01:55:56,911
I must fetch more laudanum.

945
01:55:57,161 --> 01:56:05,461
I cannot pretend that your sister's
condition is not very serious.

946
01:56:08,423 --> 01:56:11,675
You must prepare yourself.

947
01:56:11,926 --> 01:56:17,139
I will return shortly.

948
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:34,657
Marianne...

949
01:56:34,907 --> 01:56:39,870
Marianne, please try...

950
01:56:40,287 --> 01:56:44,459
Marianne...

951
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:50,797
Please try...

952
01:56:59,765 --> 01:57:06,772
I cannot...
I cannot do without you.

953
01:57:12,986 --> 01:57:19,617
I've tried to bear everything else.
I will try...

954
01:57:19,867 --> 01:57:25,248
But please, dearest...

955
01:57:27,709 --> 01:57:32,213
...beloved Marianne...

956
01:57:34,382 --> 01:57:39,929
...do not leave me alone.

957
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:36,693
Elinor...

958
01:59:00,759 --> 01:59:04,345
My mother...

959
01:59:12,311 --> 01:59:18,526
She is out of danger.
She is out of danger.

960
01:59:29,578 --> 01:59:32,789
- Where is Elinor?
- I'm here.

961
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:37,837
Dearest, I am here.

962
01:59:40,506 --> 01:59:45,553
Col. Brandon...

963
01:59:50,682 --> 01:59:56,147
Thank you.

964
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:41,817
He's not so dashing as Willoughby,
but he has a pleasing countenance.

965
02:00:42,066 --> 02:00:49,532
There was something in Willoughby's
eyes at times that I did not like.

966
02:00:52,201 --> 02:00:55,830
"Nor is the earth the lesse,
or loseth aught."

967
02:00:56,081 --> 02:01:04,004
"What from one place doth fall is
with the tide to another brought."

968
02:01:04,255 --> 02:01:10,803
"For there is nothing lost
but may be found...

969
02:01:11,053 --> 02:01:16,643
...if sought."

970
02:01:18,144 --> 02:01:23,231
- Shall we continue tomorrow?
- No, for I must away.

971
02:01:23,482 --> 02:01:29,697
- Away? Where?
- That I cannot tell you.

972
02:01:29,948 --> 02:01:35,244
It is a secret.

973
02:01:35,829 --> 02:01:41,583
You will not stay away long?

974
02:01:56,181 --> 02:02:00,018
There.

975
02:02:00,269 --> 02:02:05,816
There I fell,
and there I first saw Willoughby.

976
02:02:06,067 --> 02:02:11,029
Poor Willoughby.
He will always regret you.

977
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:16,827
Does it follow that, had he chosen
me, he would have been content?

978
02:02:17,077 --> 02:02:21,539
He would have had a wife he loved,
but no money, -

979
02:02:21,790 --> 02:02:30,299
- and might have learned to rank
his pocketbook above his heart.

980
02:02:31,716 --> 02:02:37,305
If his regrets are half as painful
as mine, he will suffer enough.

981
02:02:37,555 --> 02:02:43,394
Do you compare
your conduct with his?

982
02:02:43,645 --> 02:02:51,611
I compare it to what it
ought to have been. With yours.

983
02:03:03,038 --> 02:03:06,459
I fetched those beef fillets, ma'am.

984
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:12,756
Beef is less expensive in Exeter.
Anyway, it's for Marianne.

985
02:03:13,007 --> 02:03:16,802
- Was Exeter crowded?
- It was, ma'am.

986
02:03:17,053 --> 02:03:22,682
Miss Pothington
has had another stroke.

987
02:03:22,933 --> 02:03:27,021
And Miss Murden has turned away
Coles for his drunkenness.

988
02:03:27,271 --> 02:03:34,361
And Mr. Ferrars is married,
but of course you know that.

989
02:03:35,863 --> 02:03:38,782
Who told you he was married?

990
02:03:39,032 --> 02:03:46,707
I saw Mrs. Ferrars myself. She and
Mr. Ferrars stopped at the inn.

991
02:03:46,957 --> 02:03:51,461
I saw it was Miss Steele,
so I took off my hat.

992
02:03:51,711 --> 02:03:56,424
She inquired after all of you,
especially Miss Dashwood.

993
02:03:56,675 --> 02:04:05,641
She bade me give their compliments.
They're sending a piece of the cake.

994
02:04:05,893 --> 02:04:11,356
- Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well?
- She said she was vastly contented.

995
02:04:11,606 --> 02:04:16,695
As she was always an affable lady,
I made free to wish her joy.

996
02:04:16,945 --> 02:04:21,824
Thank you, Thomas.

997
02:04:51,312 --> 02:04:56,109
- What is it, Thomas?
- I'm not sure, but it's heavy.

998
02:04:56,358 --> 02:05:02,239
"It is small enough for the parlour.
When I follow shortly, I expect -

999
02:05:02,489 --> 02:05:08,078
- that you've learnt the enclosed.
Your friend, Christopher Brandon."

1000
02:05:08,329 --> 02:05:11,957
It fits perfectly.

1001
02:05:12,207 --> 02:05:15,294
Here you are, Miss Marianne.

1002
02:05:15,543 --> 02:05:18,213
Fetch some tea.

1003
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:26,430
- He must like you very much.
- It's for all of us.

1004
02:06:12,683 --> 02:06:17,481
Here is Col. Brandon.

1005
02:06:25,821 --> 02:06:33,245
- I do not think it is the colonel.
- He said he would arrive today.

1006
02:06:33,495 --> 02:06:36,247
Edward!

1007
02:06:36,499 --> 02:06:41,045
It is Edward!

1008
02:06:41,421 --> 02:06:46,717
Calm.
We must be calm.

1009
02:07:06,153 --> 02:07:10,615
Mr. Ferrars for you, ma'am.

1010
02:07:12,992 --> 02:07:18,957
Edward...
What a pleasure to see you.

1011
02:07:34,472 --> 02:07:42,605
- I trust I find you all well?
- Thank you. We are all very well.

1012
02:07:45,858 --> 02:07:52,282
We've been enjoying fine weather...
Well, we "have".

1013
02:07:52,532 --> 02:08:00,165
I'm glad to hear it.
The roads were very dry.

1014
02:08:02,374 --> 02:08:09,674
I wish you great joy, Edward.

1015
02:08:24,938 --> 02:08:30,778
I hope
you have left Mrs. Ferrars well.

1016
02:08:31,028 --> 02:08:36,993
Tolerably... Thank you.

1017
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:43,332
Is Mrs. Ferrars at the new parish?

1018
02:08:43,581 --> 02:08:47,670
No... my mother is in town.

1019
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:53,133
I meant Mrs. Edward Ferrars.

1020
02:08:54,926 --> 02:09:00,557
You've not heard?

1021
02:09:01,099 --> 02:09:06,771
I think you mean my brother.
Mrs. Robert Ferrars.

1022
02:09:07,773 --> 02:09:13,236
- Mrs. "Robert" Ferrars?
- Yes.

1023
02:09:13,486 --> 02:09:19,534
I received a letter
from Miss Steele, -

1024
02:09:19,785 --> 02:09:26,540
- or Mrs. Ferrars, I should say,
communicating to me -

1025
02:09:26,791 --> 02:09:32,046
- the transfer of her affections
to my brother Robert.

1026
02:09:32,297 --> 02:09:36,800
It seems they were much
thrown together in London.

1027
02:09:37,051 --> 02:09:43,349
In view of my new circumstances
I felt it only right -

1028
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:48,104
- that she be released
from our engagement.

1029
02:09:48,355 --> 02:09:54,944
At any rate, they were married
last week in Plymouth.

1030
02:09:58,656 --> 02:10:03,369
Then you...

1031
02:10:03,452 --> 02:10:06,538
...are not married?

1032
02:10:06,789 --> 02:10:12,170
No.

1033
02:10:36,985 --> 02:10:42,824
Elinor...
I met Lucy when I was very young.

1034
02:10:43,075 --> 02:10:49,581
Had I had a profession, I would not
have felt such an idle inclination.

1035
02:10:49,832 --> 02:10:56,504
At Norland, I convinced myself that
you felt only friendship for me, -

1036
02:10:56,754 --> 02:11:00,675
- and that it was my heart alone
that I was risking.

1037
02:11:00,926 --> 02:11:09,351
I have come with no expectations,
only to express, now I am able, -

1038
02:11:09,393 --> 02:11:16,899
- that my heart is,
and always will be...

1039
02:11:17,107 --> 02:11:22,154
...yours.

1040
02:11:33,708 --> 02:11:39,547
- He's sitting next to her.
- What else?

1041
02:11:39,797 --> 02:11:42,549
Tell us!

1042
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:48,264
He's kneeling down!
