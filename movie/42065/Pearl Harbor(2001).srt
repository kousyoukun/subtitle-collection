(田纳西州，一九二三年)

3
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,010
德国佬，两点钟方向
German bandits at two o'clock!

4
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,510
全速前进
Increase throttle! Power dive!

5
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,050
你拼错了啦，雷夫
Spell it right, Rafe.

6
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,380
方向舵，应该是两个 D
"Rudder" is spelled with two Ds.

7
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,550
谢了，伙伴
哦，不客气
Thanks, wingman. Yeah, sure.

8
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,160
敌机来袭
Whoa, bandits!

9
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,850
打得好，丹尼
Crack shooting, Danny.

10
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,030
你也一样
Crack shooting, Rafe.

11
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,090
为了自由
Land of the free.

12
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,030
为了祖国
Home of the brave.

13
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,750
飞得帅呆了，老爸
Great flying, Dad

14
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,020
来吧，我教你开飞机
Come on. I'm gonna teach you how to fly.

15
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,730
我要坐前面
I get the front!

16
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,100
不，你得坐后面
No, you take the back.

17
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,100
我比较高，我应该坐前面
I'm bigger, and I should be in front.

18
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,230
我比你大，我还要教你呢
I'm older, and I'm teaching, so no.

19
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,240
哇，我们真像在飞一样啦！
Wow. It's like we're really flying.

20
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,110
我玩过好几次了
Yeah, I did it lots of times.

21
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,200
你去守住机关枪，我来减速
Come on, you man the guns. I'll give her some throttle.

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,840
我们要打落德国飞机
We gotta get those dirty German bandits.

23
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,820
噢，天啊
Oh, gosh!

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,430
快停下来，雷夫！
Hang on! Make it stop, Rafe!

25
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,660
我看我爸开过很多次，没事儿！
I've seen my dad do this lots of times, don't worry!

26
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,760
雷夫！
Rafe!

27
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,540
喔，我们飞起来了啦！
Oh, my gosh! We're flying!

28
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,600
我们飞起来了
We're flying!

29
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,100
我老爸饶不了我！快走
My dad's gonna kill me. Come on.

30
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,620
好耶
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

31
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,500
我们飞起来了！我们飞起来了！
We flew! We flew!

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,770
好耶，我是飞行员
我知道了
Yeah! Yes! I'm a pilot! I know!

33
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,870
我们飞起来了
We flew.

34
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,770
你这个没用的东西
爸爸…
You no-account boy! Daddy...

35
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,350
我说过，别和这个笨蛋泡在一起
I done told you, you spend time playing with this stupid boy...

36
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,650
他不识字！你会一辈子没出息的
...can't read. you ain't never going to amount to nothing!

37
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,220
爸，他才不蠢
He ain't stupid, Daddy!

38
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,650
爸…
Daddy!

39
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,120
过来
Ohh! Come on!

40
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,320
马上回家去
Uhh! Get on back home. Now!

41
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,120
快点，你还有活要干呢！走吧
Get on up. You got work to do. Come on!

42
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,830
快点，给我回去
Come on, get on home!

43
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,970
你放开他
Uhh! You let him alone!

44
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,340
爸爸，别这样
Daddy, no!

45
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,070
我要打扁你，你这个臭德国佬！
I will bust you open, you dirty German!

46
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,910
你骂我什么？
What'd you call me?

47
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,990
我在法国和德国人打过仗
I fought the Germans in France.

48
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,380
非常艰巨的阵地相持战
And I fought them in the trenches.

49
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,190
上帝保佑！那些可怕的事情别再发生了
And I pray to God no one ever has to see the things that I saw.

50
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,110
你是我最好的朋友
You're my best friend.

51
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,440
爸，等等！
Daddy, wait!

52
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,180
爸，等等我
Daddy, wait.

53
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,830
阿道夫・希特勒把德国变成了战争机器
整个欧洲都陷入了战火
Adolf Hitler builds the German military machine and drags all of Europe into war.

54
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,770
即使希特勒占领了法国
但美国仍拒绝加入战局
But even while France falls to Hitler, America still refuses to join the fighting.

55
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,010
(米歇空军基地)

56
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,180
(一九四一年一月，长岛)

57
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,090
麦考利和沃克在哪儿？
Where's McCawley and Walker?

58
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,390
还在进行飞行训练
Still training, sir.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,660
丹尼！让我们教他们什么叫开飞机
来“老鹰捉小鸡”，准备好了吗？
All right, Danny. Now let's show them how to fly. We're gonna play chicken. You ready?

60
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,200
这可不是农场的飞机，我不玩
This ain't the farm, and these ain't no cropdusters. I'm not playing chicken with you.

61
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,930
别当胆小鬼，让我告诉你…
Now don't be a baby. I'll tell you what...

62
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,730
我不玩儿，雷夫
I'm not doing it, Rafe.

63
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,930
那我冲你来了，你可以躲开
也可以和我相撞，你看着办吧
Well, I'm coming right at you. You can turn, or you can hit me. It's up to you.

64
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,050
搞什么？
What the...

65
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,270
完了
Oh, boy.

66
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,580
你为什么总是害我，雷夫？
Why you always busting my ass, Rafe?

67
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,250
你从哪边过？
Which way you going?

68
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,920
我想从右边…不，左边，我从左边
I guess I'll go right. No, uh, left. I'll go left.

69
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,520
我们从左边，是吗？
OK, we're going left, right?

70
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,120
嗯，是右边，右边吗？
Ri... uh, right. Right?

71
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,060
右边是指我们从右边过
还是指我们从左边过？
Right like we're going right, or right like we're going left?

72
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,400
你把我搅糊涂了！我不知道，你说吧
Well, now you got me all mixed up! I don't know. Make up your mind.

73
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,110
上帝啊，雷夫，我们从右边！右边！
God, Rafe, we're going right! Righty-tighty!

74
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,720
他们真是王牌飞行员
Those are some smooth aces.

75
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,750
你说什么？
Did you say something?

76
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,150
我告诉你们，这两个乡巴佬被禁飞了！
'Cause let me tell you, those farm boys are grounded!

77
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,290
是的，长官… 决不允许拿军用飞机冒险
Yes, sir, an entirely unacceptable use... of m-m-military aircraft, sir.

78
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,160
拿我的帽子来
是的，长官
Get my hat. Yes, sir.

79
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,970
叫这些亡命徒去杜立特办公室
Get those hedge-hoppers in Doolittle's office.

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,730
已经训练两年了…
After two years of training...

81
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,540
你们以为造价四万五千美元的
战斗机是用来玩吗？
you believe that a $45,000 airplane... is there for your amusement?

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,130
不是，长官，我只是磨练技巧
No, sir. I was just trying... to keep my edge, Major.

83
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,610
上礼拜你玩空中翻筋斗
也是为了磨练技巧吗？
And when you did the outside loop last week... what did you think that was? Honing your skills?

84
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,180
那不是飞行技巧！麦考利
是哗众取宠！
That's not training, McCawley. That's a stunt.

85
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,560
也是愚蠢和不负责的行为
And I personally consider it to be reckless... and irresponsible.

86
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,550
少校
Major...

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,020
怎么会啊，你可是那招的开山鼻祖
How could that be, when you're famous for being the first man in the world ever to do it?

88
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,260
别跟我耍嘴皮子
Don't get cute with me, son.

89
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,500
我没有耍嘴皮子，长官
请恕我直言，我只是认为…
No, sir, I don't mean to be disrespectful. I just think that... well, I...

90
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,100
如果仅仅只是为了出风头
这是愚蠢和不负责的
It is reckless and irresponsible if you're just doing it to be a show-off.

91
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,170
但我这样是为了启发战友
就像您当初启发我一样
But I was doing it to try to inspire the men, sir... in the way that you've inspired me.

92
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,310
有句成语能够用来形容我对您的钦佩
I believe the French even have a word for that...

93
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,610
法国人称之为五体投地
when the men get together to honor their leaders. They call it an homage, sir.

94
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,280
什么？
A what?

95
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,250
是五体投地，长官
这全是屁话，麦考利
An homage, sir. That's bullshit, McCawley!

96
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,650
但它是很中听的屁话
But it's very, very good bullshit.

97
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,820
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, sir.

98
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,300
麦考利，你就像十五年前的我
McCawley, you remind me of myself fifteen years ago.

99
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,370
我们现在讨论一下这个
Which is why we need to discuss this.

100
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,700
坐下，年轻人
Have a seat, son.

101
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,970
英国人已经接受你加入雄鹰中队
The British have accepted you into the Eagle Squadron.

102
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,280
如果你愿意，明天就可以动身
You're on your way to England tomorrow... if you still want to go.

103
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,790
飞行员是英国能否打退希特勒的关键
也决定着欧洲战场的走向
Just a few British pilots are all that stand between Hitler and total victory in Europe.

104
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,490
他们非常需要援助
They're gonna need all the help they can get.

105
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,190
我马上出发，长官
Yes, sir. Well, I'm on my way.

106
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,330
按照规定，我应该要求你再慎重考虑一下
Just for the record... I'm supposed to ask you to reconsider.

107
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,300
长官？
Sir?

108
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,970
不管我们是否愿意…
Sooner or later we're gonna be in this war...

109
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,470
…美国参战只是时间问题
whether we like it or not.

110
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,010
我们也需要优秀的飞行员
And I'm gonna need all of my best pilots.

111
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,210
所以我应该征询你是否愿意留下来
So it's my duty to ask you to stay.

112
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,440
少校，你会怎么做？
Major, what would you do?

113
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,520
如果是我…
If it was me...

114
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,560
我会去
I'd go.

115
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,280
不会吧，我开始谢顶了？
Get out. Am I going bald right back here?

116
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,200
伙计，我是个帅小伙
Man, I am one good-looking son of a bitch.

117
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,390
可千万别死
Don't you ever die.

118
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,300
打仗你死不了
今晚你就要装一副快死的样子
Die. That's exactly the concept you gotta work tonight.

119
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,530
往眼睛上抹点儿丁香油
You put a drop of this clove oil under your eyes...

120
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,270
快忍不住的时候就去找护士
做个深呼吸
and you let them sting and well up. You get your nurse alone, take a breath...

121
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,480
然后就热泪盈眶地对她说
宝贝，他们训练我去打仗…
let her see your eyes listen and say, "Baby, they're training me for war...

122
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,780
…我生死难测…
and I don't know what'll happen...

123
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,260
…如果明天我一去不返…
but if I die tomorrow...

124
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,360
…我盼望今晚我俩能共度春宵
" I want to know that we lived all we could tonight."

125
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,300
来吧，伙计们，漂亮护士在等着咱们
Come on, guys! We got nurses waiting.

126
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,960
快点，再不走比利的头就要秃光了
Come on, before the rest of his hair falls out.

127
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,830
你为什么要做这样的决定？
How could you do this?

128
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,640
是杜立特点名派我去的
他希望我能够接受实战训练
Well, Doolittle assigned me. He wanted me to get some real... real combat training in.

129
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,470
你想什么呢？
Well, guess what?

130
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,910
那儿可没有训练，只有战争
It's not training over there. It's war.

131
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,250
输家丢掉性命
赢家也一无所获
Where the losers die, and there aren't any winners...

132
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,750
大家都身心疲惫，就像我老爸那样
just guys who turn into broken-down wrecks... like my father.

133
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,890
我知道，我能理解，丹尼
Yeah, I understand that, Danny.

134
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,580
但是我觉得我有责仁去
But I feel like I got a duty to go.

135
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,580
见鬼，别和我扯什么责任
我和你一样都是军人
Don't preach to me about duty, damn it. I wear the same uniform you do.

136
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,530
如果真有必要，我也会去
可你为什么要这样求之不得？
Now, if trouble wants me, I'm ready for it. But why go looking for it?

137
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,760
听我说，丹尼
我快二十五岁了，已经算是个老兵
God, Danny, come on. I'm gonna be twenty-five. I might as well be an old man.

138
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,600
我很快就只能当飞行教官了
They're gonna have me being a flight instructor.

139
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,940
我不想当教官，我要开战斗机
I don't wanna teach loops and barrel rolls. I wanna be a combat fighter.

140
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,340
快点，护士们在等你们跳舞呢
Hey, come on! The nurses can't d-d-dance by themselves.

141
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,240
我们走吧
Let's go.

142
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,220
要是每天都和一百五十个
穿内裤的小伙子们打交道
If the call of duty means seeing 150 men in their underwear every day...

143
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,590
我们可不嫌枯燥
...we are here to serve.

144
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,130
想不到能在纽约度周末
I can't believe it. Saturday night in New York City.

145
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,200
在家乡太没意思了！
Do you know what they're doing where I come from?

146
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,330
什么都不能做，只能逗牛玩
Nothing. Cow-tipping.

147
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,700
所以你来当海军，想开开眼界？
Well, that's why you joined the Navy, hong. To get out of that dusty little town and see the world.

148
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,500
巴巴拉，我们是海军护士
可不是来旅游的
May I remind you, Barbara, we're Navy nurses, not tourists.

149
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,070
我当海军是来尽义务，还想找个男朋友
I joined to do my patriotic duty and to meet guys.

150
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,870
我也是
Me, too.

151
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,880
我们今晚玩个痛快！
Girls, we're gonna have so much fun tonight in the city.

152
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,780
给大家讲讲你的故事吧，伊夫琳
You've gotta tell them the story, Evelyn.

153
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,910
什么？
What?

154
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,620
说呀，告诉我们
Oh, come on. Tell us.

155
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,280
噢，说来话长
Oh, it's such a long story.

156
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,290
我们时间多的是
We got time.

157
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,990
我亲眼目睹哦
I saw it happen.

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,160
那是四个星期前
Well, it was about four weeks ago...

159
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,500
你认为怎样更好点？
What do you think is b-b-better?

160
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,160
都打在一边，还是分开打？
All in the one cheek, or spreading them out?

161
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,400
好吧
OK.

162
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,570
福斯科・安东尼
Fusco Anthony.

163
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,150
你没事吧？老兄
You all right, buddy?

164
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,240
甜心，真的要打针吗？
Sweetie, do you really have to do this?

165
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,680
我在军营可不会染上黄热病
I'm not gonna get yellow fever in my barracks.

166
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,850
不会吗？如果你愿意，可以让她打
No? If you'd rather, she can do it.

167
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,930
喔，喔，稍微等一下…
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just give me a minute.

168
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,420
亲爱的，上头说要给你们打，我们就得打
Honey, the government says stick them, we stick them.

169
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,800
雷德，你没事吧？
Uh! Hey, Red, you allright?

170
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,180
四号，测验视力
Eye exam number four?

171
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,840
医生，我都检查过十几次啦！
Listen, Doc, I have passed a dozen medical checks.

172
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,850
你要这样写，我就飞不成了
You write that, they won't let me fly.

173
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,850
很抱歉，年轻人
Sorry, son. I'm gonna fail.

174
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,050
(不合格)

175
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,460
糟糕，他们会折断我的翅膀
They're gonna take my wings away.

176
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,720
不会的，放轻松
No, they won't. Just relax.

177
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,420
读最后一行
Read the bottom line, please.

178
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,260
再背一遍最后一行
放心，我在后面
Just keep practicing the bottom line. And don't worry. I'm right behind you.

179
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,800
谢谢
Thank

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,970
下一个
Next.

181
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,630
小姐
Ma'am.

182
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,770
“J”、“L”、“M”、“K”、“P”
“O”、“E”、“T”、“X”
JLMKPOETX

183
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,710
简直像老鹰的眼睛一样
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.

184
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,750
慢点儿，飞行员，别看下边的
Slow down, flyboy. And, instead of the bottom,

185
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,640
读最上面一行， 用双眼看
read the very top. Both eyes.

186
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,050
“C”…抱歉，“J”
Yeah. "C"...sorry, "J."

187
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,850
“C”、“W”
Ahem. "C"..."W." "W."

188
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,130
“Q”，“Q”，“Q”
Q... Q...

189
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,500
请再读一遍最后一行
Read the bottom line again, please.

190
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,230
这次从右向左，而且间隔着读
But read it right to left and every other letter.

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,150
“E”、“X”
"E."Heh. "X."

192
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,180
“X”“E”
XE

193
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,720
“X”“E”…
XE...

194
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,520
护士小姐，我看得很清楚
X-E, ma'am. Ma'am, I know how this looks.

195
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,690
抱歉，中尉，真的很抱歉
陆军和海军的都要求视力达到二点零
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I really am. But Army and Navy requires 20/20 vision.

196
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,460
我的眼睛没有问题，我看得见
Oh, I... it's... it's not a problem with my eyes, I can see.

197
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,430
我的意思是，我的眼睛棒极了
我可以一枪打死狂奔的野兔
I mean, I can see. I mean, I can hit a running rabbit with a $3.00 pistol.

198
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,100
我只是阅读字母有点困难，仅此而已
I got a problem with letters, that's all.

199
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,430
那只有先去上学，再回来复查
Well, maybe after some schooling... you could come back and take the test again.

200
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,000
不，我上过学，老师也拿我没办法
No, I had schooling. I mean, I... the teachers just never knew what to make of it.

201
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,320
只是字母而已，有的时候我常把
它们的顺序弄颠倒，就是这样
It's just letters. I mix them up sometimes. That's all.

202
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,520
我的意思是，我只是把它们倒过来读
I mean, I just get them backward sometimes.

203
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,620
你看，我的数学、航空理论
还有口试，成绩都是优
L-look here. Uh, my... my math and... and spacial reasoning and my verbal scores are all excellent.

204
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,620
但是你的写作成绩才刚及格
But you barely passed the written exam.

205
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,970
毕竟他及格了，总该我了吗？
Yeah, but he did pass it. So, is it my turn now?

206
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,190
还没有，你再等一下
No, you'll wait your turn.

207
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,120
好的，护士小姐
Yes, ma'am.

208
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,330
护士小姐，我不是来这儿教语言的
Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna be an English teacher.

209
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,490
我来这儿是为了当飞行员
But I know why I'm here. To be a pilot.

210
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,920
鬼才拿着课本上天打仗
And you don't dogfight with manuals. You don't fly with gauges.

211
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,700
我是说，开飞机关键得看感觉敏锐
反应迅速，还有是否能够与飞机融为一体
I mean, it's all about feeling and speed... and letting that plane become like a part... of your body.

212
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,010
没人说阅读能力差，就当不了好飞行员
And that manual... says that a guy who's a slow reader can't be a good pilot.

213
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,950
档案上都说我是这儿的最棒的飞行员
That file says I'm the best pilot in this room.

214
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,320
护士小姐，求求你，别让我停飞
Ma'am, please, don't take my wings.

215
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,520
嗯，我感到很为难
Well, I felt so bad.

216
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,290
伊夫琳，到三号台去
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

217
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,490
我别无选择
I had no choice.

218
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,430
放他过关了
I passed him.

219
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,150
一会儿，这个飞行员又来了
So, then this cocky pilot comes back.

220
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,570
哎，小伙子，你是新兵？
Say, fella, are you enlisted?

221
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,640
是的
Yeah.

222
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,730
“是的”？
年轻人，你在和军官说话吗？
"Yeah"? Boy, you're talking to an officer.

223
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,780
是，长官
对不起，长官
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

224
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,810
把档案给我
是，长官
Give me that file. Yes, sir.

225
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,470
稍息
是，长官
Parade rest. Yes, sir.

226
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,340
护士小姐，我还没来得及谢谢你
Ma'am, I didn't get a chance to thank you.

227
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,210
裤子脱下来
Drop your skivvies.

228
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,150
啊，哦，好吧
Ah, oh, OK.

229
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,110
像这样？
Just like this?

230
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,920
很好
That's fine.

231
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,890
他的屁股很翘
He did have a very cute butt.

232
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,100
我知道您本不该让我过关的
但却您帮了我
You know, I know you didn't have to pass me and you did.

233
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,660
我以为你不明白我的意思
但是你却很清楚
And I just... I didn't think you'd understand, and you did.

234
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,960
知道吗，你还没感谢我呢
You know, you still haven't said thank you.

235
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,600
谢谢你
Thank you.

236
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,000
不客气
You're welcome.

237
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,400
我想知道您为什么帮我？
我只是很好奇
Why'd you do it? I mean, I'm just curious.

238
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,910
您现在是我的偶像了
You're like my hero now.

239
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,070
事实上，我父亲曾经是飞行员，我知道…
Actually, my father was a pilot. And, um, I've seen first-hand what happens...

240
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,740
…飞行员停飞的滋味
when a pilot loses his wings.

241
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,480
知道吗，您父亲也是我的偶像了
You know what? Your father's my hero, then, too.

242
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,050
作为一名军官，我想今晚请你…
In fact, as an officer, I think it'd by my duty...

243
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,050
…我的新偶像的女儿吃饭
是我应该做的
...to take my new hero's daughter out tonight just to...

244
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,090
啊！
有点儿深了吧？
aah! Gosh, did I poke too deep?

245
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,830
您好象扎进骨头了
I think you hit the bone there.

246
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,630
你太过分了
You are so mean.

247
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:31,240
难道您真不愿意…给我个机会？
What? So is... is there any chance... that you might, kind of, sort of... you know, like me, or...

248
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,010
你想什么呢？
Oh, how did you guess?

249
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,850
我的头儿没教我体验这种感觉
They never taught us... how to deal with this... feeling.

250
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,110
什么感觉？
Wh-what feeling?

251
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,320
像是…这样
Well, it's kind of like... this.

252
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,960
他再放肆，我还要扎他
Well, he was getting fresh, so I poked him again.

253
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,830
嗨，罗密欧，我可不想找罪受
All right, Romeo. I want to get this over with.

254
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,070
等一下
Hold on a second.

255
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,510
我真的很想“舔”你
Miss... I really, really lick you.

256
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,040
他说什么？
What did he mean?

257
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,140
喜欢你，我舌头打结了
Like you. I didn't mean to say that. And I just, um...

258
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,090
我很想请你一起“送”饭
I just want to ask you, please, if I can donate dinner.

259
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,120
他开始语无伦次了
He started to act very strange.

260
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,050
我郑重地邀请你
Or, well, buy you dinner.

261
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,660
这不是你的档案
This isn't your chart.

262
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,400
不…这是那个家伙的，我想他落下了
Whoa. No. That's the, uh, this, uh, fellow over here's. I think he left.

263
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,940
你打过针了？
Have you already had this shot?

264
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,770
是的，嗯，已经打过一次了
Yeah, well, once... already.

265
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,770
嗯，我想…我的意思是
我可以约你出去吗？
Well, I wanted... I mean, can I ask you out?

266
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,710
不行
No!

267
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,110
突然，他一头栽到地上
And he just went wham!

268
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,190
噢！你对他怎么了？
Oh! What'd you do to him?

269
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,280
可怜的家伙
Poor guy.

270
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,720
噢，老天，你没事吧？
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

271
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,570
嗯，没事，我没事，很好
Yeah, I'm fine, I feel great.

272
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,640
这样能起保护作用
This is just standard precautionary... thing.

273
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,370
看，我搞到些好东西
一瓶正宗的法国香槟
Look, I got some, uh, genuine French champagne... from France.

274
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,310
我想，也许我们该好好庆祝一下
I thought, you know, maybe we could celebrate.

275
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,710
庆祝什么？
Celebrate what?

276
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,710
噢，我也不知道
怎么说呢，庆祝你成了我的偶像
Oh, I don't know. Uh, well, you being my hero, for one.

277
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,750
好吧，为什么不呢？
OK. Why not?

278
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,470
我很感激你，感谢你…
So, uh, ahem... I wanted to thank you. And I just wanted to, uh...

279
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,320
…你让我通过了体检
put your mind at ease about passing me...

280
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,570
因为我真的想为国家尽一份力
because I really do think you did this country a service.

281
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,610
我的意思是…我是一名王牌飞行员
I mean, I'm... I am a great flier.

282
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,120
要说你缺点的话，那就是骄傲
And if you have a fault, which you obviously don't, it's modesty

283
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,680
不，如果说我有缺点…
…那就是直率
No. If I have a fault, it's candor.

284
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,140
你真的很…
You are just so...

285
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,290
瓶塞崩着我了
Cork just got away from me.

286
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,620
天啊
God

287
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,990
天啊，噢，真疼
God, oh, it hurts.

288
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,330
疼死啦
It hurts something fierce.

289
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,700
对不起
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,970
噢…噢，流血了
Ohh... Oh, it's bleeding.

291
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,410
天啊
God.

292
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,070
躺下…我总是惹事生非
Lay still. I ruined everything.

293
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,910
别乱动
好痛
Lay still. Oh, it hurts.

294
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,750
噢！太凉啦！
冰块能止血
Ow! It's cold. It'll stop the bleeding.

295
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,840
我无法喘气
Yeah. I can't breathe.

296
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,620
躺好
Lay still.

297
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,950
你美得真叫人心疼
You are so beautiful it hurts.

298
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,120
是你的鼻子疼
It's your nose that hurts.

299
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,860
不，是我的心疼
No. I think it's my heart.

300
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,770
于是我吻了他
And then I kissed him.

301
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,410
伊夫琳，这是我听过最浪漫的故事
Oh, Evelyn. That's the most romantic story I ever heard.

302
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,380
这也是我这辈子
最浪漫的四个星期又两天
It's been the most romantic four weeks and two days of my life.

303
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,820
我好羡慕你
Oh, I'm so jealous.

304
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,710
见到你真好，护士小姐
Hello, Lieutenant. It's good to see you.

305
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,940
我也是，中尉
You, too, Lieutenant.

306
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,180
挑一只手
Pick a hand.

307
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

308
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,160
那只手有什么？
What's in your other hand?

309
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,700
是我的
Mine.

310
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,330
我花了六小时才折好
Well, it took me six hours to fold these.

311
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,730
介绍一下我的朋友，雷夫
I want you to meet my friends.

312
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,140
这是玛莎、巴巴拉、桑得拉
Rafe, this is Martha, Barbara, Sandra...

313
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,970
嗨，我是贝蒂
Hi. I'm Betty. Hi.

314
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,140
你的朋友呢？
Would you happen to have any friends?

315
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,080
随便选吧
Huh. Take your pick.

316
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,300
如果仗打起来，而我光荣负伤
We ever get in this war and something happens to me...

317
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,150
有你这样温柔的姑娘照顾我…
I can't tell you how good it makes me feel to know...

318
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,120
…让我恢复健康，那种感觉真的是太棒了
...that someone as sweet as you will be there to nurse me back to health.

319
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,620
可我们还没参战呢
Good, but we're not in the war yet.

320
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,190
嗨，那都是玩笑
OK. That was a bad line.

321
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,660
我…我是雷德…雷德…
I'm... I'm Red, Red...

322
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,530
…奇怪
S-s-s-s-strange.

323
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,700
你姓奇怪吗？
Your last name's Strange?

324
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,040
她是你的了
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.

325
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,700
不，我姓温…
No. It... it's Winkle.

326
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,170
雷德真有女人缘
Red is such a ladiesg man.

327
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,580
你总是结巴？
Do you always stutter?

328
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,380
不，只是在…
No. Only when I'm...

329
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,450
她上勾了
She's totally buying it.

330
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,380
紧张的时候？
是啊
Nervous? Yeah.

331
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,350
为什么我碰不上漂亮妞？
Why can't I get something like that? Hello. Hi.

332
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,270
丹尼和姑娘在一起太腼腆
Danny seems kind of shy around the girls.

333
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,400
他不是腼腆
Tsk. It's not that he's shy.

334
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,100
他只是…缺乏自信
He's just, ahem... a little unsure of himself, you know.

335
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,610
是他老爸呵斥的结果
His old man used to run him down a lot.

336
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,650
一上飞机，他就判若两人
Get him in a plane, he's sure of himself.

337
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,650
他是我的好兄弟、好朋友
He's like my brother. He's like my best friend.

338
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,590
如同我的右手
He's my right hand.

339
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,990
可现在你的手滑到我的腰部以下了
Which at the moment is a long way south of my waist.

340
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,660
对不起，我滑的太低了
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I lost a little altitude.

341
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,830
是啊，我想你是的
Yeah, I guess you did.

342
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,690
失陪一下
Excuse me.

343
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,380
我们得好好聊聊
You and me, we got to talk.

344
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,150
听说海军要派我们去珍珠港
So, the rumor is the Navy's shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

345
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,420
那挺好啊
Well, won't be so bad.

346
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,360
那儿离战场很远
It's about as far from the fighting as you can get.

347
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,230
可以享受一下温暖的阳光
You'll get a suntan.

348
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,360
也许你也会被调到那儿
So maybe the Army'll post you guys there, too.

349
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,330
你是一个特别了不起的女人
You... are a super special woman.

350
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:46,310
他们把我训练成彪悍的勇士
they're... they're training me... to be a big bad warrior, and, well...

351
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,880
明天可能就去出生入死
So, I mean, you never know what might happen tomorrow

352
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,350
谁知道会发生什么，你了解吗？
所以…
... or... or any day after that, you know? So...

353
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,860
…今晚我们应该有点特别的
God, we need to make tonight super special.

354
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,160
你哭什么？
Why are you crying?

355
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,370
我怕再也见不到你了
I guess it's the thought... that I might not ever get to see you again.

356
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,340
别哭啦，宝贝儿，今晚我是你的
Dry your eyes, toots. Tonight, you're mine.

357
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,200
今晚我不想到人多的地方去
我希望和你单独在一起
I don't want to be with a crowd tonight. I just want to be alone with you.

358
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,110
去看看月光下的纽约港？
How does New York Harbor by moonlight sound?

359
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,380
你想当坏蛋？
Are you gonna be a bad influence?

360
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,420
干吗不当个坏蛋呢？
Of course I'm a bad influence.

361
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,520
我们是军官 可以征募这艘船
Let's see if we can commandeer this vessel... 'cause we're, uh, officers of the U.S. Government.

362
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,530
别高兴的太早
Not for long, we won't be.

363
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,840
也许将来我们能坐这艘船旅行
One day, we'll take a trip on a boat like that.

364
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,340
你喜欢这艘船？
Would you like that?

365
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,540
在大厅里参加鸡尾酒会
We'll be dressing for cocktails and walk into the grand salon.

366
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,540
(玛丽皇后号)

367
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,350
没有人谈论战争
大家都随着舞曲翩翩翩翩起舞
No one's talking about war. They're just dancing to Cole Porter.

368
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,550
我要穿晚礼服
I'll have to get a tux.

369
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,310
是啊
Yeah.

370
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,450
上来，开船了
Come on. There you go. All aboard.

371
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,660
我不是这个意思
You're out of your mind.

372
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,930
是啊，小心，坐好
Oh, yeah. Careful now. Here, sit down.

373
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,870
看我的
Now let's see here.

374
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,200
快到了
Ah! There we go.

375
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,650
我要让你登上你喜欢的船
See, this is as close as I could get you to your ship.

376
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,110
怎么样？
So, at least I tried, right?

377
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,710
我已经很满足了
这太好了
Actually, you know what? This is better.

378
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,090
老天，你真美啊
Yeah, it is. God, you're pretty.

379
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,700
(上，下)

380
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,540
往后我们会怎么样？雷夫
What's gonna become of us all, Rafe?

381
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,050
嗯，我们左右不了未来，对吗？
Well, the future's not exactly in our hands, is it?

382
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,120
是的，你是对的
No. I guess you're right.

383
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,830
天啊，你没事儿吧？
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

384
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,960
没事儿，你呢？
Yeah, are you?

385
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,730
计划中可没有这出
That was not part of the date.

386
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,410
小心地面
喔，谢谢
Watch your step. Oh, thank you.

387
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,980
伊夫琳
Evelyn!

388
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,110
伙计们，快上来吧
Guys, come up! Come on up!

389
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,720
我们在三二一号房
Come up! We're in 321.

390
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,990
我要跟你说一件事
There's something I got to tell you.

391
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,720
你对我没有秘密可言
Well, you got no secrets from me, Lieutenant.

392
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,820
我看过你的体格检查表，知道你的一切
I've seen your medical chart.

393
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,400
是坏消息？还是有难言之处？
This can't be good, or it wouldn't be so hard to say.

394
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,200
是啊
Yep.

395
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,500
我要被调走
I got to go away.

396
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,000
我们都要被调走
We're all going away. Yeah...

397
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,870
没错
Yep.

398
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,580
但是我是去打仗，明天就动身
but I'm going to the war... tomorrow.

399
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:19,220
我要加入飞鹰中队，他们需要美国飞行员
I'm flying with the Eagle Squadron. It's an outfit the British started for American pilots.

400
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,860
我不明白
I don't understand.

401
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,130
你是为美国军队服役
他们怎么能命令你去英国？
You're in the U.S. Army. How could they order you to go?

402
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,700
他们没有下命令，是我自愿的
They didn't order me. I volunteered.

403
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,380
我让你通过体检，是我放你过关的
But I passed you. I let you through.

404
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,610
现在你却自愿去最危险的地方？
And now you volunteer... for the most dangerous place you could go?

405
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,980
这和你没关系，你没有责任
It's not your responsibility, not your choice.

406
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,300
飞行曾经是我唯一的梦想
Flying's the only thing I ever wanted to do.

407
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,690
对我来说，我之所以活着，是为了…
I mean, everything in my life has led me up to this point.

408
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,300
…能够与你相遇
Meeting you.

409
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,140
我爱你
I love you.

410
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,610
我深深地爱着你
I love you so much.

411
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,770
我们进去吧
Let's go inside.

412
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,250
好的
等等，我不能这样做
All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

413
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,920
对不起，我只是…
Just... I...

414
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,200
我不能这样做…我的意思是…
我是非常渴望…
See,I can't do this. I mean, I mean, I can. I... I want to.

415
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,470
你知道我并不是假装高尚
或者谎称我不知道要发生什么
I'm not trying to be noble, you know. Or not saying I know what would happen or just...

416
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,200
我最好还是别说了
... I need to stop talking.

417
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,640
我只是…我只是不想…
我只是不想跟别人一样
I just... I just don't want...I just don't want it to be like everybody else.

418
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,910
今晚我不想给你留下任何遗憾
I don't want you to have anything about tonight... that you regret.

419
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:56,150
今晚对我一生至关重要
我不想破坏它
I mean, it's been the most incredible night of my life... and I don't want to ruin that.

420
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
你当然不会破坏它
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.

421
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,630
如果我只能再活一晚
我也要与你共度
If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with you.

422
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,840
这也是我的期盼
这就是我一生的梦想
See, that's what I want to come home to. That's what I want to have to think about and dream about.

423
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:17,330
我要回来与你共度美好的生活
I want to know that the best part of my life... is still ahead of me.

424
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,550
不要…
Look. Don't, um...

425
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,020
请你不要来送我
could you... not come see me off?

426
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,610
现在跟你道别已经够难过了
Because, uh... saying good-bye to you once is hard enough.

427
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,530
来
Here.

428
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,920
戴上这个
Take this.

429
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,190
我戴上它好看吗？
You think it looks good on me?

430
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,340
我很快就会回来的
I will come back.

431
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,840
你不是叫她别来吗？
I thought you said you told her not to come.

432
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,040
没错
Yeah, I did.

433
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,040
那你干嘛还在找她？
Why you looking for her then?

434
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,780
这是个考验
It's my test.

435
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,690
我叫她别来她还是来了
就说明她真的非常爱我
If I tell her not to come, and she comes anyway... then I... I know she loves me.

436
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,280
请五十七站台的乘客上车
All aboard! Track 57!

437
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,890
如果我发生意外，你一定告诉他，好吗？
If, uh, anything happens to me... I want you to be the one to tell her. All right?

438
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,200
为了我和他，你要活着回来
You just make sure and come back for the both of us, all right?

439
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,080
等我回来，再见了
好的
See you when I get back. Yeah.

440
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,090
好好干，雷夫
Good hunting, Rafe.

441
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,150
伊夫琳…
Evelyn!

442
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,920
伊芙琳…
Evelyn!

443
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,690
伊夫琳！伊夫琳！嘿
Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn. Hey!

444
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,730
她爱我
She loves me.

445
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,880
德国空军开始轰炸伦敦市中心
The German Luftwaffe relent lessly bombards downtown London...

446
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:17,920
英国皇家空军为了捍卫领空
陷入艰辛的苦战
while Churchill's Royal Air Force is in a deadly struggle to maintain control of the British skies.

447
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,640
简直是破铜烂铁
This is a real mess.

448
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,840
麦考利中尉报到，长官
Lieutenant McCawley reporting for duty, sir.

449
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,210
很好，我们先安排你住下
We'll get you settled into your quarters.

450
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,490
然后带你去看看你要飞的破烂飞机
And then introduce you to the crate you'll be flying.

451
00:31:54,590 --> 00:32:00,460
长官，看你们都在这忙着
我还是直接上飞机吧
If you all are patching up bullet holes here maybe we ought to skip housekeeping and get me in an airplane.

452
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,760
两架飞机没有返航，只剩十一架
Two didn't come back, sir. We counted only eleven.

453
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,340
象你这样的美国人都急着去送死吗？
飞行员
Are all Yanks as anxious as you to get themselves killed, Pilot Officer?

454
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,880
我不想送死，我只想打仗
Not anxious to die, sir. Just anxious to matter.

455
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,850
这是你的战斗机
This is yours.

456
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,630
他是好样的
Good chap.

457
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,100
直到着陆关闭引擎后才闭上眼睛
Didn't die till he'd landed and shut down his engine.

458
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,800
请坐，先生们
Please be seated, gentlemen.

459
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,480
我的心情很沉重
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.

460
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,780
刚才邱吉尔和斯大林问我
我也要问问你们
Churchill and Stalin are asking me what I'm asking you.

461
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,560
美国还要假装世界大战没有发生多久？
How long is America going to pretend the world is not at war?

462
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,460
我们提供了大量的食品和油料
总统先生，就我所知…
We've increased food and oil shipments, Mr. President and as far as I know

463
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,530
他们需要坦克、战斗机、大炮
子弹还有士兵
What they really need are tanks, planes bullets, bombs, and men to fight.

464
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,630
可美国人还是认为希特勒和他
的纳粹党仅仅只是欧洲的问题
But our people think Hitler and his Nazi thugs are Europe's problem.

465
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,670
我们必须更积极些
We have to do more.

466
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,380
援助英国和苏联更多的军舰和防空武器
Send the Brits and Russians more of our ships and anti-aircraft weapons.

467
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,420
继续从太平洋舰队调拨？
And keep cannibalizing the Pacific Fleet?

468
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,990
还有更好的选择吗？
What choice do we have?

469
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,890
我们在制造冰箱，敌人却一直在制造炸弹
We're building refrigerators while our enemies build bombs.

470
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,190
战争已经不可避免了

471
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:48,230
掩盖事实只是失败

472
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:55,180
美军停止供应石油，切断了我们的生命线

473
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,340
我们只能维持十八个月

474
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,680
没有别的选择，只有战争

475
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:09,490
只有发动大规模的袭击

476
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,490
我们有这样的能力吗？

477
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:32,280
必须一仗消灭太平洋舰队

478
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,380
就在珍珠港

479
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,120
太令人激动了
This is so exciting.

480
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,720
珍珠港有大约一百多艘军舰
You know there's about one hundred ships on Pearl.

481
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,270
每一艘有多少水手？
How many sailors per ship?

482
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,800
那要看情况而定
军舰上的水手比潜艇上的多
It depends. More on a battle ship than a sub.

483
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,270
平均下来…有两千个？
But say, on average... 2,000?

484
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,540
加上飞行员、陆战队员，还有基地后勤
Then there's the flyers, the marines, base personnel.

485
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,370
我还在算水兵人数
I'm still working on the sailors.

486
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,410
反正我们的机率很高
Girls, I think the odds are in your favor.

487
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,480
是啊，一比四千
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.

488
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,910
这儿是天堂
It's paradise.

489
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,850
海滩上见了，帅哥们
See you on the beach, boys!

490
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,450
我们在夏威夷耶
We're in Hawaii!

491
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,830
嘿！你别在我的飞机上画奶子
Hey! You're not supposed to paint titties on the side of my airplanes.

492
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,600
要画也不能一大一小
And if you do, don't make them lopsided.

493
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,300
真玩意儿就是这样，厄尔
They were lopsided, Earl.

494
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:31,970
瞧，书上说，不能在礁石和暗桩处冲浪
Look, it says right here."Never ride waves amongst rocks or submerged pilings."

495
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,410
看，不能那样干
See, it says you shouldn't do that.

496
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,640
你怎么能知道哪有暗礁哪没有？
How do you know they're submerged if they're submerged?

497
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,280
古斯，你到底在干什么？
Gooz, what in the hell are you doing?

498
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,340
为他修冲浪板，被礁石撞坏了
Just trying to fix this surfboard thing. He keeps taking chunks off his nose on the rocks.

499
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,990
放假的时候还要继续搞我的新发明
古斯水平舵
On my day off, I'm working on my new invention, the Gooz Cruise Fin.

500
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,590
我要发财啦！
所有的冲浪板都需要加装我的水平舵
I'm gonna be a rich fella. Every surfboard in the nation's gonna need one.

501
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,330
你最好打扫干净
Yeah? Well, you're gonna need a broom.

502
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,830
瞧瞧新来的菜鸟
Check out these new recruits.

503
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,900
嗨，哈
Hi. Aloha.

504
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,770
你们是飞行员吗？
You all pilots?

505
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,910
好像很复杂
上面有不少开关和按钮
We're working on it. It's a lot of switches and stuff.

506
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,690
太平洋的骄傲
Pride of the Pacific.

507
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,680
你们是谁？
Who are you?

508
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,850
空中杀手
Terrors of the skies.

509
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,590
欢迎，小姐们
Welcome, ladies.

510
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,560
等我解决了这个黑屁股，再带你们逛逛
I have to deal with toasty sunburnt fanny before I can show you around.

511
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,170
亲爱的伊夫琳 一切都出乎我的意料
Ow! Dear Evelyn. It's different than I thought it would be here.

512
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,240
这儿很冷、冷得刺骨
It's cold... so cold it goes deep into your bones.

513
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:50,050
但有一股暖流在我的胸中涌动
那就是我们的爱情
There is one place I can go to find warmth. That is to think of you.

514
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,850
我祈祷能早日回到你的身旁
I just wish I could be back there with you.

515
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,660
在这很难交到朋友
It's not easy making friends.

516
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,860
两天前，一对皇家飞行员夫妇
还和我们一起喝啤酒
Two days ago, I had a beer... with a couple of the RAF pilots.

517
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,360
昨天他们双双阵亡
Yesterday, both of them got killed.

518
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,610
亲爱的雷夫，我对你的思念难以叙说
Dear Rafe. I miss you so much.

519
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,750
千山万水将我们阻隔
It's so strange to be half a world away from you.

520
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,590
我咬住他了
I'm right on his tail!

521
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,030
打下一架
Got one!

522
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:43,600
黄昏，我注视着斜阳…
希望留住最后的余辉
Every night I look at the sunset... and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day...

523
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,170
用我的心温暖远方的爱人
and send it from my heart to yours.

524
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,790
家人吗？
Family?

525
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,650
女友，长官
我的意中人
Girl, sir. The girl.

526
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,390
许多人责怪美国人不参战
A lot of people frown on the Yanks for not being in this war yet.

527
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,700
我只想说，要是每个美国军人都跟你一样
I'd just like to say... if there are many more back home like you...

528
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,770
谁都不敢与美国为敌
God help anyone who goes to war with America.

529
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,770
礼仪分队，持枪！
Atten-hut! Attention on deck!

530
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,280
太平洋舰队总司令金梅尔上将登舰
Admiral Kimmel... Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, on deck.

531
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,720
士气很高昂，上校
Sharp presentation, Captain.

532
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,520
谢谢，将军
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.

533
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,920
已经四个月了
华盛顿闭口不谈日本的威胁
For four months now Washington's been blowing pink smoke about the threat from Japan.

534
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,690
这可能会影响我们的士气
我特别强调不能放松警惕
Could make us lose our fighting edge. I'm determined not to let that happen.

535
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,660
对不起，上校，将军，华盛顿急电
With your permission, Captain. Admiral, urgent, from Washington.

536
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:58,510
太平洋舰队正在积极准备对抗日本人
保卫覆盖半个地球的太平洋
I'm supposed to keep this fleet... battle-ready to take on the Japanese... cover half the damn globe.

537
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,060
现在他们却要调十二艘驱逐舰到大西洋
他们不知道我们也面临危险吗？
Now they want me to transfer another twelve destroyers to the Atlantic. Don't they know what we're facing out here?

538
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,120
他们认为欧洲的战事是最紧要的
They feel Europe is the greater danger.

539
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,090
有人考虑夏威夷的危险吗？
I'm assuming these risk assessments include Hawaii?

540
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,960
珍珠港水浅，敌人不能实施鱼雷攻击
而且受到潜艇的保护
Pearl Harbor is too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack. We're surrounded by sub nets.

541
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,990
唯一需要担心的是敌人破坏我们的飞机
All we need worry about is sabotage...

542
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,300
所以我们把飞机集中起来，方便保护
so we bunched our planes together to make them easier to protect.

543
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,900
距离是天然的屏障，将军
Distance is our ally, Admiral.

544
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,800
你们分析了所有的可能性，对吗？
You analysts got it all figured out, don't you?

545
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,780
聪明的敌人常常会出其不意
痛击你自以为很安全的地方
The smart enemy hits you exactly where you think you're safe.

546
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,900
我从观光飞机上

547
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,910
拍到军舰和空军基地的照片

548
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,910
这些军舰都停靠在一起

549
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,740
那是最明显的目标

550
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:15,060
为了适应水深我们改装了鱼雷

551
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,900
加装了木鳍…

552
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,230
鱼雷就可以在浅水中攻击

553
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,170
趁珍珠港还没有苏醒

554
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,270
我们要发起猛烈的攻击

555
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,190
我修理了液压和电器系统，长官
但是来不及修理油管
In coming! I fixed the hydraulics and electrics, sir, but the oil hoses still need attention.

556
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,740
启动引擎吧
Just crank it, lan!

557
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,270
祝你好运，长官
God speed you, sir.

558
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,750
红队，攻击轰炸机
蓝队，盯住战斗机
Red section, take the bombers. Blue section, look out for the fighters.

559
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:16,380
轰炸机在前方
咱们给他们点颜色瞧瞧
Bombers dead ahead. Let's dropin and give them a reception.

560
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,260
红二号，跟着我，爬高
攻击领头的轰炸机
Red Two, follow my lead, high side. Go right at the lead bomber.

561
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,290
好的，红一号
Following you, Red One.

562
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,500
打得好
Good hit! Good hit!

563
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,540
红一号，转回来攻击敌机
Red One, coming around, reset for the kill.

564
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,210
我锁定中间那一架
I have the middle bomber.

565
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,750
开火
Hammer down!

566
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,420
打中了，打得好，红二号
We got him. Nice shot, Red Two.

567
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,890
正前方有两架敌机
I got two M.E. s dead ahead.

568
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,170
我盯着他，让我来
I'm on him. I'm on his tail.

569
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,130
开火
Hammer down.

570
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,510
我打下一架
I got one of them!

571
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,950
我又打下一架
I got another one.

572
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,720
红一号，你的后面有一组编队
Red One, you got fighters all over your tail!

573
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,690
我受到攻击！我受到攻击！
I'm under fire! I'm taking fire!

574
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,190
红一号，快逃走，赶快拉高
Red One, get out of there. Pull up! Pull up!

575
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,430
油管破裂
Argh! I got an oil leak.

576
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,410
我什么也看不到了
Can't see a damn thing!

577
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,310
无法跳伞！座舱罩卡死了，我跳不出去
I can't bail! My canopy's stuck! I can't bail out!

578
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,630
敌机向我开火，红二号
He's on my tail, Red Two.

579
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,930
我被击中了！我被击中了！
I'm hit! I'm hit!

580
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,380
遇难信号！发信号！
Mayday! Mayday!

581
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,690
噢，我的天
Oh, my God.

582
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,300
我不想去教堂
I'm no good at church.

583
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,600
你怎么了？亲爱的
What do you mean, sweetie?

584
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,750
每当我走进去，开始忏悔…
When I'm up there getting my slate wiped clean...

585
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:54,040
我就想到我还会做错事儿
I can't help I'm thinking how to dirty it up again.

586
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,310
这有什么关系
Wow, this from a virgin!

587
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,350
我要去清点备用品
I got to inventory supplies.

588
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,320
烦死了，能安静一会儿吗？
Kill me now. Could you be any more boring?

589
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,610
别管她，她要写信给雷夫
Don't bother. Sunday, she writes Rafe...

590
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,990
平常写五页，假日写十页
ten pages instead of the usual five.

591
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,050
我真想谈恋爱
Gosh, I wish I was in love.

592
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,390
嘿，亲爱的
Hey, sweetheart.

593
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,930
她讨厌我
She hates me.

594
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,300
见到你真好，雷德
Good to see you, Red.

595
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,410
我也是，贝蒂
Good to see you, too, Betty.

596
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,650
想一起兜兜风吗？
You wanna come for a ride?

597
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,940
来吧
Come on.

598
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,270
太好了，我来当你的司机
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.

599
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,450
狠狠地扁他，兄弟
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!

600
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,830
做饭的，你还有两下子
You hit pretty hard... for a cook.

601
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,330
你赌谁赢？沃克
All right, Walker, who you got?

602
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,400
快点！要打完了
Come on! Get out there now!

603
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,830
我赌厨子
I'll take the cook.

604
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,330
为什么？你想输钱吗？
Why? You don't like money?

605
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,100
我赌五块
I'll put five on it.

606
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:00,870
好
Done.

607
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,210
对手是机师？
那家伙是头野牛，不好对付
Against a mechanic? That guy craps rivets.

608
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,780
刚从机舱里面出来感觉怎样？
阳光很刺眼吧，眼睛睁不开吧？
How's it feel up from the engine room? Sunlight bothering you?

609
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,850
他打得很猛！
移动！移动！
Ow. Man, he's getting all busted up!

610
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,760
过来，我告诉你，坐下来
Come here, we gotta talk. Get down here.

611
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,290
他伤不了你，他伤不了你
He can't hurt us. He can hurt us.

612
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,300
他伤得了我，我流血了
He can hurt us, he cut us. We bleeding.

613
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,900
流血？
Bleeding?

614
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,210
那只是小伤，看看这个
That's a scratch. See this?

615
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,810
黑哥们儿可都把血汗钱押在你身上了
This is the hard-earned greenbacks of every pot-scrubbing chop in this fleet.

616
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,450
要是你输了我们可就完了
Now if we don't win. Teeny here has to find another battle ship!

617
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,080
我不能空着手回亚利桑纳号
I'm not going back to the Arizona empty-handed.

618
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,950
别担心你的钱
Don't worry about the money.

619
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:48,520
我要把这家伙打回老家
让他滚回自己的机舱去
I'll send that smug engine-fixing snipe... back below decks where he belong.

620
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,130
加油，好兄弟！那混帐东西打了你老妈！
是个婊子养的！
We the man! He slapped your mama! Be a son of a bitch!

621
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,280
你瞧，好耶，多利
Look at this! All right, Dorie!

622
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,260
够了，够了
That's enough. That's enough.

623
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,760
我的钱呢？
Oh! Where's my money?

624
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,330
不行，他作弊
Nah, fight's rigged.

625
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,620
咱们发了！哈！哈！哈！
We're rich! Ha ha ha!

626
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,600
你是怎么受伤的？
How'd you get this?

627
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,070
拳击
Boxing.

628
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,310
你赢了吗？
Did you win?

629
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:37,810
是的，护士小姐
Yes, ma'am.

630
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,110
赢了会怎样？
What do you get for winning?

631
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,740
获得尊严
Respect.

632
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,150
拳头能打出尊严来吗？
So, why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?

633
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,850
我离开妈妈，离开德克萨斯
去当海军就是为了见见世面
I left my momma in Texas and joined the Navy to see the world...

634
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,790
为了做个受尊重的人
... become a man.

635
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,670
他们却叫我当厨子，甚至连厨子都不算
They made me a cook. Not even that.

636
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,100
还要为其他水兵收拾餐厅
I clean up after other sailors eat.

637
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,640
都两年了，我还没打过枪
Two years, they never even let me fire a weapon.

638
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,370
希望你永远不要碰枪
Well, let's hope you never have to.

639
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,840
是的，护士小姐
Yes, ma'am.

640
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,510
保重了，米勒士官
You take care, Petty Officer Miller.

641
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,950
你也是，护士小姐
You, too, ma'am.

642
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,590
你知道吗，他教我飞行
You know, he taught me to fly.

643
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:13,370
无论我遇到任何麻烦，我都不会束手无策
I always knew that no matter what trouble I got into... I'd never be in it alone.

644
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,560
他总会帮我渡过难关
He'd be there with me.

645
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,310
就是在天上他也逼着我超过别人
He was always pushing me to be better and faster.

646
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,220
他说你是个了不起的飞行员
He told me you were a great flier.

647
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:31,210
那天晚上他告诉我，他自愿去英国
It was the same night he told me he'd volunteered to go to England.

648
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,630
自愿？
Volunteered?

649
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,020
他跟我说他是被指派去的
He... he told me he'd been assigned.

650
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,570
他总是在设法保护我
He was always trying to protect me.

651
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:56,150
但是你知道吗？我看着镜子里面
穿着这身制服的自己…
But you know what? I look at myself in the mirror in this uniform...

652
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,180
…我都不知道我是谁
and I still don't know who I am.

653
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,790
我看起来像英雄吗？我感觉不是
I look like a hero... but I don't feel like it.

654
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:14,000
雷夫…他一向都是表里如一，不是吗？
Rafe... he always looked the part, didn't he?

655
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,330
他无法等到成为英雄的那一天了
He couldn't wait to be one.

656
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:46,000
敬雷夫・麦考利，最棒的飞行员
To Rafe McCawley. The best pilot...

657
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,030
我曾经最好的朋友
and the best friend I ever knew...

658
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,500
我一生最好的朋友
or ever will know.

659
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,700
敬雷夫
To Rafe.

660
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,650
(为国捐躯)

661
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,060
攻击训练正在进行中

662
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,670
为保证任务成功

663
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,630
高空轰炸及鱼雷攻击训练是极为重要的

664
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,970
只要偷袭顺利

665
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,840
美国人只有坐以待毙

666
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:37,010
制造大量的假情报麻痹美国人

667
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,380
特别要关注太平洋的主要目标

668
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,080
尤其是夏威夷，不能放松

669
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,620
你太英明了，山本大将

670
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:53,260
英明的人能避免战争

671
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,390
(一九四一年七月，华盛顿)

Look at this.

(海军情报局)

675
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:07,770
太平洋上到处都是日本人的电报
The Japanese are flooding the Pacific with radio traffic.

676
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,400
从巴拿马运河到东南亚都有
Everywhere from the Panama Canal to southeast Asia.

677
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,080
这不合乎逻辑，上校
There's no logical pattern, Captain.

678
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,950
对，这其中必有玄机
No. There's always logic.

679
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,380
他们知道我们在监听
They know we read their mail.

680
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,550
他们想让我们以为他们的舰队在向南移动
They're trying to make us think their fleet is moving south.

681
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,690
我不吃这一套，其中肯定有阴谋
I'm not buying it. Something, something's up.

682
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,430
否则，这也太明目张胆了
Otherwise, why would they take the trouble to bullshit me?

683
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,350
伊夫琳，我替你签收了这些信
Evelyn, I signed for these letters for you today.

684
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,050
从英国寄来的
They're from England.

685
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,650
雷夫的信
They're from Rafe.

686
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,350
很抱歉，伊夫琳，邮件比消息慢
I'm sorry, Evelyn. You know how long it takes mail to get here.

687
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,790

(新闻剪辑)

690
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,690
美国还在等待日本的和平答复
America still awaits Japan's response to peace proposals.

691
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:23,350
野村大使抵达首都华盛顿
Ambassador Nomura arrives in Washington...

692
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:27,450
希望他的到来能够达成
太平洋地区的和平协议
...in what could hopefully guarantee continued peace in the Pacific.

693
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:32,750
英国方面，邱吉尔宣称
只要美国支持我们就能获胜
On the British front, Churchill declares "Give us the tools, and we will finish the job."

694
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,570
皇家空军在英吉利海峡
誓死捍卫英国领空
The RAF has fought bravely against Hitler's ambition...

695
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,570
让希特勒的野心无法得逞
...to rule the skies over the Channel.

696
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,380
胜利来之不易
许多优秀飞行员献出了生命
Victory does not come without sacrifice.

697
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,870
伊夫琳
Evelyn!

698
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,740
丹尼，真巧啊
Danny. Hey. Some comedy, huh?

699
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,800
好久不见
我一直在进行训练
It's been a while. I've been logging a lot offlight hours.

700
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,620
我也一直碰不到你
I kinda been avoiding you, too.

701
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,190
你想不想…你…
Look... Do you...

702
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,390
你想吗？
Do you want to?

703
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,360
好啊
Sure, yeah.

704
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,010
我记得我七岁那年，有一次
I remember this one time when I was like, seven years old.

705
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:17,500
那时候我老是爱做一些小玩艺儿
I was always building gadgets and things.

706
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,600
雷夫让我给他做一对翅膀
他就能像他老爸一样飞行
He wanted me to build him some wings so he could fly like his daddy.

707
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,040
我说没有引擎就飞不了
I told him you can't fly without some kind of engine.

708
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:29,170
但是他不肯听，他说，我叫你做就做
But he wouldn't listen. "Danny, never mind that, just build them anyway."

709
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,350
我只好照办了，我爬到谷仓上…
So I did. And I'm up there...

710
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:34,860
…帮他把大翅膀绑在身上
strapping these big old wings on his back...

711
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,420
那是我们用偷来的废纸、胶水
和破布黏起来的
...that we made from paper and glue and these massive silk bloomers that we stole.

712
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:44,160
他的样子好蠢
我说，你不能这样从谷仓上跳下去
He looked so stupid, and I told him "You can't jump off the barn in these."

713
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:48,830
然后一声巨响，他摔断了一条腿
And bam! He busted his leg on a backhoe.

714
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,270
我好想念他
God, I miss him.

715
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,540
你想不到的是隔天他又爬上了屋顶
But don't you think that Rafe wasn't back up there next day.

716
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:05,850
包着石膏，还叫我把翅膀做一些调整
Cast and everything, telling me to make some adjustments on those wings.

717
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,550
你们看
Check this out!

718
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:14,230
塔希提岛，太平洋的中心
一千七百英里！帅呆了！
Crossroads of the Pacific. Tahiti - 1,700 miles! All right!

瞧， 贝蒂
Say, Betty...

720
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,060
不要，快起来
No, Betty! Get up!

721
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,090
怎么回事？雷德
What's going on, Red?

722
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,290
你要站起来
Stand up, please.

723
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,270
为什么？
What do you mean?

724
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,910
你站起来，我跪着
Just stand up. Stand...

725
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,920
雷德，快点，我们有订位耶
Betty... Red, come on! We got a dinner reservation.

726
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,620
等一下行吗？
Can I get a minute?

727
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:49,830
你发神经了？
What's the matter, you sick?

728
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,700
我不能求婚吗？
Can a guy propose?!

729
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,430
我太多话吗？
有时候我很唠叨，对不起
Am I talking too much? Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.

730
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,440
看！你们看这个！
Hold up! Look at this.

731
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,910
好了，别打扰他们，我们走吧
OK, let's get out of here. OK.

732
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,450
我该走了
I guess I should go.

733
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,020
别一等要三个月才能够再见到你，好吗？
Don't let it be three months before I see you again, all right?

734
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,220
我很开心
I had a good time.

735
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,530
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

736
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,060
要我送你回家吗？
Do you want me to walk you home?

737
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,670
不用，我自己回去
No, I'll be fine.

738
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,790
好吧
No...of course.

739
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,730
晚安，丹尼
Good night.

740
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,830
晚安
Good night.

741
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,860
我在想我能不能偶尔到你家…
I was just wondering if maybe I could come by some time...

742
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,960
…喝杯咖啡吃点东西什么的？
...get a cup of coffee or a piece of pie?

743
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,650
我这是在干嘛？好了
What am I doing? OK.

744
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,320
老天，你睡了
Oh! You were asleep.

745
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,870
对不起，你还穿着睡衣，丹尼
I'm sorry. Danny?

746
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:03,770
出了什么事？
Is something wrong?

747
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,340
没事，没什么
你好
No! Nothing's wrong. No problem. Hi!

748
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,270
是丹尼
It's just Danny.

749
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,700
我来是…你忘了这个
I... just... you... you forgot this.

750
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,200
噢，谢谢
Oh... thanks.

751
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:21,350
太麻烦你了，这么晚还送来
It was good of you to take the trouble to drop it over... now.

752
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:26,610
嗯，我想你可能用得着
你知道，也许明天一早
well, I thought you might need it. You know... maybe tomorrow morning.

753
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:29,830
你没带这个去上班…
If... not that you wear this to work, but...

754
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,900
…不过只是条手帕
No... it's a hankie.

755
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,040
对，没错
Right, right. Yeah.

756
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,480
我在想，也许哪天我能到你这来…
Listen, I was thinking maybe I could come by some time...

757
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,170
如果我给你打电话，我能来吗？
if I gave you a call, could I come by some time?

758
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,510
如果你一旦有空的话，也许…
Once, maybe... if you're not busy?

759
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,880
嗯，也许吧
Yeah, maybe.

760
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,550
好吧，好的，谢谢
OK, all right. Thanks.

761
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,520
晚安
Good-bye.

762
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,460
你是个白痴！
You are such an idiot!

763
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,050
昨晚你和丹尼怎么样？
Did you have fun last night?

764
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,550
不是你想象那样的
It wasn't how it looked.

765
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,680
就算是，也没关系的
And if it was, it'd be all right.

766
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,620
已经好几个月了，你得继续过日子
It's been months. It's time to move on.

767
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,060
我很好啊
I am moving on.

768
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,790
你别骗人，我知道
晚上我都听见你在哭泣
Ev, don't lie. All I know is, I hear you crying when you think I'm asleep.

769
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,730
我爸抛弃我们以后
When my dad left... I was too much for my mom to handle...

770
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,830
我妈就把我送到姑妈家
...so she sent me to live with my aunt.

771
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,390
我以为我这辈子就完蛋了
但是你并不知道接下来会怎样
I thought my life was over... But you don't know where it's all gonna lead.

772
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,030
如果我没有从家里面逃出来，谎报年龄…
If I hadn't run away and lied about my age...

773
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:38,830
…参加海军，我就不会认识雷德
...and enlisted in the Navy... I wouldn't have met Red,

774
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,840
现在他是我的未婚夫了
and... now he's my fiance.

775
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,910
我真不习惯这种称呼
Oh, God, I can't get used to that word.

776
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,520
不过才十二小时而已
It's only been twelve hours.

777
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,880
噢，贝蒂！
小贝蒂比我们都厉害
Oh, Betty! Little Betty beat us all to the post.

778
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:53,480
这里是三号病房
你们也看到了，这儿没有病人
And this is ward three. As you can see, no patients.

779
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,620
欢迎到夏威夷
来，我带你们去玩
Welcome to Hawaii. Come on, I'll show you the bar.

780
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,720
桑得拉，咱们去逗逗她们
来啊
Sandra, new recruits to torture. Come on.

781
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,590
对不起，各位女士
Excuse me, ladies?

782
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:06,800
再过两年等我十九岁的时候
雷德就要买戒指给我
We're gonna wait two years until I'm nineteen and Red can buy me a ring.

783
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,270
雷夫让他最好的朋友照顾你
Rafe sent his best friend to tell you...

784
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:14,070
你应当振作起来了，继续活下去
...so you would be OK, so you can move on.

785
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,840
你还要继续生活下去
You gotta go on living, Ev.

786
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:28,120
雷德！
喔，对不起！
Red! Whoo! Sorry!

787
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,900
永别了，雷夫
Bye, Rafe.

788
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,640
华盛顿，海军情报局

789
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,370
日本舰队失踪了
The Japanese Fleet is missing.

790
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,270
他们进行了无线电管制
They're operating under radio silence.

791
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:59,260
这是四天前，十月二十八日拍的照片
This footage was shot four days ago on October 28th.

792
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,340
我们的侦察机搜遍了太平洋，一无所获
We're sending scout planes in wider vectors... all over the Pacific, but they get nothing.

793
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,410
他们可能隐藏在这里的某个地方
They could be anywhere in here.

794
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:16,330
我真不明白
两个航母编队能突然消失了？
I don't understand how two whole carrier divisions can just disappear.

795
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,000
安全
Clear!

796
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,070
都打偏了
一个偏外，一个偏内
Aw, we're all over the page. We got one wall-eyed and one pigeon-toed.

797
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,700
安东尼，调整一下六号机枪
好的
Anthony, tap in number six. All right.

798
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,080
古斯
Gooz,

799
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,050
调整一下三号机枪
好的
tap in number three. All right.

800
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,480
嘿，有客人来了
Hey. We got a visitor.

801
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,190
哦，那可不是海军制服
Oh... that ain't no Navy issue uniform, eh?

802
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,050
丹尼，是伊夫琳
Danny, it's Evelyn.

803
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,520
老天爷
Jesus!

804
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:54,460
你还好吧？
You all right?

805
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,030
很好
Yeah. Yeah.

806
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,760
我不好
No.

807
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,300
我想我大概爱上她了
I think I'm falling for her.

808
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,140
你知道的，我早就猜到了
Wow. You know, I saw this coming.

809
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,840
我从未想过，来得太突然了，情不自禁的
I didn't want this to happen. It just kind of did. Can't help it.

810
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,410
她总要嫁人，你是最合适的
Well, Danny, she's gotta be with somebody. It might as well be you.

811
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:13,410
你告诉我，如果你阵亡了
而你最好的兄弟却在搞你的女友
You telling me if you were dead and you saw your best buddy doing your girl...

812
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,950
你不会起死复生
狠狠地揍这个活着的臭小子一顿吧？
...you wouldn't come back and beat the living crap outta him?

813
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,280
托尼，给我闭嘴
Tony, back off.

814
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,980
我会死也不会放过他
I'd be back so fast.

815
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,580
丹尼重情重义，会照顾好她的
Danny's being a better friend taking care of her himself.

816
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,590
我也有女朋友
I got a girlfriend.

817
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:31,430
那太好了，我们走吧
That's great. Come on, fellas. Let's split.

818
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,160
丹尼，不管怎样这都是你和她的事了
Danny, whatever happens now is just about you and her.

819
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,730
别总想着雷夫
You gotta try and forget about Rafe.

820
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,740
小心点，好吗？女人会蛊惑人心
Be careful, all right? Ladies... cloud the mind.

821
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,450
谢了，古斯
Thanks, Gooz.

822
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,510
不客气
You're welcome.

823
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,910
嘿，丹尼
Hey, Danny.

824
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:52,980
他们要去哪儿？
Where's everybody going?

825
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,150
他们在避嫌
Just being discreet.

826
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,490
好像大家都挺怪怪的
Does it seem like everybody's acting a little strange?

827
01:00:58,830 --> 01:00:59,890
没有呀
No. Nah.

828
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,800
对
Right.

829
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,490
嗯，也许…也许是有一点吧
Well, maybe... maybe a little. Yeah.

830
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,700
这里的人都太闲了
Well, people in this outfit... have way too much time on their hands.

831
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:14,970
关于我们，但愿他们别乱想得离谱
Oh, yeah. I just hope they don't think there's been something... going on between us, that's all.

832
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,710
没有啦，那就太尴尬了
Oh, no. I mean, no. That would be... embarrassing, right?

833
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,240
我忘了拿扳手
Forgot my wrenches.

834
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,250
这真的很尴尬
That would definitely be embarrassing.

835
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,950
你好，我忘了拿扳手
Yeah. Ha. Forgot my wrenches.

836
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,350
他真的没有必要离开呀
He really doesn't have to leave.

837
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,220
是啊
No.

838
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,920
我要跟朋友出去，那么…
I, uh, I'm just going out with the girls, so...

839
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:37,290
回头见吧
I guess I'll see you later.

840
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:41,140
好的，回头见
Yeah. All right. Yeah, all right. I'll see you around.

841
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,740
见鬼
Shit.

842
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,440
伊夫琳
Evelyn.

843
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,410
你见过珍珠港的日落吗？
Have you ever seen Pearl Harbor at sunset?

844
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,170
当然
Of course.

845
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,640
是从空中看的吗？
from the air?

846
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,180
你知道吗，为这我会被踢出军队的
You know, I could get kicked out of the military for this.

847
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,520
真的吗？
Really?

848
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,880
真的，趴下来
Yeah. Stay down.

849
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,510
夏威夷人叫这“瓦伊摩米”
意思是“珍珠海”
The Hawaiians called this harbor Wai Momi. It means "water of pearls."

850
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,350
真是美极了！
It's so beautiful.

851
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,120
我爸带我飞过几次
My dad took me up a couple of times.

852
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:34,210
千万别学他那样翻斤头
你们怎么称呼在空中翻斤头？
Just don't do what he did. What do you call it when you flip over?

853
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,820
空中翻滚？
A barrel roll?

854
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,320
对
我不会学他的
Yeah. I won't.

855
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,570
你觉得怎样？
What do you think?

856
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,070
很过瘾
I like that.

857
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:08,020
那架飞机应该在一小时之前就返航的
Hey! That plane was supposed to be back here an hour ago!

858
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,560
快，躲在伞库里
Quick, hide in the parachute hangar.

859
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,830
我的心跳得好快
My heart is pounding.

860
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:43,910
丹尼，昨天晚上…
不，那样不行
Danny, last night... No, that's terrible.

861
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,750
丹尼，我们要好好谈谈
Danny, we need to talk about this.

862
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,060
长官，伊夫琳！
丹尼，嘿
Sir. Evelyn! Danny. Hey.

863
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,960
我一夜都没合眼，一直想见你
I didn't sleep a wink last night. I had to see you.

864
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:07,630
我知道昨晚太疯狂了
但我不后悔，你呢？
Last night was crazy, I know, but... I'm not sorry. Are you?

865
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,210
我不知道
I don't know.

866
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,340
我过的很愉快，但…
Danny, I had a wonderful time last night. I...

867
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,820
…这一切都太快了
It's just all too fast.

868
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:22,790
伊夫琳，今天早上我坐在沙滩上
望着升起的太阳
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down at the beach this morning and I watched the sun rise...

869
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,380
心里想，这一切将重新开始
and I knew that everything was gonna be different.

870
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:29,060
就从今天开始
That this was the start of something new.

871
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:35,340
就在此时此刻，我不在乎别人的议论
In this place, in this moment. And I don't care what anybody else says, you know?

872
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,730
为什么我有这种感觉？
How can I not feel this way?

873
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,830
因为我喜欢你
I kinda like you.

874
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,540
是吗？
Oh, you do?

875
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:53,690
你的领带歪了
You have your tie on crooked.

876
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:58,950
一切都会好起来，好吗？
Everything's gonna be all right, OK?

877
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,930
一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be all right.

878
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:16,240
你坐飞机去过瓦胡岛吗？
Do you have any ain'tours going through the valley of Oahu?

879
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,540
懂我的意思吗？
You do?

880
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,390
这里是檀香山广播电台
This is KGMB in Honolulu...

881
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,360
瓦胡岛又是一个美丽的秋天
on another beautiful fall day here in paradise.

882
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,900
我们掌握了足够的情报
We have enough information.

883
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,230
我们可以回去了
We are returning home.

884
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,500
你想过我们是否会被卷入战争？
Do you ever wonder... if this war's gonna catch up with us?

885
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:23,380
没怎么想过
Not a whole lot.

886
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:27,540
我们没在一起的时候
为准备战争，你都在天上训练
Every moment we're not together, you're up there training for it.

887
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,750
对，我还为现在这种情况接受过训练...
Yeah, well, I'm training for moments like these...

888
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,520
因为我根本不知道…
'cause I have no idea...

889
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,520
…如何把车子从沙坑里面开出来
how I'm gonna get this car out of the sand.

890
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,060
伊夫琳，你可以从浴室里面出来吗？
你都进去一个小时啦
Evelyn, can you please come out of the bathroom? You've been there for an hour.

891
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,610
伊夫琳！
你干什么呢，想学我？
Evelyn! What are you trying to do, look like me?

892
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,310
你不舒服？
Are you OK?

893
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,710
没事
Yeah.

894
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,340
怎么了？ 该死
What's the matter? No, you... D'oy.

895
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:56,560
他们称这为空海，没有航道经过
They call it the vacant sea. None of the major sea lanes go through it...

896
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:56,560
(十一月二十九日，海军司令部)

897
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,850
你可以把整个亚洲藏在那儿，没人会知道
and you can bury the entire land mass of Asia there... and nobody would know.

898
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,590
日本人可以从那儿向任何目标发起攻击
From there, they could attack anywhere.

899
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,070
最新的情报显示
日本的战斗编队正在向南行驶
Our last signals intercept indicate that the Japanese taskforce is heading south...

900
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,870
到菲律宾或东南亚
towards the Philippines or southeast Asia.

901
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:15,040
但海军情报局的瑟曼上校对
失踪的日本舰队有他自己的看法
But Captain Thurman of Naval intelligence here has his own theory about the missing ships.

902
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,780
长官，我认为，他们要攻击我们的珍珠港
Sir, I believe they'll try to hit us where it'll hurt us the most... Pearl Harbor.

903
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,510
可这儿距离日本有四千海里远
It's over 4,000 nautical miles from Japan to Pearl.

904
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:28,020
舰艇编队跑不了这么远，上校
That's along distance to steam a navy, Captain.

905
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,760
你的根据是什么？
Your theory is based on what?

906
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,260
如果是我，我就会那样做
Well, it's what I would do.

907
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,560
但缺乏有说服力的证据，瑟曼上校
That's not exactly hard evidence, Captain Thurman.

908
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:39,190
嗯，将军，我有确切的证据时候
我们已经处于战争状态了
Well, Admiral, if I had hard evidence... we'd already be at war.

909
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,330
长官，我们可以很轻松地
破译日本的外交密电…
Sir, we can read their diplomatic codes faster than they can type them.

910
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,810
但瑟曼上校的破译小组还在
研究日本海军的密码
But Captain Thurman's cryptology team is still trying to crack the naval codes.

911
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,810
截获的密电都缺行少字
The intercepts have missing words and garbled lines...

912
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:53,750
必须弄清楚他们的真实企图
才有可能破译这些密电
so to explain the decrypts, we have to try to interpret what we think they're trying to do.

913
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,940
企图？你是说猜测
Interpret? You mean guess.

914
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:59,480
他们依靠自己的情报直觉，长官
They use their informed intuition, sir.

915
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,890
我们就像在黑暗中摸索
必须掌握一切
We guess. It's like playing chess in the dark.

916
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:08,430
每一个谣传、风吹草动
或军队调动都要注意
Any rumor, troop movement, ship movement spine-tingle, goose bump, we pay attention to it.

917
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:14,220
我在驻守亚洲的时候
当地人会从别的角度看问题
When I was in the Asiatic Fleet the locals used to try to get outside of a problem to try to see the inside.

918
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,430
偷袭珍珠港对美国是最致命的打击
Well, I see a strike on Pearl. It's the worst thing that could happen.

919
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:20,940
可以摧毁太平洋舰队的战斗力
A blow to Pearl would devastate the Pacific Fleet's ability to make war.

920
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,480
你要我们根据你的直觉
So, sir, you would have us mobilize the entire fleet...

921
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:29,920
花费数百万元让整个舰队进入战斗部署
而根据就是你的风声鹤唳
at the cost of millions of dollars... based on this spine-tingling feeling of yours?

922
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:33,820
不是，长官
我的工作是收集情报
No, sir. My job is to gather and interpret material.

923
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,320
根据我破解的不完整情报
Making difficult decisions based on incomplete information...

924
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:42,220
做出困难的决定是您的责任，长官
...from my limited decoding ability is your job, sir.

925
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:47,300
那就快点破译这该死的密码，上校
这样我才能做出正确的决定
Then break the damn naval code, Captain so I can make a better decision.

926
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,340
是的，长官，我们尽力
Aye, sir. We are trying.

927
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,250
我想知道我们是否应该
让太平洋舰队进入全面警戒
I wonder if we shouldn't put the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

928
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:20,800
先生们，如果和谈结果并不乐观
In case the optimism of the "Honolulu Advertiser" proves unfounded, gentlemen...

929
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:20,800
(美日和谈充满希望)

930
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:24,940
肖特将军和陆军
能为我的舰队提供保护吗？
what are General Short and the Army going to do about protecting my ships?

931
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,370
珍珠港半径十英里内
惠勒机场有战斗机
Within a ten-mile radius of your harbor, we have fighter planes here at Wheeler...

932
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,980
希凯姆机场有轰炸机和训练用跑道
bombers at Hickam, and a training strip at Haleiwa.

933
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:40,290
左十度

934
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:46,150
我们最近在这新建了一个雷达站
能侦察一百二十五英里外的敌机
We've recently established a radar station here that can detect planes 125 miles out.

935
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:48,910
那是一个月前才建成的，还没有检测过
Which is a month old, Admiral, and untested.

936
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,780
我也见过这些新雷达，少校
I've seen these new radar screens, Major.

937
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,940
它们根本分辨不出是敌机还是该死的鸟
There's no way of telling whether they're ours, theirs or a flock of damn birds.

938
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,310
(一九四一年十二月五日，珍珠港)

939
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:00,880
我监听到一个来自东京
打到珍珠港附近某地的电话
I'm intercepting a call from Tokyo to somewhere close by Pearl.

940
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,790
东京来的，他说不认识你
There's a call from Tokyo. They say they don't know you.

941
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:09,390
你好？是我
喂，喂
Hello? Hai. Moshi, moshi

942
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:19,240
是个当地牙医
他说从他的办公室可以看到珍珠港
It's a local dentist. He can see Pearl Harbor from his office.

943
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,270
对方问有很多水手吗？
Are there many sailors around?

944
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:30,910
牙医说航空母舰没在港口
Uh, the dentist says that the flatships are not in port.

945
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,390
他们在谈天气
They're talking about the weather.

946
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,960
他好像不知道对方是谁
He doesn't seem to know who he's talking to.

947
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:43,730
喂？你好，喂？
莫名其妙
Hello? Moshi moshi. Hello? That was a strange call.

948
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,160
将军，能单独向您汇报吗？
Admiral, may I speak to you in private?

949
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:52,500
间谍为什么敢用电话？
他们知道我们在进行监听
Why would a spy use a phone? They know we tap all international lines.

950
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,670
监听人员认为他们并没有使用暗语
Our listeners feel it's probably not code talk.

951
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:59,080
听起来好像日本人想从本地居民
口中打探我们的航空母舰在哪
It sounds like someone in Japan is sneaking around asking a local citizen the location of our carriers.

952
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:03,280
这让我觉得心里很乱
马上通知联邦调查局
Well, that makes me feel all warm inside. Get the FBI on it immediately.

953
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,350
我们还没找到那该死的日本舰队吗？
Have we found the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?

954
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,830
还没有，将军
我们正在整个太平洋上搜索
No, Admiral. The bases are looking all over the Pacific.

955
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:12,500
那是不是该死的日本舰队在钻石海岬转悠
所以我们才一无所知
So the entire fleet could be rounding Diamond Head and we wouldn't know a thing about it.

956
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:14,230
钻石海岬：在夏威夷瓦胡岛东南海岸上的
232.1 米高的海岬，海岬，伸向水中的尖形陆地

957
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,230
继续寻找
Get on it.

958
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,990
我还活着
I'm alive.

959
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:53,060
太困难了，我们没办法通知你
This is the first I could get word out.

960
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,990
(法语)

961
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:55,440
我答应过你一定会回来
I told you I'd come back.

962
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:05,360
来，坐吧，都过去了，没事了
Here, sit down. Sit down. Come here. It's OK. It's all right.

963
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:09,890
真的是你
You're real.

964
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,230
是啊
Yeah.

965
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:14,470
我每天都梦想这一天
I wished for this every day.

966
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:18,070
我也是，我每分每秒都在想你
I know. Me, too. Every second. So did I.

967
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,800
我以为你死了
他们说你被击落，掉进了海里
I thought you were dead. They said you were shot down in the sea.

968
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:25,250
没错
Yeah, I was.

969
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:30,290
我掉进海里，冷极了
我好想你
I was in the ocean. It was so cold. I missed you.

970
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:34,190
后来，法国渔船救起了我
I got picked up by a French fishing boat...

971
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:37,160
在法国的被占区，我不能写信给你
and I was in occupied France, and I couldn't get word out.

972
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,160
我差一点就…我会全部告诉你的，我保证
And I'm just... I'll tell you all about it, I promise.

973
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:42,390
现在好啦，我回来了
But I'm fine. I'm OK. And I'm here now.

974
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:48,300
伊夫琳，我好想见到你，你太美啦
Evelyn... I just wanted to see you. You're so beautiful.

975
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,180
我爱你
I love you.

976
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:14,690
嘿，都过去了，伊夫琳，我回来了
Hey, it's OK. It's OK. Evelyn, Evelyn. I'm back.

977
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,840
没事了，我发誓永远也不离开你了
It's OK. I won't leave you again, I promise.

978
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,100
雷夫，你死了
Rafe, you died.

979
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,940
我的心也死了
And so did I.

980
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:30,970
我知道，我现在回来了
I know, but I'm... I'm... It's fine now. I'm back.

981
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,950
我们团聚了
We're together.

982
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:43,830
我们又团聚了，对吧？
I mean, we are together... right?

983
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,690
我不知道我在哪
I don't know where I am.

984
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:53,870
雷夫
Rafe.

985
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:23,830
雷夫
Rafe.

986
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:29,600
离我远点
Stay away.

987
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,480
雷夫
Rafe.

988
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,360
这里是檀香山电台
This is Radio Honolulu...

989
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:42,320
在这个令人愉快的太平洋岛屿上
在这个阳光明媚的十二月六日
playing the sweetest music on the sweetest island in the Pacific.

990
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,690
我们为你送上优美的音乐
It's a beautiful December 6th with beautiful music

991
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,160
要是美国人起了疑心

992
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,390
他们的广播会告诉我们

993
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,470
雷夫
Rafe!

994
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:02,160
噢，我的妈呀
Oh, God damn it.

995
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,300
真正的王牌飞行员！
There you go. A real live ace!

996
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:08,400
王牌飞行员才击落了五架敌机
而我击落了六架
Whoo! An ace is only five. I shot down six M.E.s.

997
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:08,400
M.E.：指梅塞斯米特公司为德军制造的军用飞机

998
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,850
还有两架打冒了烟，他们没算进去
And I got two smokers, too. They don't count them.

999
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,140
我还没有受勋，就被打下来
Of course, I got shot down myself before they could pin me.

1000
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,950
那你从前线回来了
打仗到底是什么感觉？
So you got back from behind enemy lines, huh? What's that combat like?

1001
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,610
你害怕吗？
Were you scared?

1002
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,720
嗨！一个一个来
Hey! One at a time.

1003
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:23,230
纳粹空军的技术非常棒
Well, them Luftwaffe boys can fly pretty good.

1004
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:25,660
你要知道
这跟训练可是两码事儿，他们…
It's not like, you know, training. They're, uh...

1005
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,460
丹尼
知道吗，他们很讲究战术
Danny. You know, they're all about tactics is what it is.

1006
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,600
纳粹飞行员比你飞得快
See, the Nazis, right, they're faster than you are...

1007
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,010
他们钻进云层，一个俯冲…就到你头顶
so they'll disappear and they get up in the soup and they'll throw like a roll or a hammerhead...

1008
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:44,410
然后像某些美国人一样，从背后偷袭你
and they'll come around on your high side shoot you from behind like some Americans will.

1009
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:53,850
古斯，这才是真正的王牌
Hey... Gooz, you're looking at a real live ace.

1010
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,020
让我把这件衬衫脱下来送给你！
Well, let me give you the shirt off my back!

1011
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,620
拿去吧
There you go!

1012
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:01,630
那我就不客气了
I'll take it from you.

1013
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:04,700
反正我也需要便服
嘿，雷夫，我们得谈谈，好吗？
I can see how you all been spending your time out here. Hey, Rafe, we gotta talk, all right?

1014
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,290
我和你没什么好谈的，过来
I got nothing to talk about with you. Here.

1015
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:10,560
干一杯吧
Why don't you have a drink?

1016
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,370
我来敬酒
I'll make a toast.

1017
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:16,340
为了死里逃生
To returning from the dead.

1018
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,620
真没想到，可这就是生活
Wasn't all I expected, but, well, that's life.

1019
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,350
敬我最好的朋友，丹尼…
To my best friend and loyal buddy Danny...

1020
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:26,190
为了他所做的一切干杯
for keeping up the war effort back here at home.

1021
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,890
知道吗，在英国有人向你敬酒你却不喝
You know, where I come from somebody makes a toast to you...

1022
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:37,290
那就是不给别人面子
...and you don't drink that's saying something.

1023
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,470
好吧，雷夫，既然话都说到这个份上
All right, Rafe. That's how it's gonna be

1024
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:43,810
为你干杯！
To you.

1025
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:46,100
我想，你们两个需要单独谈谈
Hey, you guys need to spend some time alone, I think.

1026
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,840
不，别走，雷德
Aw, hell, no, Red. Come on.

1027
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,750
不，不，我们就在这儿庆祝
No, no, no. We're celebrating here.

1028
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:55,010
我在前方打仗，差点送了命
Me over there fighting... almost getting killed...

1029
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,780
我的朋友丹尼在后方…照顾我的一切
my friend Danny back here... looking after my interests for me.

1030
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:02,620
你知道吗，他太好了…
好得连我的女朋友都给照顾了
You all know Danny was even good enough to look out for my girl for me while I was gone?

1031
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:05,630
我们以为你阵亡了，雷夫
我们都很悲痛
We thought you were dead, Rafe. And it gutted us both.

1032
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,290
可我们总还要继续生活下去
And we were just trying to get on with our lives.

1033
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,930
你过得不错，对吧？
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?

1034
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,370
你这个烂酒鬼，不讲道理，一直都是这样
You know, you're a rotten drunk. You always have been.

1035
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:16,030
你这个卑鄙的朋友，我才发现
Well, you're a lousy friend. That's a new development.

1036
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,940
你扔下她为别人去打仗
You left her to fight somebody else's war...

1037
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:22,810
你还设法不让我去
我们真的以为你死啦！
and you made damn sure that I didn't go with you and we thought that you were dead

1038
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:25,060
我是差点就死了，你这个狗样养的
I almost did die, you little son of a bitch!

1039
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:27,610
那时候我想到的只有她
And her face was the last thing that went through my mind...

1040
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,850
别站在那告诉我这一切都是理所当然的！
so don't stand there and tell me to act like it's all right!

1041
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,410
不错，雷夫，我是留下了
Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed.

1042
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:37,090
你得知道情况改变了
我希望你能接受现实
I stayed, and you made sure of that and some things changed. And I hope you can get used to that.

1043
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:42,360
噢，我要接受现实？
好，让你看看我怎样接受的
Oh, I have to get used to it? All right. We'll see how I can get used to it.

1044
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:47,130
接受我的拳头吧，小子！
Get used to that, boy!

1045
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,900
我只用左手就够了
Hey, hey! And that's my left hand, too!

1046
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:58,180
有人在打架，快派宪兵来！
Melee at the Hula-la. Send M.P. s!

1047
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,950
你说我是卑鄙的朋友？
You called me a lousy friend?

1048
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:11,720
可恶，来啊，丹尼！
Ow! Shit! Come on, Danny!

1049
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,330
逮捕他们！
快跑啊！
Let's go get them. Let's move out!

1050
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,010
我们会被关禁闭的，快走！
They're gonna throw us in the brig. Let's get outta here.

1051
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:46,720
编队在珍珠港北三百二十海里处待命

1052
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:06,210
帝国的兴衰在此一役！

1053
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,830
雷夫，你是我唯一的亲人
Rafe... you're the only family I got.

1054
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:27,560
你不在的时候，我孤独极了
她和我一样
When you were gone it was the loneliest I'd ever been. The same for her, too.

1055
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:30,310
噢，小子，你现在真的是让我心都碎了
Oh, boy, now you're really breaking my heart.

1056
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,340
你要是没走，什么都不会发生
If you hadn't gone, none of this woulda happened.

1057
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:34,210
这么说我猜是我错了？
Oh, so it's my fault, I guess.

1058
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:36,850
算了吧，雷夫
Damn it, Rafe.

1059
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,840
我看我们总会有办法…
I just know there's got to be some way...

1060
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:50,740
…妥善解决这个问题，让我们和好如初
we can work things out so that... things could be right between me and you.

1061
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,450
我看永远也不可能了
I just don't see how it could ever be the same.

1062
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,460
尊敬的父亲…
Revered father...

1063
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,860
现在我要去执行任务，完成我的使命
I go now to full-fill my mission and my destiny.

1064
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:16,370
我希望能为我们全家带来荣誉
I hope it is a destiny that will bring honor to our family...

1065
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:23,020
如果需要付出生命
我将在所不辞，精忠报国
and if it reguires my life, I will sacrifice it gladly to be a good servant of our nation.

1066
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,890
嘿，我看到一大片阴影
Hey... we got a large haze.

1067
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:52,660
太大了不象飞机，对吧？
That's too big to be planes, right?

1068
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:59,410
你想走这步？要跳马？
Is that what you wanna do? Knight to knight five?

1069
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:01,480
臭棋！
Wrong move.

1070
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:04,880
长官！雷达显示东北部有大量回波
Lieutenant, radar's picking up a large return moving in from the northeast.

1071
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:05,850
等一下
Hang on.

1072
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:08,720
别紧张
Relax.

1073
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:11,120
那是从本土回来的 B17 轰炸机
It's a flight of B-17s coming in from the mainland.

1074
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:14,220
没什么可担心的
Nothing to worry about.

1075
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,420
是一大群 B-17 轰炸机
A heck of a lot of B-17s.

1076
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,230
打得好
Good shot, Hop.

1077
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:25,470
这次有好点的消息了吧
This better be good, Commander.

1078
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:29,220
我们的驱逐舰击沉了一艘日本潜艇
One of our destroyers reports having fired and sunk...

1079
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:33,580
该潜艇于六时五十三分企图闯入珍珠港
enemy submarine attempting to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653.

1080
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,510
现在七时二十分了
It's 7:20!

1081
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,810
译电耽误了，将军
We had decoder delays, Admiral.

1082
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,750
马上报告华盛顿，立即召集全部参谋人员
Relay this to Washington. Recall the staff.

1083
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:47,260
和谈…失败…“终止谈判”
"Failure..."Peace talks..."useless."

1084
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,460
我是瑟曼
Thurman here.

1085
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:55,180
东京指示驻华盛顿使馆
“立即破坏译码机”	 …
Tokyo transmitting to their embassy in Washington "Discontinue use of your decoding machine...

1086
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:59,990

你看到了吗？
"and dispose of immediately. "Special emphasis on destroying important parts." Do you read that?

1087
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:10,550
将军，海军情报局截获了东京…
Admiral... Naval Intel intercepted a transmission from Tokyo...

1088
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:12,320

指示他们拆毁译码机
烧掉全部秘密文件
...instructing them to break apart all decoder machines and burn all secret documents.

1090
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:19,760
日本人要开战了
The Japanese are expecting a war.

1091
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,780
我们是不是也该…
Should we?

1092
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,110
可以进行偷袭了

1093
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:12,880
警惕日本人可能从任何方向发起的进攻
Warning of possible Japanese aggressive movement in any direction.

1094
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:15,970
“中断关系，开始战争”
"Broken relationship. Hostilities imminent."

1095
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:17,210
战争会在哪儿开始？
But where?

1096
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:58,320
你曾经打输过吗，米勒？
Did you ever lose a fight, Miller?

1097
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:01,590
很走运，还没有，舰长
I been lucky so far, Captain.

1098
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,890
据我所知，这不仅仅是运气
From what I hear, it ain't luck.

1099
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,400
你是我们军舰的骄傲
Ship's proud of you, son.

1100
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:46,560
星期天海军这么早就搞飞行训练吗？
Why the hell's the Navy doing practice this early on a Sunday?

1101
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:28,610
什么？
Aah!

1102
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:51,360
快走…快走…
Get down! Go, go, go, go!

快起来！快起来！
We're being bombed! We're being bombed! Get up! Get up!

1105
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:19,160
老天爷

1106
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,700

1107
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:29,410
所有人员进入战斗位置
Man your battle stations.

1108

又是演习
Another dumb drill.

1109
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:50,690

是炸弹！
It's a bomb!

好像是日本飞机
They look like Japs.

1120
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,750
我不明白日本人为什么会恨我们
I didn't even know the Japs were sore at us!

1121
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:46,850
丹尼，我他妈要有架飞机就好了！
Danny, you just get me to a goddamn airplane!

雷德，闭嘴！

1130
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:23,880

Danny, what the hell's that noise? You guys doing target practice or something?

1168
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:41,860
我看是二战爆发了
I think World War II just started.

1169
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,580
比利，快跑
Go, go, go! Billy! Run!

1170
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:07,180
是哑弹，是哑弹
It's gonna blow! It's a dud. It's a dud!

1171
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,470
趴下来
Come on, get down!

1172
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:20,460
丹尼，你没事吧？
Danny! Danny, are you all right?

1173
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:24,700
没事！快走！
古斯！大家快走！
I'm all right! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Gooz, come on, man!

1174
01:39:50,830 --> 01:39:52,500
我们要沉了！我们要沉了！
We're sinking! We're sinking!

1175
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:03,940
靠在一起，关闭舱门
Stay together! Close the hatches!

1176
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:19,290
我不会游泳！
I can't swim!

1177
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,420
抓住缆索！
Just hang on!

1178
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:35,540
乔，快走啊！
Let's move it now! Joe!

1179
01:40:35,650 --> 01:40:38,670
快！快！我们快离开这！
快上车！
Go! Go! We're getting outta here! Get in the car!

1180
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:42,550
上车！上车！来，我们走吧！
Get in! Get in! Come on, let's go! Go!

1181
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:45,020
让开！让开！
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1182
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,310
我们去哪儿？
Where's this place we're going?

1183
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:51,050
大约开十分钟
会有一条小跑道，我们到那去
We got a small mechanic runway about ten minutes away.

1184
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,350
它还没被炸掉
Hasn't been hit yet.

1185
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,970
六点钟方向有有零式敌机！
We got Zeros on our six!

1186
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:06,670
小心！
Duck!

1187
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,920
帮帮我们！我们被困住了
Help us! Aah! We're trapped.

1188
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:06,320
打开舱盖！打开舱盖！
Try it! Try the door!

1189
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:43,570
我要被吞下去了！
It's sucking me back!

1190
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:45,870
漩涡太大了！
The current's too strong!

1191
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:01,780
他们还在还向我们扫射！
They're shooting at us!

1192
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:12,570
我不想死！我不想死！
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!

1193
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,600
我们死定了
This is it.

1194
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:11,040
情况有多糟？
How bad?

1195
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:13,670
空袭还在继续，长官
It's still not over, sir.

1196
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,150
整个舰队毫无戒备
An entire fleet at anchor.

1197
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:24,190
我的上帝，我的上帝啊…
My God, my God...

1198
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,780
巴巴拉，把所有找到的注射器都装入吗啡
Barbara, fill every syringe you can find with morphine!

1199
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:57,290
把伤员安置到厨房！
你听到了吗？安置到厨房！
Fill up the kitchen! Are you listening to me? Fill up the kitchen!

1200
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:06,800
厨房那儿！厨房那儿！
Over there! Over there!

1201
01:45:14,410 --> 01:45:16,570
他颈部受伤了！
We got a bad neck wound here!

1202
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:20,080
手术室！快点！马上给他做手术！
Surgery! Move! Get him to surgery!

1203
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:21,980
天哪！ 来这儿！
Oh, God. In here!

1204
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:28,790
他还在流血！给我止血钳
He's still bleeding! Another hemostat!

1205
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:33,350
快点！我要止血钳和缝线，见鬼，快点！
Hurry! Give me a hemostat now! Damn it, hurry!

1206
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,470
我还要止血钳和缝线，快点！
Give me another hemostat! Another suture! Hurry!

1207
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:41,800
天哪！ 很抱歉！
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!

1208
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:48,670
医生
Doctor!

1209
01:45:57,850 --> 01:46:00,520
啊！我快死了吗？护士
Aah! Am I gonna die? Nurse!

1210
01:46:07,330 --> 01:46:09,320
别丢下我
Don't leave me!

1211
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:11,830
医生，快来！
Doctor! Get over here!

1212
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,130
我用手掐住了他的动脉
My fingers are plugging his artery!

1213
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:18,040
医生，你需要什么？
Doctor, what do you need?

1214
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:22,440
冷静点，看着我
你需要什么？
Focus, look at me. What do you need?

1215
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:23,910
止血钳，止血钳
Hemostat. Hemostat.

1216
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:31,610
放心，看着我，你会没事的，会没事的
All right, look at me. You're going to be all right. You're going to be all right.

1217
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:38,030
我们轰炸了他们的军舰和机场

1218
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:40,950
现在要摧毁备用机场

1219
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:45,960
我需要弹药！我需要弹药！
我要更多的弹药…
I need more ammo! I need more ammo, ladies! I need more ammo!

1220
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:49,090
厄尔，那些飞机能飞吗？
Earl! We good to go?

1221
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:50,000
差不多，但是…
Mostly, but...

1222
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:52,570
趴下来！天哪！找掩体！
Get down! Shit! Get cover!

1223
01:46:56,710 --> 01:46:57,580
我的天
Jesus!

1224
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,150
你们快过来！
厄尔，快进来
Come on, you guys! Earl, get in here!

1225
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:07,350
散弹枪不管用！
还有武器和弹药吗？
Sergeant! We need more than a shotgun! You got any other weapons for coverfire?

1226
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:09,190
在那边的弹药库里！
Inside that ammo locker!

1227
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,990
快点！走！走！
Come on! Go! Move it!

1228
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,000
把枪拿出来！
Get the guns out!

1229
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,960
你说飞机差不多能够飞，有什么问题吗？
You said the planes are mostly ready, but... but what?

1230
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:21,630
这架抛锚、那架坏了，那架根本飞不了
只剩下四架可以飞
She's down, she's broke, she's shit. I got four left.

1231
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:24,400
一架好的，两架缺弹药，一架缺油
One's good, two need ammo, one needs fuel.

1232
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:25,970
快躲进掩体里面去，把子弹装好！
Fall out and load up in the bunker!

1233
01:47:26,910 --> 01:47:29,210
我们走！趴下来！快点！
Let's go! Get down! Move!

1234
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:32,010
做好准备，开始干吧！
快趴下！
Get ready to roll this thing! Get down! Now!

1235
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:37,280
安东尼、雷德
你们负责 50 高射炮
Anthony, Red, you stay here and man the fifty-caliber.

1236
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:41,780
古斯，你去附近的掩体
掩护我们，好吗？
Gooz, get to the next bunker and lay down some coverfire. All right?

1237
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:43,090
敌机来了
Planes.

1238
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:46,790
我们要开枪吗？
Should we fire?

1239
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:52,030
趴下来，妈的，别开火，冷静点
千万别开火
Stay down! God damn it! Hold your fire! Stay still! Nobody fire!

1240
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:53,530
噢，天啊
噢，天啊
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

1241
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,970
他们不知道我们在这儿
They don't know we're here.

1242
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,340
别动
开火吗？
Stay down. Fire?

1243
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:04,970
不，妈的，趴下
他们没发现我们，趴着别开枪
No, God damn it, stay down, stay still. Don't fire.

1244
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,020
老天
Oh, God.

1245
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,400
敌机没有炸弹了，我想他们要返航了
I don't see any ordnance. I think they're going home.

1246
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:24,300
不
No.

1247
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:26,330
他们还会回来的
地面上仍然有我们的飞机
They'll be back. We still got planes on the ground.

1248
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:28,260
飞行员们听好
Pilots, listen up.

1249
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:32,310
在跑道上一定要开足马力
别到头了才拉操纵杆
Get all the speed you can on the runway... don't get on the stick till the very end.

1250
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:34,800
起飞后要低飞，在建筑物之间活动
In the air, stay low between the buildings.

1251
01:48:34,910 --> 01:48:40,370
如果被零式咬住尾巴，左右摇摆甩掉他
别傻愣着，好吗？要保持移动
You see any Zero on your tail... wipe him off, don't freeze. all right? Just keep moving.

1252
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,310
我们要设法分散他们
Try to separate them,

1253
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,750
然后一架一架地消灭
take them out one by one.

1254
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:48,020
P-40 飞机没有零式飞机快
所以别和它比速度
P-40s can't out run Zeros, so don't try.

1255
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:49,450
只有靠技术超过它们
We have to outfly them.

1256
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:52,690
高空轰炸机！他们非把机库炸平不可！
We got high-level bombers! They'll bust this hangar wide open!

1257
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,520
拿上机枪走，走吧
Grab the fifties! Let's move!

1258
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:58,500
快走…走，走！
Move! Move! Go, go, go!

1259
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:05,270
零式飞机！
Zeros!

1260
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:07,880
快找掩体！
Take cover!

1261
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:19,750
快找掩体！快找掩体！快找掩体！
Take cover! Take cover! Take cover!

1262
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:33,930
趴下来！趴下来！我们走！
Get down! Get down! Let's go! In the box! Aah!

1263
01:49:52,190 --> 01:49:53,210
丹尼
Danny!

1264
01:49:56,190 --> 01:49:59,150
跟我来，兄弟！
Come on! Come on, buddy!

1265
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:01,760
别管他，他死了！他已经死了！
Leave him, he's dead! He's dead!

1266
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:12,270
他们不会放过我们，快到飞机那去！
They're kicking our butt. Get to the airplanes!

1267
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:14,470
快…快…
Go, go, go!

1268
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,740
快跑！雷德，安东尼，我们走！
Run! Red, Anthony, let's go!

1269
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:23,950
过来，帮帮我
Come on, help me!

1270
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:29,820
该死的带子
Goddamn belts!

1271
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:39,300
让他们好好瞧瞧
Knock them dead.

1272
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:46,170
他们绕回来了，快走
Quick! Get in! Put this on! They're coming around.

1273
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,980
雷德，让开！我要起飞
Red, get out of here, God damn it! Go!

1274
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:01,220
快点…
Come on, let's go.

1275
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:02,950
乔，快开走
Joe, get out the way!

1276
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:04,420
我马上离开
I'm rolling!

1277
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:08,350
安全！起飞！
Clear! Go!

1278
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:10,570
敌机！
Planes!

1279
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:12,570
快来，帮帮我！
Come on, help me!

1280
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:19,500
乔，有三架敌机在你后面，注意！
Hey, Joe! You got three Zeros behind you!

1281
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:30,820
转向！转向！
Turn! Turn!

1282
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:33,850
哎呀！糟糕！
Oh, God! Aah!

1283
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:46,700
该死
Oh, shit.

1284
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,930
动作快点，马上起飞
What are you doing? Get going!

1285
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:53,480
丹尼，该我们开始进行空中表演了
没有僚机我可不行，我需要你！
Danny, start that thing up and get in the air. I'm not much good without a wing man. I need you!

1286
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:54,600
好的，收到！
I got you!

1287
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:58,040
我们上！
Let's do it!

1288
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,420
跑道太短了，雷夫
It's real tight, Rafe! Real tight!

1289
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:35,710
嘿，雷夫，我们会撞上建筑物的
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure we have enough runway!

1290
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:37,880
起飞前开足马力
Get your airspeed up before you leave the dirt!

1291
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:40,150
别紧张，别紧张
Don't freeze. Don't freeze.

1292
01:52:44,230 --> 01:52:46,160
我可能飞不过去
I don't think I'm gonna make it over!

1293
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:59,670
我们成功了，飞起来了！
We did it! I'm up!

1294
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:03,340
有敌机跟在我们后面
We got Zeros behind us!

1295
01:53:05,110 --> 01:53:06,740
你看到有几架？
How many you see back there?

1296
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:12,510
六点钟方向有五架
We got five on our six!

1297
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:20,650
超低空飞行，丹尼
Take it down to the deck, now!

1298
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:30,340
要分散他们
We gotta split them up.

1299
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:33,270
你往左、我往右
You take left, I'll take right.

1300
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:41,440
厄尔，拿机枪到指挥塔
Earl, get some guns in that goddamn tower!

1301
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:44,520
好，快走，去开卡车
OK! Let's go! Into the truck!

1302
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:52,860
六点钟方向有三架敌机
Danny, I got three on my six.

1303
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:17,250
停车，我们上指挥塔…
Stop! Stop! Let's go!

1304
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:18,910
走吧，快点，雷德
Let's go! Move it! Move it, Red!

1305
01:54:23,590 --> 01:54:25,360
快！快！
Go! Go!

1306
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:31,670
仍有两架敌机缠着我，雷夫
I still got two behind me, Rafe.

1307
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,380
婊子养的！
Son of a bitch!

1308
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:59,290
厄尔！听到了吗？
妈的，快拿机枪上塔顶
Earl, do you hera me. God damn it, get some guns in that tower!

1309
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:03,230
我正在上，塔可不低！
这儿有十层楼高
On the tower. Going ten stories up. It's a long son of a bitch.

1310
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:14,240
雷夫，他们紧咬着我不放，我甩不掉
Rafe, they're all over me! I can't get them off me!

1311
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:24,220
丹尼，我身后也有三架
Danny, I still got three on my tail!

1312
01:55:27,490 --> 01:55:29,550
颠簸飞行，别被他们盯死
Keep jinking it! Don't let them get a handle!

1313
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:30,780
我还是甩不掉他们
I can't shake them!

1314
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:33,530
可恶
God damn it.

1315
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:37,690
丹尼，我们和他们玩“老鹰捉小鸡”
Danny, let's play chicken with these Jap suckers!

1316
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:38,820
听你的
I'm with you.

1317
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,070
天啊
Jesus!

1318
01:55:46,510 --> 01:55:47,530
我冲向你了
I'm coming right at you!

1319
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:49,510
别转向，听我指挥
Don't brake till I tell you. Hold on.

1320
01:55:51,050 --> 01:55:53,110
还不行
Not yet! Not yet!

1321
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:54,550
来呀
Come on!

1322
01:55:56,020 --> 01:55:57,750
向左急转
Go left! Now!

1323
01:56:02,690 --> 01:56:03,350
他们撞上了！
We got them!

1324
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:05,920
把机枪架到哪儿
Set up over there!

1325
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:10,430
装上弹药
Come on, load it!

1326
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,430
我们准备好了
We're on the tower.

1327
01:56:13,970 --> 01:56:16,870
有架敌机跟着我，我引它过来
I got one on my tail. I'll bring him right by you.

1328
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:18,670
雷夫过来了…
He's coming around!

1329
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:20,260
让我们来把这个日本笨鸟干掉！
Let's get this Jap sucker!

1330
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,810
先别开火，他来了
Hold your fire. Here he comes.

1331
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:29,640
厄尔，我飞过来的时候
你们最好瞄准一点
You better be cocked and locked when I come by there!

1332
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:33,110
别开火
Hold your fire!

1333
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:36,150
开火
Fire!

1334
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:47,400
干得好，伙计们！
打得漂亮，厄尔
Good shooting, boys! Nice shot, Earl!

1335
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,230
我们去码头看看
Let's head over to battleship row!

1336
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:50,200
收到
I'm with you!

1337
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:00,670
我们再打几架玩玩
Let's go do some business.

1338
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:03,820
我去将他击落
I'm going after them.

1339
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:17,000
雷夫，我打下一架
Rafe! I got him!

1340
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,330
P40 战斗机
P-40's!

1341
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:26,470
他们钻进云层了！
婊子养的，你们别想逃走！
They're pulling into the clouds! We ain't gonna let these sons of bitches get home!

1342
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:35,840
现在轮到你挨揍了
How do you like someone shooting back at you?

1343
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,050
噢，我盯死你了
Oh, I'm on your ass now!

1344
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:54,330
丹尼，我打掉一架！
Yeah! I got one!

1345
01:57:56,510 --> 01:57:57,300
来呀
Come on!

1346
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:10,680
来啊…
God, come on!

1347
01:58:19,490 --> 01:58:21,360
别想逃
Come on, stay in there!

1348
01:58:34,180 --> 01:58:35,970
你死定了，王八蛋
I got you, you son of a bitch!

1349
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:46,750
报告源田大佐，战果辉煌

1350
01:58:46,890 --> 01:58:48,380
摧毁多艘战舰

1351
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:55,420
出动飞机三百五十架，损失二十九架

1352
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:57,830
第三攻击波准备完毕，将军

1353
01:58:58,730 --> 01:59:02,100
突袭的意义已经不存在了

1354
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:05,640
取消第三波攻击

1355
01:59:05,970 --> 01:59:06,740
上将

1356
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:25,450
谁教你的绝招？
Who taught you how tofly, Lieutenant?

1357
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:29,490
是他
He did.

1358
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:37,930
我需要给他截肢
I have to amputate here! I have to amputate!

1359
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:39,150
你不会死的
You're not gonna die! I got you.

1360
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:45,050
桑得拉，吗啡快用完了
给注射过吗啡的伤员做记号
Sandra, we're running out of morphine. Find some way to mark them...

1361
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:49,010
这样我们才清楚谁已经注射过了
So we can keep track of who's got morphine already.

1362
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:51,550
你是哪一艘战舰的？战舰编号？
Tell me about your ship. What ship are you from?

1363
01:59:51,550 --> 01:59:54,250
不行，谁有签字笔？
It's not marking. Have you got a marker?

1364
01:59:58,260 --> 01:59:59,730
用我的口红
Use my lipstick!

1365
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:00,990
M 代表吗啡
Put "M" for morphine.

1366
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:02,690
我要止血钳
We need a tourniquet!

1367
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,100
止血钳
Tourniquet!

1368
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:07,230
钳子呢？
Where are the clamps?

1369
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:14,400
都用光了
There's nothing left!

1370
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:18,940
给，用这个
Here, use this.

1371
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:22,450
伊夫琳，伤员太多了
到外面去，把伤员分成两组
Evelyn! Go outside. There's too many to help. Sort them out.

1372
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:25,180
只让有抢救希望的进来，你懂吗？
Only those that can be saved you bring in. You got that?

1373
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:25,980
我办不到
I can't...

1374
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:29,720
快去，我需要你帮助
快点！
No, please, I need you to do it! Go! Go!

1375
02:00:57,650 --> 02:00:59,640
没有记号的不能进去
Don't look at anyone without a mark!

1376
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:01,620
退后，我叫你退后
I told you, stand back!

1377
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:04,780
别让他们进来
Keep them outside!

1378
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,290
在这儿等
Wait here.

1379
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,960
别碰我， 日本鬼子
把你的臭手拿开
Don't touch me, you Jap! Get your hands off me!

1380
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:16,200
带到加护病房
Get him into critical. Get him off me.

1381
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:17,700
加护病房，向前走！
Critical, frontward!

1382
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:21,670
我伤得多重？
How bad am I?

1383
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:23,810
亲爱的，你不会有事
You're gonna be just fine, sweetheart.

1384
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:25,370
我不想死
I don't wanna die.

1385
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:27,710
你不会死的，我会帮你的
You're not gonna die. I've got your hand.

1386
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:31,350
有足够的吗啡给他止疼吗？
他快不行了，给他注射吗啡
Do you have enough morphine to make him comfortable? He won't make it.

1387
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:34,720
让重伤患排好队！给他吗啡
把他们带过去！
Line the critical up! Get him morphine. Take him over there!

1388
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:36,310
把烧伤病人带到树下
Burn victims by the tree!

1389
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:40,520
我刚发现她，好像已经死了
I just found her! I don't think she's breathing.

1390
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:43,190
她死了，把她…
No, she's dead. Take her...

1391
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:47,600
噢，天啊
Oh, God.

1392
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:53,230
你确定吗？再检查一次
她已经死了
Are you sure, Ev? Check her again. She's dead.

1393
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:54,540
抱她过去
Take her over there!

1394
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:57,370
你一定要确定清楚
But you've gotta be sure!

1395
02:01:57,480 --> 02:01:59,280
她死了，快回去工作，桑得拉
She's dead! Go back to work, Sandra.

1396
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:02,650
我不知道该做什么
I don't know what to do!

1397
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:39,810
上将，华盛顿的电报
Admiral? From Washington.

1398
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:44,210
[日本人的攻击迫在眉睫]
"Attack by Japan considered imminent."

1399
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:50,250
他们只晚了一个小时
They're only an hour late.

1400
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:25,250
恭喜了

1401
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:32,590
我只怕这样做会唤醒了在沉睡中的巨人

1402
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:49,340
我们能做点儿什么？
How can we help?

1403
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:51,750
我们需要血，来吧
We need blood. Come on.

1404
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:59,650
孩子，你要保持信仰
记住耶稣基督的话
Remember, son, hold on to your faith.

1405
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:02,390
今日你将随我进天堂
Today you will be with me in paradise...

1406
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:05,360
不要恐惧，我的孩子
"so fear not." Fear not, my son.

1407
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:10,900
你受到祝福，将蒙主荣召
You are a man truly blessed. You will die in a state of grace.

1408
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:14,670
痛苦很短暂、荣耀是永恒的
Remember, pain is temporary, but glory is forever.

1409
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:20,470
坚信主耶稣基督
很快便将与上帝与天使同在
Hold on to your faith, my son. You'll be with God, the saints, and the angels soon.

1410
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:28,650
我赦免你犯下的过错
以圣父、圣子、圣灵之名
I absolve you of your sins... in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit.

1411
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,050
阿门
In nomine patris et fili, et spiritus sancti. Amen.

1412
02:05:36,930 --> 02:05:38,360
与上帝同在
Go with God, my son.

1413
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:49,440
我们的人都困在码头
有力气搬得动东西的快来帮忙
We've got men trapped everywhere in the harbor. We need help from anybody who can move.

1414
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:57,540
救我们出去…
There's somebody in here!

1415
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:02,210
这儿有人，快派人下去
Get somebody down here! They're cutting through!

1416
02:06:10,770 --> 02:06:13,500
这儿也有人，快派人下去
I hear somebody! Get some guys uphere!

1417
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:15,630
用力拉
Pull!

1418
02:06:18,570 --> 02:06:21,020
快救我们出去！水快满了！
Get us out! It's filling with water!

1419
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:23,140
快拿输气管过来！
Get an airline in here!

1420
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:28,850
我们该怎么做？
What can we do?

1421
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:35,220
速度不能再快了
It won't cut any faster!

1422
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:39,890
快把它钊开
Cut him out! Aah!

1423
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:19,930
昨天，一九四一年十二月七日…
Yesterday... December 7, 1941...

1424
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,430
…将永远成为我们的国耻日…
a date which will live in infamy...

1425
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:30,770
…美利坚合众国遭到日本…
the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked...

1426
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:35,310
…海空军有预谋的突然袭击
by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.

1427
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:43,490
显然易见，这次袭击是
经过长期精心策划的
It is obvious that planning the attack began many weeks ago.

1428
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:48,250
在此期间… 日本政府…
During the intervening time... the Japanese government...

1429
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:53,850
…通过虚伪的声明和维护和平的宣传…
has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements...

1430
02:07:54,350 --> 02:08:03,770
…蓄意欺骗美国
昨天对夏威夷群岛的攻击…
and expressions of hope for continued peace. The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands...

1431
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:09,420
…使美国军队遭受重创
has caused severe damage to American military forces.

1432
02:08:09,450 --> 02:08:16,220
我沉痛地告诉各位
有三千多美国人丧失了生命
I regret to tell you... that over 3,000 American lives have been lost.

1433
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:23,130
无论需要多长时间也要战胜…
敌人预谋的侵略
No matter how long it may take us... to overcome this premeditated invasion...

1434
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:30,360
正义的美国人民，必将赢得彻底的胜利
the American people, in their righteous might... will win through to absolute victory.

1435
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:40,270
由于日本无故发动的卑鄙袭击…
Because of this unprovoked, dastardly attack by Japan...

1436
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:44,320
…我要求国会宣布进入战争状态
I ask that the Congress declare a state of war.

1437
02:08:49,950 --> 02:08:55,410
是不是还有士兵被困在亚里桑那号里
Is it true... men are still trapped alive inside the Arizona?

1438
02:08:57,530 --> 02:08:59,760
舰内传来敲打声
We can heartapping from inside the hull.

1439
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:02,960
我们正在尽力抢救
但他们被困在四十尺海底
We're doing everything we can to get to them... but they're forty feet below water.

1440
02:09:09,710 --> 02:09:12,110
美国人自以为所向无敌
We've been trained to think that we're invincible.

1441
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:16,140
可我们最值得骄傲的战舰…
And now our proudest ships have been destroyed...

1442
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:20,150
…却被我们藐视的敌人击沉了
by an enemy we considered inferior.

1443
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:26,520
我们被逼得无路可退
所以一定要马上反击
We're on the ropes, gentlemen. That's exactly why we have to strike back now.

1444
02:09:26,530 --> 02:09:29,360
我们准备攻击马绍尔和吉尔伯特群岛
We'll attack the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, sir.

1445
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:33,360
我的意思是要攻击日本的心脏
就象他们攻击我们一样
I mean hitting the heart of Japan the way they have hit us.

1446
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:40,610
总统先生，珍珠港
遭袭击是缺乏准备造成的
Mr. President... Pearl Harbor caught us unawares because we didn't face facts.

1447
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:43,600
不过我们应该面对现实
This isn't a time for ignoring them again.

1448
02:09:43,710 --> 02:09:47,310
我们有远程轰炸机
但在日本附近没有基地
We have long-range bombers, but no place to launch them.

1449
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:52,420
中途岛离日本太远
苏联也不会帮助我们
Midway is too far, and Russia won't allow us... to launch a raid from there.

1450
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:54,720
海军上将？
Admiral?

1451
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:58,010
海军航空兵都是轻型飞机
载弹量低、航程短
Navy's planes are small. They carry light loads and have a short range.

1452
02:09:58,010 --> 02:10:01,200
只能够从距离日本几百英里的地方
起飞才能够进行轰炸
We'd have to get them within a few hundred miles of Japan.

1453
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:04,850
这样的话，就必须动用航母
但是，如果我们失去航母
We'd risk our carriers, and if we lose our carriers...

1454
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:06,650
我们将丧失抵御入侵的能力
...we'll have no shield against invasion.

1455
02:10:06,670 --> 02:10:10,970
有人见过不流血的胜利吗？
Does anyone in this room think victory is possible without facing danger?

1456
02:10:11,070 --> 02:10:14,200
要进行战争，就必然有危险
We are at war. Of course there's a risk.

1457
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:18,940
但我们不能无视危险，总统先生
如果日本人继续进攻…
But consider the risk, Mr. President. If the Japanese invade us right now...

1458
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:22,350
在我们能够挡住他们之前
他们可以打到芝加哥
they would reach Chicago before we could stop them.

1459
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:26,690
先生们…
Gentlemen...

1460
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:33,460
在我双腿残疾之前
你们大多数人还不认识我
most of you did not know me when I had the use of my legs.

1461
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:37,050
那时，我强壮，充满自信
I was strong and proud... and arrogant.

1462
02:10:37,930 --> 02:10:44,500
现在我时时刻刻在问自己…
为什么上帝让我做在轮椅上？
Now I wonder, every hour of my life... why God put me into this chair.

1463
02:10:44,610 --> 02:10:50,870
国民流露出失败的情绪…
而你们也是如此
But when I see defeat in the eyes of my countrymen... in your eyes, right now...

1464
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:54,850
我开始认为上帝就是让我来…
I start to think that maybe he brought me down... for times like these...

1465
02:10:54,850 --> 02:11:00,920
…提醒大家我们到底是谁
我们永不放弃，决不低头！
when we all need to be reminded who we truly are... that we will not give up or give in.

1466
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:04,580
尊敬的总统先生，恕我直言
您的要求是不可能办到的
Mr. President, with all respect, sir... what you're asking can't be done.

1467
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:21,910
总统先生
Mr. President!

1468
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:24,340
别扶我，乔治，别扶我
Get back, George! Get back.

1469
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:41,730
别再告诉我，没有什么是不可能！
Do not tell me... it can't be done.

1470
02:11:46,330 --> 02:11:50,570
日本继续在南太平洋炫耀武力
Japan continues its military conguest... throughout the Pacific.

1471
02:11:51,810 --> 02:11:55,720
在国内，美国的自愿者在加紧工作
But, backhome... millions of American workers band together...

1472
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:58,870
为雪十二月七日之耻 努力生产武器
bringing factories to life to avenge Pearl Harbor.

1473
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:06,210
总统先生，我们制定了轰炸东京的计划
Mr. President, we have an idea how to bomb the Japanese.

1474
02:12:07,290 --> 02:12:10,450
很危险，但很大胆
Sir, it's risky... but it's bold.

1475
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:13,320
你是谁？
Who are you?

1476
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:14,550
我吗？
I, sir?

1477
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:16,860
我是洛上校，总统先生
Captain Low, Mr. President.

1478
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:20,070
是他拟制的计划，它是潜艇舰长
He's a submariner. He came up with this idea.

1479
02:12:20,170 --> 02:12:22,500
我喜欢潜艇舰长
I like sub commanders.

1480
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:26,440
他们没时间讲废话，我也一样
They don't have time for bullshit, and neither do I.

1481
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:28,170
开始吧，先生们
Fire away, gentlemen.

1482
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:46,620
上帝啊！你在哪里？
And where is God in all this?

1483
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:53,400
我们的敌人认为神风在保护他们
Our enemies believe a divine wind protects them.

1484
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:56,940
可我们的朋友却在此长眠
But we see our friends laid out there before us.

1485
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:17,910
(西维吉尼亚号舰长)

1486
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:20,820
别了，舰长
Hey, Captain.

1487
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:46,110
雷夫・麦考利中尉、丹尼・沃克中尉
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley, Daniel Walker.

1488
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:47,150
是的，少校
Yes, Major?

1489
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:50,510
两小时后，你们回本土
You're both going stateside. Fly out in two hours.

1490
02:13:50,890 --> 02:13:51,860
什么事儿？长官
What for, sir?

1491
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:53,720
去问杜立特上校
Ask Colonel Doolittle.

1492
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:57,920
是，长官
Yes, sir.

1493
02:14:14,350 --> 02:14:15,480
你们要出发
You're packing.

1494
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,050
这是任务
Orders.

1495
02:14:21,190 --> 02:14:22,550
什么样的任务？
What kind of orders?

1496
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:25,750
最高机密
The top-secret kind.

1497
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:28,490
也是最危险的？
The dangerous kind.

1498
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:32,240
我没看见丹尼
I can't find Danny.

1499
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:33,930
那是你来这来的原因？
Is that why you're here?

1500
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,030
来找丹尼？
Looking for Danny?

1501
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:40,170
可能在和他的队友告别
我们现在归杜立特指挥
Probably saying good-bye to his squadron. We've been assigned to Doolittle.

1502
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:51,810
我不是来找丹尼的
I wasn't looking for Danny.

1503
02:14:56,790 --> 02:15:00,650
有一件事儿，在你走之前我想你应该知道
I couldn't have you go away without you understanding something.

1504
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:07,960
是吗，你什么都不必解释
Yeah. You don't have to explain anything.

1505
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:11,700
我要，因为你以为我没有爱过你
I do, because you're acting like I didn't love you.

1506
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:15,570
伊夫琳，爱你使我活了下来
Evelyn, loving you kept me alive.

1507
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:28,180
不然，在英国我早就死了
I should've died over there.

1508
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:32,820
当我掉进海里的时候，我向上帝承诺
When I was in that water, I made a deal with God.

1509
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:36,260
我说我后悔极了
I told him I was sorry...

1510
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:41,430
为了当英雄，我离开了你，真是太傻了
I told him that I knew I'd been a fool for leaving you trying to go over there and be a hero...

1511
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:44,870
我向上帝承诺，从今后我别无所求
and I promised I'd never ask for anything again...

1512
02:15:45,870 --> 02:15:48,800
只要我能够再见你一面
...if I could just see you one more time.

1513
02:15:52,350 --> 02:15:54,110
你知道吗？
And you know what?

1514
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:56,870
我觉得我值得这样做
It was worth it.

1515
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:02,180
伊夫琳，是你让我活了下来
是你把我带回了家
You kept me alive, Evelyn. You brought me home.

1516
02:16:03,490 --> 02:16:05,310
所以我要实现我的承诺
So I'm gonna stand by my end of the deal.

1517
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:10,150
我要走了，我对你别无所求
I'm gonna walk away. And I won't ask you for anything.

1518
02:16:10,930 --> 02:16:12,430
但是，我想知道为什么
But I just want to know why.

1519
02:16:12,730 --> 02:16:16,230
请告诉我，好吗？求你了，请告诉我
Just tell me that, will you, please? Just tell me why.

1520
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:19,670
雷夫，我怀孕了
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

1521
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,210
噢，老天
Oh, my God.

1522
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:37,550
我也是你回来那天才知道的
I didn't even know until the day you turned up alive.

1523
02:16:38,890 --> 02:16:44,290
后来就发生了这些事情
我没有告诉丹尼
And then all this happened. I haven't told Danny.

1524
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:46,950
我不想让他知道
I don't want him to know.

1525
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:52,410
他现在需要考虑的是
如何完成任务活着回来
All he needs to think about is how to do this mission and get back alive.

1526
02:16:55,580 --> 02:17:01,890
雷夫，我过去的全部心愿就是嫁给你
和你一起慢慢变老
Rafe, all I ever wanted was for us to have a home, grow old together...

1527
02:17:01,890 --> 02:17:07,820
老天却不让我如愿以偿
现在我要全心全意地爱丹尼
but life never asked me what I wanted. Now, I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart...

1528
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:14,230
我曾经深深的爱着你
无时无刻想着你
but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you.

1529
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:20,600
你是我生命中的最爱
I'll love you my whole life.

1530
02:17:58,350 --> 02:17:59,710
飞机上见
I'll see you on board.

1531
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:24,430
知道吗，我唯一害怕的事情
就是你对他的感情胜过我
You know, the only thing that scares me is that you might love him more than you love me.

1532
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:28,500
我爱你，丹尼！
I love you, Danny.

1533
02:18:31,750 --> 02:18:34,370
我会在这等你，等你完成任务回来
And I'll be here waiting for you when you come back.

1534
02:18:52,430 --> 02:18:53,830
跟我来
Follow me.

1535
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:59,100
上校
Colonel.

1536
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:04,950
祝贺您晋升了，长官
Congratulations on your promotion, sir.

1537
02:19:05,350 --> 02:19:06,780
我听说你们的事情了
I heard what you did.

1538
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:08,440
我们可以解释清楚，长官
We can explain that, sir.

1539
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:10,140
解释什么？
Explain what?

1540
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:12,550
不管你听说到的什么，长官
Whatever it is you heard about us, sir.

1541
02:19:12,650 --> 02:19:14,850
你是指你们穿着花衬衫开飞机？
You mean the hula shirts you were flying in?

1542
02:19:20,430 --> 02:19:22,430
还是你们击落的七架敌机？
Or the seven planes you shot down?

1543
02:19:25,770 --> 02:19:28,050
你们都能够获得银星勋章
You're both being awarded the Silver Star...

1544
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:31,060
还要晋升上尉军衔
and promoted to captain.

1545
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:34,570
就是这些好消息吗？长官，或…
Is that the good news, sir, or...

1546
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:39,340
在陆军飞行员之中
你们是唯一有实战经验的
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with combat experience.

1547
02:19:39,450 --> 02:19:42,810
我需要你们完成一项任务
I need you for a mission I've been ordered to put together.

1548
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:46,110
你们知道什么事最绝密吗？
You know what top secret is?

1549
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:47,880
是，长官
Yes, sir.

1550
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:52,520
就是你能够获得勋章
但是他们只能颁发给你的家属
It's the kind of mission where you get medals. But they send them to your relatives.

1551
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:57,460
最高绝密，就是说你们将为航空史上
绝无先例的任务接受训练
Top secret means you train for something never done before in aviation history...

1552
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,560
甚至连去哪儿都不能知道
and you go without knowing where you're going.

1553
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:03,840
你们干还是不干
You do it on that basis or not at all.

1554
02:20:04,910 --> 02:20:05,840
我要去，长官
I'll go, sir.

1555
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:08,930
我也去，长官
I'll go, too, sir.

1556
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:14,770
另外，麦考利，英方送来了你的私人物品
谢谢，长官
By the way, the Brits sent over your personal effects. Thank you, sir.

1557
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:19,990
还有一件事我要告诉你们
把你们的花衬衫留在家里
There's only one more thing I can tell you. Leave your goddamn hula shirts at home.

1558
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:24,810
亲爱的雷夫
Dear Rafe...

1559
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:27,280
没有你的日子我很不习惯
It's so strange to be this far from you...

1560
02:20:27,350 --> 02:20:31,440
但你应该每个这样的夜晚…
but you should know this every night...

1561
02:20:40,830 --> 02:20:42,920
我到处找你
I've been looking all over for you.

1562
02:20:44,370 --> 02:20:46,090
丹尼，这…
Danny, this...

1563
02:20:47,470 --> 02:20:49,600
…现在这个时候我们最好开诚布公
this ain't no time to leave things unsaid.

1564
02:20:50,970 --> 02:20:52,910
我们要面对现实
Now, we got to face facts here.

1565
02:20:52,970 --> 02:20:56,210
现实就是，我们爱上同一个女人
The fact is, we just both love the same woman.

1566
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:07,140
你知道她是我爱上的第一个女孩，雷夫
You know she's the first girl I ever felt this way about, Rafe.

1567
02:21:09,390 --> 02:21:12,760
我情不自禁，就跟你一样
I couldn't help what happened any more than you could.

1568
02:21:16,930 --> 02:21:19,260
可是这次不一样，丹尼
This is different, though, Danny.

1569
02:21:19,330 --> 02:21:21,060
伊夫琳曾经失去过一次爱人
Evelyn already lost the man she loved once.

1570
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:23,070
我不想这样的事情再次发生在她身上
I just don't want it to see that happen to her again.

1571
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:26,270
我们没有选择，这是战争
Guys like us got no choice. This is war.

1572
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:27,860
她很清楚
She knows that.

1573
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:30,470
丹尼，别这样
Danny, don't do this.

1574
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:31,980
别参加这次任务
Don't go on this mission.

1575
02:21:33,210 --> 02:21:35,010
你不必证明什么
You got nothing to prove.

1576
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:38,950
你从小就在保护我
You've been protecting me since we were kids.

1577
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:42,020
对，没错
Yeah,well...

1578
02:21:42,090 --> 02:21:44,420
你这人是挺需要保护的
you do tend to need it from time to time.

1579
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:53,820
(一九四二年三月三日)

1580
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:07,390
我要求你们自愿参加的任务非常危险
The mission I'm asking you to volunteer for... is exceptionally dangerous.

1581
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:10,930
看看你身边的同伴
Take a look at the man beside you.

1582
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:18,440
很可能六个星期后
你，或者是他已经牺牲了
It's a good bet that in the next six weeks... you or he... will be dead.

1583
02:22:21,350 --> 02:22:26,750
有足够勇气的… 向前一步
Everyone brave enough to accept this... step forward.

1584
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,930
你们的祖母可以驾驶 B-25
在一英里的跑道上起飞
Your grandmother could take a B-25 off... on a mile-long runway.

1585
02:22:39,730 --> 02:22:43,640
现在我要求你们
在四百六十七英尺的跑道上起飞
Well, I'm gonna train you to do it in 467 feet.

1586
02:22:44,470 --> 02:22:49,140
因为超过了四百六十七英尺
你只有命丧黄泉
Because at 468 feet... you're dead.

1587
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:52,320
起飞后，要象驾驶战斗机一样
And once you get it up you'll learn to fly it like a fighter...

1588
02:22:53,650 --> 02:22:55,920
距离地面三十英尺飞行
...thirty feet off the ground.

1589
02:22:56,450 --> 02:22:59,150
这位是海军航空兵的杰克・理查兹上尉
I want you to say hello to Lieutenant Jack Richards, Navy Aviation.

1590
02:22:59,150 --> 02:23:02,050
他将帮我们为这些胖妞减减肥
He'll help us lighten these fat ladies.

1591
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:06,720
把那个箱子扔掉
看到瞄准镜了吗？卸掉
Dump that ashcan. Dumpt hat ashcan. See that bomb sight? Get rid of it.

1592
02:23:06,830 --> 02:23:08,450
上校，他疯啦！
Colonel, he's crazy!

1593
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:09,620
这位女士太肥了
The lady's fat!

1594
02:23:09,730 --> 02:23:10,560
听他指挥
Listen to him.

1595
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:12,630
不要胖妞，我们要一位骨感美的美女
She's fat lady. We want a skinny lady!

1596
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:18,830
开足马力
Max power!

1597
02:23:22,210 --> 02:23:23,540
拉起来，拉起来！
Get up, get up!

1598
02:23:26,080 --> 02:23:26,980
见鬼！
Damn!

1599
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:36,790
他们超过了起飞线
They just keep rolling past that line.

1600
02:23:36,890 --> 02:23:38,050
也许是这个主意不好
Maybe it's a bad idea.

1601
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,820
不，还是太重，得动大手术
No, they're too heavy. We gotta get drastic.

1602
02:23:40,930 --> 02:23:42,720
这些防弹板
This armored plating goes.

1603
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:45,560
对，就是它
就像脱裙子一样卸掉，年轻人
I'm sure, I'm sure. Lose it like a skirt, son.

1604
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:46,690
松开刹车
Release brakes!

1605
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:50,760
快…快…
Come on, come on!

1606
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:55,830
让所有人都站过来
Put every man on the line now!

1607
02:23:58,750 --> 02:24:01,380
我们告诉他们怎么飞
Let's show these boys how this thing is done!

1608
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:04,540
准备好！开足马力！
Come on! Max power.

1609
02:24:10,660 --> 02:24:12,520
看，如果他行…
Well, if he can do it...

1610
02:24:20,270 --> 02:24:23,030
(一九四二年四月二日
大黄蜂号航空母舰)

1611
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:33,810
先生们，现在我可以告诉你们
我们要去东京…
Well, gentlemen, now I can tell you... that we're going to Tokyo.

1612
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:36,970
去轰炸它
And we're gonna bomb it.

1613
02:24:42,490 --> 02:24:46,950
这是罗斯福总统直接特批的任务
That comes as a special request directly from President Roosevelt.

1614
02:24:47,060 --> 02:24:50,160
海军送我们到距日本本土四百海里的地方
The Navy'll sneak us about 400 miles off the Japanese coast...

1615
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:51,690
然后我们从航母上起飞
and we'll launch from the carrier there.

1616
02:24:51,730 --> 02:24:56,100
以前曾经这么干过吗？
陆军轰炸机从海军航母上起飞？
Has that been done before? Taking Army bombers off Navy carriers?

1617
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:57,000
没有
No.

1618
02:24:58,140 --> 02:24:59,160
好吧
OK.

1619
02:24:59,270 --> 02:25:00,170
还有问题吗？
Any other questions?

1620
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:05,570
嗯，长官，B-25 能在
航母甲板上降落吗？
Well, sir, is it even possible to land a B-25 on an aircraft carrier deck?

1621
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:07,270
不存在这个问题
That won't matter.

1622
02:25:07,380 --> 02:25:10,680
我们起飞后，航母马上返航回夏威夷
As soon as we're airborne, the carrier heads for Hawaii.

1623
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:12,950
没有航母，那我们在哪儿降落？
But without them, where do we land?

1624
02:25:13,050 --> 02:25:16,110
我要你们都学会用中文说一句话
I have a phrase I want you to memorize.

1625
02:25:17,290 --> 02:25:20,490
我是一个美国人
Wo shi yi ge mei guo ren.

1626
02:25:20,590 --> 02:25:24,220
意思是“我是一个美国人”
It means 'I am an American'.

1627
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:26,130
用中国话说
In Chinese.

1628
02:25:27,470 --> 02:25:31,130
这可不简单，甲板比我们训练的
起飞距离还短三英尺
ain't gonna be any easier. That's three feet shorter than our practice runway.

1629
02:25:31,140 --> 02:25:32,200
两位
Fellas?

1630
02:25:32,310 --> 02:25:33,570
长官
Sir.

1631
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:39,700
这是海军部长给的
Secretary of the Navy gave me these.

1632
02:25:41,450 --> 02:25:42,310
什么东西？
What are they?

1633
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:45,940
日本人送的友谊勋章
那时候他们还在大谈和平
Friendship medals the Japanese gave us when they were pretending to want peace.

1634
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:47,380
我们拿它有什么用？
What'll you do with them?

1635
02:25:47,850 --> 02:25:50,080
系在炸弹上还给他们
Wire them to the bombs and give them back.

1636
02:25:54,190 --> 02:25:55,390
还有什么事？
So what's going on?

1637
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:57,490
长官，我们只有十六架轰炸机
Well, sir, we only have sixteen planes.

1638
02:25:58,130 --> 02:25:59,120
那又怎样？
So?

1639
02:25:59,230 --> 02:26:03,130
如果日本人反击，他们能够出动三百多架
When the Japs hit us, they had more than 300.

1640
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:04,570
力量对比太悬殊
How much difference can we make?

1641
02:26:04,670 --> 02:26:09,770
我们并不是害怕，我们可能会死
但我们想知道这是为什么
It's not that we're afraid, sir. But we might die, and we want to know what it's for.

1642
02:26:13,110 --> 02:26:15,550
在珍珠港，他们疯狂地袭击了我们
You know, at Pearl, they hit us with a sledgehammer.

1643
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:21,150
这次空袭，即使成功…
This raid, even if we make it through...

1644
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:24,280
…也微不足道
it'll only be a pinprick...

1645
02:26:24,390 --> 02:26:26,290
但我们这是在直接打击他们的心脏
but it'll be straight through their hearts.

1646
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:32,750
胜利属于那些信念坚定…永不动摇的人们
Victory belongs to those that believe in it the most... and believe in it the longest.

1647
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:38,870
我们坚信胜利
我们也要让美国人民坚信胜利
We're gonna believe. We're gonna make America believe, too.

1648
02:26:38,970 --> 02:26:41,200
上校，请来一下
Colonel? I need a minute.

1649
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,000
对不起，杰克森少校
Excuse me, Major Jackson?

1650
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:46,010
是
Yes?

1651
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:49,170
你还记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

1652
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:53,180
当然记得 我还没感谢你呢
Oh, sure I do. I'm sorry. I've been meaning to thank you.

1653
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:54,980
你的机会来了
Well, maybe you can.

1654
02:26:55,090 --> 02:26:59,820
我想去指挥所听听杜立特部下发回的消息
When the news comes in about the Doolittle boys I want to be in the command post.

1655
02:27:00,890 --> 02:27:03,760
抱歉，我不知道你在说什么
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.

1656
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:07,930
你怎么知道这项任务？
How the hell do you know about this mission?

1657
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:11,070
算是不慎泄漏吧
Let's call it an inadvertent disclosure.

1658
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:13,500
是某个和你约会的飞行员说的？
Some flyboy you're dating shot his mouth off.

1659
02:27:15,010 --> 02:27:20,040
实际上，是两名飞行员
我知道他们面对巨大的危险
Actually, it's about two pilots. I know they're going into great danger.

1660
02:27:20,150 --> 02:27:23,740
我只想在那儿亲耳听到
他们生还或是牺牲的消息
I just want to be there when the news tells us if they've lived or died.

1661
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:30,450
要是其他军官早就把你扔进监狱了
Most officers would have thrown you in the brig.

1662
02:27:30,490 --> 02:27:34,550
要是别的护士早就顾不上你
没时间用手按住你流血的动脉
Most nurses wouldn't keep their fingers plugged in your artery.

1663
02:27:40,370 --> 02:27:42,460
我不能保证什么
I can't promise you anything.

1664
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:50,000
嘿，雷德
Hey, Red,

1665
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:54,550
你以为他们选中我们
是因为我们年轻，好说话吗？
you think they pickedus to do this bcause we're young and dumb?

1666
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:58,150
拜托，古斯，因为我们是精英
Come on, Gooz, we're the tip of the sword.

1667
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:05,660
(为了贝蒂)

1668
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:19,860
为了我们的日本之行
我搞到一些胜利雪茄
In honor of our trip to Japan... I got us some victory cigars!

1669
02:28:21,510 --> 02:28:24,530
拿去吧，放在靠近心脏的步袋里
There you go. Put that in your inside pocket, next to your heart.

1670
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:29,680
知道吗，杰克，这一仗可能会失败
但我们一定能赢得这场战争
You know, Jack, we may lose this battle... but we're gonna win this war.

1671
02:28:29,780 --> 02:28:30,980
你明白我的意思吗？
You know how I know?

1672
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:32,520
不知道
No.

1673
02:28:34,150 --> 02:28:37,650
他们，因为他们的杰出贡献
Them. bcause they're rare.

1674
02:28:39,250 --> 02:28:44,690
因为他们在这种关键时刻，自愿挺身而出
And at times like these, you see them... stepping forward.

1675
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:50,190
自愿者的意志无坚不摧，杰克
There's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer, Jack.

1676
02:28:55,070 --> 02:28:59,030
我在作战部的朋友
不想让我指挥这次空袭
My friends in the war department don't want me to lead this raid...

1677
02:28:59,150 --> 02:29:01,270
他们说我太宝贵了
because they say I'm too valuable.

1678
02:29:02,380 --> 02:29:06,220
他们不希望我
跟我挑选的飞行员一起出任务
They don't want me up in the air flying with the men that I've chosen...

1679
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:09,550
可他们是我挑选的，是我训练和逼出来的
that I've chewed out, cussed out, pushed to the limit...

1680
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:14,450
我很尊重这些飞行员
and that I've come to respect.

1681
02:29:17,250 --> 02:29:21,800
他们想让我在甲板上发号施令
但我不想那样做
They want me to stand on the flightdeck and wave you off. Well, I don't see it that way.

1682
02:29:23,740 --> 02:29:24,990
我要跟你们一起去
So I'm going with you.

1683
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:33,950
我们明天下午起飞
轰炸完毕后去中国
We take off tomorrow afternoon... drop our fire, and head for China.

1684
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:38,380
我们的任务是轰炸他们的军事目标
飞机工厂和坦克工厂
Our mission is to hit military targets... aircraft and tank factories.

1685
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:44,590
上校，你说我们有返航引导信号
但你又说…中国到处是日本军队
Colonel, you've given us homing beacons... but you said China is overrun with Japanese troops.

1686
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:46,620
如果信号中断，怎么办？
What if the beacons are switched off?

1687
02:29:46,730 --> 02:29:49,660
那就紧急迫降并尽量避免被日本人抓住
Bring her down any way you can...and do your best to avoid capture.

1688
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:52,930
如果必须在日本人的上空跳伞
我们该怎么办？
What if we have to bail out over Japan?

1689
02:29:53,030 --> 02:29:57,160
这种情况，我无可奉告
Well, in that situation, I can't tell you what to do.

1690
02:29:57,840 --> 02:29:59,130
你会怎么做，上校？
What would you do, Colonel?

1691
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:04,730
我天生不会做俘虏
I wasn't built to be a prisoner...

1692
02:30:06,650 --> 02:30:09,510
所以我会先让机组跳伞
so I would have my crew bail out.

1693
02:30:10,150 --> 02:30:15,280
然后选择一个重要的军事目标驾机
与敌人同归于尽
I'd find the sweetest military target I could and drive my plane right smack into the middle of it

1694
02:30:21,850 --> 02:30:23,380
但这仅限于我
But that's just me.

1695
02:30:26,950 --> 02:30:30,260
我是四十五岁的老家伙
而你们还有很长的路要走
I'm forty-five years old. I'm an old man. You guys have your whole lives ahead of you...

1696
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:34,260
一切由你们自己决定
so what you do is up to you.

1697
02:30:41,550 --> 02:30:43,360
再有几个小时就要开始行动了
The mission will launch in a couple of hours.

1698
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:45,940
一九四二年四月十八日

1699
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:45,940
你就待在这
You'll stay right in here.

1700
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:51,710
这，待在这儿
Here. Stay here.

1701
02:30:51,720 --> 02:30:53,250
别和她们说话，她们也没空理你的
Don't talk to them. They won't talk to you.

1702
02:30:53,250 --> 02:30:56,650
假装打我们发给你的信息，就这样
Pretend to type the information we pass you. That's it.

1703
02:30:58,860 --> 02:31:02,260
这儿是东京广播电台 孤儿安妮开始播音
This is Orphan Annie from Radio Tokyo.

1704
02:31:02,370 --> 02:31:05,100
南太平洋上孤独的小伙子们
To all the lonely boys in the South Pacific...

1705
02:31:05,100 --> 02:31:07,400
小心，敌人会找上你
watch out... the enemy will get you.

1706
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:08,970
也许她说的对
Maybe she's right.

1707
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:17,040
日本人在发报！
Japs transmitting!

1708
02:31:17,150 --> 02:31:20,840
舰长，雷达发现距离四百码处
有日本巡逻艇
Captain, radar reports Japanese patrol boats. Range 400 yards.

1709
02:31:20,950 --> 02:31:23,110
多远？四百码，正在靠近，长官
How many yards? 400 yards and closing, sir.

1710
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:25,820
理查兹，快，日军逼近，快走
Richards, Japs! 400 yards! Let's go!

1711
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:28,990
哈尔西将军命令巡洋舰开火
Admiral Halsey's ordering the cruisers to open fire!

1712
02:31:29,090 --> 02:31:32,030
日本巡逻艇可能会报告我们的位置
We gotta sink these Jap boats before they give us away.

1713
02:31:32,130 --> 02:31:33,150
全体人员就位
Go to general quarters!

1714
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:35,700
快…快…
Go, go, go, go!

1715
02:31:36,770 --> 02:31:37,960
我的天
Oh, my God.

1716
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:41,100
情况不妙
This can't be good!

1717
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:50,600
日本人距离一海里，正在报告我们的位置
Japs one mile away. They reported our position.

1718
02:31:50,710 --> 02:31:53,400
预定起飞点在四百海里处
现在还有多远
Supposed to launch 400 miles away. How far are we now?

1719
02:31:53,420 --> 02:31:55,080
还有六百二十四海里
624 miles.

1720
02:31:55,190 --> 02:31:57,380
老天！你要怎么办？
Jesus! What do you want to do?

1721
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:06,560
我不知道，上校
我不知道我们的燃料能否飞到中国
I don't know, Colonel, I don't know if the planes can carry enough fuel to make it to China.

1722
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:09,370
我们现在起飞
Now. We launch now!

1723
02:32:10,730 --> 02:32:15,030
陆军飞行员，立即就位！
Army pilots! Man your planes! Man your planes!

1724
02:32:17,870 --> 02:32:18,860
他们已经开火了！
They're shooting at something.

1725
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:21,210
这不是演习，快走！
Let's go! It ain't a drill!

1726
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:35,780
上校！距离太远飞机飞不过去！
Colonel! We're too far out to make it!

1727
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:39,090
他们需要加更多的油
但油多了飞机又太重，起飞有困难
They need more fuel, but they can't get too heavy!

1728
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:42,820
听着！卸下所有能卸的东西！马上去办！
Listen! Strip everything out of this plane you don't need now!

1729
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:46,800
我要做飞行前检查！快！
Start pre-flight! Let's go!

1730
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:50,900
每架飞机多带十桶油！所有飞机都是！
Add ten cans of fuel for each plane! Every plane!

1731
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:56,370
动作快点
Let's go! Move!

1732
02:32:56,480 --> 02:32:58,070
伙计们，快上去
Guys, get up there!

1733
02:32:58,180 --> 02:32:59,740
快把皮箱丢掉
Lose those suitcases now!

1734
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:01,640
还有你的宝贝机枪
什么？
What's your favorite gun? What?

1735
02:33:01,790 --> 02:33:06,850
快卸下一挺机枪！马上！
否则飞机太重了！
You want off this deck, give me a gun now! It's still too heavy!

1736
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:10,560
你，去厨房找几根扫把
You, go to the kitchen, get some broomsticks.

1737
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:13,060
把它们锯断，染黑后拿过来
Cut them down, paint them black, and bring them here.

1738
02:33:13,160 --> 02:33:16,560
把扫把放在机枪的位置上
你在对我的飞机干什么？
We'll put a broomstick where this gun was. What are you doing to my plane?

1739
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:20,860
起飞前叫机组人员小便，减轻起飞重量
Tell your crew to take a piss before they take off.

1740
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:25,570
我们的尾部机枪换成了扫把
We got broomsticks for tail guns.

1741
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:28,510
是啊，能吓死日本人
Yeah. Maybe it'll scare them.

1742
02:33:29,710 --> 02:33:31,180
你要多保重
You take care of yourself up there.

1743
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:32,910
没问题，我会的
Yeah, I will.

1744
02:33:33,020 --> 02:33:35,610
丹尼，要小心！听到了吗？
Danny, be careful, you hear me?

1745
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:37,580
我会的，回头见，雷夫
I will, see you, Rafe.

1746
02:33:37,690 --> 02:33:39,950
雷夫！我们是精英
Rafe! We're the tip of the sword!

1747
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:47,310
启动一号螺旋桨
Turning on one!

1748
02:33:47,420 --> 02:33:48,850
启动二号螺旋桨
Turning on two!

1749
02:33:53,350 --> 02:33:54,350
好了
All right.

1750
02:33:55,360 --> 02:33:57,120
你准备好了吗？
You ready for this?

1751
02:33:59,170 --> 02:34:00,700
增压舱压力低并关闭！
Super chargers low and latched!

1752
02:34:00,700 --> 02:34:02,230
压力低并关闭！
Low and latched.

1753
02:34:02,230 --> 02:34:03,930
我们要逆风航行
We're full into the wind!

1754
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:06,030
加速航行！加速航行！
More speed! More speed!

1755
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:18,470
你紧张吗？
Are you nervous?

1756
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:20,110
不紧张…长官
是有点
No... yes, sir. Yes.

1757
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:21,780
什么时候开始信教了？
When did you find religion?

1758
02:34:21,890 --> 02:34:24,150
在你选中我的时候，长官
When you assigned me to this mission, sir.

1759
02:34:24,260 --> 02:34:25,480
帮我个忙
I want you do me a favor.

1760
02:34:25,590 --> 02:34:26,580
什么忙？上校
What's that, Colonel?

1761
02:34:26,690 --> 02:34:27,950
替我们祷告
Pray for both of us.

1762
02:34:29,300 --> 02:34:30,350
走吧
Let's go!

1763
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:40,500
开足马力！
Max power!

1764
02:34:46,850 --> 02:34:49,540
快点快点
Come on! Come on!

1765
02:34:58,840 --> 02:34:59,540
太棒了！
Yeah!

1766
02:34:59,540 --> 02:35:01,240
该我们了！
Way to go!

1767
02:35:03,400 --> 02:35:04,860
天啊，跑道太短了
Jesus, that was short.

1768
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:09,490
快…快…
Move them up!

1769
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:12,040
全速前进，来吧
Full power, here we go!

1770
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:28,310
来吧，来吧
Come on, here we go, here we go!

1771
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:42,470
我们成功了！
We made it!

1772
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:07,520
在柏林，罗马和东京，有人说
我们是懦夫和纨绔子弟的国家
From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo we have been described as anation of weaklings and playboys...

1773
02:36:07,630 --> 02:36:13,760
只能雇佣英国、苏联
或中国的士兵替我们打仗
who hire British, Russian, or Chinese soldiers... to do our fighting forus.

1774
02:36:13,870 --> 02:36:16,490
现在让他们再重复一遍
Let them repeat that now.

1775
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:20,090
让他们向麦克阿瑟将军
和他们的士兵们说吧
Let them tell that to General MacArthur and his men.

1776
02:36:20,210 --> 02:36:28,040
让他们对那些浴血奋战在…
太平洋上的士兵们说吧
Let them tell that to the soldiers who today are fighting hard in the far waters of the Pacific.

1777
02:36:28,150 --> 02:36:32,170
让他们对空中堡垒的勇士们说吧
Let them tell that to the boys in the flying fortresses.

1778
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:35,120
让他们对海军陆战队的官兵说吧
Let them tell that to the Marines.

1779
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:39,750
日本就在前面，伙计们，保持队形
That's Japan, fellas. Tighten up back there!

1780
02:36:40,290 --> 02:36:41,690
准备战斗
Man your guns!

1781
02:36:42,590 --> 02:36:44,360
我们到敌人的老家了
We're in the enemy's backyard!

1782
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:48,390
准备就绪，我看到了海岸线
Look alive back there. I see coastline.

1783
02:36:55,570 --> 02:36:57,170
提高警戒！小伙子们，提高警戒！
Heads up, boys! Heads up!

1784
02:37:02,410 --> 02:37:03,750
一切准备完毕！
Man your guns back there.

1785
02:37:03,850 --> 02:37:05,610
机关枪上膛
I'm cocked and locked!

1786
02:37:05,720 --> 02:37:07,450
狗日的，等着挨炸吧
Get ready, suckers!

1787
02:37:15,530 --> 02:37:20,120
接近轰炸目标，准备投弹…
Approaching targets for bombing raid! Open bomb bay doors.

1788
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:22,860
看到目标吗？
Ripley, you gota target in sight?

1789
02:37:23,770 --> 02:37:25,830
三十七度！目标进入视野
37 degrees! Target in sight!

1790
02:37:34,810 --> 02:37:37,010
好了，小伙子们
让他们也尝尝挨炸的滋味！
All right, boys, let's knock their clocks off!

1791
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:38,170
投弹！
Drop your ordnance!

1792
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:40,010
投下炸弹！投下第一枚
Bombs away! One away!

1793
02:37:41,290 --> 02:37:43,280
投弹…
Bombs away! Bombs away!

1794
02:37:43,390 --> 02:37:44,950
第二枚
Two away!

1795
02:37:54,030 --> 02:37:56,130
第三枚、第四枚
Three away! Four away!

1796
02:38:00,440 --> 02:38:03,240
我们让他们也吃一惊！投弹！
We caught them by surprise! Dropping ordnance!

1797
02:38:03,340 --> 02:38:05,140
连续投弹
Bombs away!

1798
02:38:05,240 --> 02:38:07,270
命中兵工厂
...factory.

1799
02:38:13,850 --> 02:38:17,110
我们成功了！我们命中目标！
干得好！
We got it! We hit our targets! Good job, raiders!

1800
02:38:35,210 --> 02:38:36,640
到处都是敌人的高射炮火！
We got flak everywhere!

1801
02:38:39,010 --> 02:38:40,440
怎么回事？
Go down there and get Gooz!

1802
02:38:40,550 --> 02:38:42,840
我命令大家立即分散
I want everyone to separate!

1803
02:38:42,950 --> 02:38:45,470
赶快调整频率，是，长官
赶快调整频率！
Clean that up! Yes, sir. Try and clean that up!

1804
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,260
高射炮正在向我们射击！
我们得快脱身，古斯！
They're shooting flak at us! We gotta get out of this shit, Gooz!

1805
02:39:04,140 --> 02:39:07,400
起火了
We got a fire!

1806
02:39:07,510 --> 02:39:10,570
机尾被击中！电器系统着火了！
Tail's hit! The electrics! We got a fire backhere!

1807
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:12,740
我马上就把它扑灭
I gotta short this out!

1808
02:39:12,850 --> 02:39:15,540
飞进云层，丹尼！快！
Get into the clouds, Danny, right now!

1809
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:31,190
可恶
God damn!

1810
02:39:32,530 --> 02:39:33,930
雷德，快去检查一下！
Red, go check that out!

1811
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:41,100
到处都是炮火
We're getting covered!

1812
02:39:41,210 --> 02:39:42,840
希望螺旋桨别被打中！
Just hope they don't hit a prop!

1813
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:48,780
我受伤了！
I'm hit!

1814
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:50,440
飞机要被打烂了
They're tearing this plane apart!

1815
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:54,520
雷德，快拉高到八百英尺
Red, take it up, 800 feet.

1816
02:39:58,390 --> 02:40:00,150
西欧好像死了
I think Theo's dead!

1817
02:40:00,260 --> 02:40:03,160
西欧，快醒醒，西欧
Theo, wake up! Theo!

1818
02:40:04,030 --> 02:40:06,790
快飞进云层，丹尼，要快！飞进云层！
Get into the clouds, Danny, right now! Get up in that soup!

1819
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:09,030
马上离开这里，古斯
We're gonna pull out of this, Gooz!

1820
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:23,610
谢谢你，乔治
Thank you, George.

1821
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:30,090
有消息吗？将军
What is it, General?

1822
02:40:30,190 --> 02:40:34,750
杜立特上校不得不提前
十二个小时起飞，总统先生
Colonel Doolittle had to advance his execution order by twelve hours, Mr. President.

1823
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:39,060
没有引导信号了，导航机在中国坠毁
There will be no homing beacons. The plane carrying them crashed en route to China...

1824
02:40:39,160 --> 02:40:42,570
我们的轰炸机燃油不足
他们飞不到中国大陆
and our bombers may lack the fuel to reach the mainland, sir.

1825
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:49,230
那他们等于是瞎了眼睛，空着油箱在飞行
So our boys are flying blind on empty tanks.

1826
02:40:50,180 --> 02:40:51,670
上帝保佑他们
God help them.

1827
02:41:00,220 --> 02:41:01,620
还是没收到信号
We're still not getting a signal.

1828
02:41:03,090 --> 02:41:07,450
一片汪洋，看不见有陆地，也没有信号
All ocean and no land. Homing in on nothing.

1829
02:41:09,590 --> 02:41:11,590
我们还剩几桶油？
How many cans of fuel we got left?

1830
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:13,390
这些都空了
These are all empty!

1831
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:16,190
只剩这桶吗？
Is this all you got?

1832
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:18,060
对，只有这点了，雷德
That's all we got, Red.

1833
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:21,730
雷夫，你最好祈祷陆地快些出现吧
Rafe! You better pray for land!

1834
02:41:26,450 --> 02:41:27,970
恢复无线电通话
Break radio silence.

1835
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:32,410
很抱歉，先生
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1836
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:37,610
你们非常勇敢
是我见过的最英勇的飞行员
You're all brave souls. The bravest I've ever had the privilege of flying with.

1837
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:40,550
但现在我们只能靠自己了
But we're on our own.

1838
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:47,820
这真是一项自杀型的任务
This really was a suicide mission.

1839
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:04,520
注意，一号引擎出现问题
Engine one's fluctuating.

1840
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:06,520
它随时都会熄火
We'll lose it any minute.

1841
02:42:08,120 --> 02:42:09,720
雷夫，快给引擎加油
Rafe, you gotta prime it.

1842
02:42:09,720 --> 02:42:11,220
我正在加！
现在怎么样？
I am. How about now?

1843
02:42:15,330 --> 02:42:18,190
我看见海岸了，看见海岸了！
I see the coast. I see the coast!

1844
02:42:19,400 --> 02:42:20,990
收到，雷夫
Copy that, Rafe.

1845
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:22,730
我们准备着陆
We're gonna make it.

1846
02:42:22,830 --> 02:42:24,600
丹尼，跟着我，我们要成功了
Danny, follow me. We can make this.

1847
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:26,570
陆地就在前面，只有几英里远
I can see the coast now. We're only a few miles out.

1848
02:42:26,570 --> 02:42:27,470
跟着我
Follow me.

1849
02:42:27,570 --> 02:42:30,300
我们要找个土质松软的地方着陆
We gotta find a soft landing spot.

1850
02:42:30,610 --> 02:42:31,940
二号引擎加速
I'm pushing up on two.

1851
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:34,380
我们马上迫降
Hold on for a hard landing!

1852
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:37,450
我看到一片稻田，我们就迫降在那
I see rice paddies. We'll bring it in right here.

1853
02:42:39,890 --> 02:42:41,910
噢，天啊，一号引擎熄火了
Oh, God, engine one's dead.

1854
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:44,320
二号引擎马上也要熄火了
We'll lose engine two any second.

1855
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:52,760
我们可以迫降了，放松，注意减速
不用油，我们滑翔着陆
We can make it in. Easy. Pull it back, glide in on fumes.

1856
02:42:55,570 --> 02:42:58,900
日本鬼子，着陆点有日本巡逻队…
Japs! We got Jap patrols all over the place!

1857
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:04,100
丹尼，到别处降落
坐好了，这会很颠簸
Land somewhere else! Strap yourselves in! We're coming in hard!

1858
02:43:04,210 --> 02:43:05,730
我们死定了
We're a deadstick.

1859
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:07,330
离开机头
Get outta the nose!

1860
02:43:08,350 --> 02:43:10,370
抓紧了，伙计们！我们开始着陆了！
Hold on, boys! We're going down!

1861
02:43:13,050 --> 02:43:14,310
小心树枝！
Watch the trees!

1862
02:43:38,910 --> 02:43:40,470
有人受伤吗？
Everyone all right?

1863
02:43:41,350 --> 02:43:44,650
我没事儿…
I'm OK! I'm OK!

1864
02:43:44,750 --> 02:43:46,150
瑞普利呢？
Where's Ripley?

1865
02:43:47,120 --> 02:43:48,210
他已死了
He's dead.

1866
02:43:49,820 --> 02:43:51,150
注意日本鬼子
Watch for Japs!

1867
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:01,460
日本巡逻队！
Jap patrols!

1868
02:44:01,570 --> 02:44:02,730
快找掩体
Take cover!

1869
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:22,420
谁还有备用弹匣？
我有
Who's got magazines? Got em!

1870
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:26,180
我们要去那边山里找中国人
Gotta get up into those hills, find the Chinese!

1871
02:44:30,700 --> 02:44:31,960
我们受到火力压制！
They got us pinned down!

1872
02:44:42,910 --> 02:44:46,310
丹尼！雷夫！不！
Danny! Rafe! Rafe, no!

1873
02:44:47,380 --> 02:44:48,850
丹尼！
雷夫，没有救了！
Danny! Rafe, you don't have a chance!

1874
02:44:52,850 --> 02:44:56,290
天啊，丹尼，快呀
God damn. Danny! Come on!

1875
02:45:01,790 --> 02:45:02,650
丹尼！
Danny!

1876
02:45:03,130 --> 02:45:05,760
噢，妈的，安东尼死了
Aw, shit, Anthony.

1877
02:45:05,860 --> 02:45:09,660
古斯，你听到吗？
Gooz! Can you hear me?

1878
02:45:09,770 --> 02:45:11,290
醒醒
Yeah. Come on.

1879
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:14,870
丹尼，放松，放松点
Danny. Easy, easy, easy.

1880
02:45:14,970 --> 02:45:16,270
我这次搞砸了
I've had better landings.

1881
02:45:16,270 --> 02:45:17,870
你救了我们
You saved us back there.

1882
02:45:17,980 --> 02:45:19,440
我脖子受伤了
I got something in my neck.

1883
02:45:19,540 --> 02:45:21,510
我帮你拔出来
古斯在哪儿？
Let me pull this out. Where's Gooz?

1884
02:45:21,610 --> 02:45:23,270
他没事，他就在那儿
He's fine. He's right over there.

1885
02:46:43,430 --> 02:46:44,450
手榴弹！
Grenade!

1886
02:46:45,460 --> 02:46:46,860
快趴下！
Get down!

1887
02:46:53,940 --> 02:46:55,130
丹尼
Danny!

1888
02:46:55,240 --> 02:46:56,430
丹尼
Danny.

1889
02:46:57,610 --> 02:46:58,940
丹尼
Danny!

1890
02:47:02,580 --> 02:47:08,080
撑着点，我来了，你不会有事的
Hold on! Rafe! Hold on, now. I got you. You're all right. You're all right.

1891
02:47:09,090 --> 02:47:11,980
我…我不行了
I'm not gonna make it.

1892
02:47:16,030 --> 02:47:18,660
你不会死的，看着我，丹尼
Oh, yes, you are. Yes, you are. Now look at me.

1893
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:24,070
雷夫，我好冷，冷极了！
Rafe, I'm so cold. I'm so cold.

1894
02:47:24,170 --> 02:47:26,400
你不会有事
You're all right. Hey.

1895
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:36,070
雷夫，帮我一个忙
什么？
Hey, Rafe? Can you do me a favor? What?

1896
02:47:36,180 --> 02:47:39,710
你要找别人替我写墓志铭
Can you have someone else write my name on the tombstone?

1897
02:47:41,020 --> 02:47:45,820
你不会死，听我说！
你不会死的，你听见了吗？
You're not gonna die. Look at me, listen to me! You ain't gonna die, you hear me?

1898
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:50,830
丹尼…你不能死，你知道为什么吗？
Danny. Danny, you can't die. You can't die. You know why?

1899
02:47:50,930 --> 02:47:52,660
因为你要当爸爸了
Bcause you're gonna be a father.

1900
02:47:54,300 --> 02:47:57,630
你快当爸爸了，我本来不该告诉你
You're gonna be a daddy. I wasn't supposed to tell you.

1901
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:01,970
你要当爸爸了
You're gonna be a father.

1902
02:48:03,470 --> 02:48:05,030
求求你…
Please.

1903
02:48:09,310 --> 02:48:11,250
不，你才是
No. You are.

1904
02:48:20,990 --> 02:48:21,980
丹尼…
Danny.

1905
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:32,000
别死啊，丹尼…
Danny? Danny? Please, please!

1906
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:39,500
上帝啊，丹尼
Please. God. Please, Danny.

1907
02:48:50,660 --> 02:48:53,780
别开枪，他们是中国人
Hold your fire! They're Chinese.

1908
02:50:14,810 --> 02:50:20,870
这次行动结束后回首往事…
我们感触颇深
When the action is over and we look back... we understand both more and less.

1909
02:50:21,080 --> 02:50:23,210
有一点是不容置疑的：
This much is certain.

1910
02:50:23,310 --> 02:50:27,340
在杜立特轰炸之前
美国人充满了失败的情绪
Before the Doolittle raid... America knew nothing but defeat.

1911
02:50:27,450 --> 02:50:30,890
可在此之后，大家都振奋起来
After it, nothing but victory.

1912
02:50:30,990 --> 02:50:34,950
日本也首次意识到失败的可能
并开始小心起来
Japan realized for the first time that they could lose and began to pull back.

1913
02:50:34,950 --> 02:50:39,520
我们看到了胜机而加紧步伐
他们终将获胜并开始步步进逼
America realized that she would win... and surged forward.

1914
02:50:39,630 --> 02:50:43,690
这场战争改变了我们和世界
It was a war that changed America and world.

1915
02:50:44,270 --> 02:50:48,230
多利・米勒是第一名
获得海军十字勋章的黑人
Dorie Miller was the first black American to be awarded the Navy Cross.

1916
02:50:48,610 --> 02:50:53,340
但获得勋章的不止他一人
他只是英雄群体中的一员
But he would not be the last. He joined a brotherhood of heroes.

1917
02:50:59,850 --> 02:51:01,840
所有参与轰炸的机员同样受勋
That's for all the raiders.

1918
02:51:11,930 --> 02:51:15,130
对我们来说，二战始于珍珠港
World War II for us began at Pearl Harbor...

1919
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:20,440
一千一百七十七名官兵
至今仍长眠在亚利桑那号战舰中
and 1,177 men still lie entombed in the battleship Arizona.

1920
02:51:21,940 --> 02:51:25,940
我们受到的挫折，使我们变得坚强
America suffered... but America grew stronger.

1921
02:51:26,410 --> 02:51:28,400
但这不是必然的结果
It was not inevitable.

1922
02:51:28,650 --> 02:51:34,640
危机考验了我们
通过考验我们克服了困难
The times tried our souls and through the trial, we overcame.

1923
02:51:55,470 --> 02:51:58,470
嗨！小丹尼，你想飞吗？
Hey, Danny... how'd you like to go flying?

1924
02:52:00,710 --> 02:52:02,140
来吧，小兄弟
Come here.
