00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:35,370

2
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,220
爸  他才不蠢
He ain't stupid, Daddy!

3
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,650
爸...
Daddy!

4
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,120
过来
Ohh! Come on!

5
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,320
马上回家去
Uhh! Get on back home. Now!

6
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,120
快点  你还有活要干呢!走吧
Get on up. You got work to do. Come on!

7
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,830
快点  给我回去
Come on, get on home!

8
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,970
你放开他
Uhh! You let him alone!

9
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,340
爸爸  别这样
Daddy, no!

10
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,070
我要打扁你  你这个臭德国佬!
I will bust you open, you dirty German!

11
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,910
你骂我什么?
What'd you call me?

12
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,990
我在法国和德国人打过仗
I fought the Germans in France.

13
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,380
非常艰巨的阵地相持战
And I fought them in the trenches.

14
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,190
上帝保佑!那些可怕的事情别再发生了
And I pray to God no one ever has to see the things that I saw.

15
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,110
你是我最好的朋友
You're my best friend.

16
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,440
爸  等等!
Daddy, wait!

17
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,180
爸  等等我
Daddy, wait.

18
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,640
阿道夫・希特勒把德国变成了战争机器
Adolf Hitler builds the German military machine

19
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,830
整个欧洲都陷入了战火
and drags all of Europe into war.

20
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,770
即使希特勒占领了法国  但美国仍拒绝加入战局
But even while France falls to Hitler, America still refuses to join the fighting.

21
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,010
(米歇空军基地)


22
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,180
(一九四一年一月  长岛)


23
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,090
麦考利和沃克在哪儿?
Where's McCawley and Walker?

24
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,390
还在进行飞行训练
Still training, sir.

25
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,660
丹尼!让我们教他们什么叫开飞机
All right, Danny. Now let's show them how to fly.

26
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,660
来"老鹰捉小鸡"  准备好了吗?
We're gonna play chicken. You ready?

27
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,200
这可不是农场的飞机  我不玩
This ain't the farm, and these ain't no cropdusters. I'm not playing chicken with you.

28
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,930
别当胆小鬼  让我告诉你
Now don't be a baby. I'll tell you what...

29
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,730
我不玩儿  雷夫
I'm not doing it, Rafe.

30
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,330
那我冲你来了  你可以躲开
Well, I'm coming right at you. You can turn,

31
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,930
也可以和我相撞  你看着办吧
or you can hit me. It's up to you.

32
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,050
搞什么?
What the...

33
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,270
完了
Oh, boy.

34
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,580
你为什么总是害我  雷夫?
Why you always busting my ass, Rafe?

35
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,250
你从哪边过?
Which way you going?

36
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,920
我想从右边  不  左边  我从左边
I guess I'll go right. No, uh, left. I'll go left.

37
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,520
我们从左边  是吗?
OK, we're going left, right?

38
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,120
嗯  是右边  右边吗?
Ri... uh, right. Right?

39
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,060
右边是指我们从右边过  还是指我们从左边过?
Right like we're going right, or right like we're going left?

40
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,400
你把我搅糊涂了!我不知道  你说吧
Well, now you got me all mixed up! I don't know. Make up your mind.

41
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,110
上帝啊  雷夫  我们从右边!右边!
God, Rafe, we're going right! Righty- tighty!

42
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,720
他们真是王牌飞行员
Those are some smooth aces.

43
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,750
你说什么?
Did you say something?

44
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,150
我告诉你们  这两个乡巴佬被禁飞了!
'Cause let me tell you, those farm boys are grounded!

45
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,290
是的  长官  决不允许拿军用飞机冒险
Yes, sir, an entirely unacceptable use... of m- m- military aircraft, sir.

46
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,160
- 拿我的帽子来  - 是的  长官
- Get my hat. - Yes, sir.

47
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,970
叫这些亡命徒去杜立特办公室
Get those hedge- hoppers in Doolittle's office.

48
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,730
已经训练两年了
After two years of training...

49
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,020
请你不要来送我
could you... not come see me off?

50
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,610
现在跟你道别已经够难过了
Because, uh... saying good- bye to you once is hard enough.

51
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,530
来
Here.

52
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,920
戴上这个
Take this.

53
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,190
我戴上它好看吗?
You think it looks good on me?

54
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,340
我很快就会回来的
I will come back.

55
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,840
你不是叫她别来吗?
I thought you said you told her not to come.

56
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,040
没错
Yeah, I did.

57
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,040
那你干嘛还在找她?
Why you looking for her then?

58
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,780
这是个考验
It's my test.

59
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,630
我叫她别来她还是来了
If I tell her not to come, and she comes anyway...

60
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,690
就说明她真的非常爱我
then I... I know she loves me.

61
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,280
请五十七站台的乘客上车
All aboard! Track 57!

62
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,710
如果我发生意外
If, uh, anything happens to me...

63
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,890
你一定告诉她  好吗?
I want you to be the one to tell her. All right?

64
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,640
为了我和她
You just make sure and come back for the both of us,

65
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,200
你要活着回来
all right?

66
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,080
- 等我回来  再见了  - 好的
- See you when I get back. - Yeah.

67
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,090
好好干  雷夫
Good hunting, Rafe.

68
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,150
伊芙琳
Evelyn!

69
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,920
伊芙琳
Evelyn!

70
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,690
伊芙琳!伊芙琳!嘿
Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn. Hey!

71
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,730
她爱我
She loves me.

72
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,880
德国空军开始轰炸伦敦市中心
The German Luftwaffe relent lessly bombards downtown London...

73
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:15,010
英国皇家空军为了捍卫领空
while Churchill's Royal Air Force is

74
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,920
陷入艰辛的苦战
in a deadly struggle to maintain control of the British skies.

75
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,640
简直是破铜烂铁
This is a real mess.

76
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,840
麦考利中尉报到  长官
Lieutenant McCawley reporting for duty, sir.

77
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,210
很好  我们先安排你住下
We'll get you settled into your quarters.

78
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,490
然后带你去看看你要飞的破烂飞机
And then introduce you to the crate you'll be flying.

79
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,650
长官  看你们都在这忙着
If you all are patching up bullet holes

80
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,460
我还是直接上飞机吧
here maybe we ought to skip housekeeping and get me in an airplane.

81
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,760
两架飞机没有返航  只剩十一架
Two didn't come back, sir. We counted only eleven.

82
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,340
象你这样的美国人都急着去送死吗? 飞行员
Are all Yanks as anxious as you to get themselves killed, Pilot Officer?

83
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,880
我不想送死  我只想打仗
Not anxious to die, sir. Just anxious to matter.

84
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,850
这是你的战斗机
This is yours.

85
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,630
他是好样的
Good chap.

86
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,100
直到着陆关闭引擎后才闭上眼睛
Didn't die till he'd landed and shut down his engine.

87
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,800
请坐  先生们
Please be seated, gentlemen.

88
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,480
我的心情很沉重
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.

89
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,780
刚才邱吉尔和斯大林问我  我也要问问你们
Churchill and Stalin are asking me what I'm asking you.

90
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,560
美国还要假装世界大战没有发生多久?
How long is America going to pretend the world is not at war?

91
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,460
我们提供了大量的食品和油料  总统先生  就我所知
We've increased food and oil shipments, Mr. President and as far as I know

92
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,530
他们需要坦克、战斗机、大炮、子弹还有士兵
What they really need are tanks, planes bullets, bombs, and men to fight.

93
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,670
可美国人还是认为希特勒和
But our people think Hitler and his

94
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,630
他的纳粹党仅仅只是欧洲的问题
Nazi thugs are Europe's problem.

95
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,240
我忘了拿扳手
Forgot my wrenches.

96
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,250
这真的很尴尬
That would definitely be embarrassing.

97
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,950
你好  我忘了拿扳手
Yeah. Ha. Forgot my wrenches.

98
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,350
他真的没有必要离开呀
He really doesn't have to leave.

99
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,220
是啊
No.

100
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,920
我要跟朋友出去  那么
I, uh, I'm just going out with the girls, so...

101
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:37,290
回头见吧
I guess I'll see you later.

102
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:41,140
好的  回头见
Yeah. All right. Yeah, all right. I'll see you around.

103
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,740
见鬼
Shit.

104
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,440
伊芙琳
Evelyn.

105
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,410
你见过珍珠港的日落吗?
Have you ever seen Pearl Harbor at sunset?

106
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,170
当然
Of course.

107
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,640
是从空中看的吗?
from the air?

108
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,180
你知道吗  为这我会被踢出军队的
You know, I could get kicked out of the military for this.

109
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,520
真的吗?
Really?

110
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,880
真的  趴下来
Yeah. Stay down.

111
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,510
夏威夷人叫这"瓦伊摩米"  意思是"珍珠海"
The Hawaiians called this harbor Wai Momi. It means "water of pearls."

112
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,350
真是美极了!
It's so beautiful.

113
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,120
我爸带我飞过几次
My dad took me up a couple of times.

114
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:34,210
千万别学他那样翻斤头  你们怎么称呼在空中翻斤头?
Just don't do what he did. What do you call it when you flip over?

115
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,820
空中翻滚?
A barrel roll?

116
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,320
- 对  - 我不会学他的
- Yeah. - I won't.

117
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,570
你觉得怎样?
What do you think?

118
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,070
很过瘾
I like that.

119
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:08,020
那架飞机应该在一小时之前就返航的
Hey! That plane was supposed to be back here an hour ago!

120
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,560
快  躲在伞库里
Quick, hide in the parachute hangar.

121
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,830
我的心跳得好快
My heart is pounding.

122
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:43,910
丹尼  昨天晚上  不  那样不行
Danny, last night... No, that's terrible.

123
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,750
丹尼  我们要好好谈谈
Danny, we need to talk about this.

124
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,060
- 长官  伊芙琳!  - 丹尼  嘿
- Sir.- Evelyn! - Danny. Hey.

125
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,960
我一夜都没合眼  一直想见你
I didn't sleep a wink last night. I had to see you.

126
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:07,630
我知道昨晚太疯狂了  但我不后悔  你呢?
Last night was crazy, I know, but... I'm not sorry. Are you?

127
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,210
我不知道
I don't know.

128
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,340
我过的很愉快  但
Danny, I had a wonderful time last night. I...

129
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,820
这一切都太快了
It's just all too fast.

130
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:21,400
伊芙琳  今天早上我坐在沙滩上
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down at the beach this morning

131
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,790
望着升起的太阳
and I watched the sun rise...

132
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,380
心里想  这一切将重新开始
and I knew that everything was gonna be different.

133
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:29,060
就从今天开始
That this was the start of something new.

134
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,540
就在此时此刻
In this place, in this moment.

135
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:35,340
我不在乎别人的议论
And I don't care what anybody else says, you know?

136
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,730
为什么我有这种感觉?
How can I not feel this way?

137
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,830
因为我喜欢你
I kinda like you.

138
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,540
是吗?
Oh, you do?

139
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:53,690
你的领带歪了
You have your tie on crooked.

140
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:58,950
一切都会好起来  好吗?
Everything's gonna be all right, OK?

141
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,930
一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be all right.

142
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:16,240
你坐飞机去过瓦胡岛吗?
Do you have any ain'tours going through the valley of Oahu?

143
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,540
懂我的意思吗?
You do?

144
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:23,910
- 止血钳  - 止血钳
- Hemostat. - Hemostat.

145
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:31,610
放心  看着我  你会没事的  会没事的
All right, look at me. You're going to be all right. You're going to be all right.

146
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:38,030
我们轰炸了他们的军舰和机场


147
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:40,950
现在要摧毁备用机场


148
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:45,960
我需要弹药!我需要弹药!我要更多的弹药
I need more ammo! I need more ammo, ladies! I need more ammo!

149
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:49,090
厄尔  那些飞机能飞吗?
Earl! We good to go?

150
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:50,000
差不多  但是
Mostly, but...

151
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:52,570
趴下来!天哪!找掩体!
Get down! Shit! Get cover!

152
01:46:56,710 --> 01:46:57,580
我的天
Jesus!

153
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,150
你们快过来!厄尔  快进来
Come on, you guys! Earl, get in here!

154
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,250
散弹枪不管用!
Sergeant! We need more than a shotgun!

155
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:07,350
还有武器和弹药吗?
You got any other weapons for coverfire?

156
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:09,190
在那边的弹药库里!
Inside that ammo locker!

157
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,990
快点!走!走!
Come on! Go! Move it!

158
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,000
把枪拿出来!
Get the guns out!

159
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,960
你说飞机差不多能够飞  有什么问题吗?
You said the planes are mostly ready, but... but what?

160
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:21,630
这架抛锚  那架坏了  那架根本飞不了 只剩下四架可以飞
She's down, she's broke, she's shit. I got four left.

161
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:24,400
一架好的  两架缺弹药  一架缺油
One's good, two need ammo, one needs fuel.

162
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:25,970
快躲进掩体里面去  把子弹装好!
Fall out and load up in the bunker!

163
01:47:26,910 --> 01:47:29,210
我们走!趴下来!快点!
Let's go! Get down! Move!

164
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:32,010
做好准备  开始干吧! 快趴下!
Get ready to roll this thing! Get down! Now!

165
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:37,280
安东尼  雷德  你们负责 50 高射炮
Anthony, Red, you stay here and man the fifty- caliber.

166
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:41,780
古斯  你去附近的掩体  掩护我们  好吗?
Gooz, get to the next bunker and lay down some coverfire. All right?

167
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:43,090
敌机来了
Planes.

168
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:46,790
我们要开枪吗?
Should we fire?

169
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:52,030
趴下来  妈的  别开火  冷静点  千万别开火
Stay down! God damn it! Hold your fire! Stay still! Nobody fire!

170
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:53,530
噢  天啊  噢  天啊
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

171
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,970
他们不知道我们在这儿
They don't know we're here.

172
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,340
- 别动  - 开火吗?
- Stay down. - Fire?

173
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:04,970
不  妈的  趴下  他们没发现我们  趴着别开枪
No, God damn it, stay down, stay still. Don't fire.

174
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,020
老天
Oh, God.

175
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,400
敌机没有炸弹了  我想他们要返航了
I don't see any ordnance. I think they're going home.

176
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:24,300
不
No.

177
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:26,330
他们还会回来的  地面上仍然有我们的飞机
They'll be back. We still got planes on the ground.

178
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:28,260
飞行员们听好
Pilots, listen up.

179
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:32,310
在跑道上一定要开足马力  别到头了才拉操纵杆
Get all the speed you can on the runway... don't get on the stick till the very end.

180
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:34,800
起飞后要低飞  在建筑物之间活动
In the air, stay low between the buildings.

181
01:48:34,910 --> 01:48:37,800
如果被零式咬住尾巴  左右摇摆甩掉他
You see any Zero on your tail... wipe him off,

182
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:40,370
别傻愣着  好吗?要保持移动
don't freeze. all right? Just keep moving.

183
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,310
我们要设法分散他们
Try to separate them,

184
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,750
然后一架一架地消灭
take them out one by one.

185
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:48,020
P- 40 飞机没有零式飞机快  所以别和它比速度
P- 40s can't out run Zeros, so don't try.

186
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:49,450
只有靠技术超过它们
We have to outfly them.

187
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:52,690
高空轰炸机!他们非把机库炸平不可!
We got high- level bombers! They'll bust this hangar wide open!

188
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,520
拿上机枪走  走吧
Grab the fifties! Let's move!

189
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,450
珍 珠 港


190
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,680
(田纳西州  一九二三年)


191
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,010
德国佬  两点钟方向
German bandits at two o'clock!

192
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,510
全速前进
Increase throttle! Power dive!

193
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,050
你拼错了啦  雷夫
Spell it right, Rafe.

194
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,380
方向舵  应该是两个 D
"Rudder" is spelled with two Ds.

195
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,550
- 谢了  伙伴 - 哦  不客气
- Thanks, wingman. - Yeah, sure.

196
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,160
敌机来袭
Whoa, bandits!

197
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,850
打得好  丹尼
Crack shooting, Danny.

198
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,030
你也一样
Crack shooting, Rafe.

199
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,090
为了自由
Land of the free.

200
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,030
为了祖国
Home of the brave.

201
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,750
飞得帅呆了  老爸
Great flying, Dad

202
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,020
来吧  我教你开飞机
Come on. I'm gonna teach you how to fly.

203
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,730
我要坐前面
I get the front!

204
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,100
不  你得坐后面
No, you take the back.

205
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,100
我比较高  我应该坐前面
I'm bigger, and I should be in front.

206
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,230
我比你大  我还要教你呢
I'm older, and I'm teaching, so no.

207
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,240
哇  我们真像在飞一样啦!
Wow. It's like we're really flying.

208
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,110
我玩过好几次了
Yeah, I did it lots of times.

209
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,200
你去守住机关枪  我来减速
Come on, you man the guns. I'll give her some throttle.

210
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,840
我们要打落德国飞机
We gotta get those dirty German bandits.

211
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,820
噢  天啊
Oh, gosh!

212
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,430
快停下来  雷夫!
Hang on! Make it stop, Rafe!

213
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,660
我看我爸开过很多次  没事儿!
I've seen my dad do this lots of times, don't worry!

214
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,760
雷夫!
Rafe!

215
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,540
喔  我们飞起来了啦!
Oh, my gosh! We're flying!

216
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,600
我们飞起来了
We're flying!

217
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,100
我老爸饶不了我!快走
My dad's gonna kill me. Come on.

218
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,620
好耶
Yes! Whoo- hoo!

219
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,500
我们飞起来了!我们飞起来了!
We flew! We flew!

220
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,770
- 好耶  我是飞行员  - 我知道了
- Yeah! Yes! I'm a pilot! - I know!

221
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,870
我们飞起来了
We flew.

222
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,770
- 你这个没用的东西  - 爸爸
- You no- account boy! - Daddy...

223
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,350
我说过  别和这个笨蛋泡在一起
I done told you, you spend time playing with this stupid boy...

224
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,650
他不识字!你会一辈子没出息的
...can't read. you ain't never going to amount to nothing!

225
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,530
你们以为造价四万五千美元的战斗机
you believe that a $45,000 airplane...

226
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,540
是用来玩吗?
is there for your amusement?

227
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,130
不是  长官  我只是磨练技巧
No, sir. I was just trying... to keep my edge, Major.

228
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,430
上礼拜你玩空中翻筋斗
And when you did the outside loop last week...

229
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,610
也是为了磨练技巧吗?
what did you think that was? Honing your skills?

230
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,180
那不是飞行技巧!麦考利  是哗众取宠!
That's not training, McCawley. That's a stunt.

231
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,560
也是愚蠢和不负责的行为
And I personally consider it to be reckless... and irresponsible.

232
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,550
少校
Major...

233
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,940
怎么会啊
How could that be,

234
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,980
你可是那招
when you're famous for being the first man

235
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,020
的开山鼻祖
in the world ever to do it?

236
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,260
别跟我耍嘴皮子
Don't get cute with me, son.

237
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,330
我没有耍嘴皮子  长官
No, sir, I don't mean to be disrespectful.

238
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,500
请恕我直言  我只是认为
I just think that... well, I...

239
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,100
如果仅仅只是为了出风头  这是愚蠢和不负责的
It is reckless and irresponsible if you're just doing it to be a show- off.

240
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,270
但我这样是为了启发战友
But I was doing it to try to inspire the men, sir...

241
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,170
就像您当初启发我一样
in the way that you've inspired me.

242
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,310
有句成语能够用来形容我对您的钦佩
I believe the French even have a word for that...

243
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,290
法国人称之为
when the men get together to honor their leaders.

244
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,610
五体投地
They call it an homage, sir.

245
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,280
什么?
A what?

246
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,250
- 是五体投地  长官  - 这全是屁话  麦考利
- An homage, sir. - That's bullshit, McCawley!

247
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,650
但它是很中听的屁话
But it's very, very good bullshit.

248
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,820
谢谢你  长官
Thank you, sir.

249
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,300
麦考利  你就像十五年前的我
McCawley, you remind me of myself fifteen years ago.

250
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,370
我们现在讨论一下这个
Which is why we need to discuss this.

251
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,700
坐下  年轻人
Have a seat, son.

252
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,970
英国人已经接受你加入雄鹰中队
The British have accepted you into the Eagle Squadron.

253
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,880
如果你愿意
You're on your way to England tomorrow...

254
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,280
明天就可以动身
if you still want to go.

255
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,750
飞行员是英国能否打退希特勒的关键
Just a few British pilots are all that stand

256
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,790
也决定着欧洲战场的走向
between Hitler and total victory in Europe.

257
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,490
他们非常需要援助
They're gonna need all the help they can get.

258
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,190
我马上出发  长官
Yes, sir. Well, I'm on my way.

259
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,330
按照规定  我应该要求你再慎重考虑一下
Just for the record... I'm supposed to ask you to reconsider.

260
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,300
长官?
Sir?

261
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,970
不管我们是否愿意
Sooner or later we're gonna be in this war...

262
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,470
...美国参战只是时间问题
whether we like it or not.

263
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,010
我们也需要优秀的飞行员
And I'm gonna need all of my best pilots.

264
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,210
所以我应该征询你是否愿意留下来
So it's my duty to ask you to stay.

265
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,440
少校  你会怎么做?
Major, what would you do?

266
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,520
如果是我
If it was me...

267
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,560
我会去
I'd go.

268
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,280
不会吧  我开始谢顶了?
Get out. Am I going bald right back here?

269
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,200
伙计  我是个帅小伙
Man, I am one good- looking son of a bitch.

270
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,390
可千万别死
Don't you ever die.

271
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,300
打仗你死不了  今晚你就要装一副快死的样子
Die. That's exactly the concept you gotta work tonight.

272
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,530
往眼睛上抹点儿丁香油
You put a drop of this clove oil under your eyes...

273
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,600
快忍不住的时候就去找护士
and you let them sting and well up.

274
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,270
做个深呼吸
You get your nurse alone, take a breath...

275
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,780
然后就热泪盈眶地对她说  宝贝
let her see your eyes listen and say,

276
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,480
他们训练我去打仗
"Baby, they're training me for war...

277
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,780
我生死难测
and I don't know what'll happen...

278
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,260
如果明天我一去不返
but if I die tomorrow...

279
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,360
我盼望今晚我俩能共度春宵
" I want to know that we lived all we could tonight."

280
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,300
来吧  伙计们  漂亮护士在等着咱们
Come on, guys! We got nurses waiting.

281
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,960
快点  再不走比利的头就要秃光了
Come on, before the rest of his hair falls out.

282
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,830
你为什么要做这样的决定?
How could you do this?

283
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,560
是杜立特点名派我去的
Well, Doolittle assigned me.

284
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,640
他希望我能够接受实战训练
He wanted me to get some real... real combat training in.

285
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,470
你想什么呢?
Well, guess what?

286
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,910
那儿可没有训练  只有战争
It's not training over there. It's war.

287
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,250
输家丢掉性命  赢家也一无所获
Where the losers die, and there aren't any winners...

288
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,750
大家都身心疲惫  就像我老爸那样
just guys who turn into broken- down wrecks... like my father.

289
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,890
我知道  我能理解  丹尼
Yeah, I understand that, Danny.

290
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,580
但是我觉得我有责仁去
But I feel like I got a duty to go.

291
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,660
见鬼  别和我扯什么责任
Don't preach to me about duty, damn it.

292
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,580
我和你一样都是军人
I wear the same uniform you do.

293
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,390
如果真有必要  我也会去
Now, if trouble wants me, I'm ready for it.

294
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,530
可你为什么要这样求之不得?
But why go looking for it?

295
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,260
听我说  丹尼  我快二十五岁了
God, Danny, come on. I'm gonna be twenty- five.

296
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,760
已经算是个老兵
I might as well be an old man.

297
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,600
我很快就只能当飞行教官了
They're gonna have me being a flight instructor.

298
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,090
我不想当教官
I don't wanna teach loops and barrel rolls.

299
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,940
我要开战斗机
I wanna be a combat fighter.

300
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,340
快点  护士们在等你们跳舞呢
Hey, come on! The nurses can't d- d- dance by themselves.

301
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,240
我们走吧
Let's go.

302
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,220
要是每天都和一百五十个穿内裤的小伙子们打交道
If the call of duty means seeing 150 men in their underwear every day...

303
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,590
我们可不嫌枯燥
...we are here to serve.

304
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,130
想不到能在纽约度周末
I can't believe it. Saturday night in New York City.

305
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,200
在家乡太没意思了!
Do you know what they're doing where I come from?

306
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,330
什么都不能做  只能逗牛玩
Nothing. Cow- tipping.

307
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,780
所以你来当海军
Well, that's why you joined the Navy, hong.

308
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,700
想开开眼界?
To get out of that dusty little town and see the world.

309
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,500
巴巴拉  我们是海军护士  可不是来旅游的
May I remind you, Barbara, we're Navy nurses, not tourists.

310
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,070
我当海军是来尽义务  还想找个男朋友
I joined to do my patriotic duty and to meet guys.

311
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,870
我也是
Me, too.

312
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,880
我们今晚玩个痛快!
Girls, we're gonna have so much fun tonight in the city.

313
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,780
给大家讲讲你的故事吧  伊芙琳
You've gotta tell them the story, Evelyn.

314
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,910
什么?
What?

315
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,620
说呀  告诉我们
Oh, come on. Tell us.

316
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,280
噢  说来话长
Oh, it's such a long story.

317
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,290
我们时间多的是
We got time.

318
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,990
我亲眼目睹哦
I saw it happen.

319
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,160
那是四个星期前
Well, it was about four weeks ago...

320
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,500
你认为怎样更好点?
What do you think is b- b- better?

321
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,160
都打在一边  还是分开打?
All in the one cheek, or spreading them out?

322
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,400
好吧
OK.

323
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,570
福斯科・安东尼
Fusco Anthony.

324
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,150
你没事吧?老兄
You all right, buddy?

325
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,240
甜心  真的要打针吗?
Sweetie, do you really have to do this?

326
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,680
我在军营可不会染上黄热病
I'm not gonna get yellow fever in my barracks.

327
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,850
不会吗?如果你愿意  可以让她打
No? If you'd rather, she can do it.

328
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,930
喔  喔  稍微等一下
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just give me a minute.

329
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,420
亲爱的  上头说要给你们打  我们就得打
Honey, the government says stick them, we stick them.

330
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,800
雷德  你没事吧?
Uh! Hey, Red, you allright?

331
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,180
四号  测验视力
Eye exam number four?

332
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,840
医生  我都检查过十几次啦!
Listen, Doc, I have passed a dozen medical checks.

333
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,850
你要这样写  我就飞不成了
You write that, they won't let me fly.

334
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,850
很抱歉  年轻人
Sorry, son. I'm gonna fail.

335
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,050
(不合格)


336
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,460
糟糕  他们会折断我的翅膀
They're gonna take my wings away.

337
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,720
不会的  放轻松
No, they won't. Just relax.

338
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,420
读最后一行
Read the bottom line, please.

339
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,350
再背一遍最后一行  放心
Just keep practicing the bottom line. And don't worry.

340
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,260
我在后面
I'm right behind you.

341
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,800
谢谢
Thank

342
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,970
下一个
Next.

343
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,630
小姐
Ma'am.

344
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,770
J、L、M、K、P、O、E、T、X
JLMKPOETX

345
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,710
简直像老鹰的眼睛一样
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.

346
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,750
慢点儿  飞行员  别看下边的
Slow down, flyboy. And, instead of the bottom,

347
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,640
读最上面一行   用双眼看
read the very top. Both eyes.

348
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,050
"C"  抱歉  "J"
Yeah. "C"...sorry, "J."

349
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,850
"C"、"W"
Ahem. "C"..."W." "W."

350
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,130
"Q"  "Q"  "Q"


351
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,500
请再读一遍最后一行
Read the bottom line again, please.

352
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,230
这次从右向左  而且间隔着读
But read it right to left and every other letter.

353
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,150
"E"、"X"
"E."Heh. "X."

354
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,180
"X""E"


355
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,720
"X""E"


356
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,520
护士小姐  我看得很清楚
X- E, ma'am. Ma'am, I know how this looks.

357
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,460
抱歉  中尉  真的很抱歉
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I really am.

358
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,690
陆军和海军的都要求视力达到二点零
But Army and Navy requires 20/20 vision.

359
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,460
我的眼睛没有问题  我看得见
Oh, I... it's... it's not a problem with my eyes, I can see.

360
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,500
我的意思是  我的眼睛棒极了
I mean, I can see.

361
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,430
我可以一枪打死狂奔的野兔
I mean, I can hit a running rabbit with a $3.00 pistol.

362
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,100
我只是阅读字母有点困难  仅此而已
I got a problem with letters, that's all.

363
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,820
那只有先去上学
Well, maybe after some schooling...

364
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,430
再回来复查
you could come back and take the test again.

365
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,320
不  我上过学
No, I had schooling. I mean,

366
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
老师也拿我没办法
I... the teachers just never knew what to make of it.

367
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,170
只是字母而已  有的时候我常把
It's just letters.

368
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,320
它们的顺序弄颠倒  就是这样
I mix them up sometimes. That's all.

369
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,520
我的意思是  我只是把它们倒过来读
I mean, I just get them backward sometimes.

370
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,690
你看  我的数学、航空理论
L- look here. Uh, my... my math and...

371
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,620
还有口试  成绩都是优
and spacial reasoning and my verbal scores are all excellent.

372
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,620
但是你的写作成绩才刚及格
But you barely passed the written exam.

373
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,970
毕竟他及格了  总该我了吗?
Yeah, but he did pass it. So, is it my turn now?

374
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,190
还没有  你再等一下
No, you'll wait your turn.

375
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,120
好的  护士小姐
Yes, ma'am.

376
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,330
护士小姐  我不是来这儿教语言的
Ma'am, I- I'm never gonna be an English teacher.

377
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,490
我来这儿是为了当飞行员
But I know why I'm here. To be a pilot.

378
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,920
鬼才拿着课本上天打仗
And you don't dogfight with manuals. You don't fly with gauges.

379
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,650
我是说  开飞机关键得看感觉敏锐
I mean, it's all about feeling and speed...

380
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,700
反应迅速  还有是否能够与飞机融为一体
and letting that plane become like a part... of your body.

381
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,010
没人说阅读能力差  就当不了好飞行员
And that manual... says that a guy who's a slow reader can't be a good pilot.

382
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,950
档案上都说我是这儿的最棒的飞行员
That file says I'm the best pilot in this room.

383
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,320
护士小姐  求求你  别让我停飞
Ma'am, please, don't take my wings.

384
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,520
嗯  我感到很为难
Well, I felt so bad.

385
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,290
伊芙琳  到三号台去
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

386
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,490
我别无选择
I had no choice.

387
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,430
放他过关了
I passed him.

388
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,150
一会儿  这个飞行员又来了
So, then this cocky pilot comes back.

389
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,570
哎  小伙子  你是新兵?
Say, fella, are you enlisted?

390
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,640
是的
Yeah.

391
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,730
"是的"? 年轻人  你在和军官说话吗?
"Yeah"? Boy, you're talking to an officer.

392
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,780
是  长官  对不起  长官
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

393
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,810
- 把档案给我  - 是  长官
- Give me that file. - Yes, sir.

394
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,470
- 稍息 - 是  长官
- Parade rest. - Yes, sir.

395
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,340
护士小姐  我还没来得及谢谢你
Ma'am, I didn't get a chance to thank you.

396
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,210
裤子脱下来
Drop your skivvies.

397
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,150
啊  哦  好吧
Ah, oh, OK.

398
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,110
像这样?
Just like this?

399
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,920
很好
That's fine.

400
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,890
他的屁股很翘
He did have a very cute butt.

401
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,100
我知道您本不该让我过关的  但却您帮了我
You know, I know you didn't have to pass me and you did.

402
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,660
我以为你不明白我的意思  但是你却很清楚
And I just... I didn't think you'd understand, and you did.

403
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,960
知道吗  你还没感谢我呢
You know, you still haven't said thank you.

404
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,600
谢谢你
Thank you.

405
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,000
不客气
You're welcome.

406
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,400
我想知道您为什么帮我?  我只是很好奇
Why'd you do it? I mean, I'm just curious.

407
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,910
您现在是我的偶像了
You're like my hero now.

408
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,070
事实上  我父亲曾经是飞行员  我知道
Actually, my father was a pilot. And, um, I've seen first- hand what happens...

409
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,740
飞行员停飞的滋味
when a pilot loses his wings.

410
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,480
知道吗  您父亲也是我的偶像了
You know what? Your father's my hero, then, too.

411
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,050
作为一名军官  我想今晚请你
In fact, as an officer, I think it'd by my duty...

412
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,050
我的新偶像的女儿吃饭  是我应该做的
...to take my new hero's daughter out tonight just to...

413
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,090
- 啊!  - 有点儿深了吧?
- aah! - Gosh, did I poke too deep?

414
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,830
您好象扎进骨头了
I think you hit the bone there.

415
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,630
你太过分了
You are so mean.

416
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,390
难道您真不愿意
What? So is... is there any chance...

417
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,240
给我个机会?
that you might, kind of, sort of... you know, like me, or...

418
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,010
你想什么呢?
Oh, how did you guess?

419
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,850
我的头儿没教我体验这种感觉
They never taught us... how to deal with this... feeling.

420
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,110
什么感觉?
Wh- what feeling?

421
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,320
像是  这样
Well, it's kind of like... this.

422
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,960
他再放肆  我还要扎他
Well, he was getting fresh, so I poked him again.

423
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,830
嗨  罗密欧  我可不想找罪受
All right, Romeo. I want to get this over with.

424
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,070
等一下
Hold on a second.

425
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,510
我真的很想"舔"你
Miss... I really, really lick you.

426
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,040
他说什么?
What did he mean?

427
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,140
喜欢你  我舌头打结了
Like you. I didn't mean to say that. And I just, um...

428
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,090
我很想请你一起"送"饭
I just want to ask you, please, if I can donate dinner.

429
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,120
他开始语无伦次了
He started to act very strange.

430
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,050
我郑重地邀请你
Or, well, buy you dinner.

431
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,660
这不是你的档案
This isn't your chart.

432
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,400
不  这是那个家伙的  我想他落下了
Whoa. No. That's the, uh, this, uh, fellow over here's. I think he left.

433
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,940
你打过针了?
Have you already had this shot?

434
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,770
是的  嗯  已经打过一次了
Yeah, well, once... already.

435
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,770
嗯  我想  我的意思是  我可以约你出去吗?
Well, I wanted... I mean, can I ask you out?

436
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,710
不行
No!

437
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,110
突然  他一头栽到地上
And he just went wham!

438
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,190
噢!你对他怎么了?
Oh! What'd you do to him?

439
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,280
可怜的家伙
Poor guy.

440
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,720
噢  老天  你没事吧?
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

441
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,570
嗯  没事  我没事  很好
Yeah, I'm fine, I feel great.

442
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,640
这样能起保护作用
This is just standard precautionary... thing.

443
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,370
看  我搞到些好东西  一瓶正宗的法国香槟
Look, I got some, uh, genuine French champagne... from France.

444
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,310
我想  也许我们该好好庆祝一下
I thought, you know, maybe we could celebrate.

445
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,710
庆祝什么?
Celebrate what?

446
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,710
噢  我也不知道  怎么说呢  庆祝你成了我的偶像
Oh, I don't know. Uh, well, you being my hero, for one.

447
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,750
好吧  为什么不呢?
OK. Why not?

448
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,470
我很感激你  感谢你
So, uh, ahem... I wanted to thank you. And I just wanted to, uh...

449
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,320
你让我通过了体检
put your mind at ease about passing me...

450
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,570
因为我真的想为国家尽一份力
because I really do think you did this country a service.

451
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,610
我的意思是  我是一名王牌飞行员
I mean, I'm... I am a great flier.

452
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,120
要说你缺点的话  那就是骄傲
And if you have a fault, which you obviously don't, it's modesty

453
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,680
不  如果说我有缺点  那就是直率
No. If I have a fault, it's candor.

454
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,140
你真的很
You are just so...

455
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,290
瓶塞崩着我了
Cork just got away from me.

456
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,620
天啊
God

457
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,990
天啊  噢  真疼
God, oh, it hurts.

458
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,330
疼死啦
It hurts something fierce.

459
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,700
对不起
I'm sorry.

460
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,970
噢  噢  流血了
Ohh... Oh, it's bleeding.

461
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,410
天啊
God.

462
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,070
- 躺下  - 我总是惹事生非
- Lay still. - I ruined everything.

463
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,910
- 别乱动  - 好痛
- Lay still. - Oh, it hurts.

464
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,750
- 噢!太凉啦!  - 冰块能止血
- Ow! It's cold. - It'll stop the bleeding.

465
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,840
我无法喘气
Yeah. I can't breathe.

466
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,620
躺好
Lay still.

467
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,950
你美得真叫人心疼
You are so beautiful it hurts.

468
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,120
是你的鼻子疼
It's your nose that hurts.

469
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,860
不  是我的心疼
No. I think it's my heart.

470
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,770
于是我吻了他
And then I kissed him.

471
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,410
伊芙琳  这是我听过最浪漫的故事
Oh, Evelyn. That's the most romantic story I ever heard.

472
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,380
这也是我这辈子最浪漫的四个星期又两天
It's been the most romantic four weeks and two days of my life.

473
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,820
我好羡慕你
Oh, I'm so jealous.

474
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,710
见到你真好  护士小姐
Hello, Lieutenant. It's good to see you.

475
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,940
我也是  中尉
You, too, Lieutenant.

476
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,180
挑一只手
Pick a hand.

477
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

478
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,160
那只手有什么?
What's in your other hand?

479
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,700
是我的
Mine.

480
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,330
我花了六小时才折好
Well, it took me six hours to fold these.

481
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,730
介绍一下我的朋友  雷夫
I want you to meet my friends.

482
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,140
这是玛莎、巴巴拉、桑得拉
Rafe, this is Martha, Barbara, Sandra...

483
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,970
嗨  我是贝蒂
Hi. I'm Betty. Hi.

484
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,140
你的朋友呢?
Would you happen to have any friends?

485
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,080
随便选吧
Huh. Take your pick.

486
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,300
如果仗打起来  而我光荣负伤
We ever get in this war and something happens to me...

487
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,150
有你这样温柔的姑娘照顾我
I can't tell you how good it makes me feel to know...

488
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,120
让我恢复健康  那种感觉真的是太棒了
...that someone as sweet as you will be there to nurse me back to health.

489
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,620
可我们还没参战呢
Good, but we're not in the war yet.

490
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,190
嗨  那都是玩笑
OK. That was a bad line.

491
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,660
我  我是雷德  雷德
I'm... I'm Red, Red...

492
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,530
奇怪
S- s- s- s- strange.

493
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,700
你姓奇怪吗?
Your last name's Strange?

494
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,040
她是你的了
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.

495
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,700
不  我姓温
No. It... it's Winkle.

496
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,170
雷德真有女人缘
Red is such a ladiesg man.

497
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,580
你总是结巴?
Do you always stutter?

498
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,380
不  只是在
No. Only when I'm...

499
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,450
她上勾了
She's totally buying it.

500
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,380
- 紧张的时候?  - 是啊
- Nervous?  - Yeah.

501
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,350
为什么我碰不上漂亮妞?
Why can't I get something like that? Hello. Hi.

502
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,270
丹尼和姑娘在一起太腼腆
Danny seems kind of shy around the girls.

503
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,400
他不是腼腆
Tsk. It's not that he's shy.

504
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,100
他只是  缺乏自信
He's just, ahem... a little unsure of himself, you know.

505
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,610
是他老爸呵斥的结果
His old man used to run him down a lot.

506
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,650
一上飞机  他就判若两人
Get him in a plane, he's sure of himself.

507
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,650
他是我的好兄弟  好朋友
He's like my brother. He's like my best friend.

508
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,590
如同我的右手
He's my right hand.

509
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,990
可现在你的手滑到我的腰部以下了
Which at the moment is a long way south of my waist.

510
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,660
对不起  我滑的太低了
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I lost a little altitude.

511
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,830
是啊  我想你是的
Yeah, I guess you did.

512
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,690
失陪一下
Excuse me.

513
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,380
我们得好好聊聊
You and me, we got to talk.

514
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,150
听说海军要派我们去珍珠港
So, the rumor is the Navy's shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

515
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,420
那挺好啊
Well, won't be so bad.

516
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,360
那儿离战场很远
It's about as far from the fighting as you can get.

517
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,230
可以享受一下温暖的阳光
You'll get a suntan.

518
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,360
也许你也会被调到那儿
So maybe the Army'll post you guys there, too.

519
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,330
你是一个特别了不起的女人
You... are a super special woman.

520
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:46,310
他们把我训练成彪悍的勇士
they're... they're training me... to be a big bad warrior, and, well...

521
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,880
明天可能就去出生入死
So, I mean, you never know what might happen tomorrow

522
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,350
谁知道会发生什么  你了解吗?  所以
... or... or any day after that, you know? So...

523
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,860
今晚我们应该有点特别的
God, we need to make tonight super special.

524
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,160
你哭什么?
Why are you crying?

525
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,370
我怕再也见不到你了
I guess it's the thought... that I might not ever get to see you again.

526
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,340
别哭啦  宝贝儿  今晚我是你的
Dry your eyes, toots. Tonight, you're mine.

527
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,200
今晚我不想到人多的地方去  我希望和你单独在一起
I don't want to be with a crowd tonight. I just want to be alone with you.

528
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,110
去看看月光下的纽约港?
How does New York Harbor by moonlight sound?

529
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,380
你想当坏蛋?
Are you gonna be a bad influence?

530
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,420
干吗不当个坏蛋呢?
Of course I'm a bad influence.

531
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,520
我们是军官
Let's see if we can commandeer this vessel...

532
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
可以征募这艘船
'cause we're, uh, officers of the U.S. Government.

533
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,530
别高兴的太早
Not for long, we won't be.

534
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,840
也许将来我们能坐这艘船旅行
One day, we'll take a trip on a boat like that.

535
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,340
你喜欢这艘船?
Would you like that?

536
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,540
在大厅里参加鸡尾酒会
We'll be dressing for cocktails and walk into the grand salon.

537
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,350
没有人谈论战争  大家都随着舞曲翩翩翩翩起舞
No one's talking about war. They're just dancing to Cole Porter.

538
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,550
我要穿晚礼服
I'll have to get a tux.

539
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,310
是啊
Yeah.

540
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,450
上来  开船了
Come on. There you go. All aboard.

541
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,660
我不是这个意思
You're out of your mind.

542
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,930
是啊  小心  坐好
Oh, yeah. Careful now. Here, sit down.

543
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,870
看我的
Now let's see here.

544
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,200
快到了
Ah! There we go.

545
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,650
我要让你登上你喜欢的船
See, this is as close as I could get you to your ship.

546
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,110
怎么样?
So, at least I tried, right?

547
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,710
我已经很满足了  这太好了
Actually, you know what? This is better.

548
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,090
老天  你真美啊
Yeah, it is. God, you're pretty.

549
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,700
(上  下)


550
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,540
往后我们会怎么样?雷夫
What's gonna become of us all, Rafe?

551
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,050
嗯  我们左右不了未来  对吗?
Well, the future's not exactly in our hands, is it?

552
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,120
是的  你是对的
No. I guess you're right.

553
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,830
天啊  你没事儿吧?
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

554
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,960
没事儿  你呢?
Yeah, are you?

555
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,730
计划中可没有这出
That was not part of the date.

556
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,410
- 小心地面  - 喔  谢谢
- Watch your step. - Oh, thank you.

557
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,980
伊芙琳
Evelyn!

558
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,110
伙计们  快上来吧
Guys, come up! Come on up!

559
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,720
我们在321号房
Come up! We're in 321.

560
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,990
我要跟你说一件事
There's something I got to tell you.

561
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,720
你对我没有秘密可言
Well, you got no secrets from me, Lieutenant.

562
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,820
我看过你的体格检查表  知道你的一切
I've seen your medical chart.

563
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,400
是坏消息?还是有难言之处?
This can't be good, or it wouldn't be so hard to say.

564
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,200
是啊
Yep.

565
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,500
我要被调走
I got to go away.

566
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,000
我们都要被调走
We're all going away. Yeah...

567
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,870
没错
Yep.

568
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,580
但是我是去打仗  明天就动身
but I'm going to the war... tomorrow.

569
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,130
我要加入飞鹰中队
I'm flying with the Eagle Squadron.

570
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,220
他们需要美国飞行员
It's an outfit the British started for American pilots.

571
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,860
我不明白
I don't understand.

572
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,130
你是为美国军队服役  他们怎么能命令你去英国?
You're in the U.S. Army. How could they order you to go?

573
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,700
他们没有下命令  是我自愿的
They didn't order me. I volunteered.

574
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,380
我让你通过体检  是我放你过关的
But I passed you. I let you through.

575
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,610
现在你却自愿去最危险的地方?
And now you volunteer... for the most dangerous place you could go?

576
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,980
这和你没关系  你没有责任
It's not your responsibility, not your choice.

577
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,300
飞行曾经是我唯一的梦想
Flying's the only thing I ever wanted to do.

578
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,690
对我来说  我之所以活着  是为了
I mean, everything in my life has led me up to this point.

579
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,300
能够与你相遇
Meeting you.

580
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,140
我爱你
I love you.

581
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,610
我深深地爱着你
I love you so much.

582
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,770
我们进去吧
Let's go inside.

583
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,250
好的  等等  我不能这样做
All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

584
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,920
对不起  我只是
Just... I...

585
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,200
我不能这样做  我的意思是  我是非常渴望
See,I can't do this. I mean, I mean, I can. I... I want to.

586
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,680
你知道我并不是假装高尚
I'm not trying to be noble, you know.

587
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,470
或者谎称我不知道要发生什么
Or not saying I know what would happen or just...

588
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,200
我最好还是别说了
... I need to stop talking.

589
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,970
我只是  我只是不想
I just... I just don't want...

590
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,640
我只是不想跟别人一样
I just don't want it to be like everybody else.

591
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,960
今晚我不想
I don't want you to have anything about tonight...

592
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,910
给你留下任何遗憾
that you regret.

593
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,060
今晚对我一生至关重要
I mean, it's been the most

594
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,150
我不想破坏它
incredible night of my life... and I don't want to ruin that.

595
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
你当然不会破坏它
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.

596
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,630
如果我只能再活一晚  我也要与你共度
If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with you.

597
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,590
这也是我的期盼
See, that's what I want to come home to.

598
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,840
这就是我一生的梦想
That's what I want to have to think about and dream about.

599
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:17,330
我要回来与你共度美好的生活
I want to know that the best part of my life... is still ahead of me.

600
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,550
不要
Look. Don't, um...

601
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,670
我们必须更积极些
We have to do more.

602
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,280
援助英国和苏联
Send the Brits and Russians more of our ships

603
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,380
更多的军舰和防空武器
and anti- aircraft weapons.

604
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,420
继续从太平洋舰队调拨?
And keep cannibalizing the Pacific Fleet?

605
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,990
还有更好的选择吗?
What choice do we have?

606
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,890
我们在制造冰箱  敌人却一直在制造炸弹
We're building refrigerators while our enemies build bombs.

607
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,190
战争已经不可避免了


608
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:48,230
掩盖事实只是失败


609
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:55,180
美军停止供应石油  切断了我们的生命线


610
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,340
我们只能维持十八个月


611
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,680
没有别的选择  只有战争


612
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:09,490
只有发动大规模的袭击


613
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,490
我们有这样的能力吗？


614
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:32,280
必须一仗消灭太平洋舰队


615
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,380
就在珍珠港


616
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,120
太令人激动了
This is so exciting.

617
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,720
珍珠港有大约一百多艘军舰
You know there's about one hundred ships on Pearl.

618
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,270
每一艘有多少水手?
How many sailors per ship?

619
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,800
那要看情况而定  军舰上的水手比潜艇上的多
It depends. More on a battle ship than a sub.

620
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,270
平均下来  有两千个?
But say, on average... 2,000?

621
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,540
加上飞行员、陆战队员  还有基地后勤
Then there's the flyers, the marines, base personnel.

622
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,370
我还在算水兵人数
I'm still working on the sailors.

623
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,410
反正我们的机率很高
Girls, I think the odds are in your favor.

624
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,480
是啊  一比四千
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.

625
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,910
这儿是天堂
It's paradise.

626
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,850
海滩上见了  帅哥们
See you on the beach, boys!

627
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,450
我们在夏威夷耶
We're in Hawaii!

628
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,830
嘿!你别在我的飞机上画奶子
Hey! You're not supposed to paint titties on the side of my airplanes.

629
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,600
要画也不能一大一小
And if you do, don't make them lopsided.

630
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,300
真玩意儿就是这样  厄尔
They were lopsided, Earl.

631
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:31,970
瞧  书上说  不能在礁石和暗桩处冲浪
Look, it says right here."Never ride waves amongst rocks or submerged pilings."

632
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,410
看  不能那样干
See, it says you shouldn't do that.

633
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,640
你怎么能知道哪有暗礁哪没有?
How do you know they're submerged if they're submerged?

634
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,280
古斯  你到底在干什么?
Gooz, what in the hell are you doing?

635
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,360
为他修冲浪板
Just trying to fix this surfboard thing.

636
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,340
被礁石撞坏了
He keeps taking chunks off his nose on the rocks.

637
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,990
放假的时候还要继续搞我的新发明  古斯水平舵
On my day off, I'm working on my new invention, the Gooz Cruise Fin.

638
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,590
我要发财啦! 所有的冲浪板都需要加装我的水平舵
I'm gonna be a rich fella. Every surfboard in the nation's gonna need one.

639
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,330
你最好打扫干净
Yeah? Well, you're gonna need a broom.

640
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,830
瞧瞧新来的菜鸟
Check out these new recruits.

641
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,900
嗨  哈
Hi. Aloha.

642
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,770
你们是飞行员吗?
You all pilots?

643
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,910
好像很复杂  上面有不少开关和按钮
We're working on it. It's a lot of switches and stuff.

644
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,690
太平洋的骄傲
Pride of the Pacific.

645
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,680
你们是谁?
Who are you?

646
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,850
空中杀手
Terrors of the skies.

647
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,590
欢迎  小姐们
Welcome, ladies.

648
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,560
等我解决了这个黑屁股  再带你们逛逛
I have to deal with toasty sunburnt fanny before I can show you around.

649
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,170
亲爱的伊芙琳 一切都出乎我的意料
Ow! Dear Evelyn. It's different than I thought it would be here.

650
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,240
这儿很冷、冷得刺骨
It's cold... so cold it goes deep into your bones.

651
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:50,050
但有一股暖流在我的胸中涌动  那就是我们的爱情
There is one place I can go to find warmth. That is to think of you.

652
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,850
我祈祷能早日回到你的身旁
I just wish I could be back there with you.

653
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,660
在这很难交到朋友
It's not easy making friends.

654
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,860
两天前  一对皇家飞行员夫妇  还和我们一起喝啤酒
Two days ago, I had a beer... with a couple of the RAF pilots.

655
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,360
昨天他们双双阵亡
Yesterday, both of them got killed.

656
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,610
亲爱的雷夫  我对你的思念难以叙说
Dear Rafe. I miss you so much.

657
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,750
千山万水将我们阻隔
It's so strange to be half a world away from you.

658
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,590
我咬住他了
I'm right on his tail!

659
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,030
打下一架
Got one!

660
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,830
黄昏  我注视着斜阳
Every night I look at the sunset...

661
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,600
希望留住最后的余辉
and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day...

662
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,170
用我的心温暖远方的爱人
and send it from my heart to yours.

663
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,790
家人吗?
Family?

664
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,650
女友  长官  我的意中人
Girl, sir. The girl.

665
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,390
许多人责怪美国人不参战
A lot of people frown on the Yanks for not being in this war yet.

666
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,700
我只想说  要是每个美国军人都跟你一样
I'd just like to say... if there are many more back home like you...

667
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,770
谁都不敢与美国为敌
God help anyone who goes to war with America.

668
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,770
礼仪分队  持枪!
Atten- hut! Attention on deck!

669
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,280
太平洋舰队总司令金梅尔上将登舰
Admiral Kimmel... Commander- in- Chief, Pacific Fleet, on deck.

670
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,720
士气很高昂  上校
Sharp presentation, Captain.

671
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,520
谢谢  将军
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.

672
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,120
已经四个月了
For four months now Washington's been

673
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,920
华盛顿闭口不谈日本的威胁
blowing pink smoke about the threat from Japan.

674
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,690
这可能会影响我们的士气  我特别强调不能放松警惕
Could make us lose our fighting edge. I'm determined not to let that happen.

675
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,660
对不起  上校  将军  华盛顿急电
With your permission, Captain. Admiral, urgent, from Washington.

676
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,010
太平洋舰队正在积极准备对抗日本人
I'm supposed to keep this fleet...

677
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,510
保卫覆盖半个地球的太平洋
battle- ready to take on the Japanese... cover half the damn globe.

678
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,900
现在他们却要调十二艘驱逐舰到大西洋
Now they want me to transfer another

679
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,060
他们不知道我们也面临危险吗?
twelve destroyers to the Atlantic. Don't they know what we're facing out here?

680
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,120
他们认为欧洲的战事是最紧要的
They feel Europe is the greater danger.

681
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,090
有人考虑夏威夷的危险吗?
I'm assuming these risk assessments include Hawaii?

682
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,150
珍珠港水浅  敌人不能实施鱼雷攻击
Pearl Harbor is too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack.

683
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,960
而且受到潜艇的保护
We're surrounded by sub nets.

684
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,990
唯一需要担心的是敌人破坏我们的飞机
All we need worry about is sabotage...

685
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,300
所以我们把飞机集中起来  方便保护
so we bunched our planes together to make them easier to protect.

686
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,900
距离是天然的屏障  将军
Distance is our ally, Admiral.

687
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,800
你们分析了所有的可能性  对吗?
You analysts got it all figured out, don't you?

688
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,780
聪明的敌人常常会出其不意痛击你自以为很安全的地方
The smart enemy hits you exactly where you think you're safe.

689
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,900
我从观光飞机上


690
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,910
拍到军舰和空军基地的照片


691
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,910
这些军舰都停靠在一起


692
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,740
那是最明显的目标


693
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:15,060
为了适应水深我们改装了鱼雷


694
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,900
加装了木鳍


695
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,230
鱼雷就可以在浅水中攻击


696
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,170
趁珍珠港还没有苏醒


697
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,270
我们要发起猛烈的攻击


698
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,470
我修理了液压和电器系统  长官
In coming! I fixed the hydraulics and electrics, sir,

699
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,190
但是来不及修理油管
but the oil hoses still need attention.

700
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,740
启动引擎吧
Just crank it, lan!

701
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,270
祝你好运  长官
God speed you, sir.

702
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,750
红队  攻击轰炸机  蓝队  盯住战斗机
Red section, take the bombers. Blue section, look out for the fighters.

703
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:16,380
轰炸机在前方  咱们给他们点颜色瞧瞧
Bombers dead ahead. Let's dropin and give them a reception.

704
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,260
红二号  跟着我  爬高  攻击领头的轰炸机
Red Two, follow my lead, high side. Go right at the lead bomber.

705
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,290
好的  红一号
Following you, Red One.

706
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,500
打得好
Good hit! Good hit!

707
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,540
红一号  转回来攻击敌机
Red One, coming around, reset for the kill.

708
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,210
我锁定中间那一架
I have the middle bomber.

709
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,750
开火
Hammer down!

710
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,420
打中了  打得好  红二号
We got him. Nice shot, Red Two.

711
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,890
正前方有两架敌机
I got two M.E. s dead ahead.

712
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,170
我盯着他  让我来
I'm on him. I'm on his tail.

713
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,130
开火
Hammer down.

714
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,510
我打下一架
I got one of them!

715
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,950
我又打下一架
I got another one.

716
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,720
红一号  你的后面有一组编队
Red One, you got fighters all over your tail!

717
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,690
我受到攻击!我受到攻击!
I'm under fire! I'm taking fire!

718
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,190
红一号  快逃走  赶快拉高
Red One, get out of there. Pull up! Pull up!

719
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,430
油管破裂
Argh! I got an oil leak.

720
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,410
我什么也看不到了
Can't see a damn thing!

721
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,310
无法跳伞!座舱罩卡死了  我跳不出去
I can't bail! My canopy's stuck! I can't bail out!

722
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,630
敌机向我开火  红二号
He's on my tail, Red Two.

723
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,930
我被击中了!我被击中了!
I'm hit! I'm hit!

724
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,380
遇难信号!发信号!
Mayday! Mayday!

725
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,690
噢  我的天
Oh, my God.

726
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,300
我不想去教堂
I'm no good at church.

727
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,600
你怎么了?亲爱的
What do you mean, sweetie?

728
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,750
每当我走进去  开始忏悔
When I'm up there getting my slate wiped clean...

729
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:54,040
我就想到我还会做错事儿
I can't help I'm thinking how to dirty it up again.

730
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,310
这有什么关系
Wow, this from a virgin!

731
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,350
我要去清点备用品
I got to inventory supplies.

732
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,320
烦死了  能安静一会儿吗?
Kill me now. Could you be any more boring?

733
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,610
别管她  她要写信给雷夫
Don't bother. Sunday, she writes Rafe...

734
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,990
平常写五页  假日写十页
ten pages instead of the usual five.

735
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,050
我真想谈恋爱
Gosh, I wish I was in love.

736
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,390
嘿  亲爱的
Hey, sweetheart.

737
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,930
她讨厌我
She hates me.

738
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,300
见到你真好  雷德
Good to see you, Red.

739
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,410
我也是  贝蒂
Good to see you, too, Betty.

740
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,650
想一起兜兜风吗?
You wanna come for a ride?

741
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,940
来吧
Come on.

742
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,270
太好了  我来当你的司机
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.

743
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,450
狠狠地扁他  兄弟
That- a- boy! Be a mad dog!

744
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,830
做饭的  你还有两下子
You hit pretty hard... for a cook.

745
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,330
你赌谁赢?沃克
All right, Walker, who you got?

746
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,400
快点!要打完了
Come on! Get out there now!

747
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,830
我赌厨子
I'll take the cook.

748
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,330
为什么?你想输钱吗?
Why? You don't like money?

749
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,100
我赌五块
I'll put five on it.

750
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:00,870
好
Done.

751
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,210
对手是机师? 那家伙是头野牛  不好对付
Against a mechanic? That guy craps rivets.

752
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,870
刚从机舱里面出来感觉怎样?
How's it feel up from the engine room?

753
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,780
阳光很刺眼吧  眼睛睁不开吧?
Sunlight bothering you?

754
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,850
他打得很猛!移动!移动!
Ow. Man, he's getting all busted up!

755
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,760
过来  我告诉你  坐下来
Come here, we gotta talk. Get down here.

756
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,290
他伤不了你  他伤不了你
He can't hurt us. He can hurt us.

757
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,300
他伤得了我  我流血了
He can hurt us, he cut us. We bleeding.

758
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,900
流血?
Bleeding?

759
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,210
那只是小伤  看看这个
That's a scratch. See this?

760
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,810
黑哥们儿可都把血汗钱押在你身上了
This is the hard- earned greenbacks of every pot- scrubbing chop in this fleet.

761
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,450
要是你输了我们可就完了
Now if we don't win. Teeny here has to find another battle ship!

762
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,080
我不能空着手回亚利桑纳号
I'm not going back to the Arizona empty- handed.

763
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,950
别担心你的钱
Don't worry about the money.

764
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:48,520
我要把这家伙打回老家  让他滚回自己的机舱去
I'll send that smug engine- fixing snipe... back below decks where he belong.

765
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,130
加油  好兄弟!那混帐东西打了你老妈!是个婊子养的!
We the man! He slapped your mama! Be a son of a bitch!

766
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,280
你瞧  好耶  多利
Look at this! All right, Dorie!

767
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,260
够了  够了
That's enough. That's enough.

768
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,760
我的钱呢?
Oh! Where's my money?

769
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,330
不行  他作弊
Nah, fight's rigged.

770
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,620
咱们发了!哈!哈!哈!
We're rich! Ha ha ha!

771
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,600
你是怎么受伤的?
How'd you get this?

772
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,070
拳击
Boxing.

773
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,310
你赢了吗?
Did you win?

774
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:37,810
是的  护士小姐
Yes, ma'am.

775
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,110
赢了会怎样?
What do you get for winning?

776
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,740
获得尊严
Respect.

777
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,150
拳头能打出尊严来吗?
So, why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?

778
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,850
我离开妈妈  离开德克萨斯  去当海军就是为了见见世面
I left my momma in Texas and joined the Navy to see the world...

779
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,790
为了做个受尊重的人
... become a man.

780
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,670
他们却叫我当厨子  甚至连厨子都不算
They made me a cook. Not even that.

781
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,100
还要为其他水兵收拾餐厅
I clean up after other sailors eat.

782
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,640
都两年了  我还没打过枪
Two years, they never even let me fire a weapon.

783
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,370
希望你永远不要碰枪
Well, let's hope you never have to.

784
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,840
是的  护士小姐
Yes, ma'am.

785
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,510
保重了  米勒士官
You take care, Petty Officer Miller.

786
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,950
你也是  护士小姐
You, too, ma'am.

787
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,590
你知道吗  他教我飞行
You know, he taught me to fly.

788
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:13,370
无论我遇到任何麻烦  我都不会束手无策
I always knew that no matter what trouble I got into... I'd never be in it alone.

789
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,560
他总会帮我渡过难关
He'd be there with me.

790
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,310
就是在天上他也逼着我超过别人
He was always pushing me to be better and faster.

791
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,220
他说你是个了不起的飞行员
He told me you were a great flier.

792
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:31,210
那天晚上他告诉我  他自愿去英国
It was the same night he told me he'd volunteered to go to England.

793
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,630
自愿?
Volunteered?

794
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,020
他跟我说他是被指派去的
He... he told me he'd been assigned.

795
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,570
他总是在设法保护我
He was always trying to protect me.

796
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:56,150
但是你知道吗?我看着镜子里面  穿着这身制服的自己
But you know what? I look at myself in the mirror in this uniform...

797
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,180
我都不知道我是谁
and I still don't know who I am.

798
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,790
我看起来像英雄吗?我感觉不是
I look like a hero... but I don't feel like it.

799
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:14,000
雷夫  他一向都是表里如一  不是吗?
Rafe... he always looked the part, didn't he?

800
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,330
他无法等到成为英雄的那一天了
He couldn't wait to be one.

801
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:46,000
敬雷夫・麦考利  最棒的飞行员
To Rafe McCawley. The best pilot...

802
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,030
我曾经最好的朋友

(为国捐躯)


806
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,060
攻击训练正在进行中


807
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,670
为保证任务成功


808
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,630
高空轰炸及鱼雷攻击训练是极为重要的


809
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,970
只要偷袭顺利


810
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,840
美国人只有坐以待毙


811
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:37,010
制造大量的假情报麻痹美国人


812
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,380
特别要关注太平洋的主要目标


813
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,080
尤其是夏威夷  不能放松


814
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,620
你太英明了  山本大将


815
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:53,260
英明的人能避免战争

你看看
Look at this.

819
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:07,770
太平洋上到处都是日本人的电报
The Japanese are flooding the Pacific with radio traffic.

820
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,400
从巴拿马运河到东南亚都有
Everywhere from the Panama Canal to southeast Asia.

821
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,080
这不合乎逻辑  上校
There's no logical pattern, Captain.

822
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,950
对  这其中必有玄机
No. There's always logic.

823
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,380
他们知道我们在监听
They know we read their mail.

824
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,550
他们想让我们以为他们的舰队在向南移动
They're trying to make us think their fleet is moving south.

825
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,690
我不吃这一套  其中肯定有阴谋
I'm not buying it. Something, something's up.

826
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,430
否则  这也太明目张胆了
Otherwise, why would they take the trouble to bullshit me?

827

伊芙琳  我替你签收了这些信
Evelyn, I signed for these letters for you today.

They're from England.

829

雷夫的信
They're from Rafe.

830
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,350
很抱歉  伊芙琳  邮件比消息慢
I'm sorry, Evelyn. You know how long it takes mail to get here.

美国还在等待日本的和平答复

野村大使抵达首都华盛顿

...to rule the skies over the Channel.

胜利来之不易  许多优秀飞行员献出了生命
Victory does not come without sacrifice.

伊芙琳
Evelyn!

843
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,740
丹尼  真巧啊
Danny. Hey. Some comedy, huh?

844
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,800
- 好久不见  - 我一直在进行训练
- It's been a while. - I've been logging a lot offlight hours.

845
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,620
我也一直碰不到你
I kinda been avoiding you, too.

846
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,190
你想不想  你
Look... Do you...

847
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,390
你想吗?
Do you want to?

848
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,360
好啊
Sure, yeah.

849
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,010
我记得我七岁那年  有一次
I remember this one time when I was like, seven years old.

850
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:17,500
那时候我老是爱做一些小玩艺儿
I was always building gadgets and things.

851
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,600
雷夫让我给他做一对翅膀  他就能像他老爸一样飞行
He wanted me to build him some wings so he could fly like his daddy.

852
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,040
我说没有引擎就飞不了
I told him you can't fly without some kind of engine.

853
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:29,170
但是他不肯听  他说  我叫你做就做
But he wouldn't listen. "Danny, never mind that, just build them anyway."

854
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,350
我只好照办了  我爬到谷仓上
So I did. And I'm up there...

855
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:34,860
帮他把大翅膀绑在身上
strapping these big old wings on his back...

856
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,420
那是我们用偷来的废纸、胶水和破布黏起来的
...that we made from paper and glue and these massive silk bloomers that we stole.

857
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:44,160
他的样子好蠢  我说  你不能这样从谷仓上跳下去
He looked so stupid, and I told him "You can't jump off the barn in these."

858
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:48,830
然后一声巨响  他摔断了一条腿
And bam! He busted his leg on a backhoe.

859
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,270
我好想念他
God, I miss him.

860
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,540
你想不到的是隔天他又爬上了屋顶
But don't you think that Rafe wasn't back up there next day.

861
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:05,850
包着石膏  还叫我把翅膀做一些调整
Cast and everything, telling me to make some adjustments on those wings.

866
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,090
怎么回事?雷德
What's going on, Red?

867
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,290
你要站起来
Stand up, please.

868
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,270
为什么?
What do you mean?

869
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,910
你站起来  我跪着
Just stand up. Stand...

870
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,920
雷德  快点  我们有订位耶
Betty... Red, come on! We got a dinner reservation.

871
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,620
等一下行吗?
Can I get a minute?

872
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:49,830
你发神经了?
What's the matter, you sick?

873
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,700
我不能求婚吗?
Can a guy propose?!

874
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,430
我太多话吗? 有时候我很唠叨  对不起
Am I talking too much? Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.

875
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,440
看!你们看这个!
Hold up! Look at this.

876
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,910
好了  别打扰他们  我们走吧
OK, let's get out of here. OK.

877
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,450
我该走了
I guess I should go.

878
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,020
别一等要三个月才能够再见到你  好吗?
Don't let it be three months before I see you again, all right?

879
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,220
我很开心
I had a good time.

880
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,530
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

881
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,060
要我送你回家吗?
Do you want me to walk you home?

882
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,670
不用  我自己回去
No, I'll be fine.

883
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,790
好吧
No...of course.

884
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,730

Good night.

886
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,860
我在想我能不能偶尔到你家
I was just wondering if maybe I could come by some time...

887
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,960
喝杯咖啡吃点东西什么的?
...get a cup of coffee or a piece of pie?

888
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,650
我这是在干嘛?好了
What am I doing? OK.

889
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,320
老天  你睡了
Oh! You were asleep.

890
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,870
对不起  你还穿着睡衣  丹尼
I'm sorry. Danny?

891
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:03,770
出了什么事?
Is something wrong?

892
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,340
没事  没什么  你好
No! Nothing's wrong. No problem. Hi!

893
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,270
是丹尼
It's just Danny.

894
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,700
我来是  你忘了这个
I... just... you... you forgot this.

895
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,200
噢  谢谢
Oh... thanks.

896
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:21,350
太麻烦你了  这么晚还送来
It was good of you to take the trouble to drop it over... now.

897
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:26,610
嗯  我想你可能用得着  你知道  也许明天一早
well, I thought you might need it. You know... maybe tomorrow morning.

898
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:29,830
你没带这个去上班
If... not that you wear this to work, but...

899
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,900
不过只是条手帕
No... it's a hankie.

900
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,040
对  没错
Right, right. Yeah.

901
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,480
我在想  也许哪天我能到你这来
Listen, I was thinking maybe I could come by some time...

902
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,170
如果我给你打电话  我能来吗?
if I gave you a call, could I come by some time?

903
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,510
如果你一旦有空的话  也许
Once, maybe... if you're not busy?

904
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,880
嗯  也许吧
Yeah, maybe.

905
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,550

晚安
Good- bye.

907
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,460
你是个白痴!
You are such an idiot!

908
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,050
昨晚你和丹尼怎么样?
Did you have fun last night?

909
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,550
不是你想象那样的
It wasn't how it looked.

910
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,680
就算是  也没关系的
And if it was, it'd be all right.

911
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,620
已经好几个月了  你得继续过日子
It's been months. It's time to move on.

912
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,060
我很好啊
I am moving on.

913
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,790
你别骗人  我知道  晚上我都听见你在哭泣
Ev, don't lie. All I know is, I hear you crying when you think I'm asleep.

914
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,730
我爸抛弃我们以后
When my dad left... I was too much for my mom to handle...

915
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,830
我妈就把我送到姑妈家
...so she sent me to live with my aunt.

916
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,390
我以为我这辈子就完蛋了  但是你并不知道接下来会怎样
I thought my life was over... But you don't know where it's all gonna lead.

917
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,030
如果我没有从家里面逃出来  谎报年龄
If I hadn't run away and lied about my age...

918
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:38,830
参加海军  我就不会认识雷德
...and enlisted in the Navy... I wouldn't have met Red,

919
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,840
现在他是我的未婚夫了
and... now he's my fiance.

920
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,910
我真不习惯这种称呼
Oh, God, I can't get used to that word.

921
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,520
不过才十二小时而已
It's only been twelve hours.

922
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,880

- Oh, Betty! - Little Betty beat us all to the post.

And this is ward three. As you can see, no patients.

Sandra, new recruits to torture. Come on.

926
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,590
对不起  各位女士
Excuse me, ladies?

927
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:06,800
再过两年等我十九岁的时候  雷德就要买戒指给我
We're gonna wait two years until I'm nineteen and Red can buy me a ring.

928
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,270
雷夫让他最好的朋友照顾你
Rafe sent his best friend to tell you...

929
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:14,070
你应当振作起来了  继续活下去
...so you would be OK, so you can move on.

930
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,840
你还要继续生活下去
You gotta go on living, Ev.

931
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:28,120
雷德!喔  对不起!
Red! Whoo! Sorry!

932
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,900
永别了  雷夫
Bye, Rafe.

00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,930
我们的侦察机搜遍了太平洋
We're sending scout planes in wider vectors...

938
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:07,340
一无所获
all over the Pacific, but they get nothing.

939
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,410
他们可能隐藏在这里的某个地方
They could be anywhere in here.

940
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:16,330
我真不明白  两个航母编队能突然消失了?
I don't understand how two whole carrier divisions can just disappear.

941
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,000
安全
Clear!

942
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,070
都打偏了  一个偏外  一个偏内
Aw, we're all over the page. We got one wall- eyed and one pigeon- toed.

943
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,700
- 安东尼  调整一下六号机枪  - 好的
- Anthony, tap in number six. - All right.

944
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,080
古斯
Gooz,

945
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,050
- 调整一下三号机枪  - 好的
- tap in number three. - All right.

946
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,480
嘿  有客人来了
Hey. We got a visitor.

947
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,190
哦  那可不是海军制服
Oh... that ain't no Navy issue uniform, eh?

948
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,050
丹尼  是伊芙琳
Danny, it's Evelyn.

949
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,520
老天爷
Jesus!

950
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:54,460
你还好吧?
You all right?

951
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,030
很好
Yeah. Yeah.

952
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,760
我不好
No.

953
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,300
我想我大概爱上她了
I think I'm falling for her.

954
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,140
你知道的  我早就猜到了
Wow. You know, I saw this coming.

955
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,840
我从未想过  来得太突然了  情不自禁的
I didn't want this to happen. It just kind of did. Can't help it.

956
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,410
她总要嫁人  你是最合适的
Well, Danny, she's gotta be with somebody. It might as well be you.

957
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:13,410
你告诉我  如果你阵亡了  而你最好的兄弟却在搞你的女友
You telling me if you were dead and you saw your best buddy doing your girl...

958
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,950
你不会起死复生  狠狠地揍这个活着的臭小子一顿吧?
...you wouldn't come back and beat the living crap outta him?

959
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,280
托尼  给我闭嘴
Tony, back off.

960
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,980
我会死也不会放过他
I'd be back so fast.

961
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,580
丹尼重情重义  会照顾好她的
Danny's being a better friend taking care of her himself.

962
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,590
我也有女朋友
I got a girlfriend.

963
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:31,430
那太好了  我们走吧
That's great. Come on, fellas. Let's split.

964
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,160
丹尼  不管怎样这都是你和她的事了
Danny, whatever happens now is just about you and her.

965
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,730
别总想着雷夫
You gotta try and forget about Rafe.

966
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,740
小心点  好吗? 女人会蛊惑人心
Be careful, all right? Ladies... cloud the mind.

967
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,450
谢了  古斯
Thanks, Gooz.

968
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,510
不客气
You're welcome.

969
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,910
嘿  丹尼
Hey, Danny.

970
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:52,980
他们要去哪儿?
Where's everybody going?

971
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,150
他们在避嫌
Just being discreet.

972
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,490
好像大家都挺怪怪的
Does it seem like everybody's acting a little strange?

973
01:00:58,830 --> 01:00:59,890
没有呀
No. Nah.

974
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,800
对
Right.

975
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,490
嗯  也许  也许是有一点吧
Well, maybe... maybe a little. Yeah.

976
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,700
这里的人都太闲了
Well, people in this outfit... have way too much time on their hands.

977
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:12,990
关于我们
Oh, yeah. I just hope they don't think

978
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:14,970
但愿他们别乱想得离谱
there's been something... going on between us, that's all.

979
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,710
没有啦  那就太尴尬了
Oh, no. I mean, no. That would be... embarrassing, right?

980
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,390
这里是檀香山广播电台
This is KGMB in Honolulu...

981
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,360
瓦胡岛又是一个美丽的秋天
on another beautiful fall day here in paradise.

982
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,900
我们掌握了足够的情报
We have enough information.

983
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,230
我们可以回去了
We are returning home.

984
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,500
你想过我们是否会被卷入战争?
Do you ever wonder... if this war's gonna catch up with us?

985
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:23,380
没怎么想过
Not a whole lot.

986
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:26,060
我们没在一起的时候  为准备战争
Every moment we're not together,

987
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,540
你都在天上训练
you're up there training for it.

988
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,750
对  我还为现在这种情况接受过训练...
Yeah, well, I'm training for moments like these...

989
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,520
因为我根本不知道
'cause I have no idea...

990
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,520
如何把车子从沙坑里面开出来
how I'm gonna get this car out of the sand.

991
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,820
伊芙琳  你可以从浴室里面出来吗?
Evelyn, can you please come out of the bathroom?

992
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,060
你都进去一个小时啦
You've been there for an hour.

993
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,610
伊芙琳! 你干什么呢  想学我?
Evelyn! What are you trying to do, look like me?

994
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,310
你不舒服?
Are you OK?

995
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,710
没事
Yeah.

996
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,340
怎么了? 该死
What's the matter? No, you... D'oy.

997
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,490
他们称这为空海
They call it the vacant sea.

998
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:56,560
没有航道经过
None of the major sea lanes go through it...

999
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,380
你可以把整个亚洲藏在那儿
and you can bury the entire land mass of Asia there...

1000
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,850
没人会知道
and nobody would know.

1001
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,590
日本人可以从那儿向任何目标发起攻击
From there, they could attack anywhere.

1002
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,490
最新的情报显示
Our last signals intercept indicate that the Japanese

1003
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,070
日本的战斗编队正在向南行驶
taskforce is heading south...

1004
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,870
到菲律宾或东南亚
towards the Philippines or southeast Asia.

1005
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,950
但海军情报局的瑟曼上校对
But Captain Thurman of Naval intelligence

1006
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:15,040
失踪的日本舰队有他自己的看法
here has his own theory about the missing ships.

1007
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,720
长官  我认为
Sir, I believe they'll try to hit us where

1008
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,780
他们要攻击我们的珍珠港
it'll hurt us the most... Pearl Harbor.

1009
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,510
可这儿距离日本有四千海里远
It's over 4,000 nautical miles from Japan to Pearl.

1010
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:28,020
舰艇编队跑不了这么远  上校
That's along distance to steam a navy, Captain.

1011
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,760
你的根据是什么?
Your theory is based on what?

1012
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,260
如果是我  我就会那样做
Well, it's what I would do.

1013
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,560
但缺乏有说服力的证据  瑟曼上校
That's not exactly hard evidence, Captain Thurman.

1014
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:39,190
嗯  将军  我有确切的证据时候  我们已经处于战争状态了
Well, Admiral, if I had hard evidence... we'd already be at war.

1015
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,330
长官  我们可以很轻松地破译日本的外交密电
Sir, we can read their diplomatic codes faster than they can type them.

1016
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,810
但瑟曼上校的破译小组还在研究日本海军的密码
But Captain Thurman's cryptology team is still trying to crack the naval codes.

1017
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,810
截获的密电都缺行少字
The intercepts have missing words and garbled lines...

1018
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:51,530
必须弄清楚他们的真实企图
so to explain the decrypts, we have to try to interpret

1019
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:53,750
才有可能破译这些密电
what we think they're trying to do.

1020
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,940
企图?你是说猜测
Interpret? You mean guess.

1021
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:59,480
他们依靠自己的情报直觉  长官
They use their informed intuition, sir.

1022
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,890
我们就像在黑暗中摸索  必须掌握一切
We guess. It's like playing chess in the dark.

1023
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:06,320
每一个谣传、风吹草动
Any rumor, troop movement, ship movement spine- tingle,

1024
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,430
或军队调动都要注意
goose bump, we pay attention to it.

1025
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,410
我在驻守亚洲的时候
When I was in the

1026
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,350
当地人会
Asiatic Fleet the locals used to try

1027
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:14,220
从别的角度看问题
to get outside of a problem to try to see the inside.

1028
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,430
偷袭珍珠港对美国是最致命的打击
Well, I see a strike on Pearl. It's the worst thing that could happen.

1029
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:20,940
可以摧毁太平洋舰队的战斗力
A blow to Pearl would devastate the Pacific Fleet's ability to make war.

1030
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,480
你要我们根据你的直觉
So, sir, you would have us mobilize the entire fleet...

1031
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:27,780
花费数百万元让整个舰队进入战斗部署
at the cost of millions of dollars...

1032
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,920
而根据就是你的风声鹤唳
based on this spine- tingling feeling of yours?

1033
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:33,820
不是  长官  我的工作是收集情报
No, sir. My job is to gather and interpret material.

1034
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,320
根据我破解的不完整情报
Making difficult decisions based on incomplete information...

1035
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:42,220
做出困难的决定是您的责任  长官
...from my limited decoding ability is your job, sir.

1036
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,480
那就快点破译这该死的密码  上校
Then break the damn naval code, Captain

1037
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,300
这样我才能做出正确的决定
so I can make a better decision.

1038
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,340
是的  长官  我们尽力
Aye, sir. We are trying.

1039
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,250
我想知道我们是否应该让太平洋舰队进入全面警戒
I wonder if we shouldn't put the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

1040
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,590
先生们  如果
In case the optimism of the

1041
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,800
和谈结果并不乐观
"Honolulu Advertiser" proves unfounded, gentlemen...

1042
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,060
肖特将军和陆军
what are General Short and the

1043
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,940
能为我的舰队提供保护吗?
Army going to do about protecting my ships?

1044
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,400
珍珠港半径十英里内
Within a ten- mile radius of your harbor,

1045
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,370
惠勒机场有战斗机
we have fighter planes here at Wheeler...

1046
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,980
希凯姆机场有轰炸机和训练用跑道
bombers at Hickam, and a training strip at Haleiwa.

1047
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:40,290
左十度


1048
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,050
我们最近在这新建了一个雷达站
We've recently established a radar station here

1049
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:46,150
能侦察一百二十五英里外的敌机
that can detect planes 125 miles out.

1050
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:48,910
那是一个月前才建成的  还没有检测过
Which is a month old, Admiral, and untested.

1051
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,780
我也见过这些新雷达  少校
I've seen these new radar screens, Major.

1052
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,320
它们根本分辨不出
There's no way of telling whether they're ours,

1053
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,940
是敌机还是该死的鸟
theirs or a flock of damn birds.

1054
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,310
(一九四一年十二月五日  珍珠港)


1055
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:00,880
我监听到一个来自东京打到珍珠港附近某地的电话
I'm intercepting a call from Tokyo to somewhere close by Pearl.

1056
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,790
东京来的  他说不认识你
There's a call from Tokyo. They say they don't know you.

1057
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:09,390
你好?是我  喂  喂
Hello? Hai. Moshi, moshi

1058
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:19,240
是个当地牙医  他说从他的办公室可以看到珍珠港
It's a local dentist. He can see Pearl Harbor from his office.

1059
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,270
对方问有很多水手吗?
Are there many sailors around?

1060
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:30,910
牙医说航空母舰没在港口
Uh, the dentist says that the flatships are not in port.

1061
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,390
他们在谈天气
They're talking about the weather.

1062
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,960
他好像不知道对方是谁
He doesn't seem to know who he's talking to.

1063
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:43,730
喂?你好  喂? 莫名其妙
Hello? Moshi moshi. Hello? That was a strange call.

1064
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,160
将军  能单独向您汇报吗?
Admiral, may I speak to you in private?

1065
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:52,500
间谍为什么敢用电话? 他们知道我们在进行监听
Why would a spy use a phone? They know we tap all international lines.

1066
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,670
监听人员认为他们并没有使用暗语
Our listeners feel it's probably not code talk.

1067
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,320
听起来好像日本人想从本地居民口中
It sounds like someone in Japan is sneaking

1068
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,080
打探我们的航空母舰在哪
around asking a local citizen the location of our carriers.

1069
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:03,280
这让我觉得心里很乱  马上通知联邦调查局
Well, that makes me feel all warm inside. Get the FBI on it immediately.

1070
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,350
我们还没找到那该死的日本舰队吗?
Have we found the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?

1071
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,830
还没有  将军  我们正在整个太平洋上搜索
No, Admiral. The bases are looking all over the Pacific.

1072
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,140
那是不是该死的日本舰队在钻石海峡转悠
So the entire fleet could be rounding Diamond Head

1073
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,500
所以我们才一无所知
and we wouldn't know a thing about it.

1074
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,230
继续寻找
Get on it.

1075
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,990
我还活着
I'm alive.

1076
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:53,060
太困难了  我们没办法通知你
This is the first I could get word out.

1077
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,990
(法语)


1078
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:55,440
我答应过你一定会回来
I told you I'd come back.

1079
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:05,360
来  坐吧  都过去了  没事了
Here, sit down. Sit down. Come here. It's OK. It's all right.

1080
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:09,890
真的是你
You're real.

1081
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,230
是啊
Yeah.

1082
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:14,470
我每天都梦想这一天
I wished for this every day.

1083
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:18,070
我也是  我每分每秒都在想你
I know. Me, too. Every second. So did I.

1084
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,800
我以为你死了  他们说你被击落  掉进了海里
I thought you were dead. They said you were shot down in the sea.

1085
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:25,250
没错
Yeah, I was.

1086
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:30,290
我掉进海里  冷极了  我好想你
I was in the ocean. It was so cold. I missed you.

1087
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:34,190
后来  法国渔船救起了我
I got picked up by a French fishing boat...

1088
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:37,160
在法国的被占区  我不能写信给你
and I was in occupied France, and I couldn't get word out.

1089
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,160
我差一点就  我会全部告诉你的  我保证
And I'm just... I'll tell you all about it, I promise.

1090
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:42,390
现在好啦  我回来了
But I'm fine. I'm OK. And I'm here now.

1091
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:48,300
伊芙琳  我好想见到你  你太美啦
Evelyn... I just wanted to see you. You're so beautiful.

1092
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,180
我爱你
I love you.

1093
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:14,690
嘿  都过去了  伊芙琳  我回来了
Hey, it's OK. It's OK. Evelyn, Evelyn. I'm back.

1094
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,840
没事了  我发誓永远也不离开你了
It's OK. I won't leave you again, I promise.

1095
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,100
雷夫  你死了
Rafe, you died.

1096
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,940
我的心也死了
And so did I.

1097
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:30,970
我知道  我现在回来了
I know, but I'm... I'm... It's fine now. I'm back.

1098
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,950
我们团聚了
We're together.

1099
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:43,830
我们又团聚了  对吧?
I mean, we are together... right?

1100
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,690
我不知道我在哪
I don't know where I am.

1101
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:53,870
雷夫
Rafe.

1102
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:23,830
雷夫
Rafe.

1103
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:29,600
离我远点
Stay away.

1104
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,480
雷夫
Rafe.

1105
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,360
这里是檀香山电台
This is Radio Honolulu...

1106
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,270
在这个令人愉快的太平洋岛屿上
playing the sweetest music on the sweetest island

1107
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:42,320
在这个阳光明媚的十二月六日
in the Pacific.

1108
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,690
我们为你送上优美的音乐
It's a beautiful December 6th with beautiful music

1109
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,160
要是美国人起了疑心


1110
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,390
他们的广播会告诉我们


1111
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,470
雷夫
Rafe!

1112
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:02,160
噢  我的妈呀
Oh, God damn it.

1113
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,300
真正的王牌飞行员!
There you go. A real live ace!

1114
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:08,400
王牌飞行员才击落了五架敌机  而我击落了六架
Whoo! An ace is only five. I shot down six M.E.s.

1115
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,850
还有两架打冒了烟  他们没算进去
And I got two smokers, too. They don't count them.

1116
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,140
我还没有受勋  就被打下来
Of course, I got shot down myself before they could pin me.

1117
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,730
那你从前线回来了
So you got back from behind enemy lines, huh?

1118
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,950
打仗到底是什么感觉?
What's that combat like?

1119
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,610
你害怕吗?
Were you scared?

1120
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,720
嗨!一个一个来
Hey! One at a time.

1121
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:23,230
纳粹空军的技术非常棒
Well, them Luftwaffe boys can fly pretty good.

1122
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:25,660
你要知道  这跟训练可是两码事儿  他们
It's not like, you know, training. They're, uh...

1123
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,460
丹尼  知道吗  他们很讲究战术
Danny. You know, they're all about tactics is what it is.

1124
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,600
纳粹飞行员比你飞得快
See, the Nazis, right, they're faster than you are...

1125
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,750
他们钻进云层  一个俯冲
so they'll disappear and they get up in

1126
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,010
就到你头顶
the soup and they'll throw like a roll or a hammerhead...

1127
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:42,010
然后像某些美国人一样
and they'll come around on your high side

1128
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:44,410
从背后偷袭你
shoot you from behind like some Americans will.

1129
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:53,850
古斯  这才是真正的王牌
Hey... Gooz, you're looking at a real live ace.

1130
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,020
让我把这件衬衫脱下来送给你!
Well, let me give you the shirt off my back!

1131
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,620
拿去吧
There you go!

1132
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:01,630
那我就不客气了
I'll take it from you.

1133
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:02,760
反正我也需要便服
I can see how you all been spending your time out here.

1134
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,700
嘿  雷夫  我们得谈谈  好吗?
Hey, Rafe, we gotta talk, all right?

1135
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,290
我和你没什么好谈的  过来
I got nothing to talk about with you. Here.

1136
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:10,560
干一杯吧
Why don't you have a drink?

1137
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,370
我来敬酒
I'll make a toast.

1138
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:16,340
为了死里逃生
To returning from the dead.

1139
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,620
真没想到  可这就是生活
Wasn't all I expected, but, well, that's life.

1140
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,350
敬我最好的朋友  丹尼
To my best friend and loyal buddy Danny...

1141
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:26,190
为了他所做的一切干杯
for keeping up the war effort back here at home.

1142
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,890
知道吗  在英国有人向你敬酒你却不喝
You know, where I come from somebody makes a toast to you...

1143
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:37,290
那就是不给别人面子
...and you don't drink that's saying something.

1144
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,470
好吧  雷夫  既然话都说到这个份上
All right, Rafe. That's how it's gonna be

1145
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:43,810
为你干杯!
To you.

1146
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:46,100
我想  你们两个需要单独谈谈
Hey, you guys need to spend some time alone, I think.

1147
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,840
不  别走  雷德
Aw, hell, no, Red. Come on.

1148
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,750
不  不  我们就在这儿庆祝
No, no, no. We're celebrating here.

1149
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:55,010
我在前方打仗  差点送了命
Me over there fighting... almost getting killed...

1150
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,780
我的朋友丹尼在后方  照顾我的一切
my friend Danny back here... looking after my interests for me.

1151
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,380
你知道吗  他太好了
You all know Danny was even good enough

1152
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,620
好得连我的女朋友都给照顾了
to look out for my girl for me while I was gone?

1153
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:05,630
我们以为你阵亡了  雷夫  我们都很悲痛
We thought you were dead, Rafe. And it gutted us both.

1154
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,290
可我们总还要继续生活下去
And we were just trying to get on with our lives.

1155
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,930
你过得不错  对吧?
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?

1156
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,370
你这个烂酒鬼  不讲道理  一直都是这样
You know, you're a rotten drunk. You always have been.

1157
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:16,030
你这个卑鄙的朋友  我才发现
Well, you're a lousy friend. That's a new development.

1158
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,940
你扔下她为别人去打仗
You left her to fight somebody else's war...

1159
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,430
你还设法不让我去
and you made damn sure that

1160
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:22,810
我们真的以为你死啦!
I didn't go with you and we thought that you were dead

1161
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:25,060
我是差点就死了  你这个狗娘养的
I almost did die, you little son of a bitch!

1162
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:27,610
那时候我想到的只有她
And her face was the last thing that went through my mind...

1163
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,850
别站在那告诉我这一切都是理所当然的!
so don't stand there and tell me to act like it's all right!

1164
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,410
不错  雷夫  我是留下了
Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed.

1165
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,820
你得知道情况改变了
I stayed, and you made sure of that and

1166
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:37,090
我希望你能接受现实
some things changed. And I hope you can get used to that.

1167
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:42,360
噢  我要接受现实? 好  让你看看我怎样接受的
Oh, I have to get used to it? All right. We'll see how I can get used to it.

1168
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:47,130
接受我的拳头吧  小子!
Get used to that, boy!

1169
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,900
我只用左手就够了
Hey, hey! And that's my left hand, too!

1170
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:58,180
有人在打架  快派宪兵来!
Melee at the Hula- la. Send M.P. s!

1171
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,950
你说我是卑鄙的朋友?
You called me a lousy friend?

1172
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:11,720
可恶  来啊  丹尼!
Ow! Shit! Come on, Danny!

1173
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,330
- 逮捕他们! - 快跑啊!
- Let's go get them. - Let's move out!

1174
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,010
我们会被关禁闭的  快走!
They're gonna throw us in the brig. Let's get outta here.

1175
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:46,720
编队在珍珠港北三百二十海里处待命


1176
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:06,210
帝国的兴衰在此一役！


1177
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,830
雷夫  你是我唯一的亲人
Rafe... you're the only family I got.

1178
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:25,620
你不在的时候  我孤独极了
When you were gone it was the loneliest I'd ever been.

1179
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,560
她和我一样
The same for her, too.

1180
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:30,310
噢  小子  你现在真的是让我心都碎了
Oh, boy, now you're really breaking my heart.

1181
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,340
你要是没走  什么都不会发生
If you hadn't gone, none of this woulda happened.

1182
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:34,210
这么说我猜是我错了?
Oh, so it's my fault, I guess.

1183
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:36,850
算了吧  雷夫
Damn it, Rafe.

1184
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,840
我看我们总会有办法
I just know there's got to be some way...

1185
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:50,740
妥善解决这个问题  让我们和好如初
we can work things out so that... things could be right between me and you.

1186
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,450
我看永远也不可能了
I just don't see how it could ever be the same.

1187
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,460
尊敬的父亲
Revered father...

1188
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,860
现在我要去执行任务  完成我的使命
I go now to full- fill my mission and my destiny.

1189
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:16,370
我希望能为我们全家带来荣誉
I hope it is a destiny that will bring honor to our family...

1190
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:19,520
如果需要付出生命
and if it reguires my life,

1191
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,020
我将在所不辞  精忠报国
I will sacrifice it gladly to be a good servant of our nation.

1192
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,890
嘿  我看到一大片阴影
Hey... we got a large haze.

1193
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:52,660
太大了不象飞机  对吧?
That's too big to be planes, right?

1194
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:59,410
你想走这步? 要跳马?
Is that what you wanna do? Knight to knight five?

1195
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:01,480
臭棋!

01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,420
跑道太短了  雷夫
It's real tight, Rafe! Real tight!

1379
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:35,710
嘿  雷夫  我们会撞上建筑物的
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure we have enough runway!

1380
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:37,880
起飞前开足马力
Get your airspeed up before you leave the dirt!

1381
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:40,150
别紧张  别紧张

01:52:44,230 --> 01:52:46,160
我可能飞不过去
I don't think I'm gonna make it over!

1383
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:59,670
我们成功了  飞起来了!

1387
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:20,650
超低空飞行  丹尼
Take it down to the deck, now!

1388
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:30,340
要分散他们
We gotta split them up.

1389
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:33,270
你往左、我往右
You take left, I'll take right.

01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:03,230
我正在上  塔可不低! 这儿有十层楼高
On the tower. Going ten stories up. It's a long son of a bitch.

1400
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:14,240
雷夫  他们紧咬着我不放  我甩不掉
Rafe, they're all over me! I can't get them off me!

1401
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:24,220
丹尼  我身后也有三架
Danny, I still got three on my tail!

1402
01:55:27,490 --> 01:55:29,550
颠簸飞行  别被他们盯死
Keep jinking it! Don't let them get a handle!

1403
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:30,780
我还是甩不掉他们
I can't shake them!

1404
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:33,530
可恶
God damn it.

我冲向你了
I'm coming right at you!

1409
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:49,510
别转向  听我指挥
Don't brake till I tell you. Hold on.

1410
01:55:51,050 --> 01:55:53,110

装上弹药
Come on, load it!

1416
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,430
我们准备好了
We're on the tower.

1417
01:56:13,970 --> 01:56:16,870
有架敌机跟着我  我引它过来
I got one on my tail. I'll bring him right by you.

1418
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:18,670
雷夫过来了
He's coming around!

1419
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:20,260
让我们来把这个日本笨鸟干掉!
Let's get this Jap sucker!

1420
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,810
先别开火  他来了
Hold your fire. Here he comes.

1421
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:29,640
厄尔  我飞过来的时候  你们最好瞄准一点
You better be cocked and locked when I come by there!

1422
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:33,110

They're pulling into the clouds! We ain't gonna let these sons of bitches get home!

1432
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:35,840
现在轮到你挨揍了
How do you like someone shooting back at you?

1433
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,050
噢  我盯死你了

出动飞机三百五十架  损失二十九架


1442
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:57,830
第三攻击波准备完毕  将军


1443
01:58:58,730 --> 01:59:02,100
突袭的意义已经不存在了


1444
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:05,640
取消第三波攻击


1445
01:59:05,970 --> 01:59:06,740
上将


1446
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:25,450
谁教你的绝招?

Sandra, we're running out of morphine. Find some way to mark them...

1451
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:49,010
这样我们才清楚谁已经注射过了
So we can keep track of who's got morphine already.

1452
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:51,550
你是哪一艘战舰的?战舰编号?

1453
01:59:51,550 --> 01:59:54,250

1455
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:00,990
M 代表吗啡

Evelyn! Go outside. There's too many to help. Sort them out.

1462

1465
02:00:57,650 --> 02:00:59,640
没有记号的不能进去
Don't look at anyone without a mark!

1466
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:01,620
退后  我叫你退后
I told you, stand back!

1467
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:04,780
别让他们进来
Keep them outside!

1468
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,290
在这儿等
Wait here.

1469
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,960
别碰我   日本鬼子  把你的臭手拿开
Don't touch me, you Jap! Get your hands off me!

1470
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:16,200
带到加护病房
Get him into critical. Get him off me.

1471
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:17,700
加护病房  向前走!
Critical, frontward!

1472
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:21,670
我伤得多重?
How bad am I?

1473
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:23,810
亲爱的  你不会有事
You're gonna be just fine, sweetheart.

1474
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:25,370
我不想死
I don't wanna die.

1475
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:27,710
你不会死的  我会帮你的
You're not gonna die. I've got your hand.

1476
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:31,350
有足够的吗啡给他止疼吗? 他快不行了  给他注射吗啡
Do you have enough morphine to make him comfortable? He won't make it.

1477
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:34,720
让重伤患排好队!给他吗啡  把他们带过去!
Line the critical up! Get him morphine. Take him over there!

1478
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:36,310
把烧伤病人带到树下
Burn victims by the tree!

1479
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:40,520
我刚发现她  好像已经死了
I just found her! I don't think she's breathing.

1480
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:43,190
她死了  把她
No, she's dead. Take her...

1481
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:47,600
噢  天啊
Oh, God.

1482
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:53,230
- 你确定吗?再检查一次  - 她已经死了
- Are you sure, Ev? Check her again. - She's dead.

1483
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:54,540
抱她过去
Take her over there!

1484
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:57,370
你一定要确定清楚
But you've gotta be sure!

1485
02:01:57,480 --> 02:01:59,280
她死了  快回去工作  桑得拉
She's dead! Go back to work, Sandra.

1486
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:02,650
我不知道该做什么
I don't know what to do!

1487
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:39,810
上将  华盛顿的电报
Admiral? From Washington.

1488
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:44,210
[日本人的攻击迫在眉睫]
"Attack by Japan considered imminent."

1489
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:50,250
他们只晚了一个小时
They're only an hour late.

1490
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:25,250
恭喜了


1491
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:32,590
我只怕这样做会唤醒了在沉睡中的巨人


1492
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:49,340
我们能做点儿什么?
How can we help?

1493
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:51,750
我们需要血  来吧
We need blood. Come on.

1494
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:59,650
孩子  你要保持信仰  记住耶稣基督的话
Remember, son, hold on to your faith.

1495
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:02,390
今日你将随我进天堂
Today you will be with me in paradise...

1496
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:05,360
不要恐惧  我的孩子
"so fear not." Fear not, my son.

1497
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:10,900
你受到祝福  将蒙主荣召
You are a man truly blessed. You will die in a state of grace.

1498
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:14,670
痛苦很短暂、荣耀是永恒的
Remember, pain is temporary, but glory is forever.

1499
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:20,470
坚信主耶稣基督  很快便将与上帝与天使同在
Hold on to your faith, my son. You'll be with God, the saints, and the angels soon.

1500
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:28,650
我赦免你犯下的过错  以圣父、圣子、圣灵之名
I absolve you of your sins... in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit.

1501
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,050
阿门
In nomine patris et fili, et spiritus sancti. Amen.

1502
02:05:36,930 --> 02:05:38,360
与上帝同在
Go with God, my son.

1503
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:47,040
我们的人都困在码头
We've got men trapped everywhere in the harbor.

1504
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,440
有力气搬得动东西的快来帮忙
We need help from anybody who can move.

1505
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:57,540
救我们出去
There's somebody in here!

1506
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:02,210
这儿有人  快派人下去
Get somebody down here! They're cutting through!

1507
02:06:10,770 --> 02:06:13,500
这儿也有人  快派人下去
I hear somebody! Get some guys uphere!

1508
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:15,630
用力拉
Pull!

1509
02:06:18,570 --> 02:06:21,020
快救我们出去!水快满了!
Get us out! It's filling with water!

1510
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:23,140
快拿输气管过来!
Get an airline in here!

1511
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:28,850
我们该怎么做?
What can we do?

1512
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:35,220
速度不能再快了
It won't cut any faster!

1513
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:39,890
快把它钊开
Cut him out! Aah!

1514
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:19,930
昨天  一九四一年十二月七日
Yesterday... December 7, 1941...

1515
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,430
将永远成为我们的国耻日
a date which will live in infamy...

1516
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:30,770
美利坚合众国遭到日本
the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked...

1517
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:35,310
海空军有预谋的突然袭击
by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.

1518
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:43,490
显然易见  这次袭击是经过长期精心策划的
It is obvious that planning the attack began many weeks ago.

1519
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:48,250
在此期间  日本政府
During the intervening time... the Japanese government...

1520
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:53,850
通过虚伪的声明和维护和平的宣传
has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements...

1521
02:07:54,350 --> 02:07:58,310
蓄意欺骗美国
and expressions of hope for continued peace.

1522
02:07:58,310 --> 02:08:03,770
昨天对夏威夷群岛的攻击
The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands...

1523
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:09,420
使美国军队遭受重创
has caused severe damage to American military forces.

1524
02:08:09,450 --> 02:08:16,220
我沉痛地告诉各位  有三千多美国人丧失了生命
I regret to tell you... that over 3,000 American lives have been lost.

1525
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:23,130
无论需要多长时间也要战胜  敌人预谋的侵略
No matter how long it may take us... to overcome this premeditated invasion...

1526
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:30,360
正义的美国人民  必将赢得彻底的胜利
the American people, in their righteous might... will win through to absolute victory.

1527
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:40,270
由于日本无故发动的卑鄙袭击
Because of this unprovoked, dastardly attack by Japan...

1528
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:44,320
我要求国会宣布进入战争状态
I ask that the Congress declare a state of war.

1529
02:08:49,950 --> 02:08:55,410
是不是还有士兵被困在亚里桑那号里
Is it true... men are still trapped alive inside the Arizona?

1530
02:08:57,530 --> 02:08:59,760
舰内传来敲打声
We can heartapping from inside the hull.

1531
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:02,960
我们正在尽力抢救  但他们被困在四十尺海底
We're doing everything we can to get to them... but they're forty feet below water.

1532
02:09:09,710 --> 02:09:12,110
美国人自以为所向无敌
We've been trained to think that we're invincible.

1533
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:16,140
可我们最值得骄傲的战舰
And now our proudest ships have been destroyed...

1534
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:20,150
却被我们藐视的敌人击沉了
by an enemy we considered inferior.

1535
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:26,520
我们被逼得无路可退  所以一定要马上反击
We're on the ropes, gentlemen. That's exactly why we have to strike back now.

1536
02:09:26,530 --> 02:09:29,360
我们准备攻击马绍尔和吉尔伯特群岛
We'll attack the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, sir.

1537
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:33,360
我的意思是要攻击日本的心脏  就象他们攻击我们一样
I mean hitting the heart of Japan the way they have hit us.

1538
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:40,610
总统先生  珍珠港遭袭击是缺乏准备造成的
Mr. President... Pearl Harbor caught us unawares because we didn't face facts.

1539
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:43,600
不过我们应该面对现实
This isn't a time for ignoring them again.

1540
02:09:43,710 --> 02:09:47,310
我们有远程轰炸机  但在日本附近没有基地
We have long- range bombers, but no place to launch them.

1541
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:52,420
中途岛离日本太远  苏联也不会帮助我们
Midway is too far, and Russia won't allow us... to launch a raid from there.

1542
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:54,720
海军上将?
Admiral?

1543
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:58,010
海军航空兵都是轻型飞机  载弹量低、航程短
Navy's planes are small. They carry light loads and have a short range.

1544
02:09:58,010 --> 02:10:01,200
只能够从距离日本几百英里的地方起飞才能够进行轰炸
We'd have to get them within a few hundred miles of Japan.

1545
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:04,850
这样的话  就必须动用航母  但是  如果我们失去航母
We'd risk our carriers, and if we lose our carriers...

1546
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:06,650
我们将丧失抵御入侵的能力
...we'll have no shield against invasion.

1547
02:10:06,670 --> 02:10:10,970
有人见过不流血的胜利吗?
Does anyone in this room think victory is possible without facing danger?

1548
02:10:11,070 --> 02:10:14,200
要进行战争  就必然有危险
We are at war. Of course there's a risk.

1549
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:18,940
但我们不能无视危险  总统先生  如果日本人继续进攻
But consider the risk, Mr. President. If the Japanese invade us right now...

1550
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:22,350
在我们能够挡住他们之前  他们可以打到芝加哥
they would reach Chicago before we could stop them.

1551
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:26,690
先生们
Gentlemen...

1552
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:33,460
在我双腿残疾之前  你们大多数人还不认识我
most of you did not know me when I had the use of my legs.

1553
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:37,050
那时  我强壮  充满自信
I was strong and proud... and arrogant.

1554
02:10:37,930 --> 02:10:44,500
现在我时时刻刻在问自己  为什么上帝让我做在轮椅上?
Now I wonder, every hour of my life... why God put me into this chair.

1555
02:10:44,610 --> 02:10:48,560
国民流露出失败的情绪
But when I see defeat in the eyes of my countrymen...

1556
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:50,870
而你们也是如此
in your eyes, right now...

1557
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:53,190
我开始认为上帝
I start to think that maybe he brought me down...

1558
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:54,850
就是让我来
for times like these...

1559
02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:57,270
提醒大家我们到底是谁
when we all need to be reminded who we truly are...

1560
02:10:57,270 --> 02:11:00,920
我们永不放弃  决不低头!
that we will not give up or give in.

1561
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:03,070
尊敬的总统先生  恕我直言
Mr. President, with all respect, sir...

1562
02:11:03,070 --> 02:11:04,580
您的要求是不可能办到的
what you're asking can't be done.

1563
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:21,910
总统先生
Mr. President!

1564
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:24,340
别扶我  乔治  别扶我
Get back, George! Get back.

1565
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:41,730
别再告诉我  没有什么是不可能!
Do not tell me... it can't be done.

1566
02:11:46,330 --> 02:11:50,570
日本继续在南太平洋炫耀武力
Japan continues its military conguest... throughout the Pacific.

1567
02:11:51,810 --> 02:11:55,720
在国内  美国的自愿者在加紧工作
But, backhome... millions of American workers band together...

1568
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:58,870
为雪十二月七日之耻 努力生产武器
bringing factories to life to avenge Pearl Harbor.

1569
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:06,210
总统先生  我们制定了轰炸东京的计划
Mr. President, we have an idea how to bomb the Japanese.

1570
02:12:07,290 --> 02:12:10,450
很危险  但很大胆
Sir, it's risky... but it's bold.

1571
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:13,320
你是谁?
Who are you?

1572
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:14,550
我吗?
I, sir?

1573
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:16,860
我是洛上校  总统先生
Captain Low, Mr. President.

1574
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:20,070
是他拟制的计划  它是潜艇舰长
He's a submariner. He came up with this idea.

1575
02:12:20,170 --> 02:12:22,500
我喜欢潜艇舰长
I like sub commanders.

1576
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:26,440
他们没时间讲废话  我也一样
They don't have time for bullshit, and neither do I.

1577
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:28,170
开始吧  先生们
Fire away, gentlemen.

1578
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:46,620
上帝啊!你在哪里?
And where is God in all this?

1579
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:53,400
我们的敌人认为神风在保护他们
Our enemies believe a divine wind protects them.

1580
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:56,940
可我们的朋友却在此长眠
But we see our friends laid out there before us.

1581
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:17,910
(西维吉尼亚号舰长)


1582
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:20,820
别了  舰长
Hey, Captain.

1583
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:46,110
雷夫・麦考利中尉、丹尼・沃克中尉
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley, Daniel Walker.

1584
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:47,150
是的  少校
Yes, Major?

1585
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:50,510
两小时后  你们回本土
You're both going stateside. Fly out in two hours.

1586
02:13:50,890 --> 02:13:51,860
什么事儿?长官
What for, sir?

1587
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:53,720
去问杜立特上校
Ask Colonel Doolittle.

1588
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:57,920
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1589
02:14:14,350 --> 02:14:15,480
你们要出发
You're packing.

1590
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,050
这是任务
Orders.

1591
02:14:21,190 --> 02:14:22,550
什么样的任务?
What kind of orders?

1592
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:25,750
最高机密
The top- secret kind.

1593
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:28,490
也是最危险的?
The dangerous kind.

1594
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:32,240
我没看见丹尼
I can't find Danny.

1595
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:33,930
那是你来这来的原因?
Is that why you're here?

1596
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,030
来找丹尼?
Looking for Danny?

1597
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:38,910
可能在和他的队友告别
Probably saying good- bye to his squadron.

1598
02:14:38,910 --> 02:14:40,170
我们现在归杜立特指挥
We've been assigned to Doolittle.

1599
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:51,810
我不是来找丹尼的
I wasn't looking for Danny.

1600
02:14:56,790 --> 02:15:00,650
有一件事儿  在你走之前我想你应该知道
I couldn't have you go away without you understanding something.

1601
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:07,960
是吗  你什么都不必解释
Yeah. You don't have to explain anything.

1602
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:11,700
我要  因为你以为我没有爱过你
I do, because you're acting like I didn't love you.

1603
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:15,570
伊芙琳  爱你使我活了下来
Evelyn, loving you kept me alive.

1604
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:28,180
不然  在英国我早就死了
I should've died over there.

1605
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:32,820
当我掉进海里的时候  我向上帝承诺
When I was in that water, I made a deal with God.

1606
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:36,260
我说我后悔极了
I told him I was sorry...

1607
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:39,560
为了当英雄  我离开了你
I told him that I knew I'd been a fool for leaving you

1608
02:15:39,560 --> 02:15:41,430
真是太傻了
trying to go over there and be a hero...

1609
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:44,870
我向上帝承诺  从今后我别无所求
and I promised I'd never ask for anything again...

1610
02:15:45,870 --> 02:15:48,800
只要我能够再见你一面
...if I could just see you one more time.

1611
02:15:52,350 --> 02:15:54,110
你知道吗?
And you know what?

1612
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:56,870
我觉得我值得这样做
It was worth it.

1613
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:02,180
伊芙琳  是你让我活了下来  是你把我带回了家
You kept me alive, Evelyn. You brought me home.

1614
02:16:03,490 --> 02:16:05,310
所以我要实现我的承诺
So I'm gonna stand by my end of the deal.

1615
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:10,150
我要走了  我对你别无所求
I'm gonna walk away. And I won't ask you for anything.

1616
02:16:10,930 --> 02:16:12,430
但是  我想知道为什么
But I just want to know why.

1617
02:16:12,730 --> 02:16:16,230
请告诉我  好吗?求你了  请告诉我
Just tell me that, will you, please? Just tell me why.

1618
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:19,670
雷夫  我怀孕了
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

1619
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,210
噢  老天
Oh, my God.

1620
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:37,550
我也是你回来那天才知道的
I didn't even know until the day you turned up alive.

1621
02:16:38,890 --> 02:16:44,290
后来就发生了这些事情  我没有告诉丹尼
And then all this happened. I haven't told Danny.

1622
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:46,950
我不想让他知道
I don't want him to know.

1623
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:50,160
他现在需要考虑的是
All he needs to think about is how to do

1624
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,410
如何完成任务活着回来
this mission and get back alive.

1625
02:16:55,580 --> 02:17:00,020
雷夫  我过去的全部心愿就是嫁给你
Rafe, all I ever wanted was for us to have a home,

1626
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:01,890
和你一起慢慢变老
grow old together...

1627
02:17:01,890 --> 02:17:04,850
老天却不让我如愿以偿
but life never asked me what I wanted.

1628
02:17:04,850 --> 02:17:07,820
现在我要全心全意地爱丹尼
Now, I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart...

1629
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,660
我曾经深深的爱着你
but I don't think I'll ever look at another

1630
02:17:12,660 --> 02:17:14,230
无时无刻想着你
sunset without thinking of you.

1631
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:20,600
你是我生命中的最爱
I'll love you my whole life.

1632
02:17:58,350 --> 02:17:59,710
飞机上见
I'll see you on board.

1633
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:20,980
知道吗  我唯一害怕的事情
You know, the only thing that scares me is

1634
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:24,430
就是你对他的感情胜过我
that you might love him more than you love me.

1635
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:28,500
我爱你  丹尼!
I love you, Danny.

1636
02:18:31,750 --> 02:18:34,370
我会在这等你  等你完成任务回来
And I'll be here waiting for you when you come back.

1637
02:18:52,430 --> 02:18:53,830
跟我来
Follow me.

1638
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:59,100
上校
Colonel.

1639
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:04,950
祝贺您晋升了  长官
Congratulations on your promotion, sir.

1640
02:19:05,350 --> 02:19:06,780
我听说你们的事情了
I heard what you did.

1641
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:08,440
我们可以解释清楚  长官
We can explain that, sir.

1642
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:10,140
解释什么?
Explain what?

1643
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:12,550
不管你听说到的什么  长官
Whatever it is you heard about us, sir.

1644
02:19:12,650 --> 02:19:14,850
你是指你们穿着花衬衫开飞机?
You mean the hula shirts you were flying in?

1645
02:19:20,430 --> 02:19:22,430
还是你们击落的七架敌机?
Or the seven planes you shot down?

1646
02:19:25,770 --> 02:19:28,050
你们都能够获得银星勋章
You're both being awarded the Silver Star...

1647
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:31,060
还要晋升上尉军衔
and promoted to captain.

1648
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:34,570
就是这些好消息吗?长官  或
Is that the good news, sir, or...

1649
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:36,640
在陆军飞行员之中
You're just about the only pilots in the Army

1650
02:19:36,640 --> 02:19:39,340
你们是唯一有实战经验的
with combat experience.

1651
02:19:39,450 --> 02:19:42,810
我需要你们完成一项任务
I need you for a mission I've been ordered to put together.

1652
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:46,110
你们知道什么事最绝密吗?
You know what top secret is?

1653
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:47,880
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1654
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:49,870
就是你能够获得勋章
It's the kind of mission where you get medals.

1655
02:19:49,870 --> 02:19:52,520
但是他们只能颁发给你的家属
But they send them to your relatives.

1656
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:55,610
最高绝密  就是说你们将为航空史
Top secret means you train for something

1657
02:19:55,610 --> 02:19:57,460
上绝无先例的任务接受训练
never done before in aviation history...

1658
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,560
甚至连去哪儿都不能知道
and you go without knowing where you're going.

1659
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:03,840
你们干还是不干
You do it on that basis or not at all.

1660
02:20:04,910 --> 02:20:05,840
我要去  长官
I'll go, sir.

1661
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:08,930
我也去  长官
I'll go, too, sir.

1662
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:13,690
另外  麦考利  英方送来了你的私人物品
By the way, the Brits sent over your personal effects.

1663
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:14,770
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

1664
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:17,640
还有一件事我要告诉你们
There's only one more thing I can tell you.

1665
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:19,990
把你们的花衬衫留在家里
Leave your goddamn hula shirts at home.

1666
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:24,810
亲爱的雷夫
Dear Rafe...

1667
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:27,280
没有你的日子我很不习惯
It's so strange to be this far from you...

1668
02:20:27,350 --> 02:20:31,440
但你应该每个这样的夜晚
but you should know this every night...

1669
02:20:40,830 --> 02:20:42,920
我到处找你
I've been looking all over for you.

1670
02:20:44,370 --> 02:20:46,090
丹尼  这
Danny, this...

1671
02:20:47,470 --> 02:20:49,600
现在这个时候我们最好开诚布公
this ain't no time to leave things unsaid.

1672
02:20:50,970 --> 02:20:52,910
我们要面对现实
Now, we got to face facts here.

1673
02:20:52,970 --> 02:20:56,210
现实就是  我们爱上同一个女人
The fact is, we just both love the same woman.

1674
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:07,140
你知道她是我爱上的第一个女孩  雷夫
You know she's the first girl I ever felt this way about, Rafe.

1675
02:21:09,390 --> 02:21:12,760
我情不自禁  就跟你一样
I couldn't help what happened any more than you could.

1676
02:21:16,930 --> 02:21:19,260
可是这次不一样  丹尼
This is different, though, Danny.

1677
02:21:19,330 --> 02:21:21,060
伊芙琳曾经失去过一次爱人
Evelyn already lost the man she loved once.

1678
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:23,070
我不想这样的事情再次发生在她身上
I just don't want it to see that happen to her again.

1679
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:26,270
我们没有选择  这是战争
Guys like us got no choice. This is war.

1680
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:27,860
她很清楚
She knows that.

1681
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:30,470
丹尼  别这样
Danny, don't do this.

1682
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:31,980
别参加这次任务
Don't go on this mission.

1683
02:21:33,210 --> 02:21:35,010
你不必证明什么
You got nothing to prove.

1684
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:38,950
你从小就在保护我
You've been protecting me since we were kids.

1685
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:42,020
对  没错
Yeah,well...

1686
02:21:42,090 --> 02:21:44,420
你这人是挺需要保护的
you do tend to need it from time to time.

1687
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:53,820
(一九四二年三月三日)


1688
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:06,490
我要求你们自愿参加的任务
The mission I'm asking you to volunteer for...

1689
02:22:06,490 --> 02:22:07,390
非常危险
is exceptionally dangerous.

1690
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:10,930
看看你身边的同伴
Take a look at the man beside you.

1691
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:14,400
很可能六个星期后
It's a good bet that in the next six weeks...

1692
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:18,440
你  或者是他已经牺牲了
you or he... will be dead.

1693
02:22:21,350 --> 02:22:26,750
有足够勇气的  向前一步
Everyone brave enough to accept this... step forward.

1694
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,930
你们的祖母可以驾驶 B- 25 在一英里的跑道上起飞
Your grandmother could take a B- 25 off... on a mile- long runway.

1695
02:22:39,730 --> 02:22:43,640
现在我要求你们在四百六十七英尺的跑道上起飞
Well, I'm gonna train you to do it in 467 feet.

1696
02:22:44,470 --> 02:22:49,140
因为超过了四百六十七英尺  你只有命丧黄泉
Because at 468 feet... you're dead.

1697
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:52,320
起飞后  要象驾驶战斗机一样
And once you get it up you'll learn to fly it like a fighter...

1698
02:22:53,650 --> 02:22:55,920
距离地面三十英尺飞行
...thirty feet off the ground.

1699
02:22:56,450 --> 02:22:59,150
这位是海军航空兵的杰克・理查兹上尉
I want you to say hello to Lieutenant Jack Richards, Navy Aviation.

1700
02:22:59,150 --> 02:23:02,050
他将帮我们为这些胖妞减减肥
He'll help us lighten these fat ladies.

1701
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,820
把那个箱子扔掉
Dump that ashcan. Dumpt hat ashcan.

1702
02:23:04,820 --> 02:23:06,720
看到瞄准镜了吗?卸掉
See that bomb sight? Get rid of it.

1703
02:23:06,830 --> 02:23:08,450
上校  他疯啦!
Colonel, he's crazy!

1704
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:09,620
这位女士太肥了
The lady's fat!

1705
02:23:09,730 --> 02:23:10,560
听他指挥
Listen to him.

1706
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:12,630
不要胖妞  我们要一位骨感美的美女
She's fat lady. We want a skinny lady!

1707
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:18,830
开足马力
Max power!

1708
02:23:22,210 --> 02:23:23,540
拉起来  拉起来!
Get up, get up!

1709
02:23:26,080 --> 02:23:26,980
见鬼!
Damn!

1710
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:36,790
他们超过了起飞线
They just keep rolling past that line.

1711
02:23:36,890 --> 02:23:38,050
也许是这个主意不好
Maybe it's a bad idea.

1712
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,820
不  还是太重  得动大手术
No, they're too heavy. We gotta get drastic.

1713
02:23:40,930 --> 02:23:42,720
这些防弹板
This armored plating goes.

1714
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:45,560
对  就是它  就像脱裙子一样卸掉  年轻人
I'm sure, I'm sure. Lose it like a skirt, son.

1715
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:46,690
松开刹车
Release brakes!

1716
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:50,760
快  快
Come on, come on!

1717
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:55,830
让所有人都站过来
Put every man on the line now!

1718
02:23:58,750 --> 02:24:01,380
我们告诉他们怎么飞
Let's show these boys how this thing is done!

1719
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:04,540
准备好!开足马力!
Come on! Max power.

1720
02:24:10,660 --> 02:24:12,520
看  如果他行
Well, if he can do it...

1721
02:24:20,270 --> 02:24:23,030
(一九四二年四月二日  大黄蜂号航空母舰)


1722
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:33,810
先生们  现在我可以告诉你们  我们要去东京
Well, gentlemen, now I can tell you... that we're going to Tokyo.

1723
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:36,970
去轰炸它
And we're gonna bomb it.

1724
02:24:42,490 --> 02:24:46,950
这是罗斯福总统直接特批的任务
That comes as a special request directly from President Roosevelt.

1725
02:24:47,060 --> 02:24:50,160
海军送我们到距日本本土四百海里的地方
The Navy'll sneak us about 400 miles off the Japanese coast...

1726
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:51,690
然后我们从航母上起飞
and we'll launch from the carrier there.

1727
02:24:51,730 --> 02:24:53,650
以前曾经这么干过吗?
Has that been done before?

1728
02:24:53,650 --> 02:24:56,100
陆军轰炸机从海军航母上起飞?
Taking Army bombers off Navy carriers?

1729
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:57,000
没有
No.

1730
02:24:58,140 --> 02:24:59,160
好吧
OK.

1731
02:24:59,270 --> 02:25:00,170
还有问题吗?
Any other questions?

1732
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:05,570
嗯  长官  B- 25 能在航母甲板上降落吗?
Well, sir, is it even possible to land a B- 25 on an aircraft carrier deck?

1733
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:07,270
不存在这个问题
That won't matter.

1734
02:25:07,380 --> 02:25:10,680
我们起飞后  航母马上返航回夏威夷
As soon as we're airborne, the carrier heads for Hawaii.

1735
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:12,950
没有航母  那我们在哪儿降落?
But without them, where do we land?

1736
02:25:13,050 --> 02:25:16,110
我要你们都学会用中文说一句话
I have a phrase I want you to memorize.

1737
02:25:17,290 --> 02:25:20,490
我是一个美国人
Wo shi yi ge mei guo ren.

1738
02:25:20,590 --> 02:25:24,220
意思是"我是一个美国人"
It means 'I am an American'.

1739
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:26,130
用中国话说
In Chinese.

1740
02:25:27,470 --> 02:25:30,360
这可不简单  甲板比我们训练的起飞距离
ain't gonna be any easier.

1741
02:25:30,360 --> 02:25:31,130
还短三英尺
That's three feet shorter than our practice runway.

1742
02:25:31,140 --> 02:25:32,200
两位
Fellas?

1743
02:25:32,310 --> 02:25:33,570
长官
Sir.

1744
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:39,700
这是海军部长给的
Secretary of the Navy gave me these.

1745
02:25:41,450 --> 02:25:42,310
什么东西?
What are they?

1746
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:44,180
日本人送的友谊勋章
Friendship medals the Japanese gave

1747
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:45,940
那时候他们还在大谈和平
us when they were pretending to want peace.

1748
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:47,380
我们拿它有什么用?
What'll you do with them?

1749
02:25:47,850 --> 02:25:50,080
系在炸弹上还给他们
Wire them to the bombs and give them back.

1750
02:25:54,190 --> 02:25:55,390
还有什么事?
So what's going on?

1751
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:57,490
长官  我们只有十六架轰炸机
Well, sir, we only have sixteen planes.

1752
02:25:58,130 --> 02:25:59,120
那又怎样?
So?

1753
02:25:59,230 --> 02:26:03,130
如果日本人反击  他们能够出动三百多架
When the Japs hit us, they had more than 300.

1754
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:04,570
力量对比太悬殊
How much difference can we make?

1755
02:26:04,670 --> 02:26:07,760
我们并不是害怕  我们可能会死
It's not that we're afraid, sir. But we might die,

1756
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:09,770
但我们想知道这是为什么
and we want to know what it's for.

1757
02:26:13,110 --> 02:26:15,550
在珍珠港  他们疯狂地袭击了我们
You know, at Pearl, they hit us with a sledgehammer.

1758
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:21,150
这次空袭  即使成功
This raid, even if we make it through...

1759
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:24,280
也微不足道
it'll only be a pinprick...

1760
02:26:24,390 --> 02:26:26,290
但我们这是在直接打击他们的心脏
but it'll be straight through their hearts.

1761
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:30,840
胜利属于那些信念坚定
Victory belongs to those that believe in it the most...

1762
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:32,750
永不动摇的人们
and believe in it the longest.

1763
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:38,870
我们坚信胜利  我们也要让美国人民坚信胜利
We're gonna believe. We're gonna make America believe, too.

1764
02:26:38,970 --> 02:26:41,200
上校  请来一下
Colonel? I need a minute.

1765
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,000
对不起  杰克森少校
Excuse me, Major Jackson?

1766
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:46,010
是
Yes?

1767
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:49,170
你还记得我吗?
Do you remember me?

1768
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:53,180
当然记得 我还没感谢你呢
Oh, sure I do. I'm sorry. I've been meaning to thank you.

1769
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:54,980
你的机会来了
Well, maybe you can.

1770
02:26:55,090 --> 02:26:57,190
我想去指挥所听听
When the news comes in about the Doolittle boys

1771
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:59,820
杜立特部下发回的消息
I want to be in the command post.

1772
02:27:00,890 --> 02:27:03,760
抱歉  我不知道你在说什么
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.

1773
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:07,930
你怎么知道这项任务?
How the hell do you know about this mission?

1774
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:11,070
算是不慎泄漏吧
Let's call it an inadvertent disclosure.

1775
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:13,500
是某个和你约会的飞行员说的?
Some flyboy you're dating shot his mouth off.

1776
02:27:15,010 --> 02:27:17,620
实际上  是两名飞行员
Actually, it's about two pilots.

1777
02:27:17,620 --> 02:27:20,040
我知道他们面对巨大的危险
I know they're going into great danger.

1778
02:27:20,150 --> 02:27:22,020
我只想在那儿亲耳听到
I just want to be there

1779
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:23,740
他们生还或是牺牲的消息
when the news tells us if they've lived or died.

1780
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:30,450
要是其他军官早就把你扔进监狱了
Most officers would have thrown you in the brig.

1781
02:27:30,490 --> 02:27:32,290
要是别的护士早就顾不上你
Most nurses wouldn't keep their fingers plugged

1782
02:27:32,290 --> 02:27:34,550
没时间用手按住你流血的动脉
in your artery.

1783
02:27:40,370 --> 02:27:42,460
我不能保证什么
I can't promise you anything.

1784
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:50,000
嘿  雷德
Hey, Red,

1785
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:54,550
你以为他们选中我们是因为我们年轻  好说话吗?
you think they pickedus to do this bcause we're young and dumb?

1786
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:58,150
拜托  古斯  因为我们是精英
Come on, Gooz, we're the tip of the sword.

1787
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:05,660
(为了贝蒂)


1788
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:19,860
为了我们的日本之行  我搞到一些胜利雪茄
In honor of our trip to Japan... I got us some victory cigars!

1789
02:28:21,510 --> 02:28:24,530
拿去吧  放在靠近心脏的步袋里
There you go. Put that in your inside pocket, next to your heart.

1790
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:27,610
知道吗  杰克  这一仗可能会失败
You know, Jack, we may lose this battle...

1791
02:28:27,610 --> 02:28:29,680
但我们一定能赢得这场战争
but we're gonna win this war.

1792
02:28:29,780 --> 02:28:30,980
你明白我的意思吗?
You know how I know?

1793
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:32,520
不知道
No.

1794
02:28:34,150 --> 02:28:37,650
他们  因为他们的杰出贡献
Them. bcause they're rare.

1795
02:28:39,250 --> 02:28:44,690
因为他们在这种关键时刻  自愿挺身而出
And at times like these, you see them... stepping forward.

1796
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:50,190
自愿者的意志无坚不摧  杰克
There's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer, Jack.

1797
02:28:55,070 --> 02:28:59,030
我在作战部的朋友不想让我指挥这次空袭
My friends in the war department don't want me to lead this raid...

1798
02:28:59,150 --> 02:29:01,270
他们说我太宝贵了
because they say I'm too valuable.

1799
02:29:02,380 --> 02:29:04,600
他们不希望我跟我挑选的
They don't want me up in the air flying with the men

1800
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:06,220
飞行员一起出任务
that I've chosen...

1801
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:09,550
可他们是我挑选的  是我训练和逼出来的
that I've chewed out, cussed out, pushed to the limit...

1802
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:14,450
我很尊重这些飞行员
and that I've come to respect.

1803
02:29:17,250 --> 02:29:19,930
他们想让我在甲板上发号施令
They want me to stand on the flightdeck and wave you off.

1804
02:29:19,930 --> 02:29:21,800
但我不想那样做
Well, I don't see it that way.

1805
02:29:23,740 --> 02:29:24,990
我要跟你们一起去
So I'm going with you.

1806
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:33,950
我们明天下午起飞  轰炸完毕后去中国
We take off tomorrow afternoon... drop our fire, and head for China.

1807
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:38,380
我们的任务是轰炸他们的军事目标  飞机工厂和坦克工厂
Our mission is to hit military targets... aircraft and tank factories.

1808
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:41,820
上校  你说我们有返航引导信号
Colonel, you've given us homing beacons...

1809
02:29:41,820 --> 02:29:44,590
但你又说  中国到处是日本军队
but you said China is overrun with Japanese troops.

1810
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:46,620
如果信号中断  怎么办?
What if the beacons are switched off?

1811
02:29:46,730 --> 02:29:49,660
那就紧急迫降并尽量避免被日本人抓住
Bring her down any way you can...and do your best to avoid capture.

1812
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:52,930
如果必须在日本人的上空跳伞  我们该怎么办?
What if we have to bail out over Japan?

1813
02:29:53,030 --> 02:29:57,160
这种情况  我无可奉告
Well, in that situation, I can't tell you what to do.

1814
02:29:57,630 --> 02:29:58,930
你会怎么做  上校?
What would you do, Colonel?

1815
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:05,300
我天生不会做俘虏
I wasn't built to be a prisoner...

1816
02:30:07,310 --> 02:30:10,070
所以我会先让机组跳伞
so I would have my crew bail out.

1817
02:30:10,710 --> 02:30:13,910
然后选择一个重要的军事目标驾机
I'd find the sweetest military target

1818
02:30:13,910 --> 02:30:15,840
与敌人同归于尽
I could and drive my plane right smack into the middle of it

1819
02:30:21,740 --> 02:30:23,270
但这仅限于我
But that's just me.

1820
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:28,790
我是四十五岁的老家伙
I'm forty- five years old. I'm an old man.

1821
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:31,710
而你们还有很长的路要走
You guys have your whole lives ahead of you...

1822
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:33,850
一切由你们自己决定
so what you do is up to you.

1823
02:30:41,230 --> 02:30:42,820
再有几个小时就要开始行动了
The mission will launch in a couple of hours.

1824
02:30:42,930 --> 02:30:44,400
一九四二年四月十八日


1825
02:30:44,470 --> 02:30:46,130
你就待在这
You'll stay right in here.

1826
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:50,110
这  待在这儿
Here. Stay here.

1827
02:30:50,310 --> 02:30:53,330
别和她们说话  她们也没空理你的
Don't talk to them. They won't talk to you.

1828
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:56,570
假装打我们发给你的信息  就这样
Pretend to type the information we pass you. That's it.

1829
02:30:58,450 --> 02:31:01,850
这儿是东京广播电台 孤儿安妮开始播音
This is Orphan Annie from Radio Tokyo.

1830
02:31:01,950 --> 02:31:04,680
南太平洋上孤独的小伙子们
To all the lonely boys in the South Pacific...

1831
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:06,980
小心  敌人会找上你
watch out... the enemy will get you.

1832
02:31:07,090 --> 02:31:08,560
也许她说的对
Maybe she's right.

1833
02:31:13,330 --> 02:31:16,630
日本人在发报!
Japs transmitting!

1834
02:31:16,730 --> 02:31:20,430
舰长  雷达发现距离四百码处有日本巡逻艇
Captain, radar reports Japanese patrol boats. Range 400 yards.

1835
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:22,700
多远? 四百码  正在靠近  长官
How many yards? 400 yards and closing, sir.

1836
02:31:22,810 --> 02:31:25,500
理查兹  快  日军逼近  快走
Richards, Japs! 400 yards! Let's go!

1837
02:31:25,610 --> 02:31:28,580
哈尔西将军命令巡洋舰开火
Admiral Halsey's ordering the cruisers to open fire!

1838
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:31,610
日本巡逻艇可能会报告我们的位置
We gotta sink these Jap boats before they give us away.

1839
02:31:31,710 --> 02:31:32,740
全体人员就位
Go to general quarters!

1840
02:31:32,850 --> 02:31:35,280
快  快
Go, go, go, go!

1841
02:31:36,350 --> 02:31:37,550
我的天
Oh, my God.

1842
02:31:39,390 --> 02:31:40,690
情况不妙
This can't be good!

1843
02:31:46,730 --> 02:31:50,190
日本人距离一海里  正在报告我们的位置
Japs one mile away. They reported our position.

1844
02:31:50,300 --> 02:31:52,890
预定起飞点在四百海里处  现在还有多远
Supposed to launch 400 miles away. How far are we now?

1845
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:54,660
还有六百二十四海里
624 miles.

1846
02:31:54,770 --> 02:31:56,970
老天!你要怎么办?
Jesus! What do you want to do?

1847
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:03,560
我不知道  上校
I don't know, Colonel,

1848
02:32:03,560 --> 02:32:06,140
我不知道我们的燃料能否飞到中国
I don't know if the planes can carry enough fuel to make it to China.

1849
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:08,950
我们现在起飞
Now. We launch now!

1850
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:14,620
陆军飞行员  立即就位!
Army pilots! Man your planes! Man your planes!

1851
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:18,450
他们已经开火了!
They're shooting at something.

1852
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:20,790
这不是演习  快走!
Let's go! It ain't a drill!

1853
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:36,280
上校!距离太远飞机飞不过去!
Colonel! We're too far out to make it!

1854
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:38,590
他们需要加更多的油  但油多了飞机又太重  起飞有困难
They need more fuel, but they can't get too heavy!

1855
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:42,410
听着!卸下所有能卸的东西!马上去办!
Listen! Strip everything out of this plane you don't need now!

1856

You want off this deck, give me a gun now! It's still too heavy!

是啊  能吓死日本人

不紧张  长官  是有点

什么时候开始信教了?

02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:24,050
在你选中我的时候  长官

帮我个忙

02:36:28,040 --> 02:36:32,070
让他们对空中堡垒的勇士们说吧

1905
02:36:32,180 --> 02:36:35,010
让他们对海军陆战队的官兵说吧
Let them tell that to the Marines.

1906
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:39,650
日本就在前面  伙计们  保持队形
That's Japan, fellas. Tighten up back there!

1907
02:36:40,190 --> 02:36:41,590
准备战斗
Man your guns!

1908
02:36:42,490 --> 02:36:44,250
我们到敌人的老家了
We're in the enemy's backyard!

1909

准备就绪  我看到了海岸线
Look alive back there. I see coastline.

1910
02:36:55,470 --> 02:36:57,060
提高警戒!小伙子们  提高警戒!
Heads up, boys! Heads up!

1911
02:37:02,310 --> 02:37:03,640
一切准备完毕!
Man your guns back there.

1912
02:37:03,750 --> 02:37:05,510
机关枪上膛
I'm cocked and locked!

1913
02:37:05,610 --> 02:37:07,340
狗日的  等着挨炸吧

三十七度!目标进入视野
37 degrees! Target in sight!

1917
02:37:34,710 --> 02:37:36,910
好了  小伙子们  让他们也尝尝挨炸的滋味!
All right, boys, let's knock their clocks off!

1918
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:38,070
投弹!
Drop your ordnance!

1919
02:37:38,380 --> 02:37:39,900
投下炸弹!投下第一枚
Bombs away! One away!

1920
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:43,170
投弹
Bombs away! Bombs away!

1921
02:37:43,290 --> 02:37:44,840
第二枚
Two away!

1922
02:37:53,930 --> 02:37:56,020
第三枚  第四枚

我们让他们也吃一惊!投弹!

1924
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:05,040
连续投弹

1925
02:38:05,140 --> 02:38:07,170
命中兵工厂

02:38:13,750 --> 02:38:16,810
我们成功了!我们命中目标!干得好!
We got it! We hit our targets! Good job, raiders!

1927
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:36,540
到处都是敌人的高射炮火!
We got flak everywhere!

1928
02:38:38,910 --> 02:38:40,340
怎么回事?
Go down there and get Gooz!

1929
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:42,740
我命令大家立即分散
I want everyone to separate!

1930
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:45,370
- 赶快调整频率  - 是  长官  - 赶快调整频率!
- Clean that up! - Yes, sir. - Try and clean that up!

1931
02:38:58,890 --> 02:39:00,950
高射炮正在向我们射击!我们得快脱身  古斯!
They're shooting flak at us! We gotta get out of this shit, Gooz!

1932
02:39:04,030 --> 02:39:07,300
起火了
We got a fire!

1933
02:39:07,400 --> 02:39:10,930
机尾被击中!电器系统着火了!
Tail's hit! The electrics! We got a fire backhere!

1934
02:39:10,930 --> 02:39:12,740
我马上就把它扑灭
I gotta short this out!

1935
02:39:12,740 --> 02:39:15,440
飞进云层  丹尼!快!
Get into the clouds, Danny, right now!

1936
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:31,080
可恶
God damn!

1937
02:39:32,430 --> 02:39:33,830
雷德  快去检查一下!
Red, go check that out!

1938
02:39:39,630 --> 02:39:41,000
到处都是炮火
We're getting covered!

1939
02:39:41,100 --> 02:39:42,540
希望螺旋桨别被打中!
Just hope they don't hit a prop!

1940
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:48,670
我受伤了!
I'm hit!

1941
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:50,340
飞机要被打烂了
They're tearing this plane apart!

1942
02:39:51,980 --> 02:39:54,410
雷德  快拉高到八百英尺
Red, take it up, 800 feet.

1943
02:39:58,290 --> 02:40:00,050
西欧好像死了
I think Theo's dead!

1944
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:03,060
西欧  快醒醒  西欧
Theo, wake up! Theo!

1945
02:40:03,930 --> 02:40:06,690
快飞进云层  丹尼  要快!飞进云层!
Get into the clouds, Danny, right now! Get up in that soup!

1946
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:08,920
马上离开这里  古斯
We're gonna pull out of this, Gooz!

1947
02:40:22,540 --> 02:40:23,310
谢谢你  乔治
Thank you, George.

1948
02:40:28,820 --> 02:40:29,780
有消息吗?将军
What is it, General?

1949
02:40:30,090 --> 02:40:31,670
杜立特上校不得不
Colonel Doolittle had to advance his

1950
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:33,460
提前十二个小时起飞
execution order by twelve hours,

1951
02:40:33,460 --> 02:40:34,650
总统先生
Mr. President.

1952
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:36,970
没有引导信号了
There will be no homing beacons.

1953
02:40:36,970 --> 02:40:38,950
导航机在中国坠毁
The plane carrying them crashed en route to China...

1954
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:42,460
我们的轰炸机燃油不足  他们飞不到中国大陆
and our bombers may lack the fuel to reach the mainland, sir.

1955
02:40:43,130 --> 02:40:49,130
那他们等于是瞎了眼睛  空着油箱在飞行
So our boys are flying blind on empty tanks.

1956
02:40:50,070 --> 02:40:51,370
上帝保佑他们
God help them.

1957
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:01,310
还是没收到信号
We're still not getting a signal.

1958
02:41:02,780 --> 02:41:07,050
一片汪洋  看不见有陆地  也没有信号
All ocean and no land. Homing in on nothing.

1959
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:11,280
我们还剩几桶油?
How many cans of fuel we got left?

1960
02:41:11,390 --> 02:41:13,090
这些都空了
These are all empty!

1961
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:15,890
只剩这桶吗?
Is this all you got?

1962
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:17,760
对  只有这点了  雷德
That's all we got, Red.

1963
02:41:17,870 --> 02:41:21,430
雷夫  你最好祈祷陆地快些出现吧
Rafe! You better pray for land!

1964
02:41:26,140 --> 02:41:27,670
恢复无线电通话
Break radio silence.

1965
02:41:29,380 --> 02:41:32,110
很抱歉  先生
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1966
02:41:32,210 --> 02:41:34,620
你们非常勇敢
You're all brave souls.

1967
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:38,250
是我见过的最英勇的飞行员
The bravest I've ever had the privilege of flying with.

1968
02:41:38,450 --> 02:41:40,250
但现在我们只能靠自己了
But we're on our own.

1969
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:47,520
这真是一项自杀型的任务
This really was a suicide mission.

1970
02:42:02,980 --> 02:42:04,770
注意  一号引擎出现问题
Engine one's fluctuating.

1971
02:42:04,780 --> 02:42:06,770
它随时都会熄火
We'll lose it any minute.

1972
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:09,220
雷夫  快给引擎加油
Rafe, you gotta prime it.

1973
02:42:09,220 --> 02:42:10,910
我正在加! 现在怎么样?
I am. How about now?

1974
02:42:15,020 --> 02:42:17,890
我看见海岸了  看见海岸了!
I see the coast. I see the coast!

1975
02:42:19,090 --> 02:42:20,690
收到  雷夫
Copy that, Rafe.

1976
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:22,420
我们准备着陆
We're gonna make it.

1977
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:24,290
丹尼  跟着我  我们要成功了
Danny, follow me. We can make this.

1978
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:26,160
陆地就在前面  只有几英里远
I can see the coast now. We're only a few miles out.

1979
02:42:26,270 --> 02:42:27,170
跟着我
Follow me.

1980
02:42:27,270 --> 02:42:29,900
我们要找个土质松软的地方着陆
We gotta find a soft landing spot.

1981
02:42:30,310 --> 02:42:31,640
二号引擎加速
I'm pushing up on two.

1982
02:42:31,740 --> 02:42:34,070
我们马上迫降
Hold on for a hard landing!

1983
02:42:34,180 --> 02:42:37,140
我看到一片稻田  我们就迫降在那
I see rice paddies. We'll bring it in right here.

1984
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:41,610
噢  天啊  一号引擎熄火了
Oh, God, engine one's dead.

1985
02:42:41,720 --> 02:42:44,010
二号引擎马上也要熄火了
We'll lose engine two any second.

1986
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:49,680
我们可以迫降了  放松
We can make it in. Easy.

1987
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:52,460
注意减速  不用油  我们滑翔着陆
Pull it back, glide in on fumes.

1988
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:58,600
日本鬼子  着陆点有日本巡逻队
Japs! We got Jap patrols all over the place!

1989
02:42:58,700 --> 02:43:03,800
丹尼  到别处降落  坐好了  这会很颠簸
Land somewhere else! Strap yourselves in! We're coming in hard!

1990
02:43:03,910 --> 02:43:05,430
我们死定了
We're a deadstick.

1991
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:07,030
离开机头
Get outta the nose!

1992
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:10,070
抓紧了  伙计们!我们开始着陆了!
Hold on, boys! We're going down!

1993
02:43:12,750 --> 02:43:14,010
小心树枝!
Watch the trees!

1994
02:43:38,610 --> 02:43:40,160
有人受伤吗?
Everyone all right?

1995
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:44,340
我没事儿
I'm OK! I'm OK!

1996
02:43:44,450 --> 02:43:45,850
瑞普利呢?
Where's Ripley?

1997
02:43:46,820 --> 02:43:47,910
他已死了
He's dead.

1998
02:43:49,520 --> 02:43:50,850
注意日本鬼子
Watch for Japs!

1999
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:01,150
日本巡逻队!
Jap patrols!

2000
02:44:01,260 --> 02:44:02,420
快找掩体
Take cover!

2001
02:44:20,220 --> 02:44:22,120
- 谁还有备用弹匣?  - 我有
- Who's got magazines?  - Got em!

2002
02:44:22,220 --> 02:44:25,880
我们要去那边山里找中国人
Gotta get up into those hills, find the Chinese!

2003
02:44:30,390 --> 02:44:31,650
我们受到火力压制!
They got us pinned down!

2004
02:44:42,600 --> 02:44:45,810
丹尼!雷夫!不!
Danny! Rafe! Rafe, no!

2005
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:48,010
- 丹尼!  - 雷夫  没有救了!
- Danny! - Rafe, you don't have a chance!

2006
02:44:52,550 --> 02:44:55,980
天啊  丹尼  快呀
God damn. Danny! Come on!

2007
02:45:01,490 --> 02:45:02,650
丹尼!
Danny!

2008
02:45:04,330 --> 02:45:05,450
噢  妈的  安东尼死了
Aw, shit, Anthony.

2009
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:09,360
古斯  你听到吗?
Gooz! Can you hear me?

2010
02:45:09,460 --> 02:45:10,990
醒醒
Yeah. Come on.

2011
02:45:12,330 --> 02:45:14,560
丹尼  放松  放松点
Danny. Easy, easy, easy.

2012
02:45:14,670 --> 02:45:15,860
我这次搞砸了
I've had better landings.

2013
02:45:15,970 --> 02:45:17,560
你救了我们
You saved us back there.

2014
02:45:17,670 --> 02:45:19,140
我脖子受伤了
I got something in my neck.

2015
02:45:19,240 --> 02:45:21,210
- 我帮你拔出来  - 古斯在哪儿?

2017
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:44,150

2020
02:46:54,940 --> 02:46:56,130
丹尼
Danny.

2021
02:46:57,310 --> 02:46:58,640
丹尼

2022
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:04,980
撑着点  我来了
Hold on! Rafe! Hold on, now. I got you.

2023
02:47:04,980 --> 02:47:07,080
你不会有事的
You're all right. You're all right.

2024
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:11,270
我  我不行了
I'm not gonna make it.

2025
02:47:15,720 --> 02:47:18,350
你不会死的  看着我  丹尼
Oh, yes, you are. Yes, you are. Now look at me.

2026
02:47:18,890 --> 02:47:23,760
雷夫  我好冷  冷极了!
Rafe, I'm so cold. I'm so cold.

2027
02:47:23,870 --> 02:47:26,100
你不会有事
You're all right. Hey.

2028
02:47:30,810 --> 02:47:35,770
- 雷夫  帮我一个忙  - 什么?
- Hey, Rafe? Can you do me a favor? - What?

2029
02:47:35,880 --> 02:47:39,400
你要找别人替我写墓志铭
Can you have someone else write my name on the tombstone?

2030
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,800
你不会死  听我说!
You're not gonna die. Look at me,

2031
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:45,520
你不会死的  你听见了吗?
listen to me! You ain't gonna die, you hear me?

2032
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:50,520
丹尼  你不能死  你知道为什么吗?
Danny. Danny, you can't die. You can't die. You know why?

2033
02:47:50,630 --> 02:47:52,350
因为你要当爸爸了
Bcause you're gonna be a father.

2034
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,330
你快当爸爸了  我本来不该告诉你
You're gonna be a daddy. I wasn't supposed to tell you.

2035
02:47:59,330 --> 02:48:01,670
你要当爸爸了
You're gonna be a father.

2036
02:48:03,170 --> 02:48:04,730
求求你
Please.

2037
02:48:09,010 --> 02:48:10,940
不  你才是
No. You are.

2038
02:48:20,690 --> 02:48:21,680
丹尼
Danny.

2039
02:48:24,300 --> 02:48:31,500
别死啊  丹尼
Danny? Danny? Please, please!

2040
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:39,000
上帝啊  丹尼
Please. God. Please, Danny.

2041
02:48:50,350 --> 02:48:53,480
别开枪  他们是中国人
Hold your fire! They're Chinese.

2042
02:50:14,500 --> 02:50:18,330
这次行动结束后回首往事
When the action is over and we look back...

2043
02:50:18,330 --> 02:50:20,570
我们感触颇深
we understand both more and less.

2044
02:50:20,780 --> 02:50:22,900
有一点是不容置疑的：
This much is certain.

2045
02:50:23,010 --> 02:50:27,040
在杜立特轰炸之前  美国人充满了失败的情绪
Before the Doolittle raid... America knew nothing but defeat.

2046
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:30,580
可在此之后  大家都振奋起来
After it, nothing but victory.

2047
02:50:30,690 --> 02:50:33,300
日本也首次意识到失败的可能
Japan realized for the first time that

2048
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:35,120
并开始小心起来
they could lose and began to pull back.

2049
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:36,990
我们看到了胜机而加紧步伐
America realized that she would win...

2050
02:50:36,990 --> 02:50:39,220
他们终将获胜并开始步步进逼
and surged forward.

2051
02:50:39,330 --> 02:50:42,390
这场战争改变了我们和世界
It was a war that changed America and world.

2052
02:50:42,470 --> 02:50:44,470
多利・米勒是第一名
Dorie Miller was the first black American to

2053
02:50:44,470 --> 02:50:46,920
获得海军十字勋章的黑人
be awarded the Navy Cross.

2054
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,730
但获得勋章的不止他一人
But he would not be the last.

2055
02:50:49,730 --> 02:50:52,040
他只是英雄群体中的一员
He joined a brotherhood of heroes.

2056
02:50:59,550 --> 02:51:01,540
所有参与轰炸的机员同样受勋
That's for all the raiders.

2057
02:51:11,630 --> 02:51:14,820
对我们来说  二战始于珍珠港
World War II for us began at Pearl Harbor...

2058
02:51:15,230 --> 02:51:20,130
一千一百七十七名官兵  至今仍长眠在亚利桑那号战舰中
and 1,177 men still lie entombed in the battleship Arizona.

2059
02:51:21,640 --> 02:51:25,440
我们受到的挫折  使我们变得坚强
America suffered... but America grew stronger.

2060
02:51:26,110 --> 02:51:28,100
但这不是必然的结果
It was not inevitable.

2061
02:51:28,340 --> 02:51:34,340
危机考验了我们  通过考验我们克服了困难
The times tried our souls and through the trial, we overcame.

2062
02:51:55,170 --> 02:51:58,160
嗨!小丹尼  你想飞吗?
Hey, Danny... how'd you like to go flying?

2063
02:52:00,410 --> 02:52:01,840
到这来
Come here.

2064
02:53:00,920 --> 02:53:06,040
There You'll Be
影片《珍珠港》主题曲

2065
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:09,360
当我想起从前 还有
When I think back

2066
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:11,890
当我想起从前 还有
On these times，And

2067
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:12,980
那些我们没有完成的梦想
the dreams

2068
02:53:12,980 --> 02:53:15,580
那些我们没有完成的梦想
We left behind

2069
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:17,590
我很高兴因为在我的生命中
I'll be glad 'cause

2070
02:53:17,590 --> 02:53:19,300
我很高兴因为在我的生命中
I was blessed to

2071
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:22,440
有你是多么幸运
get，To have you in my life

2072
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:24,130
当我回忆过去
When I look back

2073
02:53:24,130 --> 02:53:25,950
当我回忆过去
On these days

2074
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:30,290
眼前就会浮现你的脸庞
I'll look and see your face

2075
02:53:31,100 --> 02:53:34,300
你总会在那守候着我
You were right there for me

2076
02:53:38,300 --> 02:53:39,290
在我的梦里
In my dreams

2077
02:53:39,290 --> 02:53:41,650
我总是看见你架着飞机直冲云霄
I'll always see you soar

2078
02:53:41,650 --> 02:53:44,890
我总是看见你架着飞机直冲云霄
Above the sky

2079
02:53:45,630 --> 02:53:46,890

你让我知道
Well you showed me

2089
02:54:17,250 --> 02:54:18,660
你让我知道

02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:20,840
触摸到头顶的天空是什么感觉
To feel the sky
