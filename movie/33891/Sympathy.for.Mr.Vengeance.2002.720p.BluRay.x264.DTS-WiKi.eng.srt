1
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:34,194
I'm a good person
I'm a hard worker

2
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,362
My older sister is
the only family I have

3
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:39,737
To put me through
art school

4
00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:43,369
she gave up college
and got a job at a factory

5
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:48,449
But then she fell seriously
ill and had to quit

6
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:52,486
So I gave up art school
and got a job

7
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:57,489
But recently
I made a decision

8
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:02,363
I'm not sure whether
to tell my sister or not

9
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:06,026
I'm hesitating even
as I write this letter

10
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:10,198
If I decide to do it

11
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:13,206
I'll be listening to the
broadcast with my sister

12
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,668
I can't speak with my mouth

13
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:25,713
I'm deaf and dumb

14
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:34,894
Please read this letter to my
sister for me, since I can't

15
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,158
Sis, you're listening?

16
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:43,472
You told me if you die
you want to be buried by

17
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,473
the river where
we used to play

18
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:48,771
All right
I'll do that

19
00:01:48,878 --> 00:01:53,144
But that'll be in
40 or 50 years' time

20
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:58,948
I'm going to save you
Really, I swear

21
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:05,151
Actually, I registered to
donate my kidney today

22
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:07,725
I know you
said not to that you'd rather die

23
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:10,732
that you'd rather die
than be a burden

24
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,232
But you know I never
do what I'm told

25
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:30,810
Not A type

26
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:34,914
if the blood types
don't match

27
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:41,328
then we can't do
a transplant

28
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:47,461
You haven't had test
since school, have you?

29
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:54,669
If you can't pay
take her home for now

30
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,471
Until we find
a suitable donor

31
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:03,840
just keep coming
in for dialysis

32
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:05,780
ok?

33
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:30,538
It's type B, B

34
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,135
Our new house
is an old house

35
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:40,078
The estate thought
it'd be OK for I'm deaf

36
00:09:55,163 --> 00:10:00,100
If sister can't sleep
then neither can I

37
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:11,776
Aw, fucking great!

38
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,036
I heard that

39
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:20,002
this happened
in Australia

40
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:27,775
A man...

41
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:34,982
thought he had
two heads

42
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:43,463
Two heads?

43
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:45,762
Yeah, two

44
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,262
And

45
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:52,602
he kept getting
headaches

46
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,743
With two heads

47
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:59,302
he had headaches
all the time

48
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:03,776
So you know
what he did?

49
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:17,063
He shot
one of his heads

50
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,706
The left
or the right?

51
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:37,310
Aren't you
going to lunch?

52
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,405
Come on

53
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:43,544
Let's go eat something

54
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:56,278
You've only got 10 million won?

55
00:16:57,352 --> 00:17:01,652
Well, first of all

56
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,622
give us your kidney
then we'll do it

57
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:10,763
You give us
yours and we'll

58
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:12,832
get you one
for your sister

59
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:14,969
For 1 0 million won
Got it?

60
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:23,209
Understand me?

61
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:57,310
Your blood type's B
right?

62
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,253
21 days later
Congratulations

63
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,762
Finding a donor
this fast is

64
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,866
simply a miracle

65
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:41,133
The surgery's in a week

66
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:45,268
so have her
admitted in 5 days

67
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,009
You said you had
1 0 million won, right?

68
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:57,555
So all your
problems are solved

69
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,059
Isn't it great?

70
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:15,664
You idiot
you stupid fuck!

71
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:23,538
That money would've
saved your sister

72
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,596
Why not?

73
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,190
not the time to
be thinking that way

74
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,566
There's a saying

75
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:49,602
Is a boiled pig afraid
of boiling water?

76
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,302
Besides

77
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,211
What are you going to do?
You've only got a week

78
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,215
You know how long

79
00:21:57,283 --> 00:22:00,377
it'll take to find
another donor?

80
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,259
Is that her?

81
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,997
She's cute

82
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,004
Must be a friend

83
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,014
That's the bastard
who fired you?

84
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:44,252
That car's worth
10 years of your salary

85
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,762
That's why we
need a revolution

86
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,960
So sick people will
get free treatment

87
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,697
The time must come

88
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,501
when you can get any

89
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,735
damned organ you need!

90
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,580
The bad image

91
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,750
they get is cause
kids keep getting killed

92
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,686
But we're different

93
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,656
Give us money, we'll
return the kid pronto

94
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,728
I'm afraid
She won't want to go home

95
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:22,460
She'll be playing
with us all the time

96
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,626
Won't have
to go to school

97
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,242
What? What?

98
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,815
It's summer vacation

99
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:58,328
But think about it from
parents' point of view

100
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,202
They'll be so happy
to see her again

101
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,607
They'll love her more
and the family will be closer

102
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:10,611
we'll ask for
exactly 26 million won

103
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,718
How conscientious is
that right?

104
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:19,287
That money's nothing
to them

105
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,259
but for us it's a
matter of life and death

106
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,354
Movement of capital
maximizes the value of money

107
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,559
it's not a crime
don't you think?

108
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,875
There are

109
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,446
good kidnappings
and bad kidnappings

110
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,558
Good kidnapping enlists
the parents' cooperation

111
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:03,061
If they call the
police, the kid dies

112
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,563
The parents pay up

113
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,333
and the kid gets returned

114
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,974
Then nobody finds
out about it

115
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,810
People think all
kidnappings are bad

116
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,136
Daddy!

117
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:44,834
What?

118
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,777
Can I go play
at Yoosun's house?

119
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,678
No

120
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,047
Then will you buy me a
cell phone like Yoosun's?

121
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:59,190
Why do you buy
her stuff like that?

122
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,591
Have consideration
for your neighbors

123
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,507
Peng!

124
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,074
President Park!

125
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:27,516
Sir
please help me!

126
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,613
My wife ran off and
my kids are starving

127
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,827
In six years I never
missed a day of work

128
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:41,261
You know the percentage
of faulty goods was 0.008%

129
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,164
0.008%

130
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,963
Peng
what are you doing?

131
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,264
I explained it
to you already

132
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,781
Your employee?

133
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:35,547
I gave away my youth
to Ilshin Electronics

134
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,095
-Are you OK?
-Daddy!

135
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,365
It's not going to work

136
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,731
Why?

137
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:02,306
Look at him
I was fired by the kid's father

138
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:08,880
I'll be the first
person the police call in

139
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,220
Then what do we do?

140
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:35,840
Defeat the communists
the way for Korea is victory

141
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:49,082
Let's go for Freedom
Down

142
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:55,215
Defeat the communists

143
00:29:55,293 --> 00:30:02,790
the way for
Korea is victory

144
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,491
By the way

145
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,440
how come Daddy's
friend is so poor?

146
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,308
Huh?

147
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:29,684
We spent a lot of
money because I'm sick

148
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,886
What hospital is
your mother in?

149
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:43,567
She doesn't know
about the car accident

150
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:18,698
Daddy was too busy
so they got divorced

151
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,337
so

152
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:27,775
That's why
he left me with you

153
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:37,882
Mine?

154
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,170
Don't cry
Stop it!

155
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,705
Please
Stop

156
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:38,315
He wants to trade
it for your doll

157
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,888
Daddy loves Yoosun

158
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,867
Yoosun loves Daddy, too

159
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,750
Sis

160
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,021
More than anything

161
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:13,866
I'm jealous of girls with
mommys to braid their hair

162
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:34,022
Then come see
me sometime

163
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,023
Really?

164
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:57,177
Call me anytime

165
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:01,582
I'm all alone
so I get bored

166
00:39:53,825 --> 00:40:00,060
He never said why he
missed work so often?

167
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:07,333
Then he never went off
for special training?

168
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:13,934
Yes, last week from
Monday to Wednesday

169
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:17,358
She's washing

170
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:15,350
Give it!
I'm watching cartoons

171
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:32,585
Is anybody
out there?

172
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,871
Somebody help me

173
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:54,653
Go away!

174
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,001
Ryu

175
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,836
Ryu!

176
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,707
Ryu

177
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:44,237
Ryu Ryu Ryu

178
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,830
Ryu

179
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:31,013
The water's deep there
it's far over my head

180
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:02,037
Later I realized why
I thought the water was deep

181
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:05,540
When I was a kid
it was up over my head

182
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:16,729
Have you ever done
anything to provoke anyone?

183
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:22,670
Please think again

184
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:26,513
I always thought

185
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:30,811
I lived
an honest life

186
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,659
But think

187
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:43,923
Excuse me, what is
your net worth?

188
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,594
I'm a high school
graduate

189
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,199
and I started as
an electrical engineer

190
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,012
My wife left me when

191
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:01,047
the economy crashed

192
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:06,947
But why

193
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,027
I don't understand

194
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:18,599
Why didn't you
call the police?

195
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:25,203
I thought lots of
kids returned safely

196
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,204
If I do what
they tell me

197
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:34,350
Sir, I checked

198
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,181
it looks like they
used this phone number

199
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:41,018
they didn't answer
so we can't locate them

200
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:44,785
It's this number
right?

201
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:54,002
My wife gave it to
her before she left

202
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,238
Just a second

203
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,277
Yeah

204
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,614
I'm working

205
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,217
So an operation will

206
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:20,259
take care of it?

207
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,536
Where would I get 10 million won?

208
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:32,264
am I supposed to do?

209
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:41,684
At least kid wasn't
kidnapped and killed

210
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,510
We're lucky
you know

211
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:49,216
Cause we don't
have any money

212
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,834
Saw

213
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,015
Lift up

214
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,489
One, Two, Three

215
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,497
Saw

216
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,511
Lung was
Swollen badly

217
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:41,754
It looks like a
woman's handwriting

218
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:46,432
Do you recognize it?

219
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:13,360
Yoosun

220
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:50,910
Why didn't you give
me swimming lessons?

221
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:39,618
I put this house for sale

222
01:07:41,663 --> 01:07:43,756
and I sold the company, too

223
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:48,296
That's all

224
01:07:52,207 --> 01:07:55,074
the money I have

225
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:19,631
there's nothing
special about it

226
01:08:19,768 --> 01:08:23,260
A brother and
sister lived here

227
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:26,670
They don't know
where they moved to

228
01:08:31,179 --> 01:08:33,079
I'll look into it

229
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:44,817
Let's go

230
01:08:44,993 --> 01:08:46,585
Nothing more
to see here

231
01:08:58,673 --> 01:09:01,039
You asked if
I ever provoked anyone?

232
01:10:19,387 --> 01:10:21,617
Are you the father?

233
01:10:21,756 --> 01:10:25,487
-Well, actually
-I am

234
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:28,195
How is he?

235
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,669
If I were a very
optimistic doctor

236
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,996
I'd tell you
there was hope

237
01:10:39,241 --> 01:10:42,699
this is my guess

238
01:11:41,937 --> 01:11:44,872
When did you know
we'd become like this?

239
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:48,775
The moment
our eyes met

240
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:52,411
You're like an ant

241
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:53,913
An ant?

242
01:11:55,116 --> 01:11:59,052
They say
ants are psychic

243
01:11:59,788 --> 01:12:03,724
They predict
earthquakes and floods

244
01:13:48,563 --> 01:13:51,555
Baek Hyun-jin's "Affection"

245
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:55,067
requested by a man who
signed Ryu of Doksan-dong

246
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,966
Any of you remember
this guy?

247
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,340
He was deaf

248
01:14:00,408 --> 01:14:04,742
He sent a letter
saying his sister was sick

249
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:09,373
Oh, no
She passed away

250
01:14:10,118 --> 01:14:12,211
He says, "I'm the
one who killed her"

251
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,257
"My life has no
meaning now."

252
01:14:18,059 --> 01:14:20,323
You shouldn't
say that

253
01:14:20,462 --> 01:14:24,728
Would she want to
see you like this?

254
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:29,768
Don't forget she's
watching you from above

255
01:14:29,871 --> 01:14:33,398
I know
you can't hear me

256
01:14:33,508 --> 01:14:37,877
but me and our
listening audience

257
01:14:38,012 --> 01:14:40,606
are praying for you

258
01:14:41,015 --> 01:14:42,744
Be strong

259
01:14:42,851 --> 01:14:44,842
To help you out

260
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:46,546
I'll send you a new
Kimchi refrigerator

261
01:14:46,788 --> 01:14:50,815
It hasn't an address
so if anyone listening to

262
01:14:50,892 --> 01:14:54,828
broadcast knows him
please let him know

263
01:14:56,030 --> 01:15:00,364
We're waiting for such
touching stories from you

264
01:15:00,502 --> 01:15:02,060
If there's a story
you want to tell

265
01:15:02,137 --> 01:15:05,800
send me a letter

266
01:15:05,907 --> 01:15:14,838
Our address is Seoul
Yeongdungpo Yeouido...

267
01:15:15,183 --> 01:15:18,414
I kept them cause the
pictures were pretty

268
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,318
I cried so much
while reading them

269
01:15:26,995 --> 01:15:28,622
But

270
01:15:28,696 --> 01:15:31,824
is he
really a kidnapper?

271
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:37,762
Don't send him a gift
You haven't sent it?

272
01:17:52,106 --> 01:17:54,199
Two, three

273
01:19:00,174 --> 01:19:02,404
He's mentally
disabled

274
01:19:02,543 --> 01:19:04,670
not stupid

275
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:34,403
President Park
this is Choi

276
01:19:40,448 --> 01:19:44,475
the results are out
and we checked the car

277
01:19:44,585 --> 01:19:46,610
Yes
I know that place

278
01:19:47,855 --> 01:19:51,552
I'll see you
there at 2:00

279
01:20:05,807 --> 01:20:09,140
Yes, I'm calling
about the sticker

280
01:20:10,611 --> 01:20:13,102
Yeah the kidney
transplant

281
01:20:14,949 --> 01:20:16,314
Yes

282
01:20:17,452 --> 01:20:20,944
She wouldn't have
lived long anyway

283
01:20:21,122 --> 01:20:25,582
I searched hospitals
and found her file

284
01:20:27,395 --> 01:20:31,729
They managed to get a
kidney from someone

285
01:20:31,799 --> 01:20:34,165
but apparently they
didn't have money

286
01:20:35,269 --> 01:20:36,930
President Park

287
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:42,466
What I really
want to ask is

288
01:20:42,643 --> 01:20:46,545
What are you going to do
to when you find them?

289
01:20:46,681 --> 01:20:48,410
Kill them

290
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:29,920
Dismantle
the conglomerates!

291
01:21:34,095 --> 01:21:37,258
Drive out
U.S. Army!

292
01:21:41,869 --> 01:21:45,532
Destroy
the new liberalism

293
01:21:52,113 --> 01:21:55,139
that ruins the lives
of the people!

294
01:22:00,688 --> 01:22:04,488
Destroy
the new liberalism

295
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,503
I understand

296
01:22:21,642 --> 01:22:25,271
I'll wire you the money
tomorrow and then call you back

297
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,588
Destroy
the conglomerates!

298
01:22:43,664 --> 01:22:46,155
Destroy
the conglomerates!

299
01:22:47,268 --> 01:22:49,566
Drive out
U.S. Army

300
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:43,249
Are you going far?

301
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:46,926
Hell, yeah

302
01:24:53,728 --> 01:24:57,459
Shit, you said
I could go first!

303
01:26:00,694 --> 01:26:04,061
It's in an artery
Chulseung

304
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,727
Don't take it out!

305
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:20,110
Mom

306
01:27:38,993 --> 01:27:42,724
The noodles were all
soggy last time

307
01:27:43,631 --> 01:27:46,361
Yeah, hurry

308
01:28:00,047 --> 01:28:02,413
Huh?

309
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:12,883
Where is the bastard?

310
01:29:13,988 --> 01:29:15,512
Fuck you

311
01:29:42,349 --> 01:29:44,010
Where?

312
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:48,219
Fuck you

313
01:29:48,355 --> 01:29:50,915
Tell me
you bitch!

314
01:29:53,994 --> 01:29:55,188
Fuck

315
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:59,589
Next time, don't
order just one dish

316
01:32:14,401 --> 01:32:15,766
Mister

317
01:32:16,703 --> 01:32:18,193
Yoosun

318
01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:21,973
We didn't kill
her on purpose

319
01:32:23,277 --> 01:32:25,177
I'm sorry

320
01:32:25,646 --> 01:32:27,773
we made a mistake

321
01:32:29,116 --> 01:32:33,815
But I have something
to tell you

322
01:32:38,826 --> 01:32:43,957
I'm not just any
ordinary person

323
01:32:47,267 --> 01:32:50,236
If anything
happens to me

324
01:32:51,104 --> 01:32:55,302
my organization
is a terrorist group

325
01:32:56,376 --> 01:32:58,571
They'll kill you

326
01:32:58,946 --> 01:33:02,746
100%
For sure

327
01:33:06,486 --> 01:33:08,647
I gave them
your picture

328
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:16,819
If you want to live
just leave me

329
01:33:17,965 --> 01:33:20,593
This is
for your sake

330
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:22,766
honest

331
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:29,199
And

332
01:33:31,545 --> 01:33:33,638
I'm sorry

333
01:33:36,483 --> 01:33:38,075
100%

334
01:34:52,993 --> 01:34:56,429
She sat next to
the deaf kid

335
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:01,297
so
she's deaf, too?

336
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:02,891
No

337
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:07,063
how come she went
to same school?

338
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,435
So
what I mean is

339
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:12,137
she got expelled

340
01:35:12,245 --> 01:35:14,645
when was find out
she wasn't deaf

341
01:35:14,982 --> 01:35:18,679
She went to college
and was a left wing activist

342
01:35:18,785 --> 01:35:23,119
sneaked onto a boat once
trying to reach N-Korea

343
01:35:23,256 --> 01:35:24,951
And?

344
01:35:27,361 --> 01:35:30,626
She got caught by some fishermen

345
01:35:30,697 --> 01:35:33,257
caught her in a net
while she was swimming

346
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:37,368
She's part of the RAA

347
01:35:37,437 --> 01:35:38,699
What?

348
01:35:38,772 --> 01:35:40,637
I mean, she was

349
01:35:42,676 --> 01:35:46,806
Go to Intelligence
and bring a few of them

350
01:35:46,913 --> 01:35:48,938
The problem is

351
01:35:49,082 --> 01:35:54,349
She was the only member of RAA

352
01:36:31,725 --> 01:36:34,751
Make way please, excuse me

353
01:36:38,031 --> 01:36:42,468
Excuse me

354
01:36:58,752 --> 01:37:01,880
we're
coming through

355
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:29,543
I'm sorry
you can't ride here

356
01:37:41,928 --> 01:37:46,262
Its C-3
They found some of

357
01:37:46,366 --> 01:37:49,301
Cha Youngmi's flyers
at a crime scene

358
01:37:50,403 --> 01:37:52,166
What scene?

359
01:37:52,939 --> 01:37:55,203
Three people
were murdered

360
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:23,883
yes

361
01:41:24,117 --> 01:41:28,577
The organ dealers
are dead!

362
01:41:28,688 --> 01:41:30,053
But
their sides

363
01:41:30,123 --> 01:41:34,219
are cut open
You know

364
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:36,852
He took
the kidneys!

365
01:41:38,298 --> 01:41:39,629
President Park

366
01:41:39,699 --> 01:41:42,031
he seems like
a real psycho

367
01:41:42,135 --> 01:41:46,128
Killed three people
He isn't human

368
01:41:46,272 --> 01:41:48,263
Give this up now

369
01:41:48,575 --> 01:41:50,736
I'll return
all your money

370
01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:16,520
I know
you're a good guy

371
01:49:21,527 --> 01:49:24,155
But you know

372
01:49:28,734 --> 01:49:33,137
why I have to
kill you?

373
01:49:35,007 --> 01:49:37,669
Understand?

374
01:49:38,644 --> 01:49:42,546
Huh?
you know?

375
01:51:52,645 --> 01:51:56,877
-Hello?
-yeh, Inchon Hospital

376
01:51:56,949 --> 01:52:00,112
is there
boy's father?

377
01:52:00,353 --> 01:52:06,622
He died just now at 12:20

378
01:52:06,726 --> 01:52:10,218
The mortuary's on floor B2

379
01:52:10,329 --> 01:52:11,921
You've got the wrong number

380
01:52:12,031 --> 01:52:12,861
What?

381
01:56:19,578 --> 01:56:21,409
Mister

382
01:56:23,983 --> 01:56:26,975
If anything happens to me

383
01:56:27,786 --> 01:56:32,052
my organization
is a terrorist group

384
01:56:30,725 --> 01:56:32,955
They'll kill you

385
01:56:33,428 --> 01:56:37,125
100%.
for sure

386
01:56:38,866 --> 01:56:41,960
I gave them your picture
