1
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,781
My name's Dave Robicheaux.

2
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:23,823
I am an alcoholic.

3
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,654
Sometimes I am tempted to have a drink.

4
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,222
But I never do.

5
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,576
I hope this poor girl was dead

6
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,246
before he started carving on her like that.

7
00:02:35,246 --> 00:02:38,518
This poor girl didn't have
a whole lot of good luck, Dave.

8
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,304
In the ancient world,

9
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:57,502
people placed heavy stones
on the graves of their dead

10
00:02:57,502 --> 00:03:01,343
so their souls would not wander
and afflict the living.

11
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:03,279
I always thought
this was simply the practice

12
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,978
of superstitious and primitive people.

13
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,007
But I was about to learn that the dead

14
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:10,918
can hover on the edge of our vision

15
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:14,391
with the density and luminosity of mist.

16
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:17,554
And their claim on the earth
can be as legitimate

17
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:20,758
and tenacious as our own.

18
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,034
Could I see your driver's license, please?

19
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,332
My what?

20
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:00,565
Driver's license.

21
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,767
Please take it out your billfold,
hand it to me.

22
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,469
Oh, yeah, sure.

23
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:05,309
Well...

24
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,246
I was a little careless back there.

25
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:09,372
I am sorry about that.

26
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:10,609
You're Elrod T. Sykes?

27
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,116
Yes, sir, that's who I am.

28
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:14,915
Step out the car, Mr. Sykes.

29
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:16,922
Yes, sir.
Anything you say, sir.

30
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,929
Mr. Sykes, I think you have been drinking,

31
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,487
and I know you have been smoking
marijuana in your automobile.

32
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:28,090
I believe your lady friend there
just ate the roach.

33
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,567
Ooh, well, that wouldn't
be good now, would it?

34
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:33,003
You're under arrest for driving
while intoxicated, Mr. Sykes.

35
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,404
I will take you just down the
street here to the city jail.

36
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:37,670
I will send a car, take
Ms. Drummond wherever she's staying.

37
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,870
But your little red sports car

38
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,378
is going to be towed to the pound.

39
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:41,413
This is bad news.

40
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:42,812
This is not on my agenda,

41
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:44,247
because we're just starting a movie.

42
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,682
I have always enjoyed all your films.

43
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:46,878
Ms. Drummond's too.

44
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:48,682
Take your car keys out the ignition please.

45
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:51,724
El, do something.

46
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,530
I feel real bad about this.

47
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,964
Can he make a contribution

48
00:05:00,964 --> 00:05:04,197
to Mothers Against Drunk Driving
or something like that?

49
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:06,363
As an admirer of your work, Ms. Drummond,

50
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:09,203
I recommend you don't make any
more mentions of contributions.

51
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,641
I recommend you stay put.

52
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:13,906
Deputy will be along here in
a few minutes to take you home.

53
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:15,914
Allons.

54
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,185
You're not going to get sick
in my truck, are you?

55
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:28,227
No, I am just fine.

56
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,318
Mm.

57
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,320
Mm.

58
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,222
Mm.

59
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,409
Oh.

60
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,111
Huh.

61
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:53,861
Oh.

62
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,854
I know where there's a dead body.

63
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:59,255
What?

64
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:00,952
Ugh.

65
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:05,225
Looks like a big pile
of gristle and bone.

66
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:08,734
Where was this?

67
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:11,668
Way the hell out
in Atchafalaya swamp.

68
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:16,903
We had to pick up a scene near
the old Indian reservation.

69
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:17,943
I went to take a leak.

70
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,308
I saw it sticking out
of a sandbar.

71
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:21,472
Ugh.

72
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,911
Get back in the truck.

73
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:26,076
Ugh.

74
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,282
That swamp full
of old Indian bones.

75
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:32,654
Yeah, but...

76
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:34,124
Sorry, I didn't
catch your name.

77
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:35,717
Dave Robicheaux.

78
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,490
Mr. Robicheaux,

79
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,497
now, if that was
an Indian I found,

80
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:40,793
I was wondering
what he was doing

81
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:43,097
with a chain
wrapped around him.

82
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,740
Say that again.

83
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,174
It's a rusted chain
with links

84
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:52,575
as big as my fist

85
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:56,137
crisscrossed
around his rib cage.

86
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,883
Can you find
that sandbar again?

87
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,295
Yes, sir,
I believe I could.

88
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,266
I am going to make
a confession to you,

89
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,461
Mr. Sykes.

90
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,164
DWIs are a pain
in the butt.

91
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:20,762
If I take you home,
can I have your word

92
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,967
you will be in my office,
9:00 in the morning?

93
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,033
And sober?

94
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:28,080
9:00, you got it.
Absolutely.

95
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,174
Hey, I really appreciate this.

96
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,232
Elrod Sykes
and Kelly Drummond?

97
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:51,270
I want to go
to the set.

98
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,304
Sykes is a drunk.

99
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,338
He's huge.

100
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:55,203
His head
glows in the dark.

101
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:57,333
Maybe we could get
an autographed movie poster.

102
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,037
No way.

103
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:01,443
Not for you,
for the hurricane relief fund.

104
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:02,481
Okay, cool.

105
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,515
Please?

106
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:04,550
Will you hush?

107
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,084
I will take her

108
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:07,642
and look out for her,

109
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:09,051
if that's
all right with you.

110
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,589
Maybe we could get Kelly
Drummond to sign one too,

111
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:13,147
pay for somebody's roof.

112
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:14,523
Please?

113
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,276
It's over yonder.

114
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:12,249
Hold on there,
Mr. Sykes.

115
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:13,979
Best put
some of this on.

116
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:16,248
We used to have
a lot of bats down here,

117
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:18,790
but the mosquitoes ate them all.

118
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,758
That boy's a long way
from his Hollywood poontang,

119
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:21,793
ain't he?

120
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:23,123
This jackass
is objectifying you,

121
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:25,493
Mr. Sykes, because
he's had very little exposure

122
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:26,532
to the outside world.

123
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,759
Don't let it bother you.

124
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,239
Hurricane Betsy blowing through
here in '65 probably buried him

125
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,507
and Katrina unearthed him.

126
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:42,809
Why '65?

127
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,546
Hurricanes tear up this part
of the country all the time.

128
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,780
See that left shin bone?

129
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,084
Clipped in half.

130
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:53,387
That's where they shot him
when he tried to run away.

131
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:55,290
You a psychic
or some bullshit like that?

132
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,386
No, I saw it happen
about a mile from here.

133
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,090
Are you saying
that some white people

134
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,598
lynched somebody
around here?

135
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:03,260
When we get back, you're going
to have to talk to your sheriff,

136
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,099
get the coroner
out here now.

137
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:07,662
I don't know about y'all
over in Iberia Parish,

138
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:10,504
but around here,
ain't nobody going to be

139
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:13,101
real interested in nigger trouble
that's 40 years old.

140
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:14,771
What are you looking for,
Mr. Robicheaux?

141
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,543
I don't see any remnants
of a belt on his trousers...

142
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,918
or any laces
in his boots.

143
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:24,047
That boy probably did his
shopping at the Goodwill.

144
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,123
They never found him,
didn't even look for him.

145
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:36,657
Back then, with no body,
no missing persons report,

146
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:38,795
that sheriff didn't have
any reason to believe me,

147
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:42,807
must less get off his ass
and go to work.

148
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:46,367
You're not
17 years old anymore.

149
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,675
The trouble I have with you
is getting you away from work.

150
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:51,080
You have done everything
that you can.

151
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,209
You have no good reason
to beat yourself up.

152
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:56,015
Now drink your milk
and come to bed.

153
00:10:56,015 --> 00:10:57,680
I am horny.

154
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,656
Bootsie was right.

155
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:06,061
What was the point of reaching
into the distant past?

156
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:09,761
Just yesterday, a young girl
had been eviscerated.

157
00:11:09,761 --> 00:11:13,931
We had her name now,
Cherry LeBlanc.

158
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,536
Mr. Trajan around?

159
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:24,344
He's over there, chere.

160
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:27,386
We have been over this already
three times now.

161
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,887
Cherry's been working here off
and on for the past few weeks.

162
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:33,254
She's going to show up anyway
to listen to Hogman Pitan.

163
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:34,758
The girl had a real thing
for Hogman.

164
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:36,920
Some time around 1:00,
she put her purse behind the bar

165
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,623
and says she's going to go
outside for a walk.

166
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,893
You know she'd been
arrested for prostitution?

167
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:42,160
I didn't know that.

168
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,327
All right.

169
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:45,802
Okay.

170
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:47,099
You hired her because you thought

171
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,141
she was an honor student
at LSU.

172
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,642
I can't say I care for the way
you're talking to me, Detective.

173
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:54,908
If I found out you have been
holding back information on me,

174
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:59,610
Mr. Trajan, I am a come back here
with a warrant, Mr. Trajan,

175
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,152
for your arrest.

176
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,599
Did you know Cherry LeBlanc,

177
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:26,770
little white girl,
about 19 years old?

178
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,815
She work here,
ain't she?

179
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,873
Do you know if she had
a boyfriend, tante?

180
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:33,646
If that's what
you want to call it.

181
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:34,981
She in the business.

182
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:36,351
Was Mr. Trajan involved?

183
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:38,014
Ask him.

184
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:40,285
I don't think he was.

185
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:43,920
Otherwise you wouldn't be
telling me all these things.

186
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,088
She a sad girl.

187
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:48,725
I told her,
"A pretty white girl like you

188
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,393
could have anything you want."

189
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,338
When that girl dress up,
she look just like a movie star.

190
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,204
Who was her pimp?

191
00:12:57,204 --> 00:13:00,177
I don't know nothing else, me.

192
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,879
She wasn't about
to give the name

193
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,611
of some rich white man
to an old black woman.

194
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,245
What rich white man?

195
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,888
Some rich white man maybe...

196
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:18,487
get her out of the business
of selling jelly roll.

197
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,566
She say that just before
somebody done them

198
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:25,433
awful things
to that young girl.

199
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,984
The sheriff over
in St. Clair Parish

200
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:44,318
said, "Thanks a lot,"
for that pile of bones you found

201
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:46,620
out in the Atchafalaya yesterday.

202
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,319
They really appreciate
the extra work.

203
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,622
He need to find
a new line of work,

204
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:51,458
he don't like them bones.

205
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,760
Now, he said you're welcome
to come over on your days off

206
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,960
and run an investigation.

207
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,199
Their coroner's got them bones
now waiting on you.

208
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,570
Autopsy report came in
on that LeBlanc girl.

209
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,181
Looks like we're talking
about a psychopath,

210
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:13,912
somebody wired to the eyes
on crack or meth.

211
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:15,578
Maybe.

212
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:16,621
I think she knew him.

213
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:18,520
So you don't think
it was a John?

214
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,185
No, she left her purse
behind the bar

215
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:24,058
with all her condoms in it.

216
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:27,530
Cherry LeBlanc was
a working girl with ambition.

217
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,364
Maybe she misjudged
a business opportunity here.

218
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:33,371
Who's a girl like that
going to be in business with?

219
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:36,875
Um... Baby Feet?

220
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,943
Maybe Baby Feet.

221
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,660
What's happening, Cholo?

222
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,752
I thought
you was in the pen.

223
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:57,921
No, man.

224
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:59,362
Katrina,
she rinsed my hands clean.

225
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:01,922
The whole damn crime lab

226
00:15:01,922 --> 00:15:03,127
washed off
down the river.

227
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:05,329
Ain't got nothing on me
in New Orleans.

228
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:06,598
Doing fine, bro.

229
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:08,435
Besides that, they ain't
even got enough money

230
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:09,838
to lobotomize
guys like me no more.

231
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:12,104
What's going on, Dave?

232
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:15,510
I am investigating a murder,
Julie.

233
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,548
No kidding.

234
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,407
Y'all worried about me,
Dave?

235
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:20,747
Hell yes.

236
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,286
How many guys
would burn down their own

237
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:25,380
father's nightclub with their
own father still in it?

238
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,162
You got to forgive me
if I get a little upset

239
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:35,098
by these
kinds of attitudes, Dave.

240
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:36,498
I come home
to this shithole.

241
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:40,129
I am a prominent man
in the entertainment business.

242
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:43,971
I talk on the phone every day
to people in California

243
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:46,568
you read about
in Entertainment Weekly.

244
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,909
They ought to have
"Welcome Back Balboni Day."

245
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:50,039
Instead,

246
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,447
I get treated
like sewer gas by you.

247
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:55,078
You understand
what I am saying, Dave.

248
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,781
It hurts me.

249
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:59,119
Sit down
while I take a whiz.

250
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:01,250
Cholo,
where's your hospitality?

251
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,352
Get the man
a soft drink.

252
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,172
Here, Lieutenant.

253
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,604
Julie was telling me
about that time

254
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:17,301
that nigger almost popped you with a .38

255
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:19,003
in the French Quarter.

256
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:21,012
Said he saved your life.

257
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,042
Weren't you and Julie baseball buddies
in high school?

258
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,517
Take the hint,
Cholo.

259
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:30,748
This guy's
not a conversationalist.

260
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,262
You working on that
Cherry LeBlanc deal?

261
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,126
What you know
about that?

262
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:41,758
All over
today's paper, man.

263
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:44,200
Julie and me
were just talking about it.

264
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,238
Sounds like you got
one sick fuck on the loose.

265
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,405
My meter's running,
Julie.

266
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:57,540
I want to talk about

267
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,140
that murdered girl
we found south of town.

268
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,378
Which girl is that?

269
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,352
Cherry LeBlanc.

270
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:04,946
I guess
I ain't heard about it.

271
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:06,150
You don't read
the newspaper?

272
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,214
I have been busy.

273
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:10,523
Mm-hmm,
I can see that.

274
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:12,359
We used to be friends,
Dave.

275
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,194
I even maybe
did you a favor once.

276
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:16,496
So I am going to line it out
for you and any locals

277
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:18,399
that want to get
the wax out their ears.

278
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,404
Louisiana's flat-ass broke.

279
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:22,167
New Orleans
is a mortuary.

280
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,868
And the bottom
of a toilet's got more appeal

281
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,773
than this shithole
in the bayou.

282
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:27,072
So they better
wake up to the fact

283
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:29,239
that we are dropping
close to $40 million

284
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,508
in Iberia Parish.

285
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,606
They don't like the name

286
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:33,207
Balboni around here?

287
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:34,616
We will move the whole
fucking movie

288
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:36,153
over to Mississippi.

289
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:38,621
See how that floats
with those coon-ass jack-offs

290
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:39,679
on the Chamber of Commerce.

291
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,385
You're
in the movie business now?

292
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:45,556
Yeah, I am producing White Doves
with Michael Goldman.

293
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:48,099
What you think about that?

294
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,964
I am sure everybody
wishes you success, Julie.

295
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:52,731
I am a do a baseball movie next.

296
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:54,295
You want a part in it?

297
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,019
You can go on in.

298
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:17,858
You remember me, Dave?

299
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,691
It's Doucet, isn't it?

300
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:22,427
Yes, sir,
Murphy Doucet.

301
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:24,366
You got a good memory.

302
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:26,427
I was with the Jefferson Parish
Sheriff's Department

303
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:27,904
when you were with NOPD.

304
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:29,497
I guess you're
in the movie business now,

305
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:31,042
along with everybody else.

306
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:33,806
Yeah, I own half
of a security service now,

307
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:36,848
and I am still with the Teamsters
out of Lafayette.

308
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,577
So I am kind of doing
double duty here.

309
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,845
Is there some kind of trouble?

310
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:43,581
Where can I find
Mr. Goldman?

311
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,623
Right on the other side
of them trees.

312
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:46,919
I will let him know
you're coming.

313
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,960
It's all right.
I will find him.

314
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,360
We had two divisions of soldiers
march through that?

315
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,162
Looks like we're shooting
a bread commercial.

316
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:58,897
Where'd we get this cannon,
Toys "R" Us?

317
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:01,633
All right, I am going to need
floaters in there,

318
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,141
one face down,
two belly-up.

319
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,267
Use some of the fat extras.

320
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:07,005
They will look bloated.

321
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:08,046
My dead horse?

322
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,080
No.

323
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,673
Not on the call sheet?
Terrific.

324
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:13,342
We need some blood,
blood-soaked ground,

325
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:14,942
if that's what it says
in the script.

326
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:16,180
This is not
the nightly news.

327
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,223
They never show the blood.

328
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,258
This is an allegory.

329
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:22,418
We're not shooting
the fall of Vicksburg.

330
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:24,359
This is Baghdad 2007.

331
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,090
Copy that.

332
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,066
If people don't connect the dots, fuck them.

333
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:31,398
There's a Detective Robicheaux
here to see you, sir.

334
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:34,735
So you're
investigating a crime.

335
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:36,671
Seen any crime
around here?

336
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:39,575
Only crime I am aware of is
the air conditioning in my trailer.

337
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:42,876
You could fry an egg
on the toilet seat in there.

338
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:45,416
Then I have got a lead actor
digging up skeletons

339
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,510
in sandbars, exactly what
I need to be thinking about

340
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,747
while I am shooting a picture.

341
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:54,190
Mr. Goldman, is Mr. Julius
Balboni producing this film?

342
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,250
Producing?

343
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,796
I must have really fucked up
in my previous incarnation.

344
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:01,731
Maybe I sunk the Titanic

345
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:05,201
or assassinated
Archduke Ferdinand.

346
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,862
I am the only producer.

347
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,998
So Mr. Balboni's lying.

348
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:13,511
Mr. Balboni is investing
some of his money in a motion picture.

349
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:15,410
Is that illegal?

350
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,209
Congratulations.

351
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:20,217
You in business with the man
that hung Fulvio Raneri's cousin

352
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,947
up by his colon
on a meat hook.

353
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:25,387
Do you recognize
this girl,

354
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:27,015
Cherry LeBlanc?

355
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,528
How you are, Hogman?

356
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,135
Come on up
on the porch.

357
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:13,398
Grab a chair.

358
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,839
You knew that LeBlanc girl,
didn't you?

359
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,438
I don't like to have nothing
to do with white folks' business,

360
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:27,849
but it bothers me
what somebody do to that girl.

361
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,854
I spoke to her about two hours
before she left the juke.

362
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,014
She said, "Hogman,

363
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:34,354
in the next life, me and you
going to get married."

364
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:35,859
That's what she said.

365
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:40,762
I said, "Darling, don't let the
men misuse you for no chicken."

366
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:43,062
She said, "I am going
to have myself a town house

367
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:44,500
on Lake Pontchartrain."

368
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,400
Was she mixed up with somebody
from New Orleans?

369
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,134
Probably some white-trash pimp
told her she special,

370
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,175
she pretty.

371
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,811
Instead,
she got herself killed.

372
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,212
You're mixed up with
that skeleton they found

373
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:01,547
in the Atchafalaya,
ain't you?

374
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:03,383
How do you know
about that?

375
00:22:03,383 --> 00:22:05,855
When somebody find
a dead black man,

376
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:09,485
black people
knows about it.

377
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,095
I am listening.

378
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:15,531
A blue jay don't sit
on a mockingbird's nest.

379
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:19,092
The mockingbird will whoop
the blue jay's ass every time.

380
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:21,901
What are we talking about here,
Sam?

381
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:23,531
I am talking
about a black man.

382
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:25,803
And he was carrying on
with a white woman

383
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,003
who husband
he worked for.

384
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:29,980
I think them was his bones
you dug in that sandbar.

385
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,447
What was his name?

386
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:32,949
Who care what's his name?

387
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:35,077
I think he got
what he asked for.

388
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:36,643
I say, "Past is past,

389
00:22:36,643 --> 00:22:38,383
and don't be
messing with it."

390
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:39,754
You warning me?

391
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,190
What was
that white woman's name?

392
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,064
I got to go
start my beans now.

393
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,003
Alafair,

394
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:01,273
you got to keep this raccoon
out of my fried pie.

395
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:03,871
Next time he come in here,
I am a swat him with my broom.

396
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:06,679
Tripod's just an animal.

397
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,050
Why don't you try kicking the
smell of cigars out of the yard?

398
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,750
Alafair, you shouldn't
talk to Batist like that.

399
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,486
But he threatened Tripod
with menacing violence.

400
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:18,085
Tripod's a raccoon, baby.

401
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:19,721
Apologize to Batist.

402
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,265
Sorry for what I said.

403
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:23,267
And I am saying it because Dave made me.

404
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,466
That's a beautiful child,
Dave.

405
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:32,840
By the time
she's 18 years old,

406
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,471
your hair's going
to be solid white,

407
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:37,674
if there's
any of it left.

408
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:47,859
Oh, wow.

409
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:50,878
Uh.

410
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,529
This is great.

411
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:58,569
I love it.

412
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:01,435
You run a bait shop too.

413
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:02,939
How you doing,
Mr. Robicheaux?

414
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:05,238
We want to have dinner
with y'all tonight.

415
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:06,675
Oh, thanks, but my wife's
already cooking supper.

416
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:07,973
I was just on my way
over there to take a shower.

417
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,308
Well, hurry up.

418
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:12,214
We got reservations
at Clementine's, everybody.

419
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:14,809
The family has plans
for this evening, Mr. Sykes.

420
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:18,049
This is embarrassing, El.

421
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:20,990
I have a reservation.

422
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,549
Hey, I don't want
to cause any problems.

423
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:24,618
We will just pick up
our liquids at your store here

424
00:24:24,618 --> 00:24:26,994
and hit the road, okay?

425
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:28,434
Mr. Sykes...

426
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,762
you have been
driving drunk,

427
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,703
and you come to a cop's house
to buy more booze.

428
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,139
Why don't you hand
those keys to Ms. Drummond

429
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:42,180
before you hit the road?

430
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:45,850
Where's that beer at?

431
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,455
Hey.

432
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,785
You're a good man.

433
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,223
Y'all need
to be real careful.

434
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,722
Elrod's a shitbird,
but I love him.

435
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,704
It's all right.

436
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:08,966
Bad timing.
Put it there.

437
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,439
Cool.
Next time.

438
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,067
Hey.

439
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:13,132
All right.

440
00:25:13,132 --> 00:25:16,146
Um, shit.
We will settle up.

441
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:18,944
We will settle up later,
yeah?

442
00:25:18,944 --> 00:25:21,542
All right.

443
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:22,587
Other side.

444
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,621
Ah.

445
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,613
Come here.

446
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:29,159
Come on.
Come here.

447
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,755
Elrod.

448
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:33,695
What? Check this out.

449
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:34,732
Will you stop?

450
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,584
El.

451
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,468
Check me out.

452
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,034
Samore?
Made them myself.

453
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:50,206
Oh, thank you.

454
00:25:50,206 --> 00:25:51,749
Elrod Sykes
is wearing Dave's jersey.

455
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:52,908
Can you believe it?

456
00:25:52,908 --> 00:25:53,951
Mm-hmm.

457
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:55,748
Now go do your homework.

458
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:57,879
Something to drink?

459
00:25:57,879 --> 00:25:59,253
How about a beer?

460
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:02,191
I think we're out.

461
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:04,023
I am sure there's
one in there somewhere.

462
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,454
I am going to go feed
Alafair's rabbits.

463
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:09,022
You care to join me?

464
00:26:09,022 --> 00:26:11,193
Yeah, yeah, sure.

465
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,817
Get back there, Leroy.

466
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:27,852
Go on.

467
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,524
You ever seen lights
in the cypress trees at night?

468
00:26:36,524 --> 00:26:38,028
That's swamp gas.

469
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,530
It will ignite and roll out across
the waters like ball lightning.

470
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,964
No, sir,
that's not what it is.

471
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:44,593
See these guys out yonder
by the lake.

472
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:48,605
They have lanterns hanging
from some of their ambulances.

473
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:51,870
A lot of those soldiers
had maggots in their wounds.

474
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,274
That's the only reason they lived.

475
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:55,506
It's because the maggots
ate out the infection.

476
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:56,979
You have been drunk
a long time, Elrod.

477
00:26:56,979 --> 00:27:00,484
Pretty soon all the trees and
alligators will be talking to you.

478
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:03,646
A wild orchid
sang a song to me one time.

479
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:04,950
She had the prettiest voice.

480
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,285
Yeah, I wasn't drunk.

481
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:08,019
Mm-hmm.

482
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:09,458
This guy, a general,

483
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:11,222
he's standing on a crutch
right by the water.

484
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:13,230
And he said to me,

485
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,199
"You and your friend
the law man must repel them."

486
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,825
I think you're delusional.

487
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:19,767
You might want to think about
going to an AA meeting

488
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:22,238
with me one time.

489
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:25,242
Maybe I was
a little drunk.

490
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,210
What happened
to this dude's nose?

491
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,679
Coon bit him.

492
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:31,875
Aw.

493
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,553
Lou Girard always called at night.

494
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:46,460
I had picked him
out of gutters

495
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,726
from New Orleans
to Lake Charles,

496
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:50,825
held him
when he had the shakes,

497
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:55,601
driven him to AA meetings more
times than I could remember.

498
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:57,835
And he had done
the same for me.

499
00:27:57,835 --> 00:27:59,103
Thanks for the call, Lou.

500
00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:00,940
Yeah, when I saw
that electrical tape

501
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,606
around her hands and her feet,
or what's left of them,

502
00:28:03,606 --> 00:28:06,116
I thought about you and that
LeBlanc case you got going.

503
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:08,550
Where she at now?

504
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,919
She's right there,
still in that barrel.

505
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,982
She got about
15 big blue crabs on her.

506
00:28:14,982 --> 00:28:21,932
Coroner says, we move her,
she's coming out in pieces.

507
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:24,662
We're going to have a rough time
getting an ID, maybe.

508
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,795
Maybe by her teeth.

509
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:28,532
That's the poor bastard
who found her.

510
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:31,700
When did you
first notice that barrel?

511
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,075
About four
or three weeks back.

512
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:37,808
See anyone else out there
on that levee?

513
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:41,045
Yeah, about a month ago
in the evening,

514
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:43,713
I seen a dark-colored car.

515
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:46,655
I remember thinking,
it was brand-new, you know?

516
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:48,454
Why would anybody
want to bring their new car

517
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:51,051
down on that dirt road
full of holes?

518
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:53,324
You remember
what kind of car it was?

519
00:28:53,324 --> 00:28:54,831
No, sir.
I am sorry.

520
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:59,063
I just wish I hadn't been the one
to find that poor woman.

521
00:28:59,063 --> 00:29:01,332
And, hey, I am never
going to look inside

522
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:02,430
another barrel again.

523
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,474
Not me, no.

524
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,839
That will do.
Thank you.

525
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,639
Officer Guidry
going to take you home.

526
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:09,304
Thank you.

527
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,205
I need a tow truck to haul off a limousine.
Where about?

528
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:43,999
Can't miss it. Right in front of Chez Narcisse.
When? Right now. Copy that. Thank you, chere.

529
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,419
You could get
the Roman Army down here.

530
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:27,822
One division of these guys

531
00:30:27,822 --> 00:30:29,689
could have knocked off
these squirrel hunters,

532
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:31,353
had the Civil War over
in one year.

533
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:32,487
You know what?

534
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:34,759
Maybe we will do
a Bible movie next.

535
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,528
Yeah, but how do you fight
a war with sandals?

536
00:30:36,528 --> 00:30:39,399
That's... stupid.

537
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:41,768
How did they win wars
with sandals, hm?

538
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,382
What's going on, Dave?

539
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:03,984
Had a long night
last night.

540
00:31:03,984 --> 00:31:08,726
Found a girl in a barrel down
in south St. Martin Parish.

541
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:10,199
She covered up
in blue crabs.

542
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,530
You ought to run her again.

543
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,570
We will have gumbo.

544
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,137
You here
for breakfast?

545
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,606
Sit down.

546
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,885
You're pissed off
about some little thing,

547
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,084
so you have my car towed.

548
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,093
You need to quit parking
in front of fireplugs.

549
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:39,686
Fireplugs; I am getting this kind
of shit because of fireplugs?

550
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:41,026
No, Julie.

551
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:43,090
I want to know what you have
to do with a teenage hooker

552
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,158
named Cherry LeBlanc.

553
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:46,828
Who the fuck
is Cherry LeBlanc?

554
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:47,894
You know
who she is.

555
00:31:47,894 --> 00:31:49,337
You and Cholo
were talking about her

556
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:52,570
before I got to the Holiday Inn,
and you lied to me about it.

557
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,872
Calling me a liar?

558
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:55,810
You're a motherfucking lying
piece of dog shit.

559
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,814
I think this
sweet little town's

560
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:59,349
starting to rub off
on you, David.

561
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:01,112
Gentlemen, could you please...

562
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:02,675
I mean,
just not use that language...

563
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:04,244
Get the fuck
away from my table.

564
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:05,289
It's all right,
Mr. Meaux.

565
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:06,687
I will be gone
in a second.

566
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:09,886
Oh, sad to hear that.

567
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,862
I don't know
none of these girls.

568
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:17,732
I don't have nothing to do
with your business.

569
00:32:17,732 --> 00:32:20,100
You said some
ugly things about me, Dave,

570
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,503
and I am going
to let it slide.

571
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:23,972
I will call
a couple of cabs,

572
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:25,737
I will pay the fine
on my car,

573
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:28,938
I will buy some new tires,

574
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:31,345
and I will forget everything
you have been saying to me,

575
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:33,543
because I got
a business to run.

576
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,687
Everybody's been
pretty polite here.

577
00:32:37,687 --> 00:32:39,985
Keep it simple,
stupid.

578
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:42,925
It's time for you to let
people alone, Mr. Robicheaux.

579
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:43,675
Uh.

580
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,430
Ease off,
Lieutenant.

581
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,627
This ain't good
for nobody.

582
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:52,670
Uh.

583
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,364
Come on.
Come on.

584
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,371
You're losing it, Dave.

585
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:05,678
You need to get yourself
some better tranqs.

586
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,107
No, sir, I wouldn't
exactly call it a dead end.

587
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:31,698
You have a seat,
I will be right with you.

588
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,069
Thank you.

589
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:37,478
It's $100-million contract.

590
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:39,573
He must have pocketed
$60 million, $70 million.

591
00:33:39,573 --> 00:33:44,212
False load slips,
bogus waybills.

592
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:46,586
Balboni Trucking hauled
just about enough debris

593
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:47,624
to fill a Dixie cup.

594
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:49,125
Yes, sir,
we are trying.

595
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,525
Thank you.

596
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:52,688
Can I help you
with something?

597
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:53,731
I hope so.

598
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,265
This is my office.

599
00:33:55,265 --> 00:33:56,698
Oh, my God,
I am s...

600
00:33:56,698 --> 00:33:58,599
I am sorry.
I was...

601
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,398
a call came in for me
on your extension,

602
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:01,665
and I just...

603
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,173
anyway,
I am Special Agent Rosa Gomez.

604
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:06,335
Everyone calls me Rosie,
so call me Rosie.

605
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,845
It's nice to meet you,
Special Agent Rosie.

606
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,779
"Your detective's
investigative missteps

607
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:18,822
are going to hurt you
in November."

608
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:20,016
That's courtesy of that prick

609
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,252
Bubba Broussard
over at the city council.

610
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:23,918
So you called the FBI?

611
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,020
The FBI's been trying
to nail Balboni

612
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,588
for over a year now
on a FEMA scam.

613
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:31,567
And they still have
precisely nothing on him.

614
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:34,104
That's why I think
they're hoping there's more

615
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:35,833
to that Cherry LeBlanc case.

616
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,574
Now, Balboni
is throwing a birthday bash

617
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:43,876
for Mr. Michael Goldman
this evening.

618
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,109
I think you, too,
should attend.

619
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,454
There are 17 unsolved
homicides in Louisiana

620
00:34:51,454 --> 00:34:53,251
that share some
similarities with this case.

621
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:56,487
And ten of them share
multiple common denominators.

622
00:34:56,487 --> 00:34:57,994
All show marks
from being bound,

623
00:34:57,994 --> 00:35:00,326
all young,
all working class.

624
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:01,387
One was a high school girl.

625
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:03,229
Two were waitresses.
Three had been runaways.

626
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:04,791
And four were prostitutes.

627
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:13,166
The FBI has an informational advantage
over Iberia Parish.

628
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,007
How do you like
that catfish court bouillon?

629
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:16,478
Uh, it's interesting.

630
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,153
If you found the remains
of a black man

631
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:25,689
and he had no belt,
no laces in his boot,

632
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:28,384
what speculation
would you make about him?

633
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,622
Obviously he'd been in jail,
a parish, or city holding tank,

634
00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:33,823
some place where they were
afraid he'd do harm to himself.

635
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:35,331
That's what I think.

636
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,839
Mud bugs,
as advertised.

637
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,405
This one
has your name on it.

638
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:02,860
Get out of here.

639
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,274
Hey, Dave, you ought
to get yourself some food.

640
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:19,309
It's free.

641
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:23,677
Thanks.
I have already eaten.

642
00:36:23,677 --> 00:36:25,613
See that man
bird-dogging the blonde?

643
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:27,275
Twinky Hebert LeMoyne.

644
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:29,478
That's the other half
of my security service business.

645
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,454
What's he doing here?

646
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:32,853
He's an investor
in the movie

647
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:34,357
and trying to get laid.

648
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:36,791
That's funny.

649
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:39,728
You like doing business
with Twinky LeMoyne?

650
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:41,264
It's good for me.

651
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:42,629
For him,
it's no big deal, really.

652
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:45,362
I mean, if there's a business
around here making money,

653
00:36:45,362 --> 00:36:46,926
you can be sure
he's got a piece of it.

654
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,142
# Well, I sit in my dark room #

655
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:59,309
# with tears rolling down my eyes #

656
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:00,372
Take a picture?

657
00:37:00,372 --> 00:37:01,418
What?
Picture?

658
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:02,816
Yeah.

659
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,116
# Come on, help me now #

660
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:32,526
I am General John Bell Hood,
commander of the Texas brigade,

661
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:35,087
commander of the
4th Texas Cavalry,

662
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:37,293
the 5th Texas Cavalry,

663
00:40:37,293 --> 00:40:40,394
and the 17th Texas Infantry.

664
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,697
Do you object
to shaking hands?

665
00:40:44,697 --> 00:40:46,367
Am I dead?

666
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:48,309
You don't look
like it to me.

667
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:50,279
You were at Gettysburg.
The war's over.

668
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:51,507
It's never over.

669
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:54,016
I would think
you'd know that.

670
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:57,144
You were a lieutenant in the
United States Army, weren't you?

671
00:40:57,144 --> 00:41:01,282
My head hurts.
My head...

672
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:02,689
sure does hurt.

673
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:06,127
Venal and evil people
are destroying the world

674
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:08,495
you were born in.

675
00:41:08,495 --> 00:41:10,591
It's us against them,
my good friend.

676
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:15,537
Don't compromise your principles
or abandon your cause.

677
00:41:15,537 --> 00:41:18,040
Do you know what's waiting
for me on down the road?

678
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,238
For one reason or another,

679
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:25,612
I find I have more insight
into the past than the future.

680
00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:28,243
Try to keep
this in mind:

681
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:30,150
It's just like when
they load their cannon

682
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,588
with horseshoes
and log chain.

683
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:36,182
You'd think the barrage
would last forever.

684
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:39,423
Then all of a sudden,
there's a silence

685
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:41,294
louder than the cannon fire.

686
00:41:41,294 --> 00:41:45,301
Please don't be alarmed
by the severity of my comparison.

687
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,706
Have a good night, Lieutenant.

688
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,186
Paramedics who brought you in

689
00:42:13,186 --> 00:42:16,062
said you were talking
about Confederate soldiers

690
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:17,100
out in the swamp.

691
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,192
It was an usual night.

692
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:22,000
What's the possibility that one
of those Hollywood characters

693
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,232
laced your Dr. Pepper?

694
00:42:23,232 --> 00:42:24,604
Do what?

695
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:28,577
The tox screen came back
positive for LSD.

696
00:42:28,577 --> 00:42:33,208
l-I need to talk
to the sheriff.

697
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:34,683
The sheriff
was here this morning.

698
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:36,583
You talked to him
for half an hour.

699
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:38,955
What'd I say?

700
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:41,253
Nothing that made
any sense to me.

701
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,631
When you reel
him in through the water,

702
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:54,160
his little legs and tail
wiggle like he was swimming.

703
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,001
Makes the black bass hungry.

704
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:05,441
How would you define
the idea of understanding?

705
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:16,023
Well, it's knowing something
and knowing what it means.

706
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,654
I think there's two ways

707
00:43:18,654 --> 00:43:22,096
of looking at
the idea of understanding.

708
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:25,533
One is, if you don't look,
you never will see.

709
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:27,537
And the other is,
if you look a little less,

710
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:29,470
you might see
a hell of a lot more.

711
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,477
You might not be over those drugs
they put in your drink.

712
00:43:36,477 --> 00:43:39,710
I know General John Bell Hood
of the Texas Calvary

713
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,614
just like he was
my own grandfather.

714
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:02,837
Are you accusing me
of working with the mafia?

715
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:04,771
When you do business with a man
like Julie Balboni,

716
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:07,037
you create a certain amount
of curiosity about yourself.

717
00:44:07,037 --> 00:44:09,011
I don't do business
with him.

718
00:44:09,011 --> 00:44:10,910
I don't do anything
with him.

719
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,677
I am a member
of a group of investors

720
00:44:13,677 --> 00:44:16,982
that have put money
into a movie production

721
00:44:16,982 --> 00:44:18,954
in New Iberia.

722
00:44:18,954 --> 00:44:22,618
Investing in the local economy,
that's all.

723
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,718
Are your employees
union people?

724
00:44:24,718 --> 00:44:27,628
No, they certainly are not.

725
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:29,666
You own half of a security
service with Murphy Doucet,

726
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:30,700
don't you?

727
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,395
That's right,
I certainly do.

728
00:44:32,395 --> 00:44:34,130
And your partner
in your security service

729
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,967
is a Teamster steward
over in Lafayette.

730
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,668
I think you're involved in
some strange contradictions,

731
00:44:38,668 --> 00:44:39,834
Mr. LeMoyne.

732
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:42,777
You will have to excuse me,
Detective.

733
00:44:42,777 --> 00:44:45,212
I have got
to lock up now.

734
00:44:45,212 --> 00:44:47,409
I have a lot of people
I take care of, you know?

735
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,117
Would you like
to have Julie Balboni

736
00:44:50,117 --> 00:44:51,848
for a next door neighbor?

737
00:44:51,848 --> 00:44:53,981
Would you like to have
your granddaughter

738
00:44:53,981 --> 00:44:55,457
working for him?

739
00:44:55,457 --> 00:44:56,754
Mr. Robicheaux,

740
00:44:56,754 --> 00:45:01,196
I can't express to you
how offensive you are.

741
00:45:01,196 --> 00:45:02,459
Did you get
that blond-haired girl

742
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:03,795
to lick your leg
the other night?

743
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:07,861
There's my business card.

744
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:09,371
Thank you
for your time.

745
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:19,883
Here you go, Dave.

746
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,714
Still 1965,
July, September, November.

747
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:23,753
Thank you, chere.

748
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:25,254
You're welcome.

749
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:26,289
How's Alafair?

750
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:27,687
Bien bonne.

751
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:29,157
Great.

752
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,798
A "nigger" you say?

753
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:12,028
DeWitt Prejean.

754
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:14,263
Black man
name of DeWitt Prejean.

755
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:19,005
Yeah, I remember
that son of a bitch.

756
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:22,739
What about him?

757
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:26,544
Were you on duty the night
somebody broke him out of jail?

758
00:46:26,544 --> 00:46:28,744
l-I was the jailer.

759
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,309
Jailers don't work nights.

760
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:32,184
They hire a man
for that.

761
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,590
Do you remember what
Mr. Prejean was charged with?

762
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,491
He wasn't charged
with nothing.

763
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:39,893
Never got to that.

764
00:46:39,893 --> 00:46:41,555
They busted him
out of the tank.

765
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:42,894
Not according
to the newspaper.

766
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:47,634
Lot of people wipe
their "asses" with newspaper.

767
00:46:47,634 --> 00:46:50,002
Newspaper said he broke
into a white woman's house

768
00:46:50,002 --> 00:46:51,040
with a butcher knife.

769
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,736
Was DeWitt Prejean
a rapist?

770
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,339
He couldn't keep
his prick in his pants,

771
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:01,646
if that's what you mean.

772
00:47:01,646 --> 00:47:04,380
Is it all right if I sit down
here, Mr. Hebert?

773
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,421
Sure.

774
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,592
You think her husband
broke him out of jail?

775
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,393
He might have
if he could have.

776
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:22,199
He was a crippled man.

777
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:23,933
Got shot up
in a war.

778
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:25,304
Where's he at now?

779
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,673
He's in the cemetery
out by the tracks,

780
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:31,941
east of town.

781
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:35,917
What about the woman?

782
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:38,819
She moved away,
up north somewhere.

783
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,856
What's your interest in this
40-year-old nigger trouble?

784
00:47:45,856 --> 00:47:47,556
I think I saw him killed.

785
00:47:47,556 --> 00:47:52,466
Where's the man who was on duty
the night of the jailbreak?

786
00:47:52,466 --> 00:47:57,701
He got drunk and got his self
run over by a train.

787
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,174
Wait a minute.

788
00:48:01,174 --> 00:48:02,940
What'd you say?

789
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,071
You saw what?

790
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,351
What you think I saw,
Mr. Hebert?

791
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,157
Hello?

792
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:18,023
You're a hard man to catch.

793
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:19,062
Who's this?

794
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,687
Sugar, it's Amber.

795
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:21,958
Don't you remember me?

796
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,431
Don't hurt my feelings.

797
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:25,127
No, I am sorry.
I don't remember who you are.

798
00:48:25,127 --> 00:48:26,692
What can I do for you?

799
00:48:26,692 --> 00:48:29,671
It's me that's going to do you
a big favor, darling.

800
00:48:29,671 --> 00:48:31,867
I am going to give you
the guy you want.

801
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,466
What guy we talking about?

802
00:48:33,466 --> 00:48:37,639
The nasty old pimp that's been
leaving dead girls around.

803
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:41,047
Meet me at Club Leon
in an hour.

804
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,821
Thanks for coming out, Lou.

805
00:49:23,821 --> 00:49:26,761
Yeah, who you supposed
to be meeting up with here?

806
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:27,854
Said her name was Amber.

807
00:49:27,854 --> 00:49:31,230
There's a hooker,
calls herself Amber.

808
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,700
What are we doing tonight?

809
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,329
I am going to drive around front
and have a look inside.

810
00:49:35,329 --> 00:49:36,997
I'd like you to be out here
to cover my back.

811
00:49:36,997 --> 00:49:38,871
I don't want to walk
into no setup.

812
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,236
What are you having?

813
00:50:07,236 --> 00:50:08,271
Has Amber been in?

814
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,396
Amber Martinez?

815
00:50:09,396 --> 00:50:11,065
Short, skinny,
little Puerto Rican girl,

816
00:50:11,065 --> 00:50:12,540
maybe weigh 100 pounds
sopping wet?

817
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,735
- Yeah.
- No, she ain't been in.

818
00:50:13,735 --> 00:50:14,834
What you drinking?

819
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:18,642
- Dr. Pepper.
- Dr. Pepper, yes, sir.

820
00:50:18,642 --> 00:50:22,207
I could call somebody,
might know where she's at.

821
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:23,718
Why don't you do that?

822
00:50:23,718 --> 00:50:25,948
Yes, sir. Right away.

823
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,758
Hey, Mama 'Ti, Amber there?

824
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,240
No word from Amber?

825
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,150
No, man,
not a word.

826
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:00,951
# I am a hog for you, babe #

827
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:06,929
# And I am running round your door #

828
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:08,328
# I am a hog for you, woman #

829
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,837
Get back in there.

830
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:31,284
Dave,
what the fuck's going on?

831
00:51:31,284 --> 00:51:32,821
Shooter fired at me twice.

832
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:34,117
I put eight rounds
in that Buick.

833
00:51:34,117 --> 00:51:35,783
I think
he's still in there.

834
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,333
Looks like she took
one right in the face.

835
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:50,202
What you mean, "she"?

836
00:51:50,202 --> 00:51:52,605
You just
popped Amber Martinez.

837
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:55,969
There's no fucking gun.

838
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,252
There's no gun, man.

839
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:21,863
I got this throw-down.

840
00:52:21,863 --> 00:52:23,132
Tell me to do it.

841
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,156
I opened up
on that Buick too soon.

842
00:52:44,156 --> 00:52:49,187
You thought your
life was at risk, Lieutenant.

843
00:52:49,187 --> 00:52:50,893
I hope you don't mind
my being here.

844
00:52:50,893 --> 00:52:51,643
No.

845
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,437
You shouldn't have remorse.

846
00:52:57,437 --> 00:53:01,170
A desire to live doesn't mean
you lack humanity.

847
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,735
Somebody's trying
to drive me crazy.

848
00:53:03,735 --> 00:53:06,213
Can't believe what I see
or hear anymore.

849
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:13,246
They say I killed
an unarmed woman.

850
00:53:13,246 --> 00:53:16,156
I think that would
probably bother me too.

851
00:53:16,156 --> 00:53:20,526
I keep seeing that woman,
the back of her head,

852
00:53:20,526 --> 00:53:24,465
her hair glued down
to the carpet with her own blood.

853
00:53:24,465 --> 00:53:26,297
Think about
what you just said.

854
00:53:26,297 --> 00:53:29,270
You're an intelligent man.

855
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,102
What does
your eye tell you?

856
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,270
I need help.

857
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,144
The wind's
out of the south.

858
00:53:40,144 --> 00:53:43,482
There will be thunder
by afternoon.

859
00:53:43,482 --> 00:53:45,418
It will sound
like Yankee cannon fire,

860
00:53:45,418 --> 00:53:48,150
but it will only be thunder.

861
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,394
General...

862
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,497
What time is it?

863
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,711
Why would Amber Martinez
be sitting in the passenger seat

864
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:12,543
of her own car?

865
00:54:12,543 --> 00:54:13,981
What did
the homicide investigator

866
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:15,039
have to say last night?

867
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,848
He told me
I am a hell of a shot.

868
00:54:17,848 --> 00:54:20,185
Everybody thinks
I killed an unarmed woman.

869
00:54:20,185 --> 00:54:21,747
There's not
any bullet holes anywhere.

870
00:54:21,747 --> 00:54:23,190
There's no casings.

871
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,127
And there's no gun.

872
00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:28,061
It was a setup,
Dave.

873
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:40,472
What y'all doing out here?

874
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:42,101
Can't be messing around
a crime scene.

875
00:54:42,101 --> 00:54:45,272
I am really just
an observer here, Doobie.

876
00:54:45,272 --> 00:54:46,372
Who's she?

877
00:54:46,372 --> 00:54:47,541
Special Agent Gomez.

878
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,482
This is part
of an FBI investigation.

879
00:54:49,482 --> 00:54:50,712
Do you have
a problem with that?

880
00:54:50,712 --> 00:54:54,484
Why piss people off,
Robicheaux?

881
00:54:54,484 --> 00:54:56,650
St. Martin Parish ain't going
to indict you over this,

882
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,559
but if I were you,
I wouldn't hang around here.

883
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:00,596
You might piss me off.

884
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,235
Well, from the size of
the wound and the impact of the round,

885
00:55:12,235 --> 00:55:14,641
I'd say a .45 killed her.

886
00:55:14,641 --> 00:55:15,837
Look at her head.

887
00:55:15,837 --> 00:55:18,813
I only use hollow-point
ammunition, Sollie.

888
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,852
It ain't no hollow point
passed through this girl's head.

889
00:55:25,852 --> 00:55:29,653
Her hair was stuck to the carpet,
the blood already dry.

890
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,492
Did she die in that car,
you want to ask me?

891
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,263
Her blood lividity tells me

892
00:55:41,263 --> 00:55:45,365
that she was dead before
she ever got into that car.

893
00:55:45,365 --> 00:55:48,536
If I can vacuum the Buick,
what are we looking for?

894
00:55:48,536 --> 00:55:51,603
I saw muzzle flashes
coming out that Buick.

895
00:55:51,603 --> 00:55:53,911
I didn't see no bullet holes
in that beer joint wall.

896
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,342
See what you
can find out.

897
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:03,617
What we waiting on here,
me to smoke this?

898
00:56:03,617 --> 00:56:05,160
Allons.

899
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,761
Thank you, Henry.

900
00:56:10,761 --> 00:56:14,326
Anybody else
got something to share?

901
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:15,962
My name's Dave.

902
00:56:15,962 --> 00:56:17,370
I am an alcoholic.

903
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:49,901
# I am..... I am coming home #

904
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,672
# What I feel #

905
00:56:53,672 --> 00:56:56,940
# You don't feel so all alone #

906
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,378
Want some cappuccino mix?

907
00:56:58,378 --> 00:57:01,975
You cops like coffee, right,
or a stereo?

908
00:57:01,975 --> 00:57:04,918
You know anybody been recruiting
girls out the parishes?

909
00:57:04,918 --> 00:57:07,479
Try the bus depot,
for starters.

910
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,881
But who's going to recruit?

911
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:11,153
Ever since Katrina,

912
00:57:11,153 --> 00:57:13,559
there's cash on the hoof
all over this town.

913
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:16,155
Maybe this guy does more
than just pimp.

914
00:57:16,155 --> 00:57:20,100
Maybe he likes
to hurt these girls.

915
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,899
Been two of them
killed already,

916
00:57:21,899 --> 00:57:22,995
maybe more.

917
00:57:22,995 --> 00:57:25,131
Talking about somebody
that operates way down

918
00:57:25,131 --> 00:57:27,108
at the bottom
of the food chain, Dave.

919
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:29,236
You think Baby Feets Balboni
might have something to do

920
00:57:29,236 --> 00:57:31,940
with something like this?

921
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,251
You're using the names
of local personalities now.

922
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:42,018
It stays with me,
Jimmie.

923
00:57:42,018 --> 00:57:43,854
You looking for a guy
who likes to kill hookers?

924
00:57:43,854 --> 00:57:44,694
Mm-hmm.

925
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,725
Don't sound
like Baby Feet.

926
00:57:48,725 --> 00:57:51,494
His outfit's running girls,
all right, but...

927
00:57:51,494 --> 00:57:54,332
they're not worth nothing to him
if they're dead.

928
00:57:54,332 --> 00:57:56,668
Try the bus station.

929
00:57:56,668 --> 00:58:00,231
Try Adonis Brown.

930
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:13,116
You, uh, ladies seem lost.

931
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:16,181
You're not from around here,
are you?

932
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:35,873
You will be able
to find some peace,

933
00:58:35,873 --> 00:58:37,537
I promise you.

934
00:58:37,537 --> 00:58:38,581
Don't sweat it.

935
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,754
I want you to make a public
service announcement for me,

936
00:58:46,754 --> 00:58:47,915
chere.

937
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:49,219
I know what it's like
to run away.

938
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:52,261
Praise Jesus.

939
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:53,727
There's a call

940
00:58:53,727 --> 00:58:57,755
for Mr. Adonis Brown at
the public restroom pay phone.

941
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,897
There's a call
for Mr. Adonis Brown

942
00:59:03,897 --> 00:59:06,134
at the
public restroom pay phone.

943
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:12,107
This is Adonis.
What's up?

944
00:59:12,107 --> 00:59:13,148
Hello?

945
00:59:13,148 --> 00:59:14,444
Uh.

946
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:19,582
What you want?

947
00:59:19,582 --> 00:59:20,332
Ah.

948
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,718
Don't do that, man.

949
00:59:22,718 --> 00:59:23,759
I ain't no threat to you.

950
00:59:23,759 --> 00:59:24,793
Look, I ain't got a gun.

951
00:59:24,793 --> 00:59:26,260
I ain't no trouble.
Uh.

952
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,819
I want to know
the name of the guy

953
00:59:27,819 --> 00:59:30,058
you have been delivering
all these girls to.

954
00:59:30,058 --> 00:59:31,361
This one's occupied,
by the way.

955
00:59:31,361 --> 00:59:32,628
Nobody. I ain't
bringing nobody to nobody.

956
00:59:32,628 --> 00:59:33,378
Uh.

957
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,866
You know the guy
I am talking about.

958
00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:37,907
Don't do this
to me, man.

959
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,657
Uh.

960
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:42,411
Tell me his name.

961
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:43,911
This guy
likes to hurt people.

962
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:46,744
You tell me his name,
this will all be over with.

963
00:59:46,744 --> 00:59:48,215
There's a...

964
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:53,051
bald-headed,
squirrel-faced white guy.

965
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:55,852
He carries a gun too.

966
00:59:55,852 --> 00:59:57,483
Nobody fucks with him.

967
00:59:57,483 --> 00:59:59,926
Is that the guy
you're talking about?

968
00:59:59,926 --> 01:00:00,676
Uh.

969
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:02,698
You tell me.

970
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,825
He's got juice.
That's all I know.

971
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:08,666
I don't know
his fucking name, man.

972
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,706
He connected?

973
01:00:10,706 --> 01:00:12,866
With the cops
or the mob.

974
01:00:12,866 --> 01:00:16,537
He's got to be
to stay in business.

975
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:20,014
That's all I know.

976
01:00:20,014 --> 01:00:21,209
Why you doing this
to me, man?

977
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,087
God.

978
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:31,087
I shit my pants.

979
01:00:31,087 --> 01:00:32,252
I can't
go back out there.

980
01:00:32,252 --> 01:00:33,295
That's right, Adonis.

981
01:00:33,295 --> 01:00:34,557
You ain't ever
going to go back out there.

982
01:00:34,557 --> 01:00:35,928
You're going
to treat that bus station

983
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:38,229
like it's downtown Baghdad.

984
01:00:38,229 --> 01:00:40,496
Not a good place
for you to be.

985
01:00:40,496 --> 01:00:41,798
Who the fuck are you, man?

986
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:42,997
You don't want to know
who I am.

987
01:00:42,997 --> 01:00:44,505
What you want to do
is start acting right

988
01:00:44,505 --> 01:00:45,541
and quit doing wrong.

989
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:46,575
I will kill you, Adonis.

990
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:48,543
I will blow
your Goddamn head off

991
01:00:48,543 --> 01:00:51,171
if you don't find
an honest line of work.

992
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:36,557
You stay gone
most of the night.

993
01:01:36,557 --> 01:01:38,719
You don't call.

994
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:40,558
I am sorry.

995
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,890
I don't deserve to be afraid
you have been hurt.

996
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:45,934
No.

997
01:01:45,934 --> 01:01:47,134
You don't.

998
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:50,967
But I am not
going to nag you.

999
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,854
I really need your help, Dave.

1000
01:02:13,854 --> 01:02:15,761
I really need help.

1001
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:16,799
Go ahead.

1002
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,265
You go ahead
and drown yourself, man.

1003
01:02:18,265 --> 01:02:19,528
I don't care.

1004
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:23,732
Dave,
I planned this all week.

1005
01:02:23,732 --> 01:02:26,036
The guy already charged me
for the boat, man

1006
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:27,235
Elrod...

1007
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:28,675
It's going
to rain like hell.

1008
01:02:28,675 --> 01:02:30,372
Now, why don't you wait until
after it quits raining,

1009
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,175
and you can go fishing
for black bass and perch

1010
01:02:32,175 --> 01:02:34,443
and bream right out here
in the bayou.

1011
01:02:34,443 --> 01:02:36,314
When was the last time you
caught freshwater fish

1012
01:02:36,314 --> 01:02:37,352
after it rained?

1013
01:02:37,352 --> 01:02:38,648
Oh, hell,
suit yourself.

1014
01:02:38,648 --> 01:02:40,484
You want to leave
that beer cooler here with me?

1015
01:02:40,484 --> 01:02:42,615
It came with the boat,
dude.

1016
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,523
Sure you don't
want to come?

1017
01:02:48,523 --> 01:02:49,895
Miss Drummond,

1018
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:52,434
you need to get yourself
off of that boat right now.

1019
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:55,266
Please,
it's Kelly.

1020
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,441
Watch the bend in the channel.

1021
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:01,670
It's about
three miles south.

1022
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,769
The water's been low

1023
01:03:03,769 --> 01:03:04,938
and gill nets
are on the left

1024
01:03:04,938 --> 01:03:07,642
floating on
Clorox bottles.

1025
01:03:07,642 --> 01:03:09,048
I got it.

1026
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,550
Hello?

1027
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:53,022
How far
down the bayou?

1028
01:03:53,022 --> 01:03:55,962
Well, that's that bend
Batist warned you about.

1029
01:03:55,962 --> 01:03:56,712
Oh.

1030
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,301
What you asking me, Elrod?

1031
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:02,565
Can you come
give us a hand?

1032
01:04:02,565 --> 01:04:04,970
Yeah,
I will come help you out.

1033
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,805
But I am also going
to bill you for my time.

1034
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,532
I got it.

1035
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:51,787
How'd you hit
the gill net?

1036
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:55,085
Didn't you see
the bottles?

1037
01:04:55,085 --> 01:04:56,124
Oh, man...

1038
01:04:56,124 --> 01:04:58,251
I am an idiot,
right?

1039
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,617
You want me to
get down in the water?

1040
01:05:27,617 --> 01:05:29,157
Yeah.

1041
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:31,352
Get down by the bow
and be ready to push

1042
01:05:31,352 --> 01:05:33,327
when I put the motors
in reverse.

1043
01:05:33,327 --> 01:05:35,626
Hey, are there
any alligators around here?

1044
01:05:35,626 --> 01:05:38,132
Oh, hell yeah.

1045
01:05:38,132 --> 01:05:40,100
They're not hungry, though.

1046
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,363
All right.

1047
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,472
Put on a life jacket, El.

1048
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:52,810
Okay, honey.

1049
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,406
I swam
the Trinity River once.

1050
01:05:54,406 --> 01:05:56,178
Watch out
for water moccasins.

1051
01:05:56,178 --> 01:05:58,083
What?

1052
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,551
Don't worry about him.

1053
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:05,958
That water's
not very deep.

1054
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:07,495
I have got to give him
a life jacket.

1055
01:06:07,495 --> 01:06:08,757
He'd drown
in a bathroom sink.

1056
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,499
Here you go.

1057
01:06:17,499 --> 01:06:21,737
It's nothing personal,
Miss Kelly.

1058
01:06:21,737 --> 01:06:24,405
But I think you're a very fine,
beautiful young woman.

1059
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,947
I am already soaked.

1060
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,519
I was burdened greatly

1061
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:17,327
by the deaths of those
around me, Lieutenant.

1062
01:07:17,327 --> 01:07:19,994
But incorporating
their suffering

1063
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:25,405
into our own lives does not
change the way of the world.

1064
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,318
An act of kindness,

1065
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:43,051
one as simple
as giving a girl my raincoat,

1066
01:07:43,051 --> 01:07:46,822
had resulted
in her death.

1067
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,929
The shooter
had left nothing behind,

1068
01:07:52,929 --> 01:07:54,833
no ejected brass,

1069
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,997
no recoverable prints.

1070
01:07:56,997 --> 01:07:59,234
We had no suspects.

1071
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:03,069
But one heart-sinking

1072
01:08:03,069 --> 01:08:07,809
and unalterable
conclusion remained.

1073
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:10,443
Kelly Drummond was dead.

1074
01:08:10,443 --> 01:08:15,149
And she was dead because
she had been mistaken for me.

1075
01:08:15,149 --> 01:08:17,658
The tragic death of Kelly Drummond,

1076
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:19,717
the longtime companion
of Elrod Sykes

1077
01:08:19,717 --> 01:08:21,558
and star of the popular
television series

1078
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:23,757
River Valley,
now appears certain

1079
01:08:23,757 --> 01:08:25,926
to have been a case
of mistaken identity.

1080
01:08:25,926 --> 01:08:27,696
Sources within
the sheriff's department

1081
01:08:27,696 --> 01:08:30,034
confirmed that
they now believe the fatal shot

1082
01:08:30,034 --> 01:08:31,869
may have been intended
for someone else.

1083
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,052
I am going to miss her, Dave.

1084
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,520
Ah.

1085
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,727
You want him
to stay here?

1086
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,233
Guy's in bad shape.

1087
01:08:59,233 --> 01:09:00,427
This is our home.

1088
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:02,664
Mr. Sykes just did
the rainbow yawn again.

1089
01:09:02,664 --> 01:09:03,864
Go to bed.

1090
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:10,109
The guy needs an AA friend,
or he's not going to make it.

1091
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:11,669
So what?
I don't care.

1092
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:14,773
Tell you what,
I am going to make you a deal.

1093
01:09:14,773 --> 01:09:16,010
First time he takes a drink,

1094
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:17,814
he gets 86ed
right straight back

1095
01:09:17,814 --> 01:09:19,980
to his movie star
trailer house.

1096
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,545
He pays for his share
of the food.

1097
01:09:21,545 --> 01:09:23,091
He does not
tie up the bathroom.

1098
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:26,492
He does not come in late.

1099
01:09:26,492 --> 01:09:28,928
Okay, but only
for a few days.

1100
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,370
Do you like
being a movie star?

1101
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:48,848
It's just a job, honey.

1102
01:09:48,848 --> 01:09:51,478
Really?
Yeah.

1103
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:52,612
It's like Dave.

1104
01:09:52,612 --> 01:09:54,451
You think he enjoys
enforcing the law,

1105
01:09:54,451 --> 01:09:55,547
catching the bad guys,

1106
01:09:55,547 --> 01:09:57,023
making the good people
feel better?

1107
01:09:57,023 --> 01:09:58,059
Yeah.

1108
01:09:58,059 --> 01:10:01,096
Yeah, well...

1109
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:02,221
I like my job.

1110
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:07,966
I am sorry
about Kelly.

1111
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:12,735
Me too, honey.

1112
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,462
Um...

1113
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:22,612
I have got 50 movie posters here
from Tears and Diamonds.

1114
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:28,055
I hate that picture.

1115
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:31,923
Well, 50 movie posters
signed by Elrod Sykes

1116
01:10:31,923 --> 01:10:33,427
will fetch $25,000.

1117
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:36,430
That's four roofs,

1118
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,988
eight with volunteer labor.

1119
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:40,901
Here's your felt-tip pen.

1120
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,445
The worst thing
a cop can do to himself

1121
01:10:55,445 --> 01:10:58,918
is eat his own gun.

1122
01:10:58,918 --> 01:11:02,355
Lou Girard
always called at night.

1123
01:11:02,355 --> 01:11:05,985
Tonight someone else
had to make the call for him.

1124
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,505
There's a half empty bottle
of Bourbon here on the dresser,

1125
01:11:21,505 --> 01:11:25,138
spilled bottle of Diazepam
here on the coffee table.

1126
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:30,508
Y'all writing that off
as a suicide?

1127
01:11:30,508 --> 01:11:33,020
Well, that's the way
it looks to me.

1128
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,181
He was in bad shape.

1129
01:11:35,181 --> 01:11:37,987
Mattress is covered
in piss stains.

1130
01:11:37,987 --> 01:11:39,891
The sink is full
of raw garbage.

1131
01:11:39,891 --> 01:11:42,396
Where's the gun at?

1132
01:11:42,396 --> 01:11:43,863
By the bedside.

1133
01:11:43,863 --> 01:11:45,331
If Lou Girard wanted
to kill his self,

1134
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:48,632
how come he didn't use that .357?

1135
01:11:48,632 --> 01:11:50,171
Because he was drunk
on his ass.

1136
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:53,208
Not an unusual condition
for him.

1137
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,403
He was helping me
on a case, Doobie.

1138
01:11:56,403 --> 01:11:57,638
And?

1139
01:11:57,638 --> 01:11:58,941
Maybe he found out something

1140
01:11:58,941 --> 01:12:00,572
somebody did not
want him to know.

1141
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:06,721
He was trembling,
eating pills every morning,

1142
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:09,451
in front of everybody.

1143
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:11,823
There's no big mystery
to what happened here tonight.

1144
01:12:11,823 --> 01:12:14,556
He was a good cop.

1145
01:12:14,556 --> 01:12:17,929
He was a sorry-ass drunk.

1146
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,564
Now, if you want to look
at anything else, hurry up.

1147
01:12:22,564 --> 01:12:24,902
I am going
to seal the place.

1148
01:12:24,902 --> 01:12:28,067
I appreciate you waiting outside
just for a moment.

1149
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:30,407
Matter of fact, I appreciate you
staying as far away from me

1150
01:12:30,407 --> 01:12:32,071
as you can possibly get.

1151
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,332
What had Lou found out
that had cost him his life?

1152
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:37,072
Hogman Patin knew a lot
and seldom said anything.

1153
01:13:37,072 --> 01:13:39,614
Now I got word
he wanted to talk to me.

1154
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,850
I started to think about
when I was in the pen.

1155
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:49,584
And your daddy,
he brought my mother food

1156
01:13:49,584 --> 01:13:51,250
and paid for her medicine
up at the store

1157
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,352
when she was sick.

1158
01:13:54,352 --> 01:13:56,261
You got something
to say to me, Sam?

1159
01:13:56,261 --> 01:14:00,028
What was the name of that nigger
you dug up out the sandbar?

1160
01:14:00,028 --> 01:14:01,865
DeWitt Prejean.

1161
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,774
He was fucking
a white man's wife.

1162
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,365
Start asking what
he's doing for a living,

1163
01:14:07,365 --> 01:14:11,402
and you will find the people been
causing you all this grief.

1164
01:14:11,402 --> 01:14:13,141
Who's the man
I am looking for?

1165
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:18,079
I said
all I can say.

1166
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,417
This still
the state of Louisiana.

1167
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:39,096
Why you keep
bothering me?

1168
01:14:39,096 --> 01:14:42,507
I need to know what kind of work
DeWitt Prejean did.

1169
01:14:42,507 --> 01:14:43,806
Done nigger work.

1170
01:14:43,806 --> 01:14:46,541
You know, he cut lawns,
cleaned out grease traps,

1171
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:48,845
got the dead rats out
from under people's houses.

1172
01:14:48,845 --> 01:14:50,748
What the fuck
you think he did?

1173
01:14:50,748 --> 01:14:53,151
Don't sound right to me.

1174
01:14:53,151 --> 01:14:56,714
I think he did
some other kind of work too.

1175
01:14:56,714 --> 01:14:58,453
You leave me alone.

1176
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,791
You're a pretty good
judge of character, Mr. Hebert.

1177
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:02,888
Do I look like somebody
that's going to go away?

1178
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:06,651
Hm?

1179
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,165
It was better
back then.

1180
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:11,331
You know it was.

1181
01:15:11,331 --> 01:15:13,340
What kind of work he do,
Ben?

1182
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,138
Drove a truck.

1183
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:18,702
Who for?

1184
01:15:18,702 --> 01:15:21,908
It was over
in Jeanerette.

1185
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,422
I brung her out here
because she works for me,

1186
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,652
because I can't get in and out
of the car good by myself.

1187
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,358
He worked seasonal
for a white man,

1188
01:15:38,358 --> 01:15:39,923
owned some big sugar mill.

1189
01:15:39,923 --> 01:15:41,833
I don't know
nothing about him

1190
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:45,431
except he was a brother
of that crippled fellow.

1191
01:15:45,431 --> 01:15:48,032
That's all I know
and nothing more.

1192
01:15:48,032 --> 01:15:52,706
You saying I do,
then you're a Goddamn liar.

1193
01:15:52,706 --> 01:15:54,578
Something else
you want to say?

1194
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,916
You got a fish
on your line.

1195
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,288
Batist.

1196
01:16:08,288 --> 01:16:09,038
Yo.

1197
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,834
How many sugar mills they got
over there in Jeanerette?

1198
01:16:13,834 --> 01:16:14,926
Just one.

1199
01:16:14,926 --> 01:16:15,970
Mm-hmm.

1200
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:24,901
Hey.

1201
01:16:24,901 --> 01:16:26,880
Come on in.

1202
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,383
Stopped by
to say good-bye,

1203
01:16:29,383 --> 01:16:32,420
give you
a going-away present.

1204
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,921
Where you headed,
Cholo?

1205
01:16:34,921 --> 01:16:36,150
Thought I might
go to Florida,

1206
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:39,489
maybe open a business
like you got here.

1207
01:16:39,489 --> 01:16:41,188
What you doing with
all that lawn furniture

1208
01:16:41,188 --> 01:16:43,629
in the back end
of your pickup?

1209
01:16:43,629 --> 01:16:44,469
Oh, um,

1210
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:49,329
guy at the Holiday Inn wanted me
to take it when I checked out.

1211
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:53,534
Said I'd kind of be doing
him a favor, you know?

1212
01:16:53,534 --> 01:16:54,576
Giving him a write-off.

1213
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:55,416
Uh-huh.

1214
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,974
You had some trouble
with Baby Feet.

1215
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,084
Yeah.

1216
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,556
I told him he was a douche bag

1217
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:11,218
and I wouldn't work for him again
even if he begged me.

1218
01:17:11,218 --> 01:17:12,658
That Cherry LeBlanc girl
was right

1219
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:14,195
when she
called him a needle-dick.

1220
01:17:14,195 --> 01:17:16,093
That's when the son of a bitch
comes across my mouth

1221
01:17:16,093 --> 01:17:17,131
with this big...

1222
01:17:17,131 --> 01:17:19,531
Now, wait, wait, wait.

1223
01:17:19,531 --> 01:17:21,125
What's this
about Cherry LeBlanc?

1224
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:28,608
If he tells you
he never knew her,

1225
01:17:28,608 --> 01:17:30,440
ask him about this.

1226
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,176
Julie forgot he told me
to take some souvenir pictures

1227
01:17:37,176 --> 01:17:40,221
when we drove over
to Biloxi last year.

1228
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:41,255
Is that her or not?

1229
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,123
Did Baby Feets
kill this girl?

1230
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,858
Come on, Lieutenant.

1231
01:17:53,858 --> 01:17:54,902
You know how it works.

1232
01:17:54,902 --> 01:17:57,336
A guy like Julie
don't do hits.

1233
01:17:57,336 --> 01:17:58,566
He says something
to somebody,

1234
01:17:58,566 --> 01:18:00,403
then he forgets it.

1235
01:18:00,403 --> 01:18:03,603
If it's a special kind of job,
maybe somebody calls up a geek.

1236
01:18:03,603 --> 01:18:05,112
Did Baby Feets
make that call?

1237
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:09,212
Start a photo album,
Lieutenant.

1238
01:18:09,212 --> 01:18:12,617
Make up
your own mind.

1239
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,993
What's Murphy Doucet
doing in this picture?

1240
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,974
What's wrong, Dave?

1241
01:18:33,974 --> 01:18:35,373
Got a loose ignition wire.

1242
01:18:35,373 --> 01:18:37,071
You got a knife
I could use?

1243
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:38,737
Yeah, I ought
to have something.

1244
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,621
This should do.

1245
01:18:48,621 --> 01:18:50,817
Some Mexican pulled this on me
in Lake Charles.

1246
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,254
I didn't know
you were a cop in Lake Charles.

1247
01:18:54,254 --> 01:18:55,455
I wasn't.

1248
01:18:55,455 --> 01:18:57,259
I was working highway
for the state police.

1249
01:18:57,259 --> 01:18:58,822
That's where
I retired from last year.

1250
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:00,959
Is that when you got into
business with Twinky LeMoyne?

1251
01:19:00,959 --> 01:19:03,004
No, we go back
a ways further.

1252
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,143
Thanks for the knife.

1253
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:16,943
What's the deal?

1254
01:19:16,943 --> 01:19:18,986
Lou Girard was
looking at her file last week.

1255
01:19:18,986 --> 01:19:21,022
Lou arrested her
on a prostitution charge.

1256
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:22,488
It wouldn't be
one officer.

1257
01:19:22,488 --> 01:19:24,320
It was a state police raid
on a bar...

1258
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,019
State police?
Who sent that arrest report?

1259
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:27,652
Oh, Sgt. Murphy Doucet.

1260
01:19:27,652 --> 01:19:29,754
Murphy Doucet.

1261
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,205
I'd missed it.

1262
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,978
Lou Girard had dug up
Cherry LeBlanc's arrest record,

1263
01:19:45,978 --> 01:19:47,639
and it had
cost him his life.

1264
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:53,317
But this was going to be the end
of the line for Murphy Doucet.

1265
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,968
I wasn't planting evidence,
I kept telling myself.

1266
01:20:49,968 --> 01:20:52,013
I was just removing it

1267
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,241
before a guilty man
could destroy it.

1268
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,312
Why the hell
are y'all here?

1269
01:21:01,312 --> 01:21:02,879
We're here because of you,
Mr. Doucet.

1270
01:21:02,879 --> 01:21:05,051
We have been checking
all the unsolved murders

1271
01:21:05,051 --> 01:21:07,253
of females in areas
surrounding highways

1272
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:09,456
during the time you were working
for the state police.

1273
01:21:09,456 --> 01:21:11,260
Rosie, I think
we just found the knife

1274
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:12,891
that he used
on Cherry LeBlanc.

1275
01:21:12,891 --> 01:21:15,300
That knife
wasn't there.

1276
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,428
I say it was,

1277
01:21:16,428 --> 01:21:19,029
and I say your fingerprints
are all over it.

1278
01:21:19,029 --> 01:21:20,267
I see.

1279
01:21:20,267 --> 01:21:24,403
You and this Mexican bitch
are in on it together, huh?

1280
01:21:24,403 --> 01:21:26,504
No, Murphy.

1281
01:21:26,504 --> 01:21:29,379
I am fucking you
all by myself.

1282
01:21:29,379 --> 01:21:30,782
Get your hands up now.

1283
01:21:30,782 --> 01:21:32,285
Get your hands up,
up against that...

1284
01:21:32,285 --> 01:21:33,912
up against that wall.

1285
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,916
Y'all are setting me up,
and I don't even know why.

1286
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:40,621
Think about it.

1287
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:41,662
Think hard.

1288
01:21:41,662 --> 01:21:44,528
Think all the way back
to 1965,

1289
01:21:44,528 --> 01:21:46,260
just before
that hurricane hit.

1290
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:49,064
Y'all made DeWitt Prejean
run with that chain

1291
01:21:49,064 --> 01:21:50,627
locked around his chest,

1292
01:21:50,627 --> 01:21:52,468
shot his leg out
from underneath him.

1293
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:56,706
You didn't notice the boy
that was watching you

1294
01:21:56,706 --> 01:21:58,302
from across the swamp,
though, did you?

1295
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,530
I don't know how you did it,
but you planted that knife.

1296
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:28,007
Time is always on
the bad guy's side, Rosie.

1297
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:31,068
We wait for warrants while
they deep-six the evidence.

1298
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,642
I didn't hear
what you said.

1299
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:48,553
Jesus wienie, Dave.

1300
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:50,154
Y'all done
tore this place to pieces.

1301
01:22:50,154 --> 01:22:52,222
You want to stay behind
and clean it up?

1302
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:53,665
I don't want to be
nowhere around here

1303
01:22:53,665 --> 01:22:54,702
when that guy
gets home.

1304
01:22:54,702 --> 01:22:55,997
You heard he's out on bond?

1305
01:22:55,997 --> 01:22:57,038
Screw that.

1306
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:58,970
He will be here
any minute.

1307
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:07,605
We got nothing.

1308
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,654
Alfie.

1309
01:23:14,654 --> 01:23:18,591
You know where your little girl's at?

1310
01:23:18,591 --> 01:23:20,491
She's right here
on my knee.

1311
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,457
You sound speechless.

1312
01:23:27,457 --> 01:23:28,502
Turn her loose,
Doucet.

1313
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:29,730
You don't want
to do this.

1314
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:32,034
I will make it simple
for both of us.

1315
01:23:32,034 --> 01:23:34,132
You take that knife
out of the evidence locker,

1316
01:23:34,132 --> 01:23:36,143
you put it
in a Ziploc bag.

1317
01:23:36,143 --> 01:23:37,610
At 8:00 tomorrow morning,

1318
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:39,271
you leave the bag
in a trash can

1319
01:23:39,271 --> 01:23:42,908
on the corner of Royal
and St. Anne in New Orleans.

1320
01:23:42,908 --> 01:23:44,246
You listen to me,
Doucet.

1321
01:23:44,246 --> 01:23:45,286
Think about this.

1322
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:46,320
You're a cop.

1323
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,548
You can skate on this.

1324
01:23:47,548 --> 01:23:49,317
We have been jacking you around
the whole time.

1325
01:23:49,317 --> 01:23:51,416
You lying
son of a bitch.

1326
01:23:51,416 --> 01:23:54,826
You won't rest till you
fuck me up every way you can.

1327
01:23:54,826 --> 01:23:57,160
You said
only one thing right today:

1328
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,665
I am going to skate.

1329
01:23:58,665 --> 01:24:01,293
And you're
going to help me.

1330
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,039
Finally
lost your mind, Dave?

1331
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:44,874
Young lady, you need
to stay away from this man.

1332
01:24:44,874 --> 01:24:46,140
Okay, let's go.

1333
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,738
Get out of here.
Come on, let's go.

1334
01:24:47,738 --> 01:24:49,977
Nothing good
on TV tonight, Dave?

1335
01:24:49,977 --> 01:24:51,985
Murphy Doucet
has my daughter.

1336
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,516
Did you hear
what I said?

1337
01:24:56,516 --> 01:24:57,558
That's too bad.

1338
01:24:57,558 --> 01:24:58,990
I don't like
to hear stuff like that.

1339
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:01,028
It upsets me.

1340
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:06,464
Hey, maybe you can get her face
on one of them milk cartons.

1341
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:18,870
Where's my daughter, Julie?

1342
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:21,899
Oh.

1343
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:24,810
Oh.

1344
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:25,853
Ah.

1345
01:25:25,853 --> 01:25:26,887
Uh.

1346
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,563
Where's Alafair at?

1347
01:25:39,563 --> 01:25:41,124
I cut Doucet loose.

1348
01:25:41,124 --> 01:25:44,171
I got nothing to do
with what he does.

1349
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:45,263
You get off
my fucking back

1350
01:25:45,263 --> 01:25:48,002
or I swear to God,
I will square this.

1351
01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:51,273
Cop or not,
I will put out on open contract.

1352
01:25:51,273 --> 01:25:52,813
I will cowboy
your whole fucking family.

1353
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:54,939
Ah.

1354
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:58,677
Your window of opportunity's
closing down.

1355
01:25:58,677 --> 01:26:00,186
Where's my baby girl?

1356
01:26:00,186 --> 01:26:01,984
I am telling you
the truth.

1357
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,387
I got nothing to do
with what he does.

1358
01:26:03,387 --> 01:26:04,425
He's a geek.

1359
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:06,858
I don't hire geeks.
I run them off.

1360
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,532
Last by God chance.

1361
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,495
He's got a camp
out by Bayou Vista,

1362
01:26:18,495 --> 01:26:22,566
almost at Atchafalaya Basin.

1363
01:26:22,566 --> 01:26:23,872
The deed's
not in his name.

1364
01:26:23,872 --> 01:26:25,071
Nobody knows about it.

1365
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:28,775
It's at the end
of the dirt road,

1366
01:26:28,775 --> 01:26:29,839
by the salt marsh.

1367
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,446
Alafair there?

1368
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,658
I hope to God
she's not.

1369
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,091
Alfie.

1370
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:18,642
Come here.

1371
01:30:18,642 --> 01:30:19,975
Did he hurt you, baby?

1372
01:30:19,975 --> 01:30:21,207
I told him
he better not.

1373
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:24,615
I told him
what you do.

1374
01:30:24,615 --> 01:30:27,813
I just shot a man
armed with a rolled-up magazine.

1375
01:30:27,813 --> 01:30:29,151
No, no.

1376
01:30:29,151 --> 01:30:31,191
He had a gun on him.

1377
01:30:31,191 --> 01:30:33,022
You just don't
remember it yet.

1378
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:37,294
You okay?

1379
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:23,543
Should I call my lawyer?

1380
01:31:23,543 --> 01:31:26,341
Mr. LeMoyne,

1381
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:30,316
I saw you
and Murphy Doucet

1382
01:31:30,316 --> 01:31:34,411
kill DeWitt Prejean
out on the Atchafalaya.

1383
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:37,786
I watched it
from across the swamp.

1384
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:41,756
Your crippled brother
couldn't kill DeWitt,

1385
01:31:41,756 --> 01:31:43,228
so you did it for him.

1386
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:48,699
Am I under arrest?

1387
01:31:48,699 --> 01:31:51,169
I think Murphy Doucet's
been blackmailing you with it

1388
01:31:51,169 --> 01:31:54,675
all these years.

1389
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,734
A lot of bad things happened
back in that era

1390
01:31:57,734 --> 01:31:58,836
between the races.

1391
01:31:58,836 --> 01:32:01,575
But we're not
the same people

1392
01:32:01,575 --> 01:32:03,617
we were then,
are we?

1393
01:32:03,617 --> 01:32:05,276
I think we are.

1394
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:11,422
You seem unable
to let the past rest.

1395
01:32:11,422 --> 01:32:13,289
It's been my experience

1396
01:32:13,289 --> 01:32:16,262
that you let go of the past
by addressing it.

1397
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,395
Please, leave.

1398
01:32:19,395 --> 01:32:21,332
It won't make
any difference if I leave.

1399
01:32:21,332 --> 01:32:23,529
You're going to drag this one
around with you all day long

1400
01:32:23,529 --> 01:32:27,597
every day,
like a log chain,

1401
01:32:27,597 --> 01:32:29,108
for the rest of your life.

1402
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,912
Have you no mercy, sir?

1403
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:35,976
No, sir.

1404
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,347
No, sir, I don't.

1405
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:04,774
Julie Balboni
finally went down,

1406
01:33:04,774 --> 01:33:06,813
but in a way
nobody expected,

1407
01:33:06,813 --> 01:33:09,372
in a beef
with the IRS.

1408
01:33:09,372 --> 01:33:12,078
They shipped Baby Feet
up to a maximum security unit

1409
01:33:12,078 --> 01:33:14,519
at Leavenworth, Kansas,

1410
01:33:14,519 --> 01:33:15,886
a place that,
in wintertime,

1411
01:33:15,886 --> 01:33:17,322
makes you believe

1412
01:33:17,322 --> 01:33:20,849
that sub-zero winds blow from
four directions simultaneously.

1413
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:28,800
Elrod Sykes
never took another drink.

1414
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,564
He brought Alafair to the set

1415
01:33:30,564 --> 01:33:32,902
and gave her a little part
in the movie.

1416
01:33:32,902 --> 01:33:34,999
Months later,
when the picture was finished,

1417
01:33:34,999 --> 01:33:36,338
he called us from California

1418
01:33:36,338 --> 01:33:39,243
to say that Alafair
had been his salvation.

1419
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:49,882
I thought in the morning mists
that curled around the bayou

1420
01:33:49,882 --> 01:33:53,017
I might again see
General John Bell Hood,

1421
01:33:53,017 --> 01:33:54,925
just a glimpse,
perhaps,

1422
01:33:54,925 --> 01:33:57,021
a doff of his hat,

1423
01:33:57,021 --> 01:33:59,566
the kindness
of his smile,

1424
01:33:59,566 --> 01:34:01,295
the beleaguered affection

1425
01:34:01,295 --> 01:34:03,929
that always seemed
to linger in his face.

1426
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,541
Then as the days passed

1427
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:12,738
and I began to let go of all the
violent events of that summer,

1428
01:34:12,738 --> 01:34:16,681
I came to accept that the
General, as Bootsie had said,

1429
01:34:16,681 --> 01:34:19,447
was only a figment
of my imagination,

1430
01:34:19,447 --> 01:34:22,216
there to remind me
out of the distant past

1431
01:34:22,216 --> 01:34:25,725
that the contest
is never quite over,

1432
01:34:25,725 --> 01:34:28,557
the field never quite ours.

1433
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:23,275
Dave?

1434
01:39:49,307 --> 01:39:50,307
