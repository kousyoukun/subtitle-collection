1
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,781
My name's Dave Robicheaux.

2
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,823
I'm an alcoholic.

3
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,654
Sometimes I'm tempted
to have a drink.

4
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,222
But I never do.

5
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,576
I hope this poor girl
was dead

6
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,246
before he started
carving on her like that.

7
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,518
This poor girl didn't have
a whole lot of good luck, Dave.

8
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,304
In the ancient world,

9
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,502
people placed heavy stones
on the graves of their dead

10
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:01,343
so their souls would not wander
and afflict the living.

11
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,279
I always thought
this was simply the practice

12
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,978
of superstitious
and primitive people.

13
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,078
But I was about to learn
that the dead

14
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,918
can hover
on the edge of our vision

15
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,391
with the density
and luminosity of mist.

16
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,554
And their claim on the earth
can be as legitimate

17
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,758
and tenacious
as our own.

18
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,034
Could I see your
driver's license, please?

19
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,332
My what?

20
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,565
Driver's license.

21
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,767
Please take it out your billfold,
hand it to me.

22
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,469
Oh, yeah, sure.

23
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,739
Well...

24
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,246
I was
a little careless back there.

25
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,372
I'm sorry about that.

26
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,609
You're Elrod T. Sykes?

27
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,116
Yes, sir,
that's who I am.

28
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,915
Step out the car,
Mr. Sykes.

29
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,922
Yes, sir.
Anything you say, sir.

30
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,929
Mr. Sykes,
I think you've been drinking,

31
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,487
and I know you've been smoking
marijuana in your automobile.

32
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,090
I believe your lady friend there
just ate the roach.

33
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,567
Ooh, well, that wouldn't
be good now, would it?

34
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,003
You're under arrest for driving
while intoxicated, Mr. Sykes.

35
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,404
I'll take you just down the
street here to the city jail.

36
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,670
I'll send a car, take Ms.
Drummond wherever she's staying.

37
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,870
But your
little red sports car

38
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,378
is going to be towed
to the pound.

39
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,413
This is bad news.

40
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,812
This is not on my agenda,

41
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,247
'cause we're just
starting a movie.

42
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,682
I've always enjoyed
all your films.

43
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,878
Ms. Drummond's too.

44
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,682
Take your car keys
out the ignition please.

45
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,724
El, do something.

46
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,530
I feel real bad
about this.

47
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,964
Can he make a contribution

48
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,197
to Mothers Against Drunk Driving
or something like that?

49
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,363
As an admirer of your work,
Ms. Drummond,

50
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,203
I recommend you don't make any
more mentions of contributions.

51
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,641
I recommend
you stay put.

52
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,906
Deputy will be along here in
a few minutes to take you home.

53
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,914
Allons.

54
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,185
You're not going to get sick
in my truck, are you?

55
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,227
No, I'm just fine.

56
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,854
I know where
there's a dead body.

57
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,255
What?

58
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,225
Looks like a big pile
of gristle and bone.

59
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,734
Where was this?

60
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,668
Way the hell out
in Atchafalaya swamp.

61
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:16,903
We had to pick up a scene near
the old Indian reservation.

62
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:17,943
I went to take a leak.

63
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,308
I saw it sticking out
of a sandbar.

64
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,911
Get back in the truck.

65
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,282
That swamp full
of old Indian bones.

66
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,654
Yeah, but...

67
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,124
Sorry, I didn't
catch your name.

68
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,717
Dave Robicheaux.

69
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,490
Mr. Robicheaux,

70
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,497
now, if that was
an Indian I found,

71
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,793
I was wondering
what he was doing

72
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,097
with a chain
wrapped around him.

73
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,740
Say that again.

74
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,174
It's a rusted chain
with links

75
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,575
as big as my fist

76
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:56,137
crisscrossed
around his rib cage.

77
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,883
Can you find
that sandbar again?

78
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,295
Yes, sir,
I believe I could.

79
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,266
I'm going to make
a confession to you,

80
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,461
Mr. Sykes.

81
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,164
DWIs are a pain
in the butt.

82
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,762
If I take you home,
can I have your word

83
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,967
you'll be in my office,
9:00 in the morning?

84
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,033
And sober?

85
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,080
9:00, you got it.
Absolutely.

86
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:32,174
Hey, I really appreciate this.

87
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,232
Elrod Sykes
and Kelly Drummond?

88
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,270
I want to go
to the set.

89
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,304
Sykes is a drunk.

90
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,338
He's huge!

91
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,203
His head
glows in the dark.

92
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,333
Maybe we could get
an autographed movie poster.

93
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,037
No way!

94
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,443
Not for you,
for the hurricane relief fund.

95
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,481
Okay, cool.

96
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,515
Please?

97
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,550
Will you hush?

98
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,084
I'll take her

99
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,642
and look out for her,

100
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,051
if that's
all right with you.

101
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,589
Maybe we could get Kelly
Drummond to sign one too,

102
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,147
pay for somebody's roof.

103
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,523
Please?

104
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,276
It's over yonder.

105
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,249
Hold on there,
Mr. Sykes.

106
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,979
Best put
some of this on.

107
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,248
We used to have
a lot of bats down here,

108
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,790
but the mosquitoes
ate 'em all.

109
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,758
That boy's a long way
from his Hollywood poontang,

110
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:21,793
ain't he?

111
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,123
This jackass
is objectifying you,

112
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,493
Mr. Sykes, because
he's had very little exposure

113
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,532
to the outside world.

114
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,759
Don't let it bother you.

115
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,239
Hurricane Betsy blowing through
here in '65 probably buried him

116
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,507
and Katrina unearthed him.

117
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,809
Why '65?

118
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:47,546
Hurricanes tear up this part
of the country all the time.

119
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,780
See that left shin bone?

120
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,084
Clipped in half.

121
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,387
That's where they shot him
when he tried to run away.

122
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,290
You a psychlc
or some bullshlt like that?

123
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,386
No, I saw it happen
about a mile from here.

124
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,090
Are you saying
that some whlte people

125
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,598
lynched somebody
around here?

126
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,260
When we get back, you're going
to have to talk to your sheriff,

127
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,099
get the coroner
out here now.

128
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,662
I don't know about y'all
over in Iberia Parish,

129
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,504
but around here,
ain't nobody going to be

130
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,101
real interested in nigger trouble
that's 40 years old.

131
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,771
What are you looking for,
Mr. Robicheaux?

132
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,543
I don't see any remnants
of a belt on his trousers...

133
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,918
or any laces
in his boots.

134
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,047
That boy probably did his
shopping at the Goodwill.

135
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,123
They never found him,
didn't even look for him.

136
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,657
Back then, with no body,
no missing persons report,

137
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,795
that sheriff didn't have
any reason to believe me,

138
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,807
must less get off his ass
and go to work.

139
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,367
You're not
17 years old anymore.

140
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,675
The trouble I have with you
is getting you away from work.

141
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,080
You've done everything
that you can.

142
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,209
You have no good reason
to beat yourself up.

143
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,015
Now drink your milk
and come to bed.

144
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm horny.

145
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,656
Bootsie was right.

146
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:06,061
What was the point of reaching
into the distant past?

147
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,761
Just yesterday, a young girl
had been eviscerated.

148
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,931
We had her name now,
Cherry LeBlanc.

149
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,536
Mr. Trajan around?

150
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,344
He's over there, chere.

151
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,386
We've been over this already
three times now.

152
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,887
Cherry's been working here off
and on for the past few weeks.

153
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,254
She's going to show up anyway
to listen to Hogman Pitan.

154
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,758
The girl had a real thing
for Hogman.

155
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,920
Some time around 1:00,
she put her purse behind the bar

156
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,623
and says she's going to go
outside for a walk.

157
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,893
You know she'd been
arrested for prostitution?

158
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,160
I didn't know that.

159
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,327
All right.

160
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,802
Okay.

161
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,099
You hired her
'cause you thought

162
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,141
she was an honor student
at LSU.

163
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,642
I can't say I care for the way
you're talking to me, Detective.

164
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,908
If I found out you've been
holding back information on me,

165
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,610
Mr. Trajan, I'ma come back here
with a warrant, Mr. Trajan,

166
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,152
for your arrest.

167
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,599
Did you know Cherry LeBlanc,

168
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,770
little white girl,
about 19 years old?

169
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,815
She work here,
ain't she?

170
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,873
Do you know if she had
a boyfriend, tante?

171
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,646
If that's what
you want to call it.

172
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,981
She in the business.

173
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,351
Was Mr. Trajan involved?

174
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,014
Ask him.

175
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,285
I don't think he was.

176
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,920
Otherwise you wouldn't be
telling me all these things.

177
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,088
She a sad girl.

178
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,725
I told her,
"A pretty white girl like you

179
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,393
could have anything you want. "

180
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,338
When that girl dress up,
she look just like a movie star.

181
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,204
Who was her pimp?

182
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,177
I don't know nothing else, me.

183
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,879
She wasn't about
to give the name

184
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,611
of some rich white man
to an old black woman.

185
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,245
What rich white man?

186
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,888
Some rich white man maybe...

187
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,487
get her out of the business
of selling jelly roll.

188
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,566
She say that just before
somebody done them

189
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,433
awful things
to that young girl.

190
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,984
The sheriff over
in St. Clair Parish

191
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,318
said, "Thanks a lot,"
for that pile of bones you found

192
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,620
out in the Atchafalaya yesterday.

193
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,319
They really appreciate
the extra work.

194
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,622
He need to find
a new line of work,

195
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,458
he don't like them bones.

196
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,760
Now, he said you're welcome
to come over on your days off

197
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,960
and run an investigation.

198
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,199
Their coroner's got them bones
now waiting on you.

199
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,570
Autopsy report came in
on that LeBlanc girl.

200
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,181
Looks like we're talking
about a psychopath,

201
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,912
somebody wired to the eyes
on crack or meth.

202
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,578
Maybe.

203
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,621
I think she knew him.

204
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,520
So you don't think
it was a John?

205
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,185
No, she left her purse
behind the bar

206
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,058
with all her condoms in it.

207
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,530
Cherry LeBlanc was
a working girl with ambition.

208
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,364
Maybe she misjudged
a business opportunity here.

209
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,371
Who's a girl like that
going to be in business with?

210
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,875
Um... Baby Feet?

211
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,943
Maybe Baby Feet.

212
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,660
What's happening, Cholo?

213
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,752
I thought
you was in the pen.

214
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,921
No, man.

215
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,362
Katrina,
she rinsed my hands clean.

216
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,922
The whole damn crlme lab

217
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,127
washed off
down the river.

218
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,329
Ain't got nothing on me
in New Orleans.

219
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,598
Doing fine, bro.

220
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,435
Besides that, they ain't
even got enough money

221
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,838
to lobotomize
guys like me no more.

222
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,104
What's going on, Dave?

223
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,510
I'm investigating a murder,
Julie.

224
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,548
No kldding.

225
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,407
Y'all worried about me,
Dave?

226
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,747
Hell yes.

227
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,286
How many guys
would burn down their own

228
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,380
father's nightclub with their
own father still in it?

229
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,162
You got to forgive me
if I get a little upset

230
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,098
by these
kinds of attitudes, Dave.

231
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,498
I come home
to this shithole.

232
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,129
I'm a prominent man
in the entertainment business.

233
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,971
I talk on the phone every day
to people in California

234
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,568
you read about
in Entertainment Weekly.

235
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,909
They ought to have
"Welcome Back Balboni Day. "

236
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,039
Instead,

237
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,447
I get treated
like sewer gas by you.

238
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,078
You understand
what I'm saying, Dave.

239
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,781
It hurts me.

240
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,119
Sit down
while I take a whiz.

241
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,250
Cholo,
where's your hospitality?

242
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,352
Get the man
a soft drink.

243
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,172
Here, Lieutenant.

244
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,604
Julie was telling me
about that time

245
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,301
that nigger
almost popped you with a.38

246
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,003
in the French Quarter.

247
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,012
Said he saved your life.

248
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,042
Weren't you and Julie baseball buddies
in high school?

249
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,517
Take the hint,
Cholo.

250
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,748
This guy's
not a conversationalist.

251
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,262
You working on that
Cherry LeBlanc deal?

252
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,126
What you know
about that?

253
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,758
All over
today's paper, man.

254
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,200
Julie and me
were just talking about it.

255
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,238
Sounds like you got
one sick fuck on the loose.

256
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,405
My meter's running,
Julie.

257
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,540
I want to talk about

258
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,140
that murdered girl
we found south of town.

259
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,378
Which girl is that?

260
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,352
Cherry LeBlanc.

261
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,946
I guess
I ain't heard about it.

262
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,150
You don't read
the newspaper?

263
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,214
I've been busy.

264
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,523
I can see that.

265
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,359
We used to be friends,
Dave.

266
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,194
I even maybe
did you a favor once.

267
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,496
So I'm going to line it out
for you and any locals

268
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,399
that want to get
the wax out their ears.

269
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,404
Louisiana's flat-ass broke.

270
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,167
New Orleans
is a mortuary.

271
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,868
And the bottom
of a toilet's got more appeal

272
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,773
than this shithole
in the bayou.

273
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,072
So they better
wake up to the fact

274
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,239
that we are dropping
close to $40 million

275
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,508
in Iberia Parish.

276
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,606
They don't like the name

277
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,207
Balboni around here?

278
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,616
We'll move the whole
fucking movie

279
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,153
over to Mississippi.

280
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,621
See how that floats
with those coon-ass jack-offs

281
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,679
on the Chamber of Commerce.

282
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,385
You're
in the movie business now?

283
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,556
Yeah, I'm producing Whlte Doves
with Michael Goldman.

284
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,099
What you think
about that?

285
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,964
I'm sure everybody
wishes you success, Julie.

286
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,731
I'ma do
a baseball movie next.

287
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,295
You want a part in it?

288
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,019
You can go on in.

289
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,858
You remember me, Dave?

290
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,691
It's Doucet, isn't it?

291
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,427
Yes, sir,
Murphy Doucet.

292
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,366
You got a good memory.

293
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,427
I was with the Jefferson Parish
Sheriff's Department

294
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,904
when you were with NOPD.

295
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,497
I guess you're
in the movie business now,

296
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,042
along with everybody else.

297
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,806
Yeah, I own half
of a security service now,

298
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,848
and I'm still with the Teamsters
out of Lafayette.

299
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,577
So I'm kind of doing
double duty here.

300
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,845
Is there some kind of trouble?

301
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,581
Where can I find
Mr. Goldman?

302
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,623
Right on the other side
of them trees.

303
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,919
I'll let him know
you're coming.

304
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,960
It's all right.
I'll find him.

305
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,360
We had two divisions of soldiers
march through that?

306
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,162
Looks like we're shooting
a bread commercial.

307
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,897
Where'd we get this cannon,
Toys "R" Us?

308
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,633
All right, I'm going to need
floaters in there,

309
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,141
one face down,
two belly-up.

310
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,267
Use some of the fat extras.

311
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,005
They'll look bloated.

312
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,046
My dead horse?

313
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,080
No.

314
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,673
Not on the call sheet?
Terrific.

315
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,342
We need some blood,
blood-soaked ground,

316
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,942
if that's what it says
in the script.

317
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,180
This is not
the nightly news.

318
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,223
They never show the blood.

319
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,258
This is an allegory.

320
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,418
We're not shooting
the fall of Vicksburg.

321
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,359
This is Baghdad 2007.

322
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,090
Copy that.

323
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,066
If people don't
connect the dots, fuck 'em.

324
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,398
There's a Detective Robicheaux
here to see you, sir.

325
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,735
So you're
investigating a crime.

326
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,671
Seen any crime
around here?

327
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,575
Only crime I'm aware of is
the air conditioning in my trailer.

328
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,876
You could fry an egg
on the toilet seat in there.

329
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,416
Then I've got a lead actor
digging up skeletons

330
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,510
in sandbars, exactly what
I need to be thinking about

331
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,747
while I'm shooting a picture.

332
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:54,190
Mr. Goldman, is Mr. Julius
Balboni producing this film?

333
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,250
Producing?

334
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,796
I must've really fucked up
in my previous incarnation.

335
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,731
Maybe I sunk the Tltanlc

336
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,201
or assassinated
Archduke Ferdinand.

337
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,862
I am the only producer.

338
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,998
So Mr. Balboni's lying.

339
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:13,511
Mr. Balboni is investing
some of his money in a motion picture.

340
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,410
Is that illegal?

341
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,209
Congratulations.

342
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,217
You in business with the man
that hung Fulvio Raneri's cousin

343
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,947
up by his colon
on a meat hook.

344
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,387
Do you recognize
this girl,

345
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,015
Cherry LeBlanc?

346
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,528
How you are, Hogman?

347
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,135
Come on up
on the porch.

348
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,398
Grab a chair.

349
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,839
You knew that LeBlanc girl,
didn't you?

350
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,438
I don't like to have nothing
to do with white folks' business,

351
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,849
but it bothers me
what somebody do to that girl.

352
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,854
I spoke to her about two hours
before she left the juke.

353
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,014
She said, "Hogman,

354
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,354
in the next life, me and you
going to get married. "

355
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,859
That's what she said.

356
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:40,762
I said, "Darling, don't let the
men misuse you for no chicken. "

357
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,062
She said, "I'm going
to have myself a town house

358
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,500
on Lake Pontchartrain. "

359
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,400
Was she mixed up with somebody
from New Orleans?

360
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,134
Probably some white-trash pimp
told her she special,

361
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,175
she pretty.

362
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,811
Instead,
she got herself killed.

363
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,212
You're mixed up with
that skeleton they found

364
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,547
in the Atchafalaya,
ain't you?

365
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,383
How do you know
about that?

366
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,855
When somebody find
a dead black man,

367
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:09,485
black people
knows about it.

368
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,095
I'm listening.

369
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,531
A blue jay don't sit
on a mockingbird's nest.

370
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,092
The mockingbird will whoop
the blue jay's ass every time.

371
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,901
What are we talking about here,
Sam?

372
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,531
I'm talking
about a black man.

373
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,803
And he was carrying on
with a white woman

374
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,003
who husband
he worked for.

375
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,980
I think them was his bones
you dug in that sandbar.

376
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,447
What was his name?

377
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,949
Who care what's his name?

378
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,077
I think he got
what he asked for.

379
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,643
I say, "Past is past,

380
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,383
and don't be
messing with it. "

381
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,754
You warning me?

382
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,190
What was
that white woman's name?

383
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,064
I got to go
start my beans now.

384
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,003
Alafair,

385
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,273
you got to keep this raccoon
out of my fried pie.

386
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,871
Next time he come in here,
I'm gonna swat him with my broom.

387
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,679
Tripod's just an animal.

388
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,050
Why don't you try kicking the
smell of cigars out of the yard?

389
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,750
Alafair, you shouldn't
talk to Batist like that.

390
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,486
But he threatened Tripod
with menacing violence.

391
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,085
Tripod's a raccoon, baby.

392
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,721
Apologize to Batist.

393
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,265
Sorry for what I said.

394
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,267
And I'm saying it
'cause Dave made me.

395
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,466
That's a beautiful child,
Dave.

396
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,840
By the time
she's 18 years old,

397
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,471
your hair's going
to be solid white,

398
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,674
if there's
any of it left.

399
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,529
This is great!

400
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,569
I love it.

401
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,435
You run a bait shop too.

402
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,939
How you doing,
Mr. Robicheaux?

403
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,238
We want to have dinner
with y'all tonight.

404
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,675
Oh, thanks, but my wife's
already cooking supper.

405
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:07,973
I was just on my way
over there to take a shower.

406
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,308
Well, hurry up.

407
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,214
We got reservations
at Clementine's, everybody.

408
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,809
The family has plans
for this evening, Mr. Sykes.

409
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:18,049
This is embarrassing, El.

410
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,990
I have a reservation.

411
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,549
Hey, I don't want
to cause any problems.

412
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,618
We'll just pick up
our liquids at your store here

413
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,994
and hit the road, okay?

414
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:31,559
Mr. Sykes...

415
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,762
you've been
driving drunk,

416
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,703
and you come to a cop's house
to buy more booze.

417
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,139
Why don't you hand
those keys to Ms. Drummond

418
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,180
before you hit the road?

419
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:45,850
Where's that beer at?

420
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,455
Hey.

421
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,785
You're a good man.

422
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,223
Y'all need
to be real careful.

423
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,722
Elrod's a shitbird,
but I love him.

424
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,704
It's all right.

425
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,966
Bad timing.
Put it there.

426
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,439
Cool.
Next time.

427
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,067
Hey.

428
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,132
All right.

429
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,146
Um, shit.
We'll settle up.

430
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,944
We'll settle up later,
yeah?

431
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,542
All right.

432
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,587
Other side.

433
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,613
Come here.

434
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,159
Come on.
Come here.

435
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,755
Elrod.

436
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,695
What?
Check this out.

437
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:34,732
Will you stop?

438
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,495
El!

439
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,468
Check me out.

440
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,034
S'more?
Made 'em myself.

441
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,206
Oh, thank you.

442
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,749
Elrod Sykes
is wearing Dave's jersey.

443
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:52,908
Can you believe it?

444
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,748
Now go do your homework.

445
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,879
Something to drink?

446
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,253
How about a beer?

447
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,191
I think we're out.

448
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,023
I'm sure there's
one in there somewhere.

449
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,454
I'm going to go feed
Alafair's rabbits.

450
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,022
You care to join me?

451
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,193
Yeah, yeah, sure.

452
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,817
Get back there, Leroy.

453
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:27,852
Go on.

454
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,524
You ever seen lights
in the cypress trees at night?

455
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,028
That's swamp gas.

456
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,530
It'll ignite and roll out across
the waters like ball lightning.

457
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,964
No, sir,
that's not what it is.

458
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,593
See these guys out yonder
by the lake.

459
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,605
They have lanterns hanging
from some of their ambulances.

460
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,870
A lot of those soldiers
had maggots in their wounds.

461
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,274
That's the only reason
they lived.

462
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,506
It's 'cause the maggots
ate out the infection.

463
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,979
You've been drunk
a long time, Elrod.

464
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,484
Pretty soon all the trees and
alligators will be talking to you.

465
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,646
A wild orchid
sang a song to me one time.

466
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,950
She had the prettiest voice.

467
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,285
Yeah, I wasn't drunk.

468
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,458
This guy, a general,

469
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,222
he's standing on a crutch
right by the water.

470
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,230
And he said to me,

471
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,199
"You and your friend
the law man must repel them. "

472
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,825
I think you're delusional.

473
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,767
You might want to think about
going to an AA meeting

474
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,238
with me one time.

475
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,242
Maybe I was
a little drunk.

476
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,210
What happened
to this dude's nose?

477
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,679
Coon bit him.

478
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,553
Lou Girard
always called at night.

479
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,460
I had picked him
out of gutters

480
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,726
from New Orleans
to Lake Charles,

481
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,825
held him
when he had the shakes,

482
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:55,601
driven him to AA meetings more
times than I could remember.

483
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,835
And he had done
the same for me.

484
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,103
Thanks for the call, Lou.

485
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,940
Yeah, when I saw
that electrical tape

486
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,606
around her hands and her feet,
or what's left of them,

487
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,116
I thought about you and that
LeBlanc case you got going.

488
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,550
Where she at now?

489
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,919
She's right there,
still in that barrel.

490
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,982
She got about
15 big blue crabs on her.

491
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:21,932
Coroner says, we move her,
she's coming out in pieces.

492
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,662
We're going to have a rough time
getting an ID, maybe.

493
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,795
Maybe by her teeth.

494
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,532
That's the poor bastard
who found her.

495
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,700
When did you
first notice that barrel?

496
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,075
About four
or three weeks back.

497
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,808
See anyone else out there
on that levee?

498
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,045
Yeah, about a month ago
in the evening,

499
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,713
I seen a dark-colored car.

500
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,655
I remember thinking,
it was brand-new, you know?

501
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,454
Why would anybody
want to bring their new car

502
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,051
down on that dirt road
full of holes?

503
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,324
You remember
what kind of car it was?

504
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,831
No, sir.
I'm sorry.

505
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:59,063
I just wish I hadn't been the one
to find that poor woman.

506
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,332
And, hey, I'm never
going to look inside

507
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,430
another barrel again.

508
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,474
Not me, no.

509
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,839
That'll do.
Thank you.

510
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,639
Officer Guidry
going to take you home.

511
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,304
Thank you.

512
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,605
I need a tow truck
to haul off a limousine.

513
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,869
Where about?

514
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,910
Can't miss it.

515
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,206
Right in front
of Chez Narcisse.

516
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,337
- When?
- Right now.

517
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,641
- Copy that.
- Thank you, chere.

518
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,419
You could get
the Roman Army down here.

519
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,822
One dlvision of these guys

520
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,689
could've knocked off
these squlrrel hunters,

521
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,353
had the Civil War over
in one year.

522
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,487
You know what?

523
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,759
Maybe we'll do
a Bible movie next.

524
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,528
Yeah, but how do you fight
a war with sandals?

525
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,399
That's... stupid.

526
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,768
How did they win wars
with sandals, hm?

527
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,382
What's going on, Dave?

528
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,984
Had a long night
last night.

529
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:08,726
Found a girl in a barrel down
in south St. Martin Parish.

530
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,199
She covered up
in blue crabs.

531
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,530
You ought to run her again.

532
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,570
We'll have gumbo.

533
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,137
You here
for breakfast?

534
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,606
Sit down.

535
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,885
You're pissed off
about some little thing,

536
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,084
so you have my car towed.

537
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,093
You need to quit parking
in front of fireplugs.

538
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,686
Fireplugs; I'm getting this kind
of shit because of fireplugs?

539
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,026
No, Julie.

540
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,090
I want to know what you have
to do with a teenage hooker

541
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,158
named Cherry LeBlanc.

542
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,828
Who the fuck
is Cherry LeBlanc?

543
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,894
You know
who she is.

544
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,337
You and Cholo
were talking about her

545
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,570
before I got to the Holiday Inn,
and you lied to me about it.

546
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,872
Calling me a liar?

547
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,810
You're a motherfucking lying
piece of dog shit.

548
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,814
I think this
sweet little town's

549
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,349
starting to rub off
on you, David.

550
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,112
Gentlemen, could you please...

551
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,675
I mean,
just not use that language...

552
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,244
Get the fuck
away from my table!

553
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,289
It's all right,
Mr. Meaux.

554
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,687
I'll be gone
in a second.

555
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,886
Oh, sad to hear that.

556
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,862
I don't know
none of these girls.

557
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:17,732
I don't have nothing to do
with your business.

558
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,100
You said some
ugly things about me, Dave,

559
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,503
and I'm going
to let it slide.

560
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:23,972
I'll call
a couple of cabs,

561
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,737
I'll pay the fine
on my car,

562
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,938
I'll buy some new tires,

563
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,345
and I'll forget everything
you've been saying to me,

564
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,543
because I got
a business to run.

565
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,687
Everybody's been
pretty polite here.

566
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,985
Keep it simple,
stupid.

567
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,925
It's time for you to let
people alone, Mr. Robicheaux.

568
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,430
Ease off,
Lieutenant.

569
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,627
This ain't good
for nobody.

570
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,364
Come on.
Come on.

571
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,371
You're losing it, Dave.

572
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,678
You need to get yourself
some better tranqs.

573
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,107
No, sir, I wouldn't
exactly call it a dead end.

574
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,698
You have a seat,
I'll be right with you.

575
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,069
Thank you.

576
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,478
It's $100-million contract.

577
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,573
He must've pocketed
$60 million, $70 million.

578
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,212
False load slips,
bogus waybills.

579
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,586
Balboni Trucking hauled
just about enough debris

580
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,624
to fill a Dixie cup.

581
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,125
Yes, sir,
we are trying.

582
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,525
Thank you.

583
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,688
Can I help you
with something?

584
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:53,731
I hope so.

585
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,265
This is my office.

586
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,698
Oh, my God,
I'm s...

587
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,599
I'm sorry.
I was...

588
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,398
a call came in for me
on your extension,

589
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,665
and I just...

590
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,173
anyway,
I'm Special Agent Rosa Gomez.

591
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,335
Everyone calls me Rosie,
so call me Rosie.

592
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,845
It's nice to meet you,
Special Agent Rosie.

593
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,779
"Your detective's
investigative missteps

594
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,822
are going to hurt you
in November. "

595
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,016
That's courtesy of that prick

596
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,252
Bubba Broussard
over at the city council.

597
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,918
So you called the FBI?

598
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,020
The FBI's been trying
to nall Balboni

599
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,588
for over a year now
on a FEMA scam.

600
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,567
And they still have
precisely nothing on him.

601
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,104
That's why I think
they're hoping there's more

602
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,833
to that Cherry LeBlanc case.

603
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,574
Now, Balboni
is throwing a birthday bash

604
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,876
for Mr. Michael Goldman
this evening.

605
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,109
I think you, too,
should attend.

606
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,454
There are 17 unsolved
homicides in Louisiana

607
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,251
that share some
similarities with this case.

608
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,487
And ten of them share
multiple common denominators.

609
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,994
All show marks
from being bound,

610
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,326
all young,
all working class.

611
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,387
One was a high school girl.

612
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,229
Two were waitresses.
Three had been runaways.

613
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,791
And four were prostitutes.

614
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:13,166
The FBI has an informational advantage
over Iberia Parish.

615
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,007
How do you like
that catfish court bouillon?

616
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,478
Uh, it's interesting.

617
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,153
If you found the remains
of a black man

618
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,689
and he had no belt,
no laces in his boot,

619
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,384
what speculation
would you make about him?

620
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,622
Obviously he'd been in jail,
a parish, or city holding tank,

621
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,823
some place where they were
afraid he'd do harm to himself.

622
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,331
That's what I think.

623
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,839
Mud bugs,
as advertised.

624
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,405
This one
has your name on it.

625
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:02,860
Get out of here.

626
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,274
Hey, Dave, you ought
to get yourself some food.

627
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,309
It's free.

628
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:23,677
Thanks.
I've already eaten.

629
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,613
See that man
bird-dogging the blonde?

630
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,275
Twinky Hebert LeMoyne.

631
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,478
That's the other half
of my security service business.

632
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,454
What's he doing here?

633
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,853
He's an investor
in the movie

634
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,357
and trying to get laid.

635
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,791
That's funny.

636
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,728
You like doing business
with Twinky LeMoyne?

637
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,264
It's good for me.

638
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,629
For him,
it's no big deal, really.

639
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,362
I mean, if there's a business
around here making money,

640
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,926
you can be sure
he's got a plece of it.

641
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,372
Take a picture?

642
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,418
What?
Picture?

643
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,816
Yeah.

644
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:32,526
I'm General John Bell Hood,
commander of the Texas brigade,

645
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,087
commander of the
4th Texas Cavalry,

646
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,293
the 5th Texas Cavalry,

647
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,394
and the 17th Texas Infantry.

648
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,697
Do you object
to shaking hands?

649
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,367
Am I dead?

650
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,309
You don't look
like it to me.

651
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,279
You were at Gettysburg.
The war's over.

652
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,507
It's never over.

653
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,016
I would think
you'd know that.

654
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,144
You were a lieutenant in the
United States Army, weren't you?

655
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:01,282
My head hurts.
My head...

656
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,689
sure does hurt.

657
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,127
Venal and evll people
are destroying the world

658
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,495
you were born in.

659
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,591
It's us against them,
my good friend.

660
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:15,537
Don't compromise your principles
or abandon your cause.

661
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,040
Do you know what's waiting
for me on down the road?

662
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:22,238
For one reason or another,

663
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,612
I find I have more insight
into the past than the future.

664
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,243
Try to keep
this in mind:

665
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,150
It's just like when
they load their cannon

666
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,588
with horseshoes
and log chain.

667
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,182
You'd think the barrage
would last forever.

668
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,423
Then all of a sudden,
there's a sllence

669
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,294
louder than the cannon flre.

670
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:45,301
Please don't be alarmed
by the severity of my comparison.

671
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,706
Have a good night, Lieutenant.

672
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,186
Paramedics who brought you in

673
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,062
said you were talking
about Confederate soldiers

674
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,100
out in the swamp.

675
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,192
It was an usual night.

676
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,000
What's the possibillity that one
of those Hollywood characters

677
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,232
laced your Dr. Pepper?

678
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,604
Do what?

679
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,577
The tox screen came back
positive for LSD.

680
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:33,208
I need to talk
to the sheriff.

681
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,683
The sheriff
was here this morning.

682
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,583
You talked to him
for half an hour.

683
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:38,955
What'd I say?

684
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,253
Nothing that made
any sense to me.

685
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,631
When you reel him in
through the water,

686
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:54,160
his little legs and tail
wiggle like he was swimming.

687
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,001
Makes the black bass hungry.

688
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:05,441
How would you define
the idea of understanding?

689
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:16,023
Well, it's knowing something
and knowing what it means.

690
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,654
I think there's two ways

691
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:22,096
of looking at
the idea of understanding.

692
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,533
One is, if you don't look,
you never will see.

693
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,537
And the other is,
if you look a little less,

694
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,470
you might see
a hell of a lot more.

695
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,477
You might not be over those drugs
they put in your drink.

696
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,710
I know General John Bell Hood
of the Texas Calvary

697
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,614
just like he was
my own grandfather.

698
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,837
Are you accusing me
of working with the mafia?

699
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,771
When you do business with a man
like Julle Balboni,

700
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,037
you create a certain amount
of curiosity about yourself.

701
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,011
I don't do business
with him.

702
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,910
I don't do anything
with him.

703
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,677
I'm a member
of a group of investors

704
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,982
that have put money
into a movie production

705
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,954
in New Iberia.

706
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:22,618
Investing in the local economy,
that's all.

707
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,718
Are your employees
union people?

708
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,628
No, they certainly are not.

709
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,666
You own half of a security
service with Murphy Doucet,

710
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,700
don't you?

711
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,395
That's right,
I certainly do.

712
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,130
And your partner
in your security service

713
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,967
is a Teamster steward
over in Lafayette.

714
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,668
I think you're involved in
some strange contradictions,

715
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:39,834
Mr. LeMoyne.

716
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,777
You'll have to excuse me,
Detective.

717
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,212
I've got
to lock up now.

718
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,409
I have a lot of people
I take care of, you know?

719
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,117
Would you like
to have Julie Balboni

720
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,848
for a next door neighbor?

721
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,981
Would you like to have
your granddaughter

722
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,457
working for him?

723
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,754
Mr. Roblcheaux,

724
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:01,196
I can't express to you
how offensive you are.

725
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,459
Did you get
that blond-haired girl

726
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,795
to lick your leg
the other night?

727
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:07,861
There's my business card.

728
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,371
Thank you
for your time.

729
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:19,883
Here you go, Dave.

730
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,714
Still 1965,
July, September, November.

731
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:23,753
Thank you, chere.

732
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,254
You're welcome.

733
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,289
How's Alafair?

734
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,687
Blen bonne.

735
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,157
Great.

736
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,798
A nigger,
you say?

737
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,028
DeWitt Prejean.

738
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,263
Black man
name of DeWitt Prejean.

739
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:19,005
Yeah, I remember
that son of a bitch.

740
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:22,739
What about him?

741
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:26,544
Were you on duty the night
somebody broke him out of jail?

742
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,744
I was the jailer.

743
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,309
Jailers don't work nights.

744
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,184
They hire a man
for that.

745
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,590
Do you remember what
Mr. Prejean was charged with?

746
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,491
He wasn't charged
with nothing.

747
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,893
Never got to that.

748
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,555
They busted him
out of the tank.

749
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,894
Not according
to the newspaper.

750
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,634
Lot of people wipe
their asses with newspaper.

751
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:50,002
Newspaper said he broke
into a white woman's house

752
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:51,040
with a butcher knife.

753
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,736
Was DeWitt Prejean
a rapist?

754
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,339
He couldn't keep
his prick in his pants,

755
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,646
if that's what you mean.

756
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,380
Is it all right if I sit down
here, Mr. Hebert?

757
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,421
Sure.

758
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,592
You think her husband
broke him out of jail?

759
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,393
He might have
if he could've.

760
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,199
He was a crippled man.

761
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,933
Got shot up
in a war.

762
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,304
Where's he at now?

763
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,673
He's in the cemetery
out by the tracks,

764
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:31,941
east of town.

765
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,917
What about the woman?

766
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,819
She moved away,
up north somewhere.

767
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,856
What's your interest in this
40-year-old nigger trouble?

768
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,556
I think I saw him killed.

769
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:52,466
Where's the man who was on duty
the night of the jailbreak?

770
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:57,701
He got drunk and got his self
run over by a train.

771
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,174
Wait a minute.

772
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,940
What'd you say?

773
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,071
You saw what?

774
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,351
What you think I saw,
Mr. Hebert?

775
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,157
Hello?

776
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,023
You're a hard man to catch.

777
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,062
Who's this?

778
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,687
Sugar, it's Amber.

779
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:21,958
Don't you remember me?

780
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,431
Don't hurt my feelings.

781
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,127
No, I'm sorry.
I don't remember who you are.

782
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,692
What can I do for you?

783
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,671
It's me that's going to do you
a big favor, darling.

784
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,867
I'm going to give you
the guy you want.

785
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,466
What guy we talking about?

786
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:37,639
The nasty old plmp that's been
leaving dead girls around.

787
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:41,047
Meet me at Club Leon
in an hour.

788
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,821
Thanks for coming out, Lou.

789
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,761
Yeah, who you supposed
to be meeting up with here?

790
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,854
Said her name was Amber.

791
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:31,230
There's a hooker,
calls herself Amber.

792
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,700
What are we doing tonight?

793
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:35,329
I'm going to drive around front
and have a look inside.

794
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:36,997
I'd like you to be out here
to cover my back.

795
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,871
I don't want to walk
into no setup.

796
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,236
What are you having?

797
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,271
Has Amber been in?

798
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,396
Amber Martinez?

799
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,065
Short, skinny,
little Puerto Rican girl,

800
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,540
maybe weigh 100 pounds
sopping wet?

801
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,735
- Yeah.
- No, she ain't been in.

802
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,834
What you drinking?

803
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,642
- Dr. Pepper.
- Dr. Pepper, yes, sir.

804
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:22,207
I could call somebody,
might know where she's at.

805
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:23,718
Why don't you do that?

806
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,948
Yes, sir.
Right away.

807
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,758
Hey, Mama 'Ti,
Amber there?

808
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,240
No word from Amber?

809
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:57,150
No, man,
not a word.

810
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,837
Get back in there!

811
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:31,284
Dave,
what the fuck's going on?

812
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:32,821
Shooter fired at me twice.

813
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,117
I put eight rounds
in that Buick.

814
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,783
I think
he's still in there.

815
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,333
Looks like she took one
right in the face.

816
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:50,202
What you mean, "she"?

817
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,605
You just popped
Amber Martinez.

818
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:55,969
There's no fucking gun.

819
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,252
There's no gun, man.

820
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:21,863
I got this throw-down.

821
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:23,132
Tell me to do it.

822
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,156
I opened up
on that Buick too soon.

823
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:49,187
You thought your life
was at rlsk, Lleutenant.

824
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,893
I hope you don't mind
my being here.

825
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,332
No.

826
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,437
You shouldn't have remorse.

827
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:01,170
A desire to live doesn't mean
you lack humanity.

828
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,735
Somebody's trying
to drive me crazy.

829
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,213
Can't believe what I see
or hear anymore.

830
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:13,246
They say I killed
an unarmed woman.

831
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,156
I think that would
probably bother me too.

832
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:20,526
I keep seeing that woman,
the back of her head,

833
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:24,465
her hair glued down
to the carpet with her own blood.

834
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,297
Think about
what you just said.

835
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,270
You're an intelligent man.

836
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,102
What does
your eye tell you?

837
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,270
I need help.

838
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,144
The wind's
out of the south.

839
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,482
There'll be thunder
by afternoon.

840
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,418
It'll sound
like Yankee cannon fire,

841
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,150
but it'll only be thunder.

842
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,394
General...

843
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,497
What time is it?

844
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,711
Why would Amber Martinez
be sitting in the passenger seat

845
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,543
of her own car?

846
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:13,981
What did
the homicide investigator

847
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,039
have to say last night?

848
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,848
He told me
I'm a hell of a shot.

849
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,185
Everybody thinks
I killed an unarmed woman.

850
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,747
There's not
any bullet holes anywhere.

851
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,190
There's no casings.

852
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,127
And there's no gun.

853
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:28,061
It was a setup, Dave.

854
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:40,472
What y'all doing out here?

855
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,101
Can't be messing around
a crime scene.

856
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:45,272
I'm really just
an observer here, Doobie.

857
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,372
Who's she?

858
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,541
Speclal Agent Gomez.

859
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,482
This is part
of an FBI investigation.

860
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:50,712
Do you have
a problem with that?

861
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,484
Why piss people off,
Robicheaux?

862
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,650
St. Martin Parish ain't going
to indict you over this,

863
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,559
but if I were you,
I wouldn't hang around here.

864
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,596
You might piss me off.

865
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,235
Well, from the size of the wound
and the impact of the round,

866
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,641
I'd say a.45 killed her.

867
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:15,837
Look at her head.

868
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,813
I only use hollow-point
ammunition, Sollie.

869
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,852
It ain't no hollow point
passed through this girl's head.

870
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:29,653
Her hair was stuck to the carpet,
the blood already dry.

871
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,492
Did she die in that car,
you want to ask me?

872
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,263
Her blood lividity tells me

873
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,365
that she was dead before
she ever got into that car.

874
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:48,536
If I can vacuum the Buick,
what are we looking for?

875
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:51,603
I saw muzzle flashes
coming out that Buick.

876
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,911
I didn't see no bullet holes
in that beer joint wall.

877
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,342
See what you
can find out.

878
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:03,617
What we waiting on here,
me to smoke this?

879
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,160
Allons.

880
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,761
Thank you, Henry.

881
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:14,326
Anybody else
got something to share?

882
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,962
My name's Dave.

883
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,370
I'm an alcoholic.

884
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,378
Want some cappuccino mix?

885
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:01,975
You cops like coffee, right,
or a stereo?

886
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,918
You know anybody been recruiting
girls out the parishes?

887
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,479
Try the bus depot,
for starters.

888
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,881
But who's going to recruit?

889
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,153
Ever since Katrina,

890
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,559
there's cash on the hoof
all over this town.

891
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,155
Maybe this guy does more
than just pimp.

892
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:20,100
Maybe he likes
to hurt these girls.

893
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,899
Been two of them
killed already,

894
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:22,995
maybe more.

895
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:25,131
Talking about somebody
that operates way down

896
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,108
at the bottom
of the food chain, Dave.

897
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,236
You think Baby Feets Balboni
might have something to do

898
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,940
with something like this?

899
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,251
You're using the names
of local personalities now.

900
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,018
It stays with me,
Jimmie.

901
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,854
You looking for a guy
who likes to kill hookers?

902
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,725
Don't sound
like Baby Feet.

903
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,494
His outfit's running girls,
all right, but...

904
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,332
they're not worth nothing to him
if they're dead.

905
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,668
Try the bus station.

906
00:57:56,739 --> 00:58:00,231
Try Adonis Brown.

907
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:13,116
You, uh,
ladies seem lost.

908
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:16,181
You're not from around here,
are you?

909
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:35,873
You'll be able
to find some peace,

910
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,537
I promlse you.

911
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:38,581
Don't sweat it.

912
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,754
I want you to make a public
service announcement for me,

913
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:47,915
chere.

914
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,219
I know what it's like
to run away.

915
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,261
Praise Jesus.

916
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,727
There's a call

917
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:57,755
for Mr. Adonls Brown at
the publlc restroom pay phone.

918
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,897
There's a call
for Mr. Adonls Brown

919
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,134
at the
publlc restroom pay phone.

920
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:12,107
This is Adonis.
What's up?

921
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,148
Hello?

922
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:19,582
What you want?

923
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,718
Don't do that, man.

924
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:23,759
I ain't no threat to you.

925
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:24,793
Look, I ain't got a gun.

926
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,260
I ain't no trouble.

927
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,819
I want to know
the name of the guy

928
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,058
you've been delivering
all these girls to.

929
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,361
This one's occupied,
by the way.

930
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:32,628
Nobody. I ain't
bringing nobody to nobody.

931
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,866
You know the guy
I'm talking about.

932
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,907
Don't do this
to me, man.

933
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:42,411
Tell me his name.

934
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,911
This guy
likes to hurt people.

935
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,744
You tell me his name,
this'll all be over with.

936
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,215
There's a...

937
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:53,051
baid-headed,
squirrel-faced white guy.

938
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:55,852
He carries a gun too.

939
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,483
Nobody fucks with him.

940
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,926
Is that the guy
you're talking about?

941
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:02,698
You tell me.

942
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,825
He's got juice.
That's all I know.

943
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,666
I don't know
his fucking name, man.

944
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,706
He connected?

945
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,866
With the cops
or the mob.

946
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,537
He's got to be
to stay in business.

947
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,014
That's all I know.

948
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,209
Why you doing this
to me, man?

949
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:27,853
God.

950
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:31,087
I shit my pants.

951
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,252
I can't
go back out there.

952
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,295
That's right, Adonis.

953
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,557
You ain't ever
gonna go back out there.

954
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,928
You're going
to treat that bus station

955
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,229
like it's downtown Baghdad.

956
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,496
Not a good place
for you to be.

957
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,798
Who the fuck are you, man?

958
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:42,997
You don't want to know
who I am.

959
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:44,505
What you want to do
is start acting right

960
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:45,541
and quit doing wrong.

961
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:46,575
I'll kill you, Adonis.

962
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,543
I'll blow
your Goddamn head off

963
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:51,171
if you don't find
an honest line of work.

964
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:36,557
You stay gone
most of the night.

965
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,719
You don't call.

966
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,558
I'm sorry.

967
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,890
I don't deserve to be afraid
you've been hurt.

968
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:45,934
No.

969
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:49,199
You don't.

970
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:50,967
But I'm not
going to nag you.

971
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,854
I really need your help, Dave.

972
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,761
I really need help.

973
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:16,799
Go ahead.

974
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,265
You go ahead
and drown yourself, man.

975
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,528
I don't care.

976
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:23,732
Dave,
I planned this all week.

977
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,036
The guy already charged me
for the boat, man

978
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,235
Elrod...

979
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,675
It's going
to rain like hell.

980
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,372
Now, why don't you wait until
after it quits raining,

981
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,175
and you can go fishing
for black bass and perch

982
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,443
and bream right out here
in the bayou.

983
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,314
When was the last time you
caught freshwater fish

984
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:37,352
after it rained?

985
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,648
Oh, hell,
suit yourself.

986
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,484
You want to leave
that beer cooler here with me?

987
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,615
It came with the boat,
dude.

988
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,523
Sure you don't
want to come?

989
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,895
Miss Drummond,

990
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,434
you need to get yourself
off of that boat right now.

991
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,266
Please,
it's Kelly.

992
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,441
Watch the bend
in the channel.

993
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,670
It's about
three miles south.

994
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,769
The water's been low

995
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:04,938
and gill nets
are on the left

996
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,642
floating on
Clorox bottles.

997
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,048
I got it.

998
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,550
Hello?

999
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:53,022
How far
down the bayou?

1000
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,962
Well, that's that bend
Batist warned you about.

1001
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,301
What you asking me, Elrod?

1002
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,565
Can you come
give us a hand?

1003
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,970
Yeah,
I'll come help you out.

1004
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,805
But I am also going
to bill you for my time.

1005
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,532
I got it.

1006
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:51,787
How'd you hit
the gill net?

1007
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:55,085
Dldn't you see
the bottles?

1008
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,124
Oh, man...

1009
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,251
I'm an idiot,
right?

1010
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,617
You want me to get down
in the water?

1011
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,157
Yeah.

1012
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,352
Get down by the bow
and be ready to push

1013
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,327
when I put the motors
in reverse.

1014
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,626
Hey, are there
any alligators around here?

1015
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,132
Oh, hell yeah.

1016
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,100
They're not hungry, though.

1017
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:41,363
All right.

1018
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,472
Put on a life jacket, El.

1019
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:52,810
Okay, honey.

1020
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,406
I swam
the Trinity River once.

1021
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,178
Watch out
for water moccasins.

1022
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,083
What?

1023
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,551
Don't worry about him.

1024
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:05,958
That water's
not very deep.

1025
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:07,495
I've got to give him
a life jacket.

1026
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,757
He'd drown
in a bathroom sink.

1027
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,499
Here you go.

1028
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:21,737
It's nothing personal,
Miss Kelly.

1029
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,405
But I think you're a very fine,
beautiful young woman.

1030
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,947
I'm already soaked.

1031
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,519
I was burdened greatly

1032
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:17,327
by the deaths of those
around me, Lieutenant.

1033
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,994
But incorporating
their suffering

1034
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:25,405
into our own lives does not
change the way of the world.

1035
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,318
An act of kindness,

1036
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:43,051
one as simple
as giving a girl my raincoat,

1037
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,822
had resulted
in her death.

1038
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,929
The shooter
had left nothing behind,

1039
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,833
no ejected brass,

1040
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,997
no recoverable prints.

1041
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,234
We had no suspects.

1042
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,069
But one heart-sinking

1043
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:07,809
and unalterable
conclusion remained.

1044
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,443
Kelly Drummond was dead.

1045
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:15,149
And she was dead because
she had been mistaken for me.

1046
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,658
The tragic death
of Kelly Drummond,

1047
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,717
the longtime companion
of Elrod Sykes

1048
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,558
and star of the popular
television series

1049
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,757
River Valley,
now appears certain

1050
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,926
to have been a case
of mistaken identity.

1051
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,696
Sources within
the sheriff's department

1052
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,034
conflrmed that
they now belleve the fatal shot

1053
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,869
may have been intended
for someone else.

1054
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,052
I'm going to miss her, Dave.

1055
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,727
You want him
to stay here?

1056
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,233
Guy's in bad shape.

1057
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,427
This is our home.

1058
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,664
Mr. Sykes just did
the rainbow yawn again.

1059
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:03,864
Go to bed.

1060
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:10,109
The guy needs an AA friend,
or he's not going to make it.

1061
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,669
So what?
I don't care.

1062
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:14,773
Tell you what,
I'm going to make you a deal.

1063
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,010
First time he takes a drink,

1064
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,814
he gets 86ed
right straight back

1065
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,980
to his movie star
trailer house.

1066
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:21,545
He pays for his share
of the food.

1067
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,091
He does not
tie up the bathroom.

1068
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,492
He does not come in late.

1069
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,928
Okay, but only
for a few days.

1070
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,370
Do you like
being a movie star?

1071
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:48,848
It's just a job, honey.

1072
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,478
Really?
Yeah.

1073
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:52,612
It's like Dave.

1074
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,451
You think he enjoys
enforcing the law,

1075
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,547
catching the bad guys,

1076
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,023
making the good people
feel better?

1077
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:58,059
Yeah.

1078
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:01,096
Yeah, well...

1079
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:02,221
I like my job.

1080
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:07,966
I'm sorry
about Kelly.

1081
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:12,735
Me too, honey.

1082
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:22,612
I've got 50 movie posters here
from Tears and Diamonds.

1083
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:28,055
I hate that picture.

1084
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:31,923
Well, 50 movie posters
signed by Elrod Sykes

1085
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,427
will fetch $25,000.

1086
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:36,430
That's four roofs,

1087
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:37,988
eight with volunteer labor.

1088
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:40,901
Here's your felt-tip pen.

1089
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,445
The worst thing
a cop can do to himself

1090
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:58,918
is eat his own gun.

1091
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:02,355
Lou Girard
always called at night.

1092
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:05,985
Tonight someone else
had to make the call for him.

1093
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,505
There's a half empty bottle
of Bourbon here on the dresser,

1094
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:25,138
spilled bottle of Diazepam
here on the coffee table.

1095
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:30,508
Y'all writing that off
as a suicide?

1096
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:33,020
Well, that's the way
it looks to me.

1097
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:35,181
He was in bad shape.

1098
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,987
Mattress is covered
in piss stains.

1099
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,891
The sink is full
of raw garbage.

1100
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,396
Where's the gun at?

1101
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,863
By the bedside.

1102
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,331
If Lou Girard wanted
to kill his self,

1103
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:48,632
how come he didn't use
that.357?

1104
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,171
'Cause he was drunk
on his ass.

1105
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,208
Not an unusual condition
for him.

1106
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:56,403
He was helping me
on a case, Doobie.

1107
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,638
And?

1108
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:58,941
Maybe he found out something

1109
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,572
somebody did not
want him to know.

1110
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:06,721
He was trembling,
eating pills every morning,

1111
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:09,451
in front of everybody.

1112
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,823
There's no big mystery
to what happened here tonight.

1113
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,556
He was a good cop.

1114
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,929
He was a sorry-ass drunk.

1115
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,564
Now, if you want to look
at anything else, hurry up.

1116
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,902
I'm going
to seal the place.

1117
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:28,067
I appreciate you waiting outside
just for a moment.

1118
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,407
Matter of fact, I appreciate you
staying as far away from me

1119
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,071
as you can possibly get.

1120
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,332
What had Lou found out
that had cost him his life?

1121
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:37,072
Hogman Patin knew a lot
and seldom said anything.

1122
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,614
Now I got word
he wanted to talk to me.

1123
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,850
I started to think about
when I was in the pen.

1124
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,584
And your daddy,
he brought my mother food

1125
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,250
and paid for her medicine
up at the store

1126
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:54,352
when she was sick.

1127
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,261
You got something
to say to me, Sam?

1128
01:13:56,331 --> 01:14:00,028
What was the name of that nigger
you dug up out the sandbar?

1129
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,865
DeWitt Prejean.

1130
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,774
He was fucking
a white man's wife.

1131
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,365
Start asking what
he's doing for a living,

1132
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:11,402
and you'll find the people been
causing you all this grief.

1133
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,141
Who's the man
I'm looking for?

1134
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:18,079
I said
all I can say.

1135
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,417
This still
the state of Louisiana.

1136
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:39,096
Why you keep
bothering me?

1137
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,507
I need to know what kind of work
DeWitt Prejean did.

1138
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:43,806
Done nigger work.

1139
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,541
You know, he cut lawns,
cleaned out grease traps,

1140
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,845
got the dead rats out
from under people's houses.

1141
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,748
What the fuck
you think he did?

1142
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,151
Don't sound right to me.

1143
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:56,714
I think he did
some other kind of work too.

1144
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,453
You leave me alone.

1145
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,791
You're a pretty good
judge of character, Mr. Hebert.

1146
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,888
Do I look like somebody
that's going to go away?

1147
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,425
Hm?

1148
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,165
It was better
back then.

1149
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,331
You know it was.

1150
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,340
What kind of work he do,
Ben?

1151
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,138
Drove a truck.

1152
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:18,702
Who for?

1153
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,908
It was over
in Jeanerette.

1154
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,422
I brung her out here
'cause she works for me,

1155
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,652
'cause I can't get in and out
of the car good by myself.

1156
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,358
He worked seasonal
for a white man,

1157
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:39,923
owned some big sugar mill.

1158
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,833
I don't know
nothing about him

1159
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:45,431
except he was a brother
of that crippled fellow.

1160
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:48,032
That's all I know
and nothing more.

1161
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:52,706
You saying I do,
then you're a Goddamn liar.

1162
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,578
Something else
you want to say?

1163
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,916
You got a fish
on your line.

1164
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,288
Batist.

1165
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,834
How many sugar mills they got
over there in Jeanerette?

1166
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:14,926
Just one.

1167
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:24,901
Hey.

1168
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,880
Come on in.

1169
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,383
Stopped by
to say good-bye,

1170
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:32,420
give you
a going-away present.

1171
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:34,921
Where you headed,
Cholo?

1172
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,150
Thought I might
go to Florida,

1173
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:39,489
maybe open a business
like you got here.

1174
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,188
What you doing with
all that lawn furniture

1175
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,629
in the back end
of your pickup?

1176
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:49,329
Guy at the Holiday Inn wanted me
to take it when I checked out.

1177
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:53,534
Said I'd kind of be doing
him a favor, you know?

1178
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,576
Giving him a write-off.

1179
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,974
You had some trouble
with Baby Feet.

1180
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,084
Yeah.

1181
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,556
I told him he was a douche bag

1182
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,218
and I wouldn't work for him again
even if he begged me.

1183
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,658
That Cherry LeBlanc girl
was right

1184
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,195
when she
called him a needle-dick.

1185
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,093
That's when the son of a bitch
comes across my mouth

1186
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:17,131
with this big...

1187
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,531
Now, wait, wait, wait.

1188
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:21,125
What's this
about Cherry LeBlanc?

1189
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:28,608
If he tells you
he never knew her,

1190
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,440
ask him about this.

1191
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,176
Julie forgot he told me
to take some souvenir pictures

1192
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:40,221
when we drove over
to Biloxi last year.

1193
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:41,255
Is that her or not?

1194
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,123
Did Baby Feets
kill this girl?

1195
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,858
Come on, Lieutenant.

1196
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:54,902
You know how it works.

1197
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:57,336
A guy like Julie
don't do hits.

1198
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:58,566
He says something
to somebody,

1199
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,403
then he forgets it.

1200
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,603
If it's a speclal kind of job,
maybe somebody calls up a geek.

1201
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,112
Did Baby Feets
make that call?

1202
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:09,212
Start a photo album,
Lieutenant.

1203
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:12,617
Make up
your own mind.

1204
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,993
What's Murphy Doucet
doing in this picture?

1205
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,974
What's wrong, Dave?

1206
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,373
Got a loose ignition wire.

1207
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,071
You got a knife
I could use?

1208
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:38,737
Yeah, I ought
to have something.

1209
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,621
This should do.

1210
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,817
Some Mexican pulled this on me
in Lake Charles.

1211
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,254
I didn't know
you were a cop in Lake Charles.

1212
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:55,455
I wasn't.

1213
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:57,259
I was working highway
for the state police.

1214
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:58,822
That's where
I retlred from last year.

1215
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,959
Is that when you got into
business with Twinky LeMoyne?

1216
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,004
No, we go back
a ways further.

1217
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,143
Thanks for the knife.

1218
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:16,943
What's the deal?

1219
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,986
Lou Girard was
looking at her file last week.

1220
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:21,022
Lou arrested her
on a prostitution charge.

1221
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,488
It wouldn't be
one officer.

1222
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:24,320
It was a state police raid
on a bar...

1223
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:26,019
State police?
Who sent that arrest report?

1224
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,652
Oh, Sgt. Murphy Doucet.

1225
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:29,754
Murphy Doucet.

1226
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,205
I'd missed it.

1227
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,978
Lou Girard had dug up
Cherry LeBlanc's arrest record,

1228
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,639
and it had
cost him his life.

1229
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:53,317
But this was going to be the end
of the line for Murphy Doucet.

1230
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,968
I wasn't planting evidence,
I kept telling myself.

1231
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,013
I was just removing it

1232
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,241
before a guilty man
could destroy it.

1233
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,312
Why the hell
are y'all here?

1234
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:02,879
We're here because of you,
Mr. Doucet.

1235
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,051
We've been checking
all the unsolved murders

1236
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:07,253
of females in areas
surrounding highways

1237
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,456
during the time you were working
for the state police.

1238
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,260
Rosie, I think
we just found the knife

1239
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,891
that he used
on Cherry LeBlanc.

1240
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:15,300
That knife
wasn't there.

1241
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:16,428
I say it was,

1242
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:19,029
and I say your fingerprints
are all over it.

1243
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:20,267
I see.

1244
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:24,403
You and this Mexican bitch
are in on it together, huh?

1245
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,504
No, Murphy.

1246
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:29,379
I'm fucking you
all by myself.

1247
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,782
Get your hands up now.

1248
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,285
Get your hands up,
up against that...

1249
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:33,912
up against that wall.

1250
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,916
Y'all are setting me up,
and I don't even know why.

1251
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,621
Think about it.

1252
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:41,662
Think hard.

1253
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,528
Think all the way back
to 1965,

1254
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:46,260
just before
that hurricane hlt.

1255
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,064
Y'all made DeWitt Prejean
run with that chain

1256
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:50,627
locked around his chest,

1257
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:52,468
shot his leg out
from underneath him.

1258
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:56,706
You didn't notice the boy
that was watching you

1259
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:58,302
from across the swamp,
though, did you?

1260
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,530
I don't know how you did it,
but you planted that knife.

1261
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,007
Time is always on
the bad guy's side, Rosie.

1262
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:31,068
We wait for warrants while
they deep-six the evidence.

1263
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,642
I didn't hear
what you said.

1264
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:48,553
Jesus wienie, Dave.

1265
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,154
Y'all done
tore this place to pieces.

1266
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:52,222
You want to stay behind
and clean it up?

1267
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,665
I don't want to be
nowhere around here

1268
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:54,702
when that guy
gets home.

1269
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:55,997
You heard he's out on bond?

1270
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,038
Screw that.

1271
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:58,970
He'll be here
any minute.

1272
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:07,605
We got nothing.

1273
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,654
Alfie.

1274
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:18,591
You know where
your little girl's at?

1275
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,491
She's right here
on my knee.

1276
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,457
You sound speechless.

1277
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:28,502
Turn her loose,
Doucet.

1278
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,730
You don't want
to do this.

1279
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:32,034
I'll make it simple
for both of us.

1280
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,132
You take that knlfe
out of the evldence locker,

1281
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,143
you put it in a Ziploc bag.

1282
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,610
At 8:00 tomorrow morning,

1283
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,271
you leave the bag
In a trash can

1284
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:42,908
on the corner of Royal
and St. Anne in New Orleans.

1285
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:44,246
You listen to me,
Doucet.

1286
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:45,286
Think about this.

1287
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:46,320
You're a cop.

1288
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:47,548
You can skate on this.

1289
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,317
We've been jacking you around
the whole time.

1290
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,416
You lying
son of a bitch.

1291
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:54,826
You won't rest till you
fuck me up every way you can.

1292
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,160
You said
only one thing right today:

1293
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:58,665
I'm going to skate.

1294
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:01,293
And you're
going to help me.

1295
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,039
Finally
lost your mind, Dave?

1296
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,874
Young lady, you need
to stay away from this man.

1297
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:46,140
Okay, let's go.

1298
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:47,738
Get out of here.
Come on, let's go.

1299
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:49,977
Nothing good
on TV tonight, Dave?

1300
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,985
Murphy Doucet
has my daughter.

1301
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,516
Did you hear
what I said?

1302
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:57,558
That's too bad.

1303
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:58,990
I don't like
to hear stuff like that.

1304
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,028
It upsets me.

1305
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:06,464
Hey, maybe you can get her face
on one of them milk cartons.

1306
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:18,870
Where's my daughter, Julie?

1307
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,563
Where's Alafair at?

1308
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:41,124
I cut Doucet loose.

1309
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:44,171
I got nothing to do
with what he does.

1310
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,263
You get off
my fucking back

1311
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,002
or I swear to God,
I'll square this.

1312
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:51,273
Cop or not,
I'll put out on open contract.

1313
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:52,813
I'll cowboy
your whole fucking family.

1314
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:58,677
Your window of opportunity's
closing down.

1315
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:00,186
Where's my baby girl?

1316
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:01,984
I'm telling you
the truth.

1317
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:03,387
I got nothing to do
with what he does.

1318
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:04,425
He's a geek.

1319
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:06,858
I don't hire geeks.
I run them off.

1320
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,532
Last by God chance.

1321
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,495
He's got a camp
out by Bayou Vista,

1322
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:22,566
almost at Atchafalaya Basin.

1323
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:23,872
The deed's
not in his name.

1324
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:25,071
Nobody knows about it.

1325
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:28,775
It's at the end
of the dirt road,

1326
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,839
by the salt marsh.

1327
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,446
Alafair there?

1328
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,658
I hope to God
she's not.

1329
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,091
Alfie!

1330
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:18,642
Come here.

1331
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:19,975
Did he hurt you, baby?

1332
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:21,207
I told him
he better not.

1333
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:24,615
I told him
what you do.

1334
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,813
I just shot a man
armed with a rolled-up magazine.

1335
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:29,151
No, no.

1336
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,191
He had a gun on him.

1337
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,022
You just don't
remember it yet.

1338
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:37,294
You okay?

1339
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:23,543
Should I call my lawyer?

1340
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:26,341
Mr. LeMoyne,

1341
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:30,316
I saw you
and Murphy Doucet

1342
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:34,411
kill DeWitt Prejean
out on the Atchafalaya.

1343
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:37,786
I watched it
from across the swamp.

1344
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:41,756
Your crippled brother
couldn't kill DeWitt,

1345
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,228
so you did it for him.

1346
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:48,699
Am I under arrest?

1347
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,169
I think Murphy Doucet's
been blackmailing you with it

1348
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:54,675
all these years.

1349
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:57,734
A lot of bad things happened
back in that era

1350
01:31:57,812 --> 01:31:58,836
between the races.

1351
01:31:58,913 --> 01:32:01,575
But we're not
the same people

1352
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:03,617
we were then,
are we?

1353
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:05,276
I think we are.

1354
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:11,422
You seem unable
to let the past rest.

1355
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,289
It's been my experience

1356
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:16,262
that you let go of the past
by addressing it.

1357
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,395
Please, leave.

1358
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:21,332
It won't make
any difference if I leave.

1359
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:23,529
You're going to drag this one
around with you all day long

1360
01:32:23,604 --> 01:32:27,597
every day,
like a log chain,

1361
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:29,108
for the rest of your life.

1362
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,912
Have you no mercy, sir?

1363
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:38,076
No, sir.

1364
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,347
No, sir, I don't.

1365
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:04,774
Julie Balboni
finally went down,

1366
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:06,813
but in a way
nobody expected,

1367
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,372
in a beef
with the IRS.

1368
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:12,078
They shipped Baby Feet
up to a maximum security unit

1369
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:14,519
at Leavenworth, Kansas,

1370
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:15,886
a place that,
in wintertime,

1371
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:17,322
makes you believe

1372
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:20,849
that sub-zero winds blow from
four directions simultaneously.

1373
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:28,800
Elrod Sykes
never took another drink.

1374
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:30,564
He brought Alafair to the set

1375
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:32,902
and gave her a little part
in the movie.

1376
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:34,999
Months later,
when the picture was finished,

1377
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:36,338
he called us from California

1378
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:39,243
to say that Alafair
had been his salvation.

1379
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:49,882
I thought in the morning mists
that curled around the bayou

1380
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:53,017
I might again see
General John Bell Hood,

1381
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:54,925
just a glimpse,
perhaps,

1382
01:33:54,996 --> 01:33:57,021
a doff of his hat,

1383
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:59,566
the kindness
of his smile,

1384
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,295
the beleaguered affection

1385
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:03,929
that always seemed
to linger in his face.

1386
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,541
Then as the days passed

1387
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:12,738
and I began to let go of all the
violent events of that summer,

1388
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:16,681
I came to accept that the
General, as Bootsie had said,

1389
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:19,447
was only a figment
of my imagination,

1390
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,216
there to remind me
out of the distant past

1391
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:25,725
that the contest
is never quite over,

1392
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:28,557
the field never quite ours.

1393
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:23,275
Dave?
