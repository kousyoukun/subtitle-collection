2
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,781
我的名字叫Dave Robicheaux
My name's Dave Robicheaux.

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,823
我是个酒鬼
I'm an alcoholic.

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,654
有时，我受到酒精的诱惑
Sometimes I'm tempted to have a drink.

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,222
但我不能这样做
But I never do.

6
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,576
我希望这个可怜的女孩死以后
I hope this poor girl was dead

7
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,246
他才开始像这样切开她
before he started carving on her like that.

8
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,518
Dave，这个女孩没有这么好运气
This poor girl didn't have
a whole lot of good luck, Dave.

9
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,304
在古代
In the ancient world,

10
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,502
人们把沉重的石头，垒在他们死后的坟墓上
people placed heavy stones on the graves of their dead

11
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:01,343
这样他们的灵魂就不会迷路，受到生活的折磨
so their souls would not wander
and afflict the living.

12
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,279
我总觉得这是原始人
I always thought this was simply the practice

13
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,978
单纯的迷信行为
of superstitious and primitive people.

14
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,078
但是，我学会了关于死亡
But I was about to learn that the dead

15
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,918
死亡带着稠密和发光的迷雾
can hover on the edge of our vision

16
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,391
环绕在我的眼前
with the density and luminosity of mist.

17
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,554
他们要求合理的安息于地下
And their claim on the earth can be as legitimate

18
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,758
向我们自己一样顽强的
and tenacious as our own.

19
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,034
我能看一下你的驾驶执照吗？
Could I see your driver's license, please?

20
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,332
我的什么？
My what?

21
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,565
驾驶执照
Driver's license.

22
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,767
请从你的钱包里把它取出来，拿给我
Please take it out your billfold,hand it to me.

23
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,469
哦，好吧，行
Oh, yeah, sure.

24
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,739
Well...

25
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,246
我刚才不太小心
I was a little careless back there.

26
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,372
对此我很抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

27
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,609
你是Elrod T,sykes?
You're Elrod T. Sykes?

28
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,116
是的，长官，我正是
Yes, sir,that's who I am.

29
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,915
下车，Sykes先生
Step out the car,Mr. Sykes.

30
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,922
好吧，长官，你什么意思，长官
Yes, sir.Anything you say, sir.

31
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,929
Sykes先生，我想你喝酒了
Mr. Sykes,I think you've been drinking,

32
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,487
而且还在你的车里吸食大麻
and I know you've been smoking
marijuana in your automobile.

33
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,090
我相信你的女朋友在吃螳螂
I believe your lady friend there
just ate the roach.

34
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,567
哦，好吧，那现在情况不太妙是吗？
Ooh, well, that wouldn't be good now, would it?

35
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,003
你现在因饮酒驾车被捕了，先生
You're under arrest for driving while intoxicated, Mr. es.

36
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,404
我会带你到离开这条街，到市立监狱
I'll take you just down the street here to the city jail.

37
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,670
我会派一部车，把送Drummond小姐回去
I'll send a car, take Ms.Drummond wherever she's staying.

38
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,870
但是你的红色小跑车
But your little red sports car

39
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,378
会被拖到拘留所
is going to be towed to the pound.

40
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,413
是个坏消息
This is bad news.

41
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,812
这不在我的议程里
This is not on my agenda,

42
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,247
因为我们刚开始一部新电影
'cause we're just starting a movie.

43
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,682
我一直喜欢你的所以电影
I've always enjoyed all your films.

44
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,878
Drummond小姐也是
Ms. Drummond's too.

45
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,682
请把你的车钥匙拔下来
Take your car keys out the ignition please.

46
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,724
El,干点什么
El, do something.

47
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,530
我觉得真是糟透了
I feel real bad about this.

48
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,964
能让他给母亲反酒后驾驶活动
Can he make a contribution

49
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,197
进行捐款，或其他类似的事吗？
to Mothers Against Drunk Driving or something like that?

50
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,363
就像你个你的崇拜者，Drummond小姐
As an admirer of your work,Ms. Drummond,

51
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,203
我提醒你，别再提捐款的事
I recommend you don't make any more mentions of contributions.

52
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,641
我劝你原地不动
I recommend you stay put.

53
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,906
你就独自在这儿，几分钟后带你回家
Deputy will be along here in a few minutes to take you home.

54
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,914
Allons.

55
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,185
在我的车上，你不会晕车吧？
You're not going to get sick in my truck, are you?

56
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,227
不，
No, I'm just fine.

57
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,854
我知道那儿有一具死尸
I know where there's a dead body.

58
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,255
什么？
What?

59
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,225
看上去像一大堆软骨和骨头
Looks like a big pile of gristle and bone.

60
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,734
这是那儿？
Where was this?

61
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,668
走出他妈的Atchafalaya沼泽
Way the hell out in Atchafalaya swamp.

62
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:16,903
我们必须找出靠近印第安人保留地的一个地方
We had to pick up a scene near the old Indian reservation.

63
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:17,943
我过去撒尿
I went to take a leak.

64
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,308
我看见他陷在一个沙州里面
I saw it sticking out of a sandbar.

65
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,911
回车上去
Get back in the truck.

66
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,282
这个沼泽里都是老印第安人的尸体
That swamp full of old Indian bones.

67
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,654
但是
Yeah, but...

68
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,124
对不起，我不记得你的名字了
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

69
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,717
Dave Robicheaux.

70
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,490
Robicheaux先生

71
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,497
当我找到那个印第安人
now, if that was an Indian I found,

72
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,793
我真是奇怪为什么
I was wondering what he was doing

73
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,097
他被链子绑住
with a chain wrapped around him.

74
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,740
再说一遍
Say that again.

75
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,174
一条生了锈的大铁链
It's a rusted chain with links

76
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,575
好像他的拳头
as big as my fist

77
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:56,137
交叉在他的胸口
crisscrossed around his rib cage.

78
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,883
你还能再找的那个沙洲吗？
Can you find that sandbar again?

79
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,295
是的，长官，我相信我能行
Yes, sir,I believe I could.

80
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,266
我会给你一个改过自新的机会
I'm going to make a confession to you,

81
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,461
Sykes先生.

82
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,164
看见那些是很痛苦的事
DWIs are a pain in the butt.

83
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,762
要是我放你回家，你告诉你
If I take you home, can I have your word

84
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,967
明天早上9点到我办公室来
you'll be in my office,9:00 in the morning?

85
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,033
镇定点？
And sober?

86
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,080
9点钟过去，当然
9:00, you got it.Absolutely.

87
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:32,174
哦，我真的感谢你
Hey, I really appreciate this.

88
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,232
Elrod Sykes和Kelly Drummond?

89
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,270
我也要去
I want to go to the set.

90
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,304
Sykes是个醉鬼
Sykes is a drunk.

91
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,338
他很棒
He's huge!

92
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,203
他的脑袋在黑暗里发光
His head glows in the dark.

93
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,333
也许我们能得到一个他的海报亲笔签名
Maybe we could get an autographed movie poster.

94
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,037
没门
No way!

95
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,443
不是为你，是狂风慈善基金
Not for you,for the hurricane relief fund.

96
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,481
好的，太棒了
Okay, cool.

97
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,515
求你了
Please?

98
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,550
别闹了
Will you hush?

99
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,084
我带着她
I'll take her

100
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,642
照顾她
and look out for her,

101
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,051
要是你没意见
if that's all right with you.

102
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,589
也许我们还能得到Kelly Drummond的签名
Maybe we could get Kelly Drummond to sign one too,

103
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,147
为某人的房顶
pay for somebody's roof.

104
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,523
求你了
Please?

105
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,276
还在那边
It's over yonder.

106
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,249
等一下 ，Sykes先生
Hold on there,Mr. Sykes.

107
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,979
最好用点这些东西
Best put some of this on.

108
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,248
我们曾经在带来很多装备到这里
We used to have a lot of bats down here,

109
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,790
蚊子还是咬所有人
but the mosquitoes ate 'em all.

110
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,758
这家伙从好莱坞过来可是走了很长的路
That boy's a long way from his Hollywood poontang,

111
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:21,793
是吗
ain't he?

112
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,123
这傻瓜说的是帮你
This jackass is objectifying you,

113
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,493
Sykes先生，因为他有点暴露狂
Mr. Sykes, because he's had very little exposure

114
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,532
在外边的环境下
to the outside world.

115
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,759
别让他烦你
Don't let it bother you.

116
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,239
也许65年伊丽莎白飓风吹过这里，也许把他埋了
Hurricane Betsy blowing through here in '65 probably buried him

117
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,507
卡特李娜飓风又把他挖出来
and Katrina unearthed him.

118
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,809
为什么是65年？
Why '65?

119
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:47,546
飓风从古至今一直在这个国家横行霸道
Hurricanes tear up this part of the country all the time.

120
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,780
看见这些筋骨了吗？
See that left shin bone?

121
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,084
剩下一半了
Clipped in half.

122
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,387
在那儿，当他像跑时，他们射了他
That's where they shot him when he tried to run away.

123
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,290
你是个心理学家，或者在这里胡说？
You a psychlc or some bullshlt like that?

124
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,386
不，我在一英里见过这场景
No, I saw it happen about a mile from here.

125
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,090
你是那是些白人吗？
Are you saying that some whlte people

126
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,598
这周围人们用私刑吗？
lynched somebody around here?

127
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,260
我们回去后，你必须去和你们上级谈谈
When we get back, you're going to have to talk to your sheriff,

128
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,099
让这个验尸官现在离开这里  
get the coroner out here now.

129
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,662
我不懂为啥你们都在Iberia教区
I don't know about y'all over in Iberia Parish,

130
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,504
但是这周围，在之前的40年来
but around here,ain't nobody going to be

131
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,101
没有人真正的去关心黑鬼们的苦难
real interested in nigger trouble that's 40 years old.

132
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,771
Robicheaux先生，你在找什么？
What are you looking for,Mr. Robicheaux?

133
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,543
我没看到在他裤子上那些剩余的带子
I don't see any remnants of a belt on his trousers...

134
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,918
或者靴子上的绳子
or any laces in his boots.

135
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,047
这家伙购物的时候是大概很善意的
That boy probably did his shopping at the Goodwill.

136
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,123
他们从未找到他，甚至没去找过
They never found him,didn't even look for him.

137
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,657
回来后，没有尸体，没有失踪人口报告
Back then, with no body,no missing persons report,

138
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,795
局长没有任何理由去相信我
that sheriff didn't have any reason to believe me,

139
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,807
起码有一小块屁股，去证明
must less get off his ass and go to work.

140
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,367
你不再是十七岁了
You're not 17 years old anymore.

141
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,675
这个麻烦已经影响到了你的工作之外的生活
The trouble I have with you is getting you away from work.

142
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,080
你做了你能做得一切
You've done everything that you can.

143
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,209
没有任何理由再去自责
You have no good reason to beat yourself up.

144
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,015
快喝了你的牛奶，上床睡觉吧
Now drink your milk and come to bed.

145
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,680
我陪你去
I'm horny.

146
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,656
Bootsie是对的
Bootsie was right.

147
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:06,061
在过去的岁月，什么才是影响的重点呢？
What was the point of reaching into the distant past?

148
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,761
就在昨天，一个年轻女孩被分尸
Just yesterday, a young girl had been eviscerated.

149
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,931
我们查到她的名字叫Cherry LeBlanc
We had her name now,Cherry LeBlanc.

150
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,536
Trajan先生在吗？
Mr. Trajan around?

151
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,344
他在那边，Chere
He's over there, chere.

152
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,386
我们已经被查了三次了
We've been over this already three times now.

153
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,887
Cherry几星期之前就不在这里干了
Cherry's been working here off and on for the past few weeks.

154
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,254
她表现出来很听Hogman Pitan的话
She's going to show up anyway to listen to Hogman Pitan.

155
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,758
这个女孩为Hagman做的一件事
The girl had a real thing for Hogman.

156
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,920
大概是一点，她把她的钱包放在酒吧
Some time around 1:00,she put her purse behind the bar

157
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,623
说她向到外面去散散步
and says she's going to go outside for a walk.

158
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,893
你知道她因为卖淫被逮捕了吗？
You know she'd been arrested for prostitution?

159
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,160
我不知道那件事
I didn't know that.

160
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,327
好吧
All right.

161
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,802
好的
Okay.

162
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,099
你雇用了她，因为你认为
You hired her 'cause you thought

163
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,141
她是个LSU 好学生
she was an honor student at LSU.

164
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,642
我并没有留意，你告诉我的这事，侦探先生
I can't say I care for the way you're talking to me, Detective.

165
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,908
要是我发现你隐瞒了什么
If I found out you've been holding back information on me,

166
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,610
Trajan先生，我下次会带上搜查令来，Trajan先生
Mr. Trajan, I'ma come back here with a warrant, Mr. Trajan,

167
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,152
逮捕你
for your arrest.

168
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,599
你知道Cherry LeBlanc
Did you know Cherry LeBlanc,

169
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,770
白人小妞，大概十九岁
little white girl,about 19 years old?

170
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,815
她在这里工作？
She work here,ain't she?

171
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,873
你知道他有个男友，叫Tante的吗？
Do you know if she had a boyfriend, tante?

172
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,646
要是你想打听什么
If that's what you want to call it.

173
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,981
她在卖淫
She in the business.

174
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,351
Trajan先生有关系吗？
Was Mr. Trajan involved?

175
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,014
去问他吧
Ask him.

176
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,285
我觉得他没干
I don't think he was.

177
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,920
除此之外，你还有东西告诉我
Otherwise you wouldn't be　telling me all these things.

178
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,088
她是个可怜的女孩
She a sad girl.

179
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,725
我告诉她，“像你这样漂亮的白人女孩
I told her,"A pretty white girl like you

180
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,393
能做你想做的任何事”
could have anything you want."

181
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,338
这个姑娘打扮起来，就像个电影明星
When that girl dress up,she look just like a movie star.

182
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,204
谁给她拉皮条？
Who was her pimp?

183
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,177
我不再知道其他的事了，我
I don't know nothing else, me.

184
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,879
她被一些有钱的白人
She wasn't about to give the name

185
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,611
和一个黑人老妇叫去
of some rich white man to an old black woman.

186
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,245
什么有钱的白人？
What rich white man?

187
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,888
一些有钱的白人也许 。。
Some rich white man maybe...

188
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,487
让她别再卖淫，去卖果冻
get her out of the business
of selling jelly roll.

189
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,566
她说不久前有人打了他们
She say that just before somebody done them

190
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,433
给这个年轻姑娘带来可怕的事
awful things to that young girl.

191
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,984
局长也在ST,Clair教区
The sheriff over in St. Clair Parish

192
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,318
说“很感谢”“感谢这些警察昨天在Atchafalaya 
said, "Thanks a lot,"for that pile of bones you found

193
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,620
找到这些骸骨
out in the Atchafalaya yesterday.

194
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,319
他们真的赏识这些额外的工作
They really appreciate the extra work.

195
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,622
他需要去找到一条新的工作线索
He need to find a new line of work,

196
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,458
他不喜欢他们那些骨头
he don't like them bones.

197
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,760
现在，他会说，欢迎你取消你的日常工作
Now, he said you're welcome to come over on your days off

198
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,960
全力进行调查
and run an investigation.

199
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,199
那些验尸官拿走了骨头，现在正等你呢
Their coroner's got them bones now waiting on you.

200
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,570
解剖的结果证明是LeBlanc女孩
Autopsy report came in on that LeBlanc girl.

201
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,181
看上去我们在谈论一个神经病患者
Looks like we're talking about a psychopath,

202
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,912
有人用金属丝连上了眼睛，还弄破了
somebody wired to the eyes on crack or meth.

203
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,578
也许
Maybe.

204
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,621
我想她认识凶手
I think she knew him.

205
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,520
但你别以为“那是John(俚语不懂)”？
So you don't think it was a John?

206
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,185
不，她把钱包留在了吧台
No, she left her purse behind the bar

207
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,058
她所有的避孕套都在里面
with all her condoms in it.

208
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,530
Cherry LeBlanc是一个有野心的职业女性(讽刺)
Cherry LeBlanc was a working girl with ambition.

209
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,364
也许他在那儿丢了一个商业机会（讽刺）
Maybe she misjudged a business opportunity here.

210
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,371
那些女孩会去干卖淫的勾当呢？
Who's a girl like that going to be in business with?

211
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,875
Um... Baby Feet?

212
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,943
也许是Baby Feet
Maybe Baby Feet.

213
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,660
发生了什么,Cholo?
What's happening, Cholo?

214
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,752
我以为你在写作呢
I thought you was in the pen.

215
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,921
不，伙计
No, man.

216
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,362
Katrina,她把我的手洗干净
Katrina,she rinsed my hands clean.

217
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,922
所有的他妈的晦气的东西
The whole damn crlme lab

218
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,127
都洗到河里去了
washed off down the river.

219
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,329
我在新奥尔良可没犯什么事
Ain't got nothing on me in New Orleans.

220
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,598
干得好，兄弟
Doing fine, bro.

221
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,435
除了这个，他们没有支付足够的钱
Besides that, they ain't even got enough money

222
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,838
给手下的兄弟，至少想我
to lobotomize guys like me no more.

223
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,104
有何贵干，Dave?
What's going on, Dave?

224
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,510
我正在调查一件谋杀案，Julie
I'm investigating a murder,Julie.

225
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,548
真是不幸
No kldding.

226
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,407
你们都担心我，Dave?
Y'all worried about me,Dave?

227
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,747
哦，是的
Hell yes.

228
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,286
哪有人会承认是他们自己
How many guys would burn down their own

229
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,380
老爸夜总会和它的老爸一直都在这里
father's nightclub with their own father still in it?

230
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,162
要是我搞点小坏事，看在我态度好的情况下
You got to forgive me if I get a little upset

231
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,098
你该原谅我，Dave
by these kinds of attitudes, Dave.

232
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,498
我回家里拉屎
I come home to this shithole.

233
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,129
我保证我们都是正规的娱乐生意
I'm a prominent man in the entertainment business.

234
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,971
我每天都在打电话，你能在加利福尼亚的
I talk on the phone every day to people in California

235
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,568
每周娱乐杂志上读到这些
you read about in Entertainment Weekly.

236
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,909
他们也许会说“欢迎回到Balboni日”
They ought to have "Welcome Back Balboni Day."

237
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,039
相反
Instead,

238
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,447
我却被你像管道煤气一样对待（说他危险）
I get treated like sewer gas by you.

239
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,078
你明白我说的意思吗，Dave
You understand what I'm saying, Dave.

240
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,781
伤了我的心
It hurts me.

241
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,119
坐下摆摆龙门阵
Sit down while I take a whiz.

242
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,250
Cholo.你的好客精神哪去了？
Cholo,where's your hospitality?

243
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,352
给这哥们一杯软饮料
Get the man a soft drink.

244
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,172
这儿，陆军中尉
Here, Lieutenant.

245
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,604
Julie告诉我，那时候
Julie was telling me about that time

246
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,301
法兰西38区几乎四分之一的黑鬼
that nigger almost popped you with a .38

247
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,003
都被你抓了
in the French Quarter.

248
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,012
说他救你的命
Said he saved your life.

249
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,042
你和Julie是高中棒球队的成员吗？
Weren't you and Julie baseball buddies in high school?

250
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,517
我发现，Cholo
Take the hint,Cholo.

251
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,748
这家伙不善言谈
This guy's not a conversationalist.

252
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,262
你调查过Cherry的LeBlanc交易吗？
You working on that Cherry LeBlanc deal?

253
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,126
你还知道些什么？
What you know about that?

254
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,758
今天全打开了，伙计们
All over today's paper, man.

255
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,200
Julie和我刚好谈到这些
Julie and me were just talking about it.

256
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,238
好像你在让一个呕吐的病人放松
Sounds like you got one sick fuck on the loose.

257
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,405
我很忙，Julie
My meter's running,Julie.

258
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,540
我想谈谈，我们在南面
I want to talk about

259
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,140
发现了那个被害的女孩
that murdered girl we found south of town.

260
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,378
哪个女孩？
Which girl is that?

261
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,352
Cherry LeBlanc.

262
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,946
我猜想我没听过这个名字
I guess I ain't heard about it.

263
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,150
你不看报纸吗？
You don't read the newspaper?

264
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,214
我很忙
I've been busy.

265
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,523
我能看见
I can see that.

266
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,359
我们以前是朋友，Dave
We used to be friends,Dave.

267
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,194
我甚至可能给过你很多支持
I even maybe did you a favor once.

268
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,496
所以我要同你和你的管片保持联络
So I'm going to line it out for you and any locals

269
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,399
想变成你们的眼线
that want to get the wax out their ears.

270
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,404
路易斯安那屁股被打了
Louisiana's flat-ass broke.

271
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,167
新奥尔良是个停尸房
New Orleans is a mortuary.

272
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,868
从厕所的下面到
And the bottom of a toilet's got more appeal

273
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,773
河口的屁眼里面
than this shithole in the bayou.

274
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,072
所以事实上，他们最好醒目点
So they better wake up to the fact

275
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,239
我投下了超不多400万美金
that we are dropping close to $40 million

276
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,508
在Iberia教区
in Iberia Parish.

277
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,606
他们不喜欢想像
They don't like the name

278
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,207
Balboni这样的名字在这儿？
Balboni around here?

279
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,616
我就把整个他妈的电影业
We'll move the whole fucking movie

280
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,153
搬到密西西比去
over to Mississippi.

281
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,621
看看那些熊屁股的
See how that floats with those coon-ass jack-offs

282
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,679
商会会怎么样
on the Chamber of Commerce.

283
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,385
你现在有电影生意？
You're in the movie business now?

284
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,556
是的，我拍摄Whlte Doves和Michael Goldman
Yeah, I'm producing Whlte Doves with Michael Goldman.

285
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,099
你怎么会想知道这事？
What you think about that?

286
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,964
我想大家都希望你成功，Julie
I'm sure everybody wishes you success, Julie.

287
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,731
我下一部是关于棒球的电影
I'ma do a baseball movie next.

288
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,295
你想在里面演一个角色吗？
You want a part in it?

289
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,019
你能走了
You can go on in.

290
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,858
还记得我吗，Dave?
You remember me, Dave?

291
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,691
是Doucet
It's Doucet, isn't it?

292
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,427
是的，长官，Murphy Doucet
Yes, sir,Murphy Doucet.

293
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,366
你记性真好
You got a good memory.

294
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,427
我在Jefferson教区的治安部门
I was with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Department

295
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,904
那时你还在NOPD
when you were with NOPD.

296
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,497
我猜你现在电影公司
I guess you're in the movie business now,

297
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,042
没和其他人在一起
along with everybody else.

298
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,806
是的，我在安全服务部门兼职
Yeah, I own half of a security service now,

299
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,848
我还在干货车驾驶员
and I'm still with the Teamsters out of Lafayette.

300
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,577
我在这儿是身兼两职
So I'm kind of doing double duty here.

301
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,845
遇到什么麻烦了吗？
Is there some kind of trouble?

302
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,581
我在哪儿能找到Goldman先生？
Where can I find Mr. Goldman?

303
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,623
他们正好在这片树林的另一边
Right on the other side of them trees.

304
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,919
我来告诉他，你来了
I'll let him know you're coming.

305
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,960
好的，我要找到他
It's all right.I'll find him.

306
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,360
我们把士兵分成两队，列队通过那儿？
We had two divisions of soldiers march through that?

307
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,162
看上去我们要求袭击面包房
Looks like we're shooting a bread commercial.

308
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,897
在哪儿布置大炮，美国玩具R?
Where'd we get this cannon,Toys "R" Us?

309
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,633
是的，我需要平民站在那边
All right, I'm going to need floaters in there,

310
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,141
一个脸朝下，两个肚子上
one face down,two belly-up.

311
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,267
用点肥油
Use some of the fat extras.

312
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,005
让他们看上去浮肿
They'll look bloated.

313
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,046
我的死亡之屋？
My dead horse?

314
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,080
不
No.

315
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,673
不在来电表里？太恐怖了
Not on the call sheet?Terrific.

316
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,342
我们需要一些鲜血，鲜血近投地上
We need some blood,blood-soaked ground,

317
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,942
剧本上是这样写的吗
if that's what it says in the script.

318
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,180
这不是每夜新闻
This is not the nightly news.

319
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,223
他们永远渲染血腥
They never show the blood.

320
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,258
这是一个寓言
This is an allegory.

321
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,418
我们不能射下Vicksbury
We're not shooting the fall of Vicksburg.

322
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,359
这是 Baghdad 2007
This is Baghdad 2007.

323
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,090
复制到这些
Copy that.

324
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,066
要是人们不能联络到这些，操他们
If people don't connect the dots, fuck 'em.

325
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,398
有个Robicheaux侦探在这儿要见你，先生
There's a Detective Robicheaux here to see you, sir.

326
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,735
因为你调查一庄罪案
So you're investigating a crime.

327
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,671
看看这周围都是罪犯？
Seen any crime around here?

328
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,575
唯一的罪犯我知道，是我们拖车里的空气条件
Only crime I'm aware of is
the air conditioning in my trailer.

329
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,876
在哪儿你能在坐便器上炸鸡蛋
You could fry an egg on the toilet seat in there.

330
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,416
然后我要带领演员们在沙洲上挖掘骨架
Then I've got a lead actor digging up skeletons

331
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,510
的确我需要去想想
in sandbars, exactly what I need to be thinking about

332
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,747
同时拍一张照片
while I'm shooting a picture.

333
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:54,190
Goldman先生，这电影是Julus Balboni投资拍摄的吗？
Mr. Goldman, is Mr. Julius Balboni producing this film?

334
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,250
拍摄？
Producing?

335
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,796
我必须要操一下我的前任代理人
I must've really fucked up in my previous incarnation.

336
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,731
也许我陷进了Tltanlc
Maybe I sunk the Tltanlc

337
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,201
或者是被Archduke Ferdinand谋杀了
or assassinated Archduke Ferdinand.

338
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,862
我是唯一的制片人
I am the only producer.

339
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,998
所以Balboni先生撒谎
So Mr. Balboni's lying.

340
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:13,511
Balboni投资了一些钱到动作电影
Mr. Balboni is investing some of his money in a motion picture.

341
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,410
那样犯法吗？
Is that illegal?

342
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,209
祝贺你
Congratulations.

343
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,217
你和这个人的生意会让你们发家致富的
You in business with the man that hung Fulvio Raneri's cousin

344
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,947
比山西煤老板还有钱
up by his colon on a meat hook.

345
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,387
你认识这个女孩吗？
Do you recognize this girl,

346
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,015
Cherry LeBlanc?

347
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,528
怎么样，Hogman?
How you are, Hogman?

348
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,135
到走廊上来
Come on up on the porch.

349
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,398
座到椅子上
Grab a chair.

350
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,839
你知道那个LeBlanc女孩吗？
You knew that LeBlanc girl,didn't you?

351
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,438
我不喜欢管白人兄弟么的事情
I don't like to have nothing
to do with white folks' business,

352
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,849
但是那些人对那个女孩做的事令我很烦
but it bothers me what somebody do to that girl.

353
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,854
在她离开之前，我和她交谈了大约两小时
I spoke to her about two hours before she left the juke.

354
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,014
她说"Hogman
She said, "Hogman,

355
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,354
在下辈子，我们再结婚吧”
in the next life, me and you going to get married."

356
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,859
这是她说的
That's what she said.

357
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:40,762
我说“亲爱的，被让人误会你改邪归正，不做鸡了”
I said, "Darling, don't let the men misuse you for no chicken."

358
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,062
她说“我要在Pontchartrain湖边拥有
She said, "I'm going to have myself a town house

359
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,500
一套城里的房子
on Lake Pontchartrain."

360
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,400
她从新奥尔良就和人胡搞吗？
Was she mixed up with somebody from New Orleans?

361
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,134
也许那些白人流氓皮条客告诉她，她很特别
Probably some white-trash pimp told her she special,

362
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,175
她很漂亮
she pretty.

363
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,811
相反，她被自己害死了
Instead,she got herself killed.

364
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,212
你被他们在Atchafalaya找到的骨架
You're mixed up with that skeleton they found

365
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,547
搞糊涂了，是吗？
in the Atchafalaya,ain't you?

366
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,383
你怎么会知道这些？
How do you know about that?

367
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,855
当有人发现一个黑人尸体的时候
When somebody find a dead black man,

368
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:09,485
黑人们都知道
black people knows about it.

369
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,095
我听说的
I'm listening.

370
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,531
一个蓝鸟不能待在潮鸟的窝里
A blue jay don't sit on a mockingbird's nest.

371
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,092
潮鸟会一直朝蓝鸟不断的大叫
The mockingbird will whoop the blue jay's ass every time.

372
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,901
Sam,我们的在这儿谈什么？
What are we talking about here,Sam?

373
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,531
我想说说一个黑人
I'm talking about a black man.

374
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,803
他和一个白种女人举止失常
And he was carrying on with a white woman

375
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,003
他为那女人的丈夫工作
who husband he worked for.

376
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,980
我想他们就是，你们在沙州挖到的骨架
I think them was his bones you dug in that sandbar.

377
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,447
他叫什么名字？
What was his name?

378
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,949
谁在乎他们的名字？
Who care what's his name?

379
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,077
我想他得到了，他想要的
I think he got what he asked for.

380
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,643
我说，“过去就是过去
I say, "Past is past,

381
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,383
不会被遗忘的”
and don't be messing with it."

382
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,754
你在警告我？
You warning me?

383
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,190
那个白种女人叫什么？
What was that white woman's name?

384
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,064
现在我要去照看我的豆子了
I got to go start my beans now.

385
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,003
Alafair,

386
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,273
你把这个小棕熊放在我的煎饼派上了
you got to keep this raccoon out of my fried pie.

387
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,871
下一次他要是再进来，我就要用我的扫帚打他了
Next time he come in here,I'm gonna swat him with my broom.

388
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,679
Tripod 只是个动物
Tripod's just an animal.

389
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,050
你为什么不把这个臭烘烘的家伙踢出院子？
Why don't you try kicking the smell of cigars out of the yard?

390
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,750
Alafair,你不应该和Batist这样说话
Alafair, you shouldn't talk to Batist like that.

391
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,486
他用暴力的手段恐吓Tripod
But he threatened Tripod with menacing violence.

392
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,085
 Tripod是个小浣熊宝宝
Tripod's a raccoon, baby.

393
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,721
快向Batist道歉
Apologize to Batist.

394
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,265
我对刚才的话道歉
Sorry for what I said.

395
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,267
不过这是被Dave逼的
And I'm saying it'cause Dave made me.

396
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,466
真是个漂亮的孩子，Dave
That's a beautiful child,Dave.

397
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,840
顺便告诉你，要是她十八岁了
By the time she's 18 years old,

398
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,471
你的头发会全变白
your hair's going to be solid white,

399
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,674
而且头发会掉的像葛优一样
if there's any of it left.

400
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,529
真是太好了
This is great!

401
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,569
我喜欢这儿
I love it.

402
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,435
你也开着一个小店
You run a bait shop too.

403
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,939
干得怎么样了，Robicheaux先生？
How you doing,Mr. Robicheaux?

404
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,238
今晚我们想请你们，大家去吃晚饭
We want to have dinner with y'all tonight.

405
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,675
谢谢，不过我婆姨已经做好晚饭了
Oh, thanks, but my wife's already cooking supper.

406
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:07,973
我去参加一个秀场，正好路过这里
I was just on my way over there to take a shower.

407
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,308
哦，快赶路
Well, hurry up.

408
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,214
我们在大娘水饺订了位置，大家都来
We got reservations at Clementine's, everybody.

409
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,809
我们全家今天晚上有活动，Sykes先生
The family has plans for this evening, Mr. Sykes.

410
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:18,049
真是令人难堪，El
This is embarrassing, El.

411
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,990
我订了位置
I have a reservation.

412
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,549
我不想去，因为有很多麻烦事
Hey, I don't want　to cause any problems.

413
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,618
我们干脆在你的商店里，把酒拿出来
We'll just pick up　our liquids at your store here

414
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,994
不醉不归，怎么样？
and hit the road, okay?

415
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:31,559
 Sykes先生...

416
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,762
你曾经酒后驾驶
you've been driving drunk,

417
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,703
你到一个警官家里，去买很多酒
and you come to a cop's house to buy more booze.

418
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,139
为什么你不让Drummond小姐来开车
Why don't you hand those keys to Ms. Drummond

419
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,180
在你醉倒在路上之前？
before you hit the road?

420
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:45,850
啤酒在哪儿？
Where's that beer at?

421
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,455
Hey.

422
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,785
你是个好同志
You're a good man.

423
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,223
你们真的要小心点
Y'all need to be real careful.

424
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,722
Elrod是个傻鸟，但我爱他
Elrod's a shitbird,but I love him.

425
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,704
很好
It's all right.

426
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,966
不凑巧，记着下次
Bad timing.Put it there.

427
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,439
好的，下次
Cool.Next time.

428
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,067
Hey.

429
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,132
好的
All right.

430
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,146
哦，该死，我们要给钱
Um, shit.We'll settle up.

431
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,944
我们下次再给钱，好吧？
We'll settle up later,yeah?

432
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,542
好的
All right.

433
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,587
去那边
Other side.

434
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,613
过来
Come here.

435
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,159
好了，过来
Come on.Come here.

436
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,755
Elrod.

437
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,695
什么？看清楚
What?Check this out.

438
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:34,732
你要停下吗？
Will you stop?

439
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,495
El!

440
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,468
看看我
Check me out.

441
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,034
怎么样？我自己搞的
S'more?Made 'em myself.

442
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,206
哦，谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

443
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,749
Elrod Sykes穿着Dave的运动衫
Elrod Sykes is wearing Dave's jersey.

444
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:52,908
你相信吗？
Can you believe it?

445
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,748
快去做功课
Now go do your homework.

446
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,879
喝点什么？
Something to drink?

447
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,253
青岛啤酒怎么样？
How about a beer?

448
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,191
我想我们没有
I think we're out.

449
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,023
我确定哪儿还有一瓶
I'm sure there's one in there somewhere.

450
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,454
我要去喂Alafair的兔子了
I'm going to go feed Alafair's rabbits.

451
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,022
你想一起来吗？
You care to join me?

452
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,193
好，好，我去
Yeah, yeah, sure.

453
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,817
过来这儿，Leroy
Get back there, Leroy.

454
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:27,852
来吧
Go on.

455
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,524
你晚上能在柏树林里看到光亮吗？
You ever seen lights in the cypress trees at night?

456
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,028
那是沼泽的沼气
That's swamp gas.

457
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,530
他们能被点燃，到处飘荡，像球状闪电
It'll ignite and roll out across
the waters like ball lightning.

458
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,964
不，长官，不是这些
No, sir,that's not what it is.

459
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,593
看见那些人在湖的远处出来
See these guys out yonder by the lake.

460
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,605
他们提着灯笼，从一些救护车里出来
They have lanterns hanging from some of their ambulances.

461
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,870
很多士兵的伤口上张满了蛆
A lot of those soldiers had maggots in their wounds.

462
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,274
这就是他们活着的原因
That's the only reason they lived.

463
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,506
用那些蛆来治理传染病
It's 'cause the maggots ate out the infection.

464
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,979
你好像已经醉了很长时间了，Elrod
You've been drunk a long time, Elrod.

465
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,484
等一会儿，所有的树和鳄鱼都会和你说话
Pretty soon all the trees and alligators will be talking to you.

466
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,646
有一次一朵野兰花对我唱了一首歌
A wild orchid sang a song to me one time.

467
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,950
她发出美妙的声音
She had the prettiest voice.

468
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,285
是的，我没醉
Yeah, I wasn't drunk.

469
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,458
这个家伙，一个将军
This guy, a general,

470
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,222
他拄着一根拐杖在水里
he's standing on a crutch right by the water.

471
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,230
他和我说话
And he said to me,

472
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,199
你和你的法律界朋友必须击败他们
"You and your friend the law man must repel them."

473
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,825
我看你在胡言乱语
I think you're delusional.

474
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,767
你可能想去参加一个AA制的聚会
You might want to think about
going to an AA meeting

475
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,238
还带着我一起
with me one time.

476
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,242
可能我喝了一点
Maybe I was a little drunk.

477
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,210
这家伙的鼻子怎么了？
What happened to this dude's nose?

478
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,679
浣熊咬的
Coon bit him.

479
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,553
Lou Girard总是在晚上打电话找我
Lou Girard always called at night.

480
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,460
我曾经在新奥尔良查尔斯湖的水沟里面
I had picked him out of gutters

481
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,726
把他捞起来
from New Orleansto Lake Charles,

482
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,825
在他绝境中救他一命
held him when he had the shakes,

483
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:55,601
带他回到正常的生活中来
driven him to AA meetings moretimes than I could remember.

484
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,835
同时，他也知恩图报
And he had done the same for me.

485
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,103
谢谢你打电话给我， Lou
Thanks for the call, Lou.

486
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,940
我看见那些电子磁带
Yeah, when I saw that electrical tape

487
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,606
缠绕在她的手、脚，或者其他身体部分
around her hands and her feet,or what's left of them,

488
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,116
我想到你，你正在调查LeBlanc的案子
I thought about you and that LeBlanc case you got going.

489
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,550
现在她在哪儿？
Where she at now?

490
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,919
她还在哪儿，还在桶里
She's right there,still in that barrel.

491
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,982
大约15个蓝螃蟹在她上面
She got about 15 big blue crabs on her.

492
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:21,932
验尸官说，我们移动她，会让她变成碎片
Coroner says, we move her,she's coming out in pieces.

493
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,662
我们将给个粗略的时间给她一个编号，也许
We're going to have a rough time getting an ID, maybe.

494
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,795
也许根据她的牙齿
Maybe by her teeth.

495
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,532
那个家伙找到她
That's the poor bastard who found her.

496
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,700
你什么时间发现这个桶的？
When did you first notice that barrel?

497
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,075
大概在3～4个星期前
About four or three weeks back.

498
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,808
在哪儿看到什么其他人了吗？
See anyone else out there on that levee?

499
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,045
有啊，大概在一个月前的一个早上
Yeah, about a month ago in the evening,

500
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,713
我看到一辆黑色的车
I seen a dark-colored car.

501
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,655
我记得很清楚，它是崭新的，你知道
I remember thinking,it was brand-new, you know?

502
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,454
没人愿意把他们的新车开道
Why would anybody want to bring their new car

503
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,051
这个满地污泥和坑坑洼洼的路上来
down on that dirt road full of holes?

504
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,324
你记得是什么牌子的车吗？
You remember what kind of car it was?

505
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,831
不，长官，对不起
No, sir.I'm sorry.

506
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:59,063
我只是希望，不是我唯一找到这个可怜的女孩
I just wish I hadn't been the one to find that poor woman.

507
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,332
我一直没能看看桶里面
And, hey, I'm never going to look inside

508
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,430
的另一个桶
another barrel again.

509
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,474
不，我，不
Not me, no.

510
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,839
你做得很好，谢谢你
That'll do.Thank you.

511
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,639
政府会发给你奖状
Officer Guidry going to take you home.

512
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,304
谢谢
Thank you.

513
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,605
我需要一辆拖车来拖走一样加长豪华车
I need a tow truck to haul off a limousine.

514
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,869
什么位置？
Where about?

515
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,910
别让他跑了
Can't miss it.

516
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,206
中央电视台门口
Right in front of Chez Narcisse.

517
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,337
什么时候？就现在
- When?- Right now.

518
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,641
明白，谢谢，Chere
- Copy that.- Thank you, chere.

519
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,419
你能让罗马军队到这儿来
You could get the Roman Army down here.

520
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,822
想象一下这些家伙
One dlvision of these guys

521
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,689
经过一年的城市战争
could've knocked off these squlrrel hunters,

522
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,353
不能击败这里的Squlrrel猎人
had the Civil War over in one year.

523
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,487
你知道为什么？
You know what?

524
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,759
也许我们会拍一部圣经电影
Maybe we'll do a Bible movie next.

525
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,528
但是穿着凉鞋怎么作战呢？
Yeah, but how do you fight a war with sandals?

526
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,399
那个...愚蠢
That's... stupid.

527
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,768
穿着凉鞋怎么去赢得一场战争呢？
How did they win wars with sandals, hm?

528
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,382
发生什么了，Dave?
What's going on, Dave?

529
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,984
经过昨晚的漫漫长夜
Had a long night last night.

530
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:08,726
在南京路发现了一个装在桶里的女孩
Found a girl in a barrel down in south St. Martin Parish.

531
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,199
她上面爬满了篮螃蟹
She covered up in blue crabs.

532
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,530
你应该放她了走
You ought to run her again.

533
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,570
我都想吃螃蟹
We'll have gumbo.

534
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,137
在这儿吃早餐吗？
You here for breakfast?

535
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,606
坐下
Sit down.

536
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,885
你为这点小事生气
You're pissed off about some little thing,

537
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,084
所以拖走了我的车
so you have my car towed.

538
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,093
你不能把车停在消防栓的前面
You need to quit parking in front of fireplugs.

539
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,686
消防栓，就因为消防栓，我就受到如此羞辱？
Fireplugs; I'm getting this kind of shit because of fireplugs?

540
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,026
不，Juli
No, Julie.

541
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,090
我想知道，你曾经利用一个叫Cherry LeBlanc的年轻人
I want to know what you have to do with a teenage hooker

542
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,158
都干了什么
named Cherry LeBlanc.

543
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,828
谁是他妈的Cherry LeBlanc
Who the fuck is Cherry LeBlanc?

544
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,894
你知道她是谁
You know who she is.

545
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,337
你和Cholo曾经谈起过她
You and Cholo were talking about her

546
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,570
上次我们在度假酒店，在这事情上你说了谎
before I got to the Holiday Inn,and you lied to me about it.

547
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,872
要告我说谎吗?
Calling me a liar?

548
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,810
你这个猪狗不如的骗子（直译太恶心了，换个词）
You're a motherfucking lying piece of dog shit.

549
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,814
我想在这个可爱的小镇上
I think this sweet little town's

550
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,349
可以开始灭了你，David
starting to rub off on you, David.

551
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,112
先生们，请你们...
Gentlemen, could you please...

552
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,675
我意思是，不要说脏话...
I mean,just not use that language...

553
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,244
从我桌子上滚开
Get the fuck away from my table!

554
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,289
好吧，Meaux先生
It's all right,Mr. Meaux.

555
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,687
我马上会走
I'll be gone in a second.

556
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,886
哦，真是可惜
Oh, sad to hear that.

557
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,862
这些女孩我什么都不知道
I don't know none of these girls.

558
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:17,732
我什么犯法的事情也没做
I don't have nothing to do with your business.

559
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,100
你说那些关于我的丑事，Dave
You said some ugly things about me, Dave,

560
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,503
我会敬而远之
and I'm going to let it slide.

561
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:23,972
我有家人要养
I'll call a couple of cabs,

562
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,737
我要有豪车要养
I'll pay the fine on my car,

563
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,938
我要买很多奢侈品
I'll buy some new tires,

564
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,345
我会忘记，你曾经对我说的粗话
and I'll forget everything you've been saying to me,

565
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,543
因为我的公司还要运转
because I got a business to run.

566
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,687
在这里每个人都是彬彬有礼
Everybody's been pretty polite here.

567
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,985
保持天真，傻瓜
Keep it simple,stupid.

568
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,925
你是时候让人们得到安静了，Robicheaux先生
It's time for you to let people alone, Mr. Robicheaux.

569
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,430
放松，陆军上尉
Ease off,Lieutenant.

570
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,627
这样对谁都不好
This ain't good for nobody.

571
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,364
好了，好了
Come on.Come on.

572
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,371
你太失败了，Dave
You're losing it, Dave.

573
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,678
你该给自己吃点好的镇定剂
You need to get yourself some better tranqs.

574
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,107
不，长官，我还会请你喝三鹿牌奶粉
No, sir, I wouldn't exactly call it a dead end.

575
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,698
你先坐下，马上和你谈
You have a seat,I'll be right with you.

576
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,069
谢谢你
Thank you.

577
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,478
我们一直用三鹿
It's $100-million contract.

578
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,573
那可是国家免检的大名牌啊
He must've pocketed $60 million, $70 million.

579
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,212

国务院的领导和省市的五套班子都在用
Balboni Trucking hauled just about enough debris

581
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,624

582
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,125
是的，长官，我们还喝
Yes, sir,we are trying.

583

对不起，我是...
I'm sorry.I was...

589
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,398
我是上面给你派来的小蜜

不管怎样，我是特别助理Rosa Gomez

598
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,918
所以你求助FBI?
So you called the FBI?

599
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,020
FBI的一个应急管理小组已经被牵扯到
The FBI's been trying to nall Balboni

600
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,588
Nall Balboni的案子一年之久
for over a year now on a FEMA scam.

601
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,567
他们在他身上什么也没找到
And they still have precisely nothing on him.

602
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,104
这就是为什么，我想他们希望更多
That's why I think they're hoping there's more

603
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,833
的投入Cherry Leblanc的案子

我想你也应该出席
I think you, too,should attend.

608
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,251
可以分享这些案件的类似资料

609

他们中的10个有个共同的特点
And ten of them share multiple common denominators.

610
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,994
有很多共同的地方
All show marks from being bound,

611
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,326
都很年轻，工薪阶层

00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,229
两个是服务生，三个曾经离家出走

614

FBI在Iberia整个教区，有信息优势

616

你喜欢吃正宗的四川麻辣烫吗？
How do you like that catfish court bouillon?

617
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,478
我爱吃
Uh, it's interesting.

618
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,153
要是你发现一个黑人的尸体碎片
If you found the remains of a black man

619
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,689
没有皮带，靴子上没有鞋带
and he had no belt,no laces in his boot,

620
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,384
你对这种事会有什么看法呢？
what speculation would you make about him?

621
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,622
很明显他曾经待在牢房，教区，城市收容所
Obviously he'd been in jail,a parish, or city holding tank,

622
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,823
那些防止他做出自残的地方
some place where they were afraid he'd do harm to himself.

623
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,331
我也是怎么想的
That's what I think.

624
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,839
真疯狂，就像拍广告

625
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,405
这个有你的名字在上面

离开这里

谢谢，我已经吃过了

631

是陈冠希他爹吧

那是我的安全部门的另一半职责
That's the other half of my security service business.

633
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,454
他在这儿干什么？
What's he doing here?

634
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,853
它是个电影投资人
He's an investor in the movie

635
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,357
想来赌一把
and trying to get laid.

636
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,791
真搞笑
That's funny.

637
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,728
你喜欢和陈冠希老爸一起做事？
You like doing business with Twinky LeMoyne?

638

对我有好处

给他做，没什么大麻烦，真的

640
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,362

I mean, if there's a business around here making money,

641
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,926
你肯定会发现他占有一席之地
you can be sure he's got a plece of it.

642
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,372
照一张
Take a picture?

643
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,418
什么？
What?
Picture?

644
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,816
好
Yeah.

645

不想和我握手吗？
Do you object to shaking hands?

650
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,367
我死了吗？
Am I dead?

651
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,309
你没有看见我吗
You don't look like it to me.

652
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,279
你们现在铁岭，战争结束了
You were at Gettysburg.The war's over.

653
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,507
永远不会结束
It's never over.

654
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,016
我想你知道这个道理
I would think you'd know that.

655
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,144
你是个美国军队里的陆军中尉，对吗？
You were a lieutenant in the United States Army, weren't you?

656
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:01,282
我头疼，我的头...
My head hurts.My head...

657
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,689
真的是很疼

658
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,127
贪婪和邪恶的人们正在摧毁这个世界
Venal and evll people are destroying the world

659
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,495
你出现在这里

660
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,591
因为我们反抗他们，我的好朋友
It's us against them,my good friend.

661
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:15,537
对你的原则不能妥协，不要放弃你的目标
Don't compromise your principles or abandon your cause.

662
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,040
你知道，下一步是什么在等着我们吗？
Do you know what's waiting for me on down the road?

663
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:22,238
一个原因或另一个
For one reason or another,

664
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,612
我发现我对过去比将来，有更多的洞察力，
I find I have more insight into the past than the future.

665
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,243
尝试保持这些在我头脑中
Try to keep this in mind:

666
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,150
就像当他们装备了他们的加农炮
It's just like when they load their cannon

667
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,588
带着马靴和铁链
with horseshoes and log chain.

668
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,182
想象一下要塞应该坚持到最后
You'd think the barrage would last forever.

669
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,423
那是多么的波澜壮阔
Then all of a sudden,there's a sllence

670
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,294
比加农炮的炮声还响亮
louder than the cannon flre.

671
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:45,301
请别被我的激烈的比喻吓坏
Please don't be alarmed by the severity of my comparison.

672
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,706
晚上过得愉快，陆军中尉
Have a good night, Lieutenant.

673
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,186
带你来的护理人员说
Paramedics who brought you in

674
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,062
你被从沼泽中救出后，一直好像在
said you were talking about Confederate soldiers

675
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,100
和联盟士兵交谈
out in the swamp.

676
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,192
一个不平凡的夜晚
It was an usual night.

677
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,000
为什么像这样一个具有好莱坞风格的情形
What's the possibillity that one of those Hollywood characters

678
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,232
发生在你身上？
laced your Dr. Pepper?

679
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,604
什么意思？
Do what?

680
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,577
你的表现真是太不可思议了
The tox screen came back positive for LSD.

681
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:33,208
我想和局长谈谈
I need to talk to the sheriff.

682
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,683
局长今天早上来过这里
The sheriff was here this morning.

683
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,583
你和他谈了半个小时
You talked to him for half an hour.

684
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:38,955
我说了什么？
What'd I say?

685
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,253
什么也没有讲
Nothing that made any sense to me.

686
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,631
当你从水里把他卷起来
When you reel him in through the water,

687
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:54,160
那小腿和肩膀就像在游泳一样
his little legs and tail wiggle like he was swimming.

688
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,001
让黑人男低音生气
Makes the black bass hungry.

689
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:05,441
你如何来定义“理解”的意义
How would you define the idea of understanding?

690
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:16,023
哦，知道某件事，以及它的含义
Well, it's knowing somethingand knowing what it means.

691
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,654
我想有两个途径
I think there's two ways

692
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:22,096
去看待“理解”的含义
of looking at the idea of understanding.

693
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,533
第一，要是你不看，那你永远也别去看
One is, if you don't look,you never will see.

694
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,537
以此类推，要是你看见了一小丁点
And the other is,if you look a little less,

695
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,470
你可能看到他妈的很多
you might see a hell of a lot more.

696
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,477
你可能无法阻止他们在你的饮料里放毒品
You might not be over those drugs they put in your drink.

697
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,710
我知道得克萨斯Calvary的John Bell Hood将军
I know General John Bell Hood of the Texas Calvary

698
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,614
他看上去就向我的祖父
just like he was my own grandfather.

699
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,837
你在谴责我和黑手党一起干吗？
Are you accusing me of working with the mafia?

700
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,771
当你和像Jull Balboni那样的人一起做生意的时候
When you do business with a man like Julle Balboni,

701
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,037
你就让大家建立了对你的好奇心
you create a certain amount of curiosity about yourself.

702
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,011
我和他没有商业合作
I don't do business with him.

703
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,910
我没有和他做过任何事
I don't do anything with him.

704
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,677
我是个投资者组织的会员

705
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,982
在新奥尔良，这个组织向

706
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,954
电影拍摄做投资
in New Iberia.

707
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:22,618
投资本地的经济，就是这样
Investing in the local economy,that's all.

708
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,718
你雇用他的人吗？
Are your employees union people?

709
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,628
不，他们当然不是
No, they certainly are not.

710
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,666
你自己的一半安全服务是Murphy Douct负责
You own half of a security service with Murphy Doucet,

711
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,700
对吗？

712
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,395
对的，当然是的
That's right,I certainly do.

713
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,130
而你的安全服务人员

又在给他做卡车驾驶员

715
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,668
我想你的非常的自相矛盾
I think you're involved in some strange contradictions,

716
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:39,834
LeMoyne先生
Mr. LeMoyne.

717
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,777
你必须原谅我，侦探先生
You'll have to excuse me,Detective.

718
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,212
现在我要锁门了
I've got to lock up now.

719
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,409
我有很多人要关心，你知道？

和他会会吗？

722
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,981
你想你的孙女也
Would you like to have your granddaughter

723
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,457
为他工作吗？

724
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,754
Mr. Roblcheaux,

725
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:01,196
我没法形容，你的作为多么的令人讨厌
I can't express to you how offensive you are.

726
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,459
你想让这个金发女郎

727
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,795
这些晚上舔你的大腿吗？

越狱事件：Landry教区

738
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,798
你说一个黑鬼？
A nigger,you say?

739
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,028

一个叫DeWitt Prejean的黑人

哦，我记得那个婊子养的

742
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:22,739
他怎么了？
What about him?

743
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:26,544
你能记起来那天晚上，是谁在监狱里殴打他吗？
Were you on duty the night somebody broke him out of jail?

744
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,744
我是个管教干部
I was the jailer.

745
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,309
管教干部晚上不上班
Jailers don't work nights.

746
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,184
他们另外请了个人干这事

747
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,590
你记得Prejean先生，是被指控什么罪名坐牢的吗？
Do you remember what Mr. Prejean was charged with?

748
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,491
他不会平白无故被抓
He wasn't charged with nothing.

749
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,893
肯定有原因
Never got to that.

750
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,555
他们在里面暴打他
They busted him out of the tank.

751
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,894
报纸上胡说
Not according to the newspaper.

752
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,634
大家都用报纸来擦屁股
Lot of people wipe their asses with newspaper.

753
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:50,002
报纸上说他带着菜刀，冲进了一个

DeWitt Prejea是个强奸犯吗?

756
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,339
他管不住他裤裆那个东西
He couldn't keep his prick in his pants,

757
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,646
你明白我的意思
if that's what you mean.

758
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,380
Hebert先生，我能坐在这儿吗?
Is it all right if I sit down here, Mr. Hebert?

759
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,421
可以
Sure.

760
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,592
你认为是他丈夫在监狱外面揍了那小子吗？
You think her husband broke him out of jail?

761
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,393
要是他能行，我想他会这样干的
He might have if he could've.

762
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,199
他是个残废人
He was a crippled man.

763
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,933
在战争里中了枪伤
Got shot up in a war.

764
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,304
他现在住在哪里？
Where's he at now?

765
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,673
从镇的东面沿着这条路
He's in the cemetery out by the tracks,

766
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:31,941
公墓旁
east of town.

767
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,917
那个女人怎么样？
What about the woman?

768
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,819
她搬走了，去了北方
She moved away,up north somewhere.

769
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,856
你对这个40岁的黑鬼这么感兴趣？
What's your interest in this 40-year-old nigger trouble?

770
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,556
我想我看见他被杀了
I think I saw him killed.

771
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:52,466
越狱当晚负责看守的人在哪儿？
Where's the man who was on duty the night of the jailbreak?

He got drunk and got his self run over by a train.

773
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,174
等一下

774
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,940
你说什么？
What'd you say?

00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,071
你是说...?
You saw what?

776
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,351
你觉得我在说什么，Hebert先生
What you think I saw,Mr. Hebert?

777
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,157

你要去抓个厉害家伙

别伤害我的感情

据说她叫Amber

有个渔民，自称是Amber

794

妈的，长得皮包骨的一样的女孩

816
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,783
我想他还在哪儿
I think he's still in there.

817
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,333
看上去她面部中了一枪
Looks like she took one right in the face.

818
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:50,202
什么意思，“她”？
What you mean, "she"?

819
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,605
你干掉的就是Amber Martinez

823
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:23,132
告诉我怎么做
Tell me to do it.

824
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,156
我想那儿开枪太快了
I opened up on that Buick too soon.

825
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:49,187
你觉得你有生命危险，Lleutenant
You thought your life was at rlsk, Lleutenant.

826
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,893
我希望你不介意我在这儿
I hope you don't mind my being here.

827
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,332
不
No.

828
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,437
你不该自责
You shouldn't have remorse.

829
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:01,170
只是求生的本能，不代表你没有人性
A desire to live doesn't mean you lack humanity.

830
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,735
有人想让我发疯
Somebody's trying to drive me crazy.

831
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,213
我不再相信，我看到和听到的任何事
Can't believe what I see or hear anymore.

832
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:13,246
他们说我杀了一个手无寸铁的女人
They say I killed an unarmed woman.

833
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,156
我想这些，也让让我很难受
I think that would probably bother me too.

834
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:20,526
我看着那个女人，她的头，她的头发
I keep seeing that woman, the back of her head,

835
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:24,465
爬倒在地毯上，到处是血
her hair glued down to the carpet with her own blood.

836
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,297
想想你刚才说的
Think about what you just said.

837
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,270
你是个聪明人
You're an intelligent man.

838
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,102
告诉自己，你眼里是什么？
What does your eye tell you?

839
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,270
我需要帮助
I need help.

840
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,144
外面，南方的风
The wind's out of the south.

841
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,482
今天下午会狂暴起来
There'll be thunder by afternoon.

842
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,418
声音就想美国姥的加农炮
It'll sound like Yankee cannon fire,

843
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,150
但它只不过是轰鸣
but it'll only be thunder.

844
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,394
将军...
General...

845
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,497
几点了？
What time is it?

846
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,711
为什么Amber Martinex刚好坐在自己车的
Why would Amber Martinez be sitting in the passenger seat

847
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,543
副驾驶位置
of her own car?

848
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:13,981
凶杀调查人员昨晚
What did the homicide investigator

849
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,039
是怎么说的？
have to say last night?

850
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,848
他告诉我，我开了枪
He told me I'm a hell of a shot.

851
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,185
大家都认为我杀了个手无寸铁的女人
Everybody thinks I killed an unarmed woman.

852
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,747
那边一个弹孔都没有
There's not any bullet holes anywhere.

853
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,190
没凶手
There's no casings.

854
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,127
没枪
And there's no gun.

855
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:28,061
是个圈套，Dave
It was a setup, Dave.

856
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:40,472
你们在这里干什么？
What y'all doing out here?

857
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,101
不要破坏了犯罪现场
Can't be messing around a crime scene.

858
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:45,272
我真的是一个现场目击者，Doobie
I'm really just an observer here, Doobie.

859
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,372
她是谁?
Who's she?

860
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,541
特别助理Gomez
Speclal Agent Gomez.

861
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,482
来自FBI的调查部门
This is part of an FBI investigation.

862
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:50,712
你有什么问题吗？
Do you have a problem with that?

863
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,484
为什么把人都清理走了，Robicheaux?
Why piss people off,Robicheaux?

864
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,650
Martin教区不会起诉在这里起诉你
St. Martin Parish ain't going to indict you over this,

865
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,559
但如果我是你，我不会在这犹豫不决
but if I were you,I wouldn't hang around here.

866
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,596
你应该把我清理出场
You might piss me off.

867
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,235
从这个伤口和破坏情况看
Well, from the size of the wound and the impact of the round,

868
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,641
是点45子弹杀了她
I'd say a .45 killed her.

869
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:15,837
看她的头
Look at her head.

870
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,813
我只使用空尖子弹，Sollie
I only use hollow-point ammunition, Sollie.

871
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,852
并不是一颗空尖子弹穿过这女孩的头
It ain't no hollow point passed through this girl's head.

872
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:29,653
她的头发粘在地毯上，血已经干了
Her hair was stuck to the carpet,the blood already dry.

873
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,492
你想告诉我，他死在车上吗？
Did she die in that car,you want to ask me?

874
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,263
她铁青的血告诉我
Her blood lividity tells me

875
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,365
她在进到车里之前，已经死了
that she was dead before she ever got into that car.

876
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:48,536
要是我也在那部别克车前，我们能找到什么？
If I can vacuum the Buick,what are we looking for?

877
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:51,603
我看一些闪光，从别克车那里闪出来
I saw muzzle flashes coming out that Buick.

878
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,911
我在啤酒屋的墙上没找到弹孔
I didn't see no bullet holes in that beer joint wall.

879
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,342
看看你能发现什么
See what you can find out.

880
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:03,617
为什么我们在这儿，我还要抽烟？
What we waiting on here,me to smoke this?

881
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,160
Allons.

882
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,761
谢谢你，Henry
Thank you, Henry.

883
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:14,326
其他人还有什么可以分享吗？
Anybody else got something to share?

884
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,962
我叫Dave
My name's Dave.

885
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,370
我是个酒鬼
I'm an alcoholic.

886
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,378
想来点卡布基诺吗？
Want some cappuccino mix?

887
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:01,975
警官喜欢咖啡，是的，或者一点音乐
You cops like coffee, right,or a stereo?

888
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,918
你知道有人从教区征召女孩们吗？
You know anybody been recruiting girls out the parishes?

889
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,479
为了利益，想找很多人
Try the bus depot,for starters.

890
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,881
但是谁来征召？
But who's going to recruit?

891
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,153
自从卡特里娜飓风过后
Ever since Katrina,

892
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,559
这镇上到处是钱
there's cash on the hoof all over this town.

893
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,155
也许这些家伙大多是皮条客
Maybe this guy does more than just pimp.

894
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:20,100
也许他喜欢伤害这些姑娘
Maybe he likes to hurt these girls.

895
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,899
有两个已经被杀了
Been two of them killed already,

896
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:22,995
也能更多
maybe more.

897
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:25,131
是说关于那些生活在
Talking about somebody that operates way down

898
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,108
在食物链底端的人们，Dave
at the bottom of the food chain, Dave.

899
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,236
你觉得宝贝脚Balboni有什么事要去做
You think Baby Feets Balboni might have something to do

900
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,940
像你这样？
with something like this?

901
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,251
你说的名字是本地人名人
You're using the names of local personalities now.

902
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,018
你在吓我，Jimmie
It stays with me,Jimmie.

903
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,854
你在找那个杀死渔民的凶手？
You looking for a guy who likes to kill hookers?

904
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,725
不是暗示宝贝脚吧
Don't sound like Baby Feet.

905
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,494
他的组织控制着这些女孩，对，但是..
His outfit's running girls,all right, but...

906
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,332
要是她们死了，那不是得不偿失吗
they're not worth nothing to him if they're dead.

907
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,668
试试汽车站
Try the bus station.

908
00:57:56,739 --> 00:58:00,231
找找Adonis Brown
Try Adonis Brown.

909
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:13,116
你们，唉，女士好像迷路了
You, uh,ladies seem lost.

910
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:16,181
你们不是本地人，对吗？
You're not from around here,are you?

911
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:35,873
你能找到一些宁静
You'll be able to find some peace,

912
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,537
我保证
I promlse you.

913
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:38,581
别弄湿了
Don't sweat it.

914
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,754
我想你帮我广播一下
I want you to make a public service announcement for me,

915
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:47,915
chere.

916
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,219
我知道那好像是逃跑
I know what it's like to run away.

917
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,261
感谢上帝
Praise Jesus.

这是电话

923
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,148

别这样，伙计
Don't do that, man.

我没有威胁你

927
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:24,793
看，我没带枪

我想知道这家伙的名字

你已经送那些女孩去了他哪儿

931
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,361
例行公事，对不起
This one's occupied,by the way.

932
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:32,628
没人，我没有带任何人给任何人
Nobody. I ain't bringing nobody to nobody.

933
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,866
你知道我说的是谁
You know the guy I'm talking about.

934
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,907
别再打我了，哥们

935

告诉我名字

939
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:53,051
大头，猪腰子脸的白人
baid-headed,squirrel-faced white guy.

940
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:55,852
他也带着枪
He carries a gun too.

941
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,483
没人跟着他
Nobody fucks with him.

942
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,926
这是你说的那个人吗？
Is that the guy you're talking about?

943
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:02,698
你告诉我
You tell me.

944
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,825
他喝着果汁，就知道这些
He's got juice.That's all I know.

945
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,666
我不知道他的名字，哥们

留言或用手机
With the cops or the mob.

他还在做这个生意

949
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,014
我就知道这么多

950
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,209
你为什么这样对我，伙计
Why you doing this to me, man?

951
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:27,853
上帝
God.

952
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:31,087
我裤子尿湿了
I shit my pants.

953
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,252
我不能回那儿去了
I can't go back out there.

954
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,295
这是对的，Adonis
That's right, Adonis.

955
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,557
你不应该再回到哪儿去了
You ain't ever gonna go back out there.

956
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,928
你要从这个车站，去看医生
You're going to treat that bus station

957
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,229
就像巴格达那样的城市
like it's downtown Baghdad.

958
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,496
很适合你这样的人渣去
Not a good place for you to be.

959
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,798
你他妈的是谁，哥们？
Who the fuck are you, man?

960
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:42,997
你不会想知道我是谁的
You don't want to know who I am.

961
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:44,505
你要做得就是马上行动起来
What you want to do is start acting right

962
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:45,541
彻底洗心革面
and quit doing wrong.

963
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:46,575
不然我会杀了你，Adonis
I'll kill you, Adonis.

964
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,543
我会把你的头拧下来
I'll blow your Goddamn head off

965
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:51,171
如果不离开这个职业，重新做人
if you don't find an honest line of work.

966
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:36,557
你出去了大半晚上
You stay gone most of the night.

967
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,719
也打个电话
You don't call.

968
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,558
对不起
I'm sorry.

969
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,890
我担心你会受伤
I don't deserve to be afraid you've been hurt.

970
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:45,934
不
No.

971
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:49,199
你别
You don't.

972
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:50,967
我也不想唠唠叨叨
But I'm not going to nag you.

973
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,854
我真的需要你的帮助，Dave
I really need your help, Dave.

974
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,761
我真的需要帮助
I really need help.

975
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:16,799
过来
Go ahead.

976
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,265
你去吧，淹死自己，伙计
You go ahead　and drown yourself, man.

977
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,528
我才不管
I don't care.

978
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:23,732
Dave ,我计划了一个星期
Dave,I planned this all week.

979
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,036
这些家伙已经卖这艘船给我了，哥们
The guy already charged me　for the boat, man

980
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,235
Elrod...

981
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,675
马上就要下雨了
It's going　to rain like hell.

982
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,372
现在，为什么你不能等到雨停
Now, why don't you wait until after it quits raining,

983
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,175
你就能到河口去钓到
and you can go fishing for black bass and perch

984
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,443
黑鱼、鲤鱼、黄花鱼
and bream right out here in the bayou.

985
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,314
在大雨之后，这是最后的时间能抓到
When was the last time you caught freshwater fish

986
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:37,352
淡水鱼
after it rained?

987
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,648
哦，天，穿上雨衣
Oh, hell,suit yourself.

988
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,484
你想我一起离开你的放啤酒的冰箱吗？
You want to leave that beer cooler here with me?

989
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,615
搬到船上来，伙计
It came with the boat,dude.

990
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,523
确定你不想一起来吗？
Sure you don't want to come?

991
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,895
Drummond小姐
Miss Drummond,

992
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,434
你现在小心驾驶这条船
you need to get yourself off of that boat right now.

993
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,266
求你了，可是Kelly
Please,it's Kelly.

994
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,441
注意水道的转弯部分
Watch the bend in the channel.

995
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,670
在南面三英里
It's about three miles south.

996
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,769
水很浅
The water's been low

997
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:04,938
渔网上漂在
and gill nets are on the left

998
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,642
次氯酸钠的瓶子上
floating on Clorox bottles.

999
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,048
我知道了
I got it.

1000
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,550
你好
Hello?

1001
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:53,022
你开到多远了？
How far down the bayou?

1002
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,962
到了你警告的那个转弯处了
Well, that's that bend Batist warned you about.

1003
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,301
你打来有什么事，Elrod?
What you asking me, Elrod?

1004
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,565
你能过来帮帮我们吗？
Can you come give us a hand?

1005
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,970
我会去帮忙
Yeah,I'll come help you out.

1006
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,805
但你们浪费我的时间，是要付钱的
But I am also going to bill you for my time.

1007
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,532
没问题
I got it.

1008
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:51,787
你们被渔网缠住了？
How'd you hit the gill net?

1009
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:55,085
你没看见浮瓶吗？
Dldn't you see the bottles?

1010
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,124
哦，伙计
Oh, man...

1011
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,251
我是个傻瓜，对吗?
I'm an idiot,right?

1012
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,617
你想让我跳到水里?
You want me to get down in the water?

1013
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,157
是的
Yeah.

1014
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,352
到底下去，在我让发动机反转的时候
Get down by the bow and be ready to push

1015
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,327
你就推开那些东西
when I put the motors in reverse.

1016
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,626
哦，这周围有鳄鱼出没吗？
Hey, are there any alligators around here?

1017
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,132
哦，见鬼
Oh, hell yeah.

1018
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,100
尽管他们还不饿
They're not hungry, though.

1019
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:41,363
好吧
All right.

1020
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,472
穿上救生衣吧，El
Put on a life jacket, El.

1021
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:52,810
没事，亲爱的
Okay, honey.

1022
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,406
我曾经在Trinity河里游过泳
I swam the Trinity River once.

1023
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,178
看看水下的其他情况
Watch out for water moccasins.

1024
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,083
什么？
What?

1025
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,551
别担心他
Don't worry about him.

1026
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:05,958
这里水很浅的
That water's not very deep.

1027
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:07,495
我去给他拿件救生衣
I've got to give him a life jacket.

1028
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,757
他在厨房的水槽里也会淹死
He'd drown in a bathroom sink.

1029
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,499
穿上这个
Here you go.

1030
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:21,737
你什么都没有，Kelly小姐
It's nothing personal,Miss Kelly.

1031
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,405
但我想你是非常好，非常漂亮的女人
But I think you're a very fine,beautiful young woman.

1032
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,947
我已经湿透了
I'm already soaked.

1033
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,519
我的负担非常重
I was burdened greatly

1034
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:17,327
因为在我周围有很多的死亡，Lieutenant
by the deaths of those around me, Lieutenant.

1035
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,994
他们的痛苦集合在一起
But incorporating their suffering

1036
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:25,405
进入我们的生命，但却不能改变这个世界
into our own lives does not change the way of the world.

1037
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,318
一个善意的行为
An act of kindness,

1038
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:43,051
就像我送雨衣给这个女孩，这样简单的事
one as simple as giving a girl my raincoat,

1039
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,822
却导致了她的死亡

1040
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,929
杀手已经离开了那里

1041
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,833
没有弹壳
no ejected brass,

1042
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,997
没有逃跑痕迹
no recoverable prints.

1043
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,234
我们没有嫌疑对象
We had no suspects.

1044
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,069
一颗心沉没了
But one heart-sinking

1045
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:07,809
事情无可挽回的发生了
and unalterable conclusion remained.

1046
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,443
Kelly Drummond被杀了

1047
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:15,149
她的被杀，是因为被错误的当成了我

1048

悲惨的死亡

现在被确认死亡

1052
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,926
是一个悲剧性的事故中

1053
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,696
源自Sheriff部门消息

1054

他们相信这致命的枪击

1055
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,869

01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,052
我会想念她，Dave

1057
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,727
你想让他暂时在这儿吗？

他的情况很坏

1059

这是我们的家

Sykes先生真是吐得气势如虹

1061
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:03,864
去睡觉

1062
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:10,109
他只是需要个AA制朋友，或者他不想这样
The guy needs an AA friend,or he's not going to make it.

1063
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,669
那怎么样？我不管
So what?I don't care.

1064
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:14,773
告诉你为什么，我会让你清楚原因

首先他喝醉了

他的电影明星拖车房

他自己支付他吃的食物

他不占用卫生间

他晚上不能进来

1071
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,928
好吧，但是只是几天时间

1072
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,370
你喜欢做一个电影明星吗？
Do you like being a movie star?

1073
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:48,848
那只是一个职业，亲爱的

你的签字钢笔

床垫上都是尿渍
Mattress is covered in piss stains.

1101
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,891
水槽里都是垃圾
The sink is full of raw garbage.

1102
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,396
枪在哪儿？
Where's the gun at?

1103
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,863
床边
By the bedside.

1104
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,331
要是Lou Girard想要去自杀
If Lou Girard wanted to kill his self,

1105
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:48,632
为什么不用.357口径的枪？
how come he didn't use that .357?

1106
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,171
因为他烂醉如泥
'Cause he was drunk on his ass.

1107
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,208
对他是个不平常的状况
Not an unusual condition for him.

1108
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:56,403
他在帮我查一个案子，Doobie
He was helping me on a case, Doobie.

1109
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,638
言下之意？
And?

1110
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:58,941
也许他找到了什么东西
Maybe he found out something

1111
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,572
是有人不想让他发现的
somebody did notwant him to know.

1112
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:06,721
他一直非常害怕，每天晚上靠吃药来入睡
He was trembling,eating pills every morning,

1113
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:09,451
就像所有人面对的
in front of everybody.

1114
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,823
今晚发生的事，也没什么大惊小怪的
There's no big mystery to what happened here tonight.

1115
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,556
它是个好警察
He was a good cop.

1116
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,929
他是个可怜的酒鬼
He was a sorry-ass drunk.

1117
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,564
要是你还想看看其他的，赶快
Now, if you want to look at anything else, hurry up.

1118
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,902
我要去贴封条了
I'm going to seal the place.

1119
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:28,067
你到等在外面一会儿，我不胜感激
I appreciate you waiting outside just for a moment.

1120
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,407
事实上，你要是离我远点，我会很感激你
Matter of fact, I appreciate you staying as far away from me

1121
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,071
有多远滚多远
as you can possibly get.

1122
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,332
那些Lou用生命为代价，找出的是什么？
What had Lou found out that had cost him his life?

1123
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:37,072
Hogman Patin知道很多，却说得很少
Hogman Patin knew a lot and seldom said anything.

1124
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,614
现在却带信，说想和我谈谈
Now I got word he wanted to talk to me.

1125
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,850
我开始在想，当我在围栏里的时候
I started to think about when I was in the pen.

1126
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,584
你爸爸，他给我妈妈带去食物
And your daddy,he brought my mother food

1127
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,250
在她生病的时候，为她在商店
and paid for her medicine up at the store

1128
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:54,352
购买药品
when she was sick.

1129
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,261
你有什么事情要和我说，Sam?
You got something to say to me, Sam?

1130
01:13:56,331 --> 01:14:00,028
你在沙洲里挖出的那个黑鬼，他叫什么名字？
What was the name of that nigger you dug up out the sandbar?

1131
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,865
DeWitt Prejean.

1132
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,774
他和一个白人的妻子通奸
He was fucking a white man's wife.

1133
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,365
开始问为什么，他要在生命中这么做
Start asking what he's doing for a living,

1134
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:11,402
你会找到那个，给你带来所有痛苦的人
and you'll find the people been causing you all this grief.

1135
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,141
我找的人是谁？
Who's the man I'm looking for?

1136
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:18,079
我说了所有我能说得
I said all I can say.

1137
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,417
这里始终是路易斯安那州（有种族歧视历史）
This still the state of Louisiana.

1138
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:39,096
干嘛要吓我？
Why you keep bothering me?

1139
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,507
我想知道DeWitt Prejean做的是什么工作
I need to know what kind of work DeWitt Prejean did.

1140
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:43,806
干黑鬼的活
Done nigger work.

1141
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,541
你知道，他剪草，清理油脂分离器
You know, he cut lawns, cleaned out grease traps,

1142
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,845
在人们的房子里抓该死的老鼠
got the dead rats out from under people's houses.

1143
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,748
你觉得他做了他妈的什么事？
What the fuck you think he did?

1144
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,151
别告诉我不是
Don't sound right to me.

1145
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:56,714
我想他还做了其他种类的工作
I think he did some other kind of work too.

1146
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,453
你让我单独待会儿
You leave me alone.

1147
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,791
你有漂亮的执法记录，Hebert先生
You're a pretty good judge of character, Mr. Hebert.

1148
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,888
我看其他人是不是该回避一下？
Do I look like somebody that's going to go away?

1149
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,425
Hm?

1150
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,165
回去走好
It was better back then.

1151
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,331
你知道是什么
You know it was.

1152
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,340
他做什么种类的工作，Ben?
What kind of work he do,Ben?

1153
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,138
驾驶卡车
Drove a truck.

1154
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:18,702
为谁？
Who for?

1155
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,908
全都为了Jeanerette
It was over in Jeanerette.

1156
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,422
我带她出来，因为她为我工作
I brung her out here 'cause she works for me,

1157
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,652
因为我不能自己上下车
'cause I can't get in and out of the car good by myself.

1158
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,358
他季节性的为一个白人工作
He worked seasonal for a white man,

1159
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:39,923
我们一些大糖厂
owned some big sugar mill.

1160
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,833
我不知道关于他的其他事
I don't know nothing about him

1161
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:45,431
除了他是一个阳具残废的人
except he was a brother of that crippled fellow.

1162
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:48,032
就知道这么多了
That's all I know and nothing more.

1163
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:52,706
你说我的所作所为，我是个该死的骗子
You saying I do,then you're a Goddamn liar.

1164
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,578
你不想说点其他的？
Something else you want to say?

1165
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,916
你有条鱼上钩了
You got a fish on your line.

1166
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,288
Batist.

1167
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,834
有多少糖厂在Jeanerette的周围？
How many sugar mills they got over there in Jeanerette?

1168
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:14,926
只有一个
Just one.

1169
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:24,901
Hey.

1170
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,880
进来
Come on in.

1171
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,383
停止说再见吧
Stopped by to say good-bye,

1172
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:32,420
你的一个离失的礼物
give you a going-away present.

1173
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:34,921
你在哪里做头，Cholo?
Where you headed,Cholo?

1174
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,150
尽管我也能去佛罗里达
Thought I might go to Florida,

1175
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:39,489
也许开个商店，想你的一样
maybe open a business like you got here.

1176
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,188
你重拾你全部的草坪设备后
What you doing with all that lawn furniture

1177
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,629
想做些什么？
in the back end of your pickup?

1178
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:49,329
有个在假日旅馆的家伙，希望我检查好了之后带去
Guy at the Holiday Inn wanted me to take it when I checked out.

1179
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:53,534
说我的行为令他产生好感，你知道吗？
Said I'd kind of be doing him a favor, you know?

1180
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,576
马上就签约了
Giving him a write-off.

1181
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,974
你和Baby Feet有些麻烦
You had some trouble with Baby Feet.

1182
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,084
对
Yeah.

1183
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,556
我告诉他，他比四人帮还坏
I told him he was a douche bag

1184
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,218
我不会再为他工作，就算他跪下求我
and I wouldn't work for him again even if he begged me.

1185
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,658
Cherry LeBlanc姑娘是对的
That Cherry LeBlanc girl was right

1186
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,195
当她叫他是绣花针鸡巴的时候
when she called him a needle-dick.

1187
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,093
当这个婊子养的插进我的嘴
That's when the son of a bitch comes across my mouth

1188
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:17,131
用那个大大的...
with this big...

1189
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,531
等等，等等，等等
Now, wait, wait, wait.

1190
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:21,125
你刚才说Cherry LeBlanc怎么了？
What's this about Cherry LeBlanc?

1191
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:28,608
他告诉你，他从不认识她
If he tells you he never knew her,

1192
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,440
问他这是什么
ask him about this.

1193
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,176
Julie忘记了去年，我们开车经过Biloxi
Julie forgot he told me to take some souvenir pictures

1194
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:40,221
他叫我照了一些照片留念
when we drove over to Biloxi last year.

1195
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:41,255
难道这不是她吗？
Is that her or not?

1196
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,123
Baby Feets杀了这个女孩？
Did Baby Feets kill this girl?

1197
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,858
我说，LIeutenant
Come on, Lieutenant.

1198
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:54,902
你知道他们怎么运作
You know how it works.

1199
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:57,336
像Julie这样的人不会做这些
A guy like Julie don't do hits.

1200
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:58,566
他吩咐其他人
He says something to somebody,

1201
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,403
然后他就“忘了”
then he forgets it.

1202
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,603
要是一个特别的岗位，也许其他人会另找个傻瓜
If it's a speclal kind of job,maybe somebody calls up a geek.

1203
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,112
Baby Feets是幕后主谋？
Did Baby Feets make that call?

1204
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:09,212
从这照片，Lieutenant
Start a photo album,Lieutenant.

1205
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:12,617
你自己想想吧
Make up your own mind.

1206
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,993
Murphy Doucet在这张照片里做什么？
What's Murphy Doucet doing in this picture?

1207
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,974
有什么麻烦，Dave?
What's wrong, Dave?

1208
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,373
一根点火线短路了
Got a loose ignition wire.

1209
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,071
能借你的刀子用一下吗？
You got a knife I could use?

1210
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:38,737
我也许要找找
Yeah, I ought to have something.

1211
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,621
这个应该行
This should do.

1212
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,817
一些在查尔斯湖的墨西哥人给的
Some Mexican pulled this on me in Lake Charles.

1213
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,254
我不知道，你在查尔斯湖是个警察
I didn't know you were a cop in Lake Charles.

1214
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:55,455
我不是
I wasn't.

1215
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:57,259
我在高速公路上的洲警察
I was working highway for the state police.

1216
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:58,822
去年，我从那儿退休
That's where I retlred from last year.

1217
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,959
你和Twinky LeMoynej一起进入这个公司？
Is that when you got into business with Twinky LeMoyne?

1218
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,004
不，我们分道扬镳
No, we go back a ways further.

1219
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,143
谢谢你的小刀
Thanks for the knife.

1220
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:16,943
什么情况？
What's the deal?

1221
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,986
上个星期，Lou Girard看到了她的文件
Lou Girard was looking at her file last week.

1222
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:21,022
Lou在她从事性交易的时候逮捕了她
Lou arrested her on a prostitution charge.

1223
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,488
不应该是一个官员
It wouldn't be one officer.

1224
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:24,320
一个洲警察在一个酒吧搜捕
It was a state police raid on a bar...

1225
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:26,019
州警察？谁发出的逮捕令？
State police?Who sent that arrest report?

1226
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,652
Oh, Sgt. Murphy Doucet.

1227
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:29,754
Murphy Doucet.

1228
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,205
我忽略了这个
I'd missed it.

1229
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,978
Lou Girard已经发现了Cherry LeBlance 的逮捕令
Lou Girard had dug up Cherry LeBlanc's arrest record,

1230
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,639
他为此命丧黄泉
and it had cost him his life.

1231
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:53,317
但是这是对于Murphy Doucet的最后线索
But this was going to be the end of the line for Murphy Doucet.

1232
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,968
我还没有充分证据，我告诫自己
I wasn't planting evidence,I kept telling myself.

1233
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,013
我要把他转移
I was just removing it

1234
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,241
在那些混蛋毁灭它之前
before a guilty man could destroy it.

1235
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,312
为什么你们他妈的都在这儿？
Why the hell are y'all here?

1236
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:02,879
我们在这儿因为你，Doucet先生
We're here because of you, Mr. Doucet.

1237
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,051
我们已经调查了所有的
We've been checking all the unsolved murders

1238
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:07,253
你在做州警察工作时
of females in areas surrounding highways

1239
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,456
高速公路区域的女性谋杀案
during the time you were working for the state police.

1240
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,260
Rosie,我想我们正好找到这把
Rosie, I think we just found the knife

1241
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,891
杀害Cherry LeBlanc的小刀
that he used on Cherry LeBlanc.

1242
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:15,300
那把刀不在那儿
That knife wasn't there.

1243
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:16,428
我说它在
I say it was,

1244
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:19,029
你的指纹全在上面
and I say your fingerprints are all over it.

1245
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:20,267
我看看
I see.

1246
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:24,403
你和这个墨西哥婊子在一起？
You and this Mexican bitch are in on it together, huh?

1247
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,504
不，Murphy
No, Murphy.

1248
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:29,379
我操你，就我自己
I'm fucking you all by myself.

1249
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,782
举起手来，现在
Get your hands up now.

1250
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,285
举起手来，缴枪不杀
Get your hands up,up against that...

1251
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:33,912
趴在墙上
up against that wall.

1252
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,916
你们对我下套，我甚至不知道为什么
Y'all are setting me up,and I don't even know why.

1253
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,621
谢谢这些
Think about it.

1254
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:41,662
强烈的谢谢
Think hard.

1255
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,528
谢谢回到1965年的所有路
Think all the way back to 1965,

1256
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:46,260
在飓风来临之前
just before that hurricane hlt.

1257
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,064
你们把Dewitt Prejean用铁链
Y'all made DeWitt Prejean run with that chain

1258
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:50,627
锁住，然后让他跑
locked around his chest,

1259
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:52,468
再开枪射他的腿
shot his leg out from underneath him.

1260
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:56,706
你没有留意，有个男孩在沼泽的另一边
You didn't notice the boy that was watching you

1261
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:58,302
看到了你，是吧？
from across the swamp,though, did you?

1262
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,530
我不知道你为什么要这样做，但你带着这把刀
I don't know how you did it,but you planted that knife.

1263
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,007
时间总是在坏人那一边，Rosie
Time is always on the bad guy's side, Rosie.

1264
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:31,068
我们在等授权的同时，他们也在找这个证据
We wait for warrants while they deep-six the evidence.

1265
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,642
我没听见你说什么
I didn't hear what you said.

1266
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:48,553
Jesus wienie, Dave.

1267
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,154
你们把这个地方搞得一塌糊涂
Y'all done tore this place to pieces.

1268
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:52,222
我们暂时在，会清理干净
You want to stay behind and clean it up?

1269
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,665
当这个家伙回家后
I don't want to be nowhere around here

1270
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:54,702
我不想东西到处都是
when that guy gets home.

1271
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:55,997
你听说他外出签合同吗？
You heard he's out on bond?

1272
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,038
转一下这个
Screw that.

1273
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:58,970
他还在这里一段时间
He'll be here any minute.

1274
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:07,605
我们什么也没发现
We got nothing.

1275
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,654
Alfie.

1276
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:18,591
你知道你的小姑娘在哪里吗？
You know where your little girl's at?

1277
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,491
她正在我膝盖上呢
She's right here on my knee.

1278
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,457
怎么不说话了
You sound speechless.

1279
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:28,502
放了她，Doucet
Turn her loose,Doucet.

1280
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,730
你不想这样做
You don't want to do this.

1281
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:32,034
我只是让我们俩的事情变得简单点
I'll make it simple for both of us.

1282
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,132
你从警察局物证仓库里把那把刀取出来
You take that knlfe out of the evldence locker,

1283
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,143
放在一个贷子里面
you put it in a Ziploc bag.

1284
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,610
明早8点钟
At 8:00 tomorrow morning,

1285
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,271
把这个袋子放到，新奥尔良的
you leave the bag In a trash can

1286
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:42,908
Anne街和Royal街交汇路口的垃圾桶里面
on the corner of Royal and St. Anne in New Orleans.

1287
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:44,246
你听我说，Doucet
You listen to me,Doucet.

1288
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:45,286
谢谢你所做的
Think about this.

1289
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:46,320
你是一个警察
You're a cop.

1290
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:47,548
你可以放过你
You can skate on this.

1291
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,317
我们会给你充分的时间，放弃这件事
We've been jacking you around the whole time.

1292
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,416
你这个婊子养的骗子
You lying son of a bitch.

1293
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:54,826
你永无休止的，尽一切办法来羞辱我
You won't rest till you fuck me up every way you can.

1294
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,160
今天你只讲对了一件事：
You said only one thing right today:

1295
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:58,665
我会放过你
I'm going to skate.

1296
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:01,293
你会来帮助我
And you're going to help me.

1297
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,039
死了这条心吧，Dave?
Finally lost your mind, Dave?

1298
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,874
年轻的女士，你需要暂时离开这个男人
Young lady, you need to stay away from this man.

1299
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:46,140
好吧，走吧
Okay, let's go.

1300
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:47,738
从这儿离开，来吧，我们走
Get out of here.Come on, let's go.

1301
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:49,977
今天电视里没什么好消息，Dave?
Nothing good on TV tonight, Dave?

1302
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,985
Murphy Doucet绑架了我的女儿
Murphy Doucet has my daughter.

1303
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,516
你听到我说的了吗？
Did you hear what I said?

1304
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:57,558
太糟糕了
That's too bad.

1305
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:58,990
我真是不愿听到这样的悲剧
I don't like to hear stuff like that.

1306
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,028
我很难过
It upsets me.

1307
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:06,464
也许你应该把她的寻人启事贴在牛奶包装上
Hey, maybe you can get her face on one of them milk cartons.

1308
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:18,870
我女儿在哪儿，Julie?
Where's my daughter, Julie?

1309
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,563
Alafair在什么地方？
Where's Alafair at?

1310
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:41,124
我解雇了Doucet
I cut Doucet loose.

1311
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:44,171
他做得任何事都和我无关
I got nothing to do with what he does.

1312
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,263
你赶快放了我
You get off my fucking back

1313
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,002
不然，我发誓，我要以牙还牙
or I swear to God,I'll square this.

1314
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:51,273
警察或其他，我要公诸于众
Cop or not,I'll put out on open contract.

1315
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:52,813
我要报复你他妈的整个家族
I'll cowboy your whole fucking family.

1316
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:58,677
你现在有最后的机会
Your window of opportunity's closing down.

1317
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:00,186
我女儿在哪里？
Where's my baby girl?

1318
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:01,984
我说的是实话
I'm telling you the truth.

1319
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:03,387
他做的这些，全都不关我的事
I got nothing to do with what he does.

1320
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:04,425
他是个小丑
He's a geek.

1321
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:06,858
我不会雇用小丑，我让他们混蛋了
I don't hire geeks.I run them off.

1322
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,532
上帝给的最后机会
Last by God chance.

1323
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,495
他在Vista河口扎了一个露天营地
He's got a camp out by Bayou Vista,

1324
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:22,566
接近Atchafalaya盆地
almost at Atchafalaya Basin.

1325
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:23,872
那地方没有路牌
The deed's not in his name.

1326
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:25,071
没人知道哪儿
Nobody knows about it.

1327
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:28,775
从咸水沼泽的泥路
It's at the end of the dirt road,

1328
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,839
一直走到尽头
by the salt marsh.

1329
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,446
Alafair在哪儿？
Alafair there?

1330
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,658
我祈求上帝她不在
I hope to God she's not.

1331
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,091
Alfie!

1332
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:18,642
过来
Come here.

1333
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:19,975
他伤害你了吗，宝贝？
Did he hurt you, baby?

1334
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:21,207
我告诉他，他是坏蛋
I told him he better not.

1335
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:24,615
我告诉他，你会来的
I told him what you do.

1336
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,813
我刚才打爆的那个人，手里的武器是卷着的杂志
I just shot a man armed with a rolled-up magazine.

1337
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:29,151
不，不
No, no.

1338
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,191
他拿了一支枪
He had a gun on him.

1339
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,022
只是你忘记了
You just don't remember it yet.

1340
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:37,294
你没事吧
You okay?

1341
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:23,543
我应该通知我的律师吗？
Should I call my lawyer?

1342
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:26,341
Mr. LeMoyne,

1343
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:30,316
我看见你和Murphy Doucet
I saw you and Murphy Doucet

1344
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:34,411
在Atchafalays杀害了DeWitt Prejean
kill DeWitt Prejean out on the Atchafalaya.

1345
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:37,786
我从沼泽的对面看见了一切
I watched it from across the swamp.

1346
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:41,756
你那个残废的兄弟没法去杀DeWitt
Your crippled brother couldn't kill DeWitt,

1347
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,228
所以你帮他干了这件事
so you did it for him.

1348
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:48,699
我被逮捕了？
Am I under arrest?

1349
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,169
我想Murphy Doucet这些年，一直阴魂不散
I think Murphy Doucet's been blackmailing you with it

1350
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:54,675
的缠着你
all these years.

1351
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:57,734
两个种族之间在哪个年代发生了许多
A lot of bad things happened back in that era

1352
01:31:57,812 --> 01:31:58,836
很坏的事情
between the races.

1353
01:31:58,913 --> 01:32:01,575
我们都是同样，曾经生活在
But we're not the same people

1354
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:03,617
哪个年代的人，不是吗？
we were then,are we?

1355
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:05,276
我想我们都是
I think we are.

1356
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:11,422
你看上去，不想让过去的事情过去
You seem unableto let the past rest.

1357
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,289
以我的体验
It's been my experience

1358
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:16,262
你只是选择性的让过去成为过去
that you let go of the past by addressing it.

1359
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,395
请，离开
Please, leave.

1360
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:21,332
当我离开后，也不会有其他的差别
It won't make any difference if I leave.

1361
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:23,529
你仍然会被这些记忆，没完没了缠着，没日没夜
You're going to drag this one around with you all day long

1362
01:32:23,604 --> 01:32:27,597
就像一条船缆
every day,like a log chain,

1363
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:29,108
充满你生命中剩下时间
for the rest of your life.

1364
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,912
你没有一点怜悯吗，先生?
Have you no mercy, sir?

1365
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:38,076
不，先生
No, sir.

1366
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,347
不，先生，我没有
No, sir, I don't.

1367
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:04,774
Julie Balboni最后完蛋了
Julie Balboni finally went down,

1368
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:06,813
没人帮他度过破产
but in a way nobody expected,

1369
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,372
被蒙牛集团收购
in a beef with the IRS.

1370
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:12,078
在堪萨斯洲的东莞市，城管队接收了Babby Feet

1371
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:14,519
的所以美女
at Leavenworth, Kansas,

1372
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:15,886
一个地方，在冬天

1373
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:17,322
让你相信
makes you believe

1374
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:20,849
刺骨的寒风从四面八方同时袭来

1375
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:28,800
Elrod Sykes不再酗酒

1377
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:32,902
扮演了一个小角色

1378
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:34,999
几个月后，当这部电影拍摄完成
Months later,when the picture was finished,

1379
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:36,338
他从加利福尼亚打电话给我们

1380
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:39,243
说Alafair是他的大救星

1381
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:49,882
我觉得在早晨，笼罩河湾的蒙蒙迷雾中
I thought in the morning mists that curled around the bayou

1382
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:53,017
我可能又看到了John Bell Hood将军的身影
I might again see General John Bell Hood,

1383
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:54,925
只是匆匆一晃而过，也许

1384
01:33:54,996 --> 01:33:57,021
脱下他的帽子

1385
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:59,566
他的微笑充满善意

和谐的关爱

1387
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:03,929
总是长久的留在他的脸上
that always seemed to linger in his face.

1388
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,541
随着日子的流逝
Then as the days passed

1389
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:12,738
我开始让这个夏天发生的，这些狂暴的事件悄悄的消散
and I began to let go of all the violent events of that summer,

1390
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:16,681
我开始接受了那个将军，就像Bootsie说的
I came to accept that the General, as Bootsie had said,

1391

仅仅是我意念里虚构的想象

1392
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,216
让我慢慢的走出遥远的过去
there to remind me out of the distant past

1393
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:25,725
那些争论永远不会结束（种族分歧）
that the contest is never quite over,

1394
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:28,557
正义永远不完全是我们的

Dave?
Dave?
