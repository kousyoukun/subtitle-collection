1
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,935
My name's Dave Robicheaux.

2
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,980
I'm an alcoholic.

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,899
Sometimes I'm tempted
to have a drink.

4
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,488
But I never do.

5
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,733
I hope this poor girl was dead

6
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,403
before he started
carving on her like that.

7
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,781
This poor girl didn't have
a whole lot of good luck, Dave.

8
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,089
In the ancient world,

9
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,675
people placed heavy stones
on the graves of their dead

10
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,512
so their souls would not wander
and afflict the living.

11
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,348
I always thought
this was simply the practice

12
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,143
of superstitious
and primitive people.

13
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,270
But I was about to learn
that the dead

14
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,105
can hover on the edge of our vision

15
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,567
with the density
and luminosity of mist.

16
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,737
And their claim on the earth
can be as legitimate

17
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,574
and tenacious as our own.

18
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,194
Could I see your
driver's license, please?

19
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,487
My what?

20
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,738
Driver's license.

21
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,949
Please take it out your billfold, 
hand it to me.

22
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,659
Oh, yeah, sure.

23
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,911
Well ...

24
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,371
I was
a little careless back there.

25
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,538
I'm sorry about that.

26
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,790
You're Elrod T. Sykes?

27
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,291
Yes, sir, that's who I am.

28
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,086
Step out the car, Mr. Sykes.

29
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,171
Yes, sir.
Anything you say, sir.

30
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,095
Mr. Sykes,
I think you've been drinking,

31
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,680
and I know you've been smoking
marijuana in your automobile.

32
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,266
I believe your lady friend there
just ate the roach.

33
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,726
Ooh, well, that wouldn't
be good now, would it?

34
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,187
You're under arrest for driving
while intoxicated, Mr. Sykes.

35
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,564
I'll take you just down the
street here to the city jail.

36
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,858
I'll send a car, take Ms.
Drummond wherever she's staying.

37
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,026
But your little red sports car

38
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,569
is going to be towed to the pound.

39
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,737
This is bad news.

40
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,989
This is not on my agenda,

41
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,407
'cause we're just
starting a movie.

42
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,866
I've always enjoyed
all your films.

43
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,034
Ms. Drummond's too.

44
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,869
Take your car keys
out the ignition please.

45
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,998
El, do something.

46
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,713
I feel real bad about this.

47
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,132
Can he make a contribution

48
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,385
to Mothers Against Drunk Driving
or something like that?

49
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,554
As an admirer of your work,
Ms. Drummond,

50
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,473
I recommend you don't make any
more mentions of contributions.

51
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,809
I recommend you stay put.

52
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,061
Deputy will be along here in
a few minutes to take you home.

53
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,188
Get along.

54
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,365
You're not going to get sick
in my truck, are you?

55
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,492
No, I'm just fine.

56
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:40,756
Mm.

57
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,599
Oh.

58
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,267
Huh.

59
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,603
Oh.

60
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,022
I know where there's a dead body.

61
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,440
What?

62
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,108
Ugh.

63
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:04,404
Looks like a big pile
of gristle and bone.

64
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,908
Where was this?

65
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,827
Way the hell out
in Atchafalaya swamp.

66
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:15,957
We had to pick up a scene near
the old Indian reservation.

67
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,125
I went to take a leak.

68
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,461
I saw it sticking out
of a sandbar.

69
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,629
Ugh.

70
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,091
Get back in the truck.

71
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,342
Ugh.

72
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,886
That swamp

73
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,096
full of old Indian bones.

74
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,807
Yeah, but ...

75
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,308
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

76
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,893
Dave Robicheaux.

77
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,645
Mr. Robicheaux,

78
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,647
now, if that was
an Indian I found,

79
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,981
I was wondering
what he was doing

80
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,359
with a chain wrapped around him.

81
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,906
Say that again.

82
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,325
It's a rusted chain with links

83
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,743
as big as my fist

84
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:55,414
crisscrossed around his rib cage.

85
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,133
Can you find that sandbar again?

86
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,553
Yes, sir, I believe I could.

87
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,434
I'm going to make
a confession to you,

88
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,643
Mr. Sykes.

89
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,353
DWIs are a pain in the butt.

90
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,938
If I take you home,
can I have your word

91
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,149
you'll be in my office,
9:00 in the morning?

92
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,192
And sober?

93
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,237
9:00, you got it.
Absolutely.

94
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:31,450
Hey, I really appreciate this.

95
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,384
Elrod Sykes and Kelly Drummond?

96
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,427
I want to go to the set.

97
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,470
Sykes is a drunk.

98
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,512
He's huge!

99
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,389
His head glows in the dark.

100
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,516
Maybe we could get
an autographed movie poster.

101
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,226
No way!

102
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,604
Not for you,
for the hurricane relief fund.

103
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,646
Okay, cool.

104
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,689
Please?

105
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,732
Will you hush?

106
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,233
I'll take her

107
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,818
and look out for her,

108
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,236
if that's all right with you.

109
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,739
Maybe we could get Kelly
Drummond to sign one too,

110
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,324
pay for somebody's roof.

111
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,783
Please?

112
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,464
It's over yonder.

113
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,424
Hold on there, Mr. Sykes.

114
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,134
Best put some of this on.

115
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,428
We used to have
a lot of bats down here,

116
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,973
but the mosquitoes ate 'em all.

117
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,933
That boy's a long way
from his Hollywood poontang,

118
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,976
ain't he?

119
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,310
This jackass is objectifying you,

120
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,646
Mr. Sykes, because
he's had very little exposure

121
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,689
to the outside world.

122
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,023
Don't let it bother you.

123
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,411
Hurricane Betsy blowing through
here in '65 probably buried him

124
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,662
and Katrina unearthed him.

125
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,997
Why '65?

126
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:46,710
Hurricanes tear up this part
of the country all the time.

127
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,961
See that left shin bone?

128
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,255
Clipped in half.

129
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,257
That's where they shot him
when he tried to run away.

130
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,383
You a psychic

131
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,676
or some bullshit like that?

132
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,845
No, I saw it happen
about a mile from here.

133
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,013
Are you saying

134
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,306
that some white people

135
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,599
lynched somebody around here?

136
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,434
When we get back, you're going
to have to talk to your sheriff,

137
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,269
get the coroner out here now.

138
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,855
I don't know about y'all
over in Iberia Parish,

139
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,691
but around here,
ain't nobody going to be

140
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,861
real interested in nigger trouble that's 40 years old.

141
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,988
What are you looking for,
Mr. Robicheaux?

142
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,114
I don't see any remnants

143
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,824
of a belt on his trousers ...

144
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,036
or any laces in his boots.

145
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,330
That boy probably did his
shopping at the Goodwill.

146
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,504
They never found him,

147
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,298
didn't even look for him.

148
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,593
Back then, with no body,
no missing persons report,

149
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,637
that sheriff didn't have
any reason to believe me,

150
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,973
must less get off his ass
and go to work.

151
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,560
You're not
17 years old anymore.

152
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,854
The trouble I have with you
is getting you away from work.

153
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,231
You've done everything
that you can.

154
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,400
You have no good reason
to beat yourself up.

155
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,195
Now drink your milk
and come to bed.

156
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,946
I'm horny.

157
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,826
Bootsie was right.

158
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,246
What was the point of reaching
into the distant past?

159
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,917
Just yesterday, a young girl
had been eviscerated.

160
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:13,213
We had her name now,
Cherry LeBlanc.

161
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,347
Mr. Trajan around?

162
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,474
He's over there, chere.

163
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,519
We've been over this already
three times now.

164
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,021
Cherry's been working here off
and on for the past few weeks.

165
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,400
She's going to show up anyway
to listen to Hogman Pitan.

166
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,901
The girl had a real thing
for Hogman.

167
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,070
Some time around 1:00,
she put her purse behind the bar

168
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,738
and says she's going to go
outside for a walk.

169
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,032
You know she'd been
arrested for prostitution?

170
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,283
I didn't know that.

171
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,452
All right.

172
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,912
Okay.

173
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,247
You hired her 'cause you thought

174
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,249
she was an honor student at LSU.

175
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,751
I can't say I care for the way
you're talking to me, Detective.

176
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,046
If I found out you've been
holding back information on me,

177
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:59,759
Mr. Trajan, I'ma come back here
with a warrant, Mr. Trajan,

178
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,386
for your arrest.

179
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,742
Did you know Cherry LeBlanc,

180
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,911
little white girl,
about 19 years old?

181
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,956
She work here, ain't she?

182
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you know if she had
a boyfriend, tante?

183
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,793
If that's what
you want to call it.

184
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,128
She in the business.

185
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,463
Was Mr. Trajan involved?

186
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,131
Ask him.

187
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,425
I don't think he was.

188
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,053
Otherwise you wouldn't be
telling me all these things.

189
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,221
She a sad girl.

190
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,850
I told her,
"A pretty white girl like you

191
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,602
could have anything you want."

192
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,482
When that girl dress up,
she look just like a movie star.

193
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,317
Who was her pimp?

194
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,403
I don't know nothing else, me.

195
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,989
She wasn't about to give the name

196
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,743
of some rich white man
to an old black woman.

197
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,454
What rich white man?

198
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,001
Some rich white man maybe ...

199
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,713
get her out of the business
of selling jelly roll.

200
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,675
She say that just before
somebody done them

201
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,637
awful things to that young girl.

202
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,111
The sheriff over in St. Clair Parish

203
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,447
said, "Thanks a lot,"
for that pile of bones you found

204
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,741
out in the Atchafalaya yesterday.

205
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,451
They really appreciate
the extra work.

206
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,744
He need to find
a new line of work,

207
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,579
he don't like them bones.

208
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,873
Now, he said you're welcome
to come over on your days off

209
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,084
and run an investigation.

210
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,338
Their coroner's got them bones
now waiting on you.

211
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,799
Autopsy report came in
on that LeBlanc girl.

212
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,307
Looks like we're talking
about a psychopath,

213
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,060
somebody wired to the eyes
on crack or meth.

214
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,728
Maybe.

215
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,729
I think she knew him.

216
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,648
So you don't think
it was a john?

217
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,317
No, she left her purse
behind the bar

218
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,195
with all her condoms in it.

219
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,657
Cherry LeBlanc was
a working girl with ambition.

220
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,493
Maybe she misjudged
a business opportunity here.

221
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,496
Who's a girl like that
going to be in business with?

222
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,083
Um ... Baby Feet?

223
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,169
Maybe Baby Feet.

224
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,768
What's happening, Cholo?

225
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,895
I thought you was in the pen.

226
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,062
No, man.

227
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,480
Katrina, she rinsed my hands clean.

228
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,066
The whole damn crime lab

229
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,276
washed off down the river.

230
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,445
Ain't got nothing on me
in New Orleans.

231
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,738
Doing fine, bro.

232
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,573
Besides that, they ain't
even got enough money

233
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,949
to lobotomize
guys like me no more.

234
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,243
What's going on, Dave?

235
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,622
I'm investigating a murder,
Julie.

236
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,748
No kidding.

237
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,542
Y'all worried about me, Dave?

238
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,877
Hell yes.

239
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,420
How many guys
would burn down their own

240
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,590
father's nightclub with their
own father still in it?

241
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,304
You got to forgive me
if I get a little upset

242
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,224
by these kinds of attitudes, Dave.

243
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,643
I come home to this shithole.

244
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,271
I'm a prominent man
in the entertainment business.

245
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:44,108
I talk on the phone every day
to people in California

246
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,694
you read about
in Entertainment Weekly.

247
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,030
They ought to have
"Welcome Back Balboni Day."

248
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,156
Instead,

249
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,575
I get treated
like sewer gas by you.

250
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,203
You understand
what I'm saying, Dave.

251
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,913
It hurts me.

252
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,248
Sit down while I take a whiz.

253
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,376
Cholo, where's your hospitality?

254
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,586
Get the man a soft drink.

255
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,305
Here, Lieutenant.

256
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,723
Julie was telling me
about that time

257
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,433
that nigger
almost popped you with a .38

258
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,143
in the French Quarter.

259
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,229
Said he saved your life.

260
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,275
Weren't you and Julie baseball 
buddies in high school?

261
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,653
Take the hint, Cholo.

262
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,989
This guy's
not a conversationalist.

263
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,370
You working on that
Cherry LeBlanc deal?

264
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,247
What you know about that?

265
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,874
All over today's paper, man.

266
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,335
Julie and me
were just talking about it.

267
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,463
Sounds like you got
one sick fuck on the loose.

268
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,556
My meter's running, Julie.

269
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,682
I want to talk about

270
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,267
that murdered girl
we found south of town.

271
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,518
Which girl is that?

272
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,478
Cherry LeBlanc.

273
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,064
I guess I ain't heard about it.

274
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,274
You don't read the newspaper?

275
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,358
I've been busy.

276
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,653
Mm-hmm, I can see that.

277
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,488
We used to be friends,
Dave.

278
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,323
I even maybe did you a favor once.

279
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,617
So I'm going to line it out
for you and any locals

280
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,536
that want to get
the wax out their ears.

281
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,538
Louisiana's flat-ass broke.

282
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,290
New Orleans is a mortuary.

283
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,000
And the bottom
of a toilet's got more appeal

284
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,918
than this shithole in the bayou.

285
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,211
So they better wake up to the fact

286
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,380
that we are dropping
close to $40 million

287
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,631
in Iberia Parish.

288
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,758
They don't like the name

289
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,342
Balboni around here?

290
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,761
We'll move the whole
fucking movie

291
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,262
over to Mississippi.

292
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,765
See how that floats
with those coon-ass jack-offs

293
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,807
on the Chamber of Commerce.

294
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,517
You're in
the movie business now?

295
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:45,688
Yeah, I'm producing White Doves
with Michael Goldman.

296
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,232
What you think about that?

297
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,109
I'm sure everybody
wishes you success, Julie.

298
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,862
I'ma do a baseball movie next.

299
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,530
You want a part in it?

300
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,135
You can go on in.

301
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,096
You remember me, Dave?

302
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,807
It's Doucet, isn't it?

303
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,558
Yes, sir,
Murphy Doucet.

304
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,477
You got a good memory.

305
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,562
I was with the Jefferson Parish
Sheriff's Department

306
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,022
when you were with NOPD.

307
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,649
I guess you're
in the movie business now,

308
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,150
along with everybody else.

309
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,945
Yeah, I own half
of a security service now,

310
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,989
and I'm still with the Teamsters
out of Lafayette.

311
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,700
So I'm kind of doing
double duty here.

312
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,993
Is there some kind of trouble?

313
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,704
Where can I find Mr. Goldman?

314
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,748
Right on the other side
of them trees.

315
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,041
I'll let him know you're coming.

316
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,168
It's all right. I'll find him.

317
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,506
We had two divisions of soldiers
march through that?

318
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,300
Looks like we're shooting
a bread commercial.

319
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,011
Where'd we get this cannon,
Toys "R" Us?

320
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,764
All right, I'm going to need
floaters in there,

321
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,267
one face down,
two belly-up.

322
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,393
Use some of the fat extras.

323
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,145
They'll look bloated.

324
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,187
My dead horse?

325
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,188
No.

326
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,816
Not on the call sheet?
Terrific.

327
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,484
We need some blood,
blood-soaked ground,

328
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,069
if that's what it says
in the script.

329
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,320
This is not the nightly news.

330
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,364
They never show the blood.

331
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,366
This is an allegory.

332
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,535
We're not shooting
the fall of Vicksburg.

333
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,495
This is Baghdad 2007.

334
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,205
Copy that.

335
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,208
If people don't
connect the dots, fuck 'em.

336
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,544
There's a Detective Robicheaux
here to see you, sir.

337
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,881
So you're
investigating a crime.

338
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,799
Seen any crime around here?

339
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,593
Only crime I'm aware of

340
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,595
is the air conditioning
in my trailer.

341
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,014
You could fry an egg
on the toilet seat in there.

342
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,558
Then I've got a lead actor
digging up skeletons

343
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,644
in sandbars, exactly what
I need to be thinking about

344
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,896
while I'm shooting a picture.

345
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,317
Mr. Goldman, is Mr. Julius
Balboni producing this film?

346
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,402
Producing?

347
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,905
I must've really fucked up
in my previous incarnation.

348
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,866
Maybe I sunk the Titanic

349
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,328
or assassinated
Archduke Ferdinand.

350
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,996
I am the only producer.

351
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,123
So Mr. Balboni's lying.

352
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,751
Mr. Balboni is investing
some of his money

353
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,628
in a motion picture.

354
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,546
Is that illegal?

355
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,340
Congratulations.

356
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,343
You in business with the man
that hung Fulvio Raneri's cousin

357
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,095
up by his colon on a meat hook.

358
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,514
Do you recognize this girl,

359
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,225
Cherry LeBlanc?

360
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,766
How you are, Hogman?

361
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,270
Come on up on the porch.

362
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,604
Grab a chair.

363
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,985
You knew that LeBlanc girl,
didn't you?

364
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,528
I don't like to have nothing to do

365
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,572
with white folks' business,

366
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,994
but it bothers me
what somebody do to that girl.

367
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,997
I spoke to her about two hours
before she left the juke.

368
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,164
She said, "Hogman,

369
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,500
in the next life, me and you
going to get married."

370
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,002
That's what she said.

371
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,881
I said, "Darling, don't let the
men misuse you for no chicken."

372
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,175
She said, "I'm going
to have myself a town house

373
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,635
on Lake Pontchartrain."

374
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,512
Was she mixed up with somebody
from New Orleans?

375
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,266
Probably some white-trash pimp
told her she special,

376
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,392
she pretty.

377
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,021
Instead, she got herself killed.

378
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,359
You're mixed up with
that skeleton they found

379
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,694
in the Atchafalaya, ain't you?

380
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,529
How do you know about that?

381
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,990
When somebody find
a dead black man,

382
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,618
black people knows about it.

383
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,330
I'm listening.

384
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,290
A blue jay don't sit

385
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,666
on a mockingbird's nest.

386
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:19,211
The mockingbird will whoop
the blue jay's ass every time.

387
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,048
What are we talking about here,
Sam?

388
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,674
I'm talking about a black man.

389
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,926
And he was carrying on
with a white woman

390
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,136
who husband he worked for.

391
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,097
I think them was his bones
you dug in that sandbar.

392
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,557
What was his name?

393
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,059
Who care what's his name?

394
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,227
I think he got
what he asked for.

395
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,771
I say, "Past is past,

396
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,522
and don't be messing with it."

397
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,982
You warning me?

398
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,405
What was that white woman's name?

399
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,285
I got to go start my beans now.

400
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,125
Alafair,

401
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,420
you got to keep this raccoon
out of my fried pie.

402
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,006
Next time he come in here,
I'ma swat him with my broom.

403
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,801
Tripod's just an animal.

404
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,178
Why don't you try kicking the
smell of cigars out of the yard?

405
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,890
Alafair, you shouldn't
talk to Batist like that.

406
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,601
But he threatened Tripod
with menacing violence.

407
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,229
Tripod's a raccoon, baby.

408
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,855
Apologize to Batist.

409
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,399
Sorry for what I said.

410
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,484
And I'm saying it
'cause Dave made me.

411
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,616
That's a beautiful child,
Dave.

412
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,952
By the time she's 18 years old,

413
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,621
your hair's going to be solid white,

414
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,915
if there's any of it left.

415
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,092
Oh, wow.

416
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,680
Uh.

417
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,643
This is great!

418
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,686
I love it.

419
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,564
You run a bait shop too.

420
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,065
How you doing, Mr. Robicheaux?

421
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,359
We want to have dinner
with y'all tonight.

422
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,819
Oh, thanks, but my wife's
already cooking supper.

423
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,112
I was just on my way
over there to take a shower.

424
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,447
Well, hurry up.

425
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,324
We got reservations
at Clementine's, everybody.

426
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,952
The family has plans
for this evening, Mr. Sykes.

427
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,164
This is embarrassing, El.

428
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,125
I have a reservation.

429
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,668
Hey, I don't want
to cause any problems.

430
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,753
We'll just pick up
our liquids at your store here

431
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,131
and hit the road, okay?

432
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:31,677
Mr. Sykes ...

433
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,887
you've been driving drunk,

434
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,930
and you come to a cop's house
to buy more booze.

435
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,270
Why don't you hand
those keys to Ms. Drummond

436
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,313
before you hit the road?

437
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,066
Where's that beer at?

438
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,654
Hey.

439
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,991
You're a good man.

440
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,453
Y'all need to be real careful.

441
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,958
Elrod's a shitbird, but I love him.

442
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,837
It's all right.

443
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,089
Bad timing. Put it there.

444
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,549
Cool. Next time.

445
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,218
Hey.

446
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,260
All right.

447
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,263
Um, shit. We'll settle up.

448
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,058
We'll settle up later, yeah?

449
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,685
All right.

450
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,728
Other side.

451
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,729
Ah.

452
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,732
Come here.

453
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,360
Come on.
Come here.

454
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,904
Elrod.

455
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,822
What? Check this out.

456
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,865
Will you stop?

457
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,618
El!

458
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,582
Check me out.

459
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,169
S'more?
Made 'em myself.

460
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,339
Oh, thank you.

461
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,882
Elrod Sykes
is wearing Dave's jersey.

462
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,050
Can you believe it?

463
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,093
Mm-hmm.

464
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,886
Now go do your homework.

465
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,013
Something to drink?

466
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,390
How about a beer?

467
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,309
I think we're out.

468
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,228
I'm sure there's
one in there somewhere.

469
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,606
I'm going to go feed
Alafair's rabbits.

470
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,149
You care to join me?

471
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,402
Yeah, yeah, sure.

472
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:26,959
Get back there, Leroy.

473
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,085
Go on.

474
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,635
You ever seen lights
in the cypress trees at night?

475
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,137
That's swamp gas.

476
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,639
It'll ignite and roll out across
the waters like ball lightning.

477
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,099
No, sir, that's not what it is.

478
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,727
See these guys out yonder
by the lake.

479
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,731
They have lanterns hanging
from some of their ambulances.

480
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,984
A lot of those soldiers
had maggots in their wounds.

481
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,402
That's the only reason
they lived.

482
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,654
It's 'cause the maggots
ate out the infection.

483
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,114
You've been drunk
a long time, Elrod.

484
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,365
Pretty soon, all the trees
and alligators

485
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,618
will be talking to you.

486
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,787
A wild orchid
sang a song to me one time.

487
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,080
She had the prettiest voice.

488
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,415
Yeah, I wasn't drunk.

489
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,167
Mm-hmm.

490
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,585
This guy, a general,

491
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,337
he's standing on a crutch
right by the water.

492
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,339
And he said to me,

493
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,342
"You and your friend
the law man must repel them."

494
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,968
I think you're delusional.

495
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,887
You might want to think about
going to an AA meeting

496
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,348
with me one time.

497
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,476
Maybe I was a little drunk.

498
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,354
What happened
to this dude's nose?

499
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,814
Coon bit him.

500
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,107
Aw.

501
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,451
Lou Girard

502
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,703
always called at night.

503
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,580
I had picked him out of gutters

504
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,874
from New Orleans to Lake Charles,

505
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,959
held him when he had the shakes,

506
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:55,714
driven him to AA meetings more
times than I could remember.

507
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,966
And he had done the same for me.

508
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,218
Thanks for the call, Lou.

509
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,053
Yeah, when I saw
that electrical tape

510
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,722
around her hands and her feet,
or what's left of them,

511
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,225
I thought about you and that
LeBlanc case you got going.

512
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,686
Where she at now?

513
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,064
She's right there,
still in that barrel.

514
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,109
She got about
15 big blue crabs on her.

515
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:22,074
Coroner says, we move her,
she's coming out in pieces.

516
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,785
We're going to have a rough time
getting an ID, maybe.

517
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,912
Maybe by her teeth.

518
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,664
That's the poor bastard
who found her.

519
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,834
When did you
first notice that barrel?

520
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,212
About four or three weeks back.

521
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,463
See anyone else out there

522
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,923
on that levee?

523
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,176
Yeah, about a month ago
in the evening,

524
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,846
I seen a dark-colored car.

525
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,765
I remember thinking,
it was brand-new, you know?

526
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,600
Why would anybody
want to bring their new car

527
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,186
down on that dirt road
full of holes?

528
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,439
You remember
what kind of car it was?

529
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,940
No, sir. I'm sorry.

530
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,608
I just wish I hadn't been

531
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,194
the one to find that poor woman.

532
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,447
And, hey, I'm never
going to look inside

533
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,573
another barrel again.

534
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,615
Not me, no.

535
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,951
That'll do. Thank you.

536
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,578
Officer Guidry
going to take you home.

537
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,538
Thank you.

538
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,774
I need a tow truck

539
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,941
to haul off a limousine.

540
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:38,984
Where about?

541
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,027
Can't miss it.

542
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,320
Right in front of Chez Narcisse.

543
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,488
- When?
- Right now.

544
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,864
- Copy that.
- Thank you, chere.

545
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,405
You could get

546
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,532
the Roman Army down here.

547
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,950
One division of these guys

548
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,827
could've knocked off
these squirrel hunters,

549
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,495
had the Civil War over
in one year.

550
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,621
You know what?

551
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,873
Maybe we'll do a Bible movie next.

552
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,667
Yeah, but how do you fight
a war with sandals?

553
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,545
That's ... stupid.

554
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,005
How did they win wars
with sandals, hm?

555
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,526
What's going on, Dave?

556
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,111
Had a long night last night.

557
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:08,866
Found a girl in a barrel down
in south St. Martin Parish.

558
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,325
She covered up in blue crabs.

559
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,660
You ought to run her again.

560
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,703
We'll have gumbo.

561
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,373
You here for breakfast?

562
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,842
Sit down.

563
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,016
You're pissed off
about some little thing,

564
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,225
so you have my car towed.

565
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,227
You need to quit parking
in front of fireplugs.

566
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,813
Fireplugs; I'm getting this kind
of shit because of fireplugs?

567
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,148
No, Julie.

568
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,233
I want to know what you have
to do with a teenage hooker

569
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,277
named Cherry LeBlanc.

570
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,945
Who the fuck is Cherry LeBlanc?

571
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,030
You know who she is.

572
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,448
You and Cholo
were talking about her

573
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,701
before I got to the Holiday Inn,
and you lied to me about it.

574
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,994
Calling me a liar?

575
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,954
You're a motherfucking lying
piece of dog shit.

576
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,956
I think this sweet little town's

577
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,458
starting to rub off
on you, David.

578
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,251
Gentlemen, could you please ...

579
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,794
I mean,
just not use that language --

580
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,379
Get the fuck
away from my table!

581
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,422
It's all right, Mr. Meaux.

582
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,798
I'll be gone in a second.

583
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,010
Oh, sad to hear that.

584
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,971
I don't know none of these girls.

585
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:17,851
I don't have nothing to do
with your business.

586
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,228
You said some
ugly things about me, Dave,

587
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,648
and I'm going to let it slide.

588
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,107
I'll call a couple of cabs,

589
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,859
I'll pay the fine on my car,

590
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,071
I'll buy some new tires,

591
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,490
and I'll forget everything
you've been saying to me,

592
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,784
because I got a business to run.

593
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,829
Everybody's been pretty polite here.

594
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,123
Keep it simple, stupid.

595
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,043
It's time for you to let
people alone, Mr. Robicheaux.

596
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,753
Uh!

597
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,550
Ease off, Lieutenant.

598
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,760
This ain't good for nobody.

599
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,803
Uh!

600
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,596
Come on. Come on.

601
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,522
You're losing it, Dave.

602
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,899
You need to get yourself
some better tranqs.

603
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,547
No, sir, I wouldn't exactly

604
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,215
call it a dead end.

605
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,925
You have a seat,
I'll be right with you.

606
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,220
Thank you.

607
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,597
It's $100-million contract.

608
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,725
He must've pocketed
$60 million, $70 million.

609
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:44,354
False load slips, bogus waybills.

610
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,732
Balboni Trucking hauled
just about enough debris

611
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,733
to fill a Dixie cup.

612
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,234
Yes, sir, we are trying.

613
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,653
Thank you.

614
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,821
Can I help you with something?

615
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,864
I hope so.

616
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,407
This is my office.

617
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,825
Oh, my God, I'm  s --

618
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,744
I'm sorry. I was --

619
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,537
a call came in for me
on your extension,

620
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,788
and I just --

621
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,291
anyway,
I'm Special Agent Rosa Gomez.

622
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,460
Everyone calls me Rosie,
so call me Rosie.

623
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,046
It's nice to meet you,
Special Agent Rosie.

624
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,927
"Your detective's
investigative missteps

625
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,930
are going to hurt you
in November."

626
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,140
That's courtesy of that prick

627
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,392
Bubba Broussard
over at the city council.

628
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,061
So you called the FBI?

629
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,146
The FBI's been trying
to nail Balboni

630
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,732
for over a year now
on a FEMA scam.

631
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,693
And they still have
precisely nothing on him.

632
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,237
That's why I think
they're hoping there's more

633
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,073
to that Cherry LeBlanc case.

634
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,701
Now, Balboni
is throwing a birthday bash

635
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:43,997
for Mr. Michael Goldman
this evening.

636
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,333
I think you, too, should attend.

637
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,588
There are 17 unsolved
homicides in Louisiana

638
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,381
that share some
similarities with this case.

639
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,635
And ten of them share
multiple common denominators.

640
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,136
All show marks from being bound,

641
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,472
all young, all working class.

642
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,515
One was a high school girl.

643
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,350
Two were waitresses.
Three had been runaways.

644
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,018
And four were prostitutes.

645
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,648
The FBI has
an informational advantage

646
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,318
over Iberia Parish.

647
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,153
How do you like
that catfish court bouillon?

648
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,696
Uh, it's interesting.

649
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,286
If you found the remains
of a black man

650
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,831
and he had no belt,
no laces in his boot,

651
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,500
what speculation
would you make about him?

652
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,753
Obviously he'd been in jail,
a parish, or city holding tank,

653
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,964
some place where they were
afraid he'd do harm to himself.

654
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,465
That's what I think.

655
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,981
Mud bugs, as advertised.

656
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,649
This one has your name on it.

657
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,076
Get out of here.

658
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,383
Hey, Dave, you ought
to get yourself some food.

659
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,426
It's free.

660
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:23,805
Thanks. I've already eaten.

661
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,724
See that man
bird-dogging the blonde?

662
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,392
Twinky Hebert LeMoyne.

663
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,603
That's the other half
of my security service business.

664
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,563
What's he doing here?

665
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,981
He's an investor in the movie

666
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,482
and trying to get laid.

667
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,902
That's funny.

668
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,863
You like doing business
with Twinky LeMoyne?

669
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,406
It's good for me.

670
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,741
For him,
it's no big deal, really.

671
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,493
I mean, if there's a business
around here making money,

672
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,078
you can be sure
he's got a piece of it.

00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,053
Yeah.

I'm General John Bell Hood,
commander of the Texas brigade,

680
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,223
commander of the
4th Texas Cavalry,

681

the 5th Texas Cavalry,

and the 17th Texas Infantry.

683
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,816
Do you object
to shaking hands?

684
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,484
Am I dead?

685
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,445
You don't look like it to me.

686
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,405
You were at Gettysburg.
The war's over.

687
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,656
It's never over.

688
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,159
I would think you'd know that.

689
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,287
You were a lieutenant in the
United States Army, weren't you?

690
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:01,416
My head hurts. My head ...

691
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,834
sure does hurt.

692
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,254
Venal and evil people
are destroying the world

693
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,631
you were born in.

694
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,717
It's us against them,
my good friend.

695
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:15,680
Don't compromise your principles
or abandon your cause.

696
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,183
Do you know what's waiting
for me on down the road?

697
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,353
For one reason or another,

698
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,732
I find I have more insight
into the past than the future.

699
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,359
Try to keep this in mind:

700
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,278
It's just like when
they load their cannon

701
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,698
with horseshoes and log chain.

702
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,326
You'd think the barrage
would last forever.

703
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,537
Then all of a sudden,
there's a silence

704
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,414
louder than the cannon fire.

705
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,916
Please don't be alarmed

706
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,002
by the severity of my comparison.

707
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,923
Have a good night, Lieutenant.

708
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,321
Paramedics who brought you in

709
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,199
said you were talking
about Confederate soldiers

710
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,242
out in the swamp.

711
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,327
It was an usual night.

712
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,662
What's the possibility

713
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,121
that one of those
Hollywood characters

714
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,373
laced your Dr. Pepper?

715
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,749
Do what?

716
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,711
The tox screen came back
positive for LSD.

717
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:33,341
I - I need to talk
to the sheriff.

718
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,801
The sherifff was here this morning.

719
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,803
You talked to him for half an hour.

720
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,097
What'd I say?

721
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,474
Nothing that made
any sense to me.

722
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,897
When you reel him in

723
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,190
through the water,

724
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:54,279
his little legs and tail
wiggle like he was swimming.

725
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,239
Makes the black bass hungry.

726
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,665
How would you define
the idea of understanding?

727
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:16,259
Well, it's knowing something
and knowing what it means.

728
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,803
I think there's two ways

729
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,223
of looking at the idea
of understanding.

730
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,643
One is, if you don't look,
you never will see.

731
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,645
And the other is,
if you look a little less,

732
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,689
you might see
a hell of a lot more.

733
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,444
You might not be over those drugs

734
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,613
they put in your drink.

735
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,824
I know General John Bell Hood
of the Texas Calvary

736
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,826
just like he was
my own grandfather.

737
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,972
Are you accusing me
of working with the mafia?

738
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,891
When you do business with a man
like Julie Balboni,

739
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,185
you create a certain amount
of curiosity about yourself.

740
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,145
I don't do business with him.

741
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,022
I don't do anything with him.

742
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,816
I'm a member
of a group of investors

743
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:17,111
that have put money
into a movie production

744
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,072
in New Iberia.

745
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,742
Investing in the local economy,
that's all.

746
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,869
Are your employees
union people?

747
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,747
No, they certainly are not.

748
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,791
You own half of a security
service with Murphy Doucet,

749
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,833
don't you?

750
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,543
That's right, I certainly do.

751
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,253
And your partner
in your security service

752
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,089
is a Teamster steward
over in Lafayette.

753
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,800
I think you're involved in
some strange contradictions,

754
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,967
Mr. LeMoyne.

755
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,887
You'll have to excuse me,
Detective.

756
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,348
I've got to lock up now.

757
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,642
I have a lot of people
I take care of, you know?

758
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,228
Would you like
to have Julie Balboni

759
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,979
for a next door neighbor?

760
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,107
Would you like to have
your granddaughter

761
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,566
working for him?

762
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,901
Mr. Robicheaux,

763
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:01,322
I can't express to you
how offensive you are.

764
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,573
Did you get
that blond-haired girl

765
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,033
to lick your leg the other night?

766
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:07,995
There's my business card.

767
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,580
Thank you for your time.

768
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,007
Here you go, Dave.

769
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,844
Still 1965,
July, September, November.

770
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:23,886
Thank you, chere.

771
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,388
You're welcome.

772
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,431
How's Alafair?

773
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,807
Bien bonne.

774
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,392
Great.

775
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,932
A nigger, you say?

776
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,143
DeWitt Prejean.

777
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,479
Black man name of DeWitt Prejean.

778
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,150
Yeah, I remember
that son of a bitch.

779
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,862
What about him?

780
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:26,657
Were you on duty the night
somebody broke him out of jail?

781
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,868
I - I was the jailer.

782
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,453
Jailers don't work nights.

783
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,413
They hire a man for that.

784
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,709
Do you remember what
Mr. Prejean was charged with?

785
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,628
He wasn't charged with nothing.

786
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,004
Never got to that.

787
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,672
They busted him out of the tank.

788
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,132
Not according to the newspaper.

789
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,762
Lot of people wipe
their asses with newspaper.

790
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,139
Newspaper said he broke
into a white woman's house

791
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,182
with a butcher knife.

792
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,976
Was DeWitt Prejean a rapist?

793
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,481
He couldn't keep
his prick in his pants,

794
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,776
if that's what you mean.

795
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,529
Is it all right if I sit down
here, Mr. Hebert?

796
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,655
Sure.

797
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,832
You think her husband
broke him out of jail?

798
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,545
He might have if he could've.

799
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,338
He was a crippled man.

800
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,048
Got shot up in a war.

801
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,508
Where's he at now?

802
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,805
He's in the cemetery
out by the tracks,

803
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,056
east of town.

804
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:36,060
What about the woman?

805
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,021
She moved away, up north somewhere.

806
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,987
What's your interest in this
40-year-old nigger trouble?

807
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,697
I think I saw him killed.

808
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:52,577
Where's the man who was on duty
the night of the jailbreak?

809
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:57,915
He got drunk and got his self
run over by a train.

810
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,294
Wait a minute.

811
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,087
What'd you say?

812
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,297
You saw what?

813
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,552
What you think I saw,
Mr. Hebert?

814
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,267
Hello?

815
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,144
You're a hard man to catch.

816
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,186
Who's this?

817
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,813
Sugar, it's Amber.

818
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,106
Don't you remember me?

819
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,566
Don't hurt my feelings.

820
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,276
No, I'm sorry.
I don't remember who you are.

821
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,819
What can I do for you?

822
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,780
It's me that's going to do you
a big favor, darIing.

823
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,991
I'm going to give you
the guy you want.

824
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,618
What guy we talking about?

825
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,788
The nasty old pimp that's been
leaving dead girls around.

826
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,250
Meet me at Club Leon
in an hour.

827
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,960
Thanks for coming out, Lou.

828
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,879
Yeah, who you supposed
to be meeting up with here?

829
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,005
Said her name was Amber.

830
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,342
There's a hooker,
calls herself Amber.

831
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,843
What are we doing tonight?

832
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,471
I'm going to drive around front
and have a look inside.

833
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,139
I'd like you to be out here
to cover my back.

834
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,100
I don't want to walk
into no setup.

835
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,378
What are you having?

836
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,379
Has Amber been in?

837
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,547
Amber Martinez?

838
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,215
Short, skinny,
little Puerto Rican girl,

839
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,675
maybe weigh 100 pounds
sopping wet?

840
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:13,884
- Yeah.
- No, she ain't been in.

841
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:14,969
What you drinking?

842
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,764
- Dr. Pepper.
- Dr. Pepper, yes, sir.

843
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,351
I could call somebody,
might know where she's at.

844
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,853
Why don't you do that?

845
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,188
Yes, sir.
Right away.

846
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,987
Hey, Mama 'Ti, Amber there?

847
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,383
No word from Amber?

848
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,261
No, man, not a word.

849
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:01,098
♪ I'm a hog for you, babe ♪

850
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:07,063
♪ And I'm running round
your door ♪

851
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,564
♪ I'm a hog for you, woman ♪

852
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,956
Get back in there!

853
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:31,420
Dave, what the fuck's going on?

854
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,963
Shooter fired at me twice.

855
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,256
I put eight rounds in that Buick.

856
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,008
I think he's still in there.

857
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,519
Looks like she took one

858
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,686
right in the face.

859
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,106
What you mean, "she"?

860
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,524
You just popped

861
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,817
Amber Martinez.

862
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,195
There's no fucking gun.

863
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,462
There's no gun, man.

864
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:22,012
I got this throw-down.

865
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,264
Tell me to do it.

866
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:44,285
I opened up
on that Buick too soon.

867
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,744
You thought your life

868
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:49,331
was at risk, Lieutenant.

869
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,041
I hope you don't mind
my being here.

870
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,543
No.

871
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,548
You shouldn't have remorse.

872
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:01,302
A desire to live doesn't mean
you lack humanity.

873
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,888
Somebody's trying
to drive me crazy.

874
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,432
Can't believe what I see
or hear anymore.

875
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:13,397
They say I killed
an unarmed woman.

876
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,275
I think that would
probably bother me too.

877
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:20,654
I keep seeing that woman,
the back of her head,

878
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,698
her hair glued down
to the carpet

879
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,575
with her own blood.

880
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,410
Think about what you just said.

881
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,413
You're an intelligent man.

882
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,332
What does your eye tell you?

883
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,503
I need help.

884
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,257
The wind's out of the south.

885
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,594
There'll be thunder
by afternoon.

886
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,554
It'll sound
like Yankee cannon fire,

887
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,390
but it'll only be thunder.

888
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,603
General ...

889
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,733
What time is it?

890
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,828
Why would Amber Martinez
be sitting in the passenger seat

891
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,665
of her own car?

892
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,124
What did
the homicide investigator

893
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,167
have to say last night?

894
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,962
He told me I'm a hell of a shot.

895
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,297
Everybody thinks
I killed an unarmed woman.

896
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,882
There's not
any bullet holes anywhere.

897
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,300
There's no casings.

898
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,262
And there's no gun.

899
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,180
It was a setup, Dave.

900
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,609
What y'all doing out here?

901
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,236
Can't be messing around
a crime scene.

902
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,406
I'm really just
an observer here, Doobie.

903
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,490
Who's she?

904
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,658
Special Agent Gomez.

905
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,618
This is part
of an FBI investigation.

906
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:50,828
Do you have
a problem with that?

907
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,623
Why piss people off,
Robicheaux?

908
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,792
St. Martin Parish ain't going
to indict you over this,

909
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,670
but if I were you,
I wouldn't hang around here.

910
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:00,796
You might piss me off.

911
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,806
Well, from the size of the wound

912
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,349
and the impact of the round,

913
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,768
I'd say a .45 killed her.

914
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:15,978
Look at her head.

915
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,023
I only use hollow-point
ammunition, Sollie.

916
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,569
It ain't no hollow point

917
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,155
passed through this girl's head.

918
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,490
Her hair was stuck
to the carpet,

919
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,867
the blood already dry.

920
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,704
Did she die in that car,
you want to ask me?

921
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,378
Her blood lividity tells me

922
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:45,507
that she was dead before
she ever got into that car.

923
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,677
If I can vacuum the Buick,
what are we looking for?

924
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,722
I saw muzzle flashes
coming out that Buick.

925
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,141
I didn't see no bullet holes
in that beer joint wall.

926
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,561
See what you can find out.

927
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:03,442
What we waiting on here,
me to smoke this?

928
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,361
I don't know.

929
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,908
Thank you, Henry.

930
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,453
Anybody else
got something to share?

931
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,080
My name's Dave.

932
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,498
I'm an alcoholic.

How about some cappuccino mix?

937
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:02,126
You cops like coffee, right,
or a stereo?

938
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,045
You know anybody been recruiting
girls out the parishes?

939
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,714
Try the bus depot,
for starters.

940
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,008
But who's going to recruit?

941
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,301
Ever since Katrina,

942
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,679
there's cash on the hoof
all over this town.

943
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,306
Maybe this guy does more
than just pimp.

944
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:20,227
Maybe he likes
to hurt these girls.

945
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,020
Been two of them killed already,

946
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,147
maybe more.

947
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,274
Talking about somebody
that operates way down

948
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,234
at the bottom
of the food chain, Dave.

949
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,361
You think Baby Feets Balboni
might have something to do

950
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,156
with something like this?

951
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,371
You're using the names
of local personalities now.

952
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:42,166
It stays with me, Jimmie.

953
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,001
You looking for a guy
who likes to kill hookers?

954
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,045
Mm-hmm.

955
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,839
Don't sound like Baby Feet.

956
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,633
His outfit's running girls,
all right, but ...

957
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,470
they're not worth nothing to him
if they're dead.

958
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,805
Try the bus station.

959
00:57:56,931 --> 00:58:00,476
Try Adonis Brown.

960
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:13,238
You, uh, ladies seem lost.

961
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:16,408
You're not from around here,
are you?

962
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,011
You'll be able
to find some peace,

963
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,679
I promise you.

964
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:38,805
Don't sweat it.

965
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,897
I want you to make a public
service announcement for me,

966
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,065
chere.

967
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,358
I know what it's like
to run away.

968
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,402
Praise Jesus.

969
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,862
There's a call

970
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:57,991
for Mr. Adonis Brown at
the public restroom pay phone.

971
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,039
There's a call
for Mr. Adonis Brown

972
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,375
at the
public restroom pay phone.

973
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,256
This is Adonis.
What's up?

974
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,257
Hello?

975
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,675
Uh!

976
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,721
What you want?

977
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,598
Ah!

978
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,849
Don't do that, man.

979
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:23,892
I ain't no threat to you.

980
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:24,935
Look, I ain't got a gun.

981
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,186
I ain't no trouble.
Uh!

982
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,187
I want to know

983
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:27,938
the name of the guy

984
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,190
you've been delivering
all these girls to.

985
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,483
This one's occupied,
by the way.

986
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,776
Nobody. I ain't
bringing nobody to nobody.

987
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,736
Uh!

988
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,989
You know the guy I'm talking about.

989
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,031
Don't do this to me, man.

990
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:41,493
Uh!

991
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,536
Tell me his name.

992
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,037
This guy likes to hurt people.

993
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,873
You tell me his name,
this'll all be over with.

994
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,333
There's a ...

995
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:53,171
bald-headed,
squirrel-faced white guy.

996
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,966
He carries a gun too.

997
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,634
Nobody fucks with him.

998
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,053
Is that the guy
you're talking about?

999
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,805
Uh!

1000
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:02,931
You tell me.

1001
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,977
He's got juice.
That's all I know.

1002
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,812
I don't know
his fucking name, man.

1003
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,814
He connected?

1004
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,983
With the cops or the mob.

1005
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,653
He's got to be
to stay in business.

1006
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,157
That's all I know.

1007
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,450
Why you doing this to me, man?

1008
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,998
God.

1009
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:31,209
I shit my pants.

1010
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,377
I can't go back out there.

1011
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,420
That's right, Adonis.

1012
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,671
You ain't ever
gonna go back out there.

1013
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,048
You're going
to treat that bus station

1014
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,342
like it's downtown Baghdad.

1015
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,636
Not a good place for you to be.

1016
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,928
Who the fuck are you, man?

1017
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,138
You don't want to know
who I am.

1018
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,640
What you want to do
is start acting right

1019
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,682
and quit doing wrong.

1020
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,683
I'll kill you, Adonis.

1021
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,685
I'll blow
your Goddamn head off

1022
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,396
if you don't find
an honest line of work.

1023
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,692
You stay gone most of the night.

1024
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,860
You don't call.

1025
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,779
I'm sorry.

1026
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,033
I don't deserve to be afraid
you've been hurt.

1027
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,076
No.

1028
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,329
You don't.

1029
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,206
But I'm not going to nag you.

1030
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,979
I really need your help, Dave.

1031
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,897
I really need help.

1032
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:16,940
Go ahead.

1033
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,400
You go ahead
and drown yourself, man.

1034
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,651
I don't care.

1035
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:23,864
Dave, I planned this all week.

1036
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,158
The guy already charged me
for the boat, man

1037
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,367
Elrod ...

1038
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,785
It's going to rain like hell.

1039
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,495
Now, why don't you wait until
after it quits raining,

1040
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,289
and you can go fishing
for black bass and perch

1041
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,583
and bream right out here
in the bayou.

1042
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,460
When was the last time you
caught freshwater fish

1043
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,461
after it rained?

1044
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:38,795
Oh, hell, suit yourself.

1045
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,630
You want to leave
that beer cooler here with me?

1046
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,841
It came with the boat, dude.

1047
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,638
Sure you don't want to come?

1048
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,015
Miss Drummond,

1049
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,559
you need to get yourself
off of that boat right now.

1050
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,479
Please, it's Kelly.

1051
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,567
Watch the bend in the channel.

1052
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,818
It's about three miles south.

1053
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,904
The water's been low

1054
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,071
and gill nets are on the left

1055
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,783
floating on Clorox bottles.

1056
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,284
I got it.

1057
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,695
Hello?

1058
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:53,161
How far down the bayou?

1059
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,081
Well, that's that bend
Batist warned you about.

1060
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,375
Oh.

1061
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,417
What you asking me, Elrod?

1062
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,712
Can you come give us a hand?

1063
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,090
Yeah, I'll come help you out.

1064
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,009
But I am also going
to bill you for my time.

1065
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,751
I got it.

1066
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,928
How'd you hit the gill net?

1067
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:55,223
Didn't you see the bottles?

1068
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,266
Oh, man ...

1069
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,476
I'm an idiot, right?

1070
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,546
You want me

1071
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:27,756
to get down in the water?

1072
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,299
Yeah.

1073
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,468
Get down by the bow
and be ready to push

1074
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,470
when I put the motors in reverse.

1075
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,764
Hey, are there
any alligators around here?

1076
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,266
Oh, hell yeah.

1077
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,226
They're not hungry, though.

1078
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,603
All right.

1079
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,612
Put on a life jacket, El.

1080
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,948
Okay, honey.

1081
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,532
I swam the Trinity River once.

1082
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,326
Watch out for water moccasins.

1083
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,286
What?

1084
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,668
Don't worry about him.

1085
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,086
That water's not very deep.

1086
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,629
I've got to give him
a life jacket.

1087
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:08,964
He'd drown in a bathroom sink.

1088
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,639
Here you go.

1089
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:21,851
It's nothing personal,
Miss Kelly.

1090
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,646
But I think you're a very fine,
beautiful young woman.

1091
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,150
I'm already soaked.

1092
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,653
I was burdened greatly

1093
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:17,449
by the deaths of those
around me, Lieutenant.

1094
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:20,118
But incorporating
their suffering

1095
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:25,623
into our own lives does not
change the way of the world.

1096
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,429
An act of kindness,

1097
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:43,183
one as simple
as giving a girl my raincoat,

1098
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:47,062
had resulted in her death.

1099
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,068
The shooter
had left nothing behind,

1100
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,944
no ejected brass,

1101
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,113
no recoverable prints.

1102
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,449
We had no suspects.

1103
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,203
But one heart-sinking

1104
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:07,957
and unalterable
conclusion remained.

1105
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,585
Kelly Drummond was dead.

1106
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:15,298
And she was dead because
she had been mistaken for me.

1107
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:16,674
The tragic death

1108
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:17,801
of Kelly Drummond,

1109
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,844
the long-time companion
of Elrod Sykes

1110
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,679
and star of the popular
television series

1111
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,890
River Valley,
now appears certain

1112
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,059
to have been a case
of mistaken identity.

1113
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,811
Sources within
the sheriff's department

1114
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,146
confirmed that
they now believe the fatal shot

1115
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,981
may have been intended
for someone else.

1116
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,285
I'm going to miss her, Dave.

1117
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,748
Ah.

1118
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:57,841
You want him to stay here?

1119
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,342
Guy's in bad shape.

1120
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,552
This is our home.

1121
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,804
Mr. Sykes just did
the rainbow yawn again.

1122
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,097
Go to bed.

1123
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,228
The guy needs an AA friend,
or he's not going to make it.

1124
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:11,813
So what? I don't care.

1125
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,899
Tell you what,
I'm going to make you a deal.

1126
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,151
First time he takes a drink,

1127
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,944
he gets 86ed right straight back

1128
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,113
to his movie star trailer house.

1129
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,698
He pays for his share
of the food.

1130
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,199
He does not tie up the bathroom.

1131
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:26,619
He does not come in late.

1132
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,164
Okay, but only for a few days.

1133
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,595
Do you like being a movie star?

1134
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:48,975
It's just a job, honey.

1135
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:51,603
Really?
Yeah.

1136
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:52,729
It's like Dave.

1137
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,564
You think he enjoys
enforcing the law,

1138
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:55,690
catching the bad guys,

1139
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:57,150
making the good people
feel better?

1140
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,193
Yeah.

1141
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,237
Yeah, well ...

1142
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:02,447
I like my job.

1143
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:08,203
I'm sorry about Kelly.

1144
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:12,957
Me too, honey.

1145
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,922
Um ...

1146
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:22,842
I've got 50 movie posters here
from Tears and Diamonds.

1147
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:28,181
I hate that picture.

1148
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:32,060
Well, 50 movie posters
signed by Elrod Sykes

1149
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:33,561
will fetch $25,000.

1150
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:36,564
That's four roofs,

1151
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:38,233
eight with volunteer labor.

1152
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,110
Here's your felt-tip pen.

1153
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,041
The worst thing

1154
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:59,045
a cop can do to himself
is eat his own gun.

1155
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:02,465
Lou Girard
always called at night.

1156
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:06,219
Tonight someone else
had to make the call for him.

1157
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,316
There's a half-empty bottle

1158
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,651
of Bourbon here on the dresser,

1159
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:25,363
spilled bottle of Diazepam
here on the coffee table.

1160
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,660
Y'all writing that off
as a suicide?

1161
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:33,162
Well, that's the way
it looks to me.

1162
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,331
He was in bad shape.

1163
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:38,126
Mattress is covered
in piss stains.

1164
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,003
The sink is full
of raw garbage.

1165
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,505
Where's the gun at?

1166
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,007
By the bedside.

1167
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,466
If Lou Girard wanted
to kill his self,

1168
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:48,761
how come he didn't use
that .357?

1169
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:50,305
'Cause he was drunk
on his ass.

1170
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,349
Not an unusual condition
for him.

1171
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,519
He was helping me
on a case, Doobie.

1172
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,770
And?

1173
01:11:57,896 --> 01:11:59,063
Maybe he found out something

1174
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:00,815
somebody did not
want him to know.

1175
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:06,863
He was trembling,
eating pills every morning,

1176
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,574
in front of everybody.

1177
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,951
There's no big mystery
to what happened here tonight.

1178
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,704
He was a good cop.

1179
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:18,166
He was a sorry-ass drunk.

1180
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,712
Now, if you want to look
at anything else, hurry up.

1181
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:25,048
I'm going
to seal the place.

1182
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,217
I appreciate you waiting outside
just for a moment.

1183
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,553
Matter of fact, I appreciate you
staying as far away from me

1184
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,305
as you can possibly get.

1185
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:30,029
What had Lou found out

1186
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,572
that had cost him his life?

1187
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:37,203
Hogman Patin knew a lot
and seldom said anything.

1188
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:39,831
Now I got word
he wanted to talk to me.

1189
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,963
I started to think about
when I was in the pen.

1190
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,715
And your daddy,
he brought my mother food

1191
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,384
and paid for her medicine
up at the store

1192
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,470
when she was sick.

1193
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,389
You got something
to say to me, Sam?

1194
01:13:56,515 --> 01:14:00,143
What was the name of that nigger
you dug up out the sandbar?

1195
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,103
DeWitt Prejean.

1196
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,898
He was fucking a white man's wife.

1197
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,483
Start asking what
he's doing for a living,

1198
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:11,529
and you'll find the people been
causing you all this grief.

1199
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:13,364
Who's the man I'm looking for?

1200
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:18,202
I said all I can say.

1201
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,621
This still
the state of Louisiana.

1202
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,223
Why you keep bothering me?

1203
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:42,643
I need to know what kind of work
DeWitt Prejean did.

1204
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:43,936
Done nigger work.

1205
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:46,689
You know, he cut lawns,
cleaned out grease traps,

1206
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,983
got the dead rats out
from under people's houses.

1207
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,860
What the fuck you think he did?

1208
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,279
Don't sound right to me.

1209
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:56,866
I think he did
some other kind of work too.

1210
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,576
You leave me alone.

1211
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,912
You're a pretty good
judge of character, Mr. Hebert.

1212
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,122
Do I look like somebody
that's going to go away?

1213
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:07,543
Hm?

1214
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,296
It was better back then.

1215
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,464
You know it was.

1216
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,549
What kind of work he do, Ben?

1217
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,261
Drove a truck.

1218
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:18,846
Who for?

1219
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:22,141
It was over in Jeanerette.

1220
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:27,563
I brung her out here
'cause she works for me,

1221
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,858
'cause I can't get in and out
of the car good by myself.

1222
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:38,491
He worked seasonal
for a white man,

1223
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,076
owned some big sugar mill.

1224
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,953
I don't know nothing about him

1225
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,581
except he was a brother
of that crippled fellow.

1226
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,167
That's all I know and nothing more.

1227
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:52,838
You saying I do,
then you're a Goddamn liar.

1228
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,799
Something else you want to say?

1229
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:59,136
You got a fish on your line.

1230
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,437
Batist.

1231
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,440
Yo.

1232
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,943
How many sugar mills they got
over there in Jeanerette?

1233
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,069
Just one.

1234
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:16,195
Mm-hmm.

1235
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,037
Hey.

1236
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:26,998
Come on in.

1237
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,500
Stopped by to say good-bye,

1238
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:32,545
give you a going-away present.

1239
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:35,047
Where you headed, Cholo?

1240
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:36,299
Thought I might go to Florida,

1241
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:39,635
maybe open a business
like you got here.

1242
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,304
What you doing with
all that lawn furniture

1243
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,764
in the back end of your pickup?

1244
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,267
Oh, um,

1245
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:49,478
guy at the Holiday Inn wanted me
to take it when I checked out.

1246
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:53,649
Said I'd kind of be doing
him a favor, you know?

1247
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:54,692
Giving him a write-off.

1248
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,320
Uh-huh.

1249
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,196
You had some trouble
with Baby Feet.

1250
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,284
Yeah.

1251
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,456
I told him he was a douche bag

1252
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:09,665
and I wouldn't work for him again

1253
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,334
even if he begged me.

1254
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,793
That Cherry LeBlanc girl
was right

1255
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:14,337
when she called him
a needle-dick.

1256
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,213
That's when the son of a bitch
comes across my mouth

1257
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,256
with this big --

1258
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:19,675
Now, wait, wait, wait.

1259
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,344
What's this
about Cherry LeBlanc?

1260
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:28,726
If he tells you
he never knew her,

1261
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:30,645
ask him about this.

1262
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,318
Julie forgot he told me
to take some souvenir pictures

1263
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:40,363
when we drove over
to Biloxi last year.

1264
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,489
Is that her or not?

1265
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,330
Did Baby Feets kill this girl?

1266
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,001
Come on, Lieutenant.

1267
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:55,044
You know how it works.

1268
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,463
A guy like Julie don't do hits.

1269
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:58,714
He says something to somebody,

1270
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,549
then he forgets it.

1271
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,719
If it's a special kind of job,
maybe somebody calls up a geek.

1272
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,346
Did Baby Feets make that call?

1273
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,350
Start a photo album, Lieutenant.

1274
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:12,853
Make up your own mind.

1275
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,193
What's Murphy Doucet
doing in this picture?

1276
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,083
What's wrong, Dave?

1277
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:35,501
Got a loose ignition wire.

1278
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,211
You got a knife I could use?

1279
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:38,963
Yeah, I ought to have something.

1280
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:48,764
This should do.

1281
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,058
Some Mexican pulled this on me
in Lake Charles.

1282
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:54,395
I didn't know
you were a cop in Lake Charles.

1283
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:55,604
I wasn't.

1284
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,398
I was working highway
for the state police.

1285
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:58,941
That's where
I retired from last year.

1286
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,110
Is that when you got into
business with Twinky LeMoyne?

1287
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,237
No, we go back a ways further.

1288
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,374
Thanks for the knife.

1289
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:17,084
What's the deal?

1290
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,711
Lou Girard was
looking at her file last week.

1291
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:19,920
Lou arrested her

1292
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:21,130
on a prostitution charge.

1293
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:22,631
It wouldn't be one officer.

1294
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,467
It was a state police raid
on a bar --

1295
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,135
State police?
Who sent that arrest report?

1296
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:27,803
Oh, Sgt. Murphy Doucet.

1297
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,972
Murphy Doucet.

1298
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,442
I'd missed it.

1299
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:46,113
Lou Girard had dug up
Cherry LeBlanc's arrest record,

1300
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,865
and it had cost him his life.

1301
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,537
But this was going to be the end
of the line for Murphy Doucet.

1302
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:50,094
I wasn't planting evidence,
I kept telling myself.

1303
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,137
I was just removing it

1304
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:54,473
before a guilty man
could destroy it.

1305
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,438
Why the hell are y'all here?

1306
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,023
We're here because of you,
Mr. Doucet.

1307
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:05,192
We've been checking
all the unsolved murders

1308
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:07,403
of females in areas
surrounding highways

1309
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,946
during the time you were working
for the state police.

1310
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:10,155
Rosie, I think

1311
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,407
we just found the knife

1312
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,033
that he used on Cherry LeBlanc.

1313
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:15,411
That knife wasn't there.

1314
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:16,579
I say it was,

1315
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,164
and I say your fingerprints
are all over it.

1316
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:20,416
I see.

1317
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:24,545
You and this Mexican bitch
are in on it together, huh?

1318
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,630
No, Murphy.

1319
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:29,508
I'm fucking you all by myself.

1320
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:30,926
Get your hands up now.

1321
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,428
Get your hands up,
up against that --

1322
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,138
up against that wall.

1323
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,059
Y'all are setting me up,
and I don't even know why.

1324
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:40,769
Think about it.

1325
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:41,770
Think hard.

1326
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,648
Think all the way back to 1965,

1327
01:21:44,774 --> 01:21:46,400
just before that hurricane hit.

1328
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:49,194
Y'all made DeWitt Prejean
run with that chain

1329
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,779
locked around his chest,

1330
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,698
shot his leg out
from underneath him.

1331
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,827
You didn't notice the boy
that was watching you

1332
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:58,537
from across the swamp,
though, did you?

1333
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,648
I don't know how you did it,
but you planted that knife.

1334
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,150
Time is always on
the bad guy's side, Rosie.

1335
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:31,278
We wait for warrants while
they deep-six the evidence.

1336
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,866
I didn't hear what you said.

1337
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,671
Jesus wienie, Dave.

1338
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,297
Y'all done
tore this place to pieces.

1339
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:52,341
You want to stay behind
and clean it up?

1340
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,801
I don't want to be
nowhere around here

1341
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:54,843
when that guy gets home.

1342
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,136
You heard he's out on bond?

1343
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:57,179
Screw that.

1344
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,181
He'll be here any minute.

1345
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:07,731
We got nothing.

1346
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,571
Alfie.

1347
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,573
You know where

1348
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,701
your little girl's at?

1349
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,703
She's right here on my knee.

1350
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:27,584
You sound speechless.

1351
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:28,627
Turn her loose, Doucet.

1352
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:29,878
You don't want to do this.

1353
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,172
I'll make it simple
for both of us.

1354
01:23:32,298 --> 01:23:34,258
You take that knife
out of the evidence locker,

1355
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,260
you put it in a Ziploc bag.

1356
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:37,720
At 8:00 tomorrow morning,

1357
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,388
you leave the bag in a trash can

1358
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:43,058
on the corner of Royal
and St. Anne in New Orleans.

1359
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,393
You listen to me, Doucet.

1360
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:45,394
Think about this.

1361
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,437
You're a cop.

1362
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:47,688
You can skate on this.

1363
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:49,440
We've been jacking you around
the whole time.

1364
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,567
You lying son of a bitch.

1365
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:54,945
You won't rest till you
fuck me up every way you can.

1366
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:57,281
You said
only one thing right today:

1367
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:58,782
I'm going to skate.

1368
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:01,535
And you're going to help me.

1369
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,160
Finally lost your mind, Dave?

1370
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:44,995
Young lady, you need
to stay away from this man.

1371
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:46,288
Okay, let's go.

1372
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:47,873
Get out of here.
Come on, let's go.

1373
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:50,125
Nothing good
on TV tonight, Dave?

1374
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,211
Murphy Doucet has my daughter.

1375
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:56,632
Did you hear what I said?

1376
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:57,674
That's too bad.

1377
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,134
I don't like
to hear stuff like that.

1378
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,261
It upsets me.

1379
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:06,600
Hey, maybe you can get her face
on one of them milk cartons.

1380
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:19,113
Where's my daughter, Julie?

1381
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:24,952
Oh!

1382
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:25,994
Ah!

1383
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,121
Uh!

1384
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:39,675
Where's Alafair at?

1385
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,260
I cut Doucet loose.

1386
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:44,304
I got nothing to do
with what he does.

1387
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:45,389
You get off my fucking back

1388
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:48,142
or I swear to God,
I'll square this.

1389
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:51,395
Cop or not,
I'll put out on open contract.

1390
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:52,938
I'll cowboy
your whole fucking family.

1391
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,149
Ah!

1392
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,819
Your window of opportunity's
closing down.

1393
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:00,320
Where's my baby girl?

1394
01:26:00,446 --> 01:26:02,114
I'm telling you the truth.

1395
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,532
I got nothing to do
with what he does.

1396
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:04,533
He's a geek.

1397
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,994
I don't hire geeks.
I run them off.

1398
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,750
Last by God chance.

1399
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,630
He's got a camp
out by Bayou Vista,

1400
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:22,718
almost at Atchafalaya Basin.

1401
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,011
The deed's not in his name.

1402
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:25,220
Nobody knows about it.

1403
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:28,891
It's at the end
of the dirt road,

1404
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:29,975
by the salt marsh.

1405
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,687
Alafair there?

1406
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:37,858
I hope to God she's not.

1407
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,317
Alfie!

1408
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:18,787
Come here.

1409
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,122
Did he hurt you, baby?

1410
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,331
I told him he better not.

1411
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:24,751
I told him what you do.

1412
01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:27,963
I just shot a man
armed with a rolled-up magazine.

1413
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,297
No, no.

1414
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,299
He had a gun on him.

1415
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,260
You just don't
remember it yet.

1416
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,514
You okay?

1417
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,685
Should I call my lawyer?

1418
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:26,480
Mr. LeMoyne,

1419
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:30,442
I saw you and Murphy Doucet

1420
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:34,654
kill DeWitt Prejean
out on the Atchafalaya.

1421
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,991
I watched it
from across the swamp.

1422
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:41,870
Your crippled brother
couldn't kill DeWitt,

1423
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:43,455
so you did it for him.

1424
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:48,835
Am I under arrest?

1425
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:51,296
I think Murphy Doucet's
been blackmailing you with it

1426
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:54,799
all these years.

1427
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,886
A lot of bad things happened
back in that era

1428
01:31:58,012 --> 01:31:58,970
between the races.

1429
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:01,723
But we're not the same people

1430
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:03,725
we were then,
are we?

1431
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,519
I think we are.

1432
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:11,566
You seem unable
to let the past rest.

1433
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:13,401
It's been my experience

1434
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:16,488
that you let go of the past
by addressing it.

1435
01:32:17,823 --> 01:32:19,533
Please, leave.

1436
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:21,243
It won't make
any difference if I leave.

1437
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:23,203
You're going to drag
this one around with you

1438
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:27,541
all day long every day,
like a log chain,

1439
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:29,334
for the rest of your life.

1440
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:34,130
Have you no mercy, sir?

1441
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:38,218
No, sir.

1442
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:40,554
No, sir, I don't.

1443
01:33:01,033 --> 01:33:02,284
Julie Balboni

1444
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,703
finally went down,

1445
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:06,955
but in a way nobody expected,

1446
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:09,082
in a beef with the IRS.

1447
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:10,375
They shipped Baby Feet

1448
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:12,210
up to a maximum security unit

1449
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:14,629
at Leavenworth, Kansas,

1450
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,006
a place that, in wintertime,

1451
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,465
makes you believe
that sub-zero winds

1452
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:20,802
blow from four
directions simultaneously.

1453
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:28,935
Elrod Sykes
never took another drink.

1454
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:30,687
He brought Alafair to the set

1455
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:33,023
and gave her a little part
in the movie.

1456
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,150
Months later,
when the picture was finished,

1457
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:36,484
he called us from California

1458
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:39,446
to say that Alafair
had been his salvation.

1459
01:33:47,246 --> 01:33:48,622
I thought in the morning mists

1460
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:49,998
that curled around the bayou

1461
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:53,168
I might again see
General John Bell Hood,

1462
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:55,045
just a glimpse, perhaps,

1463
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,172
a doff of his hat,

1464
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,674
the kindness of his smile,

1465
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,885
the beleaguered affection

1466
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,137
that always seemed
to linger in his face.

1467
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:09,684
Then as the days passed

1468
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,519
and I began to let go
of all the violent events

1469
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:12,854
of that summer,

1470
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:15,106
I came to accept that the General,

1471
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:16,816
as Bootsie had said,

1472
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:19,569
was only a figment
of my imagination,

1473
01:34:19,695 --> 01:34:22,364
there to remind me
out of the distant past

1474
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,867
that the contest
is never quite over,

1475
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:28,787
the field never quite ours.
