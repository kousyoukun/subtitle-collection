1
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:42,758
Father, I want...

2
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:43,918
...to confess.

3
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:45,918
What you have done?

4
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:48,398
Nothing, father.
I haven't sinned,...

5
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:52,038
...but I intend to commit
all the evil I can.

6
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:53,438
What?

7
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:55,639
- Why?
- Because it's necessary.

8
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:59,638
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

9
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:01,799
I've discovered it.

10
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:04,198
I've deciphered the code.

11
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:16,718
Listen to me.

12
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,119
I'm speaking as a friend.
Why do you keep at it?

13
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:24,118
We've been trying for years.

14
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:25,838
We both know it is...

15
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,999
...impossible.

16
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:29,838
You'll only harm yourself.

17
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,239
Now, will you listen to me?

18
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,399
Have you told anyone else?

19
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:57,439
- Will you help me?
- Yes.

20
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:00,958
We don't have much time.

21
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,559
Remember one thing.

22
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,838
Our enemy is powerful.
He will do away with us...

23
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,319
...if he gets the chance.

24
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,399
He may have heard
this conversation.

25
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,039
Holy God!

26
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,359
Father...

27
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,799
Can we bear this cross?

28
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:21,879
Yes.

29
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,039
If we stay united,
we'll manage it.

30
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,199
With God's help.

31

EUROPE'S GATEWAY

32
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,199
Give me a few coins, father.
It's for the child.

33
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,200
I hope you rot in Hell!

TRAMP BURNED ALIVE
WHILE HE WAS SLEEPING

36
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:26,641
His body was removed
last night...

37
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:27,802
...by the Police.

38
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:33,042
This vandalism,...

39
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:35,281
...with the slogan
"Clean up Madrid",...

40
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,881
...is rampant at present.
in the capital.

41
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,602
if you want to know what
your future will be, call me.

42
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,282
Taxi! Taxi!

43
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:21,002
Happy are the merciful,...

44
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:23,403
...for they shall have mercy
shown them.

45
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:27,402
Happy are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.

46
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:31,722
Happy are the peacemakers,
for they shall see God.

THE FUTURE IS IN YOUR HANDS.
New Athenaeum Lecture Hall

48
00:07:56,723 --> 00:08:00,082
- Why did you give me this?
- To read it, of course.

49
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,203
Who sent you?

50
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:03,602
The agency.

51
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:07,322
Give me a break.
Throw it away, if you want.

52
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:10,563
- Let me do my job.
- You know who I am, don't you?

53
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,202
What is this?

54
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:16,123
Is it "Candid Camera"?

55
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,483
I'm in no mood for cameras.

56
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:22,763
- I want to be one of you.
- You want to hand out leaflets?

57
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:24,602
I want to see the Devil.

58
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,763
I don't give a fuck
what you want to see!

59
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,403
Go away,
you're scaring people!

60
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:36,443
I always get stuck
with the crazies!

61
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:37,763
Fuck it, anyway!

62
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,083
What is this?

63
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,523
You want to pay for one
and take four?

64
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:07,123
Don't fucking come back!

65
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:10,083
Shit! Another glass case.

66
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,844
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

67
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:16,643
I'm looking for this.

68
00:09:21,443 --> 00:09:22,403
Heavy stuff.

69
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:24,364
Look in that drawer.

70
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:28,884
- You're a priest, right?
- Yes.

71
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,004
In that gear...

72
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:33,404
Well, I'm really
a theology professor.

73
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:38,164
That's Catechism, isn't it?
I studied Ethics, you know.

74
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:40,084
And look where I ended up!

75
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,364
May I hear this one?

76
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:53,083
Heavy, right?

77
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:54,964
It isn't bad.

78
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:58,124
- Can you play it backwards?
- Yeah, sure.

79
00:09:58,444 --> 00:10:01,843
It'll sound the same,
but it fucks up the turntable.

80
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:07,964
No, no, no, it isn't that.

81
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:10,004
What are you looking for?

82
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,803
I'm looking for a message,
a signal.

83
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:17,764
Listen to this.

84
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:20,444
They're not famous
but they're good.

85
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:22,244
The words are real sharp.

86
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:24,324
Lots of message.

87
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:26,404
And they're local guys.

88
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,564
It's a different sound.

89
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:35,204
Well, it's a demo.

90
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:38,165
Wait till they make a record.

91
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:39,805
Here, take it.

92
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:43,284
I won't pay.

93
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:44,564
No problem.

94
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:45,484
Really?

95
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:48,764
On the house.
I like your taste.

96
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,484
A pleasure meeting you.

97
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:58,124
Going on a trip?

98
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,605
- Actually, I've just arrived.
- Tomorrow, you can...

99
00:11:02,324 --> 00:11:03,564
...see them in Hell.

100
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:04,485
Where?

101
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:08,404
In Hell. It's a music venue.
Great name.

102
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,284
Impossible to forget.

103
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:13,925
But tomorrow's Christmas Eve.
I doubt if I can go.

104
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:18,804
If you need a hostel,
I know one.

105
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,885
I'll write down the name.
My old lady runs it.

106
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,125
A nice friendly atmosphere.

107
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,004
Here, call round.

108
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:30,005
Thank you.

109
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:31,964
So long.

110
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:34,605
SATANNICA
in Concert

111
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:38,205
Garca's Boarding House.

112
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,085
Good evening.

113
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,645
- Who is on the line?
- This is Mari Carmen.

114
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:00,365
Where are you calling from?

115
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:03,525
- From Valladolid.
And what do you want to know?

116
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,405
My husband is unemployed.
Will it take him very long...

117
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,645
...to find work?

118
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:10,685
Let's see, Mari Carmen.

119
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,765
Mari Carmen, your husband
isn't going to find work...

120
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:17,886
...for a long period of time.
At least five years.

121
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:20,285
- But there's something else.
- What?

122
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,085
A serious health problem.

123
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,046
- For my husband?
- No, for you.

124
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:26,565
I'd like a room.

125
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,246
The only one left
is being done up.

126
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:30,646
I'm not fussy.

127
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:32,925
I can't accept anyone
at this time.

128
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:35,846
The boy didn't tell me
about that.

129
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:37,646
What boy?

130
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,725
One who works in a record shop.

131
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:43,285
Come in.

132
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,486
The room costs 3,000.
The bath tap doesn't work.

133
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:51,206
No visitors or pets allowed,
and I'll need some I.D.

134
00:12:54,446 --> 00:12:55,406
Thank you.

135
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,405
The front door key.

136
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,445
And I'll always be here
to open this door.

137
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:03,686
Thank you.

138
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:05,606
Can you hear me?

139
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,366
Yes, yes.

140
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:10,646
I think you should
get ready for the worst.

141
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:13,605
- Are you staying a week?
- No, just tonight.

142
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,046
This is too much.

143
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:16,766
It doesn't matter.

144
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:30,286
This is the room. I told you
it was being done up.

145
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,966
It's perfect. Thank you.

146
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,006
- Need anything?
- No, not just now.

147
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:35,966
All right. Happy Christmas.

148
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:33,966
I've told you before.

149
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:36,487
You accept nobody at night!

150
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:40,166
- You open the door, that's all.
- It was a priest.

151
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:42,047
Even if it was the Pope!

152
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:44,087
You can't trust anybody.

153
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,247
They pull a knife
and that's it.

154
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:50,327
The world is full of bastards!
The woman on the second floor...

155
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:53,487
...was robbed on the stairs
by a guy with a syringe.

156
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,086
She got off lightly.

157
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:58,207
Look at what this street
is like at night time.

158
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,567
Full of whores, blacks,
drug addicts, killers.

159
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:03,726
It's disgusting!

160
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:05,687
You know what?

161
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,367
I wish that one of them
would come here.

162
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,527
First, I'd blow his balls off
with a shotgun!

163
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:14,847
For being a coward!

164
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:16,967
Then I'd break his bones.

165
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:20,167
He'd be in a wheelchair
the rest of his life!

166
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,287
He'd know what suffering was!

167
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:24,527
He's really a priest?

168
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:25,808
He wore a soutane.

169
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:26,807
And so?

170
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:31,047
Look, your son sent him.
And this is Christmas Eve.

171
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:34,407
If he's a friend of my son,
that's even worse!

172
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:36,608
He paid 25,000 pesetas
for one night!

173
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:42,207
That's different.

174
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,208
He probably taught my son
at the Jesuits.

175
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:49,088
I don't know.

176
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,927
I still don't like
what you did.

177
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,248
- I'll speak to him.
- He seems very nice.

178
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:56,967
OCCULT SCIENCES

179
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:59,327
Demon Magic

180
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:20,768
"I can help you achieve
the impossible. " Cavan.

181
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:39,088
You have to pay for the book.

182
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:40,768
What? What book?

183
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:49,688
Name?

184
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:51,288
Angel.

185
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,488
- Angel what?
- Angel Berriartua.

186
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,728
- Are you a priest?
- Yes.

187
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,528
Priest. That's great.

188
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:06,488
"The Magic World
of Professor Cavan. "

189
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:09,288
Aren't you a bit old
to be stealing books?

190
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,448
I need that book.

191
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,368
I need lots of things too,...

192
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:15,529
...but I work all day
to pay for them.

193
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:17,689
I can't buy it.

194
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,328
- You can't?
- No.

195
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:20,889
Why can't you?

196
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:22,649
You have no money?

197
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:25,288
- No, it isn't that.
- So what is it?

198
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,408
I must learn to do evil.

199
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:29,609
Why is that?

200
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,529
I have to contact Satan.

201
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:34,608
Satan?

202
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:36,408
That can't be easy.

203
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:38,608
No, that's why I need the book.

204
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:41,088
I'm a theology professor.

205
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:44,528
I've studied the Apocalypse
of St. John for 25 years,...

206
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:47,329
...and I've discovered that
it is just a cryptogram.

207
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:50,169
- A kleptogram?
- No, a cryptogram.

208
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,728
It's a message in code.

209
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:57,049
A secret message
hidden behind the words.

210
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:00,289
- And you've discovered it?
- Exactly.

211
00:18:00,489 --> 00:18:01,489
Last week.

212
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:05,529
I based my work on a numerical
transcription of the Apocalypse.

213
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:09,409
At first, I used Tritheim's
Steganography. Have you read...

214
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:10,129
...Tritheim?

215
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:11,929
Tritheim? I think not.

216
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:13,409
Well, it's fundamental.

217
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:16,609
It inspired me to see
the Apocalypse...

218
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,489
...not as an allegory
but as an equation.

219
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:23,049
Each letter has its own number.
So, for example,...

220
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:25,289
...Daleth is worth four,
and Synn...

221
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:29,849
...is worth three hundred,
so we can...

222
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:31,169
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

223
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:34,289
Could you come up
to the toy department?

224
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,409
I'm busy now.
I'll come up later.

225
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:40,729
We can do this
with all the words and...

226
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:43,289
Father, does anyone else
know this?

227
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,769
Yes, of course.
But he died.

228
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:48,769
- Two days ago.
- I'm sorry.

229
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:52,289
Don't worry, I believe you.
We can sort everything out.

230
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,009
But what does the message say?

231
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,649
The message is a figure,
a date.

232
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,289
The date of the end
of the world.

233
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,769
Today, to be exact.

234
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,489
Yes, that is very important.

235
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,889
Just wait here for a moment,
please.

236
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,290
One second.

237
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,689
Check the asylums to see...

238
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,370
...if a priest has escaped.

239
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,409
And tell them to send someone.

240
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,570
Well, father...

241
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,290
Mr. Cerezo!

242
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,889
Are you all right?

243
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,450
Mr. Cerezo!

244
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:31,531
Look, this is all burned.
Totally burned.

245
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:40,090
Hey, father!

246
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,810
- Is your room all right?
- Yes, it's fine.

247
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:44,131
I must talk to you,...

248
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,290
...Jose Maria.

249
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:48,491
If there's any problem,
I'll get them to change you.

250
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,011
Jose Maria...

251
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:58,651
Hot stuff. I've been trying
for a year to shag her.

252
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,891
- But it's no go.
- What?

253
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,371
Shag her. Know what I mean?

254
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:06,571
It was no go. She's from
a village in Toledo.

255
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:10,331
I hear you're in the new room.
I'm Rosario, Jose Maria's mother.

256
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:11,731
A pleasure.

257
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:13,851
Will you have some rabbit?

258
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:17,491
No, I have to talk
to Jose Maria.

259
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:18,731
We've got lots.

260
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:22,251
He's working now,...

261
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:25,571
...in a record shop,
but he's really an artist.

262
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:26,731
Fuck off!

263
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:30,651
He's doing a drawing course
just now.

264
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:34,011
But as the shop won't
give him a contract...

265
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:36,931
Enjoy your meal.

266
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:42,971
I bet you that we'll have
rabbit again tonight.

267
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:45,811
She always buys
the fucking special offers!

268
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,771
May I ask you a favor?

269
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,051
Sure, anything.

270
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:52,452
Grandad!

271
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:53,811
This is my grandad.

272
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:56,891
He likes going around
the house starkers.

273
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,491
This is a friend,
Father...

274
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:01,372
Angel Berriartua.

275
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:02,892
I love him.

276
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,091
This is just...

277
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:09,251
...to jazz him up a bit,
because he's pretty old now.

278
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:13,812
Grandad...

279
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:15,571
That's it.

280
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,892
They say it's bad circulation.

281
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,651
The other day he said
he saw the Virgin.

282
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:25,011
He's too much.
Want some acid?

283
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:26,491
No, thank you.

284
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:30,132
If it weren't for me,
my fucking mother...

285
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:32,691
...would put him away.

286
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,011
Jose Maria, I have a mission.

287
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:36,572
Where? In Africa?

288
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,731
No, I have a mission
to carry out.

289
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:41,292
Something I have to do
here in the city.

290
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,572
- You're a Satannic follower?
- Yeah, sure.

291
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:45,851
Can you invoke the devil?

292
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,172
- I have to invoke the devil.
- Why?

293
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:51,331
Because of the Apocalypse.

294
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:52,732
- The film?
- No, no.

295
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:54,252
The book in the Bible.

296
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:56,172
Never mind.

297
00:22:56,372 --> 00:22:59,332
Tonight, the Antichrist will be
born, but I don't know where.

298
00:22:59,532 --> 00:23:02,132
- So I must invoke the Devil.
- Heavy!

299
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:05,732
I'm a sinner now.

300
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,052
I've betrayed Christ
to make salvation possible.

301
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:12,412
I'm one hell of a sinner too.

302
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:17,172
I must sell my soul to the devil
but I don't know how.

303
00:23:18,852 --> 00:23:20,852
I stole a book,
but it's no good.

304
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:22,252
It doesn't explain it
very well.

305
00:23:23,692 --> 00:23:25,212
It's Cavan, from the TV!

306
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:28,333
My mother loves him.
He's a bastard.

307
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,012
There isn't much time.
Can we do anything?

308
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,852
Cool it, we'll manage it.

309
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:53,372
THE DARK ZONE

310
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:57,492
Here he is, the investigator
of the occult,...

311
00:23:58,412 --> 00:23:59,853
...the magician of mystery,...

312
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,093
...the master...

313
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:02,812
...of the supernatural.

314
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:05,292
The man who knows
the present,...

315
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,612
...the past and the future.

316
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:11,693
The internationally known
Professor...

317
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:12,853
...Cavan.

318
00:24:13,212 --> 00:24:16,173
Tonight's program is going
to be very special.

319
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,773
We're not going to talk about
UFOs or miracle cures.

320
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:22,173
Nor will we be taking
your calls.

321
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:25,133
Tonight we have with us
a guest who is...

322
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,293
...exceptional.

323
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:29,293
Someone about whom
we have all heard,...

324
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:31,773
...but only a few really know.

325
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:35,013
I am talking about the Devil!

326
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:45,133
Heavy!

327
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:47,693
How do you feel now it's over?

328
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:50,493
Great, thanks to you
and the Dark Zone team.

329
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:53,093
Juan Carios Cruz
is eleven years old.

330
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:56,253
A month ago, Juan Carios
had a strange illness...

331
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,493
...which no doctor
could diagnose.

332
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:02,213
Juan Carios behaved
as if he were someone else.

333
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,653
As he said,
"Like I had a man inside".

334
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:09,014
The Dark Zone team got a call
from his desperate parents,...

335
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:12,773
...unable to find any reason
for their son's behavior.

336
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,213
Soon after, we went
to their home.

337
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,094
This is what happened.

338
00:25:18,454 --> 00:25:20,733
it's you!
At last, you're here!

339
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:22,813
- Where is he?
- in his room.

340
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:24,654
Take it easy, ma'am.

341
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:26,933
Whatever happens in there,...

342
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,333
...remember it's for
your son's good.

343
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:31,013
Let's go!

344
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:32,294
This way!

345
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:34,254
What a fucking set-up!

346
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:37,414
Here! The boy is in here!

347
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:39,854
Hold him down!

348
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:42,014
Quickly!

349
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:44,534
Our Father, who art in...

350
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,254
That's the man I need.

351
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:48,854
That's for sure.

352
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:51,254
I have to talk to him.
Come on.

353
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:53,454
Wait till the program's over.

354
00:25:55,894 --> 00:25:58,734
I exorcise you
by the blood of Christ...

355
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,854
...and return you
to your lair!

356
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:07,454
Our Father,...

357
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:09,134
...who art in Heaven,...

358
00:26:09,854 --> 00:26:11,614
...hallowed be Thy name.

359
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:14,174
Thy kingdom come.

360
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:15,334
Juan Carios...

361
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:18,854
Juan Carios, how are you?
Are you all right?

362
00:26:19,054 --> 00:26:20,014
What happened?

363
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:24,294
Heavy!

364
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,014
That's him.

365
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:39,854
Yes, that's Cavan,
the creep.

366
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:46,334
Let's go!

367
00:26:51,455 --> 00:26:53,655
Last week's program
was real heavy.

368
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,534
- Hurry, we're losing him.
- Cool it.

369
00:26:55,735 --> 00:26:57,574
I've got him.
It was about a chick...

370
00:26:57,775 --> 00:27:00,014
...who was raped by aliens.
Did you see it?

371
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:03,815
If you'd seen her!
She looked like a real slut.

372
00:27:04,014 --> 00:27:06,415
I bet you anything
she provoked them.

373
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:08,495
I don't have a television.

374
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,895
You don't?
What do you do at night?

375
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:12,055
Pray.

376
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:15,415
Pray? But you must have seen
programs like...

377
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,175
..."Final Questions"
or "Sister Citroen".

378
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:21,335
No, that was the first
program I've ever seen.

379
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,494
Fuck!

380
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:23,815
Stop! Stop!

381
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:25,575
He didn't indicate!

382
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:50,015
Clean up Madrid

383
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:02,816
I'll leave the money here.

384
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:17,175
There he is!

385
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,976
Didn't you see
"Jesus Christ Superstar"?

386
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,495
It was fucking great.
"Hosanna, hey...

387
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:42,136
...sanna, sanna sanna hey,
sanna hey, sanna!"

388
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:46,016
Or the other one that went,
"Jesus Christ, Superstar!"

389
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:47,975
- Stop! He's parking!
- All right.

390
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:05,255
Here, father,
it'll bring you luck.

391
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,336
Ennio! This is Susana!

392
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:46,856
I'm on my way over.
We can have dinner together.

393
00:29:47,057 --> 00:29:50,496
But remember, tomorrow we're
taking my mother to lunch.

394
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:54,416
See you in a little while.
So long. See you soon.

395
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:02,976
Good evening.
You must listen...

396
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:04,177
Who are you?

397
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:07,177
I am Angel Berriartua,
from the University...

398
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:10,497
Who gave you this address?
This is my home.

399
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:13,536
Yes. I'm from the University
of Deusto...

400
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:16,696
Please, call the program
for an appointment.

401
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,017
Or write a letter.

402
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,296
But we can't talk now.
Good-bye.

403
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:22,857
But I've discovered
something incredible!

404
00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:25,616
That's great,
but this isn't the time.

405
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:28,457
Call me tomorrow.
I'll deal with it personally.

406
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:30,617
No, it has to be tonight!

407
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:32,657
Why can't it be tomorrow?

408
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:34,217
The Antichrist is coming!

409
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:40,296
All right, let's see.

410
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:42,616
Leave me your address.

411
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:45,496
I'll call you
tomorrow morning,...

412
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:48,137
...you come to the program
and we'll discuss...

413
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:50,017
...the Antichrist. All right?

414
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:52,537
Wait, I'll get my diary.

415
00:31:09,857 --> 00:31:11,418
Now, your name was...?

416
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,177
My God! What have you done?
Are you crazy?

417
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:29,937
I'm just desperate.

418
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:31,777
Now you'll listen to me...

419
00:31:31,978 --> 00:31:32,938
...carefully.

420
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:35,897
Have you read Tritheim?

421
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:59,698
Pope John Paul II receives
Spanish theologians

422
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:01,458
Heavy, man!

423
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:13,218
- You can't park here. Move on.
- What?

424
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,898
- Move on.
- Am I in the way?

425
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:17,778
- You're badly parked.
- My pal's coming now.

426
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:20,858
- Is this your car?
- No, it's my mother's.

427
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:22,337
Your papers, please.

428
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,258
It's always
the same fucking story!

429
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:30,858
You see?

430
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:34,938
Metraton can even substitute
Shaddai. But unfortunately,...

431
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:38,098
...this system only works
with single words!

432
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:39,818
That's a shame.

433
00:32:41,138 --> 00:32:42,858
There had to be something...

434
00:32:43,058 --> 00:32:46,578
...that had confused thinkers
over the years. Isn't that so?

435
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,619
What? Yes, yes.
Please, continue.

436
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:51,938
Well, I found what it was!

437
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:56,218
All the Christian cabbalists
were trying to find a message.

438
00:32:56,739 --> 00:32:58,698
A word behind the Apocalypse.

439
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:00,778
The Word of God.

440
00:33:01,658 --> 00:33:02,578
They were wrong.

441
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:06,698
The message isn't a word.
It's a number.

442
00:33:07,058 --> 00:33:08,139
A number!

443
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:13,018
The sum of the value
of all the words in the text.

444
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,338
Two million...

445
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:17,498
...one hundred and twenty six
thousand, four hundred and ten.

446
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:19,619
That number is a date.

447
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:24,859
2, 126, 410 days in the Jewish
calendar of the time.

448
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:27,019
Understand?

449
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:31,338
A date, a specific day
in the calendar!

450
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,538
Yes, a day.

451
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:36,178
Yes. The Day of the Beast.

452
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,498
The Jews counted time...

453
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:40,818
...from the beginning
of the world,...

454
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,498
...which they dated 3,761 years
before the birth of Christ.

455
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,019
Given that they used
a lunar calendar,...

456
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:49,019
...and we use a solar one,...

457
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:53,059
...that is equivalent to
December 25, 1995.

458
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,499
You mean, tomorrow.

459
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,979
No! Tonight, before dawn.
What is the Apocalypse about?

460
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:02,819
I don't know,
I can't remember.

461
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,979
The beginning of the end
of the world.

462
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,819
If we don't prevent it,...

463
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:10,499
...the Antichrist
will be born tonight.

464
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,019
But I need your help.

465
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,699
You must help me
contact the Devil.

466
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:25,019
What?

467
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:27,539
I know the date,
but not the place!

468
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,739
Where will it be?

469
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:33,659
I don't know.
I haven't the slightest idea.

470
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,340
To find out,
I have to join them.

471
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:38,579
I must sell my soul
to the Devil.

472
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,900
I'll be at the ceremony tonight
and I'll kill him there.

473
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:45,419
I'll kill the Antichrist,...

474
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:47,580
...and the world may be saved.

475
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,459
That's why I need to contact
the Devil, and you can do it.

476
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:56,819
But this is all...
This can't be happening!

477
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,739
Will you be much longer?

478
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,579
I'm badly parked again
and we'll have to move soon.

479
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,140
You're the TV guy?

480
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,219
- A pleasure.
- Who is this?

481
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,940
I'm Jose Mari.

482
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,420
Neat place!

483
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,900
These masks are plastic,
aren't they?

484
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,260
If you want to rob the house,
go ahead,...

485
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:19,979
...but there's no money.

486
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,260
How can I make you believe me?

487
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,900
All right. If you want me
to believe you, I do.

488
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,860
But why is it going to be here?
It could be somewhere else!

489
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,020
No! It will be here,
in Madrid!

490
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,820
You don't believe me.
There are hundreds of signs!

491
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,020
Look.

492
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,540
Newly born babies are
disappearing. Just look!

493
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,860
Fifty cases!

494
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,180
Desecrated graves.

495
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,260
100 cases here in Madrid
in just one year!

496
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,780
Is that not enough?

497
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,820
It just proves you're crazy!

498
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,980
And if it is true,
how will you fool the Devil?

499
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,380
Will you turn up
like it's a wedding?

500
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,740
No, it won't be
like a wedding.

501
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,340
There won't be thousands
adoring him. Nothing like that!

502
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,100
- Oh, no?
- No!

503
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:09,820
Damn!

504
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,301
The Devil tries to imitate God
in order mock him.

505
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:17,020
The birth of his son will
imitate the birth of Jesus.

506
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,420
Like a secret,
but visible to all,...

507
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:20,821
...as in Bethlehem.

508
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:23,701
Will the Wise Men be there too?

509
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,701
- We'll be the Wise Men.
- Us? Fucking great!

510
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,660
And is that asshole
going as the pageboy?

511
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:33,861
I don't like...

512
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,540
...your attitude.

513
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,020
Listen carefully. I am
sacrificing eternal life...

514
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:40,581
...to fool the Devil...

515
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,901
...and to kill the Antichrist!

516
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:45,140
Great! Kidnapped by a saint!

517
00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:47,660
Quite the opposite.

518
00:36:47,861 --> 00:36:50,301
I'll take every chance
to commit evil.

519
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:52,341
The Devil will trust me.

520
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:01,501
The first thing...

521
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,621
...is to draw...

522
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,861
...the pentacle.

523
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:10,101
It's in the middle pages.

524
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,981
A circle with symbols.

525
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:15,901
You must draw it on the floor,
and then we stand inside it.

526
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,941
- So the Devil can't pass it.
- That's right.

527
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:20,461
What else?

528
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:23,581
Be patient! There are
lots of things to remember!

529
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:25,621
Calm down.
You know what's vital.

530
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:28,021
A sword.

531
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:31,741
A sacred sword, or a large knife.
It's like a magic wand.

532
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:33,901
There'll be one in the kitchen.

533
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:38,421
What else?

534
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:42,021
An Amanita muscaria.

535
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:45,421
A mushroom? What for?
Are you trying to fool me?

536
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:50,501
No, mushrooms are psychotropics.
You know, like drugs.

537
00:37:51,782 --> 00:37:55,461
Yeah, I've tried those.
It's like a kind of acid,...

538
00:37:55,661 --> 00:37:56,621
...like LSD.

539
00:37:57,701 --> 00:37:59,062
I have some here.

540
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,101
It isn't for me, father.

541
00:38:02,301 --> 00:38:04,822
Some pals of mine
are having a party.

542
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:06,621
Got the lucky gloves?

543
00:38:11,861 --> 00:38:13,142
Yeah, this is it.

544
00:38:16,182 --> 00:38:17,061
Will it do?

545
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:21,181
This is absurd!

546
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,342
Don't you see that this is
just a farce for assholes?

547
00:38:25,662 --> 00:38:28,422
Assholes who watch my program
and buy my book!

548
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:31,142
- That's the truth!
- Are we back to that?

549
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:35,301
You think that I enjoy this?

550
00:38:37,062 --> 00:38:39,022
That I like using violence?

551
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:44,422
I have no other choice.
It's the only solution.

552
00:38:44,862 --> 00:38:46,261
You should collaborate.

553
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,742
We need...

554
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:51,422
...a goblet,
with four consecrated hosts,...

555
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:54,901
...anointed with
a maiden's blood.

556
00:38:56,782 --> 00:38:58,422
Got any maiden's blood?

557
00:38:58,862 --> 00:39:00,742
- That isn't in the book.
- I know.

558
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:03,502
Not everything is.
That's why you need me.

559
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:06,422
Look, without the maiden's
blood,...

560
00:39:06,622 --> 00:39:08,862
...the invocation
will be of no use!

561
00:39:09,062 --> 00:39:11,182
I think it's time
to forget it!

562
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:25,822
Excuse me.

563
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:27,822
I've made a mistake.

564
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:29,983
Susana! Run!

565
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:31,702
Get away! He's crazy!

566
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:17,342
Darling!

567
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:19,303
What are you doing?

568
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:29,863
What happened?

569
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:32,423
- She fell down the stairs.
- My God!

570
00:40:32,623 --> 00:40:35,583
It should have been deliberate
but it was an accident.

571
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:42,543
Christ! What a dame, father!
How did you do it?

572
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:45,943
I could only find
sliced bread...

573
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:48,663
...but I cut some
of the symbols on it.

574
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,824
Good, thank you.

575
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:55,023
You do the pentacle.
To what?

576
00:40:57,263 --> 00:41:00,063
- You said we needed some blood.
- Wait a minute!

577
00:41:01,183 --> 00:41:02,184
Now what is it?

578
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:04,423
- She's no use.
- Why is she no use?

579
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:07,183
She's no use.
She isn't a maiden.

580
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:09,704
She isn't a virgin.
Her blood is no use.

581
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:12,424
Sure she isn't a virgin?

582
00:41:13,384 --> 00:41:15,184
Absolutely. I swear it.

583
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,823
And you need a virgin's blood.

584
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:20,264
Otherwise, it's no good,
I told you.

585
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,143
You're right.

586
00:41:24,183 --> 00:41:27,743
Jose Maria, finish the pentacle.
I'll be out for an hour.

587
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,824
- Where are you going?
- To find some blood.

588
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:34,703
You think you can find
a virgin in one hour?

589
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:37,144
Yes.

590
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:39,864
With God's help.

591
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:44,944
"Christmas Eve is coming,
Christmas Eve is going.

592
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:48,624
We are going too
and we won't be back again. "

593
00:41:54,784 --> 00:41:55,984
You're soaked!

594
00:41:56,624 --> 00:41:57,584
It's raining.

595
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,184
- Will I fix you something hot?
- No, no, no.

596
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:06,024
Well, yes. A coffee.

597
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:23,824
"The Virgin is combing
her hair,...

598
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:26,144
...in amongst the veils... "

599
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:28,104
- Are you alone?
- No way!

600
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:30,664
Madam is asleep,
nothing will waken her.

601
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:32,904
So I have to prepare
everything.

602
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,665
- Is there a celebration?
- Christmas Eve.

603
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:40,024
Of course, Christmas Eve!
What was I thinking of?

604
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:42,464
- Won't you have something?
- No, I won't.

605
00:42:43,385 --> 00:42:45,985
You could have some tea,
or camomile.

606
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:49,664
I just had some, and anyway,
I have to fix the salad.

607
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:51,905
I won't insist
if that's how it is.

608
00:42:52,185 --> 00:42:53,904
All right then, I will.

609
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:57,864
Are you staying for dinner?
We have some lovely rabbit.

610
00:42:58,065 --> 00:42:59,184
Rabbit? That's nice!

611
00:42:59,784 --> 00:43:02,865
But I can't, I'm in a hurry.
I have to go out again.

612
00:43:09,384 --> 00:43:11,824
- May I ask you a question?
- What is it?

613
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:13,705
Are you a virgin?

614
00:43:14,704 --> 00:43:16,504
- What?
- Are you a virgin?

615
00:43:18,785 --> 00:43:20,464
Don't worry, I'm a priest.

616
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:23,265
I'm asking like I was
your father or mother.

617
00:43:23,464 --> 00:43:26,344
No, no, I don't mind.
It's just that...

618
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:28,585
...I wasn't expecting it.

619
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:30,905
You took me by surprise.

620
00:43:31,185 --> 00:43:33,945
- You don't have to answer.
- I don't mind!

621
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:35,544
- Mmm...
- What?

622
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:36,705
Yes, I am.

623
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:38,425
Until I get married,...

624
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:40,305
...nothing doing.

625
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:42,265
That's very good, child.

626
00:43:44,945 --> 00:43:46,585
Was Madam behind this?

627
00:43:47,385 --> 00:43:50,625
- If she thinks her son and I...
- No, I just wondered.

628
00:43:50,825 --> 00:43:52,545
He's never touched me!

629
00:43:52,745 --> 00:43:55,745
He's a drug addict,
he's a pig, and he's fat!

630
00:43:56,025 --> 00:43:57,665
I don't know what to do.

631
00:43:58,185 --> 00:44:01,905
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
He won't bother you again.

632
00:44:02,145 --> 00:44:04,746
- Really?
- Yes. I'm here to help others.

633
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:07,945
Have your coffee.

634
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,506
- I don't feel like it.
- Have it at once!

635
00:44:12,185 --> 00:44:13,185
I'm a bit edgy.

636
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:19,985
I get edgy and...

637
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:25,546
- I'm very edgy, that's all.
- I can see that. What's wrong?

638
00:44:25,745 --> 00:44:27,545
- It's very serious.
- What is?

639
00:44:27,746 --> 00:44:30,745
I can't explain it all now,
there isn't time.

640
00:44:30,946 --> 00:44:32,785
- I need your blood.
- What?

641
00:44:34,186 --> 00:44:36,826
Not all of it.
Just a little bottle.

642
00:44:38,265 --> 00:44:41,026
Why do you want my blood?
For a transfusion?

643
00:44:41,226 --> 00:44:44,346
No, for an invocation.
I have to invoke the devil.

644
00:44:44,545 --> 00:44:45,905
This will sound odd,...

645
00:44:46,106 --> 00:44:48,505
...but we had a girl
who wasn't a virgin,...

646
00:44:48,706 --> 00:44:51,425
...and as it seems
we must have a virgin...

647
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:52,946
...I thought of you.

648
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:56,786
No, I don't want to.
I don't like the idea, really.

649
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,746
Look, you needn't worry.

650
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:00,946
It's a real emergency.

651
00:45:01,425 --> 00:45:02,385
Keep away!

652
00:45:03,386 --> 00:45:06,586
Now, don't be like that.
It'll only take a moment.

653
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:11,946
Look, we can do it with this
and no one will ever know.

654
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:14,106
- I'll stick this in you!
- Look...

655
00:45:41,707 --> 00:45:42,667
Mina!

656
00:45:45,186 --> 00:45:46,146
Mina!

657
00:45:52,186 --> 00:45:53,227
Where are you?

658
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:57,187
Mina! That girl!

659
00:45:58,386 --> 00:45:59,146
Yes?

660
00:45:59,346 --> 00:46:00,426
- is Tere there?
- What?

661
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,866
- is that the whore house?
- No, it isn't.

662
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:05,346
You've made a mistake.

663
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:08,987
You want the house opposite.

664
00:46:10,026 --> 00:46:13,507
The whores are over there!
People come here to sleep!

665
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:15,947
I'll call the police.

666
00:46:20,387 --> 00:46:21,666
Mina! Where are you?

667
00:46:22,626 --> 00:46:24,587
Mina! Are you asleep?

668
00:46:25,187 --> 00:46:26,667
Where the hell are you?

669
00:46:28,106 --> 00:46:29,547
Mina! Is that you?

670
00:46:31,386 --> 00:46:32,467
No, it's me.

671
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:34,627
Excuse me, father.

672
00:46:35,386 --> 00:46:36,547
I can't find Mina.

673
00:46:36,746 --> 00:46:38,347
Do you know where she is?

674
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:41,827
I've been in here for ages,
I've seen nothing.

675
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:47,627
Are you ill?

676
00:46:47,827 --> 00:46:50,667
No, I'm perfectly well,
thank you.

677
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,627
Why is the light off?

678
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:57,067
The light!

679
00:46:57,587 --> 00:46:58,787
That's much better.

680
00:46:59,787 --> 00:47:01,147
Don't worry about me.

681
00:47:02,387 --> 00:47:03,587
It was the rabbit...

682
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:39,827
- Police?
- This is police headquarters.

683
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:43,587
- There's a murderer in my house.
- Name, address and I.D. number?

684
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:45,867
What? What did you say?

685
00:47:46,268 --> 00:47:48,948
Give me your name,
address and I.D. number.

686
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,267
Hello? Hello?

687
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:34,348
Murderer!

688
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:46,509
What are you doing?

689
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,349
You don't have to fuck up
the floor!

690
00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:52,629
The book says you must do it
with the magic knife.

691
00:49:52,829 --> 00:49:54,989
I put that in
for the sake of it.

692
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:58,149
Fuck you!
You shouldn't have put it!

693
00:50:01,189 --> 00:50:03,949
All you TV people
are real fuckers!

694
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:06,469
You're always
laughing at people!

695
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:11,069
- You're in real trouble.
- Who, me?

696
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,469
Yes, you.

697
00:50:12,669 --> 00:50:13,189
Why?

698
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,749
This is a kidnapping,
and that woman...

699
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:17,909
...may be dead.

700
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,789
You could go down
for a few years.

701
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:24,149
You're aiding a psychopath,
a dangerous madman!

702
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:26,589
Who knows what
he's up to now?

703
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:28,909
All I'm doing
is drawing something.

704
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,509
But you're helping him.
You're helping...

705
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:32,669
...a murderer.

706
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:34,430
Listen to me!

707
00:50:34,989 --> 00:50:37,109
Can you hear me?
Untie me!

708
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:38,709
Lunatic!

709
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,109
Do you want money?

710
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,789
- Say something!
- That'll be the cops again.

711
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,630
Damn the bastard!

712
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:51,589
Fuck it!

713
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:54,990
That fucking tow truck!
For Chrissake!

714
00:51:24,509 --> 00:51:26,350
- What's up?
- I'm sorry.

715
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,110
- Where's my car?
- We waited for ages.

716
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:31,190
Then we called the tow truck.

717
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:34,870
Some friends are expecting us
at a party and...

718
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,589
Susana!

719
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,310
What's going on?

720
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:46,710
Untie me! Hurry!

721
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:47,990
He's coming back!

722
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,910
- What happened?
- Untie me! Get the knife!

723
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,750
Hurry!

724
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:55,710
Are you in trouble?

725
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,951
Come on, hurry up!

726
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,070
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police!

727
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,670
There's no time.
Get the fucking knife!

728
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,750
Sorry!

729
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:10,151
Good evening!

730
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,311
Now, don't panic!

731
00:52:16,871 --> 00:52:17,831
Careful!

732
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,270
He's coming! Hurry up!

733
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,671
Forget about that! Hide!

734
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,351
She's gone.
She went to call the police!

735
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:34,910
Get out, Susana!

736
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:40,871
Run, Susana!

737
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:24,751
I brought this.

738
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:26,512
Will it help?

739
00:54:28,112 --> 00:54:29,512
A tape? What's it for?

740
00:54:31,392 --> 00:54:32,952
You know, demonic music.

741
00:54:34,032 --> 00:54:36,032
Heavy? You want to play heavy?

742
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:38,632
It's Death Metal.
It isn't the same.

743
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,112
Sattanica. They're very good.

744
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:43,632
- Right.
- It's a form of invocation.

745
00:54:44,272 --> 00:54:46,271
Some have to be played
backwards.

746
00:54:46,472 --> 00:54:49,912
Look, do whatever you want.
Listen to it backwards.

747
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,912
Play heavy if you want,
but I'd rather you didn't.

748
00:54:53,392 --> 00:54:54,592
You're the expert.

749
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:57,232
Thank you.
Is everything ready?

750
00:54:57,632 --> 00:54:59,712
Knife, bread, LSD,
immaculate blood.

751
00:54:59,912 --> 00:55:00,992
In under an hour!

752
00:55:02,392 --> 00:55:05,112
Let's get started, please.
And in silence.

753
00:55:07,793 --> 00:55:08,753
Read this.

754
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:12,033
Out loud.
It's your pact with the Devil.

755
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:15,832
"My lord and master Satan,...

756
00:55:16,392 --> 00:55:20,072
...I recognize you as my God
and promise to serve you.

757
00:55:20,393 --> 00:55:22,272
I now renounce Jesus Christ.

758
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:25,232
I promise to adore you
every day,...

759
00:55:25,432 --> 00:55:27,352
...to do all the evil
I can,...

760
00:55:27,552 --> 00:55:30,352
...and to draw as many
as I can to do evil.

761
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:33,833
I surrender to you my body,
my soul and my life,...

762
00:55:34,032 --> 00:55:35,992
...dedicated to you
for ever,...

763
00:55:36,193 --> 00:55:38,312
...with no intention
of repentance. "

764
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:42,112
That's it.

765
00:55:42,313 --> 00:55:44,793
- Now, sign it with your blood.
- Heavy!

766
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,513
And now?

767
00:55:57,713 --> 00:55:58,673
Burn it.

768
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:07,673
Now what?

769
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:10,153
Nothing. That's all.

770
00:56:12,753 --> 00:56:14,913
What did you expect?
Are you convinced?

771
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:17,833
- Nothing's happening.
- Of course not.

772
00:56:18,032 --> 00:56:19,913
This is just messing around.

773
00:56:20,193 --> 00:56:22,152
I told you. The Devil!

774
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,233
It's incredible!

775
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:27,393
Be quiet!

776
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,033
Will we try the music?

777
00:56:29,273 --> 00:56:31,593
No, we won't.
We're going to wait.

778
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:39,353
Christ!

779
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:56,633
You see? It was scared off!

780
00:56:57,394 --> 00:56:59,353
It couldn't cross
the pentacle!

781
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:46,354
My God!

782
00:57:49,194 --> 00:57:51,154
Have they gone?
What happened?

783
00:57:52,394 --> 00:57:53,994
Nothing, it's all right.

784
00:57:54,394 --> 00:57:58,194
- It's better if you go home.
- What? And leave you here?

785
00:57:58,394 --> 00:58:00,674
Go home
and I'll call you later.

786
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,754
They almost killed us,
and you want to stay here!

787
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:06,714
What's wrong with you?

788
00:58:06,914 --> 00:58:09,634
I'm perfectly all right.
Nothing happened.

789
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:11,674
Now, come on. Let's go.

790
00:58:13,234 --> 00:58:15,914
Don't worry,
I'll call you tomorrow.

791
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:18,394
Nothing's wrong.
We'll talk tomorrow.

792
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:31,794
There are hundreds
of combinations.

793
00:58:31,994 --> 00:58:34,794
Thousands of millions.
There are 15 letters.

794
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:38,354
A permutation of 15 elements
with three repeated twice,...

795
00:58:38,554 --> 00:58:41,075
...and two, three times,
giving us a total of...

796
00:58:41,274 --> 00:58:44,594
...4,540,536,000 possibilities.

797
00:58:45,074 --> 00:58:48,274
My head's spinning. I think
none of them makes sense.

798
00:58:48,475 --> 00:58:51,235
- Almost none.
- We use all the letters?

799
00:58:51,434 --> 00:58:52,995
- Yes.
- That's it.

800
00:58:55,995 --> 00:58:57,474
This is not a game.

801
00:58:57,675 --> 00:58:58,635
Holy God!

802
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:05,394
Don't answer.

803
00:59:05,674 --> 00:59:06,875
It might be Susana.

804
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:08,394
It isn't Susana.

805
00:59:09,074 --> 00:59:10,275
I can't help it!

806
00:59:11,075 --> 00:59:13,035
- Is there another way out?
- No.

807
00:59:14,154 --> 00:59:15,755
We must get out of here!

808
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:18,035
Come on!

809
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:20,635
Follow me!
Don't just sit there!

810
00:59:21,154 --> 00:59:22,195
Come on! Hurry!

811
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:27,194
- It's him. He's come for us!
- The window!

812
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:30,235
This way.

813
00:59:32,275 --> 00:59:33,475
We're going to die!

814
00:59:33,675 --> 00:59:35,995
- Stop laughing!
- This is very high!

815
00:59:37,075 --> 00:59:40,035
Don't push. We have
to hold on to the bars.

816
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:42,875
- Hurry!
- Don't push me! I'll fall!

817
00:59:45,155 --> 00:59:46,275
Don't look down!

818
00:59:49,075 --> 00:59:50,035
Be careful!

819
00:59:58,675 --> 00:59:59,635
Be careful!

820
01:00:00,675 --> 01:00:01,715
Take it slowly.

821
01:00:04,275 --> 01:00:05,475
We're at the top.

822
01:00:05,716 --> 01:00:07,275
Only six more letters!

823
01:00:07,595 --> 01:00:09,475
- Just as well!
- Wait for me!

824
01:00:10,555 --> 01:00:11,515
Cool it, father.

825
01:00:11,715 --> 01:00:12,836
We'll wait for you.

826
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,235
Don't crowd me!

827
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,595
What are you doing?

828
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:21,955
- Be careful!
- Cool it, man.

829
01:00:23,755 --> 01:00:24,955
Fuck, this is high!

830
01:00:25,395 --> 01:00:26,836
Look up here, folks!

831
01:00:27,435 --> 01:00:28,795
Be careful, you fool!

832
01:00:31,675 --> 01:00:32,635
I can't stop!

833
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:36,156
I can't stop!
We're so high up!

834
01:00:44,155 --> 01:00:45,635
- Don't look down!
- Look!

835
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:46,635
Shut up!

836
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:48,156
You'll knock us off!

837
01:00:48,515 --> 01:00:49,876
Hey, cool it, man.

838
01:00:50,276 --> 01:00:51,236
Going down!

839
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:55,716
I'm going to kill myself!

840
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:58,036
Fucking great!

841
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,076
Let go of me!

842
01:01:04,276 --> 01:01:05,716
- Let go!
- Climb up!

843
01:01:06,075 --> 01:01:09,556
Now, be careful. We're going
to move down bit by bit.

844
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:12,756
- He isn't thinking straight.
- Am I not?

845
01:01:13,276 --> 01:01:15,396
What if I jump off right now?

846
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:17,036
Stop talking rubbish!

847
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:18,996
We'll all be fucked!

848
01:01:22,356 --> 01:01:25,036
We're going down!
We're going down!

849
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:31,276
Look, father!
Look, I'm flying!

850
01:01:31,836 --> 01:01:33,596
Like the angels!

851
01:01:57,276 --> 01:01:58,236
My God!

852
01:02:03,077 --> 01:02:04,156
Don't let go of me!

853
01:02:04,676 --> 01:02:06,557
Don't let go of me!

854
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:55,877
Santa Claus!

855
01:02:56,077 --> 01:02:57,837
Santa Claus is in the house!

856
01:02:58,317 --> 01:02:59,837
Mom! Dad! Come here!

857
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:02,957
Santa Claus has come in
through the window!

858
01:03:04,077 --> 01:03:04,357
Are you ready, love?

859
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:07,477
Let's see Santa Claus.

860
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:14,797
- Happy Christmas.
- Good-bye.

861
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:02,518
And so ended
the attempted kidnapping...

862
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:03,758
...of Ennio Lombardi,...

863
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:05,998
...better known as
Professor Cavan...

864
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:07,957
...from "The Dark Zone"...

865
01:04:08,158 --> 01:04:10,198
...shown on this station.

866
01:04:11,078 --> 01:04:13,478
The motive for the kidnapping
is unknown,...

867
01:04:13,678 --> 01:04:16,718
...and those responsible,
as yet unidentified,...

868
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:18,358
I've just heard the news!

869
01:04:18,558 --> 01:04:20,758
I rang the hospitai
but you'd gone!

870
01:04:21,998 --> 01:04:24,558
How are you?
Will I get you a chair?

871
01:04:24,758 --> 01:04:27,638
- Do they know where they are?
- We have no idea!

872
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:28,798
Just as well.

873
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:31,638
You should be in hospital.
How are you?

874
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:34,478
Leave me be! I want to talk
to the TV guy!

875
01:04:34,678 --> 01:04:36,558
- Why?
- We're on in two hours.

876
01:04:36,758 --> 01:04:37,878
- What?
- A special program.

877
01:04:38,078 --> 01:04:40,718
And we stop
the Christmas programs?

878
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,638
I think you must be in shock!

879
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,918
That is absoiutely impossible!

880
01:04:46,118 --> 01:04:47,398
What you asked for...

881
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:49,878
This? This is garbage! Shit!

882
01:04:50,078 --> 01:04:52,239
it's all they could find
in Madrid!

883
01:04:52,438 --> 01:04:53,879
There must be more!

884
01:04:54,078 --> 01:04:56,398
Have you checked
the program on sects?

885
01:04:57,078 --> 01:04:59,398
That's true!
What about the sects?

886
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:03,438
Very well.

887
01:05:03,879 --> 01:05:06,398
If that's all there is,
you're fired.

888
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:09,718
It would be easier if we knew
what we were looking for.

889
01:05:09,919 --> 01:05:11,439
Don't you fucking listen?

890
01:05:12,078 --> 01:05:13,038
I told you!

891
01:05:13,759 --> 01:05:15,758
A place, a fucking site!

892
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:17,238
I don't know.

893
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,199
A building, a square, gardens.

894
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:23,278
The place where Satanists meet
here in Madrid!

895
01:05:23,678 --> 01:05:27,238
But don't bring me another boy
possessed by the Devil!

896
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:30,799
But we only had an hour.
We didn't even have any dinner.

897
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:32,559
We need time.

898
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:36,438
If I don't get it by tonight,
you can shove your dinner!

899
01:05:38,078 --> 01:05:39,038
Ennio, wait!

900
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:40,319
We can't wait.

901
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,119
- Calm down!
- We can't wait!

902
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,079
Mr. Cavan, your autograph?

903
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:51,159
Is someone going to clean this,
or do you expect me to do it?

904
01:05:51,439 --> 01:05:53,079
Ennio! Ennio!

905
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:54,479
Mr. Cavan...

906
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,479
Can you leave that for later?
We're trying to work.

907
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:05,559
- How are you?
- What the fuck are you doing?

908
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:08,239
Excuse me, happy Christmas.

909
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:10,039
Can't you see we're busy?

910
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:14,319
I'm glad that you're better.
Will you sign your book for me?

911
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:16,799
My wife and kids
love your program.

912
01:06:16,999 --> 01:06:20,959
This book is shit. A fraud.
Tell your wife and kids that.

913
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:23,639
- Fuck!
- What?

914
01:06:23,919 --> 01:06:25,640
- I've lost my pen.
- Use this.

915
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,319
You're a genius!

916
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:29,080
We'll slay them tonight!

917
01:06:29,279 --> 01:06:32,240
Everyone else has carols
and we have the Devil!

918
01:06:32,439 --> 01:06:34,239
We'll have to do a re-run.

919
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,439
- Your wife's name?
- Mari-Angeles.

920
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:40,359
Dump the program.

921
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:41,000
What?

922
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:42,640
Forget the program!

923
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,079
Are you crazy? Why have you
sent everyone to look for...

924
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,759
...the Devil's temple?

925
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,400
The Antichrist
will be born tonight.

926
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:52,319
What?

927
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,839
Shut up.
Here you are.

928
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,640
Thank you.

929
01:06:55,999 --> 01:06:59,039
I got a fright when I saw you
on the News, climbing...

930
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,840
Why don't you fuck off?

931
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,239
Wait a minute! The book...

932
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,840
Thank you.

933
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,159
What is it, Cavan?
Aren't we paying you enough?

934
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:16,559
Do you want to be fired
and go to another channel?

935
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,360
Are you trying to annoy me
so we'll throw you out?

936
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,080
You hurt my eye!

937
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:28,120
What are you looking at?

938
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,320
in all the time...

939
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,920
...we've worked together,
you've never listened to me!

940
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,080
You know that?

941
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,840
Keep moving.

942
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,640
Keep moving, don't stop.
Keep moving.

943
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,600
We're stuck.
The cops are all over.

944
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,040
Time is running out.
It'll be dawn in a few hours.

945
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,640
We won't last five minutes
out there.

946
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,001
What will we do?

947
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:08,200
We must be very close by now.
If only there was a...

948
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:10,360
What? What do you want?

949
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:12,040
A sign. We need a sign.

950
01:08:13,161 --> 01:08:14,121
Fuck!

951
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,361
NEW ATHENAEUM

952
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:33,240
Have science and technology
left it meaningless?

953
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,521
The answer is no.

954
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:37,240
The First World War,...

955
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,841
...Hitler's rise to power,...

956
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,841
...or Russia's conversion...

957
01:08:41,401 --> 01:08:42,761
...are pure facts.

958
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:46,280
Proof of the clairvoyant power
of Michel de Nostradamus...

959
01:08:46,481 --> 01:08:49,440
...the great futurologist,
scorned by science,...

960
01:08:49,641 --> 01:08:52,521
...but praised by experts
who studied his work.

961
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,080
Those who discovered...

962
01:08:54,281 --> 01:08:55,561
A neat place, father!

963
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:58,480
We can stay here
until it all cools down.

964
01:08:58,681 --> 01:09:01,801
The most important thing
about Nostradamus was his...

965
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:03,361
Why didn't I realize?

966
01:09:04,001 --> 01:09:05,001
It will be here!

967
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,881
...thus showing us
humanity's future.

968
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:11,321
- What is humanity's future?
- What are you doing?

969
01:09:11,521 --> 01:09:14,321
Well, that is the subject
of this talk.

970
01:09:14,921 --> 01:09:18,161
We shall try to analyze
the work of Nostradamus...

971
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:19,681
...from a perspective...

972
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:22,001
The Antichrist
will be born tonight.

973
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:23,161
Let's see.

974
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:26,241
As anyone who has studied
the subject knows,...

975
01:09:26,442 --> 01:09:29,681
...Nostradamus never talks
about a specific date,...

976
01:09:29,881 --> 01:09:32,041
...but about
the Third World War,...

977
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:33,881
.. and when the Antipope...

978
01:09:34,081 --> 01:09:36,881
Nostradamus has nothing to do
with all this.

979
01:09:37,081 --> 01:09:39,202
- If you have a question...
- Yes.

980
01:09:39,401 --> 01:09:40,282
I have one.

981
01:09:40,481 --> 01:09:41,642
Afterwards, please.

982
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:44,641
- It'll be here, won't it?
- We'll be thrown out.

983
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:45,922
Why not admit it?

984
01:09:46,322 --> 01:09:49,202
It's going to be here, I know.
Answer me.

985
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:51,761
After this talk
we'll have questions.

986
01:09:53,081 --> 01:09:55,121
Don't try to fool me, too.

987
01:09:55,321 --> 01:09:57,282
Listen, I am one of you.

988
01:09:57,481 --> 01:10:01,402
You must believe I'm with you.
I sold my soul to the Evil One.

989
01:10:01,601 --> 01:10:03,162
Will you please sit down?

990
01:10:03,442 --> 01:10:05,522
Trust in me! Trust in me!

991
01:10:06,281 --> 01:10:07,241
Just sit down!

992
01:10:07,682 --> 01:10:09,362
Father, come on! Let's go!

993
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,522
I signed with my blood.

994
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:14,042
We're asking you politely.
Get out!

995
01:10:14,522 --> 01:10:15,482
What's wrong?

996
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:19,042
- Why? What's wrong?
- Father, let's go!

997
01:10:27,282 --> 01:10:28,922
Wait! Listen!

998
01:10:37,082 --> 01:10:38,842
Wait! Listen!

999
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,242
Wait!

1000
01:10:53,722 --> 01:10:54,682
What is this?

1001
01:11:06,282 --> 01:11:07,842
Attention, children.

1002
01:11:08,282 --> 01:11:10,802
On the junior floor
of our store...

1003
01:11:11,002 --> 01:11:14,243
...you'll find all the toys
you requested for Christmas.

1004
01:11:14,442 --> 01:11:16,642
And the Three Wise Men
are here...

1005
01:11:16,843 --> 01:11:19,603
...to get your letters.
Happy Christmas!

1006
01:11:32,723 --> 01:11:33,683
There he is!

1007
01:12:09,282 --> 01:12:10,843
Excuse me, you can't...

1008
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:17,443
Stop, you bastard!
Get in, father!

1009
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:25,163
Hurry up! Start the car!
Get us out of here, fast!

1010
01:12:27,683 --> 01:12:28,883
Where are we going?

1011
01:12:29,283 --> 01:12:30,523
We're losing them.

1012
01:12:32,803 --> 01:12:34,043
Where are we going?

1013
01:12:34,723 --> 01:12:38,163
- We have to go back.
- How can we? It's full of cops.

1014
01:12:38,363 --> 01:12:41,283
I must speak to him.
He can't have gone far.

1015
01:12:41,484 --> 01:12:44,243
That speaker?
He's in Buenos Aires by now.

1016
01:12:44,764 --> 01:12:46,284
What are you looking at?

1017
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,844
There he is! There he is!

1018
01:12:50,043 --> 01:12:52,363
- Stop the car!
- What are you talking about?

1019
01:12:52,563 --> 01:12:54,123
- Be careful!
- It's him!

1020
01:12:55,243 --> 01:12:56,284
Stop the car!

1021
01:12:57,043 --> 01:12:58,163
Stop the car!

1022
01:13:06,123 --> 01:13:07,163
Listen!

1023
01:13:08,324 --> 01:13:09,284
Listen!

1024
01:13:11,043 --> 01:13:12,003
Wait!

1025
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:13,603
Wait!

1026
01:13:15,123 --> 01:13:17,043
Tell me where he'll be born!

1027
01:13:17,443 --> 01:13:18,403
Where?

1028
01:13:19,123 --> 01:13:20,844
What did I do? Let me go!

1029
01:13:21,124 --> 01:13:22,683
Where will the birth be?

1030
01:13:22,884 --> 01:13:24,924
Come on!
We haven't got all night!

1031
01:13:25,123 --> 01:13:27,364
- What are you talking about?
- Come on!

1032
01:13:28,563 --> 01:13:29,604
Will I kill him?

1033
01:13:30,124 --> 01:13:32,324
But I...
I've never hurt anyone!

1034
01:13:32,523 --> 01:13:35,163
All I do is give talks!
I swear, that's all!

1035
01:13:35,364 --> 01:13:36,444
Leave me alone!

1036
01:13:36,643 --> 01:13:38,684
Don't hurt me, for God's sake!
Please!

1037
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,203
He knows nothing.

1038
01:13:40,404 --> 01:13:41,524
Will I let him go?

1039
01:13:42,044 --> 01:13:43,004
Run, bastard!

1040
01:13:43,484 --> 01:13:45,084
Nostradamus! Big mouth!

1041
01:13:45,524 --> 01:13:47,844
And watch what you do!
I know your face!

1042
01:13:48,324 --> 01:13:49,284
Asshole!

1043
01:13:52,804 --> 01:13:55,684
Come on, get up!
We can't stay here!

1044
01:13:55,884 --> 01:13:58,084
- I'm so tired.
- We have to get a car!

1045
01:13:58,284 --> 01:14:00,644
- Why?
- So that we don't get caught!

1046
01:14:01,244 --> 01:14:03,324
It's no use.
He's playing with us.

1047
01:14:04,244 --> 01:14:05,124
Who?

1048
01:14:05,244 --> 01:14:09,124
The Devil. Don't you realize?
He's laughing at us.

1049
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:12,124
Yeah, I guess,
but we still have to move.

1050
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:14,884
There's something
I haven't told you.

1051
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:16,524
Tell me another day. We...

1052
01:14:16,724 --> 01:14:18,844
Your mother fell down
the stairs.

1053
01:14:19,044 --> 01:14:21,885
- What?
- Well, really, I pushed her.

1054
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:25,284
She tried to kill me,
when I went for the blood.

1055
01:14:25,725 --> 01:14:26,924
It was an accident.

1056
01:14:28,804 --> 01:14:31,244
- So the blood we used...
- Mina's.

1057
01:14:32,124 --> 01:14:34,964
- Is she dead too?
- I only gave her some pills.

1058
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:37,085
Heavy!

1059
01:14:38,124 --> 01:14:39,924
- So Mina was a virgin?
- Yes.

1060
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:41,044
How do you know?

1061
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:42,605
She told me.

1062
01:14:49,124 --> 01:14:51,004
Fuck the old lady, anyway.

1063
01:14:52,124 --> 01:14:53,724
But what will happen...

1064
01:14:53,925 --> 01:14:54,885
...to Grandad?

1065
01:14:55,644 --> 01:14:56,604
Go and see him.

1066
01:14:56,805 --> 01:14:58,964
Yeah, and leave you
alone here.

1067
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:01,284
- I can look after myself.
- Sure!

1068
01:15:01,724 --> 01:15:02,684
Some chance!

1069
01:15:03,925 --> 01:15:06,285
Look, you wait here
for five minutes,...

1070
01:15:06,484 --> 01:15:08,925
...and I'll come back
with a car.

1071
01:15:16,005 --> 01:15:19,485
AT LAST HEAVEN IS SENDING YOU
THE SIGNAL YOU WERE WAITING FOR.

1072
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:05,446
Clean up Madrid

1073
01:17:59,326 --> 01:18:01,126
- You're one of them.
- What?

1074
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,847
I know everything.

1075
01:18:03,046 --> 01:18:05,407
It'll be here.
Today is the Day of the Beast.

1076
01:18:05,607 --> 01:18:09,086
No, Satannica are on tonight.
You can check dates at the bar.

1077
01:18:13,326 --> 01:18:14,447
Stop shooting up!

1078
01:18:15,047 --> 01:18:16,007
That's enough!

1079
01:19:23,888 --> 01:19:24,848
Christ!

1080
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:26,967
What did they do to you?

1081
01:19:28,327 --> 01:19:29,287
Christ!

1082
01:19:29,968 --> 01:19:33,088
Shit! The bastards!
I shouldn't have left you.

1083
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:34,287
Shit!

1084
01:19:34,807 --> 01:19:36,248
Come on! Let's go!

1085
01:20:11,127 --> 01:20:13,047
I said I'd be five minutes.

1086
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:15,608
Couldn't you have waited?

1087
01:20:16,328 --> 01:20:17,288
Shit!

1088
01:20:22,328 --> 01:20:23,288
Here.

1089
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:30,168
Now what?

1090
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:34,088
His name is Angel Berriartua.

1091
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:38,129
He is a theology professor
at the University of Deusto.

1092
01:20:47,849 --> 01:20:49,568
- Hello?
- The Dark Zone.

1093
01:20:49,769 --> 01:20:50,729
- Hello?
- Yes?

1094
01:20:50,928 --> 01:20:52,288
Get me Professor Cavan.

1095
01:20:52,488 --> 01:20:55,648
Tell him that the priest
is here with me.

1096
01:20:55,848 --> 01:20:57,329
- What?
- He's right here.

1097
01:20:57,528 --> 01:20:58,488
Who are you?

1098
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:01,088
Say I'm the one
who fucked up his floor.

1099
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,568
Wait a moment.

1100
01:21:07,968 --> 01:21:09,608
- Yes? Hello?
- Cavan?

1101
01:21:09,929 --> 01:21:12,809
Cavan! This is Jose Mari.
Wait a minute.

1102
01:21:14,609 --> 01:21:17,729
Father! It's Cavan!
He's alive. He's on the TV.

1103
01:21:18,449 --> 01:21:21,409
He wants to talk to you.
He's been looking for you.

1104
01:21:22,328 --> 01:21:24,128
Come on, that's it.

1105
01:21:25,129 --> 01:21:26,168
Just a bit more.

1106
01:21:26,328 --> 01:21:29,569
Come on, take the phone.
Look, there he is.

1107
01:21:31,808 --> 01:21:32,768
is that you?

1108
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:35,088
I can see you in the shop.

1109
01:21:37,128 --> 01:21:38,928
- What are you doing?
- Trying to help.

1110
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:41,449
That's how you help?

1111
01:21:41,648 --> 01:21:44,609
The best way to find you
was by using the program.

1112
01:21:44,808 --> 01:21:45,768
Now, listen.

1113
01:21:46,728 --> 01:21:49,049
I'm on to something.
Where are you?

1114
01:21:49,249 --> 01:21:51,169
I don't know. In Hell.

1115
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,089
Please, listen to me!

1116
01:21:54,329 --> 01:21:56,289
I'm with you.
We have to talk!

1117
01:21:56,489 --> 01:21:58,409
I think I've found it.
You hear?

1118
01:21:59,889 --> 01:22:02,249
- May I ask a favor?
- Whatever you want.

1119
01:22:03,809 --> 01:22:04,769
Call the police.

1120
01:22:04,969 --> 01:22:05,889
What?

1121
01:22:06,529 --> 01:22:08,289
Tell them to come and get me.

1122
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:10,529
What is this?

1123
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:14,329
Do you think this is a trick?
That I'm in with the police?

1124
01:22:15,569 --> 01:22:17,209
Yes, I suppose so.

1125
01:22:17,409 --> 01:22:19,849
Listen to what
I'm going to say.

1126
01:22:22,129 --> 01:22:23,369
This is a warning...

1127
01:22:24,049 --> 01:22:27,809
...for the 10 million assholes
watching this fucking program!

1128
01:22:28,289 --> 01:22:30,450
The end of the world
is tonight!

1129
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:32,849
You understand?
This very night!

1130
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:36,129
Christmas Eve is fucked!
Christmas is fucked!

1131
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:37,330
it's all fucked!

1132
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:41,690
While you are in your homes
happily watching the TV,...

1133
01:22:41,889 --> 01:22:43,529
...outside on the streets,...

1134
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:46,129
...the Antichrist's reign
is beginning!

1135
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:51,209
I make my living
telling the future.

1136
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:52,889
So now you know.

1137
01:22:53,409 --> 01:22:55,410
is that what you wanted?

1138
01:22:55,609 --> 01:22:56,810
Are you listening?

1139
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:00,450
I've found the place
where he's going to be born!

1140
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:03,009
There is still time
before dawn.

1141
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:06,849
- I think I was mistaken.
- How? in the date?

1142
01:23:08,089 --> 01:23:09,890
- in everything.
- How do you mean?

1143
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:11,769
This is madness.

1144
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:15,090
- Maybe poor circulation.
- What?

1145
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:16,370
Maybe I'm mad.

1146
01:23:16,569 --> 01:23:19,130
The three of us saw
that thing in my house!

1147
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:20,770
You see what you want.

1148
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,610
I don't care if we're mad.

1149
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,770
Fuck! Can you hear me?

1150
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,770
Listen, I've found
the mark of the Devil!

1151
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:31,170
The mark of the Devil?

1152
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:32,450
He'll be cut off!

1153
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:34,250
Put in more money!

1154
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:38,490
I'm out of change.

1155
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,330
Tell me where you are!

1156
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:44,530
- Shit!
- We cut the transmission.

1157
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:46,850
You've screwed up the program!

1158
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:50,291
We interrupted everything
so you could find a madman!

1159
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:52,211
Then you go and lose him!

1160
01:23:52,891 --> 01:23:53,851
You!

1161
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:56,690
- What did he say?
- What?

1162
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:59,570
- When I asked where he was?
- I don't know.

1163
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:03,611
- If it isn't taped, you're dead!
- He said "I don't know"!

1164
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:05,890
What else?
After that, what else?

1165
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:07,451
I don't know. In Hell.

1166
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:09,771
What does it matter?
This is Hell!

1167
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:12,290
We have a minute
before we're back on.

1168
01:24:12,491 --> 01:24:14,650
Sit here and calm down.
Say anything.

1169
01:24:14,851 --> 01:24:18,490
Say it's the end of the world,
whatever you like, but say it!

1170
01:24:18,811 --> 01:24:22,371
Don't destroy me, Cavan.
The whole country is watching!

1171
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:27,890
- I need a newspaper.
- What the fuck for?

1172
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:34,051
Music Venue: Hell

1173
01:25:05,131 --> 01:25:06,091
Let's go!

1174
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:10,211
What's this?

1175
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:13,531
This is all you've got?

1176
01:25:14,211 --> 01:25:16,851
- They're photocopies.
- And the signatures?

1177
01:25:18,971 --> 01:25:19,931
Satan. So what?

1178
01:25:20,571 --> 01:25:23,171
It's the document we used
in the invocation.

1179
01:25:23,371 --> 01:25:24,532
Notice anything...

1180
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:26,211
...about the signature?

1181
01:25:28,051 --> 01:25:29,052
- Marks.
- Right.

1182
01:25:30,331 --> 01:25:32,811
Now look at the other
documents. You see?

1183
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:34,211
They're repeated.

1184
01:25:34,491 --> 01:25:38,011
In all the signed pacts
kept since the 15th Century.

1185
01:25:38,211 --> 01:25:39,171
The same mark.

1186
01:25:39,452 --> 01:25:41,652
- I still don't understand.
- Fuck it!

1187
01:25:41,851 --> 01:25:45,092
One hand made the signatures
through the centuries!

1188
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:47,371
That proves nothing.

1189
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:49,892
They were copied, that's all.

1190
01:25:50,131 --> 01:25:51,092
All right.

1191
01:25:51,331 --> 01:25:53,332
Jose Mari,
take the steering wheel!

1192
01:25:54,132 --> 01:25:55,252
Keep on driving.

1193
01:25:59,732 --> 01:26:02,092
All right,
they could be copies.

1194
01:26:04,132 --> 01:26:05,731
Now, look at this.

1195
01:26:07,491 --> 01:26:10,251
He's a boy we exorcised
on the program.

1196
01:26:10,452 --> 01:26:12,092
The one we saw in the bar.

1197
01:26:13,012 --> 01:26:15,652
Do you still not understand?
It's the mark...

1198
01:26:15,851 --> 01:26:18,092
...of the Devil!
Did the boy copy it?

1199
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:19,732
Look at the wounds!

1200
01:26:20,332 --> 01:26:21,532
It's the same sign!

1201
01:26:21,732 --> 01:26:24,452
The Devil does it
to his people with a claw.

1202
01:26:24,652 --> 01:26:25,932
His real signature.

1203
01:26:26,452 --> 01:26:27,412
Let me see.

1204
01:26:29,332 --> 01:26:30,492
Be careful!

1205
01:26:30,931 --> 01:26:32,132
What are you doing?

1206
01:26:32,732 --> 01:26:33,692
Stop the car!

1207
01:26:42,132 --> 01:26:43,292
You still don't see!

1208
01:26:45,332 --> 01:26:46,292
Listen.

1209
01:26:47,412 --> 01:26:50,652
- What is the sign of Christ?
- Just forget it, please.

1210
01:26:51,132 --> 01:26:53,612
Answer me!
What is the sign of Christ?

1211
01:26:53,812 --> 01:26:56,372
- The cross.
- Exactly. The cross.

1212
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:58,252
The cross.

1213
01:27:00,332 --> 01:27:03,293
- You're drawing it for me?
- And Christians...

1214
01:27:04,332 --> 01:27:07,052
Where do they celebrate
Christ's birth?

1215
01:27:07,253 --> 01:27:09,092
- In a church.
- In a church.

1216
01:27:09,332 --> 01:27:10,932
In a church.

1217
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:12,453
And...

1218
01:27:12,893 --> 01:27:14,572
...what is a church?

1219
01:27:14,972 --> 01:27:15,972
Come on!

1220
01:27:16,173 --> 01:27:16,853
Answer.

1221
01:27:17,052 --> 01:27:19,692
What is a church?
A cross, fuck it!

1222
01:27:19,893 --> 01:27:22,372
An enormous
three dimensional cross.

1223
01:27:22,572 --> 01:27:24,693
A cross with doors
and windows.

1224
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:26,613
You still don't see?

1225
01:27:27,332 --> 01:27:28,292
Look.

1226
01:27:28,732 --> 01:27:29,692
This...

1227
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:32,692
...is the Devil's mark.

1228
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:35,493
Remember?
You said it yourself.

1229
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:38,972
The Devil always tries
to imitate Christ.

1230
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:40,973
He's the dark side of God!

1231
01:27:41,332 --> 01:27:43,133
If God's temple is a cross,...

1232
01:27:43,973 --> 01:27:45,053
...Satan's temple...

1233
01:27:47,332 --> 01:27:48,732
...must be like this.

1234
01:27:51,573 --> 01:27:53,853
Well, you have it right there.

1235
01:29:28,734 --> 01:29:29,894
We've found it.

1236
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:32,693
You realize?

1237
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:34,934
A secret visible to all.

1238
01:29:35,654 --> 01:29:36,814
Just like you said...

1239
01:30:18,735 --> 01:30:20,734
- We must go down!
- What for?

1240
01:30:20,935 --> 01:30:22,414
They'll come up after us!

1241
01:30:22,614 --> 01:30:26,054
- But we mustn't fail now.
- Come on, you have to hide!

1242
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:30,494
Isn't he on the TV?

1243
01:30:30,694 --> 01:30:33,135
He's the bastard
who tells the future.

1244
01:30:33,334 --> 01:30:34,334
My wife loves him.

1245
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:35,895
Know what?

1246
01:30:36,734 --> 01:30:38,014
I foresee things too.

1247
01:30:38,694 --> 01:30:39,654
You doubt it?

1248
01:30:39,855 --> 01:30:41,095
Listen to this.

1249
01:30:41,414 --> 01:30:42,934
I see that very soon...

1250
01:30:43,135 --> 01:30:45,934
...you're going to have
a health problem.

1251
01:30:46,135 --> 01:30:47,334
Something permanent.

1252
01:30:47,655 --> 01:30:48,854
But first, a carol.

1253
01:30:49,975 --> 01:30:54,135
"On December 25,
boom, boom, boom!"

1254
01:32:33,776 --> 01:32:34,736
Get away!

1255
01:32:35,095 --> 01:32:36,416
Now, father! Quickly!

1256
01:32:36,976 --> 01:32:38,456
Go on! Get going!

1257
01:33:02,936 --> 01:33:05,096
- I think he's laughing.
- He's a joker.

1258
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:06,656
You think we're funny?

1259
01:33:07,616 --> 01:33:08,816
This is not a game.

1260
01:33:09,896 --> 01:33:11,656
Let's liven things up.

1261
01:33:50,657 --> 01:33:52,216
Clean up Madrid

1262
01:34:34,057 --> 01:34:37,217
Here he is, the investigator
of the occult.

1263
01:34:37,537 --> 01:34:39,897
He knows the present,
past and future.

1264
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:43,497
The internationally known
Professor Cavan!

1265
01:34:43,697 --> 01:34:44,657
Thank you.

1266
01:34:44,897 --> 01:34:47,617
Today we begin a new era
in "The Dark Zone".

1267
01:34:48,097 --> 01:34:49,857
After a nine month break,...

1268
01:34:50,057 --> 01:34:52,657
...we have returned
to arise from the ashes.

1269
01:34:53,097 --> 01:34:56,697
We will always remember
Ennio Lombardi,...

1270
01:34:56,897 --> 01:35:00,097
...the former presenter,
a great professional,...

1271
01:35:00,297 --> 01:35:03,257
...a great friend and
a brilliant communicator,...

1272
01:35:03,457 --> 01:35:06,257
...who disappeared in such
dramatic circumstance.

1273
01:35:06,897 --> 01:35:10,097
Wherever you are, my public
sends you this applause.

1274
01:35:11,578 --> 01:35:14,178
But let us now
turn to the future,...

1275
01:35:14,578 --> 01:35:17,137
...in that mysterious world
we explore...

1276
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:18,937
...in "The Dark Zone".

1277
01:35:21,897 --> 01:35:23,498
He's got no style.
He can't move.

1278
01:35:23,697 --> 01:35:26,098
We'll lose our audience
with that idiot.

1279
01:35:30,098 --> 01:35:33,378
What really fucks me about this
is that I can't tell anyone.

1280
01:35:33,577 --> 01:35:34,537
About what?

1281
01:35:34,858 --> 01:35:38,257
Fuck it! We saved the world
and nobody knows it!

1282
01:35:39,098 --> 01:35:41,298
They wouldn't understand.
Forget it.

1283
01:35:46,098 --> 01:35:47,738
A brilliant communicator!

1284
01:35:48,978 --> 01:35:49,938
What rubbish!

1285
01:35:54,618 --> 01:35:55,578
Come along.

1286
01:36:01,898 --> 01:36:02,858
Lean on me.
