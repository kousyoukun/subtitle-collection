Hey, lady,
fuck you.

172
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,158
In that case, put the
books on the counter.

173
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,027
Yeah, sure. Sure.

174

And don't you ever,
ever try to steal

Yeah.

Yes. thank you.

You're welcome.
Have a nice day.

Babe.

182
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,980
That's about
the most bizarre thing

183
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,915
I've ever seen,

184
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,986
and I was a cop
for 25 years.

185
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,922
Usually, the customer
holds the proprietor up.

186
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,190
That's how it's
supposed to work, Bernie.

187
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,192
They come in here,
they hold you up.

188
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,328
How'd you
get in here?

189
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,930
You left
the back door unlocked.

190
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,333
I couldn't have
gotten in otherwise

191
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,936
because I don't know
how to pick a lock.

192
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,938
You got a permit
for that gun?

I want $20,000

199

And I want a mink coat
for my wife.

200
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,422
I'm getting tired
of asking for that, Bernie.

201
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,358
Ray, at the end
of the week,

everything's
gonna be very cool.

203
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,694
I give you my word.

204
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,529
I don't think so.
Why not?

205

that takes stamps?

00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,414
Not my problem.
My problem

212
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,317
is waiting around for you
to get the job done.

213
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,786
Ray, I'm not gonna do
something that's stupid,

214
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:45,023
and I won't hit somebody
who doesn't have it coming.

for the most part.

See, I'm in a bit
of a fix.

222
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,053
You could fly
to New York.

I'm not sure
even then.

00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,069
because there's powder
in the gloves."

504
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,970
I didn't know this.
I leave these gloves there.

505
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,405
He picks them up,
he puts them downtown,

506
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,807
and all he has to do
is call somebody and say,

507
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:38,409
"i know where
these gloves are."

508
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,578
So I say, "ray,
what is it that you want?"

509
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,248
He says, "i want $20,000
and a mink coat for my wife,

510
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,415
and I want you
to get it."

511
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,650
That means
I'm pulling jobs again.

512
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,619
Tomorrow they're going
to haul my black ass

513
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:51,922
back to jail,
probably for murder now.

514
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:54,492
You got
any suggestions, Carl?

515
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,194
I don't know.

516
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,196
Maybe you could
go, like,

517
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,198
on the $25,000
pyramid,

518
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,134
you know,
get the money.

519
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,605
Carl, I think maybe
a better idea

520
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:11,609
is that you find yourself
a new best friend.

521
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:26,057
Cynthia on TV: I know good
dental care for your kids

522
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,226
is worth any price.

523
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,627
At the sheldrake clinic,

524
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,230
we make sure it's a price
you can afford.

525
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,232
In times like these,

526
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,435
you've got to ask yourself,
"why pay more?"

527
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:48,879
That's how we're used to
seeing Dr. Cynthia sheldrake,

528
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:50,281
but at 10:45 this morning,

529
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,351
she was taken into custody
on charges

530
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,254
of murdering her former husband
Christopher Marshall.

531
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,256
Marshall lived in this
fashionable area near Nob Hill.

532
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,258
His body was found early--

533
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,859
well, my darling.

534
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,261
Lunchtime, ray.

535
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,263
Is that right?

536
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,365
Hold it right there,
pickaninny.

537
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,867
How about our stamp?

538
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:13,104
Y'all want the stamp,
massa ray?

539
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,072
I get it for you
right now.

540
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:16,807
I don't want the stamp.

541
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:18,276
Bernie,
listen to me.

542
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,011
I don't want
the goddamn stamp.

543
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:23,314
I want the money you're gonna
get when you sell the stamp.

544
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,316
Then you know what
y'all got to do.

545
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,051
You got to
find us a buyer.

546
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,688
Or maybe you can mail
yourself to sun city

547
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:34,425
or wherever the fuck
retired policemans go.

548
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,793
Listen to me,
god damn it!

549
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:36,927
Get your hands
off me, ray.

550
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:39,364
Don't forget I was the state
prison boxing champ.

551
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,365
You're going
to get hurt.

552
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,469
Whoo!
boxing champion, huh?

553
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:48,005
As I recall, that was
a woman's prison.

554
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:50,007
I'm gonna slap
the shit--ow!

555
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:52,743
You don't listen,
that's your problem.

556
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:53,811
Bernie!

557
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,914
Oh, god!

558
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:58,349
Oh, god!

559
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,518
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

560
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,320
I told you.

561
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,522
Let's calm down
now, ok?

562
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,923
You bitch!

563
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:06,924
Ray--

564
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,793
you lousy bitch!

565
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,860
Ray!

566
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,933
That's it!
That's it!

567
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,735
I'm reopening the case!

568
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,804
You'll be the state prison
boxing champion again!

569
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:20,905
You hear me!

570
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,173
Look! give me
a break, ray.

571
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,341
A week!.

572
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,510
I'll get you
2 fur coats!

573
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,550
Damn it!

574
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,551
Damn it!

575
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:45,963
Hi.

576
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,532
Oh, god!

577
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,568
I'm sorry.
I was out of town.

578
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,936
Oh, Carson!

579
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,571
Look at me.

580
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,372
Don't.

581
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,374
Don't worry
about that.

582
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,442
This is like
a terrible nightmare.

583
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,710
You've got
to get me out of here.

584
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,479
Please, please,
get me out of here.

585
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,981
They fingerprinted me.

586
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,983
They undressed me.

587
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,985
I'm wearing
cotton underwear!

588
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:10,988
The kind that comes
up to here!

589
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,190
Sit down.
Come on, please.

590
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,499
Did my guy bates
do ok?

591
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,501
Well, he came. He just
said you were coming.

592
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,002
He didn't say anything.
Who is he?

593
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,671
A lawyer
in my firm.

594
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,905
He's a child.

595
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,407
He's 27.

596
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,408
And those pictures!

597
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,377
Those
dreadful pictures!

598
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,780
Who's going to see
those pictures?

599
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,783
Let me tell you what's
going on, all right?

600
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:42,152
They're going to keep you here
because they think

601
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:44,188
the murder weapon
came from your office.

602
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,690
It's some kind
of a dental tool.

603
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,825
I know all that.
Probable cause.

604
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,226
What is that?

605
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:52,062
It means the police think
that maybe--

606
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:53,764
no, how long?

607
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:55,966
They can only keep you
for 72 hours.

608
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:58,002
Well,
how long is that?

609
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,069
What?

610
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:00,938
How many days?

611
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,907
That's, uh...

612
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,174
It's, uh...

613
00:34:04,174 --> 00:34:05,910
Oh, Christ.

614
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,278
3 days.

615
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,380
3 days.

616
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,681
Jesus Christ!

617
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,650
I'm going to
die in here!

618
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,419
I'll choke
on my underwear!

619
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,853
Have you smelled
this place?

620
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,289
It's like a goddamn
clorox factory!

621
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,291
Cynthia,
listen to me, please.

622
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,293
You are not going
to die in here.

623
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,695
You didn't kill
Christopher, right?

624
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,697
Of course I didn't
kill him.

625
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:30,100
Then I'll get you out,
so don't worry, ok?

626
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,336
Huh!

627
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,272
Now, you told them
nothing, right?

628
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:36,707
No.

629
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,708
Good.

630
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,109
I mean no.

631
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:41,278
I did tell them
something.

632
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:42,680
What?

633
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,716
I told them
the other day

634
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,718
I was talking
to a patient of mine,

635
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,355
and I was telling her
how Christopher

636
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:51,722
just leaves
all this jewelry

637
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,024
all over the apartment
for anybody to steal.

638
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,895
A black woman, ok?

639
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,564
What are you saying?

640
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,967
That Christopher caught her
in the act, and she--

641
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,903
the police said
there was a burglary.

642
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,171
They did?

643
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,173
Mm-hmm. closet door
was broken into.

644
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,509
The alarm system
was tampered with.

645
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:15,846
I didn't know that.

646
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:16,714
Well, hell!

647
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,649
You're always
out of town!

648
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,151
What did the guy
call this?

649
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:22,753
An elevator.

650
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,355
Jeez.

651
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,425
You use this
to pull teeth out?

652
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,461
No wonder
they put you to sleep.

653
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,264
Hell of a murder weapon.
Just punch the guy.

654
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:37,802
What did you say
the address was again?

655
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,509
1143.

656
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,616
What's this?

657
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,851
It says here, "residence."

658
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:57,655
What do you think?
You want to go in?

659
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,603
What is this?

660
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,873
It says here,
"place of business."

661
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:19,677
What do you think?
You want to go in?

662
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,515
What are you doing?

663
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,386
What are you doing?

664
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:30,888
I'm gonna call

The police, even
if they were idiots,

755

to use a dental instrument

in the commission of a murder
would be a dentist.

You, on the other hand, were
in Dr. sheldrake's office

764
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,899
Did you see
or hear who did it?

765
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,367
Tell me. I would
really like to know.

766
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,037
You tell the doctor
to keep her mouth shut.

767
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,404
I'm afraid it's
a little late for that.

768
00:44:34,404 --> 00:44:36,506
Then you tell her
if they pop me for this murder,

769
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:37,841
she's a felony accessory.

she set this up?

Ok?

775
00:44:48,818 --> 00:44:52,089
Then it's her word
against yours,

776
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,091
which is very bad
for you,

777
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,692
unless, of course,

778

this arrangement.

780
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,932

00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:04,468
I just don't
want to involve him.

782
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,803
Then take a boat,
take a plane,

783

see Argentina.

784

who really did it.

00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,290
I read it in
wall street journal.

832
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,293
"Tips for executives
who entertain a lot."

833
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,495
What are you doing?

834
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,297
Putting it back.

835
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,900
You already opened it.
We have to pay for it.

836
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,435
I don't understand you.

837
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,903
You'd, like, steal
the Chrysler building,

838
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,706
but now we got to pay
for olive oil?

839
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:26,810
It's not what you steal,
it's who you steal from.

840
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:30,380
* let's go dancin' *

841
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,250
* let's go dancin' *

842
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,319
* dancin' on the ceiling *

843
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,354
kir royale,
please.

844
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,923
Think we stick out
in here?

845
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,925
What will it be?

846
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,327
Cranberry juice.

847
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,329
I'll have
a kir royale.

848
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,331
Just keep them coming.

849
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,334
I'll have, like,
a bucket of them.

850
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,336
Carl, Carl,
cool out.

851
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,538
Give him
one kir royale.

852
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,340
You got it.

853
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,342
What is wrong
with you?

854
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,811
I feel like I'm
at an amway convention.

855
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:03,713
Will you stop?

856
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:11,388
So many guys
come in here.

857
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,357
He looks
a little familiar.

858
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,860
Look real close.
You never went out with him?

859
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:22,166
Hi, ladies.
How are you today?

860
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,969
I'm drinking
the kir royale here.

861
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,971
Perhaps I could
buy you--

862
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,773
you're already
drinking something.

863
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:33,377
You probably don't want
to drink with me, huh?

864
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:38,047
What are you doing when you're
not driving young guys wild?

865
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:39,983
Was there
any one person,

866
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,985
any one
specific person?

867
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,620
Nah. always
somebody different.

868
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,623
He got more ass
than a toilet seat.

869
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:49,826
That is beautiful.

870
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,329
Guys, too,
if you ask me.

871
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:55,999
My name's
Carl hefler!

872
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,001
I'm a gemini.

873
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:02,138
I lost my keys
to my BMW.

874
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:04,140
You didn't see them,
did you?

875
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,409
Let's cut this shit.

876
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,346
Would you like to go
wah wah wah with me?

877
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,614
Are you guys cops?

878
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,448
Mm-hmm.

879
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,682
I knew it.
I fuckin' knew it!

880
00:49:12,682 --> 00:49:14,651
The minute you walked in,
i knew it.

881
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,986
Really? my god.

882
00:49:16,986 --> 00:49:18,121
Well, you see
that guy over there?

883
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,223
That's my partner,

884
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:21,191
and he is head
of homicide.

885
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,792
No shit.

886
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,830
Whoo!

887
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,831
* ooh, yeah *

888
00:49:46,716 --> 00:49:49,886
* I never thought
i would see it *

889
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:55,492
* now I know
that you were right *

890
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,661
excuse me.
Bartender?

891
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,829
Can I get
3 black Russians.

892
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:02,031
Make that 4.

893
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:04,568
You want
4 black Russians?

894
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:05,602
Ok!

895
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,572
I would like to purchase
4 black Russians!

896
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,509
* I've got a new way *

897
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,478
* of livin' *

898
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,414
* now that I'm
here with you *

899
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,085
how's that olive oil
working?

900
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:24,087
I don't know, man.

901
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,922
Get away.

902
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,524
Leave me alone.

903
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,294
Get away.
I open at 9:00.

904
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,967
* tough guys don't dance *

905
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,571
* they know it all *

906
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:46,142
* give them a chance *

907
00:50:46,142 --> 00:50:48,845
* tough guys don't dance *

908
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:54,318
* they know it all *

909
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,121
mind if we join you?

910
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,524
Just as long
as you're not

911
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:03,327
a couple
of fucking dentists.

912
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,534
With a guy
like Christopher,

913
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,537
he was like a bird,
you know?

914
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,539
You can't own him.

915
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,142
You just hope he'll
fly by and see you

916
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,144
every now and then.

917
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,380
You know what?

918
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,682
What?

919
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:29,353
You two smell
like a salad.

920
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,758
I think
i ought to go.

921
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,164
Get in.

922
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,367
Get in.
Watch your head.

923
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,171
Take him home.

924
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,773
Sure.

925
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,174
Night, Carl.

926
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:52,776
Good night.

927
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,049
You know what?

928
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:03,753
You look a little bit
like Elvis Presley.

929
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:07,023
Not when he was fat
and on drugs,

930
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,092
but, like,
before all that.

931
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:13,296
Um...where to?

932
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,364
Home.

933
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,665
Where's home?

934
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,667
How about we drive around?

935
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,269
I know I can pick it out.

936
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:21,971
It's got, like, a mailbox.

937
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,651
When a guy can screw
any woman he meets,

938
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:38,254
he winds up not having
too many friends.

939
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:41,157
Maybe he's too busy.

940
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:44,193
Maybe other men
don't like it.

941
00:52:44,193 --> 00:52:47,797
I'd vote for jealousy,
if I voted.

942
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,599
I don't vote.

943
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,803
What about this artist
you mentioned, grambo?

944
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,772
Graybow.

945
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,206
Graybow.

946
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:59,208
"Gray" and then
like "bow."

947
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:00,209
Graybow.

948
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:01,277
Graybow.

949
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:04,213
Graybow always had
a lot of cash,

950
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:06,015
loved to grab a check.

951
00:53:06,015 --> 00:53:09,218
I guess he sold
a lot of paintings.

952
00:53:09,218 --> 00:53:11,220
Christopher
was friendly with him.

953
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,022
And knobby,
the bartender.

954
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:16,626
The three of them
would sit up there

955
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,963
at the bar
in a tight little huddle.

956
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:24,233
Sometimes they'd
talk all night.

957
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:26,235
Knobby
tends bar here?

958
00:53:26,235 --> 00:53:28,237
Yeah, but I ain't
seen him

959
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:30,239
in a couple
of days--nights.

960
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,577
Happen to know
his real name?

961
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,246
You got me.

962
00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:40,850
He's a real scumball
anyhow.

963
00:53:42,251 --> 00:53:44,253
He's got no hair.

964
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:46,656
He's bald.

965
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:51,260
Uh, is there
anybody else

966
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,262
you can
think of,

967
00:53:53,262 --> 00:53:54,664
anybody at all?

968
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,867
I can name
40 women he knew.

969
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:58,735
No.

970
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,537
You're not interested
in women?

971
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:02,138
Just the men.

972
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,907
Short list.

973
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,274
Look...

974
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:08,612
This is real
important to me.

975
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,680
Just think hard.
Please try.

976
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,483
That's not really
my forte.

977
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:19,022
Oh, yeah.
Here's Johnny.

978
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,289
He's an executroid.

979
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:21,290
A what?

980
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,392
You know
the bar Parkers?

981
00:54:23,392 --> 00:54:24,894
Yeah, on 5th.

982
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,029
Yeah.

983
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,764
He was one of those
a 3-piece executroids

984
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,699
that hang out there.

985
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,301
Christopher always
called him Johnny.

986
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:35,605
"Here's Johnny!"
He'd say.

987
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,774
Happen to catch
his real name?

988
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:42,512
No, not interested.

989
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:48,317
What line of work
are you in?

990
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:50,520
I'm a cat burglar.

991
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,723
No shit.

992
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,325
What do you
do with them?

993
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:57,561
What?

994
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,529
The cats.

995
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:08,037
I hold them for ransom.

996
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:12,942
Is there any money in that?

997
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,212
Oh, Jesus.

998
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:20,149
Look who's asking if there's
any money in pussy.

999
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,274
[Knock on door]

1000
00:55:45,274 --> 00:55:47,176
Open up! Police!

1001
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,614
[Knocking]

1002
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,418
[Knocking]

1003
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,420
Open up, please.
Police.

1004
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,422
[Knocking]

1005
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,190
Shut up!

1006
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,491
Blah...

1007
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:04,493
I'm coming.

1008
00:56:04,493 --> 00:56:06,663
Blah...

1009
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:10,099
Ah! hi.

1010
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:12,235
You're Carl hefler?

1011
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,638
I am hefler.

1012
00:56:14,638 --> 00:56:15,805
Jesus.

1013
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:19,142
Do you know
a bernice rhodenbarr?

1014
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,710
No.

1015
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,913
She broke into this man's
apartment and stabbed him.

1016
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,081
She did?

1017
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,015
Uh-huh.

1018
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,251
We'd like to talk
to you about that.

1019
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:31,587
But first we'd like you
to go brush your teeth.

1020
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,627
If he's a
professional artist

1021
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,528
living and working
in the bay area,

1022
00:56:39,528 --> 00:56:41,530
he'll be in here.

1023
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,400
Thanks.
his name is graybow.

1024
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,003
I know, dear,
i know.

1025
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,338
Hmm.

1026
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:51,207
Is, uh...This for sale?

1027
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:52,608
It is.

1028
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:56,045
Because I need something
to go over my bed.

1029
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:59,382
Graybow. here it is,
right here.

1030
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:00,750
Oh, really?

1031
00:57:02,451 --> 00:57:04,053
Thank you.

1032
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:05,354
Thanks.

1033
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:06,489
Charley Weaver,

1034
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,523
Wally Cox,

1035
00:57:07,523 --> 00:57:09,092
Paul lynde.

1036
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,094
Apparently,
there's something

1037
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,296
a little bit
more mysterious

1038
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:14,864
about
the secret squares

1039
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:16,866
than we're ever led
to believe,

1040
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,869
and I'm asking you,
cop, dude guy,

1041
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,072
I want some answers
from you now pronto!

1042
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:23,907
Oh, beautiful!

1043
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,009
I'm bugged.
I'm being bugged.

1044
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:29,412
Don't touch that. You signed
a release form for that.

1045
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,380
So?
this is bullshit.

1046
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,782
You're driving
me nuts.

1047
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,183
Don't look at me

1048
00:57:34,183 --> 00:57:35,785
you're such
a condescending fuck--

1049
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,787
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

1050
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,355
When I said that,

1051
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:40,824
I was smirking
a little.

1052
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,827
Are you ok?
I'm worried about you?

1053
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,428
I'm fine. Thank you.

1054
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,230
Do you know
that policemen

1055
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,432
have the highest
rate of suicide?

1056
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,434
So you think
I'm fucked up,

1057
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,836
you better
be careful yourself.

1058
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,303
Someday, boom!
In the closet.

1059
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:57,540
That will be great
for your children

1060
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,543
to find a big,
dead, old, fat cop.

1061
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,478
You know
why I'm here?

1062
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:04,881
It's because
I'm a black man

1063
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:08,017
in a white man's
world!

1064
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:11,320
You're a Caucasian,
Mr. hefler.

1065
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,557
Beautiful! throw that
in my face, too!

1066
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,727
And I...

1067
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,764
And I look
like shit.

1068
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:22,031
All right!

1069
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,235
You got any mousse?

1070
00:58:26,235 --> 00:58:27,603
How's it going?

1071
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:29,172
Not so good.

1072
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,040
I can see
people in there.

1073
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,042
It's looks like
a people aquarium.

1074
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:36,245
Let him go
as soon as possible.

1075
00:58:36,245 --> 00:58:37,246
Hello!

1076
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,059
Hey, what's
happenin', man?

1077
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,593
I'm looking
for the apartment

1078
00:59:24,593 --> 00:59:26,095
of rayneta moody.

1079
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:27,463
Oh!

1080
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,335
What the fuck you
doing out there?

1081
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:33,970
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1082
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,238
What are you doing
to my fuckin' door?!

1083
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,639
I told you--

1084
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,608
what are you doing
to my door?

1085
00:59:39,608 --> 00:59:41,610
I'm going to be ill soon.

1086
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,980
Unless I get a glass
of water,

1087
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,983
I'm going to vomit
all over you--

1088
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,185
no, no,
don't throw up.

1089
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,586
Hold it.

1090
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:52,355
Goddamn junkies.

1091
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,193
Egads, man, I was
just cruisin' by.

1092
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,195
I'm looking
for rayneta moody

1093
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:04,067
because they told me to
bring the stuff over here.

1094
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,401
You probably
was real nervous

1095
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,203
when you opened the door
and checked my ass out,

1096
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:11,007
but I figured 5-0-0,
how many could there be?

1097
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:14,010
Just drink it, shut up,
and get out.

1098
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,145
No problem, man,
no problem.

1099
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:20,984
Wow! this is really hip.
You a artist, huh?

1100
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,986
Whoa! whoa!
Kick my ass.

1101
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,021
I like this one
over here, man.

1102
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:28,224
This remind me
of some trips I took

1103
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:30,226
with some people
i know,

1104
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,029
but it wasn't like we
wasn't going anywhere

1105
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,663
because we'd
already arrived

1106
01:00:34,663 --> 01:00:37,300
by the time we left.

1107
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,535
The fluidity
of this painting

1108
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:41,337
is moving me
beyond belief

1109
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,940
because the turnip
aspect of it

1110
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,942
that is moving
my soul--

1111
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,944
finish the water.

1112
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,212
No problem, man.

1113
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,247
Whoa! you got
that African shit.

1114
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:53,516
Man, that's
really hip.

1115
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:54,951
Like the brothers.

1116
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,219
* umbelly umbelly
badup badup *

1117
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,954
* umbelly umbelly
badup badup *

1118
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:00,356
* ai-ay ai-ay
ai-ay ai-ay *

1119
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:01,557
whoa!

1120
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,961
Stand here,
don't move around,

1121
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:07,563
and cut
the umbelly shit.

1122
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,565
You got it, man.

1123
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:12,368
I don't want
to upset you.

1124
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:15,371
Oh, no,
i don't want to upset you.

1125
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:18,374
I had a friend
who was into cleavers,

1126
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:21,577
I said, "you shouldn't be
buyin' that shit."

1127
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,579
He had a temper

1128
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,514
really throw you...Off.

1129
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:29,118
You know how people get
when they go off.

1130
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:31,820
Like you off now,
but you ok.

1131
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,122
You would not hurt me

1132
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,858
because you got this
big, black-ass dog.

1133
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:39,262
How was I supposed to know
the dog was mad?

1134
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:44,233
I didn't want
to upset you or the dog.

1135
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,603
God knows
I'm into save the animals.

1136
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:50,439
Easy, oboe. Ommm...

1137
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:51,975
The dog jumped at me,
talkin' shit to me.

1138
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:55,311
Talkin', like, he was
really letting me know

1139
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:56,845
that this was your space.

1140
01:01:56,845 --> 01:01:58,147
You know how people get,

1141
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,884
which I can really dig,
because you a artist.

1142
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,552
You into stuff,

1143
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:07,823
you're moving and grooving
with the real thing.

1144
01:02:07,823 --> 01:02:11,894
Um...i...
i should go now, yeah.

1145
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,729
All right,
who are you?

1146
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:14,998
Whoa!

1147
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:17,033
You're going to let me know
why you're here!

1148
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,401
What do you think I am,
a goddamn idiot?

1149
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,070
You're going to
tell me why you're here!

1150
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:24,273
Tell me
or I'll cut you!

1151
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:27,376
I'll tell you.
I promise, I promise.

1152
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,247
I'll tell you this much.

1153
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,656
Oh...

1154
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:46,262

01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:39,333
and I can prove it.

1479
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:41,969
Who is this?

1480
01:25:41,969 --> 01:25:43,605
Guess.

1481
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:48,009
Look, I'm in a very
important meeting.

1482
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:50,778
I got a very important
meeting with the cops.

1483
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:53,080
About what?

1484
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,582
You and Christopher.

1485
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:56,418
What about me and--

1486
01:25:56,418 --> 01:25:58,953
what about us?

1487
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,622
Oh, I know everything.

1488
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:05,460
I've even got a witness,
a good friend of Christopher's.

1489
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:10,665
Oop. got to go,
counselor.

1490
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:12,700
Uh, no, wait, uh...

1491
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,879
Look...look,
i have no idea

1492
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:26,848
what this conversation
is about,

1493
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:29,984
but, uh...What is it
that you want?

1494
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:31,786
It's very easy.

1495
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:34,388
I want my bag back
with everything in it.

1496
01:26:34,388 --> 01:26:37,759
And then what?

1497
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:40,995
I don't know.
Take a boat, maybe a plane,

1498
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:42,797
go visit Argentina.

1499
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:46,100
I'll be out of here
by dark.

1500
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:05,820
Where would you like
to meet me?

1501
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:10,892
Stern grove, 2:00,
by the stage. Be there.

1502
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:17,031
Gotcha.

1503
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:19,126
Nice weather
we're having, counselor.

1504
01:28:19,126 --> 01:28:20,762
Where's the gun?

1505
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:22,363
Where's my jewels?

1506
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:23,665
Dr. sheldrake's jewels.

1507
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:26,568
I don't think so,
not after all this shit.

1508
01:28:26,568 --> 01:28:29,236
First, the gun.

1509
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,143
Throw it.

1510
01:28:36,143 --> 01:28:40,381
Throw it? You know
how much these things cost?

1511
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:43,685
Throw it as far
as you can.

1512
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,059
Shit.

1513
01:28:54,762 --> 01:28:56,397
Where's my stuff?

1514
01:28:56,397 --> 01:28:59,000
In the trunk of my car.

1515
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,334
Get it.

1516
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:03,671
First you tell me
what you know.

1517
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:07,609
I know everything.

1518
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:10,812
I know you killed
Christopher,

1519
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,546
and I know you killed
the artist

1520
01:29:12,546 --> 01:29:13,547
'cause he knew
you were involved.

1521
01:29:13,547 --> 01:29:14,649
I did, huh?

1522
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:16,317
Yes, counselor verrill.

1523
01:29:16,317 --> 01:29:17,819
Let me ask you
something.

1524
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,854
Do you think
that I would--

1525
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:21,555
a very
successful lawyer

1526
01:29:21,555 --> 01:29:22,857
with a thriving
law firm--

1527
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:24,191
would go around
killing people

1528
01:29:24,191 --> 01:29:25,126
for counterfeit money?

1529
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:27,428
No, I think that
was an afterthought.

1530
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:29,396
I think you killed
Christopher

1531
01:29:29,396 --> 01:29:30,698
because you were
in love with him.

1532
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:32,834
I didn't figure that one out
until last night.

1533
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:35,169
See, I thought you were
pissed at the doctor,

1534
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:38,105
but you were pissed
at Christopher, weren't you?

1535
01:29:38,105 --> 01:29:40,908
I have a wife
and 3 children.

1536
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,844
All the worse for them.

1537
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:45,046
I never even knew
Christopher Marshall.

1538
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,014
Really? Frankie!

1539
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,320
Who's this?

1540
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,856
That's Frankie.

1541
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,791
You know Frankie.

1542
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,026
She knows you.

1543
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:06,801
Here's Johnny.

1544
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:09,737
I don't know you.

1545
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:10,738
Sure, you do.

1546
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:12,606
You're
Christopher's friend.

1547
01:30:12,606 --> 01:30:14,676
I've seen you together
a couple of times.

1548
01:30:14,676 --> 01:30:16,678
That's
a goddamn lie.

1549
01:30:16,678 --> 01:30:18,212
He told me all about you.

1550
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:22,884
I slept with him, too,
every now and then.

1551
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:25,219
This is preposterous.
This is all lies.

1552
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:26,688
What did he tell you?

1553
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:29,023
You know, the whole plan

1554
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:33,327
about how you sort of
figured it all out for him.

1555
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:35,763
He said, "that goddamn verrill,
boy, is he smart.

1556
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:38,132
"Verrill thinks
we should do this

1557
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:40,401
verrill thinks
we should that--"

1558
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:41,669
that's enough.

1559
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:43,504
But I don't think
he completely trusted you,

1560
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:48,175
or else he wouldn't have
recorded your pillow talk.

1561
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:56,918
Look, nobody has to know
about any of this.

1562
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:59,053
I'll go to my car.

1563
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:00,321
Thank you.

1564
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:02,924
Carson, you want to tell me
what happened to the money

1565
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:05,059
the mafia gave knobby?

1566
01:31:05,059 --> 01:31:07,929
Um, well, it's at my home.

1567
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:11,465
Great. we can pick it up on
the way to the airport.

1568
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:12,700
All right.

1569
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,537
Hey, mister, why did you
have to kill him?

1570
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:18,539
Why?

1571
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:20,341
Because...

1572
01:31:22,676 --> 01:31:25,146
Because...

1573
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:28,950
Because...because he didn't

1574
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,118
give a shit about anybody!

1575
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:33,955
Oh, my god.

1576
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:36,690
Explain this, bitch.

1577
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:39,326
Ray!

1578
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:44,565
I didn't know.
I'm sorry, Frankie.

1579
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:46,567
It doesn't hurt.

1580
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:49,771
Doesn't hurt much
at all.

1581
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:55,076
Well, Jesus,
i guess not.

1582
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,026

01:32:25,572 --> 01:32:27,508
Carl, which way
did he go?

1586
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:29,310
That-a-way.

1587
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:52,800
Uh!

1588

You fucking bitch,

1589
01:32:56,838 --> 01:32:58,272
I'll kill you
with my bare hands!

1590
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:00,541
Why? are you out
of ice picks?

1591

Ah!

1592
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:08,082
Damn you!

1616
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:40,534

to your head?

1620
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:47,408
What happened
to your nose?

1621
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,309
It's all right.

1622
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:49,710
Did you get everything
on the tape?

1623
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:52,446
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

1624
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:56,017
I also popped
the trunk of his car.

1625
01:35:56,017 --> 01:35:57,751
You stopped to do that

1626
01:35:57,751 --> 01:35:58,919
and didn't come
to help me?

Now, look.

1630
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:06,360
Now, if he moves

1631
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,962
or even looks like
he's gonna wake up,

1632
01:36:08,962 --> 01:36:10,564
crown him.

01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:12,166
Ok.

1634
01:36:13,767 --> 01:36:16,970
Wasn't anything on the tape
about the jewelry?

1635
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:18,472
Not that I recorded.

Carl, I said
only if he wakes up.

1639
01:36:24,978 --> 01:36:25,979
I thought
i saw him move,

1640
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:27,981
like,
just a little bit.

1641
01:36:27,981 --> 01:36:29,483
Yeah.

1642
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:33,787
I got to stop
doing this shit.

1643
01:36:33,787 --> 01:36:35,822
Yeah, sure,
Bernie, sure.

1644
01:36:35,822 --> 01:36:36,957
No, really.

1645
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,126
It's in your blood.
You can't quit.

1646
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:41,128
Take it from
somebody who knows.

1647
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:43,530
Oh, really, Mr. I'm-a-
detective-in-a-chintzy-coat-

1648
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:45,132
with-a-retirement-plan,
really?

1649
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:47,201
Really, my love.

1650
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:50,271
Say, there, ray,
you're kind of cute.

1651
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:51,272
Hey, god damn it.

1652
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:53,006
I could
get behind you.

1653
01:36:53,006 --> 01:36:55,008
Bernie, what
are you doing?

1654
01:36:55,008 --> 01:36:56,210
I want to talk
to you, ray.

1655
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:57,378
I want to get
up in your face.

1656
01:36:57,378 --> 01:36:58,912
As a matter of fact,
i think I'm gonna

1657
01:36:58,912 --> 01:37:00,447
get up in your face

1658
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:02,283
and tell you this
to your mug.

1659
01:37:02,283 --> 01:37:04,918
Keep your behind
out of my bookstore

1660
01:37:04,918 --> 01:37:06,553
because I know
you can't read.

1661
01:37:06,553 --> 01:37:08,122
Bernie, I thought
we were a team.

1662
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:09,423
Team this, honey.

1663
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:12,293
Hey, get off me
and go get Carl

1664
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:13,560
before
he kills that guy.

1665
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,895
I'm not going
back over there.

1666
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,497
I just came
out of the water...

1667
01:37:21,568 --> 01:37:25,872
* anytime my eyes
are tellin' you a story *

1668
01:37:25,872 --> 01:37:27,708
* there's a happy endin' *

1669
01:37:30,844 --> 01:37:32,313
* but what you might hear *

1670
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:37,784
* isn't always
what I'm sayin' to you *

1671
01:37:37,784 --> 01:37:39,586
* oh, yeah *

1672
01:37:39,586 --> 01:37:43,056
* when you read my lips,
you're takin' inventory *

1673
01:37:43,056 --> 01:37:46,460
* so I keep pretendin' *

1674
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:50,063
* oh, I need *

1675
01:37:50,063 --> 01:37:51,532

in this fix, baby? *

1677
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:55,769

1678
01:37:55,769 --> 01:37:59,072

01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:11,852
* time out
'cause I'm takin' leave *

1682
01:38:16,089 --> 01:38:18,692
* think of life *

1683
01:38:18,692 --> 01:38:21,094
* as a tightrope *

1684
01:38:21,094 --> 01:38:25,232
* there's one way in
or out *

1685
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:30,036
* I could fall
if I can't cope *

1686
01:38:30,036 --> 01:38:32,873
* but I'm stayin'
on my toes *

1687
01:38:34,441 --> 01:38:35,776
* don't give up *

1688
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:36,877

* over *

1691
01:38:39,513 --> 01:38:41,582
* what I should do *

1692
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:44,918
* is think
this whole thing through *

1693
01:38:44,918 --> 01:38:46,253
