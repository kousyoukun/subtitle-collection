1
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:32,775
(woman) Earth-That-Was...

2
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:35,976
could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so many.

3
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:41,683
We found a new solar system:

4
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:44,955
dozens of planets and hundreds of moons.

5
00:00:46,662 --> 00:00:50,029
Each one terraformed, a process taking decades...

6
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:53,262
to support human life. To be new Earths.

7
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:56,202
The central planets formed the Alliance.

8
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,633
Ruled by an interplanetary parliament...

9
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:01,175
the Alliance was a beacon of civilization.

10
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:04,972
The savage outer planets were not so enlightened...

11
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:07,072
and refused Alliance control.

12
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:10,115
The war was devastating.

13
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:13,114
But the Alliance's victory over the Independents...

14
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:15,053
ensured a safer universe.

15
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:17,452
And now, everyone can enjoy the comfort...

16
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:19,824
and enlightenment of true civilization.

17
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:22,930
Why were the lndependents even fighting us?

18
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:24,966
Why wouldn't they look to be more civilized?

19
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:27,627
I hear they're cannibals. That's only Reavers.

20
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:29,830
Reavers aren't real. Full well they are.

21
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:31,736
I heard they attack settlers from space...

22
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:33,240
and kill them, and wear their skins...

23
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:35,469
and rape them for hours and hours--

24
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:36,636

[birds chirping]

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,475
It's true that there are dangers on the outer planets.

27
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:44,085
So with so many social and medical advancements...

28
00:01:44,153 --> 00:01:46,246
we can bring to the lndependents...

29
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,152
why would they fight so hard against us?

30
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:49,315
We meddle.

31
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:50,881
River?

32
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:53,652
People don't like to be meddled with.

33
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,856
We tell them what to do, what to think.

34
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,523
Don't run, don't walk.

35
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:01,491
We're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right.

36
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,935
We're meddlesome.

37
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:07,503
River, we're not telling people what to think...

38
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,338
we're just trying to show them how.

39
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:11,937
[screaming]

40
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:14,710
(Dr. Mathias) She's dreaming. Got that? Off the charts.

41
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,312
Scary monsters.

42
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:18,410
Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight drop.

43
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:19,476
[panting]

44
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,916
See, most of our best work is done when they're asleep.

45
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:25,551
We can monitor and direct their subconscious...

46
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,322
implant suggestions.

47
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:31,223
It's a little startling to see at first, but results are spectacular.

48
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,767
Especially in this case. River Tam is our star pupil.

49
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:36,201
I've heard that.

50
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:38,170
She'll be ideal for defense deployment...

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,037
even with the side effects.

52
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,635
Tell me about them.

53
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,201
Well, obviously, she's unstable.

54
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:47,077
The neural stripping does tend to fragment...

55
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,707
their own reality matrix.

56
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:50,911
It manifests as borderline-- What use do we have...

57
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:52,681
for a psychic if she's insane?

58
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:54,654
[groaning] (Dr. Mathias) She's not just a psychic.

59
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:57,283
Given the right trigger, this girl is a living weapon.

60
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,954
She has her lucid periods. We're hoping to improve upon the....

61
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:04,631
I'm sorry, sir, but I have to ask.

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,191
Is there a reason for this inspection?

63
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,164
Am I making you nervous?

64
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:12,697
Key members of Parliament have personally observed this subject.

65
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:14,674
I was told that the Alliance's support...

66
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:16,210
for the project was unanimous.

67
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:19,645
The demonstration of her power-- How is she physically?

68
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,476
Like nothing we've seen.

69
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:25,945
All our subjects are conditioned for combat, but River...

70
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,888
she's a creature of extraordinary grace.

71
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:31,924
Yes.

72
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,154
She always did love to dance.

73
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:41,394
River, it's Simon.

74
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,759
[moaning]

75
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,840
Please, it's Simon.

76
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:48,665
It's your brother.

77
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:57,440
Simon.

78
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:01,547
They know you've come.

79
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:04,325
[machines beeping]

80
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:09,220
We can't make it to the surface from inside.

81
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,095
Find out.

82
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:26,703

(The Operative) Stop.

86
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:08,989
Backtrack. Stop.

87
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:22,564
Excuse me...

88
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:24,628
no one is allowed in the records room...

89
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,469
without my express permission.

90
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,772
Forgive me, but I prefer to see the event alone, without...

91
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:31,935
bias.

92
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:35,312
I need to see your clearance. And you are right to insist.

93
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:37,408
[beeping]

94
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,449
(woman) Parliamentary override. Full access.

95
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:41,881
Apologies.

96
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:43,219
An operative of the Parliament...

97
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,657
will, of course, have full cooperation.

98
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:47,685
I'm not sure what....

99
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:52,160
I see no listing of rank or name. I have neither.

100
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:56,332
Like this facility, I don't exist.

101
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,401
Let's talk about the Tams.

102
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:00,704
I assume you've scanned the status logs--

103
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,870
River was your greatest success. A prodigy.

104
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:06,143
A phenomenon.

105
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:09,545
Until her brother walked in here and took her from you.

106
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,447
It's not quite so simple. I'm well aware of that.

107
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:15,354
There was no way that I could-- No. No. Of course.

108
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:17,415
The boy spent his entire fortune developing...

109
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:19,187
the contacts to infiltrate this place.

110
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:21,786
Gave up a brilliant future in medicine as well.

111
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:24,127
It's madness. Madness?

112
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,729
Have you looked at this scan carefully, Doctor?

113
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:30,129
At his face?

114
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,639
It's love, in point of fact.

115
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:38,439
Something a good deal more dangerous.

116
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:39,671
Why are you here?

117
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:44,378
Because the situation is even less simple than you think.

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,314
Do you know what your sin is, Doctor?

119
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:51,455
I wonder if-- It's pride.

120
00:06:56,965 --> 00:07:00,264
Key members of Parliament have personally observed this subject.

121
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:03,063
I was told that the Alliance's support--

122
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:07,635
"Key members of Parliament."

123
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:11,939
Key.

124
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:15,179
The minds behind every military...

125
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,810
diplomatic, and covert operation...

126
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:20,548
in the galaxy, and you put them...

127
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:23,056
in a room with a psychic.

128
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:28,424
If there was some classified information that she....

129
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:30,497
She never spoke of it. I don't know what it is.

130
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:31,623
Nor do l.

131
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,668
And judging by her deteriorating mental state...

132
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:34,997
I'd say we're both better off.

133
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,698
Secrets are not my concern.

134
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:40,873
Keeping them is.

135
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:45,572
Whatever secrets she might have accidentally gleaned...

136
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:48,115
it's probable she doesn't even know she knows them.

137
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:50,913
That they're buried beneath layers of psychosis.

138
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:55,887
You know, in certain older civilized cultures...

139
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:58,149
when men failed as entirely...

140
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,717
as you have, they would throw themselves...

141
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,021
on their swords.

142
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:04,691
Well, unfortunately, I forgot to bring a sword.

143
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:10,634
I would put that down right now, if I were you.

144
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:13,731
Would you be killed in your sleep like an ailing pet?

(The Operative) Young miss....

Young miss, I'll need all the logs on behavioral modification triggers.

150
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,129
We'll have to reach out to River Tam...

151
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:37,630
and help her to come back to us.

152

No matter how far out Simon has....

00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:47,371
There's no shame in this...

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,644
in a man's death. A man who has done fine works.

158

We're making a better world.

All of them...

00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:03,013
better worlds.

Young miss, I need you to go to work now.

162
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:15,500
I think I may have a long way to travel.

163
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:29,475
Where are you hiding, little girl?

Was that the primary buffer panel?

It did seem to resemble-- Did the primary buffer panel...

169
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:40,154
just fall off my gorramn ship for no apparent reason?

170
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,114
Looks like.

171
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:44,749
I thought Kaylee checked the entry couplings.

172
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:46,817
I've a clear memory of it. If she doesn't get us...

173
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,455
extra flow from the engine room to offset the burn-through...

174
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,158
this landing is gonna get pretty interesting.

175
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:54,167
Define "interesting." "Oh, God, we're all gonna die?"

176
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:58,862
This is the captain. We have a little problem...

177
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,033
with our entry sequence, so we may experience some...

178
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:03,475
slight turbulence and then explode.

179
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:05,069
Can you shave the vector? I'm doing it!

180
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:07,808
It's not enough. Just get us on the ground!

181
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:10,282
That part will happen pretty definitely.

182
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,586
We're gonna explode? I don't wanna explode.

183
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,247
Jayne, how many weapons you plan on taking?

184
00:11:15,323 --> 00:11:17,223
You only got two arms. I just get excitable...

185
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,192
as to choice. Like to have my options open.

186
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,592
I don't plan on any shooting taking place during this job.

187
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:25,258
What you plan and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar.

188
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,733
No grenades.

189
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:30,063
We crashing again? (Mal) Talk to your husband.

190
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:31,366
Mule prepped? Good to go, sir.

191
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,428
Just loading her up.

192
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:33,531
Those grenades?

193
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:35,007
(Jayne) Yeah, Captain doesn't want them.

194
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:37,601
Jayne, we're robbing the place. We're not occupying it.

195
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,074
[crashing]

196
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:43,514
Kaylee!

197
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:49,983
Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at?

198
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:52,026
We got the primary buffer panel coming right--

199
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,357
Everything's shiny, Captain. Not to fret.

200
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:57,893
You told me those entry couplings would hold for another week!

201
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,959
That was six months ago, Captain. My ship don't crash.

202
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,465
If she crashes, you crashed her.

203
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,266
Doctor.

204
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,073
Guess who needs to get innocked before we hit planet-side.

205
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,342
Bit of a rockety ride.

206
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:16,883
Nothing to be worried about. I'm not worried.

207
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,209
Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doctor.

208
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,881
This isn't fear. This is anger.

209
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:27,122
Well, kind of hard to tell one from the other, face like yours.

210
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,495
Well, I imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be wider.

211
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:32,331
I'll keep a lookout for that next time.

212
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,697
You're not taking her.

213
00:12:33,768 --> 00:12:36,635
No, no, this is not a thing I'm interested in talking over with--

214
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:39,002
She's not going with you, and that's final.

215
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:42,042
I hear the words "that's final" come out your mouth ever again...

216
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,577
they truly will be.

217
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:47,709
This boat is my home. You all are guests on it.

218
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:49,343
Guests?

219
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:51,949
Now, I earned my passage, Captain-- (Mal) And it's time...

220
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,817
your little sister learned from your example.

221
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:56,118
I have earned my passage...

222
00:12:56,691 --> 00:13:00,024
treating bullet holes, knife wounds, laser burns.

223
00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:01,857
Some jobs are more interesting than others.

224
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,898
And you want to put my sister in the middle of that.

225
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:06,126
Didn't say "want." Said "will."

226
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,862
It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine.

227
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,496
She's a 17-year-old girl.

228
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,467
A mentally traumatized 17-- She's a reader.

229
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:15,876
Sees into the truth of things.

230
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:18,674
Might see trouble before it's coming. Which is of use to me.

231
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:22,113
And that's your guiding star, isn't it? What's of use.

232
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:26,175
Honestly, Doctor, I think we may really crash this time anyway.

233
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:28,579
Do you understand what I have gone through...

234
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,089
to keep River away from the Alliance?

235
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:32,718
I do, and it's a fact we here have been courteous...

236
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,352
enough to keep to our own selves.

237
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:37,557
Are you threatening to-- I look out for me and mine.

238
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:41,498
That don't include you less I conjure it does.

239
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:44,732
You stuck a thorn in the Alliance's paw. That tickles me a bit.

240
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:47,604
But it also means I got to step twice as fast to avoid them...

241
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:50,143
and that means turning down plenty of jobs.

242
00:13:50,211 --> 00:13:51,576
Even honest ones.

243
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:54,277
Put this crew together with the promise of work...

244
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:56,544
[metal clanking] which the Alliance makes harder every year.

245
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,848
Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us...

246
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,444
to slip about at all.

247
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:03,716
This job goes south, there well may not be another.

248
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:07,190
So here is us, on the raggedy edge.

249
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,758
Don't push me, and I won't push you.

250
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,963
[speaking Chinese]

251
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:30,005
Zoe, Wash gonna straighten this boat out before we get flattened?

252
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:33,611
(Zoe) Like a downy feather, sir. No one flies like my mister.

253
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:35,653
[engine grinding]

254
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:38,784
[Mal and Zoe chattering]

255
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:43,786
(Simon) River.

256
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:48,065
I know. We're going for a ride.

257
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:52,103
[engine revving]

258
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:03,076
[people chattering]

259
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,480
Hey, little one.

260
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:13,053
Understand your part in all this?

261
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:16,454
Do you?

262
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:19,996
This is what I do, darling.

263
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:25,070
This is what I do.

264
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:29,041
(Mal) Let's move, people.

265
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:32,813
Quit fiddling. Want the boat running smooth when we get back.

266
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,508
Have faith, Captain. Not today.

267
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,418
Pair of clips in the rear hatch.

268
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:42,248
We should hit town right during Sunday worship.

269
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:43,654
Won't be any crowds.

270
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,023
If Fanty and Mingo are right about the payroll...

271
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:48,153
this could look to be a sunny day for us.

272
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:50,129
(Simon) River, stay behind the others.

273
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,224
If there's fighting, drop to the floor or run away.

274
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:56,259
It's okay to leave them to die.

275
00:15:56,571 --> 00:16:00,063
Doctor, I'm taking your sister under my protection here.

276
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:02,637
If anything happens to her, anything at all...

277
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,611
I swear to you I will get very choked up.

278
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,671
Honestly. There could be tears.

279
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:20,522
Don't mind the Captain none, Simon. I know he'll look out for her.

280
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:23,357
They'll be back before you can spit.

281
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:28,502
Well, not that you spit.

282
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:35,704
(Jayne) What are we hoping to find here...

283
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,210
that equals the worth of a turd?

284
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,111
(Mal) Security payroll. Alliance don't have the manpower...

285
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:42,775
to "enforce the peace" on every outer-rim planet.

286
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,115
They hire out to the private firms, who will not work for credit.

287
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:49,623
They get paid in cashy money, which once a month rests here.

288
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,715
Don't that lead back to the Alliance, anyhow?

289
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:54,660
No private firm would ever report the theft of their own payroll.

290
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:57,892
They'd appear weak, might lose their contract.

291
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:01,594
Yeah, we're as ghosts in this. Won't but rattle the floor.

292
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:05,833
Shiny. Let's be bad guys.

293
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,966
Hands and knees and heads bowed down! Everybody, down!

294
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:10,203
[woman screaming]

295
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,268
[grunting]

296
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,745
Looks like this is the place.

297
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:24,516
You all wanna be looking very intently at your own belly buttons.

298
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,856
I see a head start to rise, violence is going to ensue.

299
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,957
Probably guessed we mean to be thieving here...

300
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:33,193
but what we're after is not yours.

301
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:35,926
So let's have no undue fussing.

302
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:38,002
She's locked up.

303
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,547
[people murmuring]

304
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:27,253
Do you know what the definition of a hero is?

305
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:30,150
Someone who gets other people killed.

306
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,187
You can look it up later.

307
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:37,363
Big happy family.

308
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:43,726
[beeping]

309
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:50,266
At last. We can retire and give up this life of crime.

310
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:56,480
[metal rattling]

311
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:57,840
Hey!

312
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:02,320
You all are Browncoats, eh? Fought for independence?

313
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,449
Petty thieving ain't exactly soldiers' work.

314
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:08,825
War's long done. We're all just folk now. Listen up!

315
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:11,259
We are coming down to empty that vault!

316
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:14,199
(guard) You have to give me your authorization password!

317
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,330
(guard) Okay.

318
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:35,587
I'm telling you I heard it. Repeater.

319
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:39,925
Did sound somewhat like gun blast. Maybe you ought run tell Lawman.

320
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:41,750
[screaming]

321
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,392
What the hell is up? You all right?

322
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,861
What's going on?

323
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:50,563
Reavers.

324
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:00,907
The leg is good. It'll bleed plenty and we avoid any necessary organs.

325
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,347
I was thinking more of a graze.

326
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,247
No, you don't want it to look like you gave up.

327
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:05,512
No, I get that.

328
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:06,951
(Jayne) Mal!

329
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:09,318
Every heist, he's got to start yelling my name.

330
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,257
Mal! Reavers!

331
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:15,221
The girl's pitching a fit. They're here or they're coming soon.

332
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:16,695
Get on the Mule.

333
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,562
Does that lock from the inside? Yes.

334
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:22,125
Get everyone upstairs. You get them down here and you seal it.

335
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:24,763
As long as you got air you don't open up, you understand?

336
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,933
Get them inside the vault!

337
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:31,167
You see them? Zoe, take the wheel!

338
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:32,610
(Jayne) Anybody see them?

339
00:20:39,086 --> 00:20:40,314
Take me with you!

340
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:42,049
Get back in the vault with the others.

341
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:45,058
I can't stay here! Please! It's too many. Move ahead.

How come they ain't blowing us out the air?

347
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:37,209
They wanna run us down. The up-close kill.

348
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:41,041
They want us alive when they eat us.

349
00:21:41,482 --> 00:21:45,475
Boy, sure would be nice if we had some grenades, don't you think?

You got somebody behind you? Reavers.

We're not gonna get to you in time. Keep moving, honey.

We're coming to you.

Get some distance on them.

You come to the flats, I want you to swing round.

We're gonna try a Barn Swallow.

Hello?

00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,432
No casualties.

That's a negative. Clean getaway.

384
00:24:57,144 --> 00:25:01,478
Set course for Beaumonde. First thing, I want this body--

You son of a whore. I'm a hair's breadth...

388
00:25:07,388 --> 00:25:08,719
from riddling you with holes, Doctor.

389
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:12,247
One simple job! She'll be fine! She is fine!

390
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:14,453
Except for being still crazy, she's a picture of health!

391
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:18,225
Wasn't for River, we'd probably be left there. She felt them coming.

392
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,492
(Simon) Never again. You understand me?

393
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:23,366
Seems I remember a talk about you giving orders on my boat.

394
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:24,995
Well, we're off your boat.

395
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:27,540
Just as soon as River gets her share of the bounty.

396
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,372
Let's not do anything hasty-- No, shiny!

397
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:32,236
We'll be on Beaumonde in 10 hours' time...

398
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:35,180
you can pick up your earnings and be on your merry.

399
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:38,282
Meantime, you do your job.

400
00:25:39,186 --> 00:25:40,744
Patch up my crew.

401
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,717
He didn't lie down.

402
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:48,154
They never lie down.

403
00:25:56,937 --> 00:25:59,337
(Zoe) No, I think things will glide a deal smoother for us...

404
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:01,374
without River and Simon on board...

405
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:02,841
but how long do you think they'll last?

406
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,468
Doc made his call.

407
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:05,534
Yeah.

408
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:07,444
They's as babes in a basket when we took them in.

409
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:09,345
We sheltered them plenty.

410
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:12,749
Man has to cut loose, learn to stand on his own.

411
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:16,419
Like that man back in town?

412
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:20,825
I had to shoot him.

413
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:22,885
What Reavers would've done before they killed him--

414
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:25,454
I know. That was a piece of mercy.

415
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,269
But before that, him begging us to bring him along.

416
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:33,372
We couldn't take the weight. Would've slowed us down.

417
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,705
You know that for certain? Mule won't run with five.

418
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:41,109
I should've dumped the girl? Or you? Or Jayne?

419
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:42,578
Oh, Jayne....

420
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,348
You could've tossed the payload. Tossed the....

421
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:51,320
Zoe, I got bits falling off my ship, I got a crew ain't been paid...

422
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:54,361
and, oh, yeah, a powerful need to eat sometime this month.

423
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:56,490
We tell Fanty and Mingo we skunked the job...

424
00:26:56,563 --> 00:26:58,554
what do think they'll do to us?

425
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:02,334
We're close to gone out here.

426
00:27:03,504 --> 00:27:05,938
We get a job, we got to make good.

427
00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:09,135
Sir, I don't disagree on any particular point.

428
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:12,071
It's just...

429
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:18,480
in the time of war, we would've never left a man stranded.

430
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,616
Maybe that's why we lost.

431
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:32,659
That was close.

432
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:36,367
(Jayne) I do not get it.

433
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:39,034
How's a guy get so wrong?

434
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:42,597
Cutting on his own face, raping and murdering.

435
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:47,503
I'll kill a man in a fair fight...

436
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:50,840
or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight...

437
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:55,212
or if he bothers me, or if there's a woman...

438
00:27:55,656 --> 00:28:00,491
or if I'm getting paid. Mostly only when I'm getting paid.

439
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:04,358
These Reavers, the last 10 years...

440
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:07,264
they show up like the boogeyman from stories.

441
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:11,567
Eating people alive? Where does that get fun?

442
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:15,505
Shepherd Book said they was men who just...

443
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:18,943
reached the edge of space, saw a vasty nothingness...

444
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:21,003
and went bibbledy over it.

445
00:28:21,148 --> 00:28:22,137
Oh, hell.

446
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,475
I've been to the edge.

447
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:30,054
Just looked like more space.

448
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:32,457
I don't know.

449
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,892
It can get awful lonely in the black.

450
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:39,655
Like to get addlepated ourselves, we stay on this boat much longer.

451
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:42,925
Captain will drive us all off, one by one.

452
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,561
Just like Simon and River.

453
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:48,808

(Kaylee) We got to have records of everything, Inara.

456
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:59,517
A bona fide companion entertained clients on this very ship.

457
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:03,420
In this very bed. Well, I can't do my work here.

458
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,515
And I don't think the Captain approves.

459
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:07,184
The Captain wants you to stay--

460
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:10,628

No.

When he's four worlds away?

Or the Alliance gets a hold of him and River?

(Mal) That ain't my worry.

I got to finish this job and get us another one.

00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:22,455
But he could have made them family.

489
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:25,427
Instead of keeping Simon from seeing I was there.

490
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:29,067
When I carried such a torch, when we could've....

491
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:32,469
We're going on a year now, I ain't had nothing twixt my nethers...

493
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:36,404
Oh, God! I can't know that!

494
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:38,634
I could stand to hear a little more.

495
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:40,974
If you had a care for anybody's heart--

496
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,675
You knew he was gonna leave.

497
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:44,546
We never been but a way station to those two.

498
00:31:44,618 --> 00:31:46,245
And how do you know what he feels?

499
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,289
He's got River to worry on but he still could've shown you....

500
00:31:49,356 --> 00:31:51,620
If I truly wanted someone bad enough...

501
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:55,287
wouldn't be a thing in the 'verse could stop me from going to her.

502
00:31:55,796 --> 00:31:57,457
Tell that to lnara.

503
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:03,935
Domestic troubles?

504
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:05,968
Domestic troubles?

505
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:09,199
'Cause we don't wanna interrupt.

He's Mingo. He's Fanty. You're Mingo.

509
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:19,676
How is it you always know? Fanty's prettier.

510
00:32:19,987 --> 00:32:21,784
Feel to do some business?

512
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:39,732
(Mingo) Quite a crew you've got.

513
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:41,898
Yeah, they're a fine bunch of reubens.

514
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:44,375
How you keep them on that crap boat, is the subject...

515
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:46,241
of much musing between me and Fanty.

516
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:48,645
We go on and on. So I'm noticing.

517
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:51,844
Is there a problem we don't know of?

518
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:54,110
You got a sweet take kissing your foot.

519

How's about you take your 25%, we can talk about the next job?

520
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:59,348
Well, our end is 40, precious.

(Fanty) You're unpredictable, Mal.

527
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:15,141
You run when you ought to fight.

I believe you've got some storytelling to do.

00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:04,526
What in the hell happened back there?

555
00:37:04,604 --> 00:37:07,471
Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a 90-pound girl.

'Cause I don't think that's ever getting old.

557
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,636
Do we know if anyone was killed? It's likely.

558
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,539
I know she meant to kill me before the Doc put her out.

559
00:37:16,616 --> 00:37:19,107
Which, how exactly does that work anyhow?

560
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:22,053
It's a safe word.

561
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,685
The people who helped me break River out...

562
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:28,057
had intel that River and the other subjects were being...

563
00:37:28,128 --> 00:37:30,392
embedded with behavioral conditioning.

564
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,430
They taught me a safe word...

565
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:35,533
in case something happened. Not sure I get it.

566
00:37:35,835 --> 00:37:38,429
It's a phrase that makes her fall asleep.

567
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:41,901
If I speak the words-- Don't say it!

568
00:37:42,108 --> 00:37:44,008
It only works on her, Jayne.

569
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:47,738
Well, now I know that.

00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:50,008
"ln case something happened."

571
00:37:50,383 --> 00:37:52,681
You feel to elaborate on what that something might be?

572
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:55,448
They never said what-- And you never did ask.

573

Get your hands off--

574
00:37:58,258 --> 00:38:00,886
Eight months. Eight months, you had her on my boat...

575
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,518
knowing full well she could go monkeyshit...

576
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:04,085
at the wrong word. You never said a thing.

577
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:07,031
I brought her out here so they couldn't get to her.

578
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,866
I don't even know what they-- My ship!

580
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:14,329
You had a gorramn time bomb living with us!

Who we gonna find in there when she wakes up?

00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:20,301
The girl?

583
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:22,376
Or the weapon?

584
00:38:23,149 --> 00:38:25,049
I thought she was getting better.

585
00:38:25,118 --> 00:38:27,143
And I thought they was getting off!

586
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:32,923
Didn't we have an intricate plan how they was gonna be not here anymore?

587
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:36,085
We couldn't leave them now. (Jayne) No, now that...

588
00:38:36,363 --> 00:38:40,595
she's a killer woman we ought be bringing her tea and dumplings.

589
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:44,161
In earnest, Mal, why'd you bring her back on?

She goes woolly again, we're gonna have to put a bullet to her.

It's crossed my mind.

593
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,888
Can I make a suggestion that doesn't involve violence...

594
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:11,987
or is this the wrong crowd? Honey.

595
00:39:12,065 --> 00:39:14,590
We're flying a lot blinder than usual here.

596
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:16,498

That's what we're looking to learn. Is there any follow up, a newswave?

604
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:02,544
There is no news. There's the truth of the signal.

Well, what about this? Did this make the puppet theater?

608
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,855
No, sir. And no lawforce flags, either.

609
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:17,863
I had to go into the security feed direct.

610
00:40:17,931 --> 00:40:20,832
You can do that? Can't stop the signal, Mal.

Everything goes somewhere, and I go everywhere.

Security feeds are a traipse to access...

00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:28,234
and I wasn't the first one in.

614
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:31,607
This has prints on it. So somebody else has been fed this.

I have a commitment to my Lovebot.

618
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:46,524
It was a very beautiful ceremony. Lenore wrote her own vows...

619
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:50,555
I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby.

620
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:57,466
And she falls asleep. Which, she would be sleepy.

621
00:40:57,837 --> 00:40:58,929
Can you go back?

622
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:00,870
See if anybody spoke with her before she acted up.

623
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,067
Made any kind of contact with her.

Subliminal.

632
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:36,835
It's a subliminal message, broadwaved to trigger her.

It's Alliance and it's high military.

I'm sorry. They should be.

But I'll show them. Oh, God.

I don't know what I'm saying. I never know what I'm saying.

646
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:38,132
In the Maidenhead, you said something.

647
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:41,470
When you were triggered, do you remember?

648

00:42:45,912 --> 00:42:47,209
Miranda.

650
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:49,804
Miranda.

651
00:42:51,718 --> 00:42:53,379
Ask her.

652
00:42:55,455 --> 00:42:57,218
Who is Miranda?

653
00:43:01,861 --> 00:43:04,728
Am I talking to Miranda now?

654
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:08,656
No.

655
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,628
Not right.

656
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:18,466
But I think when they triggered you...

657
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:21,280
it somehow brought this up.

658
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:23,907
This memory. It isn't mine.

659
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,911
The memory, it isn't mine.

660
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:28,886
And I shouldn't have to carry it. It isn't mine.

661
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:31,554
Don't make me sleep again. I won't.

662
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:33,414
I won't.

663
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:35,717
Put a bullet to me.

664
00:43:36,763 --> 00:43:39,357
Bullet in the brainpan, squish.

665
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:44,097
Don't say that. Not ever.

666
00:43:46,706 --> 00:43:48,367
We'll get through this.

667
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,906
Things are going to get much, much worse.

668
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,751
[birds chirping]

669
00:44:01,954 --> 00:44:03,285
[water running]

670
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:50,232
(Mal) Thanks for taking us in again, Shepherd.

671
00:44:50,937 --> 00:44:52,234
(Shepherd) You got a plan?

672
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:54,337
Hiding ain't a plan?

673
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:56,068
It'll do you for a spell.

674
00:44:56,142 --> 00:44:58,269
And the folks here'll be glad of the extra coin.

675
00:44:58,344 --> 00:45:00,369
But the Alliance will be coming.

676
00:45:00,613 --> 00:45:03,173
They're after this girl with a powerful will.

677
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,817
I look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment.

678
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,280
[bird hooting]

679
00:45:09,255 --> 00:45:10,586
You won't.

680
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:15,655
This isn't a palms-up military run, Mal.

681
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,859
No reports broadwaved...

682
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,759
no warrants.

683
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:23,634
Much as they want her, they want her hid.

684
00:45:24,237 --> 00:45:26,137
That means closed file.

685
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:28,506
Means an operative.

686
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:31,602
Which is trouble you've not known.

687
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:35,911
I could have left her there.

688
00:45:38,284 --> 00:45:39,512
I had an out.

689
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,446
Hell, I had every reason in the 'verse...

690
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,683
to leave her lay and haul anchor.

691
00:45:45,725 --> 00:45:47,386
It's not your way, Mal.

692
00:45:48,861 --> 00:45:50,158
I have a way?

693
00:45:51,197 --> 00:45:52,892
That better than a plan?

694
00:45:53,432 --> 00:45:56,697
Only one thing is gonna walk you through this, Mal.

695
00:45:58,671 --> 00:45:59,660
Belief.

696
00:46:01,607 --> 00:46:03,802
You know I always look to you for counsel...

697
00:46:03,876 --> 00:46:06,071
but sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd.

698
00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:09,111
I ain't looking for help from on high.

699
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:12,579
That's a long wait for a train don't come.

700
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:16,611
When I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God?

701
00:46:22,562 --> 00:46:24,757
They'll come at you sideways.

702
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:27,999
It's how they think. It's how they move.

703
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:33,002
Sidle up and smile. Hit you where you're weak.

704
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,575
Sort of man they're like to send believes hard.

705
00:46:38,778 --> 00:46:40,803
Kills and never asks why.

706
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:48,752
It's of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world.

707
00:46:48,821 --> 00:46:50,948
I wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal.

708
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:53,287
Have to tell me about that sometime.

709
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:54,415
[sighing]

710
00:46:55,161 --> 00:46:56,685
No, I don't.

711
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:01,693
(woman) River?

712
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:02,791
[birds chirping]

713
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:04,530
River, you look tired.

714
00:47:04,837 --> 00:47:08,603
I think everybody's a little tired by now. Why don't we all lie down.

715
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:12,611
A little peace and quiet will make everything better.

716
00:47:12,778 --> 00:47:15,338
River. Do as you're told. No.

717
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:18,008
It's going to be fine. Lie down. No.

718
00:47:22,388 --> 00:47:23,650
(man) Cut them down.

719
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,292
What? (Wash) Mal! You up?

720
00:47:31,163 --> 00:47:33,791
I got a wave. I'm gonna bounce it down to you.

721
00:47:39,238 --> 00:47:40,227
Inara.

722
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:44,040
I.... Is this a bad time?

723
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:46,070
No, this...

724
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:47,806
good as any.

725
00:47:48,314 --> 00:47:51,044
How's your world? Cold. It's autumn here.

726
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,381
Still at the Training House?

727
00:47:54,854 --> 00:47:55,843
[clearing throat]

728
00:47:57,356 --> 00:48:01,486
So, what occasions the wave? Not that to see you ain't....

729
00:48:03,396 --> 00:48:06,456
Well, you look very fine. Oh. Thank you.

730
00:48:06,832 --> 00:48:08,629
(Mal) So, what was the....

731
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:14,368
I guess we're having something of a problem here with the locals.

732
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,034
And, I thought maybe-- You could use a gun hand?

733
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:21,273
I'm hoping not. But if you happen to be close at all, you....

734
00:48:21,414 --> 00:48:25,407
The crew could take your ease here for a while. And there'd be payment.

735
00:48:28,054 --> 00:48:31,285
Well, it would be.... I mean, I'd like to.

736
00:48:35,594 --> 00:48:38,154
Kaylee's been missing you something fierce.

737
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,891
(all) Oh, man. I miss her, too.

738
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:42,059
I even miss my shuttle, occasionally.

739
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:44,227
Yeah, you left, um....

740
00:48:44,603 --> 00:48:46,332
Got some of your stuff in a trunk.

741
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:47,929
I never did get a chance to drop it off.

742
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:52,273
I didn't mean to leave stuff. I didn't look through the stuff.

743
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:55,808
I just.... Just sundries I expect.

744
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:01,516
So I'll send you a wave, soon as I can.

745
00:49:02,254 --> 00:49:03,414
Thank you.

746
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:15,232
Inara, nice to see her again.

747
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:19,569
So, trap? Trap.

748
00:49:20,106 --> 00:49:22,768
We going in? Only but a few hours out.

749
00:49:23,376 --> 00:49:26,368
Yeah, but, remember the part where it's a trap?

750
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:29,013
If that's the case, then lnara's already caught in it.

751
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:31,072
She wouldn't set us up willing.

752
00:49:31,317 --> 00:49:34,184
Might be we got a shot at seeing who's turning these wheels.

753
00:49:34,253 --> 00:49:35,277
We go in.

754
00:49:35,354 --> 00:49:38,687
But how can you be sure lnara don't just wanna see you?

755
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:42,025
Sometimes people have feelings.

756
00:49:42,194 --> 00:49:44,219
I'm referring here to people.

757
00:49:45,998 --> 00:49:48,091
You all were watching, I take it.

758
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:51,765
Yes. Did you see us fight?

759
00:49:52,004 --> 00:49:53,562
No. Trap.

760
00:50:01,547 --> 00:50:05,381
We're about 70 miles from the Training House, and nobody on radar.

761
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:07,919
If the Alliance is about, they're laying low.

762
00:50:07,987 --> 00:50:09,147
They're about.

763
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:11,246
Find us a home. I'll take the shuttle a little closer.

764
00:50:11,323 --> 00:50:12,984
Zoe, ship is yours.

765
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:15,584
Remember. If anything happens to me...

766
00:50:15,661 --> 00:50:17,390
or if you don't hear from me within the hour...

767
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:19,727
you take this ship and you come and you rescue me.

768
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:20,788
What?

769
00:50:21,434 --> 00:50:23,732
Risk my ship? I mean it.

770
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,900
It's cold out there. And I don't wanna get left.

771
00:50:43,756 --> 00:50:47,123
Dear Buddha, please bring me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and--

772
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:49,093
Mal! What are you doing here?

773
00:50:49,695 --> 00:50:50,889
Well, you invited me.

774
00:50:50,963 --> 00:50:53,523
I never thought for a second you'd be stupid enough to come.

775
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,464
Well, that makes you kind of a tease, doesn't it?

776
00:50:55,534 --> 00:50:57,468
You knew my invitation wasn't on the level.

777
00:50:57,536 --> 00:51:00,505
Which led me to conclude that you must be in some trouble.

778
00:51:00,573 --> 00:51:02,336
I'm fine. I'm giddy.

779
00:51:02,408 --> 00:51:04,842
For a woman schooled in telling a man what he wants to hear...

780
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:08,402
you ain't much of a liar. Mal, you cannot handle this man.

781
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:15,647
I have to say, Captain...

782
00:51:15,721 --> 00:51:18,588
I'm impressed that you would come for her yourself.

783
00:51:18,924 --> 00:51:22,018
And that you would make it this far, in that outfit.

784
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:25,493
I can be very graceful when I need to.

785
00:51:25,564 --> 00:51:26,929
I've no doubt.

786
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:31,030
What are you doing? I'm praying for you, Mal.

787
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,533
She's very thoughtful.

788
00:51:33,973 --> 00:51:36,942
But I mean it when I say I've no intent to harm you.

789
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:39,337
Speak your piece.

790
00:51:39,812 --> 00:51:41,677
I think you're beginning to understand...

791
00:51:41,747 --> 00:51:43,715
how dangerous River Tam is.

792
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:45,880
She is a mite unpredictable.

793
00:51:46,152 --> 00:51:48,052
Mood swings, of a sort.

794
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,645
It's worse than you know. It usually is.

795
00:51:50,723 --> 00:51:54,352
That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship.

796
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:58,525
She is an albatross, Captain.

797
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:00,426
Way I remember it...

798
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:03,866
albatross was a ship's good luck, till some idiot killed it.

799
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:07,099
Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to faint.

800
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,471
I've seen your war record.

801
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:13,002
I know how you must feel about the Alliance.

802
00:52:13,279 --> 00:52:15,474
You really don't. Fair to say.

803
00:52:16,215 --> 00:52:19,048
But I have to hope you understand, you can't beat us.

804
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:20,847
I got no need to beat you.

805
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,787
I just want to go my way. And you can do that...

806
00:52:24,623 --> 00:52:27,649
once you let me take River Tam back home.

807
00:52:31,363 --> 00:52:33,888
No, no. You're working this deal all crabbed.

808
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:36,695
You got to open with payment. That is a trap.

809
00:52:36,835 --> 00:52:40,396
I offer money, you'll play the man of honor and take umbrage.

810
00:52:40,606 --> 00:52:43,234
I ask you to do what is right, you'll play the brigand.

811
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:45,834
I have no stomach for games.

812
00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:48,336
I already know you will not see reason.

813
00:52:48,414 --> 00:52:49,972
The Alliance wanted to show me a reason...

814
00:52:50,049 --> 00:52:52,244
they shouldn't have sent an assassin.

815
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,584
I have a warship in deep orbit, Captain.

816
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:05,788
We locked on to Serenity's pulse beacon the moment you hit atmo.

817
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:07,956
I can speak a word and send a missile...

818
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:10,729
to that exact location inside of three minutes.

819
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:11,963
You do that...

820
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:15,939
you'd best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord.

821
00:53:19,712 --> 00:53:20,940
Pulse beacon.

822
00:53:21,213 --> 00:53:25,172
Advice from an old tracker. You want to find someone, use your eyes.

823
00:53:25,718 --> 00:53:27,982
How long do you think you can really run from us?

824
00:53:28,053 --> 00:53:30,681
I never credited the Alliance with an overabundance of brains.

825
00:53:30,756 --> 00:53:32,917
And if you're the best they got-- Captain Reynolds...

826
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:35,790
I should tell you, so that you don't waste your time...

827
00:53:35,861 --> 00:53:39,820
you can't make me angry. Please, spend an hour with him.

828
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:43,363
I want to resolve this like civilized men.

829
00:53:44,436 --> 00:53:46,336
I'm not threatening you.

830
00:53:46,705 --> 00:53:48,172
I'm unarmed. Good.

831
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,434
[gun firing]

832
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,338
I am, of course, wearing full body armor.

833
00:53:55,414 --> 00:53:57,746
I am not a moron. (lnara) Wait, just let--

What, no backup?

841
00:54:27,946 --> 00:54:31,143
Making an awful ruckus. They'll come when they're needed.

842
00:54:31,216 --> 00:54:32,649
I'd start whistling.

843
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:35,948
Captain, what do you think is going to happen here?

844
00:54:38,757 --> 00:54:40,384
[both grunting]

Nothing here is what it seems. He isn't the plucky hero.

850
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,899
The Alliance isn't some evil empire. This is not the grand arena.

851
00:55:32,144 --> 00:55:33,771
And that's not incense.

852

00:55:40,786 --> 00:55:41,980
Sir, can you hear me?

854
00:55:42,054 --> 00:55:44,579
Just a flash bomb. Go. Go!

00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:47,384
[lnara and Mal grunting]

856

What have you done to my shuttle? It's not your shuttle.

857
00:55:53,899 --> 00:55:55,764
Head east. Keep her low.

[engine revving]

859
00:56:11,617 --> 00:56:13,414
Okay, forget the pulse beacon.

860
00:56:13,485 --> 00:56:15,646
There must be another way to track the ship.

861
00:56:15,721 --> 00:56:17,120
Get a read on the nav. sat.

862
00:56:17,189 --> 00:56:19,749
It's a registered transport, you must be able to locate.

863
00:56:19,825 --> 00:56:20,814
(ensign) Sir?

864
00:56:20,893 --> 00:56:22,758
Yes, have you found a nav. sat. trajectory?

865
00:56:22,828 --> 00:56:25,262
Sir, we found seven.

866
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:34,734
(Inara) We've every reason to be afraid.

867
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,132
Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal? That ain't so hard.

868
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,735
He didn't beat me up. Nobody said that.

869
00:56:40,813 --> 00:56:42,576
Because he's a believer.

870
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:47,252
He's intelligent, methodical, and devout in his belief...

871
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:49,719
that killing River is the right thing to do.

872
00:56:49,788 --> 00:56:52,348
So no hope of a reward, huh?

873
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:56,728
Did he say anything about a Miranda?

874
00:56:57,529 --> 00:56:58,587
What is that?

875
00:56:58,664 --> 00:57:01,064
Don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind.

876
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:03,124
Conjure it might be the reason they're after her.

877
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:06,103
You think maybe it poses some kind of threat to the Alliance?

878
00:57:06,171 --> 00:57:07,536
Do we care?

879
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,635
Are we caring about that?

880
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:12,370
You dumb-ass hogs, the only people she's a threat to is...

881
00:57:12,444 --> 00:57:13,934
us on this boat.

882
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:15,843
Look, we get back to Haven...

883
00:57:15,914 --> 00:57:16,938
in a few hours' time. Oh, yeah.

884
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:18,312
Hiding under the Shepherd's skirts...

885
00:57:18,383 --> 00:57:19,407
that's a manful scheme.

886
00:57:19,485 --> 00:57:21,510
You wanna run this ship? Yes.

887
00:57:22,588 --> 00:57:24,385
Well, you can't.

888
00:57:25,123 --> 00:57:27,318
Do a damn sight better job than you.

889
00:57:27,426 --> 00:57:29,860
Getting us lashed over a couple of strays.

890
00:57:30,095 --> 00:57:32,086
No offense, Doc. I think it's noble as a grape...

891
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:33,392
the way you look to River.

892
00:57:33,465 --> 00:57:35,933
But she ain't my sister and she ain't your crew.

893
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:38,367
Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless.

894
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:41,262
So, where's it writ that we got to lay down our lives for her?

895
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,898
Which is what you've steered us toward.

896
00:57:42,975 --> 00:57:44,704
I didn't start this.

897
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:46,868
No, that's right.

898
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:51,376
Alliance starts the war, and then you volunteer.

899
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:55,013
Battle of Serenity, Mal.

900
00:57:55,087 --> 00:57:58,318
Besides Zoe here, how many.... Hey, I'm talking at you.

901
00:58:02,361 --> 00:58:05,387
How many men in your platoon came out of there alive?

902
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:10,761
You wanna leave this room.

903
00:58:13,605 --> 00:58:15,334
Damn right, I do.

904
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:24,706
This isn't the war, Mal.

905
00:58:25,584 --> 00:58:27,814
You telling me that 'cause you think I don't know?

906
00:58:27,886 --> 00:58:30,013
You came to the Training House looking for a fight.

907
00:58:30,088 --> 00:58:31,988
I came looking for you.

908
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:35,760
I just want to know who I'm dealing with.

909
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:38,489
I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.

910
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:42,996
I start fighting a war, I guarantee you'll see something new.

911
00:58:50,175 --> 00:58:51,403
We'll get off.

912
00:58:51,476 --> 00:58:53,103
River and I will get off at Haven.

913
00:58:53,178 --> 00:58:54,941
We'll find some-- Nobody's saying that.

914
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:56,844
Nobody besides Jayne is saying that.

915

Mal.

916
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:03,479
I got no answers for you, lnara. I got no rudder.

917
00:59:03,555 --> 00:59:06,524
Wind blows northerly, I go north. That's who I am.

918
00:59:06,592 --> 00:59:09,152
Now, maybe that ain't a man to lead, but they have to follow.

919
00:59:09,227 --> 00:59:10,319
So you wanna tear me down...

920
00:59:10,395 --> 00:59:12,556
do it inside your own mind. I'm not trying to tear you down.

921
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:14,223
But you fog things up.

922
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,728
You always have.

923
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:19,803
You spin me about.

924
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:25,169
I wish like hell you was elsewhere.

925
00:59:27,379 --> 00:59:28,471
I was.

We're going for a nice shuttle ride.

She's out. Jayne's down.

936
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:31,292
The other way. Find her and do not engage.

01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:55,149
It's gonna be okay--

[coughs]

940
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:07,899
She's sealed off the bridge. I do not like her there.

941
01:02:07,973 --> 01:02:09,668
Check the shuttle. She could have snuck in.

942

[computer beeps]

944
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:59,690
The government's man, he says you're a danger to us.

945
01:03:00,692 --> 01:03:02,319
Not worth helping.

946
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,090
Is he right?

947
01:03:07,432 --> 01:03:09,832
Are you anything but a weapon?

948
01:03:13,005 --> 01:03:16,099
I've staked my crew's life on the theory you're a person...

949
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:19,372
actual and whole, and if I'm wrong, you'd best shoot me now.

[clicks]

951
01:03:20,612 --> 01:03:22,477
Or we could talk more.

952
01:03:33,525 --> 01:03:34,617
Miranda.

953
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:41,130
How can it be there's a whole planet called Miranda...

954
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,462
and none of us knowed that?

955
01:03:42,534 --> 01:03:45,901
Because there isn't one. It's a blackrock. Uninhabitable.

956
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:49,465
Terraforming didn't hold, or some such. Few settlers died.

957
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:51,065
(Zoe) Was it right before the war?

958
01:03:51,143 --> 01:03:55,011
I had to show them. I didn't know if you were going to make me sleep.

959
01:03:56,715 --> 01:03:58,808
You could have asked. (Kaylee) Wait a tick, yeah.

960
01:03:58,884 --> 01:04:02,547
Some years back, there was call for workers to settle on Miranda.

961
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:04,384
Daddy talked about it. Nothing about it...

962
01:04:04,456 --> 01:04:06,481
on the Cortex. History, Astronomy, it's not in there.

963
01:04:06,558 --> 01:04:08,890
Half of writing history is hiding the truth.

964
01:04:08,961 --> 01:04:11,896
There's something on that rock the Alliance doesn't want known.

965
01:04:11,964 --> 01:04:14,159
That's right at the edge of the Burnham Quadrant, right?

966
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:16,565
Furthest planet out? It's not that far from here.

967
01:04:16,635 --> 01:04:18,364
Whoa. No. No. Honey... That's a bad notion.

968
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,803
...you show them the bad. I got it, baby.

969
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,105
(Zoe) This is us, at Haven, and here's Miranda.

970
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,877
All along here, that empty space in between, that's Reaver territory.

971
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,646
They just float out there, sending out raiding parties.

972
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,018
Nobody ventures there. Not even the Alliance.

973
01:04:37,089 --> 01:04:39,353
You go through that, you're signing up to be a banquet.

974
01:04:39,424 --> 01:04:42,052
I'm on board with our standard run-and-hide scenario.

975
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:43,856
And we are just about....

976
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,619
Wait.

977
01:05:03,015 --> 01:05:05,142
(Jayne) Doesn't look like Reavers. Wasn't.

978
01:05:10,989 --> 01:05:11,978
(Kaylee) Shepherd?

979
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:14,918
Shepherd?

980
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:17,523
(Kaylee) Shepherd Book?

981
01:05:35,647 --> 01:05:36,636
[cocking gun]

982
01:05:36,715 --> 01:05:37,704
[man coughing]

983
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,016
Get the Doc.

984
01:05:41,453 --> 01:05:42,442
Shepherd.

985
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,510
[gasping]

986
01:05:43,622 --> 01:05:46,489
Don't move. Won't go far.

987
01:05:48,994 --> 01:05:50,985
Shouldn't have been you.

988
01:05:51,797 --> 01:05:54,425
Alliance should've hit us. Should've hit me.

989
01:05:55,801 --> 01:05:57,530
That crossed my mind.

990
01:06:02,074 --> 01:06:05,202
I shot him down. Yeah. I see.

991
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:08,004
I killed the ship that killed us.

992
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:11,716
Not very Christian of me.

993
01:06:12,184 --> 01:06:13,708
You did what's right.

994
01:06:14,186 --> 01:06:18,247
Coming from you, that means almost nothing.

995
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:26,389
I'm long gone. No, Doc will bring you around.

996
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:29,366
I look to be bored by many more sermons before you slip.

997
01:06:29,434 --> 01:06:30,696
Just don't move.

998
01:06:31,336 --> 01:06:33,133
Can't order me around, boy.

999
01:06:34,406 --> 01:06:36,169
I'm not one of your crew.

1000
01:06:38,276 --> 01:06:39,675
Yes, you are.

1001
01:06:42,514 --> 01:06:44,379
River.... Come on.

1002
01:06:44,816 --> 01:06:45,805
Hey.

1003
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:51,545
I don't care what you believe. Just believe it.

1004
01:06:53,225 --> 01:06:55,022
Whatever you....

1005
01:07:28,493 --> 01:07:30,518
How come they ain't waiting?

1006
01:07:31,696 --> 01:07:34,665
They knowed we was coming, how come they only sent one?

1007
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:38,133
They didn't know we were coming here.

1008
01:07:38,937 --> 01:07:40,632
Get on the Cortex.

1009
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:42,604
Wave, Li Shen, the Sanchez brothers...

1010
01:07:42,674 --> 01:07:46,166
anyone who has ever sheltered us after a heist. Tell them to get out.

1011
01:07:46,244 --> 01:07:47,472
Get out now.

1012
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,817
I'm sorry.

1013
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,726
If your quarry goes to ground, leave no ground to go to.

1014
01:08:06,865 --> 01:08:08,890
You should have taken my offer.

1015
01:08:08,967 --> 01:08:11,527
Or did you think none of this was your fault?

1016
01:08:11,803 --> 01:08:13,771
I don't murder children.

1017
01:08:14,172 --> 01:08:15,161
I do.

1018
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:18,133
If I have to. Why?

1019
01:08:20,011 --> 01:08:22,172
Do you even know why they sent you?

1020
01:08:22,948 --> 01:08:24,711
It's not my place to ask.

1021
01:08:25,951 --> 01:08:28,476
I believe in something greater than myself.

1022
01:08:29,588 --> 01:08:30,987
A better world.

1023
01:08:31,623 --> 01:08:33,454
A world without sin.

1024
01:08:33,992 --> 01:08:35,983
So me and mine gotta lay down and die...

1025
01:08:36,061 --> 01:08:38,256
so you can live in your better world?

1026
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,857
I'm not going to live there.

1027
01:08:41,266 --> 01:08:42,858
There's no place for me there...

1028
01:08:42,934 --> 01:08:45,402
any more than there is for you. Malcolm...

1029
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:46,832
I'm a monster.

1030
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:49,804
What I do is evil.

1031
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,435
I have no illusions about it, but it must be done.

1032
01:08:52,511 --> 01:08:53,978
Keep talking.

1033
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:56,338
You're not getting a location trace off this wave.

1034
01:08:56,414 --> 01:09:00,316
And every minute you keep River Tam from me, more people will die.

1035
01:09:00,385 --> 01:09:02,876
You think I care? Of course you care.

1036
01:09:03,855 --> 01:09:05,584
You're not a Reaver, Mal.

1037
01:09:06,091 --> 01:09:09,549
You're a human man and you will never understand how--

1038
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:17,631
Get these bodies together.

1039
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:19,467
(Zoe) We got time for grave digging?

1040
01:09:19,538 --> 01:09:21,028
Zoe, you and Simon rope them together.

1041
01:09:21,106 --> 01:09:23,472
Five or six. I want them laid out on the nose of our ship.

1042
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:24,668
Are you insane?

1043
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,040
I won't desecrate these bodies.

1044
01:09:26,111 --> 01:09:27,976
I don't understand. What do you mean, the bodies--

1045
01:09:28,046 --> 01:09:29,479
I want you to muck up the reactor core.

1046
01:09:29,548 --> 01:09:31,573
Just enough to leave a trail and make it read like...

1047
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,811
we're flying without containment, not enough to fry us.

1048
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:35,682
These people are our friends. Kaylee...

1049
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:38,587
you got a day's work to do and two hours to do it.

1050
01:09:39,624 --> 01:09:43,890
Jayne, you and Wash hoist up the cannon mount. Goes right on top.

1051
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:45,623
Piece or two of the other ship, stick it on.

1052
01:09:45,697 --> 01:09:48,928
Any place you can tear hull without inner breach, do that, too.

1053
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:53,033
We're gonna need paint. We're gonna need red paint.

1054
01:09:53,538 --> 01:09:54,527
Sir...

1055
01:09:55,006 --> 01:09:58,464
do you really mean to turn our home into an abomination...

1056
01:09:58,543 --> 01:10:00,340
so that we can make a suicidal attempt...

1057
01:10:00,412 --> 01:10:02,437
at passing through Reaver space?

1058
01:10:02,547 --> 01:10:03,844
I mean to live.

1059
01:10:04,282 --> 01:10:05,715
[man coughing] I mean for us to live.

1060
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:08,378
The Alliance won't have that, so we go where they don't follow.

1061
01:10:08,453 --> 01:10:10,614
God's balls, there ain't no way we're going out there.

1062
01:10:10,689 --> 01:10:12,384
Mal, think about what you're asking.

1063
01:10:12,457 --> 01:10:14,652
(Jayne) ...those Reavers'll eat us alive--

1064
01:10:16,394 --> 01:10:17,793
This is how it is.

1065
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:19,925
Anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore...

1066
01:10:19,998 --> 01:10:21,829
this is your port of harbor.

1067
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:24,726
There's a lot of fine ways to die.

1068
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:27,533
I ain't waiting for the Alliance to choose mine.

1069

[gun firing]

1070

I mean to confound these bungers.

1071
01:10:32,644 --> 01:10:34,305
Take my shot at getting to Miranda.

1072
01:10:34,379 --> 01:10:36,973
Maybe find something I can use to get clear of this.

1073
01:10:37,048 --> 01:10:39,949
So I hear a word out of any of you that ain't helping me out...

1074
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:42,509
or taking your leave, I will shoot you down.

1075
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:48,756
Get to work.

1076

1077
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,251
Just tell me when we're close.

(Mal) Wash.

1080
01:13:30,088 --> 01:13:33,319
Define "disappeared."

1081
01:13:38,062 --> 01:13:40,326
(Zoe) Every reading I'm getting says normal.

1082
01:13:41,065 --> 01:13:44,398
Oceans, land masses. No tectonic instability or radiation.

1083
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:47,438
Yeah, but no power, either. Nothing at all?

1084
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:48,494
Wait.

1085
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:50,266
Something.

1086
01:13:51,342 --> 01:13:53,810
It might be a beacon, but it's awful weak.

1087
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:55,912
Find it.

1088
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:05,849
Gravity's Earthnorm.

1089

O2 levels check, pressure....

If anything's wrong the scanner's not reading it.

1091
01:14:18,169 --> 01:14:20,569
Well, something sure the hell ain't right.

1092
01:14:23,508 --> 01:14:24,805
This ain't no little settlement.

1093
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:27,674
We flew over at least a dozen cities just as big.

1094
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:30,009
Why didn't we ever hear about this?

[beeping]

1096
01:14:32,016 --> 01:14:33,415

Ho.

01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:19,895
No entry wounds, fractures.

1099
01:15:20,365 --> 01:15:21,559
Poison?

1100
01:15:34,245 --> 01:15:35,872
Got another one.

1101
01:15:41,419 --> 01:15:43,148
They's just sitting here.

1102
01:15:44,856 --> 01:15:46,084
They didn't crash.

1103

How come these ones are preserved?

1107

Place must've gone hermetic when the power blew.

1108
01:16:12,984 --> 01:16:15,612
Sealed them. (Kaylee) What are they doing?

1109
01:16:16,821 --> 01:16:18,721
What's everybody doing?

1110
01:16:18,957 --> 01:16:21,425
There's no unusual discoloration.

1111
01:16:21,993 --> 01:16:24,723
Nobody's doubled over or showing signs of pain.

1112
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,461
(Mal) There's gasses that kill painless, right?

1113
01:16:27,765 --> 01:16:30,165
They didn't fall. None of them.

1114
01:16:30,568 --> 01:16:32,297
They just lay down.

1115

[River muttering in Chinese]

1116
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,271
Make them stop. They're everywhere.

01:16:40,211 --> 01:16:42,338
Every city, every....

1118
01:16:42,614 --> 01:16:45,549
Every house, every room, they're all inside me.

1119
01:16:45,617 --> 01:16:49,053
I can hear them all, and they're saying nothing!

1120
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:51,077
Get up.

1121
01:16:52,223 --> 01:16:53,690
Please get up.

(Zoe) Jayne. She's right!

1126
01:17:06,437 --> 01:17:08,064
Everybody's dead.

1127
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,838
This whole world is dead for no reason!

1128

Let's get to the beacon.

1129

(Wash) This is the source?

And you can see...

1133
01:18:14,105 --> 01:18:15,629
it isn't what we thought.

1134
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:18,731
There's been no war here...

1135
01:18:19,744 --> 01:18:22,838
and no terraforming event. The environment is stable.

1136
01:18:27,952 --> 01:18:29,351
It's the Pax.

1137
01:18:30,888 --> 01:18:35,222
The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors.

1138
01:18:36,194 --> 01:18:39,925
It was supposed to calm the population, weed out aggression.

1139
01:18:42,033 --> 01:18:43,660
Well, it works.

1140
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:46,969
The people here stopped fighting.

1141
01:18:47,939 --> 01:18:50,567
And then they stopped everything else.

1142
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,675
They stopped going to work...

1143
01:18:58,583 --> 01:19:02,815
they stopped breeding, talking, eating.

1144
01:19:04,655 --> 01:19:08,921
There's 30 million people here, and they all just let themselves die.

About a tenth of a percent of...

1149
01:19:16,267 --> 01:19:18,599
the population had the opposite reaction to the Pax.

1150
01:19:19,237 --> 01:19:22,900
Their aggressor response increased beyond madness.

1151

I won't live to report this, but people have to know.

I'm all right.

1169
01:20:46,257 --> 01:20:48,691
(Mal) This report is maybe 12 years old.

1170
01:20:49,694 --> 01:20:53,596
Parliament buried it, and it stayed buried till River dug it up.

1171
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:57,633
This is what they feared she knew.

1172
01:20:58,236 --> 01:21:00,101
And they were right to fear...

1173
01:21:00,671 --> 01:21:03,640
because there's a whole universe of folk who are gonna know it, too.

They're gonna see it.

Somebody has to speak for these people.

1176
01:21:12,049 --> 01:21:14,415
You all got on this boat for different reasons...

1177
01:21:14,485 --> 01:21:16,646
but you all come to the same place.

1178
01:21:17,054 --> 01:21:20,217
So now I'm asking more of you than I have before.

1179
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:22,690
Maybe all.

1180
01:21:24,662 --> 01:21:27,859
Sure as I know anything I know this, they will try again.

1181
01:21:29,233 --> 01:21:31,724
Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean.

1182
01:21:31,836 --> 01:21:34,634
A year from now, 10, they'll swing back to the belief...

1183
01:21:34,772 --> 01:21:36,865
that they can make people...

1184
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:40,599
better.

1185
01:21:43,781 --> 01:21:45,806
And I do not hold to that.

1186
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:49,552
So no more running.

Do we have a plan? Mr. Universe.

We haven't the equipment to broadwave this code...

but he can put it on every screen for 30 worlds.

He's pretty damn close, too.

We still got the Reavers...

1196
01:22:22,586 --> 01:22:24,850
and probably the Alliance, between us and him.

(Jayne) That's two armies against our one bitty cannon.

1198

It's a fair bet the Alliance knows about Mr. Universe.

1199
01:22:31,095 --> 01:22:32,562
They're gonna see this coming.

No.

1460
01:49:59,342 --> 01:50:00,866
They might listen...

1461
01:50:01,611 --> 01:50:05,012
but I think they know I'm no longer their man.

1462
01:50:06,782 --> 01:50:09,876
They take you down, I don't expect to grieve over much.

1463
01:50:12,121 --> 01:50:14,555
Like to kill you myself, I see you again.

1464
01:50:15,391 --> 01:50:16,380
You won't.

1465
01:50:19,328 --> 01:50:21,523
There is nothing left to see.

1466
01:50:27,236 --> 01:50:28,760
Sir, we have a green light.

1467
01:50:29,171 --> 01:50:31,401
Inspection's pos and we're clear for up-thrust.

1468
01:50:37,913 --> 01:50:40,006
Think she'll hold together?

1469
01:50:41,017 --> 01:50:43,645
She's tore up plenty. But she'll fly true.

1470
01:50:47,957 --> 01:50:50,187
Make sure everything's secure.

1471
01:50:52,061 --> 01:50:54,962
Could be bumpy. Always is.

1472
01:51:02,371 --> 01:51:03,395
Taking her out...

1473
01:51:03,472 --> 01:51:06,032
should be about a day's ride to get you back to your girls.

1474
01:51:06,108 --> 01:51:07,268
Right.

1475
01:51:08,678 --> 01:51:10,908
Ready to get off this heap, back to civilized life?

1476
01:51:10,980 --> 01:51:11,969
I, uh....

1477
01:51:16,752 --> 01:51:18,117
I don't know.

1478
01:51:20,122 --> 01:51:21,282
Good answer.

1479
01:51:46,515 --> 01:51:49,040
So, you gonna ride shotgun with me, help me fly?

1480
01:51:49,285 --> 01:51:50,513
That's the plan.

1481
01:51:51,187 --> 01:51:52,745
Think you can work out--

1482
01:51:52,822 --> 01:51:54,551
[engine revving]

1483
01:52:00,396 --> 01:52:01,385
Okay.

1484
01:52:02,765 --> 01:52:05,893
Clearly some aptitude for the....

1485
01:52:07,403 --> 01:52:09,928
It ain't all buttons and charts, little albatross.

1486
01:52:10,372 --> 01:52:12,499
You know what the first rule of flying is?

1487
01:52:13,008 --> 01:52:16,000
Well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say.

1488
01:52:17,046 --> 01:52:18,513
(River) I do.

1489
01:52:19,682 --> 01:52:21,411
But I like to hear you say it.

1490
01:52:26,222 --> 01:52:27,211
Love.

1491
01:52:27,556 --> 01:52:29,456
You can learn all the math in the 'verse...

1492
01:52:29,525 --> 01:52:31,550
but you take a boat in the air that you don't love...

1493
01:52:31,627 --> 01:52:34,494
she'll shake you off just as sure as the turn of the worlds.

1494
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:40,529
Love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down...

1495
01:52:42,004 --> 01:52:44,336
tells you she's hurting before she keels.

1496
01:52:47,143 --> 01:52:48,371
Makes her a home.

[rain pattering]

1498
01:52:53,949 --> 01:52:55,814
Storm's getting worse.

1499
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:00,816
We'll pass through it soon enough.

1500
01:53:21,911 --> 01:53:22,843
(Mal) What was that?
