00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,526
你感到迷茫和恐懼 對嗎?
You are confused, aren't you? Frightened.

7
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,258
沒關係 我能幫你

你是誰?
Who is this?

9
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,357
我是醫生 你聽我說
I am a doctor. Now, you must listen to me.

10
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,755
你失憶了
You have lost your memory.

11
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,805
實驗出了差錯
There was an experiment. Something went wrong.

12
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,030
你的記憶被抹掉了
Your memory was erased.

13
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,028
你懂我的意思嗎?
Do you understand me?

14
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,166
不 我不懂 到底是怎麼回事?
No, I don't understand. What the hell is going on here?

15
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,934
聽好 有人這會正要去抓你
Just listen. There are people coming for you even as we speak.

16
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:41,713
別讓他們找到你 快逃
You must not let them find you. You must leave now.

17
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,246
喂? 你還在嗎?
Hello? Are you there?

18
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,812
嘿 默多克先生 剛才自助餐廳打電話來

說你把錢包落在那裡了

I suggest you retrieve it since you only paid for 3 weeks...

我住了3個星期?

我們的賬本和床被一樣一絲不苟
We make our books like we make our beds, all neat and tidy.

27
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,464
我回來再付
I'll take care of it when I get back.

28
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,663
那最好 沒錢

29
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,036
就別想在這白住

我找默多克先生

48
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,139
有人自稱是你丈夫的醫生
He said he was your husband's doctor.

49
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,648
他想和你談談

丹尼爾·施列伯 心理醫生

51
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,025
打擾了
Excuse me.

您是施...
Dr. Sh...

53
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,033
施列伯 請進

54
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,270
你一定是艾瑪·默多克了
You must be Emma Murdoch.

55
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,308
謝謝你抽空趕來
Thank you for coming to see me on such short notice.

56
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,847
這是什麼?
What is this?

57
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,814
為深入研究而做的簡單試驗
A rather crude experiment... designed to further my studies.

58
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,018
我不明白
I don't understand.

59
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,086
你說你是我丈夫的醫生
You say you're my husband's doctor,

60
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:52,156
但他從沒提過你
but he never mentioned you to me.

61
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,529
其實 默多克先生...
The truth is, Mrs. Murdoch...

62
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,034
來找我看病有好一段日子了
John has been coming to see me for quite some time.

63
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,799
他很困擾 覺得自己遭到了背叛
He had been grappling with feelings of betrayal...

64
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,900
因為你們的婚姻出現了問題
stemming from your marital difficulties.

65
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,170
約翰都告訴你了?      是的
- John told you what happened?      - Yes.

66
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,543
你上次見到他是什麼時候?
When was the last time that you saw him?

67
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,048
3周前
3 weeks ago.

68
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,848
他對我大發雷霆 收拾行李走了
He packed a suitcase. He was very angry at me.

69
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,878
我知道 你一定很難過
I understand how difficult this must be for you.

70
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,550
看在約翰的面上 我希望你
But for John's sake, I would like you...

71
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,219
把我當作你的朋友 艾瑪
to think of me as your friend, Emma.

72
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,026
約翰似乎精神崩潰
It appears that John has suffered a psychotic break.

73
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,292
完全失憶
Complete memory loss.

74
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,959
他可能有妄想症
He may be delusional.

75
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,902
甚至有暴力傾向
Even violent.

76
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,371
艾瑪
Emma...

77
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,837
如果他跟你聯絡 我想他會那麼做...
if he were to contact you, and I suspect he will...

78
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,744
你一定要馬上通知我 知道嗎?
you must call me immediately. Do you understand?

79
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,549
他現在最需要的就是我
It is imperative that I be the first one to reach him.

80
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,517
不管你丈夫現在在哪 他一定在...
Wherever your husband is, he is searching...

81
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,414
尋找自我
...for himself.

82
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,400
晚上好 默多克先生

84
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:11,107
我叫J什麼 默多克?

00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,670
我告訴他 沒錢就別住
I told the guy, "Cash on the barrelhead."

94
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,168
我還說 3周的錢就只能住3周
I said, "Listen, 3 weeks is 3 weeks."

95
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,441
死者在哪?
Where's our lucky winner?

96
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,314
樓上 614房間 長官

100
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,957
巴姆斯泰德探長

101
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,928
你鞋帶鬆了
Your lace is untied.

102
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,224
長官
Sir.

103
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,632
有你來這坐鎮真好
Am I glad you're here, sir.

104
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,305
他們說瓦倫斯基探長精神失常了
They say Detective Walenski's got the heebie-jeebies.

105
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,610
我只是奉命行事 哈瑟爾貝克
Just take what they give me, Husselbeck.

106
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,591

Wow.

107
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,791
就像是某人醒來後獸性大發的傑作
Looks like somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

108
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,395

- Hello.      - Oh, it's you.

109
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,838
你把錢包忘在這裡了
You left your wallet here, buddy.

110
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,171
什麼時候的事?
When did I do that?

111
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,334
你上次來這時
When you was last here.

112
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,504
那是什麼時候?      你忘錢包的時候
- When was that?       - When you left your wallet.

113
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,309
你以為我會記得?
You expect me to remember?

114
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,348
你好 打擾了
Hello. Excuse me.

115
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,256
不不 我認真的
No, no, seriously.

116
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,526
是不是那個嫌疑犯?
Alleged?

117
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,869
你要去哪 先生?      回家
- Where you headed, chief?      - Home.

118
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:32,935
那你家在哪?
And where's home?

119
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,742
你們這些人悶得慌嗎?
Haven't you mugs got anything better to do?

120
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,045
我在做我的工作 辣妹
Well, I'm just trying to do my job, May.

121
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,142
現在有殺手在逃
There's a killer out there in case you hadn't noticed.

122
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,427
不去抓人
Maybe you should be out looking for him

123
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:42,882
呆在這偷懶?
instead of cooling your heels, huh?

124
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,885
你們走吧
Go on, get out of here.

125
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,224
快來啊
Come on.

126
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,667
身上劃了一圈又一圈
Round and round she goes.

127
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:07,204
在哪停下的? 沒人知道
Where she stops? Nobody knows.

128
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,510
他殺多少人了 哈瑟爾貝克?  6名妓女?
What's that make so far, Husselbeck? 6 hookers in all?

129
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,019
我想是的 長官
I believe so, sir.

130
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,579
該給此人的不懈努力頒個獎
Give the man an "A" for effort.

131
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,853
這些女孩本來能用美貌
You'd think these stiffs would have the good grace...

132
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,019
和人歡度春宵
to expire at a good time of night.

133
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,996
聽說瓦倫斯基狀態不佳 是嗎?
Hey, too bad about Walenski, huh?

134
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,191
我想他可能看多了
I guess he'd seen enough.

135
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,298
那麼 哈瑟爾貝克
So, Husselbeck...

136
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,576
究竟是什麼樣的殺手
what kind of killer do you think

137
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:46,116
會放下屠刀 救一條垂死的魚
stops to save a dying fish?

138
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,140
你難倒我了 長官
You've got me, sir.

139
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,313
巴姆斯泰德 有線索沒
Bumstead, what took you?

140
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,486
殺手和我們玩捉迷藏
This killer's been running circles around us

141
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:52,320
都怪瓦倫斯基辦案不力
thanks to Walenski.

142
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,421
總探長 恕我直言
With all due respect, Chief Inspector...

143
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,452
我和艾迪是多年好友 他是個好探員
I've known Eddie a long time. He's a good cop.

144
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,497
不管他以前是不是好探員
Whatever kind of cop Walenski once was,

145
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:01,694
他讓兇手逍遙法外太久了
he let drift a long time ago.

146
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,565
我要見巴姆斯泰德!
Let me talk to Bumstead!

147
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,967
快 追上他
Come on, let's go.

148
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,369
停下!
Hold on!

149
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,303
弗蘭克 弗蘭克!
Frank, Frank!

150
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,001
抓住他的手!
Get his arm!

151
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,332
他們在監視著我們!
They're watching us!

152
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,402
你站著別動
On your feet.

153
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,878
我們無路可逃
There's no way out!

154
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,245
別逼我們出手傷你
Don't make us hurt you.

155
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,011
天啊 難道你們看不出來
God, can't you see?!

156
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,718
放開我 放開我
Let me go, let me go!

157
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,222
我不會傷人 我不會...
I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not...

158
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,521
怎麼回事?      是瓦倫斯基
- What was that?      - Walenski.

159
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,064
老天是要懲罰我嗎?
I'm being punished for my sins, right?

160
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,470
竟要接掌這樣一間辦公室
What did I ever do to inherit this?

161
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,799
你準備從哪著手?
Where do you begin?

162
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:46,079
從瓦倫斯基探長的記錄開始
Well, everything Detective Walenski committed to paper

163
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,792
應該在這 然後...
should be here, so...

164
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:51,172
瓦倫斯基該被關進精神病院
The only thing that should be committed is Walenski.

165
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,117
其實有妄想症也沒什麼不好
Nothing like a little healthy paranoia.

166
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,785
長官 指紋鑒定報告出來了
Sir, we just got the fingerprint results in.

167
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,927
這是怎麼一回事 玩笑?
What is this, some kind of joke?

168
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,535
什麼都別扔
Don't throw anything away.

169
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,769
巴姆斯泰德探長
Inspector Bumstead.

170
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,777
我丈夫失蹤了 我來報案
I came here to file a missing persons report for my husband.

171
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,451
去櫃檯辦吧
Take it to the front desk.

172
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,317
他們叫我來見你
They told me to come see you.

173
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,285
他叫約翰·默多克
His name's John Murdoch.

174
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,352
默多克女士 之前為何不報案
Mrs. Murdoch, why didn't you report this before?

175
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,429
我是說  既然你丈夫失蹤
I mean, if your husband has been missing

176
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:42,595
已經長達...
as long as you say...

177
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,330
我那時以為他只是和我耍脾氣
I thought he'd simply walked out on me.

178
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,464
然後有名醫生...今晚找上我
Then a... doctor contacted me this evening.

179
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,136
你們結婚多久了?
How long have you been married?

180
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,474
快4年了
Nearly four years.

181
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,445
為什麼這麼問?
Why do you ask?

182
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,500
因為你似乎並不喜歡戴著戒指
Because you seem uncomfortable with your ring.

183
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:03,281
好像戴著很不習慣
As if you were... unaccustomed to wearing it.

184
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,755
不 我從不把它摘下來
No, I never take it off.

185
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,757
你認識這些人嗎?
Do these names mean anything to you?

186
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,606
不 她們是誰
No. Who are these women?

187
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,204
你們為什麼要找我丈夫
Why are you looking for my husband?

188
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,776
他犯了什麼罪?
Are you going to accuse him of something?

189
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,111
他涉嫌謀殺
Maybe. Maybe murder.

190
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,173
殺了誰?
Whose murder?

191
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,281
哪一個?      全部
- Which one?      - All of them.

192
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,451
默多剋夫人 對不起 我很抱歉
Mrs. Murdoch, I am sorry, I'm sorry.

193
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,549
我無意嚇你
I didn't mean to alarm you.

194
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,152
我不該來這 你我都錯了
I'm so sorry that I came. Just both made a mistake.

195
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,662
默多剋夫人  如果你不介意
Mrs. Murdoch, if you please.

196
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,130
請給我點時間解釋...
If you'll just give me half a second to explain...

197
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,458
我一會就回來
I'll be right out.

198
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,925
我們見過面嗎?
Have we met before?

199
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:21,592
如果有 希望你還活著
If we did... I hope you're still breathing.

200
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,260
甜心 你叫什麼名字?
What's your name, honey?

201
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,302
約翰
John.

202
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,802
嗯 我的顧客都能自稱約翰
Well, that's an appropriate name.

203
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,697
是
Yeah.

204
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,043
我在想
I was just thinking.

205
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,812
你為什麼幹這一行...
What you do...

206
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,356
有點危險...
seems kind of dangerous...

207
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,384
例如現在
right now.

208
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,158
我的意思是 你怎知我不是殺手?
I mean, how do you know I'm not the killer?

209
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,394
你看上去不像? 為什麼這麼問
You don't seem like the killer type. Why?

210
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,127
難道你有什麼特別需要嗎?
You feeling any urges I should know about?

211
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,251
啊 真可惡
Aw, shoot.

212
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,650
似乎你已發現了你的惡劣本性
So it seems you've discovered your unpleasant nature.

213
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,850
你們是誰?
Who are you?

214
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,557
我們也有此問 是吧?
We might ask the same question, yes?

215
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,192
沉睡吧
Sleep now.

216
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,892
他懂得調諧
He can tune.

217
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,280
該怎麼辦? 此人是危險人物
What is to be done? This man is dangerous.

218
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,252
聽說他也會調諧之術
It is said he is able to tune.

219
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,651
不可能
Impossible.

220
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,486
我們親眼所見
We have seen it with our own eyes.

221
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,958
一般人如果沒有注射
On occasion the imprinting does not take.

222
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,962
醒來後就會舉止失常
They behave erratically when they awaken.

223
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,625
像迷失的孩童一樣四處遊蕩
We find them wandering like lost children.

224
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,827
但這個人不同 是嗎?
But this one was different, yes?

225
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,563
醫生怎麼說?
What has the doctor to say about this?

226
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,594
他還沒報告
He has failed to report in.

227
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,767
快先生呢?      快先生不在了
- And Mr. Quick?      - No more Mr. Quick.

228
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,801
他已經死了
Mr. Quick, dead, yes.

229
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,442
可憐的快先生
Poor, poor Mr. Quick.

230
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,351
書先生知道嗎
Mr. Book, does he know?

231
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,519
我們不該知道嗎 手先生?
Should we not know, Mr. Hand?

232
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,358
我們本想獲得更多訊息後再告訴你們
We had hoped to learn more before sharing with you.

233
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,329
在抓到他之前我們什麼都不會知道
We can know nothing until we possess him.

234
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,958
夜先生 你負責搜索東方
Mr. Night, you will take the East.

235
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,798
面先生 你負責搜索西方
Mr. Face, you the West.

236
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,930
套先生 你負責搜索南方
Mr. Glove, the South.

237
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,202
影先生 你負責搜索北方
Mr. Shade, the North.

238
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,712
我們必須抓到他
We must have this man.

239
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,994
你真的認為
Do you really think

240
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,353
我丈夫是連環殺人犯?
my husband could be capable of committing those murders?

241
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,356
你呢?
Do you?

242
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,092
希望是我判斷失誤吧
Let's hope, for both our sakes, that I'm wrong.

243
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,861
約翰
John.

244
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,342
我好擔心你
I've been so worried about you.

245
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,847
你是在懲罰我嗎?
Are you punishing me?

246
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,483
如果你用失蹤來懲罰我
You know, if disappearing is your way of punishing me...

247
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,617
那我不喜歡
I don't appreciate it.

248
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,719
我不知道你在說什麼
I don't know what you're talking about.

249
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,056
我在口袋裡找到這些鑰匙
I found these keys in my pocket...

250
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,796
於是我想我住在這裡
so I assume I live here.

251
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,600
你應該是我妻子吧?
You supposed to be my wife?

252
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,663
應該是?
Supposed to be?

253
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,732
約翰
John.

254
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,006
難道你真的...
You really...

255
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,546
不知道我是誰?
don't know who I am, do you?

256
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,509
你的醫生找過我
Your doctor called me.

257
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,039
這正是他擔心的
He was worried that this might happen.

258
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,574
我的醫生?
My doctor?

259
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,144
是的 他...
Yeah. He...

260
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,213
給了我他的名片
he gave me his card.

261
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,782
他急著找你
He's desperate to find you.

262
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,351
施列伯
Schreber.

263
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,759
我覺得自己活在別人的噩夢裡
I feel like I'm living out someone else's nightmare.

264
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,566
我到底怎麼了 為什麼我要去看醫生?
What happened to me? Why was I seeing a doctor?

265
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,432
因為我有外遇
I had an affair.

266
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,943
你很生我的氣
You were angry at me.

267
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,245
警察在找你
The police are looking for you.

268
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,580
我知道 我有看報紙
I know. I saw the papers.

269
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,178
"妓女殺手逍遙法外"
"Killer stalks city streetwalkers."

270
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,385
我和其中一名受害者在一起
I was with one of those women...

271
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,124
就在昨晚
before I came here tonight.

272
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,457
我不明白
I don't understand.

273
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,965
我在自助餐廳外遇見她
I met her outside an Automat.

274
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,028
我也許是想試一下自己
I guess I wanted to test myself.

275
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,006
我想知道我是不是殺人犯
I wanted to know if I had it in me to do those things.

276
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,409
我也許是瘋了 但不管怎樣
Maybe I have lost my mind, but whoever I am,

277
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:47,637
我還是我 不是殺人犯
I'm still me and I'm not a killer.

278
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,453
我相信你
I believe you.

279
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,316
真的嗎?
You do?

280
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,216
那是什麼?
What?

281
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,059
外面那輛車 你回來坐的那輛
The car outside, the one you arrived in.

282
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,429
是警察 他送我回來的
It's a cop. He dropped me off here.

283
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,197
我不知道他還沒走
I didn't know he was still here.

284
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,262
約翰
John.

285
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,804
站那別動!
Hold it right there, mister!

286
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,679
等下 你抓錯人了
Wait. You have the wrong man.

287
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,839
請站到旁邊 好嗎?
Stand aside, will you, please?

288
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,473
我沒殺人
I didn't kill anyone.

289
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,610
你現在只是嫌疑犯 跟我走
Right now what you are is a suspect. Turn yourself in.

290
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,111
我會聽你解釋
I'll listen to whatever you have to say.

291
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,055
你不會相信我要說的話的
You're not gonna believe what I have to say.

292
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,250
說說看
Try me.

293
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,417
有人在追我
There's someone after me.

294
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,589
一夥人 他們要我死
There's this group of men. They want me dead.

295
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,259
而且我不知道是否...他們甚至不是...
And I don't even know if... They're not even...

296
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,264
好吧 誰會聽個瘋子說話
Yeah, who's gonna listen to a madman?

297
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,100
請站到旁邊 默多剋夫人
Stand aside, Mrs. Murdoch.

298
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,264
快逃!
Run!

299
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,840
怎麼就沒人聽我的
No one ever listens to me.

300
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,511
默多克 站住!
Murdoch, stop!

301
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,456
默多克!
Murdoch!

302
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,298
還有多遠
How much further?

303
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:46,720
就快到了 夥計
We're almost there, buddy.

304
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,633
你知道怎麼去貝殼海灘嗎
Hey, you happen to know the way to Shell Beach?

305
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,672
我怎麼會不知道
You're kidding.

306
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,672
我和老婆就是在那度蜜月的
Me and the missus spent our honeymoon there.

307
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,437
只要你走主街西路...
All you gotta do is take Main Street west to...

308
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,974
還是要走跨...
Or is it the cross...

309
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,643
好奇怪 我好像記不清
You know, that's funny. I can't seem to remember...

310
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,983
該走主街西路還是跨鎮大道
if it's Main Street west or the cross-town.

311
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,185
對不起 探長 我很樂意協助你破案
I'm sorry, Inspector, I cannot be of more assistance...

312
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,093
但我和人有約 快遲到了
but I am running late for an appointment.

313
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,325
感謝你抽空來幫忙
Well, I appreciate your taking the time.

314
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,939
有件事我仍然困惑不解
There's just one thing that puzzles me.

315
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:36,640
我辦案生涯中見過不少殺人犯
I've met quite a few murderers in the course of my work.

316
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,343
但默多克不像是殺人犯
Murdoch doesn't strike me as one.

317
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,647
也許你還沒去深入瞭解
Perhaps you are not accustomed to digging deep enough.

318
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:45,613
沒人能騙得過我 醫生
Well, I do know when someone is lying to me, Doctor.

319
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,285
恕我冒昧 探長 你不是心理醫生
Forgive me, Inspector, but you are not a clinician.

320
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:52,057
判斷人性恰好是我的工作
Judging personalities happens to be my business.

321
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,122
你能否為我提供些建議?
Well, maybe you could give me a few pointers.

322
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,896
當然
Certainly.

323
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,059
以你為例
Let's take you, for instance.

324
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,470
你是個挑剔的人 喜歡追根究底
You are a fastidious man, driven.

325
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,565
注重細節
Consumed by details.

326
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,242
你的生活
I would say your life is...

327
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,534
很孤獨
rather Ionely.

328
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,907
晚安 探長 我真的得走了
Good evening, Inspector. I really must be going.

329
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,625
泳池即將關閉
Closing time. The pool is now closed.

330
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,391
施列伯醫生
Dr. Schreber.

331
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,169
真是不幸
Most unfortunate it is

332
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,801
要我們親自來找你
that we were forced to seek you out here.

333
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,406
你知道我們是多麼討厭
You know how uncomfortable we find all this...

334
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,376
濕氣
moisture.

335
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,979
對不起 我...      沒有報告 是的
- I'm sorry. I...      - Failed to report in, yes.

336
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,647
我當時被嚇到了 我的心臟很脆弱
I was frightened. I have a weak heart, you know.

337
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:27,556
我們認為 你脆弱的不是心臟
Your weakness is not, we think, an affair of the heart.

338
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,254
我們在他的旅館房間裡找到這個
We found this in his hotel room.

339
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:34,231
我們是不是要再給默多克灌輸記憶?
Must we reproduce Mr. Murdoch's memories again?

340
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,323
我試著給他注射
I tried to imprint him...

341
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,493
但他醒了 把注射器給打碎了
but he woke up, he knocked the syringe right out of my hand.

342
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,628
我要阻止他 但他太快了
I tried to stop him but he was too fast.

343
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,831
然後他失憶了?
He has no memories, then?

344
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,239
只有記憶碎片 因為程序被中斷了
Only fragments. The procedure, it was interrupted.

345
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,478
我想只要再抓到他就行了
I guess it's only a matter of rounding him up.

346
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,670
以前也抓過逃脫者 不是嗎?
You have had strays before, right?

347
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,343
這個人不一樣 醫生 他會調諧
This is no stray, Doctor. This one can tune.

348
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,583
不可能 調諧只有你們會
But that's impossible. I thought only you had that ability.

349
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,621
你會重新
You will process

350
00:30:57,621 --> 00:31:00,921
給他灌輸另一種模板記憶吧?
another template of the subject's memories, yes?

351
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,688
當然 我會再給他注射
Of course. I'll imprint him again.

352
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:07,221
不 這次我們另有目的
No. We require them for a quite different purpose.

353
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,534
快午夜了 施列伯醫生
It's almost midnight, Dr. Schreber.

354
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,002
今晚調諧之後 我們再找你談話 不過...
We'll talk again after tonight's tuning, but...

355
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,368
別再推遲 好嗎?
no more delays, yes?

356
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:20,207
你得絕對的服從
No more inconsistencies in your behavior.

357
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,586
你看上去很虛弱 醫生
You appear quite frail, Doctor.

358
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,848
該多鍛煉鍛煉
Perhaps some exercise would do you good.

359
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,632
請進      凱特
- Come in.      - Kate.

360
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,407
他怎樣了?      還是那樣
- How is he?      - The same.

361
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,376
瓦倫斯基? 是我 弗蘭克
Walenski? It's me, Frank.

362
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,214
請進 弗蘭克
Come in, Frank.

363
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,295
把門關上
Close the door.

364
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,705
我看了你以前的報告
I've been looking through some of your old reports.

365
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,866
這案子很有意思
It's an interesting case.

366
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:31,880
是能讓人飛黃騰達
The kind that can make a man's career...

367
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,110
或者一蹶不振的案子
or break it.

368
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,483
對 當時我負責那案子
Yeah, I was on that case.

369
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,786
後來呢 發生什麼事 艾迪?
And then what? What happened then, Eddie?

370
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,655
沒什麼 弗蘭克
Nothing happened, Frank.

371
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,094
我坐在地鐵裡
I've just been spending time on the subway,

372
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:45,823
不停地兜圈
riding in circles.

373
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,763
不停地思考
Thinking in circles.

374
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,758
無路可逃
There's no way out.

375
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,434
我到過這城市的每一個角落
I've been over every inch of this city.

376
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,542
你把你老婆嚇死了 艾迪
You're scaring your wife to death, Eddie.

377
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,273
她不是我老婆
She's not my wife.

378
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,750
我不認識她 我不認識每一個人
I don't know who she is. I don't know who any of us are.

379
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,718
為什麼這麼說?
What makes you say that?

380
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,812
你有沒有常常回憶過去 弗蘭克?
Do you think about the past much, Frank?

381
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,757
和你差不多吧
As much as the next guy.

382
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,487
我一直努力去回憶
See, I've been trying to remember things...

383
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,224
努力地想憶起過去的點點滴滴
clearly remember things from my past.

384
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,484
我越回憶
But the more I try to think back,

385
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:25,512
越肯定
the more it all starts to unravel.

386
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,068
現在的一切都是虛無的
None of it seems real.

387
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:31,072
我們現在的生活就像一場夢
It's like I've just been dreaming this life...

388
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,069
醒來後 就變成了另外一個人
and when I finally wake up I'll be somebody else.

389
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,943
一個完全不同的人
Somebody totally different.

390
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,381
你是不是看到了什麼 艾迪?
You saw something, didn't you, Eddie?

391
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,413
案子有線索了?
Something to do with the case.

392
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,283
根本沒有什麼案子 從來就沒有
There is no case. There never was!

393
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:54,965
只不過是場笑話 一場大笑話
It's all just a big joke! It's a joke!

394
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,204
今晚的材料是
Tonight's requirements are...

395
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:43,009
12本家庭相冊 9本日記
12 family photo albums, 9 personal diaries...

396
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:47,984
17封情書 各種童年照片
17 love letters, assorted childhood photographs...

397
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:52,115
26個錢包 身份證和社保卡
26 wallets, ID's and social security cards.

398
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,249
這些東西的確能喚起記憶
These do bring back memories.

399
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,857
這個還是溫熱的
This one is still warm.

400
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,693
裡面會是怎樣的記憶呢?
What is it?

401
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,928
情聖的記憶?
The recollections of a great lover?

402
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,914
還是獵艷名單呢?
A catalog of conquests?

403
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,528
答案即將揭曉
We will soon find out.

404
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,137
你們不懂得品味其中滋味 是吧?
You wouldn't appreciate that, would you,

405
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:14,537
不管你是什麼先生
Mr. Whatever your name Is?

406
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,948
你們從來就不知風流為何物
Not the sort of conquests you would ever understand.

407
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:20,941
讓我們瞧瞧
Let's see.

408
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,949
些許不快樂的童年
A touch of unhappy childhood.

409
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,491
再來些青春期的叛逆
A dash of teenage rebellion.

410
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,064
最後 還少不了
And last, but not least...

411
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,366
家中親人的故去
a tragic death in the family.

412
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,393
醫生
Doctor.

413
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,632
書先生
Mr. Book.

414
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,845
為什麼默多克
Why does Murdoch not sleep...

415
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,785
不像其他人在調諧的時候睡著
during the tuning as the others do?

416
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,950
我不知道 也許他進化了吧
I don't know. Maybe he's a step up the evolutionary ladder.

417
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,858
成為個怪胎 適應了環境
A freak of nature. He's adapting to survive.

418
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:03,935
你們想要什麼
What do you expect?

419
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,295
你們不是來找尋人類靈魂的嗎?
Weren't you looking for the human soul?

420
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,890
這不正是你們製造這小動物園的目的嗎?
That's the purpose of your little zoo, isn't it?

421
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,266
因此你們才每晚
That's why you keep changing people

422
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:12,266
變換人和物事
and things around every night.

423
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,397
也許這就是你們想找的
Maybe you have finally found what you are looking for...

424
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,633
它還能反咬你們...
and it's going to bite you on your...

425
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,240
得過好幾代人 人類才能掌握我們的本領
It requires several of your lifetimes to master our gifts.

426
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:28,150
一個普通人能夠調諧
The idea that a simple man could develop the ability to tune...

427
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,710
很荒謬 我知道...
Is absurd, I know...

428
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,813
那你要怎麼解釋默多克的本領?
but what other explanation is there?

429
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,618
是時候了
It is time.

430
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,139
關閉
Shut it down.

431
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,156
來此買報紙
Get your paper right here!

432
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,400
我快瘋了
It's driving me crazy.

433
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,872
我睡不著
I can't sleep.

434
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,704
他們說我技藝不精
And they call my job "unskilled".

435
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,040
你覺得就你一個人難受?
You think you've got it tough?

436
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,942
你試試來照看那些鬼靈精
You try looking after these kids, for a change.

437
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:03,837
不管怎樣
Anyways,

438
00:38:03,837 --> 00:38:06,977
弗雷德裡克森說他要把我換到早班
Frederickson says he'll take me off the damn night shift soon.

439
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,418
親愛的 是該換了
Well, it's about time, dear.

440
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,185
有人在嗎?
Hello?

441
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,059
誰能聽見我說話?
Hello?!

442
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,305
醒醒!
Wake up!

443
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,862
嘿!
Hey!

444
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,608
醒醒!
Wake up!

445
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,544
醒醒!
Wake up!

446
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,715
醒醒!
Wake up!

447
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,818
人都怎麼了?
Hello?!

448
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,680
還有誰沒睡著?
Can anybody hear me?!

449
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,218
開始調諧
Let the tuning commence.

450
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,848
古德溫一家  傑瑞米 西爾維婭
The Goodwins. Jeremy, Sylvia...

451
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,190
珍妮和小馬修
Jane and little Matthew.

452
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,057
珍妮和小馬修
Jane and little Matthew.

453
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,859
富者愈富
The rich get richer.

454
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,563
醒來後 可能會多一間傭人房
Probably have maid's quarters before the night is through.

455
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,554
我想你是施列伯醫生
Dr. Schreber, I presume.

456
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,081
是你
It's you.

457
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,526
嘿 別這樣
Hey, come on.

458
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,756
可不能這麼問候病人 醫生
That's no way to greet a patient, Doctor.

459
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,560
如果你是醫生的話
If that's what you are, huh, Doctor?

460
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,998
默多克先生 拜託 我...
Mr. Murdoch, please, l...

461
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,899
這裡怎麼了 為什麼大家都睡著了
What is happening here? Why is everyone asleep?

462
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,301
噓 小點聲
Shh. Please keep your voice down.

463
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,272
為什麼我失憶了 你對我做了什麼
Why can't I remember anything? What have you done to me?

464
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,070
什麼都沒做 別這樣 我想幫你
Nothing, nothing. Please, I want to help you.

465
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,406
在這不方便說話
We can't talk here.

466
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:40,416
我們在這 他們會...

467
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,645
不安全 如果他們看到
It is not safe. If they see us

468
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:42,639
我們在這 他們會...
together, they'll...

469
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,113
我不管 我要你的解釋
I don't care. I want some answers.

470
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,479
現在就告訴我!
I want some answers now!

471
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,676
他們是誰?
Who are they?

472
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,651
為什麼想殺我?
Why are they trying to kill me?

473
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,846
回答我!
Answer me!

474
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,255
天啊 你真的有那本事
My God. You really can do it.

475
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,252
我的本事?
I did that?

476
00:44:59,252 --> 00:45:01,860
聽我說 約翰 你有他們的能力
Listen to me, John. You have their power.

477
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,992
你能單憑意志改變物體
You can make things happen by will alone.

478
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,243
他們稱之為調諧
They call it tuning.

479
00:45:05,243 --> 00:45:07,333
建築就是這樣被改變的
That is how they make the buildings change.

480
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,931
你自衛時能夠不自覺地使用出來
Just now you acted out of self-defense. A reflex.

481
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,806
不過我能夠讓你運用自如
But I can teach you to control your power consciously.

482
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,175
讓我來幫你 約翰 我們能阻止他們
Let me help you, John. Together we can stop them.

483
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,839
我們能奪回這座城市
We can take the city back.

484
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,846
我的眼鏡
My glasses.

485
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,254
眼鏡呢
My glasses, please.

486
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,031
他表現糟透了
He made a terrible impression for the firm...

487
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,404
愛偷懶
Iollygagging around as he did.

488
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,736
所以我告訴弗雷德裡克森
So I simply told Frederickson

489
00:46:18,736 --> 00:46:20,342
我要解雇他
I was going to have to let him go.

490
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,673
就該那麼做 親愛的
And well you should have, darling.

491
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,778
他攻擊了我
He attacked me.

492
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:26,977
不知道他去了哪裡
I don't know where he has gone.

493
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,750
來 施列伯醫生
Come, Dr. Schreber.

494
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,580
我們有好多事得做
We have much to do.

495
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,186
好嗎?
Yes?

496
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:35,819
好的
Yes.

497
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:58,708
~ 他們都說你負心薄倖 ~
~ They say that you're a run-around lover ~

498
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,651
~ 雖然你說 ~
~ Though you say ~

499
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:06,588
~ 那不是真的 ~
~ It isn't so ~

500
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,528
~ 你若真要為別人離我而去 ~
~ But if you put me down for another ~

501
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,098
~ 我會知曉 ~
~ I'll know ~

502
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:24,574
~ 相信我 我會知曉 ~
~ Believe me, I'll know ~

503
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:30,144
~ 因為夜幕上 ~
~'Cause the night ~

504
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,116
~ 有千雙眼睛閃爍 ~
~ Has a thousand eyes ~

505
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,954
~ 這些眼睛 ~
~ And a thousand eyes ~

506
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,254
~ 不能言語 但能看出 ~
~ Can't tell, but see ~

507
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:51,192
~ 你是否真心對我 ~
~ If you are true to me ~

508
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,964
~ 不要忘記 ~
~ So remember ~

509
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:02,707
~ 說出善意的謊言時 ~
~ When you tell those little white lies ~

510
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:13,179
~ 天上還有千雙明亮的眼睛 ~
~ That the night has a thousand eyes ~

511
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:20,627
~ 千雙眼睛 ~
~ A thousand eyes ~

512
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,831
今晚的實驗
Tonight's experiment shall be conducted

513
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:30,837
將會在如下地點進行
in the following locations.

514
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:35,277
第一名注射對像在M大道
The first subject shall be imprinted here on Avenue M.

515
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,837
書先生 出了點差錯
Mr. Book. There is a problem.

516
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,214
沒有M大道 我們無法完成它
There is no Avenue M. We were unable to complete it.

517
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,982
上次調諧中 我們失去了對那的控制
During the last tuning we detected a lack of control.

518
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,684
機器受到了破壞?
An opposing influence on the machines?

519
00:48:48,224 --> 00:48:52,457
默多克這個人比我們想像的更強大
Then this man Murdoch is more powerful than we thought.

520
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,259
他快能和我們匹敵了
He's becoming like us.

521
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:58,860
那我們就得變得比他更強
So we must become like him.

522
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:01,336
醫生是否照我們的要求完成了?
The good doctor has done as we asked?

523
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,636
約翰·默多克的生平 第二集
The life and times of John Murdoch, Volume 2.

524
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,342
我們不能這麼做
We must not do this.

525
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,906
默多克並沒有這些記憶 是吧?
Murdoch does not possess these memories, yes?

526
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,612
那這些記憶又怎能幫我們找到他
How will his imprint allow us to find him?

527
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,984
他所到之處
Everywhere he goes...

528
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,649
所見之人都能盡在掌握
everyone he seeks out will be known to us.

529
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,685
既然他循著線索找
And as he follows the clues,

530
00:49:22,685 --> 00:49:25,689
那我們就照著記憶來
so shall we follow the memories.

531
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,391
難道忘了上次注射的後果了嗎 當我們...
Perhaps we have forgotten what happened last time, when we t...

532
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,560
是的 可憐的 可憐的...
Yes. Poor, poor Mr...

533
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,466
我們沒有忘記
We have not forgotten.

534
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:38,743
既然手先生願意
If Mr. Hand wishes to make this sacrifice

535
00:49:38,746 --> 00:49:40,776
為了更大的事業做出犧牲
for the greater good...

536
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,845
那就這麼做吧
so be it.

537
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:48,078
但是過去給我們自己灌輸記憶都失敗了
But to imprint one of us. Failure has always resulted.

538
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:51,645
手先生的提議是唯一的辦法
What Mr. Hand proposes is our only option.

539
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,121
開始注射
Imprint.

540
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,558
可能會有點痛
This may sting a bit.

541
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,301
好了嗎?
Is it done?

542
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,562
是的 書先生
Oh, yes, Mr. Book.

543
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:47,034
我腦中已經有約翰·默多克的記憶了
I have John Murdoch... in mind.

544
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,009
約翰...
"Johnny...

545
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,208
我在你媽媽的遺物中找到了這張明信片
"I found this postcard among your mother's things.

546
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,381
重拾記憶 不是嗎?
"Brings back memories, doesn't it?

547
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,288
有空來坐坐
"Stop by sometime.

548
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,121
看看這次能不能釣到
"We'll see if we can't hook ourselves...

549
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,491
又一條美人魚
"another mermaid.

550
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,496
代我問候艾瑪·卡爾
"Love to Emma. Karl."

551
00:51:07,623 --> 00:51:10,061
貝殼海灘
Shell Beach

552
00:51:10,061 --> 00:51:12,369
卡爾·哈里斯
K.Harris.

553
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,707
卡爾
Karl.

554
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,854
卡爾·哈里斯
Karl Harris.

555
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,613
哈里斯
Harris.

556
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,551
哈里斯
Harris.

557
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,527
哈里斯·卡爾
"Harris Karl."

558
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,491
打擾一下 能不能告訴我去C大道怎麼走
Excuse me. Can you tell me the way to Avenue C?

559
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:38,721
坐地鐵
Try the subway.

560
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:44,290
有什麼事?
You got a problem, pal?

561
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,269
你在這工作多久了?
You've been working here long?

562
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:51,637
整整25年 風雨無阻
25 years. No days off for good behavior.

563
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,929
我們在找約翰·默多克
We're looking for John Murdoch.

564
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,997
手先生 他什麼都不知道
She knows nothing, Mr. Hand.

565
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,166
我們進了死胡同 是的 牆先生
A dead end, yes, Mr. Wall.

566
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,208
我們本想憑他的記憶
We thought his imprint would

567
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,802
能帶我們找到他 是的...
allow us to track him, yes...

568
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,278
但我們卻被帶到了這裡
but instead we have been brought here.

569
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,940
這不合理
This is irrational.

570
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,313
直覺本就是不合理的 牆先生...
Instincts are irrational, Mr. Wall...

571
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,486
我們要服從直覺的指引 是的
and we must follow where they lead, yes.

572
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,153
眠先生建議去他熟悉的地方找
Mr. Sleep suggests he may go to places familiar...

573
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:15,314
比如工作地
his job.

574
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,417
他才不在乎我們給的工作
He does not care about our job.

575
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,293
告訴我們 手先生
Indulge us, Mr. Hand.

576
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,957
如果你是默多克
If you were Murdoch...

577
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:22,987
是的
Yes.

578
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,267
如果...
If...

579
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,559
我是默多克
I were Murdoch...

580
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,105
我會記得...
I would remember...

581
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,701
妻子的出軌是怎樣地讓我憤怒傷心
how my wife had hurt me by sleeping with another man.

582
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,745
然後...
And then...

583
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,973
我會設法報復她
I would look for a way to hurt her in return.

584
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,021
讓我和她待會
Leave me alone with her.

585
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,821
有事情得做
There's work to be done.

586
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,628
請往三號月台轉車
All change, platform 3.

587
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,498
請往三號月台轉車
Platform 3, all change.

588
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,230
轉車? 請問
All change? Excuse me.

589
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,601
我該怎麼坐到終點站?
How do I get to the end of the line?

590
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,196
坐直達車
You want the Express.

591
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:14,212
7號月台不停車
No trains leave on platform 7.

592
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,650
你可以去2號月台      知道了 謝謝
- You want platform 2.      - Got it. Thanks a lot.

593
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,674
嘿!
Hey!

594
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,187
那火車怎麼不停
How come that train didn't stop?

595
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,711
因為那是直達車
That's the Express.

596
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:22,891
無路可逃 你知道嗎?
There's no way out, you know?

597
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,927
你逃不出這座城市的 相信我 我試過
You can't get out of the city. Believe me, I've tried.

598
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,658
你是不是默多克?
You're Murdoch, aren't you?

599
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,895
他們一直在找的人
The one they've been looking for.

600
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,765
你是誰?      曾是一名警察
- Who are you?      - Used to be a cop.

601
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,938
至少 在現在這個人生中是
At least, in this life, I was.

602
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,432
你知道嗎? 他們偷取人們的記憶
They steal people's memories, you know?

603
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,806
然後在我們中調換記憶
Then they swap them around between us.

604
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,540
我親眼所見 換來換去 換來換去...
I've seen them do it. Back and forth, back and forth...

605
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,673
現在 誰都不知道自己是誰
till no one knows who they are anymore.

606
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:46,977
你怎麼會知道這些?
How do you know all this?

607
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,887
我們中偶爾會有人醒來
Once in a while, one of us wakes up

608
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:51,000
在他們換記憶的時候
while they're changing things.

609
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,618
本不該發生 但就是發生了
It's not supposed to happen, but it does.

610
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,382
那人碰巧是我
It happened to me.

611
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,625
他們會來找你的 默多克
They'll come looking for you, Murdoch.

612
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,389
就像找我一樣
Just like they'll come looking for me.

613
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,528
但沒關係
But that's OK.

614
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,032
我找到出路了
I figured a way out.

615
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,776
他們在這裡
They were here.

616
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,945
昨晚
Last night.

617
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,281
這裡曾是他的家
This was to be his home.

618
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,886
當時我們(他和默多克記憶一樣)多麼愛她
That was when we loved her.

619
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:29,388
幹得好 手先生
This is all well and good, Mr. Hand...

620
00:55:29,388 --> 00:55:31,237
但我們需要更直接的
But we require a more practical link

621
00:55:31,237 --> 00:55:33,318
能找到他的所在的線索
to his present whereabouts.

622
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,227
是的
Yes.

623
00:55:38,021 --> 00:55:40,533
我知道上哪找到她
And I know where to find her.

624
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,513
你想到到這來 是你我的幸運
We're very lucky, when you think about it.

625
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:52,637
對不起 你在說什麼?
I'm sorry?

626
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,047
能夠故地重遊
To be able to revisit those places

627
00:55:55,047 --> 00:55:56,947
對我們都意味良多
which have meant so very much to us.

628
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,977
這是我和他揮之不去的記憶
I thought it was more that we were haunted by them.

629
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,780
也許吧
Perhaps.

630
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,420
想像下 有這麼一種生活
But imagine a life...

631
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,790
外星人入侵
alien to yours...

632
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,026
你們的記憶不再屬於自己
in which your memories were not your own...

633
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:13,227
而在同類中分享
but those shared by every other of your kind.

634
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,691
這樣該有多麼苦惱
Imagine the torment of such an existence...

635
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,176
沒法擁有自己的記憶
no experiences to call your own.

636
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,043
如果往事不堪回首
If it was all you knew...

637
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,811
那麼忘掉又何妨
maybe it would be a comfort.

638
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:31,181
但假如你體驗到些不同的東西
But if you were to discover something different...

639
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,988
更美好的 一些東西
Something... better.

640
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,523
在我小時候 這裡有艘渡輪
There used to be a ferry when I was a boy.

641
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,327
好大的渡輪
Biggest thing you ever saw.

642
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:46,494
亮起燈來像塊生日蛋糕
Lit up like a floating birthday cake.

643
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,001
我丈夫曾跟我那麼說過
That's just what my husband once said to me...

644
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,870
就在這裡
on this very spot.

645
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,074
你丈夫現在在哪裡?
Where is your husband now?

646
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:58,603
我也想知道 你為什麼來這裡?
I wish I knew. What brings you here?

647
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,317
我在這裡遇見我妻子
I met my wife at this place.

648
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,149
我在這裡和我丈夫初次相遇
It's where I first met my husband.

649
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,417
世界真小
Small world.

650
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,606
不 不 不
No, no, no.

651
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:01,576
有人嗎?
Hello?

652
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,639
有人嗎?
Hello?

653
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,189
你在這做什麼?
What are you doing here?

654
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,126
我一直都跟著你
I've been following you.

655
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,830
不許動!
Hold it right there!

656
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,302
約翰?
Johnny?

657
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:02,901
約翰!
Johnny!

658
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,802
好久不見了
It's been so damn long...

659
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,674
我還以為你忘了卡爾叔叔了
I thought you'd forgotten your Uncle Karl.

660
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,241
你這小壞蛋!
You son of a gun!

661
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,783
卡爾叔叔?
Uncle Karl?

662
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,414
等一下
Wait.

663
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,082
那是我嗎?
Is that me?

664
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,320
是啊
Yeah.

665
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,394
我在貝殼海灘長大?
Shell Beach is where I grew up?

666
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:36,598
我說過了
That's what I said.

667
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,005
貝殼海灘 你的家鄉
Shell Beach, your hometown.

668
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,868
我要到那去 卡爾 要怎麼過去?
I need to get there, Karl. How do I get there?

669
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,905
我不知道
I don't know.

670
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,707
我有好些年沒待那了
I haven't been there in years.

671
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,007
想想 你一定記得的
Come on. You must remember.

672
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,075
一定會有點印象
You gotta have some idea.

673
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,016
想一想!
Come on!

674
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,915
約翰 對不起
Sorry, Johnny.

675
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,290
老了 腦筋不中用了
The old cracker barrel ain't what it used to be.

676
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,489
那裡好亮
So bright there.

677
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,595
光明的時代吧 我想
Brighter times, I guess.

678
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,901
你老愛在本子上亂塗亂畫
You were always scribbling in that damn book.

679
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,066
那是我和你爸爸
That's me and your pa.

680
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,268
多帥的兩傻瓜
What a couple of handsome fools.

681
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,604
我父母怎麼了
What happened to my parents?

682
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,744
他們現在在哪裡?
Where are they now?

683
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,710
他們去世了 約翰
They're dead, Johnny.

684
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,188
房子起火 他們被燒死了
They died when their house burnt down.

685
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,884
我把你養大
I looked after you.

686
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,793
你真的都不記得了?
You don't remember that, really?

687
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,463
那是什麼?
What's that?

688
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,900
那是什麼?
What is that?

689
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,001
那是傷疤
It's a scar.

690
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,935
火災中你的手臂燒傷很嚴重
You burnt your arm pretty bad in the fire.

691
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,982
這是什麼意思?
What does it mean, Johnny?

692
01:00:54,982 --> 01:00:56,782
意思是 這些都是謊言!
It means these are all lies!

693
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,658
你為什麼來這 默多剋夫人?
Why are you here, Mrs. Murdoch?

694
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:14,069
我丈夫告訴我他曾來過這
My husband told me he'd been here.

695
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:20,371
他告訴我他想考驗自己
He told me he wanted to test himself...

696
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,443
想知道
see if he was...

697
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,948
他是否...
capable of...

698
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,788
我想來和她談談
I wanted to talk to her.

699
01:01:36,788 --> 01:01:38,958
我想也許她能幫我找到她
I thought maybe she could help me find him.

700
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,597
呆在這 我打電話通知警局
Stay here. I'm gonna call the station.

701
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:55,274
是的 我是巴姆斯泰德
Yeah, this is Bumstead.

702
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:59,077
請讓驗屍官到1440號...東邊 對
Send the homicide coroner to 1440... East, yeah.

703
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,189
又死了一個
There's been another one.

704
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,815
一樣的手法 你來了再跟你細說
It's the same pattern. I'll explain when you get here.

705
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,826
噢 天啊
Oh, God.

706
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,662
沒事的 我不會傷害你
It's OK. I won't hurt you.

707
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,393
沒事的
It's OK.

708
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,682
她從哪冒出來的?
Where the hell did she come from?

709
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,206
我看到她藏在裡面
I found her hiding.

710
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,783
她都看到了
She saw what happened here.

711
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,907
你要回家嗎 默多剋夫人
Are you ready to go home, Mrs. Murdoch?

712
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,612
探長要送我回去 謝謝你
The inspector is gonna take me. Thanks.

713
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:36,773
它真漂亮
It's beautiful.

714
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,147
是我媽媽送給我的
It was a gift from my mother.

715
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,910
她剛去世
She died recently.

716
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,552
我隨身帶著它來紀念她
I keep it with me to remind me of her.

717
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,857
抱歉
I'm sorry.

718
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,308
奇怪的是
It's a funny thing, though.

719
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,865
我記不清她什麼時候送給我了
I can't remember when she gave it to me.

720
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,429
這種事情我怎麼會忘記?
How do you think I could forget a thing like that?

721
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:10,773
你有常常回想過去嗎 默多剋夫人?
Do you think about the past much, Mrs. Murdoch?

722
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,413
到底發生了什麼 探長?
What's happening, Inspector?

723
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,447
我也不知道
I'm not sure I know anymore.

724
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,216
你的房間我原封不動
I left your old room like it was.

725
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,687
你今晚在這睡吧 好不?
You can sleep here tonight, huh?

726
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,060
真高興看到你回來 約翰...
Glad to have you back, Johnny...

727
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,793
就算你只回來一晚
even if it is for just a night.

728
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:31,822
卡爾
Karl.

729
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,197
那鍾准嗎?
Is that the right time?

730
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,569
當然了 怎麼會不准
Why, sure.

731
01:04:35,869 --> 01:04:38,139
買來後一向很準
That clock's kept perfect time since I bought it.

732
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,971
上午還是下午?
A.m. Or p. M?

733
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,577
你在想什麼 約翰?
What do you think, Johnny?

734
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,603
我不明白 為什麼現在就是晚上了?
I don't understand. How can it be night already?

735
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,342
白天發生了什麼 我怎麼會不記得?
What happened to the day? How'd I miss it?

736
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,249
你太累了 什麼都有可能
You're tired. Anything's possible.

737
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,684
這樣吧...
Look...

738
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,281
你先去睡會 明天起床再來搞清楚
get some sleep. We'll straighten all this out tomorrow.

739
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:23,050
貝殼海灘指南 約翰·默多克著
"Gulde to Shell Beach by Johnny Murdoch."

740
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,853
噢 怎麼什麼都沒
Oh, come on.

741
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,843
喂?      艾瑪 他在我這
- Hello?      - Emma, he's here.

742
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:51,005
他的舉止很怪異
He's acting mighty peculiar.

743
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,106
我知道 他已經不是他了
I know. He's not himself.

744
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,083
設法留住他 我馬上過去
Keep him there, and I'll be right over.

745
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,449
我試試      謝謝你 卡爾 再見
- I'll try.      - Thanks, Karl. Bye.

746
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,081
約翰
Johnny.

747
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,988
我沒法給出承諾 默多剋夫人
I can't promise anything, Mrs. Murdoch.

748
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,583
得看情況
We just have to play it as it comes.

749
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:08,119
約翰 我們只是想幫你
Johnny, we just wanted to help.

750
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,905
卡爾
Karl.

751
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,338
卡爾叔叔
Uncle Karl.

752
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:20,548
約翰 如果你有麻煩
Johnny, if you're in some kind of trouble...

753
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:22,071
我們能一起幫你
well, maybe we could do something.

754
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:26,014
好久不見你了
Haven't seen you in so long.

755
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,940
是的
Yes.

756
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:45,993
默多克先生 你惹了不少麻煩
Mr. Murdoch... you've been the cause of much distress.

757
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,466
從實招來      沒必要這麼做
- Start talking.      - There's no need for this.

758
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:53,866
你無路可逃
There's no escape.

759
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,894
城市是我們的 我們創造了它
The city's ours. We made it.

760
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,428
你在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

761
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:00,670
我們用偷來的記憶創造了這座城市...
We fashioned this city on stolen memories...

762
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:04,543
不同的年代 不同的過去融為一體
different eras, different pasts all rolled into one.

763
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,071
每晚對它進行修改和完善
Each night, we revise it, refine it...

764
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,606
為了學習
in order to learn.

765
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,050
學習什麼?
Learn what?

766
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,553
你 默多克先生
About you, Mr. Murdoch...

767
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,851
你和你的同類
you and your fellow inhabitants...

768
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,686
學習什麼使人之為人
what makes you human.

769
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:19,251
為什麼?      我們得像你們一樣
- Why?!      - We need to be like you.

770
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:22,595
我現在很瞭解你 默多克先生
I understand you now, Mr. Murdoch.

771
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:24,792
我記得你已經忘卻的...
I remember that which you do not...

772
01:08:24,792 --> 01:08:26,192
你已經忘卻的往事
what you've been missing.

773
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,896
海洋 是的...
The ocean, yes...

774
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,566
小時候在海邊的玩耍
running along the waves as a child...

775
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,988
與艾瑪在河邊的相遇
meeting Emma at the river...

776
01:08:33,988 --> 01:08:36,576
還有難忘的初吻
That first kiss that followed.

777
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:38,306
你到底是什麼
What are you?

778
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,110
你已經知道我們是什麼了
You've seen what we are.

779
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:43,084
死人是我們的容器
We use your dead as vessels.

780
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:53,770
上車!
Get in!

781
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,756
那她呢 有印象嗎?
What about her? Ring any bells?

782
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,131
我離開時她還活著
She was alive when I left her.

783
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:14,260
那這個呢?
What about this?

784
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,328
這什麼都不是 這個...
This is nothing. This is...

785
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,670
肯定意味著什麼 這些圖畫
It must mean something, all those pictures.

786
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:19,867
什麼圖畫?
What pictures?

787
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:21,900
我不明白這是怎麼回事
I don't understand this.

788
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,777
別裝了 默多克先生 別向我撒謊!
Stop playing games with me, Murdoch! Stop telling me lies!

789
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,303
我沒有撒謊!
I am not telling you lies!

790
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,748
告訴我為什麼 讓我搞明白
Help me out here. Make me understand.

791
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,877
我試著破解這拼圖迷題
I have this jigsaw puzzle in front of my face...

792
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,811
每次我拼湊起來
and every time I try to rearrange the pieces,

793
01:11:32,811 --> 01:11:33,911
圖畫都沒有意義
it still doesn't make any sense.

794
01:11:33,911 --> 01:11:35,321
你以為我明白?
You think it makes sense to me?

795
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,416
我和你一樣莫名其妙
I'm as much in the dark here as you are.

796
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:39,620
讓我問你個問題?
You let me ask you a question?

797
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,328
你聽過貝殼海灘這個地方嗎?
You heard of a place called Shell Beach?

798
01:11:42,328 --> 01:11:44,655
當然      你知道怎麼到那裡嗎?
- Sure.      - You know how to get there?

799
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,133
知道      那你告訴我
- Yeah.      - You tell me?

800
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:50,298
好 你只要...到...
All right. You just... You go to the...

801
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,264
哪兒 該到哪兒?
Where? Where do you go?

802
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,401
再讓我想想 好嗎?
Just give me a second, will ya?

803
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,239
你記不起來是不是?
You can't remember, can you?

804
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,982
你不覺得很奇怪嗎?
You think that's kind of odd?

805
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,008
等下
Wait.

806
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,453
我再問你個容易點的問題
I got a better one for you.

807
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,785
你還記不記得
When was the last time...

808
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,690
上一個白天做了什麼?
you remember doing something during the day?

809
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:11,818
什麼意思?
What do you mean?

810
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,124
我的意思是...在白天的時候
I just mean... during the day.

811
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,190
白晝
Daylight.

812
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,789
你最後一次見到白天是什麼時候?
When was the last time you remember seeing it?

813
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,085
我不是指
And I'm not talking about

814
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,637
遙遠的 模糊的童年回憶
some distant, half-forgotten childhood memory.

815
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:24,485
而是昨天? 上周? 什麼時候見到白天?
I mean like yesterday? Last week? When?

816
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,207
能記起分毫嗎?
Can you come up with a single memory?

817
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,006
記不起來 對不對?
You can't, can you?

818
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:33,310
你知道嗎? 我認為太陽
You know something? I don't think the sun even...

819
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,045
在這裡甚至都不存在
exists... in this place.

820
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,819
因為我醒了很久
'Cause I've been up for hours and hours and hours

821
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:40,500
夜晚從沒結束過
and the night never ends here.

822
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,751
這很荒唐      你說對了 就是很荒唐
- That is crazy.      - You're damn right this is crazy.

823
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,158
聽我說 巴姆斯泰德 不只是我
Listen to me, Bumstead. It's not just me.

824
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,220
我們所有人
It's all of us.

825
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,821
我們都被他們控制了
They're doing something to all of us.

826
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,629
閉嘴 我聽夠了      請聽我說
- Shut up, I've heard enough.      - Please listen.

827
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:54,397
你閉嘴 閉嘴!      聽我說
- Shut up, will ya! Shut up!      - Listen to me.

828
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,911
一定能找到答案
There has to be an explanation for this somewhere.

829
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,389
你解釋下這現象
Explain this.

830
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,208
約翰 對不起
John, I'm so sorry.

831
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,014
我不想傷害你 約翰
I never meant to hurt you, John...

832
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,177
但我那麼做了 我不知道為什麼會那樣
and I did it, and I don't know why I did.

833
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,380
我想重新來過
I wish I could take it all back.

834
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,947
不 艾瑪 你沒有出軌
No. Emma... You didn't do it.

835
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,755
你的外遇 不管那是什麼
This... affair of yours, whatever it is...

836
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,421
你認為你做過的事情
the thing you're supposed to have done...

837
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,327
其實並沒有做 我認為它壓根就沒發生
you didn't do it. I don't believe it ever happened.

838
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,763
這是什麼意思?
What do you mean?

839
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,165
聽起來很荒唐
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

840
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:02,102
但我們也許素不相識
but what if we never knew each other before now?

841
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:04,571
我們第一次見面
What if the first time we ever met...

842
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:08,440
應該是昨晚在你的...在我們的公寓裡
was last night in your... in our apartment...

843
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,022
你所記得的
and everything you remember...

844
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,180
還有我本該記得的
and everything that I'm supposed to remember

845
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,480
從來沒發生過?
never really happened?

846
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,910
有人想讓我們認為它發生過
Someone just wants us to think it did.

847
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:24,456
回到公寓...
You know, back in the apartment...

848
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,694
我忽然覺得我根本不認識你
I suddenly felt like I didn't know you at all.

849
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,989
你似乎就是個陌生人
It was as if you were a stranger.

850
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,998
但那怎麼會如此真實?
But how can that be true?

851
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:39,535
我仍然記得你我的相遇
I so vividly remember meeting you.

852
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,442
我仍然記得與你相愛
I remember falling in love with you.

853
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,443
我仍然記得我是怎樣失去你
I remember losing you.

854
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:47,839
時間到
Time's up.

855
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:50,674
不 等等
No, wait, wait.

856
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,846
請等等 就...
Please, just...

857
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:53,980
就一會
just one more minute.

858
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,623
我愛你 約翰
I love you, John.

859
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:08,163
那是無法作假的
You can't fake something like that.

860
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,468
沒錯
No, you can't.

861
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,562
探長? 長官?
Inspector? Sir?

862
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,732
瓦倫斯基探長昨晚自殺了
Detective Walenski killed himself last night.

863
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:50,541
我...覺得你該知道下
I... kind of thought you should know.

864
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:56,043
噢 還有 局長要見你
Oh, and... the chief wanted to see you.

865
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:57,978
長官...
Sir...

866
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,050
我知道你會抓到兇手的 長官
I knew you'd track the killer down, sir.

867
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:19,763
長官...
Sir...

868
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,734
鞋帶
shoelace.

869
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,151
有什麼要幫忙的嗎 先生?
How can we help you, sir?

870
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:39,558
那你就睡吧
You can sleep.

871
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:42,686
先生...
Gentlemen...

872
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,289
睡吧 睡吧
Sleep. Sleep.

873
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,198
晚上好 長官
Evening, sir.

874
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,138
巴姆斯泰德
Bumstead.

875
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:04,279
我要首先祝賀你...
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you...

876
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:05,980
關於這起案子
about the case.

877
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,088
帶我們去見默多克
Take us to Murdoch.

878
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,218
睡吧
Sleep.

879
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,220
施列伯醫生
Dr. Schreber.

880
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,154
我知道你一定會來的
I knew you'd come eventually.

881
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,264
現在能告訴我
Don't you think it's about time

882
01:17:45,264 --> 01:17:46,888
是怎麼回事嗎?
you started giving me some answers?

883
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,123
好的 當然
Yes. Yes, of course.

884
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,893
不坐下來談?
Won't you please sit down?

885
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,027
我常常來這裡
I come here quite often.

886
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,539
這裡是少有的能讓我有片刻寧靜的地方
It's one of the few places I'm allowed a moment's peace.

887
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:01,940
他們很討厭水
You see, they have an aversion to water.

888
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:05,045
甚至可以說恐懼
One could almost call it a phobia.

889
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,879
他們是誰 他們想從我身上得到什麼?
Who are they? What do they want from me?

890
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,000
好的
Right.

891
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,578
現在 讓我先說
Well, for now, let's just say...

892
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:15,317
你是他們的試驗品
that you were the subject of their experiment.

893
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:16,722
我們都是
We all are.

894
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,661
你沒瘋 約翰
You're not crazy, John.

895
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,459
你也不是殺人犯
And you are not a murderer.

896
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,163
我很抱歉 真的
I'm sorry about this. I truly am.

897
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:28,726
但我們時間不多
But we do not have much time...

898
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,398
我只能這麼做
and I cannot afford the luxury of doing this the right way.

899
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,964
你想知道的一切
Everything you need to know...

900
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,340
答案都在這支注射器裡
all the answers are in this syringe.

901
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,571
我想你得注射它
I need you to inject yourself.

902
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:39,211
這是你明白一切的唯一辦法
It's the only way to make you understand.

903
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:40,344
你在開玩笑嗎?
You're kidding me, right?

904
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,351
我們時間不多了 你得馬上注射
We're running out of time, John. You have to do this now.

905
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:45,419
把槍給我 醫生
Give me the gun, Doctor.

906
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,888
探長 他很困擾
Inspector, he is more disturbed than we thought.

907
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,653
我不像你會分析個性
I may not be the judge of personality that you are...

908
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:53,661
醫生 不過在我看來你是瘋子
Doctor, but you're the one who looks disturbed to me.

909
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,360
你不知道你在做什麼
You do not know what you are doing.

910
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:01,661
這個 到底是什麼...醫生?
What, exactly is in this... Doctor?

911
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,099
你尋找的答案 約翰
All the answers you've been looking for, John.

912
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,232
我發誓
I swear to you.

913
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,789
這樣的話 那我就先收好...
Guess I'll just have to hold on to it for...

914
01:19:10,789 --> 01:19:12,242
替你保管了
safekeeping.

915
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,075
如果你不介意的話
If you don't mind.

916
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,481
我們走吧 醫生
Let's go, Doctor.

917
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:22,188
走? 去哪裡?      貝殼海灘
- Go? Where are we going?      - Shell Beach.

918
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,391
你要去那裡 不是嗎?
That's where you want to go, isn't it?

919
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:27,219
海洋
The ocean.

920
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,761
你為什麼要幫我?
Why are you doing this?

921
01:19:39,204 --> 01:19:41,201
你想得到什麼
What do you hope to gain by helping me?

922
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:42,501
真相
The truth.

923
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,447
沒有地圖標出往海邊走的路
None of these maps extend far enough to show the ocean.

924
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:47,880
在那你們什麼都找不到的...
You won't find anything there...

925
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,850
我跟你們說 我到過那 而且...
I promise you! I've been there, and...

926
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,410
如果你到過那裡 你帶路 好嗎?
If you've been there, you can show us the way, then, can't you?

927
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,113
我們自己找
We'll see for ourselves.

928
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:57,415
我不會帶路的
I won't.

929
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:01,123
我拒絕 你們別逼我去那裡!
I refuse. You can't make me go there!

930
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,536
你在說話嗎 醫生?
You were saying, doctor?

931
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:30,816
我不明白 這裡本來有座橋
I don't understand. Used to be a bridge here.

932
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,158
有種再試一次
Try that again, your friends are gonna be...

933
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,532
就把你丟到河裡去
fishing you out of the canal.

934
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:41,968
別傷害我 我告訴你一切
Just don't hurt me. I'll tell you everything.

935
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,028
反正都已經無所謂了
It doesn't matter anymore anyway.

936
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,139
什麼?
What?

937
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:57,181
你是誰?
Who are you people?

938
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,850
安娜 我們很快就會給你好東西
We will give you some more pretty things soon... Anna.

939
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:07,522
我不是安娜
I'm not Anna.

940
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,297
你很快就會是 是的
You will be soon, yes.

941
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,237
她還有其他用途
I have another use for her first.

942
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:30,179
首先是黑暗 然後來了陌生種族
First there was darkness. Then came the strangers.

943
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,652
他們把我們綁走 帶到這裡
They abducted us and brought us here.

944
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:38,688
這座城市 還有裡面的所有人
This city, everyone in it...

945
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,092
都是他們的試驗品
is their experiment.

946
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:43,029
他們隨意混合和搭配我們的記憶
They mix and match our memories as they see fit...

947
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:45,828
試圖想要破解我們人類的秘密
trying to divine what makes us unique.

948
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,298
第一天 一個人可能是個探長
One day, a man might be an inspector.

949
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:52,238
第二天就會是完全不同的人
The next, someone entirely different.

950
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:55,573
如果他們想研究殺人兇手
When they want to study a murderer for instance...

951
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,994
他們只要給其中一人
they simply imprint one of their citizens

952
01:21:57,994 --> 01:21:59,874
注射一個新的人性就行了
with a new personality...

953
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:04,575
為他安排家庭 朋友 和過去
arrange a family for him, friends, an entire history...

954
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:06,411
甚至還有丟失的錢包
even a lost wallet.

955
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:08,683
然後他們觀察結果
Then they observe the results.

956
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,251
如果一個人 被賦予了殺手的記憶
Will a man, given the history of a killer,

957
01:22:12,251 --> 01:22:14,251
是否會繼續殺人?
continue in that vein?

958
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:18,255
或者說 我們僅僅是記憶的總和?
Or are we, in fact, more than the mere sum of our memories?

959
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,700
你成為一名殺手
This business of you being a killer

960
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,265
是不幸的巧合
was an unhappy coincidence.

961
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:26,205
在這之前你已有了數十次人生
You have had dozens of lives before now.

962
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:27,336
你碰巧醒來
You just happened to wake up

963
01:22:27,336 --> 01:22:29,574
在我為你注射這次人生的時候
while I was imprinting you with this one.

964
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,472
他們為什麼要這麼做?
Why are they doing all of this?

965
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,725
我們的個性
It is our capacity for individuality...

966
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,411
我們的靈魂使我們有別於他們
our souls that makes us different from them.

967
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:40,919
他們想透過研究記憶
They think they can find the human soul...

968
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,984
來幫助他們找尋人類的靈魂
if they understand how our memories work.

969
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,387
他們只有團體記憶
All they have are collective memories.

970
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,260
和團體思想
They share one group mind.

971
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:49,763
他們快滅亡了
They're dying, you see?

972
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,000
整個種族瀕臨滅絕
Their entire race is on the brink of extinction.

973
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:55,133
他們認為我們能夠拯救他們
They think we can save them.

974
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,604
我是什麼角色?      你與眾不同 約翰
- Where do I fit in?      - You are different, John.

975
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,072
你阻止了我的注射
You resisted my attempt to imprint you.

976
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:09,115
你還有了調諧的能力
Somehow you have developed their ability to tune.

977
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,447
那是他們改變物體的能力
That is how they change things.

978
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,209
他們用這能力建造了這座城市
That is how they built this city.

979
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:14,954
他們有一部深埋在地下的機器
They have machines buried deep beneath the surface...

980
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,926
能夠集中他們的精神力
that allow them to focus their telepathic energies.

981
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:22,285
他們控制這裡的一切 甚至太陽
They control everything here, even the sun.

982
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,663
他們不喜歡光亮 所以這裡只有夜晚
That's why it's always dark. They can't stand the light.

983
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,962
那他們要你作什麼?
So why do they need you?

984
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,715
他們剛把我們帶到這裡時
When they first brought us here,

985
01:23:28,715 --> 01:23:31,405
需要從我們中提取記憶
they extracted what was in us.

986
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,273
來儲存信息
So they could store the information,

987
01:23:33,273 --> 01:23:35,273
像塗料般混在一起
remix it like so much paint...

988
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,835
然後給我們注入他們選的記憶
and give us back new memories of their choosing.

989
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:41,508
但他們需要專家幫忙
But they still needed an artist to help them.

990
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:46,514
我比他們更瞭解
I understood the intricacies of the human mind...

991
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:49,079
人類錯綜複雜的思想
better than they ever could...

992
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,854
所以他們還讓我做科學家
so they allowed me to keep my skills as a scientist...

993
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:53,326
因為他們需要我的技術
because they needed them.

994
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,829
不過他們讓我抹去其他東西
But they made me delete everything else.

995
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:07,038
你知道被迫抹去
Can you imagine what it is like being forced...

996
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,804
自己的過去是什麼滋味嗎?
to erase your own past?

997
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:12,176
那我的過去和我的童年呢?
What about my past? What about my childhood?

998
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,227
貝殼海灘 卡爾叔叔
Shell Beach, Uncle Karl.

999
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,848
這個呢?
What about this?

1000
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,653
我找到時是空白的
This was blank when I found it!

1001
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,713
你還是不明白 約翰
You still don't understand, John.

1002
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,954
你在這裡...從來就沒有童年
You were never a boy... not in this place.

1003
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:28,792
你的過去都是幻覺  是虛構的
Your entire history is an illusion, a fabrication...

1004
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,695
我們大家都一樣
as it is with all of us.

1005
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,223
這些畫只是你信手塗鴉的而已
You made those drawings happen with your gift.

1006
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,133
你說他們把我們帶到這來
You say they brought us here.

1007
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:38,098
從哪帶過來
From where?

1008
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:42,934
對不起
I'm sorry.

1009
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,542
我記不起來
I don't remember.

1010
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,609
我們中沒人記得
None of us remember that...

1011
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,908
我們曾經是誰...
what we once were...

1012
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,685
我們住在哪裡..
what we might have been...

1013
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,785
在某處吧
somewhere else.

1014
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,240
我只能把你們帶到這來
I've taken you this far.

1015
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,401
你們用不著我了
You don't need me anymore.

1016
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,240
我們走吧
Let's go.

1017
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,260
約翰
John.

1018
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:04,154
沒有海洋 約翰
There is no ocean, John.

1019
01:26:05,192 --> 01:26:07,722
城外什麼都沒有
There is nothing beyond the city.

1020
01:26:09,163 --> 01:26:11,696
家這個地方
The only place home exists...

1021
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:15,526
只存在於腦海中
is in your head.

1022
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,608
不! 不!
No! No!

1023
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,478
約翰 住手!
John, stop!

1024
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:31,177
不!
No!

1025
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,185
住手!
Stop!

1026
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,056
求你們了
Please!

1027
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:44,091
不!
No!

1028
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:04,745
現在你們知道真相了
And now you know the truth.

1029
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:25,367
不!
No!

1030
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:16,289
你最好投降 默多克先生
You'll allow yourself to surrender, Mr. Murdoch...

1031
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,554
要不然我就殺了她 知道不?
or it will result in this one's death, yes?

1032
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,118
我管不著 她又不是我真正的妻子
What do I care? She's not my real wife!

1033
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,288
對我而言 她什麼都不是
She's nothing to me!

1034
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:26,562
但你仍然在意 對不對 默多克先生?
But you do still care, don't you, Mr. Murdoch?

1035
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:29,263
你瞧 你做不成殺人狂
You see, I have become the monster...

1036
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,295
那我來替你做
you were intended to be.

1037
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:37,009
要我替你殺了她嗎?
Shall I end her life now as you would have?

1038
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:42,278
請別傷害她!
Don't hurt her, please!

1039
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:46,047
那就投降吧 默多克先生
Then surrender, Mr. Murdoch.

1040
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:48,615
睡吧
Sleep.

1041
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:52,653
現在睡吧
Now.

1042
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:55,556
約翰?
John?

1043
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,339
睡吧
Sleep.

1044
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:37,068
醫生說得對 他進化了
The doctor was right. He has evolved.

1045
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:38,962
殺了他
Kill him.

1046
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,867
殺了他! 殺了他!
Kill him! Kill him!

1047
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,509
殺了他! 殺了他!
Kill him! Kill him!

1048
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:52,709
他很強大 是的
He is powerful, yes.

1049
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:57,214
而且危險 不過他能帶我們找到
Dangerous. But he can also lead us to what we seek.

1050
01:29:57,258 --> 01:30:00,659
醫生所說的靈魂
What the doctor calls the soul.

1051
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:04,392
現在我們的試驗即將進入最終階段
It is time for our experiment to move into a final phase.

1052
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:07,162
我們不再需要其他的實驗品
We no longer need the other subjects.

1053
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:10,830
研究結束了
The time for study is over.

1054
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:15,070
現在該和約翰·默多克合為一體了
It is time to be one with John Murdoch.

1055
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,580
是時候了 醫生
It is time, Doctor.

1056
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:25,176
注射
Imprint.

1057
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:30,719
關閉!
Shut it down!

1058
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:33,921
永遠關閉!
Shut it down forever!

1059
01:30:48,059 --> 01:30:49,573
你在做什麼
What are you doing?

1060
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:54,639
他們想把團體記憶注射入你體內
They want to imprint you with their own collective memories.

1061
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:57,921
他們想讓你成為他們的一員
They want to make you one of them,

1062
01:30:57,921 --> 01:31:00,649
這樣就能共享你的靈魂
so they can share your soul.

1063
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,592
注射 醫生 不許違抗命令
Imprint, Doctor. No more disobedience.

1064
01:31:08,829 --> 01:31:10,460
對不起 約翰
I'm sorry, John.

1065
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:13,490
只會痛一會
The pain will only last a moment.

1066
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:16,603
不!
No!

1067
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,309
記起來 約翰
Remember, John.

1068
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:29,550
你會很有出息的 我的孩子
You'll rise to greater heights than that, my boy.

1069
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:31,347
等你長大了 你就明白了
One day when you're older, you'll understand.

1070
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,485
記起來
Remember.

1071
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:38,423
就是這樣 約翰 熟能生巧
That's it, John. Practice makes perfect.

1072
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:41,656
記住我跟你說的 別和陌生人說話
Now remember what I told you. Never talk to strangers.

1073
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,293
記起來 約翰
John, remember.

1074
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:44,598
你可能在奇怪
You're probably wondering

1075
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:46,398
為什麼我一直出現在你的記憶裡
why I keep appearing in your memories.

1076
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:48,959
因為我將自己加入你的記憶中
It is because I have inserted myself in them.

1077
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:51,096
這些記憶都是炮製來
All of these memories have been fabricated...

1078
01:31:51,138 --> 01:31:52,833
來告訴你異族人的一切
to teach you about the strangers.

1079
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:56,002
一針 就給你畢生的知識
Give you a lifetime of knowledge in a single syringe.

1080
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:01,212
你會活下來的 約翰
You will survive, John.

1081
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:03,547
你會發掘到你潛在的力量
You will find strength within yourself...

1082
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:05,552
來戰勝他們
and you will prevail.

1083
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:06,951
記住
Remember.

1084
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:08,711
你好 卡爾叔叔
Hi, Uncle Karl.

1085
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:09,745
約翰!
Johnny!

1086
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,853
你找到竅門了 約翰
You're getting the hang of it, John.

1087
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:16,955
也許有一天我會為你工作
Maybe one day I'll be working for you.

1088
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:20,006
這是異族人用的機器
This is the machine the strangers use

1089
01:32:20,006 --> 01:32:21,229
來增強他們的精神力
to amplify their thoughts.

1090
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:23,100
那些機器改變了他們的世界
The machine that changes their world.

1091
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:24,495
你必須控制它
You must take control of it.

1092
01:32:24,579 --> 01:32:26,626
你必須將它佔為己有
You must make the machine yours.

1093
01:32:26,626 --> 01:32:28,334
我知道你能打敗他們 約翰
I know you can beat them, John.

1094
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,867
但你要集中精神
But you must concentrate.

1095
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,172
有點不對頭
Something's wrong.

1096
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:45,553
現在不是談情說愛的時候 約翰
There is no time for romance, John.

1097
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:47,525
現在世界在你手中
The world can be what you make it.

1098
01:32:47,987 --> 01:32:49,387
你做了什麼?
What have you done?

1099
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:52,556
你現在有創造一切的力量
You have the power to make anything happen...

1100
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,090
但你必須馬上行動
but you must act now!

1101
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:40,453
我知道你做得到 約翰
I knew you could do it, John.

1102
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:42,512
你已經有了他們的力量
You have their power now.

1103
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:44,421
你控制了他們的機器
You control their machines.

1104
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:45,857
艾瑪在哪裡?
Where's Emma?

1105
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:49,427
她不再是艾瑪了 約翰
She is not Emma anymore, John.

1106
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:50,862
她被重新注射了
She has been reimprinted.

1107
01:37:50,898 --> 01:37:52,593
那麼找回她的記憶
So give her back her memories.

1108
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:55,067
我辦不到 異族人
I can't. The facility where the strangers...

1109
01:37:55,102 --> 01:37:58,000
儲藏記憶的機器已經被摧毀了
stored the memories has been destroyed.

1110
01:37:58,138 --> 01:37:59,299
對不起
I'm sorry.

1111
01:38:00,341 --> 01:38:03,037
你現在有什麼打算 約翰?
What are you going to do now, John?

1112
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:08,579
你說我有那力量 對不對?
You told me I had the power, didn't you?

1113
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:11,974
我能操縱這些機器 做我想做的
I can make these machines do anything I want.

1114
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,452
任意創造這世上的一切
Make this world anything I want it to be.

1115
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:20,616
只要我足夠集中注意力
Just so long as I concentrate hard enough.

1116
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:45,777
你要去哪裡?

貝殼海灘

1118
01:40:31,058 --> 01:40:32,457
多少錢?      二毛五
- What's the fare?      - Quarter.

1119
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:39,688
你坐吧
Oh, please.

1120
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:42,258
噢 不...      沒關係

約翰...
John...

1123
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:31,476
我一直在等你
Been waiting for you, yes?

1124
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:33,379
你做了什麼?
What are you doing?

1125
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,787
我只是做了些變動
I'm just making a few little changes around here, is all.

1126
01:41:36,824 --> 01:41:38,519
那是我們要的嗎?
Are we sure that's what we want?

1127
01:41:39,026 --> 01:41:41,460
我願意冒這個險
I'm prepared to take my chances.

1128
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:43,053
我快死了 約翰
I'm dying, John.

1129
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:45,998
你的記憶不允許我們的存在
Your imprint is not agreeable with my kind.

1130
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:49,765
但我想知道那是什麼...
But I wanted to know what it was like...

1131
01:41:51,138 --> 01:41:52,605
你的感覺
how you feel.

1132
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,335
你知道我以前是什麼感覺
You know how I was supposed to feel.

1133
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:59,175
那人不是我 從來就不是
That person isn't me. Never was.

1134
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:02,944
你們想知道是什麼使人之為人
You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human.

1135
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:07,651
你們在這就能找到答案
Well, you're not going to find it... in here.

1136
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:12,017
你們以前找錯地方了
You went looking in the wrong place.

1137
01:43:50,424 --> 01:43:52,224
這裡好美
It's so beautiful here.

1138

So bright.

1139
01:44:05,038 --> 01:44:07,871
貝殼海灘是不是在附近?
Do you know if Shell Beach is around here?

1140
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:10,536
我想它在那邊
I think that's it just over there.

1141
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:30,754
我要到那去
I'm headed that way myself.

1142
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,724
要不要一起過去?
Would you like to join me?

1143
01:44:36,903 --> 01:44:37,892
當然
Sure.

1144
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:45,442
對了 我叫安娜
I'm Anna, by the way.

1145
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:48,243
你叫什麼名字?      約翰
