00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:29,447
他们叫我来见你

171
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,415
他叫约翰.默多克

172
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:37,482
默多克女士 之前为何不报案

173
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:40,559
我是说  既然你丈夫失踪

174
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,725
已经长达…

175
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:45,460
我那时以为他只是和我耍脾气

176
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:50,594
然后有名医生…今晚找上我

177
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,266
你们结婚多久了？

178
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,604
快4年了

179
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,575
为什么这么问？

180
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:59,630
因为你似乎并不喜欢戴着戒指

181
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:03,411
好像戴着很不习惯

182
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:04,885
不 我从不把它摘下来

183
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,887
你认识这些人吗？

184
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,736
不 她们是谁

185
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,334
你们为什么要找我丈夫

186
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,906
他犯了什么罪？

187
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:30,241
他涉嫌谋杀

188
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,303
杀了谁？

189
00:17:32,714 --> 00:17:36,411
哪一个？　　全部

190
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:39,581
默多克夫人 对不起 我很抱歉

191
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,679
我无意吓你

192
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:43,282
我不该来这 你我都错了

193
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:44,792
默多克夫人  如果你不介意

194
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:47,260
请给我点时间解释…

195
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,588
我一会就回来

196
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:18,055
我们见过面吗？

197
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:21,722
如果有 希望你还活着

198
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:23,390
甜心 你叫什么名字？

199
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,432
约翰

200
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:28,932
嗯 我的顾客都能自称约翰

201
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:30,827
是

202
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,173
我在想

203
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:43,942
你为什么干这一行…

204
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:48,486
有点危险…

205
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:50,514
例如现在

206
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,288
我的意思是 你怎知我不是杀手？

207
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:55,524
你看上去不像？为什么这么问

208
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:59,257
难道你有什么特别需要吗？

209
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:22,381
啊 真可恶

210
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:07,021
[杀手再袭！]

211
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:08,099
[杀人犯的追捕仍在继续]

212
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,183
[街头杀手仍逍遥法外]

213
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:24,780
似乎你已发现了你的恶劣本性

214
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:28,980
你们是谁？

215
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:32,687
我们也有此问 是吧？

216
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:35,322
沉睡吧

217
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,022
他懂得调谐

218
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:59,410
该怎么办？此人是危险人物

219
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:01,382
听说他也会调谐之术

220
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,781
不可能

221
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:05,616
我们亲眼所见

222
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:08,088
一般人如果没有注射

223
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:11,092
醒来后就会举止失常

224
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:14,755
像迷失的孩童一样四处游荡

225
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:16,957
但这个人不同 是吗？

226
00:22:16,998 --> 00:22:18,693
医生怎么说？

227
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,724
他还没报告

228
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,897
快先生呢？　　快先生不在了

229
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:26,931
他已经死了

230
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:32,572
可怜的快先生

231
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:35,481
书先生知道吗

232
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:38,649
我们不该知道吗 手先生？

233
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:42,488
我们本想获得更多讯息后再告诉你们

234
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:45,459
在抓到他之前我们什么都不会知道

235
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,088
夜先生 你负责搜索东方

236
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,928
面先生 你负责搜索西方

237
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,060
套先生 你负责搜索南方

238
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:56,332
影先生 你负责搜索北方

239
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,842
我们必须抓到他

240
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,124
你真的认为

241
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:19,483
我丈夫是连环杀人犯？

242
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:21,486
你呢？

243
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:26,222
希望是我判断失误吧

244
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:55,991
约翰

245
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,472
我好担心你

246
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,977
你是在惩罚我吗？

247
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,613
如果你用失踪来惩罚我

248
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:21,747
那我不喜欢

249
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,849
我不知道你在说什么

250
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:29,186
我在口袋里找到这些钥匙

251
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,926
于是我想我住在这里

252
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,730
你应该是我妻子吧？

253
00:24:33,768 --> 00:24:35,793
应该是？

254
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:37,862
约翰

255
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:40,136
难道你真的…

256
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:42,676
不知道我是谁？

257
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:44,639
你的医生找过我

258
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:46,169
这正是他担心的

259
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:47,704
我的医生？

260
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:50,274
是的 他…

261
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:52,343
给了我他的名片

262
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:54,912
他急着找你

00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:57,481
施列伯

264
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,889
我觉得自己活在别人的噩梦里

265
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:06,696
我到底怎么了 为什么我要去看医生？

266
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,562
因为我有外遇

267
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,073
你很生我的气

268
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,375
警察在找你

269
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:19,710
我知道 我有看报纸

270
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:22,308
“妓女杀手逍遥法外”

271
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,515
我和其中一名受害者在一起

272
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:31,254
就在昨晚

273
00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:33,587
我不明白

274
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:35,095
我在自助餐厅外遇见她

275
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:39,158
我也许是想试一下自己

276
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,136
我想知道我是不是杀人犯

277
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:45,539
我也许是疯了 但不管怎样

278
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,767
我还是我 不是杀人犯

279
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:55,583
我相信你

280
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:58,446
真的吗？

281
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:03,346
那是什么？

282
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:06,189
外面那辆车 你回来坐的那辆

283
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:08,559

站那别动！

287
00:26:19,841 --> 00:26:21,809
等下 你抓错人了

288
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:22,969
请站到旁边 好吗？

289
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,603
我没杀人

290
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:27,740
你现在只是嫌疑犯 跟我走

291
00:26:28,683 --> 00:26:30,241
我会听你解释

292
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:32,185
你不会相信我要说的话的

293
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:34,380

00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:42,389
而且我不知道是否…他们甚至不是…

00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:45,394
好吧 谁会听个疯子说话

298
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,230
请站到旁边 默多克夫人

299
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:48,394
快逃！

300
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,970

00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:46,850
就快到了 伙计

306
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:52,763
你知道怎么去贝壳海滩吗？

307
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:53,802
我怎么会不知道

308
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,802
我和老婆就是在那度蜜月的

309
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:58,567
只要你走主街西路…

310
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:03,104
还是要走跨…

311
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,773
好奇怪 我好像记不清

312
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:09,113
该走主街西路还是跨镇大道

313
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:17,315
对不起 探长 我很乐意协助你破案

314
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:19,223
但我和人有约 快迟到了

315
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,455
感谢你抽空来帮忙

316
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:32,069
有件事我仍然困惑不解

317
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:36,770
我办案生涯中见过不少杀人犯

318
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,473
但默多克不像是杀人犯

319
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:42,777
也许你还没去深入了解

320
00:28:42,777 --> 00:28:45,743
没人能骗得过我 医生

321
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:48,415
恕我冒昧 探长 你不是心理医生

324
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:56,026
当然

325
00:28:56,164 --> 00:28:58,189
以你为例

326
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:01,600
你是个挑剔的人 喜欢追根究底

327

真是不幸

334

要我们亲自来找你

335
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:15,536
你知道我们是多么讨厌

336
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:17,506
湿气

337
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:21,109
对不起 我…　　　没有报告 是的

338
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:23,777
我当时被吓到了 我的心脏很脆弱

339
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:27,686
我们认为 你脆弱的不是心脏

340
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:30,384
我们在他的旅馆房间里找到这个

341
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:34,361
我们是不是要再给默多克灌输记忆？

342
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:35,453
我试着给他注射

343
00:30:35,496 --> 00:30:37,623
但他醒了 把注射器给打碎了

344
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:39,758
我要阻止他 但他太快了

345
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:40,961
然后他失忆了？

346
00:30:41,002 --> 00:30:44,369
只有记忆碎片 因为程序被中断了

347
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:47,608
我想只要再抓到他就行了

348
00:30:47,942 --> 00:30:49,800
以前也抓过逃脱者 不是吗？

349
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:53,473
这个人不一样 医生 他会调谐

350
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:56,713
不可能 调谐只有你们会

351
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:57,751
你会重新

352
00:30:57,751 --> 00:31:01,051
给他灌输另一种模板记忆吧？

353
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:02,818
当然 我会再给他注射

354
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:07,351
不 这次我们另有目的

355
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:10,664
快午夜了 施列伯医生

356
00:31:10,698 --> 00:31:13,132
今晚调谐之后 我们再找你谈话 不过…

357
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:15,498
别再推迟 好吗？

358
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:20,337
你得绝对地服从

359
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:30,716
你看上去很虚弱 医生

360
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:34,978
该多锻炼锻炼

361
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:49,762
请进　　　凯特

362
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:56,537
他怎样了？　　　还是那样

363
00:31:57,912 --> 00:32:00,506
瓦伦斯基？是我 弗兰克

364
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:08,344
请进 弗兰克

365
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:12,425
把门关上

366
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:23,835
我看了你以前的报告

367
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:25,996
这案子很有意思

368
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:32,010
是能让人飞黄腾达

369
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,240
或者一蹶不振的案子

370
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:35,613
对 当时我负责那案子

371
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,916
后来呢 发生什么事 艾迪？

372
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:41,785
没什么 弗兰克

373
00:32:41,823 --> 00:32:44,224
我坐在地铁里

374
00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:45,953
不停地兜圈

375
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,893
不停地思考

376
00:32:48,796 --> 00:32:49,888
无路可逃

377
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:53,564
我到过这城市的每一个角落

378
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:00,672
你把你老婆吓死了 艾迪

379
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,403
她不是我老婆

380
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:06,880
我不认识她 我不认识每一个人

381
00:33:06,914 --> 00:33:08,848
为什么这么说？

382
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:10,942
你有没有常常回忆过去 弗兰克？

383
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,887
和你差不多吧

384
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:17,617
我一直努力去回忆

385
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:20,354
努力地想忆起过去的点点滴滴

386
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:22,614
我越回忆

387
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,642
越肯定

388
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:27,198
现在的一切都是虚无的

389
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:31,202
我们现在的生活就像一场梦

390
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:34,199
醒来后 就变成了另外一个人

391
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:36,073
一个完全不同的人

392
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:43,511
你是不是看到了什么 艾迪？

393
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:46,543
案子有线索了？

394
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:50,413
根本没有什么案子 从来就没有

395
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:55,095
只不过是场笑话 一场大笑话

396
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,334
今晚的材料是

397
00:34:38,372 --> 00:34:43,139
12本家庭相册 9本日记

398
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:48,114
17封情书 各种童年照片

399
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:52,245
26个钱包 身份证和社保卡

400
00:34:52,286 --> 00:34:54,379
这些东西的确能唤起记忆

401
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:58,987
这个还是温热的

402
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:00,823
里面会是怎样的记忆呢？

403
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:04,058
情圣的记忆？

404
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:07,044
还是猎艳名单呢？

405
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:08,658
答案即将揭晓

406
00:35:10,037 --> 00:35:12,267
你们不懂得品味其中滋味 是吧？

407
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:14,667
不管你是什么先生

408
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:19,078
你们从来就不知风流为何物

409
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:21,071
让我们瞧瞧

410
00:35:22,383 --> 00:35:25,079
些许不快乐的童年

411
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:33,621
再来些青春期的叛逆

412
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:38,194
最后 还少不了

413
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:40,496
家中亲人的故去

414
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:41,523
医生

415
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:44,762
书先生

416
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:53,975
为什么默多克

417
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:55,915
不像其他人在调谐的时候睡着

418
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,080
我不知道 也许他进化了吧

419
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:02,988
成为个怪胎 适应了环境

420
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:04,065
你们想要什么

421
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,425
你们不是来找寻人类灵魂的吗？

422
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,020
这不正是你们制造这小动物园的目的吗？

423
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,396
因此你们才每晚

424
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:12,396
变换人和物事

425
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:15,527
也许这就是你们想找的

426
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:16,763
它还能反咬你们…

427
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:24,370
得过好几代人 人类才能掌握我们的本领

428
00:36:24,412 --> 00:36:28,280
一个普通人能够调谐

429
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:29,840
很荒谬 我知道…

430
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:31,943
那你要怎么解释默多克的本领？

431
00:36:36,757 --> 00:36:38,748
是时候了

432
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:25,269
关闭

433
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:42,286
来此买报纸

434
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:55,530
我快疯了

435
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:57,002
我睡不着

436
00:37:57,037 --> 00:37:58,834
他们说我技艺不精

437
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:00,170
你觉得就你一个人难受？

438
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:02,072
你试试来照看那些鬼灵精

439
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:03,967
不管怎样

440
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:07,107
弗雷德里克森说他要把我换到早班

441
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:09,548
亲爱的 是该换了

442
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:26,315
有人在吗？

443
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:30,189
谁能听见我说话？

444
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:35,435
醒醒！

445
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:36,992
嘿！

446
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:40,738
醒醒！

447
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:42,674
醒醒！

448
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:45,845
醒醒！

449
00:39:47,648 --> 00:39:48,948
人都怎么了？

450
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:52,810
还有谁没睡着？

451
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,348
开始调谐

452
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:41,978
古德温一家  杰瑞米 西尔维娅

453
00:42:42,022 --> 00:42:44,320
珍妮和小马修

454
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:50,187
珍妮和小马修

455
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:22,989
富者愈富

456
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,693
醒来后 可能会多一间佣人房

457
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:21,684
我想你是施列伯医生

458
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:23,211
是你

459
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:24,656
嘿 别这样

460
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:26,886
可不能这么问候病人 医生

461
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:28,690
如果你是医生的话

462
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:30,128
默多克先生 拜托 我…

463
00:44:30,164 --> 00:44:32,029
这里怎么了 为什么大家都睡着了

464
00:44:32,065 --> 00:44:34,431
嘘 小点声

465
00:44:34,468 --> 00:44:36,402
为什么我失忆了 你对我做了什么

466
00:44:36,436 --> 00:44:39,200
什么都没做 别这样 我想帮你

467
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:40,536
在这不方便说话

468
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:41,775
不安全 如果他们看到

469
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:42,769
我们在这 他们会…

470
00:44:40,546 --> 00:44:40,546
我们在这 他们会…

471
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,243
我不管 我要你的解释

472
00:44:44,278 --> 00:44:45,609
现在就告诉我！

473
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:46,806
他们是谁？

474
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:48,781
为什么想杀我？

475
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:49,976
回答我！

476
00:44:55,222 --> 00:44:58,385
天啊 你真的有那本事

477
00:44:58,425 --> 00:44:59,382
我的本事？

478
00:44:59,382 --> 00:45:01,990
听我说 约翰 你有他们的能力

479
00:45:02,029 --> 00:45:04,122
你能单凭意志改变物体

480
00:45:04,164 --> 00:45:05,373
他们称之为调谐

481
00:45:05,373 --> 00:45:07,463
建筑就是这样被改变的

482
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:10,061
你自卫时能够不自觉地使用出来

483
00:45:10,103 --> 00:45:12,936
不过我能够让你运用自如

484
00:45:12,973 --> 00:45:15,305
让我来帮你 约翰 我们能阻止他们

485
00:45:15,342 --> 00:45:16,969
我们能夺回这座城市

486
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:20,976
我的眼镜

487
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,384
眼镜呢

488
00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:15,161
他表现糟透了

489
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:17,534
爱偷懒

490
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:18,866
所以我告诉弗雷德里克森

491
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:20,472
我要解雇他

492
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:22,803
就该那么做 亲爱的

493
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:24,908
他攻击了我

494
00:46:25,879 --> 00:46:27,107
不知道他去了哪里

495
00:46:28,215 --> 00:46:29,880
来 施列伯医生

496
00:46:31,118 --> 00:46:32,710
我们有好多事得做

497
00:46:32,753 --> 00:46:34,316
好吗？

498
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:35,949
好的

499
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:57,486
<i>他们都说你负心薄幸</i>

500
00:46:58,413 --> 00:47:02,123
<i>虽然你说</i>

501
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:06,166
<i>那不是真的</i>

502
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:15,934
<i>你若真要为别人离我而去</i>

503
00:47:18,132 --> 00:47:19,925
<i>我会知晓</i>

504
00:47:19,997 --> 00:47:24,694
<i>相信我 我会知晓</i>

505
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:29,557
<i>因为夜幕上</i>

506
00:47:30,137 --> 00:47:34,853
<i>有千双眼睛闪烁</i>

507
00:47:35,281 --> 00:47:38,772
<i>这些眼睛</i>

508
00:47:39,211 --> 00:47:43,043

今晚的实验

515
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:30,967
将会在如下地点进行

516
00:48:31,004 --> 00:48:35,407
第一名注射对象在M大道

517
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:37,967
书先生 出了点差错

518
00:48:38,011 --> 00:48:41,344
没有M大道 我们无法完成它

519
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:45,112
上次调谐中 我们失去了对那的控制

520
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:47,814
机器受到了破坏？

521
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:52,587
默多克这个人比我们想象的更强大

522
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:54,389
他快能和我们匹敌了

523
00:48:54,428 --> 00:48:58,990
那我们就得变得比他更强

524
00:48:59,032 --> 00:49:01,466
医生是否照我们的要求完成了？

525
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:04,766
约翰.默多克的生平 第二集

526
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,472
我们不能这么做

527
00:49:09,509 --> 00:49:13,036
默多克并没有这些记忆 是吧？

528
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,742
那这些记忆又怎能帮我们找到他

529
00:49:15,782 --> 00:49:18,114
他所到之处

530
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:20,779
所见之人都能尽在掌握

531
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:22,815
既然他循着线索找

532
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:25,819
那我们就照着记忆来

533
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,521
难道忘了上次注射的后果了吗 当我们…

534
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:31,690
是的 可怜的 可怜的…

535
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:33,596
我们没有忘记

536
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:38,873
既然手先生愿意

537
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:40,906
为了更大的事业做出牺牲

538
00:49:41,508 --> 00:49:42,975
那就这么做吧

539
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:48,208
但是过去给我们自己灌输记忆都失败了

540
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:51,775
手先生的提议是唯一的办法

541
00:49:51,818 --> 00:49:53,251
开始注射

542
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:00,688
可能会有点痛

543
00:50:37,531 --> 00:50:39,431
好了吗？

544
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,692
是的 书先生

545
00:50:43,637 --> 00:50:47,164
我脑中已经有约翰.默多克的记忆了

546
00:50:51,945 --> 00:50:53,139
约翰…

547
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,338
我在你妈妈的遗物中找到了这张明信片

548
00:50:57,384 --> 00:50:59,511
重拾记忆 不是吗？

549
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:01,418
有空来坐坐

550
00:51:01,454 --> 00:51:03,251
看看这次能不能钓到

551
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,621
又一条美人鱼

552
00:51:04,658 --> 00:51:06,626

我们进了死胡同 是的 墙先生

00:52:58,338 --> 00:52:59,338
我们本想凭他的记忆

572
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:00,932
能带我们找到他 是的…

573

但我们却被带到了这里

574

这不合理

直觉本就是不合理的 墙先生…

576
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,616
我们要服从直觉的指引 是的

577
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:14,283
眠先生建议去他熟悉的地方找

578
00:53:14,284 --> 00:53:15,444
比如工作地

579
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:17,547
他才不在乎我们给的工作

580
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,423
告诉我们 手先生

581
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,087
如果你是默多克

00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:23,117
是的

584
00:53:25,131 --> 00:53:26,689
我是默多克

585
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:30,235

586
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,831

然后…

00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:42,103
我会设法报复她

589
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:48,151

因为那是直达车

你是谁？　　曾是一名警察

606

至少 在现在这个人生中是

607
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:38,562
你知道吗？他们偷取人们的记忆

608
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:40,936
然后在我们中调换记忆

609

现在 谁都不知道自己是谁

00:54:45,845 --> 00:54:47,107
你怎么会知道这些？

612
00:54:47,147 --> 00:54:49,017
我们中偶尔会有人醒来

613
00:54:49,017 --> 00:54:51,130
在他们换记忆的时候

614
00:54:51,518 --> 00:54:53,748
本不该发生 但就是发生了

615
00:54:53,787 --> 00:54:55,512
那人碰巧是我

616
00:54:55,855 --> 00:54:57,755
他们会来找你的 默多克

617
00:54:58,892 --> 00:55:00,519
就像找我一样

618
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:02,658
但没关系

619
00:55:02,695 --> 00:55:04,162
我找到出路了

620
00:55:15,575 --> 00:55:16,906

00:55:18,778 --> 00:55:20,075
昨晚

622
00:55:20,113 --> 00:55:22,411
这里曾是他的家

623
00:55:25,151 --> 00:55:27,016
当时我们多么爱她

624
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:29,518
干得好 手先生

625
00:55:29,518 --> 00:55:31,367
但我们需要更直接的

626
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:33,448
能找到他的所在的线索

627
00:55:36,129 --> 00:55:37,357
是的

628
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:40,663
我知道上哪找到她

629
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:51,643
你能想到要到这儿来 是你我的幸运

630
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:52,767
对不起 你在说什么？

631
00:55:52,812 --> 00:55:55,177
能够故地重游

632
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:57,077
对我们都意味良多

633
00:55:57,884 --> 00:56:00,107
这是我和他挥之不去的记忆

634
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:01,910
也许吧

635
00:56:03,623 --> 00:56:05,550
想象下 有这么一种生活

636
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:07,920
外星人入侵

637
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:10,156
你们的记忆不再属于自己

638
00:56:10,196 --> 00:56:13,357
而在同类中分享

639
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:17,821
这样该有多么苦恼

640
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:21,306
没法拥有自己的记忆

641
00:56:23,943 --> 00:56:26,173
如果往事不堪回首

642
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:27,941
那么忘掉又何妨

643
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:31,311
但假如你体验到些不同的东西

644
00:56:32,552 --> 00:56:35,118
更美好的 一些东西

645
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:41,653
在我小时候 这里有艘渡轮

646
00:56:41,694 --> 00:56:43,457
好大的渡轮

647
00:56:43,496 --> 00:56:46,624
亮起灯来像块生日蛋糕

648
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:50,131
我丈夫曾跟我那么说过

649
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:52,000
就在这里

650
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:55,204
你丈夫现在在哪里？

651
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:58,733
我也想知道 你为什么来这里？

652
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:02,447
我在这里遇见我妻子

653
00:57:02,482 --> 00:57:04,279
我在这里和我丈夫初次相遇

654
00:57:04,317 --> 00:57:06,547

00:57:29,542 --> 00:57:30,736
不 不 不

656
00:58:00,473 --> 00:58:01,706
有人吗？

657
00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:03,769
有人吗？

658
00:58:48,988 --> 00:58:50,319
你在这做什么？

659
00:58:50,356 --> 00:58:52,256
我一直都跟着你

660
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:57,960
不许动！

661
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:01,432
约翰？

662
00:59:01,868 --> 00:59:03,031
约翰！

663
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,932
好久不见了

664
00:59:04,971 --> 00:59:07,804
我还以为你忘了卡尔叔叔了

665
00:59:08,574 --> 00:59:10,371
你这小坏蛋！

666
00:59:13,446 --> 00:59:14,913
卡尔叔叔？

667
00:59:18,418 --> 00:59:19,544
等一下

668
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:23,212
那是我吗？

669
00:59:23,256 --> 00:59:24,450
是啊

670
00:59:33,499 --> 00:59:35,524
我在贝壳海滩长大？

671
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:36,728
我说过了

672
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:39,135
贝壳海滩 你的家乡

673
00:59:39,172 --> 00:59:41,998
我要到那去 卡尔 要怎么过去？

674
00:59:42,408 --> 00:59:44,035
我不知道

675
00:59:44,077 --> 00:59:45,837
我有好些年没待那了

676
00:59:45,837 --> 00:59:47,137

677
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,205
一定会有点印象

678

00:59:50,817 --> 00:59:52,045
约翰 对不起

680
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:56,420
老了 脑筋不中用了

681
00:59:59,992 --> 01:00:01,619
那里好亮

682
01:00:01,661 --> 01:00:03,725
光明的时代吧 我想

683
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:08,031
你老爱在本子上乱涂乱画

684
01:00:08,568 --> 01:00:11,196
那是我和你爸爸

685
01:00:11,237 --> 01:00:13,398
多帅的两傻瓜

686
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:15,734
我父母怎么了

687
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,874
他们现在在哪里？

688
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:24,840
他们去世了 约翰

689
01:00:24,884 --> 01:00:27,318
房子起火 他们被烧死了

690
01:00:27,353 --> 01:00:29,014
我把你养大

691
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:31,923
你真的都不记得了？

692
01:00:35,228 --> 01:00:36,593
那是什么？

693
01:00:37,597 --> 01:00:39,030
那是什么？

694
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:45,131
那是伤疤

695
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:48,065
火灾中你的手臂烧伤很严重

696
01:00:53,613 --> 01:00:55,112
这是什么意思？

697
01:00:55,112 --> 01:00:56,912
意思是 这些都是谎言！

698
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,788
你为什么来这 默多克夫人？

699
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:14,199
我丈夫告诉我他曾来过这

700
01:01:18,237 --> 01:01:20,501
他告诉我他想考验自己

701
01:01:21,707 --> 01:01:23,573
想知道

702
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,078
他是否…

703
01:01:35,288 --> 01:01:36,918
我想来和她谈谈

704
01:01:36,918 --> 01:01:39,088
我想也许她能帮我找到他

705
01:01:40,793 --> 01:01:42,727
呆在这 我打电话通知警局

706
01:01:54,073 --> 01:01:55,404
是的 我是巴姆斯泰德

707
01:01:55,404 --> 01:01:59,207
请让验尸官到1440号…东边 对

708
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:01,319
又死了一个

709
01:02:02,348 --> 01:02:04,945
一样的手法 你来了再跟你细说

710
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:16,956
噢 天啊

711
01:02:17,597 --> 01:02:19,792
没事的 我不会伤害你

712
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:21,523
没事的

713
01:02:31,844 --> 01:02:33,812
她从哪冒出来的？

714
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:35,336
我看到她藏在里面

715
01:02:36,082 --> 01:02:37,913
她都看到了

716
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:08,037
你要回家吗 默多克夫人

717
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,742
探长要送我回去 谢谢你

718
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:36,903
它真漂亮

719
01:03:39,478 --> 01:03:42,277
是我妈妈送给我的

720
01:03:42,615 --> 01:03:45,040
她刚去世

721
01:03:45,384 --> 01:03:47,682
我随身带着它来纪念她

722
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:50,987
抱歉

723
01:03:54,427 --> 01:03:56,438
奇怪的是

724
01:03:56,629 --> 01:03:58,995
我记不清她什么时候送给我了

725
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:04,559
这种事情我怎么会忘记？

726
01:04:06,739 --> 01:04:10,903
你有常常回想过去吗 默多克夫人？

727
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,543
到底发生了什么 探长？

728
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:18,577
我也不知道

729
01:04:22,121 --> 01:04:24,346
你的房间我原封不动

730
01:04:24,724 --> 01:04:26,817
你今晚在这睡吧 好不？

731
01:04:26,892 --> 01:04:29,190
真高兴看到你回来 约翰…

732
01:04:29,228 --> 01:04:30,923
就算你只回来一晚

733
01:04:30,963 --> 01:04:31,952
卡尔

734
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:34,327
那钟准吗？

735
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:35,699
当然了 怎么会不准

736
01:04:35,999 --> 01:04:38,269
买来后一向很准

737
01:04:38,304 --> 01:04:40,101
上午还是下午？

738
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,707
你在想什么 约翰？

739
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:44,733
我不明白 为什么现在就是晚上了？

740
01:04:44,777 --> 01:04:46,472
白天发生了什么 我怎么会不记得？

741
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:49,379
你太累了 什么都有可能

742
01:04:49,415 --> 01:04:50,814
这样吧…

743
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,411
你先去睡会 明天起床再来搞清楚

744
01:05:20,279 --> 01:05:23,180
贝壳海滩指南 约翰.默多克著

745
01:05:26,152 --> 01:05:27,983
噢 怎么什么都没有

746
01:05:46,539 --> 01:05:48,973
喂？　　艾玛 他在我这

747
01:05:49,008 --> 01:05:51,135
他的举止很怪异

748
01:05:51,177 --> 01:05:53,236
我知道 他已经不是他了

749
01:05:53,279 --> 01:05:55,213
设法留住他 我马上过去

750
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:57,579
我试试　　　谢谢你 卡尔 再见

751
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:01,211
约翰

752
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:03,118
我没法给出承诺 默多克夫人

753
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:04,713
得看情况

754
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:08,249
约翰 我们只是想帮你

755
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:17,035
卡尔

756
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:18,468
卡尔叔叔

757
01:06:18,504 --> 01:06:20,678
约翰 如果你有麻烦

758
01:06:20,678 --> 01:06:22,201
我们能一起帮你

759
01:06:23,676 --> 01:06:26,144
好久不见你了

760
01:06:26,512 --> 01:06:28,070
是的

761
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:46,123
默多克先生 你惹了不少麻烦

762
01:07:50,162 --> 01:07:52,596
从实招来　　　没必要这么做

763
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:53,996
你无路可逃

764
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:56,024
城市是我们的 我们创造了它

765
01:07:56,068 --> 01:07:57,558
你在说什么？

766
01:07:57,603 --> 01:08:00,800
我们用偷来的记忆创造了这座城市…

767
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:04,673
不同的年代 不同的过去融为一体

768
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,201
每晚对它进行修改和完善

769
01:08:07,246 --> 01:08:08,736
为了学习

770
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:10,180
学习什么？

771
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:11,683
你 默多克先生

772
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:13,981
你和你的同类

773
01:08:14,019 --> 01:08:15,816
学习什么使人之为人

774
01:08:16,355 --> 01:08:19,381
为什么？　　我们得像你们一样

775
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:22,725
我现在很了解你 默多克先生

776
01:08:22,761 --> 01:08:24,922
我记得你已经忘却的…

777
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:26,322
你已经忘却的往事

778
01:08:26,365 --> 01:08:28,026
海洋 是的…

779
01:08:29,068 --> 01:08:31,696
小时候在海边的玩耍

780
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:34,118
与艾玛在河边的相遇

781
01:08:34,118 --> 01:08:36,706
还有难忘的初吻

782
01:08:37,276 --> 01:08:38,436
你到底是什么

783
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:40,240
你已经知道我们是什么了

784
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:43,214
死人是我们的容器

785
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:53,900
上车！

786
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:11,886
那她呢 有印象吗？

787
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:13,261
我离开时她还活着

788
01:11:13,298 --> 01:11:14,390
那这个呢？

789
01:11:14,433 --> 01:11:16,458
这什么都不是 这个…

790
01:11:16,502 --> 01:11:18,800
肯定意味着什么 这些图画

791
01:11:18,837 --> 01:11:19,997
什么图画？

792
01:11:21,006 --> 01:11:22,030
我不明白这是怎么回事

793
01:11:22,074 --> 01:11:24,907
别装了 默多克先生 别向我撒谎！

794
01:11:24,943 --> 01:11:26,433
我没有撒谎！

795
01:11:26,478 --> 01:11:28,878
告诉我为什么 让我搞明白

796
01:11:28,914 --> 01:11:31,007
我试着破解这拼图迷题

797
01:11:31,049 --> 01:11:32,941
每次我拼凑起来

798
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:34,041
图画都没有意义

799
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,451
你以为我明白？

800
01:11:35,487 --> 01:11:37,546
我和你一样莫名其妙

801
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:39,750
让我问你个问题？

802
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:42,458
你听过贝壳海滩这个地方吗？

803
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:44,785
当然　　　你知道怎么到那里吗？

804
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,263
知道　　　那你告诉我

805
01:11:46,298 --> 01:11:50,428
好 你只要…到…

806
01:11:51,336 --> 01:11:52,394
哪儿 该到哪儿？

807
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:54,531
再让我想想 好吗？

808
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,369
你记不起来是不是？

809
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:02,112
你不觉得很奇怪吗？

810
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:05,138
等下

811
01:12:05,184 --> 01:12:06,583
我再问你个容易点的问题

812
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:07,915
你还记不记得

813
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:10,820
上一个白天做了什么？

814
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:11,948
什么意思？

815
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:14,254
我的意思是…在白天的时候

816
01:12:15,194 --> 01:12:16,320
白昼

817
01:12:16,361 --> 01:12:17,919
你最后一次见到白天是什么时候？

818
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:19,215
我不是指

819
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:21,767
遥远的 模糊的童年回忆

820
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:24,615
而是昨天？上周？什么时候见到白天？

821
01:12:25,337 --> 01:12:27,337
能记起分毫吗？

822
01:12:28,874 --> 01:12:30,136
记不起来 对不对？

823
01:12:30,175 --> 01:12:33,440
你知道吗？我认为太阳

824
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:36,175
在这里甚至都不存在

825
01:12:36,215 --> 01:12:38,949
因为我醒了很久

826
01:12:38,949 --> 01:12:40,630
夜晚从没结束过

827
01:12:41,253 --> 01:12:43,881
这很荒唐　　　你说对了 就是很荒唐

828
01:12:43,922 --> 01:12:46,288
听我说 巴姆斯泰德 不只是我

829
01:12:46,825 --> 01:12:48,350
我们所有人

830
01:12:48,393 --> 01:12:49,951
我们都被他们控制了

831
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:52,759
闭嘴 我听够了　　　请听我说

832
01:12:52,798 --> 01:12:54,527
你闭嘴 闭嘴！　　听我说

833
01:13:04,776 --> 01:13:08,041
一定能找到答案

834
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:17,519
你解释下这现象

835
01:13:38,143 --> 01:13:40,338
约翰 对不起

836
01:13:41,313 --> 01:13:43,144
我不想伤害你 约翰

837
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:44,307
但我那么做了 我不知道为什么会那样

838
01:13:44,349 --> 01:13:46,510
我想重新来过

839
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:49,077
不 艾玛 你没有出轨

840
01:13:49,121 --> 01:13:51,885
你的外遇 不管那是什么

841
01:13:51,924 --> 01:13:53,551
你认为你做过的事情

842
01:13:53,592 --> 01:13:55,457
其实并没有做 我认为它压根就没发生

843
01:13:55,494 --> 01:13:56,893
这是什么意思？

844
01:13:56,929 --> 01:13:59,295
听起来很荒唐

845
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:02,232
但我们也许素不相识

846
01:14:02,267 --> 01:14:04,701
我们第一次见面

847
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:08,570
应该是昨晚在你的…在我们的公寓里

848
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:11,152
你所记得的

849
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:13,310
还有我本该记得的

850
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:14,610
从来没发生过？

851
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:17,040
有人想让我们认为它发生过

852
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:24,586
回到公寓…

853
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,824
我忽然觉得我根本不认识你

854
01:14:29,628 --> 01:14:32,119
你似乎就是个陌生人

855
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:36,128
但那怎么会如此真实？

856
01:14:36,735 --> 01:14:39,665
我仍然记得你我的相遇

857
01:14:40,906 --> 01:14:43,572
我仍然记得与你相爱

858
01:14:44,776 --> 01:14:46,573
我仍然记得我是怎样失去你

859
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:47,969
时间到

860
01:14:49,314 --> 01:14:50,804
不 等等

861
01:14:50,849 --> 01:14:52,976
请等等 就…

862
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:54,110
就一会

863
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:02,753
我爱你 约翰

864
01:15:05,597 --> 01:15:08,293
那是无法作假的

865
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:10,598
没错

866
01:15:40,132 --> 01:15:42,692
探长？长官？

867
01:15:44,102 --> 01:15:46,862
瓦伦斯基探长昨晚自杀了

868
01:15:46,905 --> 01:15:50,671
我…觉得你该知道下

869
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:56,173
噢 还有 局长要见你

870
01:15:56,948 --> 01:15:58,108
长官…

871
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:06,180
我知道你会抓到凶手的 长官

872
01:16:18,904 --> 01:16:19,893
长官…

873
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,864
鞋带

874
01:16:36,121 --> 01:16:37,281
有什么要帮忙的吗 先生？

875
01:16:37,322 --> 01:16:39,688
那你就睡吧

876
01:16:41,827 --> 01:16:42,816
先生…

877
01:16:42,861 --> 01:16:44,419
睡吧 睡吧

878
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:49,328
晚上好 长官

879
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,268
巴姆斯泰德

880
01:17:02,114 --> 01:17:04,409
我要首先祝贺你…

881
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:06,110
关于这起案子

882
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:11,218
带我们去见默多克

883
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:12,348
睡吧

884
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:41,350
施列伯医生

885
01:17:42,521 --> 01:17:44,284
我知道你一定会来的

886
01:17:44,322 --> 01:17:45,394
现在能告诉我

887
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,018
是怎么回事吗？

888
01:17:47,058 --> 01:17:49,253
好的 当然

889
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:51,023
不坐下来谈？

890
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:56,157
我常常来这里

891
01:17:56,201 --> 01:17:58,669
这里是少有的能让我有片刻宁静的地方

892
01:17:58,703 --> 01:18:02,070
他们很讨厌水

893
01:18:03,241 --> 01:18:05,175
甚至可以说恐惧

894
01:18:05,744 --> 01:18:09,009
他们是谁 他们想从我身上得到什么？

895
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:10,130
好的

896
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:12,708
现在 让我先说

897
01:18:12,751 --> 01:18:15,447
你是他们的试验品

898
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:16,852
我们都是

899
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:20,791
你没疯 约翰

900
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:23,589
你也不是杀人犯

901
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:27,293
我很抱歉 真的

902
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:28,856
但我们时间不多

903
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,528
我只能这么做

904
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,094
你想知道的一切

905
01:18:33,138 --> 01:18:35,470
答案都在这支注射器里

906
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:36,701
我想你得注射它

907
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:39,341
这是你明白一切的唯一办法

908
01:18:39,377 --> 01:18:40,474
你在开玩笑吗？

909
01:18:40,512 --> 01:18:43,481
我们时间不多了 你得马上注射

910
01:18:44,382 --> 01:18:45,549
把枪给我 医生

911
01:18:45,584 --> 01:18:48,018
探长 他很困扰

912
01:18:48,053 --> 01:18:50,783
我不像你会分析个性

913
01:18:50,822 --> 01:18:53,791
医生 不过在我看来你是疯子

914
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:56,490
你不知道你在做什么

915
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:01,791
这个 到底是什么…医生？

916
01:19:03,034 --> 01:19:05,229
你寻找的答案 约翰

917
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,362
我发誓

918
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:10,919
这样的话 那我就先收好…

919
01:19:10,919 --> 01:19:12,372
替你保管了

920
01:19:13,011 --> 01:19:14,205
如果你不介意的话

921
01:19:14,246 --> 01:19:15,611
我们走吧 医生

922
01:19:16,948 --> 01:19:22,318
走？去哪里？　　贝壳海滩

923
01:19:23,355 --> 01:19:25,521
你要去那里 不是吗？

924
01:19:25,757 --> 01:19:27,349
海洋

925
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:37,891
你为什么要帮我？

926
01:19:39,334 --> 01:19:41,331
你想得到什么

927
01:19:41,373 --> 01:19:42,631
真相

928
01:19:43,608 --> 01:19:46,577
没有地图标出往海边走的路

929
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:48,010
在那你们什么都找不到的…

930
01:19:48,046 --> 01:19:49,980
我跟你们说 我到过那 而且…

931
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,540
如果你到过那里 你带路 好吗？

932
01:19:53,685 --> 01:19:55,243
我们自己找

933
01:19:56,621 --> 01:19:57,545
我不会带路的

934
01:19:58,523 --> 01:20:01,253
我拒绝 你们别逼我去那里！

935
01:20:14,005 --> 01:20:15,666
你在说话吗 医生？

936
01:20:27,419 --> 01:20:30,946
我不明白 这里本来有座桥

937
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:39,288
有种再试一次

938
01:20:39,331 --> 01:20:40,662
就把你丢到河里去

939
01:20:40,699 --> 01:20:42,098
别伤害我 我告诉你一切

940
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:44,158
反正都已经无所谓了

941
01:20:51,109 --> 01:20:52,269
什么？

942
01:20:55,013 --> 01:20:57,311
你们到底是谁？

943
01:21:01,486 --> 01:21:05,980
安娜 我们很快就会给你好东西

944
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:07,652
我不是安娜

945
01:21:09,527 --> 01:21:11,427
你很快就会是 是的

946
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,367
她还有其他用途

947
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:30,309
首先是黑暗 然后来了陌生种族

948
01:21:32,484 --> 01:21:34,782
他们把我们绑走 带到这里

949
01:21:36,054 --> 01:21:38,818
这座城市 还有里面的所有人

950
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:40,222
都是他们的试验品

951
01:21:40,258 --> 01:21:43,159
他们随意混合和搭配我们的记忆

952
01:21:43,194 --> 01:21:45,958
试图想要破解我们人类的秘密

953
01:21:46,664 --> 01:21:49,428
第一天 一个人可能是个探长

954
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:52,368
第二天就会是完全不同的人

955
01:21:52,404 --> 01:21:55,703
如果他们想研究杀人凶手

956
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:58,124
他们只要给其中一人

957
01:21:58,124 --> 01:22:00,004
注射一个新的人性就行了

958
01:22:00,678 --> 01:22:04,705
为他安排家庭 朋友 和过去

959
01:22:05,517 --> 01:22:06,541
甚至还有丢失的钱包

960
01:22:07,152 --> 01:22:08,813
然后他们观察结果

961
01:22:10,255 --> 01:22:12,381
如果一个人 被赋予了杀手的记忆

962
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:14,381
是否会继续杀人？

963
01:22:14,492 --> 01:22:18,385
或者说 我们仅仅是记忆的总和？

964
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:20,830
你成为一名杀手

965
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:23,395
是不幸的巧合

966
01:22:23,668 --> 01:22:26,335
在这之前你已有了数十次人生

967
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:27,466
你碰巧醒来

968
01:22:27,466 --> 01:22:29,704
在我为你注射这次人生的时候

969
01:22:30,475 --> 01:22:32,602
他们为什么要这么做？

970
01:22:32,644 --> 01:22:35,855
我们的个性

971
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:38,541
我们的灵魂使我们有别于他们

972
01:22:38,683 --> 01:22:41,049
他们想透过研究记忆

973
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:44,114
来帮助他们找寻人类的灵魂

974
01:22:44,255 --> 01:22:45,517
他们只有团体记忆

975
01:22:45,557 --> 01:22:48,390
和团体思想

976
01:22:48,426 --> 01:22:49,893
他们快灭亡了

977
01:22:49,928 --> 01:22:53,130
整个种族濒临灭绝

978
01:22:53,398 --> 01:22:55,263
他们认为我们能够拯救他们

979
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,734
我是什么角色？　　你与众不同 约翰

980
01:22:58,369 --> 01:23:01,202
你阻止了我的注射

981
01:23:05,844 --> 01:23:09,245
你还有了调谐的能力

982
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,577
那是他们改变物体的能力

983
01:23:10,615 --> 01:23:12,339
他们用这能力建造了这座城市

984
01:23:12,383 --> 01:23:15,084
他们有一部深埋在地下的机器

985
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,056
能够集中他们的精神力

986
01:23:19,924 --> 01:23:22,415
他们控制这里的一切 甚至太阳

987
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:25,793
他们不喜欢光亮 所以这里只有夜晚

988
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:27,092
那他们要你作什么？

989
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:28,845
他们刚把我们带到这里时

990
01:23:28,845 --> 01:23:31,535
需要从我们中提取记忆

991
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:33,403
来储存信息

992
01:23:33,403 --> 01:23:35,403
像涂料般混在一起

993
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,965
然后给我们注入他们选的记忆

994
01:23:38,009 --> 01:23:41,638
但他们需要专家帮忙

995
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:46,644
我比他们更了解

996
01:23:46,684 --> 01:23:49,209
人类错综复杂的思想

997
01:23:49,254 --> 01:23:51,984
所以他们还让我做科学家

998
01:23:52,023 --> 01:23:53,456
因为他们需要我的技术

999
01:23:53,491 --> 01:23:55,959
不过他们让我抹去其他东西

1000
01:24:04,335 --> 01:24:07,168
你知道被迫抹去

1001
01:24:07,205 --> 01:24:08,934
自己的过去是什么滋味吗？

1002
01:24:08,973 --> 01:24:12,306
那我的过去和我的童年呢？

1003
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:15,357
贝壳海滩 卡尔叔叔

1004
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:17,978
这个呢？

1005
01:24:18,883 --> 01:24:20,783
我找到时是空白的

1006
01:24:20,818 --> 01:24:22,843
你还是不明白 约翰

1007
01:24:22,887 --> 01:24:26,084
你在这里…从来就没有童年

1008
01:24:26,124 --> 01:24:28,922
你的过去都是幻觉  是虚构的

1009
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,825
我们大家都一样

1010
01:24:30,862 --> 01:24:33,353
这些画只是你信手涂鸦的而已

1011
01:24:33,398 --> 01:24:35,263
你说他们把我们带到这来

1012
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:38,228
从哪带过来

1013
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,064
对不起

1014
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,672
我记不起来

1015
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:47,739
我们中没人记得

1016
01:24:48,446 --> 01:24:50,038
我们曾经是谁…

1017
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:51,815
我们住在哪里…

1018
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:53,915
在某处吧

1019
01:25:11,402 --> 01:25:13,370
我只能把你们带到这来

1020
01:25:13,404 --> 01:25:15,531
你们用不着我了

1021
01:25:15,573 --> 01:25:17,370
我们走吧

1022
01:25:35,593 --> 01:25:37,390
约翰

1023
01:26:01,486 --> 01:26:04,284
没有海洋 约翰

1024
01:26:05,322 --> 01:26:07,852
城外什么都没有

1025
01:26:09,293 --> 01:26:11,826
家这个地方

1026
01:26:13,665 --> 01:26:15,656
只存在于脑海中

1027
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:25,738
不！ 不！

1028
01:26:25,777 --> 01:26:27,608
约翰 住手！

1029
01:26:30,181 --> 01:26:31,307
不！

1030
01:26:34,018 --> 01:26:35,315
住手！

1031
01:26:40,992 --> 01:26:42,186
求你们了

1032
01:26:43,027 --> 01:26:44,221
不！

1033
01:27:02,714 --> 01:27:04,875
现在你们知道真相了

1034
01:27:24,235 --> 01:27:25,497
不！

1035
01:28:13,518 --> 01:28:16,419
你最好投降 默多克先生

1036
01:28:16,454 --> 01:28:18,684
要不然我就杀了她 知道不？

1037
01:28:18,723 --> 01:28:21,248
我管不着 她又不是我真正的妻子

1038
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:22,418
对我而言 她什么都不是

1039
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:26,692
但你仍然在意 对不对 默多克先生？

1040
01:28:26,731 --> 01:28:29,393
你瞧 你做不成杀人狂

1041
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:31,425
那我来替你做

1042
01:28:33,237 --> 01:28:37,139
要我替你杀了她吗？

1043
01:28:40,178 --> 01:28:42,408
请别伤害她！

1044
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:46,177
那就投降吧 默多克先生

1045
01:28:47,518 --> 01:28:48,745
睡吧

1046
01:28:50,888 --> 01:28:52,783
现在睡吧

1047
01:28:54,659 --> 01:28:55,686
约翰？

1048
01:29:11,309 --> 01:29:12,469
睡吧

1049
01:29:34,365 --> 01:29:37,198
医生说得对 他进化了

1050
01:29:37,568 --> 01:29:39,092
杀了他

1051
01:29:39,136 --> 01:29:40,997
杀了他！ 杀了他！

1052
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:47,639
杀了他！ 杀了他！

1053
01:29:50,314 --> 01:29:52,839
他很强大 是的

1054
01:29:52,884 --> 01:29:57,344
而且危险 不过他能带我们找到

1055
01:29:57,388 --> 01:30:00,789
医生所说的灵魂

1056
01:30:00,825 --> 01:30:04,522
现在我们的试验即将进入最终阶段

1057
01:30:04,562 --> 01:30:07,292
我们不再需要其他的实验品

1058
01:30:07,331 --> 01:30:10,960
研究结束了

1059
01:30:11,002 --> 01:30:15,200
现在该和约翰.默多克合为一体了

1060
01:30:21,879 --> 01:30:23,710
是时候了 医生

1061
01:30:23,748 --> 01:30:25,306
注射

1062
01:30:28,085 --> 01:30:30,849
关闭！

1063
01:30:30,888 --> 01:30:34,051
永远关闭！

1064
01:30:48,189 --> 01:30:49,703
你在做什么

1065
01:30:50,241 --> 01:30:54,769
他们想把团体记忆注射入你体内

1066
01:30:56,113 --> 01:30:58,051
他们想让你成为他们的一员

1067
01:30:58,051 --> 01:31:00,779
这样就能共享你的灵魂

1068
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:08,722
注射 医生 不许违抗命令

1069
01:31:08,959 --> 01:31:10,590
对不起 约翰

1070
01:31:11,028 --> 01:31:13,620
只会痛一会

1071
01:31:15,766 --> 01:31:16,733
不！

1072
01:31:25,142 --> 01:31:26,439
记起来 约翰

1073
01:31:27,712 --> 01:31:29,680
你会很有出息的 我的孩子

1074
01:31:29,714 --> 01:31:31,477
等你长大了 你就明白了

1075
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,615
记起来

1076
01:31:35,686 --> 01:31:38,553
就是这样 约翰 熟能生巧

1077
01:31:38,589 --> 01:31:41,786
记住我跟你说的 别和陌生人说话

1078
01:31:41,826 --> 01:31:43,423
记起来 约翰

1079
01:31:43,661 --> 01:31:44,528
你可能在奇怪

1080
01:31:44,628 --> 01:31:46,528
为什么我一直出现在你的记忆里

1081
01:31:46,564 --> 01:31:49,089
因为我将自己加入你的记忆中

1082
01:31:49,133 --> 01:31:51,226
这些记忆都是炮制来

1083
01:31:51,268 --> 01:31:52,963
来告诉你异族人的一切

1084
01:31:53,004 --> 01:31:56,132
一针 就给你毕生的知识

1085
01:31:58,976 --> 01:32:01,342
你会活下来的 约翰

1086
01:32:01,379 --> 01:32:03,677
你会发掘到你潜在的力量

1087
01:32:03,714 --> 01:32:05,682
来战胜他们

1088
01:32:05,716 --> 01:32:07,081
记住

1089
01:32:07,852 --> 01:32:08,841
你好 卡尔叔叔

1090
01:32:08,886 --> 01:32:09,875
约翰！

1091
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:14,983
你找到窍门了 约翰

1092
01:32:15,026 --> 01:32:17,085
也许有一天我会为你工作

1093
01:32:17,895 --> 01:32:20,136
这是异族人用的机器

1094
01:32:20,136 --> 01:32:21,359
来增强他们的精神力

1095
01:32:21,365 --> 01:32:23,230
那些机器改变了他们的世界

1096
01:32:23,267 --> 01:32:24,625
你必须控制它

1097
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:26,756
你必须将它占为己有

1098
01:32:26,756 --> 01:32:28,464
我知道你能打败他们 约翰

1099
01:32:28,506 --> 01:32:30,997
但你要集中精神

1100
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:34,302
有点不对头

1101
01:32:42,953 --> 01:32:45,683
现在不是谈情说爱的时候 约翰

1102
01:32:45,723 --> 01:32:47,655
现在世界在你手中

1103
01:32:48,117 --> 01:32:49,517
你做了什么？

1104
01:32:50,161 --> 01:32:52,686
你现在有创造一切的力量

1105
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:54,220
但你必须马上行动

1106
01:37:39,116 --> 01:37:40,583
我知道你做得到 约翰

1107
01:37:40,617 --> 01:37:42,642
你已经有了他们的力量

1108
01:37:42,686 --> 01:37:44,551
你控制了他们的机器

1109
01:37:44,588 --> 01:37:45,987
艾玛在哪里？

1110
01:37:46,724 --> 01:37:49,557
她不再是艾玛了 约翰

1111
01:37:49,593 --> 01:37:50,992
她被重新注射了

1112
01:37:51,028 --> 01:37:52,723
那么找回她的记忆

1113
01:37:52,763 --> 01:37:55,197
我办不到 异族人

1114
01:37:55,232 --> 01:37:58,130
储藏记忆的机器已经被摧毁了

1115
01:37:58,268 --> 01:37:59,429
对不起

1116
01:38:00,471 --> 01:38:03,167
你现在有什么打算 约翰？

1117
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:08,709
你说我有那力量 对不对？

1118
01:38:09,113 --> 01:38:12,104
我能操纵这些机器 做我想做的

1119
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:15,582
任意创造这世上的一切

1120
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:20,746
只要我足够集中注意力

1121
01:39:44,508 --> 01:39:45,907
你要去哪里？

1122
01:39:48,846 --> 01:39:50,313
贝壳海滩

1123
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,349
[安娜]

1124
01:40:26,157 --> 01:40:28,062
[贝壳海滩]

1125
01:40:31,188 --> 01:40:32,587
多少钱？　　二毛五

1126
01:40:38,829 --> 01:40:39,818
你坐吧

1127
01:40:39,863 --> 01:40:42,388
噢 不…　　　没关系

1128
01:40:42,432 --> 01:40:43,831
谢谢你　　　没关系

1129
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:25,706
约翰…

1130
01:41:29,479 --> 01:41:31,606
我一直在等你

1131
01:41:32,349 --> 01:41:33,509
你做了什么？

1132
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:36,917
我只是做了些变动

1133
01:41:36,954 --> 01:41:38,649
那是我们要的吗？

1134
01:41:39,156 --> 01:41:41,590
我愿意冒这个险

1135
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,183
我快死了 约翰

1136
01:41:43,227 --> 01:41:46,128
你的记忆不允许我们的存在

1137
01:41:47,631 --> 01:41:49,895
但我想知道那是什么…

1138
01:41:51,268 --> 01:41:52,735
你的感觉

1139
01:41:52,769 --> 01:41:55,465
你知道我以前是什么感觉

1140
01:41:55,505 --> 01:41:59,305
那人不是我 从来就不是

1141
01:41:59,343 --> 01:42:03,074
你们想知道是什么使人之为人

1142
01:42:04,448 --> 01:42:07,781
你们在这就能找到答案

1143
01:42:09,553 --> 01:42:12,147
你们以前找错地方了

1144
01:43:50,554 --> 01:43:52,354
这里好美

1145
01:43:57,794 --> 01:43:59,261
好亮

1146
01:44:05,168 --> 01:44:08,001
贝壳海滩是不是在附近？

1147
01:44:08,038 --> 01:44:10,666
我想它在那边

1148
01:44:28,825 --> 01:44:30,884
我要到那去

1149
01:44:32,829 --> 01:44:34,854
要不要一起过去？

1150
01:44:37,033 --> 01:44:38,022
当然

1151
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:45,572
对了 我叫安娜

1152
01:44:46,109 --> 01:44:48,373
你叫什么名字？　　约翰

1153
01:44:50,781 --> 01:44:52,248
约翰.默多克

1
00:04:20,823 --> 00:04:23,656
You are confused, aren't you? Frightened.

2
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:25,388
That's all right. I can help you.

3
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:26,162
Who is this?

4
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:28,487
I am a doctor. Now, you must listen to me.

5
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:29,885
You have lost your memory.

6
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,935
There was an experiment. Something went wrong.

7
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,160
Your memory was erased.

8
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,158
Do you understand me?

9
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:36,296
No, I don't understand. What the hell is going on here?

10
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:39,064
Just listen. There are people coming for you even as we speak.

11
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:41,843
You must not let them find you. You must leave now.

12
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:45,376
Hello? Are you there?

13
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,942
Hey, Mr. Murdoch. The Automat called.

14
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:48,910
Said you left your wallet there.

15
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,144
I suggest you retrieve it since you only paid for 3 weeks...

16
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:55,047
and they was up 10 minutes ago.

17
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:58,745
I've been here 3 weeks?

18
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:01,120
It's right there in black and white, Mr. Murdoch.

19
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:03,553
Day and date.

20
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:04,260
J. Murdock

21
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,718
We make our books like we make our beds, all neat and tidy.

22
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,594
I'll take care of it when I get back.

23
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:11,793
See that you do. Only thing makes you a guest...

24
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:14,166
in this joint, pal, is cash on the barrelhead.

25
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,730
House rules. 3 weeks is 3 weeks.

26
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,494
No days off for good behavior.

27
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:09,117
Mr. Murdoch, yes, where is he?

28
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:12,855
He just left not 5 minutes ago.

29
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:18,025
Sleep now.

30
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,367
~ When marimba rhythms start to play ~

31
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:26,466
~ Dance with me ~

32
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:29,501
~ Make me sway ~

33
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:33,675
~ Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore ~

34
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,911
~ Hold me close ~

35
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:38,716
~ Sway me more ~

36
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:43,020
~ Like a flower bending in the breeze ~

37
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:45,459
~ Bend with me ~

38
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:48,395
~ Sway with ease ~

39
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:52,595
~ When we dance you have a way with me ~

40
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:54,830
~ Stay with me ~

41
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,304
~ Sway with me ~

42
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,196
Hey, sweetie!

43
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:02,269
He said he was your husband's doctor.

44
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:03,778
He wanted to speak with you.

45
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,279
Daniel P.Schreber Psychiatrist

46
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,155
Excuse me.

47
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:28,197
Dr. Sh...

48
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:31,163
Schreber. Please, won't you come in?

49
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:33,400
You must be Emma Murdoch.

50
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,438
Thank you for coming to see me on such short notice.

51
00:08:39,248 --> 00:08:40,977
What is this?

52
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:45,944
A rather crude experiment... designed to further my studies.

53
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,148
I don't understand.

54
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:49,216
You say you're my husband's doctor,

55
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:52,286
but he never mentioned you to me.

56
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:53,659
The truth is, Mrs. Murdoch...

57
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:56,164
John has been coming to see me for quite some time.

58
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:59,929
He had been grappling with feelings of betrayal...

59
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:03,030
stemming from your marital difficulties.

60
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:05,300
- John told you what happened?      - Yes.

61
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,673
When was the last time that you saw him?

62
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:10,178
3 weeks ago.

63
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:13,978
He packed a suitcase. He was very angry at me.

64
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:17,008
I understand how difficult this must be for you.

65
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:18,680
But for John's sake, I would like you...

66
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:21,349
to think of me as your friend, Emma.

67
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,156
It appears that John has suffered a psychotic break.

68
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:26,422
Complete memory loss.

69
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:30,089
He may be delusional.

70
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:32,032
Even violent.

71
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:33,501
Emma...

72
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:37,967
if he were to contact you, and I suspect he will...

73
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:40,874
you must call me immediately. Do you understand?

74
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,679
It is imperative that I be the first one to reach him.

75
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:48,647
Wherever your husband is, he is searching...

76
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:52,544
...for himself.

77
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:04,530
Good evening, Mr. Murdoch.

78
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:07,331
It is Mr. Murdoch, isn't it?

79
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:11,237
Mr... was it "J"...something... Murdoch?

80
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:15,370
J. Murdoch.

81
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:18,903
What's your name? Justin? Jerry?

82
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:20,977
No.

83
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:24,711
My name's Jason Murdoch. John Murdoch.

84
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,187
Jake Murdoch. How's it going?

85
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:27,382
Hi. Jack Murdoch.

86
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:31,682
Hi.

87
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,898
Bumstead.

88
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:17,800
I told the guy, "Cash on the barrelhead."

89
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,298
I said, "Listen, 3 weeks is 3 weeks."

90
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:22,571
Where's our lucky winner?

91
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:25,444
Upstairs, sir, room 614.

92
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:28,245
Another call girl.

93
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:30,809
"J. Murdoch."

94
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:33,716
Evening, Husselbeck.

95
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:35,087
Inspector Bumstead.

96
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:37,058
Your lace is untied.

97
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:39,354
Sir.

98
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:51,762
Am I glad you're here, sir.

99
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:54,435
They say Detective Walenski's got the heebie-jeebies.

100
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:56,740
Just take what they give me, Husselbeck.

101
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,721
Wow.

102
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:07,921
Looks like somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

103
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,525
- Hello.      - Oh, it's you.

104
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:54,968
You left your wallet here, buddy.

105
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,301
When did I do that?

106
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:57,464
When you was last here.

107
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:00,634
- When was that?       - When you left your wallet.

108
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:02,439
You expect me to remember?

109
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:08,478
Hello. Excuse me.

110
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:11,386
No, no, seriously.

111
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:15,656
Alleged?

112
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:31,999
- Where you headed, chief?      - Home.

113
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,065
And where's home?

114
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:35,872
Haven't you mugs got anything better to do?

115
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:38,175
Well, I'm just trying to do my job, May.

116
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:40,272
There's a killer out there in case you hadn't noticed.

117
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:41,557
Maybe you should be out looking for him

118
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:43,012
instead of cooling your heels, huh?

119
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:48,015
Go on, get out of here.

120
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,354
Come on.

121
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,797
Round and round she goes.

122
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:07,334
Where she stops? Nobody knows.

123
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:13,640
What's that make so far, Husselbeck? 6 hookers in all?

124
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:15,149
I believe so, sir.

125
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:17,709
Give the man an "A" for effort.

126
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:19,983
You'd think these stiffs would have the good grace...

127
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:22,149
to expire at a good time of night.

128
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,126
Hey, too bad about Walenski, huh?

129
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:30,321
I guess he'd seen enough.

130
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:38,428
So, Husselbeck...

131
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,706
what kind of killer do you think

132
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:46,246
stops to save a dying fish?

133
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:47,270
You've got me, sir.

134
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:49,443
Bumstead, what took you?

135
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:51,616
This killer's been running circles around us

136
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:52,450
thanks to Walenski.

137
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,551
With all due respect, Chief Inspector...

138
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,582
I've known Eddie a long time. He's a good cop.

139
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:59,627
Whatever kind of cop Walenski once was,

140
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:01,824
he let drift a long time ago.

141
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:03,695
Let me talk to Bumstead!

142
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:05,097
Come on, let's go.

143
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:06,499
Hold on!

144
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,433
Frank, Frank!

145
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:11,131
Get his arm!

146
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:12,462
They're watching us!

147
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:13,532
On your feet.

148
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,008
There's no way out!

149
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,375
Don't make us hurt you.

150
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:18,141
God, can't you see?!

151
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:22,848
Let me go, let me go!

152
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:24,352
I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not...

153
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:27,651
- What was that?      - Walenski.

154
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:39,194
I'm being punished for my sins, right?

155
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:41,600
What did I ever do to inherit this?

156
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:42,929
Where do you begin?

157
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:46,209
Well, everything Detective Walenski committed to paper

158
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,922
should be here, so...

159
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:51,302
The only thing that should be committed is Walenski.

160
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:55,247
Nothing like a little healthy paranoia.

161
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:01,915
Sir, we just got the fingerprint results in.

162
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:07,057
What is this, some kind of joke?

163
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,665
Don't throw anything away.

164
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:19,899
Inspector Bumstead.

165
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:24,907
I came here to file a missing persons report for my husband.

166
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:27,581
Take it to the front desk.

167
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:29,447
They told me to come see you.

168
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,415
His name's John Murdoch.

169
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:37,482
Mrs. Murdoch, why didn't you report this before?

170
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:40,559
I mean, if your husband has been missing

171
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,725
as long as you say...

172
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:45,460
I thought he'd simply walked out on me.

173
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:50,594
Then a... doctor contacted me this evening.

174
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,266
How long have you been married?

175
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,604
Nearly four years.

176
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,575
Why do you ask?

177
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:59,630
Because you seem uncomfortable with your ring.

178
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:03,411
As if you were... unaccustomed to wearing it.

179
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:04,885
No, I never take it off.

180
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,887
Do these names mean anything to you?

181
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,736
No. Who are these women?

182
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,334
Why are you looking for my husband?

183
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,906
Are you going to accuse him of something?

184
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:30,241
Maybe. Maybe murder.

185
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,303
Whose murder?

186
00:17:32,714 --> 00:17:36,411
- Which one?      - All of them.

187
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:39,581
Mrs. Murdoch, I am sorry, I'm sorry.

188
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,679
I didn't mean to alarm you.

189
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:43,282
I'm so sorry that I came. Just both made a mistake.

190
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:44,792
Mrs. Murdoch, if you please.

191
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:47,260
If you'll just give me half a second to explain...

192
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,588
I'll be right out.

193
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:18,055
Have we met before?

194
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:21,722
If we did... I hope you're still breathing.

195
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:23,390
What's your name, honey?

196
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,432
John.

197
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:28,932
Well, that's an appropriate name.

198
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:30,827
Yeah.

199
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,173
I was just thinking.

200
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:43,942
What you do...

201
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:48,486
seems kind of dangerous...

202
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:50,514
right now.

203
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,288
I mean, how do you know I'm not the killer?

204
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:55,524
You don't seem like the killer type. Why?

205
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:59,257
You feeling any urges I should know about?

206
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:22,381
Aw, shoot.

207
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:24,780
So it seems you've discovered your unpleasant nature.

208
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:28,980
Who are you?

209
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:32,687
We might ask the same question, yes?

210
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:35,322
Sleep now.

211
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,022
He can tune.

212
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:59,410
What is to be done? This man is dangerous.

213
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:01,382
It is said he is able to tune.

214
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,781
Impossible.

215
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:05,616
We have seen it with our own eyes.

216
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:08,088
On occasion the imprinting does not take.

217
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:11,092
They behave erratically when they awaken.

218
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:14,755
We find them wandering like lost children.

219
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:16,957
But this one was different, yes?

220
00:22:16,998 --> 00:22:18,693
What has the doctor to say about this?

221
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,724
He has failed to report in.

222
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,897
- And Mr. Quick?      - No more Mr. Quick.

223
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:26,931
Mr. Quick, dead, yes.

224
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:32,572
Poor, poor Mr. Quick.

225
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:35,481
Mr. Book, does he know?

226
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:38,649
Should we not know, Mr. Hand?

227
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:42,488
We had hoped to learn more before sharing with you.

228
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:45,459
We can know nothing until we possess him.

229
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,088
Mr. Night, you will take the East.

230
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,928
Mr. Face, you the West.

231
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,060
Mr. Glove, the South.

232
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:56,332
Mr. Shade, the North.

233
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,842
We must have this man.

234
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,124
Do you really think

235
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:19,483
my husband could be capable of committing those murders?

236
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:21,486
Do you?

237
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:26,222
Let's hope, for both our sakes, that I'm wrong.

238
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:55,991
John.

239
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,472
I've been so worried about you.

240
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,977
Are you punishing me?

241
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,613
You know, if disappearing is your way of punishing me...

242
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:21,747
I don't appreciate it.

243
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,849
I don't know what you're talking about.

244
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:29,186
I found these keys in my pocket...

245
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,926
so I assume I live here.

246
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,730
You supposed to be my wife?

247
00:24:33,768 --> 00:24:35,793
Supposed to be?

248
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:37,862
John.

249
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:40,136
You really...

250
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:42,676
don't know who I am, do you?

251
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:44,639
Your doctor called me.

252
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:46,169
He was worried that this might happen.

253
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:47,704
My doctor?

254
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:50,274
Yeah. He...

255
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:52,343
he gave me his card.

256
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:54,912
He's desperate to find you.

257
00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:57,481
Schreber.

258
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,889
I feel like I'm living out someone else's nightmare.

259
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:06,696
What happened to me? Why was I seeing a doctor?

260
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,562
I had an affair.

261
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,073
You were angry at me.

262
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,375
The police are looking for you.

263
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:19,710
I know. I saw the papers.

264
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:22,308
"Killer stalks city streetwalkers."

265
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,515
I was with one of those women...

266
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:31,254
before I came here tonight.

267
00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:33,587
I don't understand.

268
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:35,095
I met her outside an Automat.

269
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:39,158
I guess I wanted to test myself.

270
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,136
I wanted to know if I had it in me to do those things.

271
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:45,539
Maybe I have lost my mind, but whoever I am,

272
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,767
I'm still me and I'm not a killer.

273
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:55,583
I believe you.

274
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:58,446
You do?

275
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:03,346
What?

276
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:06,189
The car outside, the one you arrived in.

277
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:08,559
It's a cop. He dropped me off here.

278
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:13,327
I didn't know he was still here.

279
00:26:13,368 --> 00:26:14,392
John.

280
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:17,934
Hold it right there, mister!

281
00:26:19,841 --> 00:26:21,809
Wait. You have the wrong man.

282
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:22,969
Stand aside, will you, please?

283
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,603
I didn't kill anyone.

284
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:27,740
Right now what you are is a suspect. Turn yourself in.

285
00:26:28,683 --> 00:26:30,241
I'll listen to whatever you have to say.

286
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:32,185
You're not gonna believe what I have to say.

287
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:34,380
Try me.

288
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:36,547
There's someone after me.

289
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:39,719
There's this group of men. They want me dead.

290
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:42,389
And I don't even know if... They're not even...

291
00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:45,394
Yeah, who's gonna listen to a madman?

292
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,230
Stand aside, Mrs. Murdoch.

293
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:48,394
Run!

294
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,970
No one ever listens to me.

295
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:01,641
Murdoch, stop!

296
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:07,586
Murdoch!

297
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:45,428
How much further?

298
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:46,850
We're almost there, buddy.

299
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:52,763
Hey, you happen to know the way to Shell Beach?

300
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:53,802
You're kidding.

301
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,802
Me and the missus spent our honeymoon there.

302
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:58,567
All you gotta do is take Main Street west to...

303
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:03,104
Or is it the cross...

304
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,773
You know, that's funny. I can't seem to remember...

305
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:09,113
if it's Main Street west or the cross-town.

306
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:17,315
I'm sorry, Inspector, I cannot be of more assistance...

307
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:19,223
but I am running late for an appointment.

308
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,455
Well, I appreciate your taking the time.

309
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:32,069
There's just one thing that puzzles me.

310
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:36,770
I've met quite a few murderers in the course of my work.

311
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,473
Murdoch doesn't strike me as one.

312
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:42,777
Perhaps you are not accustomed to digging deep enough.

313
00:28:42,777 --> 00:28:45,743
Well, I do know when someone is lying to me, Doctor.

314
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:48,415
Forgive me, Inspector, but you are not a clinician.

315
00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:52,187
Judging personalities happens to be my business.

316
00:28:52,227 --> 00:28:54,252
Well, maybe you could give me a few pointers.

317
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:56,026
Certainly.

318
00:28:56,164 --> 00:28:58,189
Let's take you, for instance.

319
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:01,600
You are a fastidious man, driven.

320
00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:03,695
Consumed by details.

321
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:06,372
I would say your life is...

322
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:08,664
rather Ionely.

323
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:12,037
Good evening, Inspector. I really must be going.

324
00:29:53,421 --> 00:29:57,755
Closing time. The pool is now closed.

325
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:05,521
Dr. Schreber.

326
00:30:07,302 --> 00:30:09,299
Most unfortunate it is

327
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,931
that we were forced to seek you out here.

328
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:15,536
You know how uncomfortable we find all this...

329
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:17,506
moisture.

330
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:21,109
- I'm sorry. I...      - Failed to report in, yes.

331
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:23,777
I was frightened. I have a weak heart, you know.

332
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:27,686
Your weakness is not, we think, an affair of the heart.

333
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:30,384
We found this in his hotel room.

334
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:34,361
Must we reproduce Mr. Murdoch's memories again?

335
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:35,453
I tried to imprint him...

336
00:30:35,496 --> 00:30:37,623
but he woke up, he knocked the syringe right out of my hand.

337
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:39,758
I tried to stop him but he was too fast.

338
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:40,961
He has no memories, then?

339
00:30:41,002 --> 00:30:44,369
Only fragments. The procedure, it was interrupted.

340
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:47,608
I guess it's only a matter of rounding him up.

341
00:30:47,942 --> 00:30:49,800
You have had strays before, right?

342
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:53,473
This is no stray, Doctor. This one can tune.

343
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:56,713
But that's impossible. I thought only you had that ability.

344
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:57,751
You will process

345
00:30:57,751 --> 00:31:01,051
another template of the subject's memories, yes?

346
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:02,818
Of course. I'll imprint him again.

347
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:07,351
No. We require them for a quite different purpose.

348
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:10,664
It's almost midnight, Dr. Schreber.

349
00:31:10,698 --> 00:31:13,132
We'll talk again after tonight's tuning, but...

350
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:15,498
no more delays, yes?

351
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:20,337
No more inconsistencies in your behavior.

352
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:30,716
You appear quite frail, Doctor.

353
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:34,978
Perhaps some exercise would do you good.

354
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:49,762
- Come in.      - Kate.

355
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:56,537
- How is he?      - The same.

356
00:31:57,912 --> 00:32:00,506
Walenski? It's me, Frank.

357
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:08,344
Come in, Frank.

358
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:12,425
Close the door.

359
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:23,835
I've been looking through some of your old reports.

360
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:25,996
It's an interesting case.

361
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:32,010
The kind that can make a man's career...

362
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,240
or break it.

363
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:35,613
Yeah, I was on that case.

364
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,916
And then what? What happened then, Eddie?

365
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:41,785
Nothing happened, Frank.

366
00:32:41,823 --> 00:32:44,224
I've just been spending time on the subway,

367
00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:45,953
riding in circles.

368
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,893
Thinking in circles.

369
00:32:48,796 --> 00:32:49,888
There's no way out.

370
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:53,564
I've been over every inch of this city.

371
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:00,672
You're scaring your wife to death, Eddie.

372
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,403
She's not my wife.

373
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:06,880
I don't know who she is. I don't know who any of us are.

374
00:33:06,914 --> 00:33:08,848
What makes you say that?

375
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:10,942
Do you think about the past much, Frank?

376
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,887
As much as the next guy.

377
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:17,617
See, I've been trying to remember things...

378
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:20,354
clearly remember things from my past.

379
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:22,614
But the more I try to think back,

380
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,642
the more it all starts to unravel.

381
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:27,198
None of it seems real.

382
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:31,202
It's like I've just been dreaming this life...

383
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:34,199
and when I finally wake up I'll be somebody else.

384
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:36,073
Somebody totally different.

385
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:43,511
You saw something, didn't you, Eddie?

386
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:46,543
Something to do with the case.

387
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:50,413
There is no case. There never was!

388
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:55,095
It's all just a big joke! It's a joke!

389
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,334
Tonight's requirements are...

390
00:34:38,372 --> 00:34:43,139
12 family photo albums, 9 personal diaries...

391
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:48,114
17 love letters, assorted childhood photographs...

392
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:52,245
26 wallets, ID's and social security cards.

393
00:34:52,286 --> 00:34:54,379
These do bring back memories.

394
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:58,987
This one is still warm.

395
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:00,823
What is it?

396
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:04,058
The recollections of a great lover?

397
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:07,044
A catalog of conquests?

398
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:08,658
We will soon find out.

399
00:35:10,037 --> 00:35:12,267
You wouldn't appreciate that, would you,

400
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:14,667
Mr. Whatever your name Is?

401
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:19,078
Not the sort of conquests you would ever understand.

402
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:21,071
Let's see.

403
00:35:22,383 --> 00:35:25,079
A touch of unhappy childhood.

404
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:33,621
A dash of teenage rebellion.

405
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:38,194
And last, but not least...

406
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:40,496
a tragic death in the family.

407
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:41,523
Doctor.

408
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:44,762
Mr. Book.

409
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:53,975
Why does Murdoch not sleep...

410
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:55,915
during the tuning as the others do?

411
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,080
I don't know. Maybe he's a step up the evolutionary ladder.

412
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:02,988
A freak of nature. He's adapting to survive.

413
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:04,065
What do you expect?

414
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,425
Weren't you looking for the human soul?

415
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,020
That's the purpose of your little zoo, isn't it?

416
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,396
That's why you keep changing people

417
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:12,396
and things around every night.

418
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:15,527
Maybe you have finally found what you are looking for...

419
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:16,763
and it's going to bite you on your...

420
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:24,370
It requires several of your lifetimes to master our gifts.

421
00:36:24,412 --> 00:36:28,280
The idea that a simple man could develop the ability to tune...

422
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:29,840
Is absurd, I know...

423
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:31,943
but what other explanation is there?

424
00:36:36,757 --> 00:36:38,748
It is time.

425
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:25,269
Shut it down.

426
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:42,286
Get your paper right here!

427
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:55,530
It's driving me crazy.

428
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:57,002
I can't sleep.

429
00:37:57,037 --> 00:37:58,834
And they call my job "unskilled".

430
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:00,170
You think you've got it tough?

431
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:02,072
You try looking after these kids, for a change.

432
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:03,967
Anyways,

433
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:07,107
Frederickson says he'll take me off the damn night shift soon.

434
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:09,548
Well, it's about time, dear.

435
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:26,315
Hello?

436
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:30,189
Hello?!

437
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:35,435
Wake up!

438
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:36,992
Hey!

439
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:40,738
Wake up!

440
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:42,674
Wake up!

441
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:45,845
Wake up!

442
00:39:47,648 --> 00:39:48,948
Hello?!

443
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:52,810
Can anybody hear me?!

444
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,348
Let the tuning commence.

445
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:41,978
The Goodwins. Jeremy, Sylvia...

446
00:42:42,022 --> 00:42:44,320
Jane and little Matthew.

447
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:50,187
Jane and little Matthew.

448
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:22,989
The rich get richer.

449
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,693
Probably have maid's quarters before the night is through.

450
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:21,684
Dr. Schreber, I presume.

451
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:23,211
It's you.

452
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:24,656
Hey, come on.

453
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:26,886
That's no way to greet a patient, Doctor.

454
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:28,690
If that's what you are, huh, Doctor?

455
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:30,128
Mr. Murdoch, please, l...

456
00:44:30,164 --> 00:44:32,029
What is happening here? Why is everyone asleep?

457
00:44:32,065 --> 00:44:34,431
Shh. Please keep your voice down.

458
00:44:34,468 --> 00:44:36,402
Why can't I remember anything? What have you done to me?

459
00:44:36,436 --> 00:44:39,200
Nothing, nothing. Please, I want to help you.

460
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:40,536
We can't talk here.

461
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:41,775
It is not safe. If they see us

462
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:42,769
together, they'll...

463
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,243
I don't care. I want some answers.

464
00:44:44,278 --> 00:44:45,609
I want some answers now!

465
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:46,806
Who are they?

466
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:48,781
Why are they trying to kill me?

467
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:49,976
Answer me!

468
00:44:55,222 --> 00:44:58,385
My God. You really can do it.

469
00:44:58,425 --> 00:44:59,382
I did that?

470
00:44:59,382 --> 00:45:01,990
Listen to me, John. You have their power.

471
00:45:02,029 --> 00:45:04,122
You can make things happen by will alone.

472
00:45:04,164 --> 00:45:05,373
They call it tuning.

473
00:45:05,373 --> 00:45:07,463
That is how they make the buildings change.

474
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:10,061
Just now you acted out of self-defense. A reflex.

475
00:45:10,103 --> 00:45:12,936
But I can teach you to control your power consciously.

476
00:45:12,973 --> 00:45:15,305
Let me help you, John. Together we can stop them.

477
00:45:15,342 --> 00:45:16,969
We can take the city back.

478
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:20,976
My glasses.

479
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,384
My glasses, please.

480
00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:15,161
He made a terrible impression for the firm...

481
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:17,534
Iollygagging around as he did.

482
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:18,866
So I simply told Frederickson

483
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:20,472
I was going to have to let him go.

484
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:22,803
And well you should have, darling.

485
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:24,908
He attacked me.

486
00:46:25,879 --> 00:46:27,107
I don't know where he has gone.

487
00:46:28,215 --> 00:46:29,880
Come, Dr. Schreber.

488
00:46:31,118 --> 00:46:32,710
We have much to do.

489
00:46:32,753 --> 00:46:34,316
Yes?

490
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:35,949
Yes.

491
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:58,838
~ They say that you're a run-around lover ~

492
00:46:58,879 --> 00:47:02,781
~ Though you say ~

493
00:47:02,816 --> 00:47:06,718
~ It isn't so ~

494
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:15,658
~ But if you put me down for another ~

495
00:47:17,998 --> 00:47:20,228
~ I'll know ~

496
00:47:20,267 --> 00:47:24,704
~ Believe me, I'll know ~

497
00:47:26,406 --> 00:47:30,274
~'Cause the night ~

498
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,246
~ Has a thousand eyes ~

499
00:47:35,148 --> 00:47:39,084
~ And a thousand eyes ~

500
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,384
~ Can't tell, but see ~

501
00:47:44,758 --> 00:47:51,322
~ If you are true to me ~

502
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:57,094
~ So remember ~

503
00:47:57,137 --> 00:48:02,837
~ When you tell those little white lies ~

504
00:48:02,876 --> 00:48:13,309
~ That the night has a thousand eyes ~

505
00:48:16,423 --> 00:48:20,757
~ A thousand eyes ~

506
00:48:27,434 --> 00:48:28,961
Tonight's experiment shall be conducted

507
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:30,967
in the following locations.

508
00:48:31,004 --> 00:48:35,407
The first subject shall be imprinted here on Avenue M.

509
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:37,967
Mr. Book. There is a problem.

510
00:48:38,011 --> 00:48:41,344
There is no Avenue M. We were unable to complete it.

511
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:45,112
During the last tuning we detected a lack of control.

512
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:47,814
An opposing influence on the machines?

513
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:52,587
Then this man Murdoch is more powerful than we thought.

514
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:54,389
He's becoming like us.

515
00:48:54,428 --> 00:48:58,990
So we must become like him.

516
00:48:59,032 --> 00:49:01,466
The good doctor has done as we asked?

517
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:04,766
The life and times of John Murdoch, Volume 2.

518
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,472
We must not do this.

519
00:49:09,509 --> 00:49:13,036
Murdoch does not possess these memories, yes?

520
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,742
How will his imprint allow us to find him?

521
00:49:15,782 --> 00:49:18,114
Everywhere he goes...

522
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:20,779
everyone he seeks out will be known to us.

523
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:22,815
And as he follows the clues,

524
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:25,819
so shall we follow the memories.

525
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,521
Perhaps we have forgotten what happened last time, when we t...

526
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:31,690
Yes. Poor, poor Mr...

527
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:33,596
We have not forgotten.

528
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:38,873
If Mr. Hand wishes to make this sacrifice

529
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:40,906
for the greater good...

530
00:49:41,508 --> 00:49:42,975
so be it.

531
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:48,208
But to imprint one of us. Failure has always resulted.

532
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:51,775
What Mr. Hand proposes is our only option.

533
00:49:51,818 --> 00:49:53,251
Imprint.

534
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:00,688
This may sting a bit.

535
00:50:37,531 --> 00:50:39,431
Is it done?

536
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,692
Oh, yes, Mr. Book.

537
00:50:43,637 --> 00:50:47,164
I have John Murdoch... in mind.

538
00:50:51,945 --> 00:50:53,139
"Johnny...

539
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,338
"I found this postcard among your mother's things.

540
00:50:57,384 --> 00:50:59,511
"Brings back memories, doesn't it?

541
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:01,418
"Stop by sometime.

542
00:51:01,454 --> 00:51:03,251
"We'll see if we can't hook ourselves...

543
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,621
"another mermaid.

544
00:51:04,658 --> 00:51:06,626
"Love to Emma. Karl."

545
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:10,191
Shell Beach

546
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:12,499
K.Harris.

547
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:13,837
Karl.

548
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:16,984
Karl Harris.

549
00:51:25,378 --> 00:51:26,743
Harris.

550
00:51:27,214 --> 00:51:28,681
Harris.

551
00:51:30,917 --> 00:51:32,657
"Harris Karl."

552
00:51:34,754 --> 00:51:37,621
Excuse me. Can you tell me the way to Avenue C?

553
00:51:37,657 --> 00:51:38,851
Try the subway.

554
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:44,420
You got a problem, pal?

555
00:51:44,464 --> 00:51:47,399
You've been working here long?

556
00:51:48,468 --> 00:51:51,767
25 years. No days off for good behavior.

557
00:52:16,896 --> 00:52:20,059
We're looking for John Murdoch.

558
00:52:54,034 --> 00:52:56,127
She knows nothing, Mr. Hand.

559
00:52:56,169 --> 00:52:58,296
A dead end, yes, Mr. Wall.

560
00:52:58,338 --> 00:52:59,338
We thought his imprint would

561
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:00,932
allow us to track him, yes...

562
00:53:00,974 --> 00:53:03,408
but instead we have been brought here.

563
00:53:03,443 --> 00:53:05,070
This is irrational.

564
00:53:05,111 --> 00:53:07,443
Instincts are irrational, Mr. Wall...

565
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,616
and we must follow where they lead, yes.

566
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:14,283
Mr. Sleep suggests he may go to places familiar...

567
00:53:14,284 --> 00:53:15,444
his job.

568
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:17,547
He does not care about our job.

569
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,423
Indulge us, Mr. Hand.

570
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,087
If you were Murdoch...

571
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:23,117
Yes.

572
00:53:23,163 --> 00:53:24,397
If...

573
00:53:25,131 --> 00:53:26,689
I were Murdoch...

574
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:30,235
I would remember...

575
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,831
how my wife had hurt me by sleeping with another man.

576
00:53:35,408 --> 00:53:36,875
And then...

577
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:42,103
I would look for a way to hurt her in return.

578
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:48,151
Leave me alone with her.

579
00:53:48,188 --> 00:53:49,951
There's work to be done.

580
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,758
All change, platform 3.

581
00:53:55,795 --> 00:53:58,628
Platform 3, all change.

582
00:53:58,665 --> 00:54:00,360
All change? Excuse me.

583
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,731
How do I get to the end of the line?

584
00:54:01,768 --> 00:54:03,326
You want the Express.

585
00:54:11,077 --> 00:54:14,342
No trains leave on platform 7.

586
00:54:14,381 --> 00:54:15,780
- You want platform 2.      - Got it. Thanks a lot.

587
00:54:15,815 --> 00:54:16,804
Hey!

588
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,317
How come that train didn't stop?

589
00:54:18,351 --> 00:54:19,841
That's the Express.

590
00:54:21,187 --> 00:54:23,021
There's no way out, you know?

591
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:26,057
You can't get out of the city. Believe me, I've tried.

592
00:54:27,127 --> 00:54:28,788
You're Murdoch, aren't you?

593
00:54:29,262 --> 00:54:31,025
The one they've been looking for.

594
00:54:31,064 --> 00:54:32,895
- Who are you?      - Used to be a cop.

595
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,068
At least, in this life, I was.

596
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:38,562
They steal people's memories, you know?

597
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:40,936
Then they swap them around between us.

598
00:54:40,974 --> 00:54:43,670
I've seen them do it. Back and forth, back and forth...

599
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,803
till no one knows who they are anymore.

600
00:54:45,845 --> 00:54:47,107
How do you know all this?

601
00:54:47,147 --> 00:54:49,017
Once in a while, one of us wakes up

602
00:54:49,017 --> 00:54:51,130
while they're changing things.

603
00:54:51,518 --> 00:54:53,748
It's not supposed to happen, but it does.

604
00:54:53,787 --> 00:54:55,512
It happened to me.

605
00:54:55,855 --> 00:54:57,755
They'll come looking for you, Murdoch.

606
00:54:58,892 --> 00:55:00,519
Just like they'll come looking for me.

607
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:02,658
But that's OK.

608
00:55:02,695 --> 00:55:04,162
I figured a way out.

609
00:55:15,575 --> 00:55:16,906
They were here.

610
00:55:18,778 --> 00:55:20,075
Last night.

611
00:55:20,113 --> 00:55:22,411
This was to be his home.

612
00:55:25,151 --> 00:55:27,016
That was when we loved her.

613
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:29,518
This is all well and good, Mr. Hand...

614
00:55:29,518 --> 00:55:31,367
But we require a more practical link

615
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:33,448
to his present whereabouts.

616
00:55:36,129 --> 00:55:37,357
Yes.

617
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:40,663
And I know where to find her.

618
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:51,643
We're very lucky, when you think about it.

619
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:52,767
I'm sorry?

620
00:55:52,812 --> 00:55:55,177
To be able to revisit those places

621
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:57,077
which have meant so very much to us.

622
00:55:57,884 --> 00:56:00,107
I thought it was more that we were haunted by them.

623
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:01,910
Perhaps.

624
00:56:03,623 --> 00:56:05,550
But imagine a life...

625
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:07,920
alien to yours...

626
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:10,156
in which your memories were not your own...

627
00:56:10,196 --> 00:56:13,357
but those shared by every other of your kind.

628
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:17,821
Imagine the torment of such an existence...

629
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:21,306
no experiences to call your own.

630
00:56:23,943 --> 00:56:26,173
If it was all you knew...

631
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:27,941
maybe it would be a comfort.

632
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:31,311
But if you were to discover something different...

633
00:56:32,552 --> 00:56:35,118
Something... better.

634
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:41,653
There used to be a ferry when I was a boy.

635
00:56:41,694 --> 00:56:43,457
Biggest thing you ever saw.

636
00:56:43,496 --> 00:56:46,624
Lit up like a floating birthday cake.

637
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:50,131
That's just what my husband once said to me...

638
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:52,000
on this very spot.

639
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:55,204
Where is your husband now?

640
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:58,733
I wish I knew. What brings you here?

641
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:02,447
I met my wife at this place.

642
00:57:02,482 --> 00:57:04,279
It's where I first met my husband.

643
00:57:04,317 --> 00:57:06,547
Small world.

644
00:57:29,542 --> 00:57:30,736
No, no, no.

645
00:58:00,473 --> 00:58:01,706
Hello?

646
00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:03,769
Hello?

647
00:58:48,988 --> 00:58:50,319
What are you doing here?

648
00:58:50,356 --> 00:58:52,256
I've been following you.

649
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:57,960
Hold it right there!

650
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:01,432
Johnny?

651
00:59:01,868 --> 00:59:03,031
Johnny!

652
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,932
It's been so damn long...

653
00:59:04,971 --> 00:59:07,804
I thought you'd forgotten your Uncle Karl.

654
00:59:08,574 --> 00:59:10,371
You son of a gun!

655
00:59:13,446 --> 00:59:14,913
Uncle Karl?

656
00:59:18,418 --> 00:59:19,544
Wait.

657
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:23,212
Is that me?

658
00:59:23,256 --> 00:59:24,450
Yeah.

659
00:59:33,499 --> 00:59:35,524
Shell Beach is where I grew up?

660
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:36,728
That's what I said.

661
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:39,135
Shell Beach, your hometown.

662
00:59:39,172 --> 00:59:41,998
I need to get there, Karl. How do I get there?

663
00:59:42,408 --> 00:59:44,035
I don't know.

664
00:59:44,077 --> 00:59:45,837
I haven't been there in years.

665
00:59:45,837 --> 00:59:47,137
Come on. You must remember.

666
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,205
You gotta have some idea.

667
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:50,146
Come on!

668
00:59:50,817 --> 00:59:52,045
Sorry, Johnny.

669
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:56,420
The old cracker barrel ain't what it used to be.

670
00:59:59,992 --> 01:00:01,619
So bright there.

671
01:00:01,661 --> 01:00:03,725
Brighter times, I guess.

672
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:08,031
You were always scribbling in that damn book.

673
01:00:08,568 --> 01:00:11,196
That's me and your pa.

674
01:00:11,237 --> 01:00:13,398
What a couple of handsome fools.

675
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:15,734
What happened to my parents?

676
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,874
Where are they now?

677
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:24,840
They're dead, Johnny.

678
01:00:24,884 --> 01:00:27,318
They died when their house burnt down.

679
01:00:27,353 --> 01:00:29,014
I looked after you.

680
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:31,923
You don't remember that, really?

681
01:00:35,228 --> 01:00:36,593
What's that?

682
01:00:37,597 --> 01:00:39,030
What is that?

683
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:45,131
It's a scar.

684
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:48,065
You burnt your arm pretty bad in the fire.

685
01:00:53,613 --> 01:00:55,112
What does it mean, Johnny?

686
01:00:55,112 --> 01:00:56,912
It means these are all lies!

687
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,788
Why are you here, Mrs. Murdoch?

688
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:14,199
My husband told me he'd been here.

689
01:01:18,237 --> 01:01:20,501
He told me he wanted to test himself...

690
01:01:21,707 --> 01:01:23,573
see if he was...

691
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,078
capable of...

692
01:01:35,288 --> 01:01:36,918
I wanted to talk to her.

693
01:01:36,918 --> 01:01:39,088
I thought maybe she could help me find him.

694
01:01:40,793 --> 01:01:42,727
Stay here. I'm gonna call the station.

695
01:01:54,073 --> 01:01:55,404
Yeah, this is Bumstead.

696
01:01:55,404 --> 01:01:59,207
Send the homicide coroner to 1440... East, yeah.

697
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:01,319
There's been another one.

698
01:02:02,348 --> 01:02:04,945
It's the same pattern. I'll explain when you get here.

699
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:16,956
Oh, God.

700
01:02:17,597 --> 01:02:19,792
It's OK. I won't hurt you.

701
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:21,523
It's OK.

702
01:02:31,844 --> 01:02:33,812
Where the hell did she come from?

703
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:35,336
I found her hiding.

704
01:02:36,082 --> 01:02:37,913
She saw what happened here.

705
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:08,037
Are you ready to go home, Mrs. Murdoch?

706
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,742
The inspector is gonna take me. Thanks.

707
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:36,903
It's beautiful.

708
01:03:39,478 --> 01:03:42,277
It was a gift from my mother.

709
01:03:42,615 --> 01:03:45,040
She died recently.

710
01:03:45,384 --> 01:03:47,682
I keep it with me to remind me of her.

711
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:50,987
I'm sorry.

712
01:03:54,427 --> 01:03:56,438
It's a funny thing, though.

713
01:03:56,629 --> 01:03:58,995
I can't remember when she gave it to me.

714
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:04,559
How do you think I could forget a thing like that?

715
01:04:06,739 --> 01:04:10,903
Do you think about the past much, Mrs. Murdoch?

716
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,543
What's happening, Inspector?

717
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:18,577
I'm not sure I know anymore.

718
01:04:22,121 --> 01:04:24,346
I left your old room like it was.

719
01:04:24,724 --> 01:04:26,817
You can sleep here tonight, huh?

720
01:04:26,892 --> 01:04:29,190
Glad to have you back, Johnny...

721
01:04:29,228 --> 01:04:30,923
even if it is for just a night.

722
01:04:30,963 --> 01:04:31,952
Karl.

723
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:34,327
Is that the right time?

724
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:35,699
Why, sure.

725
01:04:35,999 --> 01:04:38,269
That clock's kept perfect time since I bought it.

726
01:04:38,304 --> 01:04:40,101
A.m. Or p. M?

727
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,707
What do you think, Johnny?

728
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:44,733
I don't understand. How can it be night already?

729
01:04:44,777 --> 01:04:46,472
What happened to the day? How'd I miss it?

730
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:49,379
You're tired. Anything's possible.

731
01:04:49,415 --> 01:04:50,814
Look...

732
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,411
get some sleep. We'll straighten all this out tomorrow.

733
01:05:20,279 --> 01:05:23,180
"Gulde to Shell Beach by Johnny Murdoch."

734
01:05:26,152 --> 01:05:27,983
Oh, come on.

735
01:05:46,539 --> 01:05:48,973
- Hello?      - Emma, he's here.

736
01:05:49,008 --> 01:05:51,135
He's acting mighty peculiar.

737
01:05:51,177 --> 01:05:53,236
I know. He's not himself.

738
01:05:53,279 --> 01:05:55,213
Keep him there, and I'll be right over.

739
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:57,579
- I'll try.      - Thanks, Karl. Bye.

740
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:01,211
Johnny.

741
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:03,118
I can't promise anything, Mrs. Murdoch.

742
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:04,713
We just have to play it as it comes.

743
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:08,249
Johnny, we just wanted to help.

744
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:17,035
Karl.

745
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:18,468
Uncle Karl.

746
01:06:18,504 --> 01:06:20,678
Johnny, if you're in some kind of trouble...

747
01:06:20,678 --> 01:06:22,201
well, maybe we could do something.

748
01:06:23,676 --> 01:06:26,144
Haven't seen you in so long.

749
01:06:26,512 --> 01:06:28,070
Yes.

750
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:46,123
Mr. Murdoch... you've been the cause of much distress.

751
01:07:50,162 --> 01:07:52,596
- Start talking.      - There's no need for this.

752
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:53,996
There's no escape.

753
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:56,024
The city's ours. We made it.

754
01:07:56,068 --> 01:07:57,558
What are you talking about?

755
01:07:57,603 --> 01:08:00,800
We fashioned this city on stolen memories...

756
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:04,673
different eras, different pasts all rolled into one.

757
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,201
Each night, we revise it, refine it...

758
01:08:07,246 --> 01:08:08,736
in order to learn.

759
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:10,180
Learn what?

760
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:11,683
About you, Mr. Murdoch...

761
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:13,981
you and your fellow inhabitants...

762
01:08:14,019 --> 01:08:15,816
what makes you human.

763
01:08:16,355 --> 01:08:19,381
- Why?!      - We need to be like you.

764
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:22,725
I understand you now, Mr. Murdoch.

765
01:08:22,761 --> 01:08:24,922
I remember that which you do not...

766
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:26,322
what you've been missing.

767
01:08:26,365 --> 01:08:28,026
The ocean, yes...

768
01:08:29,068 --> 01:08:31,696
running along the waves as a child...

769
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:34,118
meeting Emma at the river...

770
01:08:34,118 --> 01:08:36,706
That first kiss that followed.

771
01:08:37,276 --> 01:08:38,436
What are you?

772
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:40,240
You've seen what we are.

773
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:43,214
We use your dead as vessels.

774
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:53,900
Get in!

775
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:11,886
What about her? Ring any bells?

776
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:13,261
She was alive when I left her.

777
01:11:13,298 --> 01:11:14,390
What about this?

778
01:11:14,433 --> 01:11:16,458
This is nothing. This is...

779
01:11:16,502 --> 01:11:18,800
It must mean something, all those pictures.

780
01:11:18,837 --> 01:11:19,997
What pictures?

781
01:11:21,006 --> 01:11:22,030
I don't understand this.

782
01:11:22,074 --> 01:11:24,907
Stop playing games with me, Murdoch! Stop telling me lies!

783
01:11:24,943 --> 01:11:26,433
I am not telling you lies!

784
01:11:26,478 --> 01:11:28,878
Help me out here. Make me understand.

785
01:11:28,914 --> 01:11:31,007
I have this jigsaw puzzle in front of my face...

786
01:11:31,049 --> 01:11:32,941
and every time I try to rearrange the pieces,

787
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:34,041
it still doesn't make any sense.

788
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,451
You think it makes sense to me?

789
01:11:35,487 --> 01:11:37,546
I'm as much in the dark here as you are.

790
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:39,750
You let me ask you a question?

791
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:42,458
You heard of a place called Shell Beach?

792
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:44,785
- Sure.      - You know how to get there?

793
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,263
- Yeah.      - You tell me?

794
01:11:46,298 --> 01:11:50,428
All right. You just... You go to the...

795
01:11:51,336 --> 01:11:52,394
Where? Where do you go?

796
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:54,531
Just give me a second, will ya?

797
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,369
You can't remember, can you?

798
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:02,112
You think that's kind of odd?

799
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:05,138
Wait.

800
01:12:05,184 --> 01:12:06,583
I got a better one for you.

801
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:07,915
When was the last time...

802
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:10,820
you remember doing something during the day?

803
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:11,948
What do you mean?

804
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:14,254
I just mean... during the day.

805
01:12:15,194 --> 01:12:16,320
Daylight.

806
01:12:16,361 --> 01:12:17,919
When was the last time you remember seeing it?

807
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:19,215
And I'm not talking about

808
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:21,767
some distant, half-forgotten childhood memory.

809
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:24,615
I mean like yesterday? Last week? When?

810
01:12:25,337 --> 01:12:27,337
Can you come up with a single memory?

811
01:12:28,874 --> 01:12:30,136
You can't, can you?

812
01:12:30,175 --> 01:12:33,440
You know something? I don't think the sun even...

813
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:36,175
exists... in this place.

814
01:12:36,215 --> 01:12:38,949
'Cause I've been up for hours and hours and hours

815
01:12:38,949 --> 01:12:40,630
and the night never ends here.

816
01:12:41,253 --> 01:12:43,881
- That is crazy.      - You're damn right this is crazy.

817
01:12:43,922 --> 01:12:46,288
Listen to me, Bumstead. It's not just me.

818
01:12:46,825 --> 01:12:48,350
It's all of us.

819
01:12:48,393 --> 01:12:49,951
They're doing something to all of us.

820
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:52,759
- Shut up, I've heard enough.      - Please listen.

821
01:12:52,798 --> 01:12:54,527
- Shut up, will ya! Shut up!      - Listen to me.

822
01:13:04,776 --> 01:13:08,041
There has to be an explanation for this somewhere.

823
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:17,519
Explain this.

824
01:13:38,143 --> 01:13:40,338
John, I'm so sorry.

825
01:13:41,313 --> 01:13:43,144
I never meant to hurt you, John...

826
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:44,307
and I did it, and I don't know why I did.

827
01:13:44,349 --> 01:13:46,510
I wish I could take it all back.

828
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:49,077
No. Emma... You didn't do it.

829
01:13:49,121 --> 01:13:51,885
This... affair of yours, whatever it is...

830
01:13:51,924 --> 01:13:53,551
the thing you're supposed to have done...

831
01:13:53,592 --> 01:13:55,457
you didn't do it. I don't believe it ever happened.

832
01:13:55,494 --> 01:13:56,893
What do you mean?

833
01:13:56,929 --> 01:13:59,295
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

834
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:02,232
but what if we never knew each other before now?

835
01:14:02,267 --> 01:14:04,701
What if the first time we ever met...

836
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:08,570
was last night in your... in our apartment...

837
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:11,152
and everything you remember...

838
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:13,310
and everything that I'm supposed to remember

839
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:14,610
never really happened?

840
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:17,040
Someone just wants us to think it did.

841
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:24,586
You know, back in the apartment...

842
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,824
I suddenly felt like I didn't know you at all.

843
01:14:29,628 --> 01:14:32,119
It was as if you were a stranger.

844
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:36,128
But how can that be true?

845
01:14:36,735 --> 01:14:39,665
I so vividly remember meeting you.

846
01:14:40,906 --> 01:14:43,572
I remember falling in love with you.

847
01:14:44,776 --> 01:14:46,573
I remember losing you.

848
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:47,969
Time's up.

849
01:14:49,314 --> 01:14:50,804
No, wait, wait.

850
01:14:50,849 --> 01:14:52,976
Please, just...

851
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:54,110
just one more minute.

852
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:02,753
I love you, John.

853
01:15:05,597 --> 01:15:08,293
You can't fake something like that.

854
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:10,598
No, you can't.

855
01:15:40,132 --> 01:15:42,692
Inspector? Sir?

856
01:15:44,102 --> 01:15:46,862
Detective Walenski killed himself last night.

857
01:15:46,905 --> 01:15:50,671
I... kind of thought you should know.

858
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:56,173
Oh, and... the chief wanted to see you.

859
01:15:56,948 --> 01:15:58,108
Sir...

860
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:06,180
I knew you'd track the killer down, sir.

861
01:16:18,904 --> 01:16:19,893
Sir...

862
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,864
shoelace.

863
01:16:36,121 --> 01:16:37,281
How can we help you, sir?

864
01:16:37,322 --> 01:16:39,688
You can sleep.

865
01:16:41,827 --> 01:16:42,816
Gentlemen...

866
01:16:42,861 --> 01:16:44,419
Sleep. Sleep.

867
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:49,328
Evening, sir.

868
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,268
Bumstead.

869
01:17:02,114 --> 01:17:04,409
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you...

870
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:06,110
about the case.

871
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:11,218
Take us to Murdoch.

872
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:12,348
Sleep.

873
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:41,350
Dr. Schreber.

874
01:17:42,521 --> 01:17:44,284
I knew you'd come eventually.

875
01:17:44,322 --> 01:17:45,394
Don't you think it's about time

876
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,018
you started giving me some answers?

877
01:17:47,058 --> 01:17:49,253
Yes. Yes, of course.

878
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:51,023
Won't you please sit down?

879
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:56,157
I come here quite often.

880
01:17:56,201 --> 01:17:58,669
It's one of the few places I'm allowed a moment's peace.

881
01:17:58,703 --> 01:18:02,070
You see, they have an aversion to water.

882
01:18:03,241 --> 01:18:05,175
One could almost call it a phobia.

883
01:18:05,744 --> 01:18:09,009
Who are they? What do they want from me?

884
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:10,130
Right.

885
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:12,708
Well, for now, let's just say...

886
01:18:12,751 --> 01:18:15,447
that you were the subject of their experiment.

887
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:16,852
We all are.

888
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:20,791
You're not crazy, John.

889
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:23,589
And you are not a murderer.

890
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:27,293
I'm sorry about this. I truly am.

891
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:28,856
But we do not have much time...

892
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,528
and I cannot afford the luxury of doing this the right way.

893
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,094
Everything you need to know...

894
01:18:33,138 --> 01:18:35,470
all the answers are in this syringe.

895
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:36,701
I need you to inject yourself.

896
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:39,341
It's the only way to make you understand.

897
01:18:39,377 --> 01:18:40,474
You're kidding me, right?

898
01:18:40,512 --> 01:18:43,481
We're running out of time, John. You have to do this now.

899
01:18:44,382 --> 01:18:45,549
Give me the gun, Doctor.

900
01:18:45,584 --> 01:18:48,018
Inspector, he is more disturbed than we thought.

901
01:18:48,053 --> 01:18:50,783
I may not be the judge of personality that you are...

902
01:18:50,822 --> 01:18:53,791
Doctor, but you're the one who looks disturbed to me.

903
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:56,490
You do not know what you are doing.

904
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:01,791
What, exactly is in this... Doctor?

905
01:19:03,034 --> 01:19:05,229
All the answers you've been looking for, John.

906
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,362
I swear to you.

907
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:10,919
Guess I'll just have to hold on to it for...

908
01:19:10,919 --> 01:19:12,372
safekeeping.

909
01:19:13,011 --> 01:19:14,205
If you don't mind.

910
01:19:14,246 --> 01:19:15,611
Let's go, Doctor.

911
01:19:16,948 --> 01:19:22,318
- Go? Where are we going?      - Shell Beach.

912
01:19:23,355 --> 01:19:25,521
That's where you want to go, isn't it?

913
01:19:25,757 --> 01:19:27,349
The ocean.

914
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:37,891
Why are you doing this?

915
01:19:39,334 --> 01:19:41,331
What do you hope to gain by helping me?

916
01:19:41,373 --> 01:19:42,631
The truth.

917
01:19:43,608 --> 01:19:46,577
None of these maps extend far enough to show the ocean.

918
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:48,010
You won't find anything there...

919
01:19:48,046 --> 01:19:49,980
I promise you! I've been there, and...

920
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,540
If you've been there, you can show us the way, then, can't you?

921
01:19:53,685 --> 01:19:55,243
We'll see for ourselves.

922
01:19:56,621 --> 01:19:57,545
I won't.

923
01:19:58,523 --> 01:20:01,253
I refuse. You can't make me go there!

924
01:20:14,005 --> 01:20:15,666
You were saying, doctor?

925
01:20:27,419 --> 01:20:30,946
I don't understand. Used to be a bridge here.

926
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:39,288
Try that again, your friends are gonna be...

927
01:20:39,331 --> 01:20:40,662
fishing you out of the canal.

928
01:20:40,699 --> 01:20:42,098
Just don't hurt me. I'll tell you everything.

929
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:44,158
It doesn't matter anymore anyway.

930
01:20:51,109 --> 01:20:52,269
What?

931
01:20:55,013 --> 01:20:57,311
Who are you people?

932
01:21:01,486 --> 01:21:05,980
We will give you some more pretty things soon... Anna.

933
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:07,652
I'm not Anna.

934
01:21:09,527 --> 01:21:11,427
You will be soon, yes.

935
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,367
I have another use for her first.

936
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:30,309
First there was darkness. Then came the strangers.

937
01:21:32,484 --> 01:21:34,782
They abducted us and brought us here.

938
01:21:36,054 --> 01:21:38,818
This city, everyone in it...

939
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:40,222
is their experiment.

940
01:21:40,258 --> 01:21:43,159
They mix and match our memories as they see fit...

941
01:21:43,194 --> 01:21:45,958
trying to divine what makes us unique.

942
01:21:46,664 --> 01:21:49,428
One day, a man might be an inspector.

943
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:52,368
The next, someone entirely different.

944
01:21:52,404 --> 01:21:55,703
When they want to study a murderer for instance...

945
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:58,124
they simply imprint one of their citizens

946
01:21:58,124 --> 01:22:00,004
with a new personality...

947
01:22:00,678 --> 01:22:04,705
arrange a family for him, friends, an entire history...

948
01:22:05,517 --> 01:22:06,541
even a lost wallet.

949
01:22:07,152 --> 01:22:08,813
Then they observe the results.

950
01:22:10,255 --> 01:22:12,381
Will a man, given the history of a killer,

951
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:14,381
continue in that vein?

952
01:22:14,492 --> 01:22:18,385
Or are we, in fact, more than the mere sum of our memories?

953
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:20,830
This business of you being a killer

954
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:23,395
was an unhappy coincidence.

955
01:22:23,668 --> 01:22:26,335
You have had dozens of lives before now.

956
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:27,466
You just happened to wake up

957
01:22:27,466 --> 01:22:29,704
while I was imprinting you with this one.

958
01:22:30,475 --> 01:22:32,602
Why are they doing all of this?

959
01:22:32,644 --> 01:22:35,855
It is our capacity for individuality...

960
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:38,541
our souls that makes us different from them.

961
01:22:38,683 --> 01:22:41,049
They think they can find the human soul...

962
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:44,114
if they understand how our memories work.

963
01:22:44,255 --> 01:22:45,517
All they have are collective memories.

964
01:22:45,557 --> 01:22:48,390
They share one group mind.

965
01:22:48,426 --> 01:22:49,893
They're dying, you see?

966
01:22:49,928 --> 01:22:53,130
Their entire race is on the brink of extinction.

967
01:22:53,398 --> 01:22:55,263
They think we can save them.

968
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,734
- Where do I fit in?      - You are different, John.

969
01:22:58,369 --> 01:23:01,202
You resisted my attempt to imprint you.

970
01:23:05,844 --> 01:23:09,245
Somehow you have developed their ability to tune.

971
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,577
That is how they change things.

972
01:23:10,615 --> 01:23:12,339
That is how they built this city.

973
01:23:12,383 --> 01:23:15,084
They have machines buried deep beneath the surface...

974
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,056
that allow them to focus their telepathic energies.

975
01:23:19,924 --> 01:23:22,415
They control everything here, even the sun.

976
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:25,793
That's why it's always dark. They can't stand the light.

977
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:27,092
So why do they need you?

978
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:28,845
When they first brought us here,

979
01:23:28,845 --> 01:23:31,535
they extracted what was in us.

980
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:33,403
So they could store the information,

981
01:23:33,403 --> 01:23:35,403
remix it like so much paint...

982
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,965
and give us back new memories of their choosing.

983
01:23:38,009 --> 01:23:41,638
But they still needed an artist to help them.

984
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:46,644
I understood the intricacies of the human mind...

985
01:23:46,684 --> 01:23:49,209
better than they ever could...

986
01:23:49,254 --> 01:23:51,984
so they allowed me to keep my skills as a scientist...

987
01:23:52,023 --> 01:23:53,456
because they needed them.

988
01:23:53,491 --> 01:23:55,959
But they made me delete everything else.

989
01:24:04,335 --> 01:24:07,168
Can you imagine what it is like being forced...

990
01:24:07,205 --> 01:24:08,934
to erase your own past?

991
01:24:08,973 --> 01:24:12,306
What about my past? What about my childhood?

992
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:15,357
Shell Beach, Uncle Karl.

993
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:17,978
What about this?

994
01:24:18,883 --> 01:24:20,783
This was blank when I found it!

995
01:24:20,818 --> 01:24:22,843
You still don't understand, John.

996
01:24:22,887 --> 01:24:26,084
You were never a boy... not in this place.

997
01:24:26,124 --> 01:24:28,922
Your entire history is an illusion, a fabrication...

998
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,825
as it is with all of us.

999
01:24:30,862 --> 01:24:33,353
You made those drawings happen with your gift.

1000
01:24:33,398 --> 01:24:35,263
You say they brought us here.

1001
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:38,228
From where?

1002
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,064
I'm sorry.

1003
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,672
I don't remember.

1004
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:47,739
None of us remember that...

1005
01:24:48,446 --> 01:24:50,038
what we once were...

1006
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:51,815
what we might have been...

1007
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:53,915
somewhere else.

1008
01:25:11,402 --> 01:25:13,370
I've taken you this far.

1009
01:25:13,404 --> 01:25:15,531
You don't need me anymore.

1010
01:25:15,573 --> 01:25:17,370
Let's go.

1011
01:25:35,593 --> 01:25:37,390
John.

1012
01:26:01,486 --> 01:26:04,284
There is no ocean, John.

1013
01:26:05,322 --> 01:26:07,852
There is nothing beyond the city.

1014
01:26:09,293 --> 01:26:11,826
The only place home exists...

1015
01:26:13,665 --> 01:26:15,656
is in your head.

1016
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:25,738
No! No!

1017
01:26:25,777 --> 01:26:27,608
John, stop!

1018
01:26:30,181 --> 01:26:31,307
No!

1019
01:26:34,018 --> 01:26:35,315
Stop!

1020
01:26:40,992 --> 01:26:42,186
Please!

1021
01:26:43,027 --> 01:26:44,221
No!

1022
01:27:02,714 --> 01:27:04,875
And now you know the truth.

1023
01:27:24,235 --> 01:27:25,497
No!

1024
01:28:13,518 --> 01:28:16,419
You'll allow yourself to surrender, Mr. Murdoch...

1025
01:28:16,454 --> 01:28:18,684
or it will result in this one's death, yes?

1026
01:28:18,723 --> 01:28:21,248
What do I care? She's not my real wife!

1027
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:22,418
She's nothing to me!

1028
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:26,692
But you do still care, don't you, Mr. Murdoch?

1029
01:28:26,731 --> 01:28:29,393
You see, I have become the monster...

1030
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:31,425
you were intended to be.

1031
01:28:33,237 --> 01:28:37,139
Shall I end her life now as you would have?

1032
01:28:40,178 --> 01:28:42,408
Don't hurt her, please!

1033
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:46,177
Then surrender, Mr. Murdoch.

1034
01:28:47,518 --> 01:28:48,745
Sleep.

1035
01:28:50,888 --> 01:28:52,783
Now.

1036
01:28:54,659 --> 01:28:55,686
John?

1037
01:29:11,309 --> 01:29:12,469
Sleep.

1038
01:29:34,365 --> 01:29:37,198
The doctor was right. He has evolved.

1039
01:29:37,568 --> 01:29:39,092
Kill him.

1040
01:29:39,136 --> 01:29:40,997
Kill him! Kill him!

1041
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:47,639
Kill him! Kill him!

1042
01:29:50,314 --> 01:29:52,839
He is powerful, yes.

1043
01:29:52,884 --> 01:29:57,344
Dangerous. But he can also lead us to what we seek.

1044
01:29:57,388 --> 01:30:00,789
What the doctor calls the soul.

1045
01:30:00,825 --> 01:30:04,522
It is time for our experiment to move into a final phase.

1046
01:30:04,562 --> 01:30:07,292
We no longer need the other subjects.

1047
01:30:07,331 --> 01:30:10,960
The time for study is over.

1048
01:30:11,002 --> 01:30:15,200
It is time to be one with John Murdoch.

1049
01:30:21,879 --> 01:30:23,710
It is time, Doctor.

1050
01:30:23,748 --> 01:30:25,306
Imprint.

1051
01:30:28,085 --> 01:30:30,849
Shut it down!

1052
01:30:30,888 --> 01:30:34,051
Shut it down forever!

1053
01:30:48,189 --> 01:30:49,703
What are you doing?

1054
01:30:50,241 --> 01:30:54,769
They want to imprint you with their own collective memories.

1055
01:30:56,113 --> 01:30:58,051
They want to make you one of them,

1056
01:30:58,051 --> 01:31:00,779
so they can share your soul.

1057
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:08,722
Imprint, Doctor. No more disobedience.

1058
01:31:08,959 --> 01:31:10,590
I'm sorry, John.

1059
01:31:11,028 --> 01:31:13,620
The pain will only last a moment.

1060
01:31:15,766 --> 01:31:16,733
No!

1061
01:31:25,142 --> 01:31:26,439
Remember, John.

1062
01:31:27,712 --> 01:31:29,680
You'll rise to greater heights than that, my boy.

1063
01:31:29,714 --> 01:31:31,477
One day when you're older, you'll understand.

1064
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,615
Remember.

1065
01:31:35,686 --> 01:31:38,553
That's it, John. Practice makes perfect.

1066
01:31:38,589 --> 01:31:41,786
Now remember what I told you. Never talk to strangers.

1067
01:31:41,826 --> 01:31:43,423
John, remember.

1068
01:31:43,661 --> 01:31:44,728
You're probably wondering

1069
01:31:44,628 --> 01:31:46,528
why I keep appearing in your memories.

1070
01:31:46,564 --> 01:31:49,089
It is because I have inserted myself in them.

1071
01:31:49,133 --> 01:31:51,226
All of these memories have been fabricated...

1072
01:31:51,268 --> 01:31:52,963
to teach you about the strangers.

1073
01:31:53,004 --> 01:31:56,132
Give you a lifetime of knowledge in a single syringe.

1074
01:31:58,976 --> 01:32:01,342
You will survive, John.

1075
01:32:01,379 --> 01:32:03,677
You will find strength within yourself...

1076
01:32:03,714 --> 01:32:05,682
and you will prevail.

1077
01:32:05,716 --> 01:32:07,081
Remember.

1078
01:32:07,852 --> 01:32:08,841
Hi, Uncle Karl.

1079
01:32:08,886 --> 01:32:09,875
Johnny!

1080
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:14,983
You're getting the hang of it, John.

1081
01:32:15,026 --> 01:32:17,085
Maybe one day I'll be working for you.

1082
01:32:17,895 --> 01:32:20,136
This is the machine the strangers use

1083
01:32:20,136 --> 01:32:21,359
to amplify their thoughts.

1084
01:32:21,365 --> 01:32:23,230
The machine that changes their world.

1085
01:32:23,267 --> 01:32:24,625
You must take control of it.

1086
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:26,756
You must make the machine yours.

1087
01:32:26,756 --> 01:32:28,464
I know you can beat them, John.

1088
01:32:28,506 --> 01:32:30,997
But you must concentrate.

1089
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:34,302
Something's wrong.

1090
01:32:42,953 --> 01:32:45,683
There is no time for romance, John.

1091
01:32:45,723 --> 01:32:47,655
The world can be what you make it.

1092
01:32:48,117 --> 01:32:49,517
What have you done?

1093
01:32:50,161 --> 01:32:52,686
You have the power to make anything happen...

1094
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:54,220
but you must act now!

1095
01:37:39,116 --> 01:37:40,583
I knew you could do it, John.

1096
01:37:40,617 --> 01:37:42,642
You have their power now.

1097
01:37:42,686 --> 01:37:44,551
You control their machines.

1098
01:37:44,588 --> 01:37:45,987
Where's Emma?

1099
01:37:46,724 --> 01:37:49,557
She is not Emma anymore, John.

1100
01:37:49,593 --> 01:37:50,992
She has been reimprinted.

1101
01:37:51,028 --> 01:37:52,723
So give her back her memories.

1102
01:37:52,763 --> 01:37:55,197
I can't. The facility where the strangers...

1103
01:37:55,232 --> 01:37:58,130
stored the memories has been destroyed.

1104
01:37:58,268 --> 01:37:59,429
I'm sorry.

1105
01:38:00,471 --> 01:38:03,167
What are you going to do now, John?

1106
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:08,709
You told me I had the power, didn't you?

1107
01:38:09,113 --> 01:38:12,104
I can make these machines do anything I want.

1108
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:15,582
Make this world anything I want it to be.

1109
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:20,746
Just so long as I concentrate hard enough.

1110
01:39:44,508 --> 01:39:45,907
Where are you going?

1111
01:39:48,846 --> 01:39:50,313
Shell Beach.

1112
01:40:31,188 --> 01:40:32,587
- What's the fare?      - Quarter.

1113
01:40:38,829 --> 01:40:39,818
Oh, please.

1114
01:40:39,863 --> 01:40:42,388
- Oh, no...      - It's fine.

1115
01:40:42,432 --> 01:40:43,831
- Thank you.      - OK.

1116
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:25,706
John...

1117
01:41:29,479 --> 01:41:31,606
Been waiting for you, yes?

1118
01:41:32,349 --> 01:41:33,509
What are you doing?

1119
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:36,917
I'm just making a few little changes around here, is all.

1120
01:41:36,954 --> 01:41:38,649
Are we sure that's what we want?

1121
01:41:39,156 --> 01:41:41,590
I'm prepared to take my chances.

1122
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,183
I'm dying, John.

1123
01:41:43,227 --> 01:41:46,128
Your imprint is not agreeable with my kind.

1124
01:41:47,631 --> 01:41:49,895
But I wanted to know what it was like...

1125
01:41:51,268 --> 01:41:52,735
how you feel.

1126
01:41:52,769 --> 01:41:55,465
You know how I was supposed to feel.

1127
01:41:55,505 --> 01:41:59,305
That person isn't me. Never was.

1128
01:41:59,343 --> 01:42:03,074
You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human.

1129
01:42:04,448 --> 01:42:07,781
Well, you're not going to find it... in here.

1130
01:42:09,553 --> 01:42:12,147
You went looking in the wrong place.

1131
01:43:50,554 --> 01:43:52,354
It's so beautiful here.

1132
01:43:57,794 --> 01:43:59,261
So bright.

1133
01:44:05,168 --> 01:44:08,001
Do you know if Shell Beach is around here?

1134
01:44:08,038 --> 01:44:10,666
I think that's it just over there.

1135
01:44:28,825 --> 01:44:30,884
I'm headed that way myself.

1136
01:44:32,829 --> 01:44:34,854
Would you like to join me?

1137
01:44:37,033 --> 01:44:38,022
Sure.

1138
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:45,572
I'm Anna, by the way.

1139
01:44:46,109 --> 01:44:48,373
- What's your name?      - John.

1140
01:44:50,781 --> 01:44:52,248
John Murdoch.
