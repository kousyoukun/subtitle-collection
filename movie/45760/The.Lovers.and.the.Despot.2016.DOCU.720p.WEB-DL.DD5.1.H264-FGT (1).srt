Spokesman: Ladies and
gentlemen of the press...

6
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,384
Man: Out of the way!
Come on, down.

7
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,986
Give somebody else a break.

8
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,888
Spokesman:
I have been provided

9
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,490
with the following
background information.

10
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,561
Mr. Shin and Miss Choi are both
nationals of South Korea

11
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,796
and are married.

12
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,365
Mr. Shin was
a well-known director

13
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,634
and Miss Choi
a famous actress

14
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,237
in the South Korean
film industry.

15
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:02,541
Some eight years ago, Miss Choi
appeared in North Korea

16
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,576
after having been in Hong Kong.

17
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,280
Subsequently, Mr. Shin
travelled to Hong Kong

18
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,249
and later appeared
in North Korea.

19
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,218
Today's conference is held
at the request

20
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,587
of Mr. Shin and Miss Choi.

21
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,291
The Shin couple will have
an opening statement

22
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,728

44
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,259
<i> the general staff
 of the Korean revolution.</i>

45
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:51,396
<i> Whenever the us imperialists
 resorted to high-handedness</i>

(applause)

50
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,849
(cheering)

51
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:39,911
In the 1960s,
I was working

52
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:44,316
in a military-intelligence
organization in South Korea.

53
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:50,956
But I didn't have any connection
with the film business.

54
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,326
I was just in the audience.

55
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:01,633
My job was to interrogate
North Korean defectors

56
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,637
and arrest North Korean
espionage agents.

57
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,672
(cheering)

58
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:14,713
<i> In the 1970s,
the North Korean Workers' Party</i>

59
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:20,218
<i> recognized Kim Jong-il
 as his father's heir apparent.</i>

60
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:27,258
<i> So he started to build up
 his own power base.</i>

61
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:34,199
During that period, there was
a very severe power struggle,

62
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,802
to protect Kim Jong-il's power

63
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,373
<i> and his succession to power
 after his father.</i>

64
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,712
Many, many people
were killed and purged.

65
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,215
(cheering)

66
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,860
<i> All of them are brainwashed.</i>

67
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,596
All of them are brainwashed.

68
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,432
But the interrogator's job
is to crack him.

69
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,103
To make him understand
the true story, the true facts,

70
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,772
of what's going on.

Interviewer: Can you describe
what you heard on the tapes?

79
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,987
Because you told us before
that you have heard

80
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,556
Kim Jong-il's voice,
and not many people have.

81
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,842
I cannot do that.

82
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:21,725
Interviewer: I know you can't
explain how you heard it,

83
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,596
but can you explain that
you knew they were real?

84
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,197
And that this was
really Kim Jong-il?

85
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,099
I cannot tell you
the circumstances.

86
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,234
Interviewer: Yes, of course.

87
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,103
Okay, let's... Let's start.
Okay.

88
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,572
I mentioned five tapes

89
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,643
that were released
to the South Korean authorities

90
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,479
and I recognized
Kim Jong-il's voice.

00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,950

00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,051

00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,133

<i>Iain T.A. Hall:
 We received a phone call,</i>

109
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,066
<i> from the Furama Hotel,</i>

110
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,617
that one of their guests had
left the hotel without paying,

111
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,620
in circumstances which
they were unfamiliar with.

112
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,090
<i> I think it was a Sunday.</i>

113
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,393
<i> Just about to come off
 my particular shift.</i>

114
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,029
And because Hong Kong is
such a massive place

115
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,263
with so many people,

116
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:42,400
missing people, missing persons
cases, were, as you can imagine,

117
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,135
happening quite frequently.

118
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,637
But because this case
involved a foreign national,

119
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,207
i.e. not a local
Hong Kong person,

120
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,009
we had to pay
particular attention.

121
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,626
<i> When we got to the hotel,
 everything was in its place.</i>

122
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,932
<i> All her suitcases,
 her personal belongings.</i>

123
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,669
<i> The bathroom had all

126
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,744
<i> So we soon realized that
 we were on to something here</i>

127
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,913
<i> which wasn't just
 a missing person.</i>

128
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,149
Why has she come to Hong Kong?

129
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,218
Who asked her?
Why was she there?

130
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,621
And why had she mysteriously
just disappeared,

131
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,658

of the Earth with no trace?

apartment at Queen's Road East.

<i> A used North Korean

There was something
quite distinctive about him.

154

He had a bit of a swagger,
good-looking and very confident.

<i> It's difficult

something about Shin

<i>David Straub: Kim Jong-il had
 a most bizarre childhood.</i>

224
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:25,748
He was clearly an awful leader
and an awful person,

as an adult.

226

But one has to feel

unable to live anything

<i> Apparently,
 the decision was made</i>

00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:40,996
<i> that Kim Jong-il couldn't
 play with other children.</i>

230

So he had only
a tiny number of playmates.

231
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:49,238
He was put
in an enormous house to live,

given a huge room
stuffed with toys.

<i> to the very odd personality
 that Kim Jong-il developed.</i>

<i> And yet, the people's respect
 for Kim Jong-il</i>

241
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,011
<i> was much less than it was
 for his father, Kim Il-sung.</i>

242
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,517
Kim Jong-il was not the founder,
he was the son.

243
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:37,186
He inherited his position.

244
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:40,122

<i> He looked like a politician.</i>

<i> He laughed, he slapped
 people on the shoulder.</i>

249
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:04,413
And Kim Jong-il was clearly,
in ways, self-aware

250
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,949
and knew that
he was not charismatic.

251

He was introverted, shy.

252
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:13,822
He never really spoke
publically to his people.

Kim Jong-il was actually running
the country, for the most part.

00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,743
Kim Il-sung probably
had the last word,

the retired grandfather,

260
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:41,250

01:11:58,214 --> 01:12:01,449
And I guess he was close to...

321
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:05,753
the man he was in the sixties,
when he was so successful.

322
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:08,790
<i> He was certainly very happy.</i>

323
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:12,060
I suppose you're from
Korea, aren't you?

324
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,729
I came here on
some business.

325
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:16,464
Welcome.

326
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:23,071
Tetsuo: (speaking Japanese)

327
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,857
(inaudible)

328
01:12:46,663 --> 01:12:48,429
<i>Derek Malcolm: They were
 accompanied by about</i>

329
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,765
<i> at least 20 heavies,</i>

330
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,134
whom, I gathered, were...

331
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:56,704
I thought were North Korean
security people.

332
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:01,476
<i> They were definitely
 guarding these people.</i>

333
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:05,480
All in the same suit.
It was very strange.

334
01:13:05,482 --> 01:13:09,517
They were all in exactly
the same dark suit.

335
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:14,756
<i> I don't know...
 They seemed sort of friendly.</i>

336
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:21,162
It did seem as if there was
something slightly odd going on.

337
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:29,036
<i>Yi: They went to the Berlin
 International Film Festival.</i>

338
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:33,608
<i> And there,
 they met South Korean friends</i>

339
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,910
<i> attending this festival.</i>

340
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:40,148
Shin and Choi showed
very cold shoulder to them.

341
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:43,818
"Okay, we're doing very good
in North Korea.

342
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:48,856
You cannot even imagine how
much the party is supporting us.

343
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:52,193
We are freely making films
as we want.

344
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:54,729
We are perfectly okay
in North Korea.

345
01:13:54,731 --> 01:13:56,998
There is no country
in the world

346
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,500
better than North Korea
to be in the film business."

347
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:02,403
<i> North Korean watchdog
 security guards</i>

348
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:05,773
<i> reported to Kim Jong-il when
 they got back to Pyongyang.</i>

349
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:08,976
"Oh, now, don't say anything.

350
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,447
Shin Sang-ok
and Choi Eun-hee

351
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:15,583
are absolutely loyal
to North Korea.

352
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:22,089
<i> They are loyal to Kim Il-sung
 and Kim Jong-il."</i>

353
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:26,494
<i> And they started to obtain
 more confidence</i>

354
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:28,129
<i> from these two leaders.</i>

355
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,932
<i> And they gave them
 better treatment.</i>

356
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:35,970
That was the beginning
of Shin and Choi

357
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:41,008
starting to think about escaping
from North Korea.

358
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:47,882
Tetsuo: (speaking Japanese)

359

01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:44,111
(tape clicks)

371
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:55,490
<i>Straub: Out of the blue,</i>

372
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,625
<i> I received
 a telephone call from a lady,</i>

373
01:19:57,627 --> 01:19:59,927
saying that she was associated

374
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:03,197
with Shin Sang-ok
and Choi Eun-hee,

375
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:05,699
and she needed to talk to me.

376
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:10,404
<i>Her father had met Shin Sang-ok
 when travelling in Europe.</i>

377
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:13,808
She said that Shin had asked him

378
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,677
to pass a message
to the US government,

379
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:20,014
that Shin was being
held under duress,

380
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,783
that he not defected
to North Korea,

381
01:20:22,952 --> 01:20:27,054
that he wished to escape
and come to the United States.

382
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:32,893
<i> And we have a bag, full of
 rattling microcassette tapes</i>

383
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:34,595
<i> like we used to use
 in those days.</i>

384
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:40,167
Well, at that point,
I nearly jumped off my chair

385
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:45,172
and said, "Tapes? Of Shin
talking with Kim Jong-il?"

386
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:47,007
Now, at that time,

387
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,244
no one had ever heard
Kim Jong-il say anything.

388
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:53,214
We didn't know
what his voice sounded like.

389
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:57,952
<i> My wife is originally
 from Korea.</i>

390
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:01,055
I thought it would be useful
if she could help me

391
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:02,957
listen to a few of these tapes,

392
01:21:02,959 --> 01:21:05,226
to see if
they sounded authentic.

393
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:08,996
So, for some silly reason,
we were sitting in bed,

394
01:21:08,998 --> 01:21:13,467
and we actually covered
our heads with the sheets

395
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:17,071
while we were listening covertly
to these tapes.

396

Kim Jong-il:
(speaking Korean on tape)

397
01:22:22,405 --> 01:22:26,006
Choi: (speaking Korean)

01:24:03,506 --> 01:24:04,671
(tram bell rings)

400
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:05,999
On March 13th, Shin Sang-ok,

401
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:08,435
a former South Korean
movie producer,

402
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,537
who has been working
in North Korea,

403
01:25:11,006 --> 01:25:12,940
and Choi Eun-hee,

404
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:15,542
approached the US government
and sought assistance.

405
01:25:15,978 --> 01:25:17,277
We have given them assistance,

406
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,480
but I can't give you
anything further.

407
01:25:22,585 --> 01:25:24,418
<i>Dean S. Robinson:
 In Vienna, we would expect</i>

408
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,487
that any defector
that's going to walk in

409
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:29,656
is either an Eastern-bloc
military person,

410
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:33,127
an Eastern-bloc intelligence
officer or a diplomat.

411
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:36,830
<i>Film people from North Korea...</i>

412
01:25:37,867 --> 01:25:39,366
that's interesting. That's...

413
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:43,270
That's not something you see
very often on the radar.

414
01:25:43,272 --> 01:25:45,205
That's not what
you would expect.

415
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:50,043
<i> They spent considerable time,</i>

416
01:25:50,179 --> 01:25:52,713
<i> sitting down talking
to the intelligence authorities</i>

417
01:25:52,715 --> 01:25:57,184
<i> about every single aspect
 of that story.</i>

418
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:04,491
This story could sound funny,

419
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:07,394
if we were the suspicious
kind of people.

420
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:11,031
When I met Shin and Choi
for the first time,

421
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:15,903
they were so uneasy.
They were so ill at ease.

422
01:26:17,473 --> 01:26:20,674
<i> Some people said
 Choi was really kidnapped.</i>

423
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:24,945
But Shin was not kidnapped,
he walked into North Korea.

424
01:26:25,247 --> 01:26:27,881
That was a widespread story.

425
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:32,186
<i>Rissient: Everyone was convinced
 in South Korea</i>

426
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:35,055
that he had gone willingly.

427
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:36,690
For whatever it means,

428
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:40,194
every single person
at that time thought that.

429
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:44,331
(Kim Jong-il's
indistinct voice on tape)

430
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:49,269
On the tape,
Kim Jong-il confessed

431
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:53,874
that he had to kidnap
Shin and Choi

432
01:26:54,076 --> 01:26:55,542
to North Korea

433
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:58,445
to improve the North Korean
film business.

(speaking Japanese)

436
01:27:46,962 --> 01:27:49,496
The truth about the kidnap,
I think,

437
01:27:49,999 --> 01:27:54,801
unless there really is
a solid source in North Korea,

438
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:57,304
<i> a trustable source...</i>

439
01:27:58,874 --> 01:28:00,407
<i> I think we shall never know.</i>

440
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,581
Anyway, they were brought
to the United States.

441
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:12,319
The United States government
accepted their asylum

442
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:13,687
in the United States.
