1
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:52,487
那么，作为一名男模特最重要的方面是什么?
So, what are the most important aspects of being a male model?

2
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,445
我会说:看起来不错。
I would say: look good.

3
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,405
是吗?然后呢?
Yes? And?

4
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,972
-呃，就这样。-走!
- Er, that's it. - And walk!

5
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:03,411
长得好看还能走路?但不是同时，对吧?
Look good and walk? But not at the same time, right?

6
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:07,197
大多数时候都是在同一时间。——真的吗?你能做到吗?
Most of the times at the same time. - Really? Can you do that?

7
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:11,419
嗯,当然。-请给我们看看!是的，是的，请说。
Er, sure. - Please show us! Yes, yes, go ahead.

8
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:13,116
哇!是啊!
Whoo! Yeah!

9
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:21,385
谢谢你！下一个!
Thank you. Next!

10
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:25,346
好吧……你好，你好，你好。
Okay... Hello, hello, hello.

11
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:28,958
这里有什么?
What do we have here?

12
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,916
-嘿，你好。-怎么了，伙计?
- Hey, there. - What's up, man?

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,398
我想知道，你父母支持你做男模特吗?
So, I want to know, did your parents support you in being a male model?

14
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,357
从头到尾，从一开始。
All the way, right from the start.

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,534
-即使是你父亲?-就连我父亲也是为什么?
- Even your father? - Even my father, yeah. Why?

16
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:47,846
他想让你进入这个行业在这里你只能赚到三分之一的女人，在这里你必须不断地操纵那些想和你上床的同性恋男人?
He wanted you to enter this industry where you earn only 1/3 of the women, where you constantly have to maneuver homosexual men who want to sleep with you?

17
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,814
“我是刘易斯·泰勒，和我最好的朋友站在一起……”
'I'm Lewis Taylor, and I'm standing here with my very best friend...'

18
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,511
-你叫什么名字?-呃，卡尔。
- What was your name? - Er, Carl.

19
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:01,860
我最好的朋友卡尔!
My best friend Carl!

20
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:04,602
-你今天好吗，卡尔?-是啊，很好，很好。
- How are you today, Carl? - Yeah, good, good.

21
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:08,998
那么，这是一个脾气暴躁的品牌还是一个微笑的品牌?
So, is this runway casting for a grumpy brand or a smiley brand?

22
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,435
呃，我不知道，伙计。我不知道。
Er, I don't know, man. I don't know.

23
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:19,139
好吧，笑脸品牌是便宜的，品牌越贵，你就会开始看不起你的消费者。
Well, smiley brands are the cheap ones, and the more expensive the brand gets, you start to look down on your consumer.

24
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:24,666
如果你想成为"冯·奥本"的独行侠，你就得拿出足够的现金。
Like, if you want to be a part of this "von oben" one-man in-crowd, you have to show us some serious cash.

25
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,713
-所以这是一个脾气暴躁的牌子，是吗?——恭喜你!我真为你高兴!
- So it's a grumpy brand, yeah? - Congratulations! I'm so happy for you!

26
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:34,023
如果你得到了这份工作，你就可以穿专属的衣服，瞧不起你的顾客。
And if you get the job, you will get to wear exclusive clothing, and look down on your consumer.

27
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,156
好吧,卡尔。让我们看看你那暴躁的表情。
Okay, Carl. Show us some of that grumpy look.

28
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,810
-不，不…-是啊，走吧!
- No, no... - Yeah, let's go!

29
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,856
来吧，卡尔!你可以做到的。
Come on, Carl! You can do it.

30
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,165
是的!“你竟敢跟我说话!”
Yes! "Don't you dare talk to me!

31
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:53,477
"我是雅利安人'UÜbermensch'太沉迷于自我形象"不愿参与任何不符合我对这个世界程式化形象的事情"
"I'm an Aryan 'UÜbermensch', too obsessed with the image of myself "to be involved with anything that doesn't fit my stylized image of the world."

32
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:58,178
等……“突然间，我穿上了不那么贵的衣服。
Wait... "Suddenly, I'm dressed in something way less expensive.

33
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,918
“是H&M !”
"It's H&M!"

34
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,920
大家，一起来!
Everybody, come together!

35
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:12,496
“你也可以成为这个快乐的、微笑的、不同肤色的群体中的一员，”花不了那么多钱!♪友谊，♪人人平等，“#幸福生活，#阻止气候变化。”
"You can too be a part of this happy, smiling group of mixed skin colors, "for not that much money! ♪ Friendship, ♪everyonesequal, "#happylife, #stopclimatechange."

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,500
哦，不!哦!我很抱歉，亲爱的。
Oh, no! Oh! I am so sorry, darling.

37
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:20,504
我没看到你穿的是巴黎世家的衣服。
I didn't see that it was Balenciaga you're wearing.

38
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:23,507
“我们是强大的，坚韧的，不可接近的!”
"We are strong and tough and unapproachable!"

39
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:25,596
给我看看巴黎世家的造型!
Show me that Balenciaga look!

40
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:30,297
哦，不好意思，我想又回到H&M了!
Oh, I'm sorry, I think it's back to H&M again!

41
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,039
“是啊!我们只是在开玩笑。我们是如此廉价，我们是如此幸福!”
"Yeah! We're just kidding. We're so cheap, we're so happy!"

42
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,041
大家，靠近点!
Everybody, come closer together!

43
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:39,175
巴黎世家又回来了!哦，比以前更凶猛了!
Balenciaga is back! Ooh, fiercer than ever!

44
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,916
“我们冷得要死。
"We are stone cold.

45
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,397
“是啊!哦，我的上帝，离我们远点!”
"Yes! Oh, my God, get away from us!"

46
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,442
H&M又来了!
H&M is here again!

47
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:46,748
巴黎世家!
Balenciaga!

48
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,966
和H&M !
And H&M!

49
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,272
巴黎世家!
Balenciaga!

50
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,187
和H&M !
And H&M!

51
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,537
哦，各位，为他们鼓掌吧!
Oh, everybody, give it up for these guys!

52
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:56,671
令人难以置信的!令人难以置信的,卡尔!
Fabulous! Fabulous, Carl!

53
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:08,552
在这里……-嗨。- - - - - -你好。
Here... - Hi. - Hello.

54
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,641
你们还好吗?
How are you guys doing?

55
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,829
-哦，是你吗?-是的。
- Oh, it's you? - Yeah.

56
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:26,918
很难说是同一个人干的。
You can hardly tell it's the same guy.

57
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,442
这个香水广告有多久了?
How old is this perfume campaign?

58
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:31,358
是什么时候?呃，三年前。
When was it? Er, three years ago.

59
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:37,929
也许再过一年。-好吧…那你又选演员了?
And then maybe a year after that. - Okay... So you do castings again, then?

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,497
是的。
Yeah.

61
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,760
你能帮我们走一走吗?
Could you do a little walk for us?

62
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:46,721
呃…就快。没有微笑。没有停止。
Er... Just quick. No smiling. No stopping.

63
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,113
是的。
Yeah.

64
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,299
再来一次。
One more time.

65
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:04,478
好的。
Okay.

66
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:14,792
好吧……今天，时尚不仅仅是表面。这是关于内在的。
Okay... Today, fashion is not just about surface. It's about the inside.

67
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,969
想一首你走路时喜欢的曲子。
Think about a tune that you like when you walk.

68
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,623
看着我。
Look at me.

69
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:30,547
-你能做到吗?-是啊，有节奏吗?
- Can you do that? - Yeah, so like a rhythm?

70
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,419
是的。走吧!
Yeah. Go!

71
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:46,781
你能放松你的悲伤三角吗?
Can you relax your Triangle of Sadness?

72
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:50,567
就像在你的眉毛之间。——好的。
It's like between your eyebrows here. - Okay.

73
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:56,356
再多一点……好的。张开嘴，让你看起来更有亲和力。
A little bit more... Okay. And open your mouth so you look a little bit more available.

74
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,012
好吧，没那么多。稍微少一点。
Okay, not that much. A little bit less.

75
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,451
好的。非常感谢。
Okay. Thank you very much.

76
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:08,542
-谢谢。——谢谢。
- Thank you. - Thanks.

77
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,239
接下来,请!
Next, please!

78
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:19,030
——你好!-嗨。
- Hi! - Hi.

79
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:49,757
♪是啊，人造的力量，像塔一样矗立着♪越来越高，你好
♪ Yeah, man-made powers, Stood like a tower ♪ Higher and higher, hello

80
00:06:51,846 --> 00:07:02,987
♪走得越高，感觉越低，哦♪我…♬生而自由
♪ And the higher you go, you feel lower, oh ♪ I... was born free, born free ♪ Born free

81
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,157
-我可以坐哪儿?——对不起?
- Where can I sit? - Sorry?

82
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:29,509
我现在没有座位。-你能不能…?有个座位。
I don't have a seat now. - Can you just...? There's a seat.

83
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,250
就在上面。是的。就在那里。
Just right up there. Yeah. Just there.

84
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,169
亚亚!亚亚!
Yaya! Yaya!

85
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:29,351
雅雅，看这里。看这里，亚亚!
Yaya, look here. Look here, Yaya!

86
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:33,007
亚亚!
Yaya!

87
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,488
亚亚!
Yaya!

88
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,856
谢谢你，先生。
Thank you, sir.

89
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,654
谢谢你，亲爱的。
Thank you, honey.

90
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:14,004
你真贴心。
That's so sweet of you.

91
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,453
你喜欢这个地方吗?
Do you like the place?

92
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,891
-有点闷?-有点闷。
- A little stuffy? - A little stuffy.

93
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,639
什么?
What?

94
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,992
我不知道，你看起来好像在思考。
I don't know, you looked like you were thinking there.

95
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,776
不，我不是。我不是。
No, I'm not. I'm not.

96
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:50,214
酷。
Cool.

97
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:55,437
我能看出来有点不对劲。告诉我，到底怎么了?
I can tell there's something's wrong. Just talk to me, what is it?

98
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:10,931
不，只是…当你说…当你像那样说“谢谢你，亲爱的”……你让我别无选择，只能付钱。
No, it's just... When you say... When you say, "Thank you, honey" like that... You don't really give me an option but to pay.

99
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:15,936
这只是我的观察。这是我注意到的。
It was just an observation. Just something I've noticed.

100
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,424
如果你愿意，我们可以平分账单。-不，不…-我可以用计算器…-不，不，好吧
We can split the bill if you like. - No, no... - I can whip out a calculator... - No, no, okay.

101
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:31,429
你喝了多少杯酒?-哦，当然…-你好像还有三个。-我不是这个意思。
How many glasses of wine did you have? - Oh, sure... - You had, like, three more. - That's not what I mean.

102
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:33,910
是啊，我觉得都扯平了。
Yeah, I think it all evens out, you know.

103
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:44,399
嗯…你不记得昨晚了吗?你说过你会…你说你今天会付饭钱的。
Hmm... Don't you remember last night? You said you were gonna... You said you were gonna pay for food today.

104
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:49,926
在用餐结束时，你说:“谢谢。明天我就去取。”
At the end of the meal, you said, "Thanks. Tomorrow I'll get it."

105
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:56,822
当然，但后来你买单了，我以为你想付钱，所以我说"谢谢你，亲爱的"
Sure, but then you picked up the bill, and I thought you wanted to pay, so I said, "Thank you, honey."

106
00:11:56,846 --> 00:12:00,850
但它已经在那里很长时间了……-我没看到
But it was there for such a long time... - I didn't see it.

107
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:09,206
-你没看到吗?-我，呃…不，我没有。我没看到。
- You didn't see it? - I, er... No, I didn't. I didn't see it.

108
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,644
或者我没注意到。我们刚吃了顿好晚餐。
Or I didn't notice it. We were just having a nice dinner.

109
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:18,346
账单上桌的时候你没看到吗?
You didn't see the bill when it got put on the table?

110
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:20,391
不，我没有，卡尔。
No, I didn't, Carl.

111
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,750
于是服务员走了进来，把它放在桌子中间就在那里。
So the waiter came in, and put it in the middle of the table just there.

112
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,578
你没碰巧看到吗?-我的天啊!
And you didn't happen to see it? - Oh, my God!

113
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:41,891
什么?我现在很认真地问你，因为…哇……是什么……“哇”是什么?
What? I'm asking you seriously now, because... Wow... What's... What's "wow"?

114
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:48,245
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

115
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:51,814
不，不，不。只是不…等待。你能坐下吗?坐下来。
No, no, no. Just don't... Wait. Can you sit down? Sit down.

116
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:55,383
我只是想弄清楚我到底做错了什么!
I'm just trying to figure out what exactly I did wrong!

117
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:59,953
严重吗?-冷静点。请坐吧。
Seriously? - Calm down. Please, just sit down.

118
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:09,963
-你们在为钱吵架!——不!那不是…这就是正在发生的事情。-我只是想指出一个事实…你为什么对钱如此痴迷?-我没有痴迷。
- You're fighting over money! - No! That's not what's... That's literally what's happening. - I'm just pointing out the fact that... Why are you so obsessed with money? - I'm not obsessed.

119
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:13,270
你能坐下吗?我不迷恋金钱。
Can you just sit down, please? I'm not obsessed with money.

120
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:16,796
这只是昨天的观察。你能坐下吗?
It was just an observation from yesterday. Can you please sit down?

121
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:30,592
不，不，不……你在做什么?-没关系。
No, no, no... What are you doing? - It's fine.

122
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:35,771
你现在还不还钱，太荒唐了。
Well, you can't pay now, that's ridiculous.

123
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,295
-别这样，卡尔。-你在干什么?
- Don't, Carl. - What are you doing?

124
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,081
放手。-不，不，不…我来付帐。
Let go. - No, no, no... I'm paying the bill.

125
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:44,780
这不是我说这话的原因。
That's not why I said it.

126
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:50,917
对不起。-我们玩得开心吗?
Sorry. - Are we enjoying ourselves?

127
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:57,184
是的，谢谢。亚亚……-非常感谢。-谢谢。
Yes, thanks, yeah. Yaya... - Thank you very much. - Thank you.

128
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,462
现在我感觉很糟糕。
Now I feel bad.

129
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:17,073
为什么?我赚的钱比你多。
Why? I make more money than you.

130
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,914
原谅我。你的卡坏了。
Excuse me. Your card didn't work.

131
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,484
你还有别的吗?-你能再试一次吗?
Do you have another one, maybe? - Can you try it again, please?

132
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,704
我试了两次。
I tried it twice.

133
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,884
-对不起，我们不接受这个。就拿这个吧。
- I'm sorry, we don't accept that one. - - Just take this one.

134
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,103
卡尔!给我点时间。只是等待!
Carl! Just give me a second. Just wait!

135
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,192
-我来付钱。-等等!
- Let me pay. - Just wait!

136
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,417
没关系，你没有足够的现金。把这。
It's fine, you don't have enough cash. Take that.

137
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,550
-你接受吧?——是的。
- You accept that one, yeah? - Yes.

138
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,292
-谢谢。-非常感谢。
- Thank you. - Thanks so much.

139
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,150
谢谢你！
Thank you.

140
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:21,371
我确实认为这很疯狂，因为这是一件很难谈论的事情。
I do think it's quite crazy how it's such a hard thing to talk about.

141
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,983
钱。
Money.

142
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:30,467
这是一个非常敏感的话题。你不这么认为吗?
It's such a touchy subject. Don't you think?

143
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:33,514
是啊，我觉得谈论钱很不性感。
Yeah, I think it's un-sexy to talk about money.

144
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,175
好吧，那为什么呢?
Okay, but then why is that?

145
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,916
我不知道，这一点都不性感。
I don't know, it's just not sexy.

146
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,224
你不认为这是因为它与性别角色紧密相关吗?
Well, you don't think it's because it's so tied to gender roles?

147
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:52,663
该死的，餐厅的菜单上都没给你标价。
Fuckin' hell, the menu in the restaurant didn't even have prices for you.

148
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,752
这不公平，卡尔。
That's not fair, Carl.

149
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:59,018
我总是在付钱。-不，不，不，我们先把你弄走
I'm always paying. - No, no, no, let's take you out of it here.

150
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,629
我们只谈论女性。
And just talk about women in general.

151
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:06,242
我是个慷慨的人，卡尔。问问我的朋友吧。
I'm a generous person, Carl. Ask any of my friends.

152
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,507
当然你很慷慨，但是…
Sure you're generous, but...

153
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,295
但是呢?
But?

154
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:20,213
说到你和我，我们在处理我讨厌的角色。
When it comes to you and me, we're dealing with roles that I hate.

155
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:24,652
我不想当男人，而你是女人，我希望我们能成为最好的朋友。
I don't want to be the man, whilst you're the woman, I want us to be best friends.

156
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:33,530
我不想和我最好的朋友上床。-不，那不是…你不明白我想说什么。我的意思是……我们不应该只是陷入刻板的性别角色
I don't wanna sleep with my best friend. - No, that's not... You don't understand what I'm trying to say. I mean... We shouldn't just slip into the stereotypical gender-based roles

157
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,924
其他人似乎都在这么做。
that everyone else seems to be doing.

158
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,452
我希望我们平等。
I want us to be equal.

159
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,336
原谅我吗?
Excuse me?

160
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,295
-你必须战斗。-你说什么?
- You have to fight. - I'm sorry, what?

161
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,168
如果你爱她，就得为她而战。
If you love her, you have to fight for her.

162
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:04,083
我也经历过，我知道。
I've been there, I know.

163
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,998
如果你不战斗，你就会成为她的奴隶。
If you don't fight, you're gonna be her slave.

164
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,048
问题是，雅雅，我想请你吃饭。我很乐意为你付钱。
The thing is, Yaya, I like to take you for dinner. I enjoy paying for you.

165
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,007
但到了某个时候，我确实觉得自己被利用了。
But there comes a point where I do feel used.

166
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,401
我利用你?
I use you?

167
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:27,715
我只是在说我现在的感受，但当然，如果我们…不,不。只是等待。如果我们回到上周左右，那么，是的，也许有一个点…你是认真的吗?
Well, I'm just referring to my feelings now, but sure, if we... No, no. Just wait. If we go back the last week or so, then, yeah, maybe there is a point... Are you being serious?

168
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,978
我给你买了这件衬衫。我邀请你来吃晚饭。
I got you this shirt. I invited you for dinner.

169
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:33,590
你住在我的酒店。-你可以免费得到这件衬衫。
You're staying at my hotel. - Well, you got this shirt for free.

170
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:37,855
而且你还没付晚餐的钱。-那是因为我的卡坏了。
And actually you didn't pay for dinner. - That's because my card didn't work.

171
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:43,078
大厅里有自动提款机。我会把每一分钱都还给你的。没关系。
There's a cash machine in the lobby. I'll pay you back every last cent... It's okay.

172
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,949
卡尔，我一直想还你钱。
Carl, I always intended to pay you back.

173
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:49,128
睡觉前我没意识到你现在就想要钱。
I didn't realize you wanted the money right now before going to bed.

174
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,784
所以你的目的是报复我?——是的。
So your intention was to pay me back? - Yes.

175
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,483
——真的吗?-是的。
- Really? - Yeah.

176
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:59,138
那你为什么要拿那张50欧元的钞票?
So why did you take the 50-euro bill?

177
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,230
当我意识到你没有足够的现金时，我就付了帐。
Once I realized you didn't have enough cash, I paid the bill.

178
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:08,016
你没有给我50欧元的钞票，而是把它放回了你的钱包。
Instead of giving me the 50-euro bill, you put it back in your purse.

179
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,802
什么?我只是说说发生了什么，雅雅。
What? I'm just saying what happened, Yaya.

180
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,501
你在说什么?不!
What are you...? Don't!

181
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:19,201
你他妈在干什么?
What the fuck are you doing?

182
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,725
别他妈这么对我!
Don't fucking do that to me!

183
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,989
不要……对我下手，亚亚!
Don't... fucking do that to me, Yaya!

184
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:27,514
别这样对我!
Don't do that to me!

185
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:30,517
的下降。-别他妈往我身上塞东西!
'Going down.' - Don't fucking shove things down me!

186
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,365
-你这该死的孩子!-认真…你的行为就像个疯子。
- You fucking child! - Seriously... You're behaving like a crazy person.

187
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,217
闭嘴!别对我做那样的事!
Shut up! Don't do things like that to me!

188
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,001
你拿我的钱干什么?
What the hell are you doing with my money?

189
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:40,657
你的钱?我的天啊!这不是钱的问题，雅雅!
Your money? Oh, my God! It's not about money, Yaya!

190
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,224
这不是关于…
It's not about...

191
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:47,534
这他妈的不是钱的问题，亚亚!
It's not about the fucking money, Yaya!

192
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,405
——哦!-这是…不，不是的!
- Oh! - This is... No, it's not!

193
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:52,234
你不明白我的意思!这不是钱的问题!
You're not understanding the point! It's not about the money!

194
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,932
我给你50欧元!我给你100欧元!
I'll give you that 50 euros! I'll give you a 100 euros!

195
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,152
-是吗?——不!我现在是认真的!
- Oh, yeah? - No! I'm serious now!

196
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,937
这他妈的不是钱的问题!你为什么不明白?
This is not about the fucking money! Why won't you understand it?

197
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,201
理解我的观点吧!
Understand my point!

198
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:05,073
这不是钱的问题!
This is not about the money!

199
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:09,077
-我的天啊。好吧,好吧。-我要平等，雅雅!
- Oh, my God. Okay, okay. - I want it to be equal, Yaya!

200
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:13,908
我以为他可能很危险，但他看起来就像……
Thought he might be dangerous, but he just looked like...

201
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,480
废话女权主义者。
Bullshit feminist.

202
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,654
妈的……
For fuck's...

203
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:21,383
-你在做什么?-想睡在椅子上。
- What have you been doing? - Trying to sleep on a chair.

204
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:24,430
-怎么样?-我回来了。
- How'd that go? - Well, I'm back.

205
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,043
你一直在做什么?
What have you been doing?

206
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:39,270
我是……在走廊里走来走去……-给你发了很多次短信。-嗯，很多…-你看到他们了?-是的。
I was... walking up and down the corridor and... - Texting you multiple times. - Hmm, a lot... - You saw them? - Yeah.

207
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,669
-这太蠢了。-是的。
- This is so silly. - Yeah.

208
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:54,416
我…很擅长做…操纵。
I'm... so good at being... manipulative.

209
00:22:56,462 --> 00:23:00,291
我不知道，我做了，我甚至没有意识到我在做。
I don't know, I do it and I don't even realize that I'm doing it.

210
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,425
-是的…-我爱你。
- Yeah... - I love you.

211
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,430
不，但说真的，你能告诉我这些真是太棒了。
No, but seriously, it's amazing that you can tell me that.

212
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,476
现在你是一个慷慨的人。
Now you're a generous person.

213
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,609
好的。
Okay.

214
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,264
好吧。
Alright.

215
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:24,751
问我任何问题。
Ask me anything.

216
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,579
你确定吗?
You sure?

217
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:27,928
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

218
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:35,544
在餐馆里，拿着账单……怎么了?
In the restaurant, with the bill... What about it?

219
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:38,721
你是故意不接的，对吧?
You intentionally didn't pick that up, right?

220
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,419
——是的。-当然。
- Yes. - Of course.

221
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,425
你不觉得尴尬吗?
Didn't that embarrass you?

222
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,731
不。
Nope.

223
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:52,885
但你赚的钱比我多。-这不是钱的问题
But you make more money than I do. - It's not about the money.

224
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:54,911
你说你会付钱的…
And you said you were gonna pay...

225
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,617
谁赚的钱更多并不重要。
It doesn't really matter who makes more money.

226
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,749
那是关于什么的呢?
What is it about, then?

227
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:12,494
如果我…秋天怀孕吗?
What if I... fall pregnant?

228
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:13,974
和我在一起吗?
With me?

229
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:20,110
如果我怀孕了，不能继续工作怎么办?
What if I fall pregnant and I can't go on working?

230
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:23,679
我需要知道和我在一起的人是有意照顾我的。
I need to know that the person I'm with intends to take care of me.

231
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:25,725
否则我就是在浪费时间。
Otherwise I'm wasting my time.

232
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:35,299
是啊，我猜你不适合在…是餐厅还是超市，是吗?
Yeah, I guess you're not the kind to work in... a restaurant or a supermarket, are you?

233
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:37,476
没有进攻。
No offense.

234
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:43,699
亲爱的，我是个模特，唯一能让我摆脱这种生活的方法就是成为别人的花瓶妻子。
I'm a model, honey, the only way for me to get out of this life is to become someone's trophy wife.

235
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:48,008
你就没别的事了吗?
So, there's nothing else to this for you?

236
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:55,450
除了……增加我们Instagram上的粉丝，等等。
Other than... increasing the followers on our Instagram, and all of that.

237
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,974
-有道理，不是吗?——确定。
- It make sense, doesn't it? - Sure.

238
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,847
我喜欢你。你喜欢我。这对生意有好处。
I like you. You like me. It's good for business.

239
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,152
是的。
Yeah.

240
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,068
-没有别的了?——嗯。。
- Nothing more? - Uh-hmm.

241
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,940
——嗯。?——嗯。。
- Uh-hmm? - Uh-hmm.

242
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:11,422
我想打个赌。
I'd like to put a bet on that.

243
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,816
好的。
Okay.

244
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,645
——交易。-是的。
- Deal. - Yeah.

245
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,346
我们将会看到。
We'll see.

246
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,611
我会让你爱我。
I'll make you love me.

247
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:29,353
-那也是真爱-是吗?
- It'll be real love as well. - Oh, yeah?

248
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,617
——是的。——好的。
- Yep. - Okay.

249
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,271
你会忘记这个奖杯的。
You'll forget about this trophy shit.

250
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,882
你会爱我的。
And you'll love me.

251
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:36,464
“豪华邮轮的成功主要取决于两个时刻。
'The success of a luxury cruise mainly depends on two moments.

252
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,034
第一:客人刚上船的头几个小时。
'Number one: the first hours the guests are on board.

253
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:45,125
“第二件事:客人上船的最后一天。
'And number two: the last day the guests are on board.

254
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:51,610
如果我们能在这两个场合给他们留下深刻印象，那么这次巡游很可能会成功
'And if we can impress them on those two occasions, 'then the cruise will probably be a success.'

255
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:59,356
我不想听到任何人说，“我们不需要揭开日光浴台，他们吃完早饭就走。”
And I don't want to hear anybody saying, "We don't need to uncover the sundeck, they all leave after breakfast."

256
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,491
不。我要每天早上都准备好。
No. I want full set-up every morning.

257
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:04,927
没有借口。
No excuses.

258
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:08,061
哪怕是最后一个小时。
Not even for the last hour.

259
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,066
他们总是说:“是的，先生!是的,女士!”
It's always, "Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

260
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:18,114
如果他们想要非法物质，或者……独角兽!
If there is an illegal substance they want, or... a unicorn!

261
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:20,464
“是的,先生!是的,女士!”
"Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

262
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,031
——是的!——哇!
- Yes! - Whoo!

263
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:24,599
是的!
Yes!

264
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:29,038
我知道，我知道为别人服务是什么感觉。
I know, I know what it is to work for service.

265
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:31,606
我知道你面临的所有挑战。
I know all the challenges you're facing.

266
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,480
但在这种时候，我请求你保持乐观。
But at these times, I ask of you to keep that chin up.

267
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:40,223
保持强劲。
Stay strong.

268
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:57,371
试着提醒自己……如果一切顺利……在邮轮的最后…-钱，钱，钱…-你可能会…——非常慷慨的小费!-钱，钱，钱…
And try to remind yourself... if everything goes well... at the end of the cruise... - Money, money, money... - you might be getting... - a very generous tip! - Money, money, money...

269
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,944
钱!钱!钱!
Money! Money! Money!

270
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:08,556
钱!钱!钱!钱!钱!
Money! Money! Money! Money! Money!

271
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,435
——钱!——是的!
- Money! - Yes!

272
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:20,916
艾丽西娅，我们这边有谁?
Alicia, who do we have on board?

273
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:25,747
不…
No...

274
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:31,927
——管家!——没有。不用了，谢谢。
- Housekeeping! - No. No, thank you.

275
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:36,802
你要我打扫房间吗?-不用了，谢谢。
Do you want me to clean the room? - No, thanks.

276
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:39,065
好的，我30分钟后回来?
Okay, I'll come back in 30 minutes?

277
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:42,068
不，你可以过一会儿再来。-好吧，一小时?
No, you can come back a bit later. - Okay, one hour?

278
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:44,548
你能过会儿再来吗?
Could you just come back later, please?

279
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:47,682
好的，我过会儿再来。对不起,女士。
Okay, I'll come back later. Sorry, ma'am.

280
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,432
让我换一下。
Let me change.

281
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,202
什么?
What?

282
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:14,595
什么都没有。
Nothing.

283
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:21,123
——嘿!-嗨。
- Hey! - Hey.

284
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,219
-你在干什么?——什么?
- What are you doing? - What?

285
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:39,925
-你在和船员说话吗?-是的…你为什么要和船员说话?-我说了你好。
- Are you talking to the crew? - Yeah... Why are you talking to the crew? - I said hello.

286
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:42,318
是啊，你冲他笑着打招呼。
Yeah, you smiled at him and said hello.

287
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,452
——所以呢?——啊……
- So? - Ah...

288
00:30:56,942 --> 00:31:02,382
说真的，雅雅，我们坐在一起，你不应该…-你不能这么做。-做什么?
Seriously, Yaya, we're sitting here together, you shouldn't... - You just don't do that. - Do what?

289
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:10,259
如果我开始对性感的空姐微笑，然后…-你知道…-你觉得她很性感?
If I started smiling at the hot stewardess and... - You know... - You think she's hot?

290
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:21,140
不，但如果她是，我开始对她微笑，咯咯笑着说"嘿"就像你做的那样，那你就不会喜欢了，对吧?
No, but if she was, and I started smiling at her, and giggling and saying, "Hey," like you did, then you wouldn't like it, would you?

291
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,012
-你吃醋了?——没有。
- Are you jealous? - No.

292
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,885
没有?-不，我没有。我不是。就像……
No? - No, I'm not. I'm not. It's just like...

293
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:36,459
我是说，拜托，看看你。然后……然后一个帅哥出现了。我是说，他不应该…你觉得他帅吗?
I mean, come on, look at you. And then... And then a hot guy turns up. I mean, he shouldn't be... Do you think he's hot?

294
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:38,984
他是好的。
He's alright.

295
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,335
-是吗?——是的!
- Do you? - Yeah!

296
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:46,426
搞什么，伙计?-你刚说你觉得他很性感!
What the fuck, man? - You just said you thought he was hot!

297
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:50,473
但拜托，你没必要……你说得很快。耶稣!
But come on, you don't have to... You said it very quickly. Jesus!

298
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:54,173
放下它，好吗?
Drop it, okay?

299
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,878
先生，我能为您效劳吗?
Can I help you, sir?

300
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,880
-不好意思，快说…——是吗?
- Sorry, just quickly... - Yes?

301
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:54,755
我在后甲板，你的一个船员…——赤裸上身。——真的吗?
I was on the rear deck, and one of your crew members was... - bare-chested. - Really?

302
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:56,626
是啊，还有抽烟之类的。
Yeah, and like smoking and stuff.

303
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,715
哦，我很抱歉。这太不合适了。
Oh, I'm so sorry. That's so inappropriate.

304
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,588
是啊，确实感觉有点…-不，当然。
Yeah, it did feel a little bit... - No, of course.

305
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,459
我会处理的。我很抱歉。
I'll take care of that. I'm so sorry.

306
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:06,158
-也许这不是什么大问题…-不，但在这里是不能接受的。
- Maybe it's not a big issue... - No, but it's not acceptable here.

307
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,311
我想我应该告诉你，因为…是啊，我不想把它当回事。
I thought I'd just let you know, cos... Yeah, I didn't wanna make anything of it.

308
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:11,467
好吧，非常感谢。这种事不会再发生了，先生。
Well, thank you so much. It won't happen again, sir.

309
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,513
-我向你保证-好的，谢谢。
- I promise you that. - Alright, thanks.

310
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:16,298
——艾丽西亚?——是吗?

And we have a point nine diamond in the middle, and we have four brilliants on every side of the band.

十万头猪，两百万只鸡。

因为这里很危险。
Because it's very dangerous around here.

494
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:52,059
问题是，你丈夫付给我很多钱。
The thing is, your husband pays me a lot of money, you see.

495
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:57,412
所以，我必须确保我正确地完成了我的工作。
So, I do have to just make sure I'm doing my job properly.

你确定你是这份工作的合适人选吗?
You're sure you're the right guy for the job?

499
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,912
我是，我是。我很有资格。
I am, I am. I'm very qualified.

500
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,088
嗯…让我看看。
Hmm... Let me see.

501
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,948
你知道人们临终时后悔什么吗?
Do you know what people regret on their deathbed?

502
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,602
你能把电话转一下吗?
Can you turn the phone?

503
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,256
——没有。——不是吗?
- No. - No?

504
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:05,785
他们工作得太多了，十分之七的人后悔把自己的生命浪费在愚蠢和毫无意义的工作上。
That they were working too much, seven out of ten people regret throwing away their lives on stupid and pointless jobs.

505
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:11,356
-要喝点什么吗?请再来点香槟。
- Can I get you anything to drink? - - More champagne, please.

506
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:15,969
我不知道，我生来就是这样的。这不是我的错。
I don't know, I was just born into this life. It was not my fault.

507
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:20,713
当这一切发生的时候，我…我只是想:“为什么?为什么?”
And when this happened, I... I just felt like, "Why? Why?"

508
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:24,151
-生活太不公平了。-是的。
- Life is so unfair. - Yeah.

509
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:26,806
我们都是平等的。
We are all equal.

510
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:29,678
-那是真的。-人人平等。
- That is so true. - Everyone's equal.

511
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,864
你有什么愿望吗?
Is there anything you wish for?

512
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:47,653
抱歉?-你有什么…希望吗?
Sorry? - Is there anything you... wish for?

513
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:51,961
嗯…嗯，我不知道。
Well... Well, I don't know.

514
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,879
你真是太好了，夫人，但我很好。
That's so sweet of you, madam, but I'm perfectly fine.

515
00:50:56,923 --> 00:51:07,281
但是，但是，但是，但是如果今天是你活着的最后一天…嗯…你有什么愿望?-我不知道。
But, but, but, but if today was your last day alive... hmm... what would you wish for? - I have no idea.

516
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:12,721
你今天去游泳了吗?-不，今天不行。
Have you been for a swim today? - No, not today.

517
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:16,986
你为什么现在不去游泳呢?
Why don't you go for a swim right now?

518
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:22,296
因为这就是我说的。
Because this is exactly what I'm talking about.

519
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:31,436
夫人，您真是太好了，但不幸的是，工作时间我们不允许去游泳，所以……我要所有的员工都去游泳!
That's so kind of you, madam, but unfortunately we're not allowed to go for a swim during working hours, so... I want all the staff to go for a swim!

520
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:34,613
我要你们都去游泳!
I want you all to go for a swim!

521
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:39,835
我真的觉得我有过这样的时刻。
I really feel that I've had one of these moments.

522
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:45,276
是啊，今天可能有点问题…有问题吗?
Yeah, well, today might be a little bit problematic... Problematic?

523
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,147
因为今天我们有船长晚宴。
Cos today we have the Captain's Dinner.

524
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:51,456
谁在乎船长晚宴?这只需要半个小时。
Who cares about the Captain's Dinner? This will only take half an hour.

525
00:51:51,499 --> 00:51:53,458
来吧，现在。
Come on, now.

526
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:55,764
你太努力了，加油。
You work too hard, come on.

527
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:00,682
好吧，让我看看我能做些什么。——谢谢!
Yeah, well, let me see what I can do. - Merci!

528
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,174
不，不，不!回来!请回来。
No, no, no! Come back! Come back, please.

529
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:17,786
请回来。我有个更好的主意。
Please come back. I have a better idea.

530
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:20,659
-坐下。——好的。
- Sit down. - Okay.

531
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:25,185
让我们互换角色。
Let's reverse roles.

532
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:28,406
——对不起?-只是换个角色。
- Sorry? - Just change roles.

533
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:34,586
你……在按摩浴缸里放松一下，我去叫船长。
You... chillax in the jacuzzi, and I'll get the captain.

534
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:40,113
哦……嗯…来吧!活在当下，就像我以前一样。拜托!
Oh... well... Come on! Just be in the moment, like I was. Please!

535
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,594
是的,但是……-来吧，来吧，我知道你想。
Yeah, but... - Come, come, I know you want to.

536
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:50,036
-来吧!-是的，但是…但对我来说可能会有问题，如果我…现在我得成为权威了。
- Come on! - Yes, I do but... But there might be a problem for me, if I... Now I have to be the authority.

537
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,778
好吧，我已经穿好衣服了…-闭嘴，闭嘴，闭嘴!
Yeah, well, I have my clothes on... - Shut up, shut up, shut up!

538
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:54,388
闭嘴!现在!
Shut up! Now!

539
00:52:56,564 --> 00:53:00,177
我命令你，享受这一刻!
I command you, enjoy the moment!

540
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:05,704
——现在?——请。
- N-now? - Please.

541
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:12,101
——没有。——不是吗?
- No. - No?

542
00:53:12,145 --> 00:53:14,060
——没有。——什么?
- No. - What?

543
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:17,019
-你拒绝我了?——没有。不!
- You say "no" to me? - No. No!

544
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:18,717
-这么说你同意了?-是的…不。
- So it's "yes"? - Yes... No.

545
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:31,033
-“是”还是“不是”?-我是说…抱歉，我是说，n…我说的…——是的。——是的!哈哈!
- "Yes" or "no"? - I'm saying... Sorry, I'm saying, n... I'm saying... - Yes. - Yes! Ha-ha!

546
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:34,254
别担心。迪米特里奥斯会买下游艇。
Don't worry. Dimitrios will buy the yacht.

547
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,387
来吧!坐下，坐下。
Come on! Sit down, sit down.

548
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,520
-好吧，我要进去了-快，快，快…是的!
- Okay, I'm going in. - Quick, quick, quick... Yes!

549
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,093
-这位了不起的小姐…——艾丽西亚。
- This wonderful Miss... - Alicia.

550
00:53:58,278 --> 00:54:00,933
大流士吗?我需要你的帮助。
Darius? I need your help.

551
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:05,067
我需要你告诉一位客人船员不能去游泳。
I need you tell one of the guests that the crew can't go for a swim.

552
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:06,634
为什么?
Why?

553
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:11,596
我告诉他们因为晚餐的事不可能了，但他们想亲自听队长说。
Well, I told them it's not possible because of the dinner, but they want to hear it from the captain in person.

554
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:14,338
所以我去了托马斯的小屋，敲了敲门，他不在。
So I went to Thomas' cabin, I knocked on it, he's not there.

555
00:54:14,381 --> 00:54:19,362
他没有回应。我联系不到他，所以…你能去告诉他们这是不可能的吗?
He's not responding. I can't get a hold of him, so... Could you just please go and tell them it's not possible?

556
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:22,607
-那就帮大忙了。-你就不能去游泳吗?
- That would be a big help. - Can't you just go for a swim?

557
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:31,093
不。我的意思是，那是最简单的，但他们想让我们从水滑梯走……这一点都不好笑。你笑什么，埃里克?
No. I mean, that would be the easiest, but they want us to go from the water slide and... It's not even funny. Why are you laughing, Erik?

558
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:33,487
-你怎么会在这?-我在休息。
- Why are you even here? - I'm on my break.

559
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:36,273
你的休息时间结束了。回去工作吧。
Well, your break is over. Go back to work.

560
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:39,885
还没安装呢，要花很长时间，我没那么多时间。
It's not even installed yet, it will take forever, and I don't have that time.

561
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:42,975
厨师已经开始做饭了，我需要准备时间。
The chef has started the dinner, I need the prep-time.

562
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:47,240
所以请去告诉他们这是不可能的…我才不要去和那些疯狂的俄罗斯人说话。
So please go and tell them it's not possible... I'm not going to go and talk to some crazy Russians.

563
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,677
不是疯狂的俄罗斯人，是非常富有的俄罗斯人。
It's not crazy Russians, it's very rich Russians.

564
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:50,939
同样的事情。
Same thing.

565
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:55,509
先去解决这个问题，然后……不!我们做完了。
Go and solve this problem first, and then... No! We're done.

566
00:54:55,553 --> 00:55:01,385
-你为什么不这么做?-去游泳吧。耶稣…-你好，先生!- - - - - -你好。
- Why won't you do this? - Go and take a swim. Jesus... - Hello, sir! - Hello.

567
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:05,171
-需要帮忙吗?-我只是看看。
- Can I help you? - I was just looking.

568
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:07,347
-你想看看桥吗?-如果可能的话。
- You want to see the bridge? - If possible.

569
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:11,308
当然。我去叫大副。他现在什么都没做。
Of course. I can get the First Officer. He's not doing anything right now.

570
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,789
你可以带客人参观这座桥吗?-是的，当然。
Could you show the guest the bridge? - Yes, of course.

571
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,661
欢迎来到桥上。
Welcome to the bridge.

572
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:19,838
我大流士。很高兴认识你。
I'm Darius. Nice to meet you.

573
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:33,982
托马斯?
Thomas?

574
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:39,336
托马斯?喂?
Thomas? Hello?

575
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,910
-下午好。-下午好。
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

576
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:54,089
——实际上……我有一个问题。-是的，当然。
- Actually... I have a question. - Yes, of course.

577
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:57,354
昨天，我在露天平台上。
Yesterday, I was up on the sundeck.

578
00:55:57,397 --> 00:56:00,444
阳光明媚，一切都很完美。
And the sun was shining, everything was perfect.

579
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:02,837
但我又看了看船帆。
But then I looked at the sails.

580
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:04,796
-帆?——是的。
- The sails? - Yes.

581
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,451
他们……有点脏。
And they were... a bit dirty.

582
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:09,844
——哦!-是的。
- Oh! - Yeah.

583
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:11,716
-哦…-是的。
- Oh... - Yeah.

584
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,377
喂?
Hello?

585
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:22,683
嗨。
Hi.

586
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:30,517
是啊，但你知道这里的食物会很难吃吗?
Yeah, but do you realize the food down here is going to be bad?

587
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:33,477
好吧,再见。
Okay, bye.

588
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:37,394
好了，伙计们，听着。你要去游泳。
Okay, guys, listen up. You are going to swim.

589
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:42,573
所以，带上你的泳裤，尽快去主甲板，好吗?
So, bring your swimming pants, and go to the main deck as quick as possible, okay?

590
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:46,751
来吧!切,切!你要去滑水。
Come on! Chop, chop! You're going to water slide.

591
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:48,405
玩得开心!
Have fun!

592
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:32,013
托马斯?
Thomas?

593
00:57:38,716 --> 00:57:40,108
托马斯?
Thomas?

594
00:57:44,112 --> 00:57:45,810
“下午好。
'Good afternoon.

595
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:52,294
我希望到目前为止，大家都度过了愉快的一天，也希望你们期待着今晚的船长晚宴。
'I hope that everyone has had a great day so far, 'and that you're looking forward to the Captain's Dinner tonight.

596
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:56,647
“我们想通知您，我们的日程有轻微的变化。
'We would like to inform you that we have a slight change in the schedule.

597
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:03,088
“船长晚宴将在8:30举行”，而不是像每日节目上说的那样在8:00举行。
'The Captain's Dinner will be held at 8:30, 'and not at 8:00, as it says on the daily program.

598
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:07,179
“我再说一遍，船长晚宴将在八点半举行。
'I repeat: the Captain's Dinner will be held at 8:30.

599
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,441
“谢谢你。”
'Thank you.'

600
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,443
为什么要这么做?
Why the push?

601
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,185
因为剧组要去…游泳。
Cos the crew's going for a... a swim.

602
00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:16,841
是一个俄国人的要求。
It's a request from one of the Russians.

603
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:22,324
-从水滑梯上。-我的天啊!我得看看这个。
- From the water slide. - Oh, my God! This I gotta see.

604
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:24,718
哇,哇!你想先换衣服吗?
Whoa, whoa! Do you want to change first?

605
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:28,505
-哦，亚历山德拉!你好吗?——艾丽西亚。
- Oh, Alessandra! How are you? - Alicia.

606
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:31,203
艾尔……?-你能离开我们一会儿吗?
Al...? - Can you leave us for a bit, please?

607
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,987
我们进去吧，好吗?
Let's go inside, yeah?

608
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:41,518
我认为你需要改变，如果你想向上…是的,是的……-我们进去谈谈。-不，不…你没事吧，伙计?
I think you need to change if you wanna go up... Yeah, yeah... - Let's go inside and talk. - No, no... Are you okay, man?

609
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,521
——好。——是吗?
- Good. - Yeah?

610
00:58:45,913 --> 00:58:48,786
非常好。-我们还有四个半小时。
Very good. - We have four and a half hours left.

611
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,788
直到船长晚宴。
Until the Captain's Dinner.

612
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:54,139
你在你的房间里放松一下，打个盹。我过几个小时就回来。
You chill in your room, have little nap. I'll be back in a couple of hours.

613
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:56,402
我们会…一起去。
And we'll... go together.

614
00:58:56,445 --> 00:58:58,447
是吗?
Yeah?

615
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:05,498
大流士……看看你!
Darius... Look at you!

616
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:10,547
你为什么这么激动?我很好!完全没问题。
What are you all worked up about? I'm fine! Just totally fine.

617
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:17,292
是吗?-完全的，百分之百的…很好。
Yeah? - Completely, a hundred percent... fine.

618
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:21,645
-默罕默德!默罕默德!——什么?
- Mohammed! Mohammed! - What?

619
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:23,603
来了!我们走吧!来了,来了!
Come! Let's go! Come, come!

620
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:26,693
——什么?-我们走!
- What? - Let's go!

621
00:59:28,347 --> 00:59:30,392
哦!哇!
Oh! Whoo!

622
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,570
太棒了!
Wonderful!

623
00:59:37,443 --> 00:59:39,663
-来点香槟。——万岁!
- Some champagne. - Bravo!

624
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:51,936
我们玩得开心吗?是的!
Are we enjoying ourselves? Yes!

625
01:00:30,888 --> 01:00:33,978
如果你站在这里，他们就会来找你。
If you just stand here, and they will be coming to you.

626
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:37,503
——好的。-让我看看你。好的。
- Okay. - Let me see you. Okay.

627
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:41,681
——好吧!-谢谢你，宝拉。

628
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:44,075
-就一个晚上，就这样——好的。
- Just one night, that's all. - Okay.

629
01:00:45,293 --> 01:00:48,906
大流士，你能站在他旁边吗?只是为了确保……
Darius, could you stand next to him? Just to make sure...

630
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:56,783
——好吗?你准备好了吗?-谢谢。
- Okay? You're ready? - Thank you.

631
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:58,306

632
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:02,267
好了，我们准备开门吧。
Okay, let's get ready to open the doors.

633
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:04,748
等我信号开门，好吗?
Open on my signal, yes?

634
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:08,055
和…走了。
And... go.

635
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,192
晚上好。
Good evening.

636
01:01:14,235 --> 01:01:16,411
欢迎参加船长晚宴。-谢谢。

637
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:19,414

Would you like a glass of champagne? - Thank you very much.

638
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:22,330
晚上好。欢迎参加船长晚宴。
Good evening. Welcome to the Captain's Dinner.

639
01:01:22,374 --> 01:01:23,941
嗨……这就跟你问声好！
Hi... Hi!

640
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:26,770
晚上好。享受你的巡航吗?
Good evening. Enjoying your cruise?

641
01:01:28,206 --> 01:01:30,425
——欢迎。-你好，女士。
- Welcome. - Hello, ma'am.

642
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:32,906
很高兴认识你。祝您用餐愉快。
Nice to meet you. Enjoy your dinner.

643
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:37,432
哦，你好，女士。你好吗?
Oh, hello, ma'am. How are you?

644
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:39,434
祝您用餐愉快。
Enjoy your dinner.

645
01:01:39,478 --> 01:01:41,828
希望天气不会太恶劣。
Hope the weather's not too rough on you.

646
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:45,049
-你好，先生-你好
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

647
01:01:45,092 --> 01:01:46,659
——欢迎。-谢谢。
- Welcome. - Thank you.

648
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,792
很高兴认识你。祝您用餐愉快。
Nice to meet you. Enjoy your dinner.

649
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:53,710
你好，先生-晚上好。Jarmo Bjoorkman……我有一个问题。我很抱歉。
Hello, sir. - Good evening. Jarmo Bjoörkman... I have a question. I'm sorry.

650
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:58,279
-昨天我在甲板上。——是的。
- Yesterday, I was up on deck. - Yes.

651
01:01:58,323 --> 01:02:01,935
它是如此美丽。一切都很美妙。
And it was so beautiful. Everything was fantastic.

652
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:04,111
但就在这时，我看到了帆。
But then, I saw the sails.

653
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,766
帆吗?
The sails?

654
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:11,945
-是的，帆。-哦…是的。它们是灰白色的。
- The sails, yes. - Oh... Yeah. And they were dirt-gray.

655
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:15,732
你觉得可以洗吗?
Do you think it's possible to wash them?

656
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:23,174
我不认为那是可能的，夫人，因为…-这是一艘摩托化船只。-是的。
Well, I don't think that's possible, ma'am, because, er... - this is a motorized vessel. - Yeah.

657
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:25,611
所以，我们没有帆。
So, we don't have any sails.

658
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:31,182
也许是因为露天平台的屋顶?
Maybe it was the sundeck roof?

659
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:35,969
——嗯…你确定吗?-我确定。
- Well... Are you sure? - I'm sure.

660
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:54,205
是的。他答应了。
Yes. He says yes.

661
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:56,381
-是帆。-马格努斯同意了。
- It was sails. - Magnus says yes.

662
01:02:56,424 --> 01:02:57,599
是的。
Yes.

663
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:05,869
耶稣基督……好吧，那样的话，我们就把帆擦干净。
Jesus Christ... Well, then, in that case, we will clean the sails.

664
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:09,002
——是的。-当然。
- Yes. - Of course.

665
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:14,878
我相信我们能帮你找到解决办法。我相信……-我送您到餐桌好吗?——好的。
I'm sure we can find a solution for you. I'm sure... - Can I escort you to a table? - Okay.

666
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:17,010
-祝您用餐愉快。-谢谢。
- Enjoy your dinner. - Thank you.

667
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:20,405
嗯…Jarmo Bjoorkman。我坐在你的桌子上。
Well... Jarmo Bjoörkman. I'm sitting at your table.

668
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:22,624
——哦!好,好。-你好，杰莫。
- Oh! Good, good. - Hello, Jarmo.

669
01:03:22,668 --> 01:03:24,409
你也坐在船长那桌吗?
Are you also sitting at the captain's table?

670
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:25,540
是的，我是。
Yes, I am.

671
01:03:25,584 --> 01:03:28,152
-是这个吗?——是的。去做吧。
- Is it this one? - Yes. Go ahead.

672
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:29,849
哦,上帝……
Oh, Lord...

673
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,777
与其说是应用程序，不如说是代码。
It's not so much apps as code.

674
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:54,656
我为应用程序编写代码。所以你可以编程…所以，我把我的代码和技能卖给不同的科技公司。
I create code for apps. So you can program... So, I sell my codes and my skills to different tech companies.

675
01:03:56,223 --> 01:04:01,838
然后，游戏开发者向我传达想法。
And then, the game makers are pitching ideas to me.

676
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:03,622
先生。
Sir.

677
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:09,367
晚上好。
So, good evening.

678
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:14,851
今晚的第一餐，我们将为您奉上美味的牡蛎配黑俄罗斯鱼子酱。
For tonight's first meal, we will be serving you some delicious oysters with some black Russian caviar.

679
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:17,723
-请慢用。-谢谢。
- Please enjoy. - Thank you.

680
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:27,341
我们喜欢食物吗?-是的，非常喜欢。
Are we enjoying the food? - Yes, very much.

681
01:04:35,828 --> 01:04:38,309
你们在一起做什么生意?
So, what business do you have together?

682
01:04:38,352 --> 01:04:40,615
哦，这是家族企业。
Oh, it's a family business.

683
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:43,792
在精密工程中生产产品。
Producing products in precision engineering.

684
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:46,970
你们生产什么?
What do you manufacture?

685
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:52,279
我们的产品被用于维护世界各地的民主。
Well, our products have been employed in upholding democracy all over the world.

686
01:04:58,024 --> 01:04:59,896
那是什么产品?
What product is that?

687
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:03,464
基本上，我们最畅销的产品是手榴弹。
Basically, our best-selling product is the hand grenade.

688
01:05:05,249 --> 01:05:07,164
抱歉，什么?
Sorry, the what?

689
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:09,427
手榴弹，亲爱的。
The hand grenade, dear.

690
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:18,131
在很长一段时间里，它都是个人爆炸装置。
For a long time, it was the personal exploding device.

691
01:05:18,175 --> 01:05:22,831
但后来联合国的规定把一切都搞砸了。
But then came those UN regulations, and messed everything up.

692
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:27,793
一个个人爆炸装置……原谅我。
A personal exploding device... Excuse me.

693
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:32,102
地雷的意思很复杂。
Is a very complicated word for a land mine.

694
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:40,110
是的…那些规定被削减了……利润打七五折。
Yeah... Those regulations trimmed... 25% off on profits.

695
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:47,595
是的。-那是我们的艰难时期，但是…-我们齐心协力，不是吗?-是的，亲爱的
Yeah. - It was hard times for us, but... - We pulled together, didn't we? - Yes, we did, darling.

696
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:50,163
我们仍然爱着对方。
And we still love each other.

697
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:52,035
-干杯!-哦，是的。
- A toast! - Oh, yeah.

698
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,952
呃…去爱!
Er... to love!

699
01:05:57,344 --> 01:05:58,606
-去爱。-去爱。
- To love. - To love.

700
01:06:08,225 --> 01:06:10,488
-先生-女士
- Sir. - Madam.

701
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:18,931
这是我们的海胆，加上海草乳剂。
This is our sea urchin, with an emulsion of sea weed.

702
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:25,720
上面是黑松露，鱼子酱，辣椒油，还有一点柚子油醋汁。
On top, you've got black truffle, caviar, chili oil, and a drizzle of yuzu vinaigrette.

703
01:06:25,764 --> 01:06:27,505
——享受!-谢谢。
- Enjoy! - Thank you.

704
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:33,641
——嗯!——嗯……
- Hmm! - Hmm...

705
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:44,043
你玩得开心吗?——是的。
Are you enjoying yourself? - Yes.

706
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,045
夫人。
Madam.

707
01:07:06,674 --> 01:07:08,154
先生。
Sir.

708
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:10,939
夫人。
Madam.

709
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:15,205
你觉得有点晕船吗?-是的，有一点。
So are you feeling a bit seasick? - Yes, a bit.

710
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:20,253
是的，所以我想最好吃点东西，因为空腹时晕船更严重。
Yes, so I think it would be better to eat something, because seasickness is worse on an empty stomach.

711
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:44,408
先生。
Sir.

712
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:56,159
所以，现在我们为船长提供一些汉堡和炸薯条。
So, now we are serving some hamburger with french fries for the captain.

713
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:58,161
我们为你准备了特别的礼物。
And for you, we have something really special.

714
01:07:58,204 --> 01:08:05,864
我们有烤烟熏的章鱼，配上焦糖柠檬，上面还有漂亮的花园花。请享受。
We have grilled and smoked octopus along with some caramelized lemon, and on top, beautiful garden flowers. Please enjoy.

715
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,520
我不喜欢高档餐厅。
I'm not a fan of fine dining.

716
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:14,438
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

717
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:24,780
这里查一下酒名?唯一接近Fr酒的东西…夫人?达圭诺，法国，长相思?
Here check wine name? only thing close to Fr wine... Madam? Dagueneau, French, Sauvignon blanc?

718
01:08:26,754 --> 01:08:28,147
香槟。
Champagne.

719
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:33,935
快!
Quick!

720
01:08:39,245 --> 01:08:41,029
身体健康!
Santé!

721
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:45,599
如果你晕船，你应该试着吃点东西，夫人。
If you feel seasick, you should try and eat something, ma'am.

722
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:48,820
哦，你还好吗?
Oh, are you okay?

723
01:08:48,863 --> 01:08:52,693
先生，您还好吗?
Are you alright, sir?

724
01:08:53,781 --> 01:08:55,914
先生?
Sir?

725
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:09,536
我好……
I'm good...

726
01:09:12,496 --> 01:09:14,454
原谅我。
Excuse me.

727
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:16,674
-你没事吧?-恐怕不行…
- Are you okay? - I'm afraid not...

728
01:09:18,806 --> 01:09:20,895
你好吗?
How are you?

729
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,944
我的天啊!哦!
Oh, my God! Oh!

730
01:09:25,987 --> 01:09:27,467
拜托。
Please.

731
01:09:27,511 --> 01:09:36,172
哦，哦，哦，哦……-哦，亲爱的。-再来点香槟…也许你该喝点水?
Oh, oh, oh, oh... - Oh, my darling. - More champagne... Maybe you should have some water?

732
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,564
香槟。
Champagne.

733
01:09:37,608 --> 01:09:40,132
香槟吗?你现在不应该喝香槟。
Champagne? You should not drink champagne now.

734
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,047
请喝点水。
Take some water, please.

735
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:47,705
好的。它是帮助。她很好。是的…
Okay. It's helping. She's fine. Yeah...

736
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:55,713
好的，去洗手间。走吧，我抓住你了。
Okay, the restroom. Let's go, I've got you.

737
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:58,672
再来点酒吗，先生?-柳德米拉，别离开我!
More wine, sir? - Ludmilla, don't leave me!

738
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:12,817
你没事吧?
You okay?

739
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:22,043
大流士吗?
Darius?

740
01:10:23,915 --> 01:10:27,397
他看起来不太好。-你没事吧?晕船吗，先生?
He doesn't look well. - You okay? Feeling seasick, sir?

741
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,313
是你的胸部吗?这里是胸痛。
Is it your chest? Here, chest pains.

742
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:32,663
-烤章鱼…-姜糖?
- Grilled octopus... - Ginger candy?

743
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:36,623
哦,女士。谢谢你今晚的款待。
Oh, ma'am. Thank you for tonight.

744
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:42,847
各位，让我们保持冷静。请就坐。
Everybody, let's try to keep calm. Take your seats.

745
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:46,067
呃…下一道菜一定很好吃。

01:10:46,111 --> 01:10:48,809
姜糖吗?如果你晕船，这很好。

继续走，一切都好。一切都很好。

752
01:11:06,349 --> 01:11:07,872
我要解开你的衬衫。
I'm gonna open your shirt.

753
01:11:07,915 --> 01:11:09,656
-是中风吗?-我不知道。

01:23:32,355 --> 01:23:35,749
“我看到的这个人是个野蛮的怪物。”
'"The person I see is a savage monster."'

880
01:23:35,793 --> 01:23:42,017
相反，他们编造了一些结构来为他们的行为辩护。
Instead, they make up some construction that justifies what they do.

881
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:45,585
就是这样。
And there it is.

882
01:23:45,629 --> 01:23:53,637
你很富有，所以你是一个慈善家，所以你可以因为没交足够的税而治愈你的良心。
You're rich, so you're a philanthropist, so you can cure your conscience for not paying enough in tax.

883
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:56,596
“对社会的贡献不够。”
'Not contributing enough to society.'

884
01:24:02,602 --> 01:24:05,257
妈妈!妈妈!
Mama! Mama!

885
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,311
噢!狗屎!
Ow! Shit!

886
01:24:15,354 --> 01:24:18,401
哦，打在我脸上了!我的天啊!-我有一个闪光灯。
Oh, it hit me in the face! Oh, my God! - I have a flash light.

887
01:24:18,444 --> 01:24:21,056
——操!-就这些吗?
- Fuck! - Was that everything?

888
01:24:21,099 --> 01:24:22,927
如何……这个怎么样?
How about... How about this one?

889
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:27,062
——哦!那那!——噢!狗屎!该死的!
- Oh! That... That! - Ow! Shit! Goddamn it!

890
01:24:29,107 --> 01:24:31,414
我想给你读点我写的东西。
I want to read you something that I wrote.

891
01:24:32,893 --> 01:24:35,983
到这边来。带来光明。——好的。
Come over here. Bring the light. - Okay.

892
01:24:41,815 --> 01:24:47,778
我记得，我七岁的时候走进厨房，发现妈妈在伤心地哭。
And I recall, I was seven years old walking into the kitchen to find my mother crying inconsolably.

893
01:24:47,821 --> 01:24:50,694
马丁·路德·金遭到枪击。
Martin Luther King had been shot.

894
01:24:50,737 --> 01:24:55,090
两个月后，她又哭了。鲍比·肯尼迪被杀了。
Two months later, she was crying again. Bobby Kennedy was killed.

895
01:24:55,133 --> 01:25:02,706
当时我不可能知道我现在知道的，那根连接马丁·路德·金、肯尼迪兄弟和马尔科姆·艾克斯的无形的线，
I couldn't know then what I know now, that the invisible thread connecting Martin Luther King, the Kennedy brothers, and Malcolm X,

896
01:25:02,749 --> 01:25:07,276
就是在每一次事件中，我的政府都在扳机上。
was that in each case, my government had their finger on the trigger.

897
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:09,365
——等待。等等!-但是每个…
- Wait. Wait! - But every...

898
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,114
再说一遍。
Say it again.

899
01:25:21,203 --> 01:25:29,428
我的政府谋杀了马丁·路德·金、马尔科姆·艾克斯、鲍比·肯尼迪和约翰·f·肯尼迪。
My government murdered Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Bobby Kennedy, and John F. Kennedy.

900
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:40,004
我的政府推翻了智利，委内瑞拉，阿根廷，秘鲁，萨尔瓦多，尼加拉瓜，巴拿马和玻利维亚人民善良，诚实，民主的领导人。
'My government overthrew good, honest, democratic leaders 'of the people in Chile, Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, 'El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, and Bolivia.

901
01:25:40,047 --> 01:25:48,926
我们和英国一起瓜分了中东，人为划定了地理边界，扶植了傀儡独裁者
'Along with Britain, we carved up the Middle East, 'creating artificial geographical boundaries 'and installing puppet dictators.'

902
01:25:48,969 --> 01:25:52,973
战争本身成了我们最赚钱的产业。
War itself became our most lucrative industry.

903
01:25:53,017 --> 01:25:57,021
每投下一颗炸弹，就有人赚到一百万美元。
Every bomb that's dropped, somebody makes a million dollars.

904
01:25:57,064 --> 01:26:00,198
你不需要知道炸弹在哪里爆炸。
You don't have to know where those bombs are exploding.

905
01:26:00,242 --> 01:26:04,855
你不必看到悲伤的母亲和她们孩子血肉模糊的尸体。
You don't have to see the grieving mothers and the mangled bodies of their children.

906
01:26:04,898 --> 01:26:09,599
1918年，尤金·德布斯在俄亥俄州坎顿发表了这样的演讲:
'Eugene Debs gave this speech in Canton, Ohio, in 1918:

907
01:26:09,642 --> 01:26:13,994
’”纵观历史，战争总是为了征服和掠夺而发动。
'"Throughout history wars have been waged for conquest and plunder.

908
01:26:14,038 --> 01:26:17,041
大师班总是在宣战。
'"The master class has always declared the wars.

909
01:26:17,084 --> 01:26:20,044
’”科目班一直在斗争……-嘿，手榴弹。
'"The subject class has always fought...' - Hey, hand grenade.

910
01:26:20,087 --> 01:26:27,878
"他们教导你们相信参加战争是你们的爱国义务" "听命于他们屠杀自己。
'"They've taught you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war '"and to have yourselves slaughtered at their command.

911
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:31,011
“华尔街说要开战，媒体也说要开战……”
'"When Wall Street says war, the press says war..."'

912
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,759
哦!
Oh!

913
01:26:41,805 --> 01:26:46,113
温斯顿……看。
Winston... Look.

914
01:26:46,157 --> 01:26:48,855
-这不是我们的吗?-哦，不!
- Isn't this one of ours? - Oh, no!

915
01:27:52,658 --> 01:27:54,094
嘿!
Hey!

916
01:28:01,537 --> 01:28:03,669
嘿!帮帮我!
Hey! Help me!

917
01:28:32,089 --> 01:28:33,656
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

918
01:28:40,402 --> 01:28:42,186
你是谁?
Who are you?

919
01:28:46,059 --> 01:28:48,888
嘿!嘿,你!
Hey! Hey, you!

920
01:28:51,282 --> 01:28:52,675

923
01:29:00,726 --> 01:29:02,728
是的。你是谁?
Yeah. Who are you?

924
01:29:04,513 --> 01:29:06,558
我在船上工作。
I work on the boat.

925
01:29:06,602 --> 01:29:09,039
-你在船上工作?-是的。
- You work on the boat? - Yeah.

926
01:29:09,082 --> 01:29:11,171
穿t恤和短裤?
In T-shirt and shorts?

927
01:29:11,215 --> 01:29:15,001
不，不，那是因为，呃…我下班了。
No, no, it's because, er... I was off duty.

928
01:29:16,829 --> 01:29:21,834
我在睡觉，然后…-你下班了，是吗?-是的。
I was sleeping, and then... - You were off duty, yeah? - Yeah.

929
01:29:23,009 --> 01:29:26,491
-有什么问题吗?-真奇怪，我从没见过你。
- Is there a problem? - Strange, I've never seen you.

930
01:29:26,535 --> 01:29:28,841
-保持冷静。-我在引擎室工作。
- Stay calm. - I work in the engine room.

931
01:29:28,885 --> 01:29:31,191
-引擎室?-是的，是的。
- In engine room? - Yeah, yeah.

932
01:29:31,235 --> 01:29:33,759
对不起，我以前从没见过你。
I'm sorry, I've never seen you before.

933
01:29:33,803 --> 01:29:36,501
他在引擎室工作?-他在哪里工作并不重要。
He works in the engine room? - It doesn't matter where he works.

934
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:40,505
现在安静下来。在这种情况下保持冷静。
Settle down now. Stay calm in this situation.

935
01:29:40,549 --> 01:29:43,203
我很冷静，我很冷静。你有毛病吗，伙计?
I'm calm, I'm calm. What's the problem with you, man?

936
01:29:43,247 --> 01:29:45,031
没有其他人了吗?
No one else?

937
01:29:45,075 --> 01:29:46,772
你以为我是海盗?
You think I'm a pirate?

938
01:29:46,816 --> 01:29:48,557
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

939
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,821
就因为我是黑人，你就认为我是海盗。就是这样!
Just because I'm black, you think that I'm a pirate. That's it!

940
01:29:51,864 --> 01:29:56,478

- Ah! Okay, okay. - Don't go there... Don't say that I'm... - Don't go there.

941
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:58,610
你可以趴在我肩膀上哭!
You can cry on my shoulder!

942
01:29:58,654 --> 01:30:02,614
他拿着他的大手表来找我，说我是海盗，就因为我是黑人!
He comes to me with his big watch and says I'm a pirate just because I'm black!

943
01:30:02,658 --> 01:30:04,094
你有毛病吗，伙计?
What's the problem with you, man?

944
01:30:04,137 --> 01:30:06,270
他没说过你是黑人。
He hasn't said anything about you being black.

945
01:30:06,313 --> 01:30:13,538
你说他是种族主义者。-从他的眼神里，我能看出来…你是谁?你是谁?——先生!
You're calling him a racist. - In the eyes, I can see it in his eyes... Who are you? Who are you? - Sir!

946
01:30:13,582 --> 01:30:16,846
我在引擎室工作，伙计!——先生!

947
01:30:16,889 --> 01:30:18,978
——什么?-不好意思。
- What? - Excuse me.

948
01:30:19,022 --> 01:30:21,285
我觉得你现在应该冷静下来。
I think you should just calm down now.

949
01:30:21,328 --> 01:30:23,896
现在不是升级局势的好时机。
It's not a good time to step up the situation.

950
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:26,943
-保持冷静，保持乐观。他在引擎室工作?
- Just stay calm and stay positive. - - He works in the engine room?

951
01:30:26,986 --> 01:30:30,599
船上有很多人。我们不能一直见面。
There's a lot of people on the boat. We can't see each other all the time.

952
01:30:30,642 --> 01:30:34,733
-那有什么问题?-请不要去那里。
- So what's the problem? - Please don't go there.

953
01:30:34,777 --> 01:30:36,605
我很抱歉。我一定要拿到它。
I'm sorry. I just have to get that.

954
01:30:38,128 --> 01:30:41,000
你要说什么就说什么。——停止。
Just say what you have to say. - Stop.

955
01:30:41,044 --> 01:30:42,741
说给我听。
Say it to me.

956
01:30:42,785 --> 01:30:45,135
是的，我知道。我再打给你。我知道。
Yes, I know. I'll get back to you. I know.

957
01:30:45,178 --> 01:30:47,703
先生,先生!
Sir. Sir!

958
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,837
哦!啊!
Oh! Ah!

959
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,055
简单,简单!
Easy, easy!

960
01:31:50,809 --> 01:31:55,118
哦……——噢!噢!-嘘，嘘!

961
01:31:57,729 --> 01:31:59,557
保持安静。
Be quiet.

962
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:16,356
不，别用照明弹!
No, don't use the flares!

963
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,316
这是我们最后的信号弹了!别用照明弹!
It's our last flare! Don't use the flare!

964
01:33:45,141 --> 01:33:47,970

1005
01:37:35,893 --> 01:37:37,242
疯了。
Crazy.

1006
01:37:41,943 --> 01:37:46,382
-她用手接住了吗?干得好，阿比盖尔!
- Did she catch that with her hands? - - Good job, Abigail!

1007
01:37:47,949 --> 01:37:51,866
好工作!那是什么?章鱼吗?
Good job! What is that? An octopus?

1008
01:37:51,909 --> 01:37:54,042
——章鱼。——好!
- Octopus. - Good!

1009
01:37:54,085 --> 01:37:57,175
你觉得我们现在该怎么办?-真他妈厉害。
What do you think we should do now? - Fucking impressive.

1010
01:37:57,219 --> 01:38:02,180
-我们得生个火。我们当然需要生火。
- We need to make a fire. - - Of course we need to make a fire.

1011
01:38:02,224 --> 01:38:08,143
是的……你们有人知道怎么生火吗?
Yes... Do any of you know how to make a fire?

1012
01:38:08,186 --> 01:38:09,405
什么?
What?

1013
01:38:09,448 --> 01:38:13,278
你们有人知道怎么生火吗?
Do any of you know how to make a fire?

1014
01:38:16,412 --> 01:38:17,892

1015
01:38:18,805 --> 01:38:20,546
——什么?——不!
- What? - No!

1016
01:38:22,505 --> 01:38:28,554
你钓完鱼就生火，然后我们应该……我们需要清洗章鱼。-当然了。
Then you'll make the fire after you're done fishing, and then we should... We need to clean the octopus. - Of course we do.

1017
01:38:32,689 --> 01:38:36,214
你们有人知道怎么清洗章鱼吗?
Do any of you know how to clean an octopus?

1018
01:38:36,258 --> 01:38:40,523
——嗯?-去清洗章鱼!
- Huh? - To clean an octopus!

1019
01:38:40,566 --> 01:38:42,568
你知道怎么做吗?
Do you know how to do it?

1020
01:38:51,142 --> 01:38:53,188
啊哈……
Uh-huh...

1021
01:39:03,415 --> 01:39:05,200
一个给你。
One for you.

1022
01:39:06,201 --> 01:39:08,072
给我一个。

01:39:23,783 --> 01:39:27,048

1032
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:29,528
一个给你。
One for you.

1033
01:39:29,572 --> 01:39:31,139

1036
01:39:37,275 --> 01:39:39,538
——哼!——什么?
- Uh-huh! - What?

1037
01:39:42,063 --> 01:39:43,716
那是什么?
What's that?

1038
01:39:45,675 --> 01:39:47,590
那是我的。
That's mine.

1039
01:39:47,633 --> 01:39:49,722
不，那一大堆?那是什么?
No, the big pile there? What's that?

1040
01:39:49,766 --> 01:39:52,116
我的。它是我的。
Mine. It's mine.

1041
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:55,119
-所有这些?——是的。
- All of this? - Yes.

1042
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:00,081
不。不，不，不……你为什么能得到这么多食物?
No. No, no, no... Why do you get so much food?

1043
01:40:01,865 --> 01:40:03,040
为什么?
Why?

1044
01:40:07,044 --> 01:40:08,915
我抓住了那条鱼。
I caught the fish.

1045
01:40:09,655 --> 01:40:11,831
——是吗?-我生的火。
- Yes? - I made the fire.

1046
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:13,746
- - - ?-我做饭。
- And? - I cooked.

1047
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:17,837
我做了所有的工作。每个人都有所收获。
I did all the work. And everybody got something.

1048
01:40:20,884 --> 01:40:26,324
嗯…不。不，我们都……我们都在工作。
Hmm... No. No, we all... we all worked.

1049
01:40:26,368 --> 01:40:28,500
你做了什么?
What did you do?

1050
01:40:29,501 --> 01:40:33,114
我们……收集了生火用的所有木材。
We... gathered all the wood for the fire.

1051
01:40:33,157 --> 01:40:35,768
我移动了圆木。
I moved the log.

1052
01:40:35,812 --> 01:40:39,337
是啊，这个大木头本来在那边，我们把它移到了这里。
Yeah, this big log was over there, and we moved it over here.

1053
01:40:39,381 --> 01:40:41,035
不够的。
Not enough.

1054
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:45,430
不，也许还不够，但我们需要合作。
No, maybe not enough, but we need to work together.

1055
01:40:45,474 --> 01:40:49,565
他们不知道该怎么做。——没错。
They don't know how to do that. - Exactly.

1056
01:40:51,436 --> 01:40:55,440
也许这就是为什么你不应该这么懒，不应该依赖我。
And maybe that's why you should not be so lazy and dependent on me.

1057
01:40:55,484 --> 01:40:58,182
啊哈!
Uh-huh!

1058
01:41:17,245 --> 01:41:24,600
阿比盖尔……我想你忘了你和我都是一家大航运公司的雇员。
Abigail... I think you're forgetting that you and I are employees of a big shipping company.

1059
01:41:24,643 --> 01:41:26,515
还记得吗?
Remember?

1060
01:41:26,558 --> 01:41:30,127
最后，我要对客人的安全负责。
In the end, I'm responsible for the safety of the guests.

1061
01:41:30,171 --> 01:41:32,086
你必须照我说的做。
You have to do what I say.

1062
01:41:33,174 --> 01:41:36,873
我们在游艇上工作。你是一个厕所管理员。
We work on a yacht. You are a toilet manager.

1063
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:39,745
你不知道怎么处理…-什么游艇?
You don't know how to handle... - What yacht?

1064
01:41:39,789 --> 01:41:41,878
游艇在哪里?
Where's the yacht?

1065
01:41:41,921 --> 01:41:44,968
你知道的，阿比盖尔，我很有钱。
You know this, Abigail, I am a very rich man.

1066
01:41:45,011 --> 01:41:48,624
等我们回来，我可以为你做点好事。
When we get back, I can do good things for you.

1067
01:41:48,667 --> 01:41:51,105
我可以让你的生活轻松美好。
I can make your life easy and nice.

1068
01:41:51,148 --> 01:41:53,585
-我们回来的时候?-是的。
- When we get back? - Yeah.

1069
01:41:53,629 --> 01:41:55,935
等我们回来的时候。人们在找我们。
When we get back. People are looking for us.

1070
01:41:55,979 --> 01:41:59,069
怎么，你以为我们会永远待在这里吗?什么?
What, you think that we'll stay here forever? What?

1071
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:01,811
你有趣。
You're funny.

1072
01:42:01,854 --> 01:42:07,295
你不是这样被训练的，阿比盖尔。请给…哇!
This is not how you were trained, Abigail. Please give... Whoa!

1073
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:12,082
拜托，这太荒谬了。
Come on, this is ridiculous.

1074
01:42:13,736 --> 01:42:16,956
你吓到别人了。把棍子放下。
You're scaring people. Put the stick down.

1075
01:42:18,219 --> 01:42:19,698
嘿!
Hey!

1076
01:42:24,921 --> 01:42:26,531
我是谁?
Who am I?

1077
01:42:27,967 --> 01:42:30,448
-你是谁?-我是谁?
- Who are you? - Who am I?

1078
01:42:30,492 --> 01:42:34,713
-你是厕所管理员。——没有。
- You're the toilet manager. - No.

1079
01:42:34,757 --> 01:42:39,327
在游艇上，厕所管理员。在这里……队长。我是谁?
On the yacht, toilet manager. Here... captain. Who am I?

1080
01:42:43,548 --> 01:42:45,550
你是船长。
You're the captain.

1081
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:48,466
是的。
Yes.

1082
01:42:51,513 --> 01:42:54,168
-我是谁?——队长。

-我是谁?——队长。

1085
01:43:00,609 --> 01:43:02,437
-我是谁?-船长。

1086
01:43:03,307 --> 01:43:05,440
我是谁?
Who am I?

1087
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,706
我是谁?
Who am I?

1088
01:43:12,925 --> 01:43:14,536
我是谁?
Who am I?

1089
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:26,983
在游艇上，清洁女工。这里,船长。
In the yacht, cleaning lady. Here, captain.

1090
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,333
好吗?
Okay?

1091
01:43:43,608 --> 01:43:45,654
再来一个。
Have one more.

1092
01:43:45,697 --> 01:43:47,133
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1093
01:43:48,265 --> 01:43:50,311
我会说，我同意。
I would say, I agree.

1094
01:43:50,354 --> 01:43:54,184
我是说，呃……我们必须共同努力。
I mean, er... we have to work together.

1095
01:43:55,272 --> 01:43:58,710
和…创建一个好的团队。
And... create a good group.

1096
01:43:58,754 --> 01:44:00,321
良好的社会。
Good society.

1097
01:44:00,364 --> 01:44:09,243
你知道有句谚语:“各尽所能，按需分配”吗?
Do you know the saying, "From each according to his ability, "to each according to his needs"?

1098
01:44:12,289 --> 01:44:14,378
你不知道吗?
You don't know this?

1099
01:44:15,597 --> 01:44:17,251
女士波拉…
Ma'am Paula...

1100
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:31,003
关于你在这种情况下的专业知识…我想提个建议，可以吗?
With respect to your expertise in this situation... I would like to make a suggestion, if that's okay?

1101
01:44:32,396 --> 01:44:33,832
确定。
Sure.

1102
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:45,670
我的建议是男孩们…待在这里看着火，照顾好夫人。
My suggestion is that the boys... stay here and watch the fire, and take care of madame.

1103
01:44:45,714 --> 01:44:51,285
而你，宝拉女士，你和我一起睡在救生艇上。
While you, ma'am Paula, and you sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1104
01:45:18,486 --> 01:45:19,835
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1105
01:45:26,885 --> 01:45:32,500
阿比盖尔，看这个…我就把我的百达翡丽给你。
Hey, Abigail, look this... I would give you my Patek Philippe.

1106
01:45:32,543 --> 01:45:37,505
在船上住一晚。嗨,阿比盖尔…15万欧元!
For one night in the boat. Hey, Abigail... 150 thousand euros!

1107
01:45:38,723 --> 01:45:42,597
让我们进去。-给你…原来的劳力士。
Let us in. - For you... original Rolex.

1108
01:45:49,517 --> 01:45:53,042
纳尔逊……她把包留下了。
Nelson... she left the bag.

1109
01:45:53,999 --> 01:45:56,306
——什么?-她把包留下了。
- What? - She left the bag.

1110
01:45:59,527 --> 01:46:01,790
里面有什么?
What's in it?

1111
01:46:12,453 --> 01:46:14,629
椒盐卷饼。
Pretzel sticks.

1112
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:23,464
不，我们不能接受。-我只是看看。对吧?
No, we can't have it. - I'm just gonna have a look. Alright?

1113
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:32,516
——好!-我们不能。不。
- Nice! - We can't. No.

1114
01:46:40,568 --> 01:46:42,308
-等待…-你在干什么?
- Wait... - What are you doing?

1115
01:46:42,352 --> 01:46:43,788
等等，等等，等等……
Wait, wait, wait...

1116
01:46:50,534 --> 01:46:51,970
也许……
Maybe...

1117
01:46:54,930 --> 01:47:03,852
如果我们在这里挖一个小洞…拿两个出来。各一个。他们不会注意到的。
if we just make a little hole here... Take two out. One each. They'll never notice it.

1118
01:47:03,895 --> 01:47:05,810
好吧，让我试试。
Okay, let me try.

1119
01:47:09,553 --> 01:47:11,816
-停下，停下，停下…——现在?
- Stop it, stop it, stop it... - Now?

1120
01:47:24,525 --> 01:47:26,570
太完美了!
That was perfect!

1121
01:47:29,051 --> 01:47:32,184
我不想吃!我要拯救它!-太好了!
I don't wanna eat it! I wanna save it! - So good!

1122
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:35,971
把它放回去。
Put it back.

1123
01:47:53,075 --> 01:47:54,380
嗯…
Hmm...

1124
01:48:00,778 --> 01:48:03,085
-我们再来一杯好吗?-是的。
- Shall we just have one more? - Yeah.

1125
01:48:03,128 --> 01:48:04,347
是啊!
Yeah!

1126
01:48:16,228 --> 01:48:17,621
维拉!
Vera!

1127
01:49:22,381 --> 01:49:24,688
那么，这里发生了什么?
So, what happened here?

1128
01:49:24,732 --> 01:49:31,129
呃…我们犯了一个错误。为什么?
Er... we made a mistake with... Why?

1129
01:49:31,173 --> 01:49:33,305
我们只是睡着了。
We just fell asleep.

1130
01:49:33,349 --> 01:49:37,614
现在我没有足够的时间去钓鱼了，因为我得再生一堆火。
Now I won't have enough time to go fish, because I have to make another fire.

1131
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:42,010
你知道，生火要费很多功夫。
It takes a lot of work to make a fire, you know.

1132
01:49:42,053 --> 01:49:43,794
是的,是的。我们知道。
Yeah, yeah. We know.

1133
01:50:00,332 --> 01:50:01,986
好的。
Okay.

1134
01:50:03,901 --> 01:50:07,209
好的。好吧,好吧。让我们开始这一天吧。
Okay. Okay, okay. Let's get this day started.

1135
01:50:07,252 --> 01:50:09,385
来吧，大家。我们走吧。
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

1136
01:50:11,213 --> 01:50:12,910
——好的。——酷。
- Okay. - Cool.

1137
01:50:12,954 --> 01:50:15,957
等等，等等，等等。还有一件事。
Wait, wait, wait. There's one more thing.

1138
01:50:17,698 --> 01:50:28,796
因为昨晚，我们把背包落在这里了，我们不太确定，但是…我们好像少了一包椒盐卷饼棒。
Because, last night, we left our backpack here, and, well, we're not very sure, but... we think we're missing a pack of pretzel sticks.

1139
01:50:30,014 --> 01:50:32,538
-你没拿吧?——没有。
- You didn't take it, did you? - No.

1140
01:50:32,582 --> 01:50:33,975
不。
No.

1141
01:50:36,325 --> 01:50:38,501
-你确定吗?-是的，我们确定!来吧。
- Are you sure? - Yeah, we're sure! Come on.

1142
01:50:38,544 --> 01:50:41,983
-为什么要指控我们?-不，我不是在指责你。
- Why are we being accused? - Oh, no, I'm not accusing you.

1143
01:50:42,026 --> 01:50:44,202
我只是想确认一下，因为…
I'm just making sure, because...

1144
01:50:50,687 --> 01:50:51,949
这是什么?
What's this?

1145
01:50:54,038 --> 01:50:55,823
-我们没有…-你没有?
- Well, we didn't... - You didn't?

1146
01:50:55,866 --> 01:50:57,302
——没有。-不，我们没有
- No. - No, we didn't.

1147
01:50:57,346 --> 01:51:00,131
-你确定你没有?-我们肯定没有。
- And you're sure you didn't? - We are sure we didn't.

1148
01:51:00,175 --> 01:51:02,003
-非常确定?——是的。
- Very sure? - Yes.

1149
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:08,879
我认为他们应该受到惩罚。-是的，宝拉女士。
I think they need to be punished. - Yes, ma'am Paula.

1150
01:51:11,795 --> 01:51:14,189
这真的很糟糕。
This is really bad.

1151
01:51:14,232 --> 01:51:16,582
这真的非常非常糟糕。
This is really, really bad.

1152
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:21,718
哦，得了吧……我是说，你没看到大火。
Oh, come on... I mean, you didn't watch the fire.

1153
01:51:21,762 --> 01:51:24,242
然后你偷了一包椒盐卷饼棒?
And then you steal a pack of pretzel sticks?

1154
01:51:24,286 --> 01:51:27,115
-是啊，还撒谎-我们活该。
- Yeah, and lie about it. - We deserved it.

1155
01:51:27,158 --> 01:51:30,205
不仅是我，还有在座的各位。
And not just to me, to everybody here.

1156
01:51:32,076 --> 01:51:34,296
你做了那种事，我们怎么能相信你?
How can we trust you, after what you did?

1157
01:51:34,339 --> 01:51:36,753
我现在得说点什么，因为这太荒谬了。
I need to say something now, because this is becoming ridiculous.

1158
01:51:36,777 --> 01:51:41,129
-不，让我说，阿比盖尔你看到了吗?
- No, let me say something, Abigail. - - Did you see that?

1159
01:51:41,172 --> 01:51:42,957
什么?
What?

1160
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,047
别指着她。把手放下。
Don't point at her. Put your hands down.

1161
01:51:47,483 --> 01:51:50,965
-好吧，好吧，让我说…把手放下!
- Okay, alright, Just let me say, though... - - Put your hands down!

1162
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:53,141
什么?
What?

1163
01:51:53,184 --> 01:51:56,013
你的肢体语言太挑衅了，卡尔!
Your body language is so aggressive, Carl!

1164
01:51:56,057 --> 01:51:59,190
什么?-我不会给你拿吃的。
What? - I'm not getting any food for you.

1165
01:51:59,234 --> 01:52:06,241
-你自己找吃的。——什么?拜托，伙计……-不，阿比盖尔，太不公平了!-把手放下。
- You find your own food. - What? Come on, man... - No, Abigail, that's so unfair! - Put your hands down.

1166
01:52:06,284 --> 01:52:09,635
你真的不明白。把手放下!
You seriously don't get it. Put your hands down!

1167
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:13,378
-我在为自己辩护。-不要为自己辩护!
- I'm trying to defend myself. - Don't defend yourself!

1168
01:52:13,422 --> 01:52:17,339
你为自己辩护是在给她带来痛苦。
You are inflicting pain on her by defending yourself.

1169
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:37,881
闭上你的臭嘴!不…
Shut the fuck up! No...

1170
01:52:40,405 --> 01:52:41,798
不!
No!

1171
01:53:09,434 --> 01:53:11,741
嘿!哈哈!
Hey! Ha-ha!

1172
01:53:13,047 --> 01:53:15,919
哦……嘿。
Oh... hey.

1173
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:19,836
-多好的鱼啊?——是的。
- What a nice fish, huh? - Yes.

1174
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:21,969
——哇!-我们有很多。
- Wow! - We have a lot.

1175
01:53:23,013 --> 01:53:25,537
这是晚餐，是吗?太好了。
So it's dinner, huh? Great.

1176
01:53:27,322 --> 01:53:30,804
你在哪儿买的?-那里，在岩石后面。
Where did you get it? - There, at the back of the rock.

1177
01:53:32,196 --> 01:53:34,938
-你很擅长这个。-谢谢。
- You're good at that. - Thank you.

1178
01:53:38,724 --> 01:53:40,204
你需要帮助吗?
You need help?

1179
01:53:40,248 --> 01:53:43,512
当然，吃点Nutella吧。
Yeah, sure, get some Nutella.

1180
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:07,666
哦，谢谢!
Oh, thank you!

1181
01:55:27,442 --> 01:55:29,270
什么?
What?

1182
01:55:40,803 --> 01:55:44,285
——亚亚?等等,等等!-白痴!尿了!
- Yaya? Wait, wait! - Dickhead! Piss off!

1183
01:56:06,089 --> 01:56:09,440
好了，我现在要上救生艇了。
Okay, I'm going to the lifeboat now.

1184
01:56:09,484 --> 01:56:12,574
宝拉女士，你能留在这里看着火吗?
Ma'am Paula, can you stay here and watch the fire?

1185
01:56:12,617 --> 01:56:14,010
确定。
Sure.

1186
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:21,757
卡尔今天什么都没吃，他可以和我一起睡在救生艇上。
And since Carl didn't eat anything today, he can sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1187
01:56:23,889 --> 01:56:25,369
好的。是的。
Okay. Yeah.

1188
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:34,857
我能去吗?-阿比盖尔，我们能一起去吗?
Can I come? - Abigail, can we both come or...?

1189
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:37,120
不，只有你。
No, just you.

1190
01:56:40,341 --> 01:56:44,084
好吧，我要椒盐卷饼!——嗯?
Fine, I'll take the pretzels! - Eh?

1191
01:56:48,653 --> 01:56:50,568
你把这变成了一个问题。
You're making this into an issue.

1192
01:56:50,612 --> 01:56:52,831
你打算带走他们吗?是的，拿去吧。好。
Are you going to take them? Yes, take them. Good.

1193
01:56:52,875 --> 01:56:58,228
你为什么要把这事搞成问题?-我来了!一秒!
Why are you making this into an issue? - I'm coming! One second!

1194
01:57:04,408 --> 01:57:08,064
你要在船上做什么?-我不知道。
What are you gonna do on the boat? - I don't know.

1195
01:57:09,892 --> 01:57:11,633
别装天真，认真点!
Don't act naive, seriously!

1196
01:57:11,676 --> 01:57:15,376
我不知道她为什么要问我，但我当然要去做了……——真的吗?——是的。
I don't know why she asked me, but I'm gonna do it, of course... - Really? - Yes.

1197
01:57:15,419 --> 01:57:17,943
你觉得她想从你身上得到什么?
What do you think she wants with you?

1198
01:57:17,987 --> 01:57:20,707
你是个年轻的帅哥。你觉得她会怎么处置你?
You're a young, hot guy. What do you think she's going to do with you?

1199
01:57:22,296 --> 01:57:24,646
-好吧，那就还给我…——没有。不!
- Okay, then give them back... - No. No!

1200
01:57:24,689 --> 01:57:27,649
-让我拿回去。——没有。他们是我的，好吗?
- Let me take them back. - No. And they're mine, okay?

1201
01:57:27,692 --> 01:57:30,217
吃几颗，我就把它们收回去，因为我不想这么做。
Take a few, and I'll take them back, cos I don't wanna do this.

1202
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:32,175
-这不是个好主意。-我要这些!
- It's not a good idea. - I want these!

1203
01:57:32,219 --> 01:57:36,658
你得告诉我该怎么做!你得告诉我怎么处理这件事。
You need to tell me what to do! You need to tell me how to navigate this.

1204
01:57:42,403 --> 01:57:43,752
亚亚?
Yaya?

1205
01:57:47,538 --> 01:57:50,106
你只需要迎合她的自尊心。
You just have to stroke her ego.

1206
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:56,634
只是…对她讲的笑话哈哈大笑。
Just... laugh at her jokes.

1207
01:57:56,678 --> 01:58:01,596
- - -…和微笑。——嗯……好的。
- And... and smile. - Mm-hmm... Okay.

1208
01:58:01,639 --> 01:58:04,555
一定要设定好界限。-是的。
Make sure to set up boundaries. - Yeah.

1209
01:58:04,599 --> 01:58:08,472
不要和性有关，好吗?-不，我不会做任何与性有关的事。
And nothing sexual, okay? - No, I won't do anything sexual.

1210
01:58:09,169 --> 01:58:12,322
嗯哼…不要做任何你不想让我做的事。
Mm-hmm... And don't do anything you wouldn't want me to do.

1211
01:58:12,346 --> 01:58:14,565
不，我不会做任何让你不舒服的事。
No, I won't do anything you're not comfortable with.

1212
01:58:14,609 --> 01:58:17,525
没有接吻。不是那样的!
No kissing. Nothing like that!

1213
01:58:21,877 --> 01:58:23,966
雅雅，我觉得她可能在期待什么。
Yaya, I think she's probably expecting something.

1214
01:58:25,794 --> 01:58:31,974
-比如?-我不知道…我,呃……-按摩，或者…-按摩?
- Like what? - I don't know... I, er... - A massage, or... - A massage?

1215
01:58:32,017 --> 01:58:34,977
我不知道。她可能想要什么。-绝对不是按摩!
I don't know. She might want something. - Definitely not a massage!

1216
01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:39,938
她刚给了我一整包椒盐卷饼给你…我不知道该说什么……我什么都不能做?
She just gave me a whole fucking packet of pretzels for you... I don't know what to say... I can't do anything?

1217
01:58:39,982 --> 01:58:44,552
——不!-好吧，但是…-按摩她的脖子。好吧?-我可以按摩她的脖子吗?
- No! - Okay, but... - Massage her neck. Okay? - I can massage her neck?

1218
01:58:44,595 --> 01:58:46,989
-她的脖子，就是它!-好，好，好…
- Her neck, that's it! - Okay, okay, okay...

1219
01:58:49,383 --> 01:58:51,124
好的。
Okay.

1220
01:58:53,256 --> 01:58:55,693
-我很爱你。-我恨你。
- I love you so much. - Well, I hate you.

1221
01:58:55,737 --> 01:59:01,482
我理解!他妈的……是的…来了!
I understand! Fuck... Yeah... Coming!

1222
01:59:19,413 --> 01:59:21,415
-待会儿见。——早上。
- See you in a bit. - Morning.

1223
01:59:22,503 --> 01:59:24,853
-哦，早上好。——混蛋。

1224
01:59:26,376 --> 01:59:29,162
亚亚!亚亚,等等。等待。
Yaya! Yaya, wait. Wait.

1225
01:59:36,299 --> 01:59:39,172
嘿,你!
Hey, you!

1226
02:00:12,335 --> 02:00:14,642
-再见。——好的。
- See you later. - Okay.

1227
02:00:14,685 --> 02:00:18,167
海盗!海盗!他来了!他被抓住了!
Pirate! Pirate! He's coming! He got caught!

1228
02:00:23,172 --> 02:00:24,869
恶心。
Disgusting.

1229
02:00:24,913 --> 02:00:26,871
什么?
What?

1230
02:00:38,579 --> 02:00:40,624
搞什么鬼?
What the fuck?

1231
02:00:41,756 --> 02:00:43,714
哦，该死的…
Oh, fucking hell...

1232
02:01:01,471 --> 02:01:04,344
-漂亮的男孩!-我们能看见你!
- Pretty boy! - We can see you!

1233
02:01:15,703 --> 02:01:19,097
你用过你的…当你年轻的时候?
Have you ever used your... when you were young?

1234
02:01:21,970 --> 02:01:24,233
你和别人上床是为了找工作吗?
Oh, you slept with somebody to get a job?

1235
02:01:35,418 --> 02:01:37,420
不，你没有?
No, you didn't?

1236
02:01:37,464 --> 02:01:40,162
真的吗?一次?
Really? Once?

1237
02:01:45,515 --> 02:01:48,257

Therese... Wow!

1238
02:01:53,349 --> 02:01:55,482

-给我!-拿去!把它。
- Give it to me! - Take it! Take it.

你们表现得像个孩子。把哨子给我!
You're acting like children. Give me the whistle!

1241
02:02:04,969 --> 02:02:06,971
现在就把哨子给我!

1242

不。我们不去那里。什么?
No. We don't go there. What?

1247
02:03:04,028 --> 02:03:06,117
-来吧，伙计们!——嘘!

尼尔森，给我。

1249
02:03:16,911 --> 02:03:19,174
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

1250
02:03:37,061 --> 02:03:38,454
他妈的……
Fuck...

1251
02:03:45,287 --> 02:03:47,028
它是一只雌性的。
It's a female.

- Okay, okay! - The donkey fairytale... - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Thank you very much.

1265
02:05:29,043 --> 02:05:34,962
好吧……杀死一头驴，可能是一项伟大的成就。
Okay... To kill a donkey, it may be a great achievement.

1266
02:05:35,005 --> 02:05:38,008
但有一件事要伟大得多。
But there's one thing that's so much greater.

1267
02:05:38,052 --> 02:05:41,446
-画画!-画画，是的!
- To paint! - To paint, yes!

1268
02:05:42,186 --> 02:05:45,233
画一头驴!
To paint a donkey!

1269
02:05:45,276 --> 02:05:48,018
是的!
Yes!

1270
02:05:51,282 --> 02:05:53,458
让我们来看看这个表达。
Let's take a look at the expression.

1271
02:05:53,502 --> 02:05:56,026
-这是谁干的?——我。
- Who did this one? - Me.

1272
02:05:56,070 --> 02:05:59,421
好了，两脚很近，很近。
Okay, the feet are close, close together.

1273
02:05:59,464 --> 02:06:02,816
这头驴想要掌控一切。
This donkey wants to be in control.

1274
02:06:02,859 --> 02:06:06,254
但它看起来很害怕。
But it looks almost scared.

1275
02:06:07,124 --> 02:06:12,303
你想让这头驴…不要那么害怕。
You want to tell this donkey to... to not be so scared.

1276
02:06:12,347 --> 02:06:20,224
它失去控制，疯狂地挥舞着尾巴，飞奔过田野!
To lose control and bound away across the fields, wildly waving its tail!

1277
02:06:21,312 --> 02:06:24,707
-当然，它会出错…-卡尔，你在干什么?
- Sure, it will make mistakes... - Carl, what are you doing?

1278
02:06:28,668 --> 02:06:29,886
嗯?
Huh?

1279
02:06:31,453 --> 02:06:33,498
——卡尔?-是的。
- Carl? - Yeah.

1280
02:06:36,110 --> 02:06:38,329
你的手在干什么?
What are you doing with your hand?

1281
02:06:41,115 --> 02:06:44,074
-哪一个?——认真?
- Which one? - Seriously?

1282
02:06:48,731 --> 02:06:50,951
我只是把它放在椅子上。
I'm just resting it on the chair.

1283
02:06:53,170 --> 02:06:56,391
你的手为什么放在她夹克下面的椅子上?
Why is your hand under her jacket on a chair?

1284
02:06:58,132 --> 02:06:59,612
什么……?
What...?

1285
02:07:00,656 --> 02:07:05,618
只是…我不知道，它就在那儿，就在……椅子上。
It was just... I don't know, it was there, resting on the side of... the chair.

1286
02:07:28,728 --> 02:07:31,644
我来了。我来了!
I'm coming. I'm coming!

1287
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:37,519
我来了……-哦，我无法集中精神…-天啊!
I'm coming... - Oh, I can't concentrate... - Oh, God!

1288
02:07:53,622 --> 02:07:59,193
好吧，你知道…如果你做不到，就告诉我，没人强迫你做任何事。
Okay, you know... if you can't handle it, just tell me, nobody's forcing you to do anything.

1289
02:07:59,236 --> 02:08:03,284
就是他妈的到处鬼鬼祟祟瞒着所有人。
It's just all this fucking sneaking around and hiding things from everyone.

1290
02:08:03,327 --> 02:08:06,591
太多了。这是……这变得难以忍受。
It's too much. It's... it's becoming unbearable.

1291
02:08:06,635 --> 02:08:10,378
我是说，他们显然对我们在这里做的事不满意。
I mean, they're obviously not happy with what we're doing in here.

1292
02:08:12,902 --> 02:08:17,254
好吧,所以…我们就……告诉他们真相。
Okay, so... Let's just... tell them the truth.

1293
02:08:20,693 --> 02:08:25,915
你给我东西，我也会给你东西作为回报。
You give me something, and I give you something in return.

1294
02:08:31,094 --> 02:08:33,706
你知道这让我陷入了什么境地吗?
You realize what position that puts me in?

1295
02:08:34,837 --> 02:08:36,056
不。
No.

1296
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:46,501
只是因为你是卖肉的，这一点更公开了，并不意味着他们会接受你用普通食物来嫖娼的事实。
Well, just because it's more open that you're a flesh peddler, it doesn't mean they're gonna accept the fact that you're buying sex with the common food.

1297
02:08:47,241 --> 02:08:54,204
哇……得了吧，我没有…你知道我为这个岛付出了多少心血吗?
Wow... Oh, come on, I didn't... Do you know the amount of work I put into this island?

1298
02:08:54,248 --> 02:08:57,381
我每天都去钓鱼，我生火……-我知道，我知道
I go fishing every day, I make fire... - I know, I know.

1299
02:08:57,425 --> 02:08:59,969
我要对这里的每个人负责!-我知道，对不起，我知道。
I'm responsible for everybody here! - I know, I'm sorry, I know.

1300
02:08:59,993 --> 02:09:04,084
这难道不是我的优势吗?-是啊，当然
Shouldn't that give me an advantage? - Yeah, yeah, of course.

1301
02:09:04,127 --> 02:09:07,783
好吧!-我知道你应该做你想做的。
Okay! - You deserve to do what you want, I know.

1302
02:09:15,835 --> 02:09:21,666
荒谬的是，如果我们是一对，他们不会在意我们在这里做了什么。
The absurd thing is that, if we were a couple, they wouldn't care what we did in here.

1303
02:09:24,582 --> 02:09:28,412
但是，真的，也许我们应该这么做，也许我们应该继续下去。
But, really, maybe we should just do that, maybe we should just get on with it.

1304
02:09:28,456 --> 02:09:31,372
我不知道，在公共场合亲吻一下，然后牵手。
I don't know, kiss a little bit in public and hold hands.

1305
02:09:31,415 --> 02:09:34,114
-那肯定更容易吧?-雅雅呢?
- Surely that would be easier? - What about Yaya?

1306
02:09:34,157 --> 02:09:38,248
我会和雅雅好好谈谈。我得像个成年人一样。
I would have a conversation with Yaya. I would have to be an adult about it.

1307
02:09:38,292 --> 02:09:42,992
然后弄清楚，但是…我想对她来说可能会容易些。
And figure it out, but... I think it would be easier for her, probably.

1308
02:09:43,036 --> 02:09:45,778
我是说，她还得处理这些流言蜚语。
I mean, she's having to deal with all this gossip as well.

1309
02:09:45,821 --> 02:09:48,041
卡尔,我…我不知道。
Carl, I... I don't know.

1310
02:09:56,701 --> 02:09:59,052
你想让我和雅雅分手吗?
Do you want me to break up with Yaya?

1311
02:09:59,095 --> 02:10:00,749
——没有。——不是吗?
- No. - No?

1312
02:10:02,925 --> 02:10:05,449
那是你的决定，不是我的。
That's your decision, not mine.

1313
02:10:08,322 --> 02:10:12,413
我不是要求你去做，我只是想看看你怎么想。
I'm not asking you to do it, I'm just seeing what you think about it.

1314
02:10:12,456 --> 02:10:16,069
我知道，但这并不意味着你可以把我放在你们之间。
I know, but that doesn't mean that you can put me in-between the two of you.

1315
02:10:16,112 --> 02:10:17,592
好吧,好吧。
Okay, okay.

1316
02:10:25,948 --> 02:10:34,696
这对你来说是一个完美的场景，我的意思是…你得到你想要的，你没有义务，没有责任，你知道的。
It's kind of a perfect scenario for you, I mean... You get what you want, you have no obligations, no responsibilities, you know.

1317
02:10:34,739 --> 02:10:36,872
你为什么要把每件事都弄得这么复杂?
Why do you have to make everything so complicated?

1318
02:10:36,916 --> 02:10:40,354
因为我觉得我需要知道这是怎么回事，阿比盖尔。
Because I feel like I need to know where this is going, Abigail.

1319
02:10:42,878 --> 02:10:44,880
让我们玩得开心点。
Let's just have fun.

1320
02:10:44,924 --> 02:10:47,187
没有，但我得试着处理这个情况。
No, but I need to try to deal with this situation.

1321
02:10:47,230 --> 02:10:49,232
我…我不想惹毛你…
I... I don't wanna piss off...

1322
02:10:51,582 --> 02:10:53,846
我不想再烦任何人了。
I don't wanna annoy anyone anymore.

1323
02:10:56,152 --> 02:10:59,939
你还记得你来这里的第一晚说了什么吗?
Do you remember what you said the first night you were here?

1324
02:10:59,982 --> 02:11:01,766
你说什么?
What did you say?

1325
02:11:03,899 --> 02:11:06,684
“我爱你，你给我鱼。”
"I love you, you give me fish."

1326
02:11:06,728 --> 02:11:08,338
完全正确。
Exactly.

1327
02:11:08,382 --> 02:11:11,733
你知道为什么这么美吗?
And do you know why that is so beautiful?

1328
02:11:11,776 --> 02:11:15,737
——没有。-就像你…——为什么?-因为这是事实
- No. - Like you... - Why? - Because it's the truth.

1329
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,876
所以,纳尔逊……你是海盗，是吗?
So, Nelson... you're a pirate, huh?

1330
02:11:25,442 --> 02:11:27,183
别这样，别这样。
Come on, stop it.

1331
02:11:29,359 --> 02:11:32,623
好的。如果我是海盗，你会问我什么?
Okay. If I was a pirate, what would you ask me?

1332
02:11:32,667 --> 02:11:35,017
你挣多少钱?
How much money do you make?

1333
02:11:36,410 --> 02:11:38,238
是的，当然。
Yeah, of course.

1334
02:11:38,281 --> 02:11:41,632
我不知道，就像…3000欧元。
I don't know, like... 3,000 euros.

1335
02:11:41,676 --> 02:11:43,896
-一次攻击?-是的，一次攻击。
- On one attack? - Yeah, one attack.

1336
02:11:44,853 --> 02:11:46,507
如果我们成功了。
If we succeed.

1337
02:11:47,551 --> 02:11:50,641
这么说，你是拿佣金的咯?
So, you work on commission, huh?

1338
02:11:50,685 --> 02:11:52,643
-是的。——屎!
- Yeah. - Shit!

1339
02:11:52,687 --> 02:11:54,907
客户赚的都是钱?
The client is making all money?

1340
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:59,085
是啊，但如果你有自己的船你可以赚更多。
Yeah, but you can make more if you have your own boat.

1341
02:12:01,565 --> 02:12:05,047
3000欧元……得了吧，你疯了。
3,000 euros... Come on, you're crazy.

1342
02:12:06,092 --> 02:12:08,529
我女朋友很贵。
My girlfriend is expensive.

1343
02:12:08,572 --> 02:12:11,271
什么?你在你女朋友身上投资?
What? You invest in your girlfriend?

1344
02:12:11,314 --> 02:12:16,015
-是的。——啊……你应该反过来做。
- Yeah. - Ah... You should do it the other way around.

1345
02:12:16,058 --> 02:12:19,409
投资生意，买条船，姑娘们就会来找你。
Invest in business, buy a boat, and the girls will come to you.

1346
02:12:19,453 --> 02:12:20,541
是吗?
Yeah?

1347
02:12:21,281 --> 02:12:23,587
当然，我知道。哈哈!
Sure, I know. Ha-ha!

1348
02:12:39,386 --> 02:12:41,214
嘿。
Hey.

1349
02:12:41,257 --> 02:12:44,173
我在想能不能借你的背包。
I was just wondering if I could borrow the backpack.

1350
02:12:44,217 --> 02:12:46,915
——阿比盖尔?-是的，我知道。
- Abigail? - Yeah, I know.

1351
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:50,266
你打算怎么办，亚亚?-去爬山。
What are you going to do, Yaya? - Go for a hike over the mountain.

1352
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:52,486
看看我能不能找到什么。
See if I can find something.

1353
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:59,580
-我和你一起去。-没关系，我可以自己去。
- I'll go with you. - It's okay, I can go by myself.

1354
02:12:59,623 --> 02:13:03,453
不，雅雅，你一个人去不安全。我和你一起去。
No, Yaya, it's not safe for you to go alone. I'll go with you.

1355
02:13:04,933 --> 02:13:06,326
好的。
Okay.

1356
02:13:10,808 --> 02:13:14,899
-你想让我去吗?——没有。你待在这儿。
- Do you want me to come? - No. You stay here.

1357
02:13:14,943 --> 02:13:16,989
我需要和她独处一会儿。
I need some time alone with her.

1358
02:13:17,032 --> 02:13:18,512
——是吗?-是的。
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1359
02:13:24,605 --> 02:13:26,346
我买了。
I'll take it.

1360
02:13:54,287 --> 02:13:56,506
我很高兴我们能一起做这件事，雅雅。
I'm glad we're doing this together, Yaya.

1361
02:13:58,552 --> 02:13:59,988
我也是。
Me, too.

1362
02:14:00,858 --> 02:14:06,255
我其实是想告诉你我…你在这里所做的一切让我印象深刻。
I actually wanted to tell you that I'm... really impressed by everything you're doing here.

1363
02:14:07,169 --> 02:14:10,999
我是说，你成功地管理了一个母系社会，阿比盖尔。
I mean, you managed to run a fucking matriarchy, Abigail.

1364
02:14:18,746 --> 02:14:21,879
你驯服了所有的老男人。
You domesticated all the old alpha males.

1365
02:14:21,923 --> 02:14:23,316
是啊!
Yeah!

1366
02:14:26,188 --> 02:14:27,537
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1367
02:14:31,454 --> 02:14:33,456
不，它真的很令人印象深刻。
No, it's really impressive.

1368
02:14:41,595 --> 02:14:44,032
我们应该在一起，对吧?
We should stick together, huh?

1369
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,494
哦，我的天啊……
Oh, my God...

1370
02:15:14,497 --> 02:15:17,239
我觉得从这里开始应该会容易一些。
I think it should be a little easier from here.

1371
02:16:54,554 --> 02:16:56,599
不行,不行。
Nein, nein.

1372
02:16:58,732 --> 02:17:00,212
嗯?
Huh?

1373
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:48,738
阿比盖尔!
Abigail!

1374
02:17:48,782 --> 02:17:50,218
是吗?
Yeah?

1375
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:53,265
我看见了什么!
I see something!

1376
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:59,923
一个什么?
A what?

1377
02:18:01,795 --> 02:18:04,711
我听不见!
I can't hear you!

1378
02:18:07,931 --> 02:18:11,065
——阿比盖尔!快点!-我来了!
- Abigail! Hurry up! - I'm coming!

1379
02:18:12,284 --> 02:18:14,547
——阿比盖尔!——亚亚!
- Abigail! - Yaya!

1380
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:20,292
亚亚!
Yaya!

1381
02:18:20,335 --> 02:18:21,728
阿比盖尔!
Abigail!

1382
02:18:23,425 --> 02:18:26,907
阿比盖尔!阿比盖尔，有电梯!
Abigail! Abigail, there's an elevator!

1383
02:18:29,649 --> 02:18:32,042
-这是个度假胜地，阿比盖尔!-什么?
- It's a resort, Abigail! - A what?

1384
02:18:32,086 --> 02:18:33,740
这是一个度假胜地!
It's a resort!

1385
02:18:37,396 --> 02:18:41,400
来,看!这是一个豪华度假村!
Come, look! It's a luxury resort!

1386
02:18:45,839 --> 02:18:48,189
它一直都在那里!
It's been there the whole time!

1387
02:18:48,232 --> 02:18:51,410
它一直都在那，阿比盖尔!
It's been there the whole fucking time, Abigail!

1388
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:06,686
来了。
Come.

1389
02:19:09,863 --> 02:19:13,040
来,阿比盖尔。来了。
Come, Abigail. Come.

1390
02:19:20,613 --> 02:19:22,005
阿比盖尔?
Abigail?

1391
02:19:24,312 --> 02:19:26,488
让我们享受这一刻。
