3
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,927
That's a beautiful pig.

4
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,140
Only the best, Father.

5
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,767
This way, Father.

6
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,668
The boy is showing all the classical signs
of possession, Father Amorth.

7
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,755
Has the family consulted a doctor?

8
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,966
Many, many doctors.

9
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,137
What are the signs of possession?

10
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,015
He converses in English, Father.

11
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,226
Has he spoken English before?

12
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,187
Never. Not once before.

13
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,190
Do they own a television?

14
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,150
Yes, I believe so.

15
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,487
Okay, thank you.

16
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,330
What are you drawing?

17
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,623
A bird.

18
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,545
That's good, kid.

19
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,717
I have a very important job for you.

20
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,555
Do you know the Our Father?

21
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,600
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

22
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,648
You can help your brother.

23
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:15,821
Repeat the Our Father, over and over.

24
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:21,410
Don't get distracted.
Relentless. Understood?

25
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,663
Yes, Father.

26
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,331
Good.

27
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:34,423
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

28
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,846
Bring me the pig.

29
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,635
Difficult to believe.

30
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,685
If you are Satan, what is my name?

31
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,148
Describe hell.

32
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,948
Are you avoiding my questions?

33
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,959
Answer me, Satan.

34
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,924
Why possess this boy?

35
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,551
Why not someone more influential?

36
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,394
Could you possess Father Gianni?

37
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,605
A bishop?

38
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,380
Have you possessed him, Satan?

39
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,217
Have you possessed it, Satan?

40
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,646
Be calm.

41
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,942
God blesses you.

42
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:35,515
Why do you think Saint Michael didn't
kill Satan when he had the chance?

43
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,240
Yes, of course.

44
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,122
Hold this.

45
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,303
At this time of the day? Are you crazy?

46
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,557
Double espresso, Sister.

47
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,809
Thank you.

48
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,522
Sugar is the work of the devil.
No, thank you.

49
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,944
Thank you very much.

50
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,449
Let's get on with this already.

51
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,917
All right, let's go.

52
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,678
It wasn't a--

53
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,009
I can't wait to finish this job.
This place freaks me out.

54
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,436
What is it?

55
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,065
I don't know. Can't see anything.

56
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,348
Come on, let's go. Come on, everybody out.

57
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,976
Quick, quick.

58
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,048
- Is that you, Gabriele?
- Yes, Holy Father.

59
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,259
They tell me you are sick.

60
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,595
Yes, they hope so.

61
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,348
They wish to see me weak.

62
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,433
But, no, they are.

63
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,605
- Help me.
- Yes.

64
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:11,213
Perhaps we've done our jobs too well.

65
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,924
Cardinal Sullivan
and the younger generation,

66
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,052
they don't believe in the devil
as we understand it.

67
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:23,767
It's only an idea for them.
For us, it is very real.

68
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,478
Two hundred fallen angels,

69
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:30,107
expelled from heaven, driven beneath
the soil where God is not welcomed.

70
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,110
It is not a fairytale.

71
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:38,073
Your search for truth
is delightful, Gabriele,

72
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,994
but pay attention
to your desire to educate.

73
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,415
Pride manifests itself in different forms.

74
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,419
Pride? Me?

75
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,251
Father.

76
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:40,505
Good morning.
I'm Father TomÃ¡s Esquibel.

77
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,841
- Spanish?
- Yes.

78
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,428
I am Father Amorth. Italian.

79
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,140
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
I am Father Amorth.

80
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,852
Gabriele, how are you?

81
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,402
Yes, yes.

82
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,642
Very nice, this.

83
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,187
Our Father, who art in heaven,

84
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,358
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be--

85
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,287
God is not here.

86
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,498
God is everywhere.

87
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,791
Show yourself, coward.

88
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,087
Show yourself.

89
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,631
Coward.

90
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,176
Show yourself, coward.

91
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,525
Yes.

92
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,944
And may the souls
of all the faithful departed,

93
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,781
through the mercy of God,
rest in peace.

94
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,875
The scent of heaven.

95
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:27,571
The abbey's records, Your Holiness.

96
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:05,140
God, by your name...

97
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,561
save me.

98
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,028
In the name of Christ, let her go.

99
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,405
In the name of Christ, let her go.

100
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,120
In the name of Christ, let her go.

101
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:02,044
In the name of Christ,
go away, Satan, go away!

102
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:22,489
"Your cardinal protector writes
to inform you of our worst fears.

103
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:26,993
A great evil has taken hold
of San Sebastian Abbey.

104
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,871
It must be buried here forever."

105
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,220
"All attempts at exorcism have failed.

106
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,724
Satan owns this ground now.

107
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:38,189
I have never seen
a demon this powerful before."

108
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:11,032
You are just agitated.

109
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:03,984
Almighty God.

110
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:43,712
God, by your name, save me.

111
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:48,592
Judge me in thy strength.

112
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:51,720
O God, hear my prayer.

113
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:54,848
Listen to the words of my mouth.

114
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:58,393
Behold, God is my helper.

115
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:47,956
Yes, Your Holiness.

116
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:02,887
Yeah, not too bad.

117
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:23,908
Thank you very much, Your Holiness.
