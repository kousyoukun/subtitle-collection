00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,222
You told me yourself

315
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:28,281
it was some dumb game
for mama's boys and flakes.

316
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:29,616
[laughs]

317
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,095
Hell ,
I never played no big con .

318
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,631
I hung around and
picked up a few things.

319
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,261
Ain't no rich boys
gonna trust

320
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,270
a hungry nigger
enough to be conned .

321
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,529
But I'll tell you

322
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,774
I've been
looking for this one
all my life, Johnny.

323
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,540
Now I have a chance
to step out when I'm ahead .

324
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,774
Come on ! What would
you do with yourself?

325
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,011
Oh , I have a brother
down in K. C . ,

326
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,645
runs a freight outlet.

327
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,518
I can go halfsies with him .

328
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:03,118
It ain't too exciting ,
but it's mostly legal .

329
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,897
I got an old friend in Chicago
named Henry Gondorff.

330
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,660
I want you to look him up .

331
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,930
There ain't
a better inside man alive.

332
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,664
He'll teach you
all you got to know.

333
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,263
To hell with that.

334
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,810
I want to work
with you , Luther.

335
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,277
I'm out, Johnny.

336
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,514
Yeah , sure. lf that's
the way you want it.

337
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,620
That's the way I want it.

338
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,289
How do you like
that Coleman?

339
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,024
After five years.

340
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,066
Come on ,
it was the only thing to do.

341
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,432
He knew he was
holding you back.

342
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,732
Yeah ,
but we were partners.

343
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,364
lf it weren't for Luther,
I'd still be
hustling pinball .

344
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,930
I don't need any more
than what I got.

345
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,376
Well , you won't have anything
if you don't lay off
the games of chance.

346
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,878
There's a depression on ,
you know.

347
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,311
There's always
a depression on .

348
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,747
lf you saved a little bit,
you wouldn't have to grift.

349
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,148
I like grifting .

350
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,686
Maybe you could buy
yourself some things.

351
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,516
What?
Clean clothes , a car.

352
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,420
I got clothes, and
I don't know how to drive.

353
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,253
[tires screeching]
What else
do you got to sell?

354
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,224
All right. Forget it.

355
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,922
(Snyder)
Hey, Hooker!
Come on , you son of a. . .

356
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:16,990
[pants]

357
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,664
Oh , hi there , Snyder.

358
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:19,669
What's the matter?

359
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,638
Things a little slow
down at the bunco department
tonight, huh?

360
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,003
Somebody lose the dominoes?

361
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,203
You scored blood money today,
Hooker, you need a friend .

362
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,609
Go find yourself
a shoplifter to roll .

363
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,883
You got the wrong guy, pal .

364
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,046
I've been home
with the flu all day.

365
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,951
You can stake out
my toilet if you want.

366
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,321
(Snyder)
Keep talking !

367
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,427
[coughs]

368
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,239
I'll tell you what
you did , smart boy.

369
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:01,203
You tied into a loaded mark
on 47th across from Maxie's.

370
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,342
And you and Coleman
played the switch for him

371
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,849
and blew him off
to a cab on 49th .

372
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,746
lf he hadn't been
a numbers runner
for Doyle Lonnegan ,

373
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,912
it would've been perfect.

374
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,719
You're crazy.

375
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,020
I ain't stupid enough
to play for no rackets money.

376
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,120
Not intentionally, maybe.

377
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,589
That don't cut no ice
with Lonnegan .

378
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,097
He'll swat you
like a fly.

379
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,431
Yeah , well ,

380
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,170
Well , I'll square it
with the fixer.

381
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,300
Nobody can buy you a prayer
if I put the finger on you .

382
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,778
Now, I figure
your end of the score
was at least $3 , 000 .

383
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,974
I want $2, 000 ,
no matter what it was.

384
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,608
My take was only $ 1 , 000 .

385
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,382
Then you're gonna have
to come up with another
$ 1 , 000 somewhere .

386
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,790
All right.

387
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,970
You're a smart egg ,
Hooker.

388
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,982
No sense getting dead
over $2, 000 .

389
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,053
Relax, Erie.
I'll bill you .

390
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,339
I thought you blew
all your money.

391
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,603
I did .

392
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,500
The stuff I gave him
is counterfeit.

393
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,740
They'll spot it
the first place
he tries to spend it.

394
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,340
Are you crazy,
giving him counterfeit money?

395
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,517
Hey, wait up !
Where you going?

396
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:01,757
I'll tell you !

397
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,605
What the hell
are you gonna do

398
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,406
if Snyder puts
the finger on you , huh?

399
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,878
You're committing
suicide, kid .

400
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,278
Christ, what difference
does it make?

401
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,317
lf Snyder knows about us ,
so does everybody else.

402
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,182
He never
gets anything first.

Don't go back
to your place tonight.

00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,548
Don't go anyplace
you usually go.

407

You hear me?

408
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,789
Damn ! There's no answer
at Luther's.

409
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,091
Look,
you better get out of town

I don't know.
There was a big fight.

I don't know.

422
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,605

474
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:28,422
He was the best street worker
I ever saw.

475
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,159
He had you down
as a big-timer.

476
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,493
What happened?

477
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:41,738
I conned
a senator from Florida
on a stock deal .

478
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:45,566
A real lop-ear.
Thought he was gonna
take over General Electric.

479
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:49,474
Some chanteuse
woke him , though ,
and he put the feds on me.

480
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,876
You mean you blew it.

481
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,947
Luther didn't tell me
you had a big mouth .

482
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,646
He didn't tell me
you was a screw-up , either.

483
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,356
(Johnny)
You played any
big cons since then?

484
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:13,163
Oh , I lammed around
a bunch of bohunk towns,

485
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,263
one kick ahead of the G-men .

486
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:18,506
Would be still ,
if Billie hadn't
set me up here.

487
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,879
Don't kid yourself, friend .
I still know how.

488
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:33,555
Are you going to stay
for breakfast,

489
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,489
or do you already
know how to eat?

490
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,789
I picked something up
along the way.

491
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,262
ls Lonnegan after you , too?

492
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,533
I don't know.
I ain't seen anybody.

493
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,505
You never do, kid .

494
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,603
[Henry exclaiming]

495
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,377
[water bubbling]

496
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:06,014
Doyle?

497
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,015
Yeah .

498
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,857
We just talked to Chicago .

499
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,862
They got one of
the grifters last night.
A nigger.

500
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,557
How about the other one?

501
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,899
They're still
looking for him .

502
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,497
Who did Combs put on it?

503
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,199
He gave it to Riley and Cole .

504
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,367
They staked out
the other guy's place
last night,

505
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,809
but he never showed .

506
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,972
They figure maybe
he skipped town .

507
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,549
Do you want to
keep after him?

508
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,982
You see that fella
in the red sweater
over there?

509
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,020
(Doyle)
H is name's Danny McCoy.

510
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,114
Works a few of
the protection rackets
for Carnello

511
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,216
when he's waiting
for something better
to happen .

512
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:46,394
Danny and I have
known each other
since we were six.

513
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:51,861
Take a good look
at that face, Floyd .

514
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:56,331
Because if he ever finds out
I can be beat
by one lousy grifter,

515
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,931
I'll have to kill him
and every other hood

516
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,705
who wants to muscle in
on my Chicago operation .

517
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,214
You follow?

518
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,215
Yes, sir.

519
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,380
Good lad .

520
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:16,551
(Billie)
Hey, you feeling all right
this morning , Henry?

521
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:17,923
Yeah , fine.

522
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,486
Would you mind
opening up the round
a little early today?

523
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:22,896
We got some business
coming in before hours.

524
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:25,628
Sure .
And check the main gearing ,
will you?

525
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:29,434
Man O' War started
rattling yesterday
and threw a kid on its head .

526
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,174
Great little countess ,
that Billie.

527
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,177
She runs a spiffy house
up there, too.

528
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,874
You , uh , plan to spend
the rest of your life here?

529
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,916
I could do a lot worse.

530
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:49,290
Listen , Gondorff,
am I gonna learn to play
the big con or not?

531
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,652
What's your hurry?

532
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,752
I wanna play
for Lonnegan .

533
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,021
You know anything
about the guy?

534
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,167
Yeah , he croaked Luther.
Anything else I got to know?

535
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:07,102
All right.

536
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,003
He runs a numbers racket
on the South Side ,

537
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,171
he owns a packinghouse,
a few banks--

538
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:15,275
Yeah ,
and half the politicians
in New York and Chicago .

539
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,185
Not a fix in this
world gonna cool him out
if he blows on you .

540
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,018
I'll get him anyway.
Why?

541
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:23,492
'Cause I don't know enough
about killin' to kill him .

542
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,619
[train rumbling]

543
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,168
You can't do it alone,
you know.

544
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,806
It takes a mob of guys
and enough money
to make them look good .

545
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,008
I know plenty of guys.

546
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,074
It's not like playing winos.
You can't outrun a--

547
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,347
I never played
for no winos.

548
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,752
You've gotta keep his con
even after you take his money.

549
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,017
He can't know you took him .

550
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,352
You're scared of him .

551
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,894
Right down
to my socks, buster.

552
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,287
You're talkin' about a guy
who would kill a grifter

553
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:03,731
over a chunk of money
that wouldn't support
him for two days.

554
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,400
You're going to go for him .

555
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,131
I just don't want a hothead
looking to get even ,

556
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,641
coming back
halfway through saying ,

557
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:16,577
it ain't enough ,
'cause it's all
we're gonna get.

558
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,245
Can you get a mob together?

559
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,685
After what happened
to Luther,

560
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,280
I don't think I can get more
than 200 , 300 guys.

561
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,057
Â¶Â¶[music playing]

562
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,990
Luther said you learn fast.
I hope he's right.

563
00:32:49,468 --> 00:34:22,428
[inaudible]

564
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:40,384
Â¶Â¶[music continues]

565
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,684
Lonnegan gets
most of his income
from the numbers

566
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,379
even though he's been
putting more money

567
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,887
into his
savings-and-loan business.

568
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,981
You think he's moving
out of the racket?
No.

569
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,958
He owns most of
the stock that's traded .

570
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:20,223
But my guess is
he's just trying to build
himself a respectable image.

571
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,559
He came out of Five Points,

572
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,498
but he's been
telling everybody
he was born in Forest Hills.

573
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,126
He knows the market, though .

574
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:29,262
I don't think we can take him
on a stocks deal .

575
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,767
Twist,
what about the numbers?

576
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:34,777
Tipsters say it's run out of
a packinghouse on 14th
by a guy named Combs .

577
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,810
Lonnegan comes out
every three weeks
to check on it, but

578
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,180
he stays away from
the day-to-day stuff
in case it's raided .

579
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,514
These are two of Combs'
favorite torpedoes:
Riley and Cole .

580
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,055
You ever seen 'em?

581
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:51,222
No.
They're the ones
who hit Luther.

582
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:54,520
They also got
the numbers runner
you conned .

583
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,087
(Twist)
A guy named Mottola.

584
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,100
Found him in a quarry
with a knife in his eye.

585
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:02,469
Lonnegan's had
seven or eight people
rubbed on his way up .

586
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:04,871
His pattern has been
to get close to a racket boss,

587
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,205
learn the operation ,
then move in on it.

588
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,579
He's done it to Gorman ,
O'Donnell , Buchalman .

589
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,376
He took the numbers
from Sharkey.

590
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,244
All four of these guys
are dead .

591
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,618
He's vindictive
as hell , Henry.

592
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,449
Kills for pride.

593
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,218
Doesn't add up
he'd let Hooker
get away from him .

594
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:24,491
You see anything ,
kid , you let us know.

595
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,356
lf they put you on the spot,
we got to fold the con .
You got that?

596
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:31,695
Yeah . You sure it's got to be
one of these two guys?

597
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,927
No. They're just
the only ones we know of.

598
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:47,741
Time.

599
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:55,755
[woman laughing]

600
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:01,658
Set me up five more beers ,
will you , Danny?

601
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,731
You the owner here?
That's right.

602
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,266
Lt. Snyder, Bunco .

603
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:17,840
That's a Joliet badge,
Snyder.

604
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,676
Don't cut much up here.

605
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,478
Looking for a guy on the lam
from a counterfeiting rap .

606
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:23,883
Thought he might've
come in here.

607
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,944
Don't think so.
I know everyone in the place.

608
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,581
And I always bounce
the lamsters.

609
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,648
All right if
I look around in here?

610
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:33,321
No, but you're welcome
to a free beer before you go.

611
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,495
[people chattering]

612
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,899
I don't really
need your permission .

613
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,076
I don't know what to do
with this guy, Henry.

614
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:51,079
He's an lrishman
who doesn't drink,

615
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,047
doesn't smoke and
doesn't chase dames.

616
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,278
He's a grand knight
in the Knights of Columbus .

617
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,784
And he only goes
out to play faro.

618
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,377
Sometimes plays
1 5 to 20 hours at a time.

619
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,853
Just him against the house.

620
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:00,980
Roulette, craps?

621
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,216
He won't touch 'em .

622
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,921
The croupier at Gilman's says
he never plays
anything he can't win .

623
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:07,155
Sports?

624
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,358
Mmm , likes to be seen
with fighters sometimes,

625
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,491
but doesn't go to
the fights or bet on them .

626
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,635
Jesus. Does he do anything
where he's not alone?

627
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,302
Just poker.

628
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,631
And he cheats.

629
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,671
Pretty good at it, too.

630
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,611
Where does he play?

631
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:33,656
The porters say he
runs a braced game
on the Century Limited

632
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:35,521
when he comes out
here from New York.

633
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,456
$ 1 00 minimum , straight poker.

634
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:41,125
And a lot of high rollers
ride that train
just to play him .

635
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,726
That sounds good , J .J .

636
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,225
[people chattering]

637
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,267
Which way are the rooms?

638
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,503
Who told you
this guy was in here?

639
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,307
Nobody. I just know
what kind of woman
he likes.

640
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:58,814
I'm gonna check
all the joy houses
till I find him .

641
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,577
Well , maybe I could help you
if you tell me his name.

642
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,651
I doubt it.
Which way are the rooms?

643
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,048
Right through there.

644
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,056
But I wouldn't go in there
if I were you .

645
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,957
What are you gonna do,
call the cops?

646
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,790
I don't have to.

647
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:16,697
You'd be busting in
on the chief of police
just up the hall .

648
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,307
(Niles)
We'll play it out here.

649
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,675
And a huge duke is too simple.

650
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:32,647
With no fix,
we're gonna need a con
with a sure-fire blow-off.

651
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,979
I think we ought
to play this guy
on the payoff.

652
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,575
It's the tightest game
we got.

653
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,120
It's not all over
the papers yet.

654
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,677
(Twist)
Lonnegan is a fast egg ,
J .J .

655
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,747
He's not going to sit still
for a standard play.

656
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,087
(Niles)
So what does that leave us?

657
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,819
We can't con
the payoff to a banker.

658
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,630
We'll use the wire.

659
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,356
Haven't known
a poker player yet
didn't wanna beat the ponies.

660
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,162
The wire's been
out of date for 1 0 years.

661
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,896
That's why
he won't know it.

662
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,768
I'm not sure I know it.

663
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,473
It'll take two of us
working the inside.

664
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:01,174
Any objections
to Hooker as second man?

665
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,943
All right.
We'll give Lonnegan the hook

666
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,916
on the train
and play him here.

667
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:11,044
J .J . , you think I can
get in that poker game?

668
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,816
Just show up
with a lot of money
and look like a sucker.

669
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,255
I also gotta win .

670
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:19,422
Oh , by the way,
any of you guys been passing
bad money lately?

671
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,968
lf he comes in again ,
stall him so I can
get a look at him .

672
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,026
(Billie)
Mmm-hmm .

673
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,843
Fella by the name of Stenner
had this place until about
six months ago,

674
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,718
but he had to give it up .

675
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,421
It doesn't look so good
right now,

676
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,220
but maybe you can fix it up
a little bit.

677
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,920
Watch your step
when you come in .

678
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,723
There's a dip down
on the left.

679
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,105
How's it look, Eddie?

680
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,169
It looks all right, Kid .

681
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,045
It's big enough ,
and it's off the street.

682
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,412
I don't know.

683
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,543
It's kind of short notice.
I'm not sure

684
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,644
we can get it all
done by Saturday.

685
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,487
Got to . Gondorff's
riding the mark down
from New York on the Century.

686
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:23,815
We'll take it.

687
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26,191
That building
at the end of the alley,
do you manage that?

688
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,252
For 1 5 years.

689
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,093
I'll need a corner room
facing this way.

690
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,394
How much a week?

691
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:31,661
Only rents
by the month .

692
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,463
$250
for the two of them .

693
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,666
Last time I expect
to see you down here.

694
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:38,569
Never heard
of the place.

695
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,372
(Garfield)
It's been awhile since
I stocked the wire store.

696
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:43,378
Not many mobs
playing that anymore.

697
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:45,471
(Niles)
All we'll need
is the bookie setup for now.

698
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:47,516
All right.
I'll rent you everything

699
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,779
I've got in the warehouse
for $2, 000 .

700
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:53,789
That'll give you phones,
cages, blackboards
and ticker gear.

701
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:57,649
lf you want
a counter and bar,
that's another $ 1 , 000 .

702
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,286
That's pretty steep , Benny.

703
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,987
Gondorff's
still a hot item .

704
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,394
Where would I be
if he gets hit?

705
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:03,989
Benny, you just give us
what you can .

706
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,534
We'll send a truck down .

707
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,093
Now how do you want to
work this?
Flat rate or percentage?

708
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,194
Who's the mark?

709
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:10,396
Doyle Lonnegan .

710
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,936
Flat rate.

The guy in the black hat
with the gimp .

713
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,564
He's not as tough
as he thinks.

714
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,434
Neither are we.

715
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:52,971
Mr. Shaw?

716
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:54,016
That's right.

717
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,209
You wanted to see me?

718
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,652
I hear there's
a friendly poker game
on this train . Know about it?

719
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,052
Oh , a little .
Thank you , sir.

720
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,351
Can you get me
in that game?

721
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,584
Oh , I don't know.

722
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:04,717
There's usually
a waiting list.

723
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,429
That'll get you
first alternate, sir.

724
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,666
I'll see
what I can do.

How are you , Twist?

00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:35,622
I saw the Kid in Denver.

732
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,191
He says to say hello to you .

733
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:39,619
Joiner, are you still
working those shapes?

734

Any number
you want, Twist!

735

Good to see you again , Twist.

736
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:44,663
Okay, Lacey.
Good to see you .

Come on in .

When did you
get back in town?

740
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,670
A couple of days ago.

741
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:52,970
You heard about
Luther Coleman ,
didn't you?

742
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:54,635
Yeah ,
some of the boys
were passing the hat

743
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:55,973
for Alva and the kids.

744
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,877
I never seen the guys
so worked up .

745
00:43:57,936 --> 00:44:00,109
Well , don't worry
about it, Dukey.

746
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,844
We're gonna send
a little calling
card of our own .

747
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:05,080
Gondorff is
setting up a wire store
on the north side.

748
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,282
I'm gonna need a 20-man
boost right away.

749
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:09,085
I got plenty of talent
out there tonight.

You can take
your pick. Lace !

This is a tough one, Dukey.

got to be the quill .

Get me the sheet.
Let's see who's in town , huh?

No, I never saw him before.

You got lucky once.

Oh . Lucky, hell .
I can do it every time.

Why don't you then?

1278
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,768
'Cause it's better
to do it all at once.

We're gonna put down
$400 , 000 next week.

At 5-1 odds,
that's $2 million .

Twenty percent of that
is yours if you stick with it.

Got a system , Kelly?

1283
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,673
No. You can still lose
with a system .

You're gonna stay in?

1288
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:16,294
Not until
I get some answers.

1289
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,396
I got a partner downtown .

1290
01:19:23,493 --> 01:19:25,597
And he runs the central office
of the Western U nion .

1291
01:19:25,661 --> 01:19:27,902
Now, race results
from all over the country
come in there

1292
01:19:27,964 --> 01:19:30,137
and go across his desk
to the bookies.

1293
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:32,406
Now, all he does
is hold them up
for a couple of minutes

1294
01:19:32,468 --> 01:19:35,244
till he can call us,
get a bet down on the winner.

1295
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:37,306
Then he releases
the results to the bookies.

1296
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:40,479
We clean up on a race
that's already been run .
Now, you can't miss.

1297
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,784
Unless the Western Union dicks
get a hold of it.

1298
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:53,161
You got the $400 , 000 yet?

No, not yet, but. . .

Hey, there's only $ 1 , 000 here .

1301
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,132
Make another bet tomorrow.

1302
01:20:00,196 --> 01:20:01,902
What the hell is this?
Where's my money?

1303
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:03,101
I got $ 1 6 , 000 coming .

1304
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:04,269
You owe me
$ 1 5 , 000 already.

1305
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:07,439
Besides, if your setup's
as good as you say,
there's plenty more to come.

1306
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,913
I decide when to
place the bets !

1307

Not if you want me
to keep making them for you .

I gotta talk to my partner.

We can't afford
to expose too much .

1310
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,748
I'll talk to him myself.
No !

1311
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:17,985
You've been waiting
a long time for this, Kelly.

Don't ruin it for yourself.

out of it?

We've got a year-old

but it's a thin beef.

is pick up Hooker for us.

Why don't you
pick him up yourself?

Because if word gets out
that the feds are in on it,

1489

Gondorff will fold up
the whole thing .
