3
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:12,393
我从没读过这样的剧本...

4
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:14,463
但是其中主要人物之间的关系...

5
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,763
得到了观众的认可

6
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:19,003
这点我很认可

7
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:21,303
What do you
think of her, Han?

8
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:22,743
I'm trying not to, kid.

9
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:24,833
Good.

10
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:26,473
剧本包罗万象

11
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,813
既有幽默 也不失真诚

12
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:31,143
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

13
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:36,583
里面有海盗 有巫师
有农场男孩还有公主

14
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:40,113
And we had bickering robots,
and I thought, ''What's not to like?''

15
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:53,703
这种通俗的叙述方式让你可以...

16
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:58,043
进入人物的世界并享受这故事

17
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:03,283
星球大战的人物

18
00:01:03,283 --> 00:01:05,883
它变成了一种文化现象

19
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:07,353
它的主题 语句...

20
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:08,853
May the Force be with you.

21
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:10,823
和人物在全球数百万人心中...

22
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:13,623
刻下了烙印

23
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:17,563
尽管星球大战的宇宙似乎在...

24
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,823
George Lucas灵光一闪中形成...

25
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:22,963
它事实上与电影大相径庭

26
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,093
故事原先是关于Luke Starkiller

27
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:27,733
Starkiller在根本上是父亲...

28
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,713
双胞胎是他的孩子

29
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:36,583
最终发展为双胞胎之一...

30
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:39,013
与反派父亲的故事

31
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:42,453
我写了很多草稿
把故事翻来覆去...

32
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:44,283
设法找到合适的一种

33
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:47,483
尽管他们把故事设置在遥远的星系...

34
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:52,193
星球大战的人物包含了
神话传说中的经典原型

35
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:53,823
For luck.

36
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,303
Lucas花了两年多的时间写剧本...

37
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,343
仔细拼凑各部分

38
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,933
写剧本的时候
常常要移动人物

39
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:06,713
就像一套棋子
有主要角色...

40
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:09,303
有次要角色 有同伙...

41
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:12,213
有坏人还有党羽

42
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:16,243
你要移动他们
想办法把故事编好

43
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:20,763
为了让纸上的人物变成三维活物...

44
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,493
Lucas雇佣了插画家Ralph McQuarrie.

45
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:28,063
在创作科幻与奇幻故事时...

46
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,103
与一位插画家工作十分有益...

47
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:33,193
使大脑里的东西形象化...

48
00:02:33,273 --> 00:02:35,763
这样我就不用花大量时间...

49
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:38,213
描述所有的小细节

50
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,373
只要画一张画就行了
我与Ralph一同坐下...

51
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,973
我告诉他人物是什么
长什么样子...

52
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:47,283
让后他会画一系列草图

53
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:50,845
我看过草图跟他说
''不 我要这样 我要那样

54
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:52,353
眼睛要大一点
我要他小点''

55
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,863
有时候会完全不同

56
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:57,293
电影里最古老的原型人物...

57
00:02:57,363 --> 00:03:00,353
就是星球大战的英雄
Luke Skywalker

58
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:05,733
神话故事中没有任何特定人物...

59
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,703
直接与Luke Skywalker有联系

60
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:13,143
Luke Skywalker是一个英雄
他更像是众多...

61
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:18,583
传说与童话书中的普遍典型

62
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:21,583
例如Joseph Campbell写的『千面英雄』

63
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:23,993
Luke Skywalke是个狠角色...

64
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:27,183
因为那一类型角色的天性...

65
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:28,823
他们得是普通人

66
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:32,293
他们得让我们观众产生同感

67
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:34,493
He was the person
that we went on this journey with.

68
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:36,933
Luke Skywalker的有力造型...

69
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:41,203
注定能捕捉到一代影迷的想象...

70
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:45,773
要是他由Kenny Baker扮演
还会那么受欢迎吗?

71
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:48,443
我本把Luke Skywalker写成一个侏儒...

72
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:51,383
农场里的所有人

73
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,923
the aunt and the uncle
那一群人

74
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:55,513
都是小矮人

75
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:57,713
That boy is our last hope.

76
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:00,883
No, there is another.

77
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:03,953
双胞胎和他们父亲的故事

78
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,693
这自始至终都没改动

79
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:11,173
有一次 我让双胞胎中的女孩当英雄...

80
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:13,763
最终 我把它改成男性人物

81
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:16,903
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

82
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:20,003
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

83
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,173
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

84
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:25,813
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

85
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:29,383
讲述故事的方法之一就是
设置两个主要人物...

86
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:32,623
他们与对方完全相反
这样可以形成对比

87
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:36,823
Luke是一个理想主义的
天真农场男孩...

88
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,763
他即将走向世界

89
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,993
心中有一点慌乱
要承担责任

90
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,263
里面有个长者
一个向导和教育者...

91
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:47,743
带他启程 给与忠告

92
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:51,803
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

93
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:53,303
Alderaan?

94
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:56,583
通常还要设置一个同伙...

95
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:00,113
他的道德观等方面都与英雄相反

96
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:02,923
他们经常会意见不合
在这部电影中...

97
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:07,153
主题之一是同情与互助

98
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:10,193
无私对自私

99
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:12,663
一个人物十分无私...

100
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:14,963
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

101
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,593
另一个人物十分自私

102
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:20,003
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

103
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:22,603
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

104
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:25,873
我把他们放在一起
所以他们遇到情况时...

105
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,473
总会意见分歧

106
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:32,543
Han Solo是我们都希望能成为的人物

107
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,713
我认为大多数人
都觉得自己像Luke Skywalker...

108
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,083
但是我们都情愿当Han Solo

109
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:39,623
Lucas起先把Han Solo构想成...

110
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:42,853
一个巨大的绿皮怪物
长着大鳃

111
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,863
被Wookiees养大
Solo在早年与Chewbacca交了朋友...

112
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,423
他们在一起成为了星际海盗

113
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,933
Han Solo本来是一个穷凶极恶的人物

114
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:56,843
他本来是一个怪物
或是古怪的外星人

115
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:59,073
我最终决定他是人类...

116
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:01,543
这样他们三人间就能有更多关系

117
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:05,983
这就是Chewbacca是外星同伙的缘由

118
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:10,043
星球大战的几个人物
来源于神化传说...

119
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:12,393
Han Solo的同伙Chewbacca...

120
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:15,223
是受到了个人关系的启发

121
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,823
Chewbacca的原始灵感来自我的狗 Indiana

122
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:22,133
我写剧本的时候
她一直坐在我身边

123
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:24,963
她坐在我车里
当我的副驾驶员

124
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:28,163
她坐在车里的时候跟我一样高

125
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:30,733
她是阿拉斯加爱斯基摩狗
她非常大

126
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,743
我觉得那情景很有趣

127
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:35,573
当我想为Han Solo找外星副驾驶员时...

128
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:38,013
我立马就想到了Indiana.

129
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:42,143
有一张30年代的图片...

130
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:45,353
毛茸茸像猿的动物 George很喜欢

131
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:48,723
我说道 ''把他的脸画的更像松鼠或猫''

132
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:50,853
我们想画某一属动物的特征...

133
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,763
而不是某一个特定的动物品种

134
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,893
一开始 我们把他画得像狐猴

135
00:06:57,973 --> 00:07:02,433
之后 我画了一个下面长了乳房的生物

136
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:05,103
我去除了乳房
因为它不是女性

137
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:09,943
我加上了子弹带
给了他武器

138
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,353
电影制作的每一方面...

139
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:16,793
几乎都是协力完成的
星球大战的人物创作也是如此

140
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,123
我脑中产生一个主意...

141
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:21,823
我要某个人物 外星人 或者场景是什么样子

142
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:26,963
然后 我会告诉设计师我的想法...

143
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,193
让他画下来 使之形象化

144
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:32,103
- I got him!
- Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

145
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:35,973
接着 我要把画稿交给美术部门...

146
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:38,913
或是道具部门 或是化妆部门...

147
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:40,973
他们会把它转化成...

148
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:45,413
真实的 机械的 塑料的或毛制的实体

149
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:55,763
在那时候 我们并没有能力做动画...

150
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,733
所以我决定 Chewbacca将由...

151
00:07:57,803 --> 00:08:00,763
一个高大的人穿着外套表演

152
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:05,663
他们说那东西毛多个大 就这么多

153
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:08,643
我们到了那里 参观了一下...

154
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:12,513
Ralph McQuarrie站在那里
拿着一张尼安德塔人的图画

155
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:17,743
区别在于Ralph让Chewie穿上了...

156
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:21,083
百慕大短裤和背心

157
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:25,523
I had no choice.

158
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:27,153
What are you doing?
Trust him!

159
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,963
为了让Chewbacca的面部表情可信...

160
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:34,093
Lucas求助于行业中少数的专家之一

161
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:38,033
我与Stuart Freeborn合作
他在(太空奥德赛)2001里制作了猿人

162
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:41,093
我认为他的作品很棒
而且 既然我们有Wookiee...

163
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:46,943
我说道 ''我们要用2001里的相同技术制作猿人''

164
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:48,953
356 第四次

165
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,073
他把Ralph的画稍作改动...

166
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:55,123
并让Peter Mayhew扮演

167
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:58,683
他的身体结构
他的行走方式

168
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:00,493
他的眼睛

169
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:04,863
测量他的实际骨架结构
去制作戏服...

170
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:08,833
和能机械运动的脸
改变了设计

171
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:11,203
现实情况改变了设计

172
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:14,803
当你有个设计思路
想把它投入现实...

173
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,743
大多数时候
特别是在早期...

174
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:19,473
一切都会改动

175
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:22,883
现在 有了数字技术
构思了某个东西...

176
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,683
设计了某个东西
让其原汁原味地出来就容易多了

177
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,623
但是在从前
没有这回事

178
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:31,353
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

179
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:35,093
给了我星球大战开头灵感的电影之一...

180
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:36,893
是黑泽明的『战国英豪』

181
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:43,133
讲的是两个处于封建日本社会底层的农民

182
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,458
Matashichi, this is hell.

183
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,300
It's the end!

184
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,823
If we're going to die,
let's die together.

185
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:55,673
与将军和公主同行

186
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:57,683
贵族阶级的人

187
00:09:58,393 --> 00:09:59,764
Just prepare the rice.

188
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:03,963
Shut up. I can't take it anymore.
You can stuff your orders.

189
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:06,323
故事是从他们的角度讲述的

190
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:06,547
I'm not one of them.

191
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:10,793
从最低的社会阶层来看这场冒险...

192
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:14,733
这场发生在最宏大的国际外交层面上的冒险

193
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:18,263
他们被设计成一种Mutt and Jeff...

194
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:20,944
- Don't kick the stones.
- You stop grabbing my leg.

195
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:22,863
Abbott and Costello Laurel and Hardy
对电影的戏剧性调剂

196
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:25,243
I've just about had enough of you.

197
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:27,403
Go that way.

198
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:30,413
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

199
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,053
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

200
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:34,643
because you won't get it.

201
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:39,213
要喜剧性调剂有效果
你得创造两个迥然不同的人物...

202
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:42,153
我设置了一个小astrodroid...

203
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,393
与人类没有任何相似之处...

204
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:47,453
另一个是更高雅的翻译droid...

205
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,633
它被赋予人形...

206
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:52,533
被编程 使之能更好地与人类交流

207
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:55,803
I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

208
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,473
This is my counterpart, R2-D2.

209
00:10:58,543 --> 00:10:59,913
Hello.

210
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:05,013
我要为3PO找一个非常高雅复杂的设计构思...

211
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,853
因为3PO来自于一个更高雅复杂的环境

212
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:12,323
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

213
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:18,333
3PO的早期构思
受到了『大都会』中机器人的启发

214
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:22,823
3PO要看起来像『大都会』中的机器人
不过是个男子...

215
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:27,173
我画了一幅
3PO和R2穿越沙漠的画...

216
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:30,503
你可以在其背景看到他们的太空舱

217
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,983
创造3PO最困难的事情之一...

218
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:39,183
就是得做一个完全中性的脸...

219
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:43,483
这样我才能让它读入不同情景中...

220
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,993
表达的各种情绪

221
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:50,053
我雇了一个女雕刻家
她做了一系列头像...

222
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,863
设法做一个完全中性的头像...

223
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:54,803
上面完全没有任何情绪

224
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:57,393
我要它所有的反应...

225
00:11:57,473 --> 00:12:01,203
都来源于它周围的环境和情节...

226
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,973
如果他开心
你就能从他的脸上读出喜悦

227
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,013
如果他伤心
你就能从他的脸上读出悲伤

228
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:10,043
完全不被他的脸部构造所歪曲

229
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:13,313
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

230
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:15,013
Come out,
before somebody sees you.

231
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:18,593
我本来要他像个...

232
00:12:18,663 --> 00:12:21,423
油嘴滑舌的二手车经销商或推销员

233
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:24,433
他要更像个推销员
总是想讨好别人

234
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:26,363
总是说大道理

235
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:29,963
-Can you speak Bocce?
-Of course. It's like a second language.

236
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,333
-All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
-Shutting up, sir.

237
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:35,133
当Tony Daniels来了之后

238
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,543
他是个好演员
他操着英国口音

239
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:43,483
我爱上了那口音
我试过很多不同的人

240
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:48,283
我试过二手汽车经销商
我试过推销员

241
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:51,913
无一奏效 除了Tony他那种烦人的英国管家

242
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:55,223
到星球大战摄影棚的第一天...

243
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,663
他们才刚好完成戏服...

244
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,963
我穿上之后...

245
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:05,033
我对场记员说
''请你拿块偏光板来...

246
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,603
把它举高''

247
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:12,473
通过那小眼睛
And through the little eyes, I looked
at a little Polaroid of myself...

248
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,413
and that's where I really learned
totally what I looked like for the day.

249
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:18,853
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

250
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,653
you'd probably
short-circuit.

251
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:24,923
我们首先见到3PO时
他通体金黄

252
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:27,393
摄影棚里摆亮闪闪的东西很危险...

253
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:30,593
因为它会反射所有东西
从外面开着的补给车...

254
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:32,193
到端茶小姐 到护士

255
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:36,323
而且 George的世界充满了
粪料 骨头和尘土...

256
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:40,563
所以3PO满身污泥
完全违背他的本性 当然

257
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:43,473
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

258
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:47,343
I've got such a bad case of dust
contamination I can barely move.

259
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:50,143
他总是在结尾时被擦亮
这在星球大战中...

260
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,813
是一种演出结束 大步行走之装

261
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:55,013
总是被擦得亮闪闪的

262
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,093
3PO有趣的一点是
他没有灵魂

263
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:04,053
他被编程要以特定方式思考
并富有同情心...

264
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,063
但他并不知道那是什么意思

265
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:09,223
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

266
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:12,573
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.

267
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,093
有时候他会很沮丧
有许多类人品质...

268
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:20,013
但是他没有可独自思考的主要部位

269
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,673
Darth Vader 另一方面
他变得越来越机械化...

270
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:27,553
他丧失越来越多的能力
甚至不能像人一样思考

271
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,953
起先 有好父亲和坏父亲

272
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:42,233
好父亲是Anakin Starkiller
坏父亲是Darth Vader

273
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:46,173
在写剧本的时候
那两个人物稍微变换了位置

274
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:51,333
我思来想去
最终他们合并成了一个人物

275
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:55,673
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

276
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:57,343
He told me enough.

277
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:01,823
He told me you killed him.

278
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,683
I am your father.

279
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:14,993
将古代传说中好坏父亲合并的决定...

280
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:17,473
创造了一个难以忘怀的人物...

281
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:21,873
由于他处于人和机器之间的本性
此人物得到了提升

282
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:26,643
Darth Vader弃人从机器...

283
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:31,653
他不断丧失自己的灵魂
丧失自己的人性...

284
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,083
这是主题

285
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:38,053
Darth Vader这人物
Lucas的最初设计构思...

286
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,923
来自于阿拉伯半岛的贝都因武士

287
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:43,623
George进来向我描述Darth Vader...

288
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,393
一个迎着风 飘忽不定的轮廓

289
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:49,233
十分黑暗 幽灵般的人物

290
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:53,933
他可能戴着一个大头盔
就像中古时期的日本武士

291
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:57,773
McQuarrie很快意识到星际旅行...

292
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,873
会影响到他的人物设计

293
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:05,413
他的解决方案成了Darth Vader最险恶的特点之一

294
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:07,643
他要从一个太空船而来...

295
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:10,783
在走道中炸开一个洞...

296
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:13,723
从而进入另一个太空船

297
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:15,783
我开始为他担心...

298
00:16:15,863 --> 00:16:20,063
不穿太空服而穿过真空太空

299
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,793
George不太情愿地说道...

300
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:24,803
''那就去给他加上呼吸面罩''

301
00:16:24,873 --> 00:16:29,033
我每做一件事
做到一定程度 他就会说...

302
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,343
''好了 就这样
我们继续去做其它事'

303
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:34,273
Darth Vader就此了结...

304
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:37,513
电影里的他与我画的差不多

305
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:45,683
George Lucas的成就
与托尔金一样

306
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:47,923
他创造了值得纪念的人物

307
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,093
You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

308
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:56,103
我认为他碰触到了
非常有力和根本的东西

309
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:57,793
I'm not afraid.

310
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:00,343
You will be.

311
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:05,843
今日想起星球大战
电影最初播放的25年后...

312
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:08,073
你会记不起那些特技

313
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:12,313
但是你记得那些人物
Darth Vader和Han Solo...

314
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:14,983
和Yoda和Luke Skywalker还有Chewbacca.

315
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:17,153
人物留了下来

316
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:20,713
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

317
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:22,823
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

318
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:26,003
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

319
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:28,903
平心而论 你要从George...

320
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:32,563
对于人性和电影理解的才华讲起

321
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:34,993
There's nothing for me here now.

322
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:37,943
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

323
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:41,853
这些神话经受了时间的考验...

324
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:44,517
被观众们所喜爱

325
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:50,083
因为其中的人物
在构思和扮演上都非常美妙

326
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,023
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

327
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:56,223
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.

328
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:05,103
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

329
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:10,633
Can anyone?

330
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:17,173
That's my face.

331
00:18:21,623 --> 00:18:24,353
I thought that was
a deer's ass in here.

332
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:28,193
Cut!

333
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,893
Cheer them on, guys.
Cheer them on.

334
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:34,523
Try and climb up,
get back down again.

335
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:37,163
Beat the-- out of them!

336
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:44,343
And cut.

337
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:16,493
他是你最爱的坏人
他是个切实的反派角色

338
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:18,863
它要么让你害怕 要么让你激动

339
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:21,023
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

340
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,433
那呼吸声让人胆寒

341
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,103
第三部在根本上讲的是...

342
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,543
Anakin Skywalker如何变成了Darth Vader...

343
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:35,443
我认为大家都在等待这故事

344
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:37,743
这是Anakin终结的开头

345
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:42,313
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

346
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:48,814
the return of
Darth Vader

347
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:53,063
我回过头来拍前传讲述...

348
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,293
Anakin Skywalker如何变成了Darth Vader

349
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:58,533
是因为这故事很有趣 很有娱乐性...

350
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:01,903
是因为它讲述了
一个好人变坏的历程

351
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:05,673
他从一个伶俐聪明...

352
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:07,683
富有爱心和同情心的小男孩...

353
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:10,943
发展成一个细心 刻苦...

354
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,713
但野心勃勃的Padawan learner...

355
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:17,813
他觉得因为自己who feels that
because he's better at being a Jedi...

356
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:20,053
and his Jedi skills
than most of the otherJedi...

357
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:23,393
所以应该进步得更深更快

358
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:26,553
In some ways--
a lot of ways--

359
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:30,233
I'm really ahead of him.

360
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:33,793
等他进步了 他无法控制自己的脾气...

361
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:37,333
他想控制事物的贪欲
这使他走向了毁灭

362
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:47,813
他陷入原力黑暗面经过了周密安排...

363
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,853
源自于十分具有人性的事情

364
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:53,583
他陷入爱河
他即将成为一个父亲...

365
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,353
他嫉妒了

366
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:57,923
我不清楚
我们把事情混成一团...

367
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:01,093
因为我们都年轻天真
无法退一步...

368
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:03,163
然后说 ''哦 不 没关系的''

369
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,063
Put the ship down!

370
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,703
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

371
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,923
Anakin从始到终的问题就是...

372
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:30,023
他不愿意放手

373
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:32,363
I don't want things to change.

374
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,453
But you can't stop the change.

375
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,933
当他不断寻求更多力量
去改变人们的命运...

376
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:39,973
让那些人按他的意思过

377
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:44,363
试图拯救所爱之人的贪欲...

378
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,763
变成了控制宇宙的能力

379
00:21:58,113 --> 00:22:01,203
第三部现在缺少一部分...

380
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:05,113
那是第三部关键的一部分
也是大家一直想看到的...

381
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:10,143
就是Anakin Skywalker穿上suit的回归

382
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,093
面部 构思...

383
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:22,533
Ralph McQuarrie早前的灵感还在...

384
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:25,433
我们试图忠于原作

385
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:28,333
看到原始头盔后...

386
00:22:28,403 --> 00:22:31,243
我们发现它的形状不对称

387
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:34,373
我们有机会把它做得更对称...

388
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:37,303
这就是我们要做的

389
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:45,983
所有细节都在这板上...

390
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:48,583
所以我们花了很多时间
把这一侧弄漂亮

391
00:22:48,863 --> 00:22:53,123
我把它扫描进机器
我在电脑里把它翻过来...

392
00:22:53,193 --> 00:22:55,223
我现在正在切割右边脸

393
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:59,363
今天结束前 我们有望把两半合起来
看看效果

394
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,963
那将是人们第一次见到对称的Darth Vader

395
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:07,773
我们开始做头盔了
明天要注模

396
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:09,933
肩膀做好了
头部也在做了

397
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:14,295
几个星期后 这些部分将被拼成Darth Vader
这样很好

398
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:15,273
但我们还要做boxes

399
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,943
我们要开始做fittings

400
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:20,513
起初 是一件米色的suit...

401
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:23,683
看上去一点都不吓人

402
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:28,023
但是一种怀旧之情涌上心头...

403
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:31,963
我不晓得即将会有什么感觉

404
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:37,373
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

405
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:41,433
他们本可以
随便找个高个子就混过去...

406
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:44,443
不过我又求又请
他们也十分好心地...

407
00:23:44,513 --> 00:23:46,673
给我量身定做了一套Darth Vader suit

408
00:23:46,753 --> 00:23:48,683
把头盔罩上...

409
00:23:51,123 --> 00:23:52,953
里面看上去太瘦了

410
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:57,183
我不晓得你能不能看清楚
在这边加上一个小管子...

411
00:23:57,263 --> 00:24:01,993
再加一块辅料
整个轮廓就出来了 也把脸填满了

412
00:24:02,403 --> 00:24:05,063
也更像我们记忆中的形象

413
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:08,193
这种事情很怪
我们总是在发现

414
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:11,003
那些我们以为已经会了的东西

415
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:16,043
同时
我们要做一个...

416
00:24:16,113 --> 00:24:19,483
Anakin和Obi-Wan两人
互相斗剑的场景

417
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:22,313
这是个十分困难的事情
这(两人)是好朋友

418
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:25,223
你知道 这是他的良师益友...

419
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:27,343
他们的友谊破碎了

420
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:29,413
Anakin就让它发生了

421
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:33,653
Obi-Wan似乎总是对那小孩心存戒心...

422
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:37,823
向他奄奄一息的师父Qui-Gon做了保证...

423
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:40,923
他保证要把小孩训练成Jedi
并照顾他...

424
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:43,663
他做到了 我认为
尽他所能

425
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:47,843
在斗剑中
你要学上千种招数

426
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:50,003
这很困难 你还得记住它们

427
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,913
你必须得牢牢记住
不然头就会挨劈

428
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:56,513
手指头?

429
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,783
每个场景都要重复打很多遍...

430
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:03,793
要做得尽可能完美...

431
00:25:03,863 --> 00:25:04,883
十分累人

432
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:09,523
我们要重做一遍

433
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:12,223
很辛苦 不过一天结束时
我们俩都会很满足

434
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:15,793
那些家伙十分投入...

435
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:18,173
一个人犯了错误
boom-暂停

436
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:20,573
他们都没事
有说有笑

437
00:25:20,643 --> 00:25:22,273
boom-过几秒钟
他们又练起来了

438
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:25,373
他们每天都能持续好几个小时

439
00:25:27,923 --> 00:25:29,713
Ewan一直都是个好剑客...

440
00:25:29,783 --> 00:25:32,883
不过Hayden富有运动细胞
他打得也很好

441
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:35,513
这一场的特别之处在于
他们要对打

442
00:25:35,923 --> 00:25:38,193
所以他们都很卖力...

443
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:42,223
每天都把常规做完
努力超过对方

444
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:49,273
And that leads into this.

445
00:25:59,283 --> 00:26:00,873
They've done more layers
of the silicone...

446
00:26:00,953 --> 00:26:03,253
and then we've done
a fiberglass jacket around it.

447
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:07,913
We've then taken all of that off
so we could get the original shape out.

448
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:11,723
So we now have an empty shell, which
is going to be our Darth Vader helmet...

449
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:17,353
which now Adam is about to start
laying up in polyester--in fiberglass.

450
00:27:03,843 --> 00:27:06,573
新鲜出炉 Darth Vader头盔

451
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,913
看起来蛮不赖的

452
00:27:09,983 --> 00:27:13,783
我认为Hayden一定会很激动
扮演Darth Vader

453
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:16,253
进入Darth Vader
这是最酷的部分

454
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:18,853
给Hayden再试穿一次
拍到电影上

455
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:21,263
接着它就成为回忆了

456
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:34,133
我们组所有人
都想参与制作这个

457
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:36,513
我们跟他去摄影棚的那天
他走进镜头...

458
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,573
你看着他闪闪发光...

459
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:41,483
想到 ''这真是件神奇的事情''

460
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:43,243
带我们回到了过去

461
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:16,263
很久很久以前
在一个遥远的星系

462
00:28:17,243 --> 00:28:20,473
星球大战传奇的下一篇章

463
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:22,773
绝地归来

464
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:30,153
善与恶的战斗愈演愈烈

465
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:35,053
加入这一群人的冒险...

466
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:36,953
Luke Skywalker...

467
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:39,263
Han Solo...

468
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:42,133
Leia公主...

469
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:45,033
Lando Calrissian...

470
00:28:45,803 --> 00:28:47,163
Chewbacca...

471
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,503
C-3PO和R2-D2...

472
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:53,403
还有Darth Vader

473
00:29:03,523 --> 00:29:05,753
一次去外星世界的旅程

474
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:08,953
It's a trap.

475
00:29:09,823 --> 00:29:12,023
一场对压迫的反抗斗争

476
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:17,663
一部英雄与恶棍的史诗

477
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:21,293
一场同宇宙一样大的冒险

478
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,103
绝地归来

479
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:32,473
将在你星系的指定影院上映

480
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,673
激光剑的诞生

481
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:04,545
40年代的海盗电影和浪漫主义电影
绝对影响了星球大战

482
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:06,530
『罗宾汉历险记』(1938)

483
00:30:04,645 --> 00:30:07,073
Errol Flynn演的那种电影

484
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:12,723
在那一段时间 电影院里全是...

485
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:15,153
奇幻 动作冒险流派的电影

486
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:16,123
For luck.

487
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:20,893
星球大战的前提是
它为一部浪漫主义奇幻电影...

488
00:30:20,963 --> 00:30:24,063
富有神话中的浪漫主义传统...

489
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,903
你知道的 『亚瑟王』

490
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:28,563
打斗的浪漫一面...

491
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:31,333
富有骑士精神和荣耀之类的

492
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:37,073
为了发扬一群和平卫士...

493
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:42,243
他们高于一切
受人尊敬 有决定权...

494
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:45,223
为星系带来和平...

495
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:49,313
我需要能和绝地相称的武器

496
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:51,833
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

497
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:54,493
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

498
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:59,533
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

499
00:31:00,203 --> 00:31:01,933
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

500
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:05,843
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

501
00:31:06,913 --> 00:31:09,103
An elegant weapon...

502
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:11,843
for a more civilized age.

503
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:14,683
它更像是一段简约时期的象征...

504
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:19,523
那时候帝国尚未掌权
而是由荣耀来统治

505
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:23,183
电影中 它不只是一种实际武器
更是一种象征

506
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:27,253
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a blaster at your side.

507
00:31:27,963 --> 00:31:29,623
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

508
00:31:29,703 --> 00:31:32,833
原始构思是绝地用剑打斗

509
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:35,373
之后 我想换成更有未来主义的剑...

510
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:38,373
所以我把它换成了激光剑...

511
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:41,413
给了它一种科技优势

512
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:50,883
在那射线枪横流的时代里...

513
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,853
它可以偏转射线

514
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:56,023
既然前提是绝地用它们防身...

515
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:59,123
不是用来进攻 而是防御...

516
00:31:59,203 --> 00:32:02,963
在射线枪世界里用激光剑...

517
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:05,133
作为防御武器再适合不过

518
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:20,183
It started out as a kind of
Oriental form of swordplay...

519
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:23,693
where there was a lot of honor involved
and a lot of skill and craft...

520
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:27,523
and higher spiritual meaning
to the sword fight.

521
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:30,993
So they were very simple.
In the beginning...

522
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:33,223
the first film, Episode IV...

523
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:35,923
it was a fight between
a very old man...

524
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:40,093
and a man who was only partially
a man and mostly a mechanical being.

525
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:42,573
So it wasn't really
much of a sword fight at all.

526
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:45,513
When I left, I was but a learner.

527
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:47,203
Now I am the master.

528
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:49,343
Only a master of evil, Darth.

529
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:05,733
激光剑最初是
四乘五相机的闪光附件

530
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:10,063
我们把圆形的闪光部分拆下来
用它来做激光剑

531
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:12,163
George坚持说那些剑...

532
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:15,473
十分 十分重
重到不能单手拿

533
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:18,633
我们一直得用两只手
就像一把Excalibur

534
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,613
有40,50磅重

535
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:23,273
非常的强大
里面蕴含了大量能量

536
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:27,483
挥动它们的时候
感觉很沉重...

537
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:30,783
因为它们撞到一起的时候...

538
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:33,343
会产生巨大的爆炸 等等等等

539
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:35,623
到后来...

540
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:39,293
我们让激光剑斗
变得更快更激烈...

541
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:42,823
因为Luke的剑艺越来越高

542
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:49,258
所以 我们慢慢把东方式的双手持剑...

543
00:33:49,258 --> 00:33:52,043
变为不时用单手持剑

544
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,043
继续发展下去...

545
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:56,743
成了双手和单手混用

546
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:59,983
不过起先
你必须用两只手拿激光剑...

547
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:03,453
因为要挥动大量的能量

548
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:08,453
You see? You can do it.

549
00:34:09,023 --> 00:34:10,223
I call it luck.

550
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:12,893
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

551
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:18,463
激光剑的效果
基本上是根旋转的棒子...

552
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:22,373
上面涂了银幕材料...

553
00:34:22,443 --> 00:34:24,673
这样它就能以多倍亮度...

554
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,673
把光源反射回去

555
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:29,943
问题是 如果你把它移出一定范围...

556
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:32,003
它就不再反光...

557
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,143
变回了旋转的棒子

558
00:34:34,223 --> 00:34:35,855
我们在表面缠上反光胶带

559
00:34:35,855 --> 00:34:39,153
这样它就能发光照亮演员

560
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:42,523
这方法没奏效
他们会打坏激光剑

561
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:46,193
之后 我们采用了涂反光材料的棍子

562
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:48,633
再后来 我们更加...

563
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:51,363
精通于制作斗剑

564
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:54,963
我们采用了无反光材料的剑...

565
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:59,413
我们决定不再通过镜头拍摄光...

566
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:01,413
和很多其他的过程...

567
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:04,743
这样我们拍摄打斗时可以轻松些

568
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:07,713
118BT 第二镜 A相机

569
00:35:08,783 --> 00:35:10,273
And action!

570
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:14,053
我原以为他们以后
会把卡通剑身放进去

571
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:17,023
不过 如果你在斗剑...

572
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:19,223
你就不会停手

573
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:21,463
你需要找东西来敲

574
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:32,713
每一把激光剑都是半真半画的

575
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:38,043
我们需要真的棒子
来告诉我们剑身的位置

576
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:41,243
有时候我们会用短剑身
因为他们要近战...

577
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:43,613
会打到场景里的东西

578
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:45,283
有时候我们不用剑身...

579
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,693
因为剑会在镜头中展开...

580
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:50,453
或者他们的动作太过复杂...

581
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:52,463
无法用剑来模拟

582
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,463
我们之后会把剑加进去

583
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:56,903
但这需要很仔细地追踪轨迹...

584
00:35:56,973 --> 00:35:59,203
计算出剑身的位置

585
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:02,363
再后来 到了第二第三部(V VI)...

586
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:08,695
他们认为当场拍摄得不偿失...

587
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:09,873
全部在后期完成

588
00:36:09,953 --> 00:36:14,253
我们仍然用一小段棒子...

589
00:36:14,323 --> 00:36:17,483
这样就有个东西可以打

590
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:22,393
这多亏于特技的进步...

591
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:24,263
而不是其他方面

592
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:28,833
我们的转描技术越来越娴熟...

593
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:27,290
早期画面-转描之前

594
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,036
未重合的转描

595
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:31,233
我们用了更先进的技术...

596
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:33,342
更近的转描 仍然未重合

597
00:36:31,303 --> 00:36:33,273
来更容易地跟踪那些剑...

598
00:36:33,543 --> 00:36:36,473
复制下来
制作激光剑

599
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:36,540
最终画面

600
00:36:37,273 --> 00:36:40,403
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

601
00:36:40,913 --> 00:36:43,903
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

602
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:48,313
尽管在拍摄的时候
激光剑看上去有些蹩脚...

603
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:53,043
在后期制作时
他们给其上了应有的样子

604
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:55,283
当然还有
Ben Burtt出色的声音效果

605
00:37:16,013 --> 00:37:19,713
第一部电影中激光剑的声效
被交给了Ben Burtt

606
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:23,953
Ben从一开头...

607
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:26,423
我写剧本的时候就开工了

608
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:28,293
我告诉他我需要R2的声音

609
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:32,693
我需要Darth Vader呼吸的声音

610
00:37:34,803 --> 00:37:37,273
我需要射线枪的声音

611
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:43,933
我需要激光剑的声音

612
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:56,273
我为这电影制作的
第一个声效是激光剑

613
00:37:56,353 --> 00:38:01,793
我记得在当时
我在墙上看了Ralph McQuarrie的一些作品

614
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,593
画的是Luke在电影结尾斗剑

615
00:38:04,663 --> 00:38:08,263
他们拿着激光剑
我立马就想到了

616
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,733
我觉得我知道它们会发什么声音

617
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:14,903
在电影放映室里
那些放映机会发出嗡嗡声

618
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:18,673
他们不在运转 只是闲置着
马达在那边发着...

619
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:21,543
一种魔幻神秘的嗡鸣声...

620
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:24,553
某方面来说 我觉得很悦耳

621
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:27,173
我想道 ''这大概就是激光剑的声音''

622
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:29,013
Your powers are weak, old man.

623
00:38:29,753 --> 00:38:32,783
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

624
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:36,223
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

625
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:39,723
我当时还找了些其他元素

626
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:42,663
我有一台录音机
话筒线坏了

627
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,673
包裹物脱落了

628
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:48,033
我在公寓里经过电视机的时候...

629
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:52,563
显像管里的嗡鸣声
通过破线传了出来

630
00:38:53,513 --> 00:38:57,473
产生蜂鸣 我说道
''这蜂鸣好听 听上去很危险''

631
00:38:57,553 --> 00:39:01,713
我把蜂鸣声录了下来
健全的人通常不会要嗡鸣声

632
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:04,253
这一次 嗡鸣声就是答案

633
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,023
当然 我要录入声音...

634
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:17,503
把剑掠过发出的嗖嗖声去掉

635
00:39:17,573 --> 00:39:21,833
他花了大半年时间制作那些声音

636
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:25,033
我首次加入激光剑的声效的地方

637
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,873
是在一段电影的临时剪辑

638
00:39:27,943 --> 00:39:31,813
对它没有多少评论

639
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:36,343
但我从此明白
没有评论 那就是很棒

640
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:38,443
那就是通过测试

641
00:39:38,523 --> 00:39:39,613
Impressive.

642
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:42,963
Most impressive.

643
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:45,193
最终 激光剑的声音...

644
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:47,923
因为我们要富有能量的感觉...

645
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:50,433
是几种不同声音的组合

646
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:53,263
从哗哗响的真空吸尘器...

647
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:57,643
到一种击打干冰的碰撞声

648
00:39:57,713 --> 00:40:01,573
那之后我们做了改进
因为武器移动得更快了...

649
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:05,103
最新电影中我们有双头激光剑

650
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:07,943
但都是基于相同的录音

651
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,843
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

652
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:14,563
You'd have been killed too...

653
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:17,393
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

654
00:40:19,193 --> 00:40:21,193
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

655
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:23,923
There's nothing for me here now.

656
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:27,033
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

657
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:30,073
在每一部中 从 IV V和VI...

658
00:40:30,143 --> 00:40:33,403
我不断改善剑斗...

659
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:36,573
因为我假设Luke正成为...

660
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:39,713
更强的剑客
他在学更多的东西

661
00:40:39,783 --> 00:40:41,913
但与此同时...

662
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:46,313
他并没有按Jedi传统的方式进行训练

663
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:50,693
AJedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defense...

664
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:52,523
never for attack.

665
00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:55,293
- But tell me why I can't--
- No. There is no why.

666
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,063
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

667
00:40:58,133 --> 00:40:59,273
在Empire Strikes Back中...

668
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:05,603
反派人物和正派人物首次交手

669
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:08,373
所以 这是场大仗...

670
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:12,003
Luke已经足够精通...

671
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,013
可以与Darth Vader交手

672
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:17,143
所以 这是场稍微一边倒的剑斗...

673
00:41:17,223 --> 00:41:20,483
Vader稍胜一筹

674
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:23,153
在这场打斗戏中...

675
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,093
Luke并不知道Vader是他父亲

676
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:27,923
他以为自己在打仇敌

677
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:29,763
所以他尽全力地去打

678
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:32,273
他以为自己在打杀父仇人...

679
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,433
打杀死Obi-Wan Kenobi的人...

680
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:37,473
打宇宙中邪恶附身的人

681
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:40,733
在下一场打斗中...

682
00:41:40,813 --> 00:41:44,113
两人不分伯仲

683
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:47,813
再下一场
Return of the Jedi...

684
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:49,413
他知道自己在与父亲对打

685
00:41:49,483 --> 00:41:52,513
I see you have constructed
a new lightsaber.

686
00:41:53,063 --> 00:41:55,623
他知道皇帝是幕后黑手

687
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:58,123
Your skills are complete.

688
00:41:58,193 --> 00:42:01,463
他也知道他在处理的问题...

689
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:03,233
比剑斗大得多

690
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:07,673
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

691
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:12,113
所以这场剑斗更注重
于剑斗时的感情背景...

692
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:14,443
而不是剑斗本身

693
00:42:14,513 --> 00:42:15,483
Never!

694
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:20,727
这是电影的高潮

695
00:42:20,727 --> 00:42:26,923
而不是高科技战争 死星爆炸之类的...

696
00:42:26,993 --> 00:42:30,123
这是更个人的剑斗
父子之间的较量

697
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:54,613
然后我们拍摄了前传...

698
00:42:54,683 --> 00:42:57,653
其中Jedi in their full flower...

699
00:42:57,723 --> 00:43:01,783
按过去的方式斗剑
训练有素的绝地

700
00:43:01,863 --> 00:43:04,593
我们要把他们的剑斗动作做得更快...

701
00:43:04,663 --> 00:43:09,263
更复杂 更有攻击性

702
00:43:11,473 --> 00:43:12,803
我们延续了下去

703
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:14,273
Brave of you, boy.

704
00:43:15,503 --> 00:43:17,773
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

705
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:19,473
I am a slow learner.

706
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:20,843
Anakin!

707
00:43:20,913 --> 00:43:25,403
比起第IV V和VI
剑斗变得更加残忍

708
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,823
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

709
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:37,693
This is just the beginning.

710
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:50,303
一个基于一个
因为剑斗变得更加私人...

711
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:53,603
直到第三部
这是一场非常私人的较量

712
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:57,873
这一场 他们要殊死搏斗
所以时间很长

713
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:55,851
现场 "Star Wars Episode III"

714
00:44:02,383 --> 00:44:05,913
两个人物间的区别是
Obi-Wan经验更丰富...

715
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:07,753
但Anakin更强大

716
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:11,363
很不错

717
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:16,603
Thanks, everybody.

718
00:44:16,673 --> 00:44:18,963
You know, I'm here today
as Luke Skywalker...

719
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:22,303
but I'm also here
to talk about Sprint.

720
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:25,433
As you can see, you stand to save
up to 1 7 cents a month...

721
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,103
over the more
dependable providers.

722
00:45:11,373 --> 00:45:14,243
Luke Skywalker与Han Solo
救出了公主...

723
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:18,003
摧毁了死星
但他们的故事还没结束

724
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,783
有史以来最火电影的制作者们...

725
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:32,623
带给你星球大战传奇的下一部

726
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:35,183
帝国反击战

727
00:45:45,303 --> 00:45:48,173
我们英雄的故事延续...

728
00:45:48,243 --> 00:45:49,713
Luke Skywalker...

729
00:45:49,773 --> 00:45:51,243
Princess Leia...

730
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:52,643
Han Solo...

731
00:45:52,713 --> 00:45:54,043
C-3PO...

732
00:45:54,113 --> 00:45:55,583
R2-D2...

733
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:57,313
和Chewbacca.

734
00:45:57,383 --> 00:46:00,583
并介绍Lando Calrissian

735
00:46:00,653 --> 00:46:02,883
这部史诗包含了浪漫...

736
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:13,493
包含了英雄和恶棍

737
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:26,413
他们穿过杳无人迹的真空
来到了未知的世界

738
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:39,283
对抗压迫的银河奥德赛

739
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:56,873
星球大战传奇的新冒险

740
00:46:56,943 --> 00:46:59,243
帝国反击战

741
00:47:04,413 --> 00:47:07,873
明年夏天在你的星系上映

742
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:20,623
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

743
00:47:25,263 --> 00:47:28,393
它是有史以来最受欢迎的太空冒险

744
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:30,703
''Exciting''is hardly
the word I would choose.

745
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:34,293
它是好莱坞历史上最先锋的传奇之一

746
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:36,243
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.

747
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:39,643
它以一种不可抗力捕获了想象力...

748
00:47:39,713 --> 00:47:42,443
You've taken your first step
into a larger world.

749
00:47:42,513 --> 00:47:46,353
并把三名年轻演员变成了超级明星

750
00:47:46,423 --> 00:47:49,483
- I got him!
- Great kid! Don't get cocky.

751
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:53,453
星球大战获得成功后
纷纷而来的机会...

752
00:47:53,523 --> 00:47:55,353
改变了我的整个人生

753
00:47:57,263 --> 00:48:00,163
它是一则奇妙的寓言

754
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,563
I'll never turn to the dark side.

755
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:03,997
It's Geroge's vision

756
00:48:03,997 --> 00:48:09,233
and he truly is a visual man
in a profound way.

757
00:48:10,613 --> 00:48:12,343
但是星球大战三部曲...

758
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:14,903
不止改变了我们视电影的方式

759
00:48:14,983 --> 00:48:17,643
它改变了电影拍摄的方式

760
00:48:17,713 --> 00:48:20,413
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

761
00:48:20,923 --> 00:48:23,323
George造就了许多东西...

762
00:48:24,153 --> 00:48:26,883
其改变了我们所知的(电影)行业

763
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:28,513
We did it!

764
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:31,033
一则星系童话的成功...

765
00:48:31,093 --> 00:48:34,933
超越了任何人最狂野的梦想

766
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:37,433
The Force will be with you always.

767
00:48:37,503 --> 00:48:41,163
我本打算永远都不去拍热门电影
这不是我的安排

768
00:48:41,243 --> 00:48:44,473
我并没期望星球大战会如此热门

769
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:50,816
但它成为了一种现象

770
00:48:50,816 --> 00:49:00,792
=梦想的帝国=
星球大战三部曲的故事

771
00:49:16,613 --> 00:49:20,103
很难回忆起星球大战之前的时代

772
00:49:24,553 --> 00:49:26,453
那时的世界是另一幅景象

773
00:49:28,283 --> 00:49:30,983
那时候没有手机和个人电脑

774
00:49:31,693 --> 00:49:34,023
互联网的出现遥遥无期

775
00:49:34,093 --> 00:49:36,653
就连家庭电视游戏
还有一大段路要走

776
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:42,193
- 太空竞赛已经结束
- 对一个人来说这是一小步

777
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:44,963
美国人感到深陷于现状

778
00:49:46,643 --> 00:49:48,873
那时候处于通货膨胀...

779
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:51,073
石油价格上涨...

780
00:49:51,873 --> 00:49:55,573
国民对他们的英雄和领导人冷嘲热讽

781
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:57,583
我不是骗子

782
00:49:57,653 --> 00:50:00,813
在我们国家 水门(丑闻)撕开了我们

783
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:03,253
此外我们还在打越南战争...

784
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:06,223
前所未有地在分裂国家

785
00:50:06,823 --> 00:50:11,323
那是我们历史中可怕的十年
充斥着风暴和暴力

786
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:16,023
在大银幕上 好莱坞的看法同样惊心

787
00:50:18,573 --> 00:50:22,903
1970年代的早期电影
gritty且常为悲观...

788
00:50:22,973 --> 00:50:26,273
反映了美国的社会与政治剧变

789
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:28,543
老式英雄已逝...

790
00:50:28,613 --> 00:50:33,073
打破一切规则的顽固反英雄
统治着银幕

791
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:38,893
在60年代末期
the Warners the Zanucks...

792
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:41,693
那些首先建立制片厂的人...

793
00:50:41,763 --> 00:50:45,323
都退休了 他们把制片厂卖给了公司

794
00:50:45,403 --> 00:50:48,663
有饮料公司还有所有其他行业的

795
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:52,433
他们根本不知道如何经营制片厂

796
00:50:52,503 --> 00:50:55,163
他们知道的是
销售部门说人们想看这个...

797
00:50:55,243 --> 00:50:56,173
你就去拍那个

798
00:50:56,243 --> 00:50:57,573
他们开始销售电影...

799
00:50:57,643 --> 00:51:00,173
研究人口统计资料之类的东西

800
00:51:00,243 --> 00:51:03,773
他们意识到年轻人
拍给年轻人看的电影有市场...

801
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:06,713
因为年轻人群占市场的更大部分

802
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:11,613
持续数十年的制片制度瓦解了

803
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:15,523
好莱坞的主管们
急切地想接触年轻观众...

804
00:51:15,593 --> 00:51:19,493
到电影学校
来找下一代的电影制作人

805
00:51:19,563 --> 00:51:23,023
- 开拍
- 在这种变革的气氛中...

806
00:51:23,103 --> 00:51:25,763
富有天赋的年轻导演
比如Francis Ford Coppola...

807
00:51:26,243 --> 00:51:27,333
Brian De Palma...

808
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:29,303
Martin Scorsese...

809
00:51:29,373 --> 00:51:30,933
和Steven Spielberg...

810
00:51:31,013 --> 00:51:33,443
把更多的个人感性带上了银幕

811
00:51:34,513 --> 00:51:38,473
那是个困惑的年代
很多电影制作人要做...

812
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,023
平时做不到的方案

813
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,213
我在正中间被找上了

814
00:51:43,293 --> 00:51:45,813
George是北加州来的不羁少年...

815
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:49,893
一个独立电影制作者
他总是因为...

816
00:51:49,963 --> 00:51:54,363
自己与好莱坞关系甚少而自豪

817
00:51:55,033 --> 00:51:57,063
出生于加利福尼亚州Modesto...

818
00:51:57,133 --> 00:52:00,233
George Lucas读着冒险故事...

819
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:03,533
看着电视连续剧长大

820
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:17,923
上大学的时候
他制作电影的梦想才浮出水面

821
00:52:18,623 --> 00:52:21,253
1963年 他离开Modesto...

822
00:52:21,323 --> 00:52:24,663
去参加南加州大学(USC)的电影班

823
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:30,603
我当时在USC教书
George上了一门讨论课

824
00:52:30,873 --> 00:52:35,073
我们讨论了他电影制作的早期尝试

825
00:52:36,143 --> 00:52:38,043
我告诉你 从一开始...

826
00:52:38,443 --> 00:52:40,413
George就有独一无二的视角

827
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:44,073
George能在常规外思考...

828
00:52:44,153 --> 00:52:48,743
你可以从他的学生电影
THX-1138中看出来

829
00:52:49,193 --> 00:52:51,353
THX-1138 4EB

830
00:52:51,423 --> 00:52:53,393
THX-1138 4EB

831
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:56,053
This is Authority.
You will stop where you are.

832
00:52:56,133 --> 00:52:59,863
他拍了一部20分钟的电影
本应是五分钟

833
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:01,903
You're going for
the emergency switch.

834
00:53:01,963 --> 00:53:05,463
但是他得到了大量认可
打开了教授们的眼睛...

835
00:53:05,543 --> 00:53:08,373
孩子可以做出打破常规...

836
00:53:08,443 --> 00:53:10,573
超越限制的东西

837
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:15,103
Lucas的专业技术和故事想象力...

838
00:53:15,183 --> 00:53:16,813
赢得了大家的喝彩

839
00:53:18,183 --> 00:53:22,213
他对神化和哲学的兴趣
gave his work an added dimension.

840
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:26,393
George's style was fantastic.

841
00:53:26,463 --> 00:53:28,153
Incredible.

842
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:32,923
不管他拍什么...

843
00:53:33,503 --> 00:53:38,093
都比其他作品看上去更个人

844
00:53:39,073 --> 00:53:41,303
从USC毕业后...

845
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:43,640
Lucas与朋友Francis Ford Coppola合伙...

846
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,913
Coppola在1969年于旧金山
创建了美国西洋镜公司...

847
00:53:48,983 --> 00:53:50,913
一家独立电影公司

848
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:55,113
我并不打算变得成功

849
00:53:55,183 --> 00:53:57,713
但是我感到...

850
00:53:57,793 --> 00:54:00,483
有能力控制自己的作品...

851
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:02,293
而不被人篡改

852
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:06,893
1971年 Lucas导演了THX-1138...

853
00:54:06,963 --> 00:54:09,803
基于他学生电影的影院长片

854
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:12,893
当华纳兄弟的主管们
观看了成品后...

855
00:54:12,973 --> 00:54:15,943
他们要求Coppola归还$300,000...

856
00:54:16,013 --> 00:54:19,443
the studio had advanced
to develop THX and other projects.

857
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:25,943
初出茅庐的公司imploded
Lucas得去其他地方找工作

858
00:54:26,023 --> 00:54:28,513
他决定自己包揽大局...

859
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:31,353
并开了自己的公司
卢卡斯电影有限公司

860
00:54:33,293 --> 00:54:35,593
它旗下的第一个项目...

861
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:37,823
Lucas选择了『美国风情画』...

862
00:54:37,893 --> 00:54:41,393
an affectionate look at teenage cruising
in the early 1 960s.

863
00:54:41,463 --> 00:54:44,993
- I'm a ready teddy.
- Well, get bent, turkey.

864
00:54:47,573 --> 00:54:49,833
由环球制片厂制片...

865
00:54:49,913 --> 00:54:50,930
此电影宽松地基于...

866
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:55,073
他在Modesto作为汽车狂热者的个人经历

867
00:54:55,813 --> 00:54:59,773
我原是极端实验主义且强硬...

868
00:54:59,853 --> 00:55:02,583
然后接受了Francis给我的挑战

869
00:55:02,653 --> 00:55:05,523
''我赌你不会拍一部傻乎乎的喜剧''

870
00:55:06,193 --> 00:55:08,663
一部温馨虚幻的喜剧
我说 ''我去试试''

871
00:55:10,963 --> 00:55:15,563
电影只拍摄了28天
成本低于100万美元

872
00:55:15,633 --> 00:55:19,623
合作制片人是也是USC的校友 Gary Kurtz

873
00:55:19,703 --> 00:55:23,193
『美国风情画』的后期制作将近尾声...

874
00:55:23,273 --> 00:55:27,213
我们在旧金山Northpoint电影院
组织了一场放映

875
00:55:29,553 --> 00:55:32,483
我们感觉到观众的反应很积极

876
00:55:33,553 --> 00:55:36,643
但是来自环球制片厂的Ned Tanen十分恼火

877
00:55:36,723 --> 00:55:39,023
他说 ''你眼下不应该把它放给观众看''

878
00:55:39,093 --> 00:55:40,753
我们完全目瞪口呆

879
00:55:41,363 --> 00:55:44,883
他们不理解我的第一部电影
完成后还来干涉它

880
00:55:44,963 --> 00:55:46,553
我的第二部电影也是如此

881
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:49,263
公司实体进来...

882
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,303
对它胡搞了一番
剪掉了5分钟

883
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:54,563
在发表『美国风情画』之前...

884
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:58,443
George Lucas的想象已指向星空

885
00:56:00,913 --> 00:56:03,853
在此期间 他一直在说...

886
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:08,253
他想拍一部类似于『飞侠哥顿』的
1930年代的太空歌剧

887
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,313
他正经地着手工作

888
00:56:13,763 --> 00:56:18,133
人们说 ''Of all things to pick,
why in the world would you do that?''

889
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,493
I said, ''It's fun to make films
for young people.

890
00:56:23,573 --> 00:56:25,663
It's a chance to
make an impression on them.

891
00:56:28,243 --> 00:56:29,833
I wanna do this.''

892
00:56:29,913 --> 00:56:31,603
With his galactic fairy tale...

893
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:34,203
Lucas hoped to reinvent
a classic genre.

894
00:56:35,543 --> 00:56:37,073
Among his influences...

895
00:56:37,153 --> 00:56:40,083
were the writings of scholar
and educatorJoseph Campbell...

896
00:56:40,153 --> 00:56:43,783
in which he explored the origins
of myth and world religions.

897
00:56:43,853 --> 00:56:46,153
When Lucas was writing
the script of Star Wars...

898
00:56:46,223 --> 00:56:48,163
he was heavily interested
in Joseph Campbell.

899
00:56:48,223 --> 00:56:49,853
WhatJoseph Campbell
was interested in...

900
00:56:49,933 --> 00:56:54,453
was to see the connections between
the myths of different cultures...

901
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,963
to try to find out
what were the threads...

902
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:59,763
that tied all these very
disparate cultures together.

903
00:56:59,843 --> 00:57:02,203
I did research to try
to distill everything...

904
00:57:02,273 --> 00:57:03,933
down into motifs
that would be universal.

905
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:06,843
I attribute most of the success
to the psychological underpinnings...

906
00:57:06,913 --> 00:57:08,843
which had been around
for thousands of years...

907
00:57:08,913 --> 00:57:12,783
and the people still react the same way
to the stories as they always have.

908
00:57:12,853 --> 00:57:15,373
George is nothing
if not a good reporter.

909
00:57:15,453 --> 00:57:17,753
And when he sets out
to do his work...

910
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:21,883
he starts reporting from
the best sources he can gather.

911
00:57:21,963 --> 00:57:24,763
He brought Campbell
into the process...

912
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:27,163
of looking at his work
on Star Wars...

913
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:30,723
and saying, ''Is this right?
Am I getting it down?

914
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:33,963
Is this the right emphasis?
Is this the right character?''

915
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:38,673
Joseph Campbell said to me the best
student he ever had was George Lucas.

916
00:57:38,743 --> 00:57:40,833
Like such epics as The Odyssey...

917
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:42,913
Beowulf...

918
00:57:42,983 --> 00:57:44,813
and The Legend of King Arthur...

919
00:57:44,883 --> 00:57:48,113
Star Wars drew from
a shared pool of mythic archetypes.

920
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:53,123
You have the youth who's on the
adventure that you can identify with.

921
00:57:53,893 --> 00:57:56,053
You have the swashbuckler.

922
00:57:56,763 --> 00:57:58,563
And you have the damsel.

923
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:02,763
She may not have the reactions
that are conventional...

924
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,963
however she is in distress.

925
00:58:05,973 --> 00:58:10,673
And you have the wise old man,
who you go and you find him.

926
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:13,303
And you have
the funnier characters.

927
00:58:13,383 --> 00:58:17,573
I mean, it really adheres
strictly to that form.

928
00:58:17,653 --> 00:58:22,053
It's the traditional,
ritualistic coming-of-age story.

929
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,923
When I went into the mythological
side of what I wanted to do...

930
00:58:24,993 --> 00:58:28,723
that's a key factor with heroes.

931
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:31,423
By the summer of 1 973...

932
00:58:31,493 --> 00:58:36,093
George Lucas had created a treatment
that he felt was ready to shop around.

933
00:58:36,173 --> 00:58:40,033
Whether anyone would be interested,
that was another story.

934
00:58:46,683 --> 00:58:51,483
The most successful science fiction film
up to that point was 2001 .

935
00:58:51,553 --> 00:58:55,483
Successful then was that
it made about $2 4 million.

936
00:58:55,553 --> 00:58:58,583
Most hit science fiction films
would make about $ 1 6 million...

937
00:58:58,653 --> 00:59:01,563
which was the Planet of the Apes films,
and that sort of thing.

938
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:04,153
But most science fiction films
would make under $ 1 0 million.

939
00:59:04,233 --> 00:59:07,023
There's no reason to think
that it would do any different.

940
00:59:07,103 --> 00:59:11,003
Star Wars was more
space fantasy than science fiction...

941
00:59:11,073 --> 00:59:14,833
but its galactic setting
made it a tough sell in 1 973.

942
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:18,003
When I was pitching the film,
all I had was a 1 4-page story treatment.

943
00:59:18,073 --> 00:59:21,373
It was very vague.
Said it was kind of a 1 930s...

944
00:59:21,443 --> 00:59:23,383
action adventure,
Saturday afternoon serial...

945
00:59:23,453 --> 00:59:27,253
based on the kind of Flash Gordon,
Buck Rogers kind of comic book future.

946
00:59:27,323 --> 00:59:29,313
And that's about all
they knew about it.

947
00:59:32,963 --> 00:59:35,083
In the '70s, science fiction
seemed to be...

948
00:59:35,163 --> 00:59:39,863
all about apocalyptic societies
and death and destruction.

949
00:59:43,233 --> 00:59:44,893
Not very inspiring.

950
00:59:44,973 --> 00:59:47,663
We were fighting an uphill battle
with a science fiction project.

951
00:59:47,743 --> 00:59:51,673
George Lucas brought Star Wars
to Universal and United Artists.

952
00:59:51,743 --> 00:59:54,173
Both studios passed
on the project.

953
00:59:54,243 --> 00:59:57,803
But the ambitious young filmmaker
was secretly relieved.

954
00:59:57,883 --> 01:00:01,983
The last thing he wanted was to hand
his dream project to the wrong people.

955
01:00:02,053 --> 01:00:04,083
He didn't care
for the studio system.

956
01:00:04,153 --> 01:00:09,113
He used it because there was no other
way of doing what he needed to do.

957
01:00:09,863 --> 01:00:14,063
Undaunted, Lucas presented
Star Wars to Alan Ladd,Jr....

958
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:17,223
the new head of creative affairs
at 20th Century Fox.

959
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:22,773
Ladd, a former producer, was able to
recognize potential in the filmmaker...

960
01:00:22,843 --> 01:00:24,813
if not necessarily the film.

961
01:00:24,873 --> 01:00:27,273
We had a meeting,
and George said...

962
01:00:27,343 --> 01:00:29,973
''I've been thinking about
this thing called Star Wars. ''

963
01:00:30,053 --> 01:00:32,143
And he told me about it.

964
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,243
I said, ''That sounds terrific.''

965
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:39,183
The technology part of the whole
thing was completely over my head.

966
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:42,193
But I just believed in him
and his genius.

967
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,823
I sort of recognized
from American Graffiti...

968
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:48,923
that he really was a genius,
so I just flew with it.

969
01:00:49,003 --> 01:00:51,263
He understood what talent was.

970
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,933
He respected talent
and he was able to say...

971
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:57,063
''I think this guy's talented.
I think we're gonna invest in him. ''

972
01:00:57,143 --> 01:00:59,233
So, Alan Ladd,Jr. invested in me.

973
01:00:59,313 --> 01:01:02,243
He did not invest in the movie.
And it paid off.

974
01:01:04,513 --> 01:01:08,883
In 1 973, Ladd's investment
in George Lucas provedjustified.

975
01:01:08,953 --> 01:01:12,553
American Graffiti was finally
released to rave reviews...

976
01:01:12,623 --> 01:01:15,253
and became the third-highest
grossing picture of the year.

977
01:01:15,323 --> 01:01:18,623
It went on to earn more than
$ 1 00 million worldwide.

978
01:01:20,763 --> 01:01:25,463
American Graffiti showed
a very human center and a huge heart...

979
01:01:25,533 --> 01:01:27,063
that George has always had.

980
01:01:27,673 --> 01:01:30,043
I think that surprised
a lot of people.

981
01:01:31,013 --> 01:01:33,743
With a preliminary deal
for Star Wars in place...

982
01:01:33,813 --> 01:01:37,543
Lucas began writing
his screenplay in 1 97 4.

983
01:01:37,613 --> 01:01:40,173
It proved more ambitious
than he had first imagined.

984
01:01:40,983 --> 01:01:45,353
The filmmaker was able to
distill his idea down to its essence--

985
01:01:45,423 --> 01:01:48,323
an epic battle between
a heroic Rebel Alliance...

986
01:01:48,393 --> 01:01:50,883
and an evil Galactic Empire.

987
01:01:57,073 --> 01:02:01,303
The chief villain, Darth Vader,
was there practically from the start.

988
01:02:01,373 --> 01:02:04,973
But it took time to come up with
Star Wars's three main heroes--

989
01:02:05,043 --> 01:02:07,573
a plucky young princess
named Leia Organa...

990
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,183
the fearless Corellian smuggler
known as Han Solo...

991
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,823
and most important,
an idealistic farm boy...

992
01:02:14,883 --> 01:02:17,883
whose original name
was Luke Starkiller.

993
01:02:17,953 --> 01:02:19,923
Over the course ofhis adventure...

994
01:02:19,993 --> 01:02:21,923
Luke trains to become
a Jedi knight...

995
01:02:21,993 --> 01:02:25,953
deriving his power from a mystical
energy known as ''the Force. ''

996
01:02:26,633 --> 01:02:30,393
But along the way, the script
went through radical changes.

997
01:02:30,473 --> 01:02:33,163
At one point, Luke was
a 60-year-old general...

998
01:02:33,243 --> 01:02:37,103
and Han Solo
had green skin and gills.

999
01:02:38,043 --> 01:02:41,443
Even the concept of the Force
had yet to be fully realized.

1000
01:02:41,513 --> 01:02:43,983
Instead, there was
the Kaiburr Crystal...

1001
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:46,143
a sort of galactic Holy Grail.

1002
01:02:46,883 --> 01:02:51,953
The concept of the Force was
an important one in the story.

1003
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:54,723
The difficulty is...

1004
01:02:55,423 --> 01:02:59,383
trying to create
a religious-spiritual concept...

1005
01:02:59,463 --> 01:03:03,423
that works in a very simple way
without heavy exposition...

1006
01:03:03,503 --> 01:03:07,033
or without it seeming
to pull down the story.

1007
01:03:07,103 --> 01:03:10,093
It got to be a very fat script,
about 200 pages.

1008
01:03:10,173 --> 01:03:12,143
And the story
had gotten away from me.

1009
01:03:12,213 --> 01:03:15,143
So, the only way I could
cope with it was to say...

1010
01:03:15,213 --> 01:03:18,613
''I'll take the first third-- the first
act-- and I'll make that into a movie.''

1011
01:03:18,683 --> 01:03:22,123
But I'd written all this other stuff.
I'd spent a year writing this story.

1012
01:03:22,183 --> 01:03:26,183
I said, ''I'm not gonna throw away
two thirds of my year...

1013
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:28,753
and say,
'This is all I can afford at this point.

1014
01:03:28,823 --> 01:03:31,733
This is the only money I'm gonna get
is to do this one movie.'''

1015
01:03:31,793 --> 01:03:35,923
I put it on the shelf.I said, ''By hook
or by crook, I will finish this movie. ''

1016
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:44,433
But Star Wars
wouldn't be cheap.

1017
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:48,573
To get the Fox board of directors
to approve the necessary budget...

1018
01:03:48,643 --> 01:03:50,613
Lucas needed
something dramatic.

1019
01:03:51,213 --> 01:03:55,513
He hired Ralph McQuarrie, a conceptual
design artist who had worked for Boeing.

1020
01:03:56,053 --> 01:03:58,493
I'd seen some ofhis paintings.
I thought he was brilliant.

1021
01:03:58,553 --> 01:04:01,893
I said, ''I want you to do some
paintings of these scenes I've done...

1022
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:05,053
so that the studio can get a picture
of what I'm talking about.''

1023
01:04:05,693 --> 01:04:09,993
When I turned in the script, I had
about five or six drawings to say...

1024
01:04:10,073 --> 01:04:11,863
''This is what it's gonna look like. ''

1025
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:15,943
He had a concept
for a big spectacular visual...

1026
01:04:16,473 --> 01:04:18,633
and it didn't come across
in the script.

1027
01:04:18,713 --> 01:04:21,473
So I tried to give it scale...

1028
01:04:21,543 --> 01:04:23,843
juxtaposing the tiny little figures...

1029
01:04:23,913 --> 01:04:27,043
with the great,
spectacular backgrounds.

1030
01:04:27,123 --> 01:04:30,313
George would say, ''Don't worry
about how we're going to do it.

1031
01:04:30,393 --> 01:04:35,653
Wejust want an impression of what the
scenes would look like on the screen. ''

1032
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,903
McQuarrie's artwork won over
the Fox board of directors...

1033
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:49,563
who soon approved a budget
ofjust over $8 million.

1034
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:52,733
With only the first part
ofhis Star Wars saga being made...

1035
01:04:52,813 --> 01:04:55,473
Lucas also needed to think
about the future.

1036
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:59,413
But his prior dealings with major
studios had taught him to be cautious.

1037
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:02,043
When I made the deal
for Star Wars...

1038
01:05:02,123 --> 01:05:05,523
originally I made the deal before
American Graffiiti had even come out.

1039
01:05:05,593 --> 01:05:08,753
'Cause Alan Ladd had seen American
Graffiiti and said, ''I'll make a deal.''

1040
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:10,383
But he made a very--

1041
01:05:10,463 --> 01:05:13,433
you're gonna make X number
of dollars and this kind of thing.

1042
01:05:13,503 --> 01:05:15,663
It was like a one-page memo.

1043
01:05:16,573 --> 01:05:20,873
When it came up to doing the contract
for the film, about a year later...

1044
01:05:20,943 --> 01:05:26,503
I knew that what I really had to do
was to protect the unwritten part--

1045
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:28,743
the other two parts of the script.

1046
01:05:28,813 --> 01:05:30,743
All of a sudden,
Graffiti comes out...

1047
01:05:30,813 --> 01:05:33,083
and it's a big huge, smash success.

1048
01:05:33,153 --> 01:05:37,453
So his agent came back
and said, ''Hey, look.

1049
01:05:37,523 --> 01:05:40,423
This guy has made
this huge successful movie.

1050
01:05:41,193 --> 01:05:44,393
Don't you think we should get more than
a couple hundred thousand dollars...

1051
01:05:44,463 --> 01:05:46,483
for writing, directing
and producing a movie?''

1052
01:05:47,163 --> 01:05:49,493
I said, ''Yeah. I think
he should get more. ''

1053
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:53,503
I was very careful to say, ''I don't want
more money. I don't want more points.

1054
01:05:53,573 --> 01:05:55,333
I don't want anything financial.

1055
01:05:55,403 --> 01:05:58,503
But I do want the right
to make these sequels.''

1056
01:05:59,043 --> 01:06:01,443
I was working on the assumption
every filmmaker works on...

1057
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:03,443
which is the film
will be a disaster...

1058
01:06:03,513 --> 01:06:06,743
and that it won't be promoted
and it'll just die a horrible death.

1059
01:06:06,823 --> 01:06:10,153
And it'll be very hard to get
these next two movies made.

1060
01:06:10,223 --> 01:06:13,923
George said, ''I'd like
a big slice of the merchandising. ''

1061
01:06:15,793 --> 01:06:21,663
Up until that time, merchandising
had been relatively unknown.

1062
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:24,133
When I took over the licensing,
I simply said...

1063
01:06:24,203 --> 01:06:27,363
''I'm gonna be able to make T-shirts.
I'm gonna be able to make posters...

1064
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:30,773
and I'm gonna be able to sell this
movie, even though the studio won't. ''

1065
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:35,043
So, I managed to get control of pretty
much everything that was left over...

1066
01:06:35,113 --> 01:06:37,373
that the studio
didn't really care about.

1067
01:06:39,823 --> 01:06:42,513
George was enormously farsighted,
and the studio wasn't...

1068
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:45,143
because they didn't know
that the world was changing.

1069
01:06:45,223 --> 01:06:47,553
George did know the world was changing.
He changed it.

1070
01:06:52,163 --> 01:06:54,493
With his Star Wars contract
completed...

1071
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:57,963
George Lucas
now needed a rebel force...

1072
01:06:58,033 --> 01:07:00,163
up to the challenge
of production.

1073
01:07:00,843 --> 01:07:03,243
In the summer of 1 975...

1074
01:07:03,313 --> 01:07:07,143
he founded the visual effects company
Industrial Light & Magic.

1075
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:11,013
There was no special effects
companies in those days...

1076
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:14,073
and the studios'special effects
department had been disbanded.

1077
01:07:14,153 --> 01:07:16,583
Part of that was because
of the expense...

1078
01:07:16,653 --> 01:07:19,643
and part of it was
that the American taste...

1079
01:07:19,723 --> 01:07:22,353
the culture had gone toward
very realistic-looking films.

1080
01:07:23,433 --> 01:07:26,953
We approached the visual effects
as a grand experiment, saying...

1081
01:07:27,033 --> 01:07:29,933
''Can we do this with a lot of people
who work on architectural models...

1082
01:07:30,003 --> 01:07:33,093
and in commercials and have never made
feature films before?''

1083
01:07:34,273 --> 01:07:37,033
We were kind oflike
a weird kind of fraternity...

1084
01:07:37,113 --> 01:07:40,473
of robotic photography nuts
or something like that.

1085
01:07:40,713 --> 01:07:44,203
I mean, this was a big movie for Fox.
We were doing commercials.

1086
01:07:44,983 --> 01:07:47,073
We all dreamed
about doing a feature...

1087
01:07:47,153 --> 01:07:49,083
and this was like
the dream come true.

1088
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:52,053
So, Star Wars came along
atjust the perfect time for us.

1089
01:07:53,223 --> 01:07:56,493
We moved into a big empty
warehouse in Van Nuys...

1090
01:07:56,733 --> 01:08:00,493
right near the Van Nuys Airport
and basically started from scratch.

1091
01:08:00,563 --> 01:08:04,463
I mean, it was empty. In the early days,
you used to park your car inside.

1092
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:08,403
There was no camera equipment,
no rooms to speak of.

1093
01:08:09,073 --> 01:08:12,803
Supervising at ILM
was John Dykstra...

1094
01:08:12,873 --> 01:08:15,743
an effects cameraman who had worked
under Douglas Trumbull...

1095
01:08:15,813 --> 01:08:18,213
on films like Silent Running.

1096
01:08:18,283 --> 01:08:22,413
I was essentially to be responsible for
doing the visual effects for the film.

1097
01:08:22,483 --> 01:08:27,723
We took the concept of motion control,
which is essentially an old concept...

1098
01:08:27,793 --> 01:08:30,593
ofbeing able to duplicate camera motion
through more than one pass...

1099
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:32,963
so that you can generate
multiple elements of film...

1100
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:37,163
and we made it production-savvy
by tying it into a computer...

1101
01:08:37,233 --> 01:08:39,673
which was, at that point,
custom-built microprocessors.

1102
01:08:39,743 --> 01:08:42,303
There were no PCs.
You didn't go buy a PC.

1103
01:08:42,373 --> 01:08:44,133
We built them from scratch.

1104
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:48,733
At the same time the camera system
was being built...

1105
01:08:48,813 --> 01:08:52,043
another team began constructing
model spaceships.

1106
01:08:52,813 --> 01:08:57,753
I was one of the early hires.
They had a small art department.

1107
01:08:57,993 --> 01:09:03,013
There were some concept models made
out of cardboard and model kit pieces.

1108
01:09:03,863 --> 01:09:06,923
There were some storyboards
and some concept illustrations...

1109
01:09:07,003 --> 01:09:09,403
thatJoeJohnston had done.

1110
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:13,323
There were some paintings
that Ralph McQuarrie had done.

1111
01:09:15,473 --> 01:09:18,103
Everything came
either from my sketches...

1112
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:21,943
or Ralph's paintings and drawings...

1113
01:09:22,643 --> 01:09:25,243
and any input
that George might have.

1114
01:09:25,313 --> 01:09:28,943
There wasn't a lot of
outside influences on Star Wars.

1115
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:45,823
George wanted it to look like
you could actually see the rivets...

1116
01:09:45,903 --> 01:09:48,803
so you could see the logic
ofhow it was made.

1117
01:09:48,873 --> 01:09:51,503
I was originally hired
to work on the Death Star...

1118
01:09:51,573 --> 01:09:53,063
the 40 foot by--

1119
01:09:54,213 --> 01:09:58,443
What was it? 40-by-80 feet or
40-by-60 feet or something like that.

1120
01:09:58,513 --> 01:10:02,143
Nobody wanted thejob, because you had
to spend a lot of time on your knees.

1121
01:10:03,153 --> 01:10:06,643
Everybody sort of cross-trained
and worked in different techniques.

1122
01:10:06,863 --> 01:10:08,853
That was different
than the Hollywood system...

1123
01:10:08,923 --> 01:10:11,393
that had very strict union rules.

1124
01:10:11,463 --> 01:10:14,163
But there was no way this work
could be done that way...

1125
01:10:14,233 --> 01:10:17,463
or no way that the Hollywood unions
could understand what we were doing.

1126
01:10:18,773 --> 01:10:21,003
With preproduction
gaining momentum...

1127
01:10:21,073 --> 01:10:24,943
Lucas next began the process
of casting his galactic opus.

1128
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:28,533
He shared the audition stage
with his friend, Brian De Palma...

1129
01:10:28,613 --> 01:10:32,273
who was seeking actors
for the Stephen King shocker Carrie.

1130
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:35,443
We were both making these movies
and casting at the same time...

1131
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:37,453
so we decided to combine
our efforts.

1132
01:10:37,693 --> 01:10:41,493
I've made movies with very young people
that have no track record...

1133
01:10:41,563 --> 01:10:43,323
so I have to discover them.

1134
01:10:43,393 --> 01:10:46,923
Pick them and then test them
and go through them and have readings.

1135
01:10:47,003 --> 01:10:51,833
It takes a long time. I spent probably
six or seven months casting Star Wars.

1136
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:56,463
That's a long process to sit
in a little room and interview people.

1137
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:58,373
And I interviewed
thousands of people.

1138
01:10:59,043 --> 01:11:03,503
In casting the male leads,
Luke Starkiller and Han Solo...

1139
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:05,513
Lucas looked for
individual screen presence...

1140
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:07,573
as well as chemistry
between performers.

1141
01:11:07,653 --> 01:11:09,143
Action.

1142
01:11:10,323 --> 01:11:12,553
It checks out again.
There's no mistake.

1143
01:11:13,863 --> 01:11:17,523
- You can't find Organa Major?
- I found it. It's just not there.

1144
01:11:17,863 --> 01:11:19,953
I found it.
It's just not there.

1145
01:11:20,033 --> 01:11:22,393
What's left of it
is contaminated.

1146
01:11:22,463 --> 01:11:24,303
That's it there.

1147
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:26,393
Look at those radiation readouts.
It's impossible.

1148
01:11:26,473 --> 01:11:30,273
-I've never seen anything like it.
-The Empire must have gotten here first.

1149
01:11:30,343 --> 01:11:32,363
The planet has been
completely blown away.

1150
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,303
For the pivotal role of Luke...

1151
01:11:35,383 --> 01:11:39,583
Lucas needed an actor who could
project both intelligence and integrity.

1152
01:11:40,483 --> 01:11:42,973
She's part of the royal family.
They won't get anything out of her.

1153
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:44,753
She knows the power of mind control.

1154
01:11:45,153 --> 01:11:48,493
She's part of the royal family.
They won't get any information from her.

1155
01:11:48,563 --> 01:11:50,533
She knows the art of mind control.

1156
01:11:51,963 --> 01:11:55,953
Twenty-four-year-old Mark Hamill was
a familiar face on television.

1157
01:11:56,033 --> 01:12:01,133
A newcomer to films, his wholesome,
easygoing manner fit the part perfectly.

1158
01:12:01,203 --> 01:12:04,373
I can remember a line
from the screen test...

1159
01:12:04,443 --> 01:12:06,633
which I don't think
ever will leave me.

1160
01:12:07,543 --> 01:12:11,243
Luke says, ''But we can't turn back.
Fear is their greatest defense.

1161
01:12:11,313 --> 01:12:14,513
I doubt the security is any greater
than it was on Aquilae or Sullust...

1162
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:17,643
and what there is is most likely
directed towards a large-scale assault.''

1163
01:12:18,093 --> 01:12:20,153
Fear is their greatest defense.

1164
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:23,163
I doubt the security is much greater
than on Aquilae or Sullust...

1165
01:12:23,223 --> 01:12:26,063
and what there is is most likely
directed towards a large-scale assault.

1166
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,723
I read that line and I thought,
''Who talks like this?''

1167
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,863
So I just did it sincerely.

1168
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:34,403
How many more systems
must get blown away...

1169
01:12:34,473 --> 01:12:36,703
before you have no place to hide
and are forced to fight?

1170
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:38,713
Don't you realize what's going on?

1171
01:12:39,443 --> 01:12:42,243
Kid, you take the glory
and the good intentions.

1172
01:12:42,313 --> 01:12:44,283
I'll take the reward.

1173
01:12:45,213 --> 01:12:47,983
The role of Han Solo
needed someone older...

1174
01:12:48,053 --> 01:12:49,743
with a more cynical edge.

1175
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:52,723
What's that little droid carrying
that's so blasted important?

1176
01:12:52,793 --> 01:12:56,153
What's the little droid carrying
that's so important?

1177
01:12:58,033 --> 01:13:01,523
Harrison Ford had worked
with Lucas on American Graffiti.

1178
01:13:01,603 --> 01:13:04,763
But because the director
initially only wanted new faces...

1179
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,803
he was not allowed to audition.

1180
01:13:06,873 --> 01:13:09,363
Do I have to sit up
to get in on the right?

1181
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:13,643
Instead, he was brought in
to feed lines to the other actors.

1182
01:13:13,713 --> 01:13:18,243
I was given sides and asked if
I would help read the other actors.

1183
01:13:18,483 --> 01:13:22,973
It became my task to explain to the
other actors who were coming along...

1184
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:26,713
just what it was that these sides...

1185
01:13:28,323 --> 01:13:30,023
were meant to be about.

1186
01:13:30,093 --> 01:13:32,723
They're gonna follow us.
They'll destroy your hidden bases.

1187
01:13:32,793 --> 01:13:34,963
- They'll destroy the whole system.
- I know.

1188
01:13:35,033 --> 01:13:36,833
They'll bring the Death Star too.

1189
01:13:37,733 --> 01:13:40,703
Lucas may have been reluctant
to use Ford at first...

1190
01:13:40,773 --> 01:13:44,263
but the actor won him over by
giving Han a mix of mercenary swagger...

1191
01:13:44,343 --> 01:13:46,473
and world-weariness.

1192
01:13:46,543 --> 01:13:50,603
Well, what was so clear was what the
idea was of the character relationships.

1193
01:13:50,683 --> 01:13:53,883
Mark was the callow youth,
I was the smart-ass...

1194
01:13:53,953 --> 01:13:57,653
and we each had
a clear section of turfto explore.

1195
01:13:58,653 --> 01:14:00,923
The planet's totally blown away.

1196
01:14:01,663 --> 01:14:05,563
It would've taken 1 ,000 ships with more
firepower than I've ever seen to do it.

1197
01:14:06,663 --> 01:14:09,603
If the Empire had a new weapon
that could do this, I'd know about it.

1198
01:14:09,663 --> 01:14:11,603
I'd have heard something.

1199
01:14:11,673 --> 01:14:13,603
Well, you know about it now.

1200
01:14:13,673 --> 01:14:16,103
The enemy's on the move.
We haven't much time.

1201
01:14:16,173 --> 01:14:19,833
- I brought you here. Now what?
- We've got to find the rebels.

1202
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:25,073
- What we're carrying belongs to them.
- Their bases are very well hidden, son.

1203
01:14:25,153 --> 01:14:27,553
All the power of the Empire
can't find 'em.

1204
01:14:27,623 --> 01:14:29,413
Do you know where they are?

1205
01:14:29,483 --> 01:14:30,713
No. Not anymore.

1206
01:14:30,793 --> 01:14:34,313
I'm not gonna take you on
an impossible chase across the galaxy.

1207
01:14:34,393 --> 01:14:36,883
Virtually every young actress
in Hollywood...

1208
01:14:36,963 --> 01:14:39,293
tried out for the part
of Princess Leia.

1209
01:14:39,363 --> 01:14:42,303
Although the character
was the same age as Luke...

1210
01:14:42,363 --> 01:14:44,963
as a leader of the rebellion
Leia needed to project...

1211
01:14:45,033 --> 01:14:47,023
a confidence beyond her years.

1212
01:14:47,103 --> 01:14:51,403
The plans and specifications
to a battle station...

1213
01:14:51,473 --> 01:14:53,533
with enough firepower
to destroy an entire system.

1214
01:14:53,613 --> 01:14:56,543
Our only hope in destroying it
is to find its weakness...

1215
01:14:56,613 --> 01:14:59,813
which we will determine
from the data I stored in R2.

1216
01:14:59,883 --> 01:15:02,323
Now, our only hope
in destroying it...

1217
01:15:02,383 --> 01:15:04,323
is to find its weakness...

1218
01:15:04,393 --> 01:15:06,413
which we'll do from the data
I stored in R2.

1219
01:15:07,093 --> 01:15:11,323
Okay? Now, we've captured the plans
in a raid on the imperial shipyards.

1220
01:15:11,393 --> 01:15:14,333
But we fell under attack before
I could get the data to safety...

1221
01:15:14,403 --> 01:15:17,023
so I hid it in R2
and sent him off.

1222
01:15:17,103 --> 01:15:21,973
When R2 has been safely delivered
to my forces, you get your reward.

1223
01:15:22,043 --> 01:15:23,973
You have my guarantee.

1224
01:15:24,043 --> 01:15:27,343
What's the little droid carrying
that's so blasted important?

1225
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,313
The plans and specifications...

1226
01:15:30,383 --> 01:15:32,813
to a battle station
with enough firepower...

1227
01:15:32,883 --> 01:15:34,873
to destroy an entire system.

1228
01:15:36,153 --> 01:15:38,093
One actress in particular...

1229
01:15:38,153 --> 01:15:40,423
seemed tailor-made
to play a princess.

1230
01:15:40,493 --> 01:15:44,293
As the daughter of actress Debbie
Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher...

1231
01:15:44,363 --> 01:15:48,163
Carrie Fisher was the product
of Hollywood royalty.

1232
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:51,963
She had no trouble conveying the
self-assurance needed for Leia Organa.

1233
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:54,093
I met with Brian De Palma
and George...

1234
01:15:54,173 --> 01:15:56,473
and Brian did all the talking...

1235
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,973
because George didn't talk then.

1236
01:15:59,173 --> 01:16:04,483
There were incredible actresses my age
being considered for this role...

1237
01:16:04,553 --> 01:16:06,643
so I didn't think I would get it.

1238
01:16:07,123 --> 01:16:10,413
But our only hope is to destroy it
before it destroys us.

1239
01:16:11,953 --> 01:16:14,153
Hiding is useless now.

1240
01:16:14,223 --> 01:16:17,423
With the Death Star, they'll continue
to go on destroying systems...

1241
01:16:17,493 --> 01:16:19,433
until they've found us.

1242
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:22,433
We have no alternative
but to process the information...

1243
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:24,693
and use it while there's still time.

1244
01:16:24,773 --> 01:16:28,403
I got it with the proviso
that I went to a fat farm...

1245
01:16:29,473 --> 01:16:31,963
and that I lose 1 0 pounds.

1246
01:16:32,043 --> 01:16:36,503
I think they were hoping it was gonna
come out five here and five here.

1247
01:16:36,913 --> 01:16:40,513
My character was someone
who was feisty and all of that...

1248
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:43,523
but I felt myself
to be a bit of that too...

1249
01:16:43,593 --> 01:16:47,893
so it would have been unlikely that
I would be cast as a shrinking violet.

1250
01:16:47,963 --> 01:16:50,323
He cast us to type, in a way.

1251
01:16:51,633 --> 01:16:54,063
Lucas's decision to hire unknowns...

1252
01:16:54,133 --> 01:16:57,193
went against the advice ofhis friend
Francis Ford Coppola...

1253
01:16:57,273 --> 01:17:00,463
who had cast The Godfather
with stage and screen stars.

1254
01:17:01,803 --> 01:17:03,743
20th Century Fox
was also concerned...

1255
01:17:03,813 --> 01:17:05,773
about Lucas's choice of actors.

1256
01:17:06,443 --> 01:17:10,743
They came and said, ''These are the three
unknown people I want to go with. ''

1257
01:17:12,153 --> 01:17:15,313
I figured we'd gone down this far
in the road, he knows what he's doing.

1258
01:17:15,783 --> 01:17:19,693
I'd be lying if I said
''Oh, my God, Harrison's perfect...

1259
01:17:19,753 --> 01:17:23,553
Carrie is perfect,
and Mark is fantastic. ''

1260
01:17:24,463 --> 01:17:27,053
No, I was very nervous
about the cast.

1261
01:17:27,133 --> 01:17:31,293
For the important role of
aged Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi...

1262
01:17:31,373 --> 01:17:34,633
Lucas recognized that
he needed an established star.

1263
01:17:35,303 --> 01:17:38,603
Sir Alec Guinness was
a veteran of over 40 films...

1264
01:17:38,673 --> 01:17:40,943
and had won an Oscar in 1 958...

1265
01:17:41,013 --> 01:17:44,273
for his performance in
The Bridge on the River Kwai.

1266
01:17:44,353 --> 01:17:48,083
The knighted actor had
the pedigree and the persona.

1267
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:50,383
The Alec Guinness role...

1268
01:17:50,453 --> 01:17:54,353
required a certain stability
and gravitas as a character...

1269
01:17:54,423 --> 01:17:59,263
which meant we needed a very strong
character actor to play that part.

1270
01:18:00,403 --> 01:18:02,963
Signing Guinness was a major coup.

1271
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:05,523
But more casting
would be done in London...

1272
01:18:05,603 --> 01:18:07,933
where Star Wars
would be principally produced.

1273
01:18:08,003 --> 01:18:10,943
Unlike Lucas's home base
of Northern California...

1274
01:18:11,013 --> 01:18:14,343
London provided access to the kind of
massive soundstages...

1275
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:17,173
needed for Star Wars's
ambitious sets.

1276
01:18:17,253 --> 01:18:21,773
The location also gave Lucas access
to Britain's top production talents.

1277
01:18:27,093 --> 01:18:31,863
The character of Darth Vader demanded
someone of commanding physical stature.

1278
01:18:33,063 --> 01:18:35,003
To fill Vader's boots...

1279
01:18:35,063 --> 01:18:38,333
Lucas cast champion bodybuilder
David Prowse...

1280
01:18:38,403 --> 01:18:41,993
whose resume included roles
like Frankenstein's creature...

1281
01:18:42,073 --> 01:18:44,603
in Hammer's
popular horror movies.

1282
01:18:44,673 --> 01:18:47,873
As Vader's evil accomplice
Governor Tarkin...

1283
01:18:47,943 --> 01:18:50,173
another Hammer alumnus was cast--

1284
01:18:50,243 --> 01:18:52,803
63-year-old Peter Cushing.

1285
01:18:52,883 --> 01:18:56,653
Best known as the methodical
Professor Van Helsing in Dracula...

1286
01:18:56,723 --> 01:18:58,653
Cushing was the perfect choice...

1287
01:18:58,723 --> 01:19:01,663
to portray the Death Star's
icy chief administrator.

1288
01:19:03,863 --> 01:19:07,923
For the part of Chewbacca, Han Solo's
towering Wookiee copilot...

1289
01:19:08,003 --> 01:19:12,303
Lucas and Kurtz had to look
outside normal casting channels.

1290
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:14,493
But at seven feet, three inches tall...

1291
01:19:14,573 --> 01:19:16,833
it was no stretch for Peter Mayhew...

1292
01:19:16,903 --> 01:19:20,073
who had been working as an orderly
at a Yorkshire hospital.

1293
01:19:20,743 --> 01:19:23,843
I sat down
on one of the sofas...

1294
01:19:24,553 --> 01:19:25,773
waiting for George.

1295
01:19:27,023 --> 01:19:28,353
Door opened...

1296
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,953
and George walked in
with Gary behind him.

1297
01:19:34,023 --> 01:19:35,963
So naturally, what did I do?

1298
01:19:36,023 --> 01:19:37,963
I'm raised in England.

1299
01:19:38,033 --> 01:19:41,693
Soon as someone comes in
through the door, I stand up.

1300
01:19:43,003 --> 01:19:44,493
George goes--

1301
01:19:45,503 --> 01:19:47,993
Virtually turned to Gary and said...

1302
01:19:48,073 --> 01:19:50,043
''I think we've found him.''

1303
01:19:50,773 --> 01:19:55,213
Finding the right performers to portray
robots was even more of a challenge.

1304
01:19:55,743 --> 01:19:59,843
Production designers had constructed
an assortment of robots and androids...

1305
01:19:59,913 --> 01:20:02,183
to populate the Star Wars universe.

1306
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,183
But it would take living,
breathing actors...

1307
01:20:05,253 --> 01:20:08,053
to give personality
to the two main droids...

1308
01:20:08,123 --> 01:20:09,283
C-3PO...

1309
01:20:09,363 --> 01:20:10,883
and R2-D2.

1310
01:20:10,963 --> 01:20:12,953
To operate R2...

1311
01:20:13,033 --> 01:20:17,903
Lucas needed a performer small in
stature, but with a big imagination.

1312
01:20:17,973 --> 01:20:21,773
Enter 3-foot-5-inch
stage comedian Kenny Baker.

1313
01:20:21,843 --> 01:20:24,703
They couldn't find anyone
that would fit inside this robot...

1314
01:20:24,773 --> 01:20:26,713
to make it move.

1315
01:20:26,943 --> 01:20:29,713
They couldn't use kids
'cause it was quite a heavy machine.

1316
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,443
It weighed about 80 pounds.

1317
01:20:31,513 --> 01:20:34,613
I'd had a lot of experience
inside costumes...

1318
01:20:34,683 --> 01:20:39,213
and inside cats and dogs
and goodness knows what else.

1319
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:42,223
So when I got into the robot,
he said, ''Look happy. ''

1320
01:20:42,293 --> 01:20:44,283
So I'd go--

1321
01:20:45,733 --> 01:20:49,163
Inside, nobody could
see my expressions, obviously.

1322
01:20:49,233 --> 01:20:54,223
But you have to do something
to get the feel of the thing.

1323
01:20:55,703 --> 01:20:57,643
Actor Anthony Daniels...

1324
01:20:57,713 --> 01:21:00,643
not only had the slender build
needed for C-3PO...

1325
01:21:00,713 --> 01:21:03,043
but training as a mime artist.

1326
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:05,553
He'd been seeing people
every five minutes.

1327
01:21:05,613 --> 01:21:09,573
I was there for a while and thinking,
''Well, nearly time to go, I guess.''

1328
01:21:09,653 --> 01:21:12,953
And then, kind of over
George's shoulder, I saw a painting...

1329
01:21:13,023 --> 01:21:14,953
and the most extraordinary
thing happened.

1330
01:21:15,023 --> 01:21:18,123
Itjust struck me, because I kind of
looked at this face...

1331
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:21,953
and the face looked back at me, and we
had this extraordinary eye contact.

1332
01:21:22,033 --> 01:21:24,693
He's looking out of the picture
and seemed to be saying...

1333
01:21:25,373 --> 01:21:27,303
''Come. Come. Be with me.''

1334
01:21:27,373 --> 01:21:29,503
The vulnerability in his face...

1335
01:21:30,513 --> 01:21:32,203
made me want to help him.

1336
01:21:32,273 --> 01:21:35,303
Isn't that weird?
He just looks utterly vulnerable.

1337
01:21:35,383 --> 01:21:39,543
That painting completely changed
my attitude to the whole project.

1338
01:21:40,213 --> 01:21:43,153
Years later I was able to go
to Ralph McQuarrie and say...

1339
01:21:43,223 --> 01:21:46,153
''You realize this is all your fault.''

1340
01:21:49,423 --> 01:21:53,153
In March 1 976,
with casting completed...

1341
01:21:53,233 --> 01:21:56,633
George Lucas and company
arrived in North Africa.

1342
01:21:57,673 --> 01:22:01,603
It was a strange caravan of British
and American filmmakers...

1343
01:22:01,673 --> 01:22:06,113
working in a French-speaking nation
on a script few people believed in.

1344
01:22:07,113 --> 01:22:12,013
The overriding thing for me
at that stage was...

1345
01:22:12,213 --> 01:22:16,953
the amount of work that we had to do,
of stuff there was to achieve...

1346
01:22:17,523 --> 01:22:20,453
and we had grave doubts
about getting it done in time.

1347
01:22:25,163 --> 01:22:28,033
But the trial by fire
had yet to begin.

1348
01:22:28,103 --> 01:22:30,533
It was now up to Lucas
to make his movie.

1349
01:22:31,433 --> 01:22:33,303
Just one day into filming...

1350
01:22:33,373 --> 01:22:37,203
the Sahara was pelted with its
first major rainfall in 50 years.

1351
01:22:37,873 --> 01:22:41,143
We were going out there
to shoot on the salt flat.

1352
01:22:41,343 --> 01:22:44,903
I came out in the morning and the rain
was going horizontally down the street.

1353
01:22:45,653 --> 01:22:47,583
I thought, ''My God--''

1354
01:22:47,653 --> 01:22:50,713
I called a rest day on the crew,
told them to go back to bed...

1355
01:22:50,793 --> 01:22:53,483
because there was no way
we were gonna shoot on that.

1356
01:22:57,233 --> 01:23:00,093
The first two weeks of shooting,
we'd run into a lot of weather problems.

1357
01:23:00,163 --> 01:23:03,153
The sets had blown down,
I didn't get everything shot.

1358
01:23:03,363 --> 01:23:07,163
It was a disaster. At that point
I was pretty depressed, saying...

1359
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:11,643
''I've got myself in way over my head.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.''

1360
01:23:11,713 --> 01:23:14,703
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

1361
01:23:16,883 --> 01:23:20,073
With temperatures topping
1 00 degrees by midmorning...

1362
01:23:20,153 --> 01:23:23,283
Tunisia was anything
but fun in the sun.

1363
01:23:24,053 --> 01:23:26,613
Baking for hours
in heavy costume...

1364
01:23:26,693 --> 01:23:29,323
even the film's stunt coordinator,
Peter Diamond...

1365
01:23:29,393 --> 01:23:31,953
found the conditions
physically exhausting.

1366
01:23:32,033 --> 01:23:36,293
I was the only stuntperson
on the picture in Tunisia.

1367
01:23:36,363 --> 01:23:39,463
I became a Tusken Raider,
or a Sandperson.

1368
01:23:41,043 --> 01:23:44,303
I'm not a sun merchant.
I don't like the sun. I just burn.

1369
01:23:44,943 --> 01:23:47,033
So I just died
with the heat of it.

1370
01:23:47,113 --> 01:23:49,303
I couldn't stand it anymore,
it was so hot.

1371
01:23:49,383 --> 01:23:53,613
There were so many problems.
Itjust was not a good location.

1372
01:23:53,683 --> 01:23:57,243
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

1373
01:23:57,323 --> 01:24:00,383
C-3PO was finally...

1374
01:24:00,893 --> 01:24:03,363
put together
for the very first time...

1375
01:24:03,423 --> 01:24:05,593
the day before
we started shooting.

1376
01:24:06,863 --> 01:24:09,763
R2-D2 didn't really
function that well.

1377
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:12,323
He could run along
in the three-legged position...

1378
01:24:12,403 --> 01:24:15,343
but he couldn't turn his head
at the same time.

1379
01:24:15,943 --> 01:24:18,203
There were wires everywhere.

1380
01:24:18,273 --> 01:24:20,803
The head was on a track
ofball bearings.

1381
01:24:20,883 --> 01:24:25,113
I used to grab whatever I could and turn
it physically that way and that way.

1382
01:24:25,183 --> 01:24:26,813
Not very far.

1383
01:24:28,183 --> 01:24:31,023
If I went too far the wires
would go around my neck.

1384
01:24:31,093 --> 01:24:33,713
Then they'd say, ''Cut.!
Right, break for lunch. ''

1385
01:24:34,563 --> 01:24:36,893
And everybody'djust
walk away and leave me.

1386
01:24:36,963 --> 01:24:39,723
Then they'd remember me eventually.

1387
01:24:39,793 --> 01:24:41,563
That happened many times.

1388
01:24:42,433 --> 01:24:44,963
It was bad enough putting
on the costume for the first time...

1389
01:24:45,033 --> 01:24:48,263
and within two paces the left leg
had shattered down...

1390
01:24:48,343 --> 01:24:51,273
onto the plastic of the left foot...

1391
01:24:51,343 --> 01:24:54,213
and was gently
but forcibly and persistently...

1392
01:24:54,283 --> 01:24:55,773
knifing it...

1393
01:24:57,313 --> 01:25:00,183
into the soft part of my foot.

1394
01:25:00,253 --> 01:25:04,083
So we took it off,and I limped
to the set with one foot.

1395
01:25:04,153 --> 01:25:08,383
It was then I began to panic
about the days to come.

1396
01:25:11,163 --> 01:25:15,153
As the actors and crew began to grumble
about the adverse conditions...

1397
01:25:15,233 --> 01:25:19,133
it was Sir Alec Guinness who served
as a role model of professionalism.

1398
01:25:19,933 --> 01:25:23,103
It was, for me, fascinating
to watch Alec Guinness.

1399
01:25:23,173 --> 01:25:26,263
He was always prepared,
always professional...

1400
01:25:26,343 --> 01:25:28,213
always very kind to the other actors.

1401
01:25:28,283 --> 01:25:32,113
He had a very clear head
about how to serve the story.

1402
01:25:32,183 --> 01:25:36,313
He was the person who sort of
brought it some legitimacy.

1403
01:25:36,383 --> 01:25:38,683
I asked him
why he wanted to do it.

1404
01:25:38,853 --> 01:25:41,693
He loved the idea
of playing a mentor or a wizard...

1405
01:25:41,763 --> 01:25:43,693
in a morality play...

1406
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:46,253
where good and evil
are so clearly defined.

1407
01:25:47,133 --> 01:25:48,623
Action!

1408
01:25:50,873 --> 01:25:54,363
- How long have you had these droids?
- Three or four seasons.

1409
01:25:54,443 --> 01:25:56,873
They're up for sale if you want them.

1410
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,373
Let me see your identification.

1411
01:25:58,443 --> 01:26:00,773
You don't need to see
his identification.

1412
01:26:01,443 --> 01:26:03,383
I don't need to see
your identification.

1413
01:26:03,443 --> 01:26:05,883
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

1414
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:07,883
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

1415
01:26:07,953 --> 01:26:10,143
He can go about his business.

1416
01:26:10,223 --> 01:26:12,153
You can go about your business.

1417
01:26:12,823 --> 01:26:14,293
Move along.

1418
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:19,923
Lucas, meanwhile...

1419
01:26:19,993 --> 01:26:21,933
was up to his neck
in malfunctioning props...

1420
01:26:22,363 --> 01:26:24,333
electronic breakdowns...

1421
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:26,303
and other production woes.

1422
01:26:27,373 --> 01:26:31,033
Star Wars was already
struggling to stay on schedule.

1423
01:26:31,813 --> 01:26:35,113
The only silver lining
was that after Tunisia...

1424
01:26:35,183 --> 01:26:38,113
the production would be moving to
a more controlled environment--

1425
01:26:38,183 --> 01:26:40,653
Elstree Studios outside London.

1426
01:26:42,123 --> 01:26:45,423
The stages at Elstree were among
the largest in the world...

1427
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:48,653
and the sets, now finished
after months of construction...

1428
01:26:48,723 --> 01:26:50,713
werejust as impressive.

1429
01:26:50,793 --> 01:26:54,893
For the first time,
the entire Star Wars cast was together.

1430
01:26:56,263 --> 01:26:58,363
That was almost like
a whole separate movie.

1431
01:26:58,433 --> 01:27:00,533
It was like getting
a whole, fresh start.

1432
01:27:00,603 --> 01:27:02,803
And it was all new, really.

1433
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:06,503
We were all
very different ages.

1434
01:27:06,573 --> 01:27:08,873
I was 1 9, Harrison was 33.

1435
01:27:08,943 --> 01:27:11,843
He was sort of
the big man on campus.

1436
01:27:11,913 --> 01:27:16,183
Meeting him,you sort of felt,
''Well, he'll be a movie star. ''

1437
01:27:17,053 --> 01:27:20,153
Costumes, makeup,
robots and aliens...

1438
01:27:20,223 --> 01:27:22,853
were all ready to go.

1439
01:27:22,923 --> 01:27:28,593
I put that mask on
and Chewie transformed me.

1440
01:27:28,663 --> 01:27:32,103
I transformed.
The attitude was different.

1441
01:27:32,173 --> 01:27:34,963
The walk was different.
Chewie turned on.

1442
01:27:35,043 --> 01:27:38,843
Do the scenes, come back,
take the mask off...

1443
01:27:38,913 --> 01:27:40,843
Peter was back.

1444
01:27:42,143 --> 01:27:43,473
Action.

1445
01:27:43,543 --> 01:27:45,573
That old man's mad.

1446
01:27:45,653 --> 01:27:47,583
You said it, Chewie.

1447
01:27:47,653 --> 01:27:50,283
Boy, where did you
dig up that old fossil?

1448
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:53,683
- Ben is a great man.
- Great at getting us into trouble.

1449
01:27:53,753 --> 01:27:55,953
I didn't hear you give any ideas.

1450
01:27:56,023 --> 01:27:57,423
Cut.

1451
01:28:01,503 --> 01:28:03,333
But working
at Elstree Studios...

1452
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:06,263
didn't mean the production
was free from problems...

1453
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:08,703
or strict British union regulations.

1454
01:28:09,303 --> 01:28:11,773
At 5:30 we had to stop...

1455
01:28:11,843 --> 01:28:14,573
unless we were
in the middle of a shot.

1456
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:19,153
I could ask the crew
for an extra 1 5 minutes...

1457
01:28:19,853 --> 01:28:21,783
but they always voted me down.

1458
01:28:22,453 --> 01:28:25,753
Not to put down the British crew, but
there was an attitude of''What's this?''

1459
01:28:26,423 --> 01:28:29,053
It didn't help that most
of the crew thought Star Wars...

1460
01:28:29,123 --> 01:28:31,063
was just a children's film.

1461
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:35,153
At times even the actors were
hard-pressed to take the work seriously.

1462
01:28:35,903 --> 01:28:38,193
Didn't think it was gonna be any good.
At least I didn't.

1463
01:28:38,273 --> 01:28:40,133
I thought, ''This is a bit strange.''

1464
01:28:40,533 --> 01:28:42,403
I can remember
this lighting man--

1465
01:28:42,473 --> 01:28:46,933
He said, ''What is all this about?
It's a load of rubbish. ''

1466
01:28:47,013 --> 01:28:51,813
And we all thought the same at
the time-- ''Yeah, it's a bit strange.''

1467
01:28:51,883 --> 01:28:53,713
Action!

1468
01:28:54,213 --> 01:28:58,983
It was a princess with her hair
in weird buns on the side...

1469
01:28:59,053 --> 01:29:02,853
and a giant in a monkey suit
or something.

1470
01:29:02,923 --> 01:29:05,223
I mean,
it was very, very weird.

1471
01:29:05,663 --> 01:29:08,423
No more adventures!
I'm not getting involved!

1472
01:29:08,503 --> 01:29:11,993
Don't you call me a mindless philosopher
you overweight glob of grease!

1473
01:29:12,073 --> 01:29:13,563
Bang!

1474
01:29:14,773 --> 01:29:16,603
I'm going to regret this.

1475
01:29:16,673 --> 01:29:18,543
It was tough dialogue to say.

1476
01:29:18,613 --> 01:29:23,543
So I got, ''Governor Tarkin, I thought
I recognized your foul stench. ''

1477
01:29:23,613 --> 01:29:27,603
Which, I don't know about you,
but I'm always talking like that.

1478
01:29:29,083 --> 01:29:30,573
Governor Tarkin.

1479
01:29:30,653 --> 01:29:33,553
I should have expected to find you
holding Vader's leash.

1480
01:29:33,623 --> 01:29:36,993
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

1481
01:29:37,063 --> 01:29:38,993
Charming to the last.

1482
01:29:39,063 --> 01:29:42,433
We used to say, ''You can type
this stuff, but you can't say it.''

1483
01:29:45,233 --> 01:29:48,173
George didn't really like
being in London...

1484
01:29:48,243 --> 01:29:50,503
I suppose,
is the best way to say it.

1485
01:29:50,573 --> 01:29:52,733
He doesn't like
being away from home.

1486
01:29:52,813 --> 01:29:54,743
He's not the most
gregarious person in the world.

1487
01:29:55,243 --> 01:29:57,443
He had some clashes
with the cameraman.

1488
01:29:57,513 --> 01:30:02,683
Gil Taylor was a very old-school
cameraman-- very crotchety.

1489
01:30:02,853 --> 01:30:06,513
George, coming out of
low-budget filmmaking...

1490
01:30:07,123 --> 01:30:09,063
was used to doing
a lot of things himself.

1491
01:30:09,123 --> 01:30:13,393
So George would say things like,
''Well, put a light here. ''

1492
01:30:13,463 --> 01:30:16,263
And Gil took offense
at that kind of thing.

1493
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:18,663
He says, ''That's not yourjob, son. ''

1494
01:30:19,733 --> 01:30:23,003
''You tell me what
you want to see, and I'll do it...

1495
01:30:23,073 --> 01:30:26,013
the way I think is best
to create what you want to see.''

1496
01:30:26,073 --> 01:30:28,303
It was a clash
of style of working.

1497
01:30:28,383 --> 01:30:30,573
Slate 3 27, take four.

1498
01:30:30,643 --> 01:30:32,643
We're coming up
on Alderaan.

1499
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:37,923
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

1500
01:30:37,993 --> 01:30:39,323
That's good.

1501
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:42,293
You've taken your first step
into a larger world.

1502
01:30:45,663 --> 01:30:47,633
Lucas also became frustrated...

1503
01:30:47,703 --> 01:30:50,823
that the costumes, sets
and other production elements...

1504
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:53,703
weren't living up
to his vision for Star Wars.

1505
01:30:53,773 --> 01:30:57,263
The compromises required
due to the film's budget...

1506
01:30:57,343 --> 01:30:59,603
plagued him
on an almost daily basis.

1507
01:30:59,673 --> 01:31:02,303
What was disappointing
would be the cantina sequence.

1508
01:31:02,383 --> 01:31:05,313
It was really
imaginatively described...

1509
01:31:05,383 --> 01:31:07,313
and then you go in there...

1510
01:31:07,383 --> 01:31:09,143
and it looks like
The Nutcracker Suite.

1511
01:31:09,223 --> 01:31:11,953
There's a frog guy
and a mouse girl...

1512
01:31:13,453 --> 01:31:15,183
and a giant cricket at the bar.

1513
01:31:15,263 --> 01:31:17,783
It was just really disappointing.

1514
01:31:18,393 --> 01:31:21,763
But George says, ''Don't worry.
We're gonna fix all of this. ''

1515
01:31:24,933 --> 01:31:29,103
We didn't see anything
of what ended up on the screen.

1516
01:31:29,173 --> 01:31:31,873
So when they blew my planet up...

1517
01:31:31,943 --> 01:31:35,643
I was looking at a guy going like this
against a board with a circle on it.

1518
01:31:35,713 --> 01:31:37,303
I mean, it was funny.

1519
01:31:37,383 --> 01:31:39,613
Proceed with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

1520
01:31:39,683 --> 01:31:40,483
What?

1521
01:31:40,553 --> 01:31:43,243
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

1522
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:46,083
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

1523
01:31:49,593 --> 01:31:50,963
Bang!

1524
01:31:51,633 --> 01:31:54,493
And you call yourselves humans.

1525
01:31:55,763 --> 01:31:57,253
George never talked.

1526
01:31:57,333 --> 01:31:59,863
We felt he wanted us
to hit our marks...

1527
01:31:59,933 --> 01:32:02,373
and magically
accommodate our dialogue.

1528
01:32:02,443 --> 01:32:06,373
He lost his voice at one point.
We didn't know that for days.

1529
01:32:06,443 --> 01:32:09,203
And we wanted to get him
a little board that said...

1530
01:32:09,913 --> 01:32:11,613
''Faster and more intense.''

1531
01:32:11,683 --> 01:32:13,343
That was his main direction.

1532
01:32:13,753 --> 01:32:16,343
Hejust wanted us
to speed through it.

1533
01:32:16,423 --> 01:32:19,283
George is notorious
for saying, after a take...

1534
01:32:19,353 --> 01:32:21,343
''Do it again.
Faster, more intensity. ''

1535
01:32:21,593 --> 01:32:25,123
He certainly said to me, ''Terrific,
Tony. Can you do it again, faster?''

1536
01:32:25,793 --> 01:32:27,593
But I didn't get
''more intensity.''

1537
01:32:27,663 --> 01:32:30,533
I didn't think 3PO with more intensity
would be bearable. Do you?

1538
01:32:31,503 --> 01:32:34,703
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

1539
01:32:34,773 --> 01:32:37,433
The main entrance seems
to be the only way in or out.

1540
01:32:37,503 --> 01:32:39,903
We all had to fill in
a lot of the blanks.

1541
01:32:39,973 --> 01:32:43,933
It was more a matter of, if we did
something he didn't like he'd tell us...

1542
01:32:44,013 --> 01:32:47,213
rather than telling us what to do.

1543
01:32:47,283 --> 01:32:48,913
I think George likes people.

1544
01:32:48,983 --> 01:32:52,713
I think George
is a warmhearted person.

1545
01:32:52,793 --> 01:32:56,223
But, yeah, he's a little impatient
with the process of acting...

1546
01:32:56,293 --> 01:32:59,023
of finding something,
you know.

1547
01:32:59,093 --> 01:33:01,033
He thinks it's there.

1548
01:33:01,093 --> 01:33:03,033
''It's right there.
I wrote it down.'' You know?

1549
01:33:04,103 --> 01:33:09,763
''Do that.'' You know? And sometimes you
can't just ''do that'' and make it work.

1550
01:33:09,843 --> 01:33:12,973
He's really focused on what he's
trying to do and get everything right.

1551
01:33:13,043 --> 01:33:15,913
Is the smoke right?
Did the squibs go off right?

1552
01:33:16,683 --> 01:33:19,313
And we were just
taunting him mercilessly.

1553
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:22,953
Carrie and Mark have
wicked sense ofhumors.

1554
01:33:23,023 --> 01:33:24,953
Carrie was very young...

1555
01:33:25,023 --> 01:33:27,253
and Mark was very young...

1556
01:33:27,453 --> 01:33:29,253
so they were
the junior division...

1557
01:33:29,323 --> 01:33:32,763
and they were always
lurking about on set.

1558
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:35,693
So it kept us in stitches.

1559
01:33:35,763 --> 01:33:38,563
I got one outfit
for the first movie...

1560
01:33:38,633 --> 01:33:40,573
and as George taught me...

1561
01:33:40,633 --> 01:33:42,573
there is no underwear in space.

1562
01:33:42,643 --> 01:33:45,943
Instead of that,
there is gaffer tape.

1563
01:33:46,843 --> 01:33:49,143
So I was taped down.

1564
01:33:49,213 --> 01:33:53,413
And I used to say, we should just
make up a contest on the call sheet...

1565
01:33:53,483 --> 01:33:55,413
as to who's gonna rip it off.

1566
01:33:56,283 --> 01:33:57,913
But we didn't do that.

1567
01:33:57,993 --> 01:34:02,123
We were all goofing around
and trying to make George crack...

1568
01:34:02,193 --> 01:34:04,713
'cause he looked like
he was ready to burst into tears.

1569
01:34:05,463 --> 01:34:06,763
You'd try and cheer him up.

1570
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:08,323
Go.

1571
01:34:13,503 --> 01:34:15,163
- Okay, cut.
- Cut it.

1572
01:34:15,243 --> 01:34:16,733
- And?
- And?

1573
01:34:17,743 --> 01:34:19,673
Carrie and Mark bumped in too early.

1574
01:34:23,443 --> 01:34:25,103
The mike was in frame.

1575
01:34:26,013 --> 01:34:27,783
The mike was in picture.

1576
01:34:27,853 --> 01:34:29,783
The mike was in picture.

1577
01:34:31,853 --> 01:34:33,793
Go back to first positions.

1578
01:34:33,853 --> 01:34:35,793
The sound department
has to pay up.

1579
01:34:35,863 --> 01:34:38,793
That, to him, was really
inappropriate humor at the time...

1580
01:34:38,863 --> 01:34:41,853
because I'm sure he's in the zone
and seeing what he wants to do...

1581
01:34:41,933 --> 01:34:45,663
and we're just actors
trying to stave off boredom...

1582
01:34:45,733 --> 01:34:49,693
because we've been in
the trash compactor all morning.

1583
01:34:49,773 --> 01:34:51,703
Ready? And action!

1584
01:34:52,413 --> 01:34:54,343
- What happened?
- I don't know!

1585
01:34:54,413 --> 01:34:56,383
It just disappeared!

1586
01:34:57,443 --> 01:34:59,973
I got a really bad feeling
about this.

1587
01:35:00,453 --> 01:35:04,543
But it is amazing what you can do
when you have a vision, an ambition...

1588
01:35:04,623 --> 01:35:09,523
and when you can bend
other people's will to your desire.

1589
01:35:09,593 --> 01:35:12,523
The thing that kept it focused
towards the ambitions...

1590
01:35:12,593 --> 01:35:15,583
was George's vision
and his passion for the idea.

1591
01:35:17,433 --> 01:35:20,303
Perhaps the most memorable
stunt in Star Wars...

1592
01:35:20,373 --> 01:35:23,963
was actually performed
by Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher--

1593
01:35:24,043 --> 01:35:26,343
the nick-of-time escape
of Luke and Leia...

1594
01:35:26,413 --> 01:35:28,873
across a yawning chasm
in the Death Star.

1595
01:35:29,643 --> 01:35:31,843
Mark Hamill wanted to do
as much as he could himself.

1596
01:35:31,913 --> 01:35:35,643
I had times when I had to keep him back
because he was too enthusiastic.

1597
01:35:35,723 --> 01:35:37,213
He could've got hurt.

1598
01:35:37,283 --> 01:35:39,983
Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker
had to swing over this void.

1599
01:35:40,053 --> 01:35:43,993
We couldn't afford doubles, so I said,
''I can teach them. It'll be safe. ''

1600
01:35:44,063 --> 01:35:48,223
My buddy and I, we put the harnesses on,
we put the wires on.

1601
01:35:48,303 --> 01:35:50,923
Everyone down below.
Remember, we are about 20 meters up...

1602
01:35:51,003 --> 01:35:52,933
looking down on them.

1603
01:35:53,003 --> 01:35:56,273
And as we swung across
there was a terrible tear.

1604
01:35:57,003 --> 01:36:00,413
My buddy said to me,
''Peter, your harness has snapped.''

1605
01:36:00,473 --> 01:36:02,943
Mark said, ''I'm not going in that.
It's too dangerous. ''

1606
01:36:03,013 --> 01:36:05,843
This is where I discovered
you had to be a good liar.

1607
01:36:05,913 --> 01:36:09,513
I said, ''There's nothing wrong with the
harness. I split my pants as I landed. ''

1608
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:11,553
He said, ''Oh, I thought
that was the harness.''

1609
01:36:11,623 --> 01:36:13,953
I said, ''I wouldn't let you
do this if it was dangerous.''

1610
01:36:14,023 --> 01:36:15,513
Action!

1611
01:36:20,393 --> 01:36:23,663
They did it in one take,
and that's how we got it.

1612
01:36:24,233 --> 01:36:25,203
For luck.

1613
01:36:30,403 --> 01:36:32,703
That was really early on
in the shoot...

1614
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:36,343
when I was still
worried about my weight.

1615
01:36:36,413 --> 01:36:40,013
I thought we were gonna miss
and I'd hit the wall...

1616
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:45,213
and they will say, ''Still too tubby.
Let's bring in Jodie Foster.''

1617
01:36:46,493 --> 01:36:48,583
Another of
Peter Diamond's tasks...

1618
01:36:48,663 --> 01:36:51,493
was choreographing
the dramatic lightsaber battle...

1619
01:36:51,563 --> 01:36:54,493
between Darth Vader
and Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1620
01:36:55,163 --> 01:36:57,103
You can't win, Darth.

1621
01:36:57,163 --> 01:37:00,623
If my blade should find its mark,
you will cease to exist.

1622
01:37:01,303 --> 01:37:03,743
But I warn you,
if you strike me down...

1623
01:37:03,803 --> 01:37:07,473
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1624
01:37:07,543 --> 01:37:10,173
George wanted a broadsword
type of fight...

1625
01:37:10,243 --> 01:37:12,343
with a touch ofJapanese behind it.

1626
01:37:12,413 --> 01:37:15,403
But instead of becoming
samurai moves with one hand...

1627
01:37:15,483 --> 01:37:17,423
I kept it with two hands...

1628
01:37:17,483 --> 01:37:20,543
so all the moves were two hands,
completely like that.

1629
01:37:21,723 --> 01:37:23,883
The first swords
were bits of wood...

1630
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,393
with front-projection material
wrapped around them.

1631
01:37:26,463 --> 01:37:29,403
Now, the hardest thing for me
on the first fights--

1632
01:37:29,463 --> 01:37:32,023
Darth Vader was a very heavy man...

1633
01:37:32,103 --> 01:37:34,863
Obi-Wan Kenobi was
a gentleman, right...

1634
01:37:34,943 --> 01:37:38,393
who had done some fencing
in the theater.

1635
01:37:38,473 --> 01:37:41,103
I had to teach them,
if that was a sword...

1636
01:37:41,173 --> 01:37:43,703
to stop before they touched,
'cause the blades were breaking.

1637
01:37:43,783 --> 01:37:47,143
We broke so many blades.
They just kept snapping.

1638
01:37:52,753 --> 01:37:54,243
- Cut.
- Cut it!

1639
01:37:55,493 --> 01:37:59,823
Across the Atlantic, Fox's head
of production, Alan Ladd,Jr....

1640
01:37:59,893 --> 01:38:01,953
continued to offer Lucas his main...

1641
01:38:02,033 --> 01:38:04,293
if not his only,
support from the studio.

1642
01:38:04,973 --> 01:38:07,093
There was a lot of problems,yes.

1643
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:11,133
Every board meeting I attended,
the subject was always Star Wars.

1644
01:38:11,203 --> 01:38:14,303
''The costs are rising.
It's this, it's that.

1645
01:38:14,373 --> 01:38:16,603
Look, we've read drafts of scripts...

1646
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:19,543
that make no sense to us
in any way, shape or form. ''

1647
01:38:19,613 --> 01:38:21,603
It was rather unpleasant.

1648
01:38:22,423 --> 01:38:25,353
The things that stick in my mind
that made me laugh were, like...

1649
01:38:25,423 --> 01:38:28,443
memos worried about whether or not
the Wookiee should have pants.

1650
01:38:28,523 --> 01:38:30,183
They're looking at this thing
and saying...

1651
01:38:30,263 --> 01:38:32,663
''Couldn't he have some lederhosen?''

1652
01:38:32,893 --> 01:38:36,733
And I thought,
''Isn't this great?

1653
01:38:36,803 --> 01:38:39,263
You know, of all the things
to worry about.

1654
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:41,273
The Wookiee has no pants.''

1655
01:38:43,003 --> 01:38:44,973
I think we were
two weeks over schedule.

1656
01:38:45,043 --> 01:38:49,033
At that point, the board of directors
at Fox started to panic...

1657
01:38:49,343 --> 01:38:54,913
and tell Alan Ladd,Jr. that he had to
shut that film down regardless.

1658
01:38:54,983 --> 01:38:57,073
So he came to me and said...

1659
01:38:57,153 --> 01:38:59,683
''Look, you've gotta finish
in the next week...

1660
01:39:00,353 --> 01:39:03,853
because I've got another board meeting,
and I can't say we're still shooting.''

1661
01:39:04,863 --> 01:39:08,893
I kept phoning their production
department saying, ''This is insane.

1662
01:39:09,163 --> 01:39:12,963
If we put on a second crew, it costs us
more than going an extra week.''

1663
01:39:13,033 --> 01:39:15,373
They said, ''It doesn't matter.
The studio's opinion...

1664
01:39:15,443 --> 01:39:18,503
is that the day deadline is more
important than the money you spend.''

1665
01:39:19,043 --> 01:39:21,803
The final scenes were filmed
at breakneck speed...

1666
01:39:21,883 --> 01:39:23,743
with Lucas
frantically bicycling...

1667
01:39:23,813 --> 01:39:26,373
from one soundstage to another.

1668
01:39:26,453 --> 01:39:30,783
I think George suffered a lot more
than I was aware of at the time.

1669
01:39:30,853 --> 01:39:32,943
But I was very focused
on what I was doing...

1670
01:39:33,023 --> 01:39:36,823
'cause this was a very busy movie,
just nonstop dawn to dusk.

1671
01:39:36,893 --> 01:39:38,883
We did go over at the end...

1672
01:39:38,963 --> 01:39:41,763
and we split into three units
right at the end.

1673
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:44,063
Gary directed the second unit...

1674
01:39:44,133 --> 01:39:48,463
and I had the distinction of directing
the third unit of Star Wars.

1675
01:39:48,543 --> 01:39:53,273
My shots were things like close-up
of R2-D2's third foot going down.

1676
01:39:53,943 --> 01:39:57,073
Nothing too dramatic.
But that's how we finished it.

1677
01:39:57,143 --> 01:39:58,633
Come on.

1678
01:40:00,313 --> 01:40:03,013
Okay, cut. Time up. Cut.

1679
01:40:03,523 --> 01:40:06,973
I hope that old man got the tractor beam
down, or this is gonna be a short trip.

1680
01:40:07,053 --> 01:40:08,823
Hit it!

1681
01:40:08,893 --> 01:40:13,793
Fox originally slated Star Wars
for a Christmas release in 1 976.

1682
01:40:13,863 --> 01:40:15,023
Schmuck.

1683
01:40:15,263 --> 01:40:17,233
463, take one.

1684
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:20,793
But the diffiicult shoot had put
the film severely behind schedule.

1685
01:40:20,873 --> 01:40:22,363
Action.

1686
01:40:22,443 --> 01:40:25,003
- Didn't we just leave this party?
- Give us a growl.

1687
01:40:27,013 --> 01:40:29,103
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1688
01:40:29,183 --> 01:40:31,583
- Is the ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1689
01:40:31,653 --> 01:40:34,513
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

1690
01:40:34,583 --> 01:40:36,613
- Look.
- Now's our chance. Go!

1691
01:40:37,383 --> 01:40:39,443
With barely six months to go...

1692
01:40:39,523 --> 01:40:42,453
there was almost no chance
of delivering the project on time.

1693
01:40:42,523 --> 01:40:43,723
Okay, cut.

1694
01:40:43,793 --> 01:40:46,783
I hadjust finished shooting the movie,
and I was exhausted, basically...

1695
01:40:46,863 --> 01:40:51,663
but I had to go right from the shooting
into the finishing without a break.

1696
01:40:52,633 --> 01:40:55,163
Already anxious
about meeting his deadline...

1697
01:40:55,243 --> 01:40:59,173
Lucas was shocked when he saw the first
assembly ofhis edited film that spring.

1698
01:40:59,243 --> 01:41:01,373
Sir, the groiters are losing power!

1699
01:41:01,443 --> 01:41:03,773
All right. I'll get it.

1700
01:41:04,443 --> 01:41:08,243
The first cut of Star Wars
was an unmitigated disaster.

1701
01:41:08,323 --> 01:41:10,683
- How's that?
- Yes, that's much better.

1702
01:41:10,753 --> 01:41:13,583
I'd started to see things cut together.
I wasn't happy with it.

1703
01:41:13,653 --> 01:41:16,853
I'd come in on weekends,
and I'd recut the film on my own.

1704
01:41:16,923 --> 01:41:18,623
Cut.

1705
01:41:18,693 --> 01:41:20,683
And I tried to get the editor
to cut it my way...

1706
01:41:20,763 --> 01:41:24,293
and he didn't really want to,
and so I had to let the editor go.

1707
01:41:24,363 --> 01:41:26,803
So I had no editor.
I was behind schedule.

1708
01:41:26,873 --> 01:41:28,803
I had to race to finish the movie.

1709
01:41:28,873 --> 01:41:30,803
1 77, take two.

1710
01:41:30,873 --> 01:41:34,273
Lucas realized his only hope
was to start from scratch.

1711
01:41:34,343 --> 01:41:38,143
And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1712
01:41:38,213 --> 01:41:40,873
And this is
my counterpart, R2-D2.

1713
01:41:40,953 --> 01:41:43,183
- Oh, hello.
- Okay, cut.

1714
01:41:44,123 --> 01:41:47,853
To recut the movie, he hired
Paul Hirsch and Richard Chew...

1715
01:41:47,923 --> 01:41:51,363
and for several months he was able
to borrow his wife, Marcia...

1716
01:41:51,423 --> 01:41:54,763
who was editing New York, New York
with Martin Scorsese.

1717
01:41:56,433 --> 01:41:58,423
Slate 250, take seven.

1718
01:41:58,503 --> 01:41:59,493
Action.

1719
01:42:00,703 --> 01:42:03,603
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

1720
01:42:08,343 --> 01:42:10,283
Right now
I don't feel too good.

1721
01:42:10,343 --> 01:42:12,903
On Star Wars,
the trio's first task...

1722
01:42:12,983 --> 01:42:16,643
was to give the film an energy
and pace that was sorely lacking.

1723
01:42:16,723 --> 01:42:17,713
Cut.

1724
01:42:17,783 --> 01:42:23,353
It was cut in a very traditional manner
ofjust playing things out in masters...

1725
01:42:23,423 --> 01:42:25,793
and then going
into the coverage...

1726
01:42:25,863 --> 01:42:30,133
and let the actors'rhythms
dictate the cuts...

1727
01:42:30,203 --> 01:42:32,133
rather than having the cuts...

1728
01:42:32,203 --> 01:42:35,633
kind of drive the rhythm of the scenes.

1729
01:42:36,103 --> 01:42:38,043
21 1 , take three.
Guide track.

1730
01:42:39,643 --> 01:42:41,113
Action!

1731
01:42:43,143 --> 01:42:45,673
So consequently,
there wasn't any excitement...

1732
01:42:45,753 --> 01:42:48,943
in the footage the way
that it had been put together.

1733
01:42:49,023 --> 01:42:50,483
Cut.

1734
01:42:50,553 --> 01:42:52,283
Richard and I would leapfrog.

1735
01:42:52,693 --> 01:42:56,423
If he was on reel one,
I would grab reel two.

1736
01:42:56,493 --> 01:42:58,923
Whoever finished that would
grab reel three and so forth.

1737
01:43:09,843 --> 01:43:13,403
We used shots up until
the very last frame.

1738
01:43:13,473 --> 01:43:15,813
- Cut.
- Can I take another one?

1739
01:43:15,883 --> 01:43:19,943
Very often, the very next frame would be
the flash of the camera stop.

1740
01:43:20,883 --> 01:43:23,543
For instance, there's a shot
of one of the Sandpeople...

1741
01:43:23,623 --> 01:43:27,553
who knocks Luke down, and then
he holds his weapon up over his head.

1742
01:43:27,623 --> 01:43:31,423
He did it once. We rocked it back and
forth so he did it a number of times.

1743
01:43:37,163 --> 01:43:40,463
The only things that are there
is what's presentable...

1744
01:43:40,533 --> 01:43:43,533
and everything
behind the scenes is a mess.

1745
01:43:44,843 --> 01:43:48,273
With no chance
ofbeing ready by Christmas...

1746
01:43:48,343 --> 01:43:51,403
a new release date
was set for summer, 1 977.

1747
01:43:51,483 --> 01:43:54,113
Some doubted that the movie
would ever reach theaters.

1748
01:43:54,553 --> 01:43:57,113
But as bad as things
had been with the editing...

1749
01:43:57,183 --> 01:43:59,673
the situation at ILM
was even worse.

1750
01:44:00,393 --> 01:44:04,223
The company was trying to create effects
that had never been done before.

1751
01:44:04,293 --> 01:44:06,263
They knew what they
wanted to accomplish...

1752
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:09,303
but they had yet to create
anything usable for the film.

1753
01:44:09,363 --> 01:44:11,303
They had spent half their budget...

1754
01:44:11,973 --> 01:44:15,233
and ultimately I had about four shots,
none of which I would accept.

1755
01:44:15,303 --> 01:44:18,603
They were just not good.
That was a low point.

1756
01:44:19,043 --> 01:44:23,003
I had no special effects. I didn't know
if we were gonna get the ships to work.

1757
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:25,013
So it was a pretty desperate time.

1758
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:28,413
And we'd spent half the budget
building the motion-control cameras...

1759
01:44:28,483 --> 01:44:30,283
and setting the shop up.

1760
01:44:30,353 --> 01:44:33,983
It was a disaster to say the least.

1761
01:44:35,153 --> 01:44:36,683
The factory has to be built...

1762
01:44:36,763 --> 01:44:40,193
before the first can of peas
can be sent to the supermarket.

1763
01:44:40,263 --> 01:44:42,393
And I think it was a year or more...

1764
01:44:42,603 --> 01:44:46,223
without any film coming out,
without one shot being finished.

1765
01:44:46,303 --> 01:44:48,863
'Cause they were building
optical printers and cameras.

1766
01:44:49,543 --> 01:44:51,333
We were building models.

1767
01:44:51,403 --> 01:44:53,873
I know that George was
disappointed in the work...

1768
01:44:53,943 --> 01:44:56,973
and I'm disappointed
that he was disappointed.

1769
01:44:57,443 --> 01:45:00,473
But there's a certain subjectivity
to some of that stuff.

1770
01:45:00,553 --> 01:45:04,953
I wish he'd been happier,
but I also think that ultimately...

1771
01:45:05,023 --> 01:45:06,953
the work did thejob.

1772
01:45:16,633 --> 01:45:21,033
When word of the postproduction problems
reached the Fox board of directors...

1773
01:45:21,103 --> 01:45:25,203
they decided they'd had enough of
George Lucas and ''that science movie. ''

1774
01:45:25,873 --> 01:45:28,933
I just sat in one
executive committee meeting...

1775
01:45:29,013 --> 01:45:30,943
where they're hauling me
over the coals.

1776
01:45:31,013 --> 01:45:33,313
I just said,
''It's the greatest picture ever made.''

1777
01:45:33,383 --> 01:45:35,313
That ended the conversation.

1778
01:45:35,383 --> 01:45:39,653
They were afraid to say,
''Well,you're stupid and you're wrong...

1779
01:45:39,723 --> 01:45:42,753
and we want you out of this building
by 5:00 this afternoon. ''

1780
01:45:45,993 --> 01:45:47,983
There were some tense moments there.

1781
01:45:48,833 --> 01:45:50,763
With the dismal
early cut of the film...

1782
01:45:50,833 --> 01:45:54,273
ILM in chaos and growing pressure
from the studio...

1783
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:58,603
Lucas was facing almost
unbearable battles on a daily basis.

1784
01:45:59,143 --> 01:46:01,943
After an especially
tense trip to ILM...

1785
01:46:02,013 --> 01:46:04,443
Lucas felt sharp chest pains.

1786
01:46:04,513 --> 01:46:08,503
Fearing a heart attack, the director
checked into a Marin County hospital.

1787
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:11,783
He was diagnosed with
hypertension and exhaustion...

1788
01:46:11,853 --> 01:46:13,983
and was warned
to reduce his stress level.

1789
01:46:14,053 --> 01:46:16,043
At that point, I really felt...

1790
01:46:17,163 --> 01:46:20,523
I'd gotten myself into a real mess and
didn't know whether I was gonna get out.

1791
01:46:21,063 --> 01:46:23,763
Lucas doubled his efforts
to save Star Wars.

1792
01:46:24,433 --> 01:46:27,763
The situation at ILM
required drastic measures.

1793
01:46:27,833 --> 01:46:30,773
To get the film's crucial
special effects back on track...

1794
01:46:30,843 --> 01:46:34,303
Lucas had no choice
but to step in personally.

1795
01:46:34,373 --> 01:46:37,103
We put a production department in
at the special effects company.

1796
01:46:37,183 --> 01:46:38,673
I went there twice a week.

1797
01:46:38,753 --> 01:46:41,153
There was a certain amount
of resentment at first...

1798
01:46:41,213 --> 01:46:43,743
because they felt...

1799
01:46:43,823 --> 01:46:47,723
that they were being challenged a bit
on how they had set it up.

1800
01:46:47,793 --> 01:46:51,723
We felt that there was a certain
quasi-hippie mentality...

1801
01:46:51,793 --> 01:46:54,393
that some of them had
about the schedule.

1802
01:46:54,463 --> 01:46:56,693
Ultimately, I guess
we were known as a country club.

1803
01:46:56,763 --> 01:46:59,863
I think it looked to those guys
that there needed to be...

1804
01:46:59,933 --> 01:47:02,593
a really strong
production force in there...

1805
01:47:02,673 --> 01:47:06,133
that was going to meet
some sort of quota.

1806
01:47:09,943 --> 01:47:12,313
With hundreds of shots
left to be completed...

1807
01:47:12,383 --> 01:47:16,343
ILM would have to do a year's worth
of work in just six months.

1808
01:47:16,423 --> 01:47:19,323
But Lucas and Kurtz were determined
to turn the situation around.

1809
01:47:24,823 --> 01:47:27,493
Gary was a gearhead,
so he could understand our problems.

1810
01:47:27,563 --> 01:47:30,323
And George is a storyteller...

1811
01:47:30,403 --> 01:47:32,863
and so we have to serve his needs...

1812
01:47:32,933 --> 01:47:35,493
because he's the one
that's telling the story.

1813
01:47:35,573 --> 01:47:38,503
But we had to build these incredible
contraptions in order to do it.

1814
01:47:40,743 --> 01:47:42,943
George was our general.
We're his soldiers.

1815
01:47:43,013 --> 01:47:45,573
And we're all
fighting this single battle...

1816
01:47:45,653 --> 01:47:47,313
to get this film out.

1817
01:47:47,383 --> 01:47:48,853
We were on the front lines...

1818
01:47:49,023 --> 01:47:52,473
and that gave us also
kind of a feeling of being special...

1819
01:47:52,553 --> 01:47:57,113
and fighting this great battle
to get this thing done, whatever it is.

1820
01:48:01,063 --> 01:48:02,553
Luke, pull up.!

1821
01:48:04,133 --> 01:48:06,463
To help inspire
the effects team at ILM...

1822
01:48:06,873 --> 01:48:10,893
Lucas had spliced together aerial
dogfights from old war movies.

1823
01:48:10,973 --> 01:48:14,243
That would be like the first animatic,
which you do in the computer now...

1824
01:48:14,313 --> 01:48:18,003
and we matched frame to frame and
the action on that as close as we could.

1825
01:48:22,183 --> 01:48:23,983
It was hugely helpful.

1826
01:48:25,953 --> 01:48:29,293
- I got him.!
- Great, kid! Don't get cocky.

1827
01:48:29,363 --> 01:48:33,593
To describe that abstract world
of a battle is impossible.

1828
01:48:33,663 --> 01:48:37,323
Storyboards don't do it, as far as the
pacing, the rhythms that he needed.

1829
01:48:41,433 --> 01:48:43,203
- Thanks, Wedge.
- That was great.

1830
01:48:52,983 --> 01:48:56,643
As fall turned to winter, Star Wars
finally started to take shape.

1831
01:48:56,723 --> 01:48:58,123
That's it! We did it!

1832
01:48:58,183 --> 01:48:59,553
We did it!

1833
01:49:00,593 --> 01:49:03,113
Working from
the raw production tracks...

1834
01:49:04,363 --> 01:49:08,293
sound designer Ben Burtt would add
a critical new layer to the film.

1835
01:49:09,163 --> 01:49:11,653
Burtt had spent a year
building a catalog of sounds...

1836
01:49:11,733 --> 01:49:14,293
for things that didn't exist
in our galaxy.

1837
01:49:17,573 --> 01:49:21,673
George introduced the idea of what
he called an ''organic sound track. ''

1838
01:49:21,743 --> 01:49:25,873
George thought that Chewbacca
might be made up...

1839
01:49:25,953 --> 01:49:28,883
from recordings of dogs
or maybe even bears.

1840
01:49:28,953 --> 01:49:34,013
In addition, I recorded some lions
and tigers and even some walruses.

1841
01:49:35,893 --> 01:49:38,293
I would begin
editing them together...

1842
01:49:38,363 --> 01:49:41,093
and making little phrases
out of the noises.

1843
01:49:41,163 --> 01:49:43,393
I would take the recordings
and edit the best pieces.

1844
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:48,703
You know, the bear might make
a sound that sounded angry.

1845
01:49:50,373 --> 01:49:52,063
Or they might make a sound
that was cute.

1846
01:49:56,043 --> 01:49:59,913
Or a sound like a sentence--
a ''wah, wah'' kind of a sound.

1847
01:50:02,153 --> 01:50:03,843
You said it, Chewie.

1848
01:50:03,923 --> 01:50:07,483
The voice of R2 turned out to be
the most difficult problem to solve...

1849
01:50:07,553 --> 01:50:09,493
in the sound design
of the first movie...

1850
01:50:10,493 --> 01:50:13,793
because R2 had to act
alongside of the other actors.

1851
01:50:13,863 --> 01:50:16,063
And the script only said...

1852
01:50:16,133 --> 01:50:19,193
that R2 made a sound,
or maybe R2 beeped.

1853
01:50:20,003 --> 01:50:22,763
I had a small
electronic synthesizer...

1854
01:50:22,843 --> 01:50:26,273
and I did some patches with it
and made up some electronic sounds.

1855
01:50:26,343 --> 01:50:28,273
But that didn't sound alive.

1856
01:50:28,343 --> 01:50:31,003
At one point we talked
about R2's personality...

1857
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:35,173
and we felt he was developing
kind of as a toddler.

1858
01:50:36,883 --> 01:50:38,823
So I did a lot
ofbaby recordings...

1859
01:50:38,893 --> 01:50:42,653
and eventually we found that
in the discussion of R2's voice...

1860
01:50:42,723 --> 01:50:44,663
we were making
the sounds ourselves.

1861
01:50:46,393 --> 01:50:50,693
A few experiments led to
the combination of using my voice...

1862
01:50:50,763 --> 01:50:53,133
doing baby talk--
beeps and boops--

1863
01:50:55,033 --> 01:50:57,303
with the electronic synthesizer.

1864
01:50:57,373 --> 01:51:00,703
So R2 is sort of 50% machine
and 50% organic...

1865
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:04,343
coming out of
the performance of a person.

1866
01:51:06,313 --> 01:51:11,383
The breathing for Vader was recorded
by putting a little tiny microphone...

1867
01:51:11,453 --> 01:51:14,153
down inside
a regulator on a scuba tank.

1868
01:51:16,493 --> 01:51:21,223
I breathed through the mask itself,
and it breathed in and out...

1869
01:51:21,293 --> 01:51:24,993
and out of that came the various
paces of Vader breathing.

1870
01:51:26,403 --> 01:51:29,103
And that sound worked out
pretty successfully.

1871
01:51:33,143 --> 01:51:36,633
Finding the right voice for Darth Vader
was another challenge.

1872
01:51:37,343 --> 01:51:39,073
And action!

1873
01:51:39,153 --> 01:51:43,453
Lucas never intended to use the on-set
vocal performance of David Prowse.

1874
01:51:44,753 --> 01:51:48,413
Start tearing this ship apart, piece
by piece, until you find those tapes!

1875
01:51:48,493 --> 01:51:51,653
Find the passengers in this vessel!
I want them alive!

1876
01:51:51,723 --> 01:51:54,163
I can still hear
David Prowse's accent...

1877
01:51:54,663 --> 01:51:58,263
in the Darth Vader mask, muffled,
'cause he would do the real dialogue...

1878
01:51:58,333 --> 01:52:00,603
in trying to curse
Carrie Fisher or something.

1879
01:52:00,673 --> 01:52:02,333
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1880
01:52:02,403 --> 01:52:04,773
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission--

1881
01:52:04,843 --> 01:52:09,103
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor. Take her away!

1882
01:52:09,183 --> 01:52:11,543
It was hilarious and terrifying
at the same time...

1883
01:52:11,613 --> 01:52:13,583
'cause we didn't know
what Darth sounded like.

1884
01:52:13,653 --> 01:52:16,773
That was the first time we heard him.
We were like, ''Is that it?

1885
01:52:16,853 --> 01:52:19,343
Is he gonna be some Scottish guy,
or what is this?''

1886
01:52:19,953 --> 01:52:24,323
Prowse's voice would later be replaced
with a more menacing performance...

1887
01:52:24,393 --> 01:52:29,093
provided by classically trained
stage and film actorJames Earl Jones.

1888
01:52:29,803 --> 01:52:32,923
George had hired David Prowse...

1889
01:52:33,273 --> 01:52:36,103
but he said he wanted
a so-called ''darker'' voice.

1890
01:52:36,173 --> 01:52:40,433
Not in terms of ethnic,
but in terms of timbre.

1891
01:52:41,113 --> 01:52:43,843
The rumor is that he thought
of Orson Welles...

1892
01:52:45,143 --> 01:52:49,343
and then probably thought that Orson
might be too recognizable.

1893
01:52:50,023 --> 01:52:53,983
So what he ends up is picking
a voice that was born in Mississippi...

1894
01:52:54,053 --> 01:52:56,213
raised in Michigan, and was a stutterer.

1895
01:52:57,223 --> 01:52:59,853
And that happened
to be my voice.

1896
01:52:59,933 --> 01:53:02,833
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

1897
01:53:02,903 --> 01:53:04,893
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1898
01:53:04,963 --> 01:53:08,403
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

1899
01:53:08,473 --> 01:53:11,333
You are part of
the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.

1900
01:53:11,403 --> 01:53:12,933
Take her away!

1901
01:53:13,173 --> 01:53:17,613
C-3PO's voice struck us all as
''We've got to do something about that.''

1902
01:53:17,683 --> 01:53:19,803
Thirty-four, take three.

1903
01:53:19,883 --> 01:53:22,913
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

1904
01:53:22,983 --> 01:53:25,043
It was mentioned
a number of times...

1905
01:53:25,123 --> 01:53:27,643
that C-3PO might sound
like a used car salesman.

1906
01:53:27,723 --> 01:53:29,783
Not the English butler type.

1907
01:53:29,863 --> 01:53:32,383
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I must have fallen over.

1908
01:53:32,763 --> 01:53:38,393
I just came up with this voice
of an over-the-top British butler.

1909
01:53:39,073 --> 01:53:42,003
British because that would
be my natural mode of thinking.

1910
01:53:42,073 --> 01:53:45,443
A butler because
that was his role in life.

1911
01:53:45,503 --> 01:53:48,673
Nervous because that
was his feeling in life.

1912
01:53:48,743 --> 01:53:51,943
And it came as, ''C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.''

1913
01:53:52,013 --> 01:53:54,343
This is my counterpart,
R2-D2.

1914
01:53:55,053 --> 01:53:56,613
Hello.

1915
01:53:56,683 --> 01:53:58,813
A few people
were brought in to record...

1916
01:53:58,883 --> 01:54:01,653
and an attempt was made
to see how 3PO would be...

1917
01:54:01,723 --> 01:54:03,653
with different kinds of voices.

1918
01:54:03,723 --> 01:54:07,453
I believe 30 actors coming,
and some really quite impressive names.

1919
01:54:07,533 --> 01:54:10,983
Stan Freberg and a few others
were auditioned.

1920
01:54:11,063 --> 01:54:14,503
Apparently one of them
was a major cartoon actor...

1921
01:54:14,573 --> 01:54:17,563
a man of literally a thousand voices,
who eventually said...

1922
01:54:17,643 --> 01:54:21,203
''You know something, George, Tony's
voice is pretty good for the character.

1923
01:54:21,273 --> 01:54:23,213
Why don't you
just use his voice?''

1924
01:54:23,283 --> 01:54:26,073
And eventually the discussion
just quieted down...

1925
01:54:26,153 --> 01:54:28,203
and it was an
excellent performance.

1926
01:54:28,283 --> 01:54:30,413
It synchronized
with his body motions.

1927
01:54:30,483 --> 01:54:32,713
It was a total character
which he created.

1928
01:54:32,793 --> 01:54:34,723
His track was left in the movie.

1929
01:54:35,393 --> 01:54:38,853
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

1930
01:54:38,923 --> 01:54:41,893
Your droids-- they'll have to wait
outside. We don't want them here.

1931
01:54:41,963 --> 01:54:44,123
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

1932
01:54:44,203 --> 01:54:45,863
I heartily agree with you, sir.

1933
01:54:48,773 --> 01:54:49,793
Cut.

1934
01:54:49,873 --> 01:54:51,803
428, take seven.

1935
01:54:51,873 --> 01:54:53,203
Action.

1936
01:54:53,273 --> 01:54:56,113
Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

1937
01:54:59,713 --> 01:55:01,943
At long last,
the editing, sound...

1938
01:55:02,753 --> 01:55:04,843
and visual effects
were taking shape.

1939
01:55:07,023 --> 01:55:10,893
But a private screening of the film
for Lucas's closest friends...

1940
01:55:10,963 --> 01:55:13,083
didn't do much
to bolster his confidence.

1941
01:55:14,263 --> 01:55:19,363
It was an early stage, you know,
sort of a second or third cut.

1942
01:55:19,773 --> 01:55:22,793
I had a couple of my friends
come up to see it.

1943
01:55:22,873 --> 01:55:25,203
Brian De Palma was in town.
Steven came.

1944
01:55:25,273 --> 01:55:27,363
Some other friends
came to see it.

1945
01:55:27,443 --> 01:55:29,673
The human characters
and the sets were there...

1946
01:55:29,843 --> 01:55:34,803
but, of course, all the spectacular--
you know, the Death Star fight...

1947
01:55:35,483 --> 01:55:37,383
and the battle inside the trench...

1948
01:55:37,453 --> 01:55:41,113
and all that was just...
not even there to be seen.

1949
01:55:44,193 --> 01:55:47,023
So, the reaction was not
a good one. I loved the movie.

1950
01:55:47,093 --> 01:55:49,693
I was one of the only people
in the audience that liked the movie.

1951
01:55:49,763 --> 01:55:53,633
All my friends were very honest:
''I don't get it. What are you doing?''

1952
01:55:53,703 --> 01:55:56,173
That was basically
the tenor of the whole thing.

1953
01:55:56,243 --> 01:55:58,403
On the other hand,
the studio and Laddie...

1954
01:55:58,473 --> 01:56:00,703
and his little group
saw the film.

1955
01:56:00,773 --> 01:56:04,403
They loved it. It was the first time
I've actually shown a film...

1956
01:56:04,483 --> 01:56:07,143
and one of the executives
even cried at the screening.

1957
01:56:07,213 --> 01:56:08,913
It was very emotional for him.

1958
01:56:10,123 --> 01:56:14,753
I sat my family round
the kitchen table in my house...

1959
01:56:14,823 --> 01:56:17,193
and I said, ''The most extraordinary
day of my life...

1960
01:56:17,593 --> 01:56:21,253
has just taken place,
and I want you to remember this day.

1961
01:56:22,193 --> 01:56:24,723
Because this is what I never dreamed--
or maybe I dreamed--

1962
01:56:24,803 --> 01:56:27,463
but I never thought I would have
a day's experience...

1963
01:56:27,533 --> 01:56:29,903
like the day I've had today
in seeing this film.''

1964
01:56:29,973 --> 01:56:32,873
I couldn't even believe it.

1965
01:56:32,943 --> 01:56:35,813
At that point I was used to studio
chiefs saying, ''This is terrible.

1966
01:56:35,873 --> 01:56:38,003
You shouldn't show this to
an audience. Embarrassing.''

1967
01:56:38,683 --> 01:56:43,413
So, it was very rewarding to show it to
people, even though it was in bad shape.

1968
01:56:43,483 --> 01:56:48,393
It didn't help that one critical
element in Star Wars was still missing--

1969
01:56:48,453 --> 01:56:49,393
There's no lock.

1970
01:56:51,063 --> 01:56:53,023
the musical score.

1971
01:56:53,693 --> 01:56:56,323
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

1972
01:56:56,403 --> 01:56:59,633
-Find the controls to extend the bridge.
-I think I just blasted it.

1973
01:56:59,703 --> 01:57:01,503
They're coming through!

1974
01:57:02,403 --> 01:57:06,903
I remember bugging George.
''When can we hear the score?''

1975
01:57:07,643 --> 01:57:10,133
Fortunately, Lucas was able
to recruit...

1976
01:57:10,213 --> 01:57:14,153
one of the industry's most accomplished
composers,John Williams.

1977
01:57:14,813 --> 01:57:18,443
Williams had recently won an Oscar
for Steven Spielberg's Jaws...

1978
01:57:19,123 --> 01:57:22,953
and his resume included countless film
and television scores...

1979
01:57:23,623 --> 01:57:27,293
including music for the original
Lost in Space television series.

1980
01:57:29,263 --> 01:57:32,493
I do remember George
talking about the fact...

1981
01:57:32,563 --> 01:57:35,033
that what we were going to see
in the film...

1982
01:57:35,103 --> 01:57:37,263
represents worlds
that we hadn't seen...

1983
01:57:37,943 --> 01:57:41,303
but that the music should give us
some kind of an emotional anchor.

1984
01:57:43,443 --> 01:57:46,933
We heard a romantic melody
for Princess Leia.

1985
01:57:47,013 --> 01:57:50,743
We heard bellicose music
for the battle scenes.

1986
01:57:53,723 --> 01:57:57,853
And some very heavy
declamatory thing for Darth Vader.

1987
01:58:01,233 --> 01:58:02,923
In March, 1 977...

1988
01:58:03,003 --> 01:58:05,933
John Williams led
the London Symphony Orchestra...

1989
01:58:06,003 --> 01:58:08,833
in the performance
of the Star Wars soundtrack.

1990
01:58:08,903 --> 01:58:13,080
Recorded over 1 2 days, it was
a sweeping symphonic masterpiece...

1991
01:58:13,148 --> 01:58:16,557
one of the few things to actually
exceed Lucas's expectations.
