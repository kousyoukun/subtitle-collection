1
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:13,297
To hearJohnny play the music
for the first time...

2
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,987
was a thrill beyond
anything I can describe.

3
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,157
It was my first opportunity to work
with the London Symphony Orchestra...

4
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:21,727
which was a thrill to me.

5
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:26,567
This is Red Five.
I'm going in.

6
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:28,167
Like Star Wars itself...

7
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:31,217
the music in the film
defied conventional wisdom.

8
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:34,007
At a time when disco
was burning up the charts...

9
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:36,607
having a traditional
symphonic sound track...

10
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,017
was another huge risk
on Lucas's part.

11
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:44,017
He really understood the genre
I was talking about.

12
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:48,227
It's a group of composers that weren't
that well looked upon in the '70s.

13
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:51,527
There was a different attitude toward
the old-fashioned symphonic scores.

14
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:53,367
And I had a lot
of music in the movie.

15
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:03,377
Somewhere in space, this may all
be happening right now.

16
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:06,847
Here they come.

17
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:08,987
Fox said they wanted a trailer out...

18
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:12,387
for the Christmas films
before the summer release.

19
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:13,617
They're coming in too fast!

20
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:18,047
We didn't have any
visual effects shots ready then.

21
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:21,257
So we said, ''It's going to be limiting
in what the footage can be.''

22
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:25,827
It's a big, sprawling space saga
of rebellion and romance.

23
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,067
What was cool about the trailer
was we were still working on the movie.

24
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:34,737
It's an epic ofheroes...

25
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:37,707
and villains...

26
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:42,977
and aliens from a thousand worlds.

27
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:47,547
It was more about the spirit of it.

28
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:50,117
It introduced a lot
of different characters, the robots.

29
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:54,187
One thing they did have was
a couple of the very early lightsabers.

30
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:59,137
Star Wars, a billion years
in the making...

31
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:02,657
and it's coming to your galaxy
this summer.

32
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:08,867
It was fun.

33
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:14,647
Industry insiders had been
predicting doom for Star Wars...

34
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,247
but a small army of fans
had been building...

35
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,617
thanks to the foresight
of Lucasfilm.

36
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:22,817
Charles Lippincott was brought in
as a marketing director.

37
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:26,827
He was a science fiction fan.
He had contacts with the fan base...

38
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,917
that was critical, we felt.

39
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:33,297
Science fiction fans were going
to be the big supporter of this film...

40
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:36,857
regardless of its popularity
with any other audience.

41
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:40,067
So that was the key target audience
to start with.

42
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:43,947
Aside from licensing posters
and T-shirts...

43
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:47,347
there was little support outside
of Lucasfilm's marketing efforts...

44
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,607
to promote Star Wars.

45
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:53,817
Fortunately, Charles Lippincott
was able to secure a comic book deal...

46
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:56,287
with Stan Lee and Marvel Comics.

47
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:59,857
He also convinced Del Rey
to publish a novelized version...

48
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:03,867
of George Lucas's screenplay
in November, 1 976.

49
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:08,237
By February the next year, half a
million copies had completely sold out.

50
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:12,777
Fearing Star Wars would get
crushed by other summer movies...

51
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,777
like Smokey and the Bandit...

52
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:18,007
Fox moved its release to the Wednesday
before Memorial Day...

53
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:21,537
but fewer than 40 theaters
agreed to show it.

54
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:24,987
Nobody wanted to book it.
That same summer of 1 977...

55
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:27,717
Fox released a film called
The Other Side of Midnight...

56
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:30,517
which was based on
an enormously successful best seller.

57
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:34,027
It wasn't a very good film, but it was
a very, very much-expected book.

58
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:38,497
And in order to exhibit The Other Side
of Midnight, you had to exhibit...

59
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,467
Star Wars.

60
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:43,737
We sent out a beautiful book...

61
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,897
and that didn't seem to make
an impact on 'em at all.

62
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,907
We had very few bookings.

63
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:52,807
Also it wasn't that there
had been Time or Newsweek...

64
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:55,707
or any of that stuff preceding this.

65
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:58,147
It hadn't been screened
and hadn't gotten the reviews.

66
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:01,977
On the eve of Star Wars's release...

67
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:05,657
20th Century Fox,
George Lucas and the cast and crew...

68
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,987
braced themselves for the worst.

69
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:12,427
One way or another, May 25, 1 977...

70
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:15,407
would be a day
they'd never forget.

71
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:54,137
Opening shot was one of the most
important shots for the visual effects.

72
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:56,807
Because if the audience
bought that shot, you had them.

73
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:06,107
The combined chest
of everybodyjust went--

74
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:07,987
Air was sucked out of the place.

75
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,687
When the white Stardestroyer
came overhead, I teared up.

76
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:12,697
It was so powerful.

77
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,357
I had seen that scene...

78
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:22,167
but without music,
without context...

79
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:23,827
it's not the same thing.

80
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:26,337
We're doomed.

81
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:33,507
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

82
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:37,487
There was this sort of weird
electric kind of reaction.

83
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,647
One had never seen anything like it.

84
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:46,387
Jump to light speed.

85
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:52,757
I had never experienced
special effects that were so real.

86
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,197
I was dazzled.

87
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,177
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

88
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:03,667
Some rescue!

89
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:07,117
I loved it, because I loved the story
and I loved the characters.

90
00:06:07,187 --> 00:06:09,617
Will somebody get this big
walking carpet out of my way?

91
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:11,887
For luck.

92
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,887
I thought it was revolutionary.

93
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:17,917
This is a work of genius.

94
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,697
The Force will be with you always.

95
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:32,807
We were in shock. I felt like we were
blasted in the back of our seats.

96
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:34,997
I said, ''Man, that was good.
Who worked on this?''

97
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:36,637
I'm going in.

98
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,817
Use the Force, Luke.

99
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,617
I have you now.

100
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:45,987
What?

101
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:51,827
The theater was jammed full of people...

102
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:56,627
and there was a lot of hollering
and cheering going on.

103
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:59,297
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

104
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:04,427
After it was over,
everyone was on cloud nine.

105
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:11,267
Just kind of in shock.
We had no clue what we were on.

106
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:17,047
It was wonderful.

107
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:23,227
I remember leaving the theater...

108
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:26,157
and having these kids
ask us for autographs.

109
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:29,167
''No,you don't want our autograph.
We're model-builders. ''

110
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:32,027
''No, no. We want you to sign this.''
So we were thinking...

111
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:35,267
''Wow. This must mean something if
people are asking for our autograph. ''

112
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,377
Everybody was standing up and applauding.

113
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:42,707
Never seen this before in my life.
And I'll never see it again.

114
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:52,847
We released it, I think,
in 3 7 theaters initially...

115
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,287
and broke 36 house records.

116
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:57,397
I was completely shocked.

117
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,017
It got an amazing response.

118
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:03,757
I used to drive by and look
at the lines and think, ''What?''

119
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:06,427
I mean, it was the first
sort ofblockbuster.

120
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:08,697
George Lucas's Star Wars...

121
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:13,937
lifted us out of
our sort of depression of the '7 0s...

122
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:18,207
and into an awareness
and a focus on space...

123
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:20,267
and its possible future.

124
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:22,747
This movie stood by itself.

125
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,947
Timing is everything in art.

126
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:29,887
You bring out Star Wars
too early, and it's Buck Rogers.

127
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:32,047
You bring it out too late...

128
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,057
and it doesn't fit our imagination.

129
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:37,757
You bring it out just as the war
in Vietnam is ending...

130
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:43,207
when America feels uncertain of itself,
when the old stories have died.

131
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:46,567
And you bring it out at that time,
and suddenly it's a new game.

132
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,107
Also, it's a lot of fun.

133
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,667
It's a lot of fun to watch Star Wars.

134
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:55,687
People started seeing the world in
the terms that Star Wars had laid down.

135
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:58,217
People would say,
''May the Force be with you. ''

136
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:00,357
It was a kind
of code, almost...

137
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:03,287
that proved that you were one of
the people who had seen the film...

138
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:05,797
and you were connecting with
other people who had seen the film.

139
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:09,097
Star Wars became like
a kind ofhandshake.

140
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,297
In the wake of Star Wars,
everyone's careers were changed.

141
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:19,037
Overnight, Mark Hamill,
Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford...

142
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:21,037
had become household names.

143
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,677
I felt like this.

144
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:26,007
''Great. Terrific.
Now I can go to work.''

145
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:29,447
Now I have an opportunity to take
advantage of the success of this film...

146
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,817
and go to work.

147
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:36,547
And as much as life changed for us,
it changed for George as well.

148
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:39,387
About a month after it was released,
I said, ''Okay, it's a hit.

149
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:43,797
I can now go ahead. I can make
my other movies. I'm gonna do this.''

150
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:47,967
Ironically,
the independent filmmaker...

151
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:50,597
who wanted nothing to do
with corporate Hollywood...

152
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:53,507
was now credited with reinvigorating it.

153
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:58,737
In three weeks, Fox's stock price
doubled to a record high.

154
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:02,577
A bunch of the guys at that point ran
out and bought a bunch of stock in Fox.

155
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,377
I wasn't smart enough.

156
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:10,187
The greatest profit 20th Century Fox
had ever made in a single year...

157
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:12,487
was $37 million.

158
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:15,827
And in whatever that year, '77, '7 8...

159
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:20,767
whatever that year was,
they made a profit of $7 9 million.

160
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,137
That was Star Wars.

161
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:25,807
The cultural impact of
Lucas's outer space story...

162
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:28,807
was greater than anything
even he could've imagined--

163
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:32,507
notjust in the United States
but around the globe.

164
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:35,917
It wasn't a story
of cultures or nationalities.

165
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:37,917
It wasn't a story of geography.

166
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:41,977
It was a story of mankind
escaping his environment...

167
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:45,327
to a life which everybody
expects to happen...

168
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:48,627
but George Lucas was able
to illustrate for us.

169
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:51,597
This was what made it
a success worldwide.

170
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:55,827
The movie did spectacular
business across Europe...

171
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:59,807
but when Alan Ladd,Jr. attended
the premiere in Japan one year later...

172
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:02,437
he feared that the silence
which followed the screening...

173
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:05,107
indicated that Star Wars
would be a flop.

174
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:08,147
He was relieved
when he later found out...

175
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,347
that silence was
the greatest compliment...

176
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,387
a Japanese audience
could give a film.

177
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:22,517
We had the footprint ceremony
in the Chinese Theater.

178
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,617
R2-D2, hurry up.

179
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:29,297
Thousands of people showed up,
so we were sure by then...

180
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:33,497
that there was much more to it than just
the science fiction audience.

181
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:35,507
R2-D2 goes in!

182
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:45,947
And the crowd is chanting
for Darth Vader.

183
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:52,187
Not surprisingly, Star Wars's
greatest fans were children.

184
00:11:52,257 --> 00:11:55,387
They thrilled to the fantasy
adventures of Luke Skywalker...

185
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:58,397
Han Solo and Princess Leia.

186
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,167
And they were eager to bring the
experience of the movie home with them.

187
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,607
But little Star Wars
merchandise was available...

188
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:06,837
for the first few months
after its premiere.

189
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:11,437
To help promote the movie,
Lucasfilm's Charles Lippincott...

190
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:15,247
had tried to attract potential
licensees before the film opened.

191
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,247
But prior to Star Wars...

192
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:20,417
there had been few successful
motion picture licensing campaigns...

193
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:23,787
and Lippincott's attempts
were flatly rejected.

194
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:26,227
Just one company-- Kenner Toys--

195
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:29,197
signed on shortly before
Star Wars opened.

196
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,737
Kenner didn't believe
the film would be a hit...

197
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:35,737
but they were interested in creating
a modest line of colorful space toys.

198
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:40,337
When Star Wars became a smash,
they were caught completely off guard.

199
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:44,067
Unable to produce toys
in time for Christmas orders...

200
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:48,077
Kenner resorted to selling boxed
vouchers for Star Wars action figures.

201
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,677
There wasn't anything available
when the film came out.

202
00:12:51,757 --> 00:12:55,987
There wasn't even anything available
for the following Christmas of'77.

203
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:59,387
That was the infamous
empty-box campaign...

204
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:02,397
where the idea proposed
by Kenner was that...

205
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:05,327
there'd be these wonderful boxes with
the Star Wars illustrations on them...

206
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:07,867
and the kid would get this
for Christmas and open it up...

207
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:11,067
and there'd be a certificate in there
saying, ''You can get this toy in March. ''

208
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:13,867
The Star Wars early-bird
certificate package--

209
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:15,167
new from Kenner.

210
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,787
I lit up when I found out...

211
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:27,757
that they were gonna make
my face a mask on a box of cereal...

212
00:13:27,827 --> 00:13:30,157
with little dots
where to cut my eyes out.

213
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,787
The idea of me being
on bubble-gum cards--

214
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:37,597
I thought you had to have athletic
ability to be a bubble-gum card.

215
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:42,157
So I enjoyed the merchandising
aspect of it.

216
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,607
We signed away our likeness...

217
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:46,797
so when I look in the mirror...

218
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:49,107
I have to pay George
a couple of bucks.

219
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:54,847
You're not really famous
until you're a Pez dispenser.

220
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,377
But you realize,
''I'm not really famous.

221
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:01,387
Princess Leia is.
And I look like her. ''

222
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:04,477
And owe George a couple of bucks.

223
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:08,727
For Lucas, protecting the quality
and integrity ofhis vision...

224
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:10,497
became as important as gaining...

225
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,467
his financial independence
from Hollywood studios.

226
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:16,507
Merchandising offered
a means to an end...

227
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,907
one that helped fuel support
for more Star Wars films...

228
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,637
as well as other
important projects.

229
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:24,907
In the world of merchandising--
oh, goodness gracious...

230
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:27,137
people came to us with ideas...

231
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:31,247
all the time, every day,
day and night...

232
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:33,947
from all over the world
for Star Wars merchandise.

233
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:37,017
We were the ones
in those days to say...

234
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:39,827
''No. Sorry. That doesn't
fit into our plan.''

235
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,287
At the 1 978 Academy Awards...

236
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,887
Star Wars earned an impressive
1 0 Oscar nominations...

237
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:50,767
and took home seven, including
statues for best visual effects...

238
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:51,637
sound...

239
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:52,697
editing...

240
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:54,937
and production design.

241
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:57,077
It was terrific.
I don't know.

242
00:14:57,747 --> 00:15:00,307
It was like a dream come true.
It's the American dream.

243
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:02,637
I wound up winning
the Academy Award for Star Wars...

244
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:05,377
before I'd even started thinking
about winning Academy Awards.

245
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,117
My goal was to get anotherjob.

246
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,647
While it didn't win
for best picture...

247
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:12,917
its nomination was quite an achievement
for George Lucas...

248
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,967
and his kids'movie.

249
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:23,397
In addition to industry acclaim...

250
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:27,137
Star Wars earned more money
than any movie in history.

251
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:29,407
After years of fighting
uphill battles...

252
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:33,177
Lucas could finally call his own shots
with the studios.

253
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:36,477
When Fox approached him about
doing the inevitable sequel...

254
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:39,987
it was the moment the filmmaker
had long been waiting for.

255
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:46,227
This was the perfect chance to become
independent of the Hollywood system.

256
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:48,287
I didn't mind
releasing it through them.

257
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,987
It was going to them for the money,
and them saying...

258
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:55,097
''We want a script change,'' or, ''The film
is good, but we want these changes.''

259
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,867
That's what I wanted to avoid.

260
00:15:57,937 --> 00:16:00,467
I decided I was gonna
finance the film myself...

261
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,977
that I was gonna make it
completely independently.

262
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:09,007
The rule in Hollywood is never put your
own money in a film, even your own film.

263
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:13,147
But George was self-financing
The Empire Strikes Back.

264
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,657
He was doing it through the bank,
and we were talking about...

265
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:17,687
close to a $30-million film
at the time.

266
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,987
But, because of the huge success
of the first picture...

267
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,557
and of the revenues
that were still rolling in--

268
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:26,827
merchandising was very strong--

269
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:30,337
it was a gamble, but a gamble
that he knew would pay off.

270
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:33,367
With his earnings from Star Wars...

271
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:36,537
Lucas was able to secure a bank loan for
The Empire Strikes Back.

272
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:40,737
Empire's original budget
was $25 million...

273
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:43,147
more than twice that
of the first film.

274
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:55,727
We would meet at Medway, which
was George's San Francisco offiice...

275
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,457
and look at
the illustrations...

276
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:01,657
while George was
writing the script.

277
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:05,567
And Gary Kurtz would
fly in occasionally from London...

278
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:10,507
and Ralph McQuarrie would send down
drawings, conceptual designs...

279
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:12,517
as well as JoeJohnston.

280
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:20,147
The Empire Strikes Back would reunite
much of the Star Wars cast.

281
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,947
It would also move the story
in new directions...

282
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:25,657
digging more deeply
into the emotions of the characters.

283
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:30,387
George had been given enormous
license by the success of Star Wars.

284
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,767
So when he started talking to me...

285
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:35,137
about the Empire script
that didn't exist...

286
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:38,437
he knew what had to happen in
the story, and it was very dark stuff.

287
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:43,937
I was delighted that it was not
gonna be a rehash of Star Wars.

288
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:46,477
But in fact, after having
set the whole thing up...

289
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:49,377
and gotten a rousing start...

290
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:53,287
you launch into the second act
in which everything goes to hell.

291
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:56,657
And that's usually
the best act in a play.

292
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:00,597
Empire would also
open the door...

293
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,827
to a romance between
Han Solo and Princess Leia.

294
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:07,697
But this time, George Lucas wasn't
getting in the director's chair.

295
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:10,637
It was just too hard
to set up a company...

296
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:15,177
get the money,
get the film made...

297
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:18,507
and also be down there on the set
every day trying to direct it.

298
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:21,547
So I decided I'd hire a director.

299
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:25,817
I was asked by George to come
to lunch at Universal.

300
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:30,087
And he said, ''How would you like
to do the second Star Wars?''

301
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:33,087
We had no title
for it at that point.

302
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:38,527
And I said, ''Gee, George,
I don't think so.''

303
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:41,567
It's a phenomenal hit as a picture.

304
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:46,267
A second one can
only be a second one.

305
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:48,807
It can't be as good...

306
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,207
because the first one
is the breakthrough.

307
00:18:52,277 --> 00:18:55,577
And I told my agent
about the meeting...

308
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:58,377
and he said,
''Are you crazy? Do it.!''

309
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:05,047
There were approximately
64 sets on this picture...

310
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,457
which is much bigger
than Star Wars.

311
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:12,357
George says,
''The film has to be much better...

312
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:16,567
and much bigger and much
more complex than Star Wars.

313
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:20,797
Because if the second one
doesn't work...

314
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:23,307
it's the end of Star Wars.

315
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,407
If it does work...

316
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:28,477
then I can continue
making more of them. ''

317
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:31,647
I said, ''It doesn't put me
in a very comfortable position.

318
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:33,687
It's a hell of a responsibility. ''

319
00:19:39,657 --> 00:19:42,127
Known for smaller,
character-driven films...

320
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:45,857
like Up the Sandbox
and Eyes of Laura Mars...

321
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:49,197
Irvin Kershner had never
directed a blockbuster.

322
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:53,677
But emphasis on character was just
what this middle chapter needed.

323
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:57,077
The story line was
much more diffiicult.

324
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,747
I felt I needed
humor in the picture.

325
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:04,117
And yet, I couldn't have gags.

326
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:08,247
I felt I needed a love story...

327
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:11,777
and yet I couldn't have
a lot of smooching...

328
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:14,087
and kissing and all that stuff.

329
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:17,067
And it had to all be more implied.

330
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:21,867
I knew I needed something
powerful going on...

331
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:24,237
inside Luke's soul.

332
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:28,807
And he really carries
the picture, of course.

333
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:31,907
So I didn't know quite
how I was gonna do this.

334
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:38,407
In the year since the release
of the first Star Wars...

335
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,677
now dubbed
Episode IV: A New Hope...

336
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:43,347
ILM had come a long way.

337
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,787
The company was no longer
a fledgling operation...

338
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:47,757
struggling to get by.

339
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:49,417
At the end of Star Wars...

340
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:53,597
George invited the core group
to Northern California...

341
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,607
to start this whole new facility.

342
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:59,767
There were 1 0 of us, and I was
the only one that immediately came up.

343
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:05,277
I said, ''Are you kidding? Stay here in
Van Nuys in this crummy part of town...

344
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,507
in this dumpy building...

345
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,407
that was inadequate
from the very beginning...

346
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,407
or move to Marin County...

347
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:16,547
have a new building
and have a new film to work on...

348
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:18,617
in this great environment?''

349
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:20,627
It was like a no-brainer.

350
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:25,527
I remember George saying, ''This time
we got some money.'' That was nice.

351
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:28,297
We talked about,
''Should we top ourselves?''

352
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,067
or ''Are we gonna top ourselves?''

353
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:34,937
I think it was more of, ''Let's just make
it look cool. Have some fun with it. ''

354
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:38,407
And George came up with
some great story stuff.

355
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:41,147
We started on the walker...

356
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:44,007
but we also had to build the probot...

357
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:46,607
which is the probe that
is sent down by Darth Vader...

358
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:48,947
that lands on
the snow planet's surface...

359
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:51,017
that then goes and looks
for human life-forms.

360
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:55,687
Joe had already drawn the drawings.
George liked that.

361
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:59,097
But they were going to go
to Norway to shoot all those scenes...

362
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:01,537
and they needed a prop.

363
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:04,897
They needed one that was, like,
nine feet tall or something like that...

364
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:07,807
in scale to have
out in the distance.

365
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:21,147
The making of Empire
was a whole set of problems...

366
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:23,217
that we didn't anticipate.

367
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:28,127
The picture was a much bigger
undertaking than originally conceived.

368
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:32,137
The budget was
quite a bit more.

369
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,327
Everybody who's dealt with
visual effects said...

370
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:37,067
''Never do snow,
because you can't maintain the color. ''

371
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:41,197
We ignored all those warnings
and decided to shoot in the snow anyway.

372
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,107
But it was a very
time-consuming process.

373
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:46,547
And again,
just like in Tunisia...

374
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:49,047
we were in Norway
shooting on this glacier...

375
00:22:50,517 --> 00:22:53,747
and we had the worst
winter in Scandinavia...

376
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:56,317
that they'd had in 50 years--

377
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:58,877
20 below zero,
1 8 feet of snow.

378
00:23:00,627 --> 00:23:02,897
It was a miserable location...

379
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:05,527
'cause we were across this frozen thing
up on this glacier...

380
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:07,627
with these tracked vehicles
to get there.

381
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:11,467
We had sort oflike stakes,
big twigs almost, in the ground...

382
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:14,097
about every six feet.

383
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:16,477
Because if it started snowing,
you get a whiteout.

384
00:23:16,547 --> 00:23:18,907
You can't tell where you're going.
And it did one night.

385
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:23,037
I drove one of the tracked vehicles.
Without it, I never would've got back.

386
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:25,687
We get to Norway...

387
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:31,257
and I couldn't get out
of the hotel to shoot...

388
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,757
because there was a wall of snow...

389
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:36,097
that was blown in that night.

390
00:23:37,397 --> 00:23:41,167
So we put the camera
in the doorway of the hotel...

391
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:43,167
going out the back door.

392
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:45,367
The crew was all inside,
toasty warm...

393
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:49,397
and Mark had to go out
into the snow...

394
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:52,277
and go running away
from the ice creature.

395
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,777
And we never left the doorway.

396
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,717
And he froze to death, and we were fine.

397
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:02,087
We finally shot all the scenes...

398
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:05,227
knowing where the special effects--

399
00:24:05,297 --> 00:24:07,227
where this thing
would come down...

400
00:24:07,297 --> 00:24:10,267
the foot would come down,
and all this stuff.

401
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:15,257
It was really tricky stuff--

402
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:19,067
animating these things
on these snowy sets.

403
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:24,267
So initially, I think,
the intent was to try and set up...

404
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:31,037
scenes that would be bluescreen comped
into background plates shot on location.

405
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:37,087
But this kid showed up at ILM
who was this amazing painter...

406
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:42,187
and so most of the work of the snow
walkers and the tauntauns were done...

407
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:47,067
against these painted backdrops
that Mike made.

408
00:24:47,497 --> 00:24:50,027
I like the snow walkers.
I think that's a great idea.

409
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:53,627
And I think that
the compositing got a lot better...

410
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:56,397
but it was better than it was
in Star Wars.

411
00:24:57,107 --> 00:24:59,107
So it's a little bit
more believable.

412
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:04,747
The cast and crew
ofThe Empire Strikes Back...

413
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:07,717
were determined to make the second
installment of Star Wars...

414
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:10,447
worth three years of waiting by fans.

415
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:16,657
Echo Station 57,
we're on our way.

416
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:24,057
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

417
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:26,337
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

418
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:27,897
Steady, Dak.

419
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:29,877
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

420
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:35,247
As with the first film...

421
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,947
principal photography
for The Empire Strikes Back...

422
00:25:38,017 --> 00:25:40,677
was done at Elstree Studios
in London.

423
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:42,887
Here, members
of the original cast...

424
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:45,717
would be introduced to
a new principal character--

425
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:49,287
Lando Calrissian,
played by Billy Dee Williams.

426
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:53,387
Why, you slimy double-crossing
no-good swindler.

427
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:56,467
You've got a lot of guts coming here...

428
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,267
after what you pulled.

429
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:12,247
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

430
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:15,417
Well, he seems very friendly.

431
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:18,547
Yes. Very friendly.

432
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,487
It's always interesting
to create a character...

433
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:25,487
that is a sort of dual character.

434
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,497
You're not quite sure about him.

435
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:29,897
Especially if he's cute.
And I was really kind of cute.

436
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,367
Hello. What have we here?

437
00:26:33,137 --> 00:26:34,837
Welcome, I'm Lando Calrissian.

438
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:37,107
I'm the administrator of this facility.

439
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:38,607
And who might you be?

440
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:39,937
Leia.

441
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:42,107
Welcome, Leia.

442
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,717
All right, all right.

443
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:48,417
You old smoothie.

444
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:54,947
The Empire Strikes Back also introduced
a new villain to the saga--

445
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:58,797
the calculating, cold-blooded
bounty hunter Boba Fett.

446
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:02,027
What's going on, buddy?

447
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:05,067
You're being put
into carbon freeze.

448
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:08,907
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

449
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:12,207
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

450
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:17,817
We looked at the scene where Han Solo
goes into the freezing chamber.

451
00:27:18,757 --> 00:27:20,347
George had scripted...

452
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:26,087
an exchange between Princess Leia
and Han Solo which went like this:

453
00:27:26,157 --> 00:27:31,117
She said, ''I love you,''
and Han Solo said, ''I love you too.''

454
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:35,467
And it kind of seemed to me
that we weren't taking advantage...

455
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:38,467
of the character that
we'd established for Han Solo.

456
00:27:39,837 --> 00:27:43,037
We tried take after take after take.

457
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:47,807
Nothing satisfied me. And finally...

458
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:49,877
I said, ''Harrison.

459
00:27:50,787 --> 00:27:54,117
Don't think about it. Don't think
about it. Let's shoot it. Okay, action!''

460
00:27:54,187 --> 00:27:55,177
I love you.

461
00:27:55,957 --> 00:27:56,947
I know.

462
00:27:58,097 --> 00:28:00,617
And he dropped in,
and I said, ''Cut. ''

463
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:04,357
I said, ''Yeah, that's a great line.
That's Han Solo.''

464
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:12,767
Ironically, the most talked-about
new character wasn't a human at all...

465
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:15,507
but a two-foot-tall puppet
called Yoda.

466
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:18,007
Designed by Stuart Freeborn...

467
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:20,517
and operated by
Muppeteer Frank Oz...

468
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:23,817
the tiny creature was
a fully realized character...

469
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:26,117
and a unique achievement
in movie puppetry.

470
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:29,847
George showed me
a few original sketches...

471
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:33,187
and I thought,
''Well, that's interesting...

472
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:36,227
but I want something
in more depth, ''you see?

473
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:40,157
So I looked in the mirror,
and I thought, ''Well...

474
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:48,697
something perhaps a little bit
amusing about my face.''

475
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:51,267
So I modeled something of myself.

476
00:28:51,347 --> 00:28:53,507
Now I've got to make him
look intelligent.

477
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:59,077
I got this photograph of Einstein and
put the Einstein wrinkles in all around.

478
00:28:59,757 --> 00:29:01,687
I did a lot of thinking about it...

479
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:05,187
because he's got to be full of
subtle action and movements...

480
00:29:05,257 --> 00:29:07,987
especially in the face and the body.

481
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:11,497
And I put it all in, what was necessary,
and finally it all worked.

482
00:29:12,037 --> 00:29:17,057
I remember Stuart was under the gun.
And it was very tense. Very tense.

483
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:20,077
We had to get this thing done.
We've got to start shooting with Yoda.

484
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:21,507
So...

485
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,577
while we were talking to him,
I just had Yoda's head...

486
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:27,117
and I was just playing with it
and I dropped it and it cracked.

487
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:30,907
So here we are--

488
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:33,677
Then Stuart said,
''I need a drink.''

489
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:36,247
So it was terrible, because here
we're pressing so much...

490
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:38,257
and I'm the one who screwed it up.

491
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:42,367
In order to shoot
the puppet moving...

492
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:47,157
the set had to be built
about five feet...

493
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:49,927
above the floor of the stage.

494
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:54,467
And we would put holes or ridges...

495
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:57,307
where it would stand
on top of it...

496
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,607
and he could move it along
in a certain direction.

497
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:03,647
So it had to be predetermined.

498
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:07,417
On top of the stage were trees...

499
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:10,047
rocks, caves, everything.

500
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:12,757
Now, they couldn't hear above...

501
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:16,197
and Mark couldn't hear Frank Oz.

502
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,667
How do you do a scene?
You can't hear each other.

503
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:21,897
I give Mark a lot of credit for this.

504
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:23,907
I can remember...

505
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:26,437
this little voice called over to me--
''Norman, ''he said.

506
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:29,037
And I actually blushed...

507
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:32,547
because it seemed so real, this weird,
weird little thing.

508
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:35,867
It was tremendously
diffiicult physical work.

509
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:38,747
The whole floor was about
three-and-a-half,four feet high...

510
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:40,517
so I could be underneath the floor...

511
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:45,027
and then I would hold my hand up
through a hole.

512
00:30:45,097 --> 00:30:47,287
And I remember Kersh
was talking to me--

513
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:49,697
But he sometimes talked to Yoda.
I'm saying...

514
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:52,287
''Kersh, I can't hear you.
I'm down here under the floor.''

515
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:54,767
Look a bit more
towards the lens.

516
00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:57,237
The other way.

517
00:30:57,867 --> 00:31:02,107
But the pressure was extreme
because I was taking too much time.

518
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:05,837
I was taking too much time because this
was the first time this had been done.

519
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:09,747
You know, I had somebody
doing the cables for the ears.

520
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:13,477
Somebody else was doing the eyes.
Somebody was doing it on the left hand.

521
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:16,247
I had me and three other people trying
to bring one character to life.

522
00:31:16,827 --> 00:31:19,557
Center those eyes a bit.
Yeah,just one second.

523
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,687
- The eyes. This way.
- There.

524
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,827
That's a bit too far.
There. That's it.

525
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:29,297
That's good, Graham. Okay.
We'll go back into that. Ready.

526
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:31,967
All right. Action.

527
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:35,737
- I followed my feelings.
- You are reckless.

528
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,937
So was I, if you remember.

529
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,307
He is too old.

530
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:45,417
Yes, too old to
begin the training.

531
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,147
I'm not afraid.

532
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:52,117
You will be.

533
00:31:52,197 --> 00:31:53,917
You will be.

534
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,457
Sorry.

535
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:56,557
Problems.

536
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,657
That was like a real leap...

537
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:00,667
because if that puppet
had not worked...

538
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:03,797
the whole film would
have been down the tubes.

539
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:07,307
It would have been a disaster
if it had been a silly little Muppet.

540
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:10,237
If it had been Kermit
running around in that movie...

541
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:13,007
the whole movie would've
collapsed under the weight of it.

542
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:15,277
340E, take two, A and B cameras.

543
00:32:16,347 --> 00:32:19,617
While many individuals
helped bring Yoda to life...

544
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,157
it was Mark Hamill's
believable performance...

545
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:24,817
that made audiences
accept the character.

546
00:32:24,897 --> 00:32:26,327
Is the dark side stronger?

547
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,187
No, no.

548
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:32,067
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

549
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,367
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?

550
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:37,627
You will know...

551
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,007
when you are calm,
at peace.

552
00:32:40,077 --> 00:32:42,697
For Hamill, playing
a Jedi-in-training...

553
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:44,837
was more than just
a physical challenge...

554
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:47,317
it was also an emotional one.

555
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:51,007
I was the only human being
on the call sheet for months.

556
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:55,247
It would say,
''Actor: Mark Hamill. Part: Luke.

557
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:59,847
Props:
Snakes, lizards, robots...

558
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:02,327
smoke machines,
Gila monsters. ''

559
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,327
This is it.

560
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:07,797
If you choose the quick
and easy path as Vader did...

561
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:12,567
you will become an agent of evil
and the galaxy will be plunged deeper...

562
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:15,537
- into the abyss of hate and despair.
- He bit me.

563
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:16,737
You're in the light.

564
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:18,467
- Bit you?
- Yeah!

565
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:22,417
Didn't he bite me?
It was a little love nip.

566
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:25,177
Frank Oz and his crew
were there...

567
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:28,517
but they'd get buried down
underneath the ground.

568
00:33:28,587 --> 00:33:30,817
I had an earpiece
where I could hear...

569
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:33,327
''Many years have you--''

570
00:33:33,397 --> 00:33:36,917
Then if you turned your head
the wrong way, you'd pick up Radio 1 ...

571
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:39,627
and it was the Rolling Stones
singing ''Fool to Cry.''

572
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:44,267
I remember I reacted to that and went,
''Hey, I got the Stones!''

573
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:47,467
And Kershner goes, ''Cut.!''

574
00:33:47,537 --> 00:33:50,877
He's way across the bog, saying...

575
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:54,637
''If that happens again,
just pretend like you don't hear it. ''

576
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:57,677
Because with all the elements
of that set--

577
00:33:57,747 --> 00:34:00,717
''Is the smoke good?
Is the snake?''

578
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:03,617
''Poke the snake. Get the snake
to move. He's just lying there. ''

579
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:07,627
So you felt,
''Let's get our priorities straight.''

580
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:11,427
'Cause I'm concerned about how
did I come off in the scene.

581
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:14,397
They were looking at
everything but me.

582
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:28,107
I have to say you wouldn't
wanna fall in that pool.

583
00:34:28,177 --> 00:34:33,017
By the time you finished shooting, it's
full of all sorts of wildlife and bugs.

584
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:35,177
It was absolutely foul...

585
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:37,617
after all those weeks
of being in there-- stagnant water.

586
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:41,517
I don't believe it.

587
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:46,017
That is why you fail.

588
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:59,237
As elaborately detailed as the sets
were at Elstree Studios...

589
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:02,507
equally impressive was
the work done in California.

590
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:05,447
ILM was able to produce
special effects...

591
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:09,007
that were light-years ahead
of those seen in the first Star Wars.

592
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,157
If you look at Star Wars,
you're either kind of in space--

593
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:14,657
maybe the Death Star's back there,
maybe it isn't...

594
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:17,827
and you have a number of shots
on different planets.

595
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,757
But you look at Empire,
and it's broad.

596
00:35:20,837 --> 00:35:25,397
You've got a speeder sequence
and two or three big dogfights.

597
00:35:25,477 --> 00:35:29,737
You've got the whole Cloud City and all
the interiors of different landscapes...

598
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:31,747
that are way beyond
what we'd done before.

599
00:35:31,817 --> 00:35:34,007
I think it was the breadth
of the work...

600
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:36,047
that differentiates that
from the first show.

601
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:41,487
And each one of those sequences required
different problem-solving skills.

602
00:35:57,707 --> 00:36:00,797
We did this incredible chase
through the asteroid field.

603
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:03,967
Designing asteroids is not
as easy as you think...

604
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,907
and I remember many of us
in the model shop...

605
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:10,777
tried and tried to come up with
something that would look good.

606
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:16,587
And I think for some of the very
far ones, we had used potatoes.

607
00:36:33,637 --> 00:36:36,837
The biggest problem was it wasn't going
fast enough. I was running out of money.

608
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,877
Irvin Kershner's
an extremely good director...

609
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,107
but the film went over budget,
went over schedule...

610
00:36:42,187 --> 00:36:46,847
and all the money I had in Star Wars
was committed to this film, plus more.

611
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:50,077
We shot several scenes
in Empire over again.

612
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,487
There's a scene in Cloud City...

613
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:55,047
where Han Solo character
is kind of pacing up and down...

614
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:58,897
and Princess Leia comes in,
and he reacts to the way she looks...

615
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,027
'cause she's dressed differently than
she has in the entire rest of the film.

616
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:05,537
You look beautiful.

617
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:07,967
You should wear
girls' clothes all the time.

618
00:37:08,037 --> 00:37:10,667
We looked at the dailies
and weren't happy with anything.

619
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:13,977
The attitude of the actors
was too obvious.

620
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:15,537
Sit down.

621
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:18,377
Come on. Talk to me.

622
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:22,407
And we could have let that go,
but itjust didn't feel right.

623
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:24,687
- Retake.
- Action.

624
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:27,247
I hope Luke made it
to the fleet all right.

625
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:30,267
I'm sure he's fine.

626
00:37:30,327 --> 00:37:32,957
He's probably sittin' around wondering
what we're up to right now.

627
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:36,997
You know, your friend Lando
is very charming, but I don't trust him.

628
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:40,567
Trust him. He's an old friend of mine.

629
00:37:48,717 --> 00:37:49,577
End slate.

630
00:37:49,987 --> 00:37:52,047
So we'd shot it
in a slightly more subtle fashion...

631
00:37:52,117 --> 00:37:54,107
which is the way
it's in the film now.

632
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:56,677
I don't trust Lando.

633
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:58,387
Well, I don't trust him either.

634
00:37:58,457 --> 00:38:00,357
But he is my friend.

635
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:02,757
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

636
00:38:04,397 --> 00:38:06,387
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

637
00:38:11,137 --> 00:38:14,237
Although most production
challenges had been anticipated...

638
00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:16,937
and expectations were
understandably high...

639
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:19,847
when Empire went
over budget by $ 1 0 million...

640
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:23,407
Lucasfilm suddenly found itself
in a fiscal crisis.

641
00:38:24,347 --> 00:38:26,717
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

642
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:31,027
But you are not a Jedi yet.

643
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:33,757
Three of the top executives of
Bank of America Entertainment...

644
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:36,797
walked into my offiice saying,
''We have to pull your loan. ''

645
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:40,317
And I said, ''How can the largest bank
in the entertainment business...

646
00:38:40,397 --> 00:38:43,667
with the sequel to
the most successful movie ever out...

647
00:38:43,737 --> 00:38:45,367
be wanting to pull my loan?''

648
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:48,837
He said, ''Well, we have a new
credit manager, and he just has a rule:

649
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:50,467
Budget doubles, he pulls the loan. ''

650
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:53,177
One of the bankers quit over it.
They knew it was a big mistake.

651
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:57,737
But I was stuck with trying to
make a million-dollar payroll by Friday.

652
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:00,187
Release your anger.

653
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:03,617
Only your hatred can destroy me.

654
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:09,257
That was the big difference
between the studio system...

655
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:11,957
and the independent view
of filmmaking.

656
00:39:12,037 --> 00:39:16,227
The studios have a large resource
to draw on for what they do...

657
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:18,667
and independents don't...

658
00:39:18,737 --> 00:39:21,767
so it's a much tighter situation.

659
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:34,677
I was just hoping the bank
would allow me to finish...

660
00:39:34,757 --> 00:39:38,417
without going back to 20th Century Fox
and giving away all my rights...

661
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:41,387
because that's ultimately
what my other choice was...

662
00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:44,827
was to just simply let them
own it and lose my independence.

663
00:39:44,897 --> 00:39:47,097
But I wanted my independence
so badly...

664
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:50,607
we managed to do it in a way that I paid
them just a little bit more money...

665
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,607
but they didn't get the licensing,
and they didn't get the sequels.

666
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:55,607
That was what I was
trying to hold on to.

667
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:57,807
If I had to pay extra points
in order to...

668
00:39:57,877 --> 00:40:01,077
get them to guarantee a loan
with the bank, I could do that.

669
00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:04,707
I think Fox was just as concerned
that the movie get finished as we were.

670
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:07,917
While Empire's budget
may have been tight...

671
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:11,217
security during the production
was even tighter.

672
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:16,597
Only Lucas, Kershner and the film's
producers knew the real story.

673
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:22,197
At the time, I knew that Mark had
a father, and that it was Darth Vader...

674
00:40:22,537 --> 00:40:24,507
but this was not in the script.

675
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:27,537
There was a false page inserted.

676
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:29,977
I had the knowledge.

677
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:32,037
The actors didn't even have it.

678
00:40:32,117 --> 00:40:34,807
No one had it.
It was a total secret.

679
00:40:34,877 --> 00:40:37,677
The script was under lock and key,
the models were under lock and key...

680
00:40:37,987 --> 00:40:43,047
I LM was under lock and key and
shrouded from the rest of the world.

681
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:45,887
The story line of the movie
was under lock and key.

682
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,617
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

683
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:52,987
The film's shocking climax...

684
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:56,727
in which Darth Vader reveals
Luke Skywalker's true parentage...

685
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:58,737
was kept a secret
from nearly everyone...

686
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:01,467
even David Prowse and Mark Hamill.

687
00:41:01,537 --> 00:41:05,637
Hamill was told privately,
just moments before the cameras rolled.

688
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:08,047
I met with Mark and said...

689
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:10,547
''You know that
Darth Vader's your father.''

690
00:41:12,357 --> 00:41:16,187
They had taken me aside and said,
''This is what he's really going to say.''

691
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:17,917
''And we're gonna do the scene.

692
00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:24,327
And Darth Vader will be saying
stuff that doesn't count. Forget it.

693
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:27,927
Use your own rhythm
compared to what he's doing. ''

694
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:38,677
There is no escape.

695
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:41,637
Don't make me destroy you.

696
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:45,307
We did a few takes,
and he finally got into it.

697
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:46,977
Join me...

698
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:49,287
and I will complete your training.

699
00:41:49,357 --> 00:41:53,157
And here is Darth Vader, who had
his dialogue, by the way...

700
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:55,157
and he's speaking the dialogue.

701
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:58,267
He thinks it's being recorded,
you see.

702
00:41:58,327 --> 00:42:02,027
It's not being recorded. What's being
recorded is this, this, this.

703
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:05,867
He said, ''You don't know the truth.
Obi-Wan killed your father.''

704
00:42:05,937 --> 00:42:08,707
And then, of course,
we rerecorded everything.

705
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,837
I'll never join you!

706
00:42:11,577 --> 00:42:15,447
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

707
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:18,817
When I first saw the dialogue
that said...

708
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:21,217
''Luke, I am your father''...

709
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:24,887
I said to myself, ''He's lying.

710
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:27,647
I wonder how they're gonna
play that lie out.''

711
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:32,827
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

712
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:34,227
He told me enough.

713
00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:38,707
He told me you killed him.

714
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:42,497
I am your father.

715
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:45,547
And I scream, ''No!''
just as it was meant to be.

716
00:42:50,847 --> 00:42:52,177
Join me...

717
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:56,917
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

718
00:43:07,437 --> 00:43:09,907
I think that it went beyond
Star Wars.

719
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:14,097
You got to know the characters
a little better,you had some humor.

720
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:16,037
Laugh it up, fuzzball.

721
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:21,347
I thought of the film as the second
movement of a symphony.

722
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:23,407
That's why I wanted
some of the things slower.

723
00:43:24,047 --> 00:43:26,747
And it ends...

724
00:43:27,157 --> 00:43:30,217
in a way
that you can't wait to see...

725
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:34,697
to hear the vivace,
the next movie, the allegretto.

726
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:39,527
I didn't have a climax at the end.
I had an emotional climax.

727
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:42,467
As Empire's premiere date
approached...

728
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,697
the producers once again
held their collective breath.

729
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:02,017
When The Empire Strikes Back
finally opened on May 2 1, 1 980...

730
00:44:02,087 --> 00:44:05,457
it didn't meet expectations,
it surpassed them.

731
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:10,467
Within three months, George Lucas had
recovered his $33 million investment.

732
00:44:10,527 --> 00:44:14,627
There was something about Empire that
immediatelyjust clicked when I saw it.

733
00:44:14,697 --> 00:44:18,067
I didn't know how all the romance
was gonna work and the adventure...

734
00:44:18,137 --> 00:44:20,367
and was it too serious,
and all this sort of stuff.

735
00:44:20,907 --> 00:44:22,637
But it really came together.

736
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:27,547
Until its premiere, cases oflightning
striking twice were rare in Hollywood.

737
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:30,017
Sequels were almost always a letdown.

738
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,717
But in the Star Wars universe,
different laws applied.

739
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:37,747
And George Lucas, the world's most
successful independent filmmaker...

740
00:44:37,827 --> 00:44:40,627
was fast becoming a law
unto himself.

741
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:43,187
In a radical move
by Hollywood standards...

742
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:46,597
he shared Empire's profits with
every one ofhis employees...

743
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:50,327
handing out over five million dollars
in bonuses in 1 980.

744
00:44:50,937 --> 00:44:53,427
The profits from
the two Star Wars films...

745
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:58,207
also helped fuel Lucas's
rapidly expanding business enterprises.

746
00:44:58,477 --> 00:45:01,037
We did have some money,
but it was still a start-up company.

747
00:45:01,117 --> 00:45:03,877
We could have messed it up
as much as we did it right.

748
00:45:04,347 --> 00:45:06,377
But his ability to make
successful movies...

749
00:45:06,457 --> 00:45:09,417
is what drove the financial success
of the company.

750
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:11,957
But how we used those funds
to grow the company...

751
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:14,017
and why he has a net worth
the way he does...

752
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:17,547
he was smart enough to understand
all the rights, all the ancillaries.

753
00:45:19,237 --> 00:45:22,687
By financing The Empire Strikes Back
with his own money...

754
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:25,937
George Lucas
had bet the farm and won.

755
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:30,977
In fact, he was in a position
to build his own kind of farm--

756
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:34,347
Skywalker Ranch,
in Marin County, California.

757
00:45:38,517 --> 00:45:42,177
Lucas had long imagined
a visually inspiring setting...

758
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:45,627
where his employees could work
in a creative atmosphere...

759
00:45:45,697 --> 00:45:47,927
and where friends
like Steven Spielberg...

760
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:50,427
Robert Redford
and Francis Ford Coppola...

761
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,827
could enjoy working at
a state-of-the-art facility.

762
00:45:53,897 --> 00:45:57,627
George was debating on two
different parcels ofland.

763
00:45:57,707 --> 00:46:02,467
One was on Lucas Valley Road.

764
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:05,107
And I said, ''Well, that's
the one you have to pick.''

765
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:14,917
The company structure supported
multimovies in all areas...

766
00:46:14,987 --> 00:46:17,477
merchandising,
special effects, ancillaries.

767
00:46:17,657 --> 00:46:21,597
All the little companies
had to be started and operated...

768
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:23,657
and have all these systems
put in place.

769
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:26,257
LucasArts...

770
00:46:26,337 --> 00:46:27,627
THX...

771
00:46:28,297 --> 00:46:30,357
Skywalker Sound...

772
00:46:30,437 --> 00:46:32,027
Industrial Light & Magic.

773
00:46:32,107 --> 00:46:37,097
Each subsidiary of Lucasfilm would
serve George Lucas's creative vision.

774
00:46:37,177 --> 00:46:40,237
In turn, they revolutionized
a film industry...

775
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:43,617
that had for too long
been plagued by complacency.

776
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:48,647
It was an idea of one person
and successfully implemented.

777
00:46:48,717 --> 00:46:52,887
George has one of the more
successful companies in the world.

778
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:55,327
And you can't measure it
just by size...

779
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:59,417
because he doesn't need the size
of a Fox or a Warners...

780
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:03,227
to accomplish the same thing he's
accomplishing in putting out his films.

781
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:11,307
As the sole owner of the most
successful franchise in movie history...

782
00:47:11,377 --> 00:47:14,577
Lucas had gained the financial means
and the creative freedom...

783
00:47:14,647 --> 00:47:17,307
to produce anything he wanted.

784
00:47:17,387 --> 00:47:19,817
George's greatest strength
as a filmmaker...

785
00:47:20,517 --> 00:47:22,317
is that he's a great storyteller.

786
00:47:22,387 --> 00:47:23,817
George has a vision.

787
00:47:23,887 --> 00:47:27,287
There are filmmakers down through
history, like Capra and John Ford...

788
00:47:27,357 --> 00:47:30,657
and they madeJohn Ford pictures
and Frank Capra pictures...

789
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:32,457
and Hitchcock made Hitchcock films...

790
00:47:32,537 --> 00:47:35,227
and George Lucas
makes George Lucas pictures.

791
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:42,667
George Lucas had helped turn the
tide of Hollywood's downbeat realism...

792
00:47:42,747 --> 00:47:45,837
and brought back a sense
of fantasy and wonder.

793
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:47,847
Movies were fun again.

794
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:50,177
But in the wake of Empire...

795
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:54,617
the filmmaker found himself unexpectedly
mired in Hollywood politics.

796
00:47:56,027 --> 00:47:59,147
To preserve the dramatic
opening sequences ofhis films...

797
00:47:59,227 --> 00:48:02,717
Lucas wanted the screen credits
to come at the end of the movies.

798
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,387
It was a highly unusual choice.

799
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:07,097
And for the first Star Wars...

800
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,257
the Writers Guild
and Directors Guild had allowed it.

801
00:48:10,337 --> 00:48:12,427
But when Lucas did the same
for the sequel...

802
00:48:12,507 --> 00:48:15,497
they fined him
over a quarter of a million dollars...

803
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:18,777
and even attempted to pull
Empire from theaters.

804
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:22,007
Next, the DGA went after
Irvin Kershner.

805
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:25,847
To protect his director, Lucas paid
all the fines to the guilds...

806
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:30,147
but the situation left him
feeling frustrated and persecuted.

807
00:48:30,227 --> 00:48:34,717
Lucas was so upset that he
dropped out of the Directors Guild...

808
00:48:35,697 --> 00:48:39,427
the Writers Guild and
the Motion Picture Association.

809
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:44,037
Another unfortunate casualty
in the wake of Empire...

810
00:48:44,107 --> 00:48:48,937
was Alan Ladd,Jr., Lucas's most vocal
supporter at 20th Century Fox.

811
00:48:49,947 --> 00:48:55,817
The criticism over the deal is what
ended my tenure at Fox, really...

812
00:48:55,887 --> 00:48:59,117
'cause people were very angry
and irritated...

813
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:02,347
even though they made millions
of dollars off it.

814
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:06,587
And had a big fight,
stomped out of the boardroom...

815
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:09,557
and said, ''I quit.''

816
00:49:10,497 --> 00:49:11,987
That was it.

817
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:16,197
20th Century Fox ultimately paid
a heavy price for Ladd's departure.

818
00:49:16,267 --> 00:49:18,897
With his longtime ally
gone from the studio...

819
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:22,537
Lucas decided to go to Paramount
with his latest movie idea...

820
00:49:22,607 --> 00:49:26,907
an action-adventure yarn called
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

821
00:49:30,747 --> 00:49:32,947
George Lucas had fought
and won the battle...

822
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:35,317
to gain his independence
as a filmmaker...

823
00:49:35,957 --> 00:49:37,647
but the war between
his Rebel Alliance...

824
00:49:37,727 --> 00:49:40,587
and the Galactic Empire
was far from over.

825
00:49:41,427 --> 00:49:44,987
As he began production on the
final chapter ofhis Star Wars saga...

826
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:47,897
he knew expectations
among fans and critics...

827
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,267
would be greater than ever before.

828
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:52,767
The project was
a high-stakes gamble...

829
00:49:52,837 --> 00:49:56,237
with Lucas once again
putting up every dollar himself.

830
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:59,677
Nothing about the film,
not even the smallest detail...

831
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,237
could be taken for granted.

832
00:50:01,317 --> 00:50:04,377
George came to me, and he said,
''The title of Episode...

833
00:50:05,717 --> 00:50:07,207
VI...

834
00:50:09,787 --> 00:50:11,727
is Return of theJedi. ''

835
00:50:11,787 --> 00:50:14,957
And I said,
''I think it's a weak title.''

836
00:50:15,027 --> 00:50:17,617
And he came back
one or two days later, and he says...

837
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:20,927
''We're calling it
Revenge of theJedi.''

838
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:23,997
Choosing the film's title
was just the beginning.

839
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,867
Jedi would require thousands
of production decisions...

840
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:28,997
on both sides of the globe.

841
00:50:29,077 --> 00:50:32,877
We were constructing, really,
in two places in California...

842
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:36,007
shooting at ILM--
that's three--

843
00:50:36,087 --> 00:50:39,077
and of course working and shooting
in London at the same time.

844
00:50:39,617 --> 00:50:43,077
As Lucas discovered, independence
was a double-edged sword.

845
00:50:43,157 --> 00:50:44,957
Quitting the Directors Guild...

846
00:50:45,027 --> 00:50:47,497
made it impossible for him
to hire his first choice...

847
00:50:47,557 --> 00:50:48,997
Steven Spielberg.

848
00:50:49,057 --> 00:50:52,497
Instead Lucas chose
Welshman Richard Marquand...

849
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:55,897
best known for the World War II
thriller, Eye of the Needle.

850
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:59,837
As the two met with Lawrence Kasdan
to discuss Jedi's script...

851
00:50:59,907 --> 00:51:02,337
a key issue was whether
Harrison Ford...

852
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:05,437
who was now equally famous
for the role of Indiana Jones...

853
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:07,477
would return as Han Solo.

854
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:11,507
The other actors after Star Wars
had signed on to do two more...

855
00:51:11,587 --> 00:51:13,517
'cause I wanted
to finish the whole thing.

856
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:17,117
Harrison did not. He had the idea,
''Why don't you kill him off?.''

857
00:51:18,527 --> 00:51:21,827
I thought Han Solo should die.

858
00:51:22,027 --> 00:51:24,967
I thought he ought to sacrifice himself
for the other two characters.

859
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:28,927
I also felt someone had to go.

860
00:51:30,107 --> 00:51:31,827
I felt someone had to die.

861
00:51:31,907 --> 00:51:35,867
I said, ''He's got no mama,
he's got no papa, he's got no future...

862
00:51:35,947 --> 00:51:41,777
he has no story responsibilities
at this point...

863
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:45,837
so let's allow him
to commit self-sacrifice. ''

864
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:50,927
And I thought it should happen
very early in the last act...

865
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:52,957
so that you would begin to worry
about everybody.

866
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,387
We should sacrifice somebody.

867
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:57,457
And George was against it...

868
00:51:57,527 --> 00:52:00,627
and George knew what he wanted,
and he got what he wanted.

869
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:02,637
Hey, it's me.

870
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:06,167
Once production began,
Lucas was determined...

871
00:52:06,237 --> 00:52:09,137
not to let the budget escalate
as it had on Empire.

872
00:52:09,207 --> 00:52:11,737
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

873
00:52:12,077 --> 00:52:16,917
It wasn't easy, given that the rest of
the world assumed money was no object.

874
00:52:16,987 --> 00:52:20,947
Anytime you would try and negotiate
for production facilities...

875
00:52:21,017 --> 00:52:24,747
people said, ''That'll cost two dollars,''
when it normally cost a dollar.

876
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:26,887
I suggested we change
the name of the picture.

877
00:52:26,957 --> 00:52:31,487
It was called Blue Harvest, and the sub
line was ''Horror Beyond Imagination. ''

878
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:32,827
B camera.

879
00:52:32,897 --> 00:52:35,867
The idea behind it was
to come up with a title that would...

880
00:52:35,937 --> 00:52:39,997
instill absolutely no interest
whatsoever in what you were doing.

881
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:43,167
It was like, ''What is Blue Harvest?''
''Who cares?''

882
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:47,877
It worked until Han and Luke and Leia
showed up to come to work...

883
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:51,647
and everybody went, ''I guess this really
isn't 'Horror Beyond Imagination. '

884
00:52:51,717 --> 00:52:53,847
I guess this is really
the next Star Wars movie.''

885
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:58,587
Revenge of theJedi would again
reunite the Star Wars cast and crew...

886
00:52:58,657 --> 00:53:02,527
who after six years and two
record-breaking motion pictures...

887
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,757
had formed a lasting bond.

888
00:53:04,827 --> 00:53:11,027
We were the same crew for
all three films, for the most part...

889
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:12,967
so it was, you know, a family.

890
00:53:16,147 --> 00:53:18,767
I'm walking along
by myself rehearsing...

891
00:53:19,107 --> 00:53:20,807
going something like...

892
00:53:20,877 --> 00:53:25,147
''Lando Calrissian never returned from
this awful place'' and so on and so on.

893
00:53:25,217 --> 00:53:29,047
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

894
00:53:29,557 --> 00:53:31,047
Suddenly I hear--

895
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:34,157
and I turn around...

896
00:53:35,057 --> 00:53:40,127
and George is now crouched behind me,
waddling along on his haunches, going--

897
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:42,997
It was a joyous moment.

898
00:53:44,737 --> 00:53:46,297
Like its predecessor...

899
00:53:46,377 --> 00:53:50,237
Jedi continued to expand the cast of
characters in the Star Wars saga.

900
00:53:52,677 --> 00:53:53,907
What's that?

901
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:57,017
One of the biggest was
intergalactic gangster--

902
00:53:57,087 --> 00:53:58,487
I know that laugh.

903
00:53:58,547 --> 00:54:00,547
Jabba the Hutt.

904
00:54:02,987 --> 00:54:08,327
George said, ''I need something that's
alien and grotesque that's like...

905
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:11,697
Sydney Greenstreet. ''

906
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:14,327
I went, ''Oh, okay. ''

907
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:20,197
When I had kind of gotten this idea
down to this big slug-like thing...

908
00:54:20,277 --> 00:54:22,467
that is just this big
pulsating mass of flesh.

909
00:54:22,537 --> 00:54:26,277
At one point, I had a fez on one of
the characters, like Sidney Greenstreet.

910
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:30,377
And then Stuart Freeborn in England's
job was to fabricate the thing.

911
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:34,387
And that was operated
with one puppeteer for each arm--

912
00:54:34,457 --> 00:54:36,717
two puppeteers for the arms,
another guy doing the head...

913
00:54:36,787 --> 00:54:39,387
another radio control guy
doing the eyes.

914
00:54:39,797 --> 00:54:44,657
There was a couple oflittle people in
it pulling things to make the tail move.

915
00:54:44,727 --> 00:54:46,427
It was quite a thing.

916
00:54:46,497 --> 00:54:48,897
I had my little dwarf
sittin'inside.

917
00:54:48,967 --> 00:54:52,567
I had a little seat made for him
in the tail here...

918
00:54:52,637 --> 00:54:54,577
and he operated it all.

919
00:54:54,637 --> 00:54:58,237
And he was sitting there for
quite a few days doing this.

920
00:54:58,547 --> 00:55:01,067
And if he operated
the first one...

921
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:07,347
whichever way he pulled it, it would
either lift it upwards or sideways...

922
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:09,547
so as he could make that move
in any direction.

923
00:55:09,627 --> 00:55:11,177
And action.

924
00:55:17,097 --> 00:55:20,127
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

925
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:27,137
I must be allowed to speak.

926
00:55:39,817 --> 00:55:42,587
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

927
00:55:49,457 --> 00:55:51,427
Master Luke, you're standing on--

928
00:56:07,817 --> 00:56:12,217
Jabba has to pull the rug out from
under Luke and he falls into the pit...

929
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,947
and there's this big rancor pit monster.

930
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:25,267
George was really adamant that we were
going to do it as a man in a suit.

931
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:28,327
It was gonna be like
a really cool Godzilla.

932
00:56:29,537 --> 00:56:34,867
Tony McVey, one of the sculptors,
fabricated this big rancor suit...

933
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:36,877
based on my design.

934
00:56:36,947 --> 00:56:40,467
He designed this thing I call kind of
a cross between a bear and a potato.

935
00:56:40,547 --> 00:56:44,207
It was just this big dumb thing.

936
00:56:45,247 --> 00:56:48,487
But it never looked that great,
no matter what we did.

937
00:56:48,557 --> 00:56:53,087
So at some point, George said,
''Let's do it some other way. ''

938
00:56:53,157 --> 00:56:58,757
And so Dennis thought, well, let's try
and do it as a high-speed puppet.

939
00:56:59,737 --> 00:57:01,967
We designed
the skeleton for rancor.

940
00:57:03,707 --> 00:57:06,897
Tom St. Amand and Dave Sosalla
and I puppeteered the thing.

941
00:57:10,647 --> 00:57:13,167
It was a crazy way of working...

942
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:18,877
because this thing has to walk
into a room and turn around and roar...

943
00:57:18,947 --> 00:57:22,547
and it's like a four-second shot and
you're shooting at 90 frames a second.

944
00:57:22,617 --> 00:57:23,957
You've got a second to shoot it.

945
00:57:38,407 --> 00:57:41,137
ILM's creatures
might have been puppets...

946
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:45,537
but they could still elicit an emotional
reaction from their human costars.

947
00:57:45,607 --> 00:57:47,637
One even triggered
a panic attack.

948
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:54,107
I'd got claustrophobia once.
I didn't even have the whole suit on.

949
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:57,777
I was lying on the floor, the camera's
about that far away from me.

950
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,917
Salacious Crumb--
the wonderful Salacious Crumb--

951
00:58:00,997 --> 00:58:02,657
animated by Tim Rose...

952
00:58:03,327 --> 00:58:05,627
is pulling out my eye.

953
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:07,857
34-A, take two.

954
00:58:07,937 --> 00:58:08,927
Action.

955
00:58:08,997 --> 00:58:12,597
And something went in my mind.
I didn't catch a breath or something.

956
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:15,797
And I suddenly could feel panic
just absorbing into my body.

957
00:58:15,877 --> 00:58:18,107
Not my eyes! R2, help!

958
00:58:18,177 --> 00:58:21,117
And I was thinking,
''Get me out! Get me out!''

959
00:58:21,177 --> 00:58:25,307
And I just kept repeating it, until they
managed to whiz the head off.

960
00:58:26,217 --> 00:58:27,307
And cut.

961
00:58:27,387 --> 00:58:29,687
Daniels may have
lost his head as 3PO...

962
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:32,717
but when it came to
risking life and limb...

963
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:37,957
the production now had a team
of trained stunt professionals.

964
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:46,197
For the execution scene on
Jabba's barge...

965
00:58:46,267 --> 00:58:50,677
stunt performers dropped in on the
most ravenous monster yet-- the Sarlacc.

966
00:58:50,747 --> 00:58:52,237
Action.

967
00:58:56,717 --> 00:59:00,807
It wasn't edited that way, but I was
the first guy to come off the skiff...

968
00:59:02,217 --> 00:59:03,377
into the pit

969
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,087
I had to make sure it would work
and everybody would be all right.

970
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:08,417
I had a lot of sand
coming on top of me.

971
00:59:08,497 --> 00:59:11,017
But I was able to say to
the guys, if you go in...

972
00:59:11,097 --> 00:59:13,027
shut your eyes,
keep your mouths closed, right?

973
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:16,697
Put some cotton up your nose,
otherwise you'll be sniffing up sand.

974
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:18,467
Three people went in
one after the other.

975
00:59:19,107 --> 00:59:21,697
One went in, they pulled him out.
The other went in, they pulled him out.

976
00:59:21,777 --> 00:59:23,637
What was happening down below...

977
00:59:23,707 --> 00:59:26,477
is a comedy film of its own,
quite honestly.

978
00:59:26,547 --> 00:59:28,447
But these are the things
the public don't see.

979
00:59:32,217 --> 00:59:34,477
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

980
00:59:36,257 --> 00:59:37,747
33, take one.

981
00:59:50,737 --> 00:59:52,067
Boba Fett?

982
00:59:52,907 --> 00:59:53,837
Where?

983
01:00:04,587 --> 01:00:09,317
I was hanging on a rope with Han Solo,
and he was trying to save me...

984
01:00:09,387 --> 01:00:12,217
and one of the squibs
went right through my toe.

985
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:16,897
I'm screaming to Han, ''Stop, stop!''
He's so busy acting.

986
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:21,687
I'm in pain, and all of a sudden
he realized that I got hurt.

987
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:23,527
Wait! I thought you were blind!

988
01:00:23,607 --> 01:00:25,567
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

989
01:00:25,637 --> 01:00:27,267
A little higher!

990
01:00:27,337 --> 01:00:30,737
Harrison, really, he's one of
those actors that's very intense.

991
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:32,367
Chewie, pull us up.

992
01:00:32,447 --> 01:00:34,967
He really gets into
what he's doing.

993
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:37,207
So he was really into it.

994
01:00:39,817 --> 01:00:43,117
For Carrie Fisher, getting into
the role of Leia this time...

995
01:00:43,187 --> 01:00:46,217
meant fitting into
a skimpy slave-girl costume.

996
01:00:47,957 --> 01:00:49,947
I got to kill Jabba the Hutt...

997
01:00:50,027 --> 01:00:53,967
but I was still much more concerned
about the slave-girl outfit...

998
01:00:54,037 --> 01:00:56,897
and what I was gonna do
about exercise.

999
01:00:56,967 --> 01:01:00,597
31 -C, take two.
A and B cameras.

1000
01:01:00,677 --> 01:01:03,607
Wave your arm around.
Action!

1001
01:01:03,677 --> 01:01:09,137
Then George Lucas said, ''Instead of
attacking Jabba from the front...

1002
01:01:09,217 --> 01:01:11,307
and getting angry with him
and whacking him...

1003
01:01:11,387 --> 01:01:13,577
I want Carrie tojump on his back. ''

1004
01:01:13,657 --> 01:01:15,677
She's got high-heel shoes on...

1005
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:19,117
and it happened that my little fellow
inside--it was only foam rubber--

1006
01:01:19,187 --> 01:01:21,657
it went right into his head.

1007
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:25,257
He screamed his head off,
so we had to stop. Cut.

1008
01:01:25,327 --> 01:01:27,427
All right. Hold it.

1009
01:01:27,967 --> 01:01:32,627
Before they could do the shot again, I
had to build a firm bit over his head...

1010
01:01:32,707 --> 01:01:34,637
so she could get up there.

1011
01:01:35,177 --> 01:01:37,197
Take three, pickup. A and B camera.

1012
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:40,247
- Background, go.
- Okay, and action!

1013
01:01:52,557 --> 01:01:54,257
That was a great relief.

1014
01:01:54,457 --> 01:01:59,327
He was an unpleasant... thing
with mong in the corner of the mouth.

1015
01:01:59,397 --> 01:02:01,057
I never really liked that.

1016
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:07,107
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

1017
01:02:18,287 --> 01:02:20,277
For the veteran cast members...

1018
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:23,977
bringing something fresh
to their characters was often diffiicult.

1019
01:02:24,057 --> 01:02:24,857
Don't move.

1020
01:02:26,527 --> 01:02:29,187
- I love you.
- I know.

1021
01:02:29,257 --> 01:02:30,087
Stand up.

1022
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:34,267
Another challenge on the set...

1023
01:02:34,337 --> 01:02:37,737
was Richard Marquand's relative
inexperience with special effects.

1024
01:02:37,807 --> 01:02:40,737
It's a diffiicult thing to do,
you know...

1025
01:02:41,937 --> 01:02:45,847
work on the one hand with
the special effects...

1026
01:02:45,907 --> 01:02:49,507
and on the other hand,
with a story line with actors...

1027
01:02:50,347 --> 01:02:53,477
and making those two things marry.

1028
01:02:54,017 --> 01:02:55,847
I hadn't realized that, ultimately...

1029
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:59,187
it was probably easier for me to do
these things than to farm them out.

1030
01:02:59,457 --> 01:03:01,927
Because it was even more
complex than the last one...

1031
01:03:01,997 --> 01:03:05,157
I really did have to end up
being there every day on the set...

1032
01:03:05,227 --> 01:03:08,067
and working very closely
with Richard and shooting second unit.

1033
01:03:08,137 --> 01:03:11,827
There was really more work than
I thought it was going to be.

1034
01:03:11,907 --> 01:03:13,837
Under Lucas's supervision...

1035
01:03:13,907 --> 01:03:17,037
the production moved to the
redwood forests of Northern California.

1036
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:18,137
B camera.

1037
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:21,877
There they photographed one of the most
exhilarating action sequences--

1038
01:03:22,777 --> 01:03:23,477
Hey, wait!

1039
01:03:23,547 --> 01:03:25,487
the speeder bike chase.

1040
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:28,717
Quick,jam their comlink.
Center switch.

1041
01:03:34,297 --> 01:03:36,697
I got the idea of using a Steadicam...

1042
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:39,257
and we did a test
in a local park here...

1043
01:03:40,697 --> 01:03:45,367
of walking through the woods
on a path that we kind of disguised...

1044
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:49,637
and he shot with a camera that shot
one frame of film every second.

1045
01:03:49,937 --> 01:03:55,037
So when you project it back 2 4 frames
a second, it's going 2 4 times faster.

1046
01:03:55,117 --> 01:03:56,977
We figured you walked about
five miles an hour.

1047
01:03:57,047 --> 01:03:59,577
It came up to about 1 00 miles
an hour. It looked great.

1048
01:04:34,117 --> 01:04:37,347
Jedi surprised audiences
with its imaginative scope--

1049
01:04:38,157 --> 01:04:40,587
both large and small.

1050
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:44,327
It introduced a tiny, but valiant,
new ally to the rebellion.

1051
01:04:44,397 --> 01:04:47,487
A race of pint-sized warriors
known as Ewoks.

1052
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:49,037
And action.

1053
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:51,937
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

1054
01:04:56,507 --> 01:04:57,667
Hey!

1055
01:04:57,747 --> 01:04:59,867
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

1056
01:05:00,547 --> 01:05:04,877
Joining the cast was Warwick Davis,
who was just a youngster at the time...

1057
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:07,977
but also a die-hard
Star Wars fan.

1058
01:05:08,057 --> 01:05:09,987
I was an 1 1-year-old boy at school...

1059
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:14,057
and my grandmother
happened to hear a radio commercial...

1060
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:16,357
on the London radio station.

1061
01:05:16,427 --> 01:05:19,457
They were putting out a call
for short people...

1062
01:05:19,527 --> 01:05:21,757
to be in this new Star Wars movie.

1063
01:05:22,367 --> 01:05:25,697
I don't think anybody on the movie
was quite as excited as I was.

1064
01:05:26,107 --> 01:05:30,127
Being an 1 1-year-old on the Star Wars
set, there was no stopping me.

1065
01:05:30,207 --> 01:05:34,647
In the role of Wicket, Davis became the
film's most prominently featured Ewok...

1066
01:05:35,777 --> 01:05:39,407
but only after Kenny Baker
was suddenly taken ill.

1067
01:05:39,687 --> 01:05:42,707
I had this scene with Carrie
and the speeder bikes...

1068
01:05:42,787 --> 01:05:45,847
in California in the redwoods.

1069
01:05:45,927 --> 01:05:49,447
I was looking forward to this. ''Carrie's
nice. I like working with Carrie.''

1070
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:53,657
Come the morning of the shoot,
Kenny was very ill in bed...

1071
01:05:53,737 --> 01:05:55,397
with what I believe
was food poisoning.

1072
01:05:55,467 --> 01:05:58,907
I was seriously in pain.

1073
01:06:00,637 --> 01:06:03,367
They said, ''We gotta do it
because we've got Carrie Fisher in.

1074
01:06:03,437 --> 01:06:05,377
We've got the scene set up.''

1075
01:06:05,447 --> 01:06:07,377
So Warwick took over.

1076
01:06:07,447 --> 01:06:10,577
Seventy-two A, take two.
A and B cameras.

1077
01:06:11,587 --> 01:06:14,887
And they called me in
to play the scene instead.

1078
01:06:14,957 --> 01:06:16,447
Action.

1079
01:06:23,257 --> 01:06:25,197
Cut it out.

1080
01:06:27,637 --> 01:06:29,597
I had a dog at the time...

1081
01:06:29,667 --> 01:06:32,397
and I remember whenever he would
hear a strange noise...

1082
01:06:32,467 --> 01:06:36,267
he would tilt his head from
side to side to look inquisitive.

1083
01:06:36,337 --> 01:06:40,337
I took those kind of movements
and used them in the character.

1084
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:44,367
So whenever he sees something or hears
a strange sound, he would tilt his head.

1085
01:06:47,057 --> 01:06:49,547
1 1 5-S, take three.
A camera mark.

1086
01:06:49,617 --> 01:06:50,607
Mark.

1087
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:53,557
- What did he say, Ewoks?
- He said, ''Look out!''

1088
01:07:20,017 --> 01:07:22,387
I like Ewoks.

1089
01:07:23,857 --> 01:07:29,657
I think they're in there to really
show that you don't need technology...

1090
01:07:29,727 --> 01:07:33,287
you need the will and the belief
to take you through anything.

1091
01:07:33,367 --> 01:07:37,427
And the fact that the Ewoks
were able to defeat the Empire...

1092
01:07:37,507 --> 01:07:40,237
only using ropes and rocks...

1093
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:43,397
I think that said something
about them as a race of creatures.

1094
01:07:44,407 --> 01:07:45,377
Fighters coming in.

1095
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:48,507
Doesn't matter
how much machinery you had.

1096
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:54,517
If the will of the people is strong...

1097
01:07:54,587 --> 01:07:55,817
they will always win.

1098
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:57,817
You've failed, Your Highness.

1099
01:07:58,857 --> 01:08:00,617
I am a Jedi...

1100
01:08:00,697 --> 01:08:02,457
like my father before me.

1101
01:08:02,527 --> 01:08:04,017
And action.

1102
01:08:12,507 --> 01:08:15,477
As filming on Revenge of theJedi
drew closer to completion...

1103
01:08:17,447 --> 01:08:19,407
emotions ran high.

1104
01:08:23,817 --> 01:08:26,807
And saying good-bye
would be diffiicult.

1105
01:08:32,987 --> 01:08:36,897
As we were finishing the third one,
we had the sense it was the end--

1106
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:40,027
that they were gonna tie up all
the loose ends.

1107
01:08:40,097 --> 01:08:41,627
There was a kind of...

1108
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:45,657
''clearing your locker out at the end
of the semester'' feel to it all.

1109
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:49,127
Part of me was saying,
''I'm so glad to put this behind me. ''

1110
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:50,607
And the other aspect was...

1111
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,177
''Well, what about
all the adventures Luke could have?''

1112
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:01,077
For the moment...

1113
01:09:01,157 --> 01:09:04,777
George Lucas was totally focused
on completing his epic trilogy.

1114
01:09:04,857 --> 01:09:08,557
He weighed every decision,
including a change in Jedi's title...

1115
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:10,427
just weeks before it opened.

1116
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:14,257
Just before it got to the theaters,
George came back and said...

1117
01:09:14,337 --> 01:09:17,957
''I wanna go back to
Return of theJedi.''

1118
01:09:18,037 --> 01:09:23,707
The logic behind that was
a Jedi does not take revenge.

1119
01:09:24,507 --> 01:09:29,277
Return of theJedi opened
on Wednesday, May 25, 1 983...

1120
01:09:29,347 --> 01:09:33,877
exactly six years from the day
that Star Wars made its debut.

1121
01:09:33,957 --> 01:09:37,717
On its first day,
the film took in $6.2 million...

1122
01:09:37,787 --> 01:09:41,057
making it the biggest opening-day
box offiice in history...

1123
01:09:41,127 --> 01:09:42,927
by nearly a million dollars.

1124
01:09:42,997 --> 01:09:44,517
I told you they'd do it.

1125
01:09:46,427 --> 01:09:51,567
But for George Lucas, completing
the trilogy involved personal sacrifice.

1126
01:09:52,237 --> 01:09:55,967
The success ofJedi
would be bittersweet at best.

1127
01:09:56,737 --> 01:09:59,367
The challenge is trying to
do something all-consuming...

1128
01:09:59,447 --> 01:10:01,107
with having a private life.

1129
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:04,307
I had made the decision--
after Star Wars--

1130
01:10:05,817 --> 01:10:07,747
that I had certain goals
in my private life.

1131
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:09,877
One was to be
independent of Hollywood...

1132
01:10:09,957 --> 01:10:12,257
the other was ultimately
to have a family.

1133
01:10:12,327 --> 01:10:16,127
I finished Return of theJedi.
I figured that was the end of it for me.

1134
01:10:16,197 --> 01:10:18,667
I figured, ''Well, I've done it.
I've finished my trilogy.

1135
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:22,397
This is what I started out to do and
what I was determined to get finished. ''

1136
01:10:22,467 --> 01:10:26,097
It was overwhelming and diffiicult,
but fate has a way of stepping in.

1137
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:32,107
I ended up getting divorced right
as the film Jedi was finished...

1138
01:10:32,177 --> 01:10:35,617
and I was left to raise
my daughter.

1139
01:10:41,117 --> 01:10:44,647
With the profits he made from
the Star Wars movies and merchandise...

1140
01:10:44,727 --> 01:10:48,177
George Lucas was able to keep funding
his dream of pushing the boundaries...

1141
01:10:48,257 --> 01:10:50,487
of film and audio technology.

1142
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:56,097
For the next two decades, he continued
to create new and exciting innovations.

1143
01:10:56,167 --> 01:11:00,497
In the process, he fundamentally
changed filmmaking for the better.

1144
01:11:01,137 --> 01:11:05,437
In 1 984, Lucasfilm revolutionized
motion picture editing...

1145
01:11:05,507 --> 01:11:07,667
with EditDroid and SoundDroid...

1146
01:11:07,747 --> 01:11:11,577
the world's first nonlinear
digital editing systems.

1147
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:14,587
For the first time, filmmakers
could instantly access...

1148
01:11:14,657 --> 01:11:17,617
any frame or audio track
at the touch of a button.

1149
01:11:18,327 --> 01:11:23,487
In 1985, Lucasfilm's computer division
invented the Pixar computer...

1150
01:11:23,557 --> 01:11:25,957
helping generate
a new form of animation...

1151
01:11:26,027 --> 01:11:28,297
characterized by
three-dimensional realism.

1152
01:11:29,397 --> 01:11:34,267
The division was later sold
and became Pixar Animation Studios...

1153
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:37,207
the creator of such
instant classics as Toy Story.

1154
01:11:38,677 --> 01:11:41,877
The digital breakthroughs
that Lucas himselfhad ushered in...

1155
01:11:41,947 --> 01:11:44,647
would eventually lead him back,
full-circle, to Star Wars.

1156
01:11:45,787 --> 01:11:50,117
In 1 993, after helping create
ILM's groundbreaking effects...

1157
01:11:50,187 --> 01:11:53,087
in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park...

1158
01:11:53,157 --> 01:11:55,217
Lucas concluded
that digital technology...

1159
01:11:55,297 --> 01:11:57,987
had finally caught up
to his original vision.

1160
01:11:59,397 --> 01:12:04,897
In 1 997, he would revisit and perfect
his galactic saga at last...

1161
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:08,067
with the Star Wars Trilogy:
Special Edition.

1162
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:11,337
For an entire generation...

1163
01:12:11,407 --> 01:12:16,407
people have experienced Star Wars
the only way it's been possible--

1164
01:12:16,477 --> 01:12:18,917
on the TVscreen.

1165
01:12:18,987 --> 01:12:23,857
But if you've only seen it this way,
you haven't seen it at all.

1166
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:42,207
Things I couldn't afford
to do at the time...

1167
01:12:42,277 --> 01:12:46,577
or had to give up on because I didn't
have the time, money or power to do it.

1168
01:12:46,647 --> 01:12:50,377
I was able to complete the films the way
I originally intended them to be...

1169
01:12:53,117 --> 01:12:55,607
and have it be pretty much
the way I want them to be.

1170
01:13:03,057 --> 01:13:07,057
In 1 999, 22 years after
the original premiere...

1171
01:13:07,127 --> 01:13:11,157
Lucas introduced
Episode I: The Phantom Menace.

1172
01:13:11,237 --> 01:13:15,197
The film marked the beginning of
another trilogy for a new generation.

1173
01:13:15,277 --> 01:13:19,437
It also allowed Lucas to continue his
pioneering use of digital technology.

1174
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:24,347
I'm finishing this for the love
of Star Wars. I like Star Wars.

1175
01:13:24,417 --> 01:13:26,387
I want to see
the whole thing finished.

1176
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,417
For more than three decades...

1177
01:13:29,487 --> 01:13:32,977
George Lucas's passion and dedication
to the Star Wars saga...

1178
01:13:33,057 --> 01:13:35,087
has brought its share of rewards.

1179
01:13:35,157 --> 01:13:39,657
But like the Force itself,
success also has its dark side.

1180
01:13:41,997 --> 01:13:45,667
I was trying to stay independent so I
could make the movies I wanted to make.

1181
01:13:45,737 --> 01:13:49,137
At the same time,
I was fighting the corporate system...

1182
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:50,697
which I didn't like.

1183
01:13:50,777 --> 01:13:54,207
I'm not happy that corporations
have taken over the film industry.

1184
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:57,747
But now I find myself
being the head of a corporation.

1185
01:13:57,817 --> 01:14:02,807
So there's a certain irony there
that I've become the very thing...

1186
01:14:02,887 --> 01:14:04,877
that I was trying to avoid...

1187
01:14:05,827 --> 01:14:09,087
which is basically what
part of Star Wars is about.

1188
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:10,887
The circle is now complete.

1189
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:13,527
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

1190
01:14:13,597 --> 01:14:15,627
Now I am the master.

1191
01:14:15,697 --> 01:14:17,357
That is Darth Vader.

1192
01:14:17,437 --> 01:14:20,927
He becomes the very thing that
he's trying to protect himself against.

1193
01:14:21,007 --> 01:14:24,377
But, at the same time, I feel good
that I'm able to make my movies...

1194
01:14:24,447 --> 01:14:26,377
the way I want them to be.

1195
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:31,217
While George Lucas has remained
true to his own vision...

1196
01:14:31,617 --> 01:14:35,447
it's been audiences everywhere
who've reaped the rewards...

1197
01:14:35,517 --> 01:14:38,187
ever since May, 1 977...

1198
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:42,747
when moviegoers first caught sight
of that galaxy far, far away.

1199
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:51,797
The themes that George is dealing
with are so strong, so primordial.

1200
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:55,037
The conflicts between
children and their parents.

1201
01:14:55,437 --> 01:14:57,877
Luke Skywalker was
George growing up...

1202
01:14:57,947 --> 01:15:02,277
George facing a conflict
and the need to prove himself.

1203
01:15:02,717 --> 01:15:04,577
You have learned much, young one.

1204
01:15:04,647 --> 01:15:06,517
And he did, powerfully.

1205
01:15:06,587 --> 01:15:08,557
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1206
01:15:08,617 --> 01:15:13,317
George was able to put the good guys
and the bad guys and the mythology...

1207
01:15:13,387 --> 01:15:15,357
in a package that
somehow touched us.

1208
01:15:15,827 --> 01:15:19,267
I don't know how. I guess if you
know how, everybody'd be doing it.

1209
01:15:19,327 --> 01:15:21,597
Do, or do not.

1210
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:23,027
There is no try.

1211
01:15:23,097 --> 01:15:27,227
I am so pleased to be a part of that
whole legend, even as an observer.

1212
01:15:27,307 --> 01:15:29,607
And I am just an observer.

1213
01:15:29,677 --> 01:15:31,367
Most impressive.

1214
01:15:31,447 --> 01:15:33,437
He's created people that
everyone in the world knows.

1215
01:15:33,507 --> 01:15:36,477
Any author that could create
such memorable characters...

1216
01:15:36,547 --> 01:15:38,537
would be a very happy person indeed.

1217
01:15:39,017 --> 01:15:41,037
Laugh it up, fuzzball.

1218
01:15:41,117 --> 01:15:43,917
He really established
the independent film market.

1219
01:15:43,987 --> 01:15:47,257
His films changed epic productions.

1220
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:51,387
He changed storytelling.
He created what Hollywood is today.

1221
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:54,987
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

1222
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:57,727
George was creating
a new world for Hollywood...

1223
01:15:57,807 --> 01:16:00,067
and we were lucky enough
to be a part of it.

1224
01:16:00,137 --> 01:16:01,197
Come on!

1225
01:16:02,277 --> 01:16:05,767
He's notjust the creator and director,
now he is the studio.

1226
01:16:05,847 --> 01:16:10,177
He can make exactly the movie
that he wants to make.

1227
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:13,687
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

1228
01:16:13,747 --> 01:16:16,617
One of the things that George Lucas
has done in Star Wars...

1229
01:16:16,687 --> 01:16:20,387
is to communicate, in fact,
with the younger self that resides...

1230
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:22,687
somewhere inside
even the oldest person.

1231
01:16:24,297 --> 01:16:25,597
Good shot, Red Two.

1232
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:31,657
I think our cultural imagination
has been transformed by Lucas's films...

1233
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:36,007
by taking us back to stories
that make us all feel...

1234
01:16:36,077 --> 01:16:40,007
that we share in the heroic journey
of the human species on this Earth.

1235
01:16:40,077 --> 01:16:41,807
The Force will be with you...

1236
01:16:41,877 --> 01:16:43,247
always.

1237
01:16:43,317 --> 01:16:47,117
George Lucas moved us into
a new place in space...

1238
01:16:47,187 --> 01:16:49,517
a new time in the future...

1239
01:16:49,587 --> 01:16:53,317
which no one else
had created up to that time.

1240
01:16:53,387 --> 01:16:58,057
Star Wars had a tremendous impact
on the young people...

1241
01:16:58,127 --> 01:17:00,157
as well as adults for that matter.

1242
01:17:03,097 --> 01:17:06,597
I committed myself to making these
movies. I believe in these movies.

1243
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:08,607
I think they're very entertaining.

1244
01:17:08,677 --> 01:17:11,297
If I can get a room
full of people and they enjoy it...

1245
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,637
then I've done whatever I hope to do.

1246
01:17:13,707 --> 01:17:18,237
For George Lucas, what began
as a quest for creative freedom...

1247
01:17:18,317 --> 01:17:21,517
became a philosophy,
a cultural phenomenon...

1248
01:17:21,587 --> 01:17:24,177
and an empire of dreams.

1249
01:19:40,557 --> 01:19:42,497
And may the Force go with you.
