15

<i>a visual man in</i>
<i>a profound way.</i>

NARRATOR:
<i>But the </i>Star Wars <i>trilogy</i>

18

<i>didn't just change the way</i>
<i>we look at movies.</i>

19

<i>It changed the way that</i>
<i>movies are made.</i>

You must unlearn
what you have learned.

21

The Force will be
with you always.

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,320
I expected not to ever
make a hit movie.
That wasn't my agenda.

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,240
<i>I certainly didn't expect</i>

(OPENING THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,040
NARRATOR: <i>It's hard</i>
<i>to remember a time</i>

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,160
<i>The world was different then.</i>

34

<i>There were no cell phones</i>
<i>or personal computers.</i>

35

<i>The Internet was years away.</i>

<i>Even home video</i>

<i>The space race was over.</i>
NEIL ARMSTRONG:<i> That's one</i>
<i>small step for man.</i>

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,880
NARRATOR: <i>Americans felt</i>
<i>deeply mired</i>
<i>in the present.</i>

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,000
<i>It was a time</i>
<i>of economic inflation</i>

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,160
<i>and rising oil prices,</i>

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,400
<i>and the nation had grown</i>
<i>cynical about its heroes</i>
<i>and its leaders.</i>

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,560
Well, I'm not a crook.

WALTER CRONKITE:
<i>In our country,</i>
<i>Watergate tore us apart.</i>

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,440
And then we had
the Vietnam War
on top of that,

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,120
which was dividing the nation
like nothing else had.

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,600
<i>It was a terrible decade of</i>
<i>great storm and violence</i>
<i>in our history.</i>

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,320
NARRATOR:<i> On the big</i>
<i>screen, Hollywood's view</i>
<i>was equally grim.</i>

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>The films of the early 1970s</i>
<i>were gritty and</i>
<i>often downbeat,</i>

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,200
<i>a reflection of America's</i>
<i>social and political upheaval.</i>

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,720
<i>Instead of</i>
<i>old-fashioned heroes,</i>
<i>the screen was dominated</i>

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,120
<i>by hardnosed antiheroes</i>
<i>who broke all the rules.</i>

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,040
GEORGE LUCAS:
<i>In the late '60s,</i>
<i>the Warners, the Zanucks,</i>

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,720
<i>all the people</i>
<i>that started the</i>
<i>studios in the first place,</i>

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,680
<i>were retiring, and they were</i>
<i>selling the studios to</i>
<i>corporations.</i>

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,520
They were beverage companies
and all kinds

56
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,720
of other businesses.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,120
They didn't know at all
how to run a movie studio.

58
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,040
<i>All they know is if</i>
<i>the marketing department</i>

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,360
<i>said people</i>
<i>want to see this,</i>
<i>then you make that.</i>

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,920
<i>They started</i>
<i>marketing pictures</i>
<i>and studying demographics,</i>

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
<i>and these kinds of things.</i>

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,280
<i>They realized that there was</i>
<i>a market for films</i>

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,800
<i>made by young people</i>
<i>for young people,</i>

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,880
<i>'cause the young person was</i>
<i>becoming a bigger part</i>
<i>of their market.</i>

65
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,680
NARRATOR: <i>The studio system</i>
<i>that lasted for decades</i>

66
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,640
<i>had now collapsed.</i>

67
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,160
<i>And Hollywood executives,</i>

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,800
<i>desperate to connect</i>
<i>with younger audiences,</i>

69
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,520
<i>turned to film schools to</i>
<i>find the next generation</i>
<i>of moviemakers.</i>

70
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,120
MAN: Action.
NARRATOR:<i> It was in</i>
<i>this atmosphere of change</i>

71
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,840
<i>that gifted young directors</i>
<i>like Francis Ford Coppola,</i>

72

<i>Brian De Palma,</i>
<i>Martin Scorsese,</i>
<i>and Steven Spielberg</i>

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,360
<i>brought a more</i>
<i>personal sensibility</i>
<i>to the screen.</i>

74
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,080
It was a state of confusion,
and a lot of filmmakers

75
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,120
<i>got to make projects that</i>
<i>they ordinarily wouldn't</i>
<i>have gotten to make.</i>

76
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,120
<i>And I got caught right</i>
<i>in the middle of it.</i>

77
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,160
STEVEN SPIELBERG:<i> George was</i>
<i>the kind of maverick from</i>
<i>Northern California,</i>

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
an independent filmmaker,

79
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,600
who was always
extremely proud

80
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,280
that he had very
few attachments
to Hollywood.

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,160
NARRATOR: <i>Born in</i>
<i>Modesto, California,</i>

82
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,680
<i>George Lucas grew up</i>
<i>reading adventure stories</i>

83

(SCREAMS)

85
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,120
<i>But it wasn't until college</i>
<i>that his own dreams of</i>
<i>filmmaking began to surface.</i>

86
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,360
<i>In 1963, he left Modesto</i>
<i>to attend film classes</i>

<i>at the University</i>
<i>of Southern California.</i>

IRVIN KERSHNER:<i> I was</i>
<i>teaching at USC, and George</i>
<i>was in one of the seminars.</i>

89
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,360
We talked about some of his
early attempts at filmmaking.

90
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,960
And I'll tell you,
right from the beginning,

91
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,760
<i>George had a unique vision.</i>

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,360
George was a guy
that thought out of the box,

93
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,840
as you can certainly see
by his student film <i>THX1138.</i>

HOWARD KAZANJIAN:
<i>He shot a film that was</i>
<i>20 minutes long.</i>

97
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
<i>It was supposed to be</i>
<i>five minutes.</i>

MAN: You're going for
the emergency switch.

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,960
<i>But he got a great deal</i>
<i>of recognition</i>

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,640
<i>and opened the eyes</i>
<i>of professors</i>

101
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,000
that kids could do something
out of the box,

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,320
beyond what
the restrictions were.

103
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,200
NARRATOR:<i> Lucas won acclaim</i>
<i>for his technical skills</i>

104
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
<i>and imagination</i>
<i>as a storyteller.</i>

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,360
<i>His interest in mythology</i>
<i>and philosophy gave his work</i>
<i>an added dimension.</i>

106
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,520
KERSHNER:<i> George's style</i>
<i>was fantastic.</i>

107
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
Incredible.

108
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,240
I don't care what
he was doing,

109
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,240
it just looked more personal
than some of the other work.

<i>becoming successful.</i>

115

feeling about being able to be

"I bet you can't do

post-production on
<i>American Graffiti,</i>

142
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,120
we organized a screening
at the Northpoint Cinema
in San Francisco.

143
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,360
<i>And we felt the reaction</i>
<i>to the film was</i>
<i>quite positive.</i>

144
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,120
<i>But Ned Tanen from Universal</i>
<i>was very upset.</i>

145
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,720
He said, "You shouldn't be
showing it to an audience
at this stage."

146
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,720
And we were totally
flabbergasted.

147
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,800
LUCAS: <i>My first film</i>
<i>they didn't understand,</i>

148
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,840
<i>and they meddled with it</i>
<i>after it was all finished.</i>

149
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,520
Same thing with
my second film,
the corporate entity came in

150
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,320
and jerry-rigged with it,
cut five minutes out.

151
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,320
NARRATOR: <i>But even</i>
<i>before the release of</i>
American Graffiti,

152
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,600
<i>George Lucas's imagination</i>
<i>was pointed at the stars.</i>

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,080
KURTZ: <i>All during this time,</i>
<i>he was talking about the fact</i>

154
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,000
<i>that he would like to do a</i>
Flash Gordon <i>kind of</i>
<i>1930s space opera.</i>

155
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
And he started working on that
in earnest.

156
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
LUCAS:<i> And people said,</i>

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,440
<i>"Of all things to pick,</i>
<i>why in the world</i>
<i>would you do that?"</i>

158
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,640
I said, "Well, you know,
it's fun to make films
for young people.

159
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,800
<i>"It's a chance to sort of</i>
<i>make an impression on them.</i>

160
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,360
"I wanna do this."
NARRATOR:<i> With his galactic</i>
<i>fairy tale,</i>

161
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,240
<i>Lucas hoped to reinvent</i>
<i>a classic genre.</i>

162
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,800
<i>Among his influences were</i>
<i>the writings of scholar</i>
<i>and educator Joseph Campbell,</i>

163
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,560
<i>in which he explored</i>
<i>the origins of myth</i>
<i>and world religions.</i>

164
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,760
LEO BRAUDY:<i> When Lucas was</i>
<i>writing the script of</i>
Star Wars,

165
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,080
<i>he was heavily interested</i>
<i>in Joseph Campbell.</i>

166
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,600
What Joseph Campbell was
interested in was to see
the connections

167
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,640
between the myths
of different cultures

168
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,960
to try to find out
what were the threads

169
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,560
<i>that tied all these very</i>
<i>disparate cultures together.</i>

170
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,960
LUCAS:<i> I did research to try</i>
<i>to distill everything</i>
<i>down into motifs</i>

171
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,320
<i>that would be universal.</i>

172
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,800
I attribute most of
the success to the
psychological underpinnings,

173
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,120
which had been around
for thousands of years,

174
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,400
and that people still react
the same way to the stories
as they always have.

175
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,480
BILL MOYERS:
<i>George is nothing</i>
<i>if not a good reporter.</i>

176
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,560
<i>And when he sets out</i>
<i>to do his work,</i>

177
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,840
<i>he starts reporting from</i>
<i>the best sources</i>
<i>he can gather.</i>

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,680
He brought Campbell
into the process

179
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,920
of looking at his work
on<i> Star Wars</i>

180
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,880
and saying, "Is this right?
Am I getting it down?

181
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,160
"Is this the right emphasis?
Is this the right character?"

182
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,840
<i>Joseph Campbell said to me,</i>

183
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,560
<i>the best student he ever had</i>
<i>was George Lucas.</i>

184
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,840
NARRATOR:
<i>Like such epics</i>
<i>as</i> The Odyssey,

185
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,560
Beowulf<i> and </i>The Legend of
King Arthur,

186
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,120
Star Wars <i>drew from a shared</i>
<i>pool of mythic archetypes.</i>

187
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,920
CARRIE FISHER:<i> You have</i>
<i>the youth who's on</i>
<i>the adventure</i>

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,520
<i>that you can identify with.</i>

189
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,240
<i>You have the swashbuckler.</i>

190
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,680
<i>And you have the damsel.</i>

191
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,600
She may not sort
of have the reactions
that are conventional,

192
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,640
however she is in distress.

193
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,600
<i>And you have the wise old man,</i>
<i>who you go and you find him.</i>

194
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,080
<i>And you have</i>
<i>the funnier characters.</i>

195
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,440
<i>I mean, it really adheres</i>
<i>strictly to that form.</i>

196
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,960
LUCAS: <i>It's the traditional,</i>
<i>ritualistic coming</i>
<i>of age story.</i>

197
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,680
And when I went into
the mythological side
of what I wanted to do,

198
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,680
that's a key factor
with heroes.

199
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
NARRATOR:<i> By the summer</i>
<i>of 1973,</i>

200
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,920
<i>George Lucas had created</i>
<i>a treatment that he felt</i>
<i>was ready to shop around.</i>

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,560
<i>Whether anyone would be</i>
<i>interested, that was</i>
<i>another story.</i>

202
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,200
The most successful science
fiction film up to that point
was <i>2001.</i>

203
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,920
And successful then was
that it made about $24 million
or something like that.

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,320
<i>Most hit science fiction films</i>
<i>would make about $16 million,</i>

205
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,680
<i>which was the </i>Planet of
the Apes <i>films and</i>
<i>that sort of thing.</i>

206
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,160
<i>But most science fiction films</i>
<i>would make under $10 million.</i>

207
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,040
<i>I mean, there was no reason</i>
<i>to think that it would do</i>
<i>any different.</i>

208
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,760
NARRATOR: Star Wars
<i>was more space fantasy</i>
<i>than science fiction,</i>

209
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,920
<i>but its galactic setting</i>
<i>made it a tough sell in 1973.</i>

210
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,160
LUCAS:<i> When I was pitching</i>
<i>the film, all I had was</i>
<i>a 14-page story treatment.</i>

211
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,160
It was very vague.
Said it was kind of a 1930s,

212
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,480
action adventure,
Saturday afternoon serial,

213
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,320
<i>based on the kind of</i>
Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers
<i>kind of comic book future.</i>

214
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
<i>And that's about all they</i>
<i>knew about it.</i>

215
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,280
In the '70s, science fiction
seemed to be

216
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,800
all about apocalyptic
societies and death
and destruction.

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,840
<i>Not very inspiring,</i>
<i>so we were fighting</i>
<i>an uphill battle</i>

218
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,560
<i>with a science</i>
<i>fiction project.</i>

219
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,040
NARRATOR: <i>George Lucas</i>
<i>brought </i>Star Wars <i>to</i>
<i>Universal and United Artists.</i>

220
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,000
<i>Both studios passed</i>
<i>on the project.</i>

221
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,600
<i>But the ambitious</i>
<i>young filmmaker</i>
<i>was secretly relieved.</i>

222
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,560
<i>The last thing he wanted was</i>
<i>to hand his dream project</i>
<i>to the wrong people.</i>

223
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,320
He didn't care
for the studio system.

224
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,000
He used it because there
was no other way of doing
what he needed to do.

225
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,880
NARRATOR: <i>Undaunted, Lucas</i>
<i>presented</i> Star Wars <i>to</i>
<i>Alan Ladd, Jr.,</i>

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,120
<i>the new head</i>
<i>of creative affairs</i>
<i>at 20th Century Fox.</i>

227
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,560
<i>Ladd, a former producer,</i>
<i>was able to recognize</i>
<i>potential in the filmmaker,</i>

228
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,800
<i>if not necessarily the film.</i>

229
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,280
ALAN LADD, JR.:
<i>We had a meeting,</i>
<i>and George said,</i>

230
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,160
<i>"Well, I've been</i>
<i>thinking about</i>
<i>this thing called </i>Star Wars."

231
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,960
And he told me about it.

232
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,640
And I said,
"That sounds terrific."

233
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,120
I mean, the technology part
of the whole thing

234
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,800
was completely over my head.

235
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,800
<i>But I just believed in him</i>
<i>and his genius.</i>

236
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,040
<i>I sort of recognized off of</i>
American Graffiti

237
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,000
<i>that he really was a genius,</i>
<i>so I just flew with it.</i>

238
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,160
He understood what talent was,
he respected talent and he was
able to say

239
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,240
<i>"I think this guy's</i>
<i>talented. I think we're</i>
<i>gonna invest in him."</i>

240
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,240
<i>So, Alan Ladd, Jr.</i>
<i>invested in me.</i>

241
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,280
He did not invest
in the movie.
And it paid off.

242
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,800
NARRATOR:<i> In 1973,</i>

243
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,760
<i>Ladd's investment</i>
<i>in George Lucas</i>
<i>proved justified.</i>

244
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,560
American Graffiti <i>was finally</i>
<i>released to rave reviews</i>

245
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,040
<i>and became the third highest</i>
<i>grossing picture</i>
<i>of the year.</i>

246
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,720
<i>It went on to earn more than</i>
<i>$100 million worldwide.</i>

247
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,880
<i>American Graffiti </i>showed
a very human center
and a huge heart

248
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
that George has always had,
by the way.

249
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,280
<i>And I think that surprised</i>
<i>a lot of people.</i>

250
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,360
NARRATOR: <i>With a preliminary</i>
<i>deal for </i>Star Wars
<i>in place,</i>

251
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,400
<i>Lucas began writing</i>
<i>his screenplay in 1974.</i>

252
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,560
<i>It proved more ambitious</i>
<i>than he had first imagined.</i>

253
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,880
<i>The filmmaker was able</i>
<i>to distill his idea down</i>
<i>to its essence</i>

254
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,040
<i>an epic battle between</i>
<i>a heroic Rebel Alliance</i>

255
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,840
<i>and an evil Galactic Empire.</i>

256
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,120
<i>The chief villain,</i>
<i>Darth Vader, was there</i>
<i>practically from the start.</i>

257
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,880
<i>But it took time</i>
<i>to come up with</i>
Star Wars's <i>three main heroes</i>

258
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,320
<i>a plucky young princess</i>
<i>named Leia Organa,</i>

259
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,800
<i>the fearless</i>
<i>Corellian smuggler</i>
<i>known as Han Solo,</i>

260
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,360
<i>and most important,</i>
<i>an idealistic farm boy,</i>

261
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,560
<i>whose original name</i>
<i>was Luke Starkiller.</i>

262
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,880
<i>Over the course</i>
<i>of his adventure,</i>

263
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,120
<i>Luke trains to become</i>
<i>a Jedi knight,</i>

264
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,040
<i>deriving his power</i>
<i>from a mystical energy</i>
<i>known as "the Force."</i>

265
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,960
<i>But along the way, the script</i>
<i>went through radical changes.</i>

266
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,120
<i>At one point,</i>
<i>Luke was a 60 year old general</i>

267
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,520
<i>and Han Solo had</i>
<i>green skin and gills.</i>

268
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,520
<i>Even the concept of the Force</i>
<i>had yet to be fully realized.</i>

269
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,760
<i>Instead, there was the</i>
<i>Kaiburr Crystal,</i>

270
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,400
<i>a sort of galactic Holy Grail.</i>

271
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,360
The concept of the Force
was an important one
in this story.

272
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,960
And the difficulty is

273
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,640
trying to create
a religious spiritual concept

274
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,160
<i>that works in</i>
<i>a very simple way</i>
<i>without heavy exposition</i>

275
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,200
<i>or without it seeming</i>
<i>to pull down the story.</i>

276
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,040
LUCAS: <i>It got to be</i>
<i>a very fat script,</i>
<i>about 200 pages.</i>

277
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,480
And the story
had gotten away
from me.

278
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,360
So, the only way
I could cope with it
was to say,

279
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,720
"I'll take the first third,
the first act, I'll make that
into a movie."

280
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,720
<i>But I'd written all this</i>
<i>other stuff. I'd spent</i>
<i>a year writing this story.</i>

281
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,840
And I said, "Well,
I'm not gonna just throw
away two thirds of my year

282
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,720
"and say, 'This is all I can
afford at this point.

283
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,160
"'This is the only amount of
money I'm gonna get is to do
this one movie.'"

284
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,840
<i>So, I put it on the shelf.</i>
<i>I said, "By hook or by crook,</i>

285
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,040
<i>"I will finish this movie."</i>

286
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,560
NARRATOR: <i>But </i>Star Wars
<i>wouldn't be cheap.</i>

287
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,480
<i>To get the Fox board of</i>
<i>directors to approve the</i>
<i>necessary budget,</i>

288
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,960
<i>Lucas needed</i>
<i>something dramatic.</i>

289
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,280
<i>He hired Ralph McQuarrie,</i>
<i>a conceptual design artist</i>

290
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,760
<i>who had worked for Boeing.</i>

291
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,400
LUCAS: <i>I'd seen some of his</i>
<i>paintings. I thought he</i>
<i>was brilliant.</i>

292
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,000
<i>I said, "Look. I want you to</i>
<i>do some paintings of</i>
<i>these scenes that I've done</i>

293
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,200
"so that the studio can get
a picture of what it is
I'm talking about."

294
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,720
<i>When I turned in the script,</i>

295
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,720
<i>I had about five</i>
<i>or six drawings</i>
<i>that I turned in with it also</i>

296
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,920
<i>to say, "This is what</i>
<i>it's gonna look like."</i>

297
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,640
He had a concept
for a big spectacular visual,

298
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,440
<i>and it didn't come across</i>
<i>in the script.</i>

299
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,120
<i>So I tried to give it scale,</i>

300
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,000
<i>juxtaposing the tiny</i>
<i>little figures</i>

301
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,840
<i>with the great</i>
<i>spectacular backgrounds.</i>

302
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,040
<i>George would say,</i>
<i>"Don't worry about how</i>
<i>we're going to do it.</i>

303
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,040
<i>"We just want to see</i>
<i>an impression</i>

304
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,880
<i>"of what the scenes</i>
<i>would look like</i>
<i>on the screen."</i>

305
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,680
NARRATOR: <i>McQuarrie's artwork</i>
<i>won over the Fox board</i>
<i>of directors,</i>

306
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,360
<i>who soon approved a budget</i>
<i>of just over $8 million.</i>

307
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,960
<i>With only the first part of</i>
<i>his </i>Star Wars <i>saga being made,</i>

308
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,280
<i>Lucas also needed to think</i>
<i>about the future.</i>

309
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,120
<i>But his prior dealings with</i>
<i>major studios had taught</i>
<i>him to be cautious.</i>

310
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,080
When I made
the deal for<i> Star Wars,</i>

311
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,760
originally I made the deal
before <i>American Graffiti</i>
had even come out.

312
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,960
'Cause Alan Lad
had seen the film,
<i>American Graffiti,</i>

313
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,320
he said he'd make a deal.

314
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,240
But he made a very, you know
"You're gonna make
'X' number of dollars"

315
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,600
and this kind of thing.

316
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,320
<i>And it was a very, like,</i>
<i>one-page memo.</i>

317
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,080
When it came up to doing
the contract for the film,
which is about a year later,

318
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,880
I knew that what I really
had to do was to protect

319
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,320
<i>the unwritten part,</i>
<i>the other two parts</i>
<i>of the script.</i>

320
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,840
LADD: <i>All of a sudden,</i>
Graffiti <i>comes out,</i>

321
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,000
<i>and it's a big huge,</i>
<i>smash success.</i>

322
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,320
So his agent came back
and said, "Hey, look.

323
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,960
"This guy has made
this huge successful
movie now.

324
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,720
<i>"Don't you think we should</i>
<i>get more than a couple</i>
<i>hundred thousand dollars</i>

325
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,560
<i>"for writing, directing,</i>
<i>and producing a movie?"</i>

326
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,760
<i>I said, "Yeah. I think</i>
<i>he should get more."</i>

327
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,800
I was very careful to say,
"I don't want more money,
more points.

328
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,480
"I don't want
anything financial.

329
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,560
"But I do want the right
to make these sequels."

330
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,960
<i>I was working</i>
<i>on the assumption,</i>
<i>as every filmmaker works on,</i>

331
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,200
<i>which is the film</i>
<i>would be a disaster</i>

332
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,760
<i>and that it wouldn't be</i>
<i>promoted and it'd just</i>
<i>die a horrible death.</i>

333
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,960
<i>And that it'd be very hard to</i>
<i>get these next two</i>
<i>movies made.</i>

334
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,840
George said, "I'd like a big
slice of the merchandising."

335
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,440
<i>Up until that time,</i>
<i>merchandising had been</i>
<i>relatively unknown.</i>

336
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,920
LUCAS: <i>When I took</i>
<i>over the licensing,</i>
<i>I simply said,</i>

337
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,040
<i>"I'm gonna be able to make</i>
<i>t-shirts, I'm gonna be</i>
<i>able to make posters</i>

338
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,720
<i>"and I'm gonna be able to</i>
<i>sell this movie, even though</i>
<i>the studio won't."</i>

339
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,640
So, I managed to get control
of pretty much everything
that was left over

340
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,160
that the studio
didn't really
care about.

341
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,880
George was
enormously farsighted,
and the studio wasn't,

342
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,120
because they didn't know
that the world was changing.

343
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,800
George did know
the world was changing.
I mean, he changed it.

344
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,720
NARRATOR: <i>With his</i>
Star Wars <i>contract completed,</i>

345
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,760
<i>George Lucas now needed</i>
<i>a rebel force</i>

346
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,440
<i>up to the challenge</i>
<i>of production.</i>

347
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,360
<i>In the summer of 1975,</i>

348
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,280
<i>he founded the visual effects</i>
<i>company Industrial</i>
<i>Light & Magic.</i>

349
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,040
LUCAS: <i>There were no</i>
<i>special effects companies</i>
<i>in those days.</i>

350
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,000
<i>The studio's special</i>
<i>effects department</i>
<i>had been disbanded.</i>

351
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,480
Part of that was
because of the expense,

352
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,440
and part of it was
that the American taste,

353
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,560
the culture had gone toward
very realistic looking films.

354
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,040
KURTZ: <i>We approached the</i>
<i>visual effects as a grand</i>
<i>experiment, saying,</i>

355
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,640
"Can we do this with a lot
of people who work on
architectural models

356
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,120
"and in commercials
and have never made
feature films before?"

357
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,200
RICHARD EDLUND:<i> We were</i>
<i>kind of like a weird kind</i>
<i>of fraternity</i>

358
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,680
<i>of robotic photography nuts</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

359
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,040
I mean, this was
a big movie for Fox.
We were doing commercials.

360
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,240
We all dreamed
about doing a feature,

361
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,240
<i>and this was like</i>
<i>the dream come true.</i>

362
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,200
<i>So, </i>Star Wars <i>came along</i>
<i>at just the perfect</i>
<i>time for us.</i>

363
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,640
STEVE GAWLEY:<i> We moved into</i>
<i>a big empty warehouse</i>
<i>in Van Nuys,</i>

364
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,400
right near the Van Nuys
Airport and basically
started from scratch.

365
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,680
I mean, it was empty.

366
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,360
<i>In the early days,</i>
<i>you used to park</i>
<i>your car inside.</i>

367
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,680
<i>There was no camera equipment,</i>
<i>no rooms to speak of.</i>

368
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,600
NARRATOR:
<i>Supervising at ILM</i>
<i>was John Dykstra,</i>

369
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,520
<i>an effects cameraman</i>
<i>who had worked under</i>
<i>Douglas Trumbull</i>

370
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,040
<i>on films like </i>Silent Running.

371
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,280
JOHN DYKSTRA: <i>I was</i>
<i>essentially to be</i>
<i>responsible</i>

372
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,320
<i>for doing the visual effects</i>
<i>for the film.</i>

373
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,760
We took the concept
of motion control, which is
essentially an old concept

374
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,360
of being able to duplicate
camera motion through
more than one pass

375
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,080
<i>so that you can generate</i>
<i>multiple elements of film</i>

376
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,320
and we made
it production savvy
by tying it into a computer,

377
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,960
<i>which was, at that point,</i>
<i>custom-built microprocessors.</i>

378
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,560
<i>There were no PCs.</i>
<i>You didn't go down</i>
<i>and buy a PC.</i>

379
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,200
<i>We built them from scratch.</i>

380
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,760
NARRATOR:<i> At the</i>
<i>same time the camera</i>
<i>system was being built,</i>

381
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,120
<i>another team</i>
<i>began constructing</i>
<i>model spaceships.</i>

382
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,720
PAUL HUSTON:<i> I was one of the</i>
<i>early hires. They had a small</i>
<i>art department.</i>

383
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,320
And there were some concept
models made out of cardboard

384
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,160
and model kit pieces.

385
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,880
<i>There were some storyboards</i>
<i>and some concept illustrations</i>

386
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,680
<i>that Joe Johnston had done.</i>

387
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,320
<i>There were some paintings</i>
<i>that Ralph McQuarrie had done.</i>

388
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,880
JOE JOHNSTON: <i>Everything came</i>
<i>either from my sketches</i>

389
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,360
<i>or Ralph's paintings</i>
<i>and drawings.</i>

390
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,320
And any input that George
might have, you know.

391
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,640
<i>There weren't a lot</i>
<i>of outside influences</i>
<i>on </i>Star Wars.

392
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,840
LORNE PETERSON:<i> George</i>
<i>wanted it to look like you</i>
<i>could actually see the rivets,</i>

393
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,800
<i>so you could see the logic</i>
<i>of how it was made.</i>

394
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,080
<i>I was originally hired</i>
<i>to work on the Death Star,</i>

395
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,120
the 40-foot by...
Oh, what was it?

396
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,160
Forty by 80 feet or 40 by 60
feet or something like that.

397
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,600
<i>Nobody wanted to do the job,</i>
<i>'cause you had to spend</i>
<i>a lot of time on your knees.</i>

398
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,280
DENNIS MUREN: <i>Everybody sort</i>
<i>of could cross-train</i>

399
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,680
<i>and work in different</i>
<i>techniques.</i>

400
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,640
That was different
than the Hollywood system

401
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,200
that had very strict
sort of union rules.

402
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,240
But there was no way
that this work could be
done that way,

403
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,280
<i>or no way that the Hollywood</i>
<i>unions could understand</i>
<i>what we were doing.</i>

404
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,280
NARRATOR: <i>With preproduction</i>
<i>gaining momentum,</i>

405
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,760
<i>Lucas next began the process</i>
<i>of casting his galactic opus.</i>

406
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,520
<i>He shared the audition stage</i>
<i>with his friend,</i>
<i>Brian De Palma,</i>

407
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,120
<i>who was seeking actors</i>
<i>for the Stephen King</i>
<i>shocker</i> Carrie.

408
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,400
LUCAS:<i> We were both making</i>
<i>these movies and casting</i>
<i>at the same time,</i>

409
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
<i>so we decided</i>
<i>to combine our efforts.</i>

410
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,000
I've made movies with
very young people that
have no track record,

411
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,040
so I have to kind of
go through and discover them,

412
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,800
pick them, and then test them
and go through them
and have readings.

413
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,680
So it takes a long time.
I spent probably six or seven
months casting <i>Star Wars.</i>

414
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,000
And that's a long process
to sit in a little room
and interview people.

415
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,520
And I interviewed
thousands of people.

416
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,320
NARRATOR: <i>In casting the male</i>
<i>leads, Luke Starkiller</i>
<i>and Han Solo,</i>

417
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,480
<i>Lucas looked for</i>
<i>individual screen presence</i>

418
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,920
<i>as well as chemistry</i>
<i>between performers.</i>

419
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,920
MAN: Okay, action.

420
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,600
Oh, it checks out again.
There's no mistake.

421
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,080
You can't find Organa Major?
I found it.

422
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,360
It's just not there.

423
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,040
Oh, I found it.
It's just not there.

424
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,240
What's left of it
is contaminated.

425
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,840
That's it there.
Look at those
radiation readouts.

426
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,480
It's impossible.
I've never seen
anything like it.

427
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,200
The Empire must
have gotten here first.

428
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,360
The planet has
been completely
blown away.

429
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,320
NARRATOR:<i> For the pivotal</i>
<i>role of Luke,</i>

430
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,160
<i>Lucas needed an actor who</i>
<i>could project both</i>
<i>intelligence and integrity.</i>

431
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,000
She's part
of the royal family.

432
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,320
They won't get
anything out of her.

433
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,920
She knows the power
of mind control.

434
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,640
She's part
of the royal family.

435
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,480
They won't get
any information
from her.

436
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,600
She knows the art
of mind control.

437
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,000
NARRATOR:
<i>Twenty-four year</i>
<i>old Mark Hamill</i>

438
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,920
<i>was a familiar face</i>
<i>on television.</i>

439
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,240
<i>A newcomer to films,</i>
<i>his wholesome, easy-going</i>
<i>manner fit the part perfectly.</i>

440
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,160
MARK HAMILL: <i>I can</i>
<i>remember a line from</i>
<i>the screen test,</i>

441
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,360
<i>which I don't think</i>
<i>ever will leave me.</i>

442
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,440
And Luke says, "But we can't
turn back. Fear is their
greatest defense.

443
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,120
"I doubt if the actual
security there

444
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,960
"is any greater than it was
on Aquilae or Sullust,

445
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,600
"and what there is is most
likely directed towards
a large scale assault."

446
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,040
Fear is their
greatest defense.

447
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,040
I doubt if the
actual security there

448
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,560
is much greater
than on Aquilae or Sullust,

449
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,920
and what there is is most
likely directed towards
a large scale assault.

450
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,720
I read that line
and I thought,
"Who talks like this?"

451
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,920
<i>So I just did it sincerely.</i>

452
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,720
How many more systems
have to get blown away

453
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,960
before you have
no place to hide
and are forced to fight?

454
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,600
Don't you realize
what's going on?

455
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
FORD: Kid, you take the glory
and the good intentions.

456
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,160
I'll take the reward.

457
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,760
NARRATOR: <i>The role of Han Solo</i>
<i>needed someone older</i>

458
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
<i>with a more cynical edge.</i>

459
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,720
What's that little droid
carrying that's so
blasted important?

460
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,960
What's the little
droid carrying
that's so important?

461
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,480
NARRATOR: <i>Harrison Ford had</i>
<i>worked with Lucas on</i>
American Graffiti.

462
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,760
<i>But because the director</i>
<i>initially only wanted</i>
<i>new faces,</i>

463
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,760
<i>he was not allowed</i>
<i>to audition.</i>

464
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,520
Wait. Do I have to sit up
to get in on the right?

465
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,480
<i>Instead, he was brought in</i>
<i>to feed lines to</i>
<i>the other actors.</i>

466
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,280
FORD:<i> I was given sides</i>
<i>and asked if I would help</i>
<i>read the other actors.</i>

467
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,000
It became my task to explain
to the other actors who
were coming along

468
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,520
just what it was that these
sides, uh,

469
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,080
were meant to be about.

470
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,560
They're gonna follow us.
They'll destroy your
hidden bases.

471
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,480
They'll destroy
the whole system.

472
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,040
Right, and they'll bring
the Death Star too.

473
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,480
NARRATOR: <i>Lucas may have</i>
<i>been reluctant to use</i>
<i>Ford at first,</i>

474
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,120
<i>but the actor won him over</i>
<i>by giving Han a mix</i>
<i>of mercenary swagger</i>

475
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,400
<i>and world-weariness.</i>

476
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,560
Well, what was so clear was
what the idea was of the
character relationships.

477
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,800
<i>Mark was the callow youth,</i>
<i>and I was the smartass,</i>

478
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,520
<i>and we each had</i>
<i>a clear section</i>
<i>of turf to explore.</i>

479
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,360
The planet's totally
blown away.

480
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,360
It would've taken
a thousand ships

481
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,880
with more firepower
than I've ever seen
to do that.

482
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,400
If the Empire had a new weapon
that could do this,
I'd know about it.

483
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,080
I'd have heard something.

484
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,240
MALE ACTOR:
Well, you know about it now.

485
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,040
The enemy's on the move.
We haven't much time.

486
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,880
I brought you here. Now what?

487
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,000
MALE ACTOR:
We've got to find the rebels.

488
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,440
What we're carrying
belongs to them.

489
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,440
Their bases are
very well hidden, son.

490
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,440
Do you... All the power
of the Empire can't find 'em.

491
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,080
Do you know where they are?

492
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,760
MALE ACTOR:
No. Not anymore.

493
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,160
Well, I'm not gonna take you
on an impossible chase
across the galaxy!

494
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
NARRATOR:<i> Virtually every</i>
<i>young actress in Hollywood</i>

495
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,120
<i>tried out for the part</i>
<i>of Princess Leia.</i>

496
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,160
<i>Although the character</i>
<i>was the same age as Luke,</i>

497
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,080
<i>as a leader of the rebellion,</i>
<i>Leia needed to project a</i>
<i>confidence beyond her years.</i>

498
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,080
The plans and specifications
to a battle station

499
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,400
with enough firepower
to destroy an entire system.

500
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,680
Our only hope in destroying it
is to find its weakness,

501
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,760
which we will determine
from the data I stored in R2.

502
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,160
Now, our only hope
in destroying it

503
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,120
is to find its weakness,

504
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,760
which we'll do
from the data
I stored in R2.

505
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,440
Okay? Now, we've captured
the plans in a raid on
the imperial shipyards.

506
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,440
But we fell under attack
before I could get
the data to safety,

507
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,040
so I hid it in R2
and sent him off.

508
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,480
When R2 has been safely
delivered to my forces,
you get your reward.

509
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,920
FORD: Wha...
You have my guarantee.

510
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,440
What's the little
droid carrying
that's so blasted important?

511
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,360
The plans and specifications

512
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,720
to a battle station
with enough firepower

513
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,520
to destroy an entire system.

514
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,120
NARRATOR:<i> One actress</i>
<i>in particular</i>

515
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,400
<i>seemed tailormade</i>
<i>to play a princess.</i>

516
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,160
<i>As the daughter of actress</i>
<i>Debbie Reynolds and</i>
<i>singer Eddie Fisher,</i>

517
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,920
<i>Carrie Fisher was the product</i>
<i>of Hollywood royalty.</i>

518
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,800
<i>She had no trouble conveying</i>
<i>the self-assurance needed</i>
<i>for Leia Organa.</i>

519
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,320
FISHER: <i>I met with</i>
<i>Brian De Palma and George,</i>

520
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,520
<i>and Brian did all the talking,</i>

521
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,840
<i>because George</i>
<i>didn't talk then.</i>

522
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,920
There were incredible
actresses that
were my age

523
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,320
that were being considered
for this role,

524
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,720
so I didn't think
I would get it.

525
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,440
But our only hope
is to destroy it before
it destroys us.

526
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,960
(SCOFFS)

527
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,200
Hiding is useless now.

528
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,280
With the Death Star,
they'll continue to go
on destroying systems

529
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,320
until they've found us.

530
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,360
We have no alternative
but to process the information

531
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,760
and use it
while there's still time.

532
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,720
FISHER:<i> I got it with the</i>
<i>proviso that I went</i>
<i>to a fat farm</i>

533
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,080
<i>and that I lose 10 pounds.</i>

534
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,360
I think they were hoping it
was gonna come out five
here and five here.

535
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,400
<i>My character was someone</i>

536
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,600
<i>who was feisty</i>
<i>and all of that,</i>

537
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,520
<i>but I felt myself to be a bit</i>
<i>of that too,</i>

538
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,800
so it would have been unlikely
that I would be cast as a
shrinking violet.

539
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,160
He cast us to type, in a way.

540
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,920
NARRATOR: <i>Lucas's decision</i>
<i>to hire unknowns</i>

541
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,880
<i>went against the</i>
<i>advice of his friend</i>
<i>Francis Ford Coppola,</i>

542
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,320
<i>who had cast </i>The Godfather
<i>with stage and screen stars.</i>

543
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,640
<i>20th Century Fox</i>
<i>was also concerned</i>

544
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,240
<i>about Lucas's choice</i>
<i>of actors.</i>

545
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,200
He came and said,
"These are the three unknown
people I want to go with."

546
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,280
I figured we've gone down this
far in the road, he knows what
he's doing.

547
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,840
<i>I'd be lying if I said,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Harrison's perfect,</i>

548
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,800
<i>"Carrie is perfect</i>
<i>and Mark is fantastic."</i>

549
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,240
No, I was very nervous
about the cast.

550
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,320
NARRATOR<i>: For the important</i>
<i>role of aged Jedi Master</i>
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

551
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,080
<i>Lucas recognized that</i>
<i>he needed an established star.</i>

552
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,440
<i>Sir Alec Guinness was</i>
<i>a veteran of over 40 films</i>

553
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,880
<i>and had won an Oscar in 1958</i>

554
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,960
<i>for his performance in</i>
The Bridge on the River Kwai.

555
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,800
<i>The knighted actor had</i>
<i>the pedigree and the persona.</i>

556
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,680
The Alec Guinness role

557
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,720
required a certain stability
and gravitas as a character,

558
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,280
which meant we needed
a very strong character
actor to play that part.

559
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,640
NARRATOR: <i>Signing Guinness</i>
<i>was a major coup.</i>

560
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,440
<i>But more casting would</i>
<i>be done in London,</i>

561
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,000
<i>where </i>Star Wars
<i>would be principally produced.</i>

562
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,120
<i>Unlike Lucas's home base</i>
<i>of Northern California,</i>

563
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,360
<i>London provided</i>
<i>access to the kind</i>
<i>of massive soundstages</i>

564
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,240
<i>needed for </i>Star Wars'
<i>ambitious sets.</i>

565
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,480
<i>The location also gave Lucas</i>
<i>access to Britain's top</i>
<i>production talents.</i>

566
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,640
<i>The character of Darth Vader</i>
<i>demanded someone of</i>
<i>commanding physical stature.</i>

567
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,920
<i>To fill Vader's boots,</i>

568
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,320
<i>Lucas cast</i>
<i>champion bodybuilder</i>
<i>David Prowse,</i>

569
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,920
<i>whose resume included roles</i>
<i>like Frankenstein's creature</i>

570
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,720
<i>in Hammer's popular</i>
<i>horror movies.</i>

571
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,760
<i>As Vader's evil accomplice</i>
<i>Governor Tarkin,</i>

572
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,640
<i>another Hammer</i>
<i>alumnus was cast,</i>
<i>63-year-old Peter Cushing.</i>

573
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
<i>Best known as the</i>
<i>methodical Professor Van</i>
<i>Helsing in </i>Dracula,

574
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,680
<i>Cushing was</i>
<i>the perfect choice</i>

575
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,440
<i>to portray the Death Star's</i>
<i>icy chief administrator.</i>

576
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,040
<i>For the part of</i>
<i>Chewbacca, Han Solo's</i>
<i>towering Wookiee co-pilot,</i>

577
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,240
<i>Lucas and Kurtz</i>
<i>had to look outside</i>
<i>normal casting channels.</i>

578
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,480
<i>But at seven feet,</i>
<i>three inches tall,</i>

579
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,840
<i>it was no stretch</i>
<i>for Peter Mayhew,</i>

580
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,440
<i>who had been working</i>
<i>as an orderly at</i>
<i>a Yorkshire hospital.</i>

581
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,040
I sat down
on one of the sofas

582
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,520
waiting for George.

583
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Door opened,

584
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,920
and George walked in
with Gary behind him.

585
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,240
So, naturally, what did I do?

586
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm raised in England.

587
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,880
Soon as someone
comes in through
the door, I stand up.

588
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,440
George goes, "Hmm."

589
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,960
Virtually turned
to Gary and said,

590
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
"I think we've found him."

591
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,160
NARRATOR: <i>Finding</i>
<i>the right performers</i>
<i>to portray robots</i>

592
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,360
<i>was even more of a challenge.</i>

593
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,840
<i>Production designers had</i>
<i>constructed an assortment</i>
<i>of robots and androids</i>

594
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,920
<i>to populate the </i>Star Wars
<i>universe.</i>
(ROBOT BEEPS)

595
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,040
<i>But it would take living,</i>
<i>breathing actors</i>
<i>to give personality</i>

596
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,640
<i>to the two main droids,</i>
<i>C3PO and R2D2.</i>

597
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,880
<i>To operate R2,</i>

598
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,560
<i>Lucas needed a performer</i>
<i>small in stature,</i>

599
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,800
<i>but with a big imagination.</i>

600
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,760
<i>Enter 3'5" stage comedian</i>
<i>Kenny Baker.</i>

601
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,560
KENNY BAKER:<i> They couldn't</i>
<i>find anyone that would</i>
<i>fit inside this robot</i>

602
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
<i>to make it move,</i>

603
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,240
and they couldn't use kids
'cause it was quite a heavy
machine, you know.

604
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,200
It weighed about 80 pounds.

605
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,440
<i>I'd had a lot of experience</i>
<i>inside costumes</i>

606
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,200
<i>and inside cats and dogs</i>
<i>and goodness knows what else.</i>

607
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,560
So when I got into
the robot, he said,
"Look happy."

608
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,400
So I'd go...

609
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Inside. Nobody could see
my expressions, obviously.

610
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,000
But it just... You have to do
something to get the
feel of the thing.

611
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,360
NARRATOR:
<i>Actor Anthony Daniels</i>

612
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,680
<i>not only had the slender build</i>
<i>needed for C3PO,</i>

613
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
<i>but training as a mime artist.</i>

614
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,240
ANTHONY DANIELS:
<i>He'd been seeing people</i>
<i>every five minutes.</i>

615
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,120
I was there for a while
and thinking, "Well, nearly
time to go, I guess."

616
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,120
And then, kind of
over George's shoulder,
I saw a painting,

617
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,080
<i>and the most extraordinary</i>
<i>thing happened.</i>

618
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,840
<i>It just struck me,</i>
<i>because I kind of looked</i>
<i>at this face,</i>

619
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,160
<i>and the face looked back</i>
<i>at me, and we had this</i>
<i>extraordinary eye contact.</i>

620
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,280
He's looking right out of
the picture, and he seemed
to be saying,

621
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,280
"Come. Come. Be with me."

622
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,280
And the vulnerability
in his face

623
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,080
made me want to help him.

624
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,440
<i>Isn't that weird?</i>
<i>He just looks</i>
<i>utterly vulnerable.</i>

625
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,640
<i>That painting completely</i>
<i>changed my attitude to</i>
<i>the whole project.</i>

626
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,080
Years later I was able to go
to Ralph McQuarrie and say,

627
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,720
"You realize this is
all your fault."
(LAUGHS)

628
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,480
NARRATOR: <i>In March 1976,</i>
<i>with casting completed,</i>

629
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,440
<i>George Lucas and company</i>
<i>arrived in North Africa.</i>

630
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,640
<i>It was a strange caravan</i>
<i>of British and</i>
<i>American filmmakers</i>

631
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,000
<i>working in a French-speaking</i>
<i>nation on a script few</i>
<i>people believed in.</i>

632
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,880
NORMAN REYNOLDS:<i> The</i>
<i>overriding thing for me,</i>
<i>really, at that stage was</i>

633
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,880
the amount of work
that we had to do,

634
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,120
the amount of stuff
there was to achieve,

635
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,680
<i>and we had grave doubts</i>
<i>about getting it done in time.</i>

636
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,960
NARRATOR:
<i>But the trial by fire</i>
<i>had yet to begin.</i>

637
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,600
<i>It was now up to Lucas</i>
<i>to make his movie.</i>

638
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,400
<i>Just one day into filming,</i>

639
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,720
<i>the Sahara was pelted with</i>
<i>its first major rainfall</i>
<i>in 50 years.</i>

640
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,080
ROBERT WATTS:<i> We were</i>
<i>going out there to shoot</i>
<i>on the salt flat.</i>

641
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,200
I came out in the morning
and the rain was going
horizontally down the street.

642
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,600
This way.

643
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,600
I thought, "My God".

644
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,600
I just called a rest day
on the crew, told them
all to go back to bed,

645
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,280
because there was no way
we were gonna shoot on that.

646
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,000
LUCAS:<i> The first two weeks of</i>
<i>shooting we'd run into a lot</i>
<i>of weather problems.</i>

647
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,120
<i>The sets had blown down,</i>
<i>I didn't get everything shot.</i>

648
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,880
It was a disaster.

649
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,120
At that point
I was pretty
depressed, saying,

650
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,240
"Boy, I've gotten myself in
way over my head.

651
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,880
"I don't know
what I'm gonna do."

652
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,720
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

653
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,360
NARRATOR: <i>With temperatures</i>
<i>topping 100 degrees</i>
<i>by mid-morning,</i>

654
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,840
<i>Tunisia was anything</i>
<i>but fun in the sun.</i>

655
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,200
WOMAN:<i> Luke! Luke!</i>

656
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,560
<i>Baking for hours</i>
<i>in heavy costume,</i>

657
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,440
<i>even the film's</i>
<i>stunt coordinator,</i>
<i>Peter Diamond,</i>

658
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,040
<i>found the conditions</i>
<i>physically exhausting.</i>

659
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,240
PETER DIAMOND:<i> I was the only</i>
<i>stunt person on the</i>
<i>picture in Tunisia.</i>

660
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,240
<i>I became a Tusken Raider,</i>
<i>or a Sandperson.</i>

661
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,560
I'm not a sun merchant.
I don't like the sun.
I just burn.

662
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,200
<i>So I just died</i>
<i>with the heat of it.</i>

663
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,480
<i>I couldn't stand it anymore,</i>
<i>it was so hot.</i>

664
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,560
<i>There were so many problems.</i>
<i>It just was not</i>
<i>a good location.</i>

665
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
We seem to be made to suffer.

666
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,200
It's our lot in life.

667
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,360
C3PO was finally

668
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,680
<i>put together for the very</i>
<i>first time</i>

669
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,160
<i>the day before</i>
<i>we started shooting.</i>

670
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,960
<i>R2D2 didn't really function</i>
<i>that well.</i>

671
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,240
<i>He could run along</i>
<i>in the three-legged position,</i>

672
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,280
<i>but he couldn't turn his head</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

673
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,960
BAKER:<i> There were</i>
<i>wires everywhere.</i>

674
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,840
<i>The head was on a track</i>
<i>of ball bearings.</i>

675
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,720
<i>I used to grab whatever</i>
<i>I could grab ahold of</i>

676
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,080
<i>and turn it that way</i>
<i>and that way.</i>

677
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,720
Not very far.

678
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,040
Because if I went too far the
wires would go around my neck.

679
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,840
<i>Then they'd say, "Cut!</i>
<i>All right, break for lunch."</i>

680
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,840
<i>And everybody'd just walk away</i>
<i>and leave me.</i>

681
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,600
<i>Then they'd remember</i>
<i>me eventually.</i>

682
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,800
That happened many times.

683
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,840
DANIELS:<i> It was bad enough</i>
<i>putting on the costume</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

684
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,200
<i>and within two paces</i>
<i>the left leg had</i>
<i>shattered down</i>

685
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,200
<i>onto the plastic</i>
<i>of the left foot</i>

686
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,080
<i>and was gently,</i>
<i>but forcibly and persistently,</i>

687
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,120
knifing it into the...

00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,200
The soft part of my foot.

689
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,000
<i>So we took it off and I limped</i>
<i>to the set with one foot.</i>

690
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,320
It was then I began to panic
about the days to come.

691
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,280
NARRATOR:<i> As the actors</i>
<i>and crew began to grumble</i>
<i>about the adverse conditions,</i>

692
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,040
<i>it was Sir Alec Guinness who</i>
<i>served as a role model</i>
<i>of professionalism.</i>

693
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,440
FORD: <i>It was, for me,</i>
<i>fascinating to watch</i>
<i>Alec Guinness.</i>

694
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,120
He was always prepared,
always professional,

695
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,320
always very kind
to the other actors.

696
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,160
<i>He had a very clear head</i>
<i>about how to serve the story.</i>

697
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,440
HAMILL: <i>He was the person</i>
<i>who sort of brought</i>
<i>it some legitimacy.</i>

698
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,720
<i>I asked him why he</i>
<i>wanted to do it.</i>

699
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,720
He loved the idea of playing
a mentor or a wizard

700
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,720
<i>in a morality play</i>

701
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,280
<i>where good and evil</i>
<i>are so clearly defined.</i>

702
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,320
MAN: Action!

703
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,320
How long have you had
these droids?
Three or four seasons.

704
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,960
They're up for sale
if you want them.

705
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,960
Let me see
your identification.

706
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,320
You don't need to see
his identification.

707
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,320
GUARD: I don't need to see
your identification.

708
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,920
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

709
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,960
GUARD:
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

710
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,600
He can go about
his business.

711
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,280
GUARD: You can go
about your business.

712
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,920
Move along.

713
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,600
NARRATOR:<i> Lucas, meanwhile,</i>

714
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,880
<i>was up to his neck in</i>
<i>malfunctioning props,</i>

715
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,000
<i>electronic breakdowns,</i>
<i>and other production woes.</i>

716
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,960
Star Wars <i>was already</i>
<i>struggling to stay</i>
<i>on schedule.</i>

717
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,080
<i>The only silver lining</i>
<i>was that after Tunisia</i>

718
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,160
<i>the production would be</i>
<i>moving to a more</i>
<i>controlled environment,</i>

719
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,560
<i>Elstree Studios</i>
<i>outside London.</i>

720
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,480
<i>The stages at Elstree</i>
<i>were among the largest</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

721
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,960
<i>and the sets,</i>
<i>now finished after</i>
<i>months of construction,</i>

722
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,640
<i>were just as impressive.</i>

723
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,840
<i>And for the first time,</i>
<i>the entire </i>Star Wars
<i>cast was together.</i>

724
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,320
HAMILL: <i>That was almost like</i>
<i>a whole separate movie.</i>

725
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,760
It was like
getting a whole,
fresh start.

726
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,680
It was all new, really.

727
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,560
FISHER: <i>We were all</i>
<i>very different ages.</i>

728
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,080
I was 19, Harrison was 33.

729
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,840
He was sort of
the big man on campus.

730
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,280
<i>Meeting him, you sort of felt,</i>
<i>"Well, he'll be a movie star."</i>

731
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,400
NARRATOR: <i>Costumes, makeup,</i>
<i>robots, and aliens</i>

732
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,280
<i>were all ready to go.</i>

733
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,640
MAYHEW:<i> I put that mask on</i>

734
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,840
and Chewie transformed me.

735
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,720
I transformed.
The attitude was different.

736
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,040
<i>The walk was different.</i>
<i>Chewie turned on.</i>

737
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,840
<i>Do the scenes, come back,</i>
<i>take the mask off,</i>

738
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,880
<i>Peter was back.</i>

739
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,560
MAN: Action.

740
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,320
That old man's mad.

741
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,520
You said it, Chewie.
Boy, where did you
dig up that old fossil?

742
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,760
Ben is a great man.
Yeah, great at getting
us into trouble.

743
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,920
I didn't hear you
give any ideas.

744
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,600
MAN: Okay, cut.

745
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,440
NARRATOR: <i>But working</i>
<i>at Elstree Studios</i>

746
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,320
<i>didn't mean the production</i>
<i>was free from problems</i>

747
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,680
<i>or strict British</i>
<i>union regulations.</i>

748
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,680
LUCAS:<i> At 5:30,</i>
<i>we had to stop,</i>

749
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,360
<i>unless we were</i>
<i>in the middle of a shot.</i>

750
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,040
Uh, I could ask the crew
for an extra 15 minutes,

751
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,360
<i>but they always voted me down.</i>

752
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,800
I'm not putting down
the British crew, but there
was an attitude like

753
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,000
"What is this?"

754
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,400
NARRATOR: <i>It didn't help</i>
<i>that most of the crew</i>
<i>thought</i> Star Wars

755
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,320
<i>was just a children's film.</i>

756
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,200
<i>At times even the actors</i>
<i>were hard-pressed to take</i>
<i>the work seriously.</i>

757
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,080
Didn't think it was
gonna be any good.
At least I didn't.

758
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,240
I thought,
"This is a bit strange."

759
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,520
<i>I can remember</i>
<i>this lighting man</i>

760
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,960
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"What is all this about?</i>
<i>It's a load of rubbish."</i>

761
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,800
And we all thought the
same at the time
"Yeah, it's a bit strange."

762
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,640
MAN: Action!

763
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,000
It was a princess
with her hair in
weird buns on the side

764
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,880
and a giant in
a monkey suit
or something.

765
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,480
I mean, it was weird.
It was very, very weird.

766
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,160
No more adventures!
I'm not getting involved!

767
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,160
Don't you call me
a mindless philosopher,

768
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,880
you overweight
glob of grease!

769
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,320
MAN: (SHOUTS) Bang!

770
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,160
I'm going to regret this.

771
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,720
FISHER:<i> It was tough</i>
<i>dialogue to say.</i>

772
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,520
So I think I got,
"Governor Tarkin,

773
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,920
"I thought I recognized
your foul stench."

774
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,600
Which, I don't know about you,
but I'm always talking
like that.

775
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,840
Governor Tarkin.

776
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,280
I should have expected
to find you holding
Vader's leash.

777
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,720
I recognized
your foul stench

778
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,000
when I was
brought on board.

779
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,920
Charming to the last.

780
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,320
We used to say,
"You can type this stuff,
but you can't say it."

781
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,240
KURTZ: <i>George didn't</i>
<i>really like being in London,</i>

782
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,640
<i>I suppose,</i>
<i>is the best way to say it.</i>

783
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
<i>He doesn't like</i>
<i>being away from home.</i>

784
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,360
<i>He's not the most gregarious</i>
<i>person in the world.</i>

785
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,600
<i>He had some clashes</i>
<i>with the cameraman.</i>

786
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,560
<i>Gil Taylor was a very</i>
<i>old-school cameraman,</i>
<i>very crotchety.</i>

787
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,240
George, coming out of
low-budget filmmaking

788
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,080
was used to
doing a lot of things himself.

789
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,520
<i>So George would</i>
<i>say things like,</i>
<i>"Well, put a light here."</i>

790
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,000
<i>And Gil took offense</i>
<i>at that kind of thing.</i>

791
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,840
He says, "That's not
your job, son."
(LAUGHS)

792
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,160
"You tell me what
you want to see,
and I'll do it

793
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,000
"the way I think is best
to create what you
want to see."

794
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,160
<i>It was a clash</i>
<i>of style of working.</i>

795
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,520
Slate 327, take four.

796
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,360
We're coming up
on Alderaan.

797
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,360
You know,
I did feel something.

798
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,840
I could almost see
the remote.
That's good.

799
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,640
You've taken your first step

800
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,360
into a larger world.

801
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,840
NARRATOR:
<i>Lucas also became frustrated</i>

802
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,840
<i>that the costumes, sets,</i>
<i>and other production elements</i>

803
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,600
<i>weren't living up</i>
<i>to his vision for </i>Star Wars.

804
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,040
<i>The compromises required</i>
<i>due to the film's budget</i>

805
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,320
<i>plagued him on an almost</i>
<i>daily basis.</i>

806
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,320
What was disappointing
would be the cantina sequence.

807
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,680
<i>It was really</i>
<i>imaginatively described,</i>

808
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,440
<i>and then you go in there</i>

809
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,800
<i>and it looks like</i>
The Nutcracker Suite.

810
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,440
<i>You know, there's a frog guy</i>
<i>and a mouse girl</i>

811
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,240
<i>and a giant cricket</i>
<i>at the bar.</i>

812
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,800
It was just...
It was really disappointing.

813
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,680
<i>But George says,</i>
<i>"Don't worry, don't worry.</i>
<i>We're gonna fix all of this."</i>

814
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,400
We didn't see anything
of what ended up
on the screen.

815
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,120
So when they
blew my planet up,

816
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,600
I was looking at a guy going
like this against a board
with a circle on it.

817
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,320
<i>I mean, it was funny.</i>

818
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,600
Proceed with
the operation.
You may fire when ready.

819
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
What?
Dantooine is too remote

820
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,920
to make an effective
demonstration.

821
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We will deal with
your rebel friends
soon enough.

822
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,240
No!

823
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,680
MAN: Bang!

824
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,400
LEIA: And you call
yourselves humans.

825
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,680
FISHER:<i> George never talked.</i>

826
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,840
<i>We felt he wanted us</i>
<i>to hit our marks</i>

827
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,480
and magically accommodate
our dialogue.

828
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,480
He lost his voice
at one point.
We didn't know that for days.

829
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,760
And we wanted to get him
a little board that said,
"Faster and more intense."

830
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,440
That was his main direction.

831
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,440
<i>He just wanted us</i>
<i>to speed through it.</i>

832
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,320
DANIELS: <i>George is notorious</i>
<i>for saying, after a take,</i>

833
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
<i>"Do it again. Faster,</i>
<i>more intensity."</i>

834
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,520
He certainly said to me,
"Terrific, Tony. Can you
do it again, faster?"

835
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,560
But I didn't get
"more intensity."

836
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,480
I didn't think 3PO with more
intensity would be bearable.
Do you? Hmm.

837
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,600
I said all systems
have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

838
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,560
The main entrance seems to be
the only way in or out.

839
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,880
We all had to fill in
a lot of the blanks.

840
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,160
It was more a matter of,
if we did something he
didn't like he'd tell us,

841
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,240
rather than telling us
what to do.

842
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,240
I think George
likes people.

843
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,720
I think George
is a warm-hearted person.

844
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,240
But he... Yeah, he's a little
impatient with the
process of acting,

845
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,000
of finding something,
you know.

846
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,960
He thinks it's there.

847
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,160
"It's right there.
I wrote it down."
You know?

848
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,040
"Do that." You know?
And sometimes you can't just
"do that" and make it work.

849
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,960
HAMILL:<i> He's really focused</i>
<i>on what he's trying to do</i>
<i>and get everything right.</i>

850
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,840
<i>Is the smoke right?</i>
<i>Did the squibs go off right?</i>

851
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,360
And we were just
taunting him mercilessly.

852
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,040
MAYHEW:<i> Carrie and Mark have</i>
<i>wicked sense of humors.</i>

853
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,240
<i>Carrie was very young,</i>

854
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,120
<i>and Mark was very young,</i>

855
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,320
so they were
the junior division,

856
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,280
and they were always
lurking about on set.

857
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,640
So it kept us in stitches.

858
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,400
FISHER: <i>I got one outfit</i>
<i>for the first movie,</i>

859
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,400
<i>and as George taught me,</i>

860
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,680
<i>there is no</i>
<i>underwear in space.</i>

861
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,120
Instead of that,
there is, um, gaffer tape.

862
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,880
So I was taped down.

863
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,280
And I used to say, we should
just make up a contest
on the call sheet

864
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,560
as to who's gonna rip it off.

865
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,840
But we didn't do that.

866
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,840
HAMILL: <i>We were all goofing</i>
<i>around and trying to make</i>
<i>George crack,</i>

867
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,880
<i>'cause he really looked like</i>
<i>he was ready to burst</i>
<i>into tears</i>

868
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,640
and you'd try
and cheer him up.

869
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,120
MAN: Go.

870
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,200
LUCAS: Okay, cut. Cut it.

871
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,680
FORD: And? And? And?
HAMILL: And? And?

872
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,440
MAN: Carrie
and Mark bumped in to, uh...

873
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,720
Oh!
Oh!

874
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,080
(CREW LAUGHING)
MAN: Uh, the mic was in frame.

875
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,680
The mic was in picture.

876
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,680
The mic was in picture!
FISHER: Oh!

877
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,920
The mic was in picture!

878
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,680
MAN: Back to first positions.
FISHER: Whoo!

879
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
The sound department
has to pay up.

880
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,760
HAMILL: <i>That, to him,</i>
<i>was really inappropriate</i>
<i>humor at the time,</i>

881
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,880
<i>because I'm sure he's in the</i>
<i>zone and seeing what he</i>
<i>wants to do</i>

882
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,800
and we're just actors
trying to stave off boredom

883
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,600
'cause we've been in
the trash compactor
all morning.

884
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,360
MAN: Ready? And action!

885
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,120
LEIA: What happened?
I don't know!

886
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,120
It just disappeared!

887
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,760
I got a really
bad feeling
about this.

888
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,680
But it is amazing what
you can do when you have
a vision, an ambition,

889
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,640
and when you can bend other
people's will to your desire.

890
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,640
<i>The thing that kept it focused</i>
<i>towards the ambitions</i>

891
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,800
<i>was George's vision</i>
<i>and his passion for the idea.</i>

892
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,320
NARRATOR: <i>Perhaps the most</i>
<i>memorable stunt in </i>Star Wars

893
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,840
<i>was actually performed</i>
<i>by Mark Hamill</i>
<i>and Carrie Fisher</i>

894
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,360
<i>the nick-of-time escape</i>
<i>of Luke and Leia</i>

895
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,040
<i>across a yawning chasm</i>
<i>in the Death Star.</i>

896
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,240
DIAMOND:<i> Mark Hamill</i>
<i>wanted to do as much</i>
<i>as he could himself.</i>

897
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,840
I had times when I had to keep
him back 'cause he was too
enthusiastic, actually.

898
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,080
He could've got hurt.

899
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,160
<i>Princess Leia</i>
<i>and Luke Skywalker</i>
<i>had to swing over this void.</i>

900
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,480
<i>We couldn't</i>
<i>afford stunt doubles,</i>
<i>so I said to George</i>

901
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,160
<i>"I can teach them to do this,</i>
<i>and it'll be quite safe."</i>

902
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,720
My buddy and I, we put the
harnesses on, we put
the wires on.

903
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,240
Everyone down below...
Remember, we are
about 20 meters up,

904
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,840
looking down on them, right?

905
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,440
And as we swang across,
there was a terrible tear,
and my buddy said to me,

906
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,480
"Peter, your harness
has snapped."

907
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,360
<i>Mark said,</i>
<i>"I'm not going in that.</i>
<i>It's too dangerous."</i>

908
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,560
<i>This is where I discovered</i>
<i>you had to be a good liar.</i>

909
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,600
<i>I said, "There's nothing wrong</i>
<i>with the harness.</i>

910
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,280
"I split my trousers
as I landed."

911
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,360
He said, "Oh, I thought
that was the harness."

912
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,560
I said, "Mark, I wouldn't
let you go on this
if it was dangerous."

913
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,320
MAN: Action!

914
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,680
They did it in one take,
and that's how we got it.

915
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,320
For luck.

916
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,440
That was really early on
in the shoot,

917
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,400
when I was still
worried about
my weight.

918
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,000
<i>I thought we were gonna miss</i>
<i>and I'd hit the wall</i>

919
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,040
and they would say,
"Ah, still too tubby.
Let's bring in Jodie Foster."

920
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,600
NARRATOR: <i>Another of</i>
<i>Peter Diamond's tasks</i>

921
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,400
<i>was choreographing</i>
<i>the dramatic</i>
<i>lightsaber battle</i>

922
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,440
<i>between Darth Vader</i>
<i>and Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

923
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,720
You can't win, Darth.

924
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,040
If my blade should find
its mark, you will
cease to exist.

925
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,960
But I warn you,
if you strike me down,

926
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,440
I shall become
more powerful than
you can possibly imagine.

927
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,240
DIAMOND:<i> George wanted</i>
<i>a broadsword type of fight</i>

928
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,360
<i>with a touch of Japanese</i>
<i>behind it.</i>

929
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,440
But instead of becoming
samurai moves with one hand,

930
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,200
I kept it with two hands,

931
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,760
so all the moves
were two hands,
completely like that.

932
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,680
<i>The first swords were</i>
<i>bits of wood</i>

933
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,440
<i>with front-projection material</i>
<i>wrapped around them.</i>

934
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,720
Now, the hardest thing for me
on the first fights

935
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,960
Darth Vader was
a very heavy man,

936
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,040
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>
<i>was a gentleman, right,</i>

937
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,440
<i>who had done some fencing</i>
<i>in the theater.</i>

938
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,280
I had to teach them,
if that was the sword,

939
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,840
to stop before they touched,
'cause the blades
were breaking.

940
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,880
We broke so many blades.
They just kept snapping.

941
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,480
MAN 1: Cut.
MAN 2: Cut it!

942
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,960

I mean,
every board
meeting I attended,

947
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,320
the subject was always
about <i>Star Wars.</i>

948
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,280
"Well, the costs are rising."
It's this, it's that.

949
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,600
<i>"Look, we've read drafts of</i>

<i>"in any way, shape or form."</i>

951
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,520
<i>It was rather unpleasant.</i>

HAMILL: <i>The things that stick</i>
<i>in my mind that made me</i>
<i>laugh were, like,</i>

953
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,520
<i>memos worried about whether</i>
<i>or not the Wookiee</i>
<i>should have pants.</i>

954
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,480
<i>They're looking</i>

<i>and saying,</i>

955
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,720
<i>"Couldn't he have</i>
<i>some lederhosen?"</i>

956
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,200
(CHUCKLING) And I thought,
"Isn't this great?

957
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,160
"You know, of all the things
to worry about.

958
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,200
"The Wookiee has no pants."

960
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,040
LUCAS:<i> I think we</i>
<i>were like two weeks</i>
<i>over schedule.</i>

961
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,640
<i>At that point,</i>
<i>the board of directors at Fox</i>

962
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,920
started to panic
and tell Alan Ladd, Jr.

963
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,760
that he had to shut
that film down regardless.

964
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,040
And so he came to me and said,

965
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,920
"Look, you've gotta finish

"and I can't go in there

968
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,240
KURTZ: <i>I kept going</i>
<i>on the phone to their</i>

"If we put on a second crew

00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,840
"is that the day deadline
is more important than
the money you spend."

974
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,000
NARRATOR: <i>The final</i>
<i>scenes were filmed</i>
<i>at breakneck speed,</i>

975
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,800
<i>with Lucas</i>
<i>frantically bicycling</i>

976
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,320
<i>from one soundstage</i>
<i>to another.</i>

977
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,360
WATTS:<i> Well,</i>
<i>I think George suffered</i>

978
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,880
<i>a lot more than I was aware of</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

979
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,080
<i>But I was very focused</i>
<i>on what I was doing,</i>

980
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,680
<i>'cause this was a very busy</i>
<i>movie, just nonstop</i>
<i>dawn to dusk.</i>

981
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,880
We did go over at the end,

982
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,680
and we split
into three units
right at the end.

983
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,280
Gary directed
the second unit,

984
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,960
and I had the distinction
of directing

985
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,400
the third unit of <i>Star Wars.</i>

986
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,000
<i>My shots were</i>
<i>things like a closeup</i>

987
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,680
<i>of R2D2's third foot</i>
<i>going down.</i>

988
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,600
(CHUCKLING)
<i>Nothing too dramatic.</i>

989
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,960
But that's
how we finished it.

990
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,560
Come on!

991
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,960
MAN: Okay, cut. Time up. Cut.

992
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,800
I hope that old man
got the tractor beam
out of commission,

993
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,840
or this is gonna
be a real short trip.
Okay. Hit it!

994
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,760
NARRATOR: <i>Fox originally</i>
<i>slated </i>Star Wars <i>for a</i>
<i>Christmas release in 1976.</i>

995
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,400
Schmuck.
463, take one.

996
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,600
NARRATOR:<i> But the difficult</i>
<i>shoot had put the film</i>
<i>severely behind schedule.</i>

997
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,600
MAN: Action!

998
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,000
Didn't we just leave
this party?
MAN: Give us a growl.

999
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,200
(INAUDIBLE)

1000
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,880
What kept you?
We ran into
some old friends.

1001
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,240
Is the ship all right?
Seems okay.

1002
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,080
If we can get to it.
I just hope
the old man

1003
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,200
got the tractor beam
out of commission.
Look!

1004
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,000
Now's our chance.
Go!

1005
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,280
NARRATOR:
<i>With barely six months to go,</i>

1006
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,040
<i>there was almost no</i>
<i>chance of delivering</i>
<i>the project on time.</i>

1007
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,360
MAN: Okay, cut! Cut it!

1008
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,480
I had just finished shooting
the movie, and I was
exhausted, basically,

1009
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,800
but I had to go right
from the shooting into
the finishing without a break.

1010
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,200
NARRATOR: <i>Already anxious</i>
<i>about meeting his deadline,</i>

1011
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,520
<i>Lucas was shocked when he saw</i>
<i>the first assembly</i>

1012
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,120
<i>of his edited film</i>
<i>that spring.</i>

1013
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,320
Sir, the groiters
are losing power!

1014
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,440
All right. I'll get it.

1015
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,200
NARRATOR: <i>The first cut</i>
<i>of</i> Star Wars <i>was</i>
<i>an unmitigated disaster.</i>

1016
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,800
How's that?
Yes, that's much better.

1017
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,600
LUCAS:<i> I'd started to see</i>
<i>things cut together.</i>
<i>I wasn't happy with it.</i>

1018
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,240
<i>I'd come in on weekends,</i>
<i>and I'd recut the film</i>
<i>on my own.</i>

1019
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,640
MAN: Cut it!

1020
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,720
And I tried
to get the editor
to cut it my way,

1021
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,200
and he didn't really want to,
and so I had to let
the editor go.

1022
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,880
So I had no editor.
I was behind schedule.

1023
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,640
I had to race
to finish the movie.

1024
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,560
MAN: 177, take two.

1025
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,160
NARRATOR: <i>Lucas realized</i>
<i>his only hope was to</i>
<i>start from scratch.</i>

1026
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,000
And I am C3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1027
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,920
And this is
my counterpart R2D2.

1028
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,320
Oh, hello.
MAN: Okay, cut.

1029
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,920
NARRATOR: <i>To recut the movie,</i>
<i>he hired Paul Hirsch and</i>
<i>Richard Chew,</i>

1030
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,520
<i>and for several months</i>
<i>he was able to borrow</i>
<i>his wife, Marcia,</i>

1031
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,520
<i>who was editing</i>
New York, New York
<i>with Martin Scorsese.</i>

1032
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,360
Slate 250, take seven.
MAN: Action.

1033
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,320
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

1034
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,240
(SIGHS)

1035
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,480
Right now
I don't feel too good.

1036
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,960
NARRATOR: <i>On </i>Star Wars,
<i>the trio's first task</i>

1037
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,800
<i>was to give the film an</i>
<i>energy and pace that was</i>
<i>sorely lacking.</i>

1038
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,880
MAN: Cut.

1039
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,800
It was cut in
a very traditional manner

1040
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,400
of just playing
things out in masters

1041
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,800
and then going into
the coverage

1042
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,000
<i>and letting</i>
<i>the actors' rhythms</i>
<i>dictate the cuts,</i>

1043
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,200
<i>rather than having the cuts</i>

1044
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,520
<i>kind of, uh, drive</i>
<i>the rhythm of the scenes.</i>

1045
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,080
211, take three.
Guide track.

1046
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,080
MAN: Action!

1047
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,720
RICHARD CHEW: <i>So,</i>
<i>consequently, there</i>
<i>wasn't any excitement</i>

1048
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,760
<i>in the footage the way</i>
<i>that it had been</i>
<i>put together.</i>

1049
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,480
MAN: Cut.

1050
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,320
Richard and I would
sort of leapfrog.
If he was on reel one,

1051
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,960
I would grab reel two,
and then whoever
finished that

1052
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,320
would grab reel three
and then so forth.

1053
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,360
Argh!

1054
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,600
PAUL HIRSCH:<i> We used shots</i>
<i>up until the very last frame.</i>

1055
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,920
MAN: Cut.
WOMAN: Can I take another one?

1056
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,800
Very often, the very next
frame would be the flash
of the camera stop.

1057
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,520
<i>For instance, there's a shot</i>
<i>of one of the Sandpeople</i>

1058
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,800
<i>who knocks Luke down,</i>
<i>and then he holds his</i>
<i>weapon up over his head.</i>

1059
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,440
He just did it once, and we
rocked it back and forth so he
did it a number of times.

1060
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,640
The only things that are there
is what's presentable,

1061
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,800
<i>and everything</i>
<i>behind the scenes</i>
<i>is a mess.</i>

1062
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,720
NARRATOR: <i>With no chance</i>
<i>of being ready by Christmas,</i>

1063
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,520
<i>a new release date</i>
<i>was set for summer, 1977.</i>

1064
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,240
<i>Some doubted that the movie</i>
<i>would ever reach theaters.</i>

1065
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,240
<i>But as bad as things</i>
<i>had been with the editing,</i>

1066
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,920
<i>the situation</i>
<i>at ILM was</i>
<i>even worse.</i>

1067
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,360
<i>The company was trying to</i>
<i>create effects that had</i>
<i>never been done before.</i>

1068
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,400
<i>They knew what they wanted</i>
<i>to accomplish,</i>

1069
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,280
<i>but they had yet to create</i>
<i>anything usable for the film.</i>

1070
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,320
LUCAS: <i>They had spent</i>
<i>half their budget,</i>

1071
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,840
<i>and ultimately</i>
<i>I had about four shots,</i>

1072
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,000
none of which I would accept,
they were just not good.

1073
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,600
That was pretty much
a low point.

1074
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,640
<i>I had no special effects.</i>

1075
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,840
<i>I didn't even know whether</i>
<i>we were gonna get</i>
<i>the ships to work.</i>

1076
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,880
<i>So it was a pretty</i>
<i>desperate time.</i>

1077
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,640
<i>And we'd spent half the</i>
<i>budget building the</i>
<i>motion-control cameras</i>

1078
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,000
<i>and setting the shop up.</i>

1079
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,080
It was a disaster, uh,
to say the least.

1080
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,560
HUSTON: <i>The factory</i>
<i>has to be built</i>

1081
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,960
<i>before the first can</i>
<i>of peas can be sent</i>
<i>to the supermarket.</i>

1082
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,160
<i>And I think it was</i>
<i>a year or more</i>

1083
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,920
without any film coming out,
without one shot
being finished.

1084
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,920
<i>'Cause they were</i>
<i>building optical printers,</i>

1085
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,080
<i>they were building cameras,</i>
<i>we were building models.</i>

1086
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,880
I know that George was
disappointed in the work,

1087
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,040
and I'm disappointed
that he was disappointed.

1088
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,640
<i>But there's a certain</i>
<i>subjectivity to some of</i>
<i>that stuff.</i>

1089
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,000
<i>I wish he'd been happier,</i>
<i>but I also think that,</i>
<i>ultimately,</i>

1090
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,560
<i>the work did the job.</i>

1091
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,280
NARRATOR: <i>When</i>
<i>word of the various</i>
<i>post-production problems</i>

1092
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,960
<i>reached the Fox</i>
<i>board of directors,</i>

1093
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,440
<i>they decided they'd had</i>
<i>enough of George Lucas</i>
<i>and "that science movie."</i>

1094
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,360
LADD:<i> I just sat in one</i>
<i>executive committee meeting</i>

1095
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,000
where they're hauling me
over the coals.

1096
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,520
I just said,
"It's the greatest
picture ever made."

1097
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,040
That ended the conversation.

1098
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,200
<i>They were afraid to say,</i>
<i>"Well, you're stupid</i>
<i>and you're wrong,</i>

1099
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,080
<i>"and we want you out</i>
<i>of this building by 5:00</i>
<i>this afternoon."</i>

1100
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,000
So, uh, there were
some tense moments there.

1101
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,840
NARRATOR: <i>With the dismal</i>
<i>early cut of the film,</i>

1102
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,240
<i>ILM in chaos,</i>
<i>and growing pressure</i>
<i>from the studio,</i>

1103
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,360
<i>Lucas was facing almost</i>
<i>unbearable battles</i>
<i>on a daily basis.</i>

1104
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,960
<i>After an especially</i>
<i>tense trip to ILM,</i>

1105
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,200
<i>Lucas felt sharp chest pains.</i>

1106
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,520
<i>Fearing a heart attack,</i>
<i>the director checked</i>
<i>into a Marin County hospital.</i>

1107
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,600
<i>He was diagnosed with</i>
<i>hypertension and exhaustion,</i>

1108
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,000
<i>and was warned</i>
<i>to reduce his stress level.</i>

1109
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,360
At that point,
I really felt that I'd, uh,

1110
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,720
gotten myself into
a real mess,

1111
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,720
and I didn't know whether
I was gonna get out.

1112
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,400
NARRATOR: <i>Lucas doubled</i>
<i>his efforts to save </i>Star Wars.

1113
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,800
<i>The situation at ILM</i>
<i>required drastic measures.</i>

1114
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,120
<i>To get the film's crucial</i>
<i>special effects back on track,</i>

1115
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,520
<i>Lucas had no choice</i>
<i>but to step in personally.</i>

1116
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,200
LUCAS:<i> We put a production</i>
<i>department in at the</i>
<i>special effects company,</i>

1117
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,800
I went down there
twice a week.

1118
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,120
KURTZ: <i>There was</i>
<i>a certain amount</i>
<i>of resentment at first</i>

1119
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,880
<i>because they felt that</i>

1120
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,520
they were being
challenged a bit
on how they had set it up.

1121
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,920
<i>We felt that there</i>
<i>was a certain</i>
<i>quasi-hippie mentality</i>

1122
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,560
<i>that some of them had</i>
<i>about the schedule.</i>

1123
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,880
Ultimately, I guess we were
known as a country club.

1124
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,840
I think it looked
to those guys
that there needed to be

1125
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,600
a really strong
production force in there

1126
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,960
that was going to meet
some sort of quota.

1127
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,360
NARRATOR:
<i>With hundreds of shots</i>
<i>left to be completed,</i>

1128
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,240
<i>ILM would have to do</i>
<i>a year's worth of work</i>
<i>in just six months.</i>

1129
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,240
<i>But Lucas and Kurtz</i>
<i>were determined to turn</i>
<i>the situation around.</i>

1130
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,680
EDLUND:<i> Gary was</i>
<i>a gearhead, so he could</i>
<i>understand our problems.</i>

1131
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,840
<i>And George is a storyteller,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

1132
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,960
and so we have to serve his
needs because he's the one
that's telling the story.

1133
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,840
But we had to build these
incredible contraptions
in order to do it.

1134
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,240
KEN RALSTON:
<i>George was our general.</i>

1135
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,040
We're his soldiers.
And we're all fighting
this single battle

1136
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,440
<i>to get this film out.</i>

1137
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,560
We were going
on the front lines here,

1138
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,640
and that gave us also kind of
a feeling of being special

1139
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,160
<i>and fighting this great</i>
<i>battle to get this thing</i>
<i>done, whatever it is.</i>

1140
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,600
NARRATOR: <i>To help inspire</i>
<i>the effects team at ILM,</i>

1141
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,560
<i>Lucas had spliced</i>
<i>together aerial dogfights</i>
<i>from old war movies.</i>

1142
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,360
That would be like the first
animatic, which you do
in the computer now,

1143
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,440
<i>and we matched frame to frame</i>
<i>and did the action on</i>
<i>that as close as we could.</i>

1144
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,400
Ha ha!

1145
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,480
RALSTON:<i> And it</i>
<i>was hugely helpful.</i>

1146
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,360
LUKE: I got him!
Great, kid!
Don't get cocky.

1147
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,720
To describe
that abstract world
of a battle is impossible.

1148
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,600
Storyboards don't do it,
as far as the pacing,

1149
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,440
<i>the rhythms that he needed.</i>

1150
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,240
Thanks, Wedge.

1151
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,320
That was a great thing.

1152
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:45,000
NARRATOR:<i> As fall</i>
<i>turned to winter,</i> Star Wars
<i>finally started to take shape.</i>

1153
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,280
That's it! We did it!

1154
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,520
We did it!

1155
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,440
NARRATOR: <i>Working from</i>
<i>the raw production tracks,</i>

1156
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,000
<i>sound designer Ben Burtt</i>

1157
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,240
<i>would add a critical</i>
<i>new layer to the film.</i>

1158
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,880
<i>Burtt had spent a year</i>
<i>building a catalog of sounds</i>

1159
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,080
<i>for things that didn't exist</i>
<i>in our galaxy.</i>

1160
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,880
(LASER BLASTING)

1161
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,560
George introduced the idea
of what he called an
"organic sound track."

1162
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,800
<i>George thought that Chewbacca</i>
<i>might be made up</i>

1163
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,880
<i>from recordings of dogs</i>
<i>or maybe even bears.</i>

1164
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:21,920
In addition, I recorded some
lions and tigers and even
some walruses.

1165
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,760
(GROWLING)

1166
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,360
I would begin
editing them together

1167
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,080
and making little phrases
out of the noises.

1168
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,200
I would take the recordings
and edit the best pieces.

1169
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,280
(ROARING)
Argh!

1170
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,600
You know, the bear might make
a sound that sounded angry.

1171
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,400
Grr!

1172
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,040
Or they might make
a sound that was cute

1173
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,040
(GROWLING)

1174
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,080
Argh.

1175
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,840
Or a sound that sounded like
a sentence, a "wah-wah-wah
kind of a sound.

1176
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,000
Argh, argh, argh!

1177
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,760
You said it, Chewie.

1178
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,600
The voice of R2 turned
out to be the most
difficult problem to solve

1179
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,560
in the sound design
of the first movie

1180
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,760
<i>because R2 had to act</i>
<i>alongside of the other actors.</i>

1181
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,080
<i>And the script only said</i>

1182
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,320
<i>that R2 made a sound,</i>
<i>or maybe R2 beeped.</i>

1183
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,960
I had a small electronic
synthesizer,

1184
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,280
<i>and I did some patches</i>
<i>with it and made up</i>
<i>some electronic sounds.</i>

1185
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,240
<i>But that didn't sound alive.</i>

1186
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,920
<i>At one point we talked</i>
<i>about R2's personality,</i>

1187
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,200
and we felt he was developing
kind of as a toddler.

1188
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,760
(BEEPING)

1189
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,000
<i>So I did a lot</i>
<i>of baby recordings,</i>

1190
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,560
<i>and eventually we found</i>
<i>that in the discussion</i>
<i>of R2's voice,</i>

1191
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,560
<i>we were making</i>
<i>the sounds ourselves.</i>

1192
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,400
(WHISTLES ROBOTICALLY)

1193
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,920
A few experiments led to the
combination of using my voice

1194
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,080
doing baby talk
beeps and "boops"...

1195
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,000
(BEEPS)

1196
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,840
...with the
electronic synthesizer.

1197
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,880
So, R2 is sort
of 50% machine
and 50% organic,

1198
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,160
<i>coming out of, you know,</i>
<i>the performance of a person.</i>

1199
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,440
<i>The breathing for Vader</i>
<i>was recorded</i>

1200
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,600
<i>by putting a little</i>
<i>tiny microphone down inside</i>

1201
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,320
<i>a regulator on a scuba tank.</i>
(BREATHING MECHANICALLY)

1202
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,200
I breathed through the mask
itself, and it breathed
in and out,

1203
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,760
and out of that came the
various, you know, paces of
Vader breathing.

(BREATHING MECHANICALLY)

1205

<i>And that sound worked out</i>
<i>pretty successfully.</i>

NARRATOR: <i>Finding the right</i>
<i>voice for Darth Vader</i>

1207
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,880
<i>was another challenge.</i>

1221

It was hilarious

at the same time,

'cause we didn't know
what Darth sounded like.

1223

That was the first time
we heard him. We were like,
"Is that it?

"Is he gonna be some

NARRATOR: <i>Prowse's voice</i>

1228
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,360
JAMES EARL JONES:
<i>George had hired David Prowse,</i>

1229
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,760
but he said he wanted
a so-called "darker" voice.

1230
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:28,440
Not in terms of ethnic,
but in terms of timbre.

1231
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,920
And the rumor is that
he thought of Orson Welles,

1232
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,440
and then probably thought
that Orson might be
too recognizable.

1233
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,680
So what he ends up
is picking a voice that
was born in Mississippi,

1234
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,120
raised in Michigan,
and was a stutterer.

with this voice, um,

1251
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,400
of an over-the-top
British butler.

1252
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,960
Um, British because
that would be my natural
mode of thinking.

1253
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,560
A butler because that was
his role in life.

1254
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,560
Nervous because that
was his feeling in life.

1255
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,720
And it came as, "C3PO,
human-cyborg relations."

1256
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,200
This is my counterpart R2D2.

1257
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,880
Hello.

1258
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:44,960
(BEEPS THREE TIMES)

1259
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,960
A few people
were brought in to record,

1260
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,760
and an attempt was made
to see how 3PO would be

1261
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,760
with different
kinds of voices.

1262
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,480
I believe 30 actors came in
and some really quite
impressive names.

1263
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,120
Stan Freberg
and a few others
were auditioned.

1264
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,440
Apparently, one of them
was a major cartoon actor,

1265
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,520
a man of literally
a thousand voices,
who eventually said,

1266
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,040
"You know something,
George, Tony's voice is
pretty good for the character.

1267
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,040
"Why don't you
just use his voice?"

1268
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,040
And eventually the discussion
just quieted down,

1269
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,200
<i>and it was</i>
<i>an excellent performance.</i>

1270
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,440
<i>It synchronized with</i>
<i>his body motions.</i>

1271
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,840
<i>It was a total character</i>
<i>which he created.</i>

1272
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,840
<i>His track was</i>
<i>left in the movie.</i>

1273
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,800
Hey! We don't serve
their kind here.

1274
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,040
What?

1275
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,200
Your droids,
they'll have to
wait outside.

1276
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,320
We don't want them here.

1277
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,760
Why don't you wait
out by the speeder?
We don't want any trouble.

1278
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,040
I heartily agree
with you, sir.

1279
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,680
428, take seven. Action!

1280
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,800
Here we go.
Cutting the
sublight engines.

1281
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,720
What the...

1282

NARRATOR: <i>At long last,</i>
<i>the editing, sound,</i>

1283
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,720
<i>and visual effects</i>
<i>were taking shape.</i>

1284
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:59,040
<i>But a private screening of</i>
<i>the film for Lucas's</i>
<i>closest friends</i>

1285
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,040
<i>didn't do much</i>
<i>to bolster his confidence.</i>

1286
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,120
No!

1287
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,480
It was an early stage.

1288
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,320
You know, sort of
a second or third cut.

1289
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,840
<i>I had a couple of my friends</i>
<i>come up to see it.</i>

1290
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,000
<i>Brian De Palma was in town.</i>
<i>Steven came.</i>

1291
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,440
<i>Some other friends</i>
<i>came to see it.</i>

1292
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,760
SPIELBERG:<i> The human</i>
<i>characters and the sets</i>
<i>were there,</i>

1293
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,520
but, of course,
all the spectacular...

1294
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,680
You know,
the Death Star fight

1295
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,200
and the battle
inside the trench,

1296
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,040
and all that was just, um,
not even there to be seen.

1297
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,920
So, the reaction
was not a good one.
I loved the movie.

1298
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,560
I was probably one of the only
people in the audience that
liked the movie.

1299
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,840
LUCAS:<i> All my friends were</i>
<i>very honest. "I don't get it.</i>
<i>What are you doing here?"</i>

1300
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,120
So that was basically
the tenor of the whole thing.

1301
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,040
On the other hand,
the studio,

1302
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,560
when Laddie and his
little group saw the film,
they loved it.

1303
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,400
It was the first time
I've actually shown
a film, um,

1304
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,080
and one of the executives
even cried at the screening.

1305
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,840
<i>It was, like,</i>
<i>very emotional for him.</i>

1306
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,600
WIGAN:<i> I sat my family round</i>
<i>the kitchen table in my house,</i>

1307
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,760
and I said, "The most
extraordinary day of my
life has just taken place.

1308
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,400
"I want you to
remember this day.

1309
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:12,800
"Because this is what I never
dreamed or maybe I dreamed

1310
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,440
"but I never thought I would
have a day's experience

1311
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,960
"like the day I've had today
in seeing this film."

1312
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,720
You know, I couldn't even
believe it, 'cause I'm used
to studios...

1313
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,520
At that point I was used to
studio chiefs saying,
"This is terrible.

1314
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,080
"You shouldn't show this
to an audience. Embarrassing."

1315
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,360
<i>So, for me it was</i>
<i>a very rewarding thing</i>

1316
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,720
<i>to show it to people,</i>
<i>even though it was</i>
<i>in bad shape.</i>

1317
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,840
NARRATOR:<i> It didn't help that</i>
<i>one critical element in</i>
Star Wars <i>was still missing.</i>

1318
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,760
There's no lock.

<i>The musical score.</i>

them for a while.

Quick! We've got
to get across.

blasted it.

1324

They're coming
through!

1325
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,160
I remember bugging
George, like,

1326
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,280
"When can we hear the score?
When can we hear the score?"

1327

NARRATOR:<i> Fortunately,</i>

01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:02,080
<i>one of the industry's most</i>
<i>accomplished composers,</i>
<i>John Williams.</i>

<i>talking about the fact</i>

1334
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,760
<i>that what we were</i>

<i>in the film</i>

represents worlds
that we hadn't seen,

give us some kind of
an emotional anchor.

<i>That was critical, we felt.</i>

1392
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,760
<i>Science fiction fans were</i>

<i>regardless of its popularity</i>
<i>with any other audience.</i>

1394

<i>key target audience</i>
<i>to start with.</i>

1395
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,320
NARRATOR: <i>Aside</i>
<i>from licensing posters</i>
<i>and t-shirts,</i>

1396
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,440

<i>Fortunately, Charles</i>

<i>with Stan Lee</i>
<i>and Marvel Comics.</i>

WIGAN: <i>Nobody wanted</i>

<i>summer of 1977,</i>

1409
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,960
Fox released a film called
<i>The Other Side of Midnight,</i>

1410
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,880
which was based
on an enormously
successful best-seller.

1411
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,080
<i>It wasn't a very good film,</i>
<i>but it was a very, very</i>
<i>much-expected book.</i>

1412
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,400
<i>And in order to exhibit</i>
The Other Side of Midnight,

1413
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,600
<i>you had to exhibit</i>

<i>(STAR WARS</i> THEME

1427
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,480
Opening shot was one of the
most important shots in the
movie for the visual effects.

1428
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,760
Because if the audience bought
that shot, you had them.

sort of depression of the '70s

too early, and it's
<i>Buck Rogers.</i>

You bring it out too late,

and it doesn't fit
our imagination.

1494

<i>that </i>Star Wars <i>had laid down.</i>

<i>People would say,</i>
<i>"May the Force be with you."</i>

It was a kind of code, almost,

1503
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,480
that proved that you were
one of the people who
had seen the film

01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,800
and you were connecting with
other people who had
seen the film.

1505
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,800
Star Wars <i>became like</i>

NARRATOR: <i>In the wake of</i>

"Great. Terrific.
Now I can go

About a month after it was
released, I said,
"Okay, it's a hit.

<i>who wanted nothing to do</i>

A bunch of the guys at that
point ran out and bought
a bunch of stock in Fox.

1521
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,360
I wasn't smart enough.

1522
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,800
The greatest profit

1523
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,200
that 20th Century Fox
had ever made in a single year

1524
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,160
was $37 million.

1525
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,960
And in 19-whatever that year
'77, '78,

1526
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:26,880
whatever that year was, they
made a profit of $79 million.

1527
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,120
That was <i>Star Wars.</i>

<i>The cultural impact of</i>
<i>Lucas's outer space story</i>

1529

<i>At the 1978 Academy Awards,</i>

Star Wars <i>earned an impressive</i>
<i>10 Oscar nominations</i>

01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,560
It was great. It was like a
dream come true. It's the
American dream.

1616
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,800
I wound up winning the Academy

<i>for best picture,</i>

1620
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,920
<i>its nomination was quite</i>
<i>an achievement</i>
<i>for George Lucas</i>

1621
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
<i>and his kids movie.</i>

1622

<i>In addition to</i>
<i>industry acclaim,</i>

1623
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,240
Star Wars <i>earned more money</i>
<i>than any movie in history.</i>

1624

<i>After years of fighting</i>

1625
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,320
<i>Lucas could finally</i>

1626
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,880
<i>When Fox approached</i>
<i>him about doing</i>
<i>the inevitable sequel,</i>

1627
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,360
<i>it was the moment</i>
<i>the filmmaker had</i>
<i>long been waiting for.</i>

1628
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,400
LUCAS: <i>This was</i>
<i>the perfect opportunity</i>

1629
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,400
<i>to become independent</i>
<i>of the Hollywood system.</i>

1630
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,880
I didn't mind releasing it
through them.

1631
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,000
But it was really
going to them for the
money and them saying,

1632
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,200
"I like the script,
but I want a change,"

1633
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,680
or, "The film is good, but we
want to make these changes."

1634
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,920
That's the part
I wanted to avoid.

1635
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,440
<i>I decided I was gonna</i>
<i>finance the film myself,</i>

1636

<i>that I was gonna make it</i>
<i>completely independently.</i>

1637
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,840
The rule in Hollywood
is never put your own
money in any film.

1638
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,560
Even your own film.

1639
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,520
<i>But George was self-financing</i>
The Empire Strikes Back,

1640
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,880
<i>but he was doing it through</i>
<i>the bank, and we were</i>
<i>talking about</i>

1641

<i>close to a $30 million film</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

1642

<i>But, because</i>
<i>of the huge success</i>
<i>of the first picture</i>

1643
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,600
<i>and of the revenues</i>
<i>that were still rolling in,</i>

1644
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,120
<i>merchandising was</i>
<i>very strong</i>

1645
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:37,080
<i>It was a gamble,</i>
<i>but a gamble</i>
<i>that he knew would pay off.</i>

1646
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,160
NARRATOR: <i>With his earnings</i>
<i>from </i>Star Wars,

1647
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,480
<i>Lucas was able to secure</i>
<i>a bank loan for</i> The
Empire Strikes Back.

1648
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,800
Empire's <i>original budget was</i>
<i>$25 million,</i>

<i>more than twice that of the</i>
<i>first film.</i>

1650
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,520
We would meet at Medway,
which was George's
San Francisco office,

1651
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,480
<i>and look at the illustrations</i>

<i>while George was</i>
<i>writing the script.</i>

1653

<i>And Gary Kurtz would</i>
<i>fly in occasionally</i>

<i>from London,</i>

1655
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,200
<i>and Ralph McQuarrie</i>

<i>much of the </i>Star Wars <i>cast.</i>

1659
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,040
<i>It would also move the story</i>
<i>in new directions,</i>

1660
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,000
<i>digging more deeply</i>
<i>into the emotions</i>
<i>of the characters.</i>

1661
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:35,640
George had been given
enormous license by the
success of <i>Star Wars.</i>

1662
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,760
And so when he started
talking to me about

1663
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,160
the <i>Empire </i>script that
didn't exist,

1664
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,560
he knew what had
to happen in the story,

1665
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,080
and it was very dark stuff.

1666
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,880
<i>I was delighted</i>

1667
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,000
<i>that it was not gonna be</i>
<i>a rehash of </i>Star Wars.

1668
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,440
<i>But, in fact, after having</i>
<i>set the whole thing up</i>

1669
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,160
<i>and gotten a rousing start,</i>

1670
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,880
<i>you launch into the second</i>
<i>act in which everything</i>
<i>goes to hell.</i>

1671
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:02,920
<i>And that's usually</i>
<i>the best act in a play.</i>

1672
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,680
NARRATOR: Empire <i>would also</i>
<i>open the door</i>

1673
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,000
<i>to a romance between</i>
<i>Han Solo and Princess Leia.</i>

1674
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,840
<i>But this time, George Lucas</i>
<i>wasn't getting in the</i>
<i>director's chair.</i>

1675
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,320
It was just too hard
to set up a company,

1676
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,280
get the money,
get the film made,

1677
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:24,320
and also be down there
on the set every day
trying to direct it.

1678
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,800
So I decided I'd hire
a director.

1679
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,960
KERSHNER: <i>I was asked by</i>
<i>George to come</i>
<i>to lunch at Universal.</i>

1680
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:36,240
And he said, "How would
you like to do the second
<i>Star Wars?</i>"

1681
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,960
We had no title for it
at that point.

1682
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,760
And I said, "Gee, George,
I don't think so."

1683
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,880
<i>It's a phenomenal</i>
<i>hit as a picture.</i>

1684
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:52,440
<i>A second one can</i>
<i>only be a second one.</i>

1685
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,800
<i>It can't be as good</i>

1686
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,320
<i>because the first one</i>
<i>is the breakthrough.</i>

1687
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,800
<i>And I told my agent</i>
<i>about the meeting,</i>

1688
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,280
<i>and he said,</i>
<i>"Are you crazy?</i>
<i>Do it!"</i>

1689
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:11,120
There were approximately
64 sets on this picture,

1690
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,720
which is much bigger than
<i>Star Wars.</i>

1691
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:18,240
<i>George says,</i>
<i>"The film has</i>
<i>to be much better</i>

1692
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:22,680
<i>"and much bigger, and</i>
<i>much more complex</i>
<i>than </i>Star Wars.

1693
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,840
<i>"Because if the second one</i>
<i>doesn't work,</i>

1694
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,200
<i>"it's the end of </i>Star Wars.

1695
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,280
<i>"If it does work,</i>

1696
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,520
<i>"then I can continue</i>
<i>making more of them."</i>

1697
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,880
<i>I said, "It doesn't put</i>
<i>me in a very</i>
<i>comfortable position.</i>

1698
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,080
<i>"It's a hell of a</i>
<i>responsibility."</i>

1699
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,240
NARRATOR: <i>Known for smaller,</i>
<i>character-driven films</i>

1700
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,840
<i>like </i>Up the Sandbox
<i>and </i>Eyes of Laura Mars,

1701
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:55,280
<i>Irvin Kershner had never</i>
<i>directed a blockbuster.</i>

1702
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,520
<i>But emphasis on character was</i>
<i>just what this middle</i>
<i>chapter needed.</i>

1703
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,320
KERSHNER: <i>The storyline</i>
<i>was much more difficult.</i>

1704
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:07,720
I felt I needed
humor in the picture.

1705
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,160
And yet, I couldn't have gags.

1706
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,360
I felt I needed a love story,

1707
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,800
and yet I couldn't have
a lot of smooching,

1708
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,160
and kissing,
and all that stuff.

1709
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:23,120
And it had to
all be more implied.

1710
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,920
<i>I knew I needed something</i>
<i>powerful going on</i>

1711
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,320
<i>inside Luke's soul.</i>

1712
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,800
<i>And he really carries the</i>
<i>picture, of course.</i>

1713
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,000
<i>So I didn't know quite</i>
<i>how I was gonna do this.</i>

1714
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:44,560
NARRATOR: <i>In the year since</i>
<i>the release of the first</i>
Star Wars,

1715
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,680
<i>now dubbed </i>Episode IV: A
New Hope,

1716
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,240
<i>ILM had come a long way.</i>

1717
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,800
<i>The company was no longer</i>
<i>a fledgling operation</i>

1718
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,960
<i>struggling to get by.</i>

1719
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,760
JOHNSTON:<i> At the end of</i>
Star Wars,

1720
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,760
<i>George invited the core group</i>
<i>to Northern California</i>

1721
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,680
<i>to start this</i>
<i>whole new facility.</i>

1722
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,240
<i>There were 10 of us, and I</i>
<i>was the only one that</i>
<i>immediately came up.</i>

1723
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,960
I said, "Are you kidding?
Stay here in Van Nuys

1724
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,360
"in this crummy part of town

1725
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,440
"in this dumpy building,
you know,

1726
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,120
"that was inadequate
from the very beginning,

1727
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,520
<i>"or move to Marin County,</i>

1728
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,760
<i>"have a new building and have</i>
<i>a new film to work on...</i>

1729
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,560
<i>"in this great environment?"</i>

1730
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,800
<i>It was like a no-brainer.</i>

1731
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,680
I remember George saying,
"This time we got some money."

1732
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,680
And so that
was kind of nice.

1733
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,360
<i>We talked about,</i>
<i>"Should we top ourselves?"</i>

1734
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,520
<i>or "Are we gonna</i>
<i>top ourselves?"</i>

1735
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,280
<i>And I think it was more of,</i>

1736
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,200
<i>"Let's just make it look cool.</i>
<i>Have some fun with it."</i>

1737
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:44,720
<i>And George came up with</i>
<i>some great story stuff.</i>

1738
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,720
PETERSON:
<i>We started on the walker,</i>

1739
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,120
but we also had to
build the robot,

1740
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:52,880
which is the probe
that is sent down
by Darth Vader

1741
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,240
that lands on
the snow planet's surface

1742
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,800
that then goes and looks
for human lifeforms.

1743
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,880
<i>Joe had already</i>
<i>drawn the drawings.</i>
<i>George liked that.</i>

1744
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:05,120
<i>But they were going</i>
<i>to go to Norway to shoot</i>
<i>all those scenes,</i>

1745
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,000
<i>and they needed a prop.</i>

1746
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,880
<i>They needed one that was,</i>
<i>like, nine feet tall or</i>
<i>something like that</i>

1747
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,520
<i>in scale to have</i>
<i>out in the distance.</i>

1748
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,720
KURTZ: <i>The making of </i>Empire
<i>was a whole set of problems</i>

1749
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,200
<i>that we didn't anticipate.</i>

1750
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:34,400
The picture was a much
bigger undertaking
than originally conceived.

1751
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,360
<i>The budget was</i>
<i>quite a bit more.</i>

1752
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,960
<i>Everybody who's dealt with</i>
<i>visual effects said,</i>
<i>"Never do snow,</i>

1753
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,200
<i>"because you can't maintain</i>
<i>the color."</i>

1754
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,240
<i>We ignored all those warnings</i>
<i>and decided to shoot in</i>
<i>the snow anyway.</i>

1755
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,160
<i>But it was a very</i>
<i>time-consuming process.</i>

1756
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:52,680
<i>And, again,</i>
<i>just like in Tunisia,</i>

1757
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,400
<i>we were in Norway</i>
<i>shooting on this glacier,</i>

1758
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,920
<i>and we had the worst</i>
<i>winter in Scandinavia</i>

1759
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,400
<i>that they'd had in 50 years</i>

1760
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,840
<i>twenty below zero,</i>
<i>18 feet of snow.</i>

1761
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,760
(WIND HOWLING)

1762
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,560
WATTS:<i> It was</i>
<i>a miserable location,</i>

1763
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,120
<i>'cause we were across</i>
<i>this frozen thing up</i>
<i>on this glacier</i>

1764
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,400
<i>with these tracked vehicles</i>
<i>to get there.</i>

1765
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:17,200
<i>We had sort of like stakes</i>
<i>like big twigs, almost in</i>
<i>the ground</i>

1766
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,000
about every six feet.

1767
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,560
Because if it started snowing,
you get a whiteout.

1768
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,040
You can't tell
where you're going.

1769
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:26,560
<i>And it did one night.</i>
<i>I drove one of</i>
<i>the tracked vehicles.</i>

1770
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,960
<i>And without these,</i>
<i>I never would've</i>
<i>found my way back.</i>

1771
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,120
KERSHNER:<i> We get to Norway,</i>

1772
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:37,200
and I couldn't get out
of the hotel to shoot

1773
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,280
because there was
a wall of snow

1774
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,400
<i>that was blown in that night.</i>

1775
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,240
So we put the camera in the
doorway of the hotel,

1776
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,240
going out the back door.

1777
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,480
The crew was all inside,
toasty warm,

1778
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:55,520
<i>and Mark had to go out</i>
<i>into the snow</i>

1779
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,560
<i>and go running away</i>
<i>from the ice creature.</i>

1780
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:00,960
<i>And we never left the doorway!</i>
(LAUGHING)

1781
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,080
<i>And he froze to death,</i>
<i>and we were fine.</i>

1782
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:08,120
<i>We finally shot all the scenes</i>

1783
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,280
<i>knowing where</i>
<i>the special effects</i>

1784
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,280
<i>where this thing</i>
<i>would come down,</i>

1785
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,080
<i>the foot would come down</i>
<i>and all this stuff.</i>

1786
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,360
PHIL TIPPETT:
<i>It was really tricky stuff</i>

1787
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,360
<i>animating these things</i>
<i>on these snowy sets.</i>

1788
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,080
<i>So initially, I think,</i>
<i>the intent was</i>

1789
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,360
<i>to try and set up</i>

1790
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,520
scenes that would
be bluescreen comped

1791
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,800
into background plates
that were shot on location.

1792
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,600
<i>But this kid</i>
<i>showed up at ILM</i>

1793
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:43,360
<i>who was this, like,</i>
<i>amazing painter,</i>

1794
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:47,000
<i>and so most of the work</i>
<i>of the snow walkers</i>
<i>and the tauntauns</i>

1795
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,400
<i>were done</i>

1796
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:52,960
<i>against these</i>
<i>painted backdrops</i>
<i>that Mike made.</i>

1797
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,520
HUSTON:<i> I like the snow</i>
<i>walkers. I think that's</i>
<i>just a great idea.</i>

1798
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,800
<i>And I think that</i>
<i>the compositing</i>
<i>got a lot better,</i>

1799
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,480
but it was better
than it was in <i>Star Wars.</i>

1800
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,200
And so it's a little
bit more believable.

1801

<i>of </i>The Empire Strikes Back

I'm not set.

1807
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,960
Steady, Dak.

1808
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,840
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

1809
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,200
NARRATOR:<i> As with</i>
<i>the first film,</i>

1810
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,960
<i>principal photography</i>
<i>for </i>The Empire Strikes Back

1811
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:46,640
<i>was done at Elstree Studios</i>
<i>in London.</i>

1812
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,120
<i>Here, members</i>
<i>of the original cast</i>

1813
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,720
<i>would be introduced to</i>
<i>a new principal character</i>

1814
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:55,440
<i>Lando Calrissian,</i>
<i>played by Billy Dee Williams.</i>

1815
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,120
Why, you slimy,

1816
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:00,240
double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

1817
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,520
You've got a lot
of guts coming here

1818
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,360
after what you pulled.

1819
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,760
(LAUGHS)

1820
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,400
How you doin',
you old pirate?
So good to see you!

1821
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,480
Well, he seems
very friendly.

1822
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,040
Yes.

1823
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,680
Very friendly.

1824
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,920
It's always interesting to
create a character that has

1825
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,960
you know, a sort
of dual character.

1826
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,560
You know, you're not
quite sure about him.

1827
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,120
Especially if he's cute.
And I was really kind of cute.

1828
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,880
Hello. What have
we here?

1829
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,320
Welcome,
I'm Lando Calrissian.

1830
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,040
I'm the administrator
of this facility.

1831
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,680
And who might you be?

1832
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,080
Leia.

1833
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,160
Welcome, Leia.

1834
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:54,280
All right, all right,
you old smoothie.

1835
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,680
NARRATOR:
The Empire Strikes Back
<i>also introduced</i>

1836
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:00,920
<i>a new villain to the saga</i>

1837
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,440
<i>the calculating, cold-blooded</i>
<i>bounty hunter Boba Fett.</i>

1838
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,920
What's going on,
buddy?

1839
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,080
You're being put
into carbon freeze.

1840
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:14,440
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1841
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,480
The Empire will
compensate you
if he dies.

1842
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,680
Put him in.

1843
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,360
We looked at the scene

1844
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:24,200
where Han Solo goes
into the freezing chamber.

1845
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,120
FORD:<i> George had scripted</i>

1846
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:30,520
an exchange between
Princess Leia
and Han Solo,

1847
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,560
which went like this.

1848
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:37,200
She said, "I love you,"
and Han Solo said,
"I love you too."

1849
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,320
<i>And it kind of, uh,</i>
<i>seemed to me</i>

1850
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,640
<i>that we weren't</i>
<i>taking advantage</i>
<i>of the character</i>

1851
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,440
<i>that we'd established</i>
<i>for Han Solo.</i>

1852
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,720
KERSHNER: <i>We tried take,</i>
<i>after take, after take.</i>

1853
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,760
<i>Nothing satisfied me.</i>
<i>And, finally,</i>

1854
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,080
I said, "Harrison.

1855
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,720
"Don't think about it.
Don't think about it.

1856
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,440
"Let's shoot it.
Okay, action!"

1857
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:01,520
I love you.

1858
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,800
I know.

1859
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,440
<i>And he dropped in,</i>
<i>and I said, "Cut."</i>

1860
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:10,240
I said, "Yeah,
that's a great line.
That's Han Solo."

1861
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:16,800
NARRATOR: <i>Ironically, the most</i>
<i>talked-about new character</i>

1862
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,760
<i>wasn't a human at all,</i>

1863
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,440
<i>but a two-foot-tall puppet</i>
<i>called Yoda.</i>

1864
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,920
<i>Designed by Stuart Freeborn,</i>

1865
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,440
<i>and operated by Muppeteer</i>
<i>Frank Oz,</i>

1866
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,760
<i>the tiny creature was</i>
<i>a fully realized character</i>

1867
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,600
<i>and a unique achievement</i>
<i>in movie puppetry.</i>

1868
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:36,000
STUART FREEBORN:
<i>George showed me</i>
<i>a few original sketches,</i>

1869
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:39,440
<i>and I thought,</i>
<i>"Well, that's interesting,</i>

1870
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,160
<i>"but I want something</i>
<i>in more depth," you see?</i>

1871
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,440
And so I looked
in the mirror

1872
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:46,720
and I thought, "Well,

1873
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:54,720
"something perhaps
a little bit amusing
about my face."

1874
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,360
<i>So I modeled</i>
<i>something of myself.</i>

1875
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,680
<i>Now I've got to make</i>
<i>him look intelligent.</i>

1876
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:05,240
<i>I got this photograph of</i>
<i>Einstein and put the Einstein</i>
<i>wrinkles in all around.</i>

1877
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:07,880
<i>I did a lot</i>
<i>of thinking about it</i>

1878
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,280
because he's got to be
full of subtle action
and movements,

1879
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,320
especially in the face
and the body.

1880
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:17,480
And I put it all in,
what was necessary,
and finally it all worked.

1881
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:20,560
FRANK OZ: <i>I remember Stuart</i>
<i>was under the gun.</i>

1882
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:23,200
And it was very tense.
Very tense.

1883
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,200
We had to get this thing done.
We've got to start shooting
with Yoda.

1884
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,640
<i>And so... </i>(LAUGHS)

1885
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,560
<i>While we were talking to him,</i>
<i>I just had Yoda's head,</i>

1886
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,960
<i>and I was just</i>
<i>playing with it,</i>

1887
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,480
<i>and I dropped it,</i>
<i>and it cracked.</i>

1888
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,800
(LAUGHS)

1889
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,720
So here we are

1890
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,400
and then Stuart said,
"I need a drink."

1891
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,040
So it was terrible,
because we were
pressing so much

1892
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,560
and I'm the one who
screwed it up.

1893
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:48,520
KERSHNER: <i>In order to shoot</i>
<i>the puppet moving,</i>

1894
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:53,360
<i>the set had to be built</i>
<i>about five feet</i>

1895
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,840
<i>above the floor of the stage.</i>

1896
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:00,720
<i>And we would put</i>
<i>holes or ridges</i>

1897
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,560
<i>where it would</i>
<i>stand on top of it</i>

1898
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:07,680
and he could move it along
in a certain direction.

1899
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,680
So it had
to be pre-determined.

1900
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,440
<i>On top of the stage</i>
<i>were trees,</i>

1901
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,680
<i>rocks, caves, everything.</i>

1902
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:18,880
<i>Now, they couldn't hear above,</i>

1903
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,360
<i>and Mark couldn't</i>
<i>hear Frank Oz.</i>

1904
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,720
<i>How do you do a scene?</i>
<i>You can't hear each other.</i>

1905
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,440
<i>I give Mark a lot</i>
<i>of credit for this.</i>

1906
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,000
REYNOLDS:
<i>I can remember he actually...</i>

1907
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,480
<i>This little voice called over</i>
<i>to me "Norman, Norman,"</i>
<i>he said.</i>

1908
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,160
And I actually...
I actually blushed

1909
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,760
because it seemed
so real, this weird,
weird little thing.

1910
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,240
OZ:<i> It was tremendously</i>
<i>difficult physical work.</i>

1911
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:44,960
<i>The whole floor was about</i>
<i>three-and-a-half,</i>
<i>four feet high,</i>

1912
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,880
<i>so I could be underneath</i>
<i>the floor,</i>

1913
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,640
<i>and then I would hold my hand</i>
<i>up through a hole</i>
<i>or whatever.</i>

1914
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,640
And I remember Kersh
was talking to me

1915
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,000
But he sometimes
talked to Yoda.
I'm saying,

1916
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,520
"Kersh, I can't hear you.
I'm down here
under the floor."

1917
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,560
MAN: Look a bit more
towards the lens.

1918
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,720
Uh, the other way.

1919
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,200
OZ: <i>But the pressure was</i>
<i>extreme 'cause I was</i>
<i>taking too much time.</i>

1920
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,600
<i>The reason I was taking</i>
<i>too much time was</i>
<i>this was the first time</i>

1921
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,840
<i>this has ever been done.</i>

1922
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:16,040
<i>You know, I had somebody</i>
<i>doing the cables for the ears,</i>

1923
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:18,960
<i>and somebody else was doing</i>
<i>the eyes, and somebody</i>
<i>was doing the left hand.</i>

1924
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:22,360
I had me and three other
people trying to bring
one character to life.

1925
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,800
OZ: Center those eyes a bit.
Yeah, just one second.

1926
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,000
MAN 1: The eyes... This way.
OZ: There.

1927
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:31,200
MAN: That's a bit too far.
There. That's it.

1928
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:35,680
OZ: That's good, Graham.
Okay. We'll go back
into that. Ready.

1929
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,360
MAN 1: All right. Action.

1930
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:41,880
LUKE: I followed my feelings.
You are reckless.

1931
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,360
OBI-WAN:<i> So was I,</i>
<i>if you remember.</i>

1932
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,680
He is too old.

1933
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:51,360
Yes, too old
to begin the training.

1934
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,280
I'm not afraid.

1935
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,400
Oh...

1936
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,760
You will be.

1937
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,000
You will be.

1938
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,800
OZ: Sorry. Um, problems.
MAN: Cut.

1939
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,000
That was like a real leap,

1940
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,760
because if that puppet
had not worked,

1941
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,240
the whole film would
have been down the tubes.

1942
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,400
It just would have been
a disaster if it'd been
a silly little Muppet

1943
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:16,400
If it'd been Kermit
running around in that movie,

1944
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,160
<i>the whole movie would've</i>
<i>collapsed under the</i>
<i>weight of it.</i>

1945
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:22,360
340E, take two,
"A" and "B" cameras.
(PANTING)

1946
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,800
NARRATOR:
<i>While many individuals</i>
<i>helped bring Yoda to life,</i>

1947
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,400
<i>it was Mark Hamill's</i>
<i>believable performance</i>

1948
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,920
<i>that made audiences accept</i>
<i>the character.</i>

1949
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,640
Is the dark side stronger?

1950
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,720
No, no.

1951
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,240
No.

1952
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,240
Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

1953
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,440
How do I know
the good side from the bad?

1954
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:45,920
You will know
when you are calm,
at peace.

1955
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,760
NARRATOR: <i>For Hamill,</i>
<i>playing a Jedi-in-training</i>

1956
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,880
<i>was more than just</i>
<i>a physical challenge.</i>

1957
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:53,560
<i>It was also an emotional one.</i>

1958
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:57,280
I was the only human being
on the call sheet for months.

1959
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:01,280
It would say,
"Actor: Mark Hamill.
Part: Luke.

1960

"Props, Snakes,

<i>"smoke machines,</i>
<i>Gila monsters."</i>

MAN 1: This is it.

1963
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:12,040
MAN 2: If you choose
the quick and easy path,

1964
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:16,120
as Vader did, you will become
an agent of evil,

1965
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:18,720
and the galaxy will be
plunged deeper...
Ow!

1966
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,880
...into the abyss
of hate and despair.
He bit me.

1967
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:23,400
MAN 3: You're
standing in the light.

1968
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,840
KERSHNER: He bit you?
Yeah!

1969
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:28,480
Didn't he bite me?
He just took a...
It was a little love nip.

1970
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,360
HAMILL: <i>Frank Oz</i>
<i>and his crew were there,</i>

1971
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,960
<i>but they'd get buried down</i>
<i>underneath the ground.</i>

1972
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,160
I had an earpiece
where I could hear,

1973
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,320
(IMITATING YODA)
"Many years have you...
(MUMBLES)"

1974
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:43,000
And then if you turned
your head the wrong way,
you'd pick up Radio 1,

1975
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,600
and it was the Rolling Stones
singing <i>Fool to Cry.</i>

1976
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:48,280
I remember I reacted to that

1977
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,360
and went, "Hey,
I got the Stones!"

1978
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,360
<i>And Kershner goes, "Cut!"</i>

1979
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:57,160
<i>And he's way across</i>
<i>the bog saying,</i>

1980
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:00,200
<i>"You know, if that happens</i>
<i>again, just pretend like</i>
<i>you don't hear it,"</i>

1981
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:03,640
<i>because with all the elements</i>
<i>of that set</i>

1982
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:06,920
<i>"Is the smoke good?</i>
<i>Is the snake...</i>

1983
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,800
<i>"Poke the snake.</i>
<i>Get the snake to move.</i>
<i>He's just lying there."</i>

1984
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,480
So you felt, "Let's get our
priorities straight."

1985
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:17,720
'Cause I'm concerned
about how did I come off
in the scene.

1986
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,920
<i>They were looking at</i>
<i>everything but me.</i>

1987
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:29,000
(BEEPING REPEATEDLY)

1988
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:34,480
REYNOLDS: <i>I have to say,</i>
<i>it was... You wouldn't wanna</i>
<i>fall in that pool.</i>

1989
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,040
<i>By the time you</i>
<i>finished shooting,</i>

1990
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:38,880
<i>it was full of all sorts</i>
<i>of wildlife and bugs.</i>

1991
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,800
It was absolutely foul

1992
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,880
after all those weeks
of being in the
stagnant water.

1993
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:46,440
I don't...

1994
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,680
I don't believe it.

1995
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,920
That is why you fail.

1996
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,400
NARRATOR:<i> As elaborately</i>
<i>detailed as the sets</i>
<i>were at Elstree Studios,</i>

1997
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:08,760
<i>equally impressive was</i>
<i>the work done in California.</i>

1998
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,600
<i>ILM was able to produce</i>
<i>special effects</i>

1999
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,120
<i>that were light-years ahead</i>
<i>of those seen in the</i>
<i>first</i> Star Wars.

2000
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:18,880
If you look at <i>Star Wars,</i>
you're either kind of
in space, and they're all,

2001
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,880
maybe the Death Star's
back there, maybe it isn't,

2002
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:24,040
<i>and you have a number of shots</i>
<i>on different planets.</i>

2003
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:27,040
<i>But you look at</i> Empire,
<i>and it's broad.</i>

2004
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:31,400
<i>You've got a speeder</i>
<i>sequence and two</i>
<i>or three big dogfights.</i>

2005
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:33,400
<i>You've got the whole</i>
<i>Cloud City</i>

2006
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,840
<i>and all the interiors</i>
<i>of different landscapes</i>

2007
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,840
<i>that are way beyond</i>
<i>what we'd done before.</i>

2008
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,800
So I think it was
the breadth of the work
that differentiates that

2009
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,200
from the first show.

2010
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:47,240
And each one of those
sequences required different
problem-solving skills.

2011
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,080
GAWLEY: <i>We did this</i>
<i>incredible chase through</i>
<i>the asteroid field.</i>

2012
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:10,120
<i>Designing asteroids is not</i>
<i>as easy as you think,</i>

2013
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:13,240
<i>and I remember many of us</i>
<i>in the model shop</i>

2014
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:17,040
tried and tried to come up
with something that would
look good.

2015
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:22,560
<i>And I think for some of the</i>
<i>very far ones, we had</i>
<i>used potatoes.</i>

2016
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,360
The biggest problem I had is
it wasn't going fast enough,

2017
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,160
and I was running
out of money.

2018
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:45,120
<i>Irvin Kershner's</i>
<i>an extremely good director,</i>

2019
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:48,440
<i>but the film went over budget,</i>
<i>went over schedule,</i>

2020
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:53,120
<i>and all the money I had in</i>
Star Wars <i>was committed</i>
<i>to this film, plus more.</i>

2021
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,400
We shot several scenes
in <i>Empire </i>over again.

2022
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:59,480
<i>There's a scene in Cloud City</i>
<i>where the Han Solo character</i>

2023
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:01,360
<i>is kind of pacing up and down</i>

2024
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:05,160
and Princess Leia comes in,
and he reacts to the
way she looks

2025
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:08,280
'cause she's dressed
differently than she has in
the entire rest of the film.

2026
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,560
You look beautiful.

2027
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:14,800
You should wear
girls' clothes
all the time.

2028
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,840
We looked at the dailies
and we weren't happy
with anything.

2029
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,040
The attitude of the actors
was too obvious.

2030
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,640
Sit down.

2031
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,560
Come on. Talk to me.

2032
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:28,560
And we could have let that go,
but it just didn't feel right.

2033
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:30,960
MAN 1: Retake. Action.

2034
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,120
I hope Luke made it
to the fleet all right.

2035
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,440
I'm sure he's fine.

2036
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:39,200
He's probably sittin'
around wondering what
we're up to right now.

2037
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:43,200
You know, your friend
Lando's very charming,
but I don't trust him.

2038
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:47,160
Trust him.
He's an old
friend of mine.

2039
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,000
End slate.

2040
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,120
So we shot it in a slightly
more subtle fashion,

2041
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,160
<i>which is the way it's</i>
<i>in the film now.</i>

2042
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,160
I don't trust Lando.

2043
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,560
Well, I don't trust
him either.

2044
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,800
But he is my friend.

2045
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,040
Besides, we'll soon
be gone.

2046
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:12,800
Then you're
as good as gone,
aren't you?

2047
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:20,360
NARRATOR:<i> Although most</i>
<i>production challenges</i>
<i>had been anticipated</i>

2048
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:23,240
<i>and expectations were</i>
<i>understandably high,</i>

2049
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:26,040
<i>when </i>Empire <i>went over</i>
<i>budget by $10 million,</i>

2050
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:29,760
<i>Lucasfilm suddenly</i>
<i>found itself</i>
<i>in a fiscal crisis.</i>

2051
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,920
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

2052
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,120
But you are not
a Jedi yet.

2053
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:40,000
CHARLES WEBER: <i>Three of the</i>
<i>top executives of Bank of</i>
<i>America Entertainment</i>

2054
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:43,040
walked into my office saying,
"We have to pull your loan."

2055
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:46,560
And I said, "How can
the largest bank in the
entertainment business

2056
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:50,080
"with the sequel to the
most successful movie ever out

2057
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:51,760
"be wanting to pull my loan?"

2058
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,000
He said, "Well, we have
a new credit manager,
and he just has a rule.

2059
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,880
<i>"Budget doubles,</i>
<i>he pulls the loan."</i>

2060
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,360
<i>One of the bankers</i>
<i>quit over it.</i>

2061
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:00,440
<i>They knew it was</i>
<i>a big mistake,</i>
<i>but, you know,</i>

2062
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,360
<i>I was stuck with trying</i>
<i>to make a million-dollar</i>
<i>payroll by Friday.</i>

2063
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:06,240
Release your anger.

2064
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:09,320
Only your hatred
can destroy me.

2065
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,360
That was the big difference
between the studio system

2066
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:18,240
and the independent
view of filmmaking.

2067
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:22,280
<i>The studios have a large</i>
<i>resource to draw on</i>
<i>for what they do,</i>

2068
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,880
<i>and independents don't,</i>

2069
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,760
<i>so it's a much</i>
<i>tighter situation.</i>

2070
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,880
LUCAS: <i>I was just</i>
<i>hoping the bank</i>
<i>to allow me to finish</i>

2071
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,440
without going back to
20th Century Fox
and giving away all my rights,

2072
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,480
because that's ultimately
what my other choice was,

2073
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:51,080
was to just simply let
them own it and lose
my independence.

2074
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:53,360
<i>But I wanted</i>
<i>my independence so badly,</i>

2075
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:57,000
<i>we managed to do it in a way</i>
<i>that I paid them just</i>
<i>a little bit more money,</i>

2076
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,760
<i>but they didn't get any of</i>
<i>the licensing, and they</i>
<i>didn't get any of the sequels.</i>

2077
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:02,000
<i>That was what I was</i>
<i>trying to hold on to.</i>

2078
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,280
<i>If I had to pay a few extra</i>
<i>points in order to get them</i>

2079
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:07,320
<i>to guarantee</i>
<i>a loan with the bank,</i>
<i>I could do that.</i>

2080
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:10,920
I think Fox was just as
concerned that the movie
get finished as we were.

2081
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:14,120
NARRATOR:
<i>While </i>Empire's <i>budget</i>
<i>may have been tight,</i>

2082
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:17,360
<i>security during the production</i>
<i>was even tighter.</i>

2083
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:22,760
<i>Only Lucas, Kershner,</i>
<i>and the film's producers</i>
<i>knew the real story.</i>

2084
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:28,280
KERSHNER:<i> At the time,</i>
<i>I knew that Mark had a father</i>
<i>and that it was Darth Vader,</i>

2085
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,600
but this was
not in the script.

2086
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:35,960
There was a false page
inserted, and I had
the knowledge.

2087
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:38,080
<i>The actors</i>
<i>didn't even have it.</i>

2088
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:41,240
<i>No one had it.</i>
<i>It was a total secret.</i>

2089
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,840
GANIS:<i> The script was under</i>
<i>lock and key, the models</i>
<i>were under lock and key,</i>

2090
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:49,320
ILM was under lock and key
and shrouded from the rest
of the world.

2091
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,880
The storyline of the movie
was under lock and key.

2092
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,560
DARTH VADER: You are beaten.

2093
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,640
It is useless to resist.

2094
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,200
NARRATOR:
<i>The film's shocking climax,</i>

2095
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,880
<i>in which Darth Vader</i>
<i>reveals Luke Skywalker's</i>
<i>true parentage,</i>

2096
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,920
<i>was kept a secret</i>
<i>from nearly everyone,</i>

2097
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,800
<i>even David Prowse</i>
<i>and Mark Hamill.</i>

2098
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:11,760
<i>Hamill was told</i>
<i>privately, just moments</i>
<i>before the cameras rolled.</i>

2099
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,320
KERSHNER:
<i>I met with Mark and said,</i>

2100
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,160
"You know that
Darth Vader's your father."

2101
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:18,400
"Wha..."

2102
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:22,200
They had taken me aside
and said, "This is what
he's really going to say."

2103
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,640
"And we're gonna do the scene.

2104
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:30,640
<i>"And Darth Vader will be</i>
<i>saying stuff that doesn't</i>
<i>count. Forget it.</i>

2105
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:33,920
<i>"Use your own rhythm</i>
<i>compared to what he's doing."</i>

2106
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:40,320
Argh!

2107
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,800
There is no escape.

2108
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,800
Don't make me destroy you.

2109
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:51,400
We did a few takes,
and he finally got into it.

2110
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:53,240
Join me,

2111
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,600
and I will complete
your training.

2112
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:59,200
KERSHNER<i>: And here is</i>
<i>Darth Vader, who had</i>
<i>his dialogue, by the way,</i>

2113
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:01,200
<i>and he's speaking</i>
<i>the dialogue.</i>

2114
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:04,560
He thinks it's
being recorded, you see.

2115
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:08,240
It's not being recorded.
What's being recorded
is this, this, this.

2116
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:12,040
He said, "You don't
know the truth.
Obi-Wan killed your father."

2117
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,840
And then, of course,
we re-recorded everything.

2118
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,440
I'll never join you!

2119
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,480
If you only
knew the power

2120
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,760
of the dark side.

2121
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:25,000
JONES: <i>When I first saw</i>
<i>the dialogue that said,</i>

2122
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,240
<i>"Luke, I am your father,"</i>

2123
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:31,520
I said to myself,
"He's lying.

2124
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,800
"I wonder how they're gonna
play that lie out."

2125
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,520
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

2126
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,280
He told me enough.

2127
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,600
He told me you killed him.

2128
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,080
No.

2129
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,640
I am your father.

2130
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:51,960
And I scream, "No!"
just as it was meant to be.

2131
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,280
No!

2132
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,920
No!

2133
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:01,480
Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy

2134
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,160
as father and son.

2135
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,120
KERSHNER: <i>I think that</i>
<i>it went beyond</i> Star Wars.

2136
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:20,080
<i>You got to know the</i>
<i>characters a little</i>
<i>better, you had some humor.</i>

2137
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,280
Laugh it up, fuzzball.

2138
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:27,640
KERSHNER:<i> I thought of</i>
<i>the film as the second</i>
<i>movement of a symphony.</i>

2139
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,480
<i>That's why I wanted</i>
<i>some of the things slower.</i>

2140
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:33,920
And it...
It ends in a way

2141
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,480
<i>that you can't wait to see,</i>

2142
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:41,040
<i>to hear the vivace,</i>
<i>the next movie,</i>
<i>the allegretto.</i>

2143
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:45,840
<i>I didn't have a climax</i>
<i>at the end. I had an</i>
<i>emotional climax.</i>

2144
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:48,760
NARRATOR:<i> As </i>Empire's
<i>premiere date approached,</i>

2145
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,560
<i>the producers once again</i>
<i>held their collective breath.</i>

2146
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:08,200
<i>When </i>The Empire Strikes Back
<i>finally opened on</i>
<i>May 21, 1980,</i>

2147
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:11,800
<i>it didn't meet expectations</i>
<i>it surpassed them.</i>

2148
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:16,800
<i>Within three months,</i>
<i>George Lucas had recovered</i>
<i>his $33 million investment.</i>

2149
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,840
MUREN:<i> There was something</i>
<i>about </i>Empire

2150
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,680
<i>that immediately just clicked</i>
<i>when I saw it.</i>

2151
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:24,280
I didn't know how all the
romance was gonna work
and the adventure,

2152
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,400
and was it too serious
and all this sort of stuff,

2153
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,000
<i>but it really came together.</i>

2154
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:32,680
NARRATOR:<i> Until its</i>
<i>premiere, cases of</i>
<i>lightning striking twice</i>

2155
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,080
<i>were rare in Hollywood.</i>

2156
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,240
<i>Sequels were almost always</i>
<i>a let-down.</i>

2157
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:40,000
<i>But in the </i>Star Wars <i>universe,</i>
<i>different laws applied.</i>

2158
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:43,840
<i>And George Lucas,</i>
<i>the world's most successful</i>
<i>independent filmmaker,</i>

2159
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,520
<i>was fast becoming</i>
<i>a law unto himself.</i>

2160
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:49,080
<i>In a radical move</i>
<i>by Hollywood standards,</i>

2161
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:52,920
<i>he shared </i>Empire's <i>profits</i>
<i>with every one of</i>
<i>his employees,</i>

2162
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:56,640
<i>handing out over</i>
<i>five million dollars</i>
<i>in bonuses in 1980.</i>

2163
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,760
<i>The profits from the two</i>
Star Wars <i>films</i>

2164
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:04,400
<i>also helped fuel Lucas's</i>
<i>rapidly expanding</i>
<i>business enterprises.</i>

2165
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,160
We did have some money,
but it was still
a start-up company.

2166
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:10,000
We could have messed it up
as much as we did it right.

2167
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,640
<i>But his ability to make</i>
<i>successful movies</i>

2168
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,680
<i>is what drove the financial</i>
<i>success of the company.</i>

2169
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,320
<i>But how we used those funds</i>
<i>to grow the company</i>

2170
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,280
and why he has a net worth
the way he does,

2171
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:24,000
he was smart enough to
understand all the rights,
all the ancillaries.

2172
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:28,800
NARRATOR: <i>By financing</i>
The Empire Strikes Back
<i>with his own money,</i>

2173
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:32,600
<i>George Lucas had</i>
<i>bet the farm and won.</i>

2174
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:37,040
<i>In fact, he was in a position</i>
<i>to build his own kind of farm,</i>

2175
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:40,840
<i>Skywalker Ranch,</i>
<i>in Marin County, California.</i>

2176
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:48,440
<i>Lucas had long imagined</i>
<i>a visually inspiring setting</i>

2177
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:51,920
<i>where his employees could work</i>
<i>in a creative atmosphere</i>

2178
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,640
<i>and where friends like Steven</i>
<i>Spielberg, Robert Redford,</i>
<i>and Francis Ford Coppola</i>

2179
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:00,080
<i>could enjoy working at</i>
<i>a state-of-the-art facility.</i>

2180
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:03,560
KAZANJIAN: <i>George</i>
<i>was debating on two</i>
<i>different parcels of land</i>

2181
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:08,240
One was on Lucas Valley Road.

2182
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:11,080
(LAUGHS) And I said,
"Well, that's the one
you have to pick!"

2183
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:21,080
The company structure
supported multi-movies
in all areas

2184
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:23,760
merchandising,
special effects,
ancillaries.

2185
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:27,280
And so all
the little companies
had to be started and operated

2186
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,640
and have all these systems
put in place.

2187
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:34,480
NARRATOR:<i> LucasArts, THX,</i>

2188
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,160
<i>Skywalker Sound,</i>
<i>Industrial Light & Magic.</i>

2189
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:43,320
<i>Each subsidiary of Lucasfilm</i>
<i>would serve George Lucas's</i>
<i>creative vision.</i>

2190
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:46,480
<i>In turn, they revolutionized</i>
<i>a film industry</i>

2191
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,960
<i>that had for too long</i>
<i>been plagued by complacency.</i>

2192
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:55,320
WEBER: <i>It was an idea</i>
<i>of one person and successfully</i>
<i>implemented.</i>

2193
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:59,040
George has one of
the more successful
companies in the world.

2194
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:01,520
And you can't
measure it just by size,

2195
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:05,720
because he doesn't
need the size
of a Fox or a Warners

2196
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:07,160
to accomplish the same thing

2197
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,000
he's accomplishing
in putting out his films.

2198
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:14,920
NARRATOR:<i> As the sole owner</i>

2199
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,440
<i>of the most</i>
<i>successful franchise</i>
<i>in movie history,</i>

2200
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:20,720
<i>Lucas had gained</i>
<i>the financial means</i>
<i>and the creative freedom</i>

2201
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,480
<i>to produce anything he wanted.</i>

2202
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:26,480
SPIELBERG:<i> George's greatest</i>
<i>strength as a filmmaker</i>

2203
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:28,400
<i>is that he's a great</i>
<i>storyteller.</i>

2204
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:29,840
<i>George has a vision.</i>

2205
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:33,520
There are filmmakers
down through history,
like Capra and John Ford,

2206
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:37,000
and they made
John Ford pictures
and Frank Capra pictures,

2207
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:38,720
and Hitchcock
made Hitchcock films,

2208
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,520
and George Lucas
makes George Lucas pictures.

2209
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,760
NARRATOR:<i> George Lucas</i>
<i>had helped turn the tide of</i>
<i>Hollywood's downbeat realism</i>

2210
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:51,960
<i>and brought back a sense</i>
<i>of fantasy and wonder.</i>

2211
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:54,400
<i>Movies were fun again.</i>

2212
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:56,400
<i>But in the wake of </i>Empire,

2213
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:00,680
<i>the filmmaker found himself</i>
<i>unexpectedly mired in</i>
<i>Hollywood politics.</i>

2214
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:05,360
<i>To preserve the dramatic</i>
<i>opening sequences</i>
<i>of his films,</i>

2215
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:08,760
<i>Lucas wanted the screen</i>
<i>credits to come at</i>
<i>the end of the movies.</i>

2216
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:11,600
<i>It was a highly</i>
<i>unusual choice.</i>

2217
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:13,320
<i>And for the first </i>Star Wars,

2218
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:16,360
<i>the Writers Guild and</i>
<i>Directors Guild had</i>
<i>allowed it.</i>

2219
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:18,640
<i>But when Lucas did the same</i>
<i>for the sequel,</i>

2220
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,800
<i>they fined him over $250,000</i>

2221
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,840
<i>and even attempted to pull</i>
Empire <i>from theaters.</i>

2222
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,400
<i>Next, the D.G.A. went after</i>
<i>Irvin Kershner.</i>

2223
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:32,200
<i>To protect his director,</i>
<i>Lucas paid all the fines</i>
<i>to the guilds,</i>

2224
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:36,400
<i>but the situation left him</i>
<i>feeling frustrated</i>
<i>and persecuted.</i>

2225
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:41,040
KAZANJIAN:<i> Lucas was so upset</i>
<i>that he dropped out of</i>

2227
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:50,440

<i>casualty in the wake of </i>Empire

2228
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:56,240
<i>was Alan Ladd, Jr.,</i>
<i>Lucas's most vocal supporter</i>
<i>at 20th Century Fox.</i>

2229
01:59:56,320 --> 02:00:01,880
The criticism over the deal
is what ended my tenure
at Fox, really,

2230
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,840
<i>'cause people were very angry</i>
<i>and irritated,</i>

2231
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,600
<i>even though they made millions</i>
<i>of dollars off it.</i>

2232
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:12,640
And, uh, had a big fight,
stomped out of the boardroom,

2233
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:15,600
and said, "I quit."

2234
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:18,120
<i>That was it.</i>

2235
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:22,360
NARRATOR:<i> 20th Century Fox</i>
<i>ultimately paid a heavy</i>
<i>price for Ladd's departure.</i>

2236

<i>With his long-time ally</i>
<i>gone from the studio,</i>

2237
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:28,800
<i>Lucas decided</i>
<i>to go to Paramount</i>
<i>with his latest movie idea,</i>

02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:32,760
<i>an action-adventure</i>
<i>yarn called</i>
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

2239
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,080
NARRATOR: <i>George Lucas had</i>
<i>fought and won the battle</i>

2240
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:41,760
<i>to gain his independence</i>
<i>as a filmmaker,</i>

2241
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:44,400
<i>but the war between</i>
<i>his Rebel Alliance</i>

2242
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:47,600
<i>and the Galactic Empire</i>
<i>was far from over.</i>

2243
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:51,320
<i>As he began production on</i>
<i>the final chapter of</i>
<i>his</i> Star Wars <i>saga,</i>

2244
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,960
<i>he knew expectations</i>
<i>among fans and critics</i>

2245
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:56,480
<i>would be greater</i>
<i>than ever before.</i>

2246
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:59,080
<i>The project was</i>
<i>a high-stakes gamble,</i>

2247
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:02,560
<i>with Lucas once</i>
<i>again putting up</i>
<i>every dollar himself.</i>

2248

<i>Nothing about the film,</i>
<i>not even the smallest detail,</i>

2249

<i>could be taken for granted.</i>

2250

George came to me,
and he said,
"The title of Episode VI

2251
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:17,280
"is, uh, <i>Return of the Jedi."</i>

2252
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,080

"I think it's a weak title."

<i>"We're calling it</i>
Revenge of the Jedi."

<i>was just the beginning.</i>

2256
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:35,240
Jedi <i>would require thousands</i>
<i>of production decisions</i>
<i>on both sides of the globe.</i>

<i>that's three</i>

and, of course, working
and shooting in London
at the same time.

2260
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:49,440
NARRATOR:<i> As Lucas</i>
<i>discovered, independence</i>
<i>was a double-edged sword.</i>

2261
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:52,320
<i>Quitting the Directors Guild</i>
<i>made it impossible for him</i>

2262
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:55,120
<i>to hire his first choice,</i>
<i>Steven Spielberg.</i>

2263
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,720
<i>Instead, Lucas chose Welshman,</i>
<i>Richard Marquand,</i>

2264
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:02,560
<i>best known for the</i>
<i>World War II thriller,</i>
Eye of the Needle.

2265
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:05,920
<i>As the two met with Lawrence</i>
<i>Kasdan to discuss</i>
Jedi's <i>script,</i>

2266
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,520
<i>a key issue was whether</i>
<i>Harrison Ford,</i>

<i>who was now equally famous</i>
<i>for the role of Indiana Jones,</i>

2268
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:14,360
<i>would return as Han Solo.</i>

2269
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:18,400
The other actors
after <i>Star Wars</i>
had signed on to do two more,

2270
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:19,840
'cause I wanted to finish
the whole thing.

2271
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:22,320
<i>Harrison did not. He had</i>
<i>the idea, "Why don't</i>
<i>you kill him off?</i>

2272
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:23,440
<i>"Why don't you kill him off?"</i>

2273
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:27,200
FORD:<i> I thought</i>
<i>Han Solo should die.</i>

2274
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:31,000
I thought he ought
to sacrifice himself for
the other two characters.

2275
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:34,560
I also felt someone had to go.

2276
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:38,160
You know,
I felt someone had to die.

2277
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:42,200
I said, "He's got no mama,
he's got no papa,
he's got no future,

2278
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:48,040
"he has no story

02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:52,480
<i>"so let's allow him</i>
<i>to commit self-sacrifice."</i>

2280
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:57,000
And I thought it should happen
very early in the last act,

2281
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:59,000
so that you would
begin to worry
about everybody.

2282
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:01,600
<i>We should sacrifice somebody.</i>

2283
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:03,640
<i>And, uh,</i>
<i>George was against it,</i>

2284
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:07,000
<i>and George knew</i>
<i>what he wanted,</i>
<i>and he got what he wanted.</i>

2285
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,000
Hey, it's me.

2286
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:12,280
NARRATOR:
<i>Once production began,</i>
<i>Lucas was determined</i>

2287
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,240
<i>not to let the budget escalate</i>
<i>as it had on </i>Empire.

2288
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:16,480
Good luck.

2289
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:18,160
You're going to need it.

2290
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:21,240
NARRATOR: <i>It wasn't easy,</i>
<i>given that the rest</i>
<i>of the world</i>

2291
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,240
<i>assumed money was no object.</i>

2292
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:26,240
BLOOM:<i> Anytime you would try</i>
<i>and negotiate for</i>
<i>production facilities,</i>

2293
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:28,240
people would say,
"Well, that'll
cost two dollars,"

2294
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:30,480
when it might normally
cost a dollar.

2295
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:33,240
So I had the suggestion
that we change the name
of the picture.

2296
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:35,920
<i>It was called </i>Blue Harvest,
<i>and the sub line</i>
<i>behind it was</i>

2297
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,720
<i>"Horror Beyond Imagination."</i>
"B" camera.

2298
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:41,320
The idea behind it was
to come up with a title

2299
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:46,320
that would instill absolutely
no interest whatsoever
in what you were doing.

2300
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:49,520
It was like, "Well, what is
<i>Blue Harvest?"</i> It's like,
"Well, who cares?"

2301
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:54,160
<i>It worked until Han,</i>
<i>and Luke, and Leia</i>
<i>showed up to come to work,</i>

2302
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:57,880
and everybody went, "Oh,
I guess this really isn't
'Horror Beyond Imagination.'

2303
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,120
"I guess this is really
the next <i>Star Wars</i> movie."

2304
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:04,520
NARRATOR: Revenge of the Jedi
<i>would again reunite</i>
<i>the </i>Star Wars <i>cast and crew,</i>

2305
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:08,440

2308
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:19,040

02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:23,520
(GROWLS)

2363
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:31,320
George was really adamant that
we were going to do it
as a man in a suit.

2364
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:35,480
<i>It was gonna be like</i>
<i>a really cool Godzilla.</i>

2365
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:40,480
<i>Tony McVey, one of the</i>
<i>sculptors, fabricated</i>
<i>this big rancor suit,</i>

2366
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,120
<i>based on my design...</i>

2367
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:46,560
He designed this thing
that I call kind of a cross
between a bear and a potato.

2368
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:50,560
(GRUNTS) It was just
this big dumb thing.

2369
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:53,960
<i>But it never</i>
<i>looked that great,</i>
<i>no matter what we did.</i>

2370
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:59,360
<i>So, uh, at some point,</i>
<i>George said, "Let's do it</i>
<i>some other way."</i>

2371
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:04,720
And so Dennis thought, well,
let's try and do it as
a high-speed puppet.

2372
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:08,120
<i>We designed the skeleton</i>
<i>for the rancor.</i>

2373
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:12,880
<i>Tom St. Amand and Dave Sosalla</i>
<i>and I puppeteered the thing.</i>

2374
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:19,840
<i>It was a crazy, you know,</i>
<i>way of working,</i>

2375
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:25,120
because this thing,
it has to walk into a room
and turn around and roar,

2376
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:29,000
and it's like a four-second
shot and you're shooting
at 90 frames a second.

2377
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:32,000
<i>You've got</i>
<i>a second to shoot it.</i>

2378
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:47,400
NARRATOR: <i>ILM's creatures</i>
<i>might have been puppets,</i>

2379
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:49,920
<i>but they could still elicit</i>
<i>an emotional reaction</i>

2380
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,520
<i>from their human costars.</i>

2381
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:54,400
<i>One even triggered</i>
<i>a panic attack.</i>

2382
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:56,360
Oh! (LAUGHS)

2383
02:08:56,440 --> 02:09:00,560
I'd got claustrophobia once.
I didn't even have
the whole suit on.

2384
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:03,760
I was lying on the floor,
the camera's about
that far away from me.

2385
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:08,800
<i>Uh, Salacious Crumb,</i>
<i>the wonderful Salacious Crumb,</i>
<i>animated by Tim Rose.</i>

02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:11,800
(IMITATES BIRD CRY)
And he's pulling out my eye

2387
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:15,480
MAN: 34A, take two. Action!

2388
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:18,760
DANIELS: <i>And something went</i>
<i>in my mind I didn't catch</i>
<i>a breath</i>

2389
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:21,760
and I suddenly
could feel panic
just absorbing into my body.

2390
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:23,800
Not my eyes! R2, help!

2391
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:27,400
And I was thinking,
"Get me out! Get me out!
Get me out! Get me out!"

2392
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:31,440
And I just kept repeating it
until they managed
to whiz the head off.

2393
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:33,280
(EXHALES)
MAN: And cut.

2394

NARRATOR:<i> Daniels may</i>
<i>have lost his head as 3PO,</i>

2395
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:38,640

<i>life and limb,</i>

2396
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:44,720
<i>the production now</i>
<i>had a team of trained</i>
<i>stunt professionals.</i>

<i>For the execution scene</i>
<i>on Jabba's barge,</i>

<i>on the most ravenous</i>
<i>monster yet, the Sarlacc.</i>

2399
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:59,360

MAN: Cut.

2401
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:06,760
It wasn't edited that way,
but I was the first guy
to come off the skiff

2402
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:09,680
<i>into the pit.</i>

2403
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:12,520
I had to make sure
it'd work and everybody
was gonna be all right.

2404
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:14,520
<i>I had a lot of sand</i>
<i>coming on top of me.</i>

2405
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:17,280
<i>But I was able to say to</i>
<i>the guys, if you go in,</i>

2406
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:19,640
shut your eyes,
keep your
mouths closed, right?

2407
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:22,680
Put some cotton wool up
your nose, otherwise
you'll be sniffing up sand.

2408
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,800
<i>Three people went in</i>
<i>one after the other.</i>

2409
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:28,080
<i>As one went in, they pulled</i>
<i>him out. The other went in,</i>
<i>they pulled him out.</i>

2410
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:31,520
So, I mean, what was happening
down below is a comedy film
of its own,

2411
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:32,640
quite honestly.

2412
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:34,880
But these are the things
the public don't see.

2413
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:40,760
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

2414
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:44,360
Slate three three,
take one.

2415
02:10:58,120 --> 02:10:59,680
Boba Fett? Where?

BILLY DEE WILLIAMS:
<i>I was hanging on a rope</i>
<i>with Han Solo,</i>

2420
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:15,720
<i>and he was trying to save me,</i>

2421
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:18,520
<i>and one of the squibs</i>
<i>went right through my toe.</i>

2422
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:24,320
I'm screaming to Han,
"Stop, stop!" He's so busy
acting. (LAUGHS)

2423
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:27,800
<i>And I'm in pain,</i>
<i>and all of a sudden</i>
<i>he realized that I got hurt.</i>

2424
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:29,360
Wait! I thought
you were blind!

2425
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:32,240
It's all right!
I can see a lot better!
Don't move!

2426
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:33,720
A little higher!
Just a little higher!

2427
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:36,960
BILLY DEE:<i> Harrison,</i>
<i>he's one of those actors,</i>
<i>he's very intense.</i>

2428
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:38,520
Chewie, pull us up!

2429
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,960
<i>He really gets into what</i>
<i>he's doing, you know?</i>

2430
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:43,360
So, uh, he was really
into it. (CHUCKLES)

2431
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:49,160
NARRATOR: <i>For Carrie Fisher,</i>
<i>getting into the role</i>
<i>of Leia this time</i>

2432
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:52,120
<i>meant fitting into</i>
<i>a skimpy slave-girl costume.</i>

2433
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:58,800
I got to kill Jabba the Hutt,
but I was still much more
concerned about

2434
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:03,040
the slave-girl outfit
and what I was gonna do
about exercise.

2435
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:06,720
31C, take two.
"A" and "B" cameras.

2436

MAN: Wave your
arm around. Action!

2437
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:11,920
And then George Lucas said,

2438
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,000
"Oh, instead
of attacking Jabba
from the front

2439
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:17,920
"and be getting angry with him
and whacking him,

"I want Carrie
to jump on his back."

2441
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:23,200
<i>Then she's got her high-heel</i>

<i>with my little fellow inside,</i>
<i>it was only foam rubber,</i>

2443
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:27,760
and it went
right into his head.

2444
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:31,520
<i>He screamed his head off,</i>
<i>so we had to stop, cut.</i>

2445
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:34,040
MAN 1: And cut.
MAN 2: All right. Hold it.

2446

<i>Before they could</i>
<i>do the shot again,</i>
<i>I had to build</i>

a firm bit over the top
of his head so she
could get up there.

<i>Take three, pickup.</i>
<i>"A" and "B" camera.</i>

02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:46,160
MAN 1: Background. Go.
MAN 2: Okay, and action!

02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:47,400

(GROANS)

2452
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,120
That was a great relief.
He was an unpleasant thing,

2453
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:07,360
with mong in the corner
of the mouth, and I never
really liked that.

2454
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:12,360
Let's go. And don't
forget the droids.

2455
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:13,520
We're on our way.

2456
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:26,520
NARRATOR:
<i>For the veteran cast members,</i>

2457
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:29,880
<i>bringing something fresh</i>
<i>to their characters</i>
<i>was often difficult.</i>

2458
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:31,720
Don't move!

2459
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:33,800
I love you.

2460
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:35,200
I know.

02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:36,520
Stand up!

2462
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:41,240
NARRATOR:
<i>Another challenge on the set</i>
<i>was Richard Marquand's</i>

2463
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:43,840
<i>relative inexperience</i>
<i>with special effects.</i>

2464
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:48,040
FISHER: <i>It's a difficult</i>
<i>thing to do, you know,</i>

2465
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:51,960
work on the one hand with,
you know, the special effects,

2466
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:55,560
and on the other hand,
with a storyline with actors,

2467
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:59,760
<i>you know, and making those</i>
<i>two things marry.</i>

2468
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:02,240
LUCAS: <i>I hadn't realized that,</i>
<i>you know, ultimately,</i>

2469
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:05,440
<i>it was probably easier for me</i>
<i>to do these things than</i>
<i>to farm them out.</i>

2470
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,080
Because it was
even more complex
than the last one,

2471
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:11,040
I really did have to end up
being there every day
on the set

2472
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:14,240
and working very closely with
Richard and shooting
second unit.

2473
02:14:14,360 --> 02:14:17,920
<i>There was really more work</i>
<i>than I thought it</i>
<i>was gonna be.</i>

2474
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,320
NARRATOR:
<i>Under Lucas's supervision,</i>
<i>the production</i>

2475
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:23,200
<i>moved to</i>
<i>the redwood forests</i>
<i>of Northern California.</i>

2476
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:24,360
MAN: "B" camera.

2477
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:27,720
<i>There they photographed</i>
<i>one of the film's most</i>
<i>exhilarating action sequences.</i>

2478
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:29,760
Hey, wait!

2479
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:31,880
<i>The speeder bike chase.</i>

2480
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:35,800
Quick. Jam their com-link.
Center switch!

2481
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:43,160
MUREN:<i> I got the idea</i>
<i>of using a Steadicam,</i>

2482
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:46,720
<i>and we did a test</i>
<i>in a local park here</i>

2483
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:51,600
<i>of walking through the woods</i>
<i>on a path that we kind</i>
<i>of disguised,</i>

2484
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:55,960
<i>and he shot with a camera</i>
<i>that shot one frame of</i>
<i>film every second.</i>

2485
02:14:56,040 --> 02:15:00,720
So when you project it back
24 frames a second,
it's going 24 times faster.

2486
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:03,320
We figured you walked about
five miles an hour

2487
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:06,000
<i>it came up to</i>
<i>about 100 miles an hour,</i>
<i>and it looked great.</i>

2488
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:43,360
NARRATOR: Jedi <i>surprised</i>
<i>audiences with its</i>
<i>imaginative scope</i>

2489
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:46,720
<i>both large and small.</i>

2490
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:50,440
<i>It introduced</i>
<i>a tiny but valiant</i>
<i>new ally to the rebellion.</i>

2491
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:53,720
<i>A race of pint-sized warriors</i>
<i>known as Ewoks.</i>

2492
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:55,720
MAN: And action.

2493
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:58,080
Hey! Point that
thing someplace else.

2494

(ARGUING IN EWOKESE)

2495
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:03,840
Hey!

2496
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:06,040
Han, don't.
It'll be all right.

2497
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:11,000
<i>Joining the cast was</i>
<i>Warwick Davis, who was</i>
<i>just a youngster at the time,</i>

2498

I was an 11-year-old boy
at school, and my grandmother

2500
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:23,320
happened to hear
a radio commercial
on the London radio station.

2501

<i>They were putting out a call</i>

2502
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:32,040
I don't think anybody
on the movie was quite
as excited as I was.

NARRATOR:

<i>featured Ewok,</i>

2507
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:45,480
<i>but only after Kenny Baker</i>
<i>was suddenly taken ill.</i>

2508
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:49,080
I had this scene with Carrie
and the speeder bikes

2509
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:52,040
in California
in the redwoods.

2510
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:53,440
I was looking forward to this.

2511
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:55,720
I thought, "Carrie's nice.
I like working with Carrie."

2512
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:59,480
Come the morning
of the shoot,
Kenny was very ill in bed

2513
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:01,400
with what I believe
was food poisoning.

2514
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:05,600
I was seriously in pain.

I had a dog at the time,
and I remember whenever
he would hear a strange noise,

2523
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:42,480
he would tilt
his head from side
to side to look inquisitive.

2524

I took those kind
of movements and used
them in the character.

That they were gonna tie up

that I had certain goals
in my private life.

<i>One was to be independent</i>
<i>of Hollywood,</i>

I figured that was
the end of it for me.

2634
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:03,720
But now I find myself
being the head
of a corporation.

2635
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:07,800
So there's a certain irony
there, that I've become
the very thing

2636
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:10,960
that I was trying to,
uh, avoid,

2637
02:25:11,560 --> 02:25:15,120
which is basically what
part of <i>Star Wars </i>is about.

2638
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:17,120
The circle is
now complete.

2639
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:19,560
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

2640
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:21,880
Now I am the master.

2641
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:25,040
LUCAS:<i> That is Darth Vader.</i>
<i>He becomes the very thing</i>

2642
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:27,120
<i>that he's trying to</i>
<i>protect himself against.</i>

2643
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:30,440
But, at the same time,
I feel good that I'm
able to make my movies

2644
02:25:30,520 --> 02:25:32,000
the way I want them to be.

2645
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:37,520
NARRATOR:<i> While</i>
<i>George Lucas has remained</i>
<i>true to his own vision,</i>

2646
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:41,120
<i>it's been audiences everywhere</i>
<i>who've reaped the rewards</i>

2647
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:44,440
<i>ever since May 1977,</i>

2648
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:48,760
<i>when moviegoers first caught</i>
<i>sight of that galaxy far,</i>
<i>far away.</i>

2649
02:25:53,320 --> 02:25:55,320
FORD: <i>The themes that George</i>
<i>is dealing with</i>

2650
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:57,960
<i>are so strong, so primordial.</i>

2651
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:01,160
The conflicts between
children and their parents.

2652
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:04,080
<i>Luke Skywalker</i>
<i>was George growing up.</i>

2653
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:08,280
George facing a conflict
and the need to prove himself.

2654
02:26:08,360 --> 02:26:10,600
You have learned much,
young one.

2655
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:12,600
FORD:<i> And he did, powerfully.</i>

2656
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:14,880
You'll find
I'm full of surprises.

2657
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:19,320
OZ:<i> George was able to put</i>
<i>the good guys and the</i>
<i>bad guys and the mythology</i>

2658
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:21,560
<i>in a package that somehow</i>
<i>touched us.</i>

2659
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:25,600
I don't know how.
I guess if you know how,
everybody'd be doing it.

2660
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:27,520
Do. Or do not.

2661
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:29,240
There is no try.

2662
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:33,280
I am so pleased to be
a part of that whole legend,
even as an observer.

2663
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:35,440
<i>And I am just an observer.</i>

2664
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:37,200
Most impressive.

2665
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:39,800
He's created people that
everyone in the world knows.

2666
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:42,360
<i>Any author that could create</i>
<i>such memorable characters</i>

2667
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:44,600
<i>would be a very</i>
<i>happy person indeed.</i>

2668
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:47,320
Laugh it up, fuzzball.

2669
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:50,080
KAZANJIAN: <i>He really</i>
<i>established the</i>
<i>independent film market.</i>

2670
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:53,160
His films changed
epic productions.

2671
02:26:53,720 --> 02:26:57,440
<i>He changed storytelling.</i>
<i>He created what</i>
<i>Hollywood is today.</i>

2672
02:26:57,520 --> 02:26:59,240
I'm out of it
for a little while,

2673
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:01,200
everybody gets
delusions of grandeur.

2674
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:03,880
George was creating
a new world for Hollywood,

2675
02:27:03,960 --> 02:27:06,040
<i>and we were lucky enough</i>
<i>to be a part of it.</i>

2676
02:27:06,480 --> 02:27:07,960
LUKE: Come on!

2677
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:12,200
HAMILL: <i>He's not just</i>
<i>the creator and director,</i>
<i>now he is the studio.</i>

2678
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:16,200
He can make exactly the movie
that he wants to make.

2679
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:19,920
Obi-Wan has
taught you well.

2680
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,840
BRAUDY:<i> One of the things</i>
<i>that George Lucas has</i>
<i>done in </i>Star Wars

2681
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:26,120
is to communicate, in fact,
with the younger self
that resides

2682
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:28,720
somewhere inside
even the oldest person.

2683
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:34,240
Good shot, Red 2.
I think our
cultural imagination

2684
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:37,760
has been transformed
by Lucas's films

2685
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:42,200
<i>by taking us back to stories</i>
<i>that make us all feel</i>

2686
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:45,880
<i>that we share in the heroic</i>
<i>journey of the human</i>
<i>species on this Earth.</i>

2687
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:49,080
The Force will be
with you always.

2688
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:53,120
CRONKITE:<i> George Lucas</i>
<i>moved us into a new</i>
<i>place in space,</i>

2689
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:55,960
a new time in the future,

2690
02:27:56,040 --> 02:27:59,600
which no one else
had created up to that time.

2691
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:03,760
Star Wars <i>had a tremendous</i>
<i>impact on the young people,</i>

2692
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:06,240
<i>as well as adults,</i>
<i>for that matter.</i>

2693
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:11,520
LUCAS:<i> I committed myself</i>
<i>to making these movies.</i>

2694
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:13,120
<i>I believe in these movies.</i>

2695
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:16,480
I think they're very
entertaining. I think if I can
get a room full of people

2696
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:19,600
and they enjoy it, then I've
done whatever I hope to do.

2697
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:24,280
NARRATOR: <i>For George Lucas,</i>
<i>what began as a quest for</i>
<i>creative freedom,</i>

2698
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:29,160
<i>became a philosophy,</i>
<i>a cultural phenomenon</i>
<i>and an empire of dreams.</i>

2699
02:28:29,240 --> 02:28:30,360
(ROARS)

2700
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:46,360
(BEEPING)

2701
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,680
And may the Force
go with you.
