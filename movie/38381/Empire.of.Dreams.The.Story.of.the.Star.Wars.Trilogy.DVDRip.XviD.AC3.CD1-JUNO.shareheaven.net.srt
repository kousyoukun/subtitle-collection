1
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:12,393
The script was unlike any
I'd ever seen before...

2
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:14,463
but what was recognizable about it...

3
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,763
were the relationships
between the main characters.

4
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:19,003
That I recognized.

5
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:21,303
What do you
think of her, Han?

6
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:22,743
I'm trying not to, kid.

7
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:24,833
Good.

8
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:26,473
It was all in that screenplay.

9
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,813
The humor was there.
The heart was there.

10
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:31,143
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

11
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:36,583
We had a pirate, and we had a wizard,
and we had a farm boy and a princess.

12
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:40,113
And we had bickering robots,
and I thought, ''What's not to like?''

13
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:53,703
It was a form of popular storytelling
that allowed you to...

14
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:58,043
enter the world of the characters
and to enjoy the story.

15
00:01:03,283 --> 00:01:05,883
It has become a cultural phenomenon.

16
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:07,353
Its motifs, phrases...

17
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:08,853
May the Force be with you.

18
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:10,823
and characters are a part of
the consciousness...

19
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:13,623
of millions of people
around the globe.

20
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:17,563
Though the Star Wars universe might
seem to have sprung fully formed...

21
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,823
from the consciousness
of George Lucas...

22
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:22,963
the truth is it might've been
a very different place.

23
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,093
Originally, the story
was about Luke Starkiller.

24
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:27,733
And Starkiller
was ultimately the father...

25
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,713
and the twins were his kids.

26
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:36,583
That eventually evolved into the story
being about one of the twins...

27
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:39,013
and the father
being the bad guy.

28
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:42,453
It went through a lot of drafts
of moving the story around...

29
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:44,283
and trying to get the right fit.

30
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:47,483
Though they populate
a galaxy far, far away...

31
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:52,193
the characters of Star Wars embody
classic archetypes from myth and legend.

32
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:53,823
For luck.

33
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,303
Lucas spent over two years
developing the screenplay...

34
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,343
carefully fitting the pieces together.

35
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,933
As you write a screenplay,
you sort of move characters around.

36
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:06,713
It's like a chess set. You have
a certain set of main characters...

37
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:09,303
you have secondary characters,
you have sidekicks...

38
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:12,213
you have villains
and you have henchmen.

39
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:16,243
You move these around to figure out
how the story's gonna play itself out.

40
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:20,763
To help translate his characters from
the page to three-dimensional life...

41
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,493
Lucas hired
illustrator Ralph McQuarrie.

42
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:28,063
I found it very helpful,
in doing science fiction and fantasy...

43
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,103
to work with an illustrator...

44
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:33,193
to try to make concrete
what I have in my head...

45
00:02:33,273 --> 00:02:35,763
so I don't have to spend
a huge amount of time...

46
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:38,213
describing
every little minute detail.

47
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,373
I can just simply do a picture of it.
And I sit down with Ralph...

48
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,973
and I tell him what the character is,
what it looks like...

49
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:47,283
and then he does a series
of sketches.

50
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:49,953
I take those sketches and say,
''No, I want it more like this.

51
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:52,353
I want the eyes bigger.
I want him smaller.''

52
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,863
Sometimes completely different.

53
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:57,293
No character represents
a more primal archetype...

54
00:02:57,363 --> 00:03:00,353
than the hero of Star Wars,
Luke Skywalker.

55
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:05,733
There is no particular character
in mythology or in stories...

56
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,703
that connect directly
with Luke Skywalker.

57
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:13,143
Luke Skywalker is a hero,
and it's more generic...

58
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:15,873
more of a motif
that comes out of the various books...

59
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:18,583
written about mythology
and fairy tales...

60
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:21,583
such as Joseph Campbell's
Hero with a Thousand Faces.

61
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:23,993
Luke Skywalker's a tough character...

62
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:27,183
because by the nature
of that type of character...

63
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:28,823
they have to be an everyman.

64
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:32,293
They have to be the person
that we, the audience, relate to.

65
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:34,493
He was the person
that we went on this journey with.

66
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:36,933
The dashing figure of Luke Skywalker...

67
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:41,203
was destined to capture the imagination
of a generation of filmgoers...

68
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:45,773
but would he have been as popular had he
been played by, perhaps, Kenny Baker?

69
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:48,443
There was a point where Luke Skywalker
was gonna be a midget...

70
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:51,383
and all the people on the farm
and everything--

71
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,923
the aunt and the uncle
and that whole group--

72
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:55,513
were gonna be little people.

73
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:57,713
That boy is our last hope.

74
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:00,883
No, there is another.

75
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:03,953
It was always about these twins
and their father.

76
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,693
That was the only thing that's been
constant through the whole thing.

77
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:11,173
And at some point I took the female twin
and made her the hero...

78
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:13,763
and then, eventually, I shifted it
around to the male character.

79
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:16,903
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

80
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:20,003
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

81
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,173
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

82
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:25,813
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

83
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:29,383
One of the ways of telling a story
is to have two main characters...

84
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:32,623
that are exactly the opposite
from each other so that they contrast.

85
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:36,823
I had Luke, who was
the idealistic, naive farm boy...

86
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,763
who was going out
into the world--

87
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,993
a little frightened to do that--
take on the responsibilities.

88
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,263
We had the old man, who was the guide
and the nurturing person...

89
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:47,743
who was sending him off
and giving him advice.

90
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:51,803
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

91
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:53,303
Alderaan?

92
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:56,583
And then you usually
have the sidekick...

93
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:00,113
whose morals and everything else
are very opposite of the hero.

94
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:02,923
And so they kind of disagree
on things, and in this case...

95
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:07,153
one of the main themes is compassion
and helping one another.

96
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:10,193
Selflessness as opposed to selfishness.

97
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:12,663
So I have one character
who's very selfless...

98
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:14,963
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

99
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,593
and another who's very selfish.

100
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:20,003
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

101
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:22,603
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

102
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:25,873
I put them together so they're always
contrasting their points of view...

103
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,473
on the situation.

104
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:32,543
Han Solo is that character that
we always wished we could be.

105
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,713
I think most of us
felt like Luke Skywalker...

106
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,083
but we would've
loved to have been Han Solo.

107
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:39,623
Lucas originally envisioned Han Solo...

108
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:42,853
as a huge green-skinned monster
with large gills.

109
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,863
Raised by Wookiees, Solo had
befriended Chewbacca at an early age...

110
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,423
and together,
they had become space pirates.

111
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,933
Han Solo was meant
to be a very nefarious character.

112
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:56,843
He did start out as a monster
or strange alien character.

113
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:59,073
I finally settled on him
being human...

114
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:01,543
so that there'd be more relationship
between the three of them.

115
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:05,983
That's where Chewbacca came in
as the alien sidekick.

116
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:10,043
While several Star Wars characters
are drawn from myth and legend...

117
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:12,393
Han Solo's sidekick, Chewbacca...

118
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:15,223
was inspired
by a more personal relationship.

119
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,823
My original inspiration for Chewbacca
was my dog, Indiana.

120
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:22,133
She was the one that sat there with me
as I was writing the script.

121
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:24,963
She'd ride in the car with me
and be my copilot.

122
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:28,163
When she'd sit in the car,
she would be as tall as I am.

123
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:30,733
She was an Alaskan malamute.
She was very big.

124
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,743
I thought that was a funny image.

125
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:35,573
As I was looking for
an alien copilot for Han Solo...

126
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:38,013
I immediately thought of Indiana.

127
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:42,143
We had an old
'30s illustration showing...

128
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:45,353
a hairy, ape-like creature
that George kinda liked.

129
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:48,723
I said, ''Well, let's make it more
like a squirrel face or cat face. ''

130
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:50,853
We tried to get something
that was generic...

131
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,763
but not specific
to any animal breed.

132
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,893
We started out with the idea of him
looking sort of like a lemur.

133
00:06:57,973 --> 00:07:02,433
Then I did one creature that
had breasts down the front of it.

134
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:05,103
I removed the breasts
because it wasn't to be a female.

135
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:09,943
I put a bandolier on there
and gave him a weapon.

136
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,353
As in almost every aspect
of the filmmaking process...

137
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:16,793
creating the characters of Star Wars
was a collaborative effort.

138
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,123
I come up with an idea in my head...

139
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:21,823
of what I want a character,
alien or set to be.

140
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:26,963
Then I work with the designers
to take what I'm thinking about...

141
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,193
and make it concrete
onto a drawing.

142
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:32,103
- I got him!
- Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

143
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:35,973
Then I have to take that drawing and
turn it over to the art department...

144
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:38,913
or the prop department
or the makeup department...

145
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:40,973
and they have to then translate that...

146
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:45,413
into a real
mechanical, plastic and fur reality.

147
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:55,763
We didn't really have the ability to
do animated characters at that point...

148
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,733
so I made the decision,
with Chewbacca...

149
00:07:57,803 --> 00:08:00,763
that it would be a large man in a suit.

150
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:05,663
They said it was hairy and big,
and that was all that they said.

151
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:08,643
We arrive up there,
looked around...

152
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:12,513
and there is Ralph McQuarrie's drawing
of a Neanderthal man.

153
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:17,743
But the difference was
Ralph had put Bermuda shorts...

154
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:21,083
and a vest on Chewie.

155
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:25,523
I had no choice.

156
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:27,153
What are you doing?
Trust him!

157
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,963
To make Chewbacca's
facial expressions believable...

158
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:34,093
Lucas turned to one of
the few experts in the field.

159
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:38,033
I was working with Stuart Freeborn,
who did the apes on 2001 .

160
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:41,093
I thought it was a fantastic job he did,
and since we had this Wookiee...

161
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:46,943
I said, ''We'll use the same mechanics
they used in 2001 to create the apes. ''

162
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:48,953
3 56, take four.

163
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,073
So he tried to take
what Ralph had drawn and interpret it...

164
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:55,123
to use Peter Mayhew.

165
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:58,683
And he is a certain structure.
He has a certain way of walking.

166
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:00,493
He has certain eyes.

167
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:04,863
Taking his actual skeletal structure
and turning that into a costume...

168
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:08,833
and a face that mechanically
would work changes the design.

169
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:11,203
Just the nature
of the reality of it changes it.

170
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:14,803
Whenever you have a design concept
and you put it into reality...

171
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,743
most of the time,
but especially in the early years...

172
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:19,473
it would change everything.

173
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:22,883
Now, with digital technology, it's
much easier to conceive of something...

174
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,683
design something
and have it come out just that way.

175
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,623
But in the old days,
that didn't happen.

176
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:31,353
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

177
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:35,093
One of the movies that inspired me
in the beginning of Star Wars...

178
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:36,893
was Akira Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress.

179
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:43,133
It's about two peasants who are at
the lowest social level in feudalJapan.

180
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:55,673
Traveling with a general
and a princess--

181
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:57,683
very, very aristocratic people.

182
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:06,323
So the story is told
from their point of view.

183
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:10,793
It's the lowest social category
watching this adventure...

184
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:14,733
that is taking place on the grandest
level of international diplomacy.

185
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:18,263
They're designed as a kind
of Mutt and Jeff...

186
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:22,863
Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy
comic relief to the movie.

187
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:25,243
I've just about had enough of you.

188
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:27,403
Go that way.

189
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:30,413
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

190
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,053
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

191
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:34,643
because you won't get it.

192
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:39,213
To make the comic relief work,you must
create two very different characters...

193
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:42,153
so I made one a little astrodroid...

194
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,393
that had
no human resemblance at all...

195
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:47,453
and then the other one
a more elegant translator droid...

196
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,633
that was more
anthropomorphic in nature...

197
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:52,533
and more programmed
to interface with human beings.

198
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:55,803
I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

199
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,473
This is my counterpart, R2-D2.

200
00:10:58,543 --> 00:10:59,913
Hello.

201
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:05,013
I wanted a very elegant,
sophisticated design concept for 3PO...

202
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,853
because 3PO came from a more elegant,
sophisticated environment.

203
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:12,323
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

204
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:18,333
The early concept of 3PO was inspired
by the robot in Metropolis.

205
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:22,823
3PO was to look like
the Metropolis robot, only a boy...

206
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:27,173
and I made an illustration showing 3PO
and R2 coming across the desert...

207
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:30,503
and you could see their space capsule
in the background.

208
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,983
One of the very diffiicult things
about creating 3PO...

209
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:39,183
is that I needed to create a face
that was absolutely neutral...

210
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:43,483
that I could then read into
whatever emotion it was...

211
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,993
that was being put forth
in the scene.

212
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:50,053
I had a sculptress come in
and do a series of heads...

213
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,863
to try to get to a head
that was absolutely neutral...

214
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:54,803
and had no emotion on it
whatsoever.

215
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:57,393
I wanted all the reactions...

216
00:11:57,473 --> 00:12:01,203
to be from the environment
and the story around it...

217
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,973
so that ifhe was happy you would read
happiness into his face.

218
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,013
Ifhe was sad,
you'd read sadness into his face.

219
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:10,043
And it wouldn't be distorted at all by
the physical configuration ofhis face.

220
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:13,313
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

221
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:15,013
Come out,
before somebody sees you.

222
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:18,593
I also originally was
gonna make him...

223
00:12:18,663 --> 00:12:21,423
more like an oily
used car dealer or a salesman--

224
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:24,433
He was gonna be more like a salesman
who was always trying to please...

225
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:26,363
and always saying the right thing.

226
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:29,963
-Can you speak Bocce?
-Of course. It's like a second language.

227
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,333
-All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
-Shutting up, sir.

228
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:35,133
But as Tony Daniels
came into it--

229
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,543
He was a very good actor,
and he had this British accent.

230
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:43,483
I fell in love with the accent. I tried
to use different kinds of people.

231
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:48,283
I tried to use the used car dealer.
I tried to use the salesman.

232
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:51,913
None of it worked, except for Tony
as this kind of fussy British butler.

233
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:55,223
The very first day on the set
on Star Wars, we got there...

234
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,663
and they'd onlyjust managed
to finish the costume...

235
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,963
and I actually got dressed up...

236
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:05,033
and I had to say to the continuity girl,
''Could you take a Polaroid, please...

237
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,603
and hold it up?''

238
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:12,473
And through the little eyes, I looked
at a little Polaroid of myself...

239
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,413
and that's where I really learned
totally what I looked like for the day.

240
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:18,853
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

241
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,653
you'd probably
short-circuit.

242
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:24,923
We first met 3PO
as this total gold thing.

243
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:27,393
It's very dangerous to have
a shiny thing on the set...

244
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:30,593
because it reflects everything, from
the car driving out with the supplies...

245
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:32,193
to the tea lady to the nurse--

246
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:36,323
And also, George's world was full
of muck and gristle and grime...

247
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:40,563
and so 3PO is spattered like that,
totally against his nature, of course.

248
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:43,473
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

249
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:47,343
I've got such a bad case of dust
contamination I can barely move.

250
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:50,143
He always gets polished up at the end.
This started in Star Wars...

251
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,813
as a kind of end-of-the-play,
walk-down costume,you might say.

252
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:55,013
Always polished up brightly.

253
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,093
Part of the fun of 3PO
is he has no soul.

254
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:04,053
He's programmed to think
a particular way and be compassionate...

255
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,063
but he doesn't
really know what that means.

256
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:09,223
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

257
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:12,573
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.

258
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,093
Sometimes he gets frustrated and
has very human-like qualities...

259
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:20,013
but they don't have a central place
where he can think independently.

260
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,673
Darth Vader, on the other hand,
as he becomes more mechanical...

261
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:27,553
he loses more and more ofhis ability
to even think like a human.

262
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,953
Originally, there was
the good father/the bad father.

263
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:42,233
The good father was Anakin Starkiller,
and the bad villain was Darth Vader.

264
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:46,173
In writing the scripts, those
two characters switched around a bit.

265
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:51,333
I went back and forth. Ultimately
they merged into being one character.

266
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:55,673
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

267
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:57,343
He told me enough.

268
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:01,823
He told me you killed him.

269
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,683
I am your father.

270
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:14,993
The decision to combine the good
and evil fathers of ancient legend...

271
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:17,473
created an unforgettable character...

272
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:21,873
one further enhanced by his nature
as something between man and machine.

273
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:26,643
The idea that Darth Vader was
becoming more machine than man...

274
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:31,653
and that he was losing his soul and
that he was losing his humanness...

275
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,083
was a main theme.

276
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:38,053
In the case of Darth Vader,
Lucas's initial design concept...

277
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,923
evoked bedouin warriors
of the Arabian peninsula.

278
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:43,623
George came in
and described Darth Vader to me...

279
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,393
as a figure that fluttered
in on the wind--

280
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:49,233
a very dark, spooky character.

281
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:53,933
He might have a big helmet on,
like a Japanese medieval warrior.

282
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:57,773
McQuarrie quickly realized the
practical realities of space travel...

283
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,873
would affect his designs
for the character.

284
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:05,413
His solution would come to be one
of Darth Vader's most sinister traits.

285
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:07,643
He's gonna come
from one spacecraft...

286
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:10,783
and they're gonna
blow a hole in this tunnel...

287
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:13,723
and come into
this other spacecraft.

288
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:15,783
I started to get worried...

289
00:16:15,863 --> 00:16:20,063
about him having to cross this space
in a vacuum without a space suit.

290
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,793
So George reluctantly said...

291
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:24,803
''Go ahead and give him
some sort ofbreathing mask. ''

292
00:16:24,873 --> 00:16:29,033
Like everything I was doing, we'd get
to a certain point and he'd say...

293
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,343
''Okay, that's fine.
Let's go on to something else. ''

294
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:34,273
We left Darth Vader
the way I had it...

295
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:37,513
and he got into the film pretty much
like I had painted him.

296
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:45,683
What George Lucas has done--
the same as Tolkien--

297
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:47,923
is he's created
memorable characters.

298
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,093
You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

299
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:56,103
I thought he had reached something
very powerful and primordial.

300
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:57,793
I'm not afraid.

301
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:00,343
You will be.

302
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:05,843
You think of Star Wars today, some
25 years after the original release...

303
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:08,073
and you sort of don't remember
the special effects.

304
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:12,313
You remember the characters. It's the
creation of Darth Vader and Han Solo...

305
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:14,983
and Yoda and Luke Skywalker
and Chewbacca.

306
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:17,153
It's the characters that remain.

307
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:20,713
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

308
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:22,823
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

309
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:26,003
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

310
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:28,903
To be fair,you have to start
with George's genius...

311
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:32,563
for understanding human nature
and film.

312
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:34,993
There's nothing for me here now.

313
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:37,943
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

314
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:41,853
These mythologies
have stood the test of time...

315
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:45,913
and become beloved by audiences
because of the fact...

316
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:50,083
that they have such wonderfully created
and performed characters.

317
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,023
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

318
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:56,223
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.

319
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:05,103
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

320
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:10,633
Can anyone?

321
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:17,173
That's my face.

322
00:18:21,623 --> 00:18:24,353
I thought that was
a deer's ass in here.

323
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:28,193
Cut!

324
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,893
Cheer them on, guys.
Cheer them on.

325
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:34,523
Try and climb up,
get back down again.

326
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:37,163
Beat the-- out of them!

327
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:44,343
And cut.

328
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:16,493
He was your favorite baddie.
He was doable as a bad guy.

329
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:18,863
It either scares you or thrills you.

330
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:21,023
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

331
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,433
There was something chilling
about that breathing noise.

332
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,103
Episode III, ultimately,
is the story about...

333
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,543
how does Anakin Skywalker
become Darth Vader...

334
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:35,443
and I think that's the story
everybody has been waiting for.

335
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:37,743
This is the beginning
of the end for Anakin.

336
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:42,313
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

337
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:53,063
Part of the reason I went back
to tell the prequel...

338
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,293
ofhow Anakin Skywalker
became Darth Vader...

339
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:58,533
is that it's an interesting story,
and it's a fun story to tell...

340
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:01,903
because it is the story
ofhow a good person turns bad.

341
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:05,673
He progresses
from being a bright, smart...

342
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:07,683
loving, caring young boy...

343
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:10,943
to being an attentive,
hardworking...

344
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,713
but ambitious Padawan learner...

345
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:17,813
who feels that
because he's better at being a Jedi...

346
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:20,053
and his Jedi skills
than most of the otherJedi...

347
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:23,393
that he should progress
further and faster.

348
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:26,553
In some ways--
a lot of ways--

349
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:30,233
I'm really ahead of him.

350
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:33,793
And as he progressed, it was
his inability to control his temper...

351
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:37,333
and his greed to control things
that were his undoing.

352
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:47,813
His whole slide to the dark side
is quite carefully done...

353
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,853
and it comes
from very human things--

354
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:53,583
that he's in love
and that he's going to be a father...

355
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,353
and that he's jealous.

356
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:57,923
I don't know.
We've all messed things up...

357
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:01,093
because we're young and naive
and not able to step back...

358
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:03,163
and go, ''Oh, no. It's okay. ''

359
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,063
Put the ship down!

360
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,703
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

361
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,923
The problem that Anakin has
in this whole thing is...

362
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:30,023
he has a hard time
letting go of things.

363
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:32,363
I don't want things to change.

364
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,453
But you can't stop the change.

365
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,933
As he sought more and more power
to try to change people's fates...

366
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:39,973
so that they're the way
he wants them...

367
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:44,613
that greed goes from trying
to save the one you love...

368
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:47,013
to realizing you can
control the universe.

369
00:21:58,363 --> 00:22:01,453
There was this missing piece
now of Episode III...

370
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:05,363
the key missing piece, which
everybody's always wanted to see...

371
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:10,393
which is the return
of Anakin Skywalker in the suit.

372
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,343
The face, the design...

373
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:22,783
the early Ralph McQuarrie inspiration
is still there...

374
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:25,683
and we've tried
to remain faithful to that.

375
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:28,583
As we looked
at the original helmet...

376
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:31,493
we've noticed
that it's not a symmetrical shape.

377
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:34,623
It was an opportunity for us
to make it more symmetrical...

378
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:37,553
and that's what we're trying to do.

379
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,633
This is the bit
where all the detail needs to be...

380
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:49,233
so we've spent a long time
getting this side beautiful.

381
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:53,573
I scanned it into a machine,
and then I flipped it in the computer...

382
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:55,673
and now I'm just
cutting the right-hand side.

383
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:59,813
Hopefully, by end of day, we'll have
the other half to put together and see.

384
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:02,413
That'll be the first time
we've seen the symmetrical Darth Vader.

385
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:08,223
We've got the beginning of the helmet.
That's gonna go into a mold tomorrow.

386
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:10,383
We've got the shoulders.
We're starting on the head.

387
00:23:10,463 --> 00:23:13,553
These pieces are gonna start coming
together and become Darth Vader...

388
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,723
but we still have to do the boxes.

389
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:17,393
We have to start doing fittings.

390
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:20,963
Originally, it starts out
as just this beige suit...

391
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:24,133
which isn't
very intimidating at all.

392
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:28,473
But I still got this sensation
of nostalgia...

393
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:32,413
that I wasn't aware
I was gonna feel.

394
00:23:32,483 --> 00:23:37,823
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

395
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:41,883
They could'vejust put some really
tall guy in it and got away with it...

396
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:44,893
but I begged and pleaded,
and they were nice enough...

397
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:47,123
to build a Darth Vader suit
that actually fit me.

398
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:49,133
When we put this helmet
on before...

399
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:53,403
it just looked too thin in here.

400
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:57,633
I don't know if you can really see it.
But by adding a little pipe there...

401
00:23:57,713 --> 00:24:02,443
and by adding a bit in there, it just
builds it out and it fills in the face.

402
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:05,513
And it's much more
what we're used to seeing.

403
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,643
So it's really weird things like that
we're just discovering all the time--

404
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:11,453
things that we thought
we'd be beyond by now.

405
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:16,493
Simultaneously,
we had to create a sequence...

406
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:19,933
where both Anakin and Obi-Wan
were gonna fight with each other.

407
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:22,763
This is a really difficult thing.
This is best friends.

408
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,673
You know,
this is a mentor and his teacher...

409
00:24:25,743 --> 00:24:27,793
and their relationship falls apart.

410
00:24:27,873 --> 00:24:29,863
Anakin allows this to happen.

411
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:34,103
Obi-Wan seems always to have
been a little wary of this child...

412
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:38,273
and having made a promise
to his dying master, Qui-Gon...

413
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:41,373
he promises to turn this wee kid
into a Jedi and look after him...

414
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:44,113
which he does, I think,
to the best of his ability.

415
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:48,293
In the sword fighting,
you have to learn a thousand moves.

416
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,453
It's very hard,
and you have to memorize them.

417
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:53,363
And you really have to memorize
them well or you get hit.

418
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:56,963
Fingers?

419
00:24:57,033 --> 00:25:00,233
The repetition of having to do
each sequence over and over again...

420
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:04,243
and trying to get it so that it is
as perfect as we could get it to be...

421
00:25:04,313 --> 00:25:05,333
was exhausting.

422
00:25:07,943 --> 00:25:09,973
We have to do that one again.

423
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:12,673
Hard work, but really satisfying,
at the end of the day.

424
00:25:14,153 --> 00:25:16,243
The guys would get so into it...

425
00:25:16,323 --> 00:25:18,623
and then one will make a mistake,
and-- boom-- break.

426
00:25:18,693 --> 00:25:21,023
They would be fine--
laughing, everything else.

427
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:22,723
Seconds later,
they were back into it.

428
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:25,823
This would go on
for hours and hours every day.

429
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:30,163
Ewan has always
been a great sword fighter...

430
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:33,333
but Hayden is very athletic,
and he's also very good at it.

431
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:35,963
The difference in this particular one
is they have to fight each other.

432
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:38,643
So we got some very,
very good performances there...

433
00:25:38,713 --> 00:25:42,673
working their routines through and
trying to be better than the other guy.

434
00:25:48,323 --> 00:25:49,723
And that leads into this.

435
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,323
They've done more layers
of the silicone...

436
00:26:01,403 --> 00:26:03,703
and then we've done
a fiberglass jacket around it.

437
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:08,363
We've then taken all of that off
so we could get the original shape out.

438
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:12,173
So we now have an empty shell, which
is going to be our Darth Vader helmet...

439
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:17,803
which now Adam is about to start
laying up in polyester--in fiberglass.

440
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:07,023
There you have
the Darth Vader helmet.

441
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:10,363
And it looks fairly good.

442
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:14,233
I think that must be incredibly exciting
for Hayden-- being Darth Vader.

443
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:16,703
Getting into Darth Vader--
that's the cool part.

444
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:19,303
One more fitting with Hayden
and then filming on him.

445
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:21,713
And it'll be just a memory.

446
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:34,583
Everyone on my crew wanted
to be involved in this.

447
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:36,963
The day we were on set with him,
and he came into shot...

448
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:39,023
and you saw him shining
as he went up...

449
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:41,933
you just thought,
''That is an amazing thing. ''

450
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:43,693
Takes us back to the old days.

451
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:16,713
A long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away.

452
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:20,923
The next chapter
in the Star Wars saga--

453
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,223
Return of theJedi.

454
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:30,603
The battle between
good and evil rages on.

455
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:35,503
Join the further adventures of...

456
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:37,403
Luke Skywalker...

457
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:39,713
Han Solo...

458
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:42,583
Princess Leia...

459
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:45,483
Lando Calrissian...

460
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:47,613
Chewbacca...

461
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:49,953
C-3PO and R2-D2...

462
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,853
and Darth Vader.

463
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:06,203
Ajourney to alien worlds.

464
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:09,403
It's a trap.

465
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:12,473
A rebellion against oppression.

466
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:18,113
An epic ofheroes and villains.

467
00:29:18,183 --> 00:29:21,743
An adventure as vast as the universe.

468
00:29:26,423 --> 00:29:28,553
Return of theJedi.

469
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:32,923
Coming to a selected theater
in your galaxy.

470
00:29:58,273 --> 00:30:04,143
The pirate and romantic films of
the '40s were an influence on Star Wars.

471
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:07,673
Errol Flynn kinds of movies.

472
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:09,883
Everything is of that genre...

473
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:13,323
which is the fantasy,
action-adventure kinds of films...

474
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:15,753
of that period of time in the cinema.

475
00:30:15,823 --> 00:30:16,723
For luck.

476
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:21,493
The whole premise of Star Wars
was that it was a romantic fantasy...

477
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:24,663
in the great romantic traditions
of mythology...

478
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,503
you know, King Arthur--

479
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:29,163
The romantic side of fighting...

480
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:31,933
where there was chivalry and honor
and that sort of thing.

481
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:37,673
So, in developing
a group of peacekeepers...

482
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:42,843
who were above everything and
honorable and could make decisions...

483
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:45,823
and bring peace to the galaxy...

484
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:49,913
I needed a weapon that was
appropriate for those kinds ofJedi.

485
00:30:49,993 --> 00:30:52,433
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

486
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:55,093
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

487
00:30:56,703 --> 00:31:00,133
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

488
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:02,533
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

489
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:06,443
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

490
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:09,703
An elegant weapon...

491
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:12,443
for a more civilized age.

492
00:31:12,513 --> 00:31:15,283
It was more a symbol
of a simpler time...

493
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:20,123
of a time before the Empire had
taken over, a time when honor ruled.

494
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:23,783
So, it was more of a symbol than it was
an actual weapon in the movie.

495
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:27,853
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a blaster at your side.

496
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:30,223
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

497
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:33,433
The original concept was that
theJedi would fight with swords.

498
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:35,973
Then I wanted to make it
a futuristic kind of sword...

499
00:31:36,043 --> 00:31:38,973
so I made it a lightsaber,
which is sort of a laser sword...

500
00:31:39,043 --> 00:31:42,013
to give it
that technology edge to it.

501
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:51,483
In an age of ray guns
and that sort of thing...

502
00:31:51,553 --> 00:31:53,453
it would deflect the rays.

503
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:56,623
Since the whole premise was that a Jedi
was there to protect himself...

504
00:31:56,693 --> 00:31:59,723
and not really be offensive,
but be defensive...

505
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:03,563
that a laser sword in a world
of ray guns...

506
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,733
would be
a perfect defensive weapon.

507
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:20,783
It started out as a kind of
Oriental form of swordplay...

508
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:24,293
where there was a lot of honor involved
and a lot of skill and craft...

509
00:32:24,353 --> 00:32:28,123
and higher spiritual meaning
to the sword fight.

510
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:31,593
So they were very simple.
In the beginning...

511
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:33,823
the first film, Episode IV...

512
00:32:33,903 --> 00:32:36,523
it was a fight between
a very old man...

513
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:40,693
and a man who was only partially
a man and mostly a mechanical being.

514
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:43,173
So it wasn't really
much of a sword fight at all.

515
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:46,113
When I left, I was but a learner.

516
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,803
Now I am the master.

517
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,943
Only a master of evil, Darth.

518
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:06,333
The original lightsaber was actually
the flash attachment to a 4-by-5 camera.

519
00:33:06,393 --> 00:33:10,663
We took the round flash part off
and made it into a lightsaber.

520
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:12,763
George was adamant that these things...

521
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:16,073
were really, really heavy,
that we couldn't take a hand off.

522
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:19,233
We always had to have two.
It was like Excalibur.

523
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:21,213
It was 40, 50 pounds of weight.

524
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:23,873
They were very powerful.
They had a lot of energy in them.

525
00:33:23,953 --> 00:33:28,083
And so you worked with them
as if they were heavy...

526
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,383
because when
they crashed together...

527
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,943
they made these big
explosions and all kinds of things.

528
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:36,223
As we went on...

529
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:39,893
we wanted to have the lightsaber fights
become faster and more intense...

530
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:43,423
as Luke became more proficient
in the art of sword fighting.

531
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:48,163
So, we very slowly started moving
away from the two-handed form...

532
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:52,643
which is more Oriental, to sometimes
using a one-handed form.

533
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:54,643
And it's progressed
further and further...

534
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:57,343
into a more two-handed
and one-handed form.

535
00:33:57,413 --> 00:34:00,583
Originally it was that you needed two
hands to hold onto this lightsaber...

536
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:04,053
because of the amount of energy
that is being swung around.

537
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:09,053
You see? You can do it.

538
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:10,823
I call it luck.

539
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:13,493
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

540
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:19,063
The effect of the lightsaber
was basically a rotating pole...

541
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:22,973
that had movie screen material
applied to it...

542
00:34:23,043 --> 00:34:25,273
so that it would reflect
its light source back...

543
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,273
at many times the intensity.

544
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:30,543
The problem was that when you moved it
out of a certain area...

545
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:32,603
it went from glowing
and looking great...

546
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:34,743
tojust a rotating pole.

547
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,583
We'd rotate it with reflective tape
so it would flash...

548
00:34:37,653 --> 00:34:39,753
and would create light
on the actors.

549
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:43,123
That never worked. As soon as they hit
each other, they broke the lightsabers.

550
00:34:43,193 --> 00:34:46,793
So then we'djust use the sticks
with the reflective material on it.

551
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:49,233
As we moved on, we got more...

552
00:34:49,903 --> 00:34:51,963
proficient at actually
doing sword fighting.

553
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:55,563
We then used swords that didn't
have the reflective material...

554
00:34:55,643 --> 00:35:00,013
but we toned down the fact that we had
to shoot the light through the lens...

555
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,013
and a lot of other things
to try to make it...

556
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:05,343
so we could be more facile
in the way we shot these fights.

557
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:08,313
1 1 8, BT, take two. A camera.

558
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:10,873
And action!

559
00:35:10,953 --> 00:35:14,653
I thought it wouldjust be handled,
and they'd put in cartoon blades later.

560
00:35:14,723 --> 00:35:17,623
But if you were sword fighting...

561
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:19,823
you wouldn't know
when to stop your hand.

562
00:35:19,893 --> 00:35:22,063
You needed something to strike.

563
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:33,313
Every laser sword really
is part real and part animated.

564
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:38,643
We need the real pole
to tell us where the sword blade is.

565
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:41,843
And sometimes we'll use a short blade
because they're fighting so close...

566
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:44,213
that they would hit the set
and things like that.

567
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:45,883
And sometimes we'd use no blade...

568
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:48,293
'cause the blade would
turn on in the shot...

569
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:51,053
or what they were doing
was so complicated...

570
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,063
that we couldn't do it
with swords themselves.

571
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:55,063
And then we would
add the sword in later.

572
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:57,503
But that takes a lot
of very careful tracking...

573
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,803
to figure out where
the sword blade would be.

574
00:35:59,873 --> 00:36:02,963
And even later on,
in the second and third one...

575
00:36:03,043 --> 00:36:06,873
when they decided that it was
more trouble than it was worth...

576
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:10,473
to try and get on-set shots--
they'djust do it all in post--

577
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:14,853
we still had part of a shaft...

578
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:18,083
just so there would be
something to come up against.

579
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:22,993
That had a lot to do with the advances
in special effects technology...

580
00:36:23,063 --> 00:36:24,863
than it did anything else.

581
00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:29,433
As we got more and more able
to do rotoscoping on these swords...

582
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:31,833
and we were using
more advanced technology...

583
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:33,873
it was easier for us
to follow the swords...

584
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:37,073
and copy them
and create laser swords.

585
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:41,003
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

586
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:44,503
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

587
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:48,913
Even though the lightsabers looked kinda
chintzy when we were shooting them...

588
00:36:49,683 --> 00:36:53,643
in postproduction they were able to
give them the look they needed to have.

589
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:55,883
And, of course,
Ben Burtt's great sound effects.

590
00:37:16,613 --> 00:37:20,313
The sound of the lightsaber was turned
over to Ben Burtt in the first film.

591
00:37:21,353 --> 00:37:24,553
Ben worked
right from the very get-go...

592
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:27,023
while I was
working on the script.

593
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:28,893
I would tell him
I needed a voice for R2.

594
00:37:30,093 --> 00:37:33,293
I needed a voice
for the breathing of Darth Vader.

595
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:37,873
I'd need a sound for ray guns.

596
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:44,533
I need a sound for laser swords.

597
00:37:52,883 --> 00:37:56,873
The very first sound I created
for the film was the lightsaber.

598
00:37:56,953 --> 00:38:02,393
I think what happened was I saw some of
the Ralph McQuarrie artwork on the wall.

599
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:05,193
It was a picture of Luke fighting
at the end of the movie.

600
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:08,863
They had these lightsabers. Immediately
something went off in my mind.

601
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:11,333
I had a feeling
for what they would sound like.

602
00:38:11,403 --> 00:38:15,503
In the booth where we projected films,
those projectors made a hum.

603
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:19,273
They weren't running,just idling.
The motors would sit there with this...

604
00:38:19,343 --> 00:38:22,143
kind of magical,
mysterious humming sound...

605
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:25,153
that I thought was musical in a way.

606
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:27,773
I thought, ''That's probably what
a lightsaber would sound like.''

607
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:29,613
Your powers are weak, old man.

608
00:38:30,353 --> 00:38:33,383
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

609
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:36,823
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

610
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:40,323
And I was searching
for some other element.

611
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,263
I had a tape recorder
with a broken mike cable.

612
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,273
Actually the shielding had
come off of it.

613
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,633
When I walked past a television set
in my apartment...

614
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:53,163
it picked up the hum from the picture
tube directly into the broken wire.

615
00:38:54,113 --> 00:38:58,073
That made a buzz. I said, ''That's
a great buzz. That sounds dangerous.''

616
00:38:58,153 --> 00:39:02,313
I recorded the buzz. Normally,
a sound person doesn't want buzz or hum.

617
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,853
In this case, the buzz and the hum
were the answer.

618
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,623
Of course,
I had to take that sound...

619
00:39:13,703 --> 00:39:18,103
and make the ''pass-bys''and the swishes
of the sword out of it.

620
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:22,433
He spent the better part of a year
trying to create those sounds.

621
00:39:22,503 --> 00:39:25,633
The first time I put in
the sounds of the lightsabers--

622
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:28,473
it was a temporary cut
of the film--

623
00:39:28,543 --> 00:39:32,413
and not much comment
was made about it.

624
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:36,943
I have since learned that when
no comment is made, then it's fantastic.

625
00:39:37,023 --> 00:39:39,043
That it passes the test.

626
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:40,213
Impressive.

627
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:43,563
Most impressive.

628
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,793
Ultimately, the sound
for the laser sword...

629
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:48,523
because we wanted something
with a lot of energy...

630
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:51,033
was a combination
of several different sounds.

631
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:53,863
From a swooshing vacuum cleaner...

632
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:58,243
to a kind of clash
when something hits dry ice.

633
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:02,173
We've modified since then,
as we get weapons that move faster...

634
00:40:02,243 --> 00:40:05,703
and we get double-edged lightsabers
in some of the newer films.

635
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:08,543
But it's always based
on that same recording.

636
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:12,443
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

637
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:15,163
You'd have been killed too...

638
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:17,993
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

639
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,793
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

640
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:24,523
There's nothing for me here now.

641
00:40:24,603 --> 00:40:27,633
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

642
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:30,673
In every episode, from IV, Vand VI...

643
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:34,003
I kept improving
the sword fighting...

644
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:37,173
because the assumption was
that Luke was getting to be...

645
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:40,313
a better fighter,
he was learning more.

646
00:40:40,383 --> 00:40:42,513
But at the same time...

647
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:46,913
he still wasn't being trained as an
originalJedi would have been trained.

648
00:40:46,993 --> 00:40:51,293
AJedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defense...

649
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,123
never for attack.

650
00:40:53,193 --> 00:40:55,893
- But tell me why I can't--
- No. There is no why.

651
00:40:57,003 --> 00:40:58,663
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

652
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:01,103
In Empire Strikes Back,
it's the first time...

653
00:41:01,173 --> 00:41:06,203
that the antagonist and protagonist
actually fight each other.

654
00:41:06,273 --> 00:41:08,973
So, it is a very big fight...

655
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:12,603
and Luke now has become
proficient enough...

656
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,613
to be able to face Darth Vader.

657
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:17,743
So, it's a slightly
one-sided sword fight...

658
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:21,083
where Vader has
the advantage over him.

659
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:23,753
Luke didn't know
that Vader was his father...

660
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,693
really for the fight part.

661
00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:28,523
He thought he was fighting
his bitter enemy.

662
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:30,363
And so he was fighting
as hard as he could.

663
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:32,873
He thought he was fighting the man
who killed his father...

664
00:41:32,933 --> 00:41:35,033
fighting the man
who killed Obi-Wan Kenobi...

665
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:38,073
fighting the man who personified evil
in the universe.

666
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:41,333
And then as we go on
into the next fight...

667
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:44,713
it becomes more of
an equal confrontation.

668
00:41:45,413 --> 00:41:48,413
In the next one,
Return of theJedi...

669
00:41:48,483 --> 00:41:50,013
he knew he was
fighting his father.

670
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:53,113
I see you have constructed
a new lightsaber.

671
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,223
He knew that the emperor
was behind all this.

672
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:58,723
Your skills are complete.

673
00:41:58,793 --> 00:42:02,063
And he knew that the issues he was
dealing with were much larger...

674
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:03,833
than just the sword fight.

675
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:08,273
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

676
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:12,713
So that sword fight centered on
the more emotional context...

677
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:15,043
the sword fight takes place in
than the fighting itself.

678
00:42:15,113 --> 00:42:16,083
Never!

679
00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:22,213
That was the climax of the film.
Rather than having it be...

680
00:42:22,283 --> 00:42:27,523
a technological warfare,
blow up the Death Star kind of thing...

681
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:30,723
it was really more of a personal fight
between a father and a son.

682
00:42:52,513 --> 00:42:55,213
Then when we moved
to the prequel...

683
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:58,253
where there wereJedi
in their full flower...

684
00:42:58,323 --> 00:43:02,383
and fighting as they were in the past--
well-trained Jedi--

685
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:05,193
we had to make the sword fights
much, much faster...

686
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:09,863
much more sophisticated and much more
aggressive in the way they're fought.

687
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,403
We continued that.

688
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:14,873
Brave of you, boy.

689
00:43:16,103 --> 00:43:18,373
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

690
00:43:18,443 --> 00:43:20,073
I am a slow learner.

691
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:21,443
Anakin!

692
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:26,003
The fights become much more ferocious
than the ones in Episodes IV, Vand VI.

693
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:36,423
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

694
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:38,293
This is just the beginning.

695
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:50,903
Each one builds on the other, because
the fights become more personal...

696
00:43:50,973 --> 00:43:54,203
until we get to Episode III where it's
a very personal form of fighting.

697
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:58,473
In this one, they have to fight each
other, so there's this very long fight.

698
00:44:02,983 --> 00:44:06,513
The difference between the characters
is that Obi-Wan has more experience...

699
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:08,353
but Anakin's more powerful.

700
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:11,963
That was good.

701
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:17,203
Thanks, everybody.

702
00:44:17,273 --> 00:44:19,563
You know, I'm here today
as Luke Skywalker...

703
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:22,903
but I'm also here
to talk about Sprint.

704
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:26,033
As you can see, you stand to save
up to 1 7 cents a month...

705
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:27,703
over the more
dependable providers.

706
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:15,043
Luke Skywalker and Han Solo
rescued the princess...

707
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:18,803
destroyed the Death Star,
but their story didn't end there.

708
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:30,583
Now the creators of
the biggest smash hit of all time...

709
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:33,423
bring you the next episode
in the Star Wars saga--

710
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:35,983
The Empire Strikes Back.

711
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:48,973
The continuing story
of our band ofheroes...

712
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:50,513
Luke Skywalker...

713
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:52,043
Princess Leia...

714
00:45:52,113 --> 00:45:53,443
Han Solo...

715
00:45:53,513 --> 00:45:54,843
C-3PO...

716
00:45:54,913 --> 00:45:56,383
R2-D2...

717
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,113
and Chewbacca.

718
00:45:58,183 --> 00:46:01,383
And introducing
Lando Calrissian.

719
00:46:01,453 --> 00:46:03,683
It's an epic of romance...

720
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:14,293
ofheroes and villains.

721
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:27,213
They cross trackless voids
to unknown worlds.

722
00:46:37,053 --> 00:46:40,083
A galactic odyssey against oppression.

723
00:46:53,073 --> 00:46:57,673
A big, new sprawling space adventure
in the Star Wars saga--

724
00:46:57,743 --> 00:47:00,043
The Empire Strikes Back.

725
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:08,673
Coming to your galaxy next summer.

726
00:47:19,923 --> 00:47:21,623
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

727
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:29,393
It is the most popular
space adventure of all time.

728
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:31,703
''Exciting''is hardly
the word I would choose.

729
00:47:31,773 --> 00:47:35,293
It's one of the most groundbreaking
sagas in Hollywood history.

730
00:47:35,373 --> 00:47:37,243
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.

731
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,643
It captured imaginations
with an irresistible force...

732
00:47:40,713 --> 00:47:43,443
You've taken your first step
into a larger world.

733
00:47:43,513 --> 00:47:47,353
and catapulted three young performers
to superstardom.

734
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:50,483
- I got him!
- Great kid! Don't get cocky.

735
00:47:50,923 --> 00:47:54,453
My whole life was changed by
the opportunities that came to me...

736
00:47:54,523 --> 00:47:56,353
through the success of Star Wars.

737
00:47:58,263 --> 00:48:01,163
It really is a wonderful morality tale.

738
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,563
I'll never turn to the dark side.

739
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:06,603
It's George's vision,
and he truly is...

740
00:48:06,673 --> 00:48:10,233
a visual man
in a profound way.

741
00:48:11,613 --> 00:48:13,343
But the Star Wars trilogy...

742
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:15,903
didn'tjust change
the way we look at movies.

743
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:18,643
It changed the way
that movies are made.

744
00:48:18,713 --> 00:48:21,413
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

745
00:48:21,923 --> 00:48:24,323
There are so many accomplishments
that George has done...

746
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:27,883
that really have changed
the business as we know it.

747
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:29,513
We did it!

748
00:48:29,593 --> 00:48:32,033
What began as
a galactic fairy tale...

749
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:35,933
became a success story
beyond one man's wildest dreams.

750
00:48:36,003 --> 00:48:38,433
The Force will be with you always.

751
00:48:38,503 --> 00:48:42,163
I expected not to ever make a hit movie.
That wasn't my agenda.

752
00:48:42,243 --> 00:48:45,473
I certainly didn't expect
Star Wars to be this giant hit.

753
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:52,453
But it became
such a phenomenon.

754
00:49:17,613 --> 00:49:21,103
It's hard to remember a time
before Star Wars.

755
00:49:25,553 --> 00:49:27,453
The world was different then.

756
00:49:29,283 --> 00:49:31,983
There were no cell phones
or personal computers.

757
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:35,023
The Internet was years away.

758
00:49:35,093 --> 00:49:37,653
Even home video
had yet to catch on.

759
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:43,193
- The space race was over.
- That's one small step for man.

760
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:45,963
Americans felt deeply mired
in the present.

761
00:49:47,643 --> 00:49:49,873
It was a time of economic inflation...

762
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:52,073
and rising oil prices...

763
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:56,573
and the nation had grown cynical
about its heroes and its leaders.

764
00:49:56,653 --> 00:49:58,583
I'm not a crook.

765
00:49:58,653 --> 00:50:01,813
In our country,
Watergate tore us apart.

766
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:04,253
And then we had
the Vietnam War on top of that...

767
00:50:04,323 --> 00:50:07,223
which was dividing the nation
like nothing else had.

768
00:50:07,823 --> 00:50:12,323
It was a terrible decade of great
storm and violence in our history.

769
00:50:13,433 --> 00:50:17,023
On the big screen, Hollywood's
view was equally grim.

770
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:23,903
The films of the early 1 970s
were gritty and often downbeat...

771
00:50:23,973 --> 00:50:27,273
a reflection of America's
social and political upheaval.

772
00:50:27,343 --> 00:50:29,543
Instead of old-fashioned heroes...

773
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:34,073
the screen was dominated by hard-nosed
antiheroes who broke all the rules.

774
00:50:37,523 --> 00:50:39,893
In the late '60s,
the Warners, the Zanucks...

775
00:50:39,963 --> 00:50:42,693
all the people that started
the studios in the first place...

776
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:46,323
were retiring, and they were selling
the studios to corporations.

777
00:50:46,403 --> 00:50:49,663
They were beverage companies
and all kinds of other other businesses.

778
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:53,433
They didn't know at all
how to run a movie studio.

779
00:50:53,503 --> 00:50:56,163
All they know is if the marketing
department said people want this...

780
00:50:56,243 --> 00:50:57,173
then you make that.

781
00:50:57,243 --> 00:50:58,573
They started marketing pictures...

782
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:01,173
and studying the demographics
and all these kinds of things.

783
00:51:01,243 --> 00:51:04,773
They saw there was a market for films
made by young people for young people...

784
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,713
'cause the young person was becoming
a bigger part of their market.

785
00:51:08,453 --> 00:51:12,613
The studio system that lasted
for decades had now collapsed.

786
00:51:12,693 --> 00:51:16,523
And Hollywood executives, desperate
to connect with younger audiences...

787
00:51:16,593 --> 00:51:20,493
turned to film schools to find
the next generation of moviemakers.

788
00:51:20,563 --> 00:51:24,023
- Action.
- It was in this atmosphere of change...

789
00:51:24,103 --> 00:51:26,763
that gifted young directors
like Francis Ford Coppola...

790
00:51:27,243 --> 00:51:28,333
Brian De Palma...

791
00:51:28,843 --> 00:51:30,303
Martin Scorsese...

792
00:51:30,373 --> 00:51:31,933
and Steven Spielberg...

793
00:51:32,013 --> 00:51:34,443
brought a more personal
sensibility to the screen.

794
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:39,473
It was a state of confusion, and a lot
of filmmakers got to make projects...

795
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:42,023
that they ordinarily wouldn't
have gotten to make.

796
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:44,213
And I got caught
right in the middle of it.

797
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:46,813
George was the kind of maverick
from Northern California...

798
00:51:47,093 --> 00:51:50,893
an independent filmmaker
who was always extremely proud...

799
00:51:50,963 --> 00:51:55,363
that he had very few
attachments to Hollywood.

800
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,063
Born in Modesto, California...

801
00:51:58,133 --> 00:52:01,233
George Lucas grew up
reading adventure stories...

802
00:52:02,503 --> 00:52:04,533
and watching movie serials
on television.

803
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:18,923
But it wasn't until college that his own
dreams of filmmaking began to surface.

804
00:52:19,623 --> 00:52:22,253
In 1 963, he left Modesto...

805
00:52:22,323 --> 00:52:25,663
to attend film classes at the
University of Southern California.

806
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:31,603
I was teaching at USC,
and George was in one of the seminars.

807
00:52:31,873 --> 00:52:36,073
We talked about some of his
early attempts at filmmaking.

808
00:52:37,143 --> 00:52:39,043
Right from the beginning...

809
00:52:39,443 --> 00:52:41,413
George had a unique vision.

810
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,073
George was a guy
that thought out of the box...

811
00:52:45,153 --> 00:52:49,743
as you can certainly see
by his student film THX-1 1 38.

812
00:52:50,193 --> 00:52:52,353
THX-1 1 38 4EB.

813
00:52:52,423 --> 00:52:54,393
THX-1 1 38 4EB.

814
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:57,053
This is Authority.
You will stop where you are.

815
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:00,863
He shot a film that was 20 minutes long.
It was supposed to be five minutes.

816
00:53:00,933 --> 00:53:02,903
You're going for
the emergency switch.

817
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:06,463
But he got a great deal of recognition
and opened the eyes of the professors...

818
00:53:06,543 --> 00:53:09,373
that kids could do
something out of the box...

819
00:53:09,443 --> 00:53:11,573
beyond what the restrictions were.

820
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:16,103
Lucas won acclaim
for his technical skills...

821
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:17,813
and imagination
as a storyteller.

822
00:53:19,183 --> 00:53:23,213
His interest in mythology and philosophy
gave his work an added dimension.

823
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:27,393
George's style was fantastic.

824
00:53:27,463 --> 00:53:29,153
Incredible.

825
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:33,923
I don't care
what he was doing...

826
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:39,093
it just looked more personal
than some of the other work.

827
00:53:40,073 --> 00:53:42,303
After graduating from USC...

828
00:53:42,373 --> 00:53:46,033
Lucas joined his friend, Francis
Ford Coppola, in San Francisco...

829
00:53:46,113 --> 00:53:49,913
where in 1 969 Coppola
founded American Zoetrope...

830
00:53:49,983 --> 00:53:51,913
an independent film company.

831
00:53:52,853 --> 00:53:56,113
I came up with no intention
of actually becoming successful.

832
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:58,713
But I did have a very strong...

833
00:53:58,793 --> 00:54:01,483
feeling about being able
to be in control of my work...

834
00:54:01,563 --> 00:54:03,293
and not having people
tamper with it.

835
00:54:03,733 --> 00:54:07,893
In 1 97 1, Lucas directed
THX-1 1 38...

836
00:54:07,963 --> 00:54:10,803
a theatrical feature
based on his student film.

837
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,893
But when Warner Brothers executives
saw the finished product...

838
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:16,943
they demanded Coppola return
the $300,000...

839
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:20,443
the studio had advanced
to develop THX and other projects.

840
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:26,943
The fledgling company imploded,
and Lucas had to find work elsewhere.

841
00:54:27,023 --> 00:54:29,513
He decided to take matters
into his own hands...

842
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:32,353
and start his own company,
Lucasfilm, Limited.

843
00:54:34,293 --> 00:54:36,593
For his first project
under this new banner...

844
00:54:36,663 --> 00:54:38,823
Lucas chose American Graffiti...

845
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:42,393
an affectionate look at teenage cruising
in the early 1 960s.

846
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:45,993
- I'm a ready teddy.
- Well, get bent, turkey.

847
00:54:48,573 --> 00:54:50,833
Produced by Universal Studios...

848
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:53,273
it was loosely based
on his own experiences...

849
00:54:53,343 --> 00:54:56,073
as a car enthusiast
growing up in Modesto.

850
00:54:56,813 --> 00:55:00,773
I had gone from being extremely
experimental and hard-edged...

851
00:55:00,853 --> 00:55:03,583
and then really taking up a challenge
that Francis gave me--

852
00:55:03,653 --> 00:55:06,523
''I bet you can't do
just a silly comedy.''

853
00:55:07,193 --> 00:55:09,663
A warm and fuzzy comedy.
I said, ''I'll try that.''

854
00:55:11,963 --> 00:55:16,563
The film was shot in just 28 days
for under a million dollars.

855
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:20,623
Coproducing was another
USC alumnus, Gary Kurtz.

856
00:55:20,703 --> 00:55:24,193
Toward the end of the postproduction
on American Graffiiti...

857
00:55:24,273 --> 00:55:28,213
we organized a screening at
the Northpoint Cinema in San Francisco.

858
00:55:30,553 --> 00:55:33,483
We felt the reaction
to the film was quite positive.

859
00:55:34,553 --> 00:55:37,643
But Ned Tanen, from Universal,
was very upset.

860
00:55:37,723 --> 00:55:40,023
''You shouldn't be showing it
to an audience at this stage. ''

861
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:41,753
We were flabbergasted.

862
00:55:42,363 --> 00:55:45,883
My first film they didn't understand and
meddled with it after it was finished.

863
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:47,553
Same with my second film.

864
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:50,263
The corporate entity came in...

865
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,303
and jerry-rigged with it,
cut five minutes out.

866
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:55,563
But even before the release
of American Graffiti...

867
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:59,443
George Lucas's imagination
was pointed at the stars.

868
00:56:01,913 --> 00:56:04,853
All during this time,
he was talking about the fact...

869
00:56:04,913 --> 00:56:09,253
that he would like to do a Flash Gordon
kind of 1 930s space opera.

870
00:56:09,323 --> 00:56:11,313
He started working on that in earnest.

871
00:56:14,763 --> 00:56:19,133
People said, ''Of all things to pick,
why in the world would you do that?''

872
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,493
I said, ''It's fun to make films
for young people.

873
00:56:24,573 --> 00:56:26,663
It's a chance to
make an impression on them.

874
00:56:29,243 --> 00:56:30,833
I wanna do this.''

875
00:56:30,913 --> 00:56:32,603
With his galactic fairy tale...

876
00:56:32,673 --> 00:56:35,203
Lucas hoped to reinvent
a classic genre.

877
00:56:36,543 --> 00:56:38,073
Among his influences...

878
00:56:38,153 --> 00:56:41,083
were the writings of scholar
and educatorJoseph Campbell...

879
00:56:41,153 --> 00:56:44,783
in which he explored the origins
of myth and world religions.

880
00:56:44,853 --> 00:56:47,153
When Lucas was writing
the script of Star Wars...

881
00:56:47,223 --> 00:56:49,163
he was heavily interested
in Joseph Campbell.

882
00:56:49,223 --> 00:56:50,853
WhatJoseph Campbell
was interested in...

883
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:55,453
was to see the connections between
the myths of different cultures...

884
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:57,963
to try to find out
what were the threads...

885
00:56:58,033 --> 00:57:00,763
that tied all these very
disparate cultures together.

886
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:03,203
I did research to try
to distill everything...

887
00:57:03,273 --> 00:57:04,933
down into motifs
that would be universal.

888
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:07,843
I attribute most of the success
to the psychological underpinnings...

889
00:57:07,913 --> 00:57:09,843
which had been around
for thousands of years...

890
00:57:09,913 --> 00:57:13,783
and the people still react the same way
to the stories as they always have.

891
00:57:13,853 --> 00:57:16,373
George is nothing
if not a good reporter.

892
00:57:16,453 --> 00:57:18,753
And when he sets out
to do his work...

893
00:57:18,823 --> 00:57:22,883
he starts reporting from
the best sources he can gather.

894
00:57:22,963 --> 00:57:25,763
He brought Campbell
into the process...

895
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,163
of looking at his work
on Star Wars...

896
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:31,723
and saying, ''Is this right?
Am I getting it down?

897
00:57:31,803 --> 00:57:34,963
Is this the right emphasis?
Is this the right character?''

898
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:39,673
Joseph Campbell said to me the best
student he ever had was George Lucas.

899
00:57:39,743 --> 00:57:41,833
Like such epics as The Odyssey...

900
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:43,913
Beowulf...

901
00:57:43,983 --> 00:57:45,813
and The Legend of King Arthur...

902
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:49,113
Star Wars drew from
a shared pool of mythic archetypes.

903
00:57:49,183 --> 00:57:54,123
You have the youth who's on the
adventure that you can identify with.

904
00:57:54,893 --> 00:57:57,053
You have the swashbuckler.

905
00:57:57,763 --> 00:57:59,563
And you have the damsel.

906
00:58:00,233 --> 00:58:03,763
She may not have the reactions
that are conventional...

907
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,963
however she is in distress.

908
00:58:06,973 --> 00:58:11,673
And you have the wise old man,
who you go and you find him.

909
00:58:11,743 --> 00:58:14,303
And you have
the funnier characters.

910
00:58:14,383 --> 00:58:18,573
I mean, it really adheres
strictly to that form.

911
00:58:18,653 --> 00:58:23,053
It's the traditional,
ritualistic coming-of-age story.

912
00:58:23,123 --> 00:58:25,923
When I went into the mythological
side of what I wanted to do...

913
00:58:25,993 --> 00:58:29,723
that's a key factor with heroes.

914
00:58:29,793 --> 00:58:32,423
By the summer of 1 973...

915
00:58:32,493 --> 00:58:37,093
George Lucas had created a treatment
that he felt was ready to shop around.

916
00:58:37,173 --> 00:58:41,033
Whether anyone would be interested,
that was another story.

917
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:52,483
The most successful science fiction film
up to that point was 2001 .

918
00:58:52,553 --> 00:58:56,483
Successful then was that
it made about $2 4 million.

919
00:58:56,553 --> 00:58:59,583
Most hit science fiction films
would make about $ 1 6 million...

920
00:58:59,653 --> 00:59:02,563
which was the Planet of the Apes films,
and that sort of thing.

921
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:05,153
But most science fiction films
would make under $ 1 0 million.

922
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:08,023
There's no reason to think
that it would do any different.

923
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:12,003
Star Wars was more
space fantasy than science fiction...

924
00:59:12,073 --> 00:59:15,833
but its galactic setting
made it a tough sell in 1 973.

925
00:59:15,903 --> 00:59:19,003
When I was pitching the film,
all I had was a 1 4-page story treatment.

926
00:59:19,073 --> 00:59:22,373
It was very vague.
Said it was kind of a 1 930s...

927
00:59:22,443 --> 00:59:24,383
action adventure,
Saturday afternoon serial...

928
00:59:24,453 --> 00:59:28,253
based on the kind of Flash Gordon,
Buck Rogers kind of comic book future.

929
00:59:28,323 --> 00:59:30,313
And that's about all
they knew about it.

930
00:59:33,963 --> 00:59:36,083
In the '70s, science fiction
seemed to be...

931
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:40,863
all about apocalyptic societies
and death and destruction.

932
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:45,893
Not very inspiring.

933
00:59:45,973 --> 00:59:48,663
We were fighting an uphill battle
with a science fiction project.

934
00:59:48,743 --> 00:59:52,673
George Lucas brought Star Wars
to Universal and United Artists.

935
00:59:52,743 --> 00:59:55,173
Both studios passed
on the project.

936
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:58,803
But the ambitious young filmmaker
was secretly relieved.

937
00:59:58,883 --> 01:00:02,983
The last thing he wanted was to hand
his dream project to the wrong people.

938
01:00:03,053 --> 01:00:05,083
He didn't care
for the studio system.

939
01:00:05,153 --> 01:00:10,113
He used it because there was no other
way of doing what he needed to do.

940
01:00:10,863 --> 01:00:15,063
Undaunted, Lucas presented
Star Wars to Alan Ladd,Jr....

941
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:18,223
the new head of creative affairs
at 20th Century Fox.

942
01:00:18,933 --> 01:00:23,773
Ladd, a former producer, was able to
recognize potential in the filmmaker...

943
01:00:23,843 --> 01:00:25,813
if not necessarily the film.

944
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:28,273
We had a meeting,
and George said...

945
01:00:28,343 --> 01:00:30,973
''I've been thinking about
this thing called Star Wars. ''

946
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:33,143
And he told me about it.

947
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,243
I said, ''That sounds terrific.''

948
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:40,183
The technology part of the whole
thing was completely over my head.

949
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:43,193
But I just believed in him
and his genius.

950
01:00:43,263 --> 01:00:45,823
I sort of recognized
from American Graffiti...

951
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:49,923
that he really was a genius,
so I just flew with it.

952
01:00:50,003 --> 01:00:52,263
He understood what talent was.

953
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,933
He respected talent
and he was able to say...

954
01:00:55,003 --> 01:00:58,063
''I think this guy's talented.
I think we're gonna invest in him. ''

955
01:00:58,143 --> 01:01:00,233
So, Alan Ladd,Jr. invested in me.

956
01:01:00,313 --> 01:01:03,243
He did not invest in the movie.
And it paid off.

957
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:09,883
In 1 973, Ladd's investment
in George Lucas provedjustified.

958
01:01:09,953 --> 01:01:13,553
American Graffiti was finally
released to rave reviews...

959
01:01:13,623 --> 01:01:16,253
and became the third-highest
grossing picture of the year.

960
01:01:16,323 --> 01:01:19,623
It went on to earn more than
$ 1 00 million worldwide.

961
01:01:21,763 --> 01:01:26,463
American Graffiti showed
a very human center and a huge heart...

962
01:01:26,533 --> 01:01:28,063
that George has always had.

963
01:01:28,673 --> 01:01:31,043
I think that surprised
a lot of people.

964
01:01:32,013 --> 01:01:34,743
With a preliminary deal
for Star Wars in place...

965
01:01:34,813 --> 01:01:38,543
Lucas began writing
his screenplay in 1 97 4.

966
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:41,173
It proved more ambitious
than he had first imagined.

967
01:01:41,983 --> 01:01:46,353
The filmmaker was able to
distill his idea down to its essence--

968
01:01:46,423 --> 01:01:49,323
an epic battle between
a heroic Rebel Alliance...

969
01:01:49,393 --> 01:01:51,883
and an evil Galactic Empire.

970
01:01:58,073 --> 01:02:02,303
The chief villain, Darth Vader,
was there practically from the start.

971
01:02:02,373 --> 01:02:05,973
But it took time to come up with
Star Wars's three main heroes--

972
01:02:06,043 --> 01:02:08,573
a plucky young princess
named Leia Organa...

973
01:02:09,383 --> 01:02:12,183
the fearless Corellian smuggler
known as Han Solo...

974
01:02:12,853 --> 01:02:15,823
and most important,
an idealistic farm boy...

975
01:02:15,883 --> 01:02:18,883
whose original name
was Luke Starkiller.

976
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:20,923
Over the course ofhis adventure...

977
01:02:20,993 --> 01:02:22,923
Luke trains to become
a Jedi knight...

978
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:26,953
deriving his power from a mystical
energy known as ''the Force. ''

979
01:02:27,633 --> 01:02:31,393
But along the way, the script
went through radical changes.

980
01:02:31,473 --> 01:02:34,163
At one point, Luke was
a 60-year-old general...

981
01:02:34,243 --> 01:02:38,103
and Han Solo
had green skin and gills.

982
01:02:39,043 --> 01:02:42,443
Even the concept of the Force
had yet to be fully realized.

983
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:44,983
Instead, there was
the Kaiburr Crystal...

984
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,143
a sort of galactic Holy Grail.

985
01:02:47,883 --> 01:02:52,953
The concept of the Force was
an important one in the story.

986
01:02:54,063 --> 01:02:55,723
The difficulty is...

987
01:02:56,423 --> 01:03:00,383
trying to create
a religious-spiritual concept...

988
01:03:00,463 --> 01:03:04,423
that works in a very simple way
without heavy exposition...

989
01:03:04,503 --> 01:03:08,033
or without it seeming
to pull down the story.

990
01:03:08,103 --> 01:03:11,093
It got to be a very fat script,
about 200 pages.

991
01:03:11,173 --> 01:03:13,143
And the story
had gotten away from me.

992
01:03:13,213 --> 01:03:16,143
So, the only way I could
cope with it was to say...

993
01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:19,613
''I'll take the first third-- the first
act-- and I'll make that into a movie.''

994
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:23,123
But I'd written all this other stuff.
I'd spent a year writing this story.

995
01:03:23,183 --> 01:03:27,183
I said, ''I'm not gonna throw away
two thirds of my year...

996
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:29,753
and say,
'This is all I can afford at this point.

997
01:03:29,823 --> 01:03:32,733
This is the only money I'm gonna get
is to do this one movie.'''

998
01:03:32,793 --> 01:03:36,923
I put it on the shelf.I said, ''By hook
or by crook, I will finish this movie. ''

999
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:45,433
But Star Wars
wouldn't be cheap.

1000
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:49,573
To get the Fox board of directors
to approve the necessary budget...

1001
01:03:49,643 --> 01:03:51,613
Lucas needed
something dramatic.

1002
01:03:52,213 --> 01:03:56,513
He hired Ralph McQuarrie, a conceptual
design artist who had worked for Boeing.

1003
01:03:57,053 --> 01:03:59,493
I'd seen some ofhis paintings.
I thought he was brilliant.

1004
01:03:59,553 --> 01:04:02,893
I said, ''I want you to do some
paintings of these scenes I've done...

1005
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:06,053
so that the studio can get a picture
of what I'm talking about.''

1006
01:04:06,693 --> 01:04:10,993
When I turned in the script, I had
about five or six drawings to say...

1007
01:04:11,073 --> 01:04:12,863
''This is what it's gonna look like. ''

1008
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:16,943
He had a concept
for a big spectacular visual...

1009
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:19,633
and it didn't come across
in the script.

1010
01:04:19,713 --> 01:04:22,473
So I tried to give it scale...

1011
01:04:22,543 --> 01:04:24,843
juxtaposing the tiny little figures...

1012
01:04:24,913 --> 01:04:28,043
with the great,
spectacular backgrounds.

1013
01:04:28,123 --> 01:04:31,313
George would say, ''Don't worry
about how we're going to do it.

1014
01:04:31,393 --> 01:04:36,653
Wejust want an impression of what the
scenes would look like on the screen. ''

1015
01:04:43,503 --> 01:04:46,903
McQuarrie's artwork won over
the Fox board of directors...

1016
01:04:46,973 --> 01:04:50,563
who soon approved a budget
ofjust over $8 million.

1017
01:04:50,643 --> 01:04:53,733
With only the first part
ofhis Star Wars saga being made...

1018
01:04:53,813 --> 01:04:56,473
Lucas also needed to think
about the future.

1019
01:04:56,543 --> 01:05:00,413
But his prior dealings with major
studios had taught him to be cautious.

1020
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:03,043
When I made the deal
for Star Wars...

1021
01:05:03,123 --> 01:05:06,523
originally I made the deal before
American Graffiiti had even come out.

1022
01:05:06,593 --> 01:05:09,753
'Cause Alan Ladd had seen American
Graffiiti and said, ''I'll make a deal.''

1023
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,383
But he made a very--

1024
01:05:11,463 --> 01:05:14,433
you're gonna make X number
of dollars and this kind of thing.

1025
01:05:14,503 --> 01:05:16,663
It was like a one-page memo.

1026
01:05:17,573 --> 01:05:21,873
When it came up to doing the contract
for the film, about a year later...

1027
01:05:21,943 --> 01:05:27,503
I knew that what I really had to do
was to protect the unwritten part--

1028
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,743
the other two parts of the script.

1029
01:05:29,813 --> 01:05:31,743
All of a sudden,
Graffiti comes out...

1030
01:05:31,813 --> 01:05:34,083
and it's a big huge, smash success.

1031
01:05:34,153 --> 01:05:38,453
So his agent came back
and said, ''Hey, look.

1032
01:05:38,523 --> 01:05:41,423
This guy has made
this huge successful movie.

1033
01:05:42,193 --> 01:05:45,393
Don't you think we should get more than
a couple hundred thousand dollars...

1034
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:47,483
for writing, directing
and producing a movie?''

1035
01:05:48,163 --> 01:05:50,493
I said, ''Yeah. I think
he should get more. ''

1036
01:05:51,173 --> 01:05:54,503
I was very careful to say, ''I don't want
more money. I don't want more points.

1037
01:05:54,573 --> 01:05:56,333
I don't want anything financial.

1038
01:05:56,403 --> 01:05:59,503
But I do want the right
to make these sequels.''

1039
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:02,443
I was working on the assumption
every filmmaker works on...

1040
01:06:02,513 --> 01:06:04,443
which is the film
will be a disaster...

1041
01:06:04,513 --> 01:06:07,743
and that it won't be promoted
and it'll just die a horrible death.

1042
01:06:07,823 --> 01:06:11,153
And it'll be very hard to get
these next two movies made.

1043
01:06:11,223 --> 01:06:14,923
George said, ''I'd like
a big slice of the merchandising. ''

1044
01:06:16,793 --> 01:06:22,663
Up until that time, merchandising
had been relatively unknown.

1045
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:25,133
When I took over the licensing,
I simply said...

1046
01:06:25,203 --> 01:06:28,363
''I'm gonna be able to make T-shirts.
I'm gonna be able to make posters...

1047
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:31,773
and I'm gonna be able to sell this
movie, even though the studio won't. ''

1048
01:06:31,843 --> 01:06:36,043
So, I managed to get control of pretty
much everything that was left over...

1049
01:06:36,113 --> 01:06:38,373
that the studio
didn't really care about.

1050
01:06:40,823 --> 01:06:43,513
George was enormously farsighted,
and the studio wasn't...

1051
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,143
because they didn't know
that the world was changing.

1052
01:06:46,223 --> 01:06:48,553
George did know the world was changing.
He changed it.

1053
01:06:53,163 --> 01:06:55,493
With his Star Wars contract
completed...

1054
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:58,963
George Lucas
now needed a rebel force...

1055
01:06:59,033 --> 01:07:01,163
up to the challenge
of production.

1056
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:04,243
In the summer of 1 975...

1057
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:08,143
he founded the visual effects company
Industrial Light & Magic.

1058
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:12,013
There was no special effects
companies in those days...

1059
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:15,073
and the studios'special effects
department had been disbanded.

1060
01:07:15,153 --> 01:07:17,583
Part of that was because
of the expense...

1061
01:07:17,653 --> 01:07:20,643
and part of it was
that the American taste...

1062
01:07:20,723 --> 01:07:23,353
the culture had gone toward
very realistic-looking films.

1063
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:27,953
We approached the visual effects
as a grand experiment, saying...

1064
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:30,933
''Can we do this with a lot of people
who work on architectural models...

1065
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:34,093
and in commercials and have never made
feature films before?''

1066
01:07:35,273 --> 01:07:38,033
We were kind oflike
a weird kind of fraternity...

1067
01:07:38,113 --> 01:07:41,473
of robotic photography nuts
or something like that.

1068
01:07:41,713 --> 01:07:45,203
I mean, this was a big movie for Fox.
We were doing commercials.

1069
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:48,073
We all dreamed
about doing a feature...

1070
01:07:48,153 --> 01:07:50,083
and this was like
the dream come true.

1071
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:53,053
So, Star Wars came along
atjust the perfect time for us.

1072
01:07:54,223 --> 01:07:57,493
We moved into a big empty
warehouse in Van Nuys...

1073
01:07:57,733 --> 01:08:01,493
right near the Van Nuys Airport
and basically started from scratch.

1074
01:08:01,563 --> 01:08:05,463
I mean, it was empty. In the early days,
you used to park your car inside.

1075
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:09,403
There was no camera equipment,
no rooms to speak of.

1076
01:08:10,073 --> 01:08:13,803
Supervising at ILM
was John Dykstra...

1077
01:08:13,873 --> 01:08:16,743
an effects cameraman who had worked
under Douglas Trumbull...

1078
01:08:16,813 --> 01:08:19,213
on films like Silent Running.

1079
01:08:19,283 --> 01:08:23,413
I was essentially to be responsible for
doing the visual effects for the film.

1080
01:08:23,483 --> 01:08:28,723
We took the concept of motion control,
which is essentially an old concept...

1081
01:08:28,793 --> 01:08:31,593
ofbeing able to duplicate camera motion
through more than one pass...

1082
01:08:31,663 --> 01:08:33,963
so that you can generate
multiple elements of film...

1083
01:08:34,033 --> 01:08:38,163
and we made it production-savvy
by tying it into a computer...

1084
01:08:38,233 --> 01:08:40,673
which was, at that point,
custom-built microprocessors.

1085
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:43,303
There were no PCs.
You didn't go buy a PC.

1086
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:45,133
We built them from scratch.

1087
01:08:47,213 --> 01:08:49,733
At the same time the camera system
was being built...

1088
01:08:49,813 --> 01:08:53,043
another team began constructing
model spaceships.

1089
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:58,753
I was one of the early hires.
They had a small art department.

1090
01:08:58,993 --> 01:09:04,013
There were some concept models made
out of cardboard and model kit pieces.

1091
01:09:04,863 --> 01:09:07,923
There were some storyboards
and some concept illustrations...

1092
01:09:08,003 --> 01:09:10,403
thatJoeJohnston had done.

1093
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:14,323
There were some paintings
that Ralph McQuarrie had done.

1094
01:09:16,473 --> 01:09:19,103
Everything came
either from my sketches...

1095
01:09:19,173 --> 01:09:22,943
or Ralph's paintings and drawings...

1096
01:09:23,643 --> 01:09:26,243
and any input
that George might have.

1097
01:09:26,313 --> 01:09:29,943
There wasn't a lot of
outside influences on Star Wars.

1098
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:46,823
George wanted it to look like
you could actually see the rivets...

1099
01:09:46,903 --> 01:09:49,803
so you could see the logic
ofhow it was made.

1100
01:09:49,873 --> 01:09:52,503
I was originally hired
to work on the Death Star...

1101
01:09:52,573 --> 01:09:54,063
the 40 foot by--

1102
01:09:55,213 --> 01:09:59,443
What was it? 40-by-80 feet or
40-by-60 feet or something like that.

1103
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:03,143
Nobody wanted thejob, because you had
to spend a lot of time on your knees.

1104
01:10:04,153 --> 01:10:07,643
Everybody sort of cross-trained
and worked in different techniques.

1105
01:10:07,863 --> 01:10:09,853
That was different
than the Hollywood system...

1106
01:10:09,923 --> 01:10:12,393
that had very strict union rules.

1107
01:10:12,463 --> 01:10:15,163
But there was no way this work
could be done that way...

1108
01:10:15,233 --> 01:10:18,463
or no way that the Hollywood unions
could understand what we were doing.

1109
01:10:19,773 --> 01:10:22,003
With preproduction
gaining momentum...

1110
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:25,943
Lucas next began the process
of casting his galactic opus.

1111
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:29,533
He shared the audition stage
with his friend, Brian De Palma...

1112
01:10:29,613 --> 01:10:33,273
who was seeking actors
for the Stephen King shocker Carrie.

1113
01:10:33,353 --> 01:10:36,443
We were both making these movies
and casting at the same time...

1114
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:38,453
so we decided to combine
our efforts.

1115
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:42,493
I've made movies with very young people
that have no track record...

1116
01:10:42,563 --> 01:10:44,323
so I have to discover them.

1117
01:10:44,393 --> 01:10:47,923
Pick them and then test them
and go through them and have readings.

1118
01:10:48,003 --> 01:10:52,833
It takes a long time. I spent probably
six or seven months casting Star Wars.

1119
01:10:54,003 --> 01:10:57,463
That's a long process to sit
in a little room and interview people.

1120
01:10:57,543 --> 01:10:59,373
And I interviewed
thousands of people.

1121
01:11:00,043 --> 01:11:04,503
In casting the male leads,
Luke Starkiller and Han Solo...

1122
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,513
Lucas looked for
individual screen presence...

1123
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,573
as well as chemistry
between performers.

1124
01:11:08,653 --> 01:11:10,143
Action.

1125
01:11:11,323 --> 01:11:13,553
It checks out again.
There's no mistake.

1126
01:11:14,863 --> 01:11:18,523
- You can't find Organa Major?
- I found it. It's just not there.

1127
01:11:18,863 --> 01:11:20,953
I found it.
It's just not there.

1128
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:23,393
What's left of it
is contaminated.

1129
01:11:23,463 --> 01:11:25,303
That's it there.

1130
01:11:25,373 --> 01:11:27,393
Look at those radiation readouts.
It's impossible.

1131
01:11:27,473 --> 01:11:31,273
-I've never seen anything like it.
-The Empire must have gotten here first.

1132
01:11:31,343 --> 01:11:33,363
The planet has been
completely blown away.

1133
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,303
For the pivotal role of Luke...

1134
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:40,583
Lucas needed an actor who could
project both intelligence and integrity.

1135
01:11:41,483 --> 01:11:43,973
She's part of the royal family.
They won't get anything out of her.

1136
01:11:44,053 --> 01:11:45,753
She knows the power of mind control.

1137
01:11:46,153 --> 01:11:49,493
She's part of the royal family.
They won't get any information from her.

1138
01:11:49,563 --> 01:11:51,533
She knows the art of mind control.

1139
01:11:52,963 --> 01:11:56,953
Twenty-four-year-old Mark Hamill was
a familiar face on television.

1140
01:11:57,033 --> 01:12:02,133
A newcomer to films, his wholesome,
easygoing manner fit the part perfectly.

1141
01:12:02,203 --> 01:12:05,373
I can remember a line
from the screen test...

1142
01:12:05,443 --> 01:12:07,633
which I don't think
ever will leave me.

1143
01:12:08,543 --> 01:12:12,243
Luke says, ''But we can't turn back.
Fear is their greatest defense.

1144
01:12:12,313 --> 01:12:15,513
I doubt the security is any greater
than it was on Aquilae or Sullust...

1145
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:18,643
and what there is is most likely
directed towards a large-scale assault.''

1146
01:12:19,093 --> 01:12:21,153
Fear is their greatest defense.

1147
01:12:21,223 --> 01:12:24,163
I doubt the security is much greater
than on Aquilae or Sullust...

1148
01:12:24,223 --> 01:12:27,063
and what there is is most likely
directed towards a large-scale assault.

1149
01:12:27,133 --> 01:12:30,723
I read that line and I thought,
''Who talks like this?''

1150
01:12:30,803 --> 01:12:32,863
So I just did it sincerely.

1151
01:12:33,533 --> 01:12:35,403
How many more systems
must get blown away...

1152
01:12:35,473 --> 01:12:37,703
before you have no place to hide
and are forced to fight?

1153
01:12:37,773 --> 01:12:39,713
Don't you realize what's going on?

1154
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:43,243
Kid, you take the glory
and the good intentions.

1155
01:12:43,313 --> 01:12:45,283
I'll take the reward.

1156
01:12:46,213 --> 01:12:48,983
The role of Han Solo
needed someone older...

1157
01:12:49,053 --> 01:12:50,743
with a more cynical edge.

1158
01:12:50,823 --> 01:12:53,723
What's that little droid carrying
that's so blasted important?

1159
01:12:53,793 --> 01:12:57,153
What's the little droid carrying
that's so important?

1160
01:12:59,033 --> 01:13:02,523
Harrison Ford had worked
with Lucas on American Graffiti.

1161
01:13:02,603 --> 01:13:05,763
But because the director
initially only wanted new faces...

1162
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:07,803
he was not allowed to audition.

1163
01:13:07,873 --> 01:13:10,363
Do I have to sit up
to get in on the right?

1164
01:13:10,843 --> 01:13:14,643
Instead, he was brought in
to feed lines to the other actors.

1165
01:13:14,713 --> 01:13:19,243
I was given sides and asked if
I would help read the other actors.

1166
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:23,973
It became my task to explain to the
other actors who were coming along...

1167
01:13:24,053 --> 01:13:27,713
just what it was that these sides...

1168
01:13:29,323 --> 01:13:31,023
were meant to be about.

1169
01:13:31,093 --> 01:13:33,723
They're gonna follow us.
They'll destroy your hidden bases.

1170
01:13:33,793 --> 01:13:35,963
- They'll destroy the whole system.
- I know.

1171
01:13:36,033 --> 01:13:37,833
They'll bring the Death Star too.

1172
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:41,703
Lucas may have been reluctant
to use Ford at first...

1173
01:13:41,773 --> 01:13:45,263
but the actor won him over by
giving Han a mix of mercenary swagger...

1174
01:13:45,343 --> 01:13:47,473
and world-weariness.

1175
01:13:47,543 --> 01:13:51,603
Well, what was so clear was what the
idea was of the character relationships.

1176
01:13:51,683 --> 01:13:54,883
Mark was the callow youth,
I was the smart-ass...

1177
01:13:54,953 --> 01:13:58,653
and we each had
a clear section of turfto explore.

1178
01:13:59,653 --> 01:14:01,923
The planet's totally blown away.

1179
01:14:02,663 --> 01:14:06,563
It would've taken 1 ,000 ships with more
firepower than I've ever seen to do it.

1180
01:14:07,663 --> 01:14:10,603
If the Empire had a new weapon
that could do this, I'd know about it.

1181
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:12,603
I'd have heard something.

1182
01:14:12,673 --> 01:14:14,603
Well, you know about it now.

1183
01:14:14,673 --> 01:14:17,103
The enemy's on the move.
We haven't much time.

1184
01:14:17,173 --> 01:14:20,833
- I brought you here. Now what?
- We've got to find the rebels.

1185
01:14:20,913 --> 01:14:26,073
- What we're carrying belongs to them.
- Their bases are very well hidden, son.

1186
01:14:26,153 --> 01:14:28,553
All the power of the Empire
can't find 'em.

1187
01:14:28,623 --> 01:14:30,413
Do you know where they are?

1188
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:31,713
No. Not anymore.

1189
01:14:31,793 --> 01:14:35,313
I'm not gonna take you on
an impossible chase across the galaxy.

1190
01:14:35,393 --> 01:14:37,883
Virtually every young actress
in Hollywood...

1191
01:14:37,963 --> 01:14:40,293
tried out for the part
of Princess Leia.

1192
01:14:40,363 --> 01:14:43,303
Although the character
was the same age as Luke...

1193
01:14:43,363 --> 01:14:45,963
as a leader of the rebellion
Leia needed to project...

1194
01:14:46,033 --> 01:14:48,023
a confidence beyond her years.

1195
01:14:48,103 --> 01:14:52,403
The plans and specifications
to a battle station...

1196
01:14:52,473 --> 01:14:54,533
with enough firepower
to destroy an entire system.

1197
01:14:54,613 --> 01:14:57,543
Our only hope in destroying it
is to find its weakness...

1198
01:14:57,613 --> 01:15:00,813
which we will determine
from the data I stored in R2.

1199
01:15:00,883 --> 01:15:03,323
Now, our only hope
in destroying it...

1200
01:15:03,383 --> 01:15:05,323
is to find its weakness...

1201
01:15:05,393 --> 01:15:07,413
which we'll do from the data
I stored in R2.

1202
01:15:08,093 --> 01:15:12,323
Okay? Now, we've captured the plans
in a raid on the imperial shipyards.

1203
01:15:12,393 --> 01:15:15,333
But we fell under attack before
I could get the data to safety...

1204
01:15:15,403 --> 01:15:18,023
so I hid it in R2
and sent him off.

1205
01:15:18,103 --> 01:15:22,973
When R2 has been safely delivered
to my forces, you get your reward.

1206
01:15:23,043 --> 01:15:24,973
You have my guarantee.

1207
01:15:25,043 --> 01:15:28,343
What's the little droid carrying
that's so blasted important?

1208
01:15:29,383 --> 01:15:31,313
The plans and specifications...

1209
01:15:31,383 --> 01:15:33,813
to a battle station
with enough firepower...

1210
01:15:33,883 --> 01:15:35,873
to destroy an entire system.

1211
01:15:37,153 --> 01:15:39,093
One actress in particular...

1212
01:15:39,153 --> 01:15:41,423
seemed tailor-made
to play a princess.

1213
01:15:41,493 --> 01:15:45,293
As the daughter of actress Debbie
Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher...

1214
01:15:45,363 --> 01:15:49,163
Carrie Fisher was the product
of Hollywood royalty.

1215
01:15:49,233 --> 01:15:52,963
She had no trouble conveying the
self-assurance needed for Leia Organa.

1216
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:55,093
I met with Brian De Palma
and George...

1217
01:15:55,173 --> 01:15:57,473
and Brian did all the talking...

1218
01:15:57,543 --> 01:15:59,973
because George didn't talk then.

1219
01:16:00,173 --> 01:16:05,483
There were incredible actresses my age
being considered for this role...

1220
01:16:05,553 --> 01:16:07,643
so I didn't think I would get it.

1221
01:16:08,123 --> 01:16:11,413
But our only hope is to destroy it
before it destroys us.

1222
01:16:12,953 --> 01:16:15,153
Hiding is useless now.

1223
01:16:15,223 --> 01:16:18,423
With the Death Star, they'll continue
to go on destroying systems...

1224
01:16:18,493 --> 01:16:20,433
until they've found us.

1225
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,433
We have no alternative
but to process the information...

1226
01:16:23,503 --> 01:16:25,693
and use it while there's still time.

1227
01:16:25,773 --> 01:16:29,403
I got it with the proviso
that I went to a fat farm...

1228
01:16:30,473 --> 01:16:32,963
and that I lose 1 0 pounds.

1229
01:16:33,043 --> 01:16:37,503
I think they were hoping it was gonna
come out five here and five here.

1230
01:16:37,913 --> 01:16:41,513
My character was someone
who was feisty and all of that...

1231
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:44,523
but I felt myself
to be a bit of that too...

1232
01:16:44,593 --> 01:16:48,893
so it would have been unlikely that
I would be cast as a shrinking violet.

1233
01:16:48,963 --> 01:16:51,323
He cast us to type, in a way.

1234
01:16:52,633 --> 01:16:55,063
Lucas's decision to hire unknowns...

1235
01:16:55,133 --> 01:16:58,193
went against the advice ofhis friend
Francis Ford Coppola...

1236
01:16:58,273 --> 01:17:01,463
who had cast The Godfather
with stage and screen stars.

1237
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:04,743
20th Century Fox
was also concerned...

1238
01:17:04,813 --> 01:17:06,773
about Lucas's choice of actors.

1239
01:17:07,443 --> 01:17:11,743
They came and said, ''These are the three
unknown people I want to go with. ''

1240
01:17:13,153 --> 01:17:16,313
I figured we'd gone down this far
in the road, he knows what he's doing.

1241
01:17:16,783 --> 01:17:20,693
I'd be lying if I said
''Oh, my God, Harrison's perfect...

1242
01:17:20,753 --> 01:17:24,553
Carrie is perfect,
and Mark is fantastic. ''

1243
01:17:25,463 --> 01:17:28,053
No, I was very nervous
about the cast.

1244
01:17:28,133 --> 01:17:32,293
For the important role of
aged Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi...

1245
01:17:32,373 --> 01:17:35,633
Lucas recognized that
he needed an established star.

1246
01:17:36,303 --> 01:17:39,603
Sir Alec Guinness was
a veteran of over 40 films...

1247
01:17:39,673 --> 01:17:41,943
and had won an Oscar in 1 958...

1248
01:17:42,013 --> 01:17:45,273
for his performance in
The Bridge on the River Kwai.

1249
01:17:45,353 --> 01:17:49,083
The knighted actor had
the pedigree and the persona.

1250
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:51,383
The Alec Guinness role...

1251
01:17:51,453 --> 01:17:55,353
required a certain stability
and gravitas as a character...

1252
01:17:55,423 --> 01:18:00,263
which meant we needed a very strong
character actor to play that part.

1253
01:18:01,403 --> 01:18:03,963
Signing Guinness was a major coup.

1254
01:18:04,033 --> 01:18:06,523
But more casting
would be done in London...

1255
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:08,933
where Star Wars
would be principally produced.

1256
01:18:09,003 --> 01:18:11,943
Unlike Lucas's home base
of Northern California...

1257
01:18:12,013 --> 01:18:15,343
London provided access to the kind of
massive soundstages...

1258
01:18:15,413 --> 01:18:18,173
needed for Star Wars's
ambitious sets.

1259
01:18:18,253 --> 01:18:22,773
The location also gave Lucas access
to Britain's top production talents.

1260
01:18:28,093 --> 01:18:32,863
The character of Darth Vader demanded
someone of commanding physical stature.

1261
01:18:34,063 --> 01:18:36,003
To fill Vader's boots...

1262
01:18:36,063 --> 01:18:39,333
Lucas cast champion bodybuilder
David Prowse...

1263
01:18:39,403 --> 01:18:42,993
whose resume included roles
like Frankenstein's creature...

1264
01:18:43,073 --> 01:18:45,603
in Hammer's
popular horror movies.

1265
01:18:45,673 --> 01:18:48,873
As Vader's evil accomplice
Governor Tarkin...

1266
01:18:48,943 --> 01:18:51,173
another Hammer alumnus was cast--

1267
01:18:51,243 --> 01:18:53,803
63-year-old Peter Cushing.

1268
01:18:53,883 --> 01:18:57,653
Best known as the methodical
Professor Van Helsing in Dracula...

1269
01:18:57,723 --> 01:18:59,653
Cushing was the perfect choice...

1270
01:18:59,723 --> 01:19:02,663
to portray the Death Star's
icy chief administrator.

1271
01:19:04,863 --> 01:19:08,923
For the part of Chewbacca, Han Solo's
towering Wookiee copilot...

1272
01:19:09,003 --> 01:19:13,303
Lucas and Kurtz had to look
outside normal casting channels.

1273
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:15,493
But at seven feet, three inches tall...

1274
01:19:15,573 --> 01:19:17,833
it was no stretch for Peter Mayhew...

1275
01:19:17,903 --> 01:19:21,073
who had been working as an orderly
at a Yorkshire hospital.

1276
01:19:21,743 --> 01:19:24,843
I sat down
on one of the sofas...

1277
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:26,773
waiting for George.

1278
01:19:28,023 --> 01:19:29,353
Door opened...

1279
01:19:30,023 --> 01:19:34,953
and George walked in
with Gary behind him.

1280
01:19:35,023 --> 01:19:36,963
So naturally, what did I do?

1281
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:38,963
I'm raised in England.

1282
01:19:39,033 --> 01:19:42,693
Soon as someone comes in
through the door, I stand up.

1283
01:19:44,003 --> 01:19:45,493
George goes--

1284
01:19:46,503 --> 01:19:48,993
Virtually turned to Gary and said...

1285
01:19:49,073 --> 01:19:51,043
''I think we've found him.''

1286
01:19:51,773 --> 01:19:56,213
Finding the right performers to portray
robots was even more of a challenge.

1287
01:19:56,743 --> 01:20:00,843
Production designers had constructed
an assortment of robots and androids...

1288
01:20:00,913 --> 01:20:03,183
to populate the Star Wars universe.

1289
01:20:03,923 --> 01:20:06,183
But it would take living,
breathing actors...

1290
01:20:06,253 --> 01:20:09,053
to give personality
to the two main droids...

1291
01:20:09,123 --> 01:20:10,283
C-3PO...

1292
01:20:10,363 --> 01:20:11,883
and R2-D2.

1293
01:20:11,963 --> 01:20:13,953
To operate R2...

1294
01:20:14,033 --> 01:20:18,903
Lucas needed a performer small in
stature, but with a big imagination.

1295
01:20:18,973 --> 01:20:22,773
Enter 3-foot-5-inch
stage comedian Kenny Baker.

1296
01:20:22,843 --> 01:20:25,703
They couldn't find anyone
that would fit inside this robot...

1297
01:20:25,773 --> 01:20:27,713
to make it move.

1298
01:20:27,943 --> 01:20:30,713
They couldn't use kids
'cause it was quite a heavy machine.

1299
01:20:30,783 --> 01:20:32,443
It weighed about 80 pounds.

1300
01:20:32,513 --> 01:20:35,613
I'd had a lot of experience
inside costumes...

1301
01:20:35,683 --> 01:20:40,213
and inside cats and dogs
and goodness knows what else.

1302
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:43,223
So when I got into the robot,
he said, ''Look happy. ''

1303
01:20:43,293 --> 01:20:45,283
So I'd go--

1304
01:20:46,733 --> 01:20:50,163
Inside, nobody could
see my expressions, obviously.

1305
01:20:50,233 --> 01:20:55,223
But you have to do something
to get the feel of the thing.

1306
01:20:56,703 --> 01:20:58,643
Actor Anthony Daniels...

1307
01:20:58,713 --> 01:21:01,643
not only had the slender build
needed for C-3PO...

1308
01:21:01,713 --> 01:21:04,043
but training as a mime artist.

1309
01:21:04,113 --> 01:21:06,553
He'd been seeing people
every five minutes.

1310
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:10,573
I was there for a while and thinking,
''Well, nearly time to go, I guess.''

1311
01:21:10,653 --> 01:21:13,953
And then, kind of over
George's shoulder, I saw a painting...

1312
01:21:14,023 --> 01:21:15,953
and the most extraordinary
thing happened.

1313
01:21:16,023 --> 01:21:19,123
Itjust struck me, because I kind of
looked at this face...

1314
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,953
and the face looked back at me, and we
had this extraordinary eye contact.

1315
01:21:23,033 --> 01:21:25,693
He's looking out of the picture
and seemed to be saying...

1316
01:21:26,373 --> 01:21:28,303
''Come. Come. Be with me.''

1317
01:21:28,373 --> 01:21:30,503
The vulnerability in his face...

1318
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:33,203
made me want to help him.

1319
01:21:33,273 --> 01:21:36,303
Isn't that weird?
He just looks utterly vulnerable.

1320
01:21:36,383 --> 01:21:40,543
That painting completely changed
my attitude to the whole project.

1321
01:21:41,213 --> 01:21:44,153
Years later I was able to go
to Ralph McQuarrie and say...

1322
01:21:44,223 --> 01:21:47,153
''You realize this is all your fault.''

1323
01:21:50,423 --> 01:21:54,153
In March 1 976,
with casting completed...

1324
01:21:54,233 --> 01:21:57,633
George Lucas and company
arrived in North Africa.

1325
01:21:58,673 --> 01:22:02,603
It was a strange caravan of British
and American filmmakers...

1326
01:22:02,673 --> 01:22:07,113
working in a French-speaking nation
on a script few people believed in.

1327
01:22:08,113 --> 01:22:13,013
The overriding thing for me
at that stage was...

1328
01:22:13,213 --> 01:22:17,953
the amount of work that we had to do,
of stuff there was to achieve...

1329
01:22:18,523 --> 01:22:21,453
and we had grave doubts
about getting it done in time.

1330
01:22:26,163 --> 01:22:29,033
But the trial by fire
had yet to begin.

1331
01:22:29,103 --> 01:22:31,533
It was now up to Lucas
to make his movie.

1332
01:22:32,433 --> 01:22:34,303
Just one day into filming...

1333
01:22:34,373 --> 01:22:38,203
the Sahara was pelted with its
first major rainfall in 50 years.

1334
01:22:38,873 --> 01:22:42,143
We were going out there
to shoot on the salt flat.

1335
01:22:42,343 --> 01:22:45,903
I came out in the morning and the rain
was going horizontally down the street.

1336
01:22:46,653 --> 01:22:48,583
I thought, ''My God--''

1337
01:22:48,653 --> 01:22:51,713
I called a rest day on the crew,
told them to go back to bed...

1338
01:22:51,793 --> 01:22:54,483
because there was no way
we were gonna shoot on that.

1339
01:22:58,233 --> 01:23:01,093
The first two weeks of shooting,
we'd run into a lot of weather problems.

1340
01:23:01,163 --> 01:23:04,153
The sets had blown down,
I didn't get everything shot.

1341
01:23:04,363 --> 01:23:08,163
It was a disaster. At that point
I was pretty depressed, saying...

1342
01:23:08,243 --> 01:23:12,643
''I've got myself in way over my head.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.''

1343
01:23:12,713 --> 01:23:15,703
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

1344
01:23:17,883 --> 01:23:21,073
With temperatures topping
1 00 degrees by midmorning...

1345
01:23:21,153 --> 01:23:24,283
Tunisia was anything
but fun in the sun.

1346
01:23:25,053 --> 01:23:27,613
Baking for hours
in heavy costume...

1347
01:23:27,693 --> 01:23:30,323
even the film's stunt coordinator,
Peter Diamond...

1348
01:23:30,393 --> 01:23:32,953
found the conditions
physically exhausting.

1349
01:23:33,033 --> 01:23:37,293
I was the only stuntperson
on the picture in Tunisia.

1350
01:23:37,363 --> 01:23:40,463
I became a Tusken Raider,
or a Sandperson.

1351
01:23:42,043 --> 01:23:45,303
I'm not a sun merchant.
I don't like the sun. I just burn.

1352
01:23:45,943 --> 01:23:48,033
So I just died
with the heat of it.

1353
01:23:48,113 --> 01:23:50,303
I couldn't stand it anymore,
it was so hot.

1354
01:23:50,383 --> 01:23:54,613
There were so many problems.
Itjust was not a good location.

1355
01:23:54,683 --> 01:23:58,243
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

1356
01:23:58,323 --> 01:24:01,383
C-3PO was finally...

1357
01:24:01,893 --> 01:24:04,363
put together
for the very first time...

1358
01:24:04,423 --> 01:24:06,593
the day before
we started shooting.

1359
01:24:07,863 --> 01:24:10,763
R2-D2 didn't really
function that well.

1360
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:13,323
He could run along
in the three-legged position...

1361
01:24:13,403 --> 01:24:16,343
but he couldn't turn his head
at the same time.

1362
01:24:16,943 --> 01:24:19,203
There were wires everywhere.

1363
01:24:19,273 --> 01:24:21,803
The head was on a track
ofball bearings.

1364
01:24:21,883 --> 01:24:26,113
I used to grab whatever I could and turn
it physically that way and that way.

1365
01:24:26,183 --> 01:24:27,813
Not very far.

1366
01:24:29,183 --> 01:24:32,023
If I went too far the wires
would go around my neck.

1367
01:24:32,093 --> 01:24:34,713
Then they'd say, ''Cut.!
Right, break for lunch. ''

1368
01:24:35,563 --> 01:24:37,893
And everybody'djust
walk away and leave me.

1369
01:24:37,963 --> 01:24:40,723
Then they'd remember me eventually.

1370
01:24:40,793 --> 01:24:42,563
That happened many times.

1371
01:24:43,433 --> 01:24:45,963
It was bad enough putting
on the costume for the first time...

1372
01:24:46,033 --> 01:24:49,263
and within two paces the left leg
had shattered down...

1373
01:24:49,343 --> 01:24:52,273
onto the plastic of the left foot...

1374
01:24:52,343 --> 01:24:55,213
and was gently
but forcibly and persistently...

1375
01:24:55,283 --> 01:24:56,773
knifing it...

1376
01:24:58,313 --> 01:25:01,183
into the soft part of my foot.

1377
01:25:01,253 --> 01:25:05,083
So we took it off,and I limped
to the set with one foot.

1378
01:25:05,153 --> 01:25:09,383
It was then I began to panic
about the days to come.

1379
01:25:12,163 --> 01:25:16,153
As the actors and crew began to grumble
about the adverse conditions...

1380
01:25:16,233 --> 01:25:20,133
it was Sir Alec Guinness who served
as a role model of professionalism.

1381
01:25:20,933 --> 01:25:24,103
It was, for me, fascinating
to watch Alec Guinness.

1382
01:25:24,173 --> 01:25:27,263
He was always prepared,
always professional...

1383
01:25:27,343 --> 01:25:29,213
always very kind to the other actors.

1384
01:25:29,283 --> 01:25:33,113
He had a very clear head
about how to serve the story.

1385
01:25:33,183 --> 01:25:37,313
He was the person who sort of
brought it some legitimacy.

1386
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:39,683
I asked him
why he wanted to do it.

1387
01:25:39,853 --> 01:25:42,693
He loved the idea
of playing a mentor or a wizard...

1388
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:44,693
in a morality play...

1389
01:25:44,763 --> 01:25:47,253
where good and evil
are so clearly defined.

1390
01:25:48,133 --> 01:25:49,623
Action!

1391
01:25:51,873 --> 01:25:55,363
- How long have you had these droids?
- Three or four seasons.

1392
01:25:55,443 --> 01:25:57,873
They're up for sale if you want them.

1393
01:25:57,943 --> 01:25:59,373
Let me see your identification.

1394
01:25:59,443 --> 01:26:01,773
You don't need to see
his identification.

1395
01:26:02,443 --> 01:26:04,383
I don't need to see
your identification.

1396
01:26:04,443 --> 01:26:06,883
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

1397
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:08,883
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

1398
01:26:08,953 --> 01:26:11,143
He can go about his business.

1399
01:26:11,223 --> 01:26:13,153
You can go about your business.

1400
01:26:13,823 --> 01:26:15,293
Move along.

1401
01:26:19,263 --> 01:26:20,923
Lucas, meanwhile...

1402
01:26:20,993 --> 01:26:22,933
was up to his neck
in malfunctioning props...

1403
01:26:23,363 --> 01:26:25,333
electronic breakdowns...

1404
01:26:25,403 --> 01:26:27,303
and other production woes.

1405
01:26:28,373 --> 01:26:32,033
Star Wars was already
struggling to stay on schedule.

1406
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:36,113
The only silver lining
was that after Tunisia...

1407
01:26:36,183 --> 01:26:39,113
the production would be moving to
a more controlled environment--

1408
01:26:39,183 --> 01:26:41,653
Elstree Studios outside London.

1409
01:26:43,123 --> 01:26:46,423
The stages at Elstree were among
the largest in the world...

1410
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:49,653
and the sets, now finished
after months of construction...

1411
01:26:49,723 --> 01:26:51,713
werejust as impressive.

1412
01:26:51,793 --> 01:26:55,893
For the first time,
the entire Star Wars cast was together.

1413
01:26:57,263 --> 01:26:59,363
That was almost like
a whole separate movie.

1414
01:26:59,433 --> 01:27:01,533
It was like getting
a whole, fresh start.

1415
01:27:01,603 --> 01:27:03,803
And it was all new, really.

1416
01:27:04,473 --> 01:27:07,503
We were all
very different ages.

1417
01:27:07,573 --> 01:27:09,873
I was 1 9, Harrison was 33.

1418
01:27:09,943 --> 01:27:12,843
He was sort of
the big man on campus.

1419
01:27:12,913 --> 01:27:17,183
Meeting him,you sort of felt,
''Well, he'll be a movie star. ''

1420
01:27:18,053 --> 01:27:21,153
Costumes, makeup,
robots and aliens...

1421
01:27:21,223 --> 01:27:23,853
were all ready to go.

1422
01:27:23,923 --> 01:27:29,593
I put that mask on
and Chewie transformed me.

1423
01:27:29,663 --> 01:27:33,103
I transformed.
The attitude was different.

1424
01:27:33,173 --> 01:27:35,963
The walk was different.
Chewie turned on.

1425
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:39,843
Do the scenes, come back,
take the mask off...

1426
01:27:39,913 --> 01:27:41,843
Peter was back.

1427
01:27:43,143 --> 01:27:44,473
Action.

1428
01:27:44,543 --> 01:27:46,573
That old man's mad.

1429
01:27:46,653 --> 01:27:48,583
You said it, Chewie.

1430
01:27:48,653 --> 01:27:51,283
Boy, where did you
dig up that old fossil?

1431
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:54,683
- Ben is a great man.
- Great at getting us into trouble.

1432
01:27:54,753 --> 01:27:56,953
I didn't hear you give any ideas.

1433
01:27:57,023 --> 01:27:58,423
Cut.

1434
01:28:02,503 --> 01:28:04,333
But working
at Elstree Studios...

1435
01:28:04,403 --> 01:28:07,263
didn't mean the production
was free from problems...

1436
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:09,703
or strict British union regulations.

1437
01:28:10,303 --> 01:28:12,773
At 5:30 we had to stop...

1438
01:28:12,843 --> 01:28:15,573
unless we were
in the middle of a shot.

1439
01:28:17,213 --> 01:28:20,153
I could ask the crew
for an extra 1 5 minutes...

1440
01:28:20,853 --> 01:28:22,783
but they always voted me down.

1441
01:28:23,453 --> 01:28:26,753
Not to put down the British crew, but
there was an attitude of''What's this?''

1442
01:28:27,423 --> 01:28:30,053
It didn't help that most
of the crew thought Star Wars...

1443
01:28:30,123 --> 01:28:32,063
was just a children's film.

1444
01:28:32,133 --> 01:28:36,153
At times even the actors were
hard-pressed to take the work seriously.

1445
01:28:36,903 --> 01:28:39,193
Didn't think it was gonna be any good.
At least I didn't.

1446
01:28:39,273 --> 01:28:41,133
I thought, ''This is a bit strange.''

1447
01:28:41,533 --> 01:28:43,403
I can remember
this lighting man--

1448
01:28:43,473 --> 01:28:47,933
He said, ''What is all this about?
It's a load of rubbish. ''

1449
01:28:48,013 --> 01:28:52,813
And we all thought the same at
the time-- ''Yeah, it's a bit strange.''

1450
01:28:52,883 --> 01:28:54,713
Action!

1451
01:28:55,213 --> 01:28:59,983
It was a princess with her hair
in weird buns on the side...

1452
01:29:00,053 --> 01:29:03,853
and a giant in a monkey suit
or something.

1453
01:29:03,923 --> 01:29:06,223
I mean,
it was very, very weird.

1454
01:29:06,663 --> 01:29:09,423
No more adventures!
I'm not getting involved!

1455
01:29:09,503 --> 01:29:12,993
Don't you call me a mindless philosopher
you overweight glob of grease!

1456
01:29:13,073 --> 01:29:14,563
Bang!

1457
01:29:15,773 --> 01:29:17,603
I'm going to regret this.

1458
01:29:17,673 --> 01:29:19,543
It was tough dialogue to say.

1459
01:29:19,613 --> 01:29:24,543
So I got, ''Governor Tarkin, I thought
I recognized your foul stench. ''

1460
01:29:24,613 --> 01:29:28,603
Which, I don't know about you,
but I'm always talking like that.

1461
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,573
Governor Tarkin.

1462
01:29:31,653 --> 01:29:34,553
I should have expected to find you
holding Vader's leash.

1463
01:29:34,623 --> 01:29:37,993
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

1464
01:29:38,063 --> 01:29:39,993
Charming to the last.

1465
01:29:40,063 --> 01:29:43,433
We used to say, ''You can type
this stuff, but you can't say it.''

1466
01:29:46,233 --> 01:29:49,173
George didn't really like
being in London...

1467
01:29:49,243 --> 01:29:51,503
I suppose,
is the best way to say it.

1468
01:29:51,573 --> 01:29:53,733
He doesn't like
being away from home.

1469
01:29:53,813 --> 01:29:55,743
He's not the most
gregarious person in the world.

1470
01:29:56,243 --> 01:29:58,443
He had some clashes
with the cameraman.

1471
01:29:58,513 --> 01:30:03,683
Gil Taylor was a very old-school
cameraman-- very crotchety.

1472
01:30:03,853 --> 01:30:07,513
George, coming out of
low-budget filmmaking...

1473
01:30:08,123 --> 01:30:10,063
was used to doing
a lot of things himself.

1474
01:30:10,123 --> 01:30:14,393
So George would say things like,
''Well, put a light here. ''

1475
01:30:14,463 --> 01:30:17,263
And Gil took offense
at that kind of thing.

1476
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:19,663
He says, ''That's not yourjob, son. ''

1477
01:30:20,733 --> 01:30:24,003
''You tell me what
you want to see, and I'll do it...

1478
01:30:24,073 --> 01:30:27,013
the way I think is best
to create what you want to see.''

1479
01:30:27,073 --> 01:30:29,303
It was a clash
of style of working.

1480
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:31,573
Slate 3 27, take four.

1481
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:33,643
We're coming up
on Alderaan.

1482
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:38,923
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

1483
01:30:38,993 --> 01:30:40,323
That's good.

1484
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,293
You've taken your first step
into a larger world.

1485
01:30:46,663 --> 01:30:48,633
Lucas also became frustrated...

1486
01:30:48,703 --> 01:30:51,823
that the costumes, sets
and other production elements...

1487
01:30:51,903 --> 01:30:54,703
weren't living up
to his vision for Star Wars.

1488
01:30:54,773 --> 01:30:58,263
The compromises required
due to the film's budget...

1489
01:30:58,343 --> 01:31:00,603
plagued him
on an almost daily basis.

1490
01:31:00,673 --> 01:31:03,303
What was disappointing
would be the cantina sequence.

1491
01:31:03,383 --> 01:31:06,313
It was really
imaginatively described...

1492
01:31:06,383 --> 01:31:08,313
and then you go in there...

1493
01:31:08,383 --> 01:31:10,143
and it looks like
The Nutcracker Suite.

1494
01:31:10,223 --> 01:31:12,953
There's a frog guy
and a mouse girl...

1495
01:31:14,453 --> 01:31:16,183
and a giant cricket at the bar.

1496
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:18,783
It was just really disappointing.

1497
01:31:19,393 --> 01:31:22,763
But George says, ''Don't worry.
We're gonna fix all of this. ''

1498
01:31:25,933 --> 01:31:30,103
We didn't see anything
of what ended up on the screen.

1499
01:31:30,173 --> 01:31:32,873
So when they blew my planet up...

1500
01:31:32,943 --> 01:31:36,643
I was looking at a guy going like this
against a board with a circle on it.

1501
01:31:36,713 --> 01:31:38,303
I mean, it was funny.

1502
01:31:38,383 --> 01:31:40,613
Proceed with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

1503
01:31:40,683 --> 01:31:41,483
What?

1504
01:31:41,553 --> 01:31:44,243
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

1505
01:31:44,323 --> 01:31:47,083
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

1506
01:31:50,593 --> 01:31:51,963
Bang!

1507
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:55,493
And you call yourselves humans.

1508
01:31:56,763 --> 01:31:58,253
George never talked.

1509
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:00,863
We felt he wanted us
to hit our marks...

1510
01:32:00,933 --> 01:32:03,373
and magically
accommodate our dialogue.

1511
01:32:03,443 --> 01:32:07,373
He lost his voice at one point.
We didn't know that for days.

1512
01:32:07,443 --> 01:32:10,203
And we wanted to get him
a little board that said...

1513
01:32:10,913 --> 01:32:12,613
''Faster and more intense.''

1514
01:32:12,683 --> 01:32:14,343
That was his main direction.

1515
01:32:14,753 --> 01:32:17,343
Hejust wanted us
to speed through it.

1516
01:32:17,423 --> 01:32:20,283
George is notorious
for saying, after a take...

1517
01:32:20,353 --> 01:32:22,343
''Do it again.
Faster, more intensity. ''

1518
01:32:22,593 --> 01:32:26,123
He certainly said to me, ''Terrific,
Tony. Can you do it again, faster?''

1519
01:32:26,793 --> 01:32:28,593
But I didn't get
''more intensity.''

1520
01:32:28,663 --> 01:32:31,533
I didn't think 3PO with more intensity
would be bearable. Do you?

1521
01:32:32,503 --> 01:32:35,703
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

1522
01:32:35,773 --> 01:32:38,433
The main entrance seems
to be the only way in or out.

1523
01:32:38,503 --> 01:32:40,903
We all had to fill in
a lot of the blanks.

1524
01:32:40,973 --> 01:32:44,933
It was more a matter of, if we did
something he didn't like he'd tell us...

1525
01:32:45,013 --> 01:32:48,213
rather than telling us what to do.

1526
01:32:48,283 --> 01:32:49,913
I think George likes people.

1527
01:32:49,983 --> 01:32:53,713
I think George
is a warmhearted person.

1528
01:32:53,793 --> 01:32:57,223
But, yeah, he's a little impatient
with the process of acting...

1529
01:32:57,293 --> 01:33:00,023
of finding something,
you know.

1530
01:33:00,093 --> 01:33:02,033
He thinks it's there.

1531
01:33:02,093 --> 01:33:04,033
''It's right there.
I wrote it down.'' You know?

1532
01:33:05,103 --> 01:33:10,763
''Do that.'' You know? And sometimes you
can't just ''do that'' and make it work.

1533
01:33:10,843 --> 01:33:13,973
He's really focused on what he's
trying to do and get everything right.

1534
01:33:14,043 --> 01:33:16,913
Is the smoke right?
Did the squibs go off right?

1535
01:33:17,683 --> 01:33:20,313
And we were just
taunting him mercilessly.

1536
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:23,953
Carrie and Mark have
wicked sense ofhumors.

1537
01:33:24,023 --> 01:33:25,953
Carrie was very young...

1538
01:33:26,023 --> 01:33:28,253
and Mark was very young...

1539
01:33:28,453 --> 01:33:30,253
so they were
the junior division...

1540
01:33:30,323 --> 01:33:33,763
and they were always
lurking about on set.

1541
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:36,693
So it kept us in stitches.

1542
01:33:36,763 --> 01:33:39,563
I got one outfit
for the first movie...

1543
01:33:39,633 --> 01:33:41,573
and as George taught me...

1544
01:33:41,633 --> 01:33:43,573
there is no underwear in space.

1545
01:33:43,643 --> 01:33:46,943
Instead of that,
there is gaffer tape.

1546
01:33:47,843 --> 01:33:50,143
So I was taped down.

1547
01:33:50,213 --> 01:33:54,413
And I used to say, we should just
make up a contest on the call sheet...

1548
01:33:54,483 --> 01:33:56,413
as to who's gonna rip it off.

1549
01:33:57,283 --> 01:33:58,913
But we didn't do that.

1550
01:33:58,993 --> 01:34:03,123
We were all goofing around
and trying to make George crack...

1551
01:34:03,193 --> 01:34:05,713
'cause he looked like
he was ready to burst into tears.

1552
01:34:06,463 --> 01:34:07,763
You'd try and cheer him up.

1553
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:09,323
Go.

1554
01:34:14,503 --> 01:34:16,163
- Okay, cut.
- Cut it.

1555
01:34:16,243 --> 01:34:17,733
- And?
- And?

1556
01:34:18,743 --> 01:34:20,673
Carrie and Mark bumped in too early.

1557
01:34:24,443 --> 01:34:26,103
The mike was in frame.

1558
01:34:27,013 --> 01:34:28,783
The mike was in picture.

1559
01:34:28,853 --> 01:34:30,783
The mike was in picture.

1560
01:34:32,853 --> 01:34:34,793
Go back to first positions.

1561
01:34:34,853 --> 01:34:36,793
The sound department
has to pay up.

1562
01:34:36,863 --> 01:34:39,793
That, to him, was really
inappropriate humor at the time...

1563
01:34:39,863 --> 01:34:42,853
because I'm sure he's in the zone
and seeing what he wants to do...

1564
01:34:42,933 --> 01:34:46,663
and we're just actors
trying to stave off boredom...

1565
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:50,693
because we've been in
the trash compactor all morning.

1566
01:34:50,773 --> 01:34:52,703
Ready? And action!

1567
01:34:53,413 --> 01:34:55,343
- What happened?
- I don't know!

1568
01:34:55,413 --> 01:34:57,383
It just disappeared!

1569
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,973
I got a really bad feeling
about this.

1570
01:35:01,453 --> 01:35:05,543
But it is amazing what you can do
when you have a vision, an ambition...

1571
01:35:05,623 --> 01:35:10,523
and when you can bend
other people's will to your desire.

1572
01:35:10,593 --> 01:35:13,523
The thing that kept it focused
towards the ambitions...

1573
01:35:13,593 --> 01:35:16,583
was George's vision
and his passion for the idea.

1574
01:35:18,433 --> 01:35:21,303
Perhaps the most memorable
stunt in Star Wars...

1575
01:35:21,373 --> 01:35:24,963
was actually performed
by Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher--

1576
01:35:25,043 --> 01:35:27,343
the nick-of-time escape
of Luke and Leia...

1577
01:35:27,413 --> 01:35:29,873
across a yawning chasm
in the Death Star.

1578
01:35:30,643 --> 01:35:32,843
Mark Hamill wanted to do
as much as he could himself.

1579
01:35:32,913 --> 01:35:36,643
I had times when I had to keep him back
because he was too enthusiastic.

1580
01:35:36,723 --> 01:35:38,213
He could've got hurt.

1581
01:35:38,283 --> 01:35:40,983
Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker
had to swing over this void.

1582
01:35:41,053 --> 01:35:44,993
We couldn't afford doubles, so I said,
''I can teach them. It'll be safe. ''

1583
01:35:45,063 --> 01:35:49,223
My buddy and I, we put the harnesses on,
we put the wires on.

1584
01:35:49,303 --> 01:35:51,923
Everyone down below.
Remember, we are about 20 meters up...

1585
01:35:52,003 --> 01:35:53,933
looking down on them.

1586
01:35:54,003 --> 01:35:57,273
And as we swung across
there was a terrible tear.

1587
01:35:58,003 --> 01:36:01,413
My buddy said to me,
''Peter, your harness has snapped.''

1588
01:36:01,473 --> 01:36:03,943
Mark said, ''I'm not going in that.
It's too dangerous. ''

1589
01:36:04,013 --> 01:36:06,843
This is where I discovered
you had to be a good liar.

1590
01:36:06,913 --> 01:36:10,513
I said, ''There's nothing wrong with the
harness. I split my pants as I landed. ''

1591
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:12,553
He said, ''Oh, I thought
that was the harness.''

1592
01:36:12,623 --> 01:36:14,953
I said, ''I wouldn't let you
do this if it was dangerous.''

1593
01:36:15,023 --> 01:36:16,513
Action!

1594
01:36:21,393 --> 01:36:24,663
They did it in one take,
and that's how we got it.

1595
01:36:25,233 --> 01:36:26,203
For luck.

1596
01:36:31,403 --> 01:36:33,703
That was really early on
in the shoot...

1597
01:36:34,413 --> 01:36:37,343
when I was still
worried about my weight.

1598
01:36:37,413 --> 01:36:41,013
I thought we were gonna miss
and I'd hit the wall...

1599
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:46,213
and they will say, ''Still too tubby.
Let's bring in Jodie Foster.''

1600
01:36:47,493 --> 01:36:49,583
Another of
Peter Diamond's tasks...

1601
01:36:49,663 --> 01:36:52,493
was choreographing
the dramatic lightsaber battle...

1602
01:36:52,563 --> 01:36:55,493
between Darth Vader
and Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1603
01:36:56,163 --> 01:36:58,103
You can't win, Darth.

1604
01:36:58,163 --> 01:37:01,623
If my blade should find its mark,
you will cease to exist.

1605
01:37:02,303 --> 01:37:04,743
But I warn you,
if you strike me down...

1606
01:37:04,803 --> 01:37:08,473
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1607
01:37:08,543 --> 01:37:11,173
George wanted a broadsword
type of fight...

1608
01:37:11,243 --> 01:37:13,343
with a touch ofJapanese behind it.

1609
01:37:13,413 --> 01:37:16,403
But instead of becoming
samurai moves with one hand...

1610
01:37:16,483 --> 01:37:18,423
I kept it with two hands...

1611
01:37:18,483 --> 01:37:21,543
so all the moves were two hands,
completely like that.

1612
01:37:22,723 --> 01:37:24,883
The first swords
were bits of wood...

1613
01:37:24,963 --> 01:37:27,393
with front-projection material
wrapped around them.

1614
01:37:27,463 --> 01:37:30,403
Now, the hardest thing for me
on the first fights--

1615
01:37:30,463 --> 01:37:33,023
Darth Vader was a very heavy man...

1616
01:37:33,103 --> 01:37:35,863
Obi-Wan Kenobi was
a gentleman, right...

1617
01:37:35,943 --> 01:37:39,393
who had done some fencing
in the theater.

1618
01:37:39,473 --> 01:37:42,103
I had to teach them,
if that was a sword...

1619
01:37:42,173 --> 01:37:44,703
to stop before they touched,
'cause the blades were breaking.

1620
01:37:44,783 --> 01:37:48,143
We broke so many blades.
They just kept snapping.

1621
01:37:53,753 --> 01:37:55,243
- Cut.
- Cut it!

1622
01:37:56,493 --> 01:38:00,823
Across the Atlantic, Fox's head
of production, Alan Ladd,Jr....

1623
01:38:00,893 --> 01:38:02,953
continued to offer Lucas his main...

1624
01:38:03,033 --> 01:38:05,293
if not his only,
support from the studio.

1625
01:38:05,973 --> 01:38:08,093
There was a lot of problems,yes.

1626
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:12,133
Every board meeting I attended,
the subject was always Star Wars.

1627
01:38:12,203 --> 01:38:15,303
''The costs are rising.
It's this, it's that.

1628
01:38:15,373 --> 01:38:17,603
Look, we've read drafts of scripts...

1629
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:20,543
that make no sense to us
in any way, shape or form. ''

1630
01:38:20,613 --> 01:38:22,603
It was rather unpleasant.

1631
01:38:23,423 --> 01:38:26,353
The things that stick in my mind
that made me laugh were, like...

1632
01:38:26,423 --> 01:38:29,443
memos worried about whether or not
the Wookiee should have pants.

1633
01:38:29,523 --> 01:38:31,183
They're looking at this thing
and saying...

1634
01:38:31,263 --> 01:38:33,663
''Couldn't he have some lederhosen?''

1635
01:38:33,893 --> 01:38:37,733
And I thought,
''Isn't this great?

1636
01:38:37,803 --> 01:38:40,263
You know, of all the things
to worry about.

1637
01:38:40,333 --> 01:38:42,273
The Wookiee has no pants.''

1638
01:38:44,003 --> 01:38:45,973
I think we were
two weeks over schedule.

1639
01:38:46,043 --> 01:38:50,033
At that point, the board of directors
at Fox started to panic...

1640
01:38:50,343 --> 01:38:55,913
and tell Alan Ladd,Jr. that he had to
shut that film down regardless.

1641
01:38:55,983 --> 01:38:58,073
So he came to me and said...

1642
01:38:58,153 --> 01:39:00,683
''Look, you've gotta finish
in the next week...

1643
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:04,853
because I've got another board meeting,
and I can't say we're still shooting.''

1644
01:39:05,863 --> 01:39:09,893
I kept phoning their production
department saying, ''This is insane.

1645
01:39:10,163 --> 01:39:13,963
If we put on a second crew, it costs us
more than going an extra week.''

1646
01:39:14,033 --> 01:39:16,373
They said, ''It doesn't matter.
The studio's opinion...

1647
01:39:16,443 --> 01:39:19,503
is that the day deadline is more
important than the money you spend.''

1648
01:39:20,043 --> 01:39:22,803
The final scenes were filmed
at breakneck speed...

1649
01:39:22,883 --> 01:39:24,743
with Lucas
frantically bicycling...

1650
01:39:24,813 --> 01:39:27,373
from one soundstage to another.

1651
01:39:27,453 --> 01:39:31,783
I think George suffered a lot more
than I was aware of at the time.

1652
01:39:31,853 --> 01:39:33,943
But I was very focused
on what I was doing...

1653
01:39:34,023 --> 01:39:37,823
'cause this was a very busy movie,
just nonstop dawn to dusk.

1654
01:39:37,893 --> 01:39:39,883
We did go over at the end...

1655
01:39:39,963 --> 01:39:42,763
and we split into three units
right at the end.

1656
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:45,063
Gary directed the second unit...

1657
01:39:45,133 --> 01:39:49,463
and I had the distinction of directing
the third unit of Star Wars.

1658
01:39:49,543 --> 01:39:54,273
My shots were things like close-up
of R2-D2's third foot going down.

1659
01:39:54,943 --> 01:39:58,073
Nothing too dramatic.
But that's how we finished it.

1660
01:39:58,143 --> 01:39:59,633
Come on.

1661
01:40:01,313 --> 01:40:04,013
Okay, cut. Time up. Cut.

1662
01:40:04,523 --> 01:40:07,973
I hope that old man got the tractor beam
down, or this is gonna be a short trip.

1663
01:40:08,053 --> 01:40:09,823
Hit it!

1664
01:40:09,893 --> 01:40:14,793
Fox originally slated Star Wars
for a Christmas release in 1 976.

1665
01:40:14,863 --> 01:40:16,023
Schmuck.

1666
01:40:16,263 --> 01:40:18,233
463, take one.

1667
01:40:18,303 --> 01:40:21,793
But the diffiicult shoot had put
the film severely behind schedule.

1668
01:40:21,873 --> 01:40:23,363
Action.

1669
01:40:23,443 --> 01:40:26,003
- Didn't we just leave this party?
- Give us a growl.

1670
01:40:28,013 --> 01:40:30,103
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1671
01:40:30,183 --> 01:40:32,583
- Is the ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1672
01:40:32,653 --> 01:40:35,513
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

1673
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:37,613
- Look.
- Now's our chance. Go!

1674
01:40:38,383 --> 01:40:40,443
With barely six months to go...

1675
01:40:40,523 --> 01:40:43,453
there was almost no chance
of delivering the project on time.

1676
01:40:43,523 --> 01:40:44,723
Okay, cut.

1677
01:40:44,793 --> 01:40:47,783
I hadjust finished shooting the movie,
and I was exhausted, basically...

1678
01:40:47,863 --> 01:40:52,663
but I had to go right from the shooting
into the finishing without a break.

1679
01:40:53,633 --> 01:40:56,163
Already anxious
about meeting his deadline...

1680
01:40:56,243 --> 01:41:00,173
Lucas was shocked when he saw the first
assembly ofhis edited film that spring.

1681
01:41:00,243 --> 01:41:02,373
Sir, the groiters are losing power!

1682
01:41:02,443 --> 01:41:04,773
All right. I'll get it.

1683
01:41:05,443 --> 01:41:09,243
The first cut of Star Wars
was an unmitigated disaster.

1684
01:41:09,323 --> 01:41:11,683
- How's that?
- Yes, that's much better.

1685
01:41:11,753 --> 01:41:14,583
I'd started to see things cut together.
I wasn't happy with it.

1686
01:41:14,653 --> 01:41:17,853
I'd come in on weekends,
and I'd recut the film on my own.

1687
01:41:17,923 --> 01:41:19,623
Cut.

1688
01:41:19,693 --> 01:41:21,683
And I tried to get the editor
to cut it my way...

1689
01:41:21,763 --> 01:41:25,293
and he didn't really want to,
and so I had to let the editor go.

1690
01:41:25,363 --> 01:41:27,803
So I had no editor.
I was behind schedule.

1691
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:29,803
I had to race to finish the movie.

1692
01:41:29,873 --> 01:41:31,803
1 77, take two.

1693
01:41:31,873 --> 01:41:35,273
Lucas realized his only hope
was to start from scratch.

1694
01:41:35,343 --> 01:41:39,143
And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1695
01:41:39,213 --> 01:41:41,873
And this is
my counterpart, R2-D2.

1696
01:41:41,953 --> 01:41:44,183
- Oh, hello.
- Okay, cut.

1697
01:41:45,123 --> 01:41:48,853
To recut the movie, he hired
Paul Hirsch and Richard Chew...

1698
01:41:48,923 --> 01:41:52,363
and for several months he was able
to borrow his wife, Marcia...

1699
01:41:52,423 --> 01:41:55,763
who was editing New York, New York
with Martin Scorsese.

1700
01:41:57,433 --> 01:41:59,423
Slate 250, take seven.

1701
01:41:59,503 --> 01:42:00,493
Action.

1702
01:42:01,703 --> 01:42:04,603
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

1703
01:42:09,343 --> 01:42:11,283
Right now
I don't feel too good.

1704
01:42:11,343 --> 01:42:13,903
On Star Wars,
the trio's first task...

1705
01:42:13,983 --> 01:42:17,643
was to give the film an energy
and pace that was sorely lacking.

1706
01:42:17,723 --> 01:42:18,713
Cut.

1707
01:42:18,783 --> 01:42:24,353
It was cut in a very traditional manner
ofjust playing things out in masters...

1708
01:42:24,423 --> 01:42:26,793
and then going
into the coverage...

1709
01:42:26,863 --> 01:42:31,133
and let the actors'rhythms
dictate the cuts...

1710
01:42:31,203 --> 01:42:33,133
rather than having the cuts...

1711
01:42:33,203 --> 01:42:36,633
kind of drive the rhythm of the scenes.

1712
01:42:37,103 --> 01:42:39,043
21 1 , take three.
Guide track.

1713
01:42:40,643 --> 01:42:42,113
Action!

1714
01:42:44,143 --> 01:42:46,673
So consequently,
there wasn't any excitement...

1715
01:42:46,753 --> 01:42:49,943
in the footage the way
that it had been put together.

1716
01:42:50,023 --> 01:42:51,483
Cut.

1717
01:42:51,553 --> 01:42:53,283
Richard and I would leapfrog.

1718
01:42:53,693 --> 01:42:57,423
If he was on reel one,
I would grab reel two.

1719
01:42:57,493 --> 01:42:59,923
Whoever finished that would
grab reel three and so forth.

1720
01:43:10,843 --> 01:43:14,403
We used shots up until
the very last frame.

1721
01:43:14,473 --> 01:43:16,813
- Cut.
- Can I take another one?

1722
01:43:16,883 --> 01:43:20,943
Very often, the very next frame would be
the flash of the camera stop.

1723
01:43:21,883 --> 01:43:24,543
For instance, there's a shot
of one of the Sandpeople...

1724
01:43:24,623 --> 01:43:28,553
who knocks Luke down, and then
he holds his weapon up over his head.

1725
01:43:28,623 --> 01:43:32,423
He did it once. We rocked it back and
forth so he did it a number of times.

1726
01:43:38,163 --> 01:43:41,463
The only things that are there
is what's presentable...

1727
01:43:41,533 --> 01:43:44,533
and everything
behind the scenes is a mess.

1728
01:43:45,843 --> 01:43:49,273
With no chance
ofbeing ready by Christmas...

1729
01:43:49,343 --> 01:43:52,403
a new release date
was set for summer, 1 977.

1730
01:43:52,483 --> 01:43:55,113
Some doubted that the movie
would ever reach theaters.

1731
01:43:55,553 --> 01:43:58,113
But as bad as things
had been with the editing...

1732
01:43:58,183 --> 01:44:00,673
the situation at ILM
was even worse.

1733
01:44:01,393 --> 01:44:05,223
The company was trying to create effects
that had never been done before.

1734
01:44:05,293 --> 01:44:07,263
They knew what they
wanted to accomplish...

1735
01:44:07,333 --> 01:44:10,303
but they had yet to create
anything usable for the film.

1736
01:44:10,363 --> 01:44:12,303
They had spent half their budget...

1737
01:44:12,973 --> 01:44:16,233
and ultimately I had about four shots,
none of which I would accept.

1738
01:44:16,303 --> 01:44:19,603
They were just not good.
That was a low point.

1739
01:44:20,043 --> 01:44:24,003
I had no special effects. I didn't know
if we were gonna get the ships to work.

1740
01:44:24,083 --> 01:44:26,013
So it was a pretty desperate time.

1741
01:44:26,083 --> 01:44:29,413
And we'd spent half the budget
building the motion-control cameras...

1742
01:44:29,483 --> 01:44:31,283
and setting the shop up.

1743
01:44:31,353 --> 01:44:34,983
It was a disaster to say the least.

1744
01:44:36,153 --> 01:44:37,683
The factory has to be built...

1745
01:44:37,763 --> 01:44:41,193
before the first can of peas
can be sent to the supermarket.

1746
01:44:41,263 --> 01:44:43,393
And I think it was a year or more...

1747
01:44:43,603 --> 01:44:47,223
without any film coming out,
without one shot being finished.

1748
01:44:47,303 --> 01:44:49,863
'Cause they were building
optical printers and cameras.

1749
01:44:50,543 --> 01:44:52,333
We were building models.

1750
01:44:52,403 --> 01:44:54,873
I know that George was
disappointed in the work...

1751
01:44:54,943 --> 01:44:57,973
and I'm disappointed
that he was disappointed.

1752
01:44:58,443 --> 01:45:01,473
But there's a certain subjectivity
to some of that stuff.

1753
01:45:01,553 --> 01:45:05,953
I wish he'd been happier,
but I also think that ultimately...

1754
01:45:06,023 --> 01:45:07,953
the work did thejob.

1755
01:45:17,633 --> 01:45:22,033
When word of the postproduction problems
reached the Fox board of directors...

1756
01:45:22,103 --> 01:45:26,203
they decided they'd had enough of
George Lucas and ''that science movie. ''

1757
01:45:26,873 --> 01:45:29,933
I just sat in one
executive committee meeting...

1758
01:45:30,013 --> 01:45:31,943
where they're hauling me
over the coals.

1759
01:45:32,013 --> 01:45:34,313
I just said,
''It's the greatest picture ever made.''

1760
01:45:34,383 --> 01:45:36,313
That ended the conversation.

1761
01:45:36,383 --> 01:45:40,653
They were afraid to say,
''Well,you're stupid and you're wrong...

1762
01:45:40,723 --> 01:45:43,753
and we want you out of this building
by 5:00 this afternoon. ''

1763
01:45:46,993 --> 01:45:48,983
There were some tense moments there.

1764
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:51,763
With the dismal
early cut of the film...

1765
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:55,273
ILM in chaos and growing pressure
from the studio...

1766
01:45:55,333 --> 01:45:59,603
Lucas was facing almost
unbearable battles on a daily basis.

1767
01:46:00,143 --> 01:46:02,943
After an especially
tense trip to ILM...

1768
01:46:03,013 --> 01:46:05,443
Lucas felt sharp chest pains.

1769
01:46:05,513 --> 01:46:09,503
Fearing a heart attack, the director
checked into a Marin County hospital.

1770
01:46:09,583 --> 01:46:12,783
He was diagnosed with
hypertension and exhaustion...

1771
01:46:12,853 --> 01:46:14,983
and was warned
to reduce his stress level.

1772
01:46:15,053 --> 01:46:17,043
At that point, I really felt...

1773
01:46:18,163 --> 01:46:21,523
I'd gotten myself into a real mess and
didn't know whether I was gonna get out.

1774
01:46:22,063 --> 01:46:24,763
Lucas doubled his efforts
to save Star Wars.

1775
01:46:25,433 --> 01:46:28,763
The situation at ILM
required drastic measures.

1776
01:46:28,833 --> 01:46:31,773
To get the film's crucial
special effects back on track...

1777
01:46:31,843 --> 01:46:35,303
Lucas had no choice
but to step in personally.

1778
01:46:35,373 --> 01:46:38,103
We put a production department in
at the special effects company.

1779
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:39,673
I went there twice a week.

1780
01:46:39,753 --> 01:46:42,153
There was a certain amount
of resentment at first...

1781
01:46:42,213 --> 01:46:44,743
because they felt...

1782
01:46:44,823 --> 01:46:48,723
that they were being challenged a bit
on how they had set it up.

1783
01:46:48,793 --> 01:46:52,723
We felt that there was a certain
quasi-hippie mentality...

1784
01:46:52,793 --> 01:46:55,393
that some of them had
about the schedule.

1785
01:46:55,463 --> 01:46:57,693
Ultimately, I guess
we were known as a country club.

1786
01:46:57,763 --> 01:47:00,863
I think it looked to those guys
that there needed to be...

1787
01:47:00,933 --> 01:47:03,593
a really strong
production force in there...

1788
01:47:03,673 --> 01:47:07,133
that was going to meet
some sort of quota.

1789
01:47:10,943 --> 01:47:13,313
With hundreds of shots
left to be completed...

1790
01:47:13,383 --> 01:47:17,343
ILM would have to do a year's worth
of work in just six months.

1791
01:47:17,423 --> 01:47:20,323
But Lucas and Kurtz were determined
to turn the situation around.

1792
01:47:25,823 --> 01:47:28,493
Gary was a gearhead,
so he could understand our problems.

1793
01:47:28,563 --> 01:47:31,323
And George is a storyteller...

1794
01:47:31,403 --> 01:47:33,863
and so we have to serve his needs...

1795
01:47:33,933 --> 01:47:36,493
because he's the one
that's telling the story.

1796
01:47:36,573 --> 01:47:39,503
But we had to build these incredible
contraptions in order to do it.

1797
01:47:41,743 --> 01:47:43,943
George was our general.
We're his soldiers.

1798
01:47:44,013 --> 01:47:46,573
And we're all
fighting this single battle...

1799
01:47:46,653 --> 01:47:48,313
to get this film out.

1800
01:47:48,383 --> 01:47:49,853
We were on the front lines...

1801
01:47:50,023 --> 01:47:53,473
and that gave us also
kind of a feeling of being special...

1802
01:47:53,553 --> 01:47:58,113
and fighting this great battle
to get this thing done, whatever it is.

1803
01:48:02,063 --> 01:48:03,553
Luke, pull up.!

1804
01:48:05,133 --> 01:48:07,463
To help inspire
the effects team at ILM...

1805
01:48:07,873 --> 01:48:11,893
Lucas had spliced together aerial
dogfights from old war movies.

1806
01:48:11,973 --> 01:48:15,243
That would be like the first animatic,
which you do in the computer now...

1807
01:48:15,313 --> 01:48:19,003
and we matched frame to frame and
the action on that as close as we could.

1808
01:48:23,183 --> 01:48:24,983
It was hugely helpful.

1809
01:48:26,953 --> 01:48:30,293
- I got him.!
- Great, kid! Don't get cocky.

1810
01:48:30,363 --> 01:48:34,593
To describe that abstract world
of a battle is impossible.

1811
01:48:34,663 --> 01:48:38,323
Storyboards don't do it, as far as the
pacing, the rhythms that he needed.

1812
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:44,203
- Thanks, Wedge.
- That was great.

1813
01:48:53,983 --> 01:48:57,643
As fall turned to winter, Star Wars
finally started to take shape.

1814
01:48:57,723 --> 01:48:59,123
That's it! We did it!

1815
01:48:59,183 --> 01:49:00,553
We did it!

1816
01:49:01,593 --> 01:49:04,113
Working from
the raw production tracks...

1817
01:49:05,363 --> 01:49:09,293
sound designer Ben Burtt would add
a critical new layer to the film.

1818
01:49:10,163 --> 01:49:12,653
Burtt had spent a year
building a catalog of sounds...

1819
01:49:12,733 --> 01:49:15,293
for things that didn't exist
in our galaxy.

1820
01:49:18,573 --> 01:49:22,673
George introduced the idea of what
he called an ''organic sound track. ''

1821
01:49:22,743 --> 01:49:26,873
George thought that Chewbacca
might be made up...

1822
01:49:26,953 --> 01:49:29,883
from recordings of dogs
or maybe even bears.

1823
01:49:29,953 --> 01:49:35,013
In addition, I recorded some lions
and tigers and even some walruses.

1824
01:49:36,893 --> 01:49:39,293
I would begin
editing them together...

1825
01:49:39,363 --> 01:49:42,093
and making little phrases
out of the noises.

1826
01:49:42,163 --> 01:49:44,393
I would take the recordings
and edit the best pieces.

1827
01:49:47,333 --> 01:49:49,703
You know, the bear might make
a sound that sounded angry.

1828
01:49:51,373 --> 01:49:53,063
Or they might make a sound
that was cute.

1829
01:49:57,043 --> 01:50:00,913
Or a sound like a sentence--
a ''wah, wah'' kind of a sound.

1830
01:50:03,153 --> 01:50:04,843
You said it, Chewie.

1831
01:50:04,923 --> 01:50:08,483
The voice of R2 turned out to be
the most difficult problem to solve...

1832
01:50:08,553 --> 01:50:10,493
in the sound design
of the first movie...

1833
01:50:11,493 --> 01:50:14,793
because R2 had to act
alongside of the other actors.

1834
01:50:14,863 --> 01:50:17,063
And the script only said...

1835
01:50:17,133 --> 01:50:20,193
that R2 made a sound,
or maybe R2 beeped.

1836
01:50:21,003 --> 01:50:23,763
I had a small
electronic synthesizer...

1837
01:50:23,843 --> 01:50:27,273
and I did some patches with it
and made up some electronic sounds.

1838
01:50:27,343 --> 01:50:29,273
But that didn't sound alive.

1839
01:50:29,343 --> 01:50:32,003
At one point we talked
about R2's personality...

1840
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:36,173
and we felt he was developing
kind of as a toddler.

1841
01:50:37,883 --> 01:50:39,823
So I did a lot
ofbaby recordings...

1842
01:50:39,893 --> 01:50:43,653
and eventually we found that
in the discussion of R2's voice...

1843
01:50:43,723 --> 01:50:45,663
we were making
the sounds ourselves.

1844
01:50:47,393 --> 01:50:51,693
A few experiments led to
the combination of using my voice...

1845
01:50:51,763 --> 01:50:54,133
doing baby talk--
beeps and boops--

1846
01:50:56,033 --> 01:50:58,303
with the electronic synthesizer.

1847
01:50:58,373 --> 01:51:01,703
So R2 is sort of 50% machine
and 50% organic...

1848
01:51:02,113 --> 01:51:05,343
coming out of
the performance of a person.

1849
01:51:07,313 --> 01:51:12,383
The breathing for Vader was recorded
by putting a little tiny microphone...

1850
01:51:12,453 --> 01:51:15,153
down inside
a regulator on a scuba tank.

1851
01:51:17,493 --> 01:51:22,223
I breathed through the mask itself,
and it breathed in and out...

1852
01:51:22,293 --> 01:51:25,993
and out of that came the various
paces of Vader breathing.

1853
01:51:27,403 --> 01:51:30,103
And that sound worked out
pretty successfully.

1854
01:51:34,143 --> 01:51:37,633
Finding the right voice for Darth Vader
was another challenge.

1855
01:51:38,343 --> 01:51:40,073
And action!

1856
01:51:40,153 --> 01:51:44,453
Lucas never intended to use the on-set
vocal performance of David Prowse.

1857
01:51:45,753 --> 01:51:49,413
Start tearing this ship apart, piece
by piece, until you find those tapes!

1858
01:51:49,493 --> 01:51:52,653
Find the passengers in this vessel!
I want them alive!

1859
01:51:52,723 --> 01:51:55,163
I can still hear
David Prowse's accent...

1860
01:51:55,663 --> 01:51:59,263
in the Darth Vader mask, muffled,
'cause he would do the real dialogue...

1861
01:51:59,333 --> 01:52:01,603
in trying to curse
Carrie Fisher or something.

1862
01:52:01,673 --> 01:52:03,333
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1863
01:52:03,403 --> 01:52:05,773
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission--

1864
01:52:05,843 --> 01:52:10,103
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor. Take her away!

1865
01:52:10,183 --> 01:52:12,543
It was hilarious and terrifying
at the same time...

1866
01:52:12,613 --> 01:52:14,583
'cause we didn't know
what Darth sounded like.

1867
01:52:14,653 --> 01:52:17,773
That was the first time we heard him.
We were like, ''Is that it?

1868
01:52:17,853 --> 01:52:20,343
Is he gonna be some Scottish guy,
or what is this?''

1869
01:52:20,953 --> 01:52:25,323
Prowse's voice would later be replaced
with a more menacing performance...

1870
01:52:25,393 --> 01:52:30,093
provided by classically trained
stage and film actorJames Earl Jones.

1871
01:52:30,803 --> 01:52:33,923
George had hired David Prowse...

1872
01:52:34,273 --> 01:52:37,103
but he said he wanted
a so-called ''darker'' voice.

1873
01:52:37,173 --> 01:52:41,433
Not in terms of ethnic,
but in terms of timbre.

1874
01:52:42,113 --> 01:52:44,843
The rumor is that he thought
of Orson Welles...

1875
01:52:46,143 --> 01:52:50,343
and then probably thought that Orson
might be too recognizable.

1876
01:52:51,023 --> 01:52:54,983
So what he ends up is picking
a voice that was born in Mississippi...

1877
01:52:55,053 --> 01:52:57,213
raised in Michigan, and was a stutterer.

1878
01:52:58,223 --> 01:53:00,853
And that happened
to be my voice.

1879
01:53:00,933 --> 01:53:03,833
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

1880
01:53:03,903 --> 01:53:05,893
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1881
01:53:05,963 --> 01:53:09,403
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

1882
01:53:09,473 --> 01:53:12,333
You are part of
the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.

1883
01:53:12,403 --> 01:53:13,933
Take her away!

1884
01:53:14,173 --> 01:53:18,613
C-3PO's voice struck us all as
''We've got to do something about that.''

1885
01:53:18,683 --> 01:53:20,803
Thirty-four, take three.

1886
01:53:20,883 --> 01:53:23,913
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

1887
01:53:23,983 --> 01:53:26,043
It was mentioned
a number of times...

1888
01:53:26,123 --> 01:53:28,643
that C-3PO might sound
like a used car salesman.

1889
01:53:28,723 --> 01:53:30,783
Not the English butler type.

1890
01:53:30,863 --> 01:53:33,383
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I must have fallen over.

1891
01:53:33,763 --> 01:53:39,393
I just came up with this voice
of an over-the-top British butler.

1892
01:53:40,073 --> 01:53:43,003
British because that would
be my natural mode of thinking.

1893
01:53:43,073 --> 01:53:46,443
A butler because
that was his role in life.

1894
01:53:46,503 --> 01:53:49,673
Nervous because that
was his feeling in life.

1895
01:53:49,743 --> 01:53:52,943
And it came as, ''C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.''

1896
01:53:53,013 --> 01:53:55,343
This is my counterpart,
R2-D2.

1897
01:53:56,053 --> 01:53:57,613
Hello.

1898
01:53:57,683 --> 01:53:59,813
A few people
were brought in to record...

1899
01:53:59,883 --> 01:54:02,653
and an attempt was made
to see how 3PO would be...

1900
01:54:02,723 --> 01:54:04,653
with different kinds of voices.

1901
01:54:04,723 --> 01:54:08,453
I believe 30 actors coming,
and some really quite impressive names.

1902
01:54:08,533 --> 01:54:11,983
Stan Freberg and a few others
were auditioned.

1903
01:54:12,063 --> 01:54:15,503
Apparently one of them
was a major cartoon actor...

1904
01:54:15,573 --> 01:54:18,563
a man of literally a thousand voices,
who eventually said...

1905
01:54:18,643 --> 01:54:22,203
''You know something, George, Tony's
voice is pretty good for the character.

1906
01:54:22,273 --> 01:54:24,213
Why don't you
just use his voice?''

1907
01:54:24,283 --> 01:54:27,073
And eventually the discussion
just quieted down...

1908
01:54:27,153 --> 01:54:29,203
and it was an
excellent performance.

1909
01:54:29,283 --> 01:54:31,413
It synchronized
with his body motions.

1910
01:54:31,483 --> 01:54:33,713
It was a total character
which he created.

1911
01:54:33,793 --> 01:54:35,723
His track was left in the movie.

1912
01:54:36,393 --> 01:54:39,853
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

1913
01:54:39,923 --> 01:54:42,893
Your droids-- they'll have to wait
outside. We don't want them here.

1914
01:54:42,963 --> 01:54:45,123
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

1915
01:54:45,203 --> 01:54:46,863
I heartily agree with you, sir.

1916
01:54:49,773 --> 01:54:50,793
Cut.

1917
01:54:50,873 --> 01:54:52,803
428, take seven.

1918
01:54:52,873 --> 01:54:54,203
Action.

1919
01:54:54,273 --> 01:54:57,113
Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

1920
01:55:00,713 --> 01:55:02,943
At long last,
the editing, sound...

1921
01:55:03,753 --> 01:55:05,843
and visual effects
were taking shape.

1922
01:55:08,023 --> 01:55:11,893
But a private screening of the film
for Lucas's closest friends...

1923
01:55:11,963 --> 01:55:14,083
didn't do much
to bolster his confidence.

1924
01:55:15,263 --> 01:55:20,363
It was an early stage, you know,
sort of a second or third cut.

1925
01:55:20,773 --> 01:55:23,793
I had a couple of my friends
come up to see it.

1926
01:55:23,873 --> 01:55:26,203
Brian De Palma was in town.
Steven came.

1927
01:55:26,273 --> 01:55:28,363
Some other friends
came to see it.

1928
01:55:28,443 --> 01:55:30,673
The human characters
and the sets were there...

1929
01:55:30,843 --> 01:55:35,803
but, of course, all the spectacular--
you know, the Death Star fight...

1930
01:55:36,483 --> 01:55:38,383
and the battle inside the trench...

1931
01:55:38,453 --> 01:55:42,113
and all that was just...
not even there to be seen.

1932
01:55:45,193 --> 01:55:48,023
So, the reaction was not
a good one. I loved the movie.

1933
01:55:48,093 --> 01:55:50,693
I was one of the only people
in the audience that liked the movie.

1934
01:55:50,763 --> 01:55:54,633
All my friends were very honest:
''I don't get it. What are you doing?''

1935
01:55:54,703 --> 01:55:57,173
That was basically
the tenor of the whole thing.

1936
01:55:57,243 --> 01:55:59,403
On the other hand,
the studio and Laddie...

1937
01:55:59,473 --> 01:56:01,703
and his little group
saw the film.

1938
01:56:01,773 --> 01:56:05,403
They loved it. It was the first time
I've actually shown a film...

1939
01:56:05,483 --> 01:56:08,143
and one of the executives
even cried at the screening.

1940
01:56:08,213 --> 01:56:09,913
It was very emotional for him.

1941
01:56:11,123 --> 01:56:15,753
I sat my family round
the kitchen table in my house...

1942
01:56:15,823 --> 01:56:18,193
and I said, ''The most extraordinary
day of my life...

1943
01:56:18,593 --> 01:56:22,253
has just taken place,
and I want you to remember this day.

1944
01:56:23,193 --> 01:56:25,723
Because this is what I never dreamed--
or maybe I dreamed--

1945
01:56:25,803 --> 01:56:28,463
but I never thought I would have
a day's experience...

1946
01:56:28,533 --> 01:56:30,903
like the day I've had today
in seeing this film.''

1947
01:56:30,973 --> 01:56:33,873
I couldn't even believe it.

1948
01:56:33,943 --> 01:56:36,813
At that point I was used to studio
chiefs saying, ''This is terrible.

1949
01:56:36,873 --> 01:56:39,003
You shouldn't show this to
an audience. Embarrassing.''

1950
01:56:39,683 --> 01:56:44,413
So, it was very rewarding to show it to
people, even though it was in bad shape.

1951
01:56:44,483 --> 01:56:49,393
It didn't help that one critical
element in Star Wars was still missing--

1952
01:56:49,453 --> 01:56:50,393
There's no lock.

1953
01:56:52,063 --> 01:56:54,023
the musical score.

1954
01:56:54,693 --> 01:56:57,323
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

1955
01:56:57,403 --> 01:57:00,633
-Find the controls to extend the bridge.
-I think I just blasted it.

1956
01:57:00,703 --> 01:57:02,503
They're coming through!

1957
01:57:03,403 --> 01:57:07,903
I remember bugging George.
''When can we hear the score?''

1958
01:57:08,643 --> 01:57:11,133
Fortunately, Lucas was able
to recruit...

1959
01:57:11,213 --> 01:57:15,153
one of the industry's most accomplished
composers,John Williams.

1960
01:57:15,813 --> 01:57:19,443
Williams had recently won an Oscar
for Steven Spielberg's Jaws...

1961
01:57:20,123 --> 01:57:23,953
and his resume included countless film
and television scores...

1962
01:57:24,623 --> 01:57:28,293
including music for the original
Lost in Space television series.

1963
01:57:30,263 --> 01:57:33,493
I do remember George
talking about the fact...

1964
01:57:33,563 --> 01:57:36,033
that what we were going to see
in the film...

1965
01:57:36,103 --> 01:57:38,263
represents worlds
that we hadn't seen...

1966
01:57:38,943 --> 01:57:42,303
but that the music should give us
some kind of an emotional anchor.

1967
01:57:44,443 --> 01:57:47,933
We heard a romantic melody
for Princess Leia.

1968
01:57:48,013 --> 01:57:51,743
We heard bellicose music
for the battle scenes.

1969
01:57:54,723 --> 01:57:58,853
And some very heavy
declamatory thing for Darth Vader.

1970
01:58:02,233 --> 01:58:03,923
In March, 1 977...

1971
01:58:04,003 --> 01:58:06,933
John Williams led
the London Symphony Orchestra...

1972
01:58:07,003 --> 01:58:09,833
in the performance
of the Star Wars soundtrack.

1973
01:58:09,903 --> 01:58:12,613
Recorded over 1 2 days, it was
a sweeping symphonic masterpiece...

1974
01:58:12,617 --> 01:58:16,557
one of the few things to actually
exceed Lucas's expectations.
