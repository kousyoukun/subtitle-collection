1
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,479
The heat wave continues.
It's 109 degrees in Los Angeles.

2
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,735
As drought-ridden Los Angeles
swelters in agonizing heat,

3
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,655
drug lords wage bloody
warfare in the streets.

4
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:57,409
Yet another open conflict...
Fuck this! Get me out of here!

5
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,796
We're in a war zone, Dave, two
motorcycle officers

6
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,215
horribly wounded
in a deadly crossfire,

7
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,467
the police seemingly
unable to rescue them

8
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,387
in spite of several desperate,
heroic attempts.

9
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,056
It's completely out of
control down here.

10
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,483
My beautiful cantina, everything
I own, they shot it to pieces.

11
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,987
My microwave, my automatic
steamer, my grill...

12
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,905
You fucking pendejos!

13
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,483
Fuck you!

14
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,365
Tony Pope, live with Hard Core,
on the scene and in your face.

15
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,617
It's like Dante's hell
down here.

16
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,535
Smoke, fire, oppressive heat,

17
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,538
as Colombian and Jamaican
drug fiends once again

18
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,708
transform the streets of
LA into a slaughterhouse.

19
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,170
Who the hell's in charge down here?
The cops?

20
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,465
They're outmanned,
outgunned and incompetent.

21
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,593
Mr. Mayor, on vacation
in your home in Lake Tahoe,

22
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,013
get off your butt, get down
here and declare martial law!

23
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,750
Okay, don't keep me
in suspense, Danny boy!

24
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,086
It has not been a nice day!

25
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:18,091
Two motors pulled over a truck, stumbled
right in the middle of a narc stakeout.

26
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,344
You know, ten Colombians and
Scorpios armed to fuck all.

27
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,305
They're trying to get
inside their headquarters.

28
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,893
We're keeping them pinned down, but
those officers are bleeding to death.

29
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,354
Fuck! They're dying, man.

30
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,691
Where the hell is
Special Weapons?

31
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,693
They're still tied up in that
shootout in San Pedro

32
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,903
getting their ass kicked
by the Jamaicans.

33
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,572
They shot down
one of our choppers.

34
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,699
And Mills and Johnson won't
last much longer out there.

35
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,160
We need an assault
vehicle to go get 'em.

36
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,370
I'm gonna chat
with these assholes.

37
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,247
Okay, when I give a signal,
give me some cover!

38
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,373
Got it!

39
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,017
Too small.

40
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,603
Right.

41
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,765
Come on! Come on!

42
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,601
Get 'em out of here! Now!

43
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,530
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

44
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,575
Hey, assholes!

45
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,597
Mike, are you okay?

46
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,432
Yeah. Let's get
the rest of them.

47
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,434
We can't. Just got orders
from Chief Heinemann.

48
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,103
He says secure perimeter,
surround building and wait.

49
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,105
- Wait for what?
- I don't know!

50
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,483
Some bullshit special unit.
The feds, the DEA.

51
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,611
If we let those bastards
get dug in now, we'll have to

52
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,862
level the building
to get 'em out!

53
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:50,261
Come and get it.
El Scorpio is ready.

54
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,692
Sarge, any of your
people in the building?

55
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,818
No.

56
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,445
Let's go.

57
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,490
Hey, can't let you in there.
Heinemann's on his way.

58
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,950
Heinemann can kiss
my sweet ass! Come on!

59
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,079
Goddamn it.
Go with him.

60
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,232
Three, two, one...

61
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,358
Go!

62
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,034
Get back, back, back. Back.

63
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,707
Next door over.

64
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,642
Take this room!

65
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,232
First floor, officer down.
We need backup.

66
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,170
Freeze!

67
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,422
I said hold it!

68
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,549
Now, lay your guns down.
It's over.

69
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,718
You can walk down or fly,
it's your choice.

70
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,679
I said put it down, asshole!

71
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,893
No!

72
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,501
Let's do it now!

73
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,085
Take it easy.

74
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,301
Damn, it's hot.

75
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,246
Must be losing it.

76
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,249
Mike!

77
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,793
Spread out.
Secure the roof.

78
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,046
Just take it easy.
I'm right here.

79
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,217
All clear here.
All clear on the site.

80
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,927
Danny boy.

81
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,638
I gotta get down from here.

82
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,767
Shit.

83
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,228
Okay, search the roof.
Work your way down.

84
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,980
Check every floor.
Maybe someone else...

85
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,983
Seal it off.
No one leaves.

86
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,902
Danny, come and get me
off this damn roof.

87
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,698
You get the rest of them?

88
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,074
Somebody beat us to it.

89
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,462
Leona.

90
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,186
Shit.

91
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,419
So, what happened to El Scorpio?

92
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,129
He's out front having lunch.

93
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,423
What the hell is this?

94
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,258
I don't know.

95
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,053
They've been cut to pieces.
Must be the Jamaicans.

96
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,306
Their style but where
the hell did they go?

97
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,517
Okay, nobody gets in here until
Forensic arrives. Nobody.

98
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,896
Okay, you know the drill.

99
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,884
Mike.

100
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,303
Up there.

101
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,772
He must have been killed out
here, and then someone...

102
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:41,654
That's about 35, 40 feet.
No rope, no ladder.

103
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,366
The guy weighs
about 190, 195 pounds.

104
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,785
You couldn't carry him up there.

105
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,162
Lieutenant?

106
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,623
Deputy Chief Heinemann's
downstairs.

107
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,834
He wants you and your people
out of the building now.

108
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,711
Son of a bitch.

109
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,714
What the fuck is going on?

110
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,175
This is not good,
Mike. Not good at all.

111
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,015
I want a real name
on this joker, okay?

112
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,307
You got it.

113
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,018
Mike.

114
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,231
Phil, this is quite a surprise. What
brings you down from the palace?

115
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,152
You let me down, Mike.
You're making me look bad.

116
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,114
I thought we had
an understanding.

117
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,533
I put my ass on the line
to get you here,

118
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,411
and all I expect is
a little cooperation!

119
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,665
Now, you were told that
this was a federal matter.

120
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,460
Yet you disobeyed a direct order
to stay out of the building.

121
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,755
Don't let this get out, Phil, but
it's a fucking war down here.

122
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,091
You are a soldier and
you take orders. Don't push it!

123
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,928
I'll push it as far as I can every day, Phil,
'cause we're fighting for our lives here,

124
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,557
while you're downtown pushing
pencils and kissing ass!

125
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,438
I don't roll over for
anybody, especially the feds,

126
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,690
without a goddamn
good explanation!

127
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,009
Take this equipment up to the third
floor now. Come on, let's move!

128
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,398
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, sir! Sir!

129
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,818
Hey, what the hell is
going on here, Heinemann?

130
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:48,447
Insubordination. Disregard for direct
orders from a supervising officer.

131
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,033
Now get back to
your cage at Alvarado.

132
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,576
I'll show you insubordination,
you son of a bitch!

133
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,411
No, no, no!

134
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,580
Where you running to?
Come here! Come on.

135
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,625
You don't need this, Mike.
It's not worth it.

136
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,418
Relax.

137
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,586
Fuck!

138
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,067
I have an update for you.
Now, get this.

139
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,654
In a midst of shootout, five
members of one Colombian drug gang

140
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:33,117
were apparently ambushed by their bloody
rivals, the Jamaican Voodoo Posse,

141
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,829
who escaped without a trace.
Again making total fools of...

142
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,414
- What've you got?
- A detective is here to see you.

143
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,249
Back there.

144
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:45,045
Listen, lady, you got a backed-up toilet.
Call a plumber, not the cops.

145
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,589
This license has expired.

146
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,091
Bullshit! I paid that
fee six months ago.

147
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,012
- I'll kick your ass!
- Sit down! Right now!

148
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,640
- Move! Get your ass movin'!
- Just calm the fuck down!

149
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,769
What you lookin' at?

150
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,940
And all you got to do

151
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,484
is tee it high and let it fly.

152
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,447
Dead solid perfect.

153
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,784
Now, remember, for distance you gotta
gently but firmly grip the club.

154
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,914
Lieutenant Harrigan! Detective
Lambert, Rampart Division.

155
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,375
Hey, kid, just have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

156
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,836
- Hey, Cap.
- Don't start with me, Mike.

157
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,089
Heinemann's already been up my ass so far
I won't be able to sit down for a week.

158
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,175
We're not winning this war.

159
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,678
As much as it's gonna piss you off, you're
gonna have to play the game on this one.

160
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,597
"Effective immediately,

161
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,558
"a federal task force under the
direction of Special Agent Peter Keyes

162
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,894
"will be investigating
criminal activities involving

163
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,522
"the trafficking and distribution
of controlled substances."

164
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,568
And you will extend him
your full cooperation.

165
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,446
Which means you're cutting off my
dick and shoving it up my ass.

166
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,533
God damn it, Mike, the feds are calling
the shots on this. My hands are tied!

167
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,578
- Yeah?
- Captain Pilgrim, Peter Keyes.

168
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,916
- It's good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

169
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,461
Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.
Special Agent Peter Keyes, DEA.

170
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,380
Heard a lot about you.

171
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,300
I'm sorry for this
jurisdictional intrusion.

172
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,387
Don't mean to be
stepping on your toes.

173
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,806
But we want to prevent
King Willie's voodoo gangs

174
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,642
from taking over and controlling
the entire West Coast.

175
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,646
I wish I could tell you more.

176
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,775
But we have a large number of
deep-cover operatives involved.

177
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,820
You know how it is.
We all have a job to do.

178
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:38,534
Now, I'm sure we can respect each
other's situation and act responsibly.

179
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,247
Well, cooperation

180
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,167
is my middle name.

181
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,634
I'll see you around.

182
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,142
Lieutenant Harrigan,

183
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,519
- I'm the new transfer, Jerry Lambert.
- Like I said, have a seat.

184
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,979
I'll be right with you.

185
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,065
- Who is this dude?
- Yeah, what an asshole.

186
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,278
All right, Danny boy,
what we got?

187
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:18,449
What have we got? Five lowlife
Scorpions make it into the building.

188
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,618
The next minute,
they're all shish kebab.

189
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,078
Not one bullet wound.

190
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,081
Well, it wasn't drugs or money. There's
a shit load of that for the taking.

191
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,377
Maybe King Willie brought in some outside
talent. He's making his big move.

192
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,755
A pro would have split the
moment he heard the action.

193
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,174
More than one,
we would have seen them.

194
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,302
Whoever did this waited
until the last minute,

195
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,805
and then took out four men armed
with machine guns by hand!

196
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,266
And then got by us.

197
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,312
Maybe we should give him a job.
Let's put him on the payroll.

198
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:52,107
So me and my partner bolt up the stairs,
somebody is screaming bloody murder...

199
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,194
- You gotta... You gotta hear this.
- What?

200
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,696
Hey. Hey,
I forgot to tell you.

201
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,281
See that guy there?

202
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,533
That's Ferris's replacement.

203
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,872
This guy's Jerry Lambert. The
Lone Ranger from Rampart station.

204
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,540
That's the Lone Ranger?

205
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,585
I thought he was here
to fix the air conditioning.

206
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,297
I said "Lady, you are under
arrest." And she said "Why?"

207
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:19,009
I said "Because your husband is dead.
You killed him."

208
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,053
And you know what she said
without missing a beat?

209
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,388
No.

210
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,390
She said, "I stabbed that son
of a bitch plenty of times.

211
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,142
"He never died
on me before."

212
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,606
Looks like he's putting
the moves to Leona.

213
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,527
- His first big mistake.
- His first big mistake.

214
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,698
I have heard about you.

215
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,575
- Yeah? All right.
- Yeah!

216
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,702
Like your last partner got shot.

217
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,787
What?

218
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,080
Well...

219
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,375
You try that cowboy
shit with me, fucker,

220
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,585
you can kiss these goodbye.

221
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,047
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

222
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,717
Well, well, I see that
the three of you have met.

223
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,264
Lambert, if you're
feeling up to it,

224
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,309
why don't you limp your way in and go see
the lieutenant. He wants to talk to you.

225
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,644
Yeah.

226
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,441
- You're a bad girl.
- I like that.

227
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,900
No, no, no!

228
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,945
Goddamn, is that bitch
on the rag or what?

229
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,951
This is what I call
"the speech," kid.

230
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:30,122
It's the only one I've got and I
only give it once, so pay attention.

231
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:35,210
Until now, it's all been fun and games,
cops and robbers, Dunkin' Donuts.

232
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:40,340
But you're in the shit now.
Metro Command is a war zone.

233
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,217
Lieutenant, I've paid my dues.

234
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,636
I had to bust my ass
to get my transfer.

235
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,638
And that scares
the shit out of me, kid.

236
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,641
No one requests to come down here unless
they're looking for a reputation.

237
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,895
There's no room for showboats,
anyone looking to prove themselves.

238
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,981
I won't stand for it.
Now, don't get me wrong.

239
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,651
We need good cops down here, and
they say you're good at what you do.

240
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,070
But the team comes first.

241
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:06,158
You live by that, and you'll be okay.
And we'll all be there for you.

242
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,785
Remember, the door
swings both ways.

243
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,913
That's it.

244
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,212
Hey, kid.

245
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,173
Welcome to the war.

246
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,609
No!

247
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,203
Okay, guys. This
has gone too far now, huh?

248
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,998
Hey, hey, guys.

249
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,710
I know you're trying
to scare me, huh?

250
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:03,048
Well, you did
a pretty good job, man.

251
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,425
I'm scared now.

252
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,054
Stop it now.

253
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,847
I can pay you.

254
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,266
$2 million, man. In cash.

255
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,770
Right now!
This is not about money.

256
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,481
This is about power!

257
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,318
There's a new king
in the streets.

258
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,405
This is a message
he has for your people.

259
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,823
You are history.

260
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,743
Fucking history, goddamn puto.

261
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,880
What the fuck are
you doing now, man?

262
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,465
You're crazy!

263
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,010
King Willie says,

264
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,179
not only do I have to kill you,

265
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,186
but I have to take your soul.

266
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,485
Voodoo magic.

267
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,406
Fucking voodoo magic, man.

268
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,954
But you know what?
I tell you what I believe.

269
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,460
Shit happens.

270
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,976
Shoot it!

271
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,009
Fucker!

272
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,536
Shit happens.

273
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,162
Shit happens.

274
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,511
I'm standing just outside a
penthouse complex in San Pedro...

275
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:58,140
...involving as many as 20 people.
It's uncertain just who they were.

276
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,477
But, at least one report indicates it might
be the feared Jamaican Voodoo Posse.

277
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,187
So I go in for
my physical, right,

278
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,733
and the doctor says "I need a
semen, stool and urine sample."

279
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:12,237
I say "Gee, doc, I'm in a big hurry.
Can I just leave my underwear?"

280
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,530
Oh, God.

281
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,870
Word is there may be as many as
50 more dead bodies up there.

282
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,705
Oh, man, it's Pope.

283
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,832
That parasite
must live in his car.

284
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,543
I'll handle it.
PR is my specialty.

285
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,920
Feds just sent word they want
your ass off the job.

286
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,256
- Tony, my man!
- Who the hell are you?

287
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,925
Your biggest fan, Tony! Catch
your show all the time.

288
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,051
Well, I got a job to do!

289
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,179
Your job is to root for your
garbage somewhere else.

290
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,930
- Been inside?
- Yeah, I did.

291
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,432
We were gonna go
in there with our guys,

292
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,309
but we were told on
a radio transmission

293
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,853
nobody goes in there under
any circumstances at all.

294
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,273
All units responding
to San Pedro and 5th Avenue, be advised.

295
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,567
Federal officers
will handle investigation.

296
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,403
- We didn't hear that. Let's go.
- You're the boss.

297
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,031
This is Cheryl Tyer
reporting live...

298
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,576
Hey, nice flashlight.
Mind if I borrow it?

299
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,044
Okay.

300
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,388
Damn!

301
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,810
Look familiar?

302
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,563
Fuck.

303
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,233
Oh, God.

304
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,736
Ramon Vega, the crack king.

305
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,656
Biggest operator in East LA.
100 keys a week.

306
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,116
Why isn't he skinned?
And who are these assholes?

307
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,661
They're Jamaicans.
King Willie's boys.

308
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,329
That doesn't make sense.

309
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:48,458
This was a voodoo ritual. I've seen it
all before. They took his heart out.

310
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,584
What for?

311
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,961
Terror tactics, man.

312
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,463
You know, to scare the shit
out of their enemies.

313
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,632
King Willie.

314
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,592
Who the hell is King Willie?

315
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,805
King Willie, voodoo
priest of the LA posses.

316
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:05,308
Ran the terror gangs
for Edward Seaga in Jamaica

317
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,310
till he got too powerful.

318
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,313
The Jamaican chiefs won't make
a move without his approval.

319
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,315
So what the fuck happened?

320
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,608
Shit!

321
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,321
Hey, we got a survivor!

322
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,540
What's she saying?

323
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,502
I don't know. She's
not making any sense.

324
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,756
She keeps saying "El diablo vino por ellos.
" The devil came for them.

325
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,051
Shit, if the Colombians did all this,
then why'd they leave their boss Ramon

326
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,596
over there hanging and his
girlfriend naked on the floor?

327
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,264
It wasn't the Colombians.

328
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,891
Our friend from the armory.

329
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,142
Right.

330
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,270
We got a new player in town.

331
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,107
Come over here, Mike.
Check this out.

332
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,654
What is that?

333
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,533
Looks like
a spear tip or something.

334
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,286
This is a restricted area.

335
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,164
I want it cleared immediately.

336
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,750
You're walking on
physical evidence.

337
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,127
- We'll take care of her.
- She's with me. Just back off!

338
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,923
Lieutenant, I'd like a word
with you in private, please.

339
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,264
They say that persistence is one of
your most outstanding qualities.

340
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,724
Hey, look, I know
this is your show...

341
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,267
You're not listening to me!

342
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,854
You got a big nose and you're
sticking it too far in my business.

343
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,941
Maybe you can hear this.
The next time you cross me,

344
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,359
you're gonna turn up missing.

345
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,655
Garber, the man with the camera.
Get him. Right now.

346
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,948
Yes, sir.

347
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,618
- All right. Come on, let's go.
- Stay away.

348
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,703
Hey, fuck you, man!
Give me my camera!

349
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,163
Shut the fuck up.

350
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,166
Hey, wait a minute! I got my rights!
I'm a journalist.

351
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,584
Harrigan!
Harrigan!

352
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,586
Shut up. Let's go.

353
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,881
Smells like a cover-up.
The press has a right to know!

354
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,968
- Take him out of the building. Search him.
- Scum ball.

355
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,388
Now you get
the hell out of here.

356
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,183
Who the hell are you, Keyes?

357
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,436
The last person in the world
you wanna fuck with.

358
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,786
Wanna make me proud, kid?

359
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,832
Take your bag of tricks, stay with
them, find out where they take her.

360
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,502
Meet me later at La Cita's. And be careful.
These guys are good.

361
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,463
Hey, don't worry, Lieutenant!
Surveillance is my specialty.

362
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,590
Okay, then.
Just get going.

363
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,761
Go get 'em, Lone Ranger.

364
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,641
Hey, Danny, look here.
We gotta take this real cool.

365
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,687
These guys sure aren't the DEA,
but it's still Keyes's party.

366
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,357
You stick around, stay out of sight.
I'll meet you at 1:00.

367
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:03,778
We'll take a good look at that room, okay?
Hey, wait for me.

368
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,698
Danny boy,
no hero stuff, understand?

369
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,159
Danny boy.

370
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,873
Watch your ass, Danny boy.

371
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,674
She never made it.

372
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,968
The feds were waiting.

373
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,262
Hustled her off in a chopper.

374
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,514
Let me guess.
A silver Alouette?

375
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,141
That very one.

376
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,898
And guess what. Your pal Keyes was running
the whole show. And his butt boys.

377
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,483
Son of a bitch.

378
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,027
You done real good, kid.

379
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,781
Now tomorrow,
start a tail on Keyes.

380
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,408
Everything he does,
everywhere he goes.

381
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,036
Who knows?
You might just get lucky.

382
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,454
Lieutenant!

383
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:58,041
Luck is my specialty.

384
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,252
Yeah. I bet it is.

385
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,094
Now, if you'll
excuse me, Lieutenant,

386
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,764
I got some serious
police work to attend to.

387
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,182
Come to Papa.

388
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,060
Hey!

389
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,813
- Hey, are your balls okay?
- Fine.

390
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,356
How are yours?

391
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,567
- Hey, do you mind? It's my sister.
- Say what?

392
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,402
You're not my sister, are you?

393
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,034
Son of a bitch. Who are you
really chasing, Keyes?

394
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,745
Time to go to work.

395
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,205
Shit.

396
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,166
Danny boy.

397
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,792
Mike?

398
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,925
Oh, God!

399
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,722
No. No. Oh, God!

400
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,727
Mother of God!

401
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,397
Please, no!

402
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,451
Lieutenant Michael R Harrigan.

403
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,330
Violence prone,
obsessive%compulsive personality,

404
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,208
a history of excessive
physical force

405
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:55,046
throughout his 18 years as a
Los Angeles police officer.

406
00:36:55,129 --> 00:37:00,551
Also responsible for the destruction
of 11 patrol cars, a city bus...

407
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,887
What about ten
commendations for valor,

408
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,307
and the best felony arrest record
in the history of this department?

409
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,728
That and my intervention on your
behalf are the only reasons

410
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,897
you still have a job, Harrigan.

411
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,982
If it were up to the chief,

412
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,153
he'd charge you with Detective
Archuleta's death and suspend you.

413
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,699
As it is,
he left it in my hands.

414
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:29,330
Now, this John Wayne attitude and flagrant
disregard for policy is gonna end now.

415
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,001
'Cause no one under my command is gonna impede
the progress of this federal task force

416
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,670
headed by Agent Keyes.

417
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,256
No one.

418
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,472
That's it.

419
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,724
Dismissed.

420
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,818
Mike, you're too close to this.
Stay out of it.

421
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,780
It's a police matter. They can't
keep the department out of it.

422
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,615
We'll find Danny's killer.

423
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,202
Captain, Danny and I
came up together.

424
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,788
Fifteen years on
the fucking street!

425
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,374
Whoever killed him is gonna pay.
I'm gonna finish it.

426
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,719
Hey!

427
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,347
Hey, come on.
What is this?

428
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,397
Listen, shithead.

429
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,151
I don't give a fuck who you really are
or what you want with this asshole

430
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,777
because now it's personal.

431
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,362
And he's a dead man.

432
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,491
The concept of what you're dealing with
is over your head. I'm warning you...

433
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,827
You! You don't know
what you're dealing with.

434
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,122
And I'm warning you.
Stay the fuck out of my way!

435
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,637
I'll take care of him.
No.

436
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,264
Let him go.

437
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,683
We're too close.

438
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,607
...claiming as his,
turf already controlled by

439
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,109
the bloodthirsty Jamaican
and Colombian drug lords.

440
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,862
Watch as we continue our report.

441
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,908
Yes, the word is out,
LA is up for grabs,

442
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,994
the spoils of our once fine
city going to the ruthless scum

443
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,706
who can spread the most carnage
and blood in our streets.

444
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,875
The latest update
on the scoreboard,

445
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,753
five assorted trash
and one good cop,

446
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,547
one of the best on our force.

447
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,883
Who's next you say? Where's the mayor?
He's not even in the city...

448
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,343
Forget it. It's over.

449
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,637
Mike, goddamn it.

450
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,890
This ain't your personal
little war, you know.

451
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,809
I loved Danny, too.

452
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,437
Hey, you told me, Lieutenant, the only way you
survive down here is because you're a team.

453
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,065
The door swings
both ways. Remember?

454
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,156
All right.
We'll do it together.

455
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,952
Come on. Talk to me about Keyes.

456
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,162
He's been everywhere. We've been
on him for the last three days.

457
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,498
And they're not looking
for drug dealers.

458
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:21,294
Yeah. They've been setting up these
weird radar sensors all over downtown.

459
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,338
I mean, I used my whole
repertory to keep up with them.

460
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,592
I had scanners on them,
but they scrambled my shit up.

461
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,094
Man, they had equipment
I can't begin to touch.

462
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,680
And then this morning

463
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,973
I lost 'em.

464
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,433
We lost them.

465
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,518
- Lost them where?
- Vernon and Industry.

466
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,894
I mean, like,
they fucking disappeared!

467
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,979
The slaughterhouse district?

468
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:44,066
Yeah, and in this heat!
I mean, BO and barbecue!

469
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,361
Whatever Keyes is looking for, he's
found it, or damn close to it.

470
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,488
Leona, I want to
meet with King Willie.

471
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,991
Willie and I seem to have
the same problem.

472
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,535
In the meantime,
you come with me.

473
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,953
Mike, it's impossible!

474
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,413
Just do it.

475
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,000
Fuck!

476
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,254
Omega 1, this is Control.

477
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,422
This is Omega 1.

478
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,968
Okay, we've only got 22 minutes
remaining on safe window of operation.

479
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,595
Yes, sir.

480
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,097
Verify that
final telemetry check.

481
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,807
Start your test now.

482
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,769
Scan track three, two, one,

483
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,811
mark.

484
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,439
Number six,
power up on the UV banks.

485
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,985
We're complete on the
lower UV banks. Ready for testing.

486
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,781
Second level, check for
ambient temperature variations.

487
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,699
You got two minutes.
Now get going.

488
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,246
To all units. All units,
you have approximately 20 minutes

489
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,956
to finish your task.

490
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,416
- Roger.
- Increase this UV.

491
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,752
Up 42 per cent.

492
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:52,468
Your friend's death was the result
of a massive intrusion in the chest cavity

493
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,930
by an edged weapon that nearly
cleaved the heart in two.

494
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,182
Death was instantaneous.

495
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:02,103
He was boned like a fish. I've
never seen anything like this.

496
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,439
Please, do not touch anything.

497
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,113
Doctor, what about
the other victims?

498
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,989
Anything there?

499
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,451
The federal team brought in
their own forensic examiners.

500
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,205
I am the medical examiner and the
chief pathologist in the city,

501
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,707
and they've cut
me out completely.

502
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,377
Any way you can get a look at any of
the evidence the feds have collected?

503
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,130
I mean, they must
have run tests.

504
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,339
It won't be easy.

505
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,882
Doctor...

506
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:36,387
I pried this from Danny's hands. This
is what took him up into the rafters.

507
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,264
It has almost no weight.

508
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,932
But it cuts like steel.

509
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,225
Let me see.

510
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:49,191
We are now at 150,000 times
normal magnification.

511
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,908
Astonishing. This material
doesn't correspond to anything

512
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,785
on the periodic table.

513
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,288
Lieutenant, what the
hell is that thing?

514
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,915
I don't know. But you don't
buy it in a hardware store.

515
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,126
- Military?
- Good guess.

516
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,087
Either something that got away from
us or something they want real bad.

517
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,340
Keyes. We're getting
closer now to what happened...

518
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,176
- Look out!
- Hey, no!

519
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,637
Easy, kid.
Put your gun away.

520
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,474
King Willie will see you now.

521
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,937
It's okay.

522
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,272
Don't you want me
to go with you?

523
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,815
I'll call you later.

524
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,275
You want me to follow you?

525
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,194
I'll call you later!

526
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,241
You want some ganja, man?

527
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,578
License plate number.

528
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,913
1-8-8...

529
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,748
No, no. 1-8-8-3...

530
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,124
Fuck!

531
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,929
The door swings
both ways, my ass.

532
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,932
This door swings both ways.

533
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,533
Thanks for the ride.

534
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,828
You know,

535
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,413
you guys really
ought to cut down.

536
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:13,669
They say you want to talk to me.

537
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:17,798
They say you offering me favors.

538
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,013
Tell me why, Babylon.

539
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,764
Mr. Policeman.

540
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,893
I want some information.

541
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,102
Information.

542
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:37,109
About the one that's
doing all the killing?

543
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,361
He killed your people.

544
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,696
Now mine.

545
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,366
I think you know who he is.

546
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,036
I want him.

547
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,165
I don't know who he is.

548
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,085
But I know where he is.

549
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,839
The other side.

550
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,341
What are you talking about?

551
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,343
The spirit world, man.

552
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,429
You see,

553
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,222
it's always the same.

554
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,478
There's no stopping
what can't be stopped.

555
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,272
No killing what can't be killed.

556
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,441
Hey, make sense, man.

557
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,945
This thing that's killing
your people and mine

558
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,656
is from the other side.

559
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,824
I can feel him all around.

560
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,495
You can't see
the eyes of the demon

561
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,207
until him come calling.

562
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,002
This is dread, man.

563
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,964
Truly dread.

564
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,140
Nothing else for
you here, policeman.

565
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,809
Time to go.

566
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,282
Prepare yourself.

567
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,935
"His foundation lie
in the holy mountain."

568
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,063
"Selah."

569
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,449
This is Tony Pope live from LA,

570
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,826
the city of fear.

571
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,704
The psycho-vigilante killer continues
his daily diet for murder.

572
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,331
Bodies strung out,

573
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:23,335
bodies with the skins ripped off,
the hearts torn from the cadavers.

574
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,213
And just recently,
King Willie, the drug lord,

575
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,800
the vicious drug lord found in
an alley just around the corner

576
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,971
with his head cut off and his
spinal column torn from the body.

577
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,557
A fitting demise to
the Prince of Powder.

578
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:44,398
First Danny, then King Willie.
And you were right there!

579
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,734
He's playing with you, Mike.
You've gotta be careful.

580
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,654
Yeah. We all gotta be careful.
What about Keyes?

581
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,738
Anything there?

582
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,908
There's definitely something
slippery about our brother Keyes.

583
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,369
Seems there's
a Peter J. Keyes.

584
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,788
PhD physical sciences, Cornell.

585
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,501
Hot out of college and right into
bed with the Strategic Defense Institute.

586
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,630
Then two years later commissioned as
a captain in Air Force Intelligence.

587
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,592
Mike, this is a dead end.
We're way out of our league!

588
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,011
Look, I don't care how big
this is or who's involved.

589
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,513
This guy killed Danny
and he's going to fall!

590
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:18,891
Now, what about the good doctor?

591
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,684
Yes, I'm here, Lieutenant.

592
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:25,355
The federal authorities erased everything
from the computer file except for this.

593
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:29,401
Part of a chemical test on a
fragment of wood from the penthouse.

594
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,154
And it contained traces

595
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:35,490
of cattle blood and heavy
traces of steroids.

596
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,203
I believe that whoever killed
Detective Archuleta

597
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,330
had recently been
in a slaughterhouse.

598
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,875
Slaughterhouse. That's where I
lost Keyes the first time, Lieutenant.

599
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,919
Yeah. That's where
we'll find him.

600
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,714
Take the metro, Long Beach line. I'll
pick you up at Vernon station in an hour.

601
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:54,927
Just because you don't see Keyes's
boys doesn't mean they're not around.

602
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,824
I just want you to
stay in the car. Okay?

603
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,912
Your mom and I won't be very long. You sit
still. We'll be back in a few minutes.

604
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,330
All right?

605
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,166
Come on, honey.
Yes, dear.

606
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,670
Which way was it?
Down here to the right.

607
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,843
Take that, you scum-sucking dog.

608
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,119
Want some candy?

609
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,706
Brian?

610
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,168
- You come here right this minute.
- Mommy, I saw a ghost.

611
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,963
Want some candy?
Want some candy?

612
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,691
Rest.

613
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,741
Want some candy?

614
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,760
Danny's necklace.

615
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,432
God, I hate
the subway at rush hour.

616
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:48,892
You know, it's hard
enough to find a seat,

617
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,646
and if you find one, someone's either
pissed in it or thrown up all over it.

618
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,565
This damn heat
is killing me, man.

619
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,275
Hey, it's me!

620
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,528
- I look great!
- Shut up.

621
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,446
No autographs, Pop.

622
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,156
Hey, look. There's two seats right there.
I told you...

623
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,034
Don't touch me!
Get off! Hey!

624
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,872
This shit never ends.

625
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,002
- After you.
- Asshole!

626
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,506
- Excuse me. Police business.
- Get out of my way!

627
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:23,468
Hey, baby.
Bésame mucho. Come on!

628
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:29,433
You look like
a sympathetic dude.

629
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,144
My partner here
needs an operation.

630
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,856
But we're a little short of
cash, if you know what I mean?

631
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,732
No need for that.

632
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,484
Money.

633
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,278
Get the hell away from me!

634
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:45,073
- I know how to use this thing! Don't make me use this thing!
- He got a cap gun.

635
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:46,741
Bet mine's bigger than yours!

636
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,368
I'll take that.

637
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:54,082
Hold it. Police!
We're in trouble now.

638
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,250
Nobody move!

639
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:00,297
Okay, everybody just take a deep
breath, loosen your sphincters.

640
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,466
We don't need any
rush-hour Rambo's there.

641
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,718
Tú también, motherfucking baby!

642
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,887
Drop it and sit down!
Siéntate!

643
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,308
What the hell is that?

644
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,648
Leona, you okay?

645
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:22,903
This is it! He's in the train!
Get these people out of here!

646
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,823
Jerry!

647
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,992
What's happening?

648
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,433
Get down! Get down!

649
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,685
Come on, come on,
come on, get out of the way!

650
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,020
Jerry!

651
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,439
Leona!

652
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,901
Leona, get 'em out! Go! Go!

653
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,906
Now!

654
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,991
Now!

655
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,582
I can't see...

656
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,972
Jerry!

657
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:35,100
Now, Leona, do it!

658
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,935
Now!

659
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,375
Hey! Over here!

660
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,004
Yeah, that's right.
Come and get it.

661
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,177
Come on! Move it! Move it!

662
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,056
Let's go, let's go! Vamos!
What is that?

663
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,018
Yeah.

664
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:25,775
Move it! Don't panic,
just go! Go! Apúrense, vamos!

665
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,706
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck are you?

666
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,375
Wait!

667
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,720
Vamos! Ven, ven, vamos!
Come on!

668
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,396
Keep walking! Come on, you too!
Vàmonos!

669
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,482
Come on, motherfucker!

670
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,817
Want some candy?

671
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,944
Let's dance!

672
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,077
Move it. Come on, get out of the way!
Come on.

673
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,912
Get out of the way!
Out, come on!

674
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:39,432
Come on,
out! Out! Out!

675
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,851
Come on, move it!

676
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:46,523
That way! That way!
Towards the light! The light!

677
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,274
Come on! Get out!

678
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,070
Come on.

679
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,005
Oh, God.

680
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,348
Jerry.

681
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,047
God, not again.

682
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:38,176
Okay, move your ass!
Move out the way!

683
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,638
Watch out! What's happening? What's
happening? What's happening?

684
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,348
It's a fucking slaughter
down there, Lieutenant.

685
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,682
Oh, God!

686
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,020
Hey, Jerry!

687
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,980
Oh, Leona! Leona!

688
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,359
Please. Leona.

689
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,653
How's she doing?

690
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,905
Deep shock, but she's alive.

691
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:03,034
Picking up fetal heart sounds.
This woman is pregnant.

692
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,245
Let's move.
LA County. Stat!

693
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,041
Stand back.

694
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,585
On three. One, two,
three. Load up.

695
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,003
Out of my way!

696
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,965
Move out the way!
Move it! Move it!

697
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,893
Man!

698
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:37,443
Wait a minute.
Let me see.

699
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,450
Where's Jerry?

700
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,702
I don't know.

701
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,162
We found his badge.

702
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,166
Who got hit this time?

703
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,960
Five gang members,

704
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,837
bunch of commuters.

705
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,839
Doesn't make sense.

706
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,466
They were all armed.

707
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,095
- What do you mean?
- It's the chief.

708
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,097
Wait here. Yeah?

709
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,766
What the hell's
going on down there?

710
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,560
It's a damn nightmare.
Civilians this time.

711
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,770
- All killed?
- Yeah. Just like the others.

712
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:13,980
Damn!

713
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,739
Jerry!

714
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:23,967
Hey!

715
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,471
Holy shit! What the
hell is going on here?

716
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:33,101
Hey, guys, get the camera on! Get
the camera on this right now!

717
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,311
Get that goddamn thing on film!

718
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,605
What's going on?

719
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,191
Hey! Hey!

720
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,531
Hey, Harrigan!

721
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,992
More victims.
More mutilations.

722
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:52,328
- Fuck you!
- Pope!

723
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,790
Pope? Are you there, Pope?
Pope, what's going on?

724
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,285
Sir, the cop is back.

725
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,620
Goddamn.

726
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:05,419
Harrigan! Don't you show up
in the damnedest places.

727
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:11,384
Come here, Lieutenant. I got something
you might find interesting.

728
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,136
What is this?

729
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:17,974
How many times do I have to tell you? You
don't know what you're dealing with.

730
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:22,270
There's your killer.
Wonderful, isn't it?

731
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,982
Pheromone signature left by his body.
These are scent molecules.

732
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,608
Punch up three.

733
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,279
Ten years ago one of his
kind stalked and eliminated

734
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,823
an elite Special Forces
crew in Central America.

735
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,075
There were two survivors.

736
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,119
They indicated that,
when trapped,

737
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,788
the creature activated
a self-destruct device

738
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:45,168
that destroyed enough rainforest
to cover 300 city blocks.

739
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,211
Remarkable weaponry.

740
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:50,590
That's right, Lieutenant.
Other-world life forms.

741
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:54,260
A fucking alien!

742
01:06:56,012 --> 01:07:01,017
Iwo Jima, Cambodia, Beirut.
Drawn by heat and conflict.

743
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,563
He's on safari. Lions.
The tigers. The bears.

744
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,356
Oh, my!

745
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,818
Trophies. That's the
game, isn't it, Keyes?

746
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:12,486
You're the lion.

747
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,281
This is his jungle.

748
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,699
So why can't we see him?

749
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,701
Defensive adaptations
are astounding.

750
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:22,496
It's somehow able to bend
light. Perfect camouflage.

751
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,915
You admire the son of a bitch.

752
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,708
Not what he does, Lieutenant.

753
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:29,295
For what he is.
For what he can give us.

754
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,089
A new era of
scientific technology.

755
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:35,968
I've waited a lifetime for this, and
I'm not going to miss the chance.

756
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,640
Mr. Garber, we're picking up
something on the pheromone scanners.

757
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,148
Target one is on the roof.

758
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,318
It's taken us over two weeks
to learn his patterns.

759
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,946
He comes here every
two days to feed.

760
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,781
Seems he has a taste for beef.

761
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,075
I didn't think
he was vegetarian.

762
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,036
Well, we've prepared a little
trap for this predator.

763
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:05,998
We are certain that this being can
see in only one spectrum of light,

764
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,584
- infrared.
- Infrared?

765
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:11,254
He hunts by seeing our heat.

766
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:12,588
Block the heat and he's blind.

767
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:15,925
These suits insulate all body heat, making
the team invisible to the creature.

768
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:18,344
We've flooded the packing
house with radioactive dust.

769
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:22,431
We've also installed powerful
ultraviolet lighting everywhere.

770
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:26,352
The dust adheres to his body,
making him visible.

771
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:30,523
Liquid nitrogen. You're not gonna kill
this asshole. You're gonna freeze him.

772
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:31,983
Well, we have to capture him.

773
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,859
He's moving.

774
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,528
Finally.

775
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:40,449
Grab a seat. Enjoy the show.
This is history.

776
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,966
Capture and isolation
is our objective.

777
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,844
Defensive action
only on my orders.

778
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,015
Power up. Lights on.
Let's get him!

779
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,864
We're in.

780
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,158
Switch to ultraviolet.

781
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,368
Radio silence. Out.

782
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,370
Engage ultraviolet units
A through J.

783
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,521
What's all this interference?

784
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,107
Correcting the problem, sir.

785
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,766
They're moving
to the second level.

786
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,854
Target's still moving, heading
towards the number two stairwell.

787
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,149
Playing right into it.

788
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:36,500
Wait a minute.
It's stopped.

789
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,050
It's moving back
against the wall.

790
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,387
It's backing up.
It's moving away from them.

791
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,305
He sees them, Garber.
Your boys have been made.

792
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,890
Sir, it's circling
around behind them.

793
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:18,644
Get 'em out, Garber! They're
walking into a trap! Get 'em out.

794
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:23,232
Keyes, he's right behind you. Third
floor structure. Right there!

795
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:25,776
Who is this?
Clear the line.

796
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:29,863
He sees the damn lights. Turn 'em off!
Turn 'em off! Shit!

797
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:31,824
Stop him!

798
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,748
Door. Open it.

799
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,083
Go fuck yourself.

800
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,294
Okay. Okay.

801
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:44,670
The door.

802
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,464
- Yes, sir.
- You don't know what you're doing, Harrigan.

803
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:49,967
It's open.

804
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,385
You'll ruin everything!

805
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:52,928
Fuck yourself!

806
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:58,017
Defensive formation one.
Nitrogen guns, safeties off.

807
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,852
Everyone else, lie still.

808
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,146
This is it.

809
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,908
He's moving down on your
position from the right.

810
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:18,370
Garber, where is he?
I can't see him.

811
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,081
He's right there!
He's right there!

812
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:25,628
God damn it! Where is he? Well,
give me a coordinate! Where is he?

813
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:28,922
Watch out!

814
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:30,299
My God.

815
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:32,009
Watch your crossfire!

816
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,348
What...

817
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,145
I'm losing my pressure.

818
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,091
Keyes, you all right?

819
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,927
Keyes, it's over here!

820
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,859
Come on,
damn it! Switch over!

821
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,861
Shit! I can't see!

822
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,617
They're gone.

823
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,537
They're all dead.

824
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,966
You want me? Here I am!

825
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,245
You are one

826
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:36,039
ugly mother...

827
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,168
Motherfucker!

828
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:19,875
Guess who's back.

829
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,047
Too late to go home now.

830
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:43,065
Get out of here, Harrigan.
I'm gonna save your ass.

831
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,233
This is between me and him!

832
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:35,867
God...

833
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,759
Birds.

834
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:37,429
Damn birds.

835
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,793
Okay, pussyface.

836
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:52,420
It's your move.

837
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:55,507
Shit happens.

838
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:36,941
Oh, God. Oh, God.

839
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:42,030
That's all I need is birds.

840
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:43,948
You can do it.

841
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:49,954
I can do it. I can do it.

842
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,458
It's like falling off a log.

843
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,473
Like a 30-story log.
Damn!

844
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:29,285
Yeah. Maybe I'll
get lucky and fall.

845
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:11,953
Damn it.

846
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:31,973
The final
Jeopardy answer is this,

847
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:37,020
Berengaria, who never set foot in
England, was its queen for eight years

848
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,731
after marrying
this king on Cyprus.

849
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:41,733
Good luck.

850
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:43,985
Herb?

851
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:48,281
Herb, wake up! There's
somebody in the bathroom.

852
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:56,789
Herb!

853
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:16,077
It's all right.
I'm a cop.

854
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,912
I don't think he gives a shit.

855
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:22,500
Shit!

856
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,419
Get back inside!

857
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:35,179
Holy Moses.
Not again. Shit!

858
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,890
Son of a bitch.

859
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:40,393
Oh, God.

860
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:48,776
Why can't this guy
stay on the ground?

861
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:52,947
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on!

862
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,616
Come to Papa.

863
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:04,917
Stop! Stop the elevator!

864
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:06,961
Stop it!

865
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,910
Now where the hell am I?

866
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,428
Where are you?

867
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,986
Jesus Christ.

868
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:10,204
That's right, asshole!

869
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,790
Shit happens!

870
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:58,479
Okay. Who's next?

871
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:47,278
Take it.

872
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:53,617
"1715."

873
01:40:46,498 --> 01:40:50,294
Harrigan! What the fuck
happened in there, huh?

874
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,346
Goddamn it.
We came so close!

875
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:13,984
Don't worry, asshole.
You'll get another chance.
