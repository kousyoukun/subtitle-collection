00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,250
Once upon a time, your father--

4
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,709
my father, everybody's father,
I presume,

5
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:04,709
wanted a good job
with a good income

6
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,166
to secure their family life.

7
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,000
A role in society.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,583
And that's where it ended,

9
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,500
but now, people want
to be an individual.

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,667
And I think there's a lot
of searching to find

11
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,125
the individual within oneself.

12
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:28,500
Once upon a time,
there was a little house.

13
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,458
Just say where you came from?

14
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,792
David Robert Jones
from Stansfield Road, Brixton.

15
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:41,542
That's the first thing I knew,
in case I got lost,

16
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,125
'cause I used to
wander off a lot.

17
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,625
It wasn't a particularly
happy childhood.

18
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,792
My parents were
cold emotionally.
There weren't many hugs.

19
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:55,291
I always sort of craved
affection because of that.

who have an iota of,
sort of, curiosity

25
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,917
are bound to escape
and get out,

26
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:21,375

No, I told Ron about some
things, has he told you?

- Yeah. All right?
-Yeah.

44
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,166
And the intro to the show?

45
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,417
What were you doing before
you hit the bright headlights?

46
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:06,083
Were you a nobody
and suddenly thought,

47
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,417
"Jesus, I must get into
the scene by some other way?"

48
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:10,250
I never asked Jesus
for a thing, no.

49
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,792
It's always
on my own initiative.

50
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,291
When I was 14, I became a Mod,

51
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,542
and it just carried on
from there.

52
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,375
I've always dressed
in what I consider

53
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,500
clothes that prevent
me becoming humdrum,

54
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,208
so that I would receive
reaction from people, which
would encourage me to write.

55
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,458
London represented a lifestyle,

56
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,291
a new kind of language,
culturally.

57
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,041
It was really fantastic
at that point.

58
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,250
Where you writing songs
at this period?

59
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,709
Not very good ones.

60
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,166
The majority of the things
were other people's numbers.

61
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,834
Little Richard stuff.
Things like that.

62
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:07,417
But I became disenchanted with
singing other people's songs.

63
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,375
I thought I'd write my own.

64
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,500
He was a nobody within
my scope of knowledge

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,083
of who was
in the music industry.

66
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,333
But we needed a singer.

67
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,875
And different people came.

68
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,166
Amongst them was David Jones,

69
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,542
or Davy Jones, as he was
promoting himself at that time.

70
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,333
We were impressed
with his voice,

71
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,208
although I thought he was
going to play the saxophone.

72
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,667
He had the alto sax
around his neck,

73
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:46,542
and it wasn't until
he started singing we realized

74
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,917
he was the boy for us, really.

75
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:51,792
We employed him. He didn't
employ us, we employed him.

76
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,875
And this was David's fourth go
in terms of bands,

77
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,625
hoping this would be it.

78
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,041
But David, of course,
had his own agenda,

79
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,750
where it was going to be
Davy Jones and
the Lower Third now,

80
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,834
but next it's going to be
David Bowie and whatever.

81
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,500
So there was a side
to David that you--

82
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,250
that wasn't revealed to you.

83
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,625
Hah! He was a rascal, mate.

84
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,625
That's it, that's all
I can really say about it.

85
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,917

90
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,000
I mean I was always very vain.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,542
Then I found out that,
up in London,

92
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,542
all the mods wore make-up,
eye shadow.

93
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,458
And I thought
that was really peculiar,

94
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,875
and I thought it looked
rather good.

95
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:07,125
The group van was
this London LCC ambulance.

96
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,083
We lived in this ambulance, as
well as traveling to the gigs.

97
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,000
So, we were talking about
how could we be different
from everybody else,

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,375
and David said,
"What about wearing make-up?"

99
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,959
Right, I was... make-up, OK.

100
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,458
Now, I thought he meant
clown make-up.

101
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,166
Graham was driving,
as he always did.

102
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:31,500
"Here," I said, "Dave's
just come up with an idea.
What about we wear make-up?"

103
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,291
So Graham turned around,
"Fuck that!"

104
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,333
Years later,
I had, uh, the same problems.

105
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,500
I didn't actually tell
The Spiders that
we'd have to wear make-up.

106
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,583
I said, "You looked very green
tonight on stage.

107
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,333
Do you think if--
I think if you wore make-up,

108
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:57,166
you'd probably look
a little more natural-looking."

David had such a wide,
eclectic taste in things.

123
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,875
He thought, "Well let's
have a go at this, because
it's completely different,

124
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,417
it's gonna throw people
off balance, I'm sure,

125
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:54,959
uh, and let's see how it goes."

126
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:01,375
And we did that
with our set on stage.

127
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,792
Mostly, it was
David's own compositions,

128
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:07,208
but we'd do hits by
The Kinks or The Who,

129
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:11,333
but we'd also do things
like "Chim-Chimeree"
from Mary Poppins.

130
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,875
I thought,
"Why are we doing that stuff?"

131
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:22,417
Looking back on it,
it just felt like a lot of fun
at the time

132
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,750
and quite, kind of,
mischievous.

133
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,375
You laugh a lot
when you're young, you know,

134
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,750
it was-- it was just,
a lot of it was really funny.

135
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:38,250
Greetings Pop Pickers,
it's Pick of the Pops.

136
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,083
David told us we'd got
an audition at the BBC.

137
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:46,291
This was, wow, you know, I mean,
something special. The BBC.

138
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:55,834
So, we walked into the BBC,
and did our three numbers.

139
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,542
"Out Of Sight,"
"Chim-Chimeree,"

140
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:00,291
and "Baby That's A Promise."

141
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,542
That's one of David's songs.

142
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:06,000
We did that, came away, and
then waited for the results.

143
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:12,834
I've been having second thoughts
about this, and I'd like to hear
more from the music department.

144
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,458
Well, frankly, to me, this
savors too much of a gimmick.

145
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,583
They said that it was
quite a different sound,

146
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,583
especially in
the Mary Poppins  number.

147
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:27,834
"And the treatment of
'Chim-Chimeree' kills
the song completely."

148
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,333
You cheeky sods!

149
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,625
"Routine beat group,
strange choice of material.

150
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,834
Amateur-sounding vocalist

151
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:41,166
who sings wrong notes
and out of tune," yes.

152
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,375
"Group has nothing
to recommend it."

153
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,083
"I don't think the group will
get better with more rehearsal.

154
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:56,250
The singer is a cockney type,

155
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,375
but not outstanding enough."

156
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,333
Well, you need to be
an outstanding cockney,
obviously, for the BBC.

157
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:07,000
"There is no entertainment
in anything they do.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,208
An inoffensive,
pleasant nothing.

159
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,375
Backing singer
devoid of personality."

160
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,875
Where are these people now?

161
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,500
And each one says,
"No, no, no, no."

162
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,291
So, that was our post-mortem,
I suppose.

163
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,125
We failed.

164
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,625
But we got a recording contract
with Tony Hatch.

165
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,834
This, to me, was awe inspiring.

166
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,375
I'd written and produced
the song "Downtown"

167
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,208
with Petula Clarke.

168
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,875
And I'd produced
Sandy Shaw's first hit.

169
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,500
And when somebody
called me and said,

170
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,583
"We have this artist, and he
really has got a great talent,

171
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:57,250
and he writes all his own
things," I was more than happy.

172
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,542
David came up with
"Can't Help Thinking About Me."

173
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:05,583
We rehearsed it,
played it at the Marquee,

174
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:10,250
and then, took it into
the studio and recorded it
with Tony Hatch.

177
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,166

178
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:24,291
It's structured well.
It has a very strong hook."

179
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:36,375
I don't know where you found
this, but it is a piano,

180
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,083
in case anybody
wondered what it was.

Well, this came out of trials
in short story writing,

184
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,125
little things about leaving
home and stuff like that.

00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,000
I couldn't really relate
to America too well,

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,625
so I started writing more about
Bromley and Beckenham.

190
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,208

from beginning to end.

191
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:21,417

00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,583
even at that age,
eight or nine years old.

196
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,083

♪ I can't help

198
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:44,500

199
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,834
that David had interests
in things that other kids
didn't have.

200
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,125
He was ahead of his time
regarding, you know,

201
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,875

but Bowie was a storyteller.

206
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:13,625
And so, he was going to
rummage into all his experiences

207
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,041
to find things that
he could write about.

208
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,166

and we would be
his band on stage.

222
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,625
He wanted a band that was
very much a backing band

223
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,959
so that he would be the front
man, as a separate entity.

whose career will surely
develop him into one of

227
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,959
the bigger names in
the showbiz field.

228
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,583
He's a great attraction
here at the Marquee,
and his name is David Bowie!

229
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,125
David, you're working with
a backing group, The Buzz.

230
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,709
Have you always been with them?

231
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,125
As David Bowie, yes.

232
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,041
Why do you say,
"As David Bowie"--

233
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,667
I was somebody else
before that.

234
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,291
This is, what,
your second record,

235
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,041
and it's a song you wrote?

236
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,125
Yes, I write most
of the stuff I record,

237
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,959
the B-sides and A-sides.

238
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,667
I don't think people realized
how important the Marquee was

239
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,333
as a venue.

240
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,333
It was the hottest place to go
as far as I was concerned.

241
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,208
I wouldn't have said that
I would have gone specially

242
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,959
to see his act
at the Marquee club,

243
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,375
I went mainly to see some of
what I called the hotter bands.

244
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,834
I would sit in the audience
and gape at...

245
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:24,041

253
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:42,291
The record company
decided it didn't matter what
I was going to make with David,

254
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,917
they were losing faith.

255
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,959
His songs,
they weren't good enough

256
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:52,083
to actually capture
everybody's imagination.

257
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:56,917
You know, it still isn't
that unique Bowie magic.

258
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,667
David was never the success

259
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:04,125
that all his other
contemporaries were,

260
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,250
because of being
that much younger.

261
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,917
You could say that he almost
had missed the boat.

262
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,417
But he was a very driven man,
even from those early days.

263
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,291
But he always was helpful to me.

264
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:22,709
You know, I always felt
I was kind of a fellow musician
with him.

265
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,875
Love never came into it,
which, thank God, you know,

266
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:35,458
if you're going to fall in love
with Bowie, you might as well
kiss your sanity goodbye.

267
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,959
Because he loved himself
extremely, always did.

268
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,083
And I was quite happy with that.

269
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,834
At one point, David said,
"Do you want to come home
and meet my parents?"

270
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,333
I said, "Yes, why not?"

271
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,083
So, that meant taking
the train to Bromley.

272
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,834
You find yourself
in the middle of two worlds.

273
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:02,208
There's the extreme values
of people who grow up
in the countryside,

274
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,667
and the very urban feel
of the city.

275
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:09,125
And in suburbia, you're given
the impression that nothing
culturally belongs to you.

276
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,125
That you are sort of
in this wasteland.

277
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,291
David lived in Sundridge Park,

278
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,834
a mile or so from
the center of Bromley.

279
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,417
And, um, it was quite quiet,

280
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,792
there wasn't-- there was not
a lot happening there, you know.

281
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,542
There was a corner pub,
couple of shops.

282
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,792
When I was in
his parents' house,

283
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,583
they're facing a television,

284
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,166
and the parents were
sitting there quite quiet.

285
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,917
They offered me some
tuna fish sandwiches.

286
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,375
But then, there was silence.
And I'm somebody that, I mean,

287
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,333
I can talk to anybody,
and it was hard going.

288
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,834
It was soulless.

289
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,041
Once they'd gone out, he said,

290
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,166
"Whatever it takes,
I want to get out of here.

291
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,667
I do not want
to live like this."

292
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,667
I think there's a passion
for most people

293
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:13,000
to have an iota of, sort of,
curiosity about them,

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,333
to escape and get out
and try and find who one is,

295
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,709
and find some kinds of roots,
you know,

296
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:21,333
and a desperation,

297
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,834
an exhaustion with the
blandness of where we grew up.

298
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,417
So, London was magnetic for us.

299
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:35,583
It was somewhere
we wanted to belong in.

300
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,000
And I think that's why
David writes about it

301
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,375
so often in his early career.

302
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,041
He would want to write songs
from the perspective,

303
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:52,250
like Ray Davies did, really,
of a London boy.

304
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,625

they were great songs,
they just--

313
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,083
people didn't know
about them yet.

314
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,041

it's just a very typical thing

None of it was.

334
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,250
"London Boys" is a really
good example of David using

335
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,291
-his natural accent to sing,
to make the point.
-Right.

336

called "London Boys,"
and you are from London,

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,208
and it's about you being
a young man in London,

338
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:08,333
then the accent really
drives the point home.

339
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,959
I think he even
exaggerates it a little bit.

340
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,583
It's almost like theater.

341
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,458
-Oh, yeah.
-It's like he's--
it is in a sense,

342
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:19,458
he's doing a song, and whatever
the theme of that song is,

343
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:24,417
he's putting on the character
vocally that-- that tells
the story the right way.

344
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:27,834
-That's exactly--
-And he's brilliant with that.

comes from
a sense of uniqueness.

357
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
Other than just rock music,

358
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,750
there has always been
a history of the rebel.

359
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,625
Of not being drawn to
the tyranny of the mainstream.

360
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:57,291
I really am open
to influence and new ideas

361
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,500
and old ideas, as well.

362
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,458
I don't put up
a block on things.

363
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:09,542
I was one of the first kids
in Britain to have
the Velvet Underground album.

364
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:13,041
I know that for a fact, because
somebody had brought me back

365
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:16,625
a demo copy of it before it was
even released in America.

366
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,333
The Underground were,
I thought,

367
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,250
the most incredible sound.

368
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,208
There was the sort of mixture
of rock and  avant-garde.

369
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,917
And the combination
was so brutal.

370
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:36,667
I don't think David
lacked confidence in himself.

371
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,667
He probably always knew
that he was very adaptable.

372
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:42,792
And it was more a question of
him getting on the right track

373
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:45,542
to do the thing
that would take him furthest.

374
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,834
And it obviously took
him a long time to do that,

375
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:54,709
with the Lower Third and then,
The Buzz,

376
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,875
and the other things
that he did.

377
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,375
♪ Well, I know
you've had it bad, girl ♪

378
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:11,250
♪ And you're not to blame... ♪

379
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,917
I think the attraction
for David

380
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:16,166
was he was looking
to move forward

381
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:20,542
and be a lot more adventurous
with his musical styles.

382
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:23,792
And we were looking for a singer
that was totally flexible.

383
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:29,333
But then David made it plain,
really, right from the get-go,

384
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:34,917
that he wanted to go
more left-field, if that's
the right term, musically.

385
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:38,250
And already, he was talking
about Velvet Underground.

386
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,125
He knew what he wanted,
and, uh, he was there to do it.

387
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,750
He just wanted a backing band,
with extra goodies put in.

388
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,750
Which we did,
we started having face painted,

389
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,750
we started to go
more outrageous.

390
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,542
I remember him
coming over to me,

391
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:57,417
"Can I draw a petal
on your face, or a flower
on your cheek?"

392
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,458
I said, "Yeah, do what
you want with my face.

397
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,250
To me,

398
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,709
the Velvet Underground
represented the wild side
of existentialist America,

399
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:25,125
the underbelly
of American culture.

400
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,792
That was everything
that I thought we should
have in England.

401
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:32,834
But, of course, being filtered
through this British system,

402
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:36,417
it came out more vaudeville.

403
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,750
"Toy Soldier"
was a bit of an odd one,

404
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,041
because it was about a young
girl coming home from school,

405
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:48,667
going to her bedroom, and
winding up a little toy soldier,

406
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:52,375
and then, being whipped
by the toy soldier.

embarrassed about

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,875
nicking some ideas.

412
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:12,083
He wasn't against
taking a basic number,

413
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:16,458
and then, rearranging it by
any means, including the lyrics.

00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,792
-It was just so visual.
-Yeah.

418
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:32,792
A tailors' dummy, I think, used
to get flagellated or something,

419
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:35,917
it was ridiculous, you know,
it was bizarre.

-they could just see
people whipping, and, uh...
-Yeah.

424
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,291

00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:20,709
But David's time with us
was eight weeks.

433
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:22,959
25 gigs, that's all.

434
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:27,041

he's done his bit with us,
and now, want to move on to

something a bit more theatrical.

437
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,667
I was looking for someone who

438
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,291
could be
an all-around entertainer.

439
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:45,792
And I thought in David, we had
found someone who could be.

440
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,667
When we first went
to the Deram label,

441
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:56,166
the man who was in charge
of the album department

442
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,083
said to me,

443
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,875

449

that I could sing very well,

456
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:41,125
and I used to kind of
try on people's voices

457
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,417
if they appealed to me
when I was a kid, about 15, 16.

458
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:48,709
So, I started singing
like Anthony Newley.

459
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:56,417
And so I was writing
these really weird
Tony Newley-type songs.

460

Anthony Newley all the time.

I mean, to the point that, you
know, we used to comment on it,

468
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,834

I can't sing any other way."

We knew bloody well he could,
but he just had--

470
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,750
I think he just had a fixation
to the point that as soon
as he opened his mouth,

471
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,208
Anthony Newley shot out.

00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,333

506

got very rude at times.

A simplicity aspect, I think,
is very, very important.

514
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:05,041
I mean, his love for
the Velvet Underground
and the whole Lou Reed thing,

515
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:07,125

that single that he loathed,

531
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,083
didn't give him satisfaction.

532
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,583
I don't know how
he coped with this,

533
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:13,625
except that I do know that
if you want something hard
enough and it's not happened,

it only makes you want to
go on and want it even more.

Oh, my word.

536
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:36,959
54 years or so of history
coming back at me.

537
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:43,083
Bowie was young. He was trying
to make a mark for himself.

538
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:47,709
And he was
very much a Jack the Lad,
there's no two ways about it.

539
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:50,542
But, I mean,
he was very funny to work with.

540
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:55,333
We did have a lot of moments
where we collapsed in laughter.

541
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,625
Where there's muck,
there's brass.

542
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:01,875
Crisp green shirt
and a lemonade sandwich
out on a horse-shoe.

543
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,750
That's where the men are.

544
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,667
David was an easy guy
to get along with, you know,

545
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,542
it's just that
his songs were wild.

546
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:15,083
One, two, one,
two, three, four.

547
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:17,875
They were totally quirky
and off-the-wall, you know.

548
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:21,792
And there are some really good
songs, and there are emotions,

549
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:23,458
and there are stories.

550
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,542
And this was the one thing
that Bowie was very good at.

551
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:27,875

a different viewpoint,

00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:16,542
singing songs that were--
appeared to be written
by children.

00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:19,792
I don't remember ever hearing,
really, any other song

565
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:25,875

told by children.

579
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:32,333
on the window sill over there.

580
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,125
And David would go, "Ta-da!"

581
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,333
And he'd do his Flowerpot Men.

582
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:42,291
He would jump around with
a terracotta pot on his head.

583
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:51,792
His father, John,
absolutely doted on him.

584
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:55,792
But David's mum, Peggy, never
became involved in games.

585
00:37:55,792 --> 00:38:00,959
She would sit and watch,
but she would never enthuse,
you know,

586
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,458
she wouldn't be,
"Oh, how wonderful"
or anything like that.

587
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:07,333
And she would often tell us
we were being soppy.

into the way I wrote a bit.

And I may have done that
a few times.

604
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:16,041
David's mum was quite quiet,
really, she didn't say a lot.

605
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,417
I wasn't sure if she liked me,
even, you know.

606
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,458
Because sometimes you--
you'd think,

607
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:24,792
"Well, maybe she doesn't
like me, she's a bit quiet
and doesn't say anything."

608
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:29,041
I never saw her laugh or smile.
Certainly not to me.

609
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:32,083
And, bless her heart,
when she died,

610
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,709
I wrote to David and said,

611
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:36,667
"I'm sorry about your mother,"
etcetera.

612
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:40,917
I said, "Actually, she never
quite took to me, your mother,"

00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:04,625
I think when David was young,

621
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,667
he suffered a lot

622
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:10,208
from the problems
in his parents' marriage.

623
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,959
They didn't engage in...

624
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:15,917
affectionate conversation
with each other.

625
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,959
John was very much
in love with Peggy.

626
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:24,959
Peggy would say to John's face
it was a marriage of
convenience.

627
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:27,458
And so there was this rift.

628
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:31,125
And David had
to be very careful,

629
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:36,625
if he allowed his father
to make too much of him,
it would annoy Peggy.

630
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:40,166
I think the most significant
thing in David's life

631
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:44,834
was that he was always
striving for Peggy's love.

632

The idea of writing,
sort of, short stories,

641
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:14,417
I think that was quite novel
at the time. Excuse the pun.

642
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,667
I was quite satisfied with
the way things were going.

643
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:21,375
I mean, I hadn't found any
voice style, and I hadn't found
any way to perform.

I mean, it was pretty
strong competition.

00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,750
Frankly, Bowie didn't
stand a chance, really,

648
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,750
and that's why the record,
I guess, at the time,

649
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,375
completely flopped.

650
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,458
I mean, it didn't really
do any business at all.

He was miming to certain
aspects of this album.

663
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,333
And news of that got to David,

664
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:40,959
and therefore, he went to see
one of Lindsay's performances.

665
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,250
And the curtains opened,

666
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,291
and there was a very beautiful
man sitting in the front row

667
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,792
who turned out
to be David Bowie.

668

Well, he came around
after the show,

669
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:59,917

a tatty curtain, which
he pulled to one side,

massive struggle,

762
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,834
that whole year.

763
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:36,917
I remember
there was this endless period

764
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:39,417
where I was, like, scrubbing
out people's kitchens.

765
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,333
I know I did that. Anything
to pick up a few dollars.

766
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:45,125
But I needed something that
didn't tie me down in any way,

767
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,667
so if an audition came along
or whatever,

768
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:49,834
I'd be free to do it, you know?

769
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:55,333
But by August,
it suddenly came to him

770
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,041

one of us could dance,

776
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:20,458
another one could sing, and
another one had some poetry,

777
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:24,667
and we put it all together.
And, uh, it went underground.

778
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:26,417
It was called Feathers.

779
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:27,834

780
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:30,291

David and, uh, Feathers,
we could do a song

785
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:47,083
quite heavy and quite deep.

786
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:50,166
But you can change
the mood on a gig

787
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:53,625
by doing something
with a nice snappy guitar riff.

788
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:55,917
And "Ching-A-Ling" song
was, uh, fine.

789
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:59,000
It was a good song.
And it had, uh,

790
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,917
you know, that was unusual,
in its way.

791
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,959
"Ching-A-Ling" was based
on David's 12-string,

792
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:13,542
his traveling piano, you know,
that's what he used
all the time to write on.

793
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:16,125
And as long as he stayed
on that instrument,

794
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,375
songs were gonna come out
that way. It was, you know,

795
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:21,875
you can't play, like, uh,
rock riffs on a 12-string.

796
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:24,041
You just can't.

797
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:30,583
He'd try one thing,
try another.

798
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:33,834
Things didn't--
If they didn't work out,
that was absolutely fine.

799
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:35,959
And just move on to the next.

800
00:50:35,959 --> 00:50:40,083
But he wasn't lost.
He just wasn't found either.

801
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:45,917
We used to do some mime pieces,
you know, and it was like

802
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:50,083
just throwing in
everything I knew to keep
an audience's attention

803
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,250
more than anything else.

804
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:58,000
I can't remember the specifics
of his performance,

805
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,917
other than what I photographed.

806
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:06,583
It was pretty much
like mime exercises,

807
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:08,792
but a bit extra.

808
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,750

809
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,083

'cause it seemed like a waste.

815
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:31,667
Color, whole different
thing and expense.

816
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:36,250
Yeah, he was obviously not
gonna be a massive star, so...

817
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,625
why would I want
color in my library?

818
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:42,333
David asked me to see

819
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:46,125
a little show that he'd
got together with Feathers.

820
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,667
I was walking home,

821
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:51,125
and I happened to glance in
the window of this junk shop.

822
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:52,875
And there it was.

823
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:55,959
It had a piece called The Mask.

824
00:51:55,959 --> 00:52:00,834
David, I suppose, had seen
Marcel Marceau along the line.

825
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:03,083
But he wasn't Marcel Marceau.

826
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:08,542
It was dreadful.

827
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,333
I cringed.
I really cringed.

828
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,917
And there are always
people that say,

829
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:23,792
"He was very good in
that miming, wasn't he?"

830
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:25,917
Oh, no, he was a load of shit.

831
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:31,208
Has any of the criticism or
any of the attacks hurt you?

832
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:34,625
Yes, everything hurts me
very much. I'm very sensitive.

833
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:37,500
But, uh, I put myself
in that position, so that's...

834
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,333
what I'm in for, isn't it?

835
00:52:41,542 --> 00:52:44,667
Feathers was never
destined to last.

836
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:49,291
He never said,
"Let's the three of us
get really famous together."

837
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,125
It was a stepping stone.

838
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,875
But I had also said to myself,

839
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:02,208
"Am I actually going to be with
David for the rest of my life?"

840
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:04,917
And I didn't think
I was actually going to.

841
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:06,709
He was clearly going somewhere.

842
00:53:06,709 --> 00:53:10,291
And I just didn't think
I was going to tread
that path with him.

843
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:20,166
Song of Norway was
a big MGM spectacular,

844
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:24,542
which needed dancers
for seven months or so.

845
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:29,250
It was something that
nobody in their right mind
would've turned down.

846
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,458
I just thought, "Yeah, this
is what I want to be doing."

847
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:39,041
I suddenly realized
that I had to...

848
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,917
I had to pull out, stop.

849
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:47,834
Oh, God, yes, my heart broke.

850
00:53:47,834 --> 00:53:50,458
She was doing
this funny romp in Norway

851
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:54,667
with bits of ballet in it, and
that she was, uh, cast in that.

852
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:58,417
God, I didn't get over that
for such a long time.

853
00:53:58,417 --> 00:54:00,333
It really broke me up.

854
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:03,959
I think he was vulnerable,

855
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:06,417
and he was scared
of being abandoned.

856
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:12,250
I think he was very hesitant
about giving himself.

857
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,291
And David must've been
very frightened

858
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:20,834

This feeling of isolation that

I think the isolation
of the film  2001

889
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:19,542
made itself very obvious
when I wrote the song
"Space Oddity,"

890
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,500
because for the first time,

891
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:26,500

how you could write

I didn't like it all that much.

914
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,333
And, uh, I handed it
to Gus Dudgeon.

915
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:15,709
He really loved David.

916
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,667
I said, "Tony, you're crazy.

917
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,500
Are you sure you don't wanna
do this song?" And he said,

918
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,250
"No, you wanna do it,
obviously." I said,
"I can't wait."

919
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:28,000
And, uh, so he said, "Well,
you do that on the B-side,

920
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,375
and I'll do
the rest of the album."
I said, "OK, fine."

921
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,875
If Gus were alive,
which he isn't, unfortunately,

922
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:38,000
he would be
presenting this to you.

923
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,625
And, uh, I was really,
really impressed

924
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:43,875
with the job that David and
Gus Dudgeon had done on this.

925
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:49,041
What makes this work is drama.

926
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:53,333
The first thing you hear is
an ominous 12-string guitar

927
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:55,625
fade up from nothing.

928
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:00,875
So all that is quite dramatic.

929
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,709
That's not
your average pop song.

930
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:06,542
But you know,
it doesn't hit you in the face,
doesn't hit you in the head.

931
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,709
It's drama.
And you're sucked into it.

932
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:12,333

clever device that he used.

the mighty little Stylophone.

937
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:34,583

942
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:05,834
And another new thing
it had on it,

943
01:00:05,834 --> 01:00:09,375
which the Beatles kind of
debuted, was the Mellotron.

944
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:24,750
David wanted it,
because he wanted it to sound,

945
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,959
not like strings,
but like strings.

946
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:30,333
And I knew exactly what
he meant. It's recorded strings.

947
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:31,834
So, tapes inside.

948
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:38,792
Um, but one of the problems
you have with this instrument

949
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:43,291
is that, uh, a note
only lasts eight seconds.

950
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:45,000
And then, it cuts out.

951
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,333
So, if you hold
a chord long enough,

952
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:51,041
and sometimes you need
to hold it for a lot longer
than eight seconds,

953
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,625
after you get to
the eight-second mark,
it starts to...

954
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:58,542
to do that, which is why
I hated the bloody thing,

955
01:00:58,542 --> 01:01:00,333

honest with you.

and they'd say,
"Hey, Major Tom" and all that.
People would see him, you know.

978

981
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:52,959
But they said, "You'll never
write another song

982
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:55,208
like this again,"
and he didn't.

983
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:59,208
What he did come up with
was something no one
dreamt about at the time.

984
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:03,500
He was the first rock star
to take on a different identity.

985
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,333
In other words, it was
Ziggy Stardust by David Bowie.

986
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:09,542
That was his stroke of genius.

987
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:14,542
Off the record, what
everybody told me is that,

988
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:16,917
"David, you've gotta
have a single."

989
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:19,166
So, I said,
"Right, I'll go away,

990
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:23,333
and I'll write an RP-type
single in my style.

991
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,959
Based loosely on "Oddity."

992
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:27,875
Loosely on "Space Oddity".

993
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:29,333
-Right.
-So that people say,

994
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:32,333
"Ah, this is what we were
waiting for from David Bowie,

995
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,709
is a follow-up
to 'Space Oddity.'"

996
01:03:34,709 --> 01:03:39,000
That's "Starman."
"Starman" was strictly,
I wrote it in about 15 minutes.

997
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,250
I used every cliché phrase
I could think of

998
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,667
to do with starmen and people
in space    and

999
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:46,959

album in Trident studio,

1025
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:17,834
David used to walk about
like he was a star.

1026
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:19,583
You could see it just by--

1027
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,250
He could walk into a pub,
and you think,

1028
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,458
"He's gonna be a star," and
you could t--, you know, that.

his music or his playing
at that time, you know.

1030

a folky singer.

01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:34,125
He wasn't, like,
the rock God he became.

1032
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:38,583
But, then again,
David was very deep, you know?

1033
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,250
He would never...

1034
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,375
wore his heart on his sleeve,

1035
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:44,959
he would never come out to you
and say, "I'm really worried
about this," you know.

1036
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,125

almost neo-gothic pile

1080
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:14,125
down in Beckenham
called Haddon Hall.

1081
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:18,333
Which had some kind of, uh,
baronial hall entrance
hall-type thing.

1082
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:20,667
And the band that
we collected together,

1083
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:23,041
Visconti and,
at the time, Angela,

1084
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:25,667
all kind of shared this,
uh, baronial hall.

1085
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:28,333
So it's kind of
a commune thing.

1086
01:09:32,709 --> 01:09:37,250
Angie, when I met her,
was this free spirit.

1087
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:41,542
She was outspoken, had courage
like you wouldn't believe.

1088
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:44,792
She could walk up to anybody and
give them a piece of her mind.

1089
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:46,375
Or get things.

1090
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:49,166
And Angie was the one
who made things happen.

1091
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:02,542
Mick came from Hull, you know,
and was very down to Earth.

1092
01:10:05,542 --> 01:10:08,375
But when I first heard
him play, I thought,

1093
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:12,583
"That's my Jeff Beck. He is
fantastic, this kid is great."

1094
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:15,750
And so, I sort of hoodwinked
him into working with me.

1095
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:21,875
What David should've said was,
"He's my Mick Ronson."

1096
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,959
Mick was his own man.

1097
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:28,125
He could play like Beck,

1098
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:31,458
but he was definitely
a very different guitarist

1099
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:34,667
in the sense that Mick was
also a violinist and a pianist.

1100
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,709
He studied classical music.

1101
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:41,625
He picked up things that most
rock guitarists didn't know.

1102
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:46,959
My new band was called Hype.

1103
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:50,125
Tony Visconti on bass,
Mick Ronson on guitar,

1104
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,250
and John Cambridge on drums.

1105
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:55,875

1112
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:28,166
at the Roundhouse with Hype.

1113
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:31,625
And I think it was probably
my first costume band.

1114
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:37,500
And our respective girlfriends
and wives and whatever

1115
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,500
put together all these
really ridiculous, like,

1116
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,333
cartoon capers
comic hero costumes.

1117
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:48,834
The Roundhouse gig
with the costumes,

1118
01:11:48,834 --> 01:11:50,291
that was Angie's idea.

1119
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:52,166
She said we should
all get dressed up,

1120
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:55,333
and maybe David
did want to maybe, uh,

1121
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:58,542
a bit in it as well, but
Angie had a lot to do with it.

1122
01:11:58,542 --> 01:12:02,333
I was Cowboy Man with a cowboy
hat on. I had a frilly shirt.

1123
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:06,166
Ronson was Guitar Gangster,

1124
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:08,291
and he wore a sort of
gangster's outfit.

1125
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:11,208

this kind of Spaceman,

silver llama and all that.

1127
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:15,667

1160

1164
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:31,667
And then David would come down
the staircase in the dress.

1165
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,208
You know,
you'd never seen that before.

1166
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:38,041
"It's a man's dress." I said,
"Yeah, I assumed that,"
you know?

1167
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,667
It was definitely
a man's dress.

1168
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:45,417
Although zipped up
in the same way as a woman's.

1169
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:47,875
We all wore dresses
at that time.

1170
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:51,667

I was still very much trying
to find who I was as a writer.

1174
01:15:08,875 --> 01:15:11,750
And electric music was
appealing to me more and more.

1175
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,542

kind of guitar-oriented things.

The Man Who Sold The World

1179
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:28,208
is not completely disconnected
from the Led Zeppelin style

1180
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:31,125
heavy metal that was beginning
to arrive, as well.

1181
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:36,709
I think all the sounds
that he's going through

1182
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:39,917
are things that he's listening
to, having a look at,

1183
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:42,417
pulling into the next record
and, you know,

1184
01:15:42,417 --> 01:15:44,291

going on from there.

1189
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:04,041
On  Man Who Sold The World,

1190
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:07,792
he was starting to get
more of a concept of

1191
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:10,750
"I'll do what I want to do"

1192
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,959
lyrically, particularly,
and song-wise.

1193
01:16:13,959 --> 01:16:18,417
Um,  Man Who Sold The World
opened the floodgates.

1194
01:16:18,417 --> 01:16:22,000
I think he was learning that
his ideas could be put across.

1195
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,792
And I think the times when
he didn't compromise

1196
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:27,875
on what he wanted to say
were the successful things.

1197

One of my, sort of,
half-siblings

1201
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:47,667
meant so much to me in my early
years, and his name was Terry.

1202
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:50,458
He was my half-brother.
My mother's son.

1206
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,542
Terry probably gave me

1207
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:05,542
the greatest education
that I could ever have had.

1208
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:10,333
I mean, he just introduced
me to the outside things.

1209
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:15,083
And I guess Terry had shown me

1210
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:18,542
that there has always been
a history of the outside,

1211
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:19,625
of the rebel.

1212
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:21,291
Of not being in the center,

1213
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:24,542
not being drawn to
the tyranny of the mainstream.

1214
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:29,709
But then he would go away
for long periods.

1215
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:33,875
One period he went away,
he joined the, uh, RAF.

1216
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:37,375
And when he came back,
he had changed considerably.

1217
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:40,875
And was showing very evident
signs of schizophrenia.

1218
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:44,083
And then,
he went into hospital,

1219
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:47,166
and he stayed in hospital
for the rest of his life.

Insanity was something
that I was terribly fearful of.

1231
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:27,959
But I felt that
I was the lucky one,

1232
01:18:27,959 --> 01:18:31,875
because as long as
I could put those psychological
excesses into my music,

1233
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:35,667
then I could always
be throwing it off.

1234
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:39,000
One of the porkies
that David perpetuated

1235
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,709
for a very long time was
that he came from a family

1236
01:18:43,709 --> 01:18:47,041
where insanity
seemed to be the norm.

1237
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:49,500
And it just wasn't true.

1238
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,041
Yes, Terry had his breakdown.

1239
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:57,458
But, um, I believe
it was a bad acid trip.

1240
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:05,917
Every arrangement we did

1241
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:08,625
on  The Man Who Sold The World
album,

1242
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,917
we started them
in Haddon Hall,

1243
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:13,750
but we finished most
of the album in the studio

1244
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:17,458
and made up
our own parts on the spot.

1245
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:21,417
And David would
go off into the hallway
and write the lyrics.

1246
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:23,125
I'd go out half an hour later,

1247
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,417
and he'd just be
holding hands with Angie.

1248
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:28,834
I'd go, "Come on, write the
damn lyrics, for God's sake!"

1249
01:19:28,834 --> 01:19:31,792
The Man Who Sold The World
was writ--,

1250
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:34,792
the lyrics were written on
the same day we recorded it,

1251
01:19:34,792 --> 01:19:36,458
which was the last day
of the album.

1252
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:42,583
"The Man Who Sold The World"
as a song

1253
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,083
was kind of about

1254
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:48,458
meeting himself in the future
and where he'd been

1255
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:51,000
and you kind of--

1256
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,417

"OK, it's pretty hard rock
and progressive, a lot of it."

1267
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:39,083
So, imagine you've got a
Zeppelin album, a Sabbath album,

1268
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,166
and this guy in a dress.

1269
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:45,041

I was having to create
a bill out of nothing.

1276
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:26,250
And so, I started off with
people that I liked and knew.

1277
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:29,208
So, I rang David and said, "Are
you interested in doing it?"

1278
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:33,083
Got Angie, who said, "No,
he's doing some solo gigs, and

1279
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:36,959
he's not enjoying them
very much," um,

1280
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:40,333
in her inimitable way.

1281
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:43,208
And then, I rang again and got
David a couple of days later,

1282
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:46,750
and he said, "Well, I'm kind of
interested in doing it."

1283
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:52,959
I did the second festival
ever in 1971.

1284
01:21:52,959 --> 01:21:56,583
I got on at 5:30
in the morning.

1285
01:21:56,583 --> 01:22:01,417

You're letting
the lyrics down, badly.

1290
01:22:20,792 --> 01:22:23,792
David, Angie, and I
went to Glastonbury.

1291
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:29,792
And I do remember
people crawling out of their
sleeping bags and their tents.

1292
01:22:29,792 --> 01:22:32,834

around waking people up.

1301
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,166
I could see little scurrying
figures up the hillside

01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:07,208
from my seat
on the side of the stage.

1303
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:11,333

01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,375
And I just saw the world
in another kind of fashion.

1348
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:34,959
And it was about pushing
together all the pieces

1349
01:25:34,959 --> 01:25:37,750
and all the things
that fascinated me culturally.

1350

he needed a character

and to put his ideas across.

1358
01:25:57,542 --> 01:26:00,709
It seemed like
he really needed that.

1359
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:04,667

chat show like this.

1391
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:16,250
I don't mean, "How many years
do you give yourself in life?"

1392
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,583
But how many years can you
be a head of the glamor field

1393
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,208
and the head
of the glitter field?

1394

Oh, no, I've never
been ahead of anything.

01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:25,166
I've been, I think on my own.

1396
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:27,375
I'm not, I'm not in an Olympics.

1397
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:38,083
The artist
is strictly a figment

1398
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:40,125
of people's imagination.

1399
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:41,750
I really believe that.

1400
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:45,083
We're the original false
prophets, we are the Gods.

1401
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:47,917
We want it all, you know,
we want all the adulation

1402
01:28:47,917 --> 01:28:49,625
and people to read the lyrics
and everything,

1403
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:51,959
just to play the game.

1404
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:53,667
We don't exist.

1405
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:56,834
And I know that that, that's--
I feel that same emptiness

1406
01:28:56,834 --> 01:29:00,333
that they all feel
when they get there.

1407
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:02,583
'Cause they know
that it's not real.

1408
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,667
David didn't like
a comfort zone.

1409
01:29:06,667 --> 01:29:08,709
He could've done Ziggy
for his whole life,

1410
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:12,834
and he would've had fans,
but he wanted to move on.

1411
01:29:12,834 --> 01:29:16,208
So, I knew Ziggy was not
gonna be long-lived.

1412
01:29:17,917 --> 01:29:20,208
Well, it's the last one
tonight, you know?

1413
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:23,375
Is it? Oh, I heard it was last
for all time, is that right?

1414
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:25,208
We shall see
at the end of the show.

1415
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:28,125
Has been mentioned.

1416
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:30,375
You're making an announcement,
are you, tonight?

1417
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:33,875
Um, if that's the case,
I will be.

1418
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:36,959
I knew that it was
a very important show.

1419
01:29:36,959 --> 01:29:38,417
I knew he was nervous.

1420
01:29:38,417 --> 01:29:41,542
Because something
was really working.

1421
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:45,083
And he spent a decade
working to that.

1422
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,709
Go away.

1423
01:29:49,709 --> 01:29:51,333
I can glean that you're nervous,

1424
01:29:51,333 --> 01:29:53,750
but I really think
the audience you have tonight,

1425
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:56,583
it's the easiest
you've ever had.

1426
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:59,125

We finished the last song

1446
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:03,333
and David walked
to my side of the stage.

1447
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:06,208
And said, "Don't start
'Rock And Roll Suicide,'"

1448
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:08,875
which I play the intro on,

1449
01:31:08,875 --> 01:31:10,333
"until I tell you."

1450
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:15,417
So I figured
he must be gonna say,

1451
01:31:15,417 --> 01:31:19,041
"Thanks for the tour, we'll see
you in September," or whatever.

1452
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:20,458
But he didn't.

1453
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,417
Of all the shows on this tour,

1454
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:26,500
this, this particular show
will remain with us the longest.

1455
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:30,291
-Because...

1456
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:34,709
not only is it, not only is it
the last show of the tour,

1457
01:31:34,709 --> 01:31:40,458
but it's the last show that
we'll ever do. Thank you.

1458
01:31:40,458 --> 01:31:44,417
I thought,
"OK, maybe this is a stunt."

1459
01:31:44,417 --> 01:31:46,500
And then, part of me was going,

1460
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,208
"I've just got the sack."

the very height of his career,

1470

he was extinguishing it

1471
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:29,834

And I think

1479
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:57,250
what he had that most artists
didn't have is he had a sense of

1480
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,250
what is commercial, what works,

1481
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:03,750

was a culmination

1485
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:19,792
of all the things that David
tried to do in the 60's.

1486
01:33:19,792 --> 01:33:24,917
I think with Ziggy Stardust,
he achieved the success,

1487
01:33:24,917 --> 01:33:28,875
uh, that an individual like
Ziggy Stardust would aim for.

1488
01:33:30,458 --> 01:33:33,333
But David himself
wasn't Ziggy Stardust.

1489
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:36,709
So, I think he'd already
stepped outside of
that character,

1490
01:33:36,709 --> 01:33:38,875
back into being David Bowie.

1491
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:43,291
Thank you very much.

1492
01:33:43,291 --> 01:33:44,875
Bye-bye, we love you.

1493
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,917
To make the kind of
breakthrough I needed,

1494
01:33:53,917 --> 01:33:56,333
I had to put on a few trappings
