1
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,442
早上好
Good morning.

2
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:55,411
现在是美丽的库母茨郡的上午八点
It's 8:00 in wonderful Coombs County,

3
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:58,714
本地警方再一次拒绝确认或否认…
where once again state police have refused to confirm or deny

4
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:02,318
当地居民接连目睹的神秘“空中之光”的发现
more of those mysterious "lights in the sky" sightings by local residents.

5
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,787
以下是“漫游空中”电台记者对目击者…
Roving air reporters spoke with Miss Josie Floss,

6
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:06,255
乔西福洛斯女士所作的采访
who made just such a sighting.

7
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:08,891
我亲眼看见那些亮光
I've seen those lights with my own eyes.

8
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:12,191
当我报警的时候，他们告诉我说那是沼气在燃烧
And when I called the police, they told me it was swamp gas.

9
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:17,232
简直是扯淡！库母茨郡哪儿来的沼气？
Bullshit! Ain't no swamps in Coombs County!

10
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,368
我跟你说，非法的外来生物将借助这光…
I tell you, with them illegal aliens...

11
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,838
又是个好天气啊！
Gonna be a sparkling day.

12
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:24,306
好天气！
Sparkling.

13
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:28,267
简直要把我逼疯了！克莱拉！
Makes me crazy! Clara!

14
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:30,746
克莱拉！
Clara!

15
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:33,082
我这儿又没电了，克莱拉！
My electric's gone out again, Clara!

16
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,617
我要错过我的肥皂剧了！
I'm gonna miss my soaps!

17
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:35,718
行了，你别嚷嚷了！
Oh, stop your yakking.

18
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,852
比尔？
Bill?

19
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:39,355
比尔，艾尔维拉那儿又停电了
Bill, Elvira's blacked out again.

20
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:40,623
帮我传个话
Pass the word.

21
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:41,824
过得愉快，宝贝儿！
Have a nice day, honey.

22
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:43,292
好的。谢谢你，布恩夫人。你也一样
Okay, thanks, Mrs. Boone. You, too.

23
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:46,228
艾尔维拉那儿又没电了
Elvira's got no electric.

24
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,531
她看不成她的肥皂剧了。她要气炸了！
She can't see her soaps, she'll hyperventilate.

25
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:50,933
是个野餐的好日子，玛姬！
Great day for a picnic, Maggie!

26
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:53,002
我真是等不及了，布恩先生。祝你逮到条大鱼哦！
Can't wait, Mr. Boone. Catch yourself a big one!

27
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:54,069
尽力而为
If I can!

28
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,839
奶奶，你的午餐做好放在冰箱里了
Granny, I fixed your lunch and put it in the fridge.

29
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,973
玩得尽兴哦，孩子！
Have fun, child.

30
00:03:57,974 --> 00:03:59,141
你确定你一个人能行吗？
Sure you're gonna be okay?

31
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:00,209
我没事的，宝贝儿
I'll be fine, dear.

32
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,406
你管你去吧。再见！
Now you just run along. Bye!

33
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:08,817
嗨，罗根夫人
Hi, Mrs. Rogan.

34
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:09,952
嗨，玛姬
Hi, Maggie.

35
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:12,221
野餐盒找到了吗？
Did you find that picnic basket yet?

36
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:13,288
在客厅里呢
It's in the living room.

37
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,324
哦，谢谢。亚里克斯呢？
Oh, thanks. Where's Alex?

38
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:16,692
他还能去哪儿呢？
Where else?

39
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:17,922
对了
Right.

40
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:20,526
路易斯
Louis.

41
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,134
早上好，太空之子路易斯
Good morning, space-son Louis.

42
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:26,468
地球人啊！
Earthling.

43
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:27,800
路易斯
Louis!

44
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:29,269
珍妮！
Jane!

45
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,307
艾尔维拉那儿又没电了
Elvira's electric is out again,

46
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:35,642
她要是看不到她的肥皂剧又要发疯了！
and she's gonna get hyper if she can't see her soaps!

47
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:39,348
奶奶，告诉艾尔维拉，亚里克斯会赶在肥皂剧开始前…
Granny, tell Elvira that Alex will be over

48
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,917
把线路修好的
to patch her electric in time for the soaps.

49
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,353
我会告诉她的，珍妮。艾尔维拉！
I'll tell her, Jane. Elvira!

50
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:45,888
-路易斯！ -艾尔维拉！
- Louis! - Elvira!

51
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,489
路易斯！
Louis!

52
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,024
去把亚里克斯叫过来
Go tell Alex that I need him.

53
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,526
当心着点，外星人！
Beware, aliens.

54
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,723
路易斯 罗根――宇宙军学员…
Louis Rogan, the cosmic cadet,

55
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:55,058
太空复仇者――前来收拾你！

58

作好准备！即将发射升空！

63
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:31,457

00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:38,373
等他们经过中点时…
They're all through the center.

66
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:39,808
就射击，知道了吗？
Shoot them, okay?

67
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:41,877
现在自下向上射击
Now from the bottom up, okay.

行，打得不错。那里！
Okay, doing good. Right up there.

70
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:46,782
把你的头挪开好吧，路易斯？
Move your head, will you, Louis?

71
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:47,841
啊，对不起
Uh, sorry.

72
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,689

嘿，大伙儿！你们好吗？

快点儿，亚里克斯。他们到了！

76
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:08,770
星空战士亚里克斯 罗根请求…
Well, Starfighter Alex Rogan requests permission

77
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:11,540
转由我弟弟路易斯来驾驶，长官！
to turn the bridge over to my little brother, Louis, sir!

78
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,476
哈哈，你们这群白痴死定了！
Okay, you dorks are dead.

79
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,447
你被打败了。请再投入二十五美分
You are defeated. 25 cents more, please.

80
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:20,048

00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:34,530
噢，不。我不想去了

00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:35,798
这次又怎么了，罗根？
What's it this time, Rogan?

88
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,266
你要打算参军了？

89
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:38,901
是，长官，乡亲们。都来看看啊！

很好笑哦，布雷克
Funny, Blake.

93
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:50,379

You guys think I'm gonna hang out here, watch you shine your pickup,

94
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,339

go to the drive-in, get drunk and throw up every Saturday night,

95
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,452
还跟在别人屁股后面上大学？

96
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,922
得了吧，伙计。我要用生命成就一番大业
Forget it, man. I'm doing something with my life.

100
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,498
哦，妈，那要花掉我一整天
Oh, Ma, that's gonna take all day.

101
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:11,466
我还打算去银湖玩呢
I was going to Silver Lake.

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,520
那…你们…
Look. You...

108
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,122
你们去吧。我不去了
You'd just better go ahead without me.

109
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:35,691
不，亚里克斯，我留下
No. Alex, I'll stay.

110
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:37,717
不用，没关系的。修好得要花上一段时间
No. That's okay. This'll take a while.

111
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,886
我修好了来找你们
I'll catch up with you later.

112
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,064
亚里克斯…
Alex...

113
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:50,672
拜拜，罗根！
Bye-bye, Rogan!

00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:58,412
亚里克斯，快来帮忙啊！
Alex, come help me!

116
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:02,782
嘿，亚里克斯，能帮我一下吗？
Hey, Alex. Could you give me a hand here?

117
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,419
谢谢啦，亚里克斯！
Thanks, Alex!

118
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,303
我们今晚该做点什么呢？
What should we do tonight?

119
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,914
谁知道啊
I don't know.

120
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,050
打牌怎么样？
How about cards?

121
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,883
嘿，是个好主意！

00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:45,260
太太们今晚要进城跳舞
The missus wants to go into town tonight and go dancing.

125
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:19,592
鱼在水里使老大劲地向下扯
The fish were really biting down there at the stream.

126
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:23,094
今天钓得真尽兴

我研究了好多年了

00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:10,345
哦，嗨，亚里克斯
Oh, hi, Alex.

138
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:11,541
嘿，Otis
Hey, Otis.

139
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:17,449
你的玛姬呢？
Where's your Maggie?

140
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:20,455
问得好
Good question.

141
00:10:20,456 --> 00:10:21,947
我想…在外面玩得尽兴着呢
Out having a good time, I guess.

142
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:26,194
哦，你从来也没玩得尽兴过
Oh. And you never have a good time.

143
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:27,562
对不对？
Is that it?

144
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:30,565
是啊。我就喜欢帮人维修用了三十年的保险丝箱
Oh, sure. I love patching 30-year-old fuse panels

145
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,796
还喜欢帮人通马桶
and plunging people's toilets.

146
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:34,970
Otis，我从来也没有机会…
Otis, I never even get a chance

147
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:36,530
在这儿玩得尽兴过
to have a good time around here.

148
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:41,801
事情总是会改变的。永远都这样
Things change. Always do.

149
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,249
你会有机会的
You'll get your chance.

150
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,551
重要的是，当它来临时…
lmportant thing is, when it comes,

151
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:53,284
你要用双手紧紧地抓住它
you got to grab it with both hands and hold on tight.

152
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,523
敌军在三、六、七区，快速接近中
Enemy squadrons in Sectors 3, 6, 7 closing fast.

153
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:11,106
谢谢你，杰克
Thanks, Jack.

154
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:12,207
别客气
You're welcome.

155
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,607
-晚安，玛姬 -晚安
Good night, Maggie. Good night.

156
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,478
我还以为你会去湖边找我呢
Thought you were gonna meet me at the lake.

157
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,946
发生了什么事？
What happened?

158
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:53,505
相同的事总是发生。我没办法脱身
Same thing that always happens. I couldn't get away.

159
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,578
其他人呢？
Where's everybody else?

160
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:00,280
哦，他们去看电影了
Oh, they went to a movie.

161
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:06,128
老杰克 布雷克碰巧和你同路，啊？
Old Jack Blake just happened to be going your way, huh?

162
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,256
敌军在三区出现
Enemy squadron in Sector 3.

163
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,200
他说他正好顺路回家
He said it was on his way home.

164
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:14,363
布雷克住在镇的那头
Blake lives on the other side of town.

165
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:16,401
拜托，亚里克斯
Come on, Alex.

166
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:19,735
我就想回到你身边
I wanted to get back to you.

167
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:23,812
可以了吧？
Okay?

168
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:31,645
打得不错，星空战士！你真行！
Good show, Starfighter! Way to go.

169
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:34,312
亚里克斯，看啊！
Alex, look!

170
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:38,123
哦，天啊！有多少？九十万？
Oh, my God. What is that? 900,000!

171
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,166
九十万！你要破纪录了！
900,000! You gonna bust the record!

172
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:54,976
嘿！嘿！大家，听好了！
Hey! Hey! Listen up, everybody!

173
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:57,571
亚里克斯破纪录了！
Alex is going for the record!

174
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:00,114
纪录？
Record?

175
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:01,750
去…去看看
Take... Take a hand.

176
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,413
打中了！哦，他就要打中那架了！
Got them! Oh, he's gonna get that one!

177
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:09,948
你行的！
You can do it!

178
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:12,227
Otis？
Otis?

179
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:17,365
Otis，你在嚷嚷什么？发生什么事了？
Otis, what are you yelling about? What's wrong?

180
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,534
快来啊！快！
Come on! Come on!

181
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:21,469
他就要破纪录了！
He's going to bust the record!

182
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,506
快！快！
Hurry! Hurry!

183
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:26,808
大家都退后！别挤到他！
Everyone get back! Don't crowd him!

184
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,834
我说了，快退后！
I said, get back!

185
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:39,654
亚里克斯，你以前从来没打出过这个成绩！
Alex, you never got this far before!

186
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:41,021
加油，亚里克斯！
Go, Alex!

187
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:48,228
真争气！
Good boy!

188
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,901
柯-旦指挥舰进入射程
Ko-Dan command ship entering kill zone.

189
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:54,102
指挥舰！
Command ship!

190
00:13:54,103 --> 00:13:55,370
哦，是指挥舰！
Oh, command ship!

191
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:57,005
指挥舰是什么？
What's a command ship?

192
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,974
你行的，亚里克斯！你绝对行！
You can do it, Alex! You can do it!

193
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:06,381
再来一次！加油啊！就是它！
One more now. Come on! That's the one!

194
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:08,646
要打的就是它！
That's the one we want!

195
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,527
好啊！太棒了！
Yeah! Yeah!

196
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:54,663
晚安。你真行，亚里克斯！
Good night. Way to go, Alex!

197
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:55,764
晚安，孩子们
Good night, kids.

198
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:57,255
亚里克斯，你真够可以的
Alex, you're something else.

199
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,967
你真棒，孩子
You're wonderful, boy.

200
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:00,663
谢谢
Thank you.

201
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:02,604
我说的话准能成真
If I said it once, I said it a thousand times.

202
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:04,205
那孩子见得了世面
That boy's gonna go places.

203
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:05,765
他真够聪明的
That's one smart boy.

204
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:21,883
晚安，亚里克斯
Good night, Alex.

205
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,761
“晚安，亚里克斯”？等等
"Good night, Alex"? Wait a second.

206
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:28,924
玛姬？玛姬？
Maggie? Maggie?

207
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:33,360
等一下。你要去哪里？
Hold on a second. Where are you going?

208
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,665
怎么了？
What's wrong?

209
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:44,038
我突然才发觉…
Well, I guess it just hit me.

210
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:47,248
你真的要离开这儿了，对吗？
You really are leaving here, aren't you?

211
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:49,451
当然，我当然要走。我们一起离开这里
Of course, I'm leaving. We're both gonna leave here.

212
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:51,986
-我们一起，亚里克斯？ -是啊
Both of us, Alex? Yeah.

213
00:15:51,987 --> 00:15:54,322
我们对此已经谈过了
We talked about this.

214
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,824
等我入了学，我就会找个地方…
When I get to school, I'm gonna find a place

215
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:57,292
然后回来接你
and I'm gonna come back and get you.

216
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:58,817
那…奶奶怎么办？
Well, what about Granny?

217
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:01,093
奶奶？
Granny?

218
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:05,500
其实是你自己害怕离开这个拖车场吧？
Truth is, you're scared of leaving this trailer park.

219
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:08,002
我才不怕离开这个拖车场呢，亚里克斯
I'm not scared of leaving this trailer park, Alex.

220
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:10,063
嘿，听好
Hey. Listen.

221
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:16,370
无论发生什么，我都和你在一起，对吧？
Whatever happens, it's you and me forever, right?

222
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,275
对吧？
Right?

223
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,943
我真的很爱你，亚里克斯
I love you so much, Alex.

224
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,111
我也永远爱你，玛姬
I'll always love you, Maggs.

225
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,091
真恶心
Diarrhea.

226
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,907
玛姬！玛姬！
Maggie! Maggie!

227
00:16:51,614 --> 00:16:55,416
亚里克斯，我要回去了。晚安
Alex, I got to go in. Good night.

228
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:57,352
-晚安 -晚安
Good night. Good night.

229
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:20,167
总有一天他们会说：“一切就是从这开始的”
Someday they're gonna say, "This is where it all began."

230
00:17:20,843 --> 00:17:21,943
什么意思？
What?

231
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:24,242
妈，我终于打破了“星空战士”的纪录
Mom, I finally broke the Starfighter record.

232
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,340
哦，那太好了，宝贝儿
Oh, that's nice, dear.

233
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:30,118
好？简直是令人惊叹！
Nice? It's stupendous!

234
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,453
亚里克斯
Uh, Alex,

235
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:35,523
布兰纳先生知道你想尽快看到这个…
Mr. Brenner knew that you'd want to see this as soon as possible,

236
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:38,226
所以他把这个带到了餐馆…
so he brought it by the diner and...

237
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:40,862
我很兴奋，所以就把它打开了
Well, I was so excited, I opened it.

238
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,764
哦，没关系。里面说什么？
Oh, that's okay. What is it?

239
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:44,562
是关于你的贷款
It's about your loan.

240
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:53,698
你仍然可以和你的朋友一起上大学
You can still go to City College with your friends.

241
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:36,451
你好，星空战士！
Greetings, Starfighter.

242
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,123
你好，星空战士！

243
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:45,026

You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier.

244
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:46,261

245
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:47,462

248
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:54,426

249
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:59,307
作好准备！即将发射升空！
Get ready. Prepare for blastoff.

250
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:45,717
你好。请问，孩子…
Hello. Excuse me, son.

251
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,657
商店已经关门了，先生
Store's closed, mister.

252
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:52,393
我不是来买香烟或者泡泡糖的，孩子
I'm not here for cigarettes or bubble gum, my boy.

253
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:53,395
你能不能告诉我…
Can you tell me the name of the person

254
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:55,530
打破那边那个游戏纪录的人的名字？
who broke the record on that game over there?

255
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:57,465
我在哪里可以找到他？
Where I might find him?

256
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:01,971
是亚里克斯 罗根。他现在就在你面前
Alex Rogan. You're looking at him.

257
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:05,265
亚里克斯 罗根。啊哈！
Alex Rogan. Aha!

258
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,209
-你是谁？ -森特利是我的名字
Who are you? Centauri's the name.

259
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,611
那个游戏是我发明的。它就是我来这儿的原因
I invented Starfighter, which is why I'm here.

260
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,046
-真的？ -当然
It is? It is.

261
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,682
我们得谈谈一件极重要的事
We have to talk about a matter of utmost importance.

262
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,451
请进入我的办公室
Step into my office.

263
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:18,852
就是它。进来吧
That's it. Come on now.

264
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:21,590
没什么好怕的
Nothing to be afraid of.

265
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:29,361
哦，对了。和我的助手贝塔打个招呼
Oh, yes. Say hello to my assistant, Beta.

266
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:31,528
你好
Howdy.

267
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:34,361
嗷！
Ow!

268
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:37,905
我必须就你的精彩表现恭喜你，我的孩子
I must congratulate you on your virtuoso performance, my boy.

269
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:39,272
你给森特利留下了深刻的印象
Centauri is impressed.

270
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:40,875
我见过有人来，也见过有人去…
I've seen them come and I've seen them go.

271
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:43,077
但是你是最棒的，我的孩子。漂亮！
But you're the best, my boy. Dazzling.

272
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:45,069
比其他人好十万八千里
Light years ahead of the competition.

273
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:47,239
这就是为什么森特利要来这儿
Which is why Centauri is here.

274
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,918
他有点事来找你
He's got a little proposition for you.

275
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:52,182
你有兴趣吗？
Are you interested?

276
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:54,853
我想是吧
I guess.

277
00:20:56,658 --> 00:20:57,853
嘿！
Hey!

278
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:05,500
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

279
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:06,634
听着
Listen.

280
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:08,469
森特利想要给你一个惊喜
Centauri wants to keep it for a surprise.

281
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,134
相信我，你会喜欢它的。一定会的！
Trust me. Oh, you're gonna love it. Love it!

282
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:21,883
好笑的是，这一切都是出于一个错误
The amusing thing about this, it's all a big mistake.

283
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,551
那个游戏…
That particular Starfighter game

284
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:25,553
应该被运往维加斯的
was supposed to be delivered to Vegas,

285
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:27,722
而不是你们那个在野草和虫子堆里的…
not some flea-speck trailer park

286
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:29,590
芝麻大小的拖车场
in the middle of tumbleweeds and tarantulas.

287
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:32,660
所以，一定是宿命，命运――误打误撞地…
So, it must be fate, destiny, blind chance,

288
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:34,425
甚至可以说是运气――把我们带到一起
luck, even, that brings us together.

289
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:38,292
有首诗说得好：“往事如烟”
And as the poet says, "The rest is history."

290
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,045
你要去哪儿？为什么要带我去？
Where are you going? Where are you taking me?

291
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:53,981
我告诉过你了，我要给你一个惊喜
I told you. I wanna save it for a surprise.

292
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:58,886
嘿，你是不是那种急着先读谜底的孩子？
Hey. Are you the kind of kid who reads the last page of a mystery first?

293
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:01,355
那些缠着魔术师追问奥秘的孩子？
Who pesters the magician to tell you his tricks?

294
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:04,025
那些悄悄溜下楼偷看圣诞礼物的孩子？
Who sneaks downstairs to peek at his Christmas presents?

295
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:06,360
不，你当然不是那样的！
No. Of course you're not!

296
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:09,160
所以我先不告诉你
That's why I'm not gonna tell you.

297
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:11,489
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

298
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:16,601
除此之外，我最喜欢惊喜了。难道你不是吗？
Besides, I just love surprises, don't you?

299
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:19,197
嘿！看好了！
Hey, look out!

300
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:20,675
-停车！ -天啊！
Stop! Oh, dear!

301
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:22,439
快踩刹车！嘿…
Hit the brakes! Hey...

302
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:24,172
在哥伦比亚星切换为星球驱动模式
Shifting into star drive at Columba Zeta.

303
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:25,868
抓紧了
Hold tight.

304
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:29,194
嘿。嘿，让我出去！
Hey. Hey, let me out of here!

305
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,599
应该有一个完全符合逻辑的理由来解释这一切
There's a perfectly logical explanation for all this.

306
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:33,627
嘿！等等！你要去哪儿？
Hey! Wait! Where you going?

307
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:51,506
嗨！你好。这是什么？
Hi! How are you? What is this?

308
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:54,780
听着，你会说英语吗？我…
Listen. Do you speak English? I'd...

309
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,051
这是很不错，可是…
This is nice but...

310
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:12,133
森特利，这里发生什么情况？
Centauri, what's going on here?

311
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:14,402
他说你能来这儿他很高兴…
He's just saying how delighted he is that you're here.

312
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:15,603
还有，如果你有什么需要能让你在这儿过得愉快…
And if there's anything he can do

313
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:17,605
给他打个电话就行
to make your stay more enjoyable, just give him a ring.

314
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:20,975
在这儿？你在说些什么？我们在哪儿？
My stay? What are you talking about? Where are we?

315
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:23,001
欢迎来到赖罗斯星，我的孩子！
Welcome to Rylos, my boy!

316
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:25,273
赖罗斯？
Rylos?

317
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:28,315
等等。你的意思是说…就像在游戏里一样？
Wait a minute. You mean... You mean like in a game?

318
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,351
哦，他反应很快嘛。很快，是很快
Oh, he's quick. He's quick. He's very quick.

319
00:27:30,352 --> 00:27:33,554
他瞠目结舌了！再见了，亚里克斯！尽兴哦！
He's speechless. So long, Alex! Have fun!

320
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:36,957
但愿古鲁七柱的好运永远伴你左右
May the luck of the Seven Pillars of Gulu be with you at all times.

321
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:40,561
哦，总有一天这些混蛋们会感谢森特利的。相信我吧
Oh, someday these cheapskates will thank Centauri. Trust me.

322
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,167
六月份的到哪儿去了？
Where the hell is June?

323
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:54,637
犹兰达，小甜心！
Yolanda, baby!

324
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:06,718
嗨，玛姬
Hi, Maggs.

325
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:09,088
嗨，路易斯
Hi, Louis.

326
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:11,125
他起床了吗？
Is he up?

327
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:15,154
他嘟哝了一个晚上，没睡过
Yeah. He's been up all night moaning.

328
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,333
亚里克斯？
Alex?

329
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:27,865
你妈妈告诉我贷款的事了
Your mother told me about the loan.

330
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:30,503
有什么我帮得上的吗？
Is there anything I can do?

331
00:28:37,152 --> 00:28:40,520
听着，如果你需要帮忙，我就在隔壁，好吧？
Listen. I'll be next door if you need anything, okay?

332
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:58,458
刚星群
Gunstars.

333
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:02,366
我一定是在做梦
I got to be dreaming.

334
00:30:07,242 --> 00:30:08,342
是啊，没错
Yeah, right.

335
00:30:16,184 --> 00:30:18,619
听着，这里有个大错
Listen, there's been a big mistake.

336
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,588
...immediately after situation report.

337
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:21,755
Navigation...

338
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:24,191
欢迎来到星空战士指挥部
Welcome to Starfighter Command.

339
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:25,326
你在说英语了？
You speak English?

340
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:28,128
不，你听到的是英语。这要多亏了你的翻译装置
No. You hear English, thanks to your translator device.

341
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:29,797
赶紧，我们时间不多了
Hurry up. We haven't got much time.

342
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:31,823
部署会议马上要开始了
The briefing begins immediately.

343
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:34,101
请和其他录取者一同前往
Join the other recruits.

344
00:30:34,102 --> 00:30:35,900
等等！等等！
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

345
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:38,105
等等！你说的录取者是什么意思？
Wait a minute! What are you talking about, recruits?

346
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:43,106
我简直不能相信！
I don't believe this.

347
00:30:46,248 --> 00:30:50,551
注意。请注意！恩德伦大使已经到达
Attention. Attention, please. Ambassador Enduran has arrived

348
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:53,851
并将立即开始部署星空战士指挥部的人事工作
and will now address Starfighter Command personnel.

349
00:30:56,791 --> 00:31:00,761
众所周知，我们绝望地探寻了很久…
As you all know, we have been on a desperate quest...

350
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:02,596
抱歉。抱歉
Excuse me. Excuse me.

351
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:03,797
…找到你们这些星空战士和领航员
...to find Starfighters and navigators.

352
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:11,229
我…我真应该把你捏得粉碎！
I should... I should crush you to gorun dust!

353
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:14,875
对不起，我是不小心的…
I'm sorry... It was an accident.

354
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,401
我不是要故意踩你的…
I didn't mean to step on your...

355
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:18,646
我也不知道叫它什么东西
Whatever that is.

356
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:19,813
可怕的生物
Hideous creature.

357
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:21,305
请允许我继续
If I may continue.

358
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,851
我们的军队已经…
Our forces have...

359
00:31:23,852 --> 00:31:25,419
你别惹伯嘉地
You don't trifle with a Bogati.

360
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,920
他们很好战
They love to fight.

361
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:29,117
所以我们很适合打这场战争
That's why they're perfect for this war.

362
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:32,192
你是不是说了“战争”？
Did you say "war"?

363
00:31:32,193 --> 00:31:33,294
没错！
But of course!

364
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:35,596
不然你认为你在这儿干什么？
Why else do you think you're here?

365
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:37,698
“你已被星空联盟录取，誓死保卫边境”
You were recruited by the Star League to defend...

366
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:41,465
“抗击约和柯-旦舰队的入侵”
"...to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada."

367
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:49,376
很久很久以前，我们的祖先建造了这伟大的边境
Eons ago, our ancestors created our great Frontier,

368
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:51,712
它对敌人来说是一道屏障
a barrier of energy

369
00:31:51,713 --> 00:31:54,876
维持着和平的宇宙体系
encircling the peaceful systems of the universe,

370
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:59,782
将潜在的灾祸拒于千里之外
and forever shutting out the scourge that lurks beyond.

371
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:06,660
大伙，由于无耻的背叛…
Fellow Rylans, because of a dark betrayal,

372
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:08,696
我们的边境即将瓦解
our Frontier will soon collapse.

373
00:32:11,332 --> 00:32:16,537
所以，我们向你们――星空战士以及你们的领航员们――求助…
So we turn to you, Starfighters and your navigators.

374
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:20,240
代表着星际联盟几十亿的生命
For of all the billions of creatures in the Star League,

375
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:23,734
只有你们几个才被证明有那…
only you few were found to possess the

376
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,007
天赋
gift.

377
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,719
你，还有你…
You, and you alone,

378
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,451
正站在我们与黑暗势力的中间
stand between us and the black terror of the Ko-Dan.

379
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,454
胜利还是灭亡！
Victory or death!

380
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:41,361
胜利还是灭亡！
Victory or death!

381
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:44,465
胜利还是灭亡！胜利还是灭亡！
Victory or death! Victory or death!

382
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:47,368
胜利还是灭亡！胜利还是灭亡！
Victory or death! Victory or death!

383
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:50,270
胜利还是灭亡！胜利还是灭亡！
Victory or death! Victory or death!

384
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:53,006
胜利还是灭亡！胜利还是灭亡！
Victory or death! Victory or death!

385
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:55,876
胜利还是灭亡！胜利还是灭亡！
Victory or death! Victory or death!

386
00:32:55,877 --> 00:32:58,879
胜利还是灭亡！胜利还是灭亡！
Victory or death! Victory or death!

387
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,043
胜利还是灭亡！胜利还是灭亡！
Victory or death! Victory or death!

388
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:05,652
现在，星空战士们，在你们的座位底下…
Now, Starfighters, if you will reach underneath your seats,

389
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:09,112
你们会发现一个装有一只手的包…
you will find a packet which contains one hand...

390
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:15,964
这里是限制区域，对你们…
This is a restricted area, off-limits to...

391
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,835
真对不起，星空战士
My apologies, Starfighter.

392
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:25,272
星际导航员兼一等兵听从您指挥，长官！
Star Navigator First Class Grig at your service, sir!

393
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:31,278
嗨，我是亚里克斯 罗根，我在家里玩这个游戏…
Hi. I'm Alex Rogan. I was playing this game back home,

394
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,479
后来有个人找到我…
and this guy came up to me.

395
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,415
其实他不是个人，他是外星人，对吧？
Only he's not a guy. He's an alien, right?

396
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:37,217
然后我坐上他的车――只不过那不是辆车――而是艘宇宙飞船
And I get into his car. Only it's not a car. It's a spaceship.

397
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:40,721
这里面有个大错误
And, there's been a big mistake.

398
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:42,689
我是不是要这样理解…
Am I to understand you're actually declining

399
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,058
你拒绝做一名光荣的星空战士？
the honor of becoming a Starfighter?

400
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,460
没错
You got it.

401
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:47,826
太不可思议了！
Extraordinary!

402
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,596
长久以来，所有的生物都梦想成为星空战士
For eons, all creatures have dreamt of being Starfighters.

403
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:55,169
-你从哪儿来？ -地球
Where you from? Earth.

404
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:58,439
我们其实和谁都没在打仗，只是互相在打
And we're not at war with anybody, except each other.

405
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,209
地球？地球可不是星际联盟的正式成员啊…
Earth? Earth isn't a formal member of the Star League,

406
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,578
而且只有等到它成熟以后我们才可以接近
and isn't due to be approached until it matures.

407
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:07,514
这太没规矩了
This is all highly irregular.

408
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:09,917
告诉我，是谁征用你的？
Tell me. Who recruited you?

409
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,146
森特利
Centauri.

410
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:13,020
他来了。就是他！
There he is. That's him!

411
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:15,456
森特利。我也许认识他
Centauri. I might have known.

412
00:34:20,094 --> 00:34:23,826
又在故伎重演了，对吧，森特利？
Up to your old Excalibur tricks again, eh, Centauri?

413
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:25,933
你就不知道…
Did it ever occur to you that it is against the law

414
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:29,236
从星际联盟以外的地方征兵是非法的？
to recruit from worlds outside the Star League?

415
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:31,330
地球也受到了威胁，不是吗？
Earth's in danger, too, isn't it?

416
00:34:31,473 --> 00:34:33,640
不，我可没有动用神剑测试哦
And, no, I did not use the Excalibur test.

417
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:35,342
只用了一个叫作“电子游戏”的东西
It was called a video game.

418
00:34:35,343 --> 00:34:36,977
那又有什么关系呢？
What's all the brouhaha?

419
00:34:36,978 --> 00:34:39,847
总之，他没有那种天赋
After all, he does have the gift!

420
00:34:39,848 --> 00:34:42,316
这也许会让你很吃惊…
This may come as a bit of a shock to you,

421
00:34:42,317 --> 00:34:44,649
但是，他并不想成为星空战士
but he doesn't want to be a Starfighter.

422
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:48,589
不想成为一个…你是个懦夫吗？
Doesn't want to be a... Are you a coward?

423
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,656
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

424
00:34:49,657 --> 00:34:51,250
你什么都没告诉过我！
You didn't tell me about any of this!

425
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,027
还钱吧，森特利！
Return the money, Centauri!

426
00:34:54,028 --> 00:34:57,364
还钱？你老糊涂了吗？
Return the money? Are you delirious?

427
00:34:57,365 --> 00:34:59,433
你知道我花了多久发明那游戏…
Do you know how long it took to invent the games,

428
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:00,634
进行推广…
to merchandise them,

429
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:03,434
在圣诞节前放在店里销售？
to get them into the stores by Christmas?

430
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:06,039
这对于你来说一定不容易…
It must be terribly embarrassing for you,

431
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,041
我真的很同情，可是…
and I do sympathize. However...

432
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:09,610
但是我看到他战斗了！
But I saw him fight!

433
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:11,445
他可以成为有史以来最棒的星空战士！
He could be the greatest Starfighter ever!

434
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:13,280
那只是个游戏啊，森特利
That was a game, Centauri.

435
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:14,414
游戏？
A game?

436
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:18,619
你以为它只是个游戏，但它也是种考验
You may have thought it was a game, but it was also a test.

437
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,387
啊哈！一种考验！
Aha! A test!

438
00:35:20,388 --> 00:35:24,958
它被发向宇宙，寻找那些具有天赋的人成为星空战士
Sent out across the universe to find those with the gift to be Starfighters.

439
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:27,961
所以你就在这儿了，我的孩子！
And here you are, my boy. Here you are!

440
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:29,730
没错，我是在这儿了。等着被杀！
Right! Here I am, about to be killed!

441
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:30,831
被杀…
Killed.

442
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,903
你该不会以为它很危险吧？
You don't seriously think it's dangerous, do you?

443
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:38,338
别傻了，相信我吧！
Don't be silly! Trust me!

444
00:35:56,591 --> 00:35:57,717
祖尔！
Xur!

445
00:35:58,526 --> 00:35:59,550
祖尔！
Xur!

446
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:02,057
祖尔？
Xur?

447
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:08,694
是的，父亲，你那强大的边境现在正在削弱
Yes, Father, your mighty Frontier grows weaker by the moment.

448
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:12,740
别叫我父亲！
Do not call me father!

449
00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:15,943
我没有你这个儿子！
You are no longer my son!

450
00:36:15,944 --> 00:36:19,243
你已经被我遗弃，为什么还回来？
You're an outcast! Why have you returned?

451
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,683
为了所有赖仑星人好，我回来了
I have returned for the good of all Rylans.

452
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:26,153
带着柯-旦战舰回来？
With an armada of Ko-Dan warships behind you?

453
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:29,790
有些赖仑星人会欢迎我的，父亲
There are some Rylans who would welcome me, Father.

454
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:33,694
星球联盟的正义容不得你这邪教！
Star League justice put down your Xurian cult.

455
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:36,129
你的追随者既少又分散
Your followers are few and scattered.

456
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,332
星际联盟？
Star League?

457
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:41,902
只不过是个弱小世界的避难所，根本无法与我们匹敌！
A refuge for weak worlds not worthy to be our equals!

458
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:44,438
那也是由赖仑星人来作决定
That is for the Rylans to decide,

459
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:48,398
而不是由像你自己一样的一个既危险又邪恶的孩子来决定！
and not for a dangerous and evil child such as yourself.

460
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:54,878
然而，也就是这个孩子，捕获了你的主要间谍
And yet, it is this child who caught your master spy.

461
00:37:24,445 --> 00:37:26,106
听我的吧，赖仑星人！
Hear me, Rylans!

462
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:33,250
当戈兰星的绿月黯然失色的时候，柯-旦的军队将会入侵
When the green moon of Galan is eclipsed, Ko-Dan Armada will invade,

463
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:39,693
就算你们强大的星空战士也救不了你们
and not even your mighty Starfighters will be able to save you.

464
00:37:39,694 --> 00:37:43,130
我们走着瞧，祖尔。我们走着瞧！
We shall see, Xur. We shall see!

465
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:57,744
你仍然想走吗？
You still want to go?

466
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:59,304
想错过这里的精彩？
And miss all the excitement?

467
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:06,453
小屁孩儿
Little brat.

468
00:38:06,454 --> 00:38:08,855
我发明了游戏，找到了那个孩子，带他过去…
I invent the game, find the kid, drag him up there,

469
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:11,358
他竟然不想成为星空战士
and he doesn't want to be a Starfighter.

470
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,792
我也算放弃了！
I give up!

471
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:53,359
Control, do you copy our star angle difference from parking angle?

472
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:59,132
Delta beta two at six, delta gamma three at five.

473
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:07,704
祖尔王命令我把他的权杖拿来
Emperor Xur ordered me to bring his scepter.

474
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:11,451
让他进来
Let him enter.

475
00:39:11,452 --> 00:39:13,921
目标位置仍可见
Target vector remains on scope.

476
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:32,139
就像你们柯-旦王的一样，对吧，克里尔指挥长？
Just like your Ko-Dan emperor's, isn't it, Commander Kril?

477
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:38,375
想要统治，单单靠权杖是办不到的，祖尔
It takes more than a scepter to rule, Xur, even on Rylos.

478
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:42,810
你说得没错，克里尔
You're right, Kril.

479
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:47,144
单靠权杖的确办不到
It does take more than a scepter.

480
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,399
我们忍这个蠢货要忍多久？
How long must we endure this fool?

481
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:02,302
边境出现情况
We have a break in the Frontier.

482
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:04,067
发射流星弹！
Fire the meteor gun!

483
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:09,910
我亲爱的柯-旦朋友！惟恐我们忘记…
My dear Ko-Dan friends! Lest we forget,

484
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:13,847
是你们的王委任我担任本军的指挥
it was your own emperor who granted me command of this Armada.

485
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:16,749
因为只有我才知道通往边境的路
For only I hold the secret to the Frontier.

486
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:20,253
也只有我才知道星空战士基地
Only I know the location of the Starfighter base.

487
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:23,952
因此，只有我才有权命令开火！
And therefore, only I will give the order to fire!

488
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,094
请原谅我，祖尔
Forgive me, Xur.

489
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:39,005
我原谅你，克里尔指挥长
You are forgiven, Commander Kril.

490
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:46,035
流星弹…发射！
Meteor gunner...fire.

491
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,377
中士！
Sergeant!

492
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:26,549
三十一区有不明飞行物侵入，长官
I have an unidentified incoming object in Sector 31 , sir.

493
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:33,493
它们的目标是基地！警戒状态！
They're headed for the base! Alert!

494
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:34,761
我们受到攻击！
We are under attack!

495
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:37,129
重复一遍，我们受到攻击！
I repeat, we are under attack!

496
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,668
开启自动排斥枪！
Activate automatic repulser guns.

497
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:37,884
警戒状态！警戒状态！
Condition Red! Condition Red!

498
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:48,834
终于成功了！
At last, it is done!

499
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,634
不久，边境将瓦解…
Soon the Frontier will be down

500
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:55,037
他们也将向他们的新帝王俯首称臣！
and they will bow to their new emperor!

501
00:42:56,043 --> 00:42:57,744
否则，我就用他们的灰烬抹灰天空！
Or I will darken the sky with their ashes.

502
00:42:57,745 --> 00:42:59,713
指挥长，祖尔的间谍报告说…
Commander, the Xurian spy reports

503
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:01,648
有一个星空战士逃跑了
that one Starfighter has escaped.

504
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,915
逃跑？
Escaped?

505
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:18,164
你确定不需要我帮忙？
You sure I can't give you a hand?

506
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:20,300
你已经帮得够多的了。谢谢
You've done quite enough already. Thank you.

507
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:21,461
那…
Well...

508
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,271
反正也就几公里远了，我想……
It's only a few more miles from here. I guess...

509
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,340
我想我就走回去吧
I guess I can walk it.

510
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:30,538
后会有期！再见，森特利！
So long! Bye, Centauri!

511
00:43:42,757 --> 00:43:44,520
哦，亚里克斯！
Oh, Alex!

512
00:43:46,494 --> 00:43:47,586
给你！
Here!

513
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:54,167
嘿，听着。我不能拿你的礼物，森特利
Hey, listen. I can't take a present from you, Centauri.

514
00:43:55,403 --> 00:43:56,770
他把我变得倾家荡产…
He reduces me to poverty again

515
00:43:56,771 --> 00:43:58,438
他还认为我是给他礼物！
and he thinks I'm giving him a present.

516
00:43:58,439 --> 00:43:59,668
什么世道啊？
What a world this is.

517
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,141
那它是什么？
What is it, then?

518
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:03,143
那是另一次机会，我的孩子！
It's a second chance, my boy!

519
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:06,511
如果你改变了主意，按下通讯按钮就可以了
If you change your mind, just tap the communo-crystals.

520
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:13,620
-你留着它吧 -亚里克斯，亚里克斯！
Keep it. Alex, Alex!

521
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:16,623
你正在背离历史。历史！
You're walking away from history. History!

522
00:44:16,624 --> 00:44:20,193
哥伦布说过他想呆在家里吗？没有！
Did Chris Columbus say he wanted to stay home? No!

523
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:22,896
要是赖特兄弟认为只有鸟儿才会飞翔会怎么样呢？
What if the Wright Brothers thought that only birds should fly?

524
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:26,766
吉罗卡有没有认为尤鲁士人丑得无药可救呢？
And did Geloca think the Yulus were too ugly to save?

525
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,235
谁是吉罗卡？
Who's Geloca?

526
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:31,469
不管了
Never mind.

527
00:44:33,107 --> 00:44:34,474
听着，森特利。我不是他们中的任何一个
Listen, Centauri. I'm not any of those guys.

528
00:44:34,475 --> 00:44:36,042
我只是一个来自拖车场的孩子
I'm a kid from a trailer park.

529
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:39,673
如果你真是那样想的话，那你也就这样了！
If that's what you think, then that's all you'll ever be!

530
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:11,844
嘿，玛姬！
Hey, Maggie!

531
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:15,582
快听听，你绝不会相信的
Listen to this. You're not going to believe this.

532
00:45:16,484 --> 00:45:17,650
我说过了，亚里克斯
I told you, Alex.

533
00:45:17,651 --> 00:45:18,785
我和我的…你是怎么说的来着？
Me and my... How did you put it?

534
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:22,222
“奇怪的性冲动”再也不会和你说话了！
"Strange sexual urges," aren't talking to you anymore.

535
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:04,197
谁？
Who's there!

536
00:46:04,198 --> 00:46:06,496
嘘！你会把路易斯吵醒的
Shh! You're gonna wake up Louis.

537
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:17,174
嘿！你看上去就和我一样！
Hey, you look like me!

538
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:19,143
当然，我是你的替身
Of course I do. I'm the beta unit.

539
00:46:20,181 --> 00:46:22,376
替身是什么玩意儿？
What the hell's a beta unit?

540
00:46:22,683 --> 00:46:28,747
替身是一个模拟体，一个你的完全的复制体，只是嗓门没那么大
A beta unit is a simuloid, an exact duplicate of you, only not as loud.

541
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:31,357
啊？
Huh?

542
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:32,692
我就在汽车里，不记得了？
I was in the starcar, remember?

543
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:34,027
我们握过手？
We shook hands?

544
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:36,428
很不幸的是，我成了你
I became you, unfortunately.

545
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:40,530
说白了，你就是个机器人？
Let me get this straight. You're a robot?

546
00:46:40,768 --> 00:46:42,793
你说什么？
I beg your pardon.

547
00:46:43,504 --> 00:46:47,307
我是一个既有艺术性，又是行业内顶尖级的替身……
I'm a state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line beta unit,

548
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:51,044
被放到这儿，当你不在的时候顶替你
put here as a courtesy replacement for while you're away.

549
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:52,912
我还真幸运啊
Lucky me.

550
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:54,847
等等，你怎么回来了？
Wait a minute. What are you doing back?

551
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:56,616
你开什么玩笑？那里在打仗！
Are you kidding? It's war up there!

552
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:59,678
哦，拯救鲸鱼却不拯救整个宇宙，啊？
Oh. Save the whales and not the universe, huh?

553
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:02,355
那你为什么不去打仗？
Well, why don't you go up there and fight?

554
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:04,958
模拟体不能打仗。这是不允许的
Simuloids can't fight. We're not allowed.

555
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,359
那告诉他们你就是我。假装嘛！
Well, tell them that you're me! Pretend!

556
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:09,996
安静点，亚里克斯
Be quiet, Alex.

557
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:11,658
对不起，路易斯
Sorry, Louis.

558
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:14,133
谢谢你的礼物！
Thanks for the lift!

559
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:15,534
别客气，伙计。再见！
Sure thing, buddy. See you around!

560
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:40,093
你好，星空战士！
Greetings, Starfighter.

561
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:42,528
你已被星空联盟录取
You have been recruited by the Star League

562
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,828
誓死保卫边境…
to defend the Frontier against Yur and...

563
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:07,220
那…嘿！你对玛姬做了什么？
And, hey, what did you do to Maggie?

564
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,721
对她？
Do to her?

565
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:10,223
我们坐在外面，看着星空…
We're sitting outside, looking at the stars,

566
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,249
她把舌头伸到我耳朵里来
and she sticks her tongue in my ear.

567
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:15,862
我尖叫起来。我明天道歉总好了吧？
I screamed. I'll apologize tomorrow, okay?

568
00:48:15,863 --> 00:48:17,363
你不该在这儿的！
You're not gonna be here.

569
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:19,094
你现在就得和森特利一起回去！
You're going back with Centauri right now!

570
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,600
怎么了，亚里克斯？
What's up, Alex?

571
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:23,696
回去睡觉，路易斯。不然我就告诉妈妈你和你那些《花花公子》的事
Back to sleep, Louis, or I'm telling Ma about your Playboys.

572
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,268
你把事情搞砸了，亚里克斯！
You're blowing it, Alex!

573
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:34,213
怎么回事！
What the shit?

574
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:37,446
我说了快回去睡觉，路易斯。不然我就告诉妈妈你和你那些《花花公子》的事
I said, back to sleep, Louis, or I'm telling Ma about your Playboys!

575
00:48:39,553 --> 00:48:41,248
拜托，森特利
Come in, Centauri.

576
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:43,323
拜托，快回来
Come on. Get back here.

577
00:48:43,324 --> 00:48:45,087
把你的仿真玩具带走
And take your Tonka toy with you.

578
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:47,794
你好，星空战士！
Greetings, Starfighter.

579
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:51,164
你已被星空联盟录取，誓死保卫边境
You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier

580
00:48:51,165 --> 00:48:53,895
抗击约和柯-旦舰队的入侵
against Yur and the Ko-Dan Armada.

581
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:56,569
你好，星空战士！
Greetings, Starfighter.

582
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,037
你已被星空联盟录取…
You have been recruited by the Star League

583
00:48:58,038 --> 00:49:00,439
誓死保卫边境…
to defend the Frontier against Yur...

584
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:07,814
你在哪儿？出来啊？你在哪儿？
Where are you? Come on, where are you?

585
00:49:07,815 --> 00:49:09,146
森特利？
Centauri?

586
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,017
你好，星空战士！
Greetings, Starfighter!

587
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,517
森特利？
Centauri?

588
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,184
哦，不好！
Oh, shit!

589
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:20,019
来啊，亚里克斯，别那么懦弱！
Come on, Alex. Don't be such a wimp!

590
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:38,938
森特利，当心！
Centauri, look out!

591
00:50:38,939 --> 00:50:40,100
怎么回事…
What the...

592
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:08,025
Phew!

593
00:51:08,202 --> 00:51:11,000
肮脏、恶臭的生物
Foul stench. Dirty creatures.

594
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:17,276
好好看看，亚里克斯
Get a good look, Alex.

595
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:20,513
我敢打赌你以后会看见更多
You can bet your asteroids you'll be seeing more of them.

596
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:21,781
什么？
What?

597
00:51:21,782 --> 00:51:23,215
这是赞多-赞
This is a Zando-Zan.

598
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:26,576
一种星际怪物，祖尔的走狗
An interstellar hitbeast, compliments of Xur.

599
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:29,789
祖尔？他为什么要跟踪我？
Xur? Why is he after me?

600
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,124
不知为什么，他发现你是一个星空战士
Somehow he found out you're a Starfighter.

601
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:35,828
所以，你看，亚里克斯，你得回去。你别无选择
So you see, Alex, you got to go back. You got no choice.

602
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:37,797
你要是呆在这里的话，你就变成它们的事物了
'Cause if you stay down here, you're dog food.

603
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:39,532
相信森特利，我的孩子
Trust Centauri, my boy.

604
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:43,803
因为两小时以后，这个地方将爬满十只赞多-赞s…
Because in two hours, this place will be crawling with 10 Zando-Zans

605
00:51:43,804 --> 00:51:47,807
它们那木鱼脑子里只有一个目的…
with just one thought on their microscopic little minds,

606
00:51:47,808 --> 00:51:49,475
杀死亚里克斯罗根
kill Alex Rogan.

607
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:51,110
杀死亚里克斯罗根
Kill Alex Rogan.

608
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:52,612
他说得没错，亚里克斯
He's right, Alex.

609
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:55,348
至少在那里你还有机会在刚星里面战斗
At least up there you'll have a fighting chance in a Gunstar.

610
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:56,516
没错
Exactly.

611
00:51:56,517 --> 00:51:59,585
同时，在这儿，他们会追杀替身
Meanwhile, down here, they'll be going after Beta.

612
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:01,187
-替身 -替身？
Beta. Beta?

613
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:03,189
当然。不然你以为他是干什么来的？
Of course. What do you think he's here for?

614
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,058
等…等等，森特利
Wait a... Wait a second here, Centauri.

615
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:07,360
亚里克斯，当心！
Alex, look out!

616
00:52:15,202 --> 00:52:16,601
森特利！
Centauri!

617
00:52:17,905 --> 00:52:19,038
替身，去叫医生！
Beta, get a doctor!

618
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,474
不，这里看不好的，因为没有巫医
No. No native cures. No witch doctors.

619
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:24,207
我没事，只是擦伤
I'm fine. Just a scratch.

620
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,639
面对现实吧，亚里克斯。你天生就是个星空战士
Now face it, Alex. You're a born Starfighter.

621
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:34,846
跟我去吗？
Are you with me?

622
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,522
好吧，我们走，森特利
Okay, let's go, Centauri.

623
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:50,428
祝你好运，亚里克斯
Good luck, Alex.

624
00:52:53,473 --> 00:52:55,271
你也是，亚里克斯
You, too, Alex.

625
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:20,797
森特利呼叫星空战士指挥部
Centauri to Starfighter Command.

626
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:23,302
森特利呼叫星空战士指挥部
Centauri to Starfighter Command.

627
00:53:23,303 --> 00:53:24,862
请回答
Come in, please.

628
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:43,179
嘿，森特利
Hey, Centauri.

629
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:48,127
所有人员注意
Attention all personnel.

630
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:50,290
星际汽车正在接近十二号停靠点
Starcar is approaching Docking Bay 12.

631
00:53:51,698 --> 00:53:53,997
森特利！森特利！
Centauri! Centauri!

632
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,937
嘿！快踩刹车！
Hey, hit the brakes!

633
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:08,648
-格里格！嘿，格里格！ -亚里克斯！
Grig! Hey, Grig! Alex!

634
00:54:08,649 --> 00:54:10,650
他们击中了森特利。他受伤了
They got Centauri. He's hurt!

635
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:12,312
他在这儿
He's right over here.

636
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:26,090
啊？你看到了？
Ah, you see?

637
00:54:27,534 --> 00:54:29,101
森特利带他回来了！
Centauri brought him back!

638
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:30,934
-是的，我看见了 -别说话
Yes, I see. Don't talk.

639
00:54:31,805 --> 00:54:33,839
他把我的钱拿回去了吗，亚里克斯？
Does he have my money, Alex?

640
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,469
我有一大笔钱给你，森特利
I have a fortune for you, Centauri.

641
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:38,411
你现在要坚持住
Now, please be still.

642
00:54:39,813 --> 00:54:42,942
钱在这儿，全在这儿。一叠一叠的钱
It's here. It's all here. Piles and piles of it.

643
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:45,484
都是你的
All for you.

644
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,787
啊…
Ah...

645
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:50,152
终于
At last.

646
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:58,122
亚里克斯，我要你知道，能把你带回来是最幸运的事
Alex, I want you know, it was for the greatest good I brought you back.

647
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:04,102
当然，想…
Of course, it...

648
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:07,070
想要有钱也要付出点代价
It never hurts to be rich.

649
00:55:17,017 --> 00:55:21,079
一路走好，老朋友
Until the next dimension, old friend.

650
00:55:23,623 --> 00:55:25,319
很遗憾，亚里克斯
I'm sorry, Alex.

651
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:27,323
森特利？
Centauri?

652
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:34,364
森特利？
Centauri?

653
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:38,936
边境任何时候都有可能瓦解
The Frontier could collapse at any moment.

654
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:41,173
亚里克斯！
Alex!

655
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:41,428
现在我的耳朵需要次手术。几乎听不到声音了
Now I need an earjob. Dying here. Dying.

656
00:56:56,383 --> 00:57:00,119
亚里克斯，究竟发生了什么？
Alex, what the hell's going on?

657
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,317
路易斯，你正在做恶梦
Louis, you're having a terrible nightmare.

658
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:05,250
快回去睡觉
Go back to sleep.

659
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,295
路易斯！
Louis!

660
00:57:24,978 --> 00:57:26,468
哦，不
Oh, no.

661
00:57:36,656 --> 00:57:40,226
据我所知，你家里有个替身在顶替你？
Am I to understand there's a beta unit taking your place back home?

662
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:41,327
他在努力尝试
He's trying.

663
00:57:41,328 --> 00:57:44,496
所以我们完全可以推断，祖尔认为你还在地球上
So it's safe to assume that Xur thinks you're still on Earth.

664
00:57:44,497 --> 00:57:46,365
是啊
Yeah.

665
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:49,097
那我们在理论上可以算是有优势了
That could work to our advantage, theoretically.

666
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:58,476
啊！你现在看上去像个人了！
Ah! Now you look human!

667
00:58:01,014 --> 00:58:02,514
这就是我的刚星？
Is this my Gunstar?

668
00:58:02,515 --> 00:58:05,050
这只是个样品，和其他飞船有点区别
This is a prototype, different from the other ships.

669
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:06,919
她有更远的射程，更大的威力…
She has a greater range, more power,

670
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,048
同时，也作了轻微的装备改良
and a slight weapons modification.

671
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:12,024
当然，她还有防护层
And, of course, she's got deflective plating,

672
00:58:12,025 --> 00:58:14,460
所以她经得起几次直接攻击
so she can withstand several direct hits.

673
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:22,101
我就是从这里，为飞船导航
From here, this is where I navigate the ship,

674
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:25,094
维护维生系统和推进系统
maintain life support and propulsion systems.

675
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:27,840
那我坐在哪儿？
Okay. Where do I sit?

676
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:30,367
在那边，发射席上
Way up there, in the gunnery chair.

677
00:58:33,613 --> 00:58:34,913
站稳了！
Hang on!

678
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:35,938
好的
Okay.

679
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:43,952
现在，爬到发射席上
Now, climb into the gunnery chair.

680
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:48,855
我将你设置为发射状态
Now, I'm moving you into launch position.

681
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:52,264
在你前面有两个开关…
There in front of you are the two switches

682
00:58:52,265 --> 00:58:54,563
可以打开显示器。现在打开它们
for your heads-up display. Turn them on.

683
00:58:59,072 --> 00:59:00,339
当你和敌人交战时…
While you're engaging the enemy,

684
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,969
显示器会向你显示所有接近你的战舰
the screen will reflect all battle instruments towards you.

685
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:06,979
嘿，它哪儿去了？
Hey, where did it go?

686
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,648
它还在那儿，飘浮在氖气雾霭中
It's still there, suspended in a xenon mist.

687
00:59:09,649 --> 00:59:11,650
你只要以正确的角度看就能看到
But it's only visible if you look dead ahead.

688
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:13,620
哦，看到了
Ah. Got it.

689
00:59:13,787 --> 00:59:15,821
你左面的操纵杆是操纵你的座椅的
The lever on your left is the chair controller.

690
00:59:15,822 --> 00:59:19,122
你可以看到，所有的枪都跟着你一起移动
As you can see, all guns will track with your every move.

691
00:59:26,866 --> 00:59:30,069
右手抓紧瞄准器
Grasp the target control with your right hand.

692
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:33,706
你的手指可以操纵所有机枪――激光枪、霹雳弹…
At your fingers is the weaponry, the lasers, photon bolts...

693
00:59:33,707 --> 00:59:34,940
还有粒子射线
Photon bolts and the particle beams.

694
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:36,602
等等，这和我在家玩的一样啊
Wait a minute. This is just like back home.

695
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,677
-这是什么？ -当心，当心…
What's this? Careful, careful,

696
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:42,047
那是死亡霸王花，最后关头才能用
that's Death Blossom, a weapon of last resort.

697
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:45,284
幸运的是，我不小心触动它的时候飞机库正在上升
Luckily, I was in here working on it when the hangar went up.

698
00:59:45,285 --> 00:59:48,345
准备好了吗？所有系统，开启！
Now, are you ready? All systems, go!

699
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:51,754
点火！
Ignition!

700
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:57,663
飞机库什么时候上升？
When did the hangar go up?

701
00:59:57,664 --> 01:00:00,599
我说过了，当祖尔袭击我们的时候！
I told you, when Xur attacked.

702
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:02,034
那星空战士都在哪儿？
And where were the Starfighters?

703
01:00:02,035 --> 01:00:03,235
在飞机库里！
In the hangar!

704
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:05,004
你是说他们都死了？
You mean they're dead?

705
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:07,064
死是个消极的概念
Death is a primitive concept.

706
01:00:08,074 --> 01:00:12,945
我宁可认为他们在另一空间与邪恶而战
I prefer to think of them as battling evil in another dimension.

707
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:15,714
在另一空间？有多少人离开了？
In another dimension? How many are left?

708
01:00:15,715 --> 01:00:16,944
包括你自己？
Including yourself?

709
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,646
对
Yeah.

710
01:00:19,919 --> 01:00:21,182
一个！
One!

711
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:23,313
一个？
One?

712
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:35,898
等等！
Hold it.

713
01:00:38,738 --> 01:00:41,607
我们没有舰队，没有星空战士，连个计划也没有？
There's no fleet, no Starfighters, no plan?

714
01:00:41,608 --> 01:00:44,042
-一艘飞船，你，我，没了？ -完全正确！
One ship, you, me, and that's it? Exactly!

715
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:45,244
祖尔认为你还在地球上
Xur thinks you're still on Earth.

716
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:47,446
经典战略：突袭
Classic military strategy. Surprise attack.

717
01:00:47,447 --> 01:00:48,714
那简直是送死！
It'll be a slaughter!

718
01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:50,182
要的就是这种精神！
That's the spirit.

719
01:00:50,183 --> 01:00:51,683
不，是我去送死！
No, my slaughter.

720
01:00:51,684 --> 01:00:53,685
一艘飞船对抗整个部队？
One ship against the whole Armada?

721
01:00:53,686 --> 01:00:57,122
对。一架刚星对抗整个部队！
Yes. One Gunstar against the Armada.

722
01:00:57,123 --> 01:01:01,959
我总是想和不可思议的敌人来一场破釜沉舟的战斗！
I've always wanted to fight a desperate battle against incredible odds.

723
01:01:04,697 --> 01:01:05,998
搜索目标，亚里克斯
Target lights, Alex.

724
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,199
搜索目标？
Target lights?

725
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,001
没错。你总得在还有机会的时候…
Yes. You might want to squeeze off

726
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,736
多打它几个回合吧？
a few rounds while you have the chance.

727
01:01:10,737 --> 01:01:12,838
发挥飞船的最大攻击力
Just work the bugs out of the system.

728
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:14,967
毕竟，这是她的处女航
After all, it is her maiden voyage.

729
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:38,664
稳住，别和座椅过不去
Steady. Don't fight the chair.

730
01:01:38,665 --> 01:01:40,599
慢慢来。用枪瞄准
Take your time. Watch your gun sights.

731
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,501
看好目标
Lead your targets.

732
01:01:42,502 --> 01:01:44,834
总之，放松就是了！
And above all, relax!

733
01:01:45,405 --> 01:01:48,640
真好，我就要被杀得片甲不留…
Terrific. I'm about to get killed a million miles from nowhere

734
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:51,611
竟然还有一个蜥蜴人叫我“放松”！
with a gung-ho iguana who tells me, "Relax."

735
01:01:54,781 --> 01:01:56,271
星空战士！
Interstellar!

736
01:02:29,115 --> 01:02:30,310
亚里克斯！
Alex!

737
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:32,246
对不起
Sorry.

738
01:02:34,854 --> 01:02:37,721
好的，来，慢慢举起来
Okay, now, come on. Ease it up.

739
01:02:39,626 --> 01:02:40,820
好的
Okay.

740
01:02:42,595 --> 01:02:45,224
哦，行…行了！简单
Oh, that's... That's it. Easy.

741
01:02:45,765 --> 01:02:47,563
漂亮又简单
Nice and easy. Yep.

742
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:51,703
再过来点就能装好了
A little bit more and we'll get it in there, now.

743
01:02:52,839 --> 01:02:53,999
亚里克斯！
Alex!

744
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:58,744
对不起。嗨，玛姬
Sorry. Hi, Maggs.

745
01:02:58,745 --> 01:03:00,012
亚里克斯，你没事吧？
Alex, are you all right?

746
01:03:00,013 --> 01:03:02,277
是啊，是啊。我…没事
Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

747
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:06,252
快点，再来一次
Come on. Try it again.

748
01:03:07,787 --> 01:03:09,653
你闻到什么了吗？
Did you smell anything?

749
01:03:11,324 --> 01:03:12,382
什么？
Like what?

750
01:03:12,525 --> 01:03:13,617
就像…
Like a Z...

751
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:16,059
算了
Forget it.

752
01:03:24,037 --> 01:03:27,769
我只是想为昨天晚上给你的巴掌道歉
I just wanted to say I'm sorry for slapping you last night.

753
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:31,877
哦，没关系，玛姬。我活该
Oh, that's okay, Maggs. I deserved it.

754
01:03:31,878 --> 01:03:33,607
抱歉
I'm sorry.

755
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:37,943
要不…我们今晚去银湖弥补一下？
Well, maybe we can make it up to each other tonight at Silver Lake?

756
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,715
敌军将会从这里进入边境
The Armada will break through the Frontier here,

757
01:04:09,716 --> 01:04:12,217
二十公里后到达赖罗斯
and reach Rylos in 20 klicks.

758
01:04:12,218 --> 01:04:15,053
甲板上的空中部队将跟随母舰
Squadrons of deck fighters will precede the mother ship.

759
01:04:15,054 --> 01:04:16,955
空中部队？有多少空中部队？
Squadrons? How many squadrons?

760
01:04:16,956 --> 01:04:19,257
数量我倒不在乎
It isn't the number of squadrons that concerns me.

761
01:04:19,258 --> 01:04:21,193
这座通信塔将指令…
It's this communication turret that sends out

762
01:04:21,194 --> 01:04:22,794
发送给空中部队
the commands to the deck fighters,

763
01:04:22,795 --> 01:04:25,097
这样，他们就能同时作战
which enables them to act as one during the fight.

764
01:04:25,098 --> 01:04:27,866
等等，我们摧毁塔台以破坏空中部队
Wait a second. We knock out the turret to get the fighters.

765
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:30,469
但是要摧毁塔台，我们就要穿过空中部队？
But to get the turret, we have to get through the fighters.

766
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:31,903
那我们就死了
We're dead.

767
01:04:31,904 --> 01:04:34,840
在到达边境前我会想出办法的
I'll have it all figured out by the time we reach the Frontier.

768
01:04:37,877 --> 01:04:39,111
怎么了？
What's that?

769
01:04:39,112 --> 01:04:40,170
是边境
The Frontier.

770
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:51,623
真是奇怪，运输舰…
Now, that's strange. What's a cargo ship

771
01:04:51,624 --> 01:04:53,422
在边境附近干什么？
doing this close to the Frontier?

772
01:04:54,327 --> 01:04:57,023
你好，这里是刚星一号
Hail. This is Gunstar One.

773
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:03,635
重复，这里是刚星一号
I repeat, this is Gunstar One.

774
01:05:03,636 --> 01:05:05,798
请确认身份
Identify yourself, please.

775
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,599
亚里克斯，当心！
Alex, look out.

776
01:05:12,745 --> 01:05:14,213
是祖尔的飞船！
A Xurian ship!

777
01:05:16,883 --> 01:05:18,116
恭喜你，亚里克斯
Congratulations, Alex.

778
01:05:18,117 --> 01:05:20,814
这是你第一个活体目标
This is your first live target.

779
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,215
活体？
Live?

780
01:05:25,925 --> 01:05:28,724
五公里后进入射程。准备！
Within range in five klicks. Get ready!

781
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:35,267
我拦截了他的信号
I've blocked its beam of frequency,

782
01:05:35,268 --> 01:05:37,236
所以他没办法向总部报告
so it can't report back to the Armada.

783
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:40,501
-准备好了就开火！ -格里格，等等！
Fire when ready! Grig, wait!

784
01:05:50,383 --> 01:05:53,148
我们不能在洞穴里跟丢了，亚里克斯！开火！
We mustn't lose them in these caves, Alex! Fire!

785
01:06:16,442 --> 01:06:17,876
开火，亚里克斯！
Shoot, Alex!

786
01:06:22,482 --> 01:06:25,349
开火！
Shoot!

787
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:34,226
你成功了！
You did it!

788
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,835
我成功了？是你成功了！
I did it? You did it!

789
01:06:43,836 --> 01:06:45,202
你差点让我送了命！
You almost got me killed!

790
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:50,503
我最诚意的道歉，亚里克斯
My deepest apologies, Alex.

791
01:06:51,277 --> 01:06:53,712
我原本打算让你经历了枪林弹雨以后…
I had hoped that by putting you in the thick of battle,

792
01:06:53,713 --> 01:06:56,148
一个伟大的星空战士即将诞生
a great Starfighter would emerge.

793
01:06:56,315 --> 01:07:01,583
但是，唉。也许你本来就不是这块料
But, alas. Perhaps there was never one within you to begin with.

794
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,022
我载你回家吧
I shall take you home.

795
01:07:07,326 --> 01:07:10,785
在那儿，你仍可以过上很长一段时间的安稳日子…
You still may live a long and fruitful life back there.

796
01:07:11,564 --> 01:07:14,898
直到柯-旦打到地球
That is, until the Ko-Dan reach Earth.

797
01:07:16,235 --> 01:07:17,302
但到了那个时候…
But then again...

798
01:07:32,351 --> 01:07:35,554
嘿，布雷克！让那破音响再响一点啊！
Hey, yo, Blake! Make that sucker blast, man!

799
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:38,323
没问题，伙计！
You got it, dude! All right!

800
01:07:44,397 --> 01:07:47,098
布雷克回来是拿他的裤子的对吧？
So Blake comes back in to grab his pants, right?

801
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:48,934
看到她奶奶，说…
Sees her old lady, and says,

802
01:07:48,935 --> 01:07:51,995
“希望这不会让我星期二晚上没饭吃”
"I hope this doesn't rule out dinner on Tuesday night."

803
01:07:53,806 --> 01:07:55,331
你真搞笑！
That's my man!

804
01:07:59,178 --> 01:08:01,704
亚里克斯，你没事吧？
Alex, are you okay?

805
01:08:01,848 --> 01:08:02,948
啊？
Hmm?

806
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:05,145
对啊，没事。怎么了？
Yeah, sure. Why?

807
01:08:06,252 --> 01:08:09,421
我不知道，你老是走神
I don't know. You're just acting spaced out.

808
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:10,889
这…这很不像你啊
You're... You're not yourself.

809
01:08:12,859 --> 01:08:17,956
如果你是我，你现在会怎么办？
Well, if you were me, what would you be doing right now?

810
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:25,170
首先呢，我会先好好享受生活
Well, for one thing, I'd be trying to enjoy myself.

811
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:29,174
靠在车上，开开玩笑，大笑
Leaning back. Kidding around. Laughing.

812
01:08:29,175 --> 01:08:30,442
大笑？
Laughing?

813
01:08:30,443 --> 01:08:31,808
这只是个开始，亚里克斯
Well, it's a start, Alex.

814
01:08:32,712 --> 01:08:34,043
大笑
Laughing.

815
01:09:19,292 --> 01:09:22,260
好地方。让我想起我的家
Nice place. Reminds me of home.

816
01:09:22,261 --> 01:09:24,129
这能让你想家？
This reminds you of home?

817
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,825
哦，是啊
Oh, yes.

818
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:37,569
我和我的妻子和六千个孩子住在地下
I live below ground with my wifeoid and 6,000 little Griglings.

819
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:48,582
至少，在祖尔把他们变成努力之前
At least, until Xur turns them into slaves.

820
01:09:53,893 --> 01:09:56,157
你们这个物种住在哪儿？
Where does your kind live?

821
01:09:56,295 --> 01:09:58,594
哦，基本上都住在房子里
Oh, uh, houses, mostly.

822
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:02,961
也就是地上的洞穴。看看这个
That's caves above ground. See, here.

823
01:10:03,569 --> 01:10:06,300
这是我全家
Here's my family.

824
01:10:06,906 --> 01:10:08,396
看，这是…
See, that's...

825
01:10:09,008 --> 01:10:13,070
这是我父母，这是我弟弟，路易斯，这是玛姬
That's my folks and my brother, Louis, and that's Maggie.

826
01:10:15,281 --> 01:10:17,408
我们住在移动的家里
Uh, we live in a mobile home.

827
01:10:19,185 --> 01:10:21,585
就是会去各种地方的洞穴
That's a cave that goes places.

828
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:24,049
只是我们从来没去过别的地方
Only we never went anyplace.

829
01:10:26,692 --> 01:10:30,895
一个从来不去别处的移动洞穴。有意思
A mobile cave that never went anywhere. Fascinating.

830
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:34,366
是啊，但是我们在拖车场附近也有底下的洞穴
Yeah, but we have below-ground caves near the trailer parks.

831
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:37,769
我和我弟弟路易斯过去常常在里面玩捉迷藏…
Me and my brother, Louis, used to play hide-and-seek in them.

832
01:10:39,905 --> 01:10:41,973
捉迷藏
Hide-and-seek.

833
01:10:41,974 --> 01:10:43,041
捉迷藏是什么，亚里克斯？
What is it, Alex?

834
01:10:43,042 --> 01:10:46,745
我在想，也许我们可以躲在这里…
Well, I was just thinking, maybe we could hide here,

835
01:10:46,746 --> 01:10:51,149
等敌军经过的时候，从后方攻击他们的塔台
let the Armada pass by, and then hit the turret from behind.

836
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:53,710
然后，我们就以突袭的方式打败他们
Then we might take them by surprise.

837
01:10:58,891 --> 01:11:01,192
你的策略也许真能奏效
Your plan might really have worked.

838
01:11:01,193 --> 01:11:05,163
只可惜没有星空战士来执行它了
What a pity there are no Starfighters left to carry it out.

839
01:11:05,164 --> 01:11:06,495
是啊，是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

840
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:17,100
一个祖尔的基地！
A Xurian base!

841
01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:38,256
正前方还有两个。快速靠近中！
Two more dead ahead! Closing fast!

842
01:12:02,688 --> 01:12:05,783
前往地球的航线已准备完毕
Earth course is logged into navigational beams.

843
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,652
格里格？
Grig?

844
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:12,055
什么事，亚里克斯？
What is it, Alex?

845
01:12:16,969 --> 01:12:19,438
也许真的只剩下一个星空战士了
Maybe there is a Starfighter left.

846
01:12:58,377 --> 01:12:59,572
啊！
Ow!

847
01:13:07,453 --> 01:13:08,786
怎么了？
What's wrong?

848
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:10,380
我现在是不是该把我的舌头伸到你耳朵里？
Should I put my tongue in your ear now?

849
01:13:10,856 --> 01:13:12,552
算了，亚里克斯
Don't bother, Alex.

850
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:14,325
我只是…
Well, it's just...

851
01:13:14,326 --> 01:13:16,022
我只是不习惯这种事…
I'm kind of new at these gland games.

852
01:13:17,663 --> 01:13:19,697
你在说些什么啊？
What are you talking about?

853
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:22,634
就好像你是从外太空来的，亚里克斯！
It's like you're a million miles away, Alex!

854
01:13:32,344 --> 01:13:34,904
喂，喂，喂，等等啊，宝贝儿
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Darling.

855
01:13:36,015 --> 01:13:38,245
宝贝儿，原谅我吧
Darling, forgive me.

856
01:13:47,393 --> 01:13:49,225
“宝贝儿，原谅我吧”
"Darling, forgive me."

857
01:13:53,465 --> 01:13:54,797
拜托！
Come on!

858
01:13:55,868 --> 01:13:58,236
你是我的茱丽叶，我的维纳斯
You're my Juliet. My Venus.

859
01:14:02,341 --> 01:14:06,335
“你是我的茱丽叶，我的维纳斯”
"You're my Juliet. My Venus."

860
01:14:09,515 --> 01:14:11,049
亚里克斯！
Alex!

861
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:13,018
其他女孩儿对我来说都毫无意义
All the other girls meant nothing to me.

862
01:14:13,652 --> 01:14:16,854
我爱的是你啊。你，你
It was you, you, you.

863
01:14:16,855 --> 01:14:19,123
住口，跟我说点脏的
Shut up and talk dirty to me.

864
01:14:20,893 --> 01:14:26,058
“其他女孩儿对我来说都毫无意义。我爱的是你啊。你，你”
"The other girls meant nothing to me. It was you, you..."

865
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,634
我要跟你说点脏的吗？
Should I talk dirty to you now?

866
01:14:30,736 --> 01:14:32,136
够了
That does it.

867
01:14:32,137 --> 01:14:35,107
哦，天啊。好的，我放弃了
Oh, God. All right. I give up.

868
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:37,275
我不是亚里克斯罗根
I'm not Alex Rogan.

869
01:14:37,276 --> 01:14:38,843
什么？
What?

870
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:40,044
我只是个替身
I'm a beta unit.

871
01:14:40,045 --> 01:14:41,308
我是亚里克斯的复制品
I'm an exact duplicate of Alex.

872
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,814
他在那儿拯救全宇宙…
He's up there saving the universe,

873
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,612
我在这儿做敌军的诱饵
while I'm down here for target practice.

874
01:14:47,353 --> 01:14:48,581
看到了吧？
See?

875
01:14:57,429 --> 01:14:59,430
亚里克斯！或者不管你是谁，等等，等等
Alex! Or whatever you are. Wait. Wait.

876
01:14:59,431 --> 01:15:00,531
你在干什么？让我走
What are you do... Let me go.

877
01:15:00,532 --> 01:15:01,599
如果那个赞多-赞向总部报告…
If that Zando-Zan reports back

878
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,801
说我不是亚里克斯，亚里克斯就有危险了
that I'm not Alex, Alex is in big trouble!

879
01:15:03,802 --> 01:15:05,136
-你呆在这儿 -不，我不要
You're staying here. No, I'm not.

880
01:15:05,137 --> 01:15:07,731
我哪儿都不要呆直到我弄清楚真相
I'm not staying anywhere until I find out what's going on!

881
01:15:10,175 --> 01:15:12,974
嘿，我的卡车！嘿，嘿，回来！
Hey, my truck! Hey, hey, come back!

882
01:15:15,314 --> 01:15:17,578
有一点点擦坏，你就死定了，罗根！
Scratch that paint, and you're dead, Rogan!

883
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,394
入侵已就绪，指挥长
Ready to invade, Commander.

884
01:15:29,395 --> 01:15:30,495
入侵
Invade.

885
01:15:30,496 --> 01:15:33,665
指挥长，祖尔飞船一直没有回复我们的入侵代码
Commander, the Xurian ships have not answered our invasion code.

886
01:15:33,666 --> 01:15:36,100
边境瓦解了，月亮消失了…
The Frontier is down, the moon is eclipsed,

887
01:15:36,101 --> 01:15:38,434
星空战士都死了。开始入侵吧！
the Starfighters are dead. lnvade!

888
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:43,240
所有空中部队，半速前进。开启能源探测器
All squadrons ahead, half speed, with energy probes on.

889
01:16:13,872 --> 01:16:16,705
能源探测器。快关闭，亚里克斯。关闭
Energy probe. Shut down, Alex. Shut down.

890
01:16:17,943 --> 01:16:19,274
关闭
Power off.

891
01:16:35,995 --> 01:16:38,225
亚里克斯在太空中？
Alex? ln space?

892
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:43,534
-真的假的？ -真的！我不是一直在跟你说嘛
Is this for real? - Yes! That's what I'm trying to tell you!

893
01:16:43,535 --> 01:16:44,836
全是真的！
It's all for real!

894
01:16:44,837 --> 01:16:46,430
那别说话了，开车啊！
Well, then, don't talk. Drive!

895
01:16:59,685 --> 01:17:02,887
克里尔指挥长，紧急频率收到信号
Commander Kril, we're getting a signal on the alert frequency.

896
01:17:02,888 --> 01:17:04,288
接收
Acknowledge.

897
01:17:07,793 --> 01:17:09,394
到了。好的
There it is. All right.

898
01:17:09,395 --> 01:17:11,362
等我接近发射器以后你就跳，知道了吗？
Now, when I give the signal, we're gonna jump! Okay?

899
01:17:11,363 --> 01:17:13,297
-“跳”是什么意思？ -我们用车撞掉它
What do you mean, "Jump"? We're gonna ram him.

900
01:17:13,298 --> 01:17:14,288
什么？
What?

901
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:18,102
灭绝特使六号有一则消息
Extermination Emissary Zeta 6, one message.

902
01:17:18,103 --> 01:17:20,071
准备好了吗？跳！
Ready? Jump!

903
01:17:20,072 --> 01:17:21,506
亚里克斯！
Alex!

904
01:17:23,108 --> 01:17:25,042
“最后的星空战士…”
"The last Starfighter..."

905
01:17:27,012 --> 01:17:28,912
你欠我一个人情，亚里克斯
You owe me one, Alex.

906
01:17:35,254 --> 01:17:36,414
亚里克斯！
Alex!

907
01:17:39,124 --> 01:17:41,459
通讯中断，指挥长
Transmission pulsars have stopped, Commander.

908
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,361
最后的星空战士…
The last Starfighter...

909
01:17:43,362 --> 01:17:45,023
已死亡！
Is dead!

910
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:48,430
最后的星空战士已死亡！
The last Starfighter is dead!

911
01:17:49,368 --> 01:17:52,103
我们是无可阻挡的了！全速前进！
Nothing can stop us now. Ahead full.

912
01:17:52,104 --> 01:17:54,038
前往赖罗斯！
To Rylos!

913
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:15,650
指挥舰！

914
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:22,935
那儿！塔台在最后面
There! The turret at the far end!

915
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:25,932
我看见了
I see it.

916
01:18:29,108 --> 01:18:30,507
祝你好运，星空战士
Good luck, Starfighter.

917
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:33,508
谢谢你所做的一切，格里格
Thanks, Grig. For everything.

918
01:18:47,126 --> 01:18:48,991

930
01:19:31,203 --> 01:19:32,636
等等
Wait.

931
01:19:32,771 --> 01:19:34,239
刚星！
Gunstar!

932
01:19:34,706 --> 01:19:38,939
最后的星空战士不是死了吗？
So, the last Starfighter is dead?

933
01:19:40,078 --> 01:19:43,514
我受够了。抓起来！
This has gone far enough. Seize him!

934
01:19:44,316 --> 01:19:47,985
你们敢！我是赖罗斯的帝王！
How dare you? I am the Emperor of Rylos!

935
01:19:47,986 --> 01:19:50,988
我，只有我，才能指挥这…
I and I alone command this entire op...

936
01:19:50,989 --> 01:19:53,624
放开我！我命令你！

937
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:56,390
你会付出生命的代价的！

在那儿，塔台！
There it is, the turret!

940
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,877
亚里克斯，就现在！
Alex, now!

941
01:20:15,013 --> 01:20:16,113
好！
Yeah!

942
01:20:16,114 --> 01:20:17,138
击中了！
Got it!

943
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:19,984
快，亚里克斯！开火！
Hurry, Alex! Fire!

944
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:21,475
敌军积聚已经到达了赖罗斯！

01:21:00,392 --> 01:21:03,919
所有的通信雷达系统都瘫痪了，指挥部
All communication radar systems are out, Wing Commander.

951
01:21:04,496 --> 01:21:07,124
成视觉攻击队列
Proceed with a visual attack formation.

952
01:21:10,936 --> 01:21:14,939
维生系统良好。弹药装备量满
Life support good. Ammo packs at peak.

953
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:16,741
我认为我们要使用死亡霸王花了
I think we've got to use Death Blossom.

954
01:21:16,742 --> 01:21:18,409
记住，死亡霸王花只能在近距离…
Remember, Death Blossom delivers

955
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:20,640
给目标以重击
only one massive volley at close range.

956
01:21:21,413 --> 01:21:22,913
理论上是这样的
Theoretically.

957
01:21:22,914 --> 01:21:24,382
“理论上”是什么意思？
What do you mean, "Theoretically"?

958
01:21:24,383 --> 01:21:26,550
毕竟，死亡霸王花从来没被测试过
After all, D.B. has never been tested.

959
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:29,287
它也许会让飞船超负荷，而毁了飞船
It might overload the systems. Blow up the ship.

960
01:21:29,288 --> 01:21:30,454
你还在担心什么，格里格？
What are you worried about, Grig?

961
01:21:30,455 --> 01:21:32,256
理论上，我们已经死了
Theoretically, we should already be dead.

962
01:21:32,257 --> 01:21:33,520
Mmm-hmm.

963
01:21:34,393 --> 01:21:37,123
打开死亡霸王花踏板，开启
Open Death Blossom petals. Switch is on.

964
01:21:51,677 --> 01:21:54,305
没进入射程千万别发动死亡霸王花
Do not trigger D.B. until we're within range.

965
01:21:54,446 --> 01:21:57,148
先用激光攻击，直到我收到信号
Just use your lasers until I give the signal.

966
01:21:57,149 --> 01:21:58,282
记得要…
Remember to lead...

967
01:21:58,283 --> 01:21:59,784
我被星际联盟录取…
I've been recruited by the Star League

968
01:21:59,785 --> 01:22:01,552
防御边境
to defend the Frontier.

969
01:22:01,553 --> 01:22:02,653
准备好了吗？
Now, are you ready?

970
01:22:02,654 --> 01:22:05,282
到时候了。我们开始吧
This is it. Here we go.

971
01:22:05,424 --> 01:22:07,119
冲啊！
Charge!

972
01:22:36,555 --> 01:22:38,045
右面！
On your right!

973
01:22:39,624 --> 01:22:41,092
左面！
Your left!

974
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,626
闪躲！
Evade!

975
01:22:47,466 --> 01:22:49,900
能量储备不足！我们需要时间充电！
Power packs are low! We need time to recharge!

976
01:22:52,204 --> 01:22:54,035
激光能量耗尽
Laser power draining!

977
01:23:02,547 --> 01:23:05,816
格里格，我的武器都用完了。使用霸王花吗？
Grig, my weapons are gone! Should I do it?

978
01:23:05,817 --> 01:23:06,884
慢着，慢着
Easy, easy.

979
01:23:06,885 --> 01:23:08,717
等到他们都在霸王花的射程内
Wait till they're all in Death Blossom range!

980
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:19,795
发射！
Fire!

981
01:23:53,165 --> 01:23:55,224
我们成功了！
We did it.

982
01:23:55,367 --> 01:23:57,460
是的，我们真的成功了，对吧？
Yes, we actually did, didn't we?

983
01:24:01,239 --> 01:24:02,935
是指挥舰！
The command ship!

984
01:24:03,308 --> 01:24:04,809
指挥长，我们的枪已损坏
Commander, our guns are out.

985
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:06,544
维修小组正在维修
Damage control is repairing them.

986
01:24:06,545 --> 01:24:10,003
还要什么枪！急速前进！
Forget the guns! Ramming speed!

987
01:24:18,824 --> 01:24:19,957
格里格，我们需要能量！
Grig, we need power!

988
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:21,790
死亡霸王花用尽了所有的能量
Death Blossom's drained all power.

989
01:24:22,027 --> 01:24:25,725
我正在尽力，我要运行能量激增模式！
I'm working on it. I'm trying to run boost.

990
01:24:29,201 --> 01:24:31,999
我们剩下的只是维生系统的能量
All we have left is life support power!

991
01:24:38,677 --> 01:24:39,974
格里格！
Grig!

992
01:24:46,184 --> 01:24:47,515
好了！
All right!

993
01:24:55,126 --> 01:24:58,858
可以开火了。我们有能量了。开火！开火！
Weapons on! We have them now! Fire. Fire!

994
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:23,020
估损报告
Damage report!

995
01:25:24,189 --> 01:25:27,758
导航系统瘫痪，转向系统瘫痪
Guidance system out. Auxiliary steering out.

996
01:25:27,759 --> 01:25:29,193
撤退！
Divert!

997
01:25:30,161 --> 01:25:31,595
撤退！
Divert!

998
01:25:31,596 --> 01:25:33,097
转向系统无响应
She won't answer the helm!

999
01:25:33,098 --> 01:25:35,532
我们被锁定在月球的重力轨道上
We're locked into the moon's gravitational pull!

1000
01:25:35,533 --> 01:25:37,058
我们要怎么办？
What do we do?

1001
01:25:40,906 --> 01:25:42,072
只有死路一条
We die.

1002
01:26:03,528 --> 01:26:07,064
代表星际联盟和所有的赖罗斯公民…
On behalf of the Star League and all citizens of Rylos,

1003
01:26:07,065 --> 01:26:10,334
我祝贺你光荣凯旋
I congratulate you on your dazzling victory.

1004
01:26:10,335 --> 01:26:12,002
-谢谢你 -谢谢
Thank you. Thanks.

1005
01:26:12,003 --> 01:26:15,439
但是，你知道，边境已经瓦解…
But as you know, the Frontier is down,

1006
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,975
祖尔也逃跑了。危险依然存在
Xur escaped, and there is still danger.

1007
01:26:17,976 --> 01:26:21,178
所以，我在想，你是不是愿意呆在这儿…
So I was wondering if you wouldn't be willing to stay on,

1008
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:23,714
重建星际联盟？
and rebuild the Starfighter Legion.

1009
01:26:23,715 --> 01:26:25,240
等等
Wait a minute.

1010
01:26:26,051 --> 01:26:27,718
重建星际联盟？
Rebuild the Legion?

1011
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:29,084
没错
Yes.

1012
01:26:29,421 --> 01:26:32,823
当然，你也会有一位老朋友来帮忙
Of course, you'd have the help of an old friend.

1013
01:26:33,992 --> 01:26:35,721
老朋友？谁？
An old friend? Who?

1014
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:54,812
森特利！我以为你死了！
Centauri! I thought you were dead!

1015
01:26:54,813 --> 01:26:58,382
我死了，还错过精彩的战事？哦，不！
Me die and miss all the excitement? Oh, no.

1016
01:26:58,383 --> 01:27:01,018
我只是进入休眠状态好让我的身体自行恢复
I was merely dormant while my body repaired itself.

1017
01:27:01,019 --> 01:27:03,053
我就废话少说了
Now, I won't bore you with details.

1018
01:27:03,054 --> 01:27:05,923
一句话：你在赖罗斯星，我的孩子
Suffice it to say, you're on Rylos, my boy.

1019
01:27:05,924 --> 01:27:07,391
别想着人类了
Stop thinking human.

1020
01:27:07,392 --> 01:27:08,993
这是第一课
That's lesson number one.

1021
01:27:08,994 --> 01:27:12,496
现在，第二课，你在这里远近闻名
Now, lesson number two, you've got a good thing going here.

1022
01:27:12,497 --> 01:27:14,989
保持微笑，别扫兴
Keep smiling. Don't blow it.

1023
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:18,963
第三课，总是相信森特利
Lesson number three, always trust Centauri.

1024
01:27:23,975 --> 01:27:25,841
亚里克斯，他们多爱你！
Alex, they love you!

1025
01:27:29,914 --> 01:27:32,941
你看，整个赖罗斯星就在你下面
You see, all Rylos is behind you.

1026
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:35,986
你得留下 ，亚里克斯！
You've got to stay, Alex!

1027
01:27:35,987 --> 01:27:38,022
你会留下的，对吧？
You will stay, won't you?

1028
01:27:38,023 --> 01:27:39,523
当然，他会留下的
Of course, he'll stay.

1029
01:27:40,792 --> 01:27:42,993
这真的很令人欣慰，森特利
That's very reassuring, Centauri.

1030
01:27:42,994 --> 01:27:45,486
格里格，我就把这些事交给你了
Grig, I leave it in your capable hands.

1031
01:27:47,499 --> 01:27:48,966
我留下
I'll stay.

1032
01:28:01,646 --> 01:28:04,741
亚里克斯！亚里克斯！
Alex! Alex!

1033
01:28:18,363 --> 01:28:19,796
你好…
Greetings...

1034
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:22,900
你好，星空战士
Greetings, Starfighter.

1035
01:28:22,901 --> 01:28:24,368
孩子，你看到亚里克斯了吗？
Bunny, have you seen Alex?

1036
01:28:24,369 --> 01:28:25,769
怎么会呢
Can't say that I have.

1037
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:29,073
问玛姬吧，她知道他在哪儿
Well, ask Maggie. She knows where he is.

1038
01:28:29,074 --> 01:28:31,075
她原本和他在一起的
She was with him.

1039
01:28:31,076 --> 01:28:32,543
玛姬，亚里克斯呢？
Maggie, where's Alex?

1040
01:28:32,544 --> 01:28:35,212
我的卡车在哪儿？你的男朋友在哪儿？
Yeah, where's my truck? Where's your boyfriend?

1041
01:28:35,213 --> 01:28:37,915
罗根太太，关于亚里克斯，他…
Mrs. Rogan, about Alex, you see, he's...

1042
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:43,485
-什么东西？发生什么了？ -我不知道
What is it? What's going on? I don't know.

1043
01:29:05,577 --> 01:29:07,170
哦，天啊！
Oh, my God!

1044
01:29:10,181 --> 01:29:12,480
太好了，我们被侵略了！
All right! We're being invaded!

1045
01:29:39,944 --> 01:29:41,241
玛姬
Maggie.

1046
01:29:42,347 --> 01:29:43,678
玛姬
Maggie.

1047
01:30:46,911 --> 01:30:48,038
亚里克斯？
Alex?

1048
01:30:48,179 --> 01:30:49,340
嗨，玛姬
Hi, Maggs.

1049
01:30:50,381 --> 01:30:51,542
亚里克斯
Alex,

1050
01:30:53,618 --> 01:30:54,718
是你吗？
is it you?

1051
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,655
真的是你吗？
I mean, is it really you?

1052
01:31:02,527 --> 01:31:03,619
看！
Look!

1053
01:31:05,396 --> 01:31:06,625
天啊！
My God.

1054
01:31:07,432 --> 01:31:08,695
真的是你！
It is you.

1055
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:11,835
是亚里克斯！亚里克斯！
It's Alex! Alex!

1056
01:31:11,836 --> 01:31:13,470
亚里克斯，发生了什么？
Alex, what is going on here?

1057
01:31:13,471 --> 01:31:15,005
这是什么？
What is this thing?

1058
01:31:23,448 --> 01:31:24,948
这是你的太空飞船？
Is this your spaceship?

1059
01:31:24,949 --> 01:31:26,610
我不知道他中了什么邪了
I don't know what's gotten into him.

1060
01:31:26,751 --> 01:31:28,518
我真搞不懂
I don't understand that.

1061
01:31:28,519 --> 01:31:30,053
这太奇怪了！
It's so strange!

1062
01:31:30,054 --> 01:31:31,555
等等，等等。大家，安静
Wait. Hold it. Hold it, everybody.

1063
01:31:31,556 --> 01:31:34,582
亚里克斯，这一切是怎么回事？
Alex, what is all this?

1064
01:31:37,061 --> 01:31:39,196
我去了另外一个星球，妈
I've been to another planet, Ma.

1065
01:31:39,197 --> 01:31:40,364
另外一个星球？
Another planet?

1066
01:31:41,466 --> 01:31:43,667
是谁帮我修好了天线？
Who was it helped fix my antenna?

1067
01:31:43,668 --> 01:31:44,735
对啊，谁偷了我的卡车？
Yeah, who stole my truck?

1068
01:31:44,736 --> 01:31:45,802
谁切断了我家的电？
And cut my electric?

1069
01:31:45,803 --> 01:31:47,904
还把我的炉子弄坏了
And ruined my stove?

1070
01:31:47,906 --> 01:31:50,240
哦，那是…那是个替身
Oh, that was... That was a beta unit.

1071
01:31:50,241 --> 01:31:51,375
替身？
Beta unit?

1072
01:31:51,376 --> 01:31:52,442
一个机器人
A robot.

1073
01:31:52,443 --> 01:31:53,844
机器人？什么…
Robot? What the...

1074
01:31:53,845 --> 01:31:55,145
拜托！
Come on!

1075
01:31:55,146 --> 01:31:56,747
怪兽！
A monster!

1076
01:32:00,718 --> 01:32:02,252
怪兽
A monster!

1077
01:32:02,253 --> 01:32:04,222
他给他们套上了链子
He got them chains on him.

1078
01:32:04,355 --> 01:32:06,423
太棒了，是外星人！
All right! It's an alien!

1079
01:32:06,424 --> 01:32:08,025
哦，不，等等！嘿，嘿！
Oh, no, wait! Hey, hey!

1080
01:32:08,026 --> 01:32:10,127
奶奶，把枪放下。你们怎么回事啊？
Granny, put away that shotgun. What's wrong with you?

1081
01:32:10,128 --> 01:32:11,595
这是我的朋友格里格
This is my friend Grig.

1082
01:32:11,596 --> 01:32:13,030
我要你们大家见见我的朋友
I want you all to meet my friend here.

1083
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:14,097
你在开玩笑吧！
You got to be kidding!

1084
01:32:14,098 --> 01:32:16,499
格里格，这是布恩太太
Grig, this is Mrs. Boone.

1085
01:32:18,236 --> 01:32:19,336
你好
Hello.

1086
01:32:19,337 --> 01:32:20,470
你好
Hello.

1087
01:32:20,471 --> 01:32:21,705
这是艾尔维拉
And this is Elvira.

1088
01:32:21,706 --> 01:32:22,839
兴会
Delighted.

1089
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,274
我也是。你好吗？
Me, too. How you doing?

1090
01:32:24,275 --> 01:32:25,542
我很好
I do well.

1091
01:32:25,543 --> 01:32:26,910
这是奶奶
And this is Granny.

1092
01:32:26,911 --> 01:32:28,345
兴会
How do you do?

1093
01:32:28,346 --> 01:32:30,180
兴会
How do you do?

1094
01:32:30,181 --> 01:32:31,715
这位是Otis
And this here's Otis.

1095
01:32:31,716 --> 01:32:33,183
很高兴见到你
A pleasure.

1096
01:32:33,184 --> 01:32:35,380
亚里克斯的任何朋友都…
Any friend of Alex...

1097
01:32:36,621 --> 01:32:38,453
这是玛姬
And this is Maggie.

1098
01:32:39,624 --> 01:32:41,592
非常荣幸
A very large pleasure.

1099
01:32:42,327 --> 01:32:43,560
嗨
Hi.

1100
01:32:47,865 --> 01:32:49,731
你一定是路易斯！
You must be Louis!

1101
01:32:52,503 --> 01:32:55,072
你的事情我如雷贯耳
I hear good things about you.

1102
01:32:55,073 --> 01:32:57,407
听到了吗？我很有名
Hear that, you slimes? I'm famous.

1103
01:33:00,111 --> 01:33:02,478
这位是我的母亲
And this is my mom.

1104
01:33:05,483 --> 01:33:08,282
你应该为亚里克斯骄傲，罗根太太
You should be proud of Alex, Mrs. Rogan.

1105
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,153
你们都应该为他骄傲
You must all be proud of him.

1106
01:33:10,154 --> 01:33:14,057
他拯救了星际联盟以及成百上千的世界，包括地球
He saved the Star League and hundreds of worlds, including Earth.

1107
01:33:14,058 --> 01:33:15,856
哦，你太棒了！
Oh, for heaven's sake!

1108
01:33:15,994 --> 01:33:17,825
哦，天啊！
Oh, my God!

1109
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:21,765
要走了，亚里克斯
Time to leave, Alex.

1110
01:33:21,766 --> 01:33:23,029
亚里克斯？
Alex?

1111
01:33:23,534 --> 01:33:24,768
我必须得走，妈
I have to, Ma.

1112
01:33:24,769 --> 01:33:26,303
他们那儿需要我
They need me up there.

1113
01:33:26,304 --> 01:33:29,139
哦，亚里克斯，我就知道有一天你要离开我们
Oh, Alex, I always knew you'd leave someday,

1114
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:31,041
但我没想到会是这样
but I never expected this.

1115
01:33:31,042 --> 01:33:33,310
我能去吗，亚里克斯？行吗？
Gee, can I go, too, Alex? Can I?

1116
01:33:33,311 --> 01:33:36,012
抱歉了，小子，那里只有足够的空间…
Sorry, squirt. There's only enough room up there

1117
01:33:36,013 --> 01:33:38,676
给我，格里格和玛姬
for me, Grig, and Maggie.

1118
01:33:40,351 --> 01:33:42,012
-我？ -没错
Me? Yeah.

1119
01:33:43,588 --> 01:33:45,956
亚里克斯，我可不认为我能…
Alex, I don't think I can...

1120
01:33:45,957 --> 01:33:48,448
什么？过来，过来
What? Come here. Come here.

1121
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,094
你认为我还会回来吗？
Why else do you think I came back?

1122
01:33:51,095 --> 01:33:54,164
那…我们不是说了要永远在一起的吗？
Well... Didn't we say we'd always be together?

1123
01:33:54,165 --> 01:33:57,692
是啊，可是我是指在这里或者城里
Well, yeah, I mean, together here or in the city.

1124
01:33:58,202 --> 01:33:59,970
但是…但是，在那儿，亚里克斯…
But... But up there, Alex...

1125
01:33:59,971 --> 01:34:01,505
玛姬，你必须得来。你看，我不知道…
Maggs, you got to come. You see, I'm not...

1126
01:34:01,506 --> 01:34:03,473
我不知道我什么时候才回来
I don't know when I'm gonna be back.

1127
01:34:04,575 --> 01:34:06,476
你不明白吗？这，就是我们最大的机会了
Don't you see? This is it. This is our big chance.

1128
01:34:06,477 --> 01:34:08,845
就像Otis说的…
It's like what Otis says,

1129
01:34:08,846 --> 01:34:10,547
当机会来临时…
when it comes, you got to grab on

1130
01:34:10,548 --> 01:34:12,277
用双手紧紧抓住它
with both hands and hold tight.

1131
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:17,584
那，奶奶怎么办呢，亚里克斯？
Well, what about Granny, Alex?

1132
01:34:22,727 --> 01:34:25,492
你说得对，我是很害怕离开这里
You're right. I'm scared of leaving here.

1133
01:34:26,764 --> 01:34:28,398
你为什么就不能留下呢？
Why can't you just stay?

1134
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:31,960
玛姬，我必须得走。我要你也跟我走
Maggie, I have to leave, and I want you to come with me.

1135
01:34:35,907 --> 01:34:38,774
亚里克斯！快啊！
Alex! Hurry!

1136
01:34:41,879 --> 01:34:43,540
我要走了
Well, I got to go.

1137
01:34:48,252 --> 01:34:49,413
再见
Bye.

1138
01:34:53,191 --> 01:34:55,792
亚里克斯，他们的雷达我们屏蔽不了多久了
Alex, we can't hold off their radar any longer.

1139
01:34:55,793 --> 01:34:57,921
好的，来了。我要走了，妈
Yeah, okay. I got to go, Ma.

1140
01:34:58,496 --> 01:34:59,896
-再见。多保重 -再见，孩子
Bye. Take it easy. Bye, darling.

1141
01:34:59,897 --> 01:35:01,431
后会有期。大家，后会有期了
So long. So long, everybody.

1142
01:35:01,432 --> 01:35:02,632
再见，亚里克斯！
Bye, Alex!

1143
01:35:02,633 --> 01:35:03,967
再见！
Bye!

1144
01:35:03,968 --> 01:35:07,437
再见，亚里克斯！
Bye, Alex. Bye, Alex!

1145
01:35:17,281 --> 01:35:18,442
亚里克斯！
Alex!

1146
01:35:19,851 --> 01:35:21,148
奶奶…
Granny...

1147
01:35:22,386 --> 01:35:25,823
记得要写信告诉我们那边的情况
Be sure and write, or whatever it is they do up there.

1148
01:35:30,995 --> 01:35:33,157
亚里克斯！等等，亚里克斯！
Alex! Wait, Alex!

1149
01:35:51,549 --> 01:35:52,883
回来！快回来！
Get back! Come on!

1150
01:35:52,884 --> 01:35:54,184
再见了！
Bye!

1151
01:35:54,185 --> 01:35:55,819
保持距离！注意安全！
Keep your distance! Watch what you're doing.

1152
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:57,754
保持距离！
Keep your distance, now.

1153
01:35:57,755 --> 01:36:00,023
这玩意打起仗来真带劲
This baby really packs a punch!

1154
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,422
再见
Bye.

1155
01:36:02,994 --> 01:36:04,094
再见
Bye.

1156
01:36:04,095 --> 01:36:06,495
看看他啊！再见！
Look at him! Bye!

1157
01:36:06,697 --> 01:36:07,994
再见
Bye.

1158
01:36:10,968 --> 01:36:15,599
哦，走吧。他们在那儿会很快乐的。再见，亚里克斯！
Oh, go on. They're gonna be happy up there! So long, Alex!

1159
01:36:17,508 --> 01:36:19,242
后会有期，亚里克斯！
So long, Alex!

1160
01:36:22,513 --> 01:36:24,014
我们就要出名了，对吧，Otis？
We're gonna be famous, aren't we, Otis?

1161
01:36:24,015 --> 01:36:25,315
没错！
Yes, sir!

1162
01:36:25,316 --> 01:36:29,152
全世界，全宇宙都将知道
The whole world, the whole universe is gonna know about it!

1163
01:36:29,153 --> 01:36:30,921
星星闪耀的地方…
Starlite, Starbrite,

1164
01:36:30,922 --> 01:36:34,591
就是亚里克斯和玛姬出发去宇宙的地方！
the place where Alex and Maggie left for the stars!

1165
01:36:34,592 --> 01:36:36,960
路易斯！路易斯！
Louis! Louis!

1166
01:36:36,961 --> 01:36:38,628
你好，星空战士！

1167
01:36:38,629 --> 01:36:40,530
你已被星空联盟录取…
You have been recruited by the Star League

1168
01:36:40,531 --> 01:36:44,058
誓死保卫边境，抗击约和柯-旦舰队的入侵
to defend the Frontier against Yur and the Ko-Dan Armada.

1169
01:36:52,043 --> 01:36:53,943
哇！
Wow!
