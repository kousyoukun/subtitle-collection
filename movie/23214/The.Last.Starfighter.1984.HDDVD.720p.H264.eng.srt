1
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,542
Good morning.

2
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,511
lt's 8:00 in wonderful
Coombs County,

3
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,814
where once again state police
have refused to confirm or deny

4
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:05,418
more of those mysterious "lights in
the sky" sightings by local residents.

5
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,887
Roving air reporters spoke
with Miss Josie Floss,

6
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,355
w£o made just
such a sighting.

7
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,991
l've seen those
lights with my own eyes.

8
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,291
And when l called the police,
they told me it was swamp gas.

9
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,332
Bullshit! Ain't no swamps
in Coombs County!

10
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,468
l tell you,
with them illegal aliens...

11
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,938
Gonna be a sparkling day.

12
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,406
Sparkling.

13
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:31,367
Makes me crazy! Clara!

14
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,846
Clara!

15
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,182
My electric's gone
out again, Clara!

16
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,717
l'm gonna miss my soaps!

17
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,818
Oh, stop your yakking.

18
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,952
Bill?

19
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,455
Bill, Elvira's
blacked out again.

20
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,723
Pass the word.

21
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,924
Have a nice day, honey.

22
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,392
Okay, thanks, Mrs. Boone.
You, too.

23
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,328
Elvira's
got no electric.

24
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,631
She can't see her soaps,
she'll hyperventilate.

25
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,033
Great day for a picnic,
Maggie!

26
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,102
Can't wait, Mr. Boone.
Catch yourself a big one!

27
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,169
lf l can!

28
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,939
Granny, l fixed your lunch
and put it in the fridge.

29
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,073
Have fun, child.

30
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,241
Sure you're
gonna be okay?

31
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,309
l'll be fine, dear.

32
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,506
Now you just run along. Bye!

33
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,917
Hi, Mrs. Rogan.

34
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,052
Hi, Maggie.

35
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,321
Did you find that
picnic basket yet?

36
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,388
lt's in the living room.

37
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,424
Oh, thanks.
Where's Alex?

38
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,792
Where else?

39
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,022
Right.

40
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,626
Louis.

41
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,234
Good morning,
space-son Louis.

42
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,568
Earthling.

43
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,900
Louis!

44
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,369
Jane!

45
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,407
Elvira's electric is out again,

46
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,742
and she's gonna get hyper
if she can't see her soaps!

47
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,448
Granny, tell Elvira
that Alex will be over

48
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,017
to patch her electric
in time for the soaps.

49
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,453
l'll tell her, Jane.
Elvira!

50
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,988
Louis!
Elvira!

51
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,589
Louis!

52
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,124
Go tell Alex that l need him.

53
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,626
Beware, aliens.

54
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,823
Louis Rogan,
the cosmic cadet,

55
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,158
the space avenger,

56
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,570

63
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,557
Right there!
Right there!

64
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,372
Aim.

65
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,473
They're all through
the center.

66
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,908
Shoot them, okay?

67
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,977
Now from the bottom up,
okay.

68
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,712
There's one
right over there.

Okay, doing good.
Right up there.

71
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:50,941
Uh, sorry.

72
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,789

Come on, Alex.

85
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,960

00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,630
Uh, no. l don't think so.

87
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,898
What's it this time,
Rogan?

88
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,366
You joining
the Foreign Legion?

97

We're gonna be late.

107
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,620
Look. You...

108
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,222
You'd just better
go ahead without me.

109
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,791
No. Alex, l'll stay.

110
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,817
No. That's okay. This'll take a while.

111
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,986
l'll catch up with you later.

112
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,164
Alex...

113
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,772
Bye-bye, Rogan!

114
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,070

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,519
Thanks, Alex!

118
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,403

120
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,150
How about cards?

121
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,983
Hey, that's a good idea.

122
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,951
But we played
cards last night.

123
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,285
Well...

124
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,360
The missus wants to go into
town tonight and go dancing.

125
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,692
The fish were really biting
down there at the stream.

126
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,194
lt was pleasant
fishing today.

127
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,925
Yup. lt's gonna be
pleasant tomorrow, too.

128
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:35,133
Gonna be a pleasant summer
according to Farmer's Almanac.

129
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,466
Yeah. l love
the Farmer's Almanac.

130
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,601
l've been reading it
for years.

131
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,382
Greetings, Starfighter.

132
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,613
You have been recruited
by the Star League

133
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,319
to defend the Frontier against
Yur and the Ko-Dan Armada.

134

00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,641
Hey, Otis.

139
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,549
Where's your Maggie?

140
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,555
Good question.

141
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,047

l guess.

142
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,294
Oh. And you never

143
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,662
ls that it?

144
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,665
Oh, sure. l love patching
30-year-old fuse panels

145
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,896
and plunging
people's toilets.

146
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,070
Otis, l never even
get a chance

147
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,630
to have a good
time around here.

148
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,901
Things change. Always do.

149
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,349
You'll get your chance.

150
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,651
lmportant thing is,
when it comes,

151
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,384
you got to grab it with
both hands and hold on tight.

152
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,623
Enemy squadrons in Sectors
3, 6, 7 closing fast.

153
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,206
Thanks, Jack.

154
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,307
You're welcome.

155
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,707
Good night, Maggie.
Good night.

156
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,578
Thought you were gonna
meet me at the lake.

157
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,046
What happened?

158
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,605
Same thing that always
happens. l couldn't get away.

159
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,678
Where's everybody else?

160
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,380
Oh, they went to a movie.

161
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,228
Old Jack Blake just happened
to be going your way, huh?

162
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,356
Enemy squadron in Sector 3.

163
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,300
He said it was
on his way home.

164
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,463
Blake lives on
the other side of town.

165
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,501
Come on, Alex.

166
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,835
l wanted to get back to you.

167
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,912
Okay?

168
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,745
Good show, Starfighter!
Way to go.

169
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,412
Alex, look!

170
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,223
Oh, my God.
What is that? 000,000!

171
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:51,266
000,000!
You gonna bust the record!

172
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:58,076
Hey! Hey! Listen up,
everybody!

173
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,671
Alex is going
for the record!

174
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,214
Record?

175
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,850
Take... Take a hand.

176
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,513
Got them!
Oh, he's gonna get that one!

177
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,048
You can do it!

178
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,327
Otis?

179
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,465
Otis, what are you yelling
about? What's wrong?

180
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,634
Come on! Come on!

181
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,569
He's going to
bust the record!

182
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,606
Hurry! Hurry!

183
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,908
Everyone get back!
Don't crowd him!

184
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,934
l said, get back!

185
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,754
Alex, you never
got this far before!

186
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,121
Go, Alex!

187
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,328
Good boy!

188
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,001
Ko-Dan command ship
entering kill zone.

189
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,202
Command ship!

190
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,470
Oh, command ship!

191
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,105
What's a command ship?

192
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,074
You can do it, Alex!
You can do it!

193
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,481
One more now. Come on!
That's the one!

194
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,746
That's the one we want!

195
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,627
Yeah! Yeah!

196
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,763
Good night.
Way to go, Alex!

197
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:58,864
Good night, kids.

198
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,355
Alex, you're something else.

199
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,067
You're wonderful, boy.

200
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,763
Thank you.

201
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,704
lf l said it once,
l said it a thousand times.

202
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,305
That boy's gonna go places.

203
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,865
That's one smart boy.

204
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,983
Good night, Alex.

205
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,861
"Good night, Alex"?
Wait a second.

206
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,024
Maggie? Maggie?

207
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,460
Hold on a second.
Where are you going?

208
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,765
What's wrong?

209
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,138
Well, l guess
it just hit me.

210
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,348
You really are leaving
here, aren't you?

211
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,551
Of course, l'm leaving.
We're both gonna leave here.

212
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,086
Both of us, Alex?
Yeah.

213
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,422
We talked about this.

214
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,924
When l get to school,
l'm gonna find a place

215
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,392
and l'm gonna come
back and get you.

216
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,917
Well, what about Granny?

217
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,193
Granny?

218
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,600
Truth is, you're scared of
leaving this trailer park.

219
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,102
l'm not scared of leaving
this trailer park, Alex.

220
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,163
Hey. Listen.

221
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,470
Whatever happens, it's
you and me forever, right?

222
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,375
Right?

223
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,043
l love you so much, Alex.

224
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,211
l'll always love you, Maggs.

225
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,191
Diarrhea.

226
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,007
Maggie! Maggie!

227
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:58,516
Alex, l got to go in.
Good night.

228
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,452
Good night.
Good night.

229
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,267
Someday they're gonna say,
"This is where it all began."

230
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,043
What?

231
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,342
Mom, l finally broke
the Starfighter record.

232
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,440
Oh, that's nice, dear.

233
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,218
Nice? lt's stupendous!

234
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,553
Uh, Alex,

235
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,623
Mr. Brenner knew that you'd want
to see this as soon as possible,

236
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,326
so he brought it
by the diner and...

237
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,962
Well, l was so excited,
l opened it.

238
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,864
Oh, that's okay.
What is it?

239
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,662
lt's about your loan.

240
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,798
You can still go to City
College with your friends.

241
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,551
Greetings, Starfighter.

242
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,223
Greetings, Starfighter.

243
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,126
You have been recruited by the
Star League to defend the Frontier.

244
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,361
You have been recruited...

245
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,562
Greetings, Starfighter.

246
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,962
You have been recruited...

247
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,123
You have been recruited...

248
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,526
You have been recruited...

249
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,407
Get ready.
Prepare for blastoff.

250
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,817
Hello. Excuse me, son.

251
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,757
Store's closed, mister.

252
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,493
l'm not here for cigarettes
or bubble gum, my boy.

253
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,895
Can you tell me
the name of the person

254
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,630
who broke the record
on that game over there?

255
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,565
Where l might find him?

256
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:05,071
Alex Rogan.
You're looking at him.

257
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,365
Alex Rogan. Aha!

258
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,309
Who are you?
Centauri's the name.

259
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,711
l invented Starfighter,
which is why l'm here.

260
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,146
lt is?
lt is.

261
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,782
We have to talk about a
matter of utmost importance.

262
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,551
Step into my office.

263
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,952
That's it. Come on now.

264
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,690
Nothing to be afraid of.

265
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,461
Oh, yes. Say hello
to my assistant, Beta.

266
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,628
Howdy.

267
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,461
Ow!

268
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,005
l must congratulate you on your
virtuoso performance, my boy.

269
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,372
Centauri is impressed.

270
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,975
l've seen them come
and l've seen them go.

271
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,177
But you're the best, my boy.
Dazzling.

272
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,169
Light years ahead
of the competition.

273
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,339
Which is why
Centauri is here.

274
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,018
He's got a little
proposition for you.

275
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,282
Are you interested?

276
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,953
l guess.

277
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,953
Hey!

278
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,600
What are you doing?

279
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,734
Listen.

280
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,569
Centauri wants to
keep it for a surprise.

281
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,234
Trust me. Oh, you're
gonna love it. Love it!

282
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,983
The amusing thing about this,
it's all a big mistake.

283
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,651
That particular
Starfighter game

284
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,653
was supposed to be
delivered to Vegas,

285
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,622
not some flea-speck
trailer park

286
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,690
in the middle of tumbleweeds
and tarantulas.

287
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,760
So, it must be fate,
destiny, blind chance,

288
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,525
luck, even,
that brings us together.

289
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,392
And as the poet says,
"The rest is history."

290
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,145
Where are you going?
Where are you taking me?

291
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,081
l told you. l wanna
save it for a surprise.

292
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:01,986
Hey. Are you the kind of kid who
reads the last page of a mystery first?

293
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,455
Who pesters the magician
to tell you his tricks?

294
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,125
Who sneaks downstairs to peek
at his Christmas presents?

295
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,460
No. Of course you're not!

296
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,260
That's why
l'm not gonna tell you.

297
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,589
Oh, God.

298
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,701
Besides, l just love
surprises, don't you?

299
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,297
Hey, look out!

300
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,775
Stop!
Oh, dear!

301
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,539
Hit the brakes! Hey...

302
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,272
CENTAURl: Shifting into
star drive at Columba Zeta.

303
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:28,968
Hold tight.

304
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,294
Hey.
Hey, let me out of here!

305
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,699
There's a perfectly logical
explanation for all this.

306
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,727
Hey! Wait!
Where you going?

307
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,606
Hi! How are you?
What is this?

308
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,880
Listen. Do you speak
English? l'd...

309
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,151
This is nice but...

310
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,233
Centauri,
what's going on here?

311
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,502
He's just saying how delighted
he is that you're here.

312
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:18,703
And if there's
anything he can do

313
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,705
to make your stay more
enjoyable, just give him a ring.

314
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:24,075
My stay? What are you
talking about? Where are we?

315
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,101
Welcome to Rylos, my boy!

316
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,373
Rylos?

317
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,415
Wait a minute. You mean...
You mean like in a game?

318
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,451
Oh, he's quick.
He's quick. He's very quick.

319
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:36,654
He's speechless.
So long, Alex! Have fun!

320
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:40,057
May the luck of the Seven Pillars
of Gulu be with you at all times.

321
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,661
Oh, someday these cheapskates
will thank Centauri. Trust me.

322
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,267
Where the hell is June?

323
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,737
Yolanda, baby!

324
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:09,818
Hi, Maggs.

325
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,188
Hi, Louis.

326
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,225
ls he up?

327
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:18,254
Yeah. He's been up
all night moaning.

328
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,433
Alex?

329
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,965
Your mother told me
about the loan.

330
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,603
ls there anything l can do?

331
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,620
Listen. l'll be next door
if you need anything, okay?

332
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:01,558
Gunstars.

333
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,466
l got to be dreaming.

334
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,442
Yeah, right.

335
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,719
Listen, there's been
a big mistake.

336
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,688
...immediately
after situation report.

337
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:24,855
Navigation...

338
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,291
Welcome to
Starfighter Command.

339
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,426
You speak English?

340
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,228
No. You hear English, thanks
to your translator device.

341
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,897
Hurry up.
We haven't got much time.

342
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,923
The briefing
begins immediately.

343
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,201
Join the other recruits.

344
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,000
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

345
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,205
Wait a minute! What are
you talking about, recruits?

346
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,206
l don't believe this.

347
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:53,651
Attention. Attention, please.
Ambassador Enduran has arrived

348
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,951
and will now address
Starfighter Command personnel.

349
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:03,861
As you all know, we have
been on a desperate quest...

350
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,696
Excuse me. Excuse me.

351
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,897
...to find
Starfighters and navigators.

352
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:14,329
l should... l should
crush you to gorun dust!

353
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,975
l'm sorry...
lt was an accident.

354
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,501
l didn't mean to
step on your...

355
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,746
Whatever that is.

356
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:22,913
Hideous creature.

357
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,405
lf l may continue.

358
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,951
Our forces have...

359
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,519
You don't trifle
with a Bogati.

360
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,020
They love to fight.

361
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,217
That's why they're
perfect for this war.

362
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,292
Did you say "war"?

363
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,394
But of course!

364
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,696
Why else do you
think you're here?

365
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,798
You were recruited by the
Star League to defend...

366
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,565
"...to defend the Frontier
against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada."

367
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:52,476
Eons ago, our ancestors
created our great Frontier,

368
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,812
a barrier of energy

369
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,976
encircling the peaceful
systems of the universe,

370
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,882
and forever shutting out
the scourge that lurks beyond.

371
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:09,760
Fellow Rylans,
because of a dark betrayal,

372
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,796
our Frontier
will soon collapse.

373
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:19,637
So we turn to you, Starfighters
and your navigators.

374
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,340
For of all the billions of
creatures in the Star League,

375
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,834
only you few were
found to possess the

376
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,107
gift.

377
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,819
You, and you alone,

378
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,551
stand between us and the
black terror of the Ko-Dan.

379
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:42,554
Victory or death!

380
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,461
Victory or death!

381
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,565
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

382
00:32:47,566 --> 00:33:05,143
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

383
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,752
Now, Starfighters, if you will
reach underneath your seats,

384
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,212
you will find a packet
which contains one hand...

385
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,064
This is a restricted area,
off-limits to...

386
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,935
My apologies, Starfighter.

387
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,372
Star Navigator First Class
Grig at your service, sir!

388
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,378
Hi. l'm Alex Rogan. l was
playing this game back home,

389
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,579
and this guy
came up to me.

390
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,515
Only he's not a guy.
He's an alien, right?

391
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,317
And l get into his car. Only
it's not a car. lt's a spaceship.

392
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,821
And, there's been
a big mistake.

393
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,789
Am l to understand
you're actually declining

394
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,158
the honor of becoming
a Starfighter?

395
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,560
You got it.

396
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:50,926
Extraordinary!

397
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,696
For eons, all creatures have
dreamt of being Starfighters.

398
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,269
Where you from?
Earth.

399
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,539
And we're not at war with
anybody, except each other.

400
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,309
Earth? Earth isn't a formal
member of the Star League,

401
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,678
and isn't due to be
approached until it matures.

402
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,614
This is all
highly irregular.

403
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,017
Tell me.
Who recruited you?

404
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:14,246
Centauri.

405
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,120
There he is.
That's him!

406
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,556
Centauri.
l might have known.

407
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,926
Up to your old Excalibur
tricks again, eh, Centauri?

408
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,633
Did it ever occur to you
that it is against the law

409
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,336
to recruit from worlds
outside the Star League?

410
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,430
Earth's in danger,
too, isn't it?

411
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,740
And, no, l did not
use the Excalibur test.

412
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,442
lt was called
a video game.

413
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,077
What's all the brouhaha?

414
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,947
After all,
he does have the gift!

415
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,416
This may come as
a bit of a shock to you,

416
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,749
but he doesn't want
to be a Starfighter.

417
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,689
Doesn't want to be a...
Are you a coward?

418
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,756
Are you crazy?

419
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,350
You didn't tell me
about any of this!

420
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,127
Return the money, Centauri!

421
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,464
Return the money?
Are you delirious?

422
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,533
Do you know how long
it took to invent the games,

423
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:03,734
to merchandise them,

424
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,534
to get them into
the stores by Christmas?

425
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,139
lt must be terribly
embarrassing for you,

426
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,141
and l do sympathize.
However...

427
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,710
But l saw him fight!

428
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,545
He could be the greatest
Starfighter ever!

429
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,380
That was a game, Centauri.

430
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:17,514
A game?

431
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,719
You may have thought it was a
game, but it was also a test.

432
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,487
Aha! A test!

433
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:28,058
Sent out across the universe to find
those with the gift to be Starfighters.

434
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,061
And here you are, my boy.
Here you are!

435
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,830
Right! Here l am,
about to be killed!

436
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:33,931
Killed.

437
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,003
You don't seriously think
it's dangerous, do you?

438
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,438
Don't be silly! Trust me!

439
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,817
Xur!

440
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,650
Xur!

441
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,157
Xur?

442
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:11,794
Yes, Father, your mighty Frontier
grows weaker by the moment.

443
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,840
Do not call me father!

444
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,043
You are no longer my son!

445
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:22,343
You're an outcast!
Why have you returned?

446
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,783
l have returned for
the good of all Rylans.

447
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:29,253
With an armada of Ko-Dan
warships behind you?

448
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,890
There are some Rylans
who would welcome me, Father.

449
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,794
Star League justice
put down your Xurian cult.

450
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:39,229
Your followers are
few and scattered.

451
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,432
Star League?

452
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:45,002
A refuge for weak worlds
not worthy to be our equals!

453
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,538
That is for the Rylans
to decide,

454
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,498
and not for a dangerous and
evil child such as yourself.

455
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,978
And yet, it is this child
who caught your master spy.

456
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,206
Hear me, Rylans!

457
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:36,350
When the green moon of Galan is
eclipsed, Ko-Dan Armada will invade,

458
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:42,793
and not even your mighty
Starfighters will be able to save you.

459
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:46,230
We shall see, Xur.
We shall see!

460
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,844
You still want to go?

461
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,404
And miss all the excitement?

462
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,553
Little brat.

463
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,955
l invent the game, find
the kid, drag him up there,

464
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,458
and he doesn't want
to be a Starfighter.

465
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,892
l give up!

466
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:56,459
Control, do you copy our star
angle difference from parking angle?

467
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:02,232
Delta beta two at six,
delta gamma three at five.

468
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,804
Emperor Xur ordered me
to bring his scepter.

469
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,551
Let him enter.

470
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,021
Target vector
remains on scope.

471
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,239
Just like your Ko-Dan emperor's,
isn't it, Commander Kril?

472
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:41,475
lt takes more than a scepter
to rule, Xur, even on Rylos.

473
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,910
You're right, Kril.

474
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,244
lt does take
more than a scepter.

475
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,499
How long must we
endure this fool?

476
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,402
We have a break
in the Frontier.

477
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,167
Fire the meteor gun!

478
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:13,010
My dear Ko-Dan friends!
Lest we forget,

479
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:16,947
it was your own emperor who
granted me command of this Armada.

480
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,849
For only l hold
the secret to the Frontier.

481
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,353
Only l know the location
of the Starfighter base.

482
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:27,052
And therefore, only l will
give the order to fire!

483
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,194
Forgive me, Xur.

484
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,105
You are forgiven,
Commander Kril.

485
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:49,135
Meteor gunner...fire.

486
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,477
Sergeant!

487
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:29,649
l have an unidentified incoming
object in Sector 31, sir.

488
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,593
They're headed for
the base! Alert!

489
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:37,861
We are under attack!

490
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,229
l repeat,
we are under attack!

491
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,768
Activate automatic
repulser guns.

492
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,984
Condition Red! Condition Red!

493
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,934
At last, it is done!

494
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,734
Soon the Frontier
will be down

495
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,137
and they will bow
to their new emperor!

496
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,844
Or l will darken
the sky with their ashes.

497
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,813
Commander,
the Xurian spy reports

498
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,748
that one Starfighter
has escaped.

499
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,015
Escaped?

500
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,264
You sure l can't
give you a hand?

501
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,400
You've done quite enough
already. Thank you.

502
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:24,561
Well...

503
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,371
lt's only a few more
miles from here. l guess...

504
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,440
l guess l can walk it.

505
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,638
So long!
Bye, Centauri!

506
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,620
Oh, Alex!

507
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:50,686
Here!

508
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,267
Hey, listen. l can't take
a present from you, Centauri.

509
00:43:58,503 --> 00:43:59,870
He reduces me
to poverty again

510
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,538
and he thinks l'm
giving him a present.

511
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:02,768
What a world this is.

512
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:04,241
What is it, then?

513
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,243
lt's a second chance,
my boy!

514
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:09,611
lf you change your mind,
just tap the communo-crystals.

515
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:16,720
Keep it.
Alex, Alex!

516
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,723
You're walking away
from history. History!

517
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:23,293
Did Chris Columbus say
he wanted to stay home? No!

518
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:25,996
What if the Wright Brothers
thought that only birds should fly?

519
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,866
And did Geloca think the Yulus
were too ugly to save?

520
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,335
Who's Geloca?

521
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:34,569
Never mind.

522
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:37,574
Listen, Centauri.
l'm not any of those guys.

523
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,142
l'm a kid from
a trailer park.

524
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,773
lf that's what you think,
then that's all you'll ever be!

525
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:14,944
Hey, Maggie!

526
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,682
Listen to this. You're
not going to believe this.

527
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:20,750
l told you, Alex.

528
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:21,885
Me and my...
How did you put it?

529
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:25,322
"Strange sexual urges,"
aren't talking to you anymore.

530
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,297
Who's there!

531
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,596
Shh! You're gonna
wake up Louis.

532
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,274
Hey, you look like me!

533
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,243
Of course l do.
l'm the beta unit.

534
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,476
What the hell's
a beta unit?

535
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:31,847
A beta unit is a simuloid, an exact
duplicate of you, only not as loud.

536
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,457
Huh?

537
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,792
l was in the starcar,
remember?

538
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,127
We shook hands?

539
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,528
l became you, unfortunately.

540
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:43,630
Let me get this straight.
You're a robot?

541
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,893
l beg your pardon.

542
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:50,407
l'm a state-of-the-art,
top-of-the-line beta unit,

543
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:54,144
put here as a courtesy
replacement for while you're away.

544
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,012
Lucky me.

545
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:57,947
Wait a minute.
What are you doing back?

546
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,716
Are you kidding?
lt's war up there!

547
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:02,778
Oh. Save the whales
and not the universe, huh?

548
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,455
Well, why don't you
go up there and fight?

549
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:08,058
Simuloids can't fight.
We're not allowed.

550
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,459
Well, tell them that
you're me! Pretend!

551
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,096
Be quiet, Alex.

552
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:14,758
Sorry, Louis.

553
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,233
Thanks for the lift!

554
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,634
Sure thing, buddy.
See you around!

555
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,193
Greetings, Starfighter.

556
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,628
You have been recruited
by the Star League

557
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,928
to defend the Frontier
against Yur and...

558
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,320
And, hey,
what did you do to Maggie?

559
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:11,821
Do to her?

560
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,323
We're sitting outside,
looking at the stars,

561
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,349
and she sticks her
tongue in my ear.

562
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,962
l screamed. l'll
apologize tomorrow, okay?

563
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,463
You're not gonna be here.

564
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,194
You're going back
with Centauri right now!

565
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,700
What's up, Alex?

566
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:26,796
Back to sleep, Louis, or l'm
telling Ma about your Playboys.

567
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,368
You're blowing it, Alex!

568
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,313
What the shit?

569
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,546
l said, back to sleep, Louis, or
l'm telling Ma about your Playboys!

570
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,348
Come in, Centauri.

571
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,423
Come on. Get back here.

572
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,187
And take your
Tonka toy with you.

573
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,894
Greetings, Starfighter.

574
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:54,264
You have been recruited by the
Star League to defend the Frontier

575
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,995
against Yur and
the Ko-Dan Armada.

576
00:48:57,902 --> 00:48:59,669
Greetings, Starfighter.

577
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,137
You have been
recruited by the Star League

578
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,539
to defend the Frontier
against Yur...

579
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,914
Where are you?
Come on, where are you?

580
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:12,246
Centauri?

581
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:15,117
Greetings, Starfighter!

582
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,617
Centauri?

583
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,284
Oh, shit!

584
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:23,119
Come on, Alex.
Don't be such a wimp!

585
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:42,038
Centauri, look out!

586
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,200
What the...

587
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,125
Phew!

588
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:14,100
Foul stench.
Dirty creatures.

589
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:20,376
Get a good look, Alex.

590
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:23,613
You can bet your asteroids
you'll be seeing more of them.

591
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:24,881
What?

592
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:26,315
This is a Zando-Zan.

593
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:29,676
An interstellar hitbeast,
compliments of Xur.

594
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,889
Xur? Why is he after me?

595
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,224
Somehow he found out
you're a Starfighter.

596
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:38,928
So you see, Alex, you got to
go back. You got no choice.

597
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,897
'Cause if you stay down here,
you're dog food.

598
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:42,632
Trust Centauri, my boy.

599
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:46,903
Because in two hours, this place
will be crawling with 10 Zando-Zans

600
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:50,907
with just one thought on
their microscopic little minds,

601
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:52,575
kill Alex Rogan.

602
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,210
Kill Alex Rogan.

603
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,712
He's right, Alex.

604
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:58,448
At least up there you'll have
a fighting chance in a Gunstar.

605
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,616
Exactly.

606
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,685
Meanwhile, down here,
they'll be going after Beta.

607
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,287
Beta.
Beta?

608
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,289
Of course. What do you
think he's here for?

609
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,158
Wait a...
Wait a second here, Centauri.

610
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,460
Alex, look out!

611
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,701
Centauri!

612
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:22,138
Beta, get a doctor!

613
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,574
No. No native cures.
No witch doctors.

614
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,307
l'm fine. Just a scratch.

615
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,739
Now face it, Alex.
You're a born Starfighter.

616
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:37,946
Are you with me?

617
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,622
Okay, let's go, Centauri.

618
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,528
Good luck, Alex.

619
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,371
You, too, Alex.

620
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,897
Centauri to
Starfighter Command.

621
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:26,402
Centauri to
Starfighter Command.

622
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,962
Come in, please.

623
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,279
Hey, Centauri.

624
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,227
Attention all personnel.

625
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,390
Starcar is approaching
Docking Bay 12.

626
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,097
Centauri! Centauri!

627
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,037
Hey, hit the brakes!

628
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,748
Grig! Hey, Grig!
Alex!

629
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,750
They got Centauri.
He's hurt!

630
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,412
He's right over here.

631
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:29,190
Ah, you see?

632
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:32,201
Centauri brought him back!

633
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,034
Yes, l see.
Don't talk.

634
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:36,939
Does he have my money, Alex?

635
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,569
l have a fortune
for you, Centauri.

636
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:41,511
Now, please be still.

637
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:46,042
lt's here. lt's all here.
Piles and piles of it.

638
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:48,584
All for you.

639
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:50,887
Ah...

640
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,252
At last.

641
00:54:55,692 --> 00:55:01,222
Alex, l want you know, it was for
the greatest good l brought you back.

642
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:07,202
Of course, it...

643
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,170
lt never hurts to be rich.

644
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:24,179
Until the next dimension,
old friend.

645
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,419
l'm sorry, Alex.

646
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:30,423
Centauri?

647
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,464
Centauri?

648
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,036
The Frontier could
collapse at any moment.

649
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,273
Alex!

650
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:44,528
Now l need an earjob.
Dying here. Dying.

651
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:03,219
Alex, what the hell's
going on?

652
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,417
Louis, you're having
a terrible nightmare.

653
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:08,350
Go back to sleep.

654
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,395
Louis!

655
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,568
Oh, no.

656
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:43,326
Am l to understand there's a beta
unit taking your place back home?

657
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,427
He's trying.

658
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:47,596
So it's safe to assume that Xur
thinks you're still on Earth.

659
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,465
Yeah.

660
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,197
That could work to our
advantage, theoretically.

661
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,576
Ah! Now you look human!

662
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:05,614
ls this my Gunstar?

663
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,150
This is a prototype,
different from the other ships.

664
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,019
She has a greater range,
more power,

665
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,148
and a slight
weapons modification.

666
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:15,124
And, of course,
she's got deflective plating,

667
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,560
so she can withstand
several direct hits.

668
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:25,201
From here, this is
where l navigate the ship,

669
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:28,194
maintain life support
and propulsion systems.

670
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,940
Okay. Where do l sit?

671
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,467
Way up there,
in the gunnery chair.

672
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,013
Hang on!

673
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,038
Okay.

674
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:47,052
Now, climb into
the gunnery chair.

675
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:51,955
Now, l'm moving you
into launch position.

676
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,364
There in front of you
are the two switches

677
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,663
for your heads-up display.
Turn them on.

678
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,439
While you're engaging
the enemy,

679
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,069
the screen will reflect all
battle instruments towards you.

680
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,079
Hey, where did it go?

681
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,748
lt's still there,
suspended in a xenon mist.

682
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:14,750
But it's only visible
if you look dead ahead.

683
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,720
Ah. Got it.

684
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,921
The lever on your left
is the chair controller.

685
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,222
As you can see, all guns will
track with your every move.

686
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:33,169
Grasp the target control
with your right hand.

687
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,806
At your fingers is the weaponry,
the lasers, photon bolts...

688
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:38,040
Photon bolts and
the particle beams.

689
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,702
Wait a minute.
This is just like back home.

690
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,777
What's this?
Careful, careful,

691
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:45,147
that's Death Blossom,
a weapon of last resort.

692
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:48,384
Luckily, l was in here working
on it when the hangar went up.

693
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:51,445
Now, are you ready?
All systems, go!

694
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:54,854
lgnition!

695
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:00,763
When did the hangar go up?

696
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,699
l told you,
when Xur attacked.

697
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:05,134
And where were
the Starfighters?

698
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:06,335
ln the hangar!

699
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,104
You mean they're dead?

700
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,164
Death is a primitive concept.

701
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:16,045
l prefer to think of them as
battling evil in another dimension.

702
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:18,814
ln another dimension?
How many are left?

703
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,044
lncluding yourself?

704
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:21,746
Yeah.

705
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,282
One!

706
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,413
One?

707
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:38,998
Hold it.

708
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:44,707
There's no fleet, no
Starfighters, no plan?

709
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:47,142
One ship, you, me,
and that's it? Exactly!

710
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,344
Xur thinks
you're still on Earth.

711
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:50,546
Classic military strategy.
Surprise attack.

712
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:51,814
lt'll be a slaughter!

713
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,282
That's the spirit.

714
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:54,783
No, my slaughter.

715
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:56,785
One ship against
the whole Armada?

716
01:00:56,786 --> 01:01:00,222
Yes. One Gunstar
against the Armada.

717
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:05,059
l've always wanted to fight a desperate
battle against incredible odds.

718
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:09,098
Target lights, Alex.

719
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:10,299
Target lights?

720
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,101
Yes. You might want
to squeeze off

721
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,836
a few rounds while
you have the chance.

722
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,938
Just work the bugs
out of the system.

723
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:18,067
After all,
it is her maiden voyage.

724
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,764
Steady.
Don't fight the chair.

725
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:43,699
Take your time.
Watch your gun sights.

726
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,601
Lead your targets.

727
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:47,934
And above all, relax!

728
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:51,740
Terrific. l'm about to get killed
a million miles from nowhere

729
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:54,711
with a gung-ho iguana
who tells me, "Relax."

730
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,371
lnterstellar!

731
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,410
Alex!

732
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,346
Sorry.

733
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,821
Okay, now, come on.
Ease it up.

734
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:43,920
Okay.

735
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:48,324
Oh, that's...
That's it. Easy.

736
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,663
Nice and easy. Yep.

737
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:54,803
A little bit more and
we'll get it in there, now.

738
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,099
Alex!

739
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,844
Sorry. Hi, Maggs.

740
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:03,112
Alex, are you all right?

741
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,377
Yeah. Yeah, l'm... l'm fine.

742
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,352
Come on. Try it again.

743
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,753
Did you smell anything?

744
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:15,482
Like what?

745
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,717
Like a Z...

746
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:19,159
Forget it.

747
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:30,869
l just wanted to say l'm sorry
for slapping you last night.

748
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:34,977
Oh, that's okay, Maggs.
l deserved it.

749
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,707
l'm sorry.

750
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:41,043
Well, maybe we can make it up to
each other tonight at Silver Lake?

751
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,815
The Armada will break
through the Frontier here,

752
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:15,317
and reach Rylos in 20 klicks.

753
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,153
Squadrons of deck fighters
will precede the mother ship.

754
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,055
Squadrons?
How many squadrons?

755
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,357
lt isn't the number of
squadrons that concerns me.

756
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,293
lt's this communication
turret that sends out

757
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:25,894
the commands to
the deck fighters,

758
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,197
which enables them to act
as one during the fight.

759
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,966
Wait a second. We knock out
the turret to get the fighters.

760
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,569
But to get the turret, we have
to get through the fighters.

761
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,003
We're dead.

762
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,940
l'll have it all figured out by
the time we reach the Frontier.

763
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,211
What's that?

764
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,270
The Frontier.

765
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:54,723
Now, that's strange.
What's a cargo ship

766
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,522
doing this close
to the Frontier?

767
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:00,123
Hail.
This is Gunstar One.

768
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:06,735
l repeat,
this is Gunstar One.

769
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,898
ldentify yourself, please.

770
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,699
Alex, look out.

771
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:17,313
A Xurian ship!

772
01:05:19,983 --> 01:05:21,216
Congratulations, Alex.

773
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,914
This is your
first live target.

774
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,315
Live?

775
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:31,824
Within range in five klicks.
Get ready!

776
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:38,367
l've blocked its
beam of frequency,

777
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:40,336
so it can't report
back to the Armada.

778
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:43,601
Fire when ready!
Grig, wait!

779
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:56,248
We mustn't lose them in
these caves, Alex! Fire!

780
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:20,976
Shoot, Alex!

781
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:28,449
Shoot!

782
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,326
You did it!

783
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,935
l did it? You did it!

784
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:48,302
You almost got me killed!

785
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,603
My deepest apologies, Alex.

786
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:56,812
l had hoped that by putting
you in the thick of battle,

787
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:59,248
a great Starfighter
would emerge.

788
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:04,683
But, alas. Perhaps there was
never one within you to begin with.

789
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,122
l shall take you home.

790
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,885
You still may live a long
and fruitful life back there.

791
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:17,998
That is, until the
Ko-Dan reach Earth.

792
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,402
But then again...

793
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:38,654
Hey, yo, Blake! Make
that sucker blast, man!

794
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:41,423
You got it, dude!
All right!

795
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:50,198
So Blake comes back in
to grab his pants, right?

796
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,034
Sees her old lady,
and says,

797
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:55,095
"l hope this doesn't rule out
dinner on Tuesday night."

798
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,431
That's my man!

799
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,804
Alex, are you okay?

800
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:06,048
Hmm?

801
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:08,245
Yeah, sure. Why?

802
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:12,521
l don't know. You're
just acting spaced out.

803
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:13,989
You're...
You're not yourself.

804
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:21,056
Well, if you were me, what
would you be doing right now?

805
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:28,270
Well, for one thing, l'd
be trying to enjoy myself.

806
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:32,274
Leaning back.
Kidding around. Laughing.

807
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,542
Laughing?

808
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:34,908
Well, it's a start, Alex.

809
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:37,143
Laughing.

810
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:25,360
Nice place.
Reminds me of home.

811
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,229
This reminds you of home?

812
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:28,925
Oh, yes.

813
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:40,669
l live below ground with my
wifeoid and 6,000 little Griglings.

814
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:51,682
At least, until Xur
turns them into slaves.

815
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:59,257
Where does your kind live?

816
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,694
Oh, uh, houses, mostly.

817
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:06,061
That's caves above ground.
See, here.

818
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:09,400
Here's my family.

819
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:11,496
See, that's...

820
01:10:12,108 --> 01:10:16,170
That's my folks and my brother,
Louis, and that's Maggie.

821
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,508
Uh, we live in a mobile home.

822
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:24,685
That's a cave
that goes places.

823
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,149
Only we never went anyplace.

824
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:33,995
A mobile cave that never
went anywhere. Fascinating.

825
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,466
Yeah, but we have below-ground
caves near the trailer parks.

826
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:40,869
Me and my brother, Louis, used
to play hide-and-seek in them.

827
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,073
Hide-and-seek.

828
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,141
What is it, Alex?

829
01:10:46,142 --> 01:10:49,845
Well, l was just thinking,
maybe we could hide here,

830
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:54,249
let the Armada pass by, and
then hit the turret from behind.

831
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,810
Then we might take
them by surprise.

832
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:04,292
Your plan might
really have worked.

833
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:08,263
What a pity there are no
Starfighters left to carry it out.

834
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,595
Yeah. Yeah.

835
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:20,200
A Xurian base!

836
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,356
Two more dead ahead!
Closing fast!

837
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:08,883
Earth course is logged
into navigational beams.

838
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,752
Grig?

839
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:15,155
What is it, Alex?

840
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,538
Maybe there is
a Starfighter left.

841
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:02,672
Ow!

842
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,886
What's wrong?

843
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,480
Should l put my tongue
in your ear now?

844
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:15,652
Don't bother, Alex.

845
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:17,425
Well, it's just...

846
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,122
l'm kind of new at
these gland games.

847
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,797
What are you talking about?

848
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:25,734
lt's like you're
a million miles away, Alex!

849
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,004
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Darling.

850
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:41,345
Darling, forgive me.

851
01:13:50,493 --> 01:13:52,325
"Darling, forgive me."

852
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:57,897
Come on!

853
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,336
You're my Juliet. My Venus.

854
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:09,435
"You're my Juliet. My Venus."

855
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,149
Alex!

856
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,118
All the other girls
meant nothing to me.

857
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,954
lt was you, you, you.

858
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,223
Shut up and
talk dirty to me.

859
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:29,158
"The other girls meant nothing
to me. lt was you, you..."

860
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,734
Should l talk
dirty to you now?

861
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,236
That does it.

862
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:38,207
Oh, God.
All right. l give up.

863
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,375
l'm not Alex Rogan.

864
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:41,943
What?

865
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:43,144
l'm a beta unit.

866
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,408
l'm an exact
duplicate of Alex.

867
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,914
He's up there
saving the universe,

868
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,712
while l'm down here
for target practice.

869
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:51,681
See?

870
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,530
Alex! Or whatever
you are. Wait. Wait.

871
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:03,631
What are you do...
Let me go.

872
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:04,699
lf that Zando-Zan
reports back

873
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,901
that l'm not Alex,
Alex is in big trouble!

874
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,236
You're staying here.
No, l'm not.

875
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,831
l'm not staying anywhere until
l find out what's going on!

876
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:16,074
Hey, my truck!
Hey, hey, come back!

877
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:20,678
Scratch that paint,
and you're dead, Rogan!

878
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,494
Ready to invade, Commander.

879
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:33,595
lnvade.

880
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:36,765
Commander, the Xurian ships have
not answered our invasion code.

881
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:39,200
The Frontier is down,
the moon is eclipsed,

882
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,534
the Starfighters are dead.
lnvade!

883
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:46,340
All squadrons ahead, half
speed, with energy probes on.

884
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:19,805
Energy probe.
Shut down, Alex. Shut down.

885
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:22,374
Power off.

886
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:41,325
Alex? ln space?

887
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:46,634
ls this for real? Yes! That's
what l'm trying to tell you!

888
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:47,936
lt's all for real!

889
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,530
Well, then, don't talk.
Drive!

890
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:05,987
Commander Kril, we're getting
a signal on the alert frequency.

891
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:07,388
Acknowledge.

892
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:12,494
There it is.
All right.

893
01:17:12,495 --> 01:17:14,462
Now, when l give the signal,
we're gonna jump! Okay?

894
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,397
What do you mean, "Jump"?
We're gonna ram him.

895
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:17,388
What?

896
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:21,202
Extermination Emissary
Zeta 6, one message.

897
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,171
Ready? Jump!

898
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:24,606
Alex!

899
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,142
"The last Starfighter..."

900
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:32,012
You owe me one, Alex.

901
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:39,514
Alex!

902
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:44,559
Transmission pulsars
have stopped, Commander.

903
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,461
The last Starfighter...

904
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:48,123
ls dead!

905
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:51,530
The last Starfighter is dead!

906
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:55,203
Nothing can stop us now.
Ahead full.

907
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:57,138
To Rylos!

908
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:18,750
The command ship!

909
01:18:23,566 --> 01:18:26,035
There!
The turret at the far end!

910
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,032
l see it.

911
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:33,607
Good luck, Starfighter.

912
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,608
Thanks, Grig.
For everything.

913
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,091
l love you, Alex Rogan.

914
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:54,858
Six.

915
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:57,365
Heads-up display. Check.

916
01:18:57,366 --> 01:18:58,499
Five.

917
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,401
Lasers. Check.

918
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,104
Four.
Particle beam. Check.

919
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:04,872
Three.
Proton bolts. Check.

920
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:07,408
Two.
Chair control. Check.

921
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,934
One.

922
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,303
Let's do it.

923
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:23,783
Tracking alert.

924
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,421
Unidentified craft.
What is it?

925
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:35,736
Wait.

926
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,339
Gunstar!

927
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:42,039
So, the last Starfighter
is dead?

928
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:46,614
This has gone far enough.
Seize him!

929
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:51,085
How dare you?
l am the Emperor of Rylos!

930
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:54,088
l and l alone
command this entire op...

931
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,724
Release me! l command you!

932
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:59,490
You will pay for this
with your lives!

933
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,895
All guns fire!

934
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:13,974
There it is, the turret!

935
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:15,977
Alex, now!

936
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:19,213
Yeah!

937
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:20,238
Got it!

938
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,084
Hurry, Alex! Fire!

939
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:24,575
The Armada's almost to Rylos!

940
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,275
Escape pod activated.

941
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,776
Escape pod ignition.

942
01:20:51,714 --> 01:20:53,648
The Gunstar is gone
from our sensors.

943
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:55,446
Alert wing commanders.

944
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:58,348
Communication turret
is destroyed.

945
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:07,019
All communication radar
systems are out, Wing Commander.

946
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:10,224
Proceed with
a visual attack formation.

947
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:18,039
Life support good.
Ammo packs at peak.

948
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,841
l think we've got
to use Death Blossom.

949
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:21,509
Remember,
Death Blossom delivers

950
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,740
only one massive volley
at close range.

951
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,013
Theoretically.

952
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:27,482
What do you mean,
"Theoretically"?

953
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:29,650
After all, D.B.
has never been tested.

954
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:32,387
lt might overload the systems.
Blow up the ship.

955
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,554
What are you worried about,
Grig?

956
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,356
Theoretically,
we should already be dead.

957
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:36,620
Mmm-hmm.

958
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:40,223
Open Death Blossom petals.
Switch is on.

959
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:57,405
Do not trigger D.B.
until we're within range.

960
01:21:57,546 --> 01:22:00,248
Just use your lasers
until l give the signal.

961
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,382
Remember to lead...

962
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:02,884
l've been recruited
by the Star League

963
01:22:02,885 --> 01:22:04,652
to defend the Frontier.

964
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:05,753
Now, are you ready?

965
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,382
This is it. Here we go.

966
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:10,219
Charge!

967
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:41,145
On your right!

968
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,192
Your left!

969
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,726
Evade!

970
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:53,000
Power packs are low!
We need time to recharge!

971
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,135
Laser power draining!

972
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:08,916
Grig, my weapons are gone!
Should l do it?

973
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:09,984
Easy, easy.

974
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,817
Wait till they're all
in Death Blossom range!

975
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:22,895
Fire!

976
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:58,324
We did it.

977
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:00,560
Yes, we actually did,
didn't we?

978
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:06,035
The command ship!

979
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:07,909
Commander,
our guns are out.

980
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:09,644
Damage control
is repairing them.

981
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:13,103
Forget the guns!
Ramming speed!

982
01:24:21,924 --> 01:24:23,057
Grig, we need power!

983
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,890
Death Blossom's
drained all power.

984
01:24:25,127 --> 01:24:28,825
l'm working on it.
l'm trying to run boost.

985
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:35,099
All we have left is
life support power!

986
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:43,074
Grig!

987
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:50,615
All right!

988
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:01,958
Weapons on! We have
them now! Fire. Fire!

989
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,120
Damage report!

990
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:30,858
Guidance system out.
Auxiliary steering out.

991
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,293
Divert!

992
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:34,695
Divert!

993
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,197
She won't answer the helm!

994
01:25:36,198 --> 01:25:38,632
We're locked into the
moon's gravitational pull!

995
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,158
What do we do?

996
01:25:44,006 --> 01:25:45,172
We die.

997
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:10,164
On behalf of the Star League
and all citizens of Rylos,

998
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:13,434
l congratulate you on
your dazzling victory.

999
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:15,102
Thank you.
Thanks.

1000
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:18,539
But as you know,
the Frontier is down,

1001
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:21,075
Xur escaped,
and there is still danger.

1002
01:26:21,076 --> 01:26:24,278
So l was wondering if you
wouldn't be willing to stay on,

1003
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:26,814
and rebuild
the Starfighter Legion.

1004
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:28,340
Wait a minute.

1005
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:30,818
Rebuild the Legion?

1006
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:32,184
Yes.

1007
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:35,923
Of course, you'd have
the help of an old friend.

1008
01:26:37,092 --> 01:26:38,821
An old friend? Who?

1009
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:57,912
Centauri!
l thought you were dead!

1010
01:26:57,913 --> 01:27:01,482
Me die and miss all
the excitement? Oh, no.

1011
01:27:01,483 --> 01:27:04,118
l was merely dormant while
my body repaired itself.

1012
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:06,153
Now, l won't bore
you with details.

1013
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:09,023
Suffice it to say,
you're on Rylos, my boy.

1014
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:10,491
Stop thinking human.

1015
01:27:10,492 --> 01:27:12,093
That's lesson number one.

1016
01:27:12,094 --> 01:27:15,596
Now, lesson number two, you've
got a good thing going here.

1017
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:18,089
Keep smiling.
Don't blow it.

1018
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:22,063
Lesson number three,
always trust Centauri.

1019
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,941
CENTAURl: Alex, they love you!

1020
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:36,041
You see, all Rylos
is behind you.

1021
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,086
You've got to stay, Alex!

1022
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,122
You will stay, won't you?

1023
01:27:41,123 --> 01:27:42,623
CENTAURl:
Of course, he'll stay.

1024
01:27:43,892 --> 01:27:46,093
That's very reassuring,
Centauri.

1025
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,586
Grig, l leave it in
your capable hands.

1026
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,066
l'll stay.

1027
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:07,841
Alex! Alex!

1028
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:22,896
Greetings...

1029
01:28:24,266 --> 01:28:26,000
Greetings, Starfighter.

1030
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:27,468
Bunny, have you
seen Alex?

1031
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:28,869
Can't say that l have.

1032
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:32,173
Well, ask Maggie.
She knows where he is.

1033
01:28:32,174 --> 01:28:34,175
She was with him.

1034
01:28:34,176 --> 01:28:35,643
Maggie, where's Alex?

1035
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:38,312
Yeah, where's my truck?
Where's your boyfriend?

1036
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,015
Mrs. Rogan, about Alex,
you see, he's...

1037
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:46,585
What is it? What's
going on? l don't know.

1038
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,270
Oh, my God!

1039
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:15,580
All right!
We're being invaded!

1040
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,341
Maggie.

1041
01:29:45,447 --> 01:29:46,778
Maggie.

1042
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,138
Alex?

1043
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,440
Hi, Maggs.

1044
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:54,642
Alex,

1045
01:30:56,718 --> 01:30:57,818
is it you?

1046
01:30:57,819 --> 01:31:00,755
l mean, is it really you?

1047
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:06,719
Look!

1048
01:31:08,496 --> 01:31:09,725
My God.

1049
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:11,795
lt is you.

1050
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,935
lt's Alex! Alex!

1051
01:31:14,936 --> 01:31:16,570
Alex, what is going on here?

1052
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:18,105
What is this thing?

1053
01:31:26,548 --> 01:31:28,048
ls this your spaceship?

1054
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,710
l don't know
what's gotten into him.

1055
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:31,618
l don't understand that.

1056
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,153
lt's so strange!

1057
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,655
Wait. Hold it.
Hold it, everybody.

1058
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:37,682
Alex, what is all this?

1059
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:42,296
l've been to
another planet, Ma.

1060
01:31:42,297 --> 01:31:43,464
Another planet?

1061
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:46,767
Who was it helped
fix my antenna?

1062
01:31:46,768 --> 01:31:47,835
Yeah, who stole my truck?

1063
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:48,902
And cut my electric?

1064
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:51,004
And ruined my stove?

1065
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,340
Oh, that was...
That was a beta unit.

1066
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,475
Beta unit?

1067
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:55,542
A robot.

1068
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:56,944
Robot? What the...

1069
01:31:56,945 --> 01:31:58,245
Come on!

1070
01:31:58,246 --> 01:31:59,847
A monster!

1071
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,352
A monster!

1072
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,322
He got them chains on him.

1073
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:09,523
All right! lt's an alien!

1074
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,125
Oh, no, wait!
Hey, hey!

1075
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:13,227
Granny, put away that
shotgun. What's wrong with you?

1076
01:32:13,228 --> 01:32:14,695
This is my friend Grig.

1077
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:16,130
l want you all to
meet my friend here.

1078
01:32:16,131 --> 01:32:17,197
You got to be kidding!

1079
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:19,599
Grig, this is Mrs. Boone.

1080
01:32:21,336 --> 01:32:23,570
Hello.

1081
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:24,805
And this is Elvira.

1082
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:25,939
Delighted.

1083
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,374
Me, too. How you doing?

1084
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,642
l do well.

1085
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:30,010
And this is Granny.

1086
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:33,280
How do you do?

1087
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:34,815
And this here's Otis.

1088
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:36,283
A pleasure.

1089
01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:38,480
Any friend of Alex...

1090
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:41,553
And this is Maggie.

1091
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,692
A very large pleasure.

1092
01:32:45,427 --> 01:32:46,660
Hi.

1093
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:52,831
You must be Louis!

1094
01:32:55,603 --> 01:32:58,172
l hear good things
about you.

1095
01:32:58,173 --> 01:33:00,507
Hear that, you slimes?
l'm famous.

1096
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:05,578
And this is my mom.

1097
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,382
You should be proud
of Alex, Mrs. Rogan.

1098
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,253
You must all be
proud of him.

1099
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:17,157
He saved the Star League and
hundreds of worlds, including Earth.

1100
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,956
Oh, for heaven's sake!

1101
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:20,925
Oh, my God!

1102
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,865
Time to leave, Alex.

1103
01:33:24,866 --> 01:33:26,129
Alex?

1104
01:33:26,634 --> 01:33:27,868
l have to, Ma.

1105
01:33:27,869 --> 01:33:29,403
They need me up there.

1106
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:32,239
Oh, Alex, l always knew
you'd leave someday,

1107
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,141
but l never expected this.

1108
01:33:34,142 --> 01:33:36,410
Gee, can l go, too, Alex?
Can l?

1109
01:33:36,411 --> 01:33:39,112
Sorry, squirt. There's
only enough room up there

1110
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:41,776
for me, Grig,
and Maggie.

1111
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,112
Me?
Yeah.

1112
01:33:46,688 --> 01:33:49,056
Alex, l don't think l can...

1113
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:51,548
What? Come here.
Come here.

1114
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,194
Why else do you
think l came back?

1115
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:57,264
Well... Didn't we say
we'd always be together?

1116
01:33:57,265 --> 01:34:00,792
Well, yeah, l mean,
together here or in the city.

1117
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,070
But... But up there, Alex...

1118
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:04,605
Maggs, you got to come.
You see, l'm not...

1119
01:34:04,606 --> 01:34:06,573
l don't know when
l'm gonna be back.

1120
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:09,576
Don't you see? This is it.
This is our big chance.

1121
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,945
lt's like what Otis says,

1122
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:13,647
when it comes,
you got to grab on

1123
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,377
with both hands
and hold tight.

1124
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:20,684
Well, what about
Granny, Alex?

1125
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:28,592
You're right. l'm
scared of leaving here.

1126
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:31,498
Why can't you just stay?

1127
