My electric's gone out again, Clara!
I'm gonna miss my soaps!

- Oh, stop your yakking.
- Bill?

16
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,464
Bill, elvira's blacked out again.
Pass the word.

17
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,303
- Have a nice day, honey.
- Okay, thanks, Mrs. Boone. You, too.

18
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,844
Elvira's got no electric.

19
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,935
If she can't see her soaps,
she'll hyperventilate.

20
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,725
- Great day for a picnic, Maggie!
- Can't wait, Mr. Boone.

21
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,894
- Catch yourself a big one.
- Sure gonna try!

22
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,688
Granny, I fixed your lunch
and put it in the fridge.

23
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,982
- Have fun, child.
- Sure you're gonna be okay?

24
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,357
I'll be fine, dear.
Now you just run along. Bye!

25
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,789
- Hi, Mrs. rogan.
- Hi, Maggie.

26
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,125
- Did you find that picnic basket yet?
- Mm-hmm, it's in the living room.

27
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,165
Oh, thanks. Where's Alex?

28
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,880
- Where else?
- Right.

29
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,587
Louis!

30
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,092
Good morning, space-son Louis.

31
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,806
- Earthling.
- Louis!

32

Jane!

33
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,140
Elvira's electric is out again,

34
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,606
and she's gonna get hyper
if she can't see her soaps!

35
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:42,734
Granny, tell elvira that Alex will be over
to patch her electric in time for the soaps.

36
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,199
- I'll tell her, Jane. Elvira!
- Louis!

37
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,870
Louis! Go tell Alex that I need him.

38
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,707
Beware, aliens,
Louis rogan, the cosmic cadet,

39

Shoot them, okay?

Now from the bottom up, okay.
There's one right over there.

Okay, doing good.
Right up there.

- Rogan, come on.
- Alex, how you doing, man?

62
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,236
- Just a second.
- Let's do it, buddy! Come on!

63
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,593
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Alex. Hurry up!

64
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,392
- Alex, did it come yet?
- Uh... no, I don't think so.

65
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,852
What's it this time, rogan?
You joining the foreign legion?

66

Yes, sir, folks, step right up and meet
boy adventurer Alex rogan

67
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,359
on the last leg
of his worldwide tour to nowhere.

68
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,154
Funny, Blake.

69
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,195
You guys think I'm gonna hang out here,
watch you shine your pickup,

70
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:56,118
go to the drive-in, get drunk
and throw up every Saturday night,

71
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,285
go to city college like everybody else?

72
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,338
Forget it, man.
I'm doing something with my life.

73
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,332
- Uh-oh, Mr. serioso!
- Alex!

74
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,128
- Yeah?
- Honey, elvira's electric is out.

75
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,220
Oh, ma, that's gonna take all day.
I was going to silver lake.

76
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,933
Honey, I know. I'm sorry.
I'm working lunch and dinner.

77
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,268
I'm gonna be in town all day!

78
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:25,142
- Oh, alright. Okay, ma. I'll do it.
- Thanks, honey.

79
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,150
We're gonna be late.

80
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,944
Look, you, uh...
You'd just better go ahead without me.

81
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,698
- No. Alex, I'll stay.
- No. That's okay. This'll take a while.

82
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,869
Uh... I'll catch up with you later.

83
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,457
Alex...

84
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,923
- Bye-bye, rogan!
- See you, dude!

85
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,384
Alex, come help me!

86
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,730
Hey, Alex.
Could you give me a hand here?

87
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,394
Thanks, Alex!

88
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,716
What should we do tonight?

89
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,884
I don't know. How about cards?

90
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,850
- Hey, that's a good idea.
- Yeah, but we played cards last night.

91
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,896
The missus wants to go
into town tonight and go dancing.

92
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,590
The fish were really biting
down there at the stream.

93
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,059
It was pleasant fishing today.

94
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,806
Yup. It's gonna be pleasant
tomorrow, too.

95
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,190
Gonna be a pleasant summer
according to farmer's almanac.

96
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,359
Yeah. I love the farmer's almanac.

97
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,483

Oh. And you never have
a good time. Is that it?

108

Oh, sure, I love patching
30-year-old fuse panels

Otis, I never even get a chance
to have a good time around here.

Important thing is, when it comes,

114

you got to grab it with both hands
and hold on tight.

- Thank you.

a thousand times,

Hold on a second.
Where are you going?

165
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,683
What's wrong?

166
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,024
Well, I guess it just hit me.

You really are leaving here,
aren't you?

168
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,321
Of course, I'm leaving.
We're both gonna leave here.

169
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,862
- Both of us, Alex?
- Yeah.

170
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,201
We talked about this.

171
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,929
When I get to school, I'll find a place
and come back and get you.

172
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,830
Well, what about granny?

173
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,582
Granny?

174
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,585
Truth is, you're scared
of leaving this trailer park.

175
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,873
I'm not scared of leaving
this trailer park, Alex.

176
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,046
Hey. Listen.

177
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,427
Whatever happens,
it's you and me forever, right?

178
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,471
Right?

179
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,934
I love you so much, Alex.

180
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,103
I'll always love you, maggs.

181
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,026
Diarrhea!

182
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,799
Maggie! Maggie!

183
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:56,304
Alex, I got to go in. Good night.

184
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,013
- Night.
- Night.

185
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,488
Someday they're gonna say,
"this is where it all began."

186
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,830
What?

187
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,245
Mom, I finally broke
the starfighter record.

188
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,286
Oh, that's nice, dear.

189
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,834
Nice? It's stupendous!

190
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,208
Uh, Alex...

191
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,507
Mr. brenner knew that you'd want
to see this as soon as possible,

192
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,096
so he brought it
by the diner and, uh...

193
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,762
Well, I was so excited, I opened it.

194
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,055
Oh, that's okay. What is it?

195
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,179
It's about your loan.

196
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,695
You can still go to city college
with your friends.

197
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,229
'Greetings, starfighter.

198
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,989
'Greetings, starfighter.

199
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,989
"You have been recruited by
the star league to defend the frontier.

200
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,332
"You have been recruited.
Greetings, starfighter.

201
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,998
"You have been recruited...'

202
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,793
"you have been recruited...'

203
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,173
'get ready.
Prepare for blast-off.'

204
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,171
'get ready..."

205
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,429
Hello? Excuse me, son.

206
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,519
Store's closed, mister.

207
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,435
I'm not here for cigarettes
or bubble gum, my boy.

208
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,630
Can you tell me the name of the person
who broke the record on that game there,

209
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,485
where I might find him?

210
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,948
Alex rogan. You're looking at him.

211
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,277
Alex rogan. A-ha-ha!

212
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,075
- Who are you?
- Centauri's the name.

213
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,494
I invented starfighter,
which is why I'm here.

214
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,912
- Tis?
- Ltis.

215
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,536
We have to talk about a matter
of utmost importance.

216
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,288
Step into my office.

217
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,882
That's it. Come on now.

218
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,627
Nothing to be afraid of.

219
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,347
Oh, yes.
Say hello to my assistant, beta.

220
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,512
Howdy.

221
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,564
Ow!

222
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,776
I must congratulate you
on your virtuoso performance, my boy.

223
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,816
Centauri is impressed.
I've seen 'em come and I've seen 'em go.

224
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,940
But you're the best, my boy. Dazzling.

225
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,067
Light years ahead of the competition.

226
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,239
Which is why centauri is here.

227
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,947
He's got a little proposition for you.

228
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,745
Are you interested?

229
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,623
I guess.

230
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,005
Hey!

231
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,513
- What are you doing?
- Listen...

232
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,347
Centauri wants to keep it
for a surprise.

233
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,140
Trust me.
Oh, you're gonna love it. Love it!

234
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,736
The amusing thing about this,
it's all a big mistake.

235
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,403
That particular starfighter game was
supposed to be delivered to Vegas,

236
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,491
not some flea-speck trailer park

237
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,612
in the middle of tumbleweeds
and tarantulas.

238
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,535
So, it must be fate,
destiny, blind chance,

239
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,407
luck, even, that brings us together.

240
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,295
And as the poet says,
"the rest is history."

241
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,966
Where are you going?
Where are you taking me?

242
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,809
I told you.
I wanna save it for a surprise.

243
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:59,774
Hey, are you the kind of kid who reads
the last page of a mystery first?

244
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,234
Who pesters the magician
to tell you his tricks?

245
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,900
Who sneaks downstairs
to peek at his Christmas presents?

246
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,239
No. Of course you're not!

247
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,701
That's why I'm not gonna tell you.

248
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,487
Oh, god.

249
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,954
Besides, I just love surprises, don't you?

250
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,545
- Hey, look out! Stop!
- Oh, dear...

251
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,414
Hit the brakes! Hey...

252
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,588
Oh sh...

253
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,644
Aargh!

254
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,652
Shifting into star drive
at columba zeta. Hold tight.

255
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,230
Hey. Hey, let me out of here!

256
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,813
There's a perfectly
logical explanation for all this.

257
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,539
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

258
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,521
Hi! How are you? Uh... what is this?

259
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,603
Listen, do you speak english? I'd...

260
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,029
This is nice but, uh...

261
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,245
Centauri, what's going on here?

262
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,401
He's just saying how delighted
he is that you're here.

263
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,792
If there's anything he can do to make
your stay more enjoyable, give him a ring.

264
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,887
My stay? What are you talking about?
Where are we?

265
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,971
Welcome to rylos, my boy!

266
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:29,349
Rylos? Wait a minute.
You mean... you mean like in a game?

267
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,267
Oh, he's quick. He's quick.
He's very quick.

268
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,437
He's speechless.
So long, Alex! Have fun!

269
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,812
May the luck of the seven pillars of gulu
be with you at all times.

270
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:41,440
Oh, someday these cheapskates
will thank centauri. Trust me.

271
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,281
Where the hell is June?

272
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,663
Yolanda, baby!

273
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,508
Hi, maggs.

274
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,180
Hi, Louis.

275
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:16,229
- Is he up?
- Yeah. He's been up all night moaning.

276
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,443
Alex?

277
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,904
Your mother told me about the loan.

278
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,540
Is there anything I can do?

279
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,542
Listen, I'll be next door
if you need anything, okay?

280
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,707
Gunstars.

281
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,456
I gotta be dreaming.

282
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,056
Yeah, right...

283
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,515
Listen, there's been a big mistake.

284
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,939
'...immediately after situation report..."

285
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,404
- Welcome to starfighter command.
- You speak english?

286
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,024
No, you hear english,
thanks to your translator device.

287
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,697
Hurry up.
We haven't got much time.

288
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,993
The briefing begins immediately.
Join the other recruits.

289
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,332
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

290
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,918
Wait a minute! What are you
talking about, recruits?

291
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,130
I don't believe this.

292
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:51,471
'Attention. Attention, please.
Ambassador enduran has arrived

293
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,888
'and will now address
starfighter command personnel.'

294
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,898
as you all know, we have been
on a desperate quest...

295
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,019
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- To find starfighters and navigators.

296
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,910
I should... I should crush you
to gorun dust!

297
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,780
I'm sorry, uh...
It was an accident.

298
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,248
I didn't mean to step on your, uh...

299
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,709
- Whatever that is.
- Hideous creature.

300
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,455
If I may continue,
our forces have...

301
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,833
You don't trifle with a bogati.
They love to fight.

302
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,881
That's why they're perfect for this war.

303
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,260
- Did you say "war"?
- But of course!

304
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,509
Why else do you think you're here?

305
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,727
You were recruited
by the star league to defend...

306
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:43,144
"To defend the frontier
against xur and the ko-Dan armada."

307
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:50,281
Eons ago, our ancestors created
our great frontier,

308
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:56,700
a barrier of energy encircling
the peaceful systems of the universe,

309
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:01,496
and forever shutting out
the scourge that lurks beyond.

310
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:07,540
Fellow rylans,
because of a dark betrayal,

311
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,587
our frontier will soon collapse.

312
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:17,637
So we turn to you, starfighters,
and your navigators.

313
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,136
For of all the billions of creatures
in the star league,

314
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:27,860
only you few were found
to possess the, uh... gift.

315
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,610
You, and you alone,

316
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:36,610
stand between us
and the black terror of the ko-Dan.

317
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,661
Victory or death!

318
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,536
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

319
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,505
Victory or death! Victory or death!

320
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,670
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

321
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,169
Victory or death! Victory or death!

322
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,843
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

323
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,138
Victory or death! Victory or death!

324
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,057
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

325
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,648
'Now, starfighters,
if you will reach underneath your seats,

326
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:10,394
'you will find a packet
which contains one...'

327
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,992
this is a restricted area,
off-limits to...

328
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,663
My apologies, starfighter.

329
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,125
Star navigator first class grig
at your service, sir!

330
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,006
Hi. I'm Alex rogan.

331
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,574
I was playing this game back home,
and this guy came up to me.

332
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,634
Only he's not a guy, he's an alien, right?

333
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,301
And I get into his car,
only it's not a car, it's a spaceship.

334
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,641
And, uh... there's been a big mistake.

335
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,979
Am I to understand you're actually declining
the honor of becoming a starfighter?

336
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,190
- You got it.
- Extraordinary!

337
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:54,070
For eons, all creatures have dreamt
of being starfighters.

338
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,190
- Where are you from?
- Earth.

339
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,443
And we're not at war with anybody
except each other.

340
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,288
Earth? Earth isn't a formal member
of the star league,

341
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,702
and isn't due to be approached
until it matures.

342
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,417
This is all highly irregular.

343
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,833
Tell me, who recruited you?

344
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,752
Centauri.

345
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,468
- There he is. That's him!
- Centauri? I might've known.

346
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:25,511
Up to your old Excalibur tricks
again, eh, centauri?

347
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,638
Did it ever occur to you
that it's against the law

348
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,265
to recruit from worlds
outside the star league?

349
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,358
Earth's in danger, too, isn't it?

350
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,648
And, no, I did not use
the Excalibur test.

351
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,396
It was called a video game.

352
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:40,947
What's all the brouhaha?
After all, he does have the gift.

353
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,365
This may come as a bit
of a shock to you,

354
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,830
but he doesn't want to be a starfighter.

355
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,668
Doesn't want to be a...?
Are you a coward?

356
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,458
- Are you crazy?
- You didn't tell me about any of this!

357
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,165
Return the money, centauri!

358
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:58,419
Return the money? Are you delirious?

359
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,511
Do you know how long it took
to invent the games,

360
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,134
to merchandise them, to get them
into the stores by Christmas?

361
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,104
It must be terribly embarrassing for you,
and I do sympathize, however...

362
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,645
But I saw him fight!
He could be the greatest starfighter ever!

363
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,484
- That was a game, centauri.
- A game?

364
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,693
You may have thought it was a game,
but it was also a test.

365
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,441
A-ha! A test!

366
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:26,038
Sent out across the universe to find
those with the gift to be starfighters.

367
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,203
And here you are, my boy.
Here you are!

368
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,794
- Right! Here I am, about to be killed!
- Killed...

369
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:37,124
You don't seriously think
it's dangerous, do you?

370
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,797
Don't be silly. Trust me.

371
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,312
Xur!

372
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,239
Xur!

373
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,108
Xur?

374
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:10,741
Yes, father, your mighty frontier
grows weaker by the moment.

375
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,085
Do not call me father!

376
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,164
You are no longer my son!

377
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,588
You're an outcast!
Why have you returned?

378
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,511
I have returned for the good
of all rylans.

379
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,973
With an armada
of ko-Dan warships behind you?

380
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,594
There are some rylans
who would welcome me, father.

381
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,598
Star league justice
put down your xurian cult.

382
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,441
Your followers are few and scattered.

383
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,310
Star league?

384
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,065
A refuge for weak worlds
not worthy to be our equals!

385
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,408
That is for the rylans to decide,

386
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,325
and not for a dangerous
and evil child such as yourself.

387
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:56,207
And yet, it is this child
who caught your master spy.

388
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,442
Hear me, rylans!

389
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,541
When the green moon of galan is
eclipsed, ko-Dan armada will invade,

390
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,505
and not even your mighty starfighters
will be able to save you.

391
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:44,376
We shall see, xur. We shall see!

392
00:37:55,982 --> 00:38:01,147
Ha-ha! You still wanna go
and miss all the excitement?

393
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,691
Little brat.

394
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,159
I invent the game, find the kid,
drag him up there,

395
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,201
and he doesn't wanna be a starfighter.
I give up!

396
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,738
'Control, do you copy our star
angle difference from parking angle?"

397
00:38:55,875 --> 00:39:00,494
'Delta beta two at six,
delta gamma three at five.'

398
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,086
Emperor xur ordered me
to bring his scepter.

399
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,680
Let him enter.

400
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,266
"Target vector
remains on scope.'

401
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,193
Just like your ko-Dan emperor's,
isn't it, commander kril?

402
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:37,368
It takes more than a scepter
to rule, xur,

403
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,912
even on rylos.

404
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,169
You're right, kiril.

405
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,500
It does take more than a scepter.

406
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,761
How long must we endure this fool?

407
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:05,442
- We have a break in the frontier.
- Fire the meteor gun!

408
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,151
My dear ko-Dan friends,
lest we forget,

409
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:15,072
it was your own emperor who granted me
command of this armada.

410
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,116
For only I hold the secret
to the frontier.

411
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,491
Only I know the location
of the starfighter base.

412
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:25,917
And therefore,
only I will give the order to fire!

413
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,501
Forgive me, xur.

414
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,348
You are forgiven, commander kiril.

415
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,400
Meteor gunner... fire.

416
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,846
Sergeant!

417
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,559
I have an unidentified
incoming object in sector 31, sir.

418
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,231
They're headed for the base.

419
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:38,610
Alert! We are under attack!
I repeat, we are under attack!

420
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,163
Activate automatic repulser guns.

421
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,428
'Condition red! Condition red!

422
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,389
At last, it is done!

423
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,939
Soon the frontier will be down,

424
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,529
and they will bow
to their new emperor!

425
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,106
Or I will darken the sky
with their ashes.

426
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:03,782
Commander, the xurian spy reports
that one starfighter has escaped.

427
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,405
Escaped?

428
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,510
Sure I can't give you a hand?

429
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,784
You've done quite enough
already. Thank you.

430
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,264
Well, uh...

431
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,682
It's only a few more miles from here.
I guess... I guess I can walk it.

432
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,773
So long. Bye, centauri.

433
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,987
Oh, Alex!

434
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,369
Here!

435
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,582
Hey, listen. I can't take a present
from you, centauri.

436
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,671
He reduces me to poverty again
and he thinks I'm giving him a present.

437
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,386
- What a world this is.
- What is it, then?

438
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,380
It's a second chance, my boy!

439
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,884
If you change your mind,
just tap the communo-crystals.

440
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,807
- Keep it.
- Ah, Alex, Alex!

441
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,856
You're walking away from history.
History!

442
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:21,447
Did Chris Columbus say
he wanted to stay home? No!

443
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,283
What if the Wright brothers
thought that only birds should fly?

444
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,745
And did geloca think the yulus
were too ugly to save?

445
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,364
Who's geloca?

446
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,870
Never mind.

447
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,421
Listen, centauri, I'm none of those guys.
I'm a kid from a trailer park.

448
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,634
If that's what you think,
then that's all you'll ever be!

449
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,202
Hey. Maggie!

450
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,960
Listen to this.
You're not gonna believe this...

451
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,001
I told you, Alex.
Me and my... how did you put it?

452
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,626
"Strange sexual urges"
aren't talking to you anymore.

453
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:08,011
- Who's there!
- Shh! You're gonna wake up Louis.

454
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:20,650
- Hey, you look like me!
- Of course I do. I'm the beta unit.

455
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,020
What the hell's a beta unit?

456
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:27,193
A beta unit is a simuloid,

457
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,238
an exact duplicate of you,
only not as loud.

458
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,913
- Huh?
- I was in the starcar, remember?

459
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,909
We shook hands?
I became you, unfortunately.

460
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,205
Let me get this straight.
You're a robot?

461
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,297
I beg your pardon.

462
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:48,674
I'm a state-of-the-art,
top-of-the-line beta unit,

463
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,344
put here as a courtesy replacement
for while you're away.

464
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,262
Lucky me.

465
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,306
Wait a minute.
What are you doing back?

466
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:57,975
Are you kidding? It's war up there!

467
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:01,190
Oh. Save the whales
and not the universe, huh?

468
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,733
Well, why don't you
go up there and fight?

469
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,275
Simuloids can't fight.
We're not allowed.

470
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,864
Well, tell them that you're me!
Pretend!

471
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,109
Be quiet, Alex.

472
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,156
Sorry, Louis.

473
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,571
Thanks for the lift!

474
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,370
Sure thing, buddy. See you around!

475
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,430
'Greetings, starfighter.

00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,590
And, hey, what did you do
to Maggie?

479
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,129
Do to her?

480
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:14,221
We're sitting outside, looking at the
stars, and she sticks her tongue in my ear!

481
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,308
I screamed.
I'll apologize tomorrow, okay?

482
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,678
You're not gonna be here.
You're going back with centauri right now!

483
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,146
What's up, Alex?

484
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:25,641
Back to sleep, Louis,
or I'm telling ma about your "playboys"!

485
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,770
You're blowing it, Alex!

486
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,033
What the shit?

487
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:39,747
I said, back to sleep, Louis,
or I'm telling ma about your "playboys"!

488
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,749
Come in, centauri.

489
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,087
Come on. Get back here.
And take your tonka toy with you.

490

Hey!

- Centauri, look out!
- What the...?

503
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:12,608
Phew! Foul stench.
Dirty creatures.

504
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,814
Get a good look, Alex.

505
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,863
You can bet your asteroids
you'll be seeing more of them.

506
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,033
- What?
- This is a zando-zan.

507
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,077
An interstellar hitbeast,
compliments of xur.

508
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,164
Xur? Why is he after me?

509
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:33,504
Somehow he found out
you're a starfighter.

510
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:37,170
So you see, Alex,
you gotta go back. You got no choice.

511
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,510
Cos if you stay down here,
you're dog food.

512
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,128
Trust centauri, my boy.

513
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:45,133
Because in two hours, this place will
be crawling with ten zando-zans

514
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:49,182
with just one thought
on their microscopic little minds:

515
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,226
Kill Alex rogan.

516
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,145
- Kill Alex rogan?
- He's right, Alex.

517
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:57,020
At least up there, you'll have
a fighting chance in a gunstar.

518
00:51:57,156 --> 00:52:01,069
Exactly. Meanwhile, down here,
they'll be going after beta.

519
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,657
- Beta.
- Beta?

520
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,868
Of course.
What do you think he's here for?

521
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,613
Wait a...
Wait a second here, centauri.

522
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,990
Alex, look out!

523
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,294
Centauri!

524
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:23,379
- Beta, get a doctor!
- No. No native cures. No witch doctors.

525
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,847
I'm fine. Just a scratch.

526
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,270
Now face it, Alex.
You're a born starfighter.

527
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,475
Are you with me?

528
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,154
Okay, let's go, centauri.

529
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,040
Good luck, Alex.

530
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,080
You, too, Alex.

531
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,404
Centauri to starfighter command.

532
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:26,154
Centauri to starfighter command.
Come in, please.

533
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,798
Hey, centauri.

534
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,884
'Attention all personnel.
Starcar approaching docking bay 12.

535
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,599
Centauri! Centauri!

536
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:04,572
- Hey, hit the brakes!
- 'Starcar approaching docking bay...'

537
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,031
- grig! Hey, grig!
- Alex!

538
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,155
They got centauri. He's hurt.

539
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,906
He's right over here.

540
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,753
Ah! You see?

541
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:32,508
- Centauri brought him back.
- Yes, I see. Don't talk.

542
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:38,272
- Does he have my money, Alex?
- I have a fortune for you, centauri.

543
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,312
Now, please be still.

544
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:44,528
It's here. It's all here.
Piles and piles of it.

545
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,113
All for you.

546
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,407
Ah...

547
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,780
At last.

548
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:59,748
Alex, I want you to know, it was
for the greatest good I brought you back.

549
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,424
Of course... it...

550
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,672
It never hurts to be rich.

551
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:22,691
Until the next dimension, old friend.

552
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,945
I'm sorry, Alex.

553
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,148
Centauri?

554
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,075
Centauri?

555
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,535
The frontier could collapse
at any moment.

556
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,794
Alex!

557
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:43,059
Now I need an ear job.
I'm dying here. Dying!

558
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,206
Alex, what the hell's going on?

559
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:06,667
Louis, you're having a terrible nightmare.
Go back to sleep.

560
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,963
Louis!

561
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,100
Oh, no.

562
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,826
Am I to understand there's a beta unit
taking your place back home?

563
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:42,994
He's trying.

564
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,993
So it's safe to assume that
xur thinks you're still on earth.

565
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,835
Yeah.

566
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,707
That could work to our advantage,
theoretically.

567
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,466
Ah! Now you look human!

568
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,011
Is this my gunstar?

569
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,513
This is a prototype,
different from the other ships.

570
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,643
She has a greater range, more power,
and a slight weapons modification.

571
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:16,698
And of course, she's got deflective plating
so she can withstand several direct hits.

572
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,038
From here,
this is where I navigate the ship,

573
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,704
maintain life support
and propulsion systems.

574
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:32,540
- Okay. Where do I sit?
- Way up there, in the gunnery chair.

575
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,545
- Hang on!
- Okay.

576
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,852
Now, climb into the gunnery chair.

577
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:51,441
Now, I'm moving you
into launch position.

578
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:57,524
There in front of you are the two switches
for your heads-up display. Turn them on.

579
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:03,453
While you're engaging the enemy,
the screen will reflect

580
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,868
all battle instruments towards you.

581
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,909
Where did it go?

582
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,412
It's still there,
suspended in a xenon mist.

583
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,459
But it's only visible
if you look dead ahead.

584
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,708
Ah, got it.

585
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,835
The lever on your left is
the chair controller.

586
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,929
As you can see, all guns will track
with your every move.

587
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,767
Hal

588
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,065
grasp the target control
with your right hand.

589
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:35,686
At your fingers is the weaponry,
the lasers, photon bolts...

590
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,110
Photon bolts and the particle beams.
Wait a minute, this is just like back home!

591
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,573
- What's this?
- Careful, careful!

592
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:44,035
That's death blossom,
a weapon of last resort.

593
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:47,156
Luckily, I was in here working on it
when the hangar went up.

594
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,455
Now, are you ready?
All systems, go!

595
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,999
Ignition!

596
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:02,759
- Wait, when did the hangar go up?
- I told you, when xur attacked.

597
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,098
- And where were the starfighters?
- In the hangar!

598
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:06,888
You mean they're dead?

599
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,762
Death is a primitive concept.

600
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:14,938
I prefer to think of them
as battling evil in another dimension.

601
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,686
In another dimension?
How many are left?

602
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:20,405
- Including yourself?
- Yeah.

603
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,324
One!

604
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,656
One?

605
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,331
Hold it!

606
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,588
There's no fleet,
no starfighters, no plan?

607
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,884
- One ship, you, me, and that's it?
- Exactly!

608
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:49,259
Xur thinks you're still on earth.
Classic military strategy. Surprise attack.

609
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,978
- It'll be a slaughter!
- That's the spirit.

610
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:55,691
No, my slaughter.
One ship against the whole armada?

611
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,902
Yes.
One gunstar against the armada.

612
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:04,070
I've always wanted to fight
a desperate battle against incredible odds.

613
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,203
- Target lights, Alex.
- Target lights?

614
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,540
Yes, you might want to squeeze off
a few rounds while you have the chance.

615
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:16,878
Just work the bugs out of the system.
After all, it is her maiden voyage.

616
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,443
Steady. Don't fight the chair.

617
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:42,403
Take your time.
Watch your gun sights.

618
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,488
Lead your targets.

619
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,199
And above all, relax!

620
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:50,412
Terrific. I'm about to get killed
a million miles from nowhere

621
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,532
with a gung-ho iguana
who tells me to relax.

622
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,203
Interstellar!

623
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,745
Alex!

624
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,159
Sorry.

625
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,290
Okay, now, come on. Ease it up.

626
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,664
Okay.

627
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,127
Oh, that's... that's it. Easy.

628
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,512
Nice and easy. Yep.

629
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:53,467
A little bit more
and we'll get it in there, now.

630
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,685
- Aargh!
- Alex!

631
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,524
Sorry. Hi, maggs.

632
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:04,190
- Alex, are you alright?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

633
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,815
Come on. Try it again.

634
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:11,739
Did you smell anything?

635
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,660
- Like what?
- Likeaz...

636
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,911
Forget it.

637
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:29,715
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for slapping you last night.

638
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,639
Oh, that's okay, maggs.
I deserved it.

639
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,599
I'm sorry.

640
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,847
Well, maybe we can make it up
to each other tonight at silver lake?

641
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,507
The armada will break
through the frontier here,

642
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:14,005
and reach rylos in 20 klicks.

643
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:16,849
Squadrons of deck fighters
will precede the mother ship.

644
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,718
Squadrons? How many squadrons?

645
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,062
It isn't the number of squadrons
that concerns me.

646
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:24,558
It's this communication turret that sends
out the commands to the deck fighters,

647
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,901
which enables them to act
as one during the fight.

648
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,646
Wait a second. We knock out
the turret to get the fighters.

649
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,240
But to get the turret,
we gotta get through the fighters.

650
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,700
We're dead.

651
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,865
I'll have it all figured out
by the time we reach the frontier.

652
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,079
- What's that?
- The frontier.

653
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:56,139
Now, that's strange. What's a cargo ship
doing this close to the frontier?

654
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,929
'Hail. This is gunstar one.'

655
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:07,734
I repeat, this is gunstar one.
Identify yourself, please.

656
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,987
Alex, look out.

657
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,824
A xurian ship!

658
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:22,707
Congratulations, Alex.
This is your first live target.

659
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,042
Live?

660
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,711
Within range in five klicks.
Get ready.

661
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:39,599
I've blocked its beam of frequency,
so it can't report back to the armada.

662
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,468
- Fire when ready!
- Grig, wait...

663
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,739
We mustn't lose them
in these caves, Alex. Fire!

664
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:19,639
Shoot, Alex!

665
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,188
Shoot!

666
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,156
You did it! Ha!

667
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:47,201
I did it? You did it!
You almost got me killed!

668
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,501
My deepest apologies, Alex.

669
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:55,584
I had hoped that by putting you
in the thick of battle,

670
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,177
a great starfighter would emerge.

671
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:03,596
But, alas, perhaps there was never
one within you to begin with.

672
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,720
I shall take you home.

673
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:12,772
You still may live
a long and fruitful life back there.

674
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,904
That is... until the ko-Dan reach earth.

675
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,857
But then again...

676
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,417
Hey, yo, Blake!
Make that sucker blast, man!

677
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,136
- You got it, dude!
- Alright!

678
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,978
So Blake comes back in
to grab his pants, right?

679
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,893
Sees her old lady, and he says,

680
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:54,142
"I hope this doesn't rule out
dinner on Tuesday night."

681
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,403
That's my man!

682
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,697
Alex, are you okay?

683
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,867
Hmm? Yeah, sure. Why?

684
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:11,288
I don't know,
you're just acting spaced out.

685
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,036
You're... you're not yourself.

686
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:19,961
Well, if you were me,
what would you be doing right now?

687
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:27,054
Well, for one thing,
I'd be trying to enjoy myself.

688
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:31,054
Leaning back.
Kidding around. Laughing.

689
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,305
Laughing?

690
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,433
Well, it's a start, Alex.

691
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:35,979
Laughing...

692
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,308
Aargh!

693
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:24,107
Nice place. Reminds me of home.

694
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,108
This reminds you of home?

695
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,985
Ah, yes.

696
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,622
I live below ground.

697
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:39,964
With my wifeoid
and 6,000 little griglings.

698
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,592
At least, until xur turns them
into slaves.

699
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,141
Where does your kind live?

700
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,233
Oh, uh, houses, mostly.

701
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:05,281
That's caves above ground.
See, here...

702
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,150
Here's my family.

703
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,403
See, that's...

704
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:15,075
That's my folks and my brother, Louis,
and that's Maggie.

705
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,087
That's a cave that goes places.

706
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,211
Only we never went anyplace.

707
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:32,767
A mobile cave that never went anywhere.
Fascinating.

708
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:36,228
Yeah, but we have below-ground caves
near the trailer parks.

709
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:39,770
Me and my brother, Louis,
used to play hide-and-seek in them.

710
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,896
- Hide-and-seek...
- What is it, Alex?

711
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:48,616
Well, I was just thinking,
maybe we could hide here,

712
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:53,034
let the armada pass by,
and then hit the turret from behind.

713
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,407
Then we might take them by surprise.

714
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:03,043
Your plan might really have worked.

715
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:07,260
What a pity there are
no starfighters left to carry it out.

716
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,673
Yeah. Yeah.

717
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,438
A xurian base!

718
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:40,535
Two more dead ahead! Closing fast!

719
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,228
Earth course logged
into navigational beams.

720
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:10,697
Grig?

721
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,493
What is it, Alex?

722
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,992
Maybe there is a starfighter left.

723
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,874
Ow!

724
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,795
What's wrong?

725
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,759
Should I put my tongue
in your ear now?

726
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,629
Don't bother, Alex.

727
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,011
Well, it's just... I'm kind of new
at these gland games.

728
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,594
What are you talking about?

729
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,689
It's like you're
a million miles away, Alex!

730
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,947
'Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, darling.

731
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,995
'Darling, forgive me."

732
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,256
Darling, forgive me.

733
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,879
'Come on!

734
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,220
"You're my Juliet. My Venus.'

735
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:08,311
you're my Juliet. My Venus.

736
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,153
Alex!

737
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:18,777
'All the other girls meant nothing to me.
It was you, you, you.'

738
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:21,029
'shut up and talk dirty to me.'

739
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:28,002
the other girls meant nothing to me.
It was you... you... y...

740
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,207
Should I talk dirty to you now?

741
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:37,591
- That does it.
- Oh, god. Alright, I give up.

742
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,089
- I'm not Alex rogan.
- What?

743
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:43,517
I'm a beta unit.
I'm an exact duplicate of Alex.

744
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:46,683
He's up there saving the universe,
while I'm down here for target practice.

745
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,267
See”?

746
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,453
- Alex! Or whatever you are. Wait. Wait.
- What? Let me go.

747
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:05,823
If that zando-zan reports back that
I'm not Alex, Alex is in big trouble!

748
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,145
- You're staying here.
- No, I'm not.

749
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,398
I'm not staying anywhere
until I find out what's going on!

750
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:10,628
God!

751
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:15,003
Hey, my truck...
Hey, hey, come back!

752
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,424
Scratch that paint
and you're dead, rogan!

753
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,391
- Ready to invade, commander.
- Invade.

754
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,691
Commander, the xurian ships
have not answered our invasion code.

755
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:38,030
The frontier is down,
the moon is eclipsed,

756
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,491
the starfighters are dead. Invade!

757
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:45,451
All squadrons ahead, half speed,
with energy probes on.

758
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,734
Energy probe.
Shut down, Alex. Shut down.

759
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,323
Power off.

760
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,626
Alex in space?

761
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,722
Is this for real?
Yes! That's what I'm trying to tell you!

762
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:49,059
- It's all for real!
- Well, then, don't talk. Drive!

763
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:04,821
Commander kril, we're getting
a signal on the alert frequency.

764
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,319
Acknowledge.

765
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,125
There it is. Alright, when I give
the signal, we're gonna jump!

766
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:14,614
- Okay?
- What do you mean, "jump"?

767
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:16,378
- We're gonna ram him.
- What?

768
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,458
Extermination emissary zeta 6,
one message.

769
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:21,959
- Ready?
- Oh...

770
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:23,711
- Jump!
- Alex!

771
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,347
"The last starfighter..."

772
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,427
You owe me one, Alex.

773
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:38,938
Alex!

774
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,822
Transmission pulsars have stopped,
commander.

775
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:45,737
"The last starfighter"?

776
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,531
Is dead!

777
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:50,951
The last starfighter is dead!

778
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,492
Nothing can stop us now.
Ahead full.

779
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,539
To rylos!

780
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,140
The command ship!

781
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:25,280
There. The turret at the far end.

782
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,446
I see it.

783
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,322
Good luck, starfighter.

784
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:36,166
Thanks, grig. For everything.

785
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,306
I love you, Alex rogan.

786
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,385
Six.

787
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,597
- Heads-up display. Check.
- Five.

788
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,314
Lasers. Check.

789
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:02,185
- Four.
- Particle beam. Check.

790
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,357
- Three.
- Proton bolts. Check.

791
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,526
- Two.
- Chair control. Check.

792
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:07,819
One.

793
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,117
Let's do it.

794
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:23,043
Tracking alert.

795
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,673
Unidentified craft. What is it?

796
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:34,929
Wait...

797
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:36,802
A gunstar!

798
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:41,182
So, the last starfighter is dead?

799
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,857
This has gone far enough.
Sejze him!

800
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:50,195
How dare you?
I am the emperor of rylos.

801
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,194
I and I alone command
this entire op...

802
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:55,821
Release me! I command you!

803
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,745
You will pay for this with your lives!

804
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,286
All guns fire!

805
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:12,964
There it is, the turret!

806
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:15,341
Alex, now!

807
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,220
- Yes!
- Got it!

808
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:24,358
Hurry, Alex, fire!
The armada's almost to rylos!

809
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,587
'Escape pod activated.

810
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,338
'Escape pod ignition.'

811
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,136
the gunstar is gone from our sensors.

812
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,256
Alert wing commanders.

813
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,883
Communication turret
is destroyed.

814
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:06,817
'All communication radar systems
are out, wing commander.

815
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:09,527
'Proceed with a visual attack formation.'

816
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:17,490
life support good.
Ammo packs at peak.

817
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:19,284
I think we've gotta use death blossom.

818
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:23,079
Remember, death blossom delivers
only one massive volley at close range.

819
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,712
- Theoretically.
- What do you mean, "theoretically"?

820
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,047
After all, d. B. Has never been tested.

821
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:31,883
It might overload the systems,
blow up the ship.

822
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:34,699
What are you worried about, grig?
Theoretically we should already be dead.

823
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,054
Mmm-hmm.

824
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:39,557
Open death blossom petals.
Switch is on.

825
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:56,612
Do not trigger d. B.
Until we're within range.

826
01:21:56,745 --> 01:22:00,158
Just use your lasers until I give
the signal. Remember to lead...

827
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:03,874
I've been recruited by the star league
to defend the frontier.

828
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:07,915
- Now, are you ready?
- This is it. Here we go.

829
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:09,584
Charge!

830
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,243
On your right!

831
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:43,288
Your left!

832
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:46,083
Evade!

833
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,539
Power packs are low.
We need time to recharge.

834
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,839
Laser power draining!

835
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:08,264
Grig, my weapons are gone!
Should I do it?

836
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,187
Easy, easy! Wait till they're all
in death blossom range!

837
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,406
Firel

838
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:56,945
We did it.

839
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,985
Yes, we actually did, didn't we?

840
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,616
The command ship!

841
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:08,866
Commander, our guns are out.
Damage control is repairing them.

842
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:12,460
Forget the guns! Ramming speed!

843
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:24,264
- Grig, we need power!
- Death blossom's drained all power.

844
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:28,181
I'm working on it.
I'm trying to run boost.

845
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,437
All we have left is life support power.

846
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,649
Grig!

847
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,865
Alright!

848
01:24:57,593 --> 01:25:01,336
Weapons on.
We have them now! Fire! Fire!

849
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:25,947
Damage report!

850
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:30,247
Guidance system out.
Auxiliary steering out.

851
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:31,660
Divert!

852
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,410
- Divert!
- She won't answer the helm!

853
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:38,038
We're locked into the moon's
gravitational pull!

854
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,836
What do we do?

855
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:44,798
We die.

856
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,647
Ya-hoo!

857
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,236
On behalf of the star league
and all citizens of rylos,

858
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:12,740
I congratulate you
on your dazzling victory.

859
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,332
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

860
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:17,874
But as you know,
the frontier is down,

861
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,292
xur escaped,
and there is still danger.

862
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,508
So I was wondering
if you wouldn't be willing to stay on,

863
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:26,049
and rebuild the starfighter legion.

864
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,637
Wait a minute.

865
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,759
- Rebuild the legion?
- Yes.

866
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:35,387
Of course, you'd have the help
of an old friend.

867
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,602
An old friend? Who?

868
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,867
Centauri! I thought you were dead.

869
01:26:57,421 --> 01:27:00,709
Me die and miss all the excitement?
Oh, no.

870
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:03,332
I was merely dormant
while my body repaired itself.

871
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,379
No, I won't bore you
with the details.

872
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,379
Suffice it to say,
you're on rylos, my boy.

873
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:11,302
Stop thinking human.
That's lesson number one.

874
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:14,973
Now, lesson number two,
you've got a good thing going here.

875
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:17,847
Keep smiling. Don't blow it.

876
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:21,475
And lesson number three,
always trust centauri.

877
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:29,232
Alex, they love you!

878
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:35,576
You see, all rylos is behind you.

879
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,544
- You've got to stay, Alex.
- You will stay, won't you?

880
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,788
Of course, he'll stay.

881
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:48,465
That's very reassuring, centauri.
Grig, I leave it in your capable hands.

882
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,801
I'll stay.

883
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,487
Alex! Alex!

884
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,960
'Greetings...

885
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,455
'Greetings, starfighter.'

886
01:28:25,592 --> 01:28:28,334
- bunny, have you seen Alex?
- Can't say that I have.

887
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:31,587
Well, ask Maggie.
She knows where he is.

888
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:35,090
- She was with him.
- Maggie, where's Alex?

889
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,718
Yeah, where's my truck?
Where's your boyfriend?

890
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:40,436
Mrs. rogan, about Alex,
you see, he's...

891
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,817
- What's going on? I don't know.
- What the...?

892
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:09,833
Oh, my god!

893
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:15,096
Whoo! Alright, we're being invaded!

894
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:43,912
Maggie.

895
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:46,336
Maggie!

896
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:51,981
- Alex?
- Hi, maggs.

897
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:54,938
Alex...

898
01:30:56,368 --> 01:31:00,327
Is it you?
I mean... is it really you?

899
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:08,668
- Look!
- My god...

900
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,081
It is you.

901
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:14,674
It's Alex! Alex!

902
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:17,545
Alex, what is going on here?
What is this thing?

903
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:27,763
I mean... is this your spaceship?

904
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:31,062
- I don't know what's gotten into him.
- I don't understand that.

905
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:34,106
- It's all so strange!
- Wait, hold it. Hold it, everybody.

906
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:37,606
Alex, what is all this?

907
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,735
I've been to another planet, ma.

908
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,702
- Another planet?
- What?

909
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:46,410
Who was it helped fix my antenna?

910
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,784
- Yeah, who stole my truck?
- And cut my electrics?

911
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,626
And ruined my stove?

912
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,871
Oh, that was... that was a beta unit.

913
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:55,374
- Beta unit?
- A robot.

914
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,592
A robot? Come on!

915
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:00,212
- A monster!
- Oh!

916
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:04,932
A monster? Ha!

917
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:09,395
- He should have chains on him.
- Alright! It's an alien!

918
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,684
Oh, no, wait! Hey!

919
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:12,899
Granny, put away that shotgun.
What's wrong with you?

920
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:15,735
This is my friend grig.
I want you all to meet my friend here.

921
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:19,448
- You gotta be kidding!
- Grig, this is Mrs. Boone.

922
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:23,026
- Hello.
- Hello.

923
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:25,404
- And, uh, this is elvira.
- Delighted.

924
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,282
- Me, too. How you doing?
- I do well.

925
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:31,034
- And this is granny.
- How do you do?

926
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:32,877
How do you do?

927
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,668
- And this here's Otis.
- A pleasure.

928
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,634
Any friend of Alex...

929
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:42,175
And, uh, this is Maggie.

930
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,844
A very large pleasure.

931
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:46,807
Hi. Uh...

932
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:52,684
You must be Louis!

933
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:57,610
I hear good things about you.

934
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:00,651
Hear that, you slimes?
I'm famous.

935
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:05,448
And, uh... this is my mom.

936
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:12,785
You should be proud of Alex, Mrs. rogan.
You must all be proud of him.

937
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:17,039
He saved the star league
and hundreds of worlds, including earth.

938
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:20,338
- Oh, for heaven's sake!
- Oh, my god!

939
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:24,588
Time to leave, Alex.

940
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,464
Alex?

941
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,808
I have to, ma.
They need me up there.

942
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,428
Oh, Alex, I always knew
you'd leave someday,

943
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,805
but I never expected this.

944
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,933
Gee, can I go, too, Alex? Can I?

945
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,525
Sorry, squirt.

946
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:41,397
There's only enough room up there
for me, grig, and Maggie.

947
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,820
- Me?
- Yeah.

948
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:50,997
- Alex, I don't think I can...
- What? Come here. Come here.

949
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:54,125
- Why else do you think I came back?
- Well...

950
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:56,711
Didn't we say we'd always be together?

951
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,378
Well, yeah, I mean,
together here or in the city.

952
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,716
But... but up there, Alex...

953
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:05,929
Maggs, you gotta come. I'm not...
I don't know when I'm gonna be back.

954
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,310
Don't you see?
This is it. This is our big chance.

955
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:11,517
It's like what Otis says,

956
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:15,264
when it comes, you got to grab on
with both hands and hold tight.

957
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,817
Well, what about granny, Alex?

958
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,527
You're right.
I'm scared of leaving here.

959
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:31,075
Why can't you just stay?

960
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:34,791
Maggie, I have to leave,
and I want you to come with me.

961
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:41,589
Alex! Hurry!

962
01:34:44,554 --> 01:34:47,091
- Well, I gotta go.
- Um...

963
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,429
Bye.

964
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:58,431
Alex, we can't hold off
their radar any longer.

965
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:01,025
Yeah, okay. I got to go, ma.

966
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,987
Bye. Take it easy.
So long. So long, everybody.

967
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,948
- Hey, bye, Alex!
- Bye!

968
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:10,864
- Bye, Alex!
- Bye!

969
01:35:19,964 --> 01:35:21,374
Alex!

970
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:23,793
Granny...

971
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:28,469
Be sure and write,
or whatever it is they do up there.

972
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:36,056
Alex! Wait, Alex!

973
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,789
- Get back! Come on! Get back!
- Bye!

974
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:58,479
- Keep your distance!
- Watch what you're doing.

975
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:00,289
Keep your distance, now!

976
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:02,787
This baby really packs a punch!

977
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:04,835
Bye! Bye!

978
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:10,679
Look at him. Bye! Bye!

979
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:18,311
Oh, go on. They're gonna be happy
up there. So long, Alex!

980
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,931
So long, Alex!

981
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:27,858
- We're gonna be famous, aren't we, Otis?
- Yes, sir.

982
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:31,700
The whole world, the whole universe
is gonna know about it!

983
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:37,118
Starlite, starbrite, the place where
Alex and Maggie left for the stars!

984
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,787
Louis! Louis!

985
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:41,480
'Greetings, starfighter.

986
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:43,244
"You have been recruited
by the star league

987
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:47,169
'to defend the frontier
against xur and the ko-Dan armada.'

988
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,717
Wow!
