1
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,884
这是我同父异母兄弟的故事。
This is my half-brothers story.

2
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,963
我之所以这么说，是因为我只能这么做
I tell it because it's all I can do

3
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,594
事情的结果
with the way things turned out.

4
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,893
尤金留给我的东西比任何事实都重要。
Eugene left me with something more important than any of the facts.

5
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,982
关于他的故事，人们误解的第一件事是
Now, first thing people get wrong about his story

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,187
是开始。
is the beginning.

7
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,072
不是从威尔斯女士开始的。
It didn't start with the Wells lady.

8
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,907
它始于第一列满载自居者的火车。
It started with the first train full of homesteaders.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,585
在那一天到达俾斯麦的那些心碎的恐惧者中
Amongst the heartbroken fearful who arrived in bismark on that day

10
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:32,290
是约翰，奥利维亚和尤金·贝克
were John, Olivia and Eugene baker.

11
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,509
贝克一家为了一个承诺，把他们的生活搬到了西部的大平原。
The bakers had moved their lives west into the great plains, on a promise.

12
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,721
现在看来，这个承诺就像他们脚下的泥土一样烂。
A promise that now looked as rotten as the dirt they stood on.

13
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:49,306
他们祈求雨水，开始了全新的生活。
They prayed for rain and began to build a new life up from scratch.

14
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,728
但是约翰不相信。
But John wasn't convinced.

15
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,907
他相信这片土地上有被诅咒的东西。
He believed there was something cursed about this land.

16
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,538
在接下来的几年里，约翰的酒量恶化了
Over the next years, John's drinking worsened

17
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,661
他变得疑神疑鬼。
and he became paranoid.

18
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,539
他的脑海里充满了另一种生活的景象。
His mind filled with visions of some other life...

19
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,080
在那里他可以再次生活在上帝的恩典中。
Where he could live in god's grace again.

20
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,877
就这样，尤金五岁的时候，
And just like that, when Eugene was five years old,

21
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,428
-他失去了父亲。-你就这么走了?
- he lost his father. - You're just leaving?

22
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,936
一种会困扰他余生的缺失被创造出来。
An absence was created that would haunt him for the rest of his life.

23
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,525
尤金只收到过父亲寄来的一张明信片。
Eugene only ever got one postcard from his father.

24
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,275
在信中，约翰声称他发现了上帝之眼
In it, John claimed he had found the eye of god

25
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,402
在地球上最美丽的地方，
in the most beautiful place on earth,

26
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,826
墨西哥的墨西哥湾海岸。
the Gulf coast of Mexico.

27
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,249
奥利维亚很快就试图填补尤金生命中的空白，
Olivia quickly tried to fill that absence in Eugene's life,

28
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,202
一年后，她嫁给了乔治·埃文斯，
and a year later she married George Evans,

29
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,459
一个县代表，一个农民，还有我父亲。
a county deputy, farmer and my father.

30
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,334
但约翰·贝克和他所描写的世界
But John baker and the world he wrote about

31
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,544
都在我哥哥的脑海里挥之不去。
were never far from my brother's mind.

32
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,974
他想知道父亲在那里究竟发现了什么。
He wondered what his father had really found out there.

33
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,806
当尤金17岁的时候，
Then, when Eugene was 17,

34
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,142
别的事情引起了他的注意。
something else took his attention.

35
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,651
是我们所有人的。
All of ours, for that matter.

36
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,493
正如约翰所说的诅咒，这片土地背叛了我们。
Just like the curse John had spoken of, the land turned on us.

37
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,623
我的美国同胞们，我到过9个州。
My fellow Americans, I have been on a journey to nine states.

38
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,205
第一年就有14场风暴袭击了俾斯麦。
Fourteen storms hit bismark in the first year.

39
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,462
我看到一群失去了小麦的家庭，
I saw a group of families who had lost their wheat crops,

40
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,293
失去了玉米作物，
lost their corn crops,

41
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,504
面对一个没有食物的冬天。
facing a winter without food.

42
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,090
我们越想重新开始，他们的情况就越糟。
The more we tried fo start over, the worse they got.

43
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,517
于是银行就来抢俾斯麦。
And the banks came for bismark.

44
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,433
疯狂的传教士会尖叫着上帝和救赎……
Crazy preachers would scream about god and salvation...

45
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,188
当家庭做他们唯一能做的事时…
While families did the only thing they still could...

46
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,608
直到他们再也不能那样做了。
Until they couldn't even do that anymore.

47
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,993
尤金躲在家里废弃的谷仓里。
Eugene hid away in the abandoned family barn.

48
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,617
他会幻想自己的命运，
He would daydream about his destiny,

49
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,294
幻想着他的英雄们的生活…
fantasizing about a life like his heroes...

50
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,798
他读到的逃犯和冒险家。
The outlaws and adventurers he read about.

51
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,217
菲比，回来!
Phoebe, come back here!

52
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:30,142
我想没人警告过尤金会发生什么
I suppose no one warned Eugene about what can happen

53
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,061
当你梦想很多的时候。
when you dream about something so much.

54
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,689
Allison Wells就是这样进入这个故事的…
That's how Allison Wells entered this story...

55
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,944
就像从地狱飞来的蝙蝠…
Like a bat out of hell...

56
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,538
领导直…
Headed straight...

57
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,409
为我的弟弟。
For my brother.

58
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,767
给我设个路障，好吗?
Roadblock for me, would you?

59
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,538
看看这个冷酷的混蛋。
Look at this cold bastard.

60
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,080
如果他是真的，我打赌他每晚都会和不同的女人上床。
I bet he'd be in bed with a different broad every night if he were real.

61
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,917
我打赌他知道该对一个女孩说什么让她发疯。
I bet he knows exactly the right thing to say to a girl to make her crazy.

62
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,344
这就是一切，真的…单词。
That's all it takes really... words.

63
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,513
除非你住在这样一个死气沉沉的老城区。
Unless you live in a dead old town like this.

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,056
阿门。
Amen to that.

65
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,177
嘿，怎么了?
Hey, what's going on?

66
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,308
哈罗德，他会告诉你的。
Harold, he'll tell you all about it.

67
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,434
检查一下吗?
Check it out?

68
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,312
好了，伙计们，我们有话要说。
All right, folks, we got some things need to be said.

69
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,686
所以，你们都安静下来，好让他们听到。
So, y'all quiet down now so they can be heard.

70
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,941
马萨那m ?
Ma'a m?

71
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,444
在突袭密苏里州一家银行时，
During their raid on a Missouri bank,

72
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,202
那个小偷杀人犯艾莉森·威尔斯
the thief and murderer, Allison Wells,

73
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,746
把一个九岁的小女孩送上了天堂。
sent a nine-year-old little girl to heaven.

74
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,411
九岁。
Nine years old.

75
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,414
而那只是五个灵魂中的一个
And that was just one of five human souls

76
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,166
是那天拍的
that were taken on that day.

77
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,717
如果你看到这个女人，不要和她对质。
If you see this woman, do not confront her.

78
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,634
她会毫不犹豫地再杀一个人。
She will not hesitate to take another life.

79
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,557
现在，总的来说，她只是个小女人
Now, all and all, she's just one little lady

80
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,306
德州一半的执法人员都在找她。
with half the Texas law enforcement trying to find her.

81
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,850
我们会找到她的。
And find her we shall.

82
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,603
这个奖励是真的吗?
Is this real, this reward?

83
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,025
如果我们找到她就给你一万美元?
Ten thousand dollars if we find her?

84
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,189
你是埃文斯警官的儿子，对吧?
You're deputy Evans' boy, ain't you?

85
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,904
是的，先生，他是我的继父。
Yes, sir. He's my stepfather.

86
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,945
很感谢你的关心，儿子
Well, I appreciate your interest, son,

87
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,907
但我们已经从埃文斯家族那里得到了所有需要的帮助，
but we've already got all the help we need from the Evans family,

88
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,491
所以赶紧回家吧。
so just run on home.

89
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,830
礼拜结束后在教堂聚会。
Search party meeting at church after the service.

90
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,507
上帝和巧合
God and coincidence

91
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,210
不能占据同一个地球。
cannot occupy the same earth.

92
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,136
女士们先生们，我们知道，
We know this, ladies and gentlemen,

93
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:16,136
因为哪里有神迹，哪里就有上帝的手。
for where there is a sign, there is the hand of god.

94
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,890
我们的社区现在都在他的掌控之下。
And our community is under his palm now.

95
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,312
现在我们知道为什么了……
And now we see why...

96
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,682
像艾莉森·威尔斯这样的女人…
Women like Allison Wells...

97
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,273
尤金。
Eugene.

98
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,992
一个阻力。
What a drag.

99
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,408
准备好了吗?
Ready to go?

100
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,330
尤金?
Eugene?

101
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,579
嗨,乔。
Hey, Joe.

102
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,834
-我希望你今天在家。——为什么?
- I want you at home today. - Why?

103
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:50,838
威尔斯女士还逍遥法外，这里不安全。
With that Wells lady on the loose, it's not safe around these parts.

104
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,888
我们和搜救队一起去，妈。我们将是安全的。
We're going with the search party, ma. We'll be safe.

105
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,555
我们会互相照顾的，好吗?我向你保证。
We'll look after each other, all right? You have my word.

106
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,845
在天黑前回家。
Home by dark.

107
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,851
——是的,女士。-团结在一起。
- Yes, ma'am. - And stick together.

108
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,022
给我。
Give me that.

109
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,476
-我能去吗?-不，你不能。
- Can I come? - No, you cannot.

110
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,106
被黑了。是的。
By dark. Yeah.

111
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,856
你能想象有那么多钱吗?
Can you even imagine having that much money?

112
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,075
我当然可以。你不能吗?
I sure as hell can. Can't you?

113
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,652
不,不是真的。
No, not really.

114
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,454
我打赌你也不能。
I bet you actually can't neither.

115
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,199
战斗的话,埃文斯。
Fighting words, Evans.

116
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,785
你最好把你的那份给我，这样我就不会揍你了。
Hell, you best give me your share so as I don't whup ya.

117
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,838
在你鞭打我之前，我会笑死的，孩子。
I will die of laughing before you whip me, boy.

118
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,633
你觉得我们会发现她死了吗?
Think we'll find her dead?

119
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,348
我不知道。可能。
I don't know. Probably.

120
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,560
你没事吧?
You okay?

121
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,023
-嘿?有什么事吗?——什么都没有。
- Hey? What's the matter? - Nothing.

122
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,529
来吧，告诉我。有什么事吗?
Come on, tell me. What's up?

123
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,443
我们要去加利福尼亚。
We're going to California.

124
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,497
他们今天早上告诉我们的。
They told us this morning.

125
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,954
说我们要放弃德州了。
Said we are giving up on Texas.

126
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:07,998
他妈的,人。
Shit, man.

127
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,997
你要去多久?
How long you going for?

128
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,506
好吧,永远。
Well, forever.

129
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,881
想想看，我们为什么要回来呢?
When you think about it, why would we come back?

130
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,101
是的。
Yeah.

131
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,941
看来你得找别人抱怨了。
Guess you'll have to find someone else to bitch to.

132
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,895
我最愿意向你发牢骚了，加尔萨。
Ain't no one I'd rather bitch to than you, garza.

133
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,904
-你能搞定吗?-放开我，你这个混蛋!
- Can you handle that? - Let go, you jackass!

134
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,860
不。我得在你走之前把它放进去。
No. I gotta get it in before you go.

135
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,320
是的。
Yeah.

136
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,201
来给我!来给我!
Come get me! Come get me!

137
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,328
我会想你的，伙计。
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

138
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,202
来吧!来吧!
Come on! Come on!

139
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,412
我们走吧!
Let's go!

140
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,253
你打算怎么办?
What you gonna do?

141
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,429
我比你快，孩子。
I'm faster than you, boy.

142
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,010
我一直都是。
I always have been.

143
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,402
你真觉得我们能在这里面找到她吗?
You really think we're going to find her in all this?

144
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,867
值得一试。
It's worth a try.

145
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,804
我说的是“天黑之前。”
I said "before dark."

146
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,804
乔治想和你谈谈。
George wants to talk to you.

147
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,510
你就有麻烦了。
You're in trouble.

148
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,431
我会满足他的要求。
I'll do his request.

149
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,452
你找我?
You wanted to see me?

150
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,504
一个母亲的话语……是法律。
A mother's word... is law.

151
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,259
当母亲让儿子去做某件事时，他就去做。
When a mother tells a son to do something, he does it.

152
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,007
总是这样。
Always.

153
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,301
这就是家庭的运作方式。
That's how families work.

154
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,515
好时光和坏时光。
Good times and bad.

155
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,726
我们能互相理解吗?
We understand each other?

156
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,518
是的…是的,先生。
Yeah... yes, sir.

157
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,731
你拿的是什么?
What you got there?

158
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,196
什么都没有。
Nothing.

159
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,367
帮我们俩个忙。
Do us both a favor.

160
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,162
别装得好像你觉得我很蠢似的。
Don't act like you think I'm stupid.

161
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:01,836
你从哪份工作拿了多少钱买这些垃圾?
What money from what job did you pay for that garbage?

162
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,598
你妈妈可能会轻易放过你，但我不能。
See, your mother may let you off easy, but I can't.

163
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,428
这个家再也容不下男孩了。
There's no room for boys in this family anymore.

164
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,680
想一想。
Think about that.

165
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:17,945
洗了。
Wash up.

166
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,754
熄灯。
Lights out.

167
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,398
别出声。
Don't make a sound.

168
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,644
不!
Don't!

169
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,673
如果你想要，它就是你的。
It's yours if you want it.

170
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,927
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

171
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,435
——我是艾莉森。-我知道你是谁。
- I'm Allison. - I know who you are.

172
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,693
那我应该知道你是谁。
Well, then it's only fair that I know who you are.

173
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,241
尤金。
Eugene.

174
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,028
尤金。
Eugene.

175
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,286
这是个聪明的名字。
That's a smart name.

176
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,374
不是,你呢?
Ain't that you?

177
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,422
-他们说你是个杀手-我不是杀人犯。
- They said you was a killer. - I'm not a killer.

178
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,887
尤金·…
Eugene...

179
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,061
我跟你实话实说。
I'm gonna be real frank with you.

180
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,271
我尽量保持镇静
I'm trying to maintain composure,

181
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,726
但我腿上的这个洞现在疼得要命。
but this hole in my leg is hurting like a motherfucker right now.

182
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,231
所以，如果你帮我，我会告诉你一切。
So, if you help me, I'll tell you everything.

183
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,566
听我的。尤金，听我说。
Listen to me. Eugene, listen to me.

184
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,411
我不是杀手。
I'm not a killer.

185
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,789
你还是不相信我的故事。
You still wouldn't believe my story.

186
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,713
就像这些书中的一本。
Just like one of these books.

187
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,761
除了我是戴帽子的那个人。
Except I'm the man in the hat.

188
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,226
哇。不坏。
Wow. Not bad.

189
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,398
好吧。
All right.

190
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,109
哦,耶稣。
Oh, Jesus.

191
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,819
看起来比实际情况更糟。
Looks worse than it is.

192
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,955
好吧。你的手稳吗，孩子?
All right. Got steady hands, kid?

193
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,828
我觉得你应该去看医生什么的。
I think you should see a doctor or something.

194
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,205
不,不,不。你现在是我的医生了，好吗?
No, no, no. You're my doctor now, okay?

195
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,332
尤金博士。
Dr. Eugene.

196
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,964
——好吗?——好的。
- Okay? - Okay.

197
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,626
好吧。用那个洗干净你的手。
Okay. Clean your hands with that.

198
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,017
一切都会没事的，好吗?
Everything's gonna be fine, all right?

199
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,312
好吧。镊子。清洁它们。
Okay. Get the tweezers. Clean them.

200
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,645
好吧。
Okay.

201
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,854
你确定你没杀人吗?
You sure you didn't kill nobody?

202
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,745
不。
No.

203
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,412
——好的。——好的。
- Okay. - All right.

204
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,503
得到了……
Get the...

205
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:49,377
首先是酒精，然后直接砸上去。全部倒在上面。
First the alcohol, then right smack on it. Just pour it all on.

206
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,337
神圣的狗屎!
Holy shit!

207
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,552
神圣的狗屎!
Holy shit!

208
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,395
好吧。把手电筒给我。
Okay. Give me the flashlight.

209
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,473
好吧。
Okay.

210
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,475
你能看到子弹吗?
Can you see the bullet?

211
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,236
是的。我想是的。
Yeah. I think so.

212
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,483
好吧，把它拿出来。
Okay, take it out.

213
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,191
没关系。
It's okay.

214
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,451
好吧。
Okay.

215
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,738
想点好东西。
Think of something nice.

216
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,292
好吧。好吧。
Okay. Okay.

217
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,514
好吧。
Okay.

218
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,148
好吧。
Okay.

219
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,404
好吧。绷带。
Okay. Bandage it up.

220
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,489
-好的，我会坚持住的。是的。——持有它。
- Okay, I'll hold it on. Yeah. - Hold it.

221
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,538
好吧。
Okay.

222
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,805
你没事吧?
You okay?

223
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,842
是的。
Yeah.

224
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,716
这感觉很好。
It feels good.

225
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,592
这是惊人的。
That was amazing.

226
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,303
你渴了吗?
You thirsty?

227
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,434
而且他还会读心术。
And he's a mind reader too.

228
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,650
我马上回来。
I'll be right back.

229
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,402
根据速率，
As rate would have it,

230
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:43,156
一年前，艾利森在密苏里州失去了自己的家庭和农场。
Allison had lost her own family and farm in Missouri one year previous.

231
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,239
她的父母都死于肺炎。
Her mother and father had both succumbed fo pneumonia.

232
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,540
我并不想说艾莉森·威尔斯是个骗子，
Now, I have no intention of painting Allison Wells as a liar,

233
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,791
当别人有,
as others have,

234
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,373
但是我会说
but I will say

235
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,084
她知道她的听众是谁
she understood who her audience was

236
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,545
于是她把自己的故事讲了出来。
and told her story accordingly.

237
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,048
你多大了?
How old are you?

238
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:07,809
25岁。
Twenty-five.

239
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,609
你有女朋友了吗，25号先生?
You got a girlfriend, Mr. twenty-five?

240
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,159
嗯…公园你自己。
Well... park yourself.

241
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,786
我想我应该解释一下。
I guess I should explain things.

242
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,833
我很感激你的谨慎，孩子，但是…
I appreciate your caution, kid, but...

243
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,007
现在，如果你愿意，你可以把我劈成两半。
Right now, if you wanted, you could break me in two.

244
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,069
我的确抢了那家银行。
It's true I robbed that bank.

245
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,942
这不是第一次。
And it wasn't the first.

246
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,617
我从没杀过人。
I never killed anybody.

247
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,961
如果不是你，那是谁干的?
Well, if you didn't, then who did?

248
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,087
根据艾莉森那晚告诉尤金的故事，
According to the story Allison told Eugene that night,

249
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,214
她是整件事的受害者。
she was the victim of this whole affair.

250
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,967
在她的土地被夺走，她的家人去世后，
After her land was taken and her family passed,

251
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,889
她成了一个不法之徒。
she became an outlaw.

252
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,639
这是她拿回东西的唯一方法。
It was her only way of taking something back.

253
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,349
这让她参与了格思里平原银行抢劫案。
Which brought her fo the Guthrie plains bank robbery.

254
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,230
这已经是她那个月第四次抢劫了，
It had been her fourth robbery that month,

255
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,028
但这是第一次有人丧生。
but it was the first with any loss of life.

256
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,825
她坚持认为，这件事完全是警察的错。
A fact, she insisted, was solely the police's fault.

257
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,617
那些警察，他们吓坏了。
Those cops, they got scared.

258
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,071
我们从银行出来的那一刻，他们就开火了。
The second we came out of that bank, they started firing.

259
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,166
不管大街上还是人行道上都有人。
Didn't matter that there was still people on the street and in the sidewalk.

260
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,873
她声称的是一颗来自警方的流弹
Her claim was a stray bullet from the police

261
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,504
结束了那个无辜女孩的生命。
ended the life of that innocent little girl.

262
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,684
这句话直接出自尤金的一个故事。
It was straight out of one of Eugene's stories.

263
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,770
他们找我。
They're hunting me.

264
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,774
她从夺走了一切的世界里偷回了记忆
Her stealing back the memory from a world that had taken everything

265
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,070
什么都没给她留下并没有人。
and left her with nothing... and no one.

266
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,244
这就是我需要你的原因，因为我没有别人了。
That's why I need you, 'cause I don't have anyone else.

267
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,250
你想住多久就住多久。
You can stay here as long as you need a room.

268
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,586
-只要你愿意。——谢谢。
- As long as you want. - Thank you.

269
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,089
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

270
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,466
没关系。
It's okay.

271
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,181
恐怕我得要求你比我认为合理的还要多。
Afraid I'm gonna have to ask you for more than I know is fair.

272
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,267
帮我去墨西哥对你来说值多少钱?
How much would it be worth to you to help me get to Mexico?

273
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,149
墨西哥吗?
Mexico?

274
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,572
2万美元怎么样?
How does $20,000 sound?

275
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,358
那是你赏金的两倍。
That's double your bounty.

276
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,989
这正是问题的关键。
That's the point.

277
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,911
你身上有那么多钱吗?
You got that much on you?

278
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,784
我一分钱都没有。
I don't have a nickel.

279
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,332
但我对银行很熟悉，即使是墨西哥的银行。
But I know my way around a bank, even a Mexican one.

280
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,411
我可以在你知道我走之前把钱给你。
And I can have you that money before you even know I'm gone.

281
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,340
你只要给我弄辆车就行了。
All you need to do is get me a car.

282
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,841
在这可真不容易。
Well, that ain't an easy thing to get around here.

283
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,638
尤其是钱包空空的时候。
Especially with an empty wallet.

284
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,432
也许我错了，但你看起来是个很能干的人。
Maybe I'm wrong, but you seem like a pretty capable fella.

285
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,223
我需要休息几天。
I need a few days to rest up.

286
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,098
如果你在这段时间里专注于我们的问题，
And if you apply yourself to our problem between now and then,

287
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,479
那我得说我们已经成交了，你说呢?
then I'd say we're in business, wouldn't you?

288
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,068
我看过你的田地，尤金。
I've seen your fields, Eugene.

289
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,245
我知道你的家庭有麻烦了，就像我的家庭一样。
I know your family's in trouble, same as mine was.

290
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,415
我是说，如果有更简单的方法来解决你的问题，
I mean, if there's a simpler way to fix things for you,

291
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,458
我一点也不知道那是什么。
I don't have the faintest what that would be.

292
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:04,956
我可以告发你。
I could turn you in.

293
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,352
确定。你可以。
Sure. You could.

294
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,395
但是，尤金，我说这话的时候非常认真和真诚。
But, Eugene, and I say this with all seriousness and sincerity.

295
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,490
如果这是你的选择，也是你的选择，
If that's the choice you make, and it is your choice to make,

296
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,739
不要对后果抱有幻想。
have no illusions of the consequences.

297
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,992
我不想再成为他们谎言的受害者。
I won't be another victim of their lies.

298
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,283
我宁愿死在自己手上。
I'd rather die by my own hand.

299
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,120
或者你的。
Or yours.

300
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,014
这是一片充满负担的土地，孩子。
This is a land of burden, kid.

301
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,726
现在，你可以选择你的。
Right now, you get to pick yours.

302
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,731
让你成为幸运儿之一。
Makes you one of the lucky ones.

303
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,429
你为什么光着身子?
Why are you naked?

304
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,311
好的,但是……这到底是怎么回事?
Okay, but... what the hell?

305
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,894
别担心，好吗?不要发誓。
Don't worry about it, okay? And don't swear.

306
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,399
我不是担心。我很好奇。
I ain't worried. I'm curious.

307
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,696
不要。
Don't be.

308
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,240
好了，继续睡吧。来吧。
All right, just go back to sleep. Come on.

309
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:24,015
你今天要进城。找点活干。
You're heading into town today. Look for some work.

310
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,391
带上你的妹妹。
Take your sister with you.

311
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,268
是的,先生。
Yes, sir, okay.

312
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,274
和齿轮。
And gear up.

313
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,860
他们说今天风很大。
They're saying it's a windy one.

314
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,594
嘿。
Hey.

315
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,772
-嗨。-我想你可能想换衣服。
- Hi. - I thought you might want to change.

316
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,986
它是完美的。
It's perfect.

317
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,827
我希望它合身。这是我的母亲的。
I hope it fits okay. It's my mother's.

318
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,786
她不常戴，所以她不应该发现它不见了。
She don't wear it much, so she shouldn't notice it's gone.

319
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,160
她会注意到的。
She'll notice.

320
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,791
也许她会来这里找。
Maybe she'll come in here looking for it.

321
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,585
在这里,什么?不,不。
What, in here? No, no.

322
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,463
自从干旱开始，他们就没什么用了。
They ain't got much use for this since the drought started.

323
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,721
好吧。谢谢你！
Okay. Thank you.

324
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,602
哦,对不起。
Oh, excuse me.

325
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,259
-你在看什么?——什么都没有。
- What are you looking at? - Nothing.

326
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,746
你应该带我去镇上的。
You're supposed to take me to town.

327
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,637
-是的，我很忙。——你不是。
- Yeah, well, I'm busy. - You ain't.

328
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,181
——我。-你在看什么?
- I am. - What were you looking at?

329
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,664
什么都没有。我只是想看看里面是什么样子，仅此而已。
Nothing. I was just seeing how it looked in there, that's all.

330
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,888
我不是愚蠢的。在那里是什么?
I ain't dumb. What's in there?

331
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,100
里面什么都没有。基督!
Ain't nothing in there. Christ!

332
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,610
好吧，如果你答应我，我就告诉你
Okay, I'll tell you if you promise me

333
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,938
你不会自己进去找的。
you ain't gonna go in there and look for yourself.

334
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,149
在我打扫干净之前，我不想让妈妈或乔治进去。
I don't want mama or George going in there until I clean it up.

335
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,484
清理什么?
Clean up what?

336
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,579
你的承诺吗?
You promise?

337
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,199
是的,告诉我。
Yeah, tell me.

338
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:56,130
两个死狗。他们的血和内脏都躺在地上。
Two dead dogs. Lying there with their blood and their guts all in the dirt.

339
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,043
苍蝇。
Flies all around.

340
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,425
狗?谁的狗?
Dogs? Whose dogs?

341
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,802
没有人的。
Nobody's.

342
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,130
蓝色那边的。
The blue yonder's.

343
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,469
什么杀了他们?
What killed 'em?

344
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,259
土狼什么的。我怎么知道?
Coyotes or something. How should I know?

345
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,265
这是可悲的。
That's sad.

346
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:12,979
这就是生活。
That's life.

347
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,066
等等，你现在要去哪?
Wait, where you going now?

348
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,609
去见乔·加尔萨。
Going to meet Joe garza.

349
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,733
——怎么样?我可以来吗?-没有，也没有。
- What about? Can I come? - Nothing and no.

350
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,824
嘿,尤金。
Hey, Eugene.

351
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,863
你为什么把我拖到这里来，埃文斯?
Why the hell you drag me out here, Evans?

352
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,792
我有话跟你说，加尔萨。
I got some private words for you, garza.

353
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,468
我以为我们今天要去找那个女人。
You know, I thought we was gonna look for that woman today.

354
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,846
所以我一大早就起床了。
So I got up butt-crack of dawn.

355
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,470
然后你就不出现了。
And then you don't even show.

356
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,930
现在这个。
Now this.

357
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,015
我认识你多久了?
How long have I known you?

358
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,395
-年复一年，据我所知。-你在我身边。
- Years and years, by my count. - You stand by me.

359
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,562
这些年来，我一直信任你。
And in those years, I've gone and trusted you.

360
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,655
好吧?这就是为什么我要问的问题可能看起来不公平，
Okay? And that's why what I'm about to ask might seem unfair,

361
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,827
但这能救我们俩的命。
but it could save both our necks.

362
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,449
吐出来。
Spit it out.

363
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,167
我需要你们家的卡车…
I need your family's truck...

364
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:20,960
为好。
For good.

365
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,376
我一到墨西哥就给你汇钱。
I'll send you the money as soon as I get to Mexico.

366
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,672
你在耍我吗，尤金?
You getting stupid on me, Eugene?

367
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,726
我们下周将乘坐它出发。这到底是怎么回事?
We are leaving in it next week. What the hell's going on?

368
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,726
我现在不能告诉你一切，但我遇到了一个人。
I can't tell you everything right now, but I've met somebody.

369
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,229
他们会付我两万让我把他们带到墨西哥。
And they're gonna pay me 20,000 to get them to Mexico.

370
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,934
二万年!你相信吗?
Twenty-thousand! Do you believe it?

371
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,358
不，埃文斯，我不知道。
No, Evans, I don't.

372
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,819
就算我知道，我也会叫你吃只癞蛤蟆。
And even if I did, shit, I'd tell you to eat a toad.

373
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,370
如果你说的和我想的一样，
If you're saying what I think you're saying,

374
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,243
那我说出来会让我死的。
then me just saying it could wind me dead.

375
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,949
不,不,不。没人会死的。
No, no, no. No one's gonna wind dead.

376
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,160
他们已经把我赶出城够多了。
They're chasing me out of town enough as it is.

377
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,162
想象。
Imagine.

378
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,794
一个杀人的白人女人?
A murdering white lady too?

379
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,459
两个死狗。
Two dead dogs.

380
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,463
晚餐时间。
Dinnertime.

381
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,342
怎么了?
What's wrong?

382
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,256
汽车方面有什么进展吗?
Any luck with the automobile?

383
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,591
不,还没有。我仍然尝试。
No, not yet. I'm still trying.

384
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,586
你要告诉我你怎么了吗?
Are you gonna tell me what's eating you?

385
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,645
我得离开这里，尤金!
I need to get out of here, Eugene!

386
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,780
是的，我知道。
Yeah, I know that.

387
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,817
-发生什么事了吗?——没有。
- Did something happen? - No.

388
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,952
可能的东西。
Something could.

389
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,701
我在这里不安全。
It's not safe, me being here.

390
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,702
这对任何人都不安全。
It's not safe for anyone.

391
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,208
是的,我知道。
Yeah, I know.

392
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,796
只是…
Just...

393
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,716
我都快疯了。我关了。
I'm going crazy in here. I'm cooped up.

394
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,544
我受伤。我是肮脏的。
I'm hurt. I'm dirty.

395
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,800
-是的。-对不起，我没…
- Yeah. - I'm sorry, I didn't...

396
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,552
我不是故意吼你的。
I didn't mean to yell at you.

397
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,304
对不起。
Sorry.

398
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,522
我刚想到了一个能让你开心起来的办法。
I may have just thought of something that will cheer you up.

399
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,524
那是什么?
What's that?

400
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,499
你可以在这里洗。
You can wash here.

401
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,328
这是一个干净的可游泳的湖。
This is a clean swimming lake.

402
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,546
房子被遗弃了，所以我们很安全。
Property's abandoned, so we're safe.

403
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,928
我们可以给你洗腿，然后包扎一下。你觉得怎么样?
We can clean your leg and then dress it after. How about that?

404
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,225
那好吧。
All right then.

405
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,582
我们五分钟后出发。
We're leaving in five minutes.

406
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,592
嘿，那是以后的事。
Hey, that's for later.

407
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,889
我无法抗拒。
I couldn't resist.

408
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,091
坐下来。
Sit down.

409
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,144
尤金在哪里?
Where is Eugene?

410
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,563
我想念我的蓝裙子。你在哪儿见过吗?
I'm missing my blue dress. Have you seen it anywhere?

411
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,394
不,妈妈。
No, mama.

412
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,100
喂?
Hello?

413
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,811
有人听到我吗?我说，那孩子在哪儿?
Anyone hear me? I said, where is the boy?

414
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,612
他和乔出去找工作了。
Him and Joe was out looking for work.

415
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,318
他说是你让他这么做的。他说会在那里和我们会合。
He said you told him to. Said he's going to meet us there.

416
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,379
你的鞋子在哪里?
Where are your shoes?

417
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,128
我一定要穿吗?
Do I have to wear them?

418
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,674
是的。来吧。
Yes. Come on.

419
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,103
你好。
Hello.

420
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,979
晚上。
Evening.

421
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,979
你在盯着看什么?
What are you staring at?

422
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,864
哦,没什么。我是……
Oh, nothing. I was...

423
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,489
我只是想起了我父亲。
I was just thinking about my father.

424
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:09,115
我很小的时候，他带我来过这里游泳。
He took me swimming here once when I was real little.

425
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,617
我直到现在才忘记这件事。
I'd forgotten about it until just now.

426
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,122
他已经不在了。
He ain't around anymore.

427
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,455
你一定很想他吧?
You must miss him pretty bad, huh?

428
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,335
是的，我想是的。
Yeah, I suppose so.

429
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,633
当我想知道我想念他什么时，我什么都想不起来。
When I wonder what I miss about him, I can't think of nothin'.

430
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,802
我就是想不起来了。
You know, I just can't remember.

431
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,640
这很有趣。
It's funny.

432
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,686
你明白吗?
Do you ever get that?

433
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,897
你知道死亡最糟糕的是什么吗，孩子?
You know what the worst part of dying is, kid?

434
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,819
我没说他死了。
I didn't say he was dead.

435
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,902
但是…
But...

436
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,865
等你不再说什么"孩子"了，你可以告诉我。
When you quit it with all this "kid" crap, you can tell me.

437
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,740
你不喜欢我叫你孩子吗?
You don't like it when I call you kid?

438
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,379
不。
No.

439
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,085
我很抱歉。我不是那个意思。我不是说你像个孩子一样。
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I didn't mean it like you're a kid.

440
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,543
我的意思是…比利小子。
I meant it like... Billy the kid.

441
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,879
你认识他吗?
You know him?

442
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,135
取缔。的神话。
The outlaw. The myth.

443
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,137
是的，我认识他，但我…
Yeah, I know him, but I...

444
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,685
我都不喜欢。
I don't like it either way.

445
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,558
为什么呢?
And why is that?

446
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,890
因为这有什么好吹嘘的
Well, 'cause what's the big hoopla about some dummy

447
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,226
还没到307岁就死了?
that got himself killed before the age of 307?

448
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,695
这和他什么时候死无关。
This ain't about when he died.

449
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,613
关键是他能活多久。
It's about how long he'll live.

450
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,332
你看，死亡最可怕的部分是…
You see, the worst part of dying...

451
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,293
被遗忘了。
Is being forgotten.

452
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,298
这就是我喜欢比利的原因。
That's why I like Billy.

453
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,306
因为尽管他不到30岁就死了
'Cause even though he died before 30,

454
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,598
每隔几年就有人说见过他。
every couple of years someone claims to have seen him.

455
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,355
你知道的，在杂货店或是在货车上。
You know, at the groceries or riding a freight train.

456
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,691
他就像时间里的幽灵。
He's like a ghost out of time.

457
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,570
你看，如果人们还想让你活下去你就不会死。
You see, you can't really die if people still want you to live.

458
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,117
至少不是任何有意义的方式。
Not in any meaningful way, at least.

459
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,332
——嘿!你!-你不是说这地方很安全吗
- Hey! You! - I thought you said this place was safe.

460
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,547
——该死的!-他现在应该离开这片土地了。
- Damn it! - He's supposed to be off this land by now.

461
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,129
直到下个月的第一天，这里还是我的地盘!
This is still my land until the first of next month!

462
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,464
大便。
Shit.

463
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,425
走,走,走。走吧!
Go, go, go. Go!

464
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,355
我想他没看见。我们要……
I don't think he saw. We got to...

465
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,331
嘿。
Hey.

466
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,912
你看到我弟弟了吗?
Have you seen my brother?

467
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,218
我能抽根烟吗，先生?
Can I pinch a smoke, please, sir?

468
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,465
有火吗?是的。
You got a light? Yeah.

469
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,675
谢谢您,先生。
Thank you, sir.

470
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:13,692
我跟你说，他们应该派人去搜寻。
I'm telling you, they should be sending out search parties still.

471
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,993
她伤成那样肯定还在这里。
Damn sure she's still here with a wound like that.

472
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,573
我希望如此。
I hope so.

473
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,205
小小的兴奋不会伤害任何人。
A little excitement never hurt no one.

474
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,503
小小的兴奋又不会伤害任何人，对吧?
A little excitement never hurt no one, huh?

475
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,956
你看到证据了吗，Ernie?
You seen the evidence, Ernie?

476
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,291
不，我只是说说而已。
Nah, I'm just saying.

477
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,841
嗯,我有。
Well, I have.

478
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,836
这一切。
All of it.

479
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,384
我告诉你。
And let me tell you something.

480
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,096
她不会不留目击者的。
She don't tend to leave no witnesses.

481
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,979
你听到哈特威尔在里面说的话了吗?
You hear Hartwell talking in there?

482
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,810
他说他几个小时前才见过她。
He said he saw her just a couple hours ago.

483
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,354
在他的湖里游泳。
Swimming in that lake of his.

484
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,399
每个人都说见过她。
Everybody keeps claiming they've seen her.

485
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,951
所以我们要召集所有的农民，
That's why we gotta get all the farmers together,

486
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,744
我们得搜索。
and we got to search.

487
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,448
分配赏金并不能拯救所有人，
Splitting the bounty won't save everyone,

488
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,453
但有些人会的，厄尼。
but it will some of us, Ernie.

489
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,788
我跟艾瑟尔说我会和她一起跳舞。
I told Ethel I'd dance with her to this one.

490
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,105
这是我的女孩。
There's my girl.

491
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,649
你要和你爸跳舞吗?
You gonna dance with your pa?

492
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,994
我们走吧，小姐?
Shall we, little lady?

493
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,159
来吧,亲爱的。
Come on, honey.

494
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,570
你可能是我见过最厉害的小偷了。
You might be the worst damn thief I think I've ever seen.

495
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,151
该死，加尔萨，你差点让我心脏病发。
Shit, garza, you almost gave me a coronary.

496
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,784
-快跑，好吗?-你以为我在干什么?
- Run a block, would you? - Hell you think I'm doing?

497
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,742
如果不是我，你爸早就在大庭广众之下揍你了。
Your daddy would've beat your ass in public already if it weren't for me.

498
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,418
他不是我爸爸。
He ain't my daddy.

499
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,540
宾果。
Bingo.

500
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,839
你在搞什么鬼，尤金·埃文斯。
You are up to some fishy shit, Eugene Evans.

501
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,917
是啊，你根本不知道。
Yeah, you have no idea.

502
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,884
骑自行车来这儿?
Ride your bike here?

503
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,402
坐下来。来吧。
Sit down. Come on.

504
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,126
打它!
Punch it!

505
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,871
你不应该在这里的。
You ain't supposed to be in here.

506
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,081
对不起,先生。
I'm sorry, sir.

507
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:24,465
我只是想给我老爸买这个。
I was just getting this for my old man.

508
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,950
-他想回家看一看。-你老爸是谁?
- He wanted to take a look at it at home. - Who's your old man?

509
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,555
副埃文斯。
Deputy Evans.

510
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,806
-我有他的钥匙。-你是尤金·埃文斯?
- I have his keys. - You're Eugene Evans?

511
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,887
是的,先生。是的。
Yeah, sir. Yeah.

512
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,891
乔治知道得更多，
Well, George knows better,

513
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,819
但我知道他对我们现在所处的这一切很有意见。
but I understand he's got a bug up his ass about this whole situation we got here.

514
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,771
是的,是的。他当然有，是的。
Yeah, yeah. He sure has, yeah.

515
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,822
好吧，他需要什么就拿什么。
All right, well, take him what he needs.

516
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,401
-好的，我会的，谢谢。——好的。
- Yes, I will, sir. Thank you. - All right.

517
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,488
嘿。替我向你妈问好。
Hey. Tell your ma I say hi.

518
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,289
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

519
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,137
你找到她了，不是吗?
You found her, ain't ya?

520
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,514
井女士。
The Wells lady.

521
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,638
我不会告诉任何人的，如果你是担心这个的话。
I ain't going to tell nobody, if that's what you're worried about.

522
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,434
——你不是吗?-如果你告诉我原因就不会
- You ain't? - Not if you tell me why

523
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,985
你最近真像只鬼鬼祟祟的小癞蛤蟆。
you've been such a creeping little toad lately.

524
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,981
它是复杂的。复杂。
It's complicated. Complex.

525
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,863
我很害怕。
I'm scared.

526
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,379
我知道。
I know.

527
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,010
我也很害怕。
It scares me too.

528
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,599
一切都会没事的。我保证。
Everything's gonna be all right. I promise.

529
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,309
给我一个微笑。
Show me that smile.

530
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,859
来吧。要我送你回去吗?是的。
Come on. You want a ride back? Yeah.

531
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,152
好吧。
Okay.

532
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,319
三,二,一。
Three, two, one.

533
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,527
那晚我看到了我弟弟的变化。
I saw a change in my brother that night.

534
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,243
他眼中有一种我从未见过的决心。
There was a resolve in his eyes 1'd never seen before.

535
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:03,703
就像某种无形的东西把他和我们的世界联系起来了
Like something invisible that had tied him to our world came undone

536
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,457
引发了一系列的黄昏
and set off a series of evenis

537
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,338
那将永远改变我们家的格局。
that would change the shape of our family forever.

538
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,098
如果我认识他父亲
Maybe if I'd known his father,

539
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,145
我能认出你的表情。
I would have recognized that look.

540
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,520
警长要你去他办公室。
Sheriff wants to see you in his office.

541
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,230
我也在找他，珍妮丝。
I'm looking for him too, Janice.

542
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,861
——乔治。——怎么了?
- George. - What's up?

543
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,985
长官，她还在这里。
Sir, she is still here.

544
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,197
这是我在哈特韦尔地产边上找到的
I found that on the edge of the Hartwell property

545
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,283
在他声称见过她之后。
after he claimed that he had seen her.

546
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,994
在我们找到她之前没人是安全的。
And no one's safe until we find her.

547
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,707
在我看来，如果我们筹到赏金，
Now, the way I see it, is if we raise the bounty,

548
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,008
我们可以找到所有的农民
we could get every farmer

549
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,963
还有县里所有的农工都在追她。
and every farmhand in the county on her ass.

550
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,597
你他妈以为我带你来干什么?
What the fuck do you think I brought you in here for?

551
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,225
你让你的人晚上来偷证据
You send your boy in here at night to steal evidence

552
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,106
还指望我不炒了你吗?
and expect me not to fire your ass?

553
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,127
你去哪儿了，孩子?
Where you been, kid?

554
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,770
你对他撒了谎。
You lied about him.

555
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,982
你可能在撒谎。
You could be lying about everything.

556
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:10,831
我没有……我没跟你说他的事是因为这件事不好谈。
I didn't... I didn't tell you about him because it's hard to talk about.

557
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,000
你爱上他了吗?
Was you in love with him?

558
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,297
你是嫉妒了吗?
Are you jealous?

559
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,596
是的。
Yeah.

560
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,257
我从没见过这样的东西。
I've never seen anything like it.

561
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,345
你是对的。
You're right.

562
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,180
你在这里不安全。
It ain't safe for you here.

563
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,647
对我们所有人来说都是如此。
Or for any of us, for that matter.

564
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,318
你说2万，对吧?
You said 20,000, right?

565
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,865
给我找辆车，我就死定了。
Find me a car, and I'm history.

566
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,411
和你的家庭债务一样。
Same as your family debt.

567
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,542
哦,狗屎。乔治回来得早。
Oh, shit. George is back early.

568
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,806
警长放了我。你知道为什么吗?
Sheriff cut me loose. You know why?

569
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,980
你拿的证据在哪?
The evidence you took, where is it?

570
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,570
——这是一去不复返了。——去哪儿了?
- It's gone. - Gone where?

571
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,067
我忘了。
I forget.

572
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,451
好吧，那些都是谎言，都是瞎编的!
Okay, all that stuff was lies and made-up nonsense!

573
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,142
你凭什么认为那个女人是无辜的?
Where in god's creation you get the idea of calling that woman innocent?

574
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,157
-我知道一些事。-哦，你“知道很多事情”!
- Well, I know things. - Oh, you "know things"!

575
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,958
有其父必有其子啊，不是吗?
The apple don't fall far from the tree, now, does it?

576
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,037
满脑子都是愚蠢的想法，就像你老爸一样。
Full of foolish thoughts, like your old man.

577
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,464
也许是我把你养大的，但你绝对不是我儿子。
Well, I may have raised you, but you sure as shit ain't my son.

578
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,087
感谢上帝。
Well, thank god for that.

579
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,055
的儿子……
Son of a...

580
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,550
在哪里?
Where is it?

581
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,581
你要是像约翰·贝克那样死了你妈妈会伤心的。
You're gonna break your mama's heart when you end up dead like John baker.

582
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,812
但他没死。他在墨西哥。
But he ain't dead. He's in Mexico.

583
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,605
总有一天我会找到他。
I'm gonna find him one day.

584
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,604
确定。墨西哥。
Sure. Mexico.

585
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:42,694
从现在开始，这扇门一直开着。
And this door, from here on out, stays open.

586
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,870
大便。
Shit.

587
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,143
来吧。大便。
Come on. Shit.

588
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,474
大便。
Shit.

589
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,442
来吧。
Come on.

590
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,256
现在别停止。
Don't stop now.

591
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,839
哦,上帝。它很好。它很好。
Oh, god. It's fine. It's fine.

592
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,673
我看到了星星，艾莉森。
I'm seeing stars, Allison.

593
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,055
不。不!
No. No!

594
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,849
不，不，你能做到的。
No, no, you can make it.

595
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,306
来吧。我们能做到。来吧。
Come on. We can make it. Come on.

596
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:58,607
继续运行。
Keep running.

597
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,478
不。不。
No. No.

598
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,695
我们墨西哥见。
I'll see you in Mexico.

599
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,907
耶稣。
Jesus.

600
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,872
嗨,爸爸。
Hey, papa.

601
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,203
很高兴你回家了。
Glad you're home.

602
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,461
现在有什么问题吗?
What's wrong now?

603
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,475
不，你应该待在家里。
No, you ought to stay inside.

604
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,773
如果他藏起来了，肯定在那个谷仓里。
If he's hiding it, it's in that barn.

605
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,646
不喜欢。
Don't.

606
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,352
那个男孩需要他的妈妈。
That boy needs his mother.

607
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,233
也许他会告诉你这到底是怎么回事。
Maybe he'll tell you what the hell is going on.

608
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,104
乔治，他很抱歉。
George, he's sorry what happened.

609
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,979
但他告诉了我你做的事。
But he told me what you did.

610
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,617
我只是想帮忙。
Just trying to help.

611
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,444
帮助谁?
Help who?

612
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,988
乔治被解雇。
George was dismissed.

613
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,583
尤金，看着我。
Eugene, look at me.

614
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,625
再过一个月我们就要无家可归了。
We're less than a month away from being homeless.

615
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,461
乔治说约翰·贝克死了。
George said John baker was dead.

616
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,598
他是对的。
And he was right.

617
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:43,473
你还记得你六岁时他写给你的明信片吗?
Do you remember that postcard he wrote you when you were six?

618
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,142
我当然知道。
Of course, I do.

619
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,148
是啊，他又派来了。
Yeah, well, he sent more.

620
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,944
但第一次之后我把它们都烧了。
But I burned every one of them after the first.

621
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:59,614
每个月，他都会写信，每个月，每张卡片都比上一张差。
Every month, he'd write, and every month, each card was worse than the last.

622
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:03,326
他们会滔滔不绝地谈论上帝和人类
They'd be full of talk about god and people

623
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,833
还有他见过的奇怪的东西，但都是乱七八糟的。
and strange things he'd seen, but it was all jumbled up.

624
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:11,834
他喝得烂醉如泥，精神崩溃了。
He was drinking himself to death, and his mind was falling apart.

625
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:17,135
我不能让一个小男孩读他写的东西。
I couldn't let a little boy read what he wrote.

626
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,596
我说谎只是因为我爱你。
I only lied because I love you.

627
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:24,271
-你在骗我，妈妈。-不，尤金，我没有
- You're lying to me now, mama. - No, Eugene, I'm not.

628
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:27,725
五年后，信用卡停用了。
After five years, the cards stopped.

629
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,606
我相信那是因为他死了。
And I believe that was 'cause he died.

630
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,655
不。不，你不能肯定这一点。你不能。
No. No, you can't be sure of that. You can't.

631
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:34,742
尤金!
Eugene!

632
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,489
尤金,我…
Eugene, I...

633
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,780
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

634
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,160
哦,上帝。
Oh, god.

635
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,455
他把门关上了?
He shut that door?

636
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,706
我做到了。
I did.

637
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,638
他对自己的所作所为说了什么有意义的话吗?
He say anything meaningful about what he done?

638
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,510
不。
No.

639
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:52,109
我需要你的帮助，乔治。他哪也去不了。
I need your help with this, George. He ain't going nowhere.

640
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,538
这一天就是人们所熟知的“黑色星期天”。
That day came fo be known as "black Sunday."

641
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:10,578
这是切尔德里斯县经历过的最严重的风暴。
It was the worst storm childress county had ever seen.

642
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:18,092
对尤金来说，正是他需要的标志。
And for Eugene, just the sign he needed.

643
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,755
菲比…我离开。
Phoebe... I'm leaving.

644
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,800
好吧,我走了。我是来道别的。
Okay, I'm going. I'm here to say goodbye.

645
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:00,377
带上我吧。
Take me with you.

646
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,885
-你都不知道我们要去哪。-那不重要
- You don't even know where we're going. - That don't matter.

647
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,512
菲比，我们要去墨西哥。
Phoebe, we're going to Mexico.

648
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,595
墨西哥。我会学西班牙语，好吗?
Mexico. I'll learn Spanish, okay?

649
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,896
不。你得待在这儿。
No. You gotta stay here.

650
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,588
我要寄钱给你。我会寄很多的。
I'm gonna send money. I'm gonna send lots of it.

651
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,149
-你从哪儿弄来的钱?-那不重要，对吧?
- Where you getting money? - That don't matter, does it?

652
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,272
这是一件好事。
This is a good thing.

653
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,028
你为什么要这么做?
Why you doing this?

654
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,573
我想是因为我恋爱了。
I guess 'cause I'm in love.

655
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,784
你根本不懂什么是爱。
You don't know anything about love.

656
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,956
你不也。
You don't neither.

657
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,459
我知道如果你爱我们，你就会留下来。
I know that if you loved us, you'd stay.

658
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,791
-如果你爱我。-菲比，我真的爱你。
- If you loved me. - Phoebe, I do love you.

659
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,375
那么,留下来。
Well, then stay.

660
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,975
一会儿见。
I'll see you soon.

661
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,355
我保证。
I promise.

662
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:54,848
那就去吧。别再拖了。
Just go. Quit drawing it out.

663
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,222
整晚我都屏住呼吸……
I held my breath that whole night...

664
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,262
我想象我就是他……
And I imagined I was him...

665
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,268
父亲离开后，他躺在同一张床上。
Laying in the same bed after his father left.

666
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:48,611
风暴一过去，乔治就查看了谷仓。
Once the storm passed, George checked the barn.

667
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:52,368
但令他失望的是，他什么也没找到。
But to his disappointment, he found nothing.

668
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,574
食物准备好了。
Food's ready.

669
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,119
你能叫醒那个男孩吗?
Can you wake the boy?

670
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:11,804
基因?
Gene?

671
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,775
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

672
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,408
他和那位女士走了。
He went away with that lady.

673
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,452
女士什么?你在说什么?
What lady? What are you talking about?

674
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,825
艾莉森·威尔斯，逃犯。
Allison Wells, the fugitive.

675
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,373
你为什么这么说?
Why are you saying that?

676
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,075
因为我说的是实话。
Because I'm telling the truth.

677
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,580
该死的卡车不见了。
The damn truck's gone.

678
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:44,299
爸爸，菲比一直在说她哥哥的怪事。
Papa, Phoebe here's been saying strange things about her brother.

679
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,593
我要你告诉她那不是真的。
I want you to tell her they isn't true.

680
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,842
她都说了些什么?
What things she been saying?

681
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:53,266
她说尤金一直在帮助艾莉森·威尔斯，那个逃犯?
She says Eugene's been helping Allison Wells, the fugitive?

682
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:58,184
但这是不可能的。那只是小女孩的幻想。
But that just isn't possible. It's just a little girl's fantasy.

683
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,974
——不是吗?-不，不是。
- Isn't it? - No, it ain't.

684
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,104
菲比，你最好告诉我们他去哪了。
Phoebe, you best tell us where he's gone.

685
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,948
你不想让你弟弟受伤吧?
You don't want your brother to get hurt, now, do you?

686
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:24,589
我会想你的，但我讨厌说再见。
I'm gonna miss you, but I hate goodbyes.

687
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,737
你应该尽快靠边停车。我们不会把它引出来。
You should pull over soon. We don't draw this one out.

688
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,877
不,不,不。不会再有什么再见了。
No, no, no. There ain't gonna be any goodbyes.

689
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,678
你不必为此烦恼。
You don't gotta fret about it.

690
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,558
哦,不。孩子,没有。
Oh, no. Kid, no.

691
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,103
我要一个人去墨西哥。
I'm going to Mexico alone.

692
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:40,813
恐怕不是。
Afraid not.

693
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,640
恐怕是。
Afraid so.

694
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,564
你的家庭呢?你就这么丢下他们?
What about your family? You just gonna leave 'em?

695
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,487
你知道吗，艾莉森?
You know what, Allison?

696
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,067
我在墨西哥也有家人。
I've got family in Mexico too.

697
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,907
——你的父亲。——正确的。
- Your father. - Right.

698
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,281
约翰贝克。
John baker.

699
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,541
我该去找他了。
High damn time I track him down.

700
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,870
我觉得你不明白找到一个人的代价是什么，
I don't think you understand what it entails to find somebody,

701
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,296
更不用说在墨西哥了。
let alone in Mexico.

702
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,503
我来不来墨西哥跟你有什么关系?
What does it matter to you if I come to Mexico or not?

703
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,739
这很重要，因为你爱上了我，你希望…
It matters 'cause you're in love with me, and you expect...

704
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,128
不。不,我不是。
No. No, I ain't.

705
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,847
你知道吗，艾莉森?
You know what, Allison?

706
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:23,098
昨晚我对自己说，下地狱是不可能的
Last night I said to myself, there is no way in hell

707
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,354
你要一个人去墨西哥。
that you're going to Mexico by yourself.

708
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:27,985
没有。
There ain't.

709
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:33,192
所以，你爱不爱我已经无关紧要了。
So, whether you love me back or not is besides the point.

710
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,494
我不爱你。
I don't love you back.

711
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,867
嗯…开车要开很长时间。
Well... it's a long drive.

712
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,966
天啊，我做错什么了?
God, what did I do wrong?

713
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,760
他们是怎么相遇的?
How did they come across one another?

714
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:56,886
我不知道，但如果那个女人藏在这里的消息传出去，
I don't know, but if word gets out that that woman was hiding here,

715
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,807
也不是我带她来的
and I'm not the one to bring her in...

716
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,344
想想都让我恶心。
Makes me sick to even think about.

717
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,304
你觉得我现在在乎这些吗?
You think I care right now about any of that?

718
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,061
我儿子乔治会怎么样?
What's gonna happen to my son, George?

719
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,268
我要打给泰德，我要打给洛马克斯。
I'm calling tade, and I'm calling Lomax.

720
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,775
我们要赶在其他人之前找到他。
We're gonna find him before anyone else does.

721
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,066
塔德?乔治·埃文斯。
Tade? George Evans.

722
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,775
你还带着那把巴克枪吗?
Have you still got that buck shooter?

723
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,485
-别杀我儿子，乔治!——嘿!
- Don't shoot my son, George! - Hey!

724
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,912
在无罪释放之前，谁都别想中枪。
Ain't no one getting shot until he's free and clear.

725
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:23,454
好了，泰德，把车开过来。我的坏了。
All right, tade, bring the vehicle. Mine's on the Fritz.

726
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,834
我们可以拿到三分之一的赏金。
We stand to get a third of the bounty.

727
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,255
-那我们就留下。-把我儿子带回来，
- Then we can stay. - Just bring my son back to me,

728
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,337
或者你不用再回来了。
or you don't bother coming back.

729
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,940
该死的。
Goddamn it.

730
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,359
滚回去，你个混蛋。
Turn back, you bastard.

731
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,361
我们该怎么办，艾莉森?
What do we do, Allison?

732
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,996
你有枪吗?
Do you have the gun?

733
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,788
-不，我们不用…-拜托，告诉我你有枪。
- No, we ain't using... - Please, tell me you have the gun.

734
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,913
但我们不用它，对吧，艾莉森?
We ain't using it though, right, Allison?

735
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:13,250
除非迫不得已，但我们必须靠边停车。
Not if we don't have to, but we do have to pull over.

736
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,093
大便。
Shit.

737
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:18,263
我要报失一辆汽车。
I want to report a car stolen.

738
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:20,132
是的。
Yeah.

739
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:25,721
车牌号码是3285m8。
License plate number 3285m8.

740
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,411
有什么问题吗，先生?
What's the problem, sir?

741
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,924
问题是你开了一个停得很清楚的停车标志。
Well, the problem is you ran a clearly placed stop sign.

742
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,005
你把你的理智留在家里了吗，孩子?
You leave your good sense at home, son?

743
01:06:58,473 --> 01:06:59,929
没有,先生。
No, sir.

744
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,929
我很抱歉。当我看到停车标志的时候已经太晚了，就这样。
I'm sorry. I didn't see the stop sign till it was too late, that's all.

745
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,061
你要去哪里，为什么?
Where you headed and why?

746
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,980
我要去卢伯克。
I'm going to lubbock.

747
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,809
我要给我老爸买个零件。
Gonna pick up a part for my old man.

748
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,815
他的舵柄坏了，所以…
His tiller's broke, so...

749
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:15,906
你老爸是谁?
Who's your old man?

750
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,528
俾斯麦的约翰·贝克。
John baker of bismark.

751
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,284
不认识他。
Don't know him.

752
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,535
你知道，有个逃犯在附近。
You know, there's a fugitive about.

753
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,044
是的，我听说了。
Yeah, I heard about that.

754
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:37,501
她不是我认识的那种人，所以我没见过她。
Yeah, she ain't the kind of folk that I associate with, so I ain't seen her.

755
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,927
如果我这么做了，我一定会通知当局的。
If I do, I'll be sure to let the authorities know.

756
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:43,173
儿子，你叫什么名字?
What's your name, son?

757
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,759
我给你写张传票，然后你就可以走了。
I'm gonna write you a citation, then you're free to go.

758
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,140
嗯,尤金·贝克。
Uh, Eugene baker.

759
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:52,811
慢下来。
Slow down.

760
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,767
我会的。谢谢您,先生。
I will. Thank you, sir.

761
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,503
你他妈做到了!
You fucking did it!

762
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:15,751
这是正确的。
That's right.

763
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:19,717
好吧，也许你并不是最不适合一起旅行的人。
Well, you may not be the worst person to go on a trip with after all.

764
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,144
妈妈?
Mama?

765
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:35,771
肯定有人在照顾尤金。
Eugene has to have someone looking out for him.

766
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,443
不仅仅是爸爸。
More than just papa.

767
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,401
你在说什么?
What the hell you saying?

768
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:45,990
不，在这一切结束之前你不许出这房子一步。
No, you're not setting foot outside this house till this is over.

769
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,823
别再说这个了。回你房间去。关上门。
Not another word on that. Just go to your room. Close the door.

770
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,626
早晨,埃文斯太太。
Morning, Mrs. Evans.

771
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,379
尤金会没事的。
Eugene's going to be a-okay.

772
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,516
埃文斯。
Evans.

773
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,140
是这样吗?
Is that so?

774
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,025
哦，不，不，不。这是我的孩子。
Oh, no, no, no, no. It's just my boy.

775
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,854
对不起，搞混了。我自己来处理。
Sorry for the mix-up. I'll handle it myself.

776
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,313
我很欣赏这一点。
I appreciate that.

777
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,825
他们在斗牛士附近，往南走。
They're near matador, heading south.

778
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,490
肯定有人报告我的卡车被偷了。
Someone must've reported my truck stolen.

779
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:29,946
我们走吧,男孩。
Let's go, boys.

780
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,877
菲比?到这里来。
Phoebe? Come here.

781
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:47,722
菲比!
Phoebe!

782
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,145
菲比。
Phoebe.

783
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,272
不，不，不。不!
No, no, no, no. No!

784
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:01,944
回来!
Come back!

785
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:17,794
等我们从这些被遗弃的地方出来，你肯定不会相信绿地是什么样的。
You ain't gonna believe the green when we get out of these forsaken parts.

786
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,748
它像河流一样，滚滚而来。
There's rivers of it, just rolling and rolling.

787
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:26,211
我跟你说，那里有鲜绿色的果园…
I'm telling you, there's, like, bright green orchards...

788
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,887
明亮的蓝色水域。
Bright blue waters.

789
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,886
我以前见过树，你知道吗?
I've seen a tree before, you know?

790
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,768
是啊，你见过大海吗?
Yeah, well, have you seen the ocean?

791
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,104
不。不,我没有。
No. No, I haven't.

792
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,437
我小时候经常梦到它。
I used to dream a lot about it when I was a kid.

793
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:44,650
虽然不确定它到底应该是什么样子或感觉像什么。
Not sure exactly what it's supposed to look or feel like, though.

794
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,075
你看到了吗?
Have you seen it?

795
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,402
没有，但我以前也梦到过。
No, but I used to dream about it too.

796
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:57,284
等我们到了墨西哥，我打算撞到它那粗壮的手臂上。
I plan on running into its big, burly arms when we get to Mexico.

797
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:01,709
听起来不错。
Yeah, that sounds nice.

798
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,127
是的。
Yeah.

799
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,056
菲比。
Phoebe.

800
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,359
嗨,爸爸。
Hi, papa.

801
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,707
不。不，你应该待在这里。
No. No, you should stay here.

802
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,713
不了,谢谢。我需要伸伸腿。
No, thank you. I need to stretch my leg.

803
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,715
艾莉森，店员可能认得你。
Allison, the clerk might recognize you.

804
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:52,513
等我们走了，他会告诉所有人我有多漂亮。
And once we're gone, he'll tell everyone how pretty I was.

805
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,848
来，把这个带上。
Here, take this with you.

806
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,972
让我们看看我们在做什么。
Let's just see what we're working with here.

807
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,374
- - -晚上。-晚上好，帅哥。
- Evening. - Evening yourself, handsome.

808
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,419
在这个寂寞的夜晚，你过得怎么样?
How are you doing on this lonesome night?

809
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,293
没什么可抱怨的。
Can't complain.

810
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:27,965
牌子上说你们有空房间。
Sign says you have vacancies.

811
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:30,338
这是正确的。一个房间还是两个?
That's right. One room or two?

812
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,464
一个。
One.

813
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:45,683
17你房间。
You're room 17.

814
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,063
你太好了。
You're too kind.

815
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:48,269
谢谢您,先生。
Thank you, sir.

816
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,440
那是我们最后的钱了。
That was the last of our money.

817
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:54,700
是的。
Yep.

818
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,365
我们会得到更多。
We'll get more.

819
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,883
我需要洗个澡。
I need a shower.

820
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,357
嘿,小子。
Hey, kid.

821
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,118
你为什么不进来呢?
Why don't you come in here?

822
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,505
上帝，感觉就像天堂。
God, feels like heaven.

823
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,799
你想洗澡吗?
You want to shower?

824
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,603
你害怕吗?
You afraid?

825
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,273
不。
No.

826
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,401
你不好意思吗?
Are you embarrassed?

827
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,815
你为什么要我和你一起进去?
Why do you want me in there with you?

828
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,577
“为什么”是什么意思?
What do you mean "why"?

829
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,371
这是个有趣的问题。
That's a funny question.

830
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,541
在我看来很合理。
Seems reasonable enough to me.

831
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,960
天啊，你想让我把你拉进来吗?
Jesus, you want me to drag you in?

832
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,791
想得太多了，孩子。
Thinking too hard about this, kid.

833
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,378
又来了。
There it is again.

834
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:42,183
我是小孩，但桌子后面的那个蠢货，他是帅哥?
I'm "kid," but that dingbat behind the desk, he's "handsome"?

835
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,563
你要我叫你帅哥吗?
You need me to call you handsome?

836
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,351
不,我只是……
No, I just...

837
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:55,654
我有让那个桌子后面的白痴跟我一起洗澡吗?
Did I ask the dingbat behind the desk to get in the shower with me?

838
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,948
如果他在这里，你会的。
Well, maybe if he was here, you would.

839
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,029
哇。去你妈的。
Wow. Fuck you.

840
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,042
我想说的…
All I'm saying...

841
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,208
我想说的是
All I'm saying is,

842
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:15,750
我不知道你是想让我来还是…
I don't know if you actually want me here or...

843
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,282
你这么说是因为你想让我留下来吗
Are you just saying that because you're trying to get me to stick around

844
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:21,262
因为你害怕我会告发你
'cause you're afraid I'll turn you in.

845
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,645
如果我不想让你来，你就不会来了。
You wouldn't be here if I didn't want you here.

846
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,694
你和我一样清楚。
You know that as well as I do.

847
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,085
我道歉。
I apologize.

848
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:38,256
谢谢你！
Thank you.

849
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:43,721
但有件事我得说清楚。
But I need to make something crystal-fucking-clear.

850
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,095
这是你的选择。
This was your choice.

851
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:51,679
我没有叫你来。
I didn't ask you to come.

852
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,812
好吧?你坚持。
Okay? You insisted.

853
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:57,564
你说得很好。
And you talk a great game.

854
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,987
见鬼，我已经习惯了你的陪伴。
And hell, I'm accustomed to your company.

855
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:07,613
但如果你现在对来这里有任何疑虑，
But if you have any doubts about being here right now,

856
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,162
你得回家了。
you need to go home.

857
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:12,200
回家了。再做一个孩子。
Go home. Be a kid again.

858
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:17,664
好吧?因为你在这里度过的每一秒
Okay? 'Cause every second you spend here,

859
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:21,842
这种选择越来越少。你明白的，对吧?
that option gets slimmer and slimmer. You understand that, right?

860
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:27,635
这不是孩子的世界。
This ain't a world for kids.

861
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,057
它是丑陋的。
It's ugly.

862
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,558
丑。
Ugly.

863
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,165
我哪也不去。
I ain't going nowhere.

864
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,541
我想和你一起去海洋。
I want to reach the ocean with you.

865
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,429
你的皮肤真柔软。
Your skin's so soft.

866
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:21,856
好吧?
Okay?

867
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,652
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

868
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,912
我想我需要睡眠。
I think I need some sleep.

869
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:18,700
你以前做过这个吗?
Have you ever done this before?

870
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,872
——没有。——躺下。
- No. - Lay down.

871
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:39,813
你没事吧?
You okay?

872
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:41,682
是的。
Yeah.

873
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,559
你确定吗?”
You sure”?

874
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,154
我只是想……
I just wanna...

875
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,533
我想做个好人。
I want to be good.

876
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,827
好吧，我带你去。
Okay, I'll show you.

877
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:25,400
我不知道现在会发生什么，但是…
I don't really know what's gonna happen now, but...

878
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:28,695
可以的你们…
Can youl...

879
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:31,990
你能闭上眼睛吗?
Can you just close your eyes?

880
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:37,283
——为什么?,就…关闭他们。
- Why? - Just... close 'em.

881
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:49,462
我认为你应该拥有它。
I think you should have it.

882
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:53,716
你不喜欢吗?
You don't like it?

883
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,678
这会让你想起他吗?
Won't it remind you of him?

884
01:20:57,978 --> 01:20:59,889
你看见我戴着它吗?
You seeing me wearing it?

885
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:09,854
不管佩里在哪里，他最不需要的就是手表。
Wherever Perry is, the last thing he needs is a watch.

886
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,157
再说了，我想让我想起另一个人。
Besides, I want it to remind me of someone else.

887
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:37,803
我相信艾利森·威尔斯是为了爱我哥哥才来的。
I believe that Allison Wells did come fo love my brother back.

888
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:41,226
而且她在很大程度上是诚实的。
And that she was truthiul, for the most part.

889
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,812
也许是因为我太想念尤金了…
Maybe it's on account of how badly I miss Eugene...

890
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,232
但我一直在想象
But I've always imagined

891
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:53,530
那一刻，
that, for a moment,

892
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,699
世界出现在他面前
the world appeared before him

893
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:57,868
就像他一直梦想的那样。
the way he always dreamed it would.

894
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:03,912
在那一刻，尤金和埃里森被梦想紧紧地联系在一起。
In that moment, Eugene and Allison were bound fogether by the dream.

895
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,749
他们认为他们已经控制住了。
One they believed they were in control of.

896
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:15,886
我从来不太关心下一部分是谁的主意。
I never been too concerned with whose idea the next part was.

897
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,840
这对我来说并不重要。
It never really mattered much fo me.

898
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:26,605
尤金梦想的生活是有一定条件的
There are certain conditions fo the life Eugene dreamed of

899
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:31,110
我相信艾莉森希望她能对他保密。
that I'm sure Allison wished she could have kept secret from him.

900
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:37,858
她希望为这两件事付出的代价。
Prices she hoped to have paid for the both of them.

901
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:49,624
没有回头路了。好吧?我们进来，我们出去。
There's no going back. Okay? We're in and we're out.

902
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:52,673
两分钟就够了。盯紧那块手表。
Two minutes is all it takes. Keep an eye on that watch.

903
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:03,350
吻我。
Kiss me.

904
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,684
数到5。
Count to five.

905
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:18,945
原谅我。我需要这个。
Pardon me. I'm going to need that.

906
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,152
这是抢劫!
This is a holdup!

907
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,621
大家亲亲地面!
Everybody kiss the ground!

908
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,950
闭嘴!闭嘴!趴在地上!
Shut up! Shut up! Get on the goddamn floor!

909
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:30,457
我不需要你回去，女士。出去。
I don't need you back there, ma'am. Get out.

910
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,128
-大家冷静!-你可以留下。
- Everybody, calm down! - You can stay.

911
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:34,673
拜托，这是家庭银行。
Please, this is a family bank.

912
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,821
-我不会上当的，女士。-我们没有保险。
- I'm not falling for that, lady. - We ain't insured.

913
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,838
每个人,冷静下来!大家好!告诉他们!告诉他们现在!
Everybody, calm down! Everybody! Tell 'em! Tell 'em now!

914
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,594
这样做。叫你怎么做就怎么做。
Do it. Do as you're told.

915
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,220
现在,埃里森?
What now, Allison?

916
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:47,303
你知道该怎么做，女士。你走得越快，我们就走得越快。
You know what to do, ma'am. Faster you go, the faster we leave.

917
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:50,514
-请听我说。我们不是……-我明白了。
- Please, hear me. We are not... - Oh, I hear you.

918
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:51,974
现在,听我说。
Now, hear me.

919
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,025
我要你打开后面那个小保险箱。
I want you to open that little safe back there.

920
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,943
我和我的搭档就不用烦你了。
Me and my partner can get out of your hair.

921
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,237
来吧!
Come on!

922
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:58,939
你那边怎么样了，艾莉森?
How's it going over there, Allison?

923
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,524
告诉他情况有多好，女士。
Tell him how good it's going, lady.

924
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,405
好!好!它会很好!
Good! Good! It's going good!

925
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:03,781
这是正确的。真正的好,孩子。
That's right. Real good, kid.

926
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,453
它是顺利的。它会好的。
It's going well. It's going okay.

927
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,623
各位，照我说的做。保持下来。
Everybody, just do as you're told. Stay down.

928
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,745
很快就会结束的，好吗?
It's going to be over before you know it, okay?

929
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:11,622
谢谢你！就这些了，伙计们。
Thank you. That will be all, folks.

930
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,121
佳佳!
Allison!

931
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:18,842
尤金,来吧。
Eugene, come on.

932
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:28,514
高尔
Gol

933
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,612
简单呼吸就好。来吧,尤金。我们不能停止。
Just breathe. Come on, Eugene. We can't stop.

934
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:49,244
——我们不能。等我们到了墨西哥再说。-你得靠边停车
- We can't. Not till we get to Mexico. - You gotta pull over.

935
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,449
靠边!
Pull over!

936
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,666
请尤金。
Eugene, please.

937
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:57,957
尤金?
Eugene?

938
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,261
尤金，求你了，我们得继续。
Eugene, please, we really gotta keep going.

939
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:10,597
孩子，我们得走了。
Kid, we gotta move.

940
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,440
孩子，求你了，上车吧。
Kid, please, get in the car.

941
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:19,899
一个死了。斯坦利的公民骄傲银行。
One dead. Citizen's pride bank in Stanley.

942
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:24,324
两名逃犯，包括艾莉森·威尔斯，正从281号公路南下。
Two fugitives, including Allison Wells, are heading south on 281.

943
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:29,576
南，281号路上有辆黑色卡车。车牌号码是3285m8。
South, black truck on 281. License plate number 3285m8.

944
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,202
——我重复……——这就是他们。
- I repeat... - That's them.

945
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,083
该死的!
Goddamn!

946
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,836
我能想象你现在的感受，
I can imagine how you're feeling right now,

947
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:42,883
我知道那种感觉不会消失，
and I know that feeling ain't about to go away,

948
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,962
但你在车里需要有那种感觉，
but you need to have that feeling in the car,

949
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:46,497
否则我们会被杀的。
or we're gonna get our asses killed.

950
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,514
他就应该躺在那里。
He should have just stayed lying there.

951
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:52,641
是啊，他应该这么做的，但他太傲慢，太愚蠢了。
Yeah, he should've, but he got arrogant, and he got stupid.

952
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:54,847
我想都没想。我刚做到了。
I wasn't even thinking. I just did it.

953
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:56,147
因为你不得不这么做。
Because you had to.

954
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,854
尤金，不然就是我了。
Eugene, it would have been me otherwise.

955
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:02,821
如果今天必须有人死去，我很高兴你做出了选择。
And if someone had to die today, I'm sure glad that choice was yours.

956
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,949
有人因我而死。
A man is dead because of me.

957
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:08,652
我知道。我知道你的感受。
I know. I know how you feel.

958
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,829
我知道你的感受，但我们得走了。
I know how you feel, but we need to move.

959
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,827
你得上车，尤金。
You need to get in the car, Eugene.

960
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:16,581
艾莉森，我觉得你还不明白。我觉得我做不到。
Allison, I don't think you understand. I don't think I can do this.

961
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:17,832
我能理解…你不!
I do understand... you don't!

962
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,084
我理解!也许"我明白"并不意味着
I understand! Maybe "I understand” doesn't mean

963
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,712
我要坐下来等死。
I'm just gonna sit down and wait to die myself.

964
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:29,923
你怎么理解?
How would you understand?

965
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,352
请尤金。
Eugene, please.

966
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:37,397
-求你了，快上车。-你杀了谁，艾莉森?
- Please, get in the goddamn car. - Who did you kill, Allison?

967
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:45,105
你和他们说的一样，不是吗?
You're everything they said you was, ain't ya?

968
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:53,910
-我不知道是不是我杀了她-你怎么可能不知道?
- I don't know if it was me who killed her. - How could you not know?

969
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,771
因为这一切都是同时发生的。
Because it was happening all at the same time.

970
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:58,251
如果你不在场，
If you weren't there,

971
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:01,125
那女孩今天还会活着吗?
would that girl still be alive today?

972
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,590
你把我变成了我本来没有的东西。
You made me into something that I ain't.

973
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:14,973
我没有让你做你不想做的事。
I didn't make you into anything you didn't already want to be.

974
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,071
尤金。
Eugene.

975
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,277
请。
Please.

976
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,415
尤金!
Eugene!

977
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,000
那不是你的卡车吗?
Ain't that your truck?

978
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,008
尤金!
Eugene!

979
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:54,383
留下来陪她。
Stay here with her.

980
01:27:57,105 --> 01:28:00,472
尤金，我们还是可以去墨西哥的。
Eugene, we can still get to Mexico.

981
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:01,977
你不想找到你父亲吗?
Don't you want to find your father?

982
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:05,026
他走了,佳佳!他死了。
He's gone, Allison! He's dead.

983
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:08,529
我一个人也找不到!
I ain't gonna find nobody!

984
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:27,757
这是再见。
This is goodbye.

985
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,015
别拍我。
Don't shoot me.

986
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,707
菲比，上车!
Phoebe, get in the car!

987
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:02,079
走了。
Go.

988
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:10,963
如果你想要赏金，你可以带我去拿。
If you want the bounty, you can take me in and get it.

989
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,259
或者我们可以按计划行事。
Or we can stick to the plan.

990
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,636
我说了，上车。
I said, get in the car.

991
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:19,801
但是尤金在外面。
But Eugene's out there.

992
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:22,854
我不会让他有事的。我保证。
I won't let nothing happen to him. I promise.

993
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,806
没关系。没关系。
It's all right. It's all right.

994
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,062
待在这里。
Stay here.

995
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,862
不管怎样，我都让你来决定。
Either way, I'm leaving it up to you.

996
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,205
我会告诉他们一切都是我逼你做的。
I'll tell them I made you do everything.

997
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,384
你可以继续你的生活。
You can go on with your life.

998
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:00,471
你得选择你的负担，孩子。
You got to pick your burden, kid.

999
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,193
嘿。
Hey.

1000
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:14,154
我从没想过要骗你。
I never wanted to lie to you.

1001
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:18,402
我把我知道的真相都告诉你了。
I told you all the truths I knew how to.

1002
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,822
我就是你想的那个人。
And I am who you thought I was.

1003
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:26,785
只是稍微复杂一点。
Just a little more complicated is all.

1004
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:35,423
我很害怕,埃里森。
I'm scared, Allison.

1005
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:38,846
是的,我也是。
Yeah, me too.

1006
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,017
我宁愿和你一起害怕，也不愿一个人。
I'd rather be scared with you than alone.

1007
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,191
请。
Please.

1008
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,481
我们可以在海里给自己洗礼。
We can baptize ourselves in the ocean.

1009
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:05,626
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1010
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:15,758
尤金!
Eugene!

1011
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:17,423
别挡道!
Get out of the way!

1012
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:19,390
我们能做到。
We can make it.

1013
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,135
运行,尤金!
Run, Eugene!

1014
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:40,866
Nol !
Nol!

1015
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,320
不!佳佳!
No! Allison!

1016
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:50,539
埃里森。
Allison.

1017
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,711
哦,我的上帝。不。
Oh, my god. No.

1018
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,671
一切都结束了,儿子。把枪放下。
It's over, son. Put your guns down.

1019
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:09,808
让他们失望!
Put 'em down!

1020
01:32:13,737 --> 01:32:14,977
没事的，儿子。
It's all right, son.

1021
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,328
把枪放下!
Put your guns down!

1022
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:31,205
放下!
Put it down!

1023
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:34,288
我说了把枪放下!
I said put the gun down!

1024
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:37,582
在地上!
On the ground!

1025
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,133
运行,尤金!
Run, Eugene!

1026
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:55,058
那是我们最后一次见到尤金。
That was the last time any of us saw Eugene.

1027
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:58,607
我们不知道他去了哪里，也不知道他是否到了那里……
We don't know where he went or if he got there...

1028
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,356
但我从未试图找到他。
But I never tried fo find him.

1029
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,946
这不是我的命运。
That was never my destiny.

1030
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:07,704
不同的父亲，我想。
Different fathers, I suppose.

1031
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:12,705
但我会尽我所能让尤金·贝克的传奇永存。
But I do what I can fo keep the legend of Eugene baker alive.

1032
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:15,253
有了这些留给我的工具，
And with the tools left for me,

1033
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,582
约翰离开他的真实而诚实的缺席
that true and honest absence that John left him

1034
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:20,132
他给了我，
and he gave to me,

1035
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:22,669
我讲他的故事。
I tell his story.

1036
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:29,009
我最后一次见到我哥哥是20年前
The last ime I saw my brother was 20 years ago

1037
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:32,096
1935年4月16日。
on April 16th, 1935.

1038
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:48,570
这是将近一年来第一天下雨。
The first day it rained in almost a year.

1039
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,709
也许这是尤金找到他要找的东西的信号。
Maybe a sign that Eugene found what he was looking for.
