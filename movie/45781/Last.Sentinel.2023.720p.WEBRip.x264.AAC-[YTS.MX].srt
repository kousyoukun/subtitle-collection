3
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,725
(gentle music)

4
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:29,715
- [Cassidy] Darkness and light.

5
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:31,800
Evil and good.

6
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,429
War and peace.

7
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,513
Them and us.

8
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:42,436
Everyone knows that one could
not exist without the other.

9
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,771
And between the two,
there is a balance.

10
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,154
Some say that before
the lands disappeared,

11
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,740
birds were able to migrate
between the continents.

12
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,204
They used a wind called uplift.

13
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,372
You don't have to flap
your wings to stay up,

14
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,624
but you also don't fall.

15
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:11,465
You stay in the middle
effortlessly resting in the air.

16
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,721
But there are no
uplift winds anymore

17
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,973
(anxious music)

18
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,558
because we ruined the balance.

19
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,105
(waves thundering)

20
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,321
(thunder rumbling)

21
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,155
The dinghy.

22
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,492
- Here.

23
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,369
- Hold on.

24
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,454
Got it.

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,210
Baines, up top.

26
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,091
(waves crashing)

27
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,180
- [Sullivan] Woo, look at 'em.

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,558
(Sullivan laughing)

29
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:07,729
(wind whistling)
(rain splattering)

00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,908

(walls rumbling)

32
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,969
(chains clattering)

33
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,432
(winch whirring)

34
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,145
(wave rumbling)

35
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,106
(rain splattering)

36
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,238
- Status, Baines?

37
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,658
- [Baines] On winch.

38
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,492
- It's a nine.

39
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,745
20 minutes to impact.

40
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:09,917
Secure the genny.

41
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,587
(rain splattering)

42
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,755
Cassidy?

43
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,132
- Finishing on platform.

44
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,591
- Did he say nine?

45
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,426
- Hook it.

46
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,721
Come on, Sully.

47
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,849
Hook it.

48
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,936
(wave crashing)

49
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,104
The net, the net.

50
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,982
(tense music)

51
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,235
God damn it, Sully.

52
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,486
- I got it.

53
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,029
Get on the winch.

54
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,784
(items clattering)

55
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,289
(tense music)

56
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,426
(winch clicking)

57
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,187
(pipes rattling)

58
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,026
(water splattering)

59
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,695
(Baines sighing)

60
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,321
- [Hendrichs] Five
minutes to impact.

61
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,490
Secure the doors.

62
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,159
- [Cassidy] Come
on, Sully, leave it.

63
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,871
(Sullivan groaning)

64
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,748
(waves crashing)

65
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,418
(tense music)

66
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,132
- Fuck.

67
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,178
(Baines groaning)

68
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,807
- [Cassidy] Sullivan, lets go.

69
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,268
(tense music)

70
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,275
(Baines groaning)

71
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,238
(rain splattering)

72
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,325
(Sullivan grunting)

73
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,373
(winch whirring)

74
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:27,679
(winch thudding)
(Sullivan groaning)

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,647
(Baines groaning)

76
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,149
(tense music)

77
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,365
(Baines coughing)

78
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,746
(wave crashing)

79
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,417
(items rattling)

80
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,003
(tense music)

81
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,353
(water booming)

82
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,997
(winch clicking)

83
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,004
- We're fucked.

84
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,725
(waves gently lapping)

85
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,591
(generator churning)

86
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,519
(generator chugging)

87
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,274
(fist thumping)

88
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,573
(metre crackling)

89
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,751
(lever creaking)

90
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,647
(door creaking)

91
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,027
(door thudding)

92
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,572
(tap creaking)

93
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,450
(hand thudding)

94
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,460
(hand thudding)

95
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,427
- Thieving bastard.

96
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,852
- [Hendrichs] It took two hours
five from horizon to impact.

97
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,937
- Doesn't leave much
time to scavenge.

98
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,189
If it gets any faster then-

99
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,149
- If it gets faster,
we get faster.

100
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,776
- How about the fact that
the storm was two days early?

101
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,778
Any earlier and the relief
boat won't have time

102
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,071
to get out and back.

103
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,823
- Assuming they see
fit to send one.

104
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,953
- We use the outboard.
- We can't spare the diesel.

105
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,289
Unless we cut our genny usage.

106
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,208
Also, radiation levels are up

107
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,793
so I suggest weekly
iodine baths from today.

108
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,295
- We're on our last barrel.

109
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,632
If we go weekly, we'll be
out of iodine in a month.

110
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,884
(plate clattering)

111
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,552
What's that?

112
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,180
Where's the fish?

113
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,306
- We lost the catch.

114
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,477
- It was right there
on the platform.

115
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,728
- Yeah, and then it wasn't.

116
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,234
- You mean we have to
eat this crap all month?

117
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,861
- The good news is the storm
cycle is getting shorter.

118
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,405
- What happened, Sullivan?

119
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,698
- I take full responsibility.

120
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,033
- And that makes it better how?

121
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,368
- Calm down, Baines.

122
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,994
- We get one chance
to get fresh food,

123
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,329
real fucking food once a month,

124
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,122
all he has to do
is pull up a net.

125
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,832
The storm pushes the
fish into the net.

126
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,501
There's no fishing required.

127
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,627
I mean is it too much to ask?

128
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:09,920
- You fucked my kitchen.

129
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,588
All right?

130
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,006
So how about you do your
job before giving it all-

131
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,383
- Do my job?

132
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,051
Without my job you'd
have no running water.

133
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:16,927
I make the fucking water.

134
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,136
Thank you, Baines.

135
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,137
- You make the water.

136
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,222
- Oh, what is it you do again?

137
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,056
Fish?

138
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:21,890
- Calm down, Baines.

139
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,517
- I do my job, don't I?

140
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,394
I row that deathtrap
into a force nine

141
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,771
to scavenge what I can to keep
this shitcan from collapsing.

142
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:28,772
- Enough.

143
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,987
I'm still waiting on
that damage report.

144
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,074
- Ah, let me see.

145
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,075
The desalinator?

146
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,118
That's just blew.

147
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,578
The genny is a crock.

148
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,080
Erm, everything
is rusted to shit.

149
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,999
In other words, we're fucked.

150
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,333
Do you want it in French?

151
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,126
Fuckay.

152
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,043
German?

153
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,878
GeFookd.

154
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:51,670
Spanish?

155
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,467
I don't know it in Spanish.

156
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,678
- I have every confidence
you can fix it all, Baines.

157
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:05,893
- Ah, okay, I'll
put it this way.

158
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,438
In case you haven't noticed,

159
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,904
we're leaning at a
3.4 degree incline.

160
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,199
And a massive chunk of
the level one walkway

161
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,950
is completely missing.

162
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,368
How do you suggest I fix that?

163
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,455
- Tape it off.

164
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,248
A warning ribbon, yes.

165
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,625
Why didn't I think of that.

166
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,626
- You have a better idea?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,461
We get the fuck out of here.

168
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,466
When are we going to ask the
Hub when the relief is coming?

169
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,675
- The satellite-

170
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,843
- Is for reporting events only.

171
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,220
Yes, we get that.

172
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,722
- They will inform us
when they're ready.

173
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,806
We all volunteered to be here.

174
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,183
- [Baines] For two years.

175
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,186
Our shift was over
three months ago.

176
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:58,237
(worrisome music)

177
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,973
- [Computer]
Establishing connection.

178
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,774
(wind funnel flapping)

179
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,874
(computer beeping)

180
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,668
Connection fully established.

181
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,254
(radio static)

182
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,550
(morse code beeping)

183
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,726
(lever tapping)

184
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,232
(worrisome music)

185
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:31,914
(door clicking)
(door thudding)

186
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,915
- So now, we're not even
allowed to mention it?

187
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,426
Thanks for sticking
by me in the canteen.

188
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,679
- Did I have a choice?

189
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,731
- Oh, I fixed your mug.

190
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,191
- Thanks.

191
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:07,533
(door creaking)
(door thudding)

192
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,747
(barrel rattling)

193
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,679
(children's music)

194
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,318
(door creaking)

195
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,250
- What are they like, Sarge?

196
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,629
I mean, you've been
behind their lines, right?

197
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,006
Before the great fuck up.

198
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,219
- What's this?

199
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,807
- Oh that?

200
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,392
That's Peter.

201
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,687
- Well, I don't like Peter.

202
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,025
So whoever put him
up can take him down.

203
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,028
- Have a heart, Sarge,
he was lost at sea.

204
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,614
- It's a military outpost
not a damn circus.

205
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,656
- Yeah, once you
get to know him-

206
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,616
- Down.

207
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:33,035
- He'll be on your conscience.

208
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,119
If he has a conscience.

209
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,586
Yo, Sarge.

210
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,805
Right there.
(anxious music)

211
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:56,141
You see it?

212
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,562
- Comms, check radar.

213
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:05,192
Baines, to the roof.
(radio squelching)

214
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,528
Cassidy, do you read?

215
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:09,530
- I have it.

216
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,990
Solid contact.

217
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,407
Small, slow and steady.

218
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,201
1.9 Ks.

219
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,619
- Yo, it's the boat.

220
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,329
It's the relief.

221
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,705
- Man the gun, Sullivan.

222
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,334
Baines.
(radio squelching)

223
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,961
- The gun?

224
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,420
Sarge, that's the relief.

225
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,463
- We don't know that.

226
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,549
The gun.

227
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,551
Baines, where are you?

228
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,263
(alarm blaring)

229
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,681

he had a dog ♪

231
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,936
- Sentinel calling vessel.

232
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,271
Identify yourself.

Sentinel to vessel.

237
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:04,918
Identify yourself.

238
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,461
- What's going on?

239
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,880
- It's our boat.

240
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,425
- [Baines] Fuck, finally.

241
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,052
So what are we doing?

242
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,597
- His stupid protocol.

243
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,432
(shell clanging)

244
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:19,808
- Contact.

Radar bearing East

246
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:24,855
East 85.

247
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,939
No engine reading.

248
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,357
Still steady and slow.

249
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,859
1650 and closing.

250
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,322
Sentinel calling.

251
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,865
Respond.

252
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,327
(tense music)

253
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,626
Sentinel to vessel,
identify yourself.

254
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,510
Sentinel to vessel.

255
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,302
Respond.

256
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,765
(tense music)

257
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,809
- Sullivan, get the dinghy.

258
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:05,395
Go see.

259
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,066
Use the outboard.

260
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:13,445
- Alone?

261
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,157
(tense music)

262
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:37,427
(engine revving)

263
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,181
- If I say the word,
don't you hesitate.

264
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,475
He'll be as good as ready.

265
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,604
(tense music)

266
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,240

269
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,312
- Hello.

00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,400

On deck.

273
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:03,764
No sign of life.

(tense music)

280
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,895
- Sullivan, what's the score?

281
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,150
Sullivan, report.

282
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,946
Over.
(radio squelching)

283
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,155

293
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,272
- Isn't that a bit premature?

294
00:23:58,272 --> 00:23:59,982
- Sullivan's not responding.

295
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:03,819
- Sarge.

296
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:04,570
- Key.

- Oh brother.

00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:14,473

304
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,142

(buttons beeping)

310
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,601
- Stand easy, Corporal.

311
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,192
(computer beeping)

312
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,989
(bomb whirring)

313
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:20,163
Sullivan?
(radio squelching)

314
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,833
(tense music)

315
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,589
Sullivan, imperative
you respond.

316
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,132
(radio squelching)

317
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:33,677
Sullivan.

318
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,897
(wrapper crackling)

319
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,449
Sullivan, we've gone live.

320
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:58,035
Repeat, we've gone live.

321
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,578
Imperative-
- No one here.

322
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:02,539
All clear.

(Hendrichs sighing)

324
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,842
- Tow her back.

(keys jingling)

330
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,282
- Sarge.

331
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,286
My key.

332
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,830
- Upon sighting unknown craft,
the device will be armed.

333
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:48,919
The protocol is
explicit, Corporal.

334
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,171
Hesitation not permissible.

335
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,675
(uneasy music)

336
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,074
- What the hell's he
thinking, waking Martha?

337
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:19,950
- What do you expect?

338
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,035
You stopped answering.

339
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:23,495
- Fucking lunatic.

340
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:27,249
(fan thudding)

341
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,760
(gentle music)

342
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,977
(door clicking)

343
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,653
(gentle music)

344
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:06,288
(items clattering)

345
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,766
- [Baines] That
engine's dead, kaput.

346
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:27,017
- Okay.

347
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,478
What about four kitbags,
two years' supplies

348
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:32,231
and five barrels of
iodine, it's the relief.

349
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,607
- Well I'm telling you,

350
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,025
that engine hasn't
worked in months.

351
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,069
- What does that mean, huh?

352
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,111
It's just been drifting?

353
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:40,781
Is that even possible?

354
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,535
And what about the crew?

355
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,620
- Maybe it broke moorings
before they boarded.

356
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,835
- [Sullivan] I guess we'll
find out when we report it.

357
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,128
- There'll be no report
without more information.

358
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:58,215
(water splattering)

359
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,178
- What kind of information?

360
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:05,389
- More.

361
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:06,849
- More?

362
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,392
(chuckles) We know nothing.

363
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,978
Multiply that by 10
and it's still nothing.

364
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,855
Other than blowing
ourselves to kingdom come,

365
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,023
our sole purpose is to
report events, right?

366
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:19,111
An empty boat turns up
that's meant to be our relief

367
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,404
is that not a fucking event?

368
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:23,323
And if that's not
a fucking event-

369
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,158
- I'll let you know if there's
a fucking event, Sullivan.

370
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:34,001
After I've inspected the
vessel and made my assessment.

371
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,879
(keys jingling)

372
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,213
Baines, the boat.

373
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,424
See if you can get some
lights working on her.

374
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,972
- What's he doing
with both keys?

375
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,351
How did that happen?

376
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,523
(uneasy music)

377
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:15,083
(tense music)

378
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:33,519
(book cover thudding)

379
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,151
(poster ripping)

380
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,246
You planning a trip?

381
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:53,747
(computer beeping)

382
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:57,209
- Establishing connection.
- Going to take that down?

383
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,586
- Yeah, wouldn't
want to miss that.

384
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:03,340
(computer beeping)

385
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,175
- [Computer] Connection
fully established.

386
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:08,345
(morse code beeping)

387
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,934
(lever tapping)

388
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:20,148
Would not wanna miss that.

389
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,362
(uneasy music)

390
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,450
(computer beeping)

391
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,120
- [Computer]
Dropping connection.

392
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:42,296
(uneasy music)

393
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:48,552
(metronome ticking)
(tense music)

394
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:28,884
(metronome ticking)
(tense music)

395
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,306
- [Cassidy] What is it?

396
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,266
- [Sullivan] Beats me.

397
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:38,310
- Well.

398
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,480
Thanks for the mystery.

399
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:46,193
(door creaking)

400
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:02,459
- You ever think about
the world down there?

401
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:05,462
- [Cassidy] What about it?

402
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:08,757
- How it was.

403
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:12,553
People, cities, life.

404
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,304
Before the world was fucked up.

405
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:15,138
- [Cassidy] It's gone.

406
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,598
Why lose sleep over it?

407
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,391
- [Sullivan] I don't
know, to learn or-

408
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:19,184
- Learn what?

409
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,312
It's been one fuck
up after another.

410
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:27,234
One side fucked the climate,
the other side fucked the sea.

411
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:28,694
When there was nothing
left to fuck up,

412
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:30,320
we fucked each
other up by fighting

413
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,780
over the nothing that was left.

414
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:36,869
And then, we inherit this shit.

415
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,288
And what we do?

416
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,041
Keep on fucking up.

417
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:47,545
- There you go, you
learn something.

418
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,840
- [Cassidy] The only
way to unfuck the world

419
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,592
is to wipe out the humans.

420
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,927
(door creaking)

421
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:54,719
The watch?

422
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:03,437
- When we get back, you ever
think about what you'll do?

423
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,692
I was thinking that
when we do get home-

424
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:12,279
- Sully, (chuckles) come on.

425
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:15,073
We don't even know when
we're actually going.

426
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,992
You know?

427
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,704
(uneasy music)

428
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,290
- I did it.

429
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,420
I sent a message.

430
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,884
We'll find out tomorrow.

431
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:39,431
(Peter flapping)

432
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,645
(uneasy music)

433
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,961
(tense music)

434
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:23,267
(Peter flapping)

435
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:24,726
(footsteps)

436
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:43,495
- You angling to send a message?

437
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,041
(computer beeping)

438
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,209
- [Computer]
Establishing connection.

439
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:52,504
- You did it
already, didn't you?

440
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,176
You did.

441
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:58,051
Jesus.

442
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:00,971
- [Hendrichs] Why is
it still up there?

443
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,477
What is this?

444
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:08,270
A convention?

445
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,692
You taken root, Baines?

446
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:25,787
- Sullivan sent an
inquiry about the relief.

447
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:26,914
- Really?

448
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,625
- He would've found out
when the answer comes.

449
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,002
- I told you I wanted
more information first.

450
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,587
- This is the only
information that counts.

451
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:34,838
(computer beeping)

452
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:35,839
- [Computer] Connection
fully established.

453
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,806
(morse code beeping)

454
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,359
- That can't be all.

455
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,652
Hold on.

456
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:57,986
- You sure you sent it?

457
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,738
- Yeah, I'm sure, I'm
not a fucking idiot.

458
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:06,161
(worrisome music)

459
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,373
- Get to your posts.

460
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:11,458
I'll deal with you all later.

461
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:19,883
(morse code beeping)

462
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,141
- Vessel arrived.

463
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:29,852
Relief missing.

464
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:32,896
Why are they telling us?

465
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:40,028
Advise action.

466
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,073
(worrisome music)

467
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:46,326
Isn't that what you asked them?

468
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,079
- That's exactly
what I asked them.

469
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:51,623
That's my signal.

470
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:52,833
(computer beeping)

471
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,710
- [Computer]
Dropping connection.

472
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,044
- [Sullivan] How
is that possible?

473
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:58,130
- No one downloads it,
so it comes back round.

474
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:04,553
But why would no
one download it?

475
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,349
- [Computer] Connection dropped.

476
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:13,979
(uneasy music)

477
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:16,982
- It could be months, years
since we lost contact.

478
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,734
I mean what genius came
up with this system?

479
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,819
- It must be a faulty
receiver at base.

480
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,448
Maybe it went down yesterday
and tomorrow they'll fix it.

481
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:26,867
- How do we know
there's been no attack?

482
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:29,286
- You do know why this
place was built here?

483
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:30,370
Right here?

484
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,039
- Yeah.

485
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,290
Because back then it was the
only place anyone could cross

486
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,083
in time between the storms.

487
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,252
But that shit was 40 years ago.

488
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:39,588
I mean, you do realise
that everything's changed?

489
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:41,215
Tides, currents, jet streams.

490
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:44,218
That boat just
survived three months.

491
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:46,428
If the boat can make
it, maybe the enemy can.

492
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,264
And who's to say they haven't?

493
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:50,349
- Because they haven't.

494
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:01,109
- I'm sorry.

495
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:03,320
I'm sure they're fine.

496
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,074
(door creaking)

497
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:09,243
You're right, it
went down yesterday

498
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:10,536
and tomorrow they'll fix it.

499
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:13,622
Fuck.

500
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:21,505
(uneasy music)

501
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:31,306
(waves lapping)

502
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:42,025
(anxious music)

503
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,586
(hatch creaking)

504
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,094
(hatch thudding)

505
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:22,691
(door creaking)

506
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,153
Yo, Baines?

507
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:31,658
Baines?

508
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:39,708
- [Radio Narrator] Out jumped
a strange grinning creature

509
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,084
with a concertina body

510
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,337
and round bald head.

511
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:45,839
Tin soldier.

512
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,841
The tin soldier
pretended not to hear

513
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,344
but he blushed as
red as his uniform

514
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:54,431
Staring at our princess. Just
you wait till tomorrow. Haaaaa

515
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,851
And the jack disappeared
back into his box

516
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:00,562
with a squawking laugh.

517
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:04,024
The next morning, the little
boy set out his soldiers....

518
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:11,114
(uneasy music)

519
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,866
(door thudding)

520
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:18,038
(door creaking)
(door thudding)

521
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:21,291
(tense music)

522
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:22,334
- Where've you been?

523
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:24,503
- Taking a walk.

524
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,548
- With your tools?

525
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,550
- Well if I had a
dog, I'd walk the dog.

526
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,095
(tool bag thudding)

527
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:33,929
Stay.

528
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,309
- [Sullivan] Any plans
to fix the galley sink?

529
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:42,437
- Then I wouldn't get to
watch you carrying buckets.

530
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:45,399
- Fuck you.

531
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:47,776
With bows on.

532
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:52,322
Asshole.

533
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:01,039
- [Baines] Sullivan.

534
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:08,714
- [Sullivan] Okay, but what
does your Elizabeth say?

535
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,382
- The same.

536
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,259
She never believed
in all that stuff.

537
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,803
About an enemy waiting to cross.

538
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:18,974
It doesn't make much sense
when you think about it.

539
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:20,976
I mean we haven't
seen them in 40 years.

540
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:25,439
They're probably all gone.

541
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:27,691
- Well why would
they send us here

542
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:29,026
if there's no one out there?

543
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:33,197
- It's the threat, Liz
says they use the threat

544
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:35,532
of danger to keep us in line.

545
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:38,785
- They used to be there.

546
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:39,745
- Yeah, they did.

547
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:44,208
She says we wiped
them out years ago.

548
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,045
Or the sea done it for us.

549
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,466
- She says a lot your old lady.

550
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:54,760
- (chuckles) Yeah.

551
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:58,514
She's pretty smart.

552
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,066
- What if they
think we detonated?

553
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:11,902
- They don't.

554
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:13,111
- No, if the satellite is bust

555
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:14,571
and they aint
getting our messages-

556
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:16,240
- Martha is 20 megatons.

557
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,575
The tsunami she kicks up
would hit both continents.

558
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:19,910
More than hit.

559
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:20,702
Smash.

560
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:23,372
- Wait, wait.

561
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:27,209
Martha's tiny compared
to the first two-

562
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:28,669
- It doesn't need to be big.

563
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,923
The earth's a
different place now.

564
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:35,843
The axis has shifted,
the sea's risen.

565
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:36,969
It wouldn't take much.

566
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:43,600
- So it could
actually destroy us

567
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:49,606
and horses, and dogs-

568
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:50,607
- And cats.

569
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:51,358
- Cats.

570
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,445
And swallows?

571
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:56,363
- Sully.
- I mean,

572
00:44:56,363 --> 00:45:00,075
sweet swooping swallows.

573
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,076
- Listen.

574
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,744
- Man they don't deserve that.

575
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,913
I mean haven't we screwed
up enough already?

576
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:07,291
- Sully.
- And he got both keys.

577
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,417
- Can we just stop
talking about this now.

578
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,919
- To the last
device in the world.

579
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:12,254
- Sully, listen to me.

580
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:13,088
Listen to me.

581
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,136
What if, hypothetically,

582
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,015
that boat could work?

583
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:32,608
- (gasps) Jesus, Sully.

584
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:38,488
- Ever heard of Mornington?

585
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:42,117
- Who?

586
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:44,077
- No, no, a place.

587
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,914
They've still got
electrics, running water,

588
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:49,082
even a sewage plant.

589
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:50,250
- Mornington.
- Yeah.

590
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,585
- Great.

591
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:52,211
Let's talk about
it in the morning.

592
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:53,545
I need sleep.

593
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:55,964
- What if I told you
that the boat worked?

594
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:08,727
I mean, the boat
could still work.

595
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,275
- Baines is fixing it?

596
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:19,154
- Well, if he asks, I
ain't tell you shit.

597
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:22,407
- Has he done it or not?

598
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:24,284
- I mean, it's a
work in progress.

599
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:29,748
We have to leave within
the next three days.

600
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:33,210
That'll give us 14
days to get home

601
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,796
before the next storm hits.

602
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:38,966
So all we need to do
is convince Hendrichs.

603
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:42,219
I mean we're going home, Cass.

604
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:43,762
- Hendrichs will
never go for this.

605
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:46,265
- Hendrichs can come
or stay, his call.

606
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:50,143
But we are going.

607
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:55,190
I mean, a couple
of weeks from now

608
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,192
we'll be sat in that
great stinking port,

609
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:58,235
eating goat steak.

610
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,073
I mean, what do you say to that?

611
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:08,328
(waves lapping)

612
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:35,689
- On my signal, not
before, not after.

613
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,357
Or you'll have my
hand off, okay?

614
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:40,569
You ready?

615
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:43,697
Three.

616
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:46,116
Two.

617
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:49,828
Now.

618
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:53,248
(engine splatting)

619
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:55,167
Again.

620
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:58,212
(engine rumbling)

621
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:03,842
(Sullivan cheering)

622
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:11,892
Now.

623
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:15,354
Hendrichs.

624
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:20,484
- You just leave
the talking to me.

625
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:25,030
(Sullivan laughing)

626
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:30,911
- Excellent work.

627
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,750
- Well, what can we say.

628
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,045
- Now, break it up.

629
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:44,466
I want everything
stripped by sundown.

630
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:47,761
Electrics, engine, nuts
and bolts, decking.

631
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,805
Everything that's not hull.

632
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:51,056
Start with the engine.

633
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:52,307
- No fucking way.

634
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:53,684
- Look, it's a
working boat, Sarge.

635
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:55,018
- We need the parts.

636
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:57,229
- Sarge, that fuel
injector is held together

637
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:59,606
by quarter mil copper wire,
if it's moved one inch-

638
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,942
- The engine is not the point.

639
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,819
We only have one chance.

640
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:06,530
If we leave by tomorrow,
we beat the storm.

641
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,949
If not, then we lose
the boat for good.

642
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:11,285
- That's why we're
dismantling her.

643
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:17,332
- I vote we go.

644
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:22,588
- You don't get
to vote, Sullivan.

645
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:25,674
- Baines?

646
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:30,137
Cassidy?

647
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:34,558
(tense music)

648
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:41,690
We're not dying for you.

649
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:44,109
Not like the others.

650
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:54,578
- New orders.

651
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:56,997
Cassidy, Comms.

652
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,666
Sullivan, winch.

653
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:02,753
Baines, stow the salvage.

654
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:07,966
- Or what?

655
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:10,636
(anxious music)

656
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:16,975
- Fuck.

657
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:18,268
- You have the amazing ability

658
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:19,645
of saying the wrong
thing at the wrong time.

659
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:21,396
What do you expect?

660
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:24,233
- Fuck him, we'll
take it anyway.

661
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:25,984
- [Hendrichs] Sullivan,
where are you?

662
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:28,070
Man the winch.

663
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,072
- That's our boat and
we're not losing it.

664
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:32,366
Not to that power-crazy-
- It's not about power.

665
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:33,367
- He took both keys.

666
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,665
- [Hendrichs] What's
taking so long?

667
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:45,254
- I'll deal with it.

668
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:48,799
(tense music)

669
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:55,973
(door thudding)

670
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:08,902
- Did you know?

671
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:12,906
- Hypothetically.

672
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:15,367
- Your duty is to
inform me of mutiny.

673
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,536
- Come on, Sarge,
it's not a mutiny.

674
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:19,580
They need to understand
their orders.

675
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,874
Can you honestly say you stopped
them for the right reason?

676
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:25,169
- Our job is to protect the
device, not run like rats.

677
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:27,629
Right reason enough for you?

678
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:33,218
Make yourself useful.

679
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:35,387
Clear out the wheelhouse.

680
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:45,564
- I'm sorry you lost
your squad, Sergeant.

681
00:51:45,564 --> 00:51:47,816
- What's that got
to do with anything?

682
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:53,030
- Those other men
aren't ever coming back.

683
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:00,245
Don't lose two more.

684
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:03,540
- [Sullivan] We're
not killing anyone.

685
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,375
- Did I say kill?

686
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,835
We jump.

687
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:07,628
We jump him.

688
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:10,422
We need to leave
here by tomorrow.

689
00:52:12,758 --> 00:52:15,761
So unless you have something
better to do, like talk

690
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:18,805
or vote, he could just
walk in here and shoot us.

691
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,060
- Would you be able
to disable Martha?

692
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:27,689
- (chuckles) Jesus,
he's not going to-

693
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:29,816
- There's no telling what
crazy shit he might do.

694
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:35,364
- I don't know.

695
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:36,156
It would take...

696
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:39,034
What are we even talking about?

697
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:40,410
Are you listening to me?

698
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,246
We need to be out
of here tomorrow.

699
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:44,122
If we don't leave
by tomorrow he...

700
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,457
(footsteps)

701
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:53,799
- Drinking on duty, Baines?

702
00:52:56,802 --> 00:52:58,178
- No, it's not even open.

703
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:02,766
- In that case, at
least you could share.

704
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:03,725
Get some glasses.

705
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:40,220
Corporal Cassidy
deems it imperative
to send a report home.

706
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:42,890
By boat.

707
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:50,105
I am minded to agree.

708
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:00,532
That said, it goes
without saying we
can't abandon our post.

709
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:07,831
So, we split up.

710
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:12,669
Two go and one stays with me.

711
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:16,965
- Who?

712
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:20,385
- The boat will deliver
our report to the Hub

713
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:23,847
and send back the
relief or else return

714
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:25,015
with information and supplies.

715
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:27,142
- Yeah, who?

716
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,478
Who goes, who stays with you?

717
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:35,859
- Corporal Cassidy
volunteered to remain.

718
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,740
You pack two weeks' supplies.

719
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:46,495
You leave tomorrow if
there's no new signal.

720
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:50,374
(worrisome music)

721
00:54:59,216 --> 00:54:59,967
- [Sullivan] What was that?

722
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:05,514
Cass?

723
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:12,062
You said you'd talk to him.

724
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:13,272
- I did.

725
00:55:13,272 --> 00:55:14,940
You got what you wanted.

726
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,900
Take the boat, go home.

727
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:19,987
- You can't stay
here alone with him.

728
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:23,156
- The rig needs at least
two to keep it running.

729
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:24,741
- I'm not leaving without you.

730
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:29,663
What is it?

731
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:30,831
You've been on edge for months.

732
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:32,165
- We're soldiers.

733
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:34,960
- Stop being a fucking
soldier for one minute.

734
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,171
- (sighs) Why are
you here, Sullivan?

735
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,005
- [Sullivan] What?

736
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:39,756
- Here, on this post.

737
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:40,591
You volunteered.

738
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:42,092
- Oh come on.

739
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:44,928
Don't make like this is
some heroic national duty.

740
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:46,096
Truth, loyalty, sacrifice.

741
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:48,098
That shit belongs
on the toilet wall.

742
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:50,475
We didn't come here to die.

743
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:52,269
We came for the cash.

744
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:55,314
And we signed up to put our
lives on the line for two years.

745
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:56,523
Two.

746
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:58,275
And we kept our side.

747
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:06,158
I'll stay.

748
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:09,995
You go.

749
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:10,787
- You don't get a say.

750
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,081
- [Sullivan] I'm not
leaving you here.

751
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:18,629
- Sully, whatever
you think you feel-

752
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:20,797
- Whatever I think I feel?

753
00:56:24,301 --> 00:56:26,220
I won't let you-
- Go pack.

754
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,429
Jesus.

755
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:34,353
- Don't you wanna go home?

756
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:36,855
You.

757
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,192
Don't you wanna see them?

758
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:46,990
I know you wanna go back.

759
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:49,284
You must.

760
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,996
(gentle music)

761
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:02,297
Then let's both stay.

762
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:11,515
- I don't love you, Sullivan.

763
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:15,727
If that's what you wanna hear.

764
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:20,691
You were a human necessity.

765
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:24,319
An easy lay.

766
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:28,532
(tender music)

767
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:52,681
(hand thudding)
(door creaking)

768
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:55,350
(hand thudding)

769
00:57:57,895 --> 00:58:00,772
(Cassidy sobbing)

770
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:57,621
- They're like us.

771
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,001
You asked me what they are like.

772
00:59:05,963 --> 00:59:09,007
They have families and
children, they eat and shit,

773
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:13,095
and they pray one day
all this will end.

774
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:16,807
The only difference
between us and them

775
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:22,271
is they're trying to kill us
and we're trying to kill them.

776
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:24,773
And that's not
even a difference.

777
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:30,112
- We could all go, Sarge.

778
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:33,365
No one's coming.

779
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,535
Not ours or theirs.

780
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:37,786
- We can't know that.

781
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:42,541
We have something
they don't, Sullivan.

782
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:44,751
Our duty is to keep it that way.

783
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:56,054
I'm sorry you have
to leave Cassidy.

784
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:08,358
- [Sullivan] You knew?

785
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:11,028
- I know everything, Sullivan.

786
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:15,532
Rest up, both of you.

787
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:30,714
(tense music)

788
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,598
(tense music)

789
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:48,166
- Is everything okay, Sarge?

790
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:53,297
(anxious music)

791
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:14,026
(alarm blaring)

792
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:20,532
- Oh sweet Jesus.

793
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:30,918
(radar beeping)

794
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:33,378
(tense music)

795
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:36,673
- Action stations.

796
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:43,972
(alarm blaring)
(door thudding)

797
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:45,057
Man the gun.

798
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:48,894
- How far are they?

799
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:50,437
Maybe we can outrun
them in the boat.

800
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:55,234
- [Hendrichs] Left four degrees,
600 metres, bearing 186.

801
01:02:55,234 --> 01:02:56,568
- 600.

802
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:57,986
Shit, I can't see a thing.

803
01:02:59,238 --> 01:03:00,781
Cass, what you got?

804
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:05,369
- Sentinel calling vessel.

805
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:11,792
(radar beeping)
(tense music)

806
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:19,007
- [Baines] How'd it get so
near with no-one picking it up?

807
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:21,009
- [Hendrichs] Right
one, hold elevation.

808
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:25,764
(shell clattering)

809
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:27,266
Elevation three.

810
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:28,016
Ready.

811
01:03:30,352 --> 01:03:32,437
- Should we find out who they
are before firing, Sarge?

812
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:33,272
- Not this time.

813
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,483
Fire.

814
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:39,194
(cannon booming)

815
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:45,325
Miss.

816
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:48,453
Reload.
- Fuck.

817
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:49,288
- Repeat.

818
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:50,873
Sentinel calling vessel.

819
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:51,665
Respond

820
01:03:57,629 --> 01:04:00,507
(radar beeping)

821
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:07,097
(tense music)

822
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,349
- [Hendrichs] Left two, up one.

823
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:10,309
- Up?

824
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:11,768
It's heading away?

825
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:17,107
- Fuck.

826
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:19,568
(tense music)

827
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:29,703
It's our boat.

828
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:31,121
- Fire.
- It's our boat.

829
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:32,247
- Take your post.

830
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,291
Fire

831
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:38,003
Fire, Baines, fire.

832
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:38,754
- Our boat?

833
01:04:40,589 --> 01:04:42,674
Quick, grab the tender.

834
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:45,302
(tense music)

835
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:55,020
Hendrichs, are you
fucking insane?

836
01:04:55,020 --> 01:05:00,192
(fist thumping)
(Baines grunting)

837
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:02,361
- Sarge, the boat.

838
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:04,988
- Time to choose
sides, corporal.

839
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:08,158
(tense music)

840
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:15,457
Right one, hold elevation.

841
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:18,794
(tense music)

842
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:24,174
- Do it, Baines.

843
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:28,053
(gun booming)

844
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:33,725
(tense music)

845
01:05:37,729 --> 01:05:39,398
- Don't you touch that, Sully.

846
01:05:39,398 --> 01:05:41,233
- Move away, Sullivan.

847
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:45,028
Baines, take your post.

848
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:46,154
Fire on my command.

849
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:52,578
(gun booming)

850
01:05:52,786 --> 01:05:54,204
Step back.

851
01:06:03,714 --> 01:06:05,757
Last chance, Baines.

852
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:08,093
Fire now, or I will.

853
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:10,971
(tense music)

854
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:21,356
(cannon booming)

855
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:42,252
(anxious music)

856
01:06:57,601 --> 01:06:58,393
Baines.

857
01:06:59,937 --> 01:07:02,022
(fire hydrant thumping)

858
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:11,698
(tense music)

859
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:33,345
(keys jingling)

860
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:45,315
(downhearted music)

861
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:52,239
(keys jingling)

862
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:55,701
- Are you all right?

863
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:56,535
- Where is he?

864
01:07:56,535 --> 01:07:57,578
- Store room.

865
01:07:57,578 --> 01:07:58,370
- I'm gonna kill him.

866
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,329
- Wait, stop.

867
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:01,832
No, hey, Baines, no no no.

868
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:03,375
(body thumping)
Hey, no.

869
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,169
- Hey, hey.

870
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:08,005
(fist thumping)

871
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:11,091
(downhearted music)

872
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:18,014
- You're okay, you're fine.

873
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:34,865
Shit.
(sorrowful music)

874
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:35,050
(Baines sobbing)

875
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:38,136
(downhearted music)

876
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:01,618
(radio static)

877
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:04,496
- [Computer]
Dropping connection.

878
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:19,094
(computer beeping)
Connection dropped.

879
01:10:25,726 --> 01:10:28,603
- And we need to move from
staggered six hour shifts

880
01:10:28,603 --> 01:10:31,732
to eight hours, with
two on and one off.

881
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:35,903
Until Hendrichs is-
- We're not letting him out.

882
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:39,114
- [Cassidy] He needs
the iodine bath.

883
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:42,409
- We are not letting him out.

884
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:48,040
- Okay.

885
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:52,002
And-
- And I quit.

886
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,596
(bottle thudding)

887
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:05,599
- I guess that means 12 hour
shifts with one on and one off.

888
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:09,436
We try to contact home.

889
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,481
Maybe it's only
625 that's blocked.

890
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,441
We'll give the
other channels a go.

891
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:17,568
One a day, starting at 001.

892
01:11:17,568 --> 01:11:19,737
- There's a thousand channels,
we'll be at it three years.

893
01:11:19,737 --> 01:11:21,448
- We're not exactly
going anywhere.

894
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:33,544
- Sully, those things I said,

895
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:40,550
I really wanted you
to go on the boat.

896
01:11:43,136 --> 01:11:45,472
To get home safe.

897
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:51,061
Don't punish me for that.

898
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:07,702
(fork clattering)

899
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:21,842
(plate clattering)

900
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:25,971
- Why?

901
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:30,893
Why change your
mind about us going?

902
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:35,189
- I'm here for the same
reasons you are, Sullivan.

903
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:36,481
- Cash?

904
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:38,775
- We both know you won't
be seeing any money.

905
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:41,486
You traded four years in the can

906
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:43,280
for two years in this place.

907
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:45,949
That was your deal.

908
01:12:50,077 --> 01:12:52,789
And I'm here because
it's the only command

909
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:54,499
they would give me.

910
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:58,587
We're both here to atone our
sins, and earn a second chance.

911
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:06,344
- Enjoy your meal.

912
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:09,139
- The boat was here
three months ago.

913
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:15,728
I recreated the
route from the e-log.

914
01:13:18,232 --> 01:13:23,403
They got to 10 miles due east,
changed course, away from us.

915
01:13:24,237 --> 01:13:26,198
The engine stopped
five miles north.

916
01:13:26,823 --> 01:13:28,742
After that, they were drifting.

917
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:31,577
(anxious music)

918
01:13:31,577 --> 01:13:34,081
There are two questions now.

919
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:38,001
Why didn't we see it, and why
did the boat change course

920
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:42,005
if all they had to do
was follow our beacon.

921
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:43,799
(tense music)

922
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:44,842
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

923
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:52,139
- Here we are, and
here they come.

924
01:13:54,226 --> 01:13:57,437
4.38 they start to change course

925
01:13:57,437 --> 01:14:00,190
and half an hour
later they stop here.

926
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:03,986
It's a curve.

927
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:05,529
A curve, you understand?

928
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:08,156
- No.

929
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:10,409
- It means they didn't
change course once,

930
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:11,994
they kept changing.

931
01:14:12,786 --> 01:14:14,413
And then they stopped here.

932
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:16,623
Why stop?

933
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:21,295
Unless they thought
they'd arrived.

934
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:24,882
(tense music)

935
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,758
- Why didn't you
tell us last night?

936
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:29,761
Why blow up the boat?

937
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:34,057
Why didn't you tell us?

938
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:40,189
Unless this is what you wanted?

939
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:43,734
To keep us here.

940
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:45,736
(knife clicking)

941
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:48,864
Because you think one of us
has something to do with it?

942
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:51,241
- Whatever happens Sullivan
we have to make sure

943
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:53,660
that they won't get their
hands on the device.

944
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:57,121
You have to get me out, Sully.

945
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:02,252
- That was a hell of a blow
you took to the head, Sarge.

946
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:06,380
(tense music)

947
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:10,552
- Sully, you have to get me out.

948
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:14,389
(door thudding)

949
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:17,059
(beacon buzzing)

950
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:23,106
(morse code beeping)

951
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:30,531
(lever tapping)

952
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:35,786
(computer beeping)

953
01:15:35,786 --> 01:15:38,705
- [Computer]
Dropping connection.

954
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:48,715
(bottles clinking)

955
01:15:55,973 --> 01:16:00,853
Connection dropped.
(computer beeping)

956
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:04,481
(children's music)

957
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:25,544
(tense music)

958
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:32,509
(fist thumping)

959
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:35,012
(tense music)

960
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:25,062
(gentle music)

961
01:17:28,607 --> 01:17:30,108
- You look happy.

962
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:33,820
- That's not me.

963
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:40,410
I'm the grumpy girl there.

964
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:47,751
That's my brother and
those are my parents.

965
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:56,175
One day a photographer was
coming to our local pier.

966
01:17:58,094 --> 01:18:02,266
Taking photos for
cash or exchange.

967
01:18:04,809 --> 01:18:05,727
It was raining.

968
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:11,608
I wanted the bigger
umbrella that my brother had

969
01:18:14,193 --> 01:18:16,487
and those little blue boots.

970
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:25,163
So, here I am protesting
the unfairness of it all.

971
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:31,460
And this is the only
photo of us ever taken.

972
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:40,137
The next year I was
sent away to school.

973
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:42,639
And there was an enemy raid.

974
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:46,977
And they were all killed.

975
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:51,607
(gentle music)

976
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:58,030
- [Sullivan] All I
remember from my childhood

977
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:59,823
was the constant heat.

978
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:02,367
Never rain.

979
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:09,666
There are a lot of
things I don't remember.

980
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:17,466
(anxious music)

981
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:25,264
(waves lapping)

982
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:50,332
(switch clicking)

983
01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:08,267
(rain splattering)

984
01:20:19,443 --> 01:20:22,114
(door thudding)

985
01:20:28,912 --> 01:20:32,040
(generator chugging)

986
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:41,383
(radar beeping)

987
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:49,766
- Jesus.

988
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:08,285
(rain pattering)

989
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:17,002
Are you okay?

990
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:20,297
(tense music)

991
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:24,425
- Together we seek better

992
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:27,846
and more sustainable
ways forward.

993
01:21:28,972 --> 01:21:29,932
- What?

994
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:31,266
How much have you had to drink?

995
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:36,146
- This is a promise
we give to our future.

996
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:38,690
- Baines, what are you...

997
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:07,094
(Cassidy thudding)
(Cassidy groaning)

998
01:22:10,722 --> 01:22:12,683
- Get off me.

999
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:13,475
Get off.

1000
01:22:15,853 --> 01:22:20,898
(elbow thumping)
(Baines groaning)

1001
01:22:20,898 --> 01:22:22,484
What the fuck.

1002
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:24,193
What the fuck, Baines.

1003
01:22:24,987 --> 01:22:25,737
Sober up.

1004
01:22:26,864 --> 01:22:29,532
(anxious music)

1005
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:33,579
(door thudding)

1006
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:36,415
Sully, it's Baines,
he's lost it.

1007
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:39,251
- You all right?

1008
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:41,837
- [Baines] We reach towards
the summit of possibility

1009
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:46,675
to make the best for the
most using the least.

1010
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:49,094
- He just needs
to sober up, okay?

1011
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:52,556
- [Baines] With purity of
form and clarity of purpose

1012
01:22:53,432 --> 01:22:58,103
being constant in our ideals
and trustful in our mission.

1013
01:22:58,103 --> 01:22:59,353
- No.

1014
01:22:59,353 --> 01:23:01,690
- Were making elegance
meet innovation

1015
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:06,862
and simplicity from
this day until the last.

1016
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:09,698
(tense music)

1017
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:20,751
This is our vision.

1018
01:23:22,628 --> 01:23:25,714
Simple, stylish, comfortable,

1019
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:30,969
elegant, innovative.

1020
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:36,892
(button beeping)

1021
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:42,814
Teamwork is the essence
of the BORG culture.

1022
01:23:44,483 --> 01:23:48,403
Together, creative, hopeful,

1023
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:51,240
we share a common goal.

1024
01:23:53,157 --> 01:23:55,202
- This is not a
common goal, buddy.

1025
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:57,704
- Can you imagine how many
shades of fabric they have?

1026
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:01,875
27.

1027
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:06,255
Do you know who started it?

1028
01:24:07,798 --> 01:24:09,216
Mart.

1029
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:10,092
In Estonia.

1030
01:24:13,804 --> 01:24:14,680
It was a country.

1031
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:20,018
A small country.

1032
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:22,563
There were a lot of them.
- Yeah.

1033
01:24:22,563 --> 01:24:24,189
- [Baines] Big and small.

1034
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:26,358
- That's good to know, pal.

1035
01:24:29,318 --> 01:24:30,320
- Baines.

1036
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,405
- You don't care about history.

1037
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:32,906
- I do, Baines.

1038
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:35,909
Me and Cass, we were just
talking about that earlier.

1039
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:38,452
But let's not make
history today, hmm?

1040
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:43,250
(button beeping)
Wait, wait wait.

1041
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:44,459
Listen, listen Baines.

1042
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:47,296
This is no way to go.

1043
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:51,383
What about Liz, hmm?

1044
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:57,389
Of all the dumb ways to go,
what would Liz say to this?

1045
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:58,849
Let's leave Martha alone.

1046
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:03,728
Hey man, we all deserve better.

1047
01:25:03,728 --> 01:25:07,316
(Baines laughing)

1048
01:25:07,316 --> 01:25:09,985
(tense music)

1049
01:25:18,577 --> 01:25:19,536
- Baines.

1050
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:30,047
- Okay, man.

1051
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:32,341
Hey.

1052
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:36,469
Hey, it's okay.

1053
01:25:36,469 --> 01:25:39,223
(Baines sobbing)

1054
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:44,937
Hey, hey, Baines,
man, it's all right.

1055
01:25:44,937 --> 01:25:47,564
It's okay.
(buttons clicking)

1056
01:25:47,564 --> 01:25:50,234
(keys jingling)

1057
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:58,116
- (chuckles) I forgot
the last number.

1058
01:25:59,535 --> 01:26:02,412
(Baines laughing)

1059
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:06,416
(bomb whirring)

1060
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:09,294
- It's okay.

1061
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:11,672
It's okay.

1062
01:26:15,675 --> 01:26:16,802
I'm letting Hendrichs out.

1063
01:26:16,802 --> 01:26:17,636
- [Baines] He's gone.

1064
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:21,557
(tense music)

1065
01:26:21,557 --> 01:26:23,225
- What do you mean?

1066
01:26:23,225 --> 01:26:28,146
- I wanted to kill him,
but he was already gone.

1067
01:26:30,023 --> 01:26:32,317
Did it to himself.

1068
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:34,778
(tense music)

1069
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:51,712
(rain splattering)
(tense music)

1070
01:27:04,516 --> 01:27:07,477
(Baines chuckling)

1071
01:27:12,482 --> 01:27:15,277
(Peter flapping)

1072
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:11,959
(computer beeping)

1073
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:14,294
- [Computer]
Establishing connection.

1074
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:18,715
(morse code beeping)

1075
01:28:37,234 --> 01:28:39,903
(door rattling)

1076
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:56,753
(metronome clicking)

1077
01:29:04,469 --> 01:29:07,264
(pages rustling)

1078
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:18,483
- [Cassidy] Storm
front incoming.

1079
01:29:18,525 --> 01:29:20,818
ETA three hours to full contact.

1080
01:29:22,905 --> 01:29:24,740
- [Sullivan] It's
two days early.

1081
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,366
- That's what it does.

1082
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:28,035
It changes.

1083
01:29:30,954 --> 01:29:32,748
Possible salvage,
due north west.

1084
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:35,209
- Alone?

1085
01:29:37,169 --> 01:29:38,170
- We need the material.

1086
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:49,556
(door creaking)

1087
01:29:57,272 --> 01:30:00,067
(chain rattling)

1088
01:30:04,487 --> 01:30:05,656
- You seen this?

1089
01:30:08,325 --> 01:30:09,117
- He's back.

1090
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:11,286
Fixing things.

1091
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:15,040
(door creaking)

1092
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,832
- I'll drive.

1093
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:20,379
- It may do him some good.

1094
01:30:34,601 --> 01:30:37,521
(Baines sighing)

1095
01:30:38,605 --> 01:30:40,232
- She was pregnant.

1096
01:30:40,232 --> 01:30:41,023
Liz.

1097
01:30:44,987 --> 01:30:47,531
She was six months
in when I left.

1098
01:30:49,157 --> 01:30:51,326
I don't even know if
it's a boy or a girl.

1099
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:02,921
Sully, I wanted to-
- No, save it.

1100
01:31:04,798 --> 01:31:06,425
Go.

1101
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:09,511
Go salvage some useful
shit before I blow you up.

1102
01:31:10,429 --> 01:31:13,432
(Baines chuckling)

1103
01:31:14,933 --> 01:31:17,227
And look after her, hmm?

1104
01:31:22,065 --> 01:31:23,192
(Sullivan chuckling)

1105
01:31:23,192 --> 01:31:24,401
Oh, yeah.

1106
01:31:29,489 --> 01:31:30,949
It's okay.

1107
01:31:30,949 --> 01:31:32,201
Bring me something nice.

1108
01:31:33,619 --> 01:31:35,077
- Sully, I did it.

1109
01:31:35,077 --> 01:31:35,913
- You fixed the sink?

1110
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:38,207
- Sink?

1111
01:31:38,207 --> 01:31:39,875
Fixed that a week ago.

1112
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,919
- Mother fucker.

1113
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:45,214
- Cats, horses, swallows.

1114
01:31:46,507 --> 01:31:48,634
(door thudding)

1115
01:31:48,634 --> 01:31:51,553
(chain rattling)

1116
01:31:58,559 --> 01:32:00,812
- [Sullivan] Just in case.

1117
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:16,577
(tender music)

1118
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:36,932
(water rippling)

1119
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:43,981
(waves bobbing)

1120
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:52,155
(wheel creaking)

1121
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,496
(tense music)

1122
01:33:11,049 --> 01:33:13,927
(winch tattering)

1123
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:18,932
(waves lapping)

1124
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:31,612
(tense music)

1125
01:33:33,572 --> 01:33:36,657
(Sullivan groaning)

1126
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:51,465
(Sullivan groaning)

1127
01:33:56,344 --> 01:33:58,805
(tense music)

1128
01:34:05,187 --> 01:34:08,065
(waves lapping)

1129
01:34:12,945 --> 01:34:15,531
(uneasy music)

1130
01:34:30,128 --> 01:34:33,130
(drawers thudding)

1131
01:34:42,307 --> 01:34:44,726
(tense music)

1132
01:34:57,614 --> 01:35:00,576
(thunder rumbling)

1133
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:05,496
(rain splattering)

1134
01:35:09,626 --> 01:35:12,087
(tense music)

1135
01:35:22,347 --> 01:35:25,309
(rain splattering)

1136
01:35:26,684 --> 01:35:29,478
(beacon humming)

1137
01:35:57,799 --> 01:36:00,219
(tense music)

1138
01:36:03,597 --> 01:36:06,099
(uneasy music)

1139
01:36:23,032 --> 01:36:26,036
(items clattering)

1140
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:39,216
- I don't like it, Sarge,
it should be right here.

1141
01:36:40,175 --> 01:36:42,094
It must have gone.

1142
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:45,597
- If it'd gone,
there'd be no signal.

1143
01:36:45,597 --> 01:36:48,559
(rain splattering)

1144
01:36:50,434 --> 01:36:52,896
(tense music)

1145
01:36:58,568 --> 01:37:01,362
(waves crashing)

1146
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:06,952
(items clattering)

1147
01:37:08,662 --> 01:37:11,123
(tense music)

1148
01:37:20,674 --> 01:37:21,466
- Sarge.

1149
01:37:22,384 --> 01:37:25,137
(waves crashing)

1150
01:37:27,472 --> 01:37:31,059
(rain splattering)

1151
01:37:31,059 --> 01:37:33,520
(tense music)

1152
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,112
- Hello?

1153
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:45,657
Are you okay?

1154
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,918
(radar beeping)

1155
01:38:01,255 --> 01:38:04,259
(waves crashing)

1156
01:38:09,264 --> 01:38:10,057
Hello.

1157
01:38:12,184 --> 01:38:12,893
Hello?

1158
01:38:13,809 --> 01:38:16,480
(tense music)

1159
01:38:40,587 --> 01:38:41,672
Are you okay?

1160
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:51,264
(gun booming)

1161
01:38:56,562 --> 01:38:59,356
(uneasy music)

1162
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:08,907
- Sully.

1163
01:39:11,785 --> 01:39:12,911
I begged him.

1164
01:39:15,664 --> 01:39:18,416
He climbed off
across the plastic

1165
01:39:19,793 --> 01:39:22,045
and he wouldn't come back.

1166
01:39:25,424 --> 01:39:26,216
I'm sorry.

1167
01:39:28,886 --> 01:39:31,889
(Cassidy sobbing)

1168
01:39:39,313 --> 01:39:42,065
(uneasy music)

1169
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:04,338
(Cassidy gasping)

1170
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:13,722
Sully?

1171
01:40:56,889 --> 01:41:00,477
(radio squelching)
Sully?

1172
01:41:05,607 --> 01:41:08,693
(radio squelching)
Sully, I'm sorry I slept in.

1173
01:41:08,693 --> 01:41:10,571
Come in, are you there?

1174
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,829
(radio squelching)

1175
01:41:19,162 --> 01:41:20,330
That thing you gave me.

1176
01:41:21,707 --> 01:41:23,416
The metal globe.

1177
01:41:25,377 --> 01:41:27,588
I think I figured
out what it is.

1178
01:41:29,214 --> 01:41:31,258
It's funny, you'll like it.

1179
01:41:31,258 --> 01:41:33,760
(radio squelching)

1180
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,305
(uneasy music)

1181
01:41:39,516 --> 01:41:40,976
(radio squelching)
Sully?

1182
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:47,691
(door creaking)

1183
01:41:49,735 --> 01:41:50,527
Sully?

1184
01:41:55,365 --> 01:41:56,157
Sullivan?

1185
01:41:58,535 --> 01:42:00,037
(radio squelching)
- I'm here.

1186
01:42:08,003 --> 01:42:10,422
It was his third tour out here.

1187
01:42:10,422 --> 01:42:11,215
Hendrichs.

1188
01:42:13,342 --> 01:42:15,260
He wanted to stay.

1189
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:16,469
Put that in his report.

1190
01:42:19,348 --> 01:42:20,474
Asking for another shift.

1191
01:42:23,769 --> 01:42:25,062
He didn't want to leave.

1192
01:42:32,027 --> 01:42:33,445
(radio squelching)

1193
01:42:33,445 --> 01:42:37,157
- Sully, his mental state
was so unpredictable.

1194
01:42:40,661 --> 01:42:42,204
You saw what happened to him.

1195
01:42:48,502 --> 01:42:51,588
- [Sullivan] What
did happen to him?

1196
01:42:53,924 --> 01:42:55,759
He didn't kill himself.

1197
01:42:58,094 --> 01:42:59,513
But you know that.

1198
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:01,264
Don't you?

1199
01:43:08,438 --> 01:43:10,273
And the relief crew?

1200
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,986
(uneasy music)

1201
01:43:18,824 --> 01:43:20,242
I know it was you.

1202
01:43:24,996 --> 01:43:26,832
I know why you're here.

1203
01:43:28,709 --> 01:43:31,295
(uneasy music)

1204
01:43:53,108 --> 01:43:54,860
(radio squelching)
- Sullivan.

1205
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,239
Sullivan, what do you mean?

1206
01:44:00,616 --> 01:44:03,660
I don't understand.
(radio squelching)

1207
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:06,663
- [Sullivan] I can't
let you have it.

1208
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:10,501
(radio squelching)

1209
01:44:10,501 --> 01:44:12,252
- Let me have what?

1210
01:44:16,423 --> 01:44:19,425
(bomb whirring)

1211
01:44:23,222 --> 01:44:26,099
(worrisome music)

1212
01:44:26,099 --> 01:44:28,101
(bomb whirring)

1213
01:44:32,814 --> 01:44:35,817
(computer beeping)

1214
01:44:48,246 --> 01:44:51,124
(buttons beeping)

1215
01:44:53,043 --> 01:44:53,835
Sullivan.

1216
01:44:56,713 --> 01:44:58,215
What are you doing?

1217
01:44:58,215 --> 01:45:00,884
I don't understand.
- Just stop.

1218
01:45:03,762 --> 01:45:04,763
- Stop what?

1219
01:45:07,014 --> 01:45:08,016
- It's over.

1220
01:45:10,434 --> 01:45:12,187
You really played me.

1221
01:45:12,187 --> 01:45:12,938
- Sully.

1222
01:45:16,608 --> 01:45:19,443
- Hooked me like
a big dumb fish.

1223
01:45:21,612 --> 01:45:22,364
- No.

1224
01:45:26,702 --> 01:45:28,452
- It never rained on our side.

1225
01:45:30,706 --> 01:45:33,541
(sorrowful music)

1226
01:45:42,718 --> 01:45:44,344
- I hated lying to you (sobs).

1227
01:45:46,889 --> 01:45:50,225
(computer beeping)

1228
01:45:50,225 --> 01:45:53,103
Sully, listen to me.

1229
01:45:53,103 --> 01:45:56,231
- Don't.
- My homeland is sinking.

1230
01:45:56,231 --> 01:45:59,985
My people will perish if I
didn't get hold of that thing.

1231
01:46:01,403 --> 01:46:03,572
All I want is to
end their suffering.

1232
01:46:03,572 --> 01:46:05,365
- So that someone else
would suffer instead?

1233
01:46:07,159 --> 01:46:08,911
No one should have it.

1234
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:12,496
Not your people, not mine.

1235
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:17,169
No one.

1236
01:46:17,169 --> 01:46:18,212
(computer beeping)
- Sully.

1237
01:46:18,212 --> 01:46:19,046
- Like you said, Cass.

1238
01:46:20,172 --> 01:46:24,175
We just keep on fucking up.

1239
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:29,097
(Cassidy sobbing)

1240
01:46:30,724 --> 01:46:32,184
- That's how it is.

1241
01:46:35,312 --> 01:46:37,773
- It doesn't have to be.

1242
01:46:37,773 --> 01:46:42,945
(uplifting music)
(computer beeping)

1243
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:48,200
(tense music)

1244
01:46:59,378 --> 01:47:02,255
(Cassidy gasping)

1245
01:47:12,349 --> 01:47:15,227
(waves lapping)

1246
01:47:17,521 --> 01:47:20,523
(computer beeping)

1247
01:47:44,715 --> 01:47:45,507
- What?

1248
01:47:49,887 --> 01:47:52,889
(computer beeping)

1249
01:48:00,022 --> 01:48:02,773
(bomb whirring)

1250
01:48:04,193 --> 01:48:05,777
- Baines.

1251
01:48:05,777 --> 01:48:08,780
(bomb whirring)

1252
01:49:10,925 --> 01:49:13,219
We're not leaning anymore.

1253
01:49:15,389 --> 01:49:16,348
- No.

1254
01:49:20,769 --> 01:49:22,521
And we're still here.

1255
01:49:31,737 --> 01:49:32,948
- So what now?

1256
01:49:38,370 --> 01:49:40,205
- Now it's up to us.

1257
01:49:43,541 --> 01:49:45,502
- And if someone comes?

1258
01:49:49,423 --> 01:49:50,215
- Yours?

1259
01:49:53,969 --> 01:49:54,928
- Or yours.

1260
01:49:56,305 --> 01:49:59,099
(tender music)

1261
01:50:00,893 --> 01:50:03,437
- Then we protect the swallows.

1262
01:50:07,858 --> 01:50:08,650
Together.

1263
01:50:14,615 --> 01:50:16,867
And with everything we have.

1264
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:31,255
- So, what is it?

1265
01:50:32,382 --> 01:50:34,927
(tender music)

1266
01:51:06,291 --> 01:51:08,960
(bird tweeting)

1267
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:15,634
(birds tweeting)

1268
01:51:18,804 --> 01:51:21,473
(upbeat music)

1269
01:52:21,325 --> 01:52:24,036
(upbeat music)

1270
01:52:53,398 --> 01:52:55,859
(tense music)

1271
01:53:55,335 --> 01:53:57,880
(tense music)

1272
01:54:57,606 --> 01:55:00,359
(gentle music)

1273
01:55:59,334 --> 01:56:01,962
(gentle music)
