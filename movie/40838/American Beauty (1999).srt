1408
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:36,873
The world...

1409
01:51:36,959 --> 01:51:41,589
...ls round

1410
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:46,311
Ahhh

1411
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:48,399
Ahh

1412
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:52,950
Because the wind is high...

1413
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:58,636
...It blows my mind

1414
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:02,958
Because

1415
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:05,428
The wind...

1416
01:52:05,519 --> 01:52:10,070
...ls high

1417
01:52:11,999 --> 01:52:15,594
Ahhh, ahh

1418
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:18,477
Love is old, Love is new

1419
01:52:21,319 --> 01:52:24,072
Love is all, Love is you

1420
01:52:28,559 --> 01:52:33,030
Because the sky is blue...

1421
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:38,751
...It makes me cry

1422
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:42,957
Because

1423
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:45,507
The sky...

1424
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:50,115
...Is blue

1425
01:52:51,919 --> 01:52:54,638
Ahhh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

1426
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:56,789
Ahhh, ahh, ahh

1427
01:52:56,879 --> 01:52:58,879
Ah, ah, ah

1428
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:05,759
Ahhh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

1429
01:53:05,839 --> 01:53:08,592
Ahh, ah, ah, ah

1430
01:53:08,679 --> 01:53:10,679
Ahhh

1431
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:18,073
Ahhh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

1432
01:53:19,879 --> 01:53:22,552
Ahhh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

1433
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:24,639
