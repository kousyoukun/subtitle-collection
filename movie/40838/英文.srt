Wait till you see the native stone fireplace!

137

A simple cream could really lighten things up. You could even put in a skylight.

Well, why don't we go into the kitchen ?

139
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:56,543

Just filled with positive energy, huh ?

141
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,645
And you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can cut down on your energy costs.

142
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,096
You know,you could have some fun backyard get-togethers out here.

143
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:18,066
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like. There's nothing lagoon-like about it.

144
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:21,966
Except for maybe the bugs. There aren't even any plants out here.

145
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:25,036
What do you call this ? Is this not a plant ?

146
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:28,511
If you have a problem with the plants, I can always call my landscape architect.

147
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:33,213
- Solved. - I mean, I think ''lagoon,'' I think waterfall, tropical.

148
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:36,184
This is a cement hole.

149
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,823
I have some tiki torches in the garage.

They're trying to, you know, take an active interest in me.

155

[ Lester] What makes you sure she wants us to be there ? Did she ask us to come ?

158
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:32,265
Of course not. She doesn't want us to know how important this is to her.

159
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:34,394
But she's been practicing for weeks.

160
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,233
I'll bet she's going to resent it, 

161
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,831
and I'm missing theJames Bond marathon on T.N.T.

162
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,899
Lester, this is important.

163
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:44,003
I'm sensing a real distance growing between you and Jane.

164
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,674
''Growing'' ? She hates me.

165
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:48,578
- She's just willful.

166
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:50,175
- She hates you too.

167
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:01,822
- Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry. - Pardon me.

168
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:04,389
-[ Buzzer Sounding ] - Hi ! Patty !

169
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:11,837
Now, for your halftime entertainment, Rockwell High's award-winning Dancing Spartanettes!

170
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:14,276
We can leave right after this, right ?

171
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:30,574
Shit. They're still here.

172
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,010
Janie ! Hey, I really enjoyed that.

173
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:37,245
-Congratulations, honey. You were great.

174
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,252
-I didn't win anything.

175
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,084
- Hi. I'm Lester,Janie's dad.

176
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:42,022
- Oh, hi.

177
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:47,253
This is my friend, Angela Hayes.

178
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:50,622
Okay. Good to meet you.

179
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:53,758
You were also good tonight,

180
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:56,103
very... precise.

181
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:57,265
- Thanks.

182
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,108
- Nice to meet you, Angela.Honey-- 

183
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:05,711
[ Grunts ] I am so proud of you. You know, I watched you very closely. You didn't screw up once.

184
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:09,579
Okay, uh, we have to go.

185
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:11,211
- So what are you girls doing now ?

186
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:12,652
- Dad.

187
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:14,384
- We're going out for pizza. 

188
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:17,239
- Really ? Do you need a ride ? We can give you a ride.- I have

189
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:19,722
a car. You want to come with us ? - Thanks, but I have a car.

190
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:23,323
You have a car. That's great. That's great.

191
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:26,630
Janie's thinking about getting a car, too, soon, aren't you ?

192
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:28,966
Dad, Mom's waiting for you.

193
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,669
Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela.

194
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:37,213
Any friend ofJanie's...

195
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:41,707
is a... friend of mine. [ Exhales ]

196
00:18:44,987 --> 00:18:48,889
Well... I'll be seeing you around, then.

197
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:57,326
Could he be any more... pathetic ?

198
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,397
I think he's sweet.

199
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:04,905
And I think he and your mother have not had sex in a long time.

200
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:24,125
[ Lester Narrating ] It's the weirdest thing.

201
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:28,695
I feel like I've been in a coma for about 20 years...

202
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,195
and I'm just now waking up.

203
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,594
Spec-tacular.

204
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,011
I'm so sorry my dad was weird tonight.

205
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:21,083
That's okay.

206
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:24,177
I'm used to guys drooling over me.

207
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:27,885
It started when I was about 1 2.

208
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:31,052
I'd go to dinner with my parents.

209
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,888
Every Thursday night: Red Lobster. [ Chuckles ]

210
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:39,527
Every guy there would stare at me when I walked in. And I knew what they were thinking,

211
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:42,399
just like I knew guys at school thought about me when they jerked off.

212
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:44,595
- Vomit. 

213
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:51,144
- No. I liked it.I still like it. If people I don't even know look at me and want to fuck me,

214
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:54,910
it means I really have a shot at being a model.

215
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:57,247
Which is great,

216
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,757
because there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary.

217
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,392
I really think it'll happen for you.

218
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:10,622
I know.

219
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:16,467
Because everything that was meant to happen, does... eventually.

220
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:43,421
Asshole.

221
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,941


222
00:22:48,597 --> 00:22:50,326
[ Angela ] Hello ? 

223
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,692
Hello ?

224
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:10,378
- Hello ? - Why'd you call me ?

225
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:11,842
I didn't.

226
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:15,283
Well, my phone just rang and I answered it, and somebody hung up.

227
00:23:15,357 --> 00:23:17,257
- And I star-69ed, and I called you back.

228
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:19,257
- Well, I was in the shower.

229
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:25,833
Oh, gross !

230
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,116
[ Woman ] Ricky! Breakfast!

231
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:47,884
Be right there.

232
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,564
- Mom. - Hello.

233
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,893
I don't eat bacon, remember ?

234
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:04,537
I'm sorry. I must've forgotten.

235
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:17,979
What's new in the world, Dad ?

236
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:22,385
This country is going straight to hell.

237
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,497
- Are you expecting anyone ? - No.

238
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:37,800
No.

239
00:24:45,347 --> 00:24:47,372
- Hi. - Welcome to the neighborhood.

240
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:48,939
- It's just a little something from our garden. 

241
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:51,248
- Except for the pasta.- We got that at Fallaci's. - Right.

242
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:54,479
It's unbelievably fresh.You just-- You drop it in the water, and it's done.

243
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:57,751
Jim Olmeyer. 

244
00:24:57,826 --> 00:24:59,919
Two doors down. Welcome to the neighborhood.

245
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:02,361
Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

246
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,565
- It's nice to meet you. This is my partner--

247
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,032
-Jim Berkley, but call meJ.B.

248
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,193
Let's cut to chase, okay ?

249
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:09,396
What are you guys selling ?

250
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:13,607
- [ Chuckles ] We-- - Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors.

251
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:19,171
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you're partners, so what's your business ?

252
00:25:20,816 --> 00:25:22,010
Well... 

253
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:24,819
he is a tax attorney.

254
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,783
And he's an anesthesiologist.

255
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:40,568
How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face ?

256
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:44,469
How can they be so shameless ?

257
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:52,277
- That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't feel that's anything to be ashamed of.

258
00:25:53,415 --> 00:25:55,383
Well, it is.

259
00:25:57,553 --> 00:25:58,542
- Yeah, you're right.

260
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:01,912
- Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy.

261
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:07,758
Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly,

262
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:10,727
but those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out.

263
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:20,039
Well, me too, son.

264
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:22,939
Yeah. Me too.

265
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:32,882
[ Angela ] I'm serious. He just pulled down his pants and yanked it out.

266
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:35,480
- You know, like, "Say hello to Mr. Happy. "

267
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:36,546
- Gross !

268
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:39,861
- It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.

269
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:41,428
- So did you do it with him ?

270
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:42,828
Of course. 

271
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,757
He's a really well-known photographer.

272
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:48,698
He shoots for Elle on, like, a regular basis.

273
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:51,365
- It would've been majorly stupid of me to turn him down.

274
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,574
- You are a total prostitute.

275
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:57,740
Hey, that's how things really are.

276
00:26:57,946 --> 00:27:01,575
You just don't know because you're this pampered little suburban chick.

277
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:02,773
So are you.

278
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,376
 You've only been in Seventeen once, and you looked fat.

279
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:08,582
So stop acting like you're goddamn Christy Turlington !

280
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,649
Cunt !

281
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:18,399
I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me.

282
00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:21,096
- Oh, my God. 

283
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:23,669
That's the pervert who filmed me last night.

284
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:24,398
- Him ?

285
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,506
Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic.

286
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,774
- Do you know him ? - Yeah.

287
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,871
We were on the same lunch shift when I was in ninth grade,

288
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:35,439
and he would always save the most random, weird things.

289
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:39,351
And then one day, he was just, like, gone.

290
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,080
And then 

291
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:45,783
Connie Cardullo told me that his parents had to put him in a mental institution.

292
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:48,023
Why ? What did he do ?

293
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:49,986
What do you mean ?

294
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:54,527
Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things.

295
00:27:57,506 --> 00:28:00,805
You total slut. You've got a crush on him.

296
00:28:01,677 --> 00:28:04,113
- What ? Please ! - You are defending him. You love him.

297
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:08,980
- You want to have, like, 1 0,000 of his babies. - Shut up.

298
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:13,351
Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next door to you.

299
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:14,889
I know.

300
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:20,195
I kind of remember this creepy incident where you were filming me last night ?

301
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:22,959
- I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.

302
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:24,160
- Thanks.

303
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:28,168
But I really don't need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now.

304
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:30,865
I'm not obsessing.

305
00:28:31,506 --> 00:28:32,837
I'm just curious.

306
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,052
What a freak.

307
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:53,293
And why does he dress like a Bible salesman ?

308
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:57,191
He's, like, so confident.

309
00:28:58,066 --> 00:28:59,499
That can't be real.

310
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:02,564
I don't believe him.

311
00:29:03,438 --> 00:29:06,601
I mean, he didn't even, like, look at me once.

312
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,813
- How'd you get in the Army?

313
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:16,440
-Sergeant, I got three reasons for being in the Army.

314
00:29:16,851 --> 00:29:19,376

Well, I'm the only one who seems to be doing anything about it.

473
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:06,156
[ Grunts ] Lester, I refuse to live like this !

474
00:45:06,832 --> 00:45:08,265
This is not a marriage.

475
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:11,566
This hasn't been a marriage for years,

476
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:14,197
but you were happy as long as I kept my mouth shut.

477
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:16,637
Well, guess what. I've changed.

478
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:19,200
And the new me whacks off when he feels horny...

479
00:45:19,278 --> 00:45:21,678
'cause you're obviously not going to help me out in that department.

480
00:45:21,747 --> 00:45:24,910
I see. You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated.

481
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:28,116
I'm not ? Well, then, come on, baby. I'm ready.

482
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:30,221
Don't you mess with me, mister.

483
00:45:30,289 --> 00:45:33,588
I will divorce you so fast, it'll make your head spin.

484
00:45:33,759 --> 00:45:35,920
On what grounds ?

485
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:38,553
I'm not a drunk. I don't fuck other women.

486
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:40,758
I don't mistreat you. I've never hit you.

487
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,432
I don't even try to touch you, since you made it so abundantly clear

488
00:45:43,432 --> 00:45:46,032
just how unnecessary you consider me to be !

489
00:45:48,374 --> 00:45:51,571
But... I did support you when you got your license.

490
00:45:51,644 --> 00:45:55,205
And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours.

491
00:45:55,681 --> 00:46:01,476
Oh ! So, turn out the light when you come back to bed, okay ?

492
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,896
It's a great thing when you realize you still have... the ability to surprise yourself.

493
00:46:19,972 --> 00:46:24,042
Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about.

494
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:26,044
Hey, guys.

495
00:46:26,278 --> 00:46:28,075
Lester. I didn't know you ran.

496
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:29,675
- I just started.

497
00:46:29,815 --> 00:46:30,839
- Good for you.

498
00:46:31,116 --> 00:46:35,143
Ifigured you guys might be able to give me some pointers. I need to shape up, fast.

499
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,154
Are you looking to just lose weight, or do you want to have...

500
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:40,683
increased strength and flexibility as well ?

501
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:44,517
I-- I want to look good naked.

502
00:46:59,745 --> 00:47:01,178
Oh, what is this ?

503
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,144
Fuckin'gay pride parade ?

504
00:47:05,017 --> 00:47:06,416
Hey ! Yo, Ricky.

505
00:47:09,855 --> 00:47:13,552
My entire life is passing before my eyes, and those two have barely broken a sweat.

506
00:47:14,693 --> 00:47:17,890
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham. I live next door. We haven't met.

507
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:19,894
Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

508
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:24,992
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

509
00:47:29,374 --> 00:47:36,405
Ricky, uh-- I was thinking about the, uh-- I was gonna-- The movie we talked about.

510
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:37,880
- Re-Animator. - Yeah !

511
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,610
You want to borrow it ? Okay. It's up in my room.

512
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:41,850
 Come on.

513
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:54,728
- Can you hold this for a sec ? - Sure.

514
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:58,201
I don't think my dad would try to come in while someone else is here,

515
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,567
 but you never know.

516
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:01,538
- What is this ? - Urine.

517
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:06,238
I have to take a drug test every six months just to make sure I'm clean.

518
00:48:07,245 --> 00:48:09,645
Are you kidding ? You just smoked with me last night.

519
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:11,780
It's not mine.

520
00:48:12,718 --> 00:48:15,778
One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office.

521
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:19,848
Cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.

522
00:48:22,427 --> 00:48:23,917
You like Pink Floyd ?

523
00:48:25,731 --> 00:48:27,164
I like a lot of music.

524
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:32,604
Man, I haven't listened to this album in years.

525
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:35,366
How much do you want ?

526
00:48:36,608 --> 00:48:38,701
I don't know. It's been a while.

527
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:40,039
Um, how much is an ounce ?

528
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:46,643
This is totally decent, and it's 300.

529
00:48:49,921 --> 00:48:52,549
This shit is top of the line.

530
00:48:52,758 --> 00:48:56,250
It's called G-1 3. It's genetically engineered by the U.S. government.

531
00:48:56,395 --> 00:49:00,092
It's extremely potent, but a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

532
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,059
Is that what we smoked last night ?

533
00:49:05,137 --> 00:49:06,729
This is all I ever smoke.

534
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:11,674
- How much ?

535
00:49:12,844 --> 00:49:13,833
- Two grand.

536
00:49:14,446 --> 00:49:15,674
Jesus !

537
00:49:16,648 --> 00:49:19,378
Things have changed since 1 973.

538
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,083
- You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it.

539
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,287
- Thanks.

540
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:25,680
There's a card in there with my beeper number.

541
00:49:26,391 --> 00:49:28,188
Beep me anytime, day or night.

542
00:49:30,062 --> 00:49:31,393
And I only accept cash.

543
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,764
Now I know how you can afford all this equipment.

544
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:40,303
God. When I was your age, I flipped burgers all summer just to buy an eight-track.

545
00:49:41,073 --> 00:49:42,005
- That sucks.

546
00:49:42,574 --> 00:49:44,405
- No, actually it was great.

547
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:48,337
All I did was party and get laid.

548
00:49:50,682 --> 00:49:52,582
I had my whole life ahead of me.

549
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:58,588
My dad thinks I pay for all this with catering jobs.

550
00:50:00,325 --> 00:50:02,850
Never underestimate the power of denial.

551
00:50:24,449 --> 00:50:28,408
There must be some way out of here

552
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:30,978
Said the joker to the thief

553
00:50:32,357 --> 00:50:35,952
There's too much confusion

554
00:50:36,728 --> 00:50:39,026
-? I can't get no relief ? - What the hell do you think you're doing ?

555
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:42,766
- Uh-oh. Mom's mad. 

556
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:44,190
Bench presses.

557
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:48,798
I'm going to whale on my pecks, and then I'm going to do my back.

558
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:53,635
I see you're smoking pot now. I-- I'm so glad.

559
00:50:53,979 --> 00:50:59,007
I think using illegal psychotropic substances... is a very positive example to set for our daughter.

560
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:03,217
You're one to talk, you bloodless, money-grubbing freak.

561
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:08,653
Uh-- Lester ! You have such hostility in you.

562
00:51:08,827 --> 00:51:10,624
Do you mind ? I'm trying to work out here.

563
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:12,987
 Unless... you want to spot me.

564
00:51:13,632 --> 00:51:19,863
Lester, you will not get away with this. - You can be sure of that. -There are many here among us

565
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:25,771
- That's... what... -? Who feel that life is but a joke ?? you... think.

566
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:33,211
'' My job consists of basically masking... ''my contempt for the assholes in charge...

567
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:39,183
''and at least once a day retiring to the men's room... ''so I can jerk off...

568
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:45,396
''while I fantasize about a life... that doesn't so closely resemble hell.''

569
00:51:45,697 --> 00:51:49,189
Well, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.

570
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:53,771
Brad, for 1 4 years, I've been a whore for the advertising industry.

571
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,205
The only way I could save myself now is if I start firebombing.

572
00:51:57,342 --> 00:52:00,709
Whatever. Management wants you gone by the end of the day.

573
00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:04,237
Just what sort of severance package is management prepared to offer me,

574
00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:08,886
considering the information I have about our editorial director... buying pussy with company money ?

575
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:13,792
Which I think would interest the I.R.S., since it technically constitutes fraud.

576
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:16,895
And I'm sure that some of our advertisers and rival publications...

577
00:52:16,895 --> 00:52:21,161
might like to know about it as well, not to mention... Craig's wife.

578
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:24,257
- What do you want ?

579
00:52:25,503 --> 00:52:27,528
- One year's salary with benefits.

580
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,306
That's not going to happen.

581
00:52:30,876 --> 00:52:34,175
What do you say I throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot ?

582
00:52:34,246 --> 00:52:38,012
[ Laughing ] Against who ?

583
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,841
[ Laughs ] Against you.

584
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:46,113
Can you prove that you didn't offer to save my job... if I let you blow me ?

585
00:52:51,196 --> 00:52:54,632
Man... you are one twisted fuck.

586
00:52:56,034 --> 00:53:02,033
Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy... with nothing to lose.

587
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,216
- Carolyn. - Buddy.

588
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:20,723
-I am so sorry to have kept you waiting. -Oh. [ Chuckles ]

589
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:27,429
Christy left for New York this morning. Let's just say things were a little... hectic around the house.

590
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:29,299
- What's she doing in New York ? 

591
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:33,094
- She's moving there.Yes, we are splitting up.

592
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:35,767
Buddy. I'm so sorry.

593
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:37,733
Yes.

594
00:53:37,809 --> 00:53:41,602
According to her, I'm...too focused on my career.

595
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,749
- [ Scoffs ] - As if being driven to succeed is...

596
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:48,480
some sort of a character flaw. [ Chuckling ]

597
00:53:48,887 --> 00:53:55,115
Well, she certainly did take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her.

598
00:53:56,995 --> 00:53:58,019
- Ah, it's for the best. - Mm-hmm.

599
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:04,697
When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

600
00:54:05,236 --> 00:54:06,533
Well, call me crazy,

601
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:11,564
but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful,

602
00:54:12,444 --> 00:54:17,039
one must project an image of success... at all times.

603
00:54:36,634 --> 00:54:37,658
What are you doing ?

604
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:41,635
- I was filming this dead bird.

605
00:54:41,706 --> 00:54:42,695
- Why ?

606
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,539
Because it's beautiful.

607
00:54:48,113 --> 00:54:51,173
I think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental boy.

608
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:54,882
[ Ricky ] Hi,Jane.

609
00:54:56,121 --> 00:54:58,021
I want you to stop filming me.

610
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:01,485
Okay.

611
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:07,359
Well, whatever. This is boring. Let's go.

612
00:55:07,966 --> 00:55:09,024
- Do you need a ride ?

613
00:55:09,634 --> 00:55:10,794
- Are you crazy?

614
00:55:11,236 --> 00:55:14,171
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces in a Dumpster somewhere.

615
00:55:14,506 --> 00:55:15,632
It's okay. I'll walk.

616
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:17,742
But thanks.

617
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:20,139
He doesn't want to go anyway. Let's go.

618
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:22,703
- Come on,Jane.

619
00:55:23,815 --> 00:55:25,214
- I think I'm going to walk too.

620
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:27,416
What ?

621
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,015
Jane, that's, like, almost a mile.

622
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:50,006
[ Laughing, Grunting ] Oh, God! - [ Grunting ] - I love it ! Oh ! Oh !

623
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:51,531
- You like getting nailed by the King ?

624
00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:53,133
- Oh, yes, I love it !

625
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:55,105
- Fuck me, Your Majesty ! Aah ! - Ohh !

626
00:55:56,347 --> 00:55:57,814
- Who's the King ? - Oh ! You are !

627
00:55:57,882 --> 00:55:58,871
Who's the King 

628
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:20,772
American woman y y Stay away from me

629
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:25,971
American woman y y Mama, let me be

630
00:56:27,045 --> 00:56:29,445
Don't come knockin' around my door

631
00:56:29,514 --> 00:56:32,244
I don't wanna see your face no more

632
00:56:32,283 --> 00:56:34,649
I got better things to do

633
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:37,313
Than spend my life growin' old with you

634
00:56:37,388 --> 00:56:39,322
Now, woman

635
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,756
Said stay away

636
00:56:41,759 --> 00:56:44,091
[ Woman Over Speaker ] Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.

637
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:46,163
- What ?

638
00:56:46,498 --> 00:56:50,568
Would you like to try our new bacon and egg fajita for $1 .29 for a limited time only ?

639
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:53,503
Uh, no, but thank you.

640
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:57,537
I'd like the Big Barn Burger, Smiley Fries and an orange soda.

641
00:56:57,742 --> 00:56:59,767
Please drive up to the window. Thank you.

642
00:57:02,247 --> 00:57:04,613
Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's. That'll be 4.98, please.

643
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:08,081
Mama, let me be

644
00:57:08,186 --> 00:57:09,414
- Would you like some Smiley sauce ? - No, no--

645
00:57:09,487 --> 00:57:13,082
Actually, I'd like to fill out an application.

646
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:15,521
- There's no jobs for manager. It's just for counter.

647
00:57:16,027 --> 00:57:17,016
- Good.

648
00:57:17,228 --> 00:57:24,868
I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility.

649
00:57:24,868 --> 00:57:26,563
I don't think you'd fit in here.

650
00:57:27,437 --> 00:57:29,667
I have fast food experience.

651
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:32,165
[ Laughs ] Yeah, like 20 years ago.

652
00:57:32,776 --> 00:57:36,234
I'm sure there've been amazing technological advances in the industry,

653
00:57:36,312 --> 00:57:38,940
but surely you must have some sort of training program.

654
00:57:39,115 --> 00:57:41,640
It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn.

655
00:57:46,122 --> 00:57:48,716
- That was exactly what I needed-- - Mm.

656
00:57:52,362 --> 00:57:54,728
the ''royal treatment,'' so to speak.

657
00:57:57,734 --> 00:57:59,531
I was so stressed out. Ah !

658
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,678
Know what I do when I feel like that ?

659
00:58:09,746 --> 00:58:10,804
What ?

660
00:58:12,382 --> 00:58:14,475
- I fire a gun.

661
00:58:14,584 --> 00:58:18,188
- Really ?Oh, yeah. I go to this little firing range downtown,

662
00:58:18,188 --> 00:58:22,557
and I...just pop off a few rounds.

663
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:24,784
- I've never fired a gun before.

664
00:58:24,861 --> 00:58:29,564
- Well, you've gotta try it. Nothing makes you feel more powerful.

665
00:58:31,701 --> 00:58:36,232
Well... almost nothing.

666
00:58:40,543 --> 00:58:42,408
- So, do you like your new house ?

667
00:58:43,012 --> 00:58:44,001
- I like it.

668
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:50,446
The people who used to live there fed these stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts.

669
00:58:50,753 --> 00:58:52,778
And then she cut down their tree.

670
00:58:54,557 --> 00:58:56,115
Is that a funeral ?

671
00:58:56,693 --> 00:59:00,254
Yeah. Have you ever known anybody who died ?

672
00:59:01,131 --> 00:59:03,224
No. Have you ?

673
00:59:04,234 --> 00:59:05,292
No.

674
00:59:06,336 --> 00:59:09,134
But I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once...

675
00:59:09,205 --> 00:59:13,972
just laying there on the sidewalk. She looked really sad.

676
00:59:27,157 --> 00:59:29,352
I got that homeless woman on videotape.

677
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,787
Why would you film that ?

678
00:59:32,328 --> 00:59:33,886
- Because it was amazing.

679
00:59:34,297 --> 00:59:36,265
- What's amazing about it ?

680
00:59:36,466 --> 00:59:38,331
When you see something like that, 

681
00:59:38,568 --> 00:59:42,361
it's like God is looking right at you,just for a second,

682
00:59:42,505 --> 00:59:45,065
and if you're careful, you can look right back.

683
00:59:45,408 --> 00:59:46,670
And what do you see ?

684
00:59:48,344 --> 00:59:49,606
Beauty.

685
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:09,122
Mom, I want you to meet somebody.

686
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:14,300
- Mom.

687
01:00:14,804 --> 01:00:15,930
- Yes ?

688
01:00:18,274 --> 01:00:21,607
I want you to meet somebody. This is Jane.

689
01:00:22,378 --> 01:00:28,239
- Hi. - Oh, my. I apologize for the way things look around here.

690
01:00:38,394 --> 01:00:40,089
[ Ricky ] This is where my dad hides out.

691
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,864
[Jane ] I take it he's got a thing for guns.

692
01:00:45,101 --> 01:00:46,500
You gotta see this one thing.

693
01:00:49,205 --> 01:00:51,366
My dad would kill me if he knew I was in here.

694
01:00:52,508 --> 01:00:53,998
Did you steal his keys ?

695
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:57,240
No. One of my clients is a locksmith.

696
01:00:57,313 --> 01:00:59,873
He was short on cash one night, so I let him pay me in trade.

697
01:01:14,864 --> 01:01:15,853
Turn it over.

698
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:21,698
Oh, my God.

699
01:01:22,038 --> 01:01:24,529
It's, like, official state china of the Third Reich.

700
01:01:25,174 --> 01:01:28,473
There's a whole subculture of people who collect this Nazi shit.

701
01:01:29,712 --> 01:01:31,737
But my dad just has this one thing.

702
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:45,123
- What's wrong ?

703
01:01:46,262 --> 01:01:47,251
- Nothing.

704
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:50,399
No, you're scared of me.

705
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:52,490
No, I'm not.

706
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:56,396
You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed?

707
01:02:21,264 --> 01:02:26,434
It was one of those days... where it's a minute away from snowing,

708
01:02:28,805 --> 01:02:31,273
and there was this electricity in the air.

709
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,643
You can almost hear it.

710
01:02:36,746 --> 01:02:37,940
Right ?

711
01:02:42,618 --> 01:02:44,643
And this bag was just...

712
01:02:46,456 --> 01:02:49,118
dancing with me,

713
01:02:51,394 --> 01:02:53,885
like a little kid begging me to play with it,

714
01:02:56,332 --> 01:02:58,323
for 1 5 minutes.

715
01:03:02,305 --> 01:03:04,466
That's the day I realized that there was this...

716
01:03:06,609 --> 01:03:09,908
entire life behind things...

717
01:03:13,616 --> 01:03:17,347
and this incredibly benevolent force...

718
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,914
that wanted me to know that there was no reason to be afraid...

719
01:03:23,626 --> 01:03:24,615
ever.

720
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:30,326
Video's a poor excuse, I know,

721
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:34,996
but it helps me remember.

722
01:03:39,642 --> 01:03:41,337
I need to remember.

723
01:03:48,851 --> 01:03:51,081
Sometimes there's so much...

724
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:57,625
beauty... in the world.

725
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:00,789
I feel like I can't take it...

726
01:04:05,835 --> 01:04:06,995
and my heart...

727
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:13,538
is just going to... cave in.

728
01:05:00,089 --> 01:05:02,284
Oh, my God. What time is it ?

729
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,598
- Sorry I'm late.

730
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:13,225
- No, that's quite all right, dear.

731
01:05:14,237 --> 01:05:16,364
Your father and I were just discussing his day at work.

732
01:05:16,606 --> 01:05:18,471
Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey ?

733
01:05:18,674 --> 01:05:20,005
-Janie, today I quit my job. - [ Laughing ]

734
01:05:21,077 --> 01:05:25,104
Then I told my boss to go fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost $60,000.

735
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:29,317
- Pass the asparagus. - Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.

736
01:05:29,418 --> 01:05:31,966
And your mother seems to prefer that I go through life like a fucking prisoner

737
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:34,515
while she keeps my dick in a Mason jar under the sink.

738
01:05:34,624 --> 01:05:37,149
How dare you speak to me that way in front of her ?

739
01:05:37,226 --> 01:05:42,387
And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me... on the same day that you lose your job !

740
01:05:42,498 --> 01:05:45,399
I didn't lose it. It's not like, ''Whoops, where did my job go ?''

741
01:05:45,468 --> 01:05:46,662
I quit ! Pass the asparagus.

742
01:05:47,503 --> 01:05:49,835
Oh, oh, oh! And I want to thank you for putting me under the

743
01:05:49,835 --> 01:05:52,167
added pressure... of being the sole breadwinner now.

744
01:05:52,308 --> 01:05:53,138
- I already have a job. - No, no!

745
01:05:53,476 --> 01:05:55,808
Don't give a second thought as to who's going to pay the mortgage.

746
01:05:55,878 --> 01:05:59,473
We'll leave it up to Carolyn. ''You're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn ?''

747
01:05:59,549 --> 01:06:04,248
''Yes. I don't mind.'' "Everything ? You don't mind having the sole responsibility?

748
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,379
Your husband feels he can just quit his job, and you don't--''

749
01:06:06,656 --> 01:06:09,318
Will someone please pass me the fucking asparagus ?

750
01:06:09,392 --> 01:06:10,552
- I'm not going to be a part of this.

751
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:11,320
- Sit down !

752
01:06:11,394 --> 01:06:15,763
And I'm irresponsibly mad

753
01:06:15,831 --> 01:06:18,698
For you

754
01:06:18,768 --> 01:06:21,862
Go on and call me

755
01:06:21,938 --> 01:06:23,872
Unpredictable

756
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:28,001
Tell me that I'm impractical

757
01:06:28,077 --> 01:06:31,638
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue

758
01:06:32,014 --> 01:06:34,710
I am sick and tired of being treated like I don't exist.

759
01:06:35,217 --> 01:06:39,950
You two do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it, and I don't complain.

760
01:06:40,022 --> 01:06:42,684
- All I want-- - Oh, you don't complain ? Oh, please ! Excuse me !

761
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:45,625
I must be psychotic then ! If you don't complain, what is this ?

762
01:06:45,695 --> 01:06:49,961
Yeah, let's bring in the laugh meter and see how loud it gets on that one.

763
01:06:52,802 --> 01:06:56,795
Mad for you

764
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:02,878
Don't interrupt me, honey.

765
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:18,683
And another thing.

766
01:07:19,195 --> 01:07:21,925
From now on, we're going to alternate our dinner music,

767
01:07:21,998 --> 01:07:24,432
because, frankly-- and I don't think I'm alone here--

768
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,060
I am really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.

769
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,634
A bright, shiny world

770
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:37,945
- Go away. -[ Carolyn ] Please.

771
01:07:38,014 --> 01:07:41,241
Please let me in.

772
01:07:50,058 --> 01:07:54,962
Look, I wish that you hadn't witnessed that awful scene tonight, but in a way, I'm glad.

773
01:07:55,096 --> 01:07:57,690
Why ? So I could see what freaks you and Dad really are ?

774
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,689
Me ?

775
01:08:02,404 --> 01:08:07,868
Tsk. God. - Oh, Christ. Mom. -[ Sobbing ]

776
01:08:08,743 --> 01:08:11,211
No, I'm glad because, uh--

777
01:08:13,348 --> 01:08:17,444
because you're old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life:

778
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:22,914
You cannot count on anyone except yourself.

779
01:08:27,829 --> 01:08:30,263
You cannot count on anyone except yourself.

780
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,063
You know, it's sad but true,

781
01:08:35,337 --> 01:08:37,532
and the sooner you learn it, the better.

782
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,607
Look, Mom, I really don't feel like having a Kodak moment here.

783
01:08:41,643 --> 01:08:44,510
- [ Gasps ] - You ungrateful little brat !

784
01:08:45,514 --> 01:08:47,505
Just look at everything you have !

785
01:08:47,816 --> 01:08:50,376
When I was your age, I lived in a duplex !

786
01:08:50,452 --> 01:08:52,317
We didn't even have our own house.

787
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:57,874
- [ Door Slams Open ] - You little bastard ! Dad, no, I just--

788
01:10:58,013 --> 01:10:59,537
How did you get in there ?

789
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:01,773
How ? How ?

790
01:11:04,019 --> 01:11:05,008
Come on ! Get up ! Come on !

791
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:07,086
Get up !

792
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,282
Fight back, you little pussy!

793
01:11:10,358 --> 01:11:12,053
- No, sir, I won't fight you. - How ?

794
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,720
- How did you get in there ?

795
01:11:14,829 --> 01:11:16,057
- I picked the lock, sir.

796
01:11:16,464 --> 01:11:18,227
What were you looking for, huh ? Money ?

797
01:11:18,299 --> 01:11:19,823
 Are you on dope again ?

798
01:11:19,968 --> 01:11:22,801
No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend your Nazi plate.

799
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:25,428
A girlfriend ?

800
01:11:25,807 --> 01:11:27,672
Yes, sir. She lives next door. [ Panting ]

801
01:11:41,423 --> 01:11:42,583
Her name's Jane. [ Coughing ]

802
01:12:03,144 --> 01:12:05,135
This is for your own good, boy.

803
01:12:08,383 --> 01:12:13,377
You have no respect for other people's things and for authority--

804
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:14,945
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

805
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:19,026
Can't just go around doing whatever you feel like.

806
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:22,362
You can't. There are rules in life.

807
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:23,522
Yes, sir.

808
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,625
You need structure, yeah. You need--

809
01:12:29,537 --> 01:12:31,198
- [ Together] Discipline. 

810
01:12:31,272 --> 01:12:35,372
- Yes, sir. Thank you for trying to teach me.Don't give up on me, Dad.

811
01:12:40,448 --> 01:12:41,779
Oh, Ricky.

812
01:12:47,155 --> 01:12:49,749
You stay out of there.

813
01:13:37,238 --> 01:13:39,574
- Whoo ! - I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham,

814
01:13:39,574 --> 01:13:43,567
when you first came here, I thought you would be hopeless, but you're a natural.

815
01:13:43,745 --> 01:13:47,272
Well, all I know is I love shooting this gun.

816
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:52,415
Don't tell me not to fly I've simply got to

817
01:13:52,487 --> 01:13:55,684
If someone takes a spill it's me and not you

818
01:13:55,757 --> 01:14:01,423
Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade

819
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:09,029
I'm gonna march my band out ? ? I'll beat my drum

820
01:14:09,103 --> 01:14:15,042
And if I'm found out y y Your turn at bat, sir

821
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:20,274
Hey ? - y At least I didn't fake it y y Hat, sir, so what I didn't make it

822
01:14:20,715 --> 01:14:30,325
Nobody  I said nobody

823
01:14:30,325 --> 01:14:33,192
Nobody

824
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:36,898
Had better rain

825
01:14:36,898 --> 01:14:39,662
On my

826
01:14:39,734 --> 01:14:43,864
Parade

827
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,906


828
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:01,387
What ?

829
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:04,522
Uh, whose car is that out front ?

830
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,115
Mine. 

831
01:15:06,261 --> 01:15:07,888
1 97 0 Pontiac Firebird,

832
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,328
the car I've always wanted, and now I have it.

833
01:15:10,665 --> 01:15:11,689
- I rule !

834
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,262
- Uh-huh. Where's the Camry ?

835
01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:14,528
I traded it in.

836
01:15:15,536 --> 01:15:17,731
-Shouldn't you have consulted me first ?

837
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:19,497
-Hm, let me think.

838
01:15:20,074 --> 01:15:22,167
No. You never drove it.

839
01:15:24,178 --> 01:15:25,372
Have you done something different ?

840
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,012
You look great.

841
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:33,276
Where's Jane ?

842
01:15:34,689 --> 01:15:35,917
Jane not home.

843
01:15:43,031 --> 01:15:44,259
We have...

844
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:53,098
the whole house... to ourselves.

845
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:57,106
Christ, Carolyn.

846
01:15:58,413 --> 01:16:00,040
When did you become so...

847
01:16:02,283 --> 01:16:03,511
joyless ?

848
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,819
Joyless ?

849
01:16:08,122 --> 01:16:09,919
I am not joyless.

850
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:17,297
There happens to be a lot about me... that you don't know, Mr. Smarty Man.

851
01:16:17,432 --> 01:16:20,401
There's plenty of joy in my life.

852
01:16:23,271 --> 01:16:25,398
Whatever happened to that girl...

853
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:33,238
who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored ?

854
01:16:34,615 --> 01:16:38,574
Who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building...

855
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:42,223
to flash the traffic helicopters ?

856
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:46,922
- [ Chuckles ] - Have you totally forgotten about her ?

857
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:48,923
Because I haven't.

858
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:04,403
Lester, you're going to spill beer on the couch.

859
01:17:12,954 --> 01:17:14,546
So what ? It's just a couch.

860
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:21,623
This is a $4,000 sofa, upholstered in Italian silk.

861
01:17:21,696 --> 01:17:23,323
This is not just a couch.

862
01:17:23,865 --> 01:17:26,959
It's just... a... couch !

863
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:29,229
This isn't life !

864
01:17:30,004 --> 01:17:31,494
This is just stuff,

865
01:17:32,073 --> 01:17:36,637
and it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts.

866
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:47,379
I'm only trying to help you !

867
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:55,186
[ Sighs ] Don't.

868
01:17:56,364 --> 01:17:57,490
[ Ricky ] Why?

869
01:18:01,069 --> 01:18:06,072
It's weird watching myself. I don't like how I look.

870
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:11,301
I can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are.

871
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:14,748
Look. I'm not going to sit here for that shit.

872
01:18:24,058 --> 01:18:27,050
Ha ! How does it feel now ?

873
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:28,825
Fine.

874
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,963
You don't feel naked ?

875
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,931
I am naked.

876
01:18:34,902 --> 01:18:36,267
You know what I mean.

877
01:18:46,247 --> 01:18:48,442
So tell me about being in the hospital.

878
01:18:52,453 --> 01:18:55,945
When I was 1 5, my dad caught me smoking dope.

879
01:18:56,424 --> 01:18:59,689
He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school.

880
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:04,855
I told you this whole thing about structure and discipline, right ?

881
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:08,460
Of course, I got kicked out.

882
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:11,399
Dad and I had this huge fight.

883
01:19:12,473 --> 01:19:13,599
He hit me.

884
01:19:14,942 --> 01:19:18,708
And the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut,

885
01:19:20,615 --> 01:19:22,173
and I just snapped.

886
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,853
I wanted to kill him.

887
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:32,657
I would've... killed him...

888
01:19:34,328 --> 01:19:36,353
if they hadn't pulled me off.

889
01:19:39,934 --> 01:19:43,597
That's when my dad put me in the hospital.

890
01:19:44,105 --> 01:19:46,801
They drugged me up and left me in there for two years.

891
01:19:51,746 --> 01:19:53,680
- You must really hate him. -[ Lighter Clicking ]

892
01:19:57,585 --> 01:19:59,143
He's not a bad man.

893
01:20:00,188 --> 01:20:03,715
Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my dad if he did something like that to me.

894
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:10,597
Wait. I already do hate my dad.

895
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:11,461
Why ?

896
01:20:14,735 --> 01:20:16,202
He's a total asshole:

897
01:20:16,503 --> 01:20:20,535
he's got this crush on my friend Angela, and it's disgusting.

898
01:20:20,874 --> 01:20:22,842
- You'd rather he had the crush on you. - [ Chuckles ]

899
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:26,006
- Gross. No. -[ Chuckling ]

900
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:33,508
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is.

901
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:41,220
I know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong.

902
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:45,530
He's doing massive psychological damage to me.

903
01:20:45,832 --> 01:20:48,027
How ?

904
01:20:48,535 --> 01:20:51,470
Well, now I, too, need structure,

905
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,031
a little fucking discipline.

906
01:21:05,519 --> 01:21:06,884
I'm serious, though.

907
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:10,312
How could he not be damaging me ?

908
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,424
I need a father who's a role model,

909
01:21:16,129 --> 01:21:23,465
not some horny geek boy who's going to spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.

910
01:21:23,603 --> 01:21:25,195
What a lame-o.

911
01:21:28,275 --> 01:21:31,403
Someone really should just... put him out of his misery.

912
01:21:35,081 --> 01:21:36,810
Want me to kill him for you ?

913
01:21:46,326 --> 01:21:48,351
Yeah. Would you ?

914
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:51,921
It'll cost you.

915
01:21:52,265 --> 01:21:54,859
I've been baby-sitting since I was about ten.

916
01:21:54,968 --> 01:21:57,766
I've got almost $3,000.

917
01:22:00,807 --> 01:22:02,866
Of course I was saving it up for a boob job.

918
01:22:04,544 --> 01:22:05,408
But--

919
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,754
You know, that's not a very nice thing to do--

920
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:27,696
hiring someone to kill your dad.

921
01:22:31,271 --> 01:22:34,172
Well, I guess I'm not a very nice girl then, am I ?

922
01:22:58,465 --> 01:23:00,365
You know I'm not serious, right ?

923
01:23:01,902 --> 01:23:03,130
Of course.

924
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:21,345
You know how lucky we are to have found each other ?

925
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,123
[ Lester Narrating ] Remember those posters that said...

926
01:23:29,396 --> 01:23:32,797
"Today is the first day of the rest of your life" ?

927
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:38,429
Well, that's true with every day except one--

928
01:23:38,672 --> 01:23:39,969
the day you die.

929
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:43,640
I've looked under chairs

930
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:46,110
I've looked under tables

931
01:23:46,179 --> 01:23:50,775
I've tried to find the key to 50 million fables

932
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:53,045
They call me the Seeker

933
01:23:55,288 --> 01:23:59,816
I've been searching low and high

934
01:24:02,362 --> 01:24:05,923
I won't get to get what I'm after

935
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:07,990
Till the day I die 

936
01:24:08,068 --> 01:24:10,093


937
01:24:14,107 --> 01:24:18,669
I asked Bobby Dylan I asked the Beatles

938
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,447
Jane, hurry up.

939
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,679
I've got a very important appointment.

940
01:24:24,451 --> 01:24:26,385
- Is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight ?

941
01:24:26,786 --> 01:24:29,220
- She's always welcome.

942
01:24:29,289 --> 01:24:32,520
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't seen her around here in a while.

943
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:41,295
What ?

944
01:24:42,235 --> 01:24:44,726
I've been too embarrassed to bring her over,

945
01:24:45,939 --> 01:24:48,169
because of you and that way that you behave.

946
01:24:48,675 --> 01:24:51,143
- What are you talking about ? I've barely even spoken to her. - Dad!

947
01:24:51,745 --> 01:24:55,078
You stare at her all the time like you're drunk !

948
01:24:55,682 --> 01:25:02,148
- It's disgusting! - You better watch yourself, or you're going to turn into a real bitch just like your mother !

949
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:05,947
[ Whispers ] Oh, fuck.

950
01:25:14,267 --> 01:25:15,529
You ready to go ?

951
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:21,506
Oh, I-I don't need a ride. I'm going with Jane and her mom.

952
01:25:28,481 --> 01:25:30,415
[ Carolyn ] Oh, morning !

953
01:25:30,483 --> 01:25:32,552
[ Lester ] Yo, Ricky!

954
01:25:32,552 --> 01:25:37,648
- How's it going ? - Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham. [ Whispers ] Hey. Wait.

955
01:26:56,269 --> 01:26:59,170
[ Man ] I need that Super Smiley with cheese ASAP!

956
01:26:59,239 --> 01:27:01,799
- You need more than that, my little hombre. - May I take your order?

957
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:04,374
-[ Carolyn Over Speaker ] Oh,yeah! What's good here ? -[ Buddy ] Nothing.

958
01:27:04,577 --> 01:27:05,566
Oh, well, 

959
01:27:05,645 --> 01:27:08,170
then I guess we'll just have to be bad, won't we ?

960
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,851
[ Laughs ] I'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,

961
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:14,154
- curly fries and a vanilla shake. -[ Buddy ] Make that two.

962
01:27:14,154 --> 01:27:17,180
[ Woman ] That'll be 7.98. Please drive up to the window. Thank you.

963
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:22,554
I think we deserve a little junk food after the workout we had this morning.

964
01:27:24,464 --> 01:27:25,123
- Did you know that ?

965
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:27,393
- Thank you. I'm flattered.

966
01:27:28,401 --> 01:27:30,665
Smile ! You're at Mr. Smiley's !

967
01:27:33,306 --> 01:27:38,266
Would you like to try our new beef and cheese pot pie on a stick ? Just $1 .99 for a limited time only.

968
01:27:38,645 --> 01:27:40,545
- We were just at a seminar.

969
01:27:40,847 --> 01:27:42,109
Buddy, this is my--

970
01:27:42,182 --> 01:27:43,274
- Her husband.

971
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:45,012
We've met before,

972
01:27:45,185 --> 01:27:48,211
but something tells me...you're going to remember me this time.

973
01:27:51,157 --> 01:27:53,489
You are so busted.

974
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:55,594
This really doesn't concern you.

975
01:27:55,695 --> 01:28:00,132
Well, actually, Janine is senior drive-thru manager, so you are on her turf.

976
01:28:02,702 --> 01:28:07,230
- [ Sighs ] - So, this makes sense.

977
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:08,766
- Oh, Lester-- - Honey, it's okay.

978
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:13,643
I want you to be happy. Would you like Smiley Sauce with that ?

979
01:28:13,713 --> 01:28:14,907
- Lester,just stop it !

980
01:28:14,981 --> 01:28:16,039
- No, no.

981
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:20,920
You...don't get to tell me what to do...

982
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,548
ever again.

983
01:28:37,237 --> 01:28:38,864
- I'm sorry. 

984
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,070
I guess we should cool it for a while.

985
01:28:45,845 --> 01:28:48,746
I'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce.

986
01:28:48,982 --> 01:28:54,384
No, no, I understand completely. It's--

987
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:58,990
''In order to be successful, one must project an image of success at all times.''

988
01:29:25,918 --> 01:29:27,977
Stop it. Stop it.

989
01:29:42,769 --> 01:29:44,862
Oh, oh, whoa

990
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:55,379
There she stood in the street 

991
01:29:55,448 --> 01:29:58,417
Smiling from her head to her feet 

992
01:29:58,484 --> 01:30:01,783
I said Hey, what is this 

993
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:03,981
Now, baby, maybe

994
01:30:04,057 --> 01:30:06,890
Maybe she's in need of a kiss

995
01:30:06,959 --> 01:30:10,258
I said, Hey, what's your name- Shit.

996
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:19,103
I have to run next door.

997
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:22,603
Jane left her geometry book in my bag, and she needs it to do her homework.

998
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:36,647
So you and psycho boy are fucking on, like, a regular basis now, right ?

999
01:30:37,357 --> 01:30:38,016
No.

1000
01:30:38,691 --> 01:30:40,556
Come on. You can tell me.

1001
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,188
Does he have a big dick ?

1002
01:30:42,328 --> 01:30:45,889
I'm not going to talk about his dick with you, okay ? It's not like that.

1003
01:30:46,766 --> 01:30:49,200
Not like what ? Doesn't he have one ?

1004
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:52,062
Why don't you want to talk about it ?

1005
01:30:52,138 --> 01:30:54,868
- I tell you every detail about every guy that I fuck. - Yeah.

1006
01:30:55,308 --> 01:30:57,868
Maybe you shouldn't, all right ?

1007
01:30:58,077 --> 01:31:00,068
Maybe I really don't want to hear about all that.

1008
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:04,007
So now that you have a boyfriend, you're, like, above it ?

1009
01:31:05,151 --> 01:31:06,880
We got to get you a real man.

1010
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:29,939
- You got any papers ?

1011
01:31:30,009 --> 01:31:31,977
- Yeah, in the cigar box right over there.

1012
01:31:32,345 --> 01:31:34,905
Put up a fight, dude. You are such a pushover. 

1013
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:36,846
'' No, I can't, really. Okay.''

1014
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:38,247
You should learn to roll a joint.

1015

-[Jane ] Where's Mom ?

1016

- Don't know.

01:32:48,254 --> 01:32:49,414
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.

1018
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:51,053
- Hi.

1019
01:32:51,657 --> 01:32:53,090
Wow, look at you.

1020
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:55,421
Have you been working out ?

1021
01:32:55,895 --> 01:32:56,691
- Some. - [ Sighs ]

1022
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:03,332
You can really tell.

1023
01:33:06,806 --> 01:33:08,603
Look at those arms.

1024
01:33:12,945 --> 01:33:15,106
You like... muscles ?

1025
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:20,652
[ Laughs ] I should probably go see whatJane's up to.

1026
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:34,225
Where did you get that ?

1027
01:33:37,169 --> 01:33:38,227
- From my job.

1028
01:33:38,771 --> 01:33:40,033
- Don't lie to me.

1029
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:44,308
Now, I saw you with him.

1030
01:33:46,178 --> 01:33:47,543
You were watching me ?

1031
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,512
What does he make you do ?

1032
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:56,855
Dad, you don't really think me and Mr. Burnham--

1033
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:58,720
Don't you laugh at me !

1034
01:34:00,493 --> 01:34:04,953
I will not sit back and watch my only son become a cocksucker !

1035
01:34:05,031 --> 01:34:10,204
Jesus, what is it with you ?

1036
01:34:10,204 --> 01:34:15,336
I swear to God... I'll throw you out of this house and never look at you again !

1037
01:34:15,976 --> 01:34:16,874
- You mean that.

I'd rather you were dead than be a fuckin' faggot !

1040
01:34:34,728 --> 01:34:35,854
You're right.

1041
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,358
- I suck dick for money.

1042
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:43,125
- Boy, don't start.

1043
01:34:43,871 --> 01:34:45,805
- Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.

1044
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:46,871
- Get out !

1045
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:51,673
You should see me fuck. I'm the best piece of ass in three states.

1046
01:34:51,845 --> 01:34:55,508
Damn it, get out ! I don't ever want to see you again.

What a sad... old man you are.

1048
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,495
Get out.

Mom...

I'm leaving.

1051
01:35:39,159 --> 01:35:40,319
Okay.

1052
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:44,988
Wear a raincoat.

1053
01:35:52,339 --> 01:35:54,534
I wish things would have been better for you.

1054
01:35:59,446 --> 01:36:00,708
Take care of Dad.

1055
01:36:33,313 --> 01:36:35,508
[ Man On Audiotape ] ...disinvesting problems of power...

1056
01:36:35,682 --> 01:36:38,583
and removing their ability to make us afraid.

1057

This is the secret to "Me-Centered Living. "

for your actions and their solutions... will you ever break free from the constant cycle of victimhood.

1060
01:36:51,398 --> 01:36:55,732
You are only a victim if you choose to be a victim. We all have the power--

1061
01:36:57,404 --> 01:36:59,304
[Jane ] I don't think we can be friends anymore!

[ Angela ] You're too uptight about sex.

Just don't fuck my dad, all right ?

1064
01:37:04,978 --> 01:37:06,070
- Please ?

1065

-[ Knock At Door ] - [ Sighs ] Dad, leave us alone !

Yes.

You guys can't be serious.

I have over $40,000.

I know people in the city that can help us get set up.

- Why do you even care ?

1083

- Because you're my friend.

- Go fuck yourself, psycho !

- Well, then so am I !

We'll always be freaks, and we'll never be like other people !

Yeah, well, at least I'm not ugly.

Yes, you are.

I'm great.

1216
01:51:29,375 --> 01:51:30,967

[ Lester Narrating ] I had always heard your entire life flashes...

1220
01:53:03,903 --> 01:53:05,962
in front of your eyes the second before you die.

1221
01:53:07,506 --> 01:53:08,495
First of all, 

1222
01:53:08,975 --> 01:53:12,940
that one second...isn't a second at all.

1223
01:53:13,012 --> 01:53:18,014
It stretches on forever, like an ocean of time.

1224
01:53:20,052 --> 01:53:23,055
For me, it was lying on my back...

1225
01:53:23,055 --> 01:53:26,923
at Boy Scout camp, watching falling stars.

1226
01:53:35,201 --> 01:53:41,072
And yellow leaves from the maple trees... that lined our street.

1227
01:53:49,882 --> 01:53:55,551
Or my grandmother's hands and the way her skin... seemed like paper.

1228
01:54:02,762 --> 01:54:06,323
And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's...

1229
01:54:06,632 --> 01:54:09,499
brand-new Firebird.

1230

AndJanie.

1231
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:25,942
AndJanie.

1232
01:54:58,684 --> 01:55:00,709
And... Carolyn.

1233
01:55:06,092 --> 01:55:09,459
I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me,

1234
01:55:09,929 --> 01:55:14,263
but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world.

1235
01:55:15,468 --> 01:55:20,132
Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once and it's too much.

1236
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:24,298
My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst.

1237
01:55:26,045 --> 01:55:29,173
And then I remember to relax...

1238
01:55:30,149 --> 01:55:32,674
and stop trying to hold on to it.

1239
01:55:33,152 --> 01:55:36,349
And then it flows through me like rain,

1240
01:55:37,056 --> 01:55:40,355
and I can't feel anything but gratitude...

1241
01:55:40,626 --> 01:55:46,898
for every single moment... of my stupid little life.

1242
01:55:46,966 --> 01:55:49,901
You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure.

1243
01:55:51,137 --> 01:55:52,229
But don't worry.

1244
01:55:53,606 --> 01:55:55,073
You will someday.

1245
01:56:01,614 --> 01:56:05,209
Ahhh, ahh

1246
01:56:06,152 --> 01:56:10,924
Because the world is round

1247
01:56:10,924 --> 01:56:17,124
It turns me on

1248
01:56:18,398 --> 01:56:21,333
Because

1249
01:56:21,401 --> 01:56:24,097
The world

1250
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:29,039
Is round

1251
01:56:30,910 --> 01:56:33,936
Ahhh

1252
01:56:34,013 --> 01:56:36,106
Ahh

1253
01:56:36,182 --> 01:56:40,881
Because the wind is high

1254
01:56:40,954 --> 01:56:46,790
It blows my mind

1255
01:56:48,461 --> 01:56:51,294
Because

1256
01:56:51,364 --> 01:56:53,889
The wind

1257
01:56:53,967 --> 01:56:58,734
Is high

1258
01:57:00,707 --> 01:57:04,473
Ahhh, ahh

1259
01:57:04,544 --> 01:57:10,450
Love is old, Love is new

1260
01:57:10,450 --> 01:57:16,353
Love is all, Love is you

1261
01:57:17,991 --> 01:57:22,655
Because the sky is blue

1262

01:57:35,775 --> 01:57:40,474
Is blue
