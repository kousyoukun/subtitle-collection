1
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,820
我要一个模范父亲
l need a father who's a role model.

2
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,450
不是一个看到漂亮美眉 就流口水的色鬼老爸
Not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever l bring a girlfriend home from school.

3
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,270
他逊毙了
What a lame-o.

4
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,940
应该有人来结束他可悲的生命
Someone really should just put him out of his misery.

5
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,470
要我干掉他吗？
Want me to kill him for you?

6
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,210
好，你肯吗？
Yeah. Would you?

7
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,160

8
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,740
我叫赖斯特班宁
My name is Lester Burnham.

9
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,970
这是我的家乡
This is my neighborhood.

10
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,140
这是我的街道
This is my street.

11
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,180
这是我的一生
This is my life.

12
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,550
我今年42岁 一年之内我就会死
l'm 42 years old. ln less than a year...l'll be dead.

13
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,920
当然，现在我还不知道
Of course, l don't know that yet.

14
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,960
不过老实说，我的心早就死了
And in a way, l'm dead already.

15
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,710
看看我
Look at me.

16
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,120
躲在浴室打手枪
Jerking off in the shower.

17
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,750
这是我每天唯一的高潮 之后就每况愈下
This will be the high point of my day. lt's all downhill from here.

18
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,930
我老婆，卡洛琳
That's my wife, Carolyn.

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,870
你看她的剪刀跟鞋子 颜色搭配得多好
See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs?

20
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,030
这不是巧合
That's not an accident.

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,040
小不点，别乱叫
Hush, Bitsy!

22
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,100
你是怎么了？
Hush! What is wrong with you?

23
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,170
我们的邻居，吉姆
That's our next door neighbor, Jim.

24
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,840
他的爱人
And that's his lover... Jim.

25
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,450
也叫吉姆
You spoil her. Bitsy...

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,920
你把它宠坏了 别乱叫，进来
- Me? - ...no bark! Come inside now!

27
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,950
早安，吉姆
- Come on. - Good morning, Jim!

28
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,180
早，卡洛琳
Morning, Carolyn.

29
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,490
你的领带好帅，颜色很棒
l love your tie. That color!

30
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,870
你的玫瑰好漂亮 怎么会开得这么好？
l just love your roses. How do you get them to flourish like this?

31
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,800
我跟你说 蛋壳和肥料双管齐下
Well, l'll tell you: eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,810
我没听过这一招
- l've never heard of that. - Man...

33
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,470
我看到她就累
...l get exhausted just watching her.

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,610
她以前不是这样 她曾经快乐过
She wasn't always like this. She used to be happy.

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,640
我们曾经快乐过
We used to be happy.

36
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,860
我女儿，小珍
My daughter, Jane. 

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,650
我们的独女
Only child.

38
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,130
“隆乳”

39
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,330
小珍是典型的新新人类
Janie's a pretty typical teenager:

40
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,090
愤世嫉俗、厢迕曰
angry, insecure, confused.

41
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,340
我很想告诉她明天会更好
l wish l could tell her that's all going to pass

42
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,700
可是我不想说谎
but l don't want to lie to her.

43
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,210
小珍，你想扮成丑小鸭吗？
Jane, honey, are you trying to look unattractive?

44
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,650
对
Yes.

45
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,320
恭喜哦，你扮得很像
Congratulations, you've succeeded admirably.

46
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,020
老公，你能再慢一点吗？ 因为我可以迟到久一点喔
Lester, could you make me a little later? l'm not quite late enough.

47
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,160
老爸，你真行
Nice going, Dad.

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,960
我的妻女都觉得我很失败
Both my wife and daughter think l'm this gigantic loser.

49
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,930
她们没错
And they're right.

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,760
我失去了什么
l have lost something.

51
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,640
我不知道是什么
l'm not exactly sure what it is,

52
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,210
过去我从未感到这么…
but l know l didn't always feel this... 

53
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,810
死气沉沉
sedated.

54
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,240
不过你知道吗？
But you know what?

55
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,350
想要重振雄风永远不嫌晚
lt's never too late to get it back.

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,060
这是“媒体月刊”的赖斯特 请找谭先生
Hello. This is Lester Burnham from Media Monthly magazine. l'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please.

57
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,760
截稿日期已经到了
Well, we're all under a deadline here.

58
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,100
贵公司的新产品还缺一些资料
There's some information about your product launch that isn't even covered in your press release and...

59
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,270
对…我想问一下
Yeah, OK. Can l ask you a question?

60
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,670
到底有没有谭先生这个人？
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?

61
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,510
因为他从来不上班
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.

62
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,740
好吧，我留下电话号码
Yeah, OK. l'll leave my number.

63
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,250
555-0199
lt's 555-01 99.

64
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,380
赖斯特班宁
Lester Burnham. 

65
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,610
谢谢
Thank you.

66
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,530
赖斯
Hey, Les.

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,460
借用你一分钟
You got a minute?

68
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,390
为了你，布莱德 五分钟都行
For you, Brad, l got five.

69
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,730
你知道公司必须裁减支出
So l'm sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here.

70
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,800
当然了
Sure. 

71
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,770
景气不好，你得另找财路
Times are tight. You got to free up some cash.

72
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,070
想赚钱就得先花钱
You got to spend money to make money, right?

73
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,470
没错
- Exactly. 

74
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,680
就像主编刷公司的信用卡召妓
- Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker,

75
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,650
结果被她盗用花了一大笔钱
then she used the card and stayed at the St. Regis for three months...

76
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,810
那只是个谣言 那是五万元
- That's unsubstantiated gossip! - That's $50,000!

77
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,050
他乱花公司的钱 现在却要炒员工鱿鱼
That's someone's salary who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!

78
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,360
老天，冷静点
Jesus! Calm down.

79
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,760
还没有人被炒鱿鱼
Nobody's getting fired yet.

80
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,940
我只是请大家写份报告 谈谈你们对公司有何贡献
That's why we're having everyone write out a job description mapping out in detail how they contribute.

81
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,980
这样上头才知道谁可以用 谁可以云谈亲呗
That way management can assess who's valuable... And who's expendable.

82
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,210
我只是公事公办
lt's just business.

83
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,480
我在公司待了十四年 你才来了一个月
l've been writing for this magazine for 14 years. You've been here a month?

84
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,650
我可是好人耶
l'm one of the good guys, Les.

85
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,260
我在替你着想
l'm trying to level with you.

86
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,300
这是你保住饭碗的机会
This is your one chance to save your job.

87
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,660
别想了，快写吧
There's no decision. Just write the damn thing.

88
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,500
你不觉得这很独裁吗？
You don't think it's weird and kind of fascist?

89
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,100
也许吧，不过你不能失业
Possibly, but you don't want to be unemployed.

90
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,740
所以我就得跟魔鬼交易吗？
Let's sell our souls and work for Satan because it's more convenient.

91
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,370
你也未免太夸张了一点
Could you be a little bit more dramatic, please?

92
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,080
终于来了新邻居
So we finally got new neighbors.

93
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,410
要是罗家把房子交给我处理 就不会等了半年才脱手
lf the Lomans had let me represent them instead of the Real Estate King that house would never have sat on the market for six months.

94
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,120
谁叫你砍掉他们的树
They were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore.

95
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,990
他们的树？
Their sycamore? Come on!

96
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,790
拜，树根有一大半长在我们家
A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property.

97
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,800
怎么会是他们的树？
How can you call it their sycamore?

98
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,810
是我的树我才会把它砍掉
l wouldn't have the heart to cut down something if it wasn't partially mine.

99
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,750
我们一定要听这种电梯音乐吗？
Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music?

100
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,750
不一定
No. No, we don't.

101
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,960
只要你煮一顿美味可口的晚餐 你想听什么都行
As soon as you've prepared a nutritious, yet savory, meal that l'm about to eat you can listen to whatever you like.

102
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,970
小珍，学校好吗？
So, Janie, how was school?

103
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,670
还好
lt was OK.

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,870
只是还好？
Just OK?

105
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,540
不是，学校棒呆了
No, Dad. lt was spectacular.

106
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,350
你想知道我的工作怎样吗？
Well, you want to know how things went at myjob today?

107
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,490
公司请来一个效率专家
They've hired this efficiency expert.

108
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,620
名字叫布莱德，有够呛
This really friendly guy named Brad. How perfect is that?

109
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,720
他其实是负责开除员工的
He's there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody

110
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,760
只是他们不敢明讲 他们太阴险了
because they couldn't just come right out and say that. That would just be too honest.

111
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,200
所以我们就得… 你根本就不在乎，是吗？
So they've asked us. You couldn't possibly care less, could you?

112
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,370
你想怎样？
Well, what do you expect?

113
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,170
不可能只因为你今天过得很糟 我们的感情就突然变好
You can't all of a sudden be my best friend just because you had a bad day.

114
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,280
拜，你好久没跟我聊天了
l mean, hello! You've barely even spoken to me for months.

115
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,450
难道你是模范母亲吗？ 你把她当成员工
What? You're Mother of the Year? You treat her like an employee.

116
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,190
什么？
What?

117
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,720
你说什么？
What?!

118
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,630
我要去吃冰淇淋
l'm going to get some ice cream.

119
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,310
小珍，很抱歉
Janie... l'm sorry

120
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,880
我没有…多陪陪你
l haven't been more... available. l'm just... l...

121
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,100
你不必等我来找你呀
You know, you don't always have to wait for me to come to you.

122
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,130
棒呆了，原来是我的错
Great. So now it's my fault?

123
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,830
这不是谁的错
l didn't say that. lt's nobody's fault.

124
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,340
到底是怎么回事？
Janie, what happened? We used to be pals.

125
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,070
从前我们无话不谈

126
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,080
“房屋仲介卡洛琳班宁”

127
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,550
“今天开放参观”

128
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,230
“仲介王巴迪坎恩”

129
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,810
今天我会卖掉这栋房子
l will sell this house today.

130
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,390
我会卖掉这栋房子…
l will sell this house today.

131
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,140
今天我会卖掉这栋房子
l will sell this house today.

132
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,110
欢迎光临，我是卡洛琳班宁
Welcome. l'm Carolyn Burnham.

133
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,950
这间客厅很气派
This living room is very dramatic.

134
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,320
壁炉是用上好石材砌成的
Wait till you see the native stone fireplace!

135
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,700
粉刷一下保证焕然一新 装个天窗更棒
A simple cream could really lighten things up. You could even put in a skylight.

136
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,640
我们去看看厨房
Well, why don't we go into the kitchen?

137
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,440
简直就是美食家乐园
lt's a dream come true for any cook.

138
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,570
每个人都能当食神
Just filled with positive energy.

139
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,540
电吊扇可以省下一大笔电费
You'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can cut down on your energy costs.

140
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,990
后院可以举行很棒的烤肉大会
You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here.

141
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,960
广告说泳池很像蓝色珊瑚礁 这一点也不像
The ad said this pool was "lagoon-like." - Nothing "lagoon-like" about it.

142
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,860
只有一大堆蚊子 连花草都没有
- Except for maybe the bugs! There aren't even any plants out here!

143
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,930
这些呢？这不是花草吗？
What do you call this? ls this not this a plant?

144
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,460
你们要花草我就找园丁来 一次搞定
lf you have a problem with the plants, l can call my landscape architect.

145
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,110
珊瑚礁应该有热带风味
- Solved! - l think lagoon, l think waterfall.

146
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,080
这只是个水泥坑
l think tropical. This is a cement hole.

147
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,720
车库e有火把
l have some tiki torches in the garage.

148
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,450
别哭了！别哭，爱哭鬼
Shut up! Stop it! You weak. You baby! Shut up!

149
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,010
别哭了！别哭…
Shut up! Shut up!

150
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,640
你在找谁？
Who are you looking for?

151
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,900
我爸妈说要来
My parents are coming tonight.

152
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,370
他们想要开始多关心我
They're trying to, you know, take an active interest in me.

153
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,040
f心，我最恨我老妈这样
Gross. l hate it when my mom does that.

154
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,490
真是无聊透顶 他们关心自己就好了
They're such assholes. Why can't theyjust have their own lives?

155
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,590
她有说要我们去看她吗？
What makes you so sure she wants us to be there? Did she ask?

156
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,160
没有，不过这对她很重要
Of course not. She doesn't want us to know how important this is to her.

157
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,290
她练习了好几个礼拜
But she's been practicing her steps for weeks.

158
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,130
她一定会恨我们
l'll bet money she'll resent it.

159
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,730
我也错过第四台播的007
And l'm missing the James Bond marathon on TNT.

160
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,790
老公，这很重要耶
Lester! This is important!

161
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,900
我觉得你跟小珍渐渐疏远了
l'm sensing a real distance growing between you and Jane.

162
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,570
疏远？她讨厌我
Growing? She hates me.

163
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,470
她只是个性倔强
She's just willful.

164
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,070
她也讨厌你
She hates you, too.

165
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,033
借光，借光
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

166
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,994
不好意思，对不起
Pardon me. Excuse me.

167
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,400
今晚半场的精采表演 声名远播的洛威高中啦啦队
Now, for your halftime entertainment, Rockwell High's award-winning Dancing Spartanettes!

168
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,170
看完了就能走吧？
We can leave right after this, right?

169
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,470
雪特！他们没走
Shit! They're still here.

170
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,910
我很喜欢你的表演
- Janie! - Hey, l really enjoyed that!

171
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,140
恭喜，你很棒
Congratulations! You were great! 

172
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,150
我又没赢什么
l didn't win anything.

173
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,980
我是小珍的爸爸赖斯特
Hi, l'm Lester, Janie's dad.

174
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,920
哦，你好
Oh, hi.

175
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,150
我的死党安琪拉海瑟
This is my friend, Angela Hayes.

176
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,520
很好，幸会了
OK. Good to meet you.

177
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,650
你的表演也很棒，非常…
You were also good tonight. Very...

178
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,000
准确无误
- ...precise. 

179
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,160
谢了
- Thanks.

180
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,900
幸会了，安琪拉！小珍
Nice to meet you, Angela. Honey!

181
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,310
我以你为荣，我有仔细看 你没有跳错
l am so proud of you! You know, l watched you very closely. You didn't screw up once!

182
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,470
我们得走了
OK. We have to go.

183
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,110
你们要去哪儿？
- So what are you girls doing now? 

184
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,550
爸
- Dad!

185
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,280
我们要去吃披萨
We're going out for pizza.

186
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,210
我有车，要我载一程吗？
Really? We can give you a ride.  l have a car. Want to come with us?

187
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,590
谢了，我也有车
Thanks, but l have a car.

188
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,220
你有车，太好了
You have a car. Well, that's great. That's great.

189
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,530
最近小珍也想买车 对吧，小珍？
'Cause Janie's thinking about getting a car soon, aren't you?

190
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,860
妈在等你
Dad! Mom's waiting for you.

191
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,560
很高兴认识你
lt was very nice meeting you, Angela.

192
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,870
只要是小珍的朋友
Any friend of Janie's is...

193
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,400
就是我的朋友
...a friend of mine.

194
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,780
回头见
Well...l'll be seeing you around, then.

195
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,220
他实在是有够逊了
Could he be any more... pathetic?

196
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,290
他很可爱呀
l think he's sweet.

197
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,800
他跟你妈一定很久没搞过了
And l think he and your mother have not had sex in a long time.

198
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,020
很奇怪
lt's the weirdest thing.

199
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,590
我好像昏睡了二十年
l feel like l've been in a coma for about 20 years

200
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,090
现在终于d醒
and l'm just now waking up.

201
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,490
棒呆了
Spectacular.

202
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,910
抱歉我老爸刚才那么猪哥
l'm so sorry my dad was weird tonight.

203
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,980
没关S
That's OK.

204
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,070
男人都会对我流口水
l'm used to guys drooling over me.

205
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,780
我十二岁起就这样
lt started when l was about 12.

206
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,920
我跟爸妈上馆子
l'd go to dinner with my parents.

207
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,780
星期四都到红龙虾餐馆
Every Thursday night, Red Lobster.

208
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:39,050
每个男人都盯着我看 他们只有一个念头
And every guy there would stare at me when l walked in. And l knew what they were thinking.

209
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,290
就像男同学打手枪都在想我
Just like l knew guys at school thought about me when theyjerked off.

210
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,490
好f心
- Vomit. 

211
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,200
不会，我喜欢，现在也是
- No, l liked it. And l still like it.

212
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,040
当男人看到我就想跟我上床
lf people l don't even know look at me and want to fuck me

213
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,810
这代表我能当模特儿
it means l really have a shot at being a model, 

214
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,140
这样很棒
which is great.

215
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,650
因为当平凡人是最惨的
Because there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary.

216
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,290
你一定能成功
l really think it'll happen for you.

217
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,520
我知道
l know.

218
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,360
因为一个人命中注定的事 一定会发生
Because everything that was meant to happen, does... eventually.

219
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,020
讨厌
Asshole.

220
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,840
“安琪拉海瑟”

221
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,220
喂
Hello?

222
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,590
喂？
Hello?

223
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,270
你打给我干嘛？
- Hello? - Why'd you call me?

224
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,740
没有啊
l didn't.

225
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,180
我一接电话就被挂断
My phone rang and l answered, and somebody hung up.

226
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,150
按自动回电后你就接了
l star-69ed, and l called you back.

227
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,150
我刚才在洗澡
Well, l was in the shower.

228
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,730
好f心
Oh, gross!

229
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,010
芮奇，来吃早饭
Ricky? Breakfast!

230
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,780
马上来
Be right there.

231
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,460
妈
- Mom? - Hello.

232
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,790
我不吃培根，记得吗？
l don't eat bacon, remember?

233
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,430
对不起，我忘了
l'm sorry. l must've forgotten.

234
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,870
爸，有什么新闻？
What's new in the world, Dad?

235
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,280
这国家就快完蛋了
This country is going straight to hell.

236
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,390
你在等人吗？  没有
- Are you expecting anyone? - No.

237
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,700
没有啊
No.

238
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,270
欢迎搬来这个社区
- Hi. - Welcome to the neighborhood.

239
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,830
咱们后院种的
Just something from our garden.

240
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,140
除了义大利I是美食店买的
Except the pasta. We got that at Fallaci's.

241
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,370
新鲜得不得了 丢进滚水一烫就熟
lt's unbelievably fresh. Drop it in the water and it's done.

242
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,650
吉姆欧麦尔
Jim Olmeyer. 

243
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,810
你的邻居，欢迎你们
Two doors down. Welcome to the neighborhood.

244
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,260
海军陆战队法兰克费兹中校
Colonel Frank Fitts, US Marine Corps.

245
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,460
幸会，他是我伙伴
- Nice to meet you. This is my partner. 

246
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,930
吉姆巴克莱，小名JB
- Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.

247
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,090
废话少说
Let's cut to the chase, OK? 

248
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,290
你们想推销什么？
What are you guys selling?

249
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,500
没有，我们只是打声招呼
Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors.

250
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,430
才怪，你们是伙伴
You said you're partners, 

251
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,070
你们是做什么的？
so what's your business?

252
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,910
嗯…
Well...

253
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,710
他是税务律师
He is a tax attorney.

254
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,680
他是麻醉师
And he's an anesthesiologist.

255
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,460
这些臭同志老爱骚扰别人
How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face?

256
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,360
他们怎么会这么无耻？
How can they be so shameless?

257
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,300
重点是他们不觉得这很无耻
That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't feel that's anything to be ashamed of.

258
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,280
无耻透顶
Well, it is.

259
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,440
你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

260
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,810
别把我当你妈一样哄
Don't placate me like l'm your mother, boy.

261
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,650
请恕我有话直说
Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly:

262
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,620
那些臭同志真是令我作呕
Those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out.

263
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,930
我有同感，儿子
Well, me too, Son.

264
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,830
我有同感
Yeah, me too.

265
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,780
是真的，他就把那话儿掏出来
l'm serious. He just pulled down his pants and yanked it out.

266
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,380
然后说，来见我小弟弟
You know, like, "Say hello to Mr. Happy."

267
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,440
好f心
- Gross. 

268
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,760
才不会，挺酷的
- lt wasn't gross. - lt was kind of cool. 

269
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,320
你跟他做了吗？
- So did you do it with him?

270
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,720
当然了
Of course l did.

271
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,650
他是有名的摄影师
He is a really well-known photographer.

272
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,590
经常替超级名模拍照
He shoots for Elle on, like, a regular basis.

273
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,260
拒绝他就未免太猪头了
lt would've been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.

274
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,470
你就像个妓女
You are a total prostitute.

275
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,640
这才是现实社会
Hey. That's how things really are.

276
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,470
你只是个被宠坏的娇娇女
You just don't know because you're this pampered little suburban chick.

277
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,670
你也是
So are you. 

278
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,270
你上过一次杂志，而且很肥
You've only been in Seventeen once, and you looked fat!

279
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,480
别以为自己是超级名模
So stop acting like you're goddamned Christy Turlington!

280
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,540
婊子
Cunt!

281
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,290
我最恨别人嫉妒我就乱骂人
l am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me.

282
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:20,990
我的天
Oh, my God! 

283
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,560
他是昨晚偷拍我的变态
That's the pervert who filmed me last night.

284
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,290
他？
Him? 

285
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,400
不可能，他是个疯子
Jane, no way, he's a total lunatic.

286
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,670
你认识他？
- You know him? - Yeah.

287
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,770
是啊，国三我跟他同校
We were on the same lunch shift when l was in ninth grade

288
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,330
他老是乱说一些奇怪的话
and he would always say the most random, weird things.

289
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,250
有一天他突然消失不见
And then one day, he was just, like, gone.

290
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,980
然后…
And then, 

291
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,680
康妮说他被父母关进疯人院
Connie Cardullo told me that his parents had to put him in a mental institution.

292
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,920
他做了什么？
Why? What did he do?

293
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,880
什么意思？
What do you mean?

294
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,420
乱说话又不会被关进疯人院
Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things.

295
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,700
你这个小骚包
You total slut!

296
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,940
你在暗恋他 什么？拜
- You've got a crush on him! - What? Please!

297
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,640
你爱上他才替他说话 你想要生他的小孩
You're defending him. You love him. You want to have 1 0,000 of his babies.

298
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,750
闭嘴
- Shut up! - Hi.

299
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,210
我叫芮奇，刚搬到你家隔壁
My name's Ricky. l just moved next door to you.

300
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,780
我知道
l know.

301
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,090
昨晚你很变态，一直偷拍我
l remember this really creepy incident where you were filming me last night.

302
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,850
我不想吓你，只是你很有意思
l didn't mean to scare you. l just think you're interesting.

303
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,060
谢了
Thanks, 

304
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,060
不过我不想让变态狂迷上我
but l don't need some psycho obsessing about me right now.

305
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,760
我不是迷上你
l'm not obsessing. l'm just curious.

306
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,730
只是对你很好奇

307
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,950
大怪胎
What a freak!

308
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,190
他活像个摩门教徒
And why does he dress like a Bible salesman?

309
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,090
他好有自信心
He's, like, so confident.

310
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,390
不可思议
That can't be real.

311
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,460
我不敢相信
l don't believe him.

312
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,500
他连看都没看我一眼
l mean, he didn't even look at me once.

313
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,710
你为什么入伍？
How'd you get in the Army?

314
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,340
教官，我有三个理由
Look, Sergeant, l got three reasons for being in the Army.

315
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,270
第一，我忠贞，第二，我爱国
First, l'm patriotic. Second, l love my country. 

316
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,440
第三，我收到徵召令
And third, they nailed me.

317
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,680
解散后马上向我报到
You two boys report to me immediately after this formation.

318
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,220
把他们带走
Take them away, Sarge!

319
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,699
Hey.

320
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:39,452
One, two, three, four.

321
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,900
这是怎么回事？
What's going on here?

322
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,600
趴低点，魔鬼教官来了
Bend all the way down. Here comes the bull of the woods.

323
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,700
你说什么？
l'm sorry, what?

324
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,880
没有人说话
Mom, nobody said anything.

325
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,210
对不起
Oh. l'm sorry.

326
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,390
大家都携伴参加 要不然会惹人f话
Everyone's with their spouse. How'd it look if l showed up with no one?

327
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,120
你一定会跑去跟别人聊天
- You end up ignoring me and talking... - Now listen to me.

328
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,290
听我说，这是重要的应酬
This is an important business function.

329
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:16,100
卖房子就像是贩卖形象 我必须维持好形象
As you know, my business is selling an image and part of myjob is to live that image...

330
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,540
老婆，帮帮忙
Honey, do me a favor.

331
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,100
废话少说，别跟我来这一套 好吧
Just say whatever you want to say and spare me the propaganda.

332
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,280
嗨，雪莉
All right. Hi, Shirley!

333

335
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,650
才怪
- No, you're not.

336
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,790
是巴迪
Oh! That's Buddy!

337
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,310
巴迪
Buddy. 

338
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,450
巴迪…
Buddy!

339
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,020

348
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,440
没关S，连我也不会记得我
lt's OK. l wouldn't remember me, either.

349
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,090
老公，别乱讲话
Honey, don't be weird!

350
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,890
好吧，我不乱讲话
- All right, honey. l won't be weird. - OK.

351
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:17,230
你要我怎样我就怎样
- l'll be whatever you want me to be. - Well, OK...

352
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,440
我们的关S很好
- We have a very healthy relationship. 

353
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,270
是啊
- l see.

354
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,520
你们聊，我去喝酒
Well, l don't know about you guys, but l need a drink.

355
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,290
多倒点，老兄
Put a little more in there, cowboy.

356
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,640
对不起
Excuse me.

357
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,820
你住在罗宾汉街的红门房子？
Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail? The house with the red door?

358
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,520
对
Yeah.

359
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,810
我是芮奇，刚搬到你家隔壁
l'm Ricky Fitts. l just moved in the house next to you.

360
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,020
嗨，我是赖斯特班宁
Hi, Ricky Fitts. l'm Lester Burnham.

361
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,030
你好，班先生
Hi, Mr. Burnham.

362
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,960
你哈不哈草？
Do you party?

363
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,310
什么？
- Excuse me? 

364
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,480
你想爽一下吗？
- Do you get high?

365
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,210
我是有点醉才敢这么说
l probably wouldn't even tell you this if l weren't a little tipsy

366
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,660
我好崇拜你
but... l'm in complete awe of you.

367
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:57,330
你的房屋仲介公司规模庞大
l mean, your firm is hands down the Rolls Royce of local real estate firms

368
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,330
你个人的业绩更是…
and your personal sales record is...

369
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,110
让我自叹不如
lt's very intimidating.

370
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,640
我很想好好研究你的大脑
You know, l'd love to sit down with you and just pick your brain.

371
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,670
如果你肯的话
lf you'd ever be willing.

372
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,740
老实说，虽然我们算同行
You know? l suppose, technically, l'm the competition

373
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:24,920
我根本就没资格和你平起平坐
but, l mean, l don't flatter myself that l'm even in the same league as you.

374
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,320
是真的
l don't.

375
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,830
我很乐意
l'd love to.

376
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,400
真的？     当然了
- Really? - Absolutely.

377
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,870
打给我秘书安排午餐
Call my secretary. Have her schedule a lunch.

378
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,010
好吧，谢谢你
l'll do that. Thank you.

379
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:55,080
有一部恐怖片拍一具无头尸 手e的人头去亲一个美女
Did you see that movie where the body is walking around carrying its own head and then the head goes down on that babe?

380
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,290
“活死人”
Re-Animator.

381
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,200
我不是付你钱跑到外面哈草
Look, l'm not paying you to do whatever it is you're doing out here.

382
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,170
好，那就别付我钱
Fine. So don't pay me.

383
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,370
你说什么？
- Excuse me? - l quit.

384
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,410
我不干了，你不必付我钱
So you don't have to pay me. 

385
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,380
别烦我
Now leave me alone.

386
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,070
臭小子
Asshole.

387
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,990
你是我的偶像
l think you just became my personal hero.

388
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,020
你说不干就不干，不怕吗？
Doesn't that make you nervous, just quitting yourjob like that?

389
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,360
你今年才…十六岁？
Well, l guess when you're all of, what, 16...

390
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,630
十八岁
Eighteen.

391
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,660
这份工作只是幌子
l just do these gigs as a cover.

392
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,900
我有别的收入
l have other sources of income.

393
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:49,940
我为了应付老爸 就假装是有工作的有为青年
But my dad interferes less in my life when l pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.

394
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,010
赖斯特
Lester?!

395
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,280
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

396
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,610
老婆，这是…芮奇
Honey, this... Ricky Fitts.

397
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,250
这是芮奇
This is Ricky Fitts.

398
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,820
我是芮奇，刚搬到你家隔壁
l'm Ricky Fitts. l just moved into the house next to you.

399
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,830
我跟你女儿同校
l go to school with your daughter.

400
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,530
小珍？    对
With Jane? - Yeah.

401
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,130
真的吗？   小珍
 Jane. - Really?

402
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,770
我要走了，门口见
Hi. l'm ready to go. l'll meet you out front.

403
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,040
我死定了
l'm in trouble!

404
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,410
幸会了，谢谢你的烟
Nice meeting you, Ricky Fitts. Thanks for the... thing.

405
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,190
不客气
Anytime. Lester!

406
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,350
还要的话管来找我
lf you want any more, you know where l live.

407
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,380
讨厌，他们回家了
Shit. They're home. 

408
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,910
快点到我房间
Quick, let's go up to my room.

409
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,040
我得跟你爸打声招呼
l should say hi to your dad.

410
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,210
不能没有礼貌
l don't want to be rude.

411
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,260
好正点的西装
Nice suit.

412
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,670
伯父，你很帅哦
You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.

413
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,800
上次你好像有点紧张
Last time l saw you, you looked kind of wound up.

414
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,340
那是沙士吗？
ls that root beer?

415
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,110
我最爱喝沙士了
l love root beer, don't you?

416
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,800
嗨，妈
- Hey. - Hi, Mom.

417
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,310
记得安琪拉吗？
You remember Angela?

418
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,970
当然了
Yes, of course.

419
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,310
我忘了讲，她要来过夜 可以吗？
l forgot to tell you, she's gonna spend the night. ls that OK?

420
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,530
我老爸糗毙了
Sorry about my dad.

421
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,290
不会，他很好玩
Don't be. l think it's funny.

422
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,390
对你来说他只想跟你上床
Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your bones.

423
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,570
对我来说
But to me, 

424
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,610
他真的很丢脸
he's just... too embarrassing to live.

425
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,510
你老妈才丢脸，她好假哦
Well, your mom's the one who's embarrassing. What a phony.

426
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,580
你老爸倒是很可爱
But your dad's actually kind of cute.

427
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,840
闭嘴
Shut up.

428
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,590
是真的 他练一下身体会很性感
He is. lf he just worked out a little, he'd be hot.

429
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,980
闭嘴
- Shut up! - Come on!

430
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,630
难道你没偷看他洗澡吗？
Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear?

431
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,560
他的小弟弟一定很大
l bet he's got a big dick.

432
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,100
你真是有够恶心
You are so grossing me out right now!

433
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,460
要是他是肌肉男我就会搞他
lf he built up his chest and arms, l would totally fuck him!

434
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:39,910
我还会舔你老爸的小弟弟 然后把他搞到爽歪歪
l would! l would suck on your dad's big, fat dick and then l'd fuck him until his eyes rolled back in his head!

435
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,200
什么声音？
Jane! What's that noise?

436
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,150
我听到什么
- l swear l heard something. - Yeah.

437
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,050
那是你淫声浪语的声音
That was the sound of you being a huge, disgusting pig.

438
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,920
我是说真的
No, l'm serious. 

439
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,880
你看
See?

440
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,490
我的天
- Oh, my God, Jane. 

441
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,330
是什么？
- What is it?

442
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,430
隔壁的小变态
lt's that psycho next door. Jane, what if he worships you?

443
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,640
也许他迷上了你

444
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,940
也许他用死人骷髅什么的 对着你的照片烧香膜拜
What if he's got, like, a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?

445
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,910
他一定在拍我们
Shit. l bet he's filming us right now.

446
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,880
真的吗？
Really?

447
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,670
欢迎观赏“变态一箩筐”
Welcome to America's Weirdest Home Videos.

448
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,470
芮奇
- Ricky? 

449
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,240
我来了
- Coming, Dad.

450
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:28,800
我不喜欢你锁住房门
You know l don't like locked doors in my house, boy.

451
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,780
对不起，我不是故意的
l'm sorry. l must've locked it by accident.

452
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,010
有什么事？
So, what's up?

453
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,160
我要你的尿液样本
l need a urine sample.

454
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,730
又过了半年
Wow. lt's been six months already.

455
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,360
我刚小便，明天再给你
Can l give it to you in the morning? l just took a whiz.

456
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,430
好吧
Yeah, l suppose.

457
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,400
你知道…
You know...

458
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,210
晚安，儿子
Well... Good night, Son.

459
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,750
我在等着你
l've been waiting for you.

460
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,000
你练过肌肉，对吧？
You've been working out, haven't you?

461
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,010
我看得出来
l could tell.

462
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,680
我想要你替我洗澡
l was hoping you'd give me a bath.

463
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,820
我好肮脏
l'm very, very dirty.

464
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,190
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

465
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,480
没干嘛
Nothing.

466
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,150
你在自慰
You were masturbating.

467
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,860
才没有    你在自慰
- l was not. - Yes, you were.

468
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,930
我是在自慰，把我拉去枪毙吧
All right, so shoot me! l was whacking off.

469
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,560
没错，我在打手枪
That's right, l was choking the bishop. Chafing the carrot.

470
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,510
跟我的小弟弟玩
You know, saying hi to my monster.

471
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,340
太f心了
- That's disgusting! 

472
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,710
对不起哦 至少我还有一点性趣
- Excuse me, but some of us still have blood pumping through our veins!

473
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,850
我也有
- So do l! 

474
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,720
是吗？
- Really?

475
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,350
只有我肯袢⌒卸
l'm the only one who seems to be doing anything about it!

476
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,050
我不想这样下去
Lester, l refuse to live like this.

477
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,160
我们根本不像夫妻
This is not a marriage!

478
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,460
我们早就没有夫妻之实了
This hasn't been a marriage for years.

479
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,090
我不抱怨你就没意见
But you were happy as long as l kept my mouth shut.

480
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,530
可是我变了
Guess what? l've changed. 

481
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,100
现在我想打手枪就打
And the new me whacks off when he feels horny,

482
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,570
因为你一点也帮不上忙
'cause you're obviously not gonna help me out in that department.

483
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,810
你以为只有你会性|渴吗？
l see. You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated.

484
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:28,010
是吗？那就上呀，宝贝
l'm not? Well, then come on, baby, l'm ready!

485
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,120
别把我惹毛了
Don't you mess with me, mister.

486
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,480
小心我跟你离婚把你整惨
l will divorce you so fast it'll make your head spin!

487
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,820
凭什么？
On what grounds?

488
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,450
我不酗酒，不乱搞外遇
l'm not a drunk. l don't fuck other women.

489
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,650
从来没有动手打过你
l don't mistreat you. l've never hit you.

490
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:45,930
自从你摆明把我当成废物 我连碰都没碰过你
l don't even try to touch you since you made it abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be!

491
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,470
不过我却帮你考到仲介执照
But l did support you when you got your license.

492
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,100
我应该能分你一半的财产
And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours.

493
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,370
待会你上床记得关灯
So turn out the light when you come back to bed, OK?

494
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,760
能够尽情发的感觉很棒
lt's a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself.

495
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,900
也许我的能力不限于此
Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about.

496
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,440
大伙好
Hey, guys!

497
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:27,470
你也跑步吗？
- Lester, l didn't know you ran. 

498
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,070
才开始
- l just started.

499
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,230
太好了
Good for you.

500
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:34,540
你们可以指点指点我 我得赶紧练好身材
l figured you might be able to give me some pointers. l need to shape up. Fast.

501
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,550
你是想减重
Are you looking to just lose weight

502
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,080
还是增强体力跟耐力
or do you want to have increased strength and flexibility as well?

503
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,260
我只想有好身材
l want to look good naked.

504
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,570
搞什么？
What is this?

505
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,540
同性恋大游行吗？
Fucking gay pride parade?

506
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:05,810
芮奇
Hey, Ricky.

507
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,950
我累得半死，他们却轻自在
My life is passing before my eyes and those two have barely broken a sweat.

508
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,290
抱歉，你好 我住隔壁，我们没见过
Sorry, hi. Lester Burnham. l live next door. We haven't met.

Ricky... l was thinking about... the movie we talked about.

513
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,280
“活死人”   没错

514

515
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,250

- OK. - Come on.

516
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,620
帮我拿一下     好
- Can you hold this for a sec? - Sure.

517
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:58,100
有人在我老爸不会闯进来
l don't think my dad would come in while someone else is here,

518
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,460
不过谁晓得
- but you never know. 

519
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,430
这是什么？   尿液
- What is this?  Urine.

520
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:06,130
我每半年得验尿 确定没有吸毒
l have to take a drug test every six months just to make sure l'm clean.

521
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,540
别开玩笑，你昨晚才哈草
Are you kidding? You just smoked with me last night.

522
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,680
这不是我的
lt's not mine.

523
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,670
我有个客户是小儿科护士
One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office.

524
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,740
我算她便宜，她给我乾Q尿液
l cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.

525
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,810
你喜欢平克佛洛伊德乐团？
You like Pink Floyd?

526
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,060
我喜欢很多种音乐
l like a lot of music.

527
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,500
我有好久没听这张唱片
Man, l haven't listened to this album in years.

528
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,260
你要多少？
How much do you want?

529
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,600
不晓得，我好久没买了
l don't know. lt's been a while. 

530
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,930
一盎斯多少？
How much is an ounce?

531

这是好货，三百元
This is totally decent, and it's 300.

lt's extremely potent, but a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

535
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,950
昨晚就是哈这玩意？
ls that what we smoked last night?

536

我只哈这一种草
This is all l ever smoke.

537

两千
- Two grand.

539
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,570
乖乖
Jesus!

540
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,270
时代真的是变了
Things have changed since 1 973.

541
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,980
不必付现，你很可靠
You don't have to pay now. l know you're good for it.

542
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,180
谢了
Thanks.

543
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,580
我的名片有呼叫机号码
There's a card in there with my beeper number.

544
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,080
随时呼叫我都行
Beep me any time, day or night.

545
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,290
我只收现金
And l only accept cash.

546
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,660
怪不得你买得起这些器材
Now l know how you can afford all this equipment.

547
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:40,200
当年我为了买匣式录音机 打了一暑假的工
When l was your age, l flipped burgers all summer just to buy an 8-track.

548
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:41,900
逊毙了
That sucks.

549
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,300
不，其实很棒
No. Actually, it was great.

550
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,230
当年我成天狂欢作乐
All l did was party and get laid.

551
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,480
有挥霍不完的青春
l had my whole life ahead of me.

552
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,480
我爸以为这是打工赚来的
My dad thinks l pay for all this with catering jobs.

553
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,750
自欺欺人有时候很有用
Never underestimate the power of denial.

554
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,920
你这是在干什么？
What the hell do you think you're doing?

555
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,660
母老虎发威了
Mom's mad. 

556
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,090
我在举重
Bench presses.

557
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:48,690
我先练胸肌然后再练背肌
l'm going to whale on my pecs, and then l'm going to do my back.

558
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,530
你在哈草，那敢情好
l see you're smoking pot now. l'm so glad.

559
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:58,900
吸食非法的违禁药物 真是给咱们女儿的好模范
l think using illegal psychotropic substances is a very positive example to set for our daughter.

560
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:03,110
你这拜金女郎凭什么教训我
You're one to talk, you bloodless, money-grubbing freak.

561
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:08,550
你怎么讲话这么毒？
Lester, you have such hostility in you!

562
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,520
拜，让我健身好吗？
Do you mind? l'm trying to work out here.

563
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,880
除非你想帮我
Unless you want to spot me.

564
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:18,660
你一定会得到报应的
Lester, you will not get away with this! You can be sure of that!

565
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:25,670
话…别…说得…太早
That's... what...you... think.

566
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:32,340
“我在公司只能偷骂溷帐的上司”
"Myjob consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge

567
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:39,020
“每天至少有一次 我会跑到男厕打手枪”
and, at least once a day, retiring to the men's room so l can jerk off

568
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:44,690
“然后幻想我的人生不是地狱”
while l fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble hell."

569
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:49,080
我看你是不想保住饭碗
Well, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.

570
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:53,670
十四年来我为工作出卖灵魂
Brad, for 14 years l've been a whore for the advertising industry.

571
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:56,100
现在我只想对公司开火
The only way l could save myself now is if l start firebombing.

572
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,600
随便你 你今天就得云谈亲呗
Whatever. Management wants you gone by the end of the day.

573
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:04,130
你们打算给我多少遣散费
What sort of severance package is management prepared to offer me

574
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:08,770
我知道主编用公司的钱召妓
considering the information l have about our editorial director

575
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,590
这种事国税局一定很感兴趣 因为牵扯到某种诈欺
buying pussy with company money? Which l think would interest the lRS, since it technically constitutes fraud.

576
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,750
杂志的广告主和对手 也一定很想知道
l'm sure that some of our advertisers and rival publications might like to know about it as well. 

577
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,060
更别说他老婆
Not to mention... Craig's wife.

578
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,150
你想要什么？
- What do you want? 

579
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,420
一年的薪水加福利
- One year's salary with benefits.

580
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,200
不可能
That's not going to happen.

581
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,070
那我就顺便提出性骚扰告诉
What do you say l throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot?

582
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,910
你想告谁？
- Against who? 

583
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,740
告你啊
- Against you.

584
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:45,850
你能证明你没有 逼我让你替我吹箫吗？
Can you prove that you didn't offer to save myjob if l let you blow me?

585
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:54,530
你是个大疯子
Man... You are one twisted fuck.

586
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:00,920
不是 我只是一个义无反顾的平凡人
Nope. l'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.

587
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:07,942
Yeah!

588
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,110
卡洛琳     巴迪
- Carolyn. - Buddy.

589
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,620
抱歉让你等这么久
l am so sorry to have kept you waiting.

590
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:27,320
克莉丝到纽约了 家e可以说是一团乱
Christy left for New York this morning. Let's just say things were a little hectic around the house.

591
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,190
她到纽约干嘛？
What's she doing in New York?

592
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,950
她要去搬去纽约，我们离婚了
She's moving there. Yes. We are splitting up.

593
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,660
很遗憾
- Buddy, l'm so sorry. 

594
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,630
是啊
- Yes.

595
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,470
她说…我太投入工作了
According to her, l'm too focused on my career.

596
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,040
好像我的事业成功反倒是…
As if being driven to succeed is some sort of a

597
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,580
我的不对
character flaw.

598
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:54,810
她倒是很会享受我赚来的钱
She certainly did take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her.

599
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:57,910
这样也好
lt's for the best.

600
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,590
那天看到你们好像幸福
When l saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

601
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,430
听我一言
Call me crazy...

602
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,460
我的看法是，想要成功
...but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful,

603
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:16,800
就得随时随地维持完美形象
one must project an image of success at all times.

604
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,550
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

605
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:41,530
我在拍这b死鸟
l was filming this dead bird.

606
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,590
为什么？
Why?

607
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,430
因为它很美
Because it's beautiful.

608
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,070
你是不是忘了吃药？
l think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental-boy.

609
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:54,780
你好，小珍
Hi, Jane.

610
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,920
我要你别再拍我
Look, l want you to stop filming me.

611
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,380
好
OK.

612
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:05,620
别看了，他好无聊，走吧
Well, whatever. This is boring. Let's go.

613
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,920
你要搭便车吗？
- Do you need a ride? 

614
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,690
你疯啦？
- Are you crazy?

615
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,070
我不想被他分尸丢进垃圾桶
l don't want to end up hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere.

616
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,530
没关S，我走路
lt's OK. l'll walk. 

617
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,640
谢了
But thanks.

618
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,030
他不想来，走吧
See? He doesn't want to go anyway. Come on. Let's go.

619
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,600
来吧
Come on, Jane.

620
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,110
我也想走路
l think l'm gonna walk, too.

621
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,310
什么？
What? Jane, that's, like, almost a mile!

622
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:30,910
拜，有一哩路耶

623
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:49,260
爽毙了
God! l love it!

624
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,430
你爱被仲介王搞吗？
- You like getting nailed by the king? 

625
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,030
爱死了
- Yes, l love it!

626
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,000
操我吧，陛下
Fuck me, Your Majesty!

627
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,710
谁是国王？      你
- Who's the king? - You are!

628
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,770
谁是国王？
Who's the king?

629
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,530
美国女郎，离我远点
American woman  Stay away from me

630
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:25,870
美国女郎，别来烦我
American woman  Mama let me be

631
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,340
别跑来敲我家门
Don't come hanging around my door

632
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:32,140
我不想再见到你
l don't wanna see your face no more

633
00:56:32,939 --> 00:56:36,484
l got better things to do Than spend my life growing old with you

634
00:56:36,652 --> 00:56:38,486
Now woman

635
00:56:38,654 --> 00:56:41,281
l said, "Stay away"

636
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,170
笑一笑，欢迎光临
- Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's. 

637
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,200
什么？
- What?

638
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:51,310
今天的特餐是培根蛋堡 只要一块两毛九
Would you like to try our new bacon and egg fajita, just $1 .29 for a limited time only?

639
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,470
不了，谢谢
No, but thank you.

640
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:57,620
我要大汉堡、薯条跟橘子汽水
l'd like the Big Barn Burger, Smiley Fries, and an orange soda.

641
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,850
请开到窗口付帐，谢谢
Please drive up to the window. Thank you.

642

谢谢光临，四块九毛八
Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's. That'll be $4.98, please.

643
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,160
“今日徵人”

644
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,490
您要特u酱料吗？
- Would you like some Smiley Sauce?

645
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:13,160
不要，我想申请工作
- No, no. Actually, l'd like to fill out an application.

646
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,600
经理没缺，只有服务生
There's no jobs for manager. lt's just for counter.

647
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,100
很好
Good.

648
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:24,950
我想找不动脑筋的工作
l'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility.

649
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,640
你不适合这工作
l don't think you'd fit in here.

650
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,750
我干过速食餐饮业
l have fast-food experience.

651
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,250
那是二十年前
Yeah, like 20 years ago!

652
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,310
虽然速食餐饮业日新月异
l'm sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry,

653
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,020
不过应该有职前训练吧
but surely you must have some sort of training program.

654
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,720
别以为我一定学不会
lt seems unfair to presume l won't be able to learn.

655
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,800
你让我好舒服
That was exactly what l needed.

656
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,810
可以说是“皇家的享受”
The royal treatment, so to speak.

657
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,610
我的压力一直都太大
l was so stressed out.

658
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,760
你知道我都怎样吗？
- Know what l do when l feel like that? 

659
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:10,880
怎样？
- What?

660
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,560
我去打靶
l fire a gun.

661
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:19,600
真的吗？ 我都到市区的靶场
Really?  Yeah, l go to this little firing range downtown

662
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,570
狠狠地开几枪
and l just pop off a few rounds.

663
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,860
我没开过枪
l've never fired a gun before.

664
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,040
你得试试看 没有什么比它更爽
Well, you've got to try it. Nothing makes you feel more powerful.

665
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,910
除了一件事
Well, almost nothing.

666
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,490
你喜欢新家吗？
So, do you like your new house?

667
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,080
喜欢
l like it.

668
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:50,270
以前的屋主常常喂流浪猫 我妈差点没抓狂
The people who used to live there fed stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts.

669
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,860
后来她砍掉他们的树
And then she cut down their tree.

670
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,200
那是出殡吗？
- ls that a funeral? 

671
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:00,330
对，你有认识的人死过吗？
Yeah. Have you ever known anybody who died?

672
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:03,300
没有，你呢？
No. Have you?

673
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,370
没有
No.

674
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,210
不过我看过女流浪汉冻死
But l did see this homeless woman who froze to death once.

675
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:13,190
她就躺在人行道 看起来好可怜
Just lying there on the sidewalk. She looked really sad.

676
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,430
我把她拍下来了
l got that homeless woman on videotape.

677
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,870
你为什么要拍？
Why would you film that?

678
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,970
因为很动人
Because it was amazing.

679
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,350
有什么动人的？
What's amazing about it?

680
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,410
当你看到这种事
When you see something like that

681
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,910
就像是上帝在凝视着你
it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second.

682
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,150
你只要留意就能看到k
And if you're careful, you can look right back.

683
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,750
你看到什么？
And what do you see?

684
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,690
美
Beauty.

685
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,200
妈，我要你见一个人
Mom? l want you to meet somebody.

686
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,380
妈？
- Mom? 

687
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,010
什么事？
- Yes.

688
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,690
我要你见一个人，这是小珍
l want you to meet somebody. This is Jane.

689
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:27,360
真是的，家e真是一团乱
- Hi. - Oh, my. l apologize for the way things look around here.

690
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,170
我老爸都一个人来这儿
This is where my dad hides out.

691
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,940
我猜他很喜欢枪
l take it he's got a thing for guns.

692
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,580
你得看这个
You got to see this one thing.

693
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:51,450
被他发现我会被打死
My dad would kill me if he knew l was in here.

694
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,080
你偷拿他的钥匙？
Did you steal his keys?

695
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:57,320
没有，有个客户是锁匠
No. One of my clients is a locksmith.

696
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:59,950
他缺钱，所以用这个交换
He was short on cash one night, so l let him pay me in trade.

697
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:15,930
翻过来
Turn it over.

698
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:21,780
我的天
Oh, my God.

699
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,610
第三帝国的官方瓷盘
lt's, like, official state china of the Third Reich.

700
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,550
有一群人专门L集纳粹玩意
There's a whole subculture of people who collect this Nazi shit.

701
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,820
我老爸只有这盘子
But my dad just has this one thing.

702
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,200
怎么了？
- What's wrong? 

703
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,330
没事
- Nothing.

704
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,300
你怕我
- No, you're scared of me. 

705
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,570
不是
- No, l'm not.

706
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,480
你想看我拍过最美的事吗？
You want to see the most beautiful thing l've ever filmed?

707
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:25,870
那一天很奇妙 再过几分钟就要下雪
lt was one of those days where it's a minute away from snowing...

708
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:31,350
空气中充满能量
...and there's this electricity in the air.

709
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,720
几乎听得到
You can almost hear it.

710
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,020
对吗？
Right?

711
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,720
这个塑胶袋…
And this bag was just...

712
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:49,200
就和我跳起舞来
...dancing with me.

713
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:53,970
像一个小孩求我陪他玩
Like a little kid, begging me to play with it.

714
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,400
整整十五分钟
For 1 5 minutes.

715
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,550
那一天我突然发现
That's the day l realized that there was this...

716
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,990
事物的背后都有一种生命
...entire life behind things...

717
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,430
一股慈悲的力量
...and this incredibly benevolent force

718
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,990
让我知道其实我不必害怕
that wanted me to know that there was no reason to be afraid...

719
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:24,700
永远不必怕
...ever.

720
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,410
影片比不上亲眼目睹
Video's a poor excuse, l know.

721
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,080
不过它让我牢记这件事
But it helps me remember.

722
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,420
我必须牢记
l need to remember.

723
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:51,160
有时候这个世界…
Sometimes there is so much...

724
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,570
拥有太多的美
...beauty... in the world.

725
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,870
我好像无法承受
l feel like l can't take it.

726
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,080
我的心…
And my heart...

727
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:12,480
差一点就要崩溃
...is just going to cave in.

728
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:02,360
天啊，几点了？
Oh, my God. What time is it?

729
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:11,680
抱歉我这么晚
- Sorry l'm late. 

730
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,310
没关系
- That's quite all right, dear.

731
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,440
我跟你爸在谈他的工作
Your father and l were just discussing his day at work.

732
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:18,550
老公，跟女儿谈谈吧
Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey?

733
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,090
今天我辞职不干
Janie, today l quit myjob. Then l told my boss to go fuck himself

734
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,180
我叫老板去死 还勒索他给我六万元
and blackmailed him for almost $60,000. Pass the asparagus.

735
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:29,390
把芦笋传给我 你爸认为这种事很光荣
Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.

736
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:34,600
你妈只想让我活得像个囚犯 让我的小弟弟无用武之地
Your mother seems to prefer l go through life like a prisoner while she keeps my dick in a jar under the sink.

737
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,230
你怎么能说这种话？
How dare you speak to me that way in front of her?

738
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:42,370
你被开除还敢这么大声说话
l marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me on the same day that you lose your job!

739
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,480
我没有被开除，好吗？ 是老子不干的
l didn't lose it. lt's not like, "Where'd myjob go?" l quit!

740
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:46,740
把芦笋传给我
Someone pass the asparagus, please.

741
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:52,250
谢谢你让我一个人负担家计
Thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now. 

742
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:53,220
我找到工作
- l already have a job.

743
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,890
你根本没有想到房贷
Don't give a second thought as to who's gonna pay the mortgage.

744
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,550
你只会把问题丢给我 让我搞定一切
We'll just leave it all to Carolyn! "You're gonna take care of everything?"

745
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:04,330
好像我不介意 一个人背负起家计重担
"Yes, l don't mind." "You mean everything? You don't mind having the sole responsibility?

746
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,460
你却潇洒地辞职不干
Your husband feels he can quit his job..."

747
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,400
拜谁把芦笋传给我好吗？
Will someone pass the fucking asparagus?

748
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:10,630
我不想管你们
- l'm not gonna be a part of this. 

749
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:11,400
给我坐下
- Sit down!

750
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:34,790
我受不了你们把我当隐形人
l am sick and tired of being treated like l don't exist.

751
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:40,030
你们想做什么都行 我不会抱怨
You two do whatever you want to do whenever you want, and l don't complain. All l want...

752
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,760
不会吗？我一定是耳聋了
You don't complain? Please! Excuse me, excuse me!

753
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,710
你不是在抱怨吗？
l must be psychotic! lf you don't complain, what is this?

754
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:50,040
拜你别让我笑掉大牙
Yeah, let's bring in the laugh meter and see how loud it gets on that one! You don't...

755
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:02,960
老婆，别打岔
Don't interrupt me, honey.

756
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,760
还有一件事
And another thing.

757
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,010
从现在起，音乐要换着听
From now on, we're going to alternate our dinner music

758
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,510
不是只有我这么想
because, frankly, and l don't think l'm alone here,

759
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:27,140
这种轻音乐难听死了
l am really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.

760
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,030
走开
Go away!

761
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,720
小珍，让我进去
Honey, please let me in.

762
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:55,040
我不想让你看到刚才那一幕 不过我也很庆幸
l wish that you hadn't witnessed that awful scene, but in a way, l'm glad.

763
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,770
为什么？你跟老爸都很变态
Why? So l can see what freaks you and Dad really are?

764
01:07:58,780 --> 01:07:59,770
我变态？
Me?

765
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:07,890
妈，别这样
Oh, God. Christ, Mom.

766
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:11,290
我很庆幸…
No, l'm glad because...

767
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:17,520
现在你学会人生最重要的一课
Because you're old enough now to learn 

768
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,990
你不能靠别人只能靠自己
the most important lesson in life:

769
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:30,340
你这辈子只能靠自己
You cannot count on anyone except yourself.

770
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:34,140
很悲哀，不过是真的
You know, it's sad but true.

771
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,610
越早学会这点越好
And the sooner you learn it, the better.

772
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,690
我没心情跟你演欢乐一家亲
Look, Mom, l really don't feel like having a Kodak moment here, OK?

773
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,590
没良心的小贱人
You ungrateful little brat!

774
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,590
你拥有这一切
Just look at everything you have!

775
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,460
我小时候只能住小公寓
When l was your age, l lived in a duplex!

776
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:52,400
哪来这么大的房子？
We didn't even have our own house.

777
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:57,950
小畜生
You little bastard!

778
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:59,620
你是怎么打开的？
- No, l just... - How did you get in there?

779
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,850
说啊！说啊！
How? How?

780
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,090
给我起来
Come on, get up! Come on!

781
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:07,170
起来
Get up!

782
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:10,360
还手呀，小孬种
Fight back, you little pussy!

783
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,130
我不会还手
No, sir, l won't fight you!

784
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,800
你是怎么打开的？
- How?! How did you get in there? 

785
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,140
用东西撬开的
- l picked the lock, sir.

786
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,310
你在找什么？钱？
What were you looking for? Money? 

787
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:19,900
你又在吸毒吗？
Are you on dope again?

788
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:22,880
我只想让女朋友看纳粹瓷盘
No, sir. l wanted to show my girlfriend your Nazi plate.

789
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,510
女朋友？
- A girlfriend? 

790
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:27,750
对，她住在隔壁
- Yes, sir. She lives next door.

791
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,660
她叫小珍
Her name's Jane.

792
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:05,220
我这是为你好
This is for your own good, boy.

793
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:13,460
你一点都不尊重别人的事物
You have no respect for other people's things and for authority.

794
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:15,030
是，对不起
Yes, sir. l'm sorry.

795
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:19,110
你不能爱怎样就怎样
Can't just go around doing whatever you feel like!

796
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:22,440
你得懂得守规矩
- You can't! There are rules in life. 

797
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:23,600
是的
- Yes, sir.

798
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,710
你要懂得规矩
You need structure, yeah.

799
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,280
你要有纪律
- You need discipline! - Discipline. 

800
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:35,190
是，谢谢你教我，别对我失望
Yes, sir. Thank you for trying to teach me. Don't give up on me, Dad.

801
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:41,860
芮奇
Ricky...

802
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,830
别动我的东西
You stay out of there!

803
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:42,420
班太太，一开始我以为你不行
l gotta say, when you first came here, l thought you would be hopeless.

804
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,620
不过你是天生好手
But you're a natural.

805
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:47,350
我只知道，我好爱开枪
Well, all l know is, l love shooting this gun!

806
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:52,500
别阻止我，我一定要高飞
Don't tell me not to fly l've simply got to

807
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:55,760
若是跌倒也是我不是你
lf someone takes a spill lt's me and not you

808
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,500
别让乌云遮掩我的阳光
Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade

809
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:09,110
我要昂首阔步、击鼓高歌
l'm gonna march my band out, l'll beat my drum

810
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:15,120
要是我失败，轮到你出击
And if l'm found out, Your turn at bat, sir

811
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:20,350
至少我试过，虽败也犹荣
At least l didn't fake it Hat, sir, So what? l didn't make it

812
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:29,460
没有人…我说没有人…
Nobody... l said nobody

813
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:33,270
没有人…
Nobody

814
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:42,550
能让乌云遮掩我的阳光
Had better rain on my parade

815
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,470
怎么了？
What?

816
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:04,600
那是谁的车？
Whose car is that out front?

817
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,200
我的
Mine. 

818
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,970
70年火鸟跑车
1970 Pontiac Firebird,

819
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,410
梦寐以求的跑车终于到手
the car l've always wanted, and now l have it.

820
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,770
我最
- l rule. 

821
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,340
旧车呢？
- Where's the Camry?

822
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:14,610
拿去换了
l traded it in.

823
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,810
你不是该先问我吗？
Shouldn't you have consulted me first?

824
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,580
我想想看
Let me think.

825
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,250
不必，你又没开过
No. You never drove it.

826
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:25,450
你换了型吗？
Have you done something different? 

827
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,090
你好漂亮
You look great.

828
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:33,360
小珍呢？
Where's Jane?

829
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:36,000
她不在家
Jane not home.

830
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,340
这么说来…
We have...

831
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:52,520
整间房子只有我们俩
...the whole house... to ourselves.

832
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,190
真是的，卡洛琳
Christ, Carolyn.

833
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:00,120
你是几时变得…
When did you become so...

834
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,590
这么不开心？
...joyless?

835
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,900
不开心？
Joyless?

836
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,000
我没有不开心
l am not joyless.

837
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:16,480
大秀才，我有很多事你不知道
There happens to be a lot about me that you don't know, Mr. Smarty Man.

838
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:20,480
我现在是天天开心
There is plenty ofjoy in my life.

839
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,480
你以前在舞会上…
Whatever happened to that girl...

840
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:33,320
觉得无聊会假装休克
...who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored?

841
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:38,650
你还爬到我们的小公寓屋顶
Who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building

842
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,670
对着直升机露屁股
to flash the traffic helicopters?

843
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:46,240
难道你都忘了吗？
Have you totally forgotten about her?

844
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:49,000
我可没忘
Because l haven't.

845
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,480
你会把啤酒倒在沙发上
Lester, you're gonna spill beer on the couch.

846
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,630
又怎样？这只是沙发
So what? lt's just a couch.

847
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,700
这是四千块的义大利高级沙发
This is a $4,000 sofa upholstered in ltalian silk!

848
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:23,400
不是普通的沙发
This is not just a couch!

849
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:27,040
这只是沙发
lt's just a couch!

850
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,310
不是你的人生
This isn't life!

851
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,570
这只是物质
This is just stuff.

852
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:36,450
你却把物质看得比生命重要 太荒唐了
And it's become more important to you than living. Honey, that's just nuts.

853
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,460
我只是想帮你
l'm only trying to help you!

854
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,270
别拍我
Don't.

855
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,570
为什么？
Why?

856
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:05,480
看到自己很奇怪 我不喜欢自己
lt's weird watching myself. l don't like how l look.

857
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:11,380
你不知道你很美吗？
Can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are.

858
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:14,830
我不想听你说疯话
Look, l'm not gonna sit here for that shit.

859
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,130
你觉得怎样？
How does it feel now?

860
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:28,910
很好
- Fine. 

861
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:31,040
你不觉得很赤裸吗？
- You don't feel naked?

862
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,010
我本来就是赤裸
l am naked.

863
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,350
你懂我的意思
You know what l mean.

864
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:48,520
说说疗养院的事
So tell me about being in the hospital.

865
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:56,030
我十五岁哈草被我爸逮到
When l was 1 5, my dad caught me smoking dope.

866
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,770
他决定把我送到军事学校
He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school.

867
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:04,940
要我学会规矩和纪律
l told you his thing about structure and discipline, right?

868
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,540
不过我被学校开除
Well, of course, l got kicked out.

869
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,480
我们吵了一大架
Dad and l had this huge fight.

870
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:13,680
他打我
He hit me.

871
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,790
隔天同学讥笑我的型
And the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut.

872
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,250
我突然抓狂
And l just snapped.

873
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,930
我想要杀死他
l wanted to kill him.

874
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:32,740
要不是我被拉开
l would've killed him...

875
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:36,430
他早就挂了
...if they hadn't pulled me off.

876
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:43,680
于是我爸就把我送进疯人院
That's when my dad put me in the hospital.

877
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:46,880
我在e头待了两年
They drugged me up and left me in there for two years.

878
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,760
你一定恨死他了
You must really hate him.

879
01:19:57,670 --> 01:19:59,220
他不是坏人
He's not a bad man.

880
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:03,800
我爸敢这么做我一定恨死他
You'd better believe l'd hate my dad if he did something like that to me.

881
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:10,680
等等，我早就恨他了
Wait. l already do hate my dad.

882
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,540
为什么？
Why?

883
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,280
他是个溷蛋
He's a total asshole.

884
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:20,350
他迷上安琪拉，f心死了
He's got this crush on my friend Angela, and it's disgusting.

885
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,920
你希望他迷上你
You'd rather he had the crush on you.

886
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,090
拜，才不是
Gross. No.

887
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:33,590
我只希望他能多注意我一点
But it'd be nice if l was anywhere near as important to him as she is.

888
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:41,300
你觉得他是好好先生，你错了
l know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong.

889
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:45,610
他对我造成很大的心理伤害
He's doing massive psychological damage to me.

890
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:48,010
怎么说？
How?

891
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:51,550
我也得守规矩
Well, now, l, too, need structure.

892
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:54,110
还需要一点纪律
A little fucking discipline.

893
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,960
我是说真的
l'm serious, though.

894
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,390
他是真的伤害了我
How could he not be damaging me?

895
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,500
我需要一个模范父亲
l need a father who's a role model.

896
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:21,080
不是看到漂亮美眉 就流口水的色鬼老爸
Not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever l bring a girlfriend home from school.

897
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,280
他逊毙了
What a lame-o.

898
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,480
应该有人帮他结束可悲的生命
Someone really should just put him out of his misery.

899
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,890
要我干掉他吗？
Want me to kill him for you?

900
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:48,430
好，你肯吗？
Yeah. Would you?

901
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,000
你得花一笔钱
lt'll cost you.

902
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:54,940
我十岁起就当保母
l've been babysitting since l was about ten.

903
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:57,850
存了三千元
l've got almost $3,000.

904
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:02,950
本来是用来隆胸的
Course, l was saving it up for a boob job.

905
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,490
但是…
But...

906
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,830
这么做不太好
You know, that's not a very nice thing to do.

907
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,780
请杀手干掉你老爸
Hiring someone to kill your dad.

908
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:34,250
我猜我不是好女孩
l guess l'm not a very nice girl, then, am l?

909
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:00,450
你知道我在说笑，对吧？
You know l'm not serious, right?

910
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,210
当然了
Of course.

911
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:21,430
我们能相遇真的很幸运
You know how lucky we are to have found each other?

912
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,200
有一张海报上面写
Remember those posters that said:

913
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,880
每一天都是你一生的开始
"Today is the first day of the rest of your life"?

914
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:37,640
只有一天不是
Well, that's true of every day except one:

915
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,050
你死的那一天
The day you die.

916
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,530
小珍，快点
Jane, hurry up.

917
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:23,760
我有重要的约会
l've got a very important appointment.

918
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:26,470
今天安琪拉能来过夜吗？
Mom, is it OK if Angela sleeps over tonight?

919
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:29,300
当然了，欢迎呀
Well, of course. She's always welcome.

920
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:32,600
我还以为你们闹翻了呢
l thought you two had a fight. l haven't seen her around here in a while.

921
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:41,380
怎么了？
- What? 

922
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,810
我不好意思带她来
- l've been too embarrassed to bring her over.

923
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,250
因为你那副色迷迷的样子
Because of you and that way you behave.

924
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:51,220
乱讲，我根本没跟她说过话
What are you talking about? l've barely even spoken to her.

925
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:55,160
你老是盯着她看 像个老色鬼，好f心
You stare at her all the time! Like you're drunk! - lt's disgusting! 

926
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,630
你最好小心 别变成你妈那种母老虎
- Watch yourself, Jane, or you're gonna turn into a real bitch, just like your mother!

927
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,030
该死
Fuck.

928
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,610
准备好了吗？
You ready to go?

929
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:20,990
你不必送我 我要跟小珍一起上学
l don't need a ride. l'm going in with Jane and her mom.

930
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:30,420
早
Oh, morning.

931
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,830
芮奇，你好吗？
- Hey, Ricky. How's it going? 

932
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,690
还不错
- Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham. Hey, hey.

赶快做一份超级起士堡

934
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,880
别这么急，小兄弟
You need more than that, my little hombre.

935
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:04,450
有什么好吃的？
- Yeah. What's good here? 

936
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,650
没有
- Nothing!

937
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:08,250
那么我们就得吃自己
Then l guess we'll just have to be bad, won't we?

938
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:13,370
我要麦笑堡、薯条跟奶昔
l'll have a Double Smiley sandwich, - curly fries and a vanilla shake. 

939
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,160

940
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:17,260
七块九毛八，请到窗口付帐
That'll be $7.98. Please drive up to the window. Thank you.

941
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:22,630
激烈运动后来点垃圾食物无妨
l think we deserve a little junk food after the workout we had this morning.

942
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:25,200
你太棒了
- Did you know that? 

943
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,470
过奖了
- Thank you. l'm flattered.

944

Would you like to try our new beef and cheese pot pie on a stick? Just $1 .99 for a limited time only?

946

我们刚上完课
We were just at a seminar.

947
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:42,190
巴迪，他是…
- Buddy, this is my... 

948
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,350
她的老公
- Her husband.

949
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,090
我们见过面
We've met before,

950
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:48,290
这次你一定会记得我
but something tells me you're going to remember me this time.

951
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,570
这下你可被逮到了
You are so busted.

952
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,670
这不关你的事
This really doesn't concern you!

953
01:27:55,780 --> 01:28:00,210
贞妮是点餐经理 这是她的地盘
Actually, Janine is senior drive-thru manager, so you kind of are on her turf.

954
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,240
你们很速配
So, this makes sense.

955
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:08,850
赖斯特
- Oh, Lester... 

956
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:11,620
没关S，我希望你快乐
- Honey, it's OK. l want you to be happy.

957
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,720
你们要特u酱料吗？
- Would you like Smiley sauce with that? 

958
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,990
别闹了
- Lester, just stop it!

959
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:16,120
错了
No, no. You...

960
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:20,560
你不能再对我颐指气使
...don't get to tell me what to do...

961
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,630
再也不能了
...ever... again.

962
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,940
对不起
l'm sorry.

963
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:43,150
我们得分开一阵子
l guess we should cool it for a while.

964
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:48,830
否则我得付一大笔赡养费
l'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce.

965
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:52,160
我完全t解
No. l understand completely.

966
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:59,070
想要成功就得维持完美形象
ln order to be successful, one must project an image of success at all times.

967
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,060
别哭，别哭
Stop it. Stop it.

968
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:10,340
该死
Shit.

969
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,180
我要到隔壁
l have to run next door.

970
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:22,680
小珍忘了她的课本 她得做功课
Jane left her geometry book in my bag. She needs it to do her homework.

971
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:36,730
你跟小变态经常上床对吧？
You and psycho-boy are fucking on a regular basis now, right?

972
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,100
没有
- No. 

973
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:40,640
少来，告诉我嘛
- Come on, you can tell me.

974
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,270
他的小鸡鸡大吗？
Does he have a big dick?

975
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:45,970
我才不会告诉你 事情不是这样
l'm not going to talk about his dick with you, OK? lt's not like that.

976
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,280
难道他没有小鸡鸡吗？
Not like what? Doesn't he have one?

977
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:52,140
你为什么不想说？
Why don't you want to talk about it?

978
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:54,950
谁跟我上床我都会跟你说
l tell you every single detail about every guy that l fuck.

979
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:57,950
也许你不该说
Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right?

980
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,150
也许我根本就不想听
Maybe l really don't want to hear about all that.

981
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:04,090
你有男朋友就不屑听吗？
So now that you have a boyfriend, you're above it?

982
01:31:05,230 --> 01:31:06,960
你需要真正的男人
We got to get you a real man.

983
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,020
你有暂沃铰穑
- You got any papers? - Yeah.

984
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,060
在雪茄盒e
ln the cigar box right over there.

985
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,990
有点原则，拒绝我嘛
Put up a fight, dude. You are such a pushover.

986
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,930
就说你不要嘛
"No, l can't, really, no. OK."

987
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,330
你应该学会暂
You should learn to roll a joint.

988
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,990
妈呢？
- Hi. - Where's Mom?

989
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:47,760
不知道
- Don't know. 

990
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:49,490
伯父好
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.

991

看看你
- Wow. Look at you.

993
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:55,500
你有健身吗？
- Have you been working out? 

994
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:56,770
有一点
- Some.

995
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,410
看得出来
You can really tell.

996
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:08,680
看看你的臂肌
Look at those arms.

997
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:15,190
你喜欢肌肉男吗？
You like muscles?

998
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:20,730
我去看小珍在干嘛
l should probably go see what Jane's up to.

999
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:34,310
钱是哪儿来的？
Where did you get that?

1000
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,310
我的薪水
From myjob.

1001
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:40,110
不要骗我
You don't lie to me.

1002
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,390
我看你去找他
Now, l saw you with him.

1003
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:47,620
你在监视我？
You were watching me?

1004
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:51,590
他逼你做什么？
What did he make you do?

1005
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,940
你以为我跟班先生…
Dad, you don't really think me and Mr. Burnham...

1006
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,800
别笑我
Don't you laugh at me!

1007
01:34:00,570 --> 01:34:05,030
我不能看着我独子变成同志
Now, l will not sit back and watch my only son become a cocksucker!

1008
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:11,690
老天，你到底有什么毛病？
Jesus! What is it with you?

1009
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:15,380
我发誓我会把你赶出家门
l swear to God l'll throw you out of this house and never look at you again!

1010
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:16,950
你是说真的
- You mean that. 

1011
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:19,450
当然了
- You're damn straight l do!

1012
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:22,950
你死了都比变成同志好
l'd rather you were dead than be a fucking faggot!

1013
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:35,930
没错
You're right.

1014
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:41,440
我是牛郎
- l suck dick for money. 

1015
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,210
小子，闭嘴
- Boy, don't start!

1016
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:45,890
我最会吹箫，要价两千
$2,000. l'm that good.

1017
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:46,950
滚出去
Get out!

1018
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:51,750
要我搞也行 我保证让你爽歪歪
And you should see me fuck! l'm the best piece of ass in three states!

1019
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:55,590
溷帐，给我滚 我不想再看到你
Damn it, get out! l don't ever want to see you again!

1020
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:05,370
你是可怜的老头儿
What a sad old man you are.

1021
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,580
快滚
Get out.

1022
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:35,730
妈
Mom...

1023
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,270
我要走了
- l'm leaving. 

1024
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,400
好
- OK.

1025
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:45,070
要穿件雨衣
Wear a raincoat.

1026
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:54,610
真希望你能过得好些
l wish things would have been better for you.

1027
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:00,790
好好照顾爸爸
Take care of Dad.

1028
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:35,590
消除别人对你的威胁
...disinvesting problems of power

1029
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,660
别让他们让你害怕
and removing their ability to make us afraid.

1030
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:42,070
这是自我进步的要决
This is the secret to "Me-Centered Living."

1031
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:45,760
只要对自己的行为完全负责
Only by taking full responsibility for your actions and their solutions

1032
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:51,210
就不会再受到他人的伤害
will you ever break free from the constant cycle of victimhood.

1033
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,810
千万不要选择当一名弱者…
You are only a victim if you choose to be a victim. We all have the power...

1034
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,380
我们不能再当死党
l don't think we can be friends anymore. 

1035
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:01,580
你对性太保守了
You're way too uptight about sex.

1036
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:04,650
别跟我老爸上床
Just don't fuck my dad, all right?

1037
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,150
拜
- Please? 

1038
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:07,150
为什么？
- Why not?

1039
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,330
爸，别烦我们
- Dad, leave us alone! 

1040
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,190
是我
- lt's me.

1041
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:15,560
我今晚要走，你肯跟来吗？
lf l had to leave tonight, would you come with me?

1042
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:16,600
什么？
- What? 

1043
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:20,230
我今晚去纽约，你肯来吗？
- lf l had to go to New York to live, tonight, would you come with me?

1044
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:22,970
肯
- Yes. 

1045
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,700
别开玩笑
- You guys can't be serious!

1046
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:28,510
你只是小孩子，他是个大疯子
You're just a kid, and he's, like, a mental case.

1047
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:30,910
你们会流落街头
You'll end up living in a box on the street.

1048
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,540
我不比你小
l'm no more a kid than you are! 

1049
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:34,720
我们可以用我的钱
We can use my plastic surgery money.

1050
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:37,510
不必，我有四万块
We won't have to. l have over $40,000.

1051
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,650
我在纽约有朋友帮忙
l know people in the city that can help us.

1052
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,190
别的毒贩吗？
- What, other drug dealers? 

1053
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:42,060
对
- Yes.

1054
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:44,530
你疯了才会跟他走
Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go with him.

1055
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:45,990
你管我干嘛？
- Why do you even care? 

1056
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:47,470
我是你朋友
- Because you're my friend!

1057
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:51,440
她不是你朋友 她只是利用你来满足自己的优越感
She's not your friend. She's someone you use to feel better about yourself.

1058
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,360
去死吧，疯子
- Go fuck yourself, psycho! 

1059
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:54,870
闭嘴，贱人
- Shut up, bitch!

1060
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,200
他是个怪胎
- Jane! He's a freak! 

1061
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,930
我也是
- Well, then so am l!

1062
01:37:58,210 --> 01:38:01,340
我们是怪胎，永远不能像你
And we'll always be freaks, and we'll never be like other people.

1063
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:05,040
你很完美，永远不会是怪胎
And you'll never be a freak 'cause you're just too perfect!

1064
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:09,480
至少我不丑
Yeah, well, at least l'm not ugly.

1065
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:13,220
你很丑陋
Yes, you are.

1066
01:38:13,730 --> 01:38:17,190
你也很无趣，而且你很平凡
And you're boring. And you're totally ordinary.

1067
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:19,990
你很清楚
And you know it.

1068
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,270
你们俩是天生一对
You two deserve each other.

1069
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,100
老天，你都湿透了
Jesus, man, you're soaked!

1070
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:40,400
你找芮奇？他在小珍房间
You want me to get Ricky? He's in Jane's room.

1071
01:39:43,450 --> 01:39:44,750
你还好吧？
Are you OK?

1072
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:47,350
你太太呢？
Where's your wife?

1073
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,490
不知道
l don't know.

1074
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,490
大概在跟仲介王上床吧
Probably out fucking that dorky prince-of-real-estate asshole.

1075
01:39:56,630 --> 01:39:57,930
你知道吗？
And you know what?

1076
01:39:59,830 --> 01:40:00,960
我不在乎
l don't care.

1077
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:14,480
你太太跟别的男人上床
Your wife is with another man 

1078
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:16,280
你却不在乎？
and you don't care?

1079
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:20,180
对
Nope.

1080
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,510
我们的婚姻只是个幌子
Our marriage is just for show.

1081
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:27,490
为了表示我们很正常
A commercial for how normal we are

1082
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:29,290
其实根本就不是
when we're anything but.

1083
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,230
老天，你在发抖
Jesus, man, you are shaking.

1084
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:42,540
你最好把衣服脱掉
We really ought to get you out of these clothes.

1085
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:44,840
是啊
Yeah.

1086
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:48,100
不会有事
lt's OK.

1087
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:53,750
我…
l am...

1088
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,720
告诉我你需要什么
You just tell me what you need.

1089
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,650
没事了
lt's OK.

1090
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:26,580
对不起
l'm sorry.

1091
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:29,850
你误解了
You got the wrong idea.

1092
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,730
我拒绝当弱者
"l refuse to be a victim."

1093
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,460
把这句话当成座右铭勉励自己
When this becomes your mantra, constantly reinforcing your...

1094
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:21,430
我拒绝当弱者
l refuse to be a victim!

1095
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,450
你不介意我开音响吧？
l hope you don't mind if l play the stereo.

1096
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:09,350
不介意
Not at all.

1097
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:12,550
心情不好
Bad night?

1098
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:14,990
不是不好，只是…
Not really bad. Just...

1099
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:17,730
很奇怪
...strange.

1100
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:22,860
相信我，我碰到的事更奇怪
Believe me, it couldn't possibly be any stranger than mine.

1101
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:33,370
我跟小珍吵架
Jane and l had a fight.

1102
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:36,580
是为了你
lt was about you.

1103
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:41,010
她在生我的气，因为…
She's mad at me because...

1104
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:44,680
我说你很性感
...l said l think you're sexy.

1105
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:48,850
你要喝一口吗？
- Do you want a sip? 

1106
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:51,420
好
- Sure.

1107
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,490
那…
So...

1108
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:25,890
你要不要告诉我
...are you going to tell me?

1109
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:30,900
你想要什么？
What do you want?

1110
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,530
我不知道
l don't know.

1111
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:42,080
你…不知道
You... don't know.

1112
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,550
你要什么？
What do you want?

1113
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,210
别装蒜
Are you kidding?

1114
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:51,520
我要你
l want you.

1115
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:59,220
我一见到你就想要你
l've wanted you since the first moment l saw you.

1116
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:04,970
你是我见过最美的东西
You are the most beautiful thing l have ever seen.

1117
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,170
你不觉得我很平凡？
You don't think l'm ordinary?

1118
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,980
你一点都不平凡
You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.

1119
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:25,820
谢谢你
Thank you.

1120
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:30,990
我觉得当平凡人是最糟的事
l don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary.

1121
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:55,490
我拒绝当弱者…
l refuse to be a victim. l refuse to be a victim.

1122
01:45:56,020 --> 01:46:00,320
我有话要对你说
Lester... l have something l have to say to you.

1123
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:51,940
你害怕吗？
Are you scared?

1124
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:54,900
我不会害怕
l don't get scared.

1125
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:00,340
我爸妈会找我
My parents will try to find me.

1126
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:02,390
我爸妈不会
Mine won't.

1127
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:26,040
我还是处女
This is my first time.

1128
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:31,140
别开玩笑
You're kidding.

1129
01:47:32,090 --> 01:47:33,520
对不起
l'm sorry.

1130
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:36,280
我还是想
l still want to do it.

1131
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:38,350
只是…
l just...

1132
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:40,050
我想先说
...thought l should tell you, 

1133
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:45,290
免得你觉得我…不够好
in case you wondered why l wasn't... better.

1134
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,840
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1135
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:08,950
你不是说我很美吗？
l thought you said l was beautiful.

1136
01:48:10,890 --> 01:48:12,410
你是很美
You are beautiful.

1137
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:17,400
你是这么地美
You are so...

1138
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,190
你是这么地美
...beautiful.

1139
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:26,840
我会是…最幸运的男人
And l would be a very... lucky man.

1140
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:30,470
我觉得自己好蠢
l feel so stupid.

1141
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,200
别这样
Don't.

1142
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:36,040
对不起
l'm sorry.

1143
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,550
你不必道歉
You have nothing to be sorry about.

1144
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:42,150
没关S
lt's OK.

1145
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:45,520
一切都没事了
Everything's OK.

1146
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:04,300
我刚才好饿
Wow. l was starving.

1147
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:07,250
你要再吃吗？
- Do you want me to make another one?

1148
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:09,270
不了，我饱了
- No, l'm fine.

1149
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:10,670
真的吗？
You sure?

1150
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:15,780
我还是有点怕，不过好多了
l'm still a little weirded out, but l feel better.

1151
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:16,990
谢了
Thanks.

1152
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:21,620
小珍好吗？
How's Jane?

1153
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:24,050
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1154
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,890
我是说…
l mean...

1155
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:29,430
她过得好吗？
...how's her life?

1156
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:32,100
她快乐吗？
ls she happy?

1157
01:49:32,870 --> 01:49:34,340
悲伤吗？
ls she miserable?

1158
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:40,410
我很想知道 她死也不肯告诉我
l'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it.

1159
01:49:43,550 --> 01:49:48,380
她真的很快乐
She's... she is really happy.

1160
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,280
她觉得自己在谈恋爱
She thinks she's in love.

1161
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:04,970
那很好
Good for her.

1162
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:10,630
你好不好？
How are you?

1163
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:21,380
好久都没有人这么问我
lt's been a long time since anybody asked me that.

1164
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:29,820
我好极了
l'm great.

1165
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:38,500
我得去上厕所
l've got to go to the bathroom.

1166
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:53,940
我好极了
l'm great.

1167
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:31,050
老天爷
Man, oh, man.

1168
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:37,230
老天爷！
Man, oh, man, oh, man.

1169
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:14,770
天啊
Oh, my God!

1170
01:53:00,610 --> 01:53:03,910
听说人在死前的一秒钟
l had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes

1171
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:06,040
他的一生会闪过眼前
the second before you die.

1172
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:08,580
首先
First of all...

1173
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:12,550
其实不是一秒钟
...that one second isn't a second at all.

1174
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:17,590
而是延伸成无止尽的时间
lt stretches on forever, like an ocean of time.

1175
01:53:20,130 --> 01:53:24,470
对我来说我的一生是躺在草地
For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp

1176
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:26,970
看着流星雨
watching falling stars.

1177
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:40,510
还有街道上枯黄的枫叶
And yellow leaves from the maple trees that lined our street.

1178
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:55,330
或是奶奶手上像纸一样的皮肤
Or my grandmother's hands and the way her skin seemed like paper.

1179
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:06,400
还有我第一次看到东尼表哥
And the first time l saw my cousin Tony's

1180
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:09,580
那辆全新的火鸟跑车
brand-new Firebird.

1181
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:22,620
还有小珍
And Janie.

1182
01:54:24,930 --> 01:54:26,020
小珍

1183
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,790
还有卡洛琳
And Carolyn.

1184
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:09,540
我猜我死了应该生气才对
l guess l could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me,

1185
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:14,340
但世界这么美，不该一直生气
but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world.

1186
01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:20,210
有时候一次看完会无法承受
Sometimes l feel like l'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much.

1187
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:24,380
我的心像涨满的汽球随时会爆炸
My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst.

1188
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:29,250
后来我记得要放轻松
And then l remember to relax

1189
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:32,750
别一直想要紧抓着不放
and stop trying to hold on to it.

1190
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:36,430
所有的美就像雨水一样洗涤我
And then it flows through me like rain

1191
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:40,440
让我对我这卑微愚蠢的生命
and l can't feel anything but gratitude

1192
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:45,470
在每一刻都充满了感激
for every single moment of my stupid little life.

1193
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:49,980
你一定不知道我在说什么
You have no idea what l'm talking about, l'm sure.

1194
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:52,310
别担心
But don't worry.

1195
01:55:53,690 --> 01:55:55,150
有一天你会明白
You will someday.
