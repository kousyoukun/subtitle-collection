1
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:34,926
我要一个模范父亲
I need a father who's a role model,
not some horny geek boy...

2
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:41,397
不是一个看到漂亮美眉
就流口水的色鬼老爸
who's going to spray his shorts whenever
I bring a girlfriend home from school.

3
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,370
他逊毙了
What a lame-o.

4
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:51,043
有人应该把他杀死算了
Someone really should just put him
out of his misery.

5
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:55,576
要我干掉他吗？
[ Boy ]
You want me to kill him for you ?

6
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,319
好，你肯吗？
Yeah. Would you ?

7
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:12,267
片名：美国心，玫瑰情
[ Shutter Whirring,
Clicking Off ]

8
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:21,843
我叫赖斯特班宁
[ Man Narrating ]
My name is Lester Burnham.

9
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,078
这是我的家乡
This is my neighborhood.

10
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,246
这是我的街道
This is my street.

11
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:31,283
这是我的一生
This is my life.

12
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:36,650
我今年42岁
一年之内我就会死
I'm 42 years old.
In less than a year, I'll be dead.

13
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:47,026
当然，现在我还不知道
Of course,
I don't know that yet.

14
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:54,066
不过老实说，我的心早就死了
And in a way,
I'm dead already.

15
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:05,815
看看我
Look at me:

16
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:08,222
躲在浴室打手枪
jerking off in the shower.

17
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:14,855
这算是我唯一的高潮
之后就每况愈下
This will be the high point of my day.
It's all downhill from here.

18
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:22,037
我老婆，卡洛琳
That's my wife, Carolyn.

19
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,977
你看她的剪刀跟鞋子
颜色搭配得多好
See the way the handle on those pruning
shears matches her gardening clogs ?

20
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,137
这不是巧合
- That's not an accident.
-[ Dog Barking ]

21
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:32,141
小不点，别乱叫
[ Man ]
Hush, Bitsy!

22
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:35,207
你是怎么了？
- Hush. What is wrong with you ?

23
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:37,276
我们的邻居，吉姆
- That's our next-door neighbor,Jim.

24
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:39,945
他的爱人
-And that's his lover,
-[ Both Arguing ]

25
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:41,555
也叫吉姆
Jim.

26
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,026
你把它宠坏了
别乱叫，进来
- You spoil her.
Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.
- Me ?

27
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:48,055
早安，吉姆
- Come on. Yes. Inside.
-[ Carolyn ] Good morning,Jim !

28
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,289
早，卡洛琳
Good morning, Carolyn.

29
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:54,599
你的领带好帅，颜色很棒
I love your tie !
That color !

30
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:58,972
你的玫瑰好漂亮
怎么会开得这么好？
I just love your roses. How do you
get them to flourish like this ?

31
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:02,906
我跟你说
蛋壳和肥料双管齐下
Well, I'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

32
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,912
我没听过这一招
-I've never heard that.

33
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:07,576
我看到她就累
-Man, I get exhausted just watching her.

34
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:11,713
她以前不是这样
她曾经快乐过
She wasn't always like this.
She used to be happy.

35
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:15,748
我们曾经快乐过
We used to be happy.

36
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:21,753
我女儿，小珍
我们的独女
My daughterJane.
Only child.

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,233
“隆乳”

38
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:27,436
小珍是典型的新新人类
-Janie's a pretty typical teenager:
-[ Computer Beeps ]

39
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,198
愤世嫉俗、厢迕曰
angry, insecure, confused.

40
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,443
我很想告诉她明天会更好
I wish I could tell her that's all going
to pass,

41
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:36,803
可是我不想说谎
 but I don't want to lie to her.

42
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:44,316
小珍，你想扮成丑小鸭吗？
Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive ?

43
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:45,752
对
- Yes.

44
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,422
恭喜哦，你扮得很像
- Congratulations.
You've succeeded admirably.

45
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:53,120
老公，你能再慢一点吗？
因为我可以晚一点上班哦
Lester, could you make me
a little later, please,
because I'm not quite late enough.

46
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:58,260
老爸，你真行
Nice going, Dad.

47
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:03,061
我的妻女都觉得我很失败
[ Lester Narrating ] Both my wife and
daughter think I'm this gigantic loser.

48
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:05,031
她们没错
And they're right.

49
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:09,577
我失去了什么
I have lost something.

50
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,747
我不知道是什么
I'm not exactly sure
what it is,

51
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:15,312
我只知道过去我没有...
but I know
I didn't always feel this...

52
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,914
这么死气沉沉
sedated.

53
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:20,348
不过你知道吗？
But you know what ?

54
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:24,453
想要重振雄风永远不嫌晚
It's never too late
to get it back.

55
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:32,259
这是“媒体月刊”的赖斯特
请找谭先生
Hello. This is Lester Burnham
from Media Monthly magazine.
I'm calling
for Mr. Tamblin, please.

56
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:34,861
截稿日期已经到了
Well, we're all under
a deadline here. You see,
there's some basic information...

57
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:40,443
贵公司的新产品还缺一些资料
about your product launch
that isn't even covered
in your press release, and I'd--

58
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:43,379
对...我想问一下
Yeah, c--
can I ask you a question ?

59
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,779
到底有没有谭先生这个人？
Who is Tamblin ? Does he exist ?

60
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,612
因为他从来不上班
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.

61
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:50,846
好吧，我留下电话号码
Yeah. Okay.
I'll leave my number.

62
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:55,354
555一0199
It's 555-0 1 99.

63
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:57,483
赖斯特班宁
Lester Burnham.

64
00:04:57,728 --> 00:04:58,717
谢谢
Thank you !

65
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:01,631
赖斯
Hey, Les.

66
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,564
借用你一分钟
You got a minute ?

67
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,495
你要借用五分钟都行
For you, Brad,
I got five !

68
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:12,837
你知道公司必须裁减支出
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.

69
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:13,906
当然了
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.

70
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:19,174
景气不好，你得另找财路
想赚钱就得先花钱
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.

71
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,574
没错
- Right ?
- Exactly.

72
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:25,782
就像主编刷公司的信用卡召妓
Like the time that Mr. Flournoy
used the company MasterCard
to pay for that hooker,

73
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:29,757
结果被她盗用花了一大笔钱
and she used the card numbers
and stayed at the St. Regis for,
what was it, three months ?

74
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,919
那只是个谣言
那是五万元
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000.
That's somebody's salary.

75
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:37,157
他乱花公司的钱
现在却要炒员工鱿鱼
That's somebody who's going
to get fired because Craig
has to pay women to fuck him !

76
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:39,136
老天，冷静点
Jesus!

77
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:42,867
还没有人被炒鱿鱼
I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.

78
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:50,040
我只是请大家写份报告
谈谈你们对公司有何贡献
- [ Scoffs ]
- That's why we're having everyone...
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.

79
00:05:50,147 --> 00:05:56,581
这样上头才知道谁可以用
谁可以卷铺盖走路
That way management
can assess who's valuable--
And who's expendable.

80
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,311
我只是公事公办
It's just business.

81
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:06,991
我在公司待了十四年
你才来了一个月
我可是好人耶
I've been writing
for this magazine for 1 4 years.
- You've been here how long ?
A whole month ?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.

82
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:09,365
我在替你着想
I'm trying to level with you.

83
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:13,403
这是你保住饭碗的机会
This is your one chance
to save your job.

84
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,764
别想了，快写吧
[ Carolyn ] There is no decision.
You just write the damn thing.

85
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:20,605
你不觉得这很独裁吗？
- [ Lester] You don't think
it's weird and kind of fascist ?
- Possibly.

86
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,201
也许吧，不过你不能失业
- But you don't want to be unemployed.
- All right.

87
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,840
所以我就得跟魔鬼交易吗？
Let's just all sell our souls
and work for Satan 'cause
it's more convenient that way.

88
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,476
你也未免太夸张了一点
Oh, could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please, huh ?

89
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:31,187
终于来了新邻居
So, we finally
got new neighbors.

90
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:38,518
要是罗家把房子交给我处理
就不会等了半年才脱手
You know, if the Lomans
had let me represent them
instead of the Real Estate King,
that house would never
have sat on the market for six months.

91
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:41,223
谁叫你砍掉他们的树
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.

92
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:43,097
他们的树？
Their sycamore ?
Come on.

93
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:46,770
树根有一大半长在我们家
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.

94
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,905
怎么会是他们的树？
You know that.
How can you call it their sycamore ?

95
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:54,910
是我的树我才会把它砍掉
I wouldn't have the heart to just cut
down something if it wasn't partially
mine, which, of course, it was.

96
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,241
? Bali Ha'i ?

97
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:04,048
? They call you ??

98
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:09,149
我们一定要听这种轻音乐吗？
-?? [ Continues, Indistinct ]
- Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music ?

99
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:12,854
不一定
No. No, we don't.

100
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:19,969
只要你煮一顿美味可口的晚餐
你想听什么都行
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that I'm about to eat,
you can listen
to whatever you like.

101
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:26,074
小珍，学校好吗？
So,Janie, how was school ?

102
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:28,772
还好
It was okay.

103
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:30,979
只是还好？
Just okay ?

104
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:35,643
不是，学校棒呆了
No, Dad.
It was spectacular.

105
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:41,454
你想知道我的工作怎样吗？
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today ?

106
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,593
公司请来一个效率专家
They've hired
this efficiency expert,

107
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:47,297
名字叫布莱德，有够呛
this really friendly guy
named Brad--

108
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:51,825
他其实是负责开除员工的
How perfect is that ?
And he's basically there
to make it seem they're justified...

109
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:57,941
只是他们不敢明讲
他们太阴险了
in firing somebody,
because they couldn't just come
out and say that, could they ?
No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us--

110
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:01,308
所以我们就得...
你根本就不在乎
[ Chuckling ] You couldn't
possibly care less, could you ?

111
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,471
你想怎样？
What do you expect ?

112
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:08,279
我们不可能突然就父女情深
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.

113
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:14,387
拜托，你好久没跟我聊天了
I mean, hello, you've barely even
spoken to me for months.

114
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:27,298
难道你是模范母亲吗？
你把她当成员工
什么？
Oh, what ?
You're '' Mother of the Year'' ?
- [ Muttering ]
You treat her like an employee.
- What ?

115
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,829
你说什么？
[ Shouts ]
What ?

116
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,735
我要去吃冰淇淋
I'm going
to get some ice cream.

117
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:47,414
小珍，很抱歉
Janie...

118
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:53,825
我没有...多陪陪你
I'm sorry I haven't
been more available.
I'm just-- I--

119
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,201
你不必等我来找你呀
You know, you don't always
have to wait for me to come to you.

120
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:03,235
棒呆了，原来是我的错
Oh, great.
So now it's my fault ?

121
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,935
这不是谁的错
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It--

122
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,444
到底是怎么回事？
Janie, what happened ?

123
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:11,171
从前我们无话不谈
We used to be pals.

00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:42,330
“仲介王巴迪坎恩”

127
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:53,912
今天我会卖掉这栋房子
I will sell this house today.

128
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:09,497
我会卖掉这栋房子...
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.

129
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:26,244
今天我会卖掉这栋房子
I will sell this house today.

130
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:37,219
欢迎光临，我是卡洛琳班宁
Welcome.
I'm Carolyn Burnham.

131
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,052
这间客厅很气派
This living room
is very dramatic.

132
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,426
壁炉是用上好石材砌成的
Wait till you see
the native stone fireplace!

133
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,803
粉刷一下保证焕然一新
装个天窗更棒
A simple cream could
really lighten things up.
You could even put in a skylight.

134
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:53,742
我们去看看厨房
Well, why don't we
go into the kitchen ?

135
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:56,543
简直就是美食家乐园
It's a dream come true
for any cook.

136
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,678
每个人都能当食神
Just filled
with positive energy, huh ?

137
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,645
电吊扇可以省下一大笔电费
And you'll be surprised
how much a ceiling fan can
cut down on your energy costs.

138
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,096
后院可以举行很棒的烤肉大会
You know,you could have some fun
backyard get-togethers out here.

139
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:18,066
广告说泳池很像蓝色珊瑚礁
这一点也不像
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like.
There's nothing lagoon-like about it.

140
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:21,966
只有一大堆蚊子
连花草都没有
Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any plants out here.

141
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:25,036
这些呢？这不是花草吗？
What do you call this ?
Is this not a plant ?

142
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:28,511
你们要花草我就找园丁来
一次搞定
If you have a problem with the plants, I
can always call my landscape architect.

143
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:33,213
珊瑚礁应该有热带风味
- Solved.
- I mean, I think ''lagoon,''
I think waterfall, tropical.

144
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:36,184
这只是个水泥坑
This is a cement hole.

145
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,823
车库里有火把
I have some tiki torches
in the garage.

146
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:17,552
别哭了！别哭，爱哭鬼
Shut up ! Stop it !
You weak-- You baby !

147
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:21,119
别哭了！别哭...
Shut up ! Shut up !
Shut up !

148
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:07,740
你在找谁？
Who are you looking for ?

149
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:10,003
我爸妈说要来
My parents are coming tonight.

150
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:14,476
他们想要开始多关心我
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.

151
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:17,142
恶心，我最恨我老妈这样
Gross. I hate it
when my mom does that.

152
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:21,590
真是无聊透顶
他们关心自己就好了
They're such assholes. Why can't
they just have their own lives ?

153
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:28,693
她有说要我们去看她吗？
[ Lester]
What makes you sure she wants us
to be there ? Did she ask us to come ?

154
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:32,265
没有，不过这对她很重要
Of course not. She doesn't want us
to know how important this is to her.

155
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:34,394
她练习了好几个礼拜
But she's been practicing
for weeks.

156
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,233
她一定会恨我们
I'll bet she's going to
resent it, 

157
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,831
我也错过第四台的电影
and I'm missing
theJames Bond marathon on T.N.T.

158
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,899
老公，这很重要耶
Lester, this is important.

159
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:44,003
我觉得你跟小珍渐渐疏远了
I'm sensing a real distance
growing between you and Jane.

160
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,674
疏远？她讨厌我
''Growing'' ?
She hates me.

161
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:48,578
她只是个性倔强
- She's just willful.

162
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:50,175
她也讨厌你
- She hates you too.

163
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:01,822
- Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.

164
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:04,389
-[ Buzzer Sounding ]
- Hi ! Patty !

165
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:11,837
今晚半场的精采表演
声名远播的洛威高中啦啦队
[ Announcer Over P.A.]
Now, for your halftime entertainment,
Rockwell High's award-winning
Dancing Spartanettes!

166
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:14,276
看完了就能走吧？
We can leave
right after this, right ?

167
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:30,574
雪特！他们没走
Shit. They're still here.

168
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,010
我很喜欢你的表演
Janie !
Hey, I really enjoyed that.

169
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:37,245
恭喜，你很棒
-Congratulations, honey. You were great.

170
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,252
我又没赢什么
-I didn't win anything.

171
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,084
我是小珍的爸爸赖斯特
- Hi. I'm Lester,Janie's dad.

172
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:42,022
哦，你好
- Oh, hi.

173
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:47,253
我的死党安琪拉海瑟
This is my friend,
Angela Hayes.

174
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:50,622
很好，幸会了
Okay. Good to meet you.

175
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:53,758
你的表演也很棒...
You were also good tonight,

176
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:56,103
很精准
very... precise.

177
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:57,265
谢了
- Thanks.

178
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,108
幸会了，安琪拉！小珍
- Nice to meet you, Angela.

179
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:05,711
我以你为荣，我有仔细看
你没有跳错
Honey-- [ Grunts ]
I am so proud of you.
You know, I watched you very closely.
You didn't screw up once.

180
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:09,579
我们得走了
Okay, uh, we have to go.

181
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:11,211
你们要去哪儿？
- So what are you girls doing now ?

182
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:12,652
爸
- Dad.

183
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:14,384
我们要去吃披萨
- We're going out for pizza.
- Really ? Do you need a ride ?
We can give you a ride.

184
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:19,722
我有车，要我载一程吗？
谢了，我也有车
- I have a car.
You want to come with us ?
- Thanks, but I have a car.

185
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:23,323
你有车，太好了
You have a car.
That's great. That's great.

186
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:26,630
最近小珍也想买车
对吧，小珍？
Janie's thinking about
getting a car, too, soon, aren't you ?

187
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:28,966
妈在等你
Dad, Mom's waiting for you.

188
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,669
很高兴认识你
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Angela.

189
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:37,213
只要是小珍的朋友
Any friend ofJanie's...

190
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:41,707
就是我的朋友
is a... friend of mine.
[ Exhales ]

191
00:18:44,987 --> 00:18:48,889
回头见
Well... I'll be
seeing you around, then.

192
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:57,326
他实在是有够逊了
Could he be any more...
pathetic ?

193
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,397
他很可爱呀
I think he's sweet.

194
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:04,905
他跟你妈一定很久没搞过了
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.

195
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:24,125
很奇怪
[ Lester Narrating ]
It's the weirdest thing.

196
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:28,695
我好像昏睡了二十年
I feel like I've been in a coma
for about 20 years...

197
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,195
现在终于苏醒
and I'm just now waking up.

198
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,594
棒呆了
Spec-tacular.

199
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,011
抱歉我老爸刚才那么猪哥
I'm so sorry
my dad was weird tonight.

200
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:21,083
没关系
That's okay.

201
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:24,177
男人都会对我流口水
I'm used to guys
drooling over me.

202
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:27,885
我十二岁起就这样
It started
when I was about 1 2.

203
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:31,052
我跟爸妈上馆子
I'd go to dinner
with my parents.

204
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,888
星期四都到红龙虾餐馆
Every Thursday night: Red Lobster.
[ Chuckles ]

205
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:39,527
每个男人都盯着我看
他们只有一个念头
Every guy there would stare at me
when I walked in.
And I knew
what they were thinking,

206
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:42,399
就像男同学打手枪都在想我
just like I knew guys at school thought
about me when they jerked off.

207
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:44,595
好恶心
- Vomit.
- No. I liked it.

208
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:51,144
不会，我喜欢，现在也是
当男人看到我就想跟我上床
I still like it. If people I don't even
know look at me and want to fuck me,

209
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:54,910
这代表我能当模特儿
it means I really have a shot
at being a model.

210
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:57,247
这样很棒
Which is great,

211
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,757
因为当平凡人是最惨的
because there's nothing worse in life
than being ordinary.

212
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,392
你一定能成功
I really think
it'll happen for you.

213
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:10,622
我知道
I know.

214
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:16,467
因为一个人命中注定的事
一定会发生
Because everything that was meant
to happen, does... eventually.

215
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:43,421
讨厌
Asshole.

216
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,941
“安琪拉海瑟”

217
00:22:48,597 --> 00:22:50,326
喂
[ Angela ]
Hello ? 

218
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,692
喂？
Hello ?

219
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:10,378
你打给我干嘛？
- Hello ?
- Why'd you call me ?

220
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:11,842
没有啊
I didn't.

221
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:15,283
我一接电话就被挂断
Well, my phone just rang and
I answered it, and somebody hung up.

222
00:23:15,357 --> 00:23:17,257
自动查号发现是你
- And I star-69ed,
and I called you back.

223
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:19,257
我刚才在洗澡
- Well, I was in the shower.

224
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:25,833
好恶心
Oh, gross !

225
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,116
芮奇，来吃早饭
[ Woman ]
Ricky! Breakfast!

226
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:47,884
马上来
Be right there.

227
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,564
妈
- Mom.
- Hello.

228
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,893
我不吃培根
I don't eat bacon, remember ?

229
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:04,537
对不起，我忘了
I'm sorry.
I must've forgotten.

230
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:17,979
爸，有什么新闻？
What's new in the world, Dad ?

231
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:22,385
这国家就快完蛋了
This country
is going straight to hell.

232
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,497
你在等人吗？      没有
- Are you expecting anyone ?
- No.

233
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:37,800
没有啊
No.

234
00:24:45,347 --> 00:24:47,372
欢迎搬来这个社区
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

235
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:48,939
咱们后院种的
- It's just a little something
from our garden.
- Except for the pasta.

236
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:51,248
意大利面是美食店买的
- We got that at Fallaci's.
- Right. It's unbelievably fresh.

237
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:54,479
新鲜得不得了
丢进滚水一烫就熟
You just-- You drop it
in the water, and it's done.

238
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:57,751
吉姆欧麦尔
Jim Olmeyer. 

239
00:24:57,826 --> 00:24:59,919
你的邻居，欢迎你们
Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

240
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:02,361
海军陆战队法兰克费兹中校
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.

241
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,565
幸会，他是我伙伴
- It's nice to meet you.
This is my partner--

242
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,032
吉姆巴克莱，小名JB
-Jim Berkley, but call meJ.B.

243
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,193
废话少说
Let's cut to chase, okay ?

244
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:09,396
你们想推销什么？
What are you guys selling ?

245
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:13,607
没有，我们只是打声招呼
- [ Chuckles ] We--
- Nothing. We just wanted to
say hi to our new neighbors.

246
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:19,171
才怪，你们是伙伴
你们是做什么的？
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you're
partners, so what's your business ?

247
00:25:20,816 --> 00:25:22,010
嗯...
Well... 

248
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:24,819
他是税务律师
he is a tax attorney.

249
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,783
他是麻醉师
And he's an anesthesiologist.

250
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:40,568
这些臭同志老爱骚扰别人
How come these faggots
always have to rub it in your face ?

251
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:44,469
他们怎么会这么无耻？
How can they
be so shameless ?

252
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:52,277
重点是他们不觉得这很无耻
- yy [ Resumes Humming ]
- That's the whole thing, Dad.
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.

253
00:25:53,415 --> 00:25:55,383
无耻透顶
Well, it is.

254
00:25:57,553 --> 00:25:58,542
你说得对
- Yeah, you're right.

255
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:01,912
别把我当你妈一样哄
- Don't placate me
like I'm your mother, boy.

256
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:07,758
请恕我有话直说
Forgive me, sir,
for speaking so bluntly,

257
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:10,727
那些臭同志真是令我作呕
but those fags make me want
to puke my fucking guts out.

258
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:20,039
我有同感，儿子
Well, me too, son.

259
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:22,939
我有同感
Yeah. Me too.

260
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:32,882
是真的，他就把那话儿掏出来
[ Angela ] I'm serious. He just
pulled down his pants and yanked it out.

261
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:35,480
然后说，来见我小弟弟
- You know, like,
"Say hello to Mr. Happy. "

262
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:36,546
好恶心
- Gross !

263
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:39,861
才不会，挺酷的
- It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.

264
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:41,428
你跟他做了吗？
- So did you do it with him ?

265
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:42,828
当然了
Of course. 

266
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,757
他是有名的摄影师
He's a really
well-known photographer.

267
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:48,698
经常替超级名模拍照
He shoots for Elle on,
like, a regular basis.

268
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:51,365
拒绝他就未免太猪头了
- It would've been majorly stupid
of me to turn him down.

269
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,574
你就像个妓女
- You are a total prostitute.

270
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:57,740
这才是现实社会
Hey, that's how
things really are.

271
00:26:57,946 --> 00:27:01,575
你只是个被宠坏的娇娇女
You just don't know because you're
this pampered little suburban chick.

272
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:02,773
你也是
So are you.

273
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,376
你上过一次杂志，而且很肥
 You've only been
in Seventeen once, and you looked fat.

274
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:08,582
别以为自己是超级名模
So stop acting like you're
goddamn Christy Turlington !

275
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,649
婊子
Cunt !

276
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:18,399
我最恨别人嫉妒我就乱骂人
I am so sick of people
taking their insecurities out on me.

277
00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:21,096
我的天
- Oh, my God. 

278
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:23,669
他是昨晚偷拍我的变态
That's the pervert
who filmed me last night.

279
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:24,398
他？
- Him ?

280
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,506
不可能，他是个疯子
Jane. No way.
He's a total lunatic.

281
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,774
你认识他？
- Do you know him ?
- Yeah.

282
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,871
是啊，国三我跟他同校
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade,

283
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:35,439
他老是乱说一些奇怪的话
and he would always save
the most random, weird things.

284
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:39,351
有一天他突然消失不见
And then one day,
he was just, like, gone.

285
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,080
然后...
And then 

286
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:45,783
康妮说他被父母关进疯人院
Connie Cardullo told me
that his parents had to put him
in a mental institution.

287
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:48,023
他做了什么？
Why ? What did he do ?

288
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:49,986
什么意思？
What do you mean ?

289
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:54,527
乱说话又不会被关进疯人院
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.

290
00:27:57,506 --> 00:28:00,805
你这个小骚包
You total slut.
You've got a crush on him.

291
00:28:01,677 --> 00:28:04,113
你在暗恋他
什么？拜托
- What ? Please !
- You are defending him. You love him.

292
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:08,980
你爱上他才替他说话
你想要生他的小孩
闭嘴
- You want to have, like,
1 0,000 of his babies.
- Shut up.

293
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:13,351
我叫芮奇，刚搬到你家隔壁
Hi. My name's Ricky.
I just moved next door to you.

294
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:14,889
我知道
I know.

295
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:20,195
昨晚你很变态，一直偷拍我
I kind of remember this creepy incident
where you were filming me last night ?

296
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:22,959
我不想吓你，只是你很有意思
- I didn't mean to scare you.
I just think you're interesting.

297
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:24,160
谢了
- Thanks.

298
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:28,168
不过我不想让变态狂迷上我
But I really don't need to have some
psycho obsessing about me right now.

299
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:30,865
我不是迷上你
I'm not obsessing.

300
00:28:31,506 --> 00:28:32,837
只是对你很好奇
I'm just curious.

301
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,052
大怪胎
What a freak.

302
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:53,293
他活像个摩门教徒
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman ?

303
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:57,191
他好有自信心
He's, like, so confident.

304
00:28:58,066 --> 00:28:59,499
不可思议
That can't be real.

305
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:02,564
我不敢相信
I don't believe him.

306
00:29:03,438 --> 00:29:06,601
他连看都没看我一眼
I mean, he didn't even,
like, look at me once.

307
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,813
你为什么入伍？
- How'd you get in the Army?

308
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:16,440
教官，我有三个理由
-Sergeant, I got three reasons
for being in the Army.

309
00:29:16,851 --> 00:29:19,376
第一，我忠贞，第二，我爱国
First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love
my country. 

310
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:20,546
第三，我收到征召令
And third, they nailed me.

311
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:25,788
解散后马上向我报到
[ TVChatter Continues ]

312
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:27,322
把他们带走
[ Lock Rattling ]

313
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:42,006
这是怎么回事？
- What's going on here ?

314
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:43,703
趴低点，魔鬼教官来了
- Bend all the way down.
Here comes the Bull of the Woods.

315
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:47,808
你说什么？
I'm sorry. What ?

316
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:51,980
没有人说话
Mom, nobody said anything.

317
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,313
对不起
Oh. I'm sorry.

318
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,798
大家都携伴参加
要不然会惹人闲话
Everyone here is with their spouse
or significant other.

319
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:07,227
你一定会跑去跟别人聊天
- How would it look
if I showed up with no one ?
- You always end up ignoring me.

320
00:30:07,302 --> 00:30:10,396
听我说，这是重要的应酬
Now, listen to me.
This is an important business function.

321
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:16,205
卖房子就像是贩卖形象
我必须维持好形象
As you know, my business
is selling an image,
and part of my job
is to live that image.

322
00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:17,642
老婆，帮帮忙
Honey, do me a favor

323
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:20,748
废话少说，别跟我来这一套
好吧
 and say
whatever you want to say
and spare me the propaganda.All right.

324
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:23,649
嗨，雪莉
Hi, Shirley !

325
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:28,053
帮个忙，装开心点
Listen. Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.

326
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:29,349
我很开心呀
- [ High Voice ] I am happy, honey !

327
00:30:29,424 --> 00:30:30,755
才怪
- You're not

328
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:32,892
是巴迪
-- Oh, that's Buddy !

329
00:30:33,428 --> 00:30:34,417
巴迪
- Buddy!

330
00:30:34,796 --> 00:30:36,559
巴迪...
 Buddy! Hi!
- Hi.

331
00:30:36,598 --> 00:30:39,122
很高兴再见到你
Good to see you again.

332
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,658
我也是，卡瑟琳
卡洛琳
-It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
-Carolyn.

333
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:45,704
没错，你好吗？
Oh, Carolyn ! Of course.
How are you ?

334
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:47,268
很好，谢谢
- Very well, thank you. 

335
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:49,734
你好，克莉丝
你好
Hello, Christy.
- Hello.

336
00:30:51,312 --> 00:30:52,711
我老公，赖斯特
- My husband, Lester.

337
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:53,879
幸会
- It's a pleasure.

338
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:58,976
去年我们在圣诞节晚会见过
Oh, we've met before,
actually. This thing last year.
Christmas at the Sheraton.

339
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:00,950
是啊
Oh, yeah !

340
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:04,548
没关系，连我也不会记得我
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.

341
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:10,191
老公，别乱讲话
Honey, don't be weird.

342
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,993
好吧，我不乱讲话
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.

343
00:31:14,135 --> 00:31:17,332
你要我怎样我就怎样
I'll be whatever
you want me to be.

344
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,548
我们的关系很好
- We have a very healthy relationship.

345
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:33,379
是啊
- I see.

346
00:31:37,191 --> 00:31:39,625
你们聊，我去喝酒
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.

347
00:31:46,634 --> 00:31:48,397
多倒点，老兄
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Put a little more in there, cowboy.

348
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:05,744
对不起
Excuse me.

349
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:09,924
你住在罗宾汉街的红门房子
 Don't you live on Robin Hood
Trail? The house with the red door?

350
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:11,623
对
- Yeah.

351
00:32:12,393 --> 00:32:14,918
我是芮奇，刚搬到你家隔壁
- I'm Ricky Fitts.
I just moved in the house next to you.

352
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:19,123
嗨，我是赖斯特班宁
Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts.
I'm Lester Burnham.

353
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:22,133
你好，班先生
Hi, Lester Burnham.

354
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,069
你哈不哈草？
- Do you party ?

355
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:35,412
什么？
- Excuse me ?

356
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:37,581
你想爽一下吗？
Do you get high ?

357
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:45,316
我是有点醉才敢这么说
You know, I probably wouldn't
even tell you this if I weren't
a little tipsy, but...

358
00:32:47,462 --> 00:32:49,760
我好崇拜你
I'm in complete awe of you.

359
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:57,434
你的房屋仲介公司规模庞大
I mean, your firm...
is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,

360
00:32:57,872 --> 00:33:00,432
你个人的业绩更是...
and your personal
sales record is--

361
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:04,669
让我自叹不如
[ Clicks Tongue, Sighs ]
It's very intimidating.

362
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:09,741
我很想好好研究你的大脑
You know, I'd love to sit down
with you and just pick your brain,

363
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:11,776
如果你肯的话
- [ Chuckles ]
- if you'd ever be willing.

364
00:33:14,322 --> 00:33:17,849
老实说，虽然我们算同行
You know, I suppose technically
I'm the competition,

365
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:25,189
我根本就没资格和你平起平坐
but I mean, hey,
I don't flatter myself...
that I'm even
in the same league as you.

366
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:26,424
是真的
I don't.

367
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:28,932
我很乐意
I'd love to.

368
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:33,505
真的？        当然了
- Really ?
- Absolutely.

369
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:36,976
打给我秘书安排午餐
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.

370
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,110
好吧，谢谢你
I'll do that.
Thank you.

371
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:54,796
有一部恐怖片拍一具无头尸
手里的人头去亲一个美女
[ Lester] Did you ever see that movie
where the body is walking around...
carrying its own head, and then
the head goes down on that babe ?

我不是付你钱跑到外面哈草
- [ Both Stop Laughing ]
- Look.
I'm not paying you to do whatever
it is you're doing out here.

374
00:34:06,307 --> 00:34:08,275
好，那就别付我钱
Fine. So don't pay me.

375
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,502
你说什么？
Excuse me ?

376
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:14,512
我不干了，你不必付我钱
I quit, so you don't have
to pay me. 

377
00:34:14,582 --> 00:34:15,480
别烦我
Now leave me alone.

臭小子
Asshole.

00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:27,091
你是我的偶像
I think you just
became my personal hero.

380
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:31,123
你说不干就不干，不怕吗？
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that ?

381
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,466
你今年才...十六岁？
Well, I guess when
you're all of, what, 1 6--

00:34:41,442 --> 00:34:44,002
我有别的收入
I have other sources of income.

385
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,181
我为了应付老爸
就假装是有工作的有为青年
But my dad interferes less
in my life when I pretend...
to be an upstanding young citizen
with a respectable job.

386
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:52,116
赖斯特
[ Carolyn ]
Lester ?

387
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:56,385
你在干嘛？
- What are you doing ?
- Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts.

388
00:34:57,258 --> 00:35:03,359
老婆，这是...芮奇
这是芮奇
[ Wheezing Laugh ]
This is Ricky Fitts.

389
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,927
我是芮奇，刚搬到你家隔壁
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.

390
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:10,937
我跟你女儿同校
I go to school
with your daughter.

391
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:14,636
小珍？        对
- With Jane ?
- Yeah.

392
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:16,233
真的吗？      小珍
- Really ?
-Jane.

393
00:35:17,411 --> 00:35:22,007
我要走了，门口见
Hi. I'm ready to go.
I'll meet you out front.

394
00:35:26,053 --> 00:35:30,012
我死定了
- [ Whimpering Laugh ]
Oh, I'm in trouble.
- [ Chuckles ]

395
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:34,519
幸会了，谢谢你的烟
Nice meeting you, Ricky.
Thanks for the thing.

396
00:35:34,595 --> 00:35:36,290
不客气
Anytime. Lester ?

397
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:40,459
还要的话尽管来找我
If you want any more,
you know where I live.

398
00:35:55,516 --> 00:35:57,484
讨厌，他们回家了
Oh, shit. They're home. 

399
00:35:57,552 --> 00:35:59,019
快点到我房间
Quick.
Let's go up to my room.

400
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,145
我得跟你爸打声招呼
I should say hi
to your dad.

401
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:03,318
不能没有礼貌
I don't want to be rude.

402
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,362
好正点的西装
Nice suit.

403
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:21,770
伯父，你很帅哦
You're looking good,
Mr. Burnham.

404
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:24,903
上次你好像有点紧张
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.

405
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:31,448
那是沙士吗？
Ooh, is that root beer ?

406
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:33,210
我最爱喝沙士了
I love root beer,
don't you ?

407
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:37,907
嗨，妈
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

408
00:37:38,286 --> 00:37:39,412
记得安琪拉吗？
- Hi.
- Remember Angela ?

409
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:42,079
当然了
Yes, of course.

410
00:37:42,223 --> 00:37:44,418
我忘了讲，她要来过夜
可以吗？
I forgot to tell you. She's going
to spend the night. Is that okay ?

411
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:55,636
我老爸糗毙了
-[Jane ] Sorry about my dad.
-[ Angela ]

412
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:57,398
不会，他很好玩
Don't be. I think it's funny.

413
00:37:57,471 --> 00:38:02,534
对你来说他只想跟你上床
Yeah, to you he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.

414
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,678
对我来说
But to me, 

415
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:07,714
他真的很丢脸
he's just...
too embarrassing to live.

416
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:12,614
你老妈才丢脸，她好假哦
Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing. What a phony.

417
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:14,684
你老爸倒是很可爱
- But your dad's actually kind of cute.

418
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:15,946
闭嘴
- Shut up.

419
00:38:16,324 --> 00:38:19,691
是真的
他练一下身体会很性感
[ Angela ] He is. If he just
worked out a little, he'd be hot.

420
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:21,085
闭嘴
- Shut up !
- Come on.

421
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:24,730
难道你没偷看他洗澡吗？
Like you've never sneaked a peek
at him in his underwear ?

422
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:26,664
他的小弟弟一定很大
I bet he's got a big dick.

423
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:29,202
你真是有够恶心
[Jane Laughing ]
You are so grossing me out right now.

424
00:38:29,403 --> 00:38:32,566
要是他是肌肉男我就会搞他
[ Angela ] If he built up his chest
and arms, I would totally fuck him.

425
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:40,139
我还会舔你老爸的小弟弟
然后把他搞到爽歪歪
- y La, la, la, la, la, la y
- I would. I would suck
your dad's big fat dick,
and then I'd fuck him until
his eyes rolled back in his head.

426
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:43,877
什么声音？
- [ Rattling ]
-Jane, shh. What was that noise ?

427
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:48,254
我听到什么
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.

428
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:52,156
那是你淫声浪语的声音
That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.

429
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:54,023
我是说真的
- No, I'm serious.
-[ Rattling ]

430
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:55,986
你看
See ?

431
00:38:57,698 --> 00:39:01,430
我的天
是什么？
- Oh, my God. Jane.
- What is it ?

432
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:06,531
隔壁的小变态
It's that psycho next door.

433
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:09,742
也许他迷上了你
Jane, what if he worships you ?

434
00:39:09,877 --> 00:39:15,042
也许他用死人骷髅什么的
对着你的照片烧香膜拜
What if he's got a shrine
with pictures of you surrounded
by dead people's heads and stuff?

435
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:18,017
他一定在拍我们
Shit. I bet
he's filming us right now.

436
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,984
真的吗？
Really ?

437
00:40:51,778 --> 00:40:54,770
欢迎观赏“变态一箩筐”
Welcome to
America's Weirdest Home Videos.

438
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:22,736
芮奇
-[ Knocking ]
-[ Frank ] Ricky?

439
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,342
我来了
Coming, Dad.

440
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:28,909
我不喜欢你锁住房门
You know I don't like
locked doors in my house, boy.

441
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:36,886
对不起，我不是故意的
- I'm sorry.
I must've locked it by accident.
- Mm.

442
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:40,118
有什么事？
[ Ricky ]
So what's up ?

443
00:41:43,797 --> 00:41:46,265
我要你的尿液样本
I-- I need a urine sample.

444
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:50,831
又过了半年
It's been six months already.

445
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:54,466
我刚小便，明天再给你
Can I give it to you in the morning ?
I just took a whiz.

446
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:56,535
好吧
Yeah. I suppose.

447
00:42:01,348 --> 00:42:02,508
你知道...
Y-You know--

448
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:14,315
晚安，儿子
Well, good night, son.

449
00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:22,856
我在等着你
I've been waiting for you.

450
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:46,107
你练过肌肉，对吧？
You've been working out,
haven't you ?

451
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:48,119
我看得出来
I can tell.

452
00:43:50,456 --> 00:43:52,788
我想要你替我洗澡
I was hoping you could
give me a bath.

453
00:43:53,492 --> 00:43:55,926
我好肮脏
I'm very, very dirty.

454
00:44:28,995 --> 00:44:30,292
你在干嘛？
What are you doing ?

455
00:44:32,531 --> 00:44:33,589
没干嘛
Nothing.

456
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:36,259
你在自慰
- You were masturbating.
- [ Whispers ] I was not.

457
00:44:36,335 --> 00:44:38,963
才没有      你在自慰
Yes, you were.

458
00:44:40,172 --> 00:44:43,039
我是在自慰，把我拉去枪毙吧
Oh, all right.
So shoot me. I was whacking off.

459
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:46,668
没错，我在打手枪
That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.

460
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:50,614
跟我的小弟弟玩
You know, saying ''hi''
to my monster.

461
00:44:50,783 --> 00:44:52,444
太恶心了
That's disgusting.

462
00:44:52,718 --> 00:44:55,812
对不起哦
至少我还有一点性趣
Well, excuse me, but some of us still
have blood pumping through our veins.

463
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:58,024
我也有
- So do I.

464
00:44:58,024 --> 00:44:58,820
是吗？
- Really ?

465
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:01,451
只有我肯采取行动
Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.

466
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:06,156
我不想这样下去
[ Grunts ]
Lester, I refuse to live like this !

467
00:45:06,832 --> 00:45:08,265
我们根本不像夫妻
This is not a marriage.

468
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:11,566
我们早就没有夫妻之实了
This hasn't been
a marriage for years,

469
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:14,197
我不抱怨你就没意见
but you were happy as long
as I kept my mouth shut.

470
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:16,637
可是我变了
Well, guess what.
I've changed.

471
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:19,200
现在我想打手枪就打
And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...

472
00:45:19,278 --> 00:45:21,678
因为你一点也帮不上忙
'cause you're obviously not going
to help me out in that department.

473
00:45:21,747 --> 00:45:24,910
你以为只有你会性饥渴吗？
I see. You think you're the
only one who's sexually frustrated.

474
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:28,116
是吗？那就上呀，宝贝
I'm not ? Well, then,
come on, baby. I'm ready.

475
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:30,221
别把我惹毛了
Don't you mess
with me, mister.

476
00:45:30,289 --> 00:45:33,588
小心我跟你离婚把你整惨
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.

477
00:45:33,759 --> 00:45:35,920
凭什么？
On what grounds ?

478
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:38,553
我不酗酒，不乱搞外遇
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

479
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:40,758
从来没有动手打过你
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

480
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:46,032
自从你摆明把我当成废物
我连碰都没碰过你
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be !

481
00:45:48,374 --> 00:45:51,571
不过我却帮你考到仲介执照
But... I did support you
when you got your license.

482
00:45:51,644 --> 00:45:55,205
我应该能分你一半的财产
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.

483
00:45:55,681 --> 00:46:01,476
待会你上床记得关灯
Oh !
So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, okay ?

484
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,396
能够尽情发泄的感觉很棒
[ Lester Narrating ] It's a great thing
when you realize you still have...
the ability
to surprise yourself.

485
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:23,542
也许我的能力不限于此
Makes you wonder what else you can do
that you've forgotten about.

486
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,544
大伙好
Hey, guys.

487
00:46:25,778 --> 00:46:27,575
你也跑步吗？
Lester. I didn't know you ran.

488
00:46:27,947 --> 00:46:29,175
才开始
- I just started.

489
00:46:29,315 --> 00:46:30,339
太好了
- Good for you.

490
00:46:30,616 --> 00:46:34,643
你们可以指点指点我
我得赶紧练好身材
Ifigured you guys might be
able to give me some pointers.
I need to shape up, fast.

491
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,654
你是想减重
Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...

492
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:40,183
还是增强体力跟耐力
increased strength
and flexibility as well ?

493
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,017
我只想有好身材
I-- I want
to look good naked.

494
00:46:59,245 --> 00:47:00,678
搞什么？
Oh, what is this ?

495
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,644
同性恋大游行吗？
Fuckin'gay pride parade ?

496
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:05,916
芮奇
Hey ! Yo, Ricky.

497
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:13,052
我累得半死，他们却轻松自在
My entire life is passing
before my eyes, and those two
have barely broken a sweat.

498
00:47:14,193 --> 00:47:17,390
抱歉，你好
我住隔壁，我们没见过
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.

499
00:47:17,563 --> 00:47:19,394
海军陆战队法兰克费兹中校
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.

500
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:24,492
欢迎搬来这里
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

501
00:47:28,874 --> 00:47:35,905
上次我们谈到的那部电影
Ricky, uh--
I was thinking about the, uh--
I was gonna-- The movie we talked about.

502
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,380
“活死人”        没错
- Re-Animator.
- Yeah !

503
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:40,110
你想借来看，在我房间
You want to borrow it ?
Okay. It's up in my room.

504
00:47:40,486 --> 00:47:41,350
来吧
 Come on.

505
00:47:52,431 --> 00:47:54,228
帮我拿一下      好
- Can you hold this for a sec ?
- Sure.

506
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:57,701
有人在我老爸不会闯进来
I don't think my dad would try
to come in while someone else
is here,

507
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,067
不过谁晓得
 but you never know.

508
00:47:59,138 --> 00:48:01,038
这是什么？      尿液
- What is this ?
- Urine.

509
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:05,738
我每半年得验尿毒
确定没有吸毒
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.

510
00:48:06,745 --> 00:48:09,145
别开玩笑，你昨晚才哈草
Are you kidding ?
You just smoked with me last night.

511
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:11,280
这不是我的
It's not mine.

512
00:48:12,218 --> 00:48:15,278
我有个客户是小儿科护士
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

513
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:19,348
我算她便宜，她给我干净尿液
Cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.

514
00:48:21,927 --> 00:48:23,417
你喜欢平克佛洛伊乐团？
You like Pink Floyd ?

515
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:26,664
我喜欢不同的音乐
I like a lot of music.

516
00:48:29,135 --> 00:48:32,104
我有好久没听这张唱片
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.

517
00:48:33,706 --> 00:48:34,866
你要多少？
How much do you want ?

518
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:38,201
不晓得，我好久没买了
I don't know. It's been a while.

519
00:48:38,277 --> 00:48:39,539
一盎斯多少？
Um, how much is an ounce ?

520
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:46,143
这是好货，三百元
This is totally decent,
and it's 300.

521
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:52,049
这是上等货
This shit is
top of the line.

522
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:55,750
G13，政府研发的品种
It's called G-1 3. It's genetically
engineered by the U.S. government.

523
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:59,592
吸了很爽，不过很温和
不会有副作用
It's extremely potent, but
a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

524
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,559
昨晚就是哈这玩意？
Is that what we smoked
last night ?

525
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:06,229
我只哈这一种草
This is all I ever smoke.

526
00:49:10,276 --> 00:49:11,174
多少？
- How much ?

527
00:49:12,344 --> 00:49:13,333
两千
- Two grand.

528
00:49:13,946 --> 00:49:15,174
乖乖
Jesus !

529
00:49:16,148 --> 00:49:18,878
时代真的是变了
Things have changed since 1 973.

530
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:21,583
不必付现，你很可靠
- You don't have to pay now.
I know you're good for it.

531
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:22,787
谢了
- Thanks.

532
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:25,180
我的名片有呼叫机号码
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.

533
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:27,688
随时call我都行
Beep me anytime, day or night.

534
00:49:29,562 --> 00:49:30,893
我只收现金
And I only accept cash.

535
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,264
怪不得你买得起这些器材
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

536
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:39,803
当年我为了买匣式录音机
打了一暑假的工
God. When I was your age,
I flipped burgers all summer
just to buy an eight-track.

537
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:41,505
逊毙了
- That sucks.

538
00:49:42,074 --> 00:49:43,905
不，其实很棒
- No, actually it was great.

539
00:49:45,744 --> 00:49:47,837
当年我成天狂欢作乐
All I did was party
and get laid.

540
00:49:50,182 --> 00:49:52,082
有挥霍不完的青春
I had my whole life
ahead of me.

541
00:49:55,221 --> 00:49:58,088
我爸以为这是打工赚来的
My dad thinks I pay for all
this with catering jobs.

542
00:49:59,825 --> 00:50:02,350
自欺欺人有时候很有用
Never underestimate
the power of denial.

543
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:27,908
? There must be some way
out of here ?

544
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:30,478
? Said the joker
to the thief ?

545
00:50:31,857 --> 00:50:35,452
? There's too much confusion ?

546
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:38,526
你这是在干什么？
-? I can't get no relief ?
- What the hell do you
think you're doing ?

547
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:42,266
母老虎发威了
- Uh-oh. Mom's mad.
-?? [ Continues ]

548
00:50:42,701 --> 00:50:43,690
我在举重
Bench presses.

549
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:48,298
我先练胸肌然后再练背肌
I'm going to whale on my pecks,
and then I'm going to do my back.

550
00:50:49,108 --> 00:50:53,135
你在哈草，那敢情好
I see you're smoking pot now.
I-- I'm so glad.

551
00:50:53,479 --> 00:50:58,507
吸食非法的违禁药物
真是给咱们女儿的好模范
I think using illegal
psychotropic substances...
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

552
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:02,717
你这拜金女郎凭什么教训我
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

553
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:08,153
你怎么讲话这么毒？
Uh-- Lester !
You have such hostility in you.

554
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:10,124
拜托，让我健身好吗？
Do you mind ? I'm trying to work
out here.

555
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:12,487
除非你想帮我
 Unless... you want to spot me.

556
00:51:13,132 --> 00:51:19,363
你一定会得到报应的
Lester, you will not
get away with this.
- You can be sure of that.
-? There are many here among us ?

557
00:51:20,072 --> 00:51:25,271
话...别...说得...太早
- That's... what...
-? Who feel that life is but a joke ??
you... think.

558
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:32,711
我在公司只能偷骂混帐的上司
'' My job consists of
basically masking...
''my contempt for
the assholes in charge...

559
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:38,683
每天至少有一次
我会跑到男厕打手枪
''and at least once a day
retiring to the men's room...
''so I can jerk off...

560
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:44,896
然后幻想我的人生不是地狱
''while I fantasize
about a life...
that doesn't so closely
resemble hell.''

561
00:51:45,197 --> 00:51:48,689
我看你是不想保住饭碗
Well, you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself.

562
00:51:49,335 --> 00:51:53,271
十四年来我为工作出卖灵魂
Brad, for 1 4 years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

563
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,705
现在我只想对公司开火
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.

564
00:51:56,842 --> 00:52:00,209
随便你
你今天就得卷铺盖走路
Whatever. Management wants you
gone by the end of the day.

565
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:03,737
你们打算给我多少遣散费
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,

566
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:08,386
我知道主编用公司的钱召妓
considering the information
I have about our editorial director...
buying pussy
with company money ?

567
00:52:08,787 --> 00:52:13,292
这种事国税局一定很感兴趣
Which I think
would interest the I.R.S.,
since it technically
constitutes fraud.

568
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:16,395
杂志的广告主和对手
也一定很想知道
And I'm sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications...

569
00:52:16,395 --> 00:52:20,661
更别说他老婆
might like to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.

570
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:23,757
你想要什么？
- What do you want ?

571
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:27,028
一年的薪水加福利
- One year's salary with benefits.

572
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:28,806
不可能
That's not going to happen.

573
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:33,675
那我就顺便提出性骚扰告诉
What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot ?

574
00:52:33,746 --> 00:52:37,512
你想告谁？
[ Laughing ]
Against who ?

575
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:39,341
告你啊
[ Laughs ]
Against you.

576
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:45,613
你能证明你没有
逼我让你替我吹箫吗？
Can you prove that you
didn't offer to save my job...
if I let you blow me ?

577
00:52:50,696 --> 00:52:54,132
你是个大疯子
Man... you are
one twisted fuck.

578
00:52:55,534 --> 00:53:01,533
不是，我只是豁出去的平凡人
Nope. I'm just
an ordinary guy...
with nothing to lose.

579
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:16,716
卡洛琳      巴迪
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.

580
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:20,223
抱歉让你等这么久
-I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
-Oh. [ Chuckles ]

581
00:53:21,627 --> 00:53:26,929
克莉丝到纽约了
家里可以说是一团乱
Christy left for New York
this morning.
Let's just say things were
a little... hectic around the house.

582
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:28,799
她到纽约干嘛？
- What's she doing in New York ?
- She's moving there.

583
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:32,594
她要去搬去纽约，我们离婚了
Yes, we are splitting up.

584
00:53:33,572 --> 00:53:35,267
很遗憾
Buddy. I'm so sorry.

585
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:37,233
是啊
Yes. According to her, I'm...

586
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:41,102
她说...我太投入工作了
too focused on my career.

587
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,249
好像我的事业成功反倒是...
- [ Scoffs ]
- As if being driven to succeed is...

588
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:47,980
我的不对
some sort of a character flaw.
[ Chuckling ]

589
00:53:48,387 --> 00:53:54,615
她倒是很会享受我赚来的钱
Well, she certainly did
take advantage of the lifestyle
my success afforded her.
Ooh ! Ha. Wow.
[ Chuckles ]

590
00:53:56,495 --> 00:53:57,519
这样也好
- Ah, it's for the best.
- Mm-hmm.

591
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:04,197
那天看到你们好像幸福
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

592
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:06,033
听我一言
Well, call me crazy,

593
00:54:07,105 --> 00:54:11,064
我的看法是，想要成功
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

594
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:16,539
就得随时随地维持完美形象
one must project
an image of success...
at all times.

595
00:54:36,134 --> 00:54:37,158
你在干嘛？
What are you doing ?

596
00:54:39,338 --> 00:54:41,135
我在拍这只死鸟
- I was filming this dead bird.

597
00:54:41,206 --> 00:54:42,195
为什么？
- Why ?

598
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:44,039
因为它很美
Because it's beautiful.

599
00:54:47,613 --> 00:54:50,673
你是不是忘了吃药？
I think maybe you forgot
your medication today, mental boy.

600
00:54:53,051 --> 00:54:54,382
你好，小珍
[ Ricky ]
Hi,Jane.

601
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:57,521
我要你别再拍我
I want you to stop filming me.

602
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:00,985
好
Okay.

603
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:06,859
别看了，他好无聊，走吧
Well, whatever. This is boring.
Let's go.

604
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:08,524
你要搭便车吗？
- Do you need a ride ?

605
00:55:09,134 --> 00:55:10,294
你疯啦？
- Are you crazy?

606
00:55:10,736 --> 00:55:13,671
我不想被他分尸丢进垃圾桶
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces
in a Dumpster somewhere.

607
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:15,132
没关系，我走路
It's okay. I'll walk.

608
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,242
谢了
But thanks.

609
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:19,639
他不想来，走吧
He doesn't want to go anyway.
Let's go.

610
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:22,203
来吧
- Come on,Jane.

611
00:55:23,315 --> 00:55:24,714
我也想走路
- I think I'm going to walk too.

612
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:26,916
什么？
What ?

613
00:55:27,819 --> 00:55:30,515
拜托，有一哩路耶
Jane, that's, like,
almost a mile.

614
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:49,506
爽毙了
[ Laughing, Grunting ]
Oh, God!
- [ Grunting ]
- I love it ! Oh ! Oh !

615
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:51,031
你爱被仲介王搞吗？
- You like getting nailed by the King ?

616
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:52,633
爱死了
- Oh, yes, I love it !

617
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:54,605
操我吧，陛下
- Fuck me, Your Majesty ! Aah !
- Ohh !

618
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:57,314
谁是国王？    你
- Who's the King ?
- Oh ! You are !

619
00:55:57,382 --> 00:55:58,371
谁是国王？

Uh, no, but thank you.

to fill out an application.

638
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:15,021
经理没缺，只有服务生
- There's no jobs for manager.
It's just for counter.

639
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:16,516
很好
- Good.

640
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:24,368
我想找不动脑筋的工作
I'm looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.

641
00:57:24,368 --> 00:57:26,063
你不适合这工作
I don't think
you'd fit in here.

642
00:57:26,937 --> 00:57:29,167
我干过速食餐饮业
I have fast food experience.

643
00:57:29,606 --> 00:57:31,665
那是二十年前
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, like 20 years ago.

644
00:57:32,276 --> 00:57:35,734
虽然速食餐饮业日新月异
I'm sure there've been amazing
technological advances in the industry,

645
00:57:35,812 --> 00:57:38,440
不过应该有职前训练吧
but surely you must have
some sort of training program.

646
00:57:38,615 --> 00:57:41,140
别以为我一定学不会
It seems unfair to presume
I won't be able to learn.

647
00:57:45,622 --> 00:57:48,216
你让我好舒服
- That was exactly what I needed--
- Mm.

648
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:54,228
皇家的享受
the ''royal treatment,''
so to speak.

649
00:57:57,234 --> 00:57:59,031
我的压力一直都太大
I was so stressed out. Ah !

650
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,178
你知道我都怎样吗？
Know what I do
when I feel like that ?

651
00:58:09,246 --> 00:58:10,304
怎样？
What ?

652
00:58:11,882 --> 00:58:13,975
我去打靶
- I fire a gun.
- Really ?

653
00:58:14,084 --> 00:58:17,688
真的吗？
我都到市区的靶场
Oh, yeah. I go to this
little firing range downtown,

654
00:58:17,688 --> 00:58:22,057
狠狠地开几枪
and I...just pop off
a few rounds.

655
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:24,284
我没开过枪
- I've never fired a gun before.
- Well, you've gotta try it.

656
00:58:24,361 --> 00:58:29,064
你得试试看
没有什么比它更爽
Nothing makes you feel
more powerful.

657
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:35,732
除了一件事
Well...
almost nothing.

658
00:58:40,043 --> 00:58:41,908
你喜欢新家吗？
- So, do you like your new house ?

659
00:58:42,512 --> 00:58:43,501
喜欢
- I like it.

660
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:49,946
以前的屋主常常喂流浪猫
我妈差点没抓狂
The people who used to live
there fed these stray cats,
so they were always around,
and it drove
my mother nuts.

661
00:58:50,253 --> 00:58:52,278
后来她砍掉他们的树
And then she cut down
their tree.

662
00:58:54,057 --> 00:58:55,615
那是出殡吗？
Is that a funeral ?

663
00:58:56,193 --> 00:58:59,754
对，你有认识的人死过吗？
Yeah. Have you ever
known anybody who died ?

664
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:02,724
没有，你呢？
No. Have you ?

665
00:59:03,734 --> 00:59:04,792
没有
No.

666
00:59:05,836 --> 00:59:08,634
不过我看过女流浪汉冻死
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once...

667
00:59:08,705 --> 00:59:13,472
她就躺在人行道
看起来好可怜
just laying there
on the sidewalk.
She looked really sad.

668
00:59:26,657 --> 00:59:28,852
我把她拍下来了
I got that homeless woman
on videotape.

669
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,287
你为什么要拍？
Why would you film that ?

670
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:33,386
因为很动人
- Because it was amazing.

671
00:59:33,797 --> 00:59:35,765
有什么动人的？
- What's amazing about it ?

672
00:59:35,966 --> 00:59:37,831
当你看到这种事
When you see something like that,
it's like God is looking right at you,

673
00:59:38,068 --> 00:59:41,861
就像是上帝在凝视着你
just for a second,

674
00:59:42,005 --> 00:59:44,565
你只要留意就能回望过去
and if you're careful,
you can look right back.

675
00:59:44,908 --> 00:59:46,170
你看到什么？
And what do you see ?

676
00:59:47,844 --> 00:59:49,106
美感
Beauty.

677
01:00:05,562 --> 01:00:08,622
妈，我要你见一个人
Mom, I want you
to meet somebody.

678
01:00:12,469 --> 01:00:13,800
妈？
- Mom.

679
01:00:14,304 --> 01:00:15,430
什么事？
- Yes ?

680
01:00:17,774 --> 01:00:21,107
我要你见一个人，这是小珍
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jane.

681
01:00:21,878 --> 01:00:27,739
真是的，家里真是一团乱
- Hi.
- Oh, my.
I apologize for the way
things look around here.

682
01:00:37,894 --> 01:00:39,589
我老爸都一个人来这儿
[ Ricky ]
This is where my dad hides out.

683
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,364
我猜他很喜欢枪
[Jane ]
I take it he's got a thing for guns.

684
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:46,000
你得看这个
You gotta see
this one thing.

685
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:50,866
被他发现我会被打死
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was in here.

686
01:00:52,008 --> 01:00:53,498
你偷拿他的钥匙？
Did you steal his keys ?

687
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:56,740
没有，有个客户是锁匠
No. One of my clients
is a locksmith.

688
01:00:56,813 --> 01:00:59,373
他缺钱，所以用这个交换
He was short on cash one night,
so I let him pay me in trade.

689
01:01:14,364 --> 01:01:15,353
翻过来
Turn it over.

690
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,198
我的天
Oh, my God.

691
01:01:21,538 --> 01:01:24,029
希特勒的官方瓷盘
It's, like, official state china
of the Third Reich.

692
01:01:24,674 --> 01:01:27,973
有一群人专门搜集纳粹玩意
There's a whole subculture
of people who collect this Nazi shit.

693
01:01:29,212 --> 01:01:31,237
我老爸只有这盘子
But my dad just has
this one thing.

694
01:01:43,827 --> 01:01:44,623
怎么了？
- What's wrong ?

695
01:01:45,762 --> 01:01:46,751
没事
- Nothing.

696
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,899
你怕我
No, you're scared of me.

697
01:01:51,001 --> 01:01:51,990
不是
No, I'm not.

698
01:01:53,336 --> 01:01:55,896
你想看我拍过最美的事吗？
You want to see the most beautiful thing
I've ever filmed?

699
01:02:20,764 --> 01:02:25,934
那一天很奇妙
再过几分钟就要下雪
It was one of those days...
where it's a minute
away from snowing,

700
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:30,773
空气中充满能量
and there was this electricity
in the air.

701
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,143
几乎听得到
You can almost hear it.

702
01:02:36,246 --> 01:02:37,440
对吗？
Right ?

703
01:02:42,118 --> 01:02:44,143
这个塑胶袋...
And this bag was just...

704
01:02:45,956 --> 01:02:48,618
就跳起舞来
dancing with me,

705
01:02:50,894 --> 01:02:53,385
像一个小孩求我陪他玩
like a little kid
begging me to play with it,

706
01:02:55,832 --> 01:02:57,823
整整十五分钟
for 1 5 minutes.

707
01:03:01,805 --> 01:03:03,966
那一天我突然发现
That's the day I realized
that there was this...

708
01:03:06,109 --> 01:03:09,408
事物的背后都有一种生命
entire life behind things...

709
01:03:13,116 --> 01:03:16,847
一股慈悲的力量
and this incredibly
benevolent force...

710
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,414
让我知道其实我不必害怕
that wanted me to know that there
was no reason to be afraid...

711
01:03:23,126 --> 01:03:24,115
永远不必怕
ever.

712
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:29,826
影片比不上亲眼目睹
Video's a poor excuse, I know,

713
01:03:32,869 --> 01:03:34,496
不过它让我牢记这件事
but it helps me remember.

714
01:03:39,142 --> 01:03:40,837
我必须牢记
I need to remember.

715
01:03:48,351 --> 01:03:50,581
有时候这个世界...
Sometimes there's so much...

716
01:03:51,821 --> 01:03:57,125
拥有太多的美
beauty...
in the world.

717
01:03:58,628 --> 01:04:00,289
我好像无法承受
I feel like
I can't take it...

718
01:04:05,335 --> 01:04:06,495
我的心...
and my heart...

719
01:04:08,171 --> 01:04:13,038
差一点就要崩溃
is just going to...
cave in.

720
01:04:59,589 --> 01:05:01,784
天啊，几点了？
Oh, my God.
What time is it ?

721
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,098
抱歉我这么晚
- Sorry I'm late.

722
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,725
没关系
- No, that's quite all right, dear.

723
01:05:13,737 --> 01:05:15,864
我跟你爸在谈他的工作
Your father and I were
just discussing his day at work.

724
01:05:16,106 --> 01:05:17,971
老公，跟女儿谈谈吧
Why don't you tell
our daughter about it, honey ?

725
01:05:18,174 --> 01:05:19,505
今天我辞职不干
-Janie, today I quit my job.
- [ Laughing ]

726
01:05:20,577 --> 01:05:24,604
我叫老板去死
还勒索他给我六万元
Then I told my boss to go fuck
himself, and then I blackmailed
him for almost $60,000.

727
01:05:24,681 --> 01:05:28,817
把芦笋传给我
你爸认为这种事很光荣
- Pass the asparagus.
- Your father seems to think...
this kind of behavior
is something to be proud of.

728
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:34,015
你妈只想让我活得像个囚犯
让我的小弟弟无用武之地
And your mother seems to prefer
that I go through life
like a fucking prisoner...
while she keeps my dick
in a Mason jar under the sink.

729
01:05:34,124 --> 01:05:36,649
你怎么能说这种话？
How dare you speak to me
that way in front of her ?

730
01:05:36,726 --> 01:05:41,887
你被开除还敢这么大声说话
And I marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me...
on the same day
that you lose your job !

731
01:05:41,998 --> 01:05:44,899
我没有被开除，好吗？
是老子不干的
I didn't lose it. It's not like,
''Whoops, where did my job go ?''

732
01:05:44,968 --> 01:05:46,162
把芦笋传给我
I quit !
Pass the asparagus.

733
01:05:47,003 --> 01:05:51,667
谢谢你让我一个人负担家计
Oh, oh, oh! And I want to thank you for
putting me under the added pressure...
of being the sole
breadwinner now.

734
01:05:51,808 --> 01:05:52,638
我找到工作
- I already have a job.
- No, no!

735
01:05:52,976 --> 01:05:55,308
你根本没有想到房贷
Don't give a second thought
as to who's going to pay the mortgage.

736
01:05:55,378 --> 01:05:58,973
你只会把问题丢给我
让我搞定一切
We'll leave it up to Carolyn.
''You're going to take care
of everything now, Carolyn ?''

737
01:05:59,049 --> 01:06:03,748
好像我不介意
一个人背负起家计重担
''Yes. I don't mind.''
"Everything ? You don't mind having
the sole responsibility?

738
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,879
你却潇洒地辞职不干
Your husband feels he can just
quit his job, and you don't--''

739
01:06:06,156 --> 01:06:08,818
拜托谁把芦笋传给我好吗？
Will someone please pass me
the fucking asparagus ?

740
01:06:08,892 --> 01:06:10,052
我不想管你们
- I'm not going to be a part of this.

741
01:06:10,126 --> 01:06:10,820
给我坐下
- Sit down !

742
01:06:10,894 --> 01:06:15,263
? And I'm irresponsibly mad ?

743
01:06:15,331 --> 01:06:18,198
? For you ?

744
01:06:18,268 --> 01:06:21,362
? Go on and call me ?

745
01:06:21,438 --> 01:06:23,372
? Unpredictable ?

746
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,501
? Tell me that I'm impractical ?

747
01:06:27,577 --> 01:06:31,138
? Rainbows
I'm inclined to pursue ?

748
01:06:31,514 --> 01:06:34,210
我受不了你们把我当隐形人
I am sick and tired of being treated
like I don't exist.

749
01:06:34,717 --> 01:06:39,450
你们想做什么都行
我不会抱怨
You two do whatever you want
to do whenever you want to do it,
and I don't complain.

750
01:06:39,522 --> 01:06:42,184
不会吗？我一定是耳聋了
- All I want--
- Oh, you don't complain ?
Oh, please ! Excuse me !

751
01:06:42,258 --> 01:06:45,125
你不是在抱怨吗？
I must be psychotic then !
If you don't complain, what is this ?

752
01:06:45,195 --> 01:06:49,461
拜托你别让我笑掉大牙
Yeah, let's bring in the laugh meter
and see how loud it gets on that one.

753
01:06:52,302 --> 01:06:56,295
? Mad for you ??

754
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:02,378
老婆，别打岔
Don't interrupt me, honey.

755
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:18,183
还有一件事
And another thing.

756
01:07:18,695 --> 01:07:21,425
从现在起，音乐要换着听
From now on, we're going
to alternate our dinner music,

757
01:07:21,498 --> 01:07:23,932
不是只有我这么想
because, frankly--
and I don't think I'm alone here--

758
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,560
这种轻音乐难听死了
I am really tired
of this Lawrence Welk shit.

759
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:33,134
? A bright, shiny world ?

760
01:07:36,012 --> 01:07:37,445
走开
- Go away.
-[ Carolyn ] Please.

761
01:07:37,514 --> 01:07:40,741
小珍，让我进去
Please let me in.

762
01:07:49,558 --> 01:07:54,462
我不想让你看到刚才那一幕
不过我也很庆幸
Look, I wish that you hadn't witnessed
that awful scene tonight,
but in a way, I'm glad.

763
01:07:54,596 --> 01:07:57,190
为什么？你跟老爸都很变态
Why ? So I could see
what freaks you and Dad really are ?

764
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,189
我变态？
Me ?

765
01:08:01,904 --> 01:08:07,368
妈，别这样
Tsk. God.
- Oh, Christ. Mom.
-[ Sobbing ]

766
01:08:08,243 --> 01:08:10,711
我很庆幸...
No, I'm glad because, uh--

767
01:08:12,848 --> 01:08:16,944
现在你学会人生最重要的一课
because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life:

768
01:08:18,387 --> 01:08:22,414
你不能靠别人只能靠自己
You cannot count
on anyone except yourself.

769
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:29,763
你这辈子只能靠自己
You cannot count on
anyone except yourself.

770
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,563
很悲哀，不过是真的
You know, it's sad but true,

771
01:08:34,837 --> 01:08:37,032
越早学会这点越好
and the sooner you learn it,
the better.

772
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:41,107
我没心情跟你演欢乐一家亲
Look, Mom, I really don't feel like
having a Kodak moment here.

773
01:08:41,143 --> 01:08:44,010
没良心的小贱人

- You ungrateful little brat !

774

你拥有这一切
Just look at everything
you have !

775
01:08:47,316 --> 01:08:49,876
我小时候只能住小公寓
When I was your age,
I lived in a duplex !

776
01:08:49,952 --> 01:08:51,817
哪来这么大的房子？
We didn't even have
our own house.

777
01:10:53,442 --> 01:10:57,374
小畜生
- [ Door Slams Open ]
- You little bastard !
Dad, no, I just--

778
01:10:57,513 --> 01:10:59,037
你是怎么打开的？
How did you get in there ?

779
01:10:59,715 --> 01:11:01,273
说啊！说啊！
How ? How ?

780
01:11:03,519 --> 01:11:04,508
给我起来
Come on ! Get up !
Come on !

781
01:11:05,187 --> 01:11:06,586
起来
Get up !

782
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:09,782
还手呀，小孬种
Fight back,
you little pussy!

783
01:11:09,858 --> 01:11:11,553
我不会还手
- No, sir, I won't fight you.
- How ?

784
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:14,220
你是怎么打开的？
- How did you get in there ?

785
01:11:14,329 --> 01:11:15,557
用东西撬开的
- I picked the lock, sir.

786
01:11:15,964 --> 01:11:17,727
你在找什么？钱？
What were you looking for, huh ?
Money ?

787
01:11:17,799 --> 01:11:19,323
你又在吸毒吗？
 Are you on dope again ?

788
01:11:19,468 --> 01:11:22,301
我只想让女朋友看纳粹瓷盘
No, sir. I wanted to show
my girlfriend your Nazi plate.

789
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:24,928
女朋友？
A girlfriend ?

790
01:11:25,307 --> 01:11:27,172
对，她住在隔壁
Yes, sir. She lives next door.
[ Panting ]

791
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:42,083
她叫小珍
Her name's Jane.
[ Coughing ]

792
01:12:02,644 --> 01:12:04,635
我这是为你好
This is for
your own good, boy.

793
01:12:07,883 --> 01:12:12,877
你一点都不尊重别人的事物
You have no respect for other
people's things and for authority--

794
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:14,445
是，对不起
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

795
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:18,526
你不能爱怎样就怎样
Can't just go around doing
whatever you feel like.

796
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:21,862
你得懂得守规矩
You can't.
There are rules in life.

797
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,022
是的
Yes, sir.

798
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:28,125
你要懂得规矩
You need structure, yeah.
You need--

799
01:12:29,037 --> 01:12:30,698
你要有纪律
- [ Together] Discipline.
- Yes, sir. Thank you
for trying to teach me.

800
01:12:30,772 --> 01:12:34,872
是，谢谢你教我，别对我失望
Don't give up on me, Dad.

801

芮奇
Oh, Ricky.

802
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:49,249
别动我的东西
You stay out of there.

803
01:13:36,738 --> 01:13:39,074
班太太，一开始我以为你不行
- Whoo !
- I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham,

804
01:13:39,074 --> 01:13:43,067
不过你是天生好手
when you first came here, I thought you
would be hopeless, but you're a natural.

805
01:13:43,245 --> 01:13:46,772
我只知道，我好爱开枪
Well, all I know is
I love shooting this gun.

806
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:51,915
别阻止我，我一定要高飞
[ Singing Along With Radio ]
y Don't tell me not to fly
I've simply got to y

807
01:13:51,987 --> 01:13:55,184

y If someone takes a spill
it's me and not you y

808

my band out ?
? I'll beat my drum ?

怎么了？
What ?

819
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:04,022
那是谁的车？
Uh, whose car is that

70年火鸟跑车
1 97 0 Pontiac Firebird,

- Uh-huh. Where's the Camry ?

825
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:14,028
拿去换了
I traded it in.

826
01:15:15,036 --> 01:15:17,231
你不是该先问我吗？
-Shouldn't you have consulted me first ?

827
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:18,997
我想想看
-Hm, let me think.

828
01:15:19,574 --> 01:15:21,667
不必，你又没开过
No. You never drove it.

真是的，卡洛琳
Christ, Carolyn.

I am not joyless.

a lot about me...
that you don't know,

Who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building...

对着直升机露屁股
to flash

难道你都忘了吗？
- [ Chuckles ]
- Have you totally forgotten about her ?

847

我可没忘
Because I haven't.

848

你会把啤酒倒在沙发上
Lester, you're going
to spill beer on the couch.

849
01:17:12,454 --> 01:17:14,046
又怎样？这只是沙发
So what ?
It's just a couch.

850
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:21,123
这是四千块的意大利高级沙发
This is a $4,000 sofa,
upholstered in Italian silk.

851
01:17:21,196 --> 01:17:22,823
不是普通的沙发
This is not just a couch.

852
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:26,459
这只是沙发
It's just... a... couch !

853
01:17:27,102 --> 01:17:28,729
不是你的人生
This isn't life !

854
01:17:29,504 --> 01:17:30,994
这只是物质
This is just stuff,

855
01:17:31,573 --> 01:17:36,137
你却把物质看得比生命重要
太荒唐了
and it's become more important
to you than living.
Well, honey,
that's just nuts.

856
01:17:45,287 --> 01:17:46,879
我只是想帮你

Don't.

为什么？
[ Ricky ]
Why?

859
01:18:00,569 --> 01:18:05,572
看到自己很奇怪
我不喜欢自己
It's weird watching myself.
I don't like how I look.

860
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:10,801
你不知道你很美吗？
I can't believe you don't know
how beautiful you are.

861
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:14,248
我不想听你说疯话
Look. I'm not going
to sit here for that shit.

862
01:18:23,558 --> 01:18:26,550
你觉得怎样？
Ha ! How does it feel now ?

863
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:28,325
很好
Fine.

864
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:30,463
你不觉得很赤裸吗？
You don't feel naked ?

865
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,431
我本来就是赤裸
I am naked.

866
01:18:34,402 --> 01:18:35,767
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

867

说说疗养院的事
So tell me about
being in the hospital.

868
01:18:51,953 --> 01:18:55,445
我十五岁哈草被我爸逮到
When I was 1 5,
my dad caught me smoking dope.

869
01:18:55,924 --> 01:18:59,189
他决定把我送到军事学校
He totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school.

870
01:19:01,363 --> 01:19:04,355
要我学会规矩和纪律
I told you this whole thing
about structure and discipline, right ?

871
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:07,960
不过我被学校开除
Of course,
I got kicked out.

872
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:10,899
我们吵了一大架
Dad and I had
this huge fight.

873
01:19:11,973 --> 01:19:13,099
他打我
He hit me.

874
01:19:14,442 --> 01:19:18,208
隔天同学讥笑我的发型
And the next day at school,
some kid made a crack about my haircut,

875
01:19:20,115 --> 01:19:21,673
我突然抓狂
and I just snapped.

876
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,353
我想要杀死他
I wanted to kill him.

877
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:32,157
要不是我被拉开
I would've... killed him...

878
01:19:33,828 --> 01:19:35,853
他早就挂了
if they hadn't pulled me off.

879
01:19:39,434 --> 01:19:43,097
于是我爸就把我送进疯人院
That's when my dad
put me in the hospital.

880
01:19:43,605 --> 01:19:46,301
我在里头待了两年
They drugged me up and left me
in there for two years.

881
01:19:51,246 --> 01:19:53,180
你一定恨死他了
- You must really hate him.
-[ Lighter Clicking ]

882
01:19:57,085 --> 01:19:58,643
他不是坏人
He's not a bad man.

883
01:19:59,688 --> 01:20:03,215
我爸敢这么做我一定恨死他
Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my
dad if he did something like that to me.

884
01:20:04,959 --> 01:20:10,097
等等，我早就恨他了
Wait.
I already do hate my dad.

885
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:10,961
为什么？
Why ?

886
01:20:14,235 --> 01:20:15,702
他是个混蛋
He's a total asshole:
he's got this crush on my friend Angela,

887
01:20:16,003 --> 01:20:20,035
他迷上安琪拉，恶心死了
and it's disgusting.

888
01:20:20,374 --> 01:20:22,342
你希望他迷上你
- You'd rather he had the crush on you.

拜托，才不是
- Gross. No.
-[ Chuckling ]

890
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:33,008
我只希望他能多注意我一点
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near
as important to him as she is.

891
01:20:37,091 --> 01:20:40,720
你觉得他是好好先生，你错了
I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.

892
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:45,030
他对我造成很大的心理伤害
He's doing massive
psychological damage to me.

893
01:20:45,332 --> 01:20:47,527
怎么说？
How ?

894
01:20:48,035 --> 01:20:50,970
我也得守规矩
Well, now I, too,
need structure,

895
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:53,531
还需要一点纪律
a little fucking discipline.

896
01:21:05,019 --> 01:21:06,384
我是说真的
I'm serious, though.

897
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,812
他是真的伤害了我
How could he not
be damaging me ?

898
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,924
我需要一个模范父亲
I need a father
who's a role model,

899
01:21:15,629 --> 01:21:22,965

就流口水的色鬼老爸
not some horny geek boy
who's going to spray his shorts...
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

他逊毙了
What a lame-o.

901
01:21:27,775 --> 01:21:30,903
有人应该把他杀死算了
Someone really should just...
put him out of his misery.

902
01:21:34,581 --> 01:21:36,310
要我干掉他吗？
Want me to kill him for you ?

903
01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:47,851
好，你肯吗？
Yeah. Would you ?

904
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,421
你得花一笔钱
It'll cost you.

905
01:21:51,765 --> 01:21:54,359
我十岁起就当保母
I've been baby-sitting
since I was about ten.

906
01:21:54,468 --> 01:21:57,266
存了三千元
I've got almost $3,000.

907
01:22:00,307 --> 01:22:02,366
本来是用来隆胸的
Of course I was saving it up
for a boob job.

908
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:04,908
但是...
But--

909
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:22,254
这么做不太好
You know, that's not
a very nice thing to do--

910
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:27,196
请杀手干掉你老爸
hiring someone
to kill your dad.

911
01:22:30,771 --> 01:22:33,672
我猜我不是好女孩
Well, I guess I'm not
a very nice girl then, am I ?

912
01:22:57,965 --> 01:22:59,865
你知道我在说笑，对吧？
You know I'm not serious, right ?

913
01:23:01,402 --> 01:23:02,630
当然了
Of course.

914
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:20,845
我们能相遇真的很幸运
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other ?

915
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:28,623
有一张海报上面写
[ Lester Narrating ]
Remember those posters that said...

916
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:32,297
每一天都是你一生的开始
"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life" ?

917
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:37,929
只有一天不是
Well, that's true
with every day except one--

918
01:23:38,172 --> 01:23:39,469
你死的那一天
the day you die.

919
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:43,140
? I've looked under chairs ?

920
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,610
? I've looked under tables ?

921
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:50,275
? I've tried to find the key
to 50 million fables ?

922
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:52,545
? They call me the Seeker?

923
01:23:54,788 --> 01:23:59,316
? I've been searching
low and high ?

924
01:24:01,862 --> 01:24:05,423
- yy [ Whistling Melody ]
-? I won't get to get what I'm after?

925
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:07,490
? Till the day I die ?

926
01:24:07,568 --> 01:24:09,593
yy [ Whistling Continues ]

927
01:24:13,607 --> 01:24:18,169
? I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked the Beatles ??

928
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,947
小珍，快点
Jane, hurry up.

929
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,179
我有重要的约会
I've got a very important
appointment.

930
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:25,885
今天安琪拉能来过夜吗？
- Is it okay if Angela
sleeps over tonight ?

931
01:24:26,286 --> 01:24:28,720
当然了，欢迎呀
- She's always welcome.

932
01:24:28,789 --> 01:24:32,020
我还以为你们闹翻了呢
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't
seen her around here in a while.

933
01:24:40,067 --> 01:24:40,795
怎么了？
What ?

934
01:24:41,735 --> 01:24:44,226
我不好意思带她来
I've been too embarrassed
to bring her over,

935
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:47,669
因为你那副色迷迷的样子
because of you and that way
that you behave.

936
01:24:48,175 --> 01:24:50,643
乱讲，我根本没跟她说过话
- What are you talking about ?
I've barely even spoken to her.
- Dad!

937
01:24:51,245 --> 01:24:54,578
你老是盯着她看
像个老色鬼，好恶心
You stare at her all the time
like you're drunk !

938
01:24:55,182 --> 01:25:01,648
你最好小心
别变成你妈那种母老虎
- It's disgusting!
- You better watch yourself,
or you're going to turn into
a real bitch just like your mother !

939
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:05,447
该死
[ Whispers ]
Oh, fuck.

940
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:15,029
准备好了吗？
You ready to go ?

941
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:21,006
你不必送我
我要跟小珍一起上学
Oh, I-I don't need a ride.
I'm going with Jane
and her mom.

942
01:25:27,981 --> 01:25:29,915
早
[ Carolyn ]
Oh, morning !

943
01:25:29,983 --> 01:25:32,052
芮奇，你好吗？
[ Lester ]
Yo, Ricky!

944
01:25:32,052 --> 01:25:37,148
还不错
- How's it going ?
- Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.
[ Whispers ]
Hey. Wait.

945
01:26:55,769 --> 01:26:58,670
赶快做一份超级起士堡
[ Man ] I need that Super Smiley
with cheese ASAP!

946
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:01,299
别这么急，小兄弟
- You need more than that,
my little hombre.
- May I take your order?

947
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:03,874
有什么好吃的？
-[ Carolyn Over Speaker ]
Oh,yeah! What's good here ?
-[ Buddy ] Nothing.

948
01:27:04,077 --> 01:27:05,066
没有
Oh, well, 

949
01:27:05,145 --> 01:27:07,670
那么我们就得吃自己
then I guess
we'll just have to be bad, won't we ?

950
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:11,351
我要麦笑堡、薯条跟奶昔
[ Laughs ]
I'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,

951
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,654
来两份
- curly fries and a vanilla shake.
-[ Buddy ] Make that two.

952
01:27:13,654 --> 01:27:16,680
七块九毛八，请到窗口付帐
[ Woman ] That'll be 7.98. Please
drive up to the window. Thank you.

953
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:22,054
激烈运动后来点垃圾食物无妨
I think we deserve a little junk food
after the workout we had this morning.

954
01:27:23,964 --> 01:27:24,623
你太棒了
- Did you know that ?

955
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:26,893
过奖了
- Thank you. I'm flattered.

956
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:30,165
笑一笑，欢迎光临
Smile !
You're at Mr. Smiley's !

957
01:27:32,806 --> 01:27:37,766
今天的特餐是烤香肠堡
只要一块九毛九
Would you like to try our new beef
and cheese pot pie on a stick ?
Just $1 .99 for
a limited time only.

958
01:27:38,145 --> 01:27:40,045
我们刚上完课
- We were just at a seminar.

959
01:27:40,347 --> 01:27:41,609
巴迪，他是...
Buddy, this is my--

960
01:27:41,682 --> 01:27:42,774
她的老公
- Her husband.

961
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,512
我们见过面
We've met before,
but something tells me...

962
01:27:44,685 --> 01:27:47,711
这次你一定会记得我
you're going
to remember me this time.

963
01:27:50,657 --> 01:27:52,989
这下你可被逮到了
You are so busted.

964
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,094
这不关你的事
This really doesn't concern you.

965
01:27:55,195 --> 01:27:59,632
贞妮是点餐经理
这是她的地盘
Well, actually,
Janine is senior drive-thru manager,
so you are on her turf.

966
01:28:02,202 --> 01:28:06,730
你们很速配
- [ Sighs ]
- So, this makes sense.

967
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,266
赖斯特
- Oh, Lester--
- Honey, it's okay.

968
01:28:08,341 --> 01:28:13,143
没关系，我希望你快乐
你们要特制酱料吗？
I want you to be happy.
Would you like Smiley Sauce with that ?

969
01:28:13,213 --> 01:28:14,407
别闹了
- Lester,just stop it !
- No, no.

970
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:15,539
错了
You...

971
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:20,420
你不能再对我颐指气使
don't get to tell me
what to do...

972
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,048
再也不能了
ever again.

973
01:28:36,737 --> 01:28:38,364
对不起
- I'm sorry.
- [ Fingers Tapping ]

974
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:42,570
我们得分开一阵子
I guess we should
cool it for a while.

975
01:28:45,345 --> 01:28:48,246
否则我得付一大笔赡养费
I'm facing a potentially
very expensive divorce.

976
01:28:48,482 --> 01:28:53,884
我完全了解
No, no,
I understand completely.
It's--

977
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:58,490
想要成功就得维持完美形象
''In order to be successful,
one must project an image
of success at all times.''

978
01:29:25,418 --> 01:29:27,477
别哭，别哭
Stop it. Stop it.

979
01:29:42,269 --> 01:29:44,362
? Oh, oh, whoa ?

980
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:54,879
-? There she stood in the street ?
- [ Exhales ]

981
01:29:54,948 --> 01:29:57,917
? Smiling from her head
to her feet ?

982
01:29:57,984 --> 01:30:01,283
? I said
Hey, what is this ?

983
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,481
? Now, baby, maybe ?

984
01:30:03,557 --> 01:30:06,390
? Maybe she's in need
of a kiss ?

985
01:30:06,459 --> 01:30:09,758
该死
-? I said, Hey, what's your name ??
- Shit.

986
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,603
我要到隔壁
I have to run next door.

987
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:22,103
小珍忘了她的课本
她得做功课
Jane left her geometry book in my bag,
and she needs it to do her homework.

988
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:36,147
你跟小变态经常上床对吧？
So you and psycho boy are fucking on,
like, a regular basis now, right ?

989
01:30:36,857 --> 01:30:37,516
没有
No.

990
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:40,056
少来，告诉我嘛
Come on. You can tell me.

991
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:41,688
他的小鸡鸡大吗？
Does he have a big dick ?

992
01:30:41,828 --> 01:30:45,389
我才不会告诉你
事情不是这样
I'm not going to talk about his dick
with you, okay ? It's not like that.

993
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:48,700
难道他没有小鸡鸡吗？
Not like what ?
Doesn't he have one ?

994
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:51,562
你为什么不想说？
Why don't you want
to talk about it ?

995
01:30:51,638 --> 01:30:54,368
谁跟我上床我都会跟你说
- I tell you every detail
about every guy that I fuck.
- Yeah.

996
01:30:54,808 --> 01:30:57,368
也许你不该说
Maybe you shouldn't, all right ?

997
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,568
也许我根本就不想听
Maybe I really don't want
to hear about all that.

998
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:03,507
你有男朋友就不屑听吗？
So now that you have a boyfriend,
you're, like, above it ?

999
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:06,380
你需要真正的男人
We got to get you
a real man.

1000
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:29,439
你有卷烟纸吗？
- You got any papers ?

1001
01:31:29,509 --> 01:31:31,477
在雪茄盒里
- Yeah, in the cigar box
right over there.

1002
01:31:31,845 --> 01:31:34,405
有点原则，拒绝我嘛
Put up a fight, dude. You are such a
pushover. 

1003
01:31:34,481 --> 01:31:36,346
就说你不要嘛
'' No, I can't, really. Okay.''

1004
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:37,747
你应该学会卷烟
You should learn
to roll a joint.

1005
01:32:44,417 --> 01:32:45,406
妈呢？
-[Jane ] Where's Mom ?

1006
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:47,178
不知道
- Don't know.

1007
01:32:47,754 --> 01:32:48,914
伯父好
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.

1008
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:50,553
你好
- Hi.

1009
01:32:51,157 --> 01:32:52,590
看看你
Wow, look at you.

1010
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:54,921
你有健身吗？
Have you been working out ?

1011
01:32:55,395 --> 01:32:56,191
有一点
- Some.
- [ Sighs ]

1012
01:33:01,501 --> 01:33:02,832
看得出来
You can really tell.

1013
01:33:06,306 --> 01:33:08,103
看看你的臂肌
Look at those arms.

1014
01:33:12,445 --> 01:33:14,606
你喜欢肌肉男吗？
You like... muscles ?

1015
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:20,152
我去看小珍在干嘛
[ Laughs ] I should probably
go see whatJane's up to.

1016
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:33,725
钱是哪儿来的？
Where did you get that ?

1017
01:33:36,669 --> 01:33:37,727
我的薪水
- From my job.

1018
01:33:38,271 --> 01:33:39,533
不要骗我
- Don't lie to me.

1019
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:43,808
我看你去找他
Now, I saw you with him.

1020
01:33:45,678 --> 01:33:47,043
你在监视我？
You were watching me ?

1021
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:51,012
他逼你做什么？
What does he make you do ?

1022
01:33:54,421 --> 01:33:56,355
你以为我跟班先生...
Dad, you don't really think
me and Mr. Burnham--

1023
01:33:56,423 --> 01:33:58,220
别笑我
Don't you laugh at me !

1024
01:33:59,993 --> 01:34:04,453
我不能看着我独子变成同志
I will not sit back and watch
my only son become a cocksucker !

1025
01:34:04,531 --> 01:34:09,704
你是有问题吗？
Jesus, what is it with you ?

1026
01:34:09,704 --> 01:34:14,836
我发誓我会把你赶出家门
I swear to God...
I'll throw you out of this house
and never look at you again !

1027
01:34:15,476 --> 01:34:16,374
你是说真的
- You mean that.

1028
01:34:16,877 --> 01:34:18,868
当然了
- You're damn straight I do !

1029
01:34:19,347 --> 01:34:22,373
你死了都比变成同志好
I'd rather you were dead
than be a fuckin' faggot !

1030
01:34:34,228 --> 01:34:35,354
没错
You're right.

1031
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,858
我是牛郎

01:47:29,402 --> 01:47:30,562
别开玩笑
You're kidding.

1168
01:47:31,505 --> 01:47:32,938
对不起
I'm sorry.

1169
01:47:34,074 --> 01:47:35,701
我还是想
I still want to do it.

1170
01:47:36,243 --> 01:47:37,767
只是...
I just... 

1171
01:47:37,844 --> 01:47:39,471
我想先说
thought
I should tell you...

1172
01:47:39,579 --> 01:47:44,781
免得你觉得我...不够好
in case you wondered why I--
I wasn't... better.

1173
01:47:57,898 --> 01:47:59,263
怎么了？
What's wrong ?

1174
01:48:06,206 --> 01:48:08,367
你不是说我很美吗？
I thought you said
I was beautiful.

1175
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:11,834
你是很美
You are beautiful.

1176
01:48:15,048 --> 01:48:16,817
你是这么地美
You are so... beautiful.

1177
01:48:16,817 --> 01:48:18,614
你是这么地美
You are so... beautiful.

1178
01:48:21,922 --> 01:48:26,392
我会是...最幸运的男人
And I would be a very...
lucky man.

1179
01:48:27,694 --> 01:48:29,889
我觉得自己好蠢
I feel so stupid.

1180
01:48:30,463 --> 01:48:31,623
别这样
Don't.

1181
01:48:32,999 --> 01:48:36,059
对不起
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. [ Sobbing ]

1182
01:48:36,670 --> 01:48:38,968
你不必道歉
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

1183
01:48:40,273 --> 01:48:41,570
没关系
It's okay.

1184
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:44,939
一切都没事了
Everything's okay.

1185
01:49:02,128 --> 01:49:03,720
我刚才好饿
Wow, I was starving.

1186
01:49:05,232 --> 01:49:06,665
你要再吃吗？
- Do you want me
to make you another one ?

1187
01:49:07,033 --> 01:49:08,694
不了，我饱了
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

1188
01:49:09,102 --> 01:49:10,091
真的吗？
You sure ?

1189
01:49:11,504 --> 01:49:15,201
我还是有点怕，不过好多了
I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better. 

1190
01:49:15,508 --> 01:49:16,406
谢了
Thanks.

1191
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:21,038
小珍好吗？
- How's Jane ?

1192
01:49:22,482 --> 01:49:23,471
什么意思？
- What do you mean ?

1193
01:49:25,218 --> 01:49:26,310
我是说...
I mean,

1194
01:49:27,621 --> 01:49:28,849
她过得好吗？
how's her life ?

1195
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:31,523
她快乐吗？
Is she happy ?

1196
01:49:32,292 --> 01:49:33,759
悲伤吗？
Is she miserable ?

1197
01:49:35,662 --> 01:49:39,826
我很想知道
她死也不肯告诉我
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.

1198
01:49:42,969 --> 01:49:48,832
她真的很快乐
[ Sighs ]
She's, uh--
She's really happy.

1199
01:49:49,175 --> 01:49:50,699
她觉得自己在谈恋爱
She thinks she's in love.
[ Scoffs ]

1200
01:50:03,123 --> 01:50:04,385
那很好
Good for her.

1201
01:50:09,062 --> 01:50:10,051
你好不好？
How are you ?

1202
01:50:18,138 --> 01:50:20,800
好久都没有人这么问我
It's been a long time
since anybody asked me that.

1203
01:50:28,148 --> 01:50:29,240
我好极了
I'm great.

1204
01:50:36,523 --> 01:50:37,922
我得去上厕所
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

1205
01:50:52,272 --> 01:50:53,364
我好极了
I'm great.

1206
01:51:28,875 --> 01:51:30,467
老天爷
Man, oh man.

1207
01:51:33,813 --> 01:51:36,646
老天爷！
Man, oh man, oh man.

1208
01:52:12,752 --> 01:52:14,185
天啊
[Jane Shudders ]
Oh, my God.

1209
01:53:00,033 --> 01:53:03,332
听说人在死前的一秒钟
[ Lester Narrating ] I had always
heard your entire life flashes...

1210
01:53:03,403 --> 01:53:05,462
他的一生会闪过眼前
in front of your eyes
the second before you die.

1211
01:53:07,006 --> 01:53:07,995
首先
First of all,
that one second...

1212
01:53:08,475 --> 01:53:12,440
其实不是一秒钟
isn't a second at all.

1213
01:53:12,512 --> 01:53:17,514
而是延伸成无止尽的时间
It stretches on forever,
like an ocean of time.

1214
01:53:19,552 --> 01:53:22,555
对我来说我的一生是躺在草地
For me, it was
lying on my back...

1215
01:53:22,555 --> 01:53:26,423
看着流星雨
at Boy Scout camp,
watching falling stars.

1216
01:53:34,701 --> 01:53:40,572
还有街道上枯黄的枫叶
And yellow leaves
from the maple trees...
that lined our street.

1217
01:53:49,382 --> 01:53:55,051
或是奶奶手上像纸一样的皮肤
Or my grandmother's hands
and the way her skin...
seemed like paper.

1218
01:54:02,262 --> 01:54:05,823
还有我第一次看到东尼表哥
And the first time
I saw my cousin Tony's...

1219
01:54:06,132 --> 01:54:08,999
那辆全新的火鸟跑车
brand-new Firebird.

1220
01:54:20,847 --> 01:54:22,041
还有小珍
AndJanie.

1221
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:25,442
小珍
AndJanie.

1222
01:54:58,184 --> 01:55:00,209
还有卡洛琳
And... Carolyn.

1223
01:55:05,592 --> 01:55:08,959
我猜我死了应该生气才对
I guess I could be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me,

1224
01:55:09,429 --> 01:55:13,763
但世界这么美，不该一直生气
but it's hard to stay mad when
there's so much beauty in the world.

1225
01:55:14,968 --> 01:55:19,632
有时候一次看完会无法承受
Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing
it all at once and it's too much.

1226
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:23,798
我的心像涨满的汽球随时会爆
My heart fills up like a balloon
that's about to burst.

1227
01:55:25,545 --> 01:55:28,673
后来我记得要放轻松
And then I remember
to relax...

1228
01:55:29,649 --> 01:55:32,174
别一直想要紧抓着不放
and stop trying
to hold on to it.

1229
01:55:32,652 --> 01:55:35,849
所有的美就像雨水一样洗涤我
And then it flows
through me like rain,

1230
01:55:36,556 --> 01:55:39,855
让我对我这卑微愚蠢的生命
and I can't feel anything
but gratitude...

1231
01:55:40,126 --> 01:55:46,398
在每一刻都充满了感激
for every single moment...
of my stupid little life.

1232
01:55:46,466 --> 01:55:49,401
你一定不知道我在说什么
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, I'm sure.

1233
01:55:50,637 --> 01:55:51,729
别担心
But don't worry.

1234
01:55:53,106 --> 01:55:54,573
有一天你会明白
You will someday.

1235
01:56:01,114 --> 01:56:04,709

? Because the wind is high ?

1244
01:56:40,454 --> 01:56:46,290
? It blows my mind ?

1245
01:56:47,961 --> 01:56:50,794
? Because ?

1246
01:56:50,864 --> 01:56:53,389
? The wind ?

1247
01:56:53,467 --> 01:56:58,234
? Is high ?

01:57:00,207 --> 01:57:03,973

? Love is all, Love is you ?

1251
01:57:17,491 --> 01:57:22,155
? Because the sky is blue ?

1252
01:57:22,229 --> 01:57:28,134
? It makes me cry ?

1253
01:57:29,569 --> 01:57:32,504
? Because ?

1254
01:57:32,572 --> 01:57:35,200
? The sky ?

1255
01:57:35,275 --> 01:57:39,974
? Is blue ?

1256
01:57:41,848 --> 01:57:44,715
? Ahhh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh ?

1257
01:57:44,785 --> 01:57:46,946
? Ahhh, ahh, ahh ?

1258
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:49,113
? Ah, ah, ah ?

1259
01:57:53,593 --> 01:57:56,289
