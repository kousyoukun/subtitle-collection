1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,801
How do you do that?

2
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,262
Hey, Daddy, look at me!

3
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:15,188
I'm not wearing
any underwear...

4
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:16,856
Are you going
to be able to concentrate?

5
00:03:18,024 --> 00:03:19,567
Not if you aren't here...

6
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:22,570
I'm on my way...

7
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:24,279
We hit some weather
in Washington,

8
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:26,156
so I just got off
the plane...

9
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,033
I don't think
I'll make curtain,

10
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:30,619
but I won't miss
your entrance...

11
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:32,579
Have I ever missed?

12
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,001
What's wrong?

13
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,544
Today is the last show...

14
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:43,881
Aw... Are you sad for us
or for the show?

15
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,049
For us...

16
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,968
Oh, I'm touched...

17
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,763
Hold on...

18
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:54,891
Hang on, Victor...

19
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:00,563
- Hey, what's up?
- Client doesn't like London now...

20
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:03,065
- Is Paris set up?
- Yeah...

21
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:06,235
- I just have to talk to Brian...
- Already did, he's fine with it...

22
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:08,904
Looking forward to seeing us
in New York for a champagne toast...

23
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:10,405
I said,
"Friday would be okay?"

24
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:13,492
Sounds fine...
I'll call you later, okay?

25
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,828
- Russell?

26
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:18,455
- Sorry, baby...
- That your husband?

27
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,957
Uh-huh...
Now where were we?

28
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,751
Oh yeah, my underwear...

29
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:34,011
Look, I didn't want to tell you
this over the phone, but...

30
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,307
I've fallen in love with you...

31
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,437
Shit, hold on...

32
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,980
What is it, Victor?

33
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,566
I am counting on you
for dinner, you know...

34
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,610
Why?

35
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:52,236
What do you mean, why?

36
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,155
George is dawdling
on this thing...

37
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,908
He desires you and I think he can
close it tonight, that's why...

38
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:59,660
You know, I don't think
I can make it...

39
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,537
But I'll try
to make dessert, okay?

40
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,164
Don't wait for me...

41
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,834
George?

42
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,087
Thanks for holding...
Listen, 9:00 might be better

43
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,339
if it's not too late...
Good...

44
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:18,344
- Russell?
- Yes...

45
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:20,680
We had a deal, remember?

46
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,389
So you're just going
to have to deal

47
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:25,434
with me pining and moaning over
what we might've had together...

48
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:31,981
You didn't hang up...

49
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:36,486
Not yet...

50
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,323
So what does that mean?

51
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,366
I can't do this...

52
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:49,206
If you're going to bail,
you'd best do it now...

53
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,336
Sweet...

54
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,339
But you didn't
scare her away...

55
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:00,674
Sounded too much
like you meant it...

56
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:01,843
I did...

57
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:03,594
10 minutes
till curtain everyone...

58
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,221
Here we go, folks...
Last night...

59
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:08,599
Well, then I feel
like Cupid...

60
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:13,520
Please, don't hurt her
if that's what this is about...

61
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:20,193
Do you believe in God?

62
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:22,362
Yes, I do...

63
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:25,531
Life's a walking shadow,

64
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:27,116
a poor player, that struts

65
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,577
and frets his hour
upon the stage

66
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,454
then is heard no more...

67
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:34,498
It's a tale told
by an idiot

68
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:37,543
full of sound and fury

69
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,794
signifying...

70
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:41,212
nothing...

71
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:48,761
If you move or speak,
this blows...

72
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:54,267
It's very sensitive...

73
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:56,977
For the next few moments

74
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:59,313
you're going to be closer
to your God

75
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:02,232
than you've ever been...

76
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:07,361
Don't waste it...

77
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:26,922
Early curtain
tonight, everyone...

78
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:29,591
Let's get going...

79
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,635
Help...

80
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,618
What, motherfucker?

81
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:03,789
Jeez,
say something, fool...

82
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:14,049
Hey, Dwayne,
how's the salmonella business?

83
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,885
Hey, Papa Chulo...

84
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:19,137
I got kosher, man...
I got turkey,

85
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:22,682
100%beef, you know,
and all that good stuff...

86
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:26,144
- What, no vegetarian?
- I got vegan, best on the market...

87
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:27,978
Can't tell
the difference...

88
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:30,814
Forget it...
Me, I'm going to go all the way...

89
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:33,359
- 100%beef...
- And lips...

90
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:37,196
It's true... What do you think
they do with the lips, man?

91
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,031
Anus and spleen
and all that stuff...

92
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:42,283
It's all 100%cow...

93
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,327
V ery funny...

94
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:47,288
I'll see you
next week...

95
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:49,040
Give my regards
to your boss...

96
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,591
Man:
Russell?

97
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,093
Has anyone seen Russell?

98
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:04,262
Did you lose
my little darling again?

99
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:07,641
He told me he'd be back by now...
Have you seen him?

100
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:09,767
In the carnal sense?

101
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:12,395
No, not yet...

102
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:15,732
Hey, find the ice queen
rich bitch and you'll find him...

103
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:19,901
- Russell...
- Help...

104
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,320
- Russell?

105
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:24,197
Please don't do this
to me again...

106
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:28,743
Russell you will personally
be responsible for my heart attack...

107
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:32,121
Five minutes, everyone...

108
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:19,290
She's still not
in her seat?

109
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:25,463
He left a message on my cell
10 minutes ago

110
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:27,631
saying he would be here
10 minutes ago...

111
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:31,385
Shit... Okay,
five more minutes, everyone...

112
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:33,929
- Should I be getting dressed?
- Fuck off...

113
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,263
Okay...

114
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:36,556
I'll get dressed anyway,

115
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,308
just in case...

116
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,559
So you want to spot me
another gram?

117
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,977
- It's the weekend...
- Can't do that, Mel...

118
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,062
I got a big day, bro'...

119
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,481
Look, I'm going to tell you
something, man...

120
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,691
My boss is a mean
son of a bitch, all right?

121
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,152
I got kids, you know?

122
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,197
A hundred... I'll give you
the rest Monday... end of day...

123
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,949
Don't be waving that shit
around here, man...

124
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,366
Jesus...

125
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,785
- Hey...
- I swear...

126
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,662
- You the man, Dwayne...
- Whatever...

127
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,023
Hello, Dwayne...

128
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,442
Hey!

129
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:20,986
- Has it been a week already?
- Yeah...

130
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,531
Last performance tonight...
We're having a big party...

131
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:26,700
Yeah?

132
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:29,953
Well, they got some big numbers
coming in from New York next...

133
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:32,080
- Oh, yeah...
- Yeah...

134
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:34,457
Big deal...

135
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:39,838
Oh...

136
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:41,714
Wow...

137
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:47,219
You take care
of yourself, huh?

138
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:54,393
Got a good thing going on,
you and me, huh?

139
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,066
Liberty Wallace...

140
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:04,110
Nice to meet you,
Liberty Wallace...

141
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:06,404
- My name's Joe...
- What could I do for you, Joe?

142
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:08,990
Stand still...

143
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:10,115
Ex cuse me?

144
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:16,038
I'll need you
to pay attention...

145
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:19,166
Look, I'm late for a play...
Who is this?

146
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,751
You mean you're late
for your weekly fuck?

147
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,252
Asshole...

148
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,603
Look, asshole, whoever you are,
if you call one more time...

149
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,480
I didn't expect
to like Russell...

150
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:46,483
But then again, I guess you
didn't expect to like him either...

151
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:47,943
About a half hour?

152
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:53,280
Dwayne had to take a whiz...

153
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,535
...so he needs you
to step in...

154
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,668
What do you want?

155
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:08,503
Calm...

156
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:13,800
Walk over
to the hot dog stand...

157
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,845
You need to be closer...

158
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:29,272
Aah!

159
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:32,150
You need to know
I've locked a signal

160
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:33,985
onto your cell number...

161
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:35,987
There's a bomb,

162
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,323
a really big bomb,

163
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,993
in that hot dog stand...

164
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:45,538
I'll shoot
innocent people...

165
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:48,373
We've got
a bit of ground to cover,

166
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:51,668
so I don't want
to have to kill you...

167
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,128
Walk closer

168
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:55,964
to the stand...

169
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:00,301
If your cell phone
goes dead

170
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:03,721
or you touch the mute button
for any reason, it'll blow...

171
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:05,806
It's irreversible translation...

172
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,267
No off switch...

173
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:10,811
There's enough
explosive in there

174
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:12,563
to take out
the whole block...

175
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,899
So...

176
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,526
you have a little problem
on your hands...

177
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:23,198
Now take a breath...

178
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,075
Liberty, could please
check your battery?

179
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,245
'Cause we need to know
how much time we have...

180
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,164
It's half charged...

181
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:35,918
That gives us
about 80 minutes...

182
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,504
There's a pair of cuffs
hanging on the cart...

183
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,886
You've got quite
a decision to make...

184
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:49,722
Tell me what you want...

185
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:52,016
Your soul...

186
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,726
Fine, name a price...

187
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,936
Do you really think
I'd go through all this trouble

188
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,312
for cash?

189
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:59,731
You're going to have
put on that ankle cuff...

190
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:02,776
Then we're going
to have a talk...

191
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:04,903
Do it...

192
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:08,490
- Do it...
- No!

193
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:09,990
Okay, okay...

194
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:23,587
No...

195
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,590
On your ankle, please...

196
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,936
Tug...
Show me it's secure...

197
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:44,690
Good...

198
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:48,444
Okay, now I'll make
an honest man of myself...

199
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:52,947
Open the top left door
of the cart...

200
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,618
Jesus...

201
00:16:57,702 --> 00:17:00,204
I'm guessing you know
what that is...

202
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:03,874
I take it you have
some political affiliations...

203
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,293
No...

204
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:08,754
That's the problem...

205
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:12,549
I need yours...

206
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,723
Look, we could just cut
to the chase here...

207
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,976
I'm guessing you have a 223...
It's sophisticated...

208
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:26,354
- You mean expensive...
- That too...

209
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:27,897
- Which means you're connected...
- Yeah...

210
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,733
All right, you've got me
standing still... What's next?

211
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,234
Easy...

212
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,945
I get to decide
how this goes down...

213
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:38,949
- I know it's not Russell,

214
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:41,618
because he's backstage
thinking about your future...

215
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:44,454
He's wondering whether you
put your panties back on

216
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,790
and are making
a run for it...

217
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:52,128
I'm sure you're wondering
if I'm working for your husband...

218
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:53,420
I'm not...

219
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:56,381
If he knew about Russell
he'd take it hard

220
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:59,759
and he's a very
violent man...

221
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:01,762
Hey, is Dwayne around?

222
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:05,140
No, he stepped away...

223
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:07,684
Is he going
to be back soon?

224
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:15,817
Did he leave anything
for Frank?

225
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:19,361
Tell him something,
he looks desperate...

226
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:20,779
- No...
- What?

227
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:34,459
No, I don't eat meat...

228
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,627
- Thank you...

229
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:39,088
He thinks you warned him
about the cops...

230
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,427
You having fun, Joe?

231
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:47,137
Yes...

232
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,181
But not like you think...

233
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:54,227
How much do you want?

234
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,896
Nothing...
It's not about cash...

235
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,273
It's about you...

236
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:01,525
You have two choices...

237
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,111
First, you die
an American hero...

238
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:06,113
Second...

239
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:08,782
you die still working
for the fat man...

240
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,367
Look, I have accounts
all over the world...

241
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:12,828
I have unlimited resources...
Tell me how much you want...

242
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:14,871
Is it all champagne
inside that pretty head?

243
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,414
I don't see
where this is going...

244
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:18,875
Ah, Liberty...

245
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,419
Memory lane...

246
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,878
The former you...

247
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:27,216
Life before
the Bulgari handbag...

248
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,759
What happened?

249
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,930
- You know my husband...
- Can't pin this on him...

250
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,016
He's just a thug
working on any side of the law

251
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,559
that'll give out
a check...

252
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,021
By the medals he earned during
his stint with the military,

253
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:42,939
some would say
he's a hero...

254
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:45,191
And what would you say,
Liberty?

255
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:46,859
I don't think
this is about

256
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,278
what I think
of my husband's track record...

257
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:53,032
Do heroes pray for war so that
they can sell their bullets?

258
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,575
We never discuss
our business...

259
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,952
Okay, Liberty...

260
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:59,371
You're in my sightline,

261
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:02,457
you're standing
next to a bomb,

262
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,501
and you're not at liberty
to discuss

263
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:06,919
that you and your husband
manufacture guns

264
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:09,255
and sell them
to any fucking country,

265
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,757
or street asshole,

266
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:15,636
or all-American kid
who'll pay you the cash...

267
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,640
Hooray for
the American dream...

268
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:21,808
If you want something,
ask for it,

269
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,477
otherwise,
I'm just going to hang up...

270
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,729
Go ahead...

271
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:40,743
Is this about
the sale to Poland?

272
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:43,119
- Serbia...
- Poland...

273
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:50,502
Denial is a curious thing...

274
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:53,338
The shipment
never made it to Poland...

275
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:55,966
Serbians, Croats...

276
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:58,175
kids on both sides...

277
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,010
all died...

278
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:01,262
What's the fucking difference?

279
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:03,347
So you were there?

280
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,915
Go on, honey...

281
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,085
Hot dog, please...

282
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,546
Sure... Sure...

283
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:51,600
No mustard...

284
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:06,906
I said no mustard...

285
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:09,241
Cute... Don't make me
pull the trigger...

286
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:12,828
- He's just a kid...
- I have nothing to lose, Liberty...

287
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:15,038
Or haven't you figured
that out yet?

288
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:18,750
Go...

289
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:39,020
You know,
you know a lot about me...

290
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:40,938
What I'm thinking,
who I'm fucking...

291
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:42,481
just amazing, Joe...

292
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:44,400
And I'm your only friend
at this moment...

293
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:46,943
- My final confessor...
- That too...

294
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:49,279
So you whacking off
right now, baby, hmm?

295
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:51,156
Working out some
domination bullshit?

296
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,448
Tread carefully,
dear heart...

297
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:54,658
Why? In this game of yours,
the way I see it,

298
00:22:54,743 --> 00:22:57,287
I die either way...
May as well have some fun...

299
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,123
VP Marketing, McCloud,
standard in American weaponry...

300
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:04,251
Kind of like Beretta is
to the Italians...

301
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:06,128
Ah, so that's
what this is about...

302
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:08,964
Your dilemma is...

303
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:11,383
when to pull the plug...
pull the plug...

304
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:13,050
Who are you going
to take with you?

305
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:14,803
And who are you going
to take with you?

306
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,138
Aah!

307
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:20,432
Man:
What was that?

308
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:24,186
Now...

309
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,064
you've just been shot at
by your best-selling rifle...

310
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:28,607
How does it feel?

311
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:29,983
How's it supposed to feel?

312
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,943
Real...

313
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:34,779
Fine, I'm terrified...
Is that what you want me to say?

314
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:36,155
Well, it's a start...

315
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:38,241
And you've got
a little over an hour

316
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:40,285
to sound like
you really mean it...

317
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:43,704
You want to know what makes me

318
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,372
so twisted?

319
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:48,125
Crazy?

320
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,586
The whyof it all?

321
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,339
It's kind of funny...
Right now I feel absolutely sane...

322
00:23:53,422 --> 00:23:56,633
But I know what it's like
to be twisted and crazy...

323
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:58,718
Something I don't think

324
00:23:58,802 --> 00:24:01,054
that you've
ever experienced...

325
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:03,181
Well, I've had my moments...

326
00:24:03,265 --> 00:24:04,933
Don't compete...

327
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:07,768
You're right, you're probably
crazier than I've ever been...

328
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:15,693
I'll take a long walk,
and then you'll know...

329
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:18,445
I mean, I don't have to...

330
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,697
Good God, he sucks...

331
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:21,948
I can't go out there...

332
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,209
So, you're quite a shot...

333
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:37,129
Yeah... I started
with BBs and squirrels...

334
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:40,883
You're a pretty
crack shot yourself...

335
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:45,429
Well, you know, my father wanted
a competition kid,

336
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:47,388
so I went for the medals...

337
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:51,559
You know what he did to me
the first time he took me

338
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:54,061
out in the bush?

339
00:24:54,104 --> 00:24:58,900
He shot this deer...
The deer had a fawn...

340
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,029
You know
what he made me do?

341
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:07,156
He made me shoot it...

342
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:09,534
Close range...

343
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:11,578
And you pulled
the trigger...

344
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,288
I hated him
for making me do it...

345
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:15,998
- I had nightmares...
- How ironic...

346
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,750
Yeah...

347
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:21,920
Come on, let's get back
to the point...

348
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:24,631
Why are
you doing this, Joe?

349
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:28,134
You must meet
all kinds in your business...

350
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:30,596
- Why do they?
- Come on, I sell corporately...

351
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,180
It's not like I deal
with every asshole

352
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,390
who wants to wave
a big dick at something...

353
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:36,600
So it's about my dick?

354
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,440
What if Russell
slit his wrists?

355
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:45,233
We should call
the police...

356
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:46,819
Slit his wrists?

357
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:49,321
Russell's the happiest man
I've ever met...

358
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:51,990
Happiness is the best cover
for clinical depression...

359
00:25:52,074 --> 00:25:55,076
What? Did he tell you
he was depressed?

360
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,829
The man is dating a barracuda...
What's not to be depressed about?

361
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:06,462
You know, we're in a bit
of a time jam here...

362
00:26:06,504 --> 00:26:08,088
This guessing game's
getting a bit tiring...

363
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:09,756
Why don't you just tell me
what's going on?

364
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:14,803
Fair enough...

365
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:18,432
I want you
to understand loss...

366
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:23,269
You lost someone...

367
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:26,814
to a gun accident?

368
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:29,650
No accident...
A willful act...

369
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:32,278
Premeditated...

370
00:26:33,362 --> 00:26:35,530
Your wife?

371
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,659
Son?

372
00:26:42,121 --> 00:26:43,914
Your daughter...

373
00:26:57,969 --> 00:27:00,346
Look, I'm really sorry
for you and your family,

374
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:02,681
but is this how
she'd want you to act?

375
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:04,599
She's not alive to ask...

376
00:27:05,684 --> 00:27:08,478
Why would you want
more blood on your hands?

377
00:27:08,562 --> 00:27:10,605
Misery needs company...

378
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:14,526
The blood is going
to spill into your hands,

379
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,360
where it belongs,
Liberty...

380
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:19,946
There's hundreds of people
who trade weapons...

381
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:21,448
I'm just one tiny speck
in all of this...

382
00:27:21,532 --> 00:27:23,116
That's all it takes...

383
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,118
Presidents
and three-year-olds die

384
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:26,870
all in the name
of the Constitution...

385
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,706
They have metal detectors
and cops in schools...

386
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,292
Is that what makes
America great?

387
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:34,336
Okay,
I get where this is going...

388
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,879
I'll denounce
my involvement in weapons,

389
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:39,590
I'll denounce
the industry, fuck,

390
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:41,217
I'll denounce death
in general, okay?

391
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:43,386
We'll get the press here,
we'll cause a big scene...

392
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:45,137
Is that what you want?!

393
00:27:45,221 --> 00:27:47,139
You're so full of shit...

394
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:50,559
Look, I know
you must be dying inside,

395
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:52,728
but I'm standing next
to a goddamn bomb,

396
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,646
and it's going to cause
some serious damage...

397
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,066
So if you want coverage,
come on, let's get it going...

398
00:28:00,902 --> 00:28:03,863
What were your father's
last words?

399
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:10,161
He has nothing to do
with this...

400
00:28:10,244 --> 00:28:12,579
Yeah, I guess blowing
your brains out is...

401
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:14,706
is about as much
as anyone person can ever say...

402
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,753
You seem to know a lot
about me and my family, Joe...

403
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:23,047
It's personal...

404
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:26,426
And I get to atone
for the sins

405
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:28,927
of every cheap-suit
fucking gun salesman?

406
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,179
Yeah, and your father...

407
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:34,600
He has nothing
to do with this... Fuck you!

408
00:28:34,642 --> 00:28:36,643
This has nothing to do
with my father...

409
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:38,728
This is about you
going postal!

410
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:42,190
He's part
of the family legacy...

411
00:28:42,274 --> 00:28:43,358
Bullshit!
He is not...

412
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:45,193
- He is not!
- You were an impressionable kid...

413
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:47,195
His money bought you
into a society

414
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,656
on both sides
of the law...

415
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:51,448
He's definitely
a part of this...

416
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:53,534
No he isn't...

417
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:09,424
Try that $5, 000 watch
you're wearing...

418
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:13,719
- Fine...
- Oh, better yet,

419
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:16,221
that $25, 000
wedding ring...

420
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:17,472
You got it...

421
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:21,685
Say, honey...

422
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,785
Where's Dwayne,
Ms... Liberty Wallace?

423
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:41,995
Oh, he had to step away...
I'm watching the stand...

424
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,418
You doing this
for a reason?

425
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:52,464
You tell him,
I shoot him...

426
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:57,676
It's hot today...

427
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,429
His life is
in your hands, Liberty...

428
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:01,263
Put your clothes on...

429
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:02,931
Yeah! I'll take whatever
you're selling...

430
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:05,476
Beat it...

431
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,853
A hot dog for the road...

432
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:09,062
Oops...

433
00:30:11,357 --> 00:30:14,026
- Good for sales...
- I said beat it!

434
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,444
All right...

435
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:19,781
Whatever you're on, lady,
get more of it...

436
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:33,961
You're pissing me off...

437
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:36,462
I'll be right back...

438
00:30:36,547 --> 00:30:38,298
Uh-huh...

439
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:41,384
You're signing
his death warrant...

440
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:42,802
Is that what you want?

441
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:56,565
It's show time...

442
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,988
Your actions
have consequences...

443
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,799
You shot him?
God, you shot him...

444
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,718
He's dying as we speak...

445
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,930
Tell me what you want...

446
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,266
For one,
your company just made

447
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,269
a deal worth
several million dollars...

448
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,769
You're not going
to deliver...

449
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:52,200
Officer,
are you all right?

450
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:54,744
Oh my God...

451
00:31:59,832 --> 00:32:01,500
Hello?

452
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:04,211
Yeah, there's an officer here...
He's bleeding...

453
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:08,131
I don't know, I think
the corner of 9th and Grace?

454
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,344
Fuck him he was a bad cop...

455
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:13,928
That dick did it
on the take...

456
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:15,972
My name?

457
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:18,266
It's George...

458
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:22,770
McCannister...
I'm just standing here,

459
00:32:22,854 --> 00:32:23,896
I don't really want...

460
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,357
Yeah, I'll wait...

461
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,858
I guess...

462
00:32:27,942 --> 00:32:30,944
A fucking lot of people
are about to arrive...

463
00:32:31,028 --> 00:32:33,488
This is your window
of opportunity, Liberty...

464
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,865
- Let's call your husband...
- No, don't...

465
00:32:35,949 --> 00:32:38,784
- I'll three-way you...
- Don't!

466
00:32:40,412 --> 00:32:42,789
McCloud Industries, Victor Wallace's office...

467
00:32:42,872 --> 00:32:44,998
- Yes, is he there, please?
- May I say who's calling?

468
00:32:46,668 --> 00:32:48,503
- Liberty...
- Ex cuse me?

469
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:51,922
His wife...
I'm calling for his wife,

470
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,882
who asked me to call

471
00:32:53,966 --> 00:32:56,843
because she's
in a bit of a jam right now...

472
00:32:56,885 --> 00:32:58,469
Secretary:
Please hold...

473
00:33:01,723 --> 00:33:03,224
Make a copy
and distribute it

474
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:05,184
to code red
level security...

475
00:33:05,227 --> 00:33:07,228
Mr... Wallace, your wife is on the line, sir...

476
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:13,442
- What's up, Lib?
- She's on the other line...

477
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:15,444
We're conferenced...

478
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:16,862
And who is this?

479
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:20,699
I'm Joe... Your wife's cuffed
to a bomb wired to blow

480
00:33:20,783 --> 00:33:22,951
if the cell phone dies...

481
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:25,203
I've also got one of your rifles
pointed at her

482
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,455
so I can shoot her

483
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,291
or anyone else I figure
isn't working out...

484
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,709
Liberty?

485
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,467
Oops... Is he always
that sympathetic?

486
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,427
He probably thinks
you're a terrorist...

487
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:44,387
Terrorist?

488
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,098
Why is that?

489
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:49,058
Because of the deals
you cut with Senator Tollman?

490
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:51,227
Government involvement
is classified...

491
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:53,437
Hey, they're
on their way, all right?

492
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:54,730
Just hold on a second...

493
00:33:54,773 --> 00:33:57,734
Your husband
just hung up on you...

494
00:33:57,817 --> 00:33:59,735
That's because he thought
he was protecting me...

495
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:03,197
We signed a no-deals policy
so we wouldn't be vulnerable

496
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,865
to every...
every fucking terrorist...

497
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,076
It was a condition
for the military...

498
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:10,244
Oh, please...
What does signing a contract

499
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:12,247
really have to do with it?

500
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:17,084
Don't answer...

501
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,255
- Liberty?
- Hey, it's me...

502
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,716
It's for real... I'm at the corner
of 9th and Grace...

503
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,593
I have about 45 minutes
left on my battery...

504
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:30,097
Liberty, talk to me...
Any idea who we're dealing with?

505
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,514
No...

506
00:34:38,105 --> 00:34:40,440
He said something about us
bailing on a deal...

507
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:42,567
I don't know
what he's talking about...

508
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:45,069
The onlyone big enough
is the one going through Paris...

509
00:34:45,153 --> 00:34:47,238
- Nothing more specific?
- No!

510
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:48,363
I don't get it...

511
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:50,031
How did you leave it
with Washington?

512
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:52,076
Done...
The money's wired...

513
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,618
What does he want?
Hijack the shipment?

514
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:54,702
What does he want?

515
00:34:56,955 --> 00:34:58,748
I don't know what he wants!

516
00:34:58,832 --> 00:35:01,292
He won't tell me...

517
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:03,711
- This could be goodbye...
- Don't get dramatic...

518
00:35:03,795 --> 00:35:05,630
If they wanted you dead,
you would be...

519
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:07,590
I'm hanging up now...
I'm on it...

520
00:35:07,632 --> 00:35:11,135
- I don't fucking believe you...
- If you do that again...

521
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:15,055
I'll shoot innocent people
on your behalf...

522
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:22,145
Oh, he didn't even
say goodbye, did he?

523
00:35:22,229 --> 00:35:26,149
Well, he's got
a lot at stake...

524
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,735
International arms dealing
is tricky business...

525
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:30,194
No loy alties...

526
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:39,703
Call Brian...

527
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:43,915
- I already did...
- Oh, good boy...

528
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:46,000
V ery good boy...

529
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:50,004
This is a hostage situation...
Your hands are tied...

530
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,883
What am I supposed
to do now,

531
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,843
go and sip tea
in a safehouse

532
00:35:55,927 --> 00:35:57,636
while my wife is
chained to a bomb?

533
00:35:57,678 --> 00:35:59,471
Calm down...

534
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:02,099
You're a target too...
She knows the drill...

535
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:04,143
You both signed
the security agreement...

536
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:07,520
- The machinery just kicked in...
- I'm calm... I'm very calm...

537
00:36:09,523 --> 00:36:11,649
Shit...

538
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:15,653
Step away...

539
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,321
Did you see what happened here?

540
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:18,906
I didn't see anything...

541
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,825
1986 request backup...
Request immediate backup...

542
00:36:21,868 --> 00:36:23,994
Shots fired, officer down,
possibly dead...

543
00:36:24,078 --> 00:36:25,913
Oh my God...
He's barely got a pulse...

544
00:36:25,996 --> 00:36:28,748
Do you have
an open marriage,

545
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:31,334
or is it all just pretend
from the beginning?

546
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:33,211
I'm sure this isn't
about our marriage...

547
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:36,339
But I'm the last person you're
going to speak to on this Earth,

548
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:39,217
so might as well
tell me everything...

549
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,927
- He'll hunt you down...
- He might hunt you down...

550
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:44,471
You just became
a security risk...

551
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:47,766
You know, they took out JFK
over the price of oil,

552
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,353
so I'd say your chances
of being a military target

553
00:36:51,437 --> 00:36:53,063
are pretty high...

554
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:55,565
Like you said,
the stakes are high...

555
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:58,151
This is all more important
than an individual...

556
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:01,070
Am I right? Is that what
you tell yourself every day?

557
00:37:01,154 --> 00:37:06,116
I'm only a cog
in the great wheel of misfortune...

558
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,118
That's the way it is...

559
00:37:08,202 --> 00:37:11,496
How did you
end up here?

560
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,249
How the fuck
did that happen?

561
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:17,502
I can make a deal
or break one...

562
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:18,837
I have myown connections...

563
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:21,006
Get back to your
little theater gig,

564
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:23,799
backstage every Thursday...

565
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:26,344
body guards, off limits,
of course...

566
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,140
Do you pretend,
it's passion,

567
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:34,560
or is it like
taking Prozac?

568
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,270
Leave Russell out of this...

569
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:46,112
He better be dead, or I swear
to God I'm going to kill him...

570
00:37:46,154 --> 00:37:48,114
Call his publicist...

571
00:37:48,198 --> 00:37:50,241
She'll know where
he's hiding...

572
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:51,617
You're on, folks...

573
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:58,707
Name your terms, Joe...

574
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:03,044
This is about dignity...

575
00:38:04,671 --> 00:38:06,714
My daughter's death
robbed her of hers,

576
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:10,468
You're going to dredge up whatever
little nobility you have left...

577
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,805
and give the world a little
of what she had...

578
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:19,059
Can't believe
she'd want this...

579
00:38:21,354 --> 00:38:23,063
She was a fighter...

580
00:38:25,357 --> 00:38:27,317
Unlike you,

581
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,819
I wasn't...

582
00:38:29,862 --> 00:38:32,322
I had to make a choice...

583
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:36,492
Jump out the window,

584
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:38,953
or live by the rules
that she died by...

585
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:41,038
What happened to her?

586
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:45,125
A boy in her school...

587
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:47,669
Armed and fucked up...

588
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:51,840
Headlines that make every
mommy and daddy in America

589
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:53,341
cross their fingers...

590
00:38:53,383 --> 00:38:56,344
Ah, but for the grace
of God go I...

591
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,849
So...

592
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:07,271
now I'm using the same right
to bear arms that he had...

593
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:11,358
It's an all-in package,
I was told...

594
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,362
And you can't fuck with freedom...

595
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:18,573
to quote a phrase...

596
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:20,158
How do you know that?

597
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:22,577
What?
Your father's last words...

598
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:25,371
Ah... Brilliant...

599
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:28,165
Brilliant way to go out,
I thought...

600
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:30,042
In fact, it's...

601
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,962
it was what made me choose
you as the spokesperson...

602
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:36,089
Nobody knew what
my dad's note said...

603
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:41,761
Just fucking shoot me...

604
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:43,930
Get it over with,
I'm sick of your bullshit...

605
00:39:57,234 --> 00:39:59,069
How do you know
so much about me?

606
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:00,946
I'm good with details...

607
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,407
Nobody knew
what was in that note, Joe...

608
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:06,367
Only the cops,
it was a long time ago,

609
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:07,868
the files are filed...

610
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:11,456
Unless you're a cop...
Is that it?

611
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,667
What makes you think
you should do this?

612
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:16,586
You don't have kids,
so you don't know...

613
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:22,424
God...

614
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:25,677
Bless America,

615
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:27,470
Just give us a minute,
stay there...

616
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:30,723
What do you make of that?

617
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:33,268
Stand beside her...

618
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:34,435
Psy ch ward...

619
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,062
She may have seen something...

620
00:40:36,104 --> 00:40:37,605
I'll check it out...

621
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:42,109
Hey, get back here...

622
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:46,864
I don't want them
getting any closer...

623
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,531
What do you got
your hands in the air for?

624
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,283
Don't come any closer...

625
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:53,995
Looks like your husband
sent some goons

626
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,788
to protect you
and your relationships...

627
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:58,458
He has Washington,
the Middle East,

628
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,168
the Mayor's office,
the police, the mob...

629
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:04,963
You guys work on
all sides of the fence...

630
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:06,590
Must be hard to keep track...

631
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:07,716
Did you see what
happened over there?

632
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,968
This is really about Victor...

633
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,427
You're a package...

634
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:12,512
What?

635
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,473
Now it's time
to make your deal with God...

636
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,183
- You all right?
- Say no...

637
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,310
His walkie signal
is a bad thing

638
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,645
for sensitive explosives
detonators...

639
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,523
Get back!

640
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,523
There's a bomb
in here...

641
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,524
Did she say bomb?

642
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,817
So...

643
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,818
The chick's a looney...

644
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,488
