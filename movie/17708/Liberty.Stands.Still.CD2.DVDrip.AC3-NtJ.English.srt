1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,040
Why all the sudden
the change of heart?

2
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:10,709
Because a cop is down...

3
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,169
Then you can help...

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:14,546
You're the only one
I'll let her talk to...

5
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:16,130
She saw it all...

6
00:00:17,507 --> 00:00:19,508
One Adam 18, Alameda and 11th...

7
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:21,135
ETA, 12 minutes...

8
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:24,388
Bill!

9
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:26,056
Jesus Christ Bill...
Get back here...

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,641
The bomb squad's
on the way...

11
00:00:27,683 --> 00:00:30,685
I got a guyon the cell phone,
tells me she's got the whole story...

12
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:31,687
Son of a bitch...

13
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:32,688
Wait until he gets back here...

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,522
No one... not you, not us...
goes over there...

15
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:36,149
I swear to God
I'll take you down, Bill...

16
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,192
Now get back here...

17
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:52,831
Welcome to our party...

18
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:54,207
We're conferenced...

19
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,043
A-team, Liberty Wallace,

20
00:00:57,085 --> 00:01:00,046
please let me introduce
you to Bill Tollman...

21
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,215
We're lucky to have
Bill join us...

22
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:05,550
He's ambitious, smart,
and for the most part...

23
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,553
honest...

24
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:08,971
I'm sorry...

25
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:10,180
And you are?

26
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:12,432
I'm Joe...
I'm out for vengeance...

27
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:14,684
Liberty needs forgiveness...

28
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,143
And we both need publicity...

29
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:17,520
Why me?

30
00:01:17,562 --> 00:01:19,188
Your lucky day...

31
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:21,732
Why don't you bring
him up to speed, Liberty?

32
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:25,194
He's got a military-issue,
sniper rifle pointed right at you...

33
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:26,779
He's an ex cellent shot...

34
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:30,824
There's a bomb
in the hot dog cart...

35
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:33,743
It's set to blow, if my cell phone
battery dies, for any reason...

36
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:35,953
The bomb's big enough
to blow up this entire block...

37
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:37,372
Think Oklahoma...

38
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:39,540
That theater's going to let out
in less than an hour...

39
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:41,375
I have less than an hour
left on my battery...

40
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,589
I die either way...

41
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,716
Unless you get out
of here soon, so do you...

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,218
Aren't you
the Liberty Wallace of...

43
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:53,387
Yes...

44
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,014
Any demands?

45
00:01:58,475 --> 00:01:59,517
He wants...

46
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:08,066
He wants somebody to pay
for the death of his daughter...

47
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,819
Almost right...

48
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,282
Joe's daughter, died...

49
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:18,409
from a fucked up kid
with a gun...

50
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:24,082
It was a gun manufactured
by my company...

51
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,460
He wants me to die,
knowing I have blood on my hands...

52
00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:34,091
Joe, you've got to rethink here...

53
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:35,842
This is crazy...

54
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:37,343
There's a real gun
pointed at you...

55
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:40,096
What I mean is,
there are other ways,

56
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:41,138
Uh-huh...

57
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:43,348
That's where you
come in, Bill...

58
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:47,353
You want me to use
my influence as a journalist,

59
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:49,854
to debate the right
to bear arms with you,

60
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,940
because you've got
a gun pointed at me?

61
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,402
I'm standing next to a bomb
that's on final countdown...

62
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:56,527
Yeah...

63
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:00,740
What happens when
all this is over?

64
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:03,159
I blow my brains out...

65
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:06,495
This becomes my journalistic
moment of truth...

66
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,915
Your Emmy...

67
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,834
And your quest...

68
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,877
I'm sorry, Joe...
What do you want me to say here?

69
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,337
Say yes...

70
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,840
No... Say that you're
accountable...

71
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,508
Say yes...

72
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,721
There are plenty
of causes, Joe...

73
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:29,725
Bill, look at Liberty...

74
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:31,851
She's going to die...

75
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:33,228
It's her choice when,

76
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:34,938
it's my choice how...

77
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,190
You have a similar dilemma...

78
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:38,608
Now,

79
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:39,609
Iook around...

80
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:43,571
Jesus, shit...

81
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:48,659
He shot me...

82
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:50,202
I'll do whatever
he wants...

83
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:52,704
He's going to die
in your arms, Liberty...

84
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:53,705
Get ready...

85
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:55,331
Watching someone die...

86
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:58,209
changes you forever...

87
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:03,213
19-86...

88
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:05,842
to Dispatch...
We have a female with a gun...

89
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:08,302
I'm not dying...

90
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,971
His father is
Senator Robert Tollman...

91
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,015
He's also
a constitutional lawyer...

92
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:14,474
He lobbied for the NRA,

93
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,726
so we know which side
his bread is buttered on...

94
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,353
He's proud of his son...

95
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:21,731
And now like me,

96
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:25,234
has every reason
to switch sides...

97
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:26,360
Hey...

98
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:31,240
How many times
do I have to tell you?

99
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:33,241
Turn that fucking
thing off...

100
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:38,913
Just hang on...
Help's coming...

101
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:41,750
No... It's not...

102
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,375
- Fucking asshole...
- Sue me...

103
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,753
Get him out of here...

104
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,177
Can't buy this
kind of press...

105
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,178
10:00 news, buddy...

106
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,847
Call my father for me...

107
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:31,795
Why are you doing this?

108
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,880
Why?

109
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:35,465
Why are you doing this?

110
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,217
Tell me...

111
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:41,929
Your dick is the size of
the little trigger on that gun...

112
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,598
That makes you
nothing, Joe...

113
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,558
You're less
than nothing...

114
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:48,352
You probably didn't
even have a daughter,

115
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:49,937
if you did,
she's better off dead...

116
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:58,028
I'll forgive you
for that,

117
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,823
given the circumstances...

118
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,200
Just kill me...

119
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:05,785
- Get it over with...
- Shut up...

120
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:06,911
I'm not the one shooting...

121
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:07,995
I can't take anymore...

122
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:12,916
I'm going to hang up...

123
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:21,174
That asshole's shooting
with a... 9 millimeter,

124
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:23,718
He hasn't got a hope
of hitting you from that distance...

125
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:27,429
Ah, Victor...

126
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,889
You have made my day...

127
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,308
Hello...

128
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,528
It's kind of ironic,

129
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,446
me saving your life...

130
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,830
They're here...

131
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:14,347
The officer went down
over there...

132
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:16,934
The lady with the bomb
is across the street...

133
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,021
It's time to do something...

134
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:24,441
Bill has a tape recorder,
in his suit pocket...

135
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:26,901
Name names,
Liberty...

136
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:28,611
Blow the lobbies wide open...

137
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,655
Payoffs are always
good news breakers...

138
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:32,030
You're an amateur, Joe...

139
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:34,366
No... No... No... Don't tell me that
you're worried about the fallout...

140
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,534
Your husband, or someone
he works for,

141
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:39,412
has or dered the CIA thugs
to put a bullet in you...

142
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:40,872
Is that the world
you want to live in?

143
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:42,331
What do you think
you can accomplish

144
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,251
by me babbling about Senator-this
and Senator-that?

145
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:46,752
That's not going
to do anything...

146
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:47,753
It's a start...

147
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:49,588
It's an end, Joe...

148
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,133
Let me do what
I can really do...

149
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,636
Let me work
from the inside...

150
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:57,011
I can...
I can...

151
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,473
I can do something...

152
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:03,434
So that's what
you tell yourself every morning?

153
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:05,478
Joe, I can really
change things...

154
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:07,522
I promise you
I'll do it...

155
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:08,689
I promise...

156
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:20,826
Police...
Put them down...

157
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,286
Come on...

158
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:26,414
Come on...

159
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,003
We can always count on our nation's
finest to serve and protect...

160
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:35,464
Shots fired... I've got
a civilian down possibly dead...

161
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,465
Looks like a shooter...

162
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:53,772
Senator Libby

163
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:56,149
took at least
three payments in cash...

164
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:59,777
Senator Lipton, Crick,
Congressmen Gomez...

165
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:02,197
Check Geneva bank accounts,

166
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,657
Swiss Union bank accounts,

167
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,324
Cayman Islands, Bahamas...

168
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:07,409
My husband...

169
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:10,788
Victor Wallace is fucking
the president's wife,

170
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,164
among others...

171
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:13,582
Presidents...

172
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,583
or wives?

173
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:15,667
Humph...

174
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:18,795
What do you want me to do?

175
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:20,838
Nothing...
You're on a roll...

176
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:21,798
Keep it going...

177
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,841
You're already
on the news...

178
00:09:23,884 --> 00:09:27,679
Victor's mobilized
every senator I've just mentioned...

179
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:29,763
The police chief is
in his back pocket...

180
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:33,601
He supplies the gang that controls
this corner, for Christ's sake...

181
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:37,980
He?

182
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,772
Okay... I...

183
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:41,316
We...

184
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:42,775
I...

185
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,694
I'm in this, okay?

186
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:46,487
Is that what you want me
to say, "I'm in it"?

187
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,990
Yes...

188
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:53,202
Now, who are you
going to trust?

189
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:54,870
Nobody...

190
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,248
- Keep talking...
- No...

191
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,334
I'll name names,
I'll bury everyone who deserves it,

192
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,336
but you have to shut
this bomb off...

193
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:05,922
Uhh... can't...

194
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,507
Then I can't...

195
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:08,758
Fair enough...

196
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,760
You've done
your job anyway...

197
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,346
Now we can depend
on Bill's dad, the senator,

198
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:15,348
and his newfound quest...

199
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,350
He'll go down
as a hero for the cause...

200
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:22,854
It was a life well spent...

201
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,772
In the big picture...

202
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:37,367
Have a hot dog...

203
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,870
You don't want to go out
on an empty stomach...

204
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:42,664
Let them take
him away...

205
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:06,894
Ma'am...

206
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:08,855
Come with me, ma'am...

207
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:11,733
Over here...

208
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:13,651
Woman:
Every Thursday,

209
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:14,402
they meet backstage,

210
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,570
go into Russell's dressing room,
and lock the door...

211
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:18,447
They order in...

212
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,661
Bastard changed
the lock...

213
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:25,704
Fuck...

214
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,252
Yeah, she slinks out
sometime during the night,

215
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:36,088
and we don't see Russell again
until the next performance...

216
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:48,474
Oh... Ex cept for tonight...

217
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:50,768
He's probably in there,
fucked to death...

218
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,269
Uh-oh...

219
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,855
Time to call a locksmith...

220
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:56,315
Back up's coming in from 53...

221
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,317
Look's like we've got
ourselves a sniper...

222
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:00,068
There's no I... D...
on the woman,

223
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,444
no trace on her cell phone yet...

224
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,654
If she's chained to the stand...

225
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:05,282
She told officers
there was a bomb, all right?

226
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:07,283
We believe she's working
with the sniper...

227
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:09,910
The man on the ground out there,
is a reporter with KNBS...

228
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,038
Bill Tollman,
the senator's son...

229
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,498
We believe shot...

230
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:16,500
We have a confirmed fatality
in a parking structure back here...

231
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,001
We don't have enough
information on that yet,

232
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:21,380
but we can't rule out terrorists,
militia, or just a basic nutcase...

233
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:24,215
We're going to block
5th to 10th, Olive to Berry...

234
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:26,467
We've got at least 20 buildings
to evacuate...

235
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:27,635
We're thin on manpower...

236
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:30,012
Use uniforms to back you up...

237
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:32,015
All right?
Be safe, gentlemen... Let's go...

238
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:36,602
Swat member:
Captain...

239
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:38,687
We've got no location
on the shooter,

240
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,647
No I... D... on the woman...
We've got backup coming in...

241
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:41,898
We're set up in the garage
back here...

242
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:44,400
Somebody shut them down...
Jesus...

243
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:47,779
Clear the media back, please...

244
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,952
We are live...

245
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:58,580
The drama continues
in downtown LA,

246
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:00,999
where we apparently have
a fatal shooting of an officer,

247
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,917
here at the corner
of Grace and 9th...

248
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,002
Is your wife going
to be tuning in?

249
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:05,837
No...

250
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,005
But I guarantee
your husband's watching...

251
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,090
Back to you, Dennis...

252
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:12,844
My husband...

253
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:17,473
My husband's on the way
to the airport by now...

254
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:20,601
He will be unreachable
for comment...

255
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:25,730
Why'd you marry him?

256
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:28,066
I thought he could save
my father's company...

257
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,611
It was a bad idea...

258
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:33,321
I even thought I loved him...

259
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:36,782
Should we do a shield rescue
for the guyon the ground?

260
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:38,784
No... It's too risky until
we find out where the shooter is...

261
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:41,620
Poor bastard's gonna
bleed out...

262
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,414
I want all traffic locked down

263
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,873
from 5th to 9th...

264
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:46,916
Yeah, that's done already...

265
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,753
Who's the negotiator on call?

266
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:51,087
John's going to be here
in 10 minutes, Captain...

267
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,590
Joe, more death isn't going
to make the guns disappear,

268
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:55,716
it's not going to bring
your daughter back...

269
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,219
I'm begging you...

270
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:00,304
Oh... Liberty...

271
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,640
Tiananmen Square
boiled down to one man,

272
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:06,810
standing in front of a tank,
that couldn't move or shoot...

273
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:09,563
Because human dignity
was stronger

274
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:10,938
than steel or bullets...

275
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:11,940
It changed a nation...

276
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:14,400
That was a completely
different situation...

277
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:15,943
What's the difference?

278
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:17,694
We've got gated communities,

279
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,573
security systems, and kids
carrying combat weapons,

280
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:22,449
all because most people

281
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,284
haven't even
read the 2nd amendment...

282
00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:25,285
So,

283
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:26,578
our freedom of speech,

284
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,996
is protected,

285
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,582
as long as we don't piss off
a guy with a gun...

286
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:33,250
I'm not brave enough
to take a bullet for my country...

287
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,960
You underestimate yourself...

288
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:38,171
The one thing
that guarantees our freedom,

289
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:41,508
and independence,
is responsibility...

290
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:45,595
We lost that somewhere between
Vietnam and presidential blowjobs...

291
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:49,349
Manyof the Fathers
of the Constitution...

292
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:52,310
had slaves,
but they wrote a document,

293
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:53,895
about freedom...

294
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,896
Go figure...

295
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:59,691
So you see,
things are meant to change...

296
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,235
We're all grown up now...

297
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,113
So are you, Liberty...

298
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,865
I think you've figured out

299
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,326
there's no such thing

300
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,536
as a politically correct gun...

301
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,455
I'll say all
that to the press...

302
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,956
But please turn
this bomb off, Joe...

303
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,042
I don't know what to do next...

304
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,796
It feels like
this whole thing was a dream...

305
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,964
I should have told
you before, but I...

306
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,842
What do we do now?

307
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:54,325
Huh...

308
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:00,998
The cops have...

309
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,000
G-36's...

310
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,835
Did you make that deal too?

311
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:06,503
It was more of a donation...

312
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:08,672
I'll bet that you were a hero...

313
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:11,007
We got a big luncheon,

314
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:13,676
key to the city,
mayor in my pocket,

315
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,721
- You make it sound so easy...
- If you've got the cash flow,

316
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:18,221
a little planning
goes a long way...

317
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:20,974
Did they know
you had just sold 26 stripped down

318
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:23,393
P-99's that went
straight to the streets?

319
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:26,730
I guess it was one of those
an-eye-for-an-eye deals...

320
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,982
It's easy to get lost
in a deal...

321
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,193
I know it's not an ex cuse...

322
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:36,071
This is a perfect
fucking nightmare...

323
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:38,991
127 locations
for an asshole with a gun...

324
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:41,368
We've got a cell phone
we can't bust into,

325
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,577
and a bomb next
to a theater...

326
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:43,704
Anybody picking up
in there yet?

327
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:45,539
- Just voicemail...
- Fucking voicemail...

328
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:51,628
Well...

329
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,213
the shooter is back...

330
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,216
Who's he work for?

331
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:57,758
Your husband
or the CIA?

332
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:00,886
Whoever's got the cash...

333
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,692
Who's the cowboy
in the chopper?

334
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,110
Get him higher,
he's surveillance...

335
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:19,695
I don't want him
landing on the fucking rooftop...

336
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,117
Okay, you guys,
let's get in here...

337
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,118
Let's get
into the theater...

338
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,912
I should have told you
before, but I...

339
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:33,166
What do we do now?

340
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,751
It's up to you...

341
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,585
Do you still love me?

342
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:39,380
Of course I do...

343
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:42,133
How about you?

344
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:43,259
Of course...

345
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:46,845
It won't make
a bit of difference...

346
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:55,644
How full is the theater?

347
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:57,230
It's the last performance...

348
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:11,075
I figure 10
to clear the building,

349
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,452
Copy that...
No one exits the front door...

350
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,079
Hold until we've cleared
all rear exits...

351
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:31,970
Senator Tollman's son
was just shot,

352
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:34,180
by the same guy
who's got Liberty...

353
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,686
I'm calling your husband...

354
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,354
Why?

355
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:50,737
Yeah...

356
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,531
Who called the militia?

357
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,492
I want to talk
to Liberty...

358
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:57,910
Touching...

359
00:18:57,994 --> 00:18:59,954
It's not one of yours?

360
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,914
That's not good,
Victor...

361
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:02,998
Liberty are you there?

362
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:05,667
Such a sweet name,
don't you think?

363
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:07,377
Her parents
were Republican...

364
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:09,796
I want to talk
to my wife...

365
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,297
I'm here...

366
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:12,840
Alive...

367
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:14,884
And on TV...

368
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:17,553
I... uh...

369
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:20,389
I know, you're doing
what you have to do...

370
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:26,645
You know who's calling
the shots?

371
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:28,313
The president's wife?

372
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:31,149
Come on...

373
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:35,862
No, of course not...
If it were, you'd be standing here...

374
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:44,203
I'm doing what I can, but...

375
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:47,081
You know the rules, right?

376
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:49,583
Aw, honey,

377
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,210
fuck you...

378
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,294
Joe, hang up...

379
00:19:53,378 --> 00:19:55,671
No, what she meant is,

380
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:57,841
why don't you let her die
with some dignity?

381
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:07,850
Get the car...

382
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,768
- Mr... Wallace is leaving...
- Yes, sir...

383
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,775
Right through here...
Right this way...

384
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:18,901
Through here...

385
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:25,199
How do you know Victor?

386
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:26,409
Classified...

387
00:20:28,953 --> 00:20:30,871
Keep moving this way...
Come on, let's go!

388
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:32,914
- Copy that...
- Who the fuck is she?

389
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,666
We just I... D... 'd her,
Liberty Wallace...

390
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,252
the VP of McCloud,
married to the CEO,

391
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,170
connections up the wazoo...

392
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:42,131
Jesus Christ...
I know him... Victor...

393
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:44,174
Yeah, we're trying
to track him down right now...

394
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:47,177
Then there's no way she's
with the shooter, she's a hostage...

395
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,806
So I'm bait...

396
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:53,307
No, more like...

397
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:57,145
more like a showpiece...

398
00:20:57,187 --> 00:21:00,189
I like your reckless side...

399
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:04,110
You travel without your body guard,

400
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:07,195
five hours every
week and sometimes twice...

401
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,866
You're a little bit more
accessible and predictable

402
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,284
than the president's wife...

403
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:15,578
So, who's pissed off
at Victor, the president?

404
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,129
No...

405
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:30,258
It's all me this time...

406
00:21:33,178 --> 00:21:34,762
I was a dad...

407
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:37,515
I'm not anymore...

408
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:44,104
Somebody's pulling your string...
Who is it?

409
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,607
No one...

410
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,485
Not now...

411
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:53,655
Never thought my skills from
my former life would ever payoff...

412
00:21:55,324 --> 00:21:56,741
CIA?

413
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:02,329
Well...

414
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,916
that too...

415
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,084
Come on,
if I'm gonna die

416
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:10,546
I have the right to know
my assassin a little better...

417
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,965
I worked covert...

418
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,843
covert operations for the CIA...

419
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:20,096
I was in China
during Tiananmen Square,

420
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,225
Cuba, Panama,
and I was in Columbia...

421
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,353
when my daughter was killed...

422
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,168
This is Captain Hank Wilford...

423
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:56,004
Could you tell us
what this is about?

424
00:22:58,423 --> 00:23:01,342
I don't want anyone else to die
because they're talking to me...

425
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:02,885
So, what's it gonna be?

426
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:03,969
Huh-uh-uh...

427
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:05,345
It's your show, baby...

428
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,556
Just leave me out of this for now...

429
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,436
There's a bomb
in the hot dog cart!

430
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:17,773
It's set to blow
when my cell phone dies...

431
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:19,901
In about 15 minutes...

432
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:23,112
I'm chained to the cart...

433
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,240
What are the demands?

434
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:32,037
A public debate
of the 2nd amendment...

435
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:33,705
- Hmm...
- Heard of it?

436
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:34,915
Go, girl...

437
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,333
I'd like to understand,

438
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,335
are there any other demands?

439
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,170
Can I come closer?

440
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,172
Any other demands?

441
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:44,799
No...

442
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,259
No!

443
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,227
Liberty,

444
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,479
I will kill anyone who comes close...

445
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,564
We have no confirmation yet,

446
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,483
but it appears that
KNBS reporter, Bill Tollman

447
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:05,901
has been seriously hurt...

448
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:08,320
And that Liberty Wallace
of McCloud Guns

449
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:10,948
is demanding a public debate
about the constitution,

450
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,492
and its role
in our violent times...

451
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:16,452
She's grandstanding,
got to be militia...

452
00:24:16,495 --> 00:24:17,537
Sir...

453
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:19,747
Yeah...
Yes, sir...

454
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:21,290
Yes, sir, Liberty Wallace...

455
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,668
You were good
under the pressure...

456
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:25,587
And the whole world
will applaud you...

457
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,630
Or laugh at me...

458
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:29,798
The press is the least
of my concerns at this point...

459
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,383
I'll try to move them back, but...

460
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:35,470
Yes, sir...
I'll move them back right away...

461
00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:36,638
Thank you, sir...

462
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,515
Get rid of the press...
Tell them it's a safety issue...

463
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,308
Uptown doesn't want this thing
under a microscope...

464
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,976
They're gonna make a move, Joe...

465
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,061
They'll never disarm that bomb...

466
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:46,021
They probably already guessed that...

467
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:48,732
You won't be alone
in the final moment...

468
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:53,654
Status on the theater?

469
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:55,446
Somebody welded
all the side exits shut...

470
00:24:55,531 --> 00:24:56,490
We've got an
entering team coming in,

471
00:24:56,573 --> 00:24:58,866
- But the fire department...
- Is stuck in traffic...

472
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:01,536
- All exits?
- Yeah, our cutters won't work...

473
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,955
The only exit is onto the street,
and through the front door...

474
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:06,623
So in effect they're hostages...

475
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:18,843
Tell me about
your daughter again...

476
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:31,230
A boy at school
put a gun to her head,

477
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,232
and asked her

478
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:35,066
if she believed in God...

479
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,486
What did she say?

480
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,153
I don't know...

481
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,114
What did she say?

482
00:25:41,198 --> 00:25:42,741
I don't know...

483
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:51,540
Is that robot ready to go?

484
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:52,958
It'll be here in 15...

485
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:54,376
Wilford:
What about the bomb truck?

486
00:25:54,418 --> 00:25:57,337
We've got one coming in from the 48...
ETA... 30 minutes...

487
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:58,380
General evacuation?

488
00:25:58,422 --> 00:25:59,798
We've got a full retreat going...

489
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:02,758
We'll find this son of a bitch...
It'll just take a little time...

490
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:04,052
Tell me about your father...

491
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,434
My father...

492
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:21,568
He was my hero...

493
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:27,281
He was...

494
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:35,456
After he...

495
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,999
you know...

496
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:45,256
I had to leave school
to earn a living...

497
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:47,550
One thing led to the next...

498
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:52,095
I found my self working
in the family business

499
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:53,889
that was no longer family-owned...

500
00:26:53,973 --> 00:26:55,599
Captain, I've only got 10 guys...

501
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:58,101
We should be fine
once the 53 squad shows up...

502
00:26:58,143 --> 00:27:00,520
That should be another
10 or 12 minutes...

503
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:01,771
We're not gonna make it...

504
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,065
It's all I knew...
Along came Victor,

505
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,567
he was brilliant, thought he could
save my father's company...

506
00:27:06,651 --> 00:27:08,277
Our first big deal
was with the Saudis...

507
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:11,196
But the Iraqis were shooting
us with our own guns...

508
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,824
What do people think the government
does with all those used weapons?

509
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:16,452
Melt them down?
Make little sculptures out of them?

510
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:18,036
Once we took the company
international,

511
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,788
suddenly we were
in a different league...

512
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,414
It got complicated...

513
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:23,792
Here I am...

514
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:27,503
And Russell made you feel
human again...

515
00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:29,713
And anonymous...

516
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:34,592
You know,
my great-great-grandfather,

517
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:39,931
he designed the gun that changed
the outcome of the Civil War...

518
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:45,520
I grew up thinking that's
what we were still doing...

519
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:49,857
We are securing the building...

520
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,454
I'm really sorry
about your daughter...

521
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:25,181
Joe...

522
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,910
One less breathing
to help us tell our story...

523
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:52,873
We've got the shooter
on the roof of a building at 8...

524
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,502
I don't care if it looks like the Russians,

525
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,796
or the Pakistanis,
or the Girl Scouts,

526
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,964
that guy's voice is American...

527
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:04,009
This is an internal thing,
get on it...

528
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:06,011
I want to know who the fuck else
is shooting at my wife...

529
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,016
Yeah...

530
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,434
Where are you going?

531
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:16,227
Why?

532
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:22,525
The bereaved husband...

533
00:29:22,568 --> 00:29:24,361
When are you gonna stop screwing around

534
00:29:24,444 --> 00:29:27,113
and tell me what this
is all about?

535
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:30,533
You're doing it by the book:

536
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:33,077
go on a business trip:

537
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:35,037
be unavailable for comment:

538
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,163
touch down in Washington

539
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:39,124
for a little face time
with the client:

540
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,959
check the temperature...

541
00:29:41,043 --> 00:29:43,670
I don't really have a whole lot
of choice, now do I?

542
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,839
Joe...

543
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,218
We know each other don't we?

544
00:29:53,012 --> 00:29:54,221
Don't we?

545
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:57,182
You do any time
in South America?

546
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:00,644
Well, who didn't?

547
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:03,105
None of us
really came through that

548
00:30:03,188 --> 00:30:04,564
with our mental health intact,
did we?

549
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:06,357
God knows,
it took me a while

550
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,234
to pull my shit together
when I got back...

551
00:30:08,318 --> 00:30:09,235
Yeah...

552
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:10,736
Yeah,

553
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:13,322
it's a mental health thing...

554
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:17,242
You talk like a company man...

555
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:19,744
Or at least, well,
you were a company man,

556
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:22,080
because they'd never go for
this kind of theatrical bullshit...

557
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:26,042
What is your beef with me?

558
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:28,252
That you'd run away
and let them take Liberty...

559
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:31,922
That you're not man enough
to stand up for your wife...

560
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:34,550
Hope you're impressed
with your life...

561
00:30:40,764 --> 00:30:41,806
Grace and 9th...

562
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,475
- Sure about that, sir?
- Grace and 9th!

563
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,559
You've got it...

564
00:30:57,863 --> 00:31:00,365
- Shooter's still out here...
- Shit, take cover fast...

565
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:01,908
The sniper is shooting
at our guys on the ground...

566
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:04,661
How many down?

567
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:06,121
No report yet...

568
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,209
Over headset:
Luke, it's Mac... We have the shooter...

569
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:13,669
We've got the guyon the roof...

570
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:16,046
Nobody moves until we get
more information... Understood?

571
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,923
Hail Mary, full of grace,

572
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:19,216
the Lord is with thee,

573
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,510
blessed art thou amongst women,

574
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:25,012
blessed is the fruit
of thy womb Jesus...

575
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:28,057
Looks like we've got a problem up here...

576
00:31:28,141 --> 00:31:29,267
It's not the sniper...

577
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,811
Well, who the fuck is he?
Why is he shooting?

578
00:31:31,895 --> 00:31:33,271
No report yet...

579
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:36,607
...pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death...

580
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:38,150
Amen...

581
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:42,154
Chuck says he's talking
the gold star clearance...

582
00:31:42,237 --> 00:31:43,488
CIA?

583
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,656
Jesus, get him down here
if he's still breathing...

584
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:52,872
Joe,

585
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:55,249
what is enough?

586
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:58,586
Are you begging for lives?

587
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:03,923
Yes...

588
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,264
Where are the shots coming from?

589
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,308
My guys are thinking the brick,
maybe the concrete...

590
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,726
I'm thinking higher than the...

591
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,686
Way too much information...
Status on backup?

592
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,745
It's probably a hoax...

593
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,122
I think it has something
to do with her husband...

594
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,541
Russell's been playing with fire...

595
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,585
Now, don't be jealous, dear...

596
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:45,545
Woman:
Oh, fuck off...

597
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,673
Victor knew your voice...

598
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,302
Is this some kind of setup?

599
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:56,055
Come on, now think hard
and you'll get it all figured out...

600
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:57,848
What the fuck do you mean, think?

601
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,391
Come on, come clean...

602
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:02,102
You've taken my life,
you owe me that much...

603
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:04,396
If I'm CIA or FBl,

604
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,148
then I went through all of this

605
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:09,442
because someone very high up
wants a lot of visibility...

606
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:11,986
Okay, okay,
it was a stupid thought...

607
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,530
Look, you can't write this off
to be some big conspiracy...

608
00:33:14,614 --> 00:33:16,907
That's gonna confuse
the fuck out of all of them...

609
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:20,160
Think... Think about how
you're doing on the scoreboard...

610
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:22,120
It's not like I woke up
one day and said,

611
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:25,456
"Wow, it's great to be
in the lethal weapons business..."

612
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,417
It's like the guyon the corner

613
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:29,752
who sells newspapers,
it's what I do...

614
00:33:29,836 --> 00:33:32,004
- What else am I gonna do?
- Be the boss!

615
00:33:32,088 --> 00:33:33,756
It's your life, isn't it?

616
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:36,592
If the idea was
for me to see God,

617
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:37,718
you've achieved it...

618
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,886
I mean, I prayed, for Christ's sake...

619
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:42,931
To the parking garage...
Let's assemble in there... Let's go!

620
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:56,694
When my daughter was killed,
my wife came apart...

621
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:01,449
We met the parents
of the kid who did it...

622
00:34:03,784 --> 00:34:05,535
His father...

623
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:07,287
cried...

624
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:09,164
And he told us that
he had taught his son

625
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:11,374
how to use a gun safely...

626
00:34:15,461 --> 00:34:17,254
Never saw it coming...

627
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,633
I wanted to kill that kid...

628
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:25,137
Then I wanted to kill the father...

629
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,975
But...

630
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:32,268
here I am instead...

631
00:34:38,024 --> 00:34:39,316
I like you...

632
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:43,612
This is no way to die...

633
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,949
For us there's
no other wayout...

634
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,953
I thought about this
for a long time...

635
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:56,331
Bomb squad wants us
to move further back...

636
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,167
Captain, it's Victor Wallace
on the line...

637
00:34:58,209 --> 00:34:59,293
Nobody move...

638
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:05,090
Victor, Hank here...

639
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:07,217
Hank?

640
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:09,970
Jesus Christ...

641
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:11,847
Hank:
Do you know what this is about?

642
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,097
I was hoping you'd tell me...

643
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:15,016
I don't believe you...

644
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,644
We found a guyon the roof
shooting at her... He looked CIA...

645
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:20,145
- Did you get him?
- No, somebody else shot him...

646
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:23,524
The guy we've got is not the sniper
or maybe he's one of them...

647
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:25,359
My ass is
hanging out here, Victor...

648
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,527
I need you to tell me
what's going on...

649
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:29,279
What's going on?
We're dealing with a nutcase...

650
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:30,655
That's what's going on...

651
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:31,823
Yeah, or terrorists buying time...

652
00:35:31,907 --> 00:35:34,367
It's only been half an hour
and the press is still stacking up...

653
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:35,785
I'm five minutes away...

654
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:42,249
This action may be connected
to the recent lawsuit

655
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,459
filed by seven
of the largest gunmakers,

656
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:47,378
alleging that efforts
by government to impose

657
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:49,714
gun safety measures,
amounts to a conspiracy

658
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:53,134
that violates constitutional
guarantees of free trade...

659
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:55,094
Wallace's company, McCloud Guns,

660
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:56,721
is at the center of this controversy

661
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:59,973
by refusing to become signatory
to any government proposal

662
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,017
that legislates more controls...

663
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,185
Man:
Thanks for that breaking news...

664
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,479
Now on the international...

665
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,981
31 cities and countries
have brought charges against

666
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:10,191
manufacturers claiming
they're not doing enough

667
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,777
to keep guns out of the
hands of children and criminals...

668
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:15,154
Apparently, Wallace is
staging a high-stakes protest

669
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:16,697
against the very industry

670
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:18,699
that made her family
famous in America...

671
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:19,741
Back to you, Dennis...

672
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:21,702
We're in the final stretch, Liberty...

673
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:24,246
So,

674
00:36:25,372 --> 00:36:26,789
what's your plan?

675
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:30,376
I don't want to die...

676
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,629
I don't want to die...

677
00:36:40,053 --> 00:36:42,722
I don't want anyone else
to die because of me, Joe...

678
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:45,474
Me neither...

679
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:52,897
You know,

680
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:55,024
the NRA is just gonna
spin this and say it's because

681
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:56,651
of people like you
that we need to be armed...

682
00:36:58,945 --> 00:37:02,281
Well, I was an honest
law-abiding citizen...

683
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:04,658
By that definition
I deserve to be armed...

684
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:08,494
And I was acting
out against the oppression

685
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:09,955
of our freedom...

686
00:37:15,126 --> 00:37:16,377
There it is...

687
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:31,390
You know,
I first saw you in Jerusalem...

688
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:33,101
About three years ago...

689
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:36,437
You must have made
a hell of a deal...

690
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:38,480
'Cause they were
kissing your ass...

691
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,695
- Did I meet you?
- Nope...

692
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:49,532
I did business
with Victor, though...

693
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:51,409
On behalf of the Saudis...

694
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:54,078
It seems he likes
to sell on all sides...

695
00:37:55,288 --> 00:37:57,790
We met in our early days...

696
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:01,669
Seriously flawed
mission to Columbia...

697
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,672
I saved his life...

698
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:07,800
How funny...

699
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:11,636
I saved the life of the man
that killed my daughter...

700
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,772
Joe...

701
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:48,336
Thanks, Barry...

702
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,754
I don't feel good about this...

703
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:06,895
Death isn't as ex citing
as I thought it would be...

704
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,617
Ex cuse me, please...

705
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:23,702
Ex cuse me...

706
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,370
Ex cuse me,
I'm Victor Wallace...

707
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:27,038
Sir, you can't
come through here...

708
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,124
I'm the husband,
you fucking moron...

709
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,876
Woman:
Sir, just one question!

710
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:33,669
Don't talk to me...

711
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:35,380
Has this played
into McCloud's position

712
00:39:35,422 --> 00:39:37,006
on gun safety legislation?

713
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:48,934
This has absolutely nothing to do
with McCloud Industries...

714
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:51,311
These are the actions
of an insane man...

715
00:39:52,604 --> 00:39:54,564
And my wife
is a wonderful woman...

716
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:57,817
She's a wonderful woman...

717
00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:06,283
- Victor, you can't go out there...
- I just want to let her see me...

718
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:07,409
Why?

719
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,329
'Cause I think I know
who this guy is...

720
00:40:11,413 --> 00:40:13,164
And I think I can
get her out of this...

721
00:40:13,248 --> 00:40:15,124
Whatever you're thinking,

722
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,752
- I can't let...
- This is my problem...

723
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:19,587
Don't make me
make problems for you...

724
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:23,882
Be good to the car...

725
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,762
I said the car...

726
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:33,892
Liberty!

727
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:35,143
Victor...

728
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:45,819
Hey, Alex...

729
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:51,450
Well, here we are again,

730
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:53,618
in the kill zone...
What can I do for you?

731
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,037
I remember the day
you wept like a baby

732
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,457
while I promised
not to let you die...

733
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,878
Okay, okay,
you saved my life, yeah...

734
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,087
Wasn't I thankful enough then?

735
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,631
Well, thanks again...

736
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,174
I mean it...

737
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,051
- Victor...
- But I have a feeling that...

738
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,886
what's really expected of me

739
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,056
is some sort of big,
public confession...

740
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,099
Am I right?
What am I supposed to say?

741
00:41:21,352 --> 00:41:22,478
Joe, don't do it...

742
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,771
That...

743
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:26,440
that really shiny one
that I have is actually for...

744
00:41:26,524 --> 00:41:28,359
for leading a bunch
of men to their death?

745
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,318
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

746
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:31,862
Come on...

747
00:41:31,946 --> 00:41:33,489
Alex, it's a war...

748
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,824
That's the kind of stuff
that happens...

749
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:40,161
You think I'm proud of it?
I didn't ask for the medal...

750
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,626
Your death is gonna
mean something...

751
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:49,961
But my daughter's...

752
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:51,045
won't...

753
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:54,382
Joe, don't do it...

754
00:41:55,842 --> 00:41:56,968
Don't do it!

755
00:41:58,053 --> 00:41:59,637
- Don't!
- Christ, he's been hit...

756
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:00,805
Get him out of here!

757
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:18,571
Get him inside fast!

758
00:42:19,656 --> 00:42:21,032
Come on, pick him up!
Move!

759
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:23,034
Let's go! Let's go!

760
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,334
Don't!

761
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:41,843
Liberty...

762
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:42,885
Liberty!

763
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,470
- It's time...
- What?

764
00:42:44,554 --> 00:42:46,263
Time for you to go...

765
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:47,806
The keys for your cuffs

766
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,684
is in a box taped to the underside
of the cart near the corner...

767
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,562
Okay, guys, it's got to be this one
right here, 7th and Alvarado...

768
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:54,980
Move on it!
7th and Alvarado!

769
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:05,072
Aah!

770
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:06,698
Bring the chopper
into the back,

771
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:08,826
or this guy will
blow it out of the sky...

772
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:12,121
Must be some kind of shooter
if he's holed up that far...

773
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:21,254
In the theater,
officer needs backup...

774
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:22,922
There's people panicking...
Smoke everywhere...

775
00:43:23,006 --> 00:43:24,423
A fire's been set
or something...

776
00:43:37,894 --> 00:43:38,811
Hey!

777
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:41,022
Stop! Get away!

778
00:43:41,106 --> 00:43:42,190
There's a bomb!

779
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:44,108
Guys, all eyes out
for the Wallace woman...

780
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,360
Run! Run!
There's a bomb!

781
00:43:52,825 --> 00:43:53,784
Run!

782
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:55,535
There's a bomb!

783
00:43:56,703 --> 00:43:57,662
Liberty,

784
00:43:57,746 --> 00:43:58,997
it's up to you now...

785
00:43:59,081 --> 00:44:00,332
Time to choose...

786
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,306
Everybody, move!

787
00:44:32,862 --> 00:44:35,197
Computer:
Video attachment is streaming...

788
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:39,367
Senator Libby took at least
three payments in cash...

789
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:42,745
Senator Lipton, Crick,
Congressman Gomez,

790
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:45,498
check Geneva bank accounts...

791
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,250
You'll all be able
to return to your cars,

792
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,835
once we secure the area...

793
00:44:49,877 --> 00:44:51,461
Where's Russell?

794
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:53,463
- Where's Russell?
- I haven't seen him...

795
00:44:57,759 --> 00:44:59,594
Russell!

796
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:04,056
Russell!

797
00:45:05,433 --> 00:45:06,767
Get out of here!

798
00:45:06,851 --> 00:45:07,851
Don't!

799
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:12,940
Get out of here!
There's a bomb!

800
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:14,816
Get out! Run!

801
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,151
Get out of here!

802
00:45:39,423 --> 00:45:42,050
The file with the video
attachment has been sent...

803
00:45:50,766 --> 00:45:52,851
As you can see,
the area has been contained...

804
00:45:52,935 --> 00:45:54,728
The situation is under control...

805
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:57,355
Now, if you'll ex cuse me...

806
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:14,579
All right,
everybody into the alley, now!

807
00:46:14,622 --> 00:46:16,290
All right, get the fire hose...

808
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:19,459
Find that motherfucker!

809
00:46:33,597 --> 00:46:34,639
No, sir...

810
00:46:34,723 --> 00:46:36,891
No other civilian casualties
from the explosion...

811
00:46:37,976 --> 00:46:39,936
We've had a fire reported
in the back of the theater, sir...

812
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,730
No damage... No casualties...
All noise and smoke...

813
00:46:42,814 --> 00:46:44,023
He made me shoot it...

814
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:47,151
Close range...

815
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:03,500
- Who are you?
- I was looking for my wife's purse...

816
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,126
It's not safe in here...
Get out of here...

817
00:47:09,005 --> 00:47:11,006
My great-great-grandfather,

818
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,968
he designed the gun that changed
the outcome of the Civil War...

819
00:47:35,488 --> 00:47:38,198
Where exactly were you when
the first explosion took place?

820
00:47:38,282 --> 00:47:40,534
Umm... that's funny
that you would ask...

821
00:47:40,576 --> 00:47:42,744
Ex cuse me...
Mr... Perry! Mr... Perry!

822
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:52,003
I grew up thinking that's what we were still doing...

823
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:54,129
On the other side!

824
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,722
I'm really sorry
about your daughter...

825
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,562
My father...

826
00:48:20,737 --> 00:48:22,905
he was my hero...

827
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:34,542
He was...

828
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:05,569
Let me do what I can really do...

829
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,823
Let me work from the inside...
I can...

830
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:10,491
I can do something...

831
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:26,631
Joe, I can really change things...

832
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:28,216
I promise you I'll do it...

833
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,550
I promise...
