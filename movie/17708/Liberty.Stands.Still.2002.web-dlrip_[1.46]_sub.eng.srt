1
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:32,864
How do you do that?

2
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:35,325
Hey, Daddy, look at me!

3
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:15,258
I'm not wearing any underwear.

4
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,926
Are you going to be able to concentrate?

5
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,637
Not if you aren't here.

6
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:22,640
I'm on my way.

7
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,350
We hit some weather in Washington,

8
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:26,227
so I just got off the plane.

9
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:28,104
I don't think I'll make curtain,

10
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,690
but I won't miss your entrance.

11
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:32,650
Have I ever missed?

12
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:39,073
What's wrong?

13
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:40,616
Today is the last show.

14
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,953
Aw. Are you sad for us or for the show?

15
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:46,122
For us.

16
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:48,041
Oh, I'm touched.

17
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,836
Hold on.

18
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:54,964
Hang on, Victor.

19
00:03:57,508 --> 00:04:00,637
- Hey, what's up?
- Client doesn't like London now.

20
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,139
- Is Paris set up?
- Yeah.

21
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:06,309
- I just have to talk to Brian.
- Already did, he's fine with it.

22
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,978
Looking forward to seeing us
in New York for a champagne toast.

23
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:10,480
I said,
'Friday would be okay?'

24
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:13,566
Sounds fine.
I'll call you later, okay?

25
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,902
Russell?

26
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:18,529
- Sorry, baby.
- That your husband?

27
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:21,032
Uh-huh.
Now where were we?

28
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,826
Oh yeah, my underwear.

29
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:34,087
Look, I didn't want to tell you
this over the phone, but.

30
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:38,383
I've fallen in love with you.

31
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:44,514
Shit, hold on.

32
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:46,057
What is it, Victor?

33
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,643
I am counting on you for dinner, you know.

34
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,687
Why?

35
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:52,313
What do you mean, why?

36
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:54,232
George is dawdling on this thing.

37
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:56,985
He desires you and I think he can
close it tonight, that's why.

38
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:59,737
You know, I don't think I can make it.

39
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,614
But I'll try to make dessert, okay?

40
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:04,242
Don't wait for me.

41
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:07,912
George?

42
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:11,165
Thanks for holding.
Listen, 9:00 might be better

43
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:13,418
if it's not too late.
Good.

44
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,423
- Russell?
- Yes.

45
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:20,758
We had a deal, remember?

46
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,468
So you're just going to have to deal

47
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:25,513
with me pining and moaning over
what we might've had together.

48
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,061
You didn't hang up.

49
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:36,566
Not yet.

50
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,403
So what does that mean?

51
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:42,447
I can't do this.

52
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:49,287
If you're going to bail,
you'd best do it now.

53
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,417
Sweet.

54
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:58,421
But you didn't scare her away.

55
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:00,757
Sounded too much like you meant it.

56
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:01,924
I did.

57
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,676
10 minutes till curtain everyone.

58
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,303
Here we go, folks.
Last night.

59
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:08,681
Well, then I feel like Cupid.

60
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,603
Please, don't hurt her
if that's what this is about.

61
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,276
Do you believe in God?

62
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,445
Yes, I do.

63
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:25,615
Life's a walking shadow,

64
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:27,200
a poor player, that struts

65
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:29,661
and frets his hour upon the stage

66
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:31,537
then is heard no more.

67
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:34,582
It's a tale told by an idiot

68
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,627
full of sound and fury

69
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,879
signifying.

70
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:41,297
nothing.

71
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:48,846
If you move or speak,
this blows.

72
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:54,352
It's very sensitive.

73
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:57,063
For the next few moments

74
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:59,399
you're going to be closer to your God

75
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,318
than you've ever been.

76
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,448
Don't waste it.

77
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:27,010
Early curtain tonight, everyone.

78
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,679
Let's get going.

79
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,723
Help.

80
00:07:58,249 --> 00:07:59,709
What, motherfucker?

81
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,880
Jeez,
say something, fool.

82
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:14,140
Hey, Dwayne,
how's the salmonella business?

83
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:16,976
Hey, Papa Chulo.

84
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,228
I got kosher, man.
I got turkey,

85
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,774
100% beef, you know,
and all that good stuff.

86
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:26,235
- What, no vegetarian?
- I got vegan, best on the market.

87
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,071
Can't tell the difference.

88
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:30,907
Forget it.
Me, I'm going to go all the way.

89
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:33,451
- 100% beef.
- And lips.

90
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:37,288
It's true. What do you think
they do with the lips, man?

91
00:08:37,372 --> 00:08:40,124
Anus and spleen and all that stuff.

92
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,377
It's all 100% cow.

93
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,420
Very funny.

94
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:47,382
I'll see you next week.

95
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:49,133
Give my regards to your boss.

96
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:59,686
Russell?

97
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,188
Has anyone seen Russell?

98
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,357
Did you lose my little darling again?

99
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,735
He told me he'd be back by now.
Have you seen him?

100
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:09,862
In the carnal sense?

101
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:12,490
No, not yet.

102
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:15,827
Hey, find the ice queen
rich bitch and you'll find him.

103
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:19,998
- Russell.
- Help.

104
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:22,417
Russell?

105
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,293
Please don't do this to me again.

106
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:28,840
Russell you will personally
be responsible for my heart attack.

107
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:32,218
Five minutes, everyone.

108
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:19,390
She's still not in her seat?

109
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:25,563
He left a message on my cell 10 minutes ago

110
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:27,732
saying he would be here 10 minutes ago.

111
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:31,486
Shit. Okay,
five more minutes, everyone.

112
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:34,030
- Should I be getting dressed?
- Fuck off.

113
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:35,365
Okay.

114
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:36,658
I'll get dressed anyway,

115
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:38,409
just in case.

116
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,663
So you want to spot me another gram?

117
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:26,082
- It's the weekend.
- Can't do that, Mel.

118
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:28,167
I got a big day, bro'.

119
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:30,586
Look, I'm going to tell you something, man.

120
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,797
My boss is a mean son of a bitch, all right?

121
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,257
I got kids, you know?

122
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:38,303
A hundred. I'll give you
the rest Monday. end of day.

123
00:11:38,386 --> 00:11:40,054
Don't be waving that shit around here, man.

124
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,472
Jesus.

125
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:43,891
- Hey.
- I swear.

126
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:45,768
- You the man, Dwayne.
- Whatever.

127
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:15,131
Hello, Dwayne.

128
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:18,551
Hey!

129
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:21,095
- Has it been a week already?
- Yeah.

130
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:24,641
Last performance tonight.
We're having a big party.

131
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:26,809
Yeah?

132
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:30,063
Well, they got some big numbers
coming in from New York next.

133
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:32,190
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:34,567
Big deal.

135
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:39,947
Oh.

136
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:41,824
Wow.

137
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:47,330
You take care of yourself, huh?

138
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:54,504
Got a good thing going on,
you and me, huh?

139
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:02,178
Liberty Wallace.

140
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,222
Nice to meet you,
Liberty Wallace.

141
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:06,516
- My name's Joe.
- What could I do for you, Joe?

142
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:09,102
Stand still.

143
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:10,228
Excuse me?

144
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,150
I'll need you to pay attention.

145
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:19,278
Look, I'm late for a play.
Who is this?

146
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,864
You mean you're late for your weekly fuck?

147
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:23,366
Asshole.

148
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:41,718
Look, asshole, whoever you are,
if you call one more time.

149
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,594
I didn't expect to like Russell.

150
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:46,597
But then again, I guess you
didn't expect to like him either.

151
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,057
About a half hour?

152
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:53,396
Dwayne had to take a whiz.

153
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,650
. so he needs you to step in.

154
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:06,784
What do you want?

155
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:08,619
Calm.

156
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,916
Walk over to the hot dog stand.

157
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,962
You need to be closer.

158
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,268
You need to know I've locked a signal

159
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,103
onto your cell number.

160
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,105
There's a bomb,

161
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:39,442
a really big bomb,

162
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:42,111
in that hot dog stand.

163
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:45,657
I'll shoot innocent people.

164
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,493
We've got a bit of ground to cover,

165
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:51,788
so I don't want to have to kill you.

166
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,248
Walk closer

167
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:56,084
to the stand.

168
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:00,421
If your cell phone goes dead

169
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:03,841
or you touch the mute button
for any reason, it'll blow.

170
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:05,927
It's irreversible translation.

171
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,388
No off switch.

172
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:10,932
There's enough explosive in there

173
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:12,684
to take out the whole block.

174
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:15,019
So.

175
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:17,647
you have a little problem on your hands.

176
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:23,319
Now take a breath.

177
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:26,197
Liberty, could please check your battery?

178
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,367
'Cause we need to know how much time we have.

179
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,285
It's half charged.

180
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:36,040
That gives us about 80 minutes.

181
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:38,626
There's a pair of cuffs hanging on the cart.

182
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,010
You've got quite a decision to make.

183
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:49,846
Tell me what you want.

184
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:52,140
Your soul.

185
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:53,850
Fine, name a price.

186
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,060
Do you really think
I'd go through all this trouble

187
00:15:56,144 --> 00:15:57,437
for cash?

188
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,856
You're going to have put on that ankle cuff.

189
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:02,900
Then we're going to have a talk.

190
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:05,028
Do it.

191
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,614
- Do it.
- No!

192
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,116
Okay, okay.

193
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,713
No.

194
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:26,716
On your ankle, please.

195
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:40,063
Tug.
Show me it's secure.

196
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,817
Good.

197
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:48,571
Okay, now I'll make an honest man of myself.

198
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:53,076
Open the top left door of the cart.

199
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:57,747
Jesus.

200
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,333
I'm guessing you know what that is.

201
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:04,003
I take it you have some political affiliations.

202
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,422
No.

203
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:08,883
That's the problem.

204
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,679
I need yours.

205
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,853
Look, we could just cut to the chase here.

206
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:24,107
I'm guessing you have a 223.
It's sophisticated.

207
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:26,484
- You mean expensive.
- That too.

208
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,027
- Which means you're connected.
- Yeah.

209
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,863
All right, you've got me
standing still. What's next?

210
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:32,365
Easy.

211
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:35,076
I get to decide how this goes down.

212
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:39,080
I know it's not Russell,

213
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:41,749
because he's backstage
thinking about your future.

214
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,585
He's wondering whether you
put your panties back on

215
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:46,921
and are making a run for it.

216
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,260
I'm sure you're wondering
if I'm working for your husband.

217
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:53,553
I'm not.

218
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:56,514
If he knew about Russell he'd take it hard

219
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:59,892
and he's a very violent man.

220
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,894
Hey, is Dwayne around?

221
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:05,273
No, he stepped away.

222
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:07,817
Is he going to be back soon?

223
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:15,950
Did he leave anything for Frank?

224
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,495
Tell him something,
he looks desperate.

225
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:20,913
- No.
- What?

226
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,594
No, I don't eat meat.

227
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:36,763
Thank you.

228
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:39,223
He thinks you warned him about the cops.

229
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:45,563
You having fun, Joe?

230
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,273
Yes.

231
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,317
But not like you think.

232
00:18:52,612 --> 00:18:54,364
How much do you want?

233
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:57,033
Nothing.
It's not about cash.

234
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:59,410
It's about you.

235
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,663
You have two choices.

236
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:04,248
First, you die an American hero.

237
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:06,250
Second.

238
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:08,920
you die still working for the fat man.

239
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:10,505
Look, I have accounts all over the world.

240
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,965
I have unlimited resources.
Tell me how much you want.

241
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:15,009
Is it all champagne inside that pretty head?

242
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:16,552
I don't see where this is going.

243
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:19,013
Ah, Liberty.

244
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:21,557
Memory lane.

245
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,017
The former you.

246
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:27,355
Life before the Bulgari handbag.

247
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:28,898
What happened?

248
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:33,069
- You know my husband.
- Can't pin this on him.

249
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:36,155
He's just a thug working on any side of the law

250
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,699
that'll give out a check.

251
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:41,160
By the medals he earned during
his stint with the military,

252
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:43,079
some would say he's a hero.

253
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:45,331
And what would you say,
Liberty?

254
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't think this is about

255
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,419
what I think of my husband's track record.

256
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:53,172
Do heroes pray for war so that
they can sell their bullets?

257
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,717
We never discuss our business.

258
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,093
Okay, Liberty.

259
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:59,512
You're in my sightline,

260
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:02,598
you're standing next to a bomb,

261
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:04,642
and you're not at liberty to discuss

262
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:07,061
that you and your husband manufacture guns

263
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:09,397
and sell them to any fucking country,

264
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,899
or street asshole,

265
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:15,778
or all-American kid who'll pay you the cash.

266
00:20:17,572 --> 00:20:19,782
Hooray for the American dream.

267
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:21,951
If you want something,
ask for it,

268
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:23,619
otherwise,
I'm just going to hang up.

269
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,872
Go ahead.

270
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,887
Is this about the sale to Poland?

271
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,264
- Serbia.
- Poland.

272
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:50,647
Denial is a curious thing.

273
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:53,483
The shipment never made it to Poland.

274
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:56,110
Serbians, Croats.

275
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:58,321
kids on both sides.

276
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:00,156
all died.

277
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:01,407
What's the fucking difference?

278
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:03,493
So you were there?

279
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:32,063
Go on, honey.

280
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:35,233
Hot dog, please.

281
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,695
Sure. Sure.

282
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:51,749
No mustard.

283
00:22:04,262 --> 00:22:07,056
I said no mustard.

284
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:09,392
Cute. Don't make me pull the trigger.

285
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:12,979
- He's just a kid.
- I have nothing to lose, Liberty.

286
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:15,189
Or haven't you figured that out yet?

287
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:18,901
Go.

288
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:39,172
You know,
you know a lot about me.

289
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:41,090
What I'm thinking,
who I'm fucking.

290
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:42,633
just amazing, Joe.

291
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:44,552
And I'm your only friend at this moment.

292
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:47,096
- My final confessor.
- That too.

293
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,432
So you whacking off right now, baby, hmm?

294
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:51,309
Working out some domination bullshit?

295
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,602
Tread carefully,
dear heart.

296
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:54,812
Why? In this game of yours,
the way I see it,

297
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:57,440
I die either way.
May as well have some fun.

298
00:22:57,523 --> 00:23:01,277
VP Marketing, McCloud,
standard in American weaponry.

299
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:04,405
Kind of like Beretta is to the Italians.

300
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:06,282
Ah, so that's what this is about.

301
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:09,118
Your dilemma is.

302
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,537
when to pull the plug.
pull the plug.

303
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:13,206
Who are you going to take with you?

304
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:14,957
And who are you going to take with you?

305
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,293
Aah!

306
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,588
What was that?

307
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:24,342
Now.

308
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:27,220
you've just been shot at
by your best-selling rifle.

309
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:28,763
How does it feel?

310
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:30,139
How's it supposed to feel?

311
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:32,100
Real.

312
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,936
Fine, I'm terrified.
Is that what you want me to say?

313
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,312
Well, it's a start.

314
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:38,398
And you've got a little over an hour

315
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,441
to sound like you really mean it.

316
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:43,861
You want to know what makes me

317
00:23:43,945 --> 00:23:45,530
so twisted?

318
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:48,282
Crazy?

319
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,743
The whyof it all?

320
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:53,496
It's kind of funny.
Right now I feel absolutely sane.

321
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:56,791
But I know what it's like
to be twisted and crazy.

322
00:23:56,874 --> 00:23:58,876
Something I don't think

323
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,212
that you've ever experienced.

324
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:03,339
Well, I've had my moments.

325
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:05,091
Don't compete.

326
00:24:05,174 --> 00:24:07,927
You're right, you're probably
crazier than I've ever been.

327
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,852
I'll take a long walk,
and then you'll know.

328
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:18,604
I mean, I don't have to.

329
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,857
Good God, he sucks.

330
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:22,108
I can't go out there.

331
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:33,369
So, you're quite a shot.

332
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:37,290
Yeah. I started with BBs and squirrels.

333
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:41,044
You're a pretty crack shot yourself.

334
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:45,590
Well, you know, my father wanted
a competition kid,

335
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:47,550
so I went for the medals.

336
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,721
You know what he did to me
the first time he took me

337
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:54,223
out in the bush?

338
00:24:54,265 --> 00:24:59,062
He shot this deer.
The deer had a fawn.

339
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:04,192
You know what he made me do?

340
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,320
He made me shoot it.

341
00:25:08,404 --> 00:25:09,697
Close range.

342
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:11,741
And you pulled the trigger.

343
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:13,451
I hated him for making me do it.

344
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:16,162
- I had nightmares.
- How ironic.

345
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:17,914
Yeah.

346
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:22,085
Come on, let's get back to the point.

347
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:24,796
Why are you doing this, Joe?

348
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:28,299
You must meet all kinds in your business.

349
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:30,760
- Why do they?
- Come on, I sell corporately.

350
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,345
It's not like I deal with every asshole

351
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:34,555
who wants to wave a big dick at something.

352
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,766
So it's about my dick?

353
00:25:41,145 --> 00:25:43,606
What if Russell slit his wrists?

354
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,400
We should call the police.

355
00:25:45,483 --> 00:25:46,985
Slit his wrists?

356
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:49,487
Russell's the happiest man I've ever met.

357
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,156
Happiness is the best cover
for clinical depression.

358
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,243
What? Did he tell you he was depressed?

359
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:57,996
The man is dating a barracuda.
What's not to be depressed about?

360
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:06,629
You know, we're in a bit of a time jam here.

361
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:08,256
This guessing game's getting a bit tiring.

362
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:09,924
Why don't you just tell me what's going on?

363
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:14,971
Fair enough.

364
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:18,599
I want you to understand loss.

365
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:23,438
You lost someone.

366
00:26:25,356 --> 00:26:26,983
to a gun accident?

367
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:29,819
No accident.
A willful act.

368
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,447
Premeditated.

369
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:35,700
Your wife?

370
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,829
Son?

371
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,083
Your daughter.

372
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:00,516
Look, I'm really sorry for you and your family,

373
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,852
but is this how she'd want you to act?

374
00:27:02,894 --> 00:27:04,771
She's not alive to ask.

375
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:08,650
Why would you want more blood on your hands?

376
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,777
Misery needs company.

377
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:14,697
The blood is going to spill into your hands,

378
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:16,532
where it belongs,
Liberty.

379
00:27:16,574 --> 00:27:20,119
There's hundreds of people who trade weapons.

380
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,621
I'm just one tiny speck in all of this.

381
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:23,289
That's all it takes.

382
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:25,291
Presidents and three-year-olds die

383
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,043
all in the name of the Constitution.

384
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:29,879
They have metal detectors and cops in schools.

385
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:32,465
Is that what makes America great?

386
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:34,509
Okay,
I get where this is going.

387
00:27:34,592 --> 00:27:37,053
I'll denounce my involvement in weapons,

388
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:39,764
I'll denounce the industry, fuck,

389
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:41,391
I'll denounce death in general, okay?

390
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:43,559
We'll get the press here,
we'll cause a big scene.

391
00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:45,311
Is that what you want?!

392
00:27:45,395 --> 00:27:47,313
You're so full of shit.

393
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:50,733
Look, I know you must be dying inside,

394
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:52,902
but I'm standing next to a goddamn bomb,

395
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:54,821
and it's going to cause some serious damage.

396
00:27:54,904 --> 00:27:58,241
So if you want coverage,
Come on, let's get it going.

397
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:04,038
What were your father's last words?

398
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:10,336
He has nothing to do with this.

399
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,755
Yeah, I guess blowing your brains out is.

400
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:14,882
is about as much as anyone person can ever say.

401
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:20,930
You seem to know a lot
about me and my family, Joe.

402
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:23,224
It's personal.

403
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:26,602
And I get to atone for the sins

404
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:29,105
of every cheap-suit fucking gun salesman?

405
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:30,356
Yeah, and your father.

406
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:34,777
He has nothing to do with this. Fuck you!

407
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:36,821
This has nothing to do with my father.

408
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:38,906
This is about you going postal!

409
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:42,368
He's part of the family legacy.

410
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:43,536
Bullshit!
He is not.

411
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:45,371
- He is not!
- You were an impressionable kid.

412
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:47,373
His money bought you into a society

413
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:49,834
on both sides of the law.

414
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,627
He's definitely a part of this.

415
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:53,713
No he isn't.

416
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,604
Try that $5,000 watch you're wearing.

417
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:13,900
- Fine.
- Oh, better yet,

418
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:16,402
that $25, 000 wedding ring.

419
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:17,654
You got it.

420
00:29:20,365 --> 00:29:21,866
Say, honey.

421
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:38,966
Where's Dwayne,
Ms. Liberty Wallace?

422
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,178
Oh, he had to step away.
I'm watching the stand.

423
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:48,601
You doing this for a reason?

424
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:52,647
You tell him,
I shoot him.

425
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:57,860
It's hot today.

426
00:29:57,944 --> 00:29:59,612
His life is in your hands, Liberty.

427
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:01,447
Put your clothes on.

428
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:03,116
Yeah! I'll take whatever you're selling.

429
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:05,660
Beat it.

430
00:30:05,743 --> 00:30:08,037
A hot dog for the road.

431
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,247
Oops.

432
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:14,210
- Good for sales.
- I said beat it!

433
00:30:15,294 --> 00:30:16,629
All right.

434
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:19,966
Whatever you're on, lady,
get more of it.

435
00:30:31,352 --> 00:30:34,147
You're pissing me off.

436
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:36,649
I'll be right back.

437
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:38,484
Uh-huh.

438
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:41,571
You're signing his death warrant.

439
00:30:41,654 --> 00:30:42,989
Is that what you want?

440
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:56,753
It's show time.

441
00:31:02,258 --> 00:31:04,177
Your actions have consequences.

442
00:31:22,153 --> 00:31:24,989
You shot him?
God, you shot him.

443
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:26,908
He's dying as we speak.

444
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,120
Tell me what you want.

445
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:33,456
For one,
your company just made

446
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,459
a deal worth several million dollars.

447
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:37,960
You're not going to deliver.

448
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,392
Officer,
are you all right?

449
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:54,936
Oh my God.

450
00:32:00,024 --> 00:32:01,693
Hello?

451
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:04,404
Yeah, there's an officer here.
He's bleeding.

452
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:08,324
I don't know, I think
the corner of 9th and Grace?

453
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:12,537
Fuck him he was a bad cop.

454
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,122
That dick did it on the take.

455
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:16,165
My name?

456
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:18,459
It's George.

457
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:22,964
McCannister.
I'm just standing here,

458
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:24,090
I don't really want.

459
00:32:24,173 --> 00:32:26,551
Yeah, I'll wait.

460
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:28,052
I guess.

461
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:31,139
A fucking lot of people are about to arrive.

462
00:32:31,222 --> 00:32:33,683
This is your window of opportunity, Liberty.

463
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:36,060
- Let's call your husband.
- No, don't.

464
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:38,980
- I'll three-way you.
- Don't!

465
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:42,984
McCloud Industries,
Victor Wallace's office.

466
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,194
- Yes, is he there, please?
- May I say who's calling?

467
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:48,698
- Liberty.
- Ex cuse me?

468
00:32:48,781 --> 00:32:52,118
His wife.
I'm calling for his wife,

469
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:54,078
who asked me to call

470
00:32:54,162 --> 00:32:57,040
because she's in a bit of a jam right now.

471
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:58,666
Please hold.

472
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,421
Make a copy and distribute it

473
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:05,381
to code red level security.

474
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:07,425
Mr. Wallace,
your wife is on the line, sir.

475
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:13,640
- What's up, Lib?
- She's on the other line.

476
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:15,642
We're conferenced.

477
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:17,060
And who is this?

478
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:20,897
I'm Joe. Your wife's cuffed
to a bomb wired to blow

479
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,149
if the cell phone dies.

480
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:25,401
I've also got one of your rifles pointed at her

481
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:27,654
so I can shoot her

482
00:33:27,737 --> 00:33:30,490
or anyone else I figure isn't working out.

483
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:31,908
Liberty?

484
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:40,667
Oops. Is he always that sympathetic?

485
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,627
He probably thinks you're a terrorist.

486
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,587
Terrorist?

487
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:46,297
Why is that?

488
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:49,258
Because of the deals
you cut with Senator Tollman?

489
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,427
Government involvement is classified.

490
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:53,638
Hey, they're on their way, all right?

491
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:54,931
Just hold on a second.

492
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:57,934
Your husband just hung up on you.

493
00:33:58,017 --> 00:33:59,936
That's because he thought he was protecting me.

494
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:03,398
We signed a no-deals policy
so we wouldn't be vulnerable

495
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:06,067
to every...
every fucking terrorist.

496
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,277
It was a condition for the military.

497
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:10,446
Oh, please.
What does signing a contract

498
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,448
really have to do with it?

499
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:17,286
Don't answer.

500
00:34:19,122 --> 00:34:21,457
- Liberty?
- Hey, it's me.

501
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,918
It's for real. I'm at the corner
of 9th and Grace.

502
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:25,795
I have about 45 minutes left on my battery.

503
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:30,299
Liberty, talk to me.
Any idea who we're dealing with?

504
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:31,718
No.

505
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:40,643
He said something about us bailing on a deal.

506
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:42,770
I don't know what he's talking about.

507
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:45,273
The only one big enough
is the one going through Paris.

508
00:34:45,356 --> 00:34:47,442
- Nothing more specific?
- No!

509
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:48,568
I don't get it.

510
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,236
How did you leave it with Washington?

511
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,280
Done.
The money's wired.

512
00:34:52,363 --> 00:34:53,823
What does he want?
Hijack the shipment?

513
00:34:53,906 --> 00:34:54,907
What does he want?

514
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,953
I don't know what he wants!

515
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:01,497
He won't tell me.

516
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:03,916
- This could be goodbye.
- Don't get dramatic.

517
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,835
If they wanted you dead,
you would be.

518
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:07,795
I'm hanging up now.
I'm on it.

519
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:11,341
- I don't fucking believe you.
- If you do that again.

520
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:15,261
I'll shoot innocent people on your behalf.

521
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,352
Oh, he didn't even say goodbye, did he?

522
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:26,356
Well, he's got a lot at stake.

523
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:28,941
International arms dealing is tricky business.

524
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,401
No loyalties.

525
00:35:38,451 --> 00:35:39,911
Call Brian.

526
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,123
- I already did.
- Oh, good boy.

527
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:46,209
Very good boy.

528
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:50,213
This is a hostage situation.
Your hands are tied.

529
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:54,092
What am I supposed to do now,

530
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:56,052
go and sip tea in a safehouse

531
00:35:56,135 --> 00:35:57,845
while my wife is chained to a bomb?

532
00:35:57,887 --> 00:35:59,681
Calm down.

533
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:02,308
You're a target too.
She knows the drill.

534
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:04,352
You both signed the security agreement.

535
00:36:04,435 --> 00:36:07,730
- The machinery just kicked in.
- I'm calm. I'm very calm.

536
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:11,859
Shit.

537
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:15,863
Step away.

538
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:17,532
Did you see what happened here?

539
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:19,117
I didn't see anything.

540
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,036
1986 request backup.
Request immediate backup.

541
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:24,205
Shots fired, officer down,
possibly dead.

542
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:26,124
Oh my God.
He's barely got a pulse.

543
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:28,960
Do you have an open marriage,

544
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:31,546
or is it all just pretend from the beginning?

545
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:33,423
I'm sure this isn't about our marriage.

546
00:36:33,464 --> 00:36:36,551
But I'm the last person you're
going to speak to on this Earth,

547
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:39,429
so might as well tell me everything.

548
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:42,140
- He'll hunt you down.
- He might hunt you down.

549
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:44,684
You just became a security risk.

550
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,979
You know, they took out JFK
over the price of oil,

551
00:36:48,062 --> 00:36:51,566
so I'd say your chances
of being a military target

552
00:36:51,649 --> 00:36:53,276
are pretty high.

553
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:55,778
Like you said,
the stakes are high.

554
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:58,364
This is all more important than an individual.

555
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:01,284
Am I right? Is that what
you tell yourself every day?

556
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:06,331
I'm only a cog
in the great wheel of misfortune.

557
00:37:06,414 --> 00:37:08,333
That's the way it is.

558
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:11,711
How did you end up here?

559
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:14,464
How the fuck did that happen?

560
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:17,717
I can make a deal or break one.

561
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,052
I have my own connections.

562
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:21,220
Get back to your little theater gig,

563
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:24,015
backstage every Thursday.

564
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:26,559
body guards, off limits,
of course.

565
00:37:28,394 --> 00:37:31,356
Do you pretend,
it's passion,

566
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:34,776
or is it like taking Prozac?

567
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:36,486
Leave Russell out of this.

568
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,329
He better be dead, or I swear
to God I'm going to kill him.

569
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:48,331
Call his publicist.

570
00:37:48,414 --> 00:37:50,458
She'll know where he's hiding.

571
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:51,834
You're on, folks.

572
00:37:57,548 --> 00:37:58,925
Name your terms, Joe.

573
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:03,262
This is about dignity.

574
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:06,933
My daughter's death robbed her of hers,

575
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:10,687
You're going to dredge up whatever
little nobility you have left.

576
00:38:10,728 --> 00:38:15,024
and give the world a little of what she had.

577
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:19,278
Can't believe she'd want this.

578
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:23,282
She was a fighter.

579
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:27,537
Unlike you,

580
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:30,039
I wasn't.

581
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:32,542
I had to make a choice.

582
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:36,713
Jump out the window,

583
00:38:36,796 --> 00:38:39,173
or live by the rules that she died by.

584
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,259
What happened to her?

585
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:45,346
A boy in her school.

586
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:47,890
Armed and fucked up.

587
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:52,061
Headlines that make every
mommy and daddy in America

588
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:53,563
cross their fingers.

589
00:38:53,604 --> 00:38:56,566
Ah, but for the grace of God go I.

590
00:39:01,112 --> 00:39:02,071
So.

591
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:07,493
now I'm using the same right
to bear arms that he had.

592
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:11,581
It's an all-in package,
I was told.

593
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:15,585
And you can't fuck with freedom.

594
00:39:16,836 --> 00:39:18,796
to quote a phrase.

595
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,381
How do you know that?

596
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:22,800
What?
Your father's last words.

597
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:25,595
Ah. Brilliant.

598
00:39:25,637 --> 00:39:28,389
Brilliant way to go out,
I thought.

599
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:30,266
In fact, it's.

600
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:34,187
it was what made me choose
you as the spokesperson.

601
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,314
Nobody knew what my dad's note said.

602
00:39:40,276 --> 00:39:41,986
Just fucking shoot me.

603
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,155
Get it over with,
I'm sick of your bullshit.

604
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,295
How do you know so much about me?

605
00:39:59,337 --> 00:40:01,172
I'm good with details.

606
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:03,633
Nobody knew what was in that note, Joe.

607
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:06,594
Only the cops,
it was a long time ago,

608
00:40:06,678 --> 00:40:08,096
the files are filed.

609
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:11,683
Unless you're a cop.
Is that it?

610
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:14,894
What makes you think you should do this?

611
00:40:14,978 --> 00:40:16,813
You don't have kids,
so you don't know.

612
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:22,652
God.

613
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:25,905
Bless America,

614
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,699
Just give us a minute,
stay there.

615
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:30,952
What do you make of that?

616
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:33,496
Stand beside her.

617
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:34,664
Psych ward.

618
00:40:34,747 --> 00:40:36,290
She may have seen something.

619
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:37,834
I'll check it out.

620
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,338
Hey, get back here.

621
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:47,093
I don't want them getting any closer.

622
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:48,761
What do you got your hands in the air for?

623
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,513
Don't come any closer.

624
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:54,225
Looks like your husband sent some goons

625
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:56,019
to protect you and your relationships.

626
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,688
He has Washington,
the Middle East,

627
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:01,399
the Mayor's office,
the police, the mob.

628
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:05,194
You guys work on all sides of the fence.

629
00:41:05,236 --> 00:41:06,821
Must be hard to keep track.

630
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:07,947
Did you see what happened over there?

631
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:10,199
This is really about Victor.

632
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:11,659
You're a package.

633
00:41:11,743 --> 00:41:12,744
What?

634
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:15,705
Now it's time to make your deal with God.

635
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:17,415
- You all right?
- Say no.

636
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:19,542
His walkie signal is a bad thing

637
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,877
for sensitive explosives detonators.

638
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,755
Get back!

639
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:24,756
There's a bomb in here.

640
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:25,757
Did she say bomb?

641
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,050
So.

642
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:28,051
The chick's a looney.

643
00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:31,721
Now what?

644
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:34,057
Well, thank you,

645
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,476
for getting the ball rolling

646
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,896
but improvise again and everything goes boom.

647
00:41:45,652 --> 00:41:47,111
She said there's a bomb.

648
00:41:47,195 --> 00:41:49,906
Let's call the Henry guys,
just in case.

649
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:52,533
Dispatch 11, 1986,
requesting Henry unit

650
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:55,119
into the alley of 10th and Grace, ASAP.

651
00:41:55,203 --> 00:41:57,580
Request DLT traffic control
between 7th and 12th,

652
00:41:57,664 --> 00:41:58,623
Olive and Bay.

653
00:41:58,706 --> 00:41:59,791
Henry unit on its way.

654
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:02,251
It's gang turf. Could be something
he stuck his nose into.

655
00:42:02,293 --> 00:42:05,088
RTO 1986 Henry Car returning.

656
00:42:05,171 --> 00:42:08,257
Code three, responding
from Valencia to downtown.

657
00:42:08,341 --> 00:42:09,258
All right, copy, Dispatch.

658
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:10,802
Should we clear the area?

659
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:12,637
1986, stay with officer.

660
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,180
wait for H unit and supervisor.

661
00:42:14,263 --> 00:42:16,057
Paramedic, ETA,
seven minutes.

662
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:17,600
Copy.

663
00:42:17,684 --> 00:42:20,687
Gentlemen, you're in a bit
of a grizzly situation here.

664
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,188
Bill,
you're here early.

665
00:42:22,271 --> 00:42:23,231
Give us some space,
all right?

666
00:42:23,314 --> 00:42:25,108
You know I'm always on the hunt for that Emmy.

667
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,068
Yeah. We've got nothing for you, yet.

668
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,737
Family hasn't been informed,
no names yet.

669
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:30,738
What happened?

670
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,198
Bill, we've been here five minutes.

671
00:42:32,281 --> 00:42:34,784
Just back off, you'll be
the first to know, I promise.

672
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,619
Okay. Yeah.
Promises, promises.

673
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:38,454
One Adam 97,
respond.

674
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:41,249
Repeat. One Adam 97,
please respond.

675
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,667
Bill Tollman.

676
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,752
Look at the hotdog stand.

677
00:42:44,836 --> 00:42:46,921
She can tell you the story.

678
00:42:48,006 --> 00:42:49,507
No cameras yet.

679
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,134
Stay on the phone.

680
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:53,761
I want to know who you are
before I get any deeper into this.

681
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:57,473
You were happy to get a tip 20 minutes ago.

682
00:42:57,557 --> 00:43:00,018
Why all the sudden the change of heart?

683
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:02,687
Because a cop is down.

684
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,147
Then you can help.

685
00:43:04,188 --> 00:43:06,524
You're the onlyone I'll let her talk to.

686
00:43:06,607 --> 00:43:08,109
She saw it all.

687
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:11,487
One Adam 18,
Alameda and 11th.

688
00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:13,114
ETA, 12 minutes.

689
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,367
Bill!

690
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:18,036
Jesus Christ Bill.
Get back here.

691
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,620
The bomb squad's on the way.

692
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:22,665
I got a guy on the cell phone,
tells me she's got the whole story.

693
00:43:22,707 --> 00:43:23,666
Son of a bitch.

694
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:24,667
Wait until he gets back here.

695
00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:26,502
No one. not you, not us.
goes over there.

696
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:28,129
I swear to God I'll take you down, Bill.

697
00:43:28,212 --> 00:43:29,172
Now get back here.

698
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:44,812
Joe: Welcome to our party.

699
00:43:44,896 --> 00:43:46,189
We're conferenced.

700
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:49,025
A-team, Liberty Wallace,

701
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:52,028
please let me introduce you to Bill Tollman.

702
00:43:52,111 --> 00:43:54,197
We're lucky to have Bill join us.

703
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,533
He's ambitious, smart,
and for the most part.

704
00:43:57,617 --> 00:43:59,535
honest.

705
00:43:59,577 --> 00:44:00,953
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:02,163
And you are?

707
00:44:02,246 --> 00:44:04,415
I'm Joe.
I'm out for vengeance.

708
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:06,668
Liberty needs forgiveness.

709
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:08,127
And we both need publicity.

710
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:09,504
Why me?

711
00:44:09,545 --> 00:44:11,172
Your lucky day.

712
00:44:11,255 --> 00:44:13,716
Why don't you bring him up to speed, Liberty?

713
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,178
He's got a military-issue,
sniper rifle pointed right at you.

714
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,763
He's an ex cellent shot.

715
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:22,809
There's a bomb in the hot dog cart.

716
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:25,728
It's set to blow, if my cell phone
battery dies, for any reason.

717
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,939
The bomb's big enough
to blow up this entire block.

718
00:44:28,022 --> 00:44:29,357
Think Oklahoma.

719
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,526
That theater's going to let out
in less than an hour.

720
00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:33,361
I have less than an hour left on my battery.

721
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:39,575
I die either way.

722
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:41,703
Unless you get out of here soon, so do you.

723
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:44,205
Aren't you the Liberty Wallace of...

724
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:45,373
Yes.

725
00:44:46,499 --> 00:44:48,001
Any demands?

726
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:51,504
He wants.

727
00:44:57,468 --> 00:45:00,054
He wants somebody to pay
for the death of his daughter.

728
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:02,807
Almost right.

729
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:08,271
Joe's daughter, died.

730
00:45:08,354 --> 00:45:10,398
from a fucked up kid with a gun.

731
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,070
It was a gun manufactured by my company.

732
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:20,450
He wants me to die,
knowing I have blood on my hands.

733
00:45:23,536 --> 00:45:26,080
Joe, you've got to rethink here.

734
00:45:26,164 --> 00:45:27,832
This is crazy.

735
00:45:27,915 --> 00:45:29,334
There's a real gun pointed at you.

736
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:32,086
What I mean is,
there are other ways,

737
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:33,129
Uh-huh.

738
00:45:33,212 --> 00:45:35,340
That's where you come in, Bill.

739
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:39,344
You want me to use
my influence as a journalist,

740
00:45:39,427 --> 00:45:41,846
to debate the right to bear arms with you,

741
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:43,931
because you've got a gun pointed at me?

742
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:47,393
I'm standing next to a bomb
that's on final countdown.

743
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:48,519
Yeah.

744
00:45:50,938 --> 00:45:52,732
What happens when all this is over?

745
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:55,151
I blow my brains out.

746
00:45:55,234 --> 00:45:58,488
This becomes my journalistic moment of truth.

747
00:45:59,614 --> 00:46:01,908
Your Emmy.

748
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:03,826
And your quest.

749
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,870
I'm sorry, Joe.
What do you want me to say here?

750
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:07,330
Say yes.

751
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:10,833
No. Say that you're accountable.

752
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,502
Say yes.

753
00:46:14,879 --> 00:46:16,714
There are plenty of causes, Joe.

754
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,719
Bill, look at Liberty.

755
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:23,846
She's going to die.

756
00:46:23,888 --> 00:46:25,223
It's her choice when,

757
00:46:25,306 --> 00:46:26,933
it's my choice how.

758
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:29,185
You have a similar dilemma.

759
00:46:29,268 --> 00:46:30,603
Now,

760
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:31,604
Iook around.

761
00:46:34,357 --> 00:46:35,566
Jesus, shit.

762
00:46:38,403 --> 00:46:40,655
He shot me.

763
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,198
I'll do whatever he wants.

764
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,701
He's going to die in your arms, Liberty.

765
00:46:44,742 --> 00:46:45,702
Get ready.

766
00:46:45,743 --> 00:46:47,328
Watching someone die.

767
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,206
changes you forever.

768
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:55,211
19-86.

769
00:46:55,294 --> 00:46:57,839
to Dispatch.
We have a female with a gun.

770
00:46:57,922 --> 00:47:00,299
I'm not dying.

771
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:02,969
His father is Senator Robert Tollman.

772
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:05,013
He's also a constitutional lawyer.

773
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:06,472
He lobbied for the NRA,

774
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:08,725
so we know which side his bread is buttered on.

775
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,352
He's proud of his son.

776
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,730
And now like me,

777
00:47:13,813 --> 00:47:17,233
has every reason to switch sides.

778
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:18,359
Hey.

779
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:23,239
How many times do I have to tell you?

780
00:47:23,323 --> 00:47:25,241
Turn that fucking thing off.

781
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:30,913
Just hang on.
Help's coming.

782
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:33,750
No. It's not.

783
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,376
- Camera. Fucking asshole.
- Sue me.

784
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,754
Get him out of here.

785
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:45,178
Can't buy this kind of press.

786
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:47,180
10:00 news, buddy.

787
00:47:48,264 --> 00:47:49,849
Call my father for me.

788
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,800
Why are you doing this?

789
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:25,885
Why?

790
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:27,470
Why are you doing this?

791
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:29,222
Tell me.

792
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:33,935
Your dick is the size of
the little trigger on that gun.

793
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,603
That makes you nothing, Joe.

794
00:48:35,687 --> 00:48:37,563
You're less than nothing.

795
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:40,358
You probably didn't even have a daughter,

796
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:41,943
if you did,
she's better off dead.

797
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:50,034
I'll forgive you for that,

798
00:48:52,453 --> 00:48:53,830
given the circumstances.

799
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,207
Just kill me.

800
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,792
- Get it over with.
- Shut up.

801
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:58,918
I'm not the one shooting.

802
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,003
I can't take anymore.

803
00:49:03,715 --> 00:49:04,924
I'm going to hang up.

804
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:13,182
That asshole's shooting with a 9 millimeter,

805
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:15,727
He hasn't got a hope
of hitting you from that distance.

806
00:49:18,563 --> 00:49:19,439
Ah, Victor.

807
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:20,898
You have made my day.

808
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:23,318
Hello.

809
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:35,538
It's kind of ironic,

810
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,457
me saving your life.

811
00:49:45,298 --> 00:49:46,841
They're here.

812
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,361
The officer went down over there.

813
00:50:06,444 --> 00:50:08,946
The lady with the bomb is across the street.

814
00:50:12,116 --> 00:50:14,035
It's time to do something.

815
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,454
Bill has a tape recorder,
in his suit pocket.

816
00:50:16,537 --> 00:50:18,915
Name names,
Liberty.

817
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:20,625
Blow the lobbies wide open.

818
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,669
Payoffs are always good news breakers.

819
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:24,045
You're an amateur, Joe.

820
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,381
No. No. No. Don't tell me that
you're worried about the fallout.

821
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:28,549
Your husband, or someone he works for,

822
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:31,427
has or dered the CIA thugs
to put a bullet in you.

823
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:32,887
Is that the world you want to live in?

824
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,347
What do you think you can accomplish

825
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,266
by me babbling about Senator-this
and Senator-that?

826
00:50:37,308 --> 00:50:38,768
That's not going to do anything.

827
00:50:38,851 --> 00:50:39,769
It's a start.

828
00:50:39,852 --> 00:50:41,604
It's an end, Joe.

829
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,149
Let me do what I can really do.

830
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:47,652
Let me work from the inside.

831
00:50:47,735 --> 00:50:49,028
I can.
I can.

832
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:52,490
I can do something.

833
00:50:52,573 --> 00:50:55,451
So that's what you tell yourself every morning?

834
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:57,495
Joe, I can really change things.

835
00:50:57,578 --> 00:50:59,539
I promise you I'll do it.

836
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:00,707
I promise.

837
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,844
Police.
Put them down.

838
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:15,305
Come on.

839
00:51:16,931 --> 00:51:18,433
Come on.

840
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:25,023
We can always count on our nation's
finest to serve and protect.

841
00:51:25,106 --> 00:51:27,483
Shots fired. I've got
a civilian down possibly dead.

842
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:28,484
Looks like a shooter.

843
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:45,793
Senator Libby

844
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:48,171
took at least three payments in cash.

845
00:51:48,254 --> 00:51:51,799
Senator Lipton, Crick,
Congressmen Gomez.

846
00:51:51,883 --> 00:51:54,218
Check Geneva bank accounts,

847
00:51:54,302 --> 00:51:55,678
Swiss Union bank accounts,

848
00:51:55,762 --> 00:51:57,347
Cayman Islands, Bahamas.

849
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,432
My husband.

850
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:02,810
Victor Wallace is fucking the president's wife,

851
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:04,187
among others.

852
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,605
Presidents.

853
00:52:05,688 --> 00:52:06,606
or wives?

854
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:07,690
Humph.

855
00:52:09,484 --> 00:52:10,818
What do you want me to do?

856
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,862
Nothing.
You're on a roll.

857
00:52:12,945 --> 00:52:13,821
Keep it going.

858
00:52:13,863 --> 00:52:15,865
You're already on the news.

859
00:52:15,907 --> 00:52:19,702
Victor's mobilized
every senator I've just mentioned.

860
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:21,788
The police chief is in his back pocket.

861
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:25,625
He supplies the gang that controls
this corner, for Christ's sake.

862
00:52:28,461 --> 00:52:30,004
He?

863
00:52:30,088 --> 00:52:31,798
Okay. I.

864
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:33,341
We.

865
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,801
I.

866
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:36,719
I'm in this, okay?

867
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:38,513
Is that what you want me to say, 'I'm in it'?

868
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,015
Yes.

869
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,228
Now, who are you going to trust?

870
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:46,896
Nobody.

871
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:50,274
- Keep talking.
- No.

872
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:53,361
I'll name names,
I'll bury everyone who deserves it,

873
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,363
but you have to shut this bomb off.

874
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:57,949
Uhh. can't.

875
00:52:58,032 --> 00:52:59,534
Then I can't.

876
00:52:59,575 --> 00:53:00,785
Fair enough.

877
00:53:00,868 --> 00:53:02,787
You've done your job anyway.

878
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:05,373
Now we can depend on Bill's dad, the senator,

879
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:07,375
and his newfound quest.

880
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:10,378
He'll go down as a hero for the cause.

881
00:53:13,214 --> 00:53:14,882
It was a life well spent.

882
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:16,801
In the big picture.

883
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:29,397
Have a hot dog.

884
00:53:30,898 --> 00:53:32,900
You don't want to go out on an empty stomach.

885
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:34,694
Let them take him away.

886
00:53:57,925 --> 00:53:58,926
Ma'am.

887
00:53:58,968 --> 00:54:00,887
Come with me, ma'am.

888
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:03,765
Over here.

889
00:54:03,848 --> 00:54:05,683
Every Thursday,

890
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:06,434
they meet backstage,

891
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,603
go into Russell's dressing room,
and lock the door.

892
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:10,480
They order in.

893
00:54:14,942 --> 00:54:16,694
Bastard changed the lock.

894
00:54:16,778 --> 00:54:17,737
Fuck.

895
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,286
Yeah, she slinks out sometime during the night,

896
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,122
and we don't see Russell again
until the next performance.

897
00:54:39,092 --> 00:54:40,510
Oh. Ex cept for tonight.

898
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:42,804
He's probably in there,
fucked to death.

899
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:44,305
Uh-oh.

900
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,890
Time to call a locksmith.

901
00:54:45,974 --> 00:54:48,351
Back up's coming in from 53.

902
00:54:48,434 --> 00:54:50,353
Look's like we've got ourselves a sniper.

903
00:54:50,395 --> 00:54:52,105
There's no I.D.
on the woman,

904
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:53,481
no trace on her cell phone yet.

905
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,691
If she's chained to the stand.

906
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:57,318
She told officers there was a bomb, all right?

907
00:54:57,402 --> 00:54:59,320
We believe she's working with the sniper.

908
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,948
The man on the ground out there,
is a reporter with KNBS.

909
00:55:02,031 --> 00:55:04,075
Bill Tollman,
the senator's son.

910
00:55:04,158 --> 00:55:05,535
We believe shot.

911
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:08,538
We have a confirmed fatality
in a parking structure back here.

912
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,039
We don't have enough information on that yet,

913
00:55:10,081 --> 00:55:13,418
but we can't rule out terrorists,
militia, or just a basic nutcase.

914
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:16,254
We're going to block
5th to 10th, Olive to Berry.

915
00:55:16,337 --> 00:55:18,506
We've got at least 20 buildings to evacuate.

916
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:19,674
We're thin on manpower.

917
00:55:19,757 --> 00:55:22,051
Use uniforms to back you up.

918
00:55:22,093 --> 00:55:24,053
All right?
Be safe, gentlemen. Let's go.

919
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:28,641
Captain.

920
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,727
We've got no location on the shooter,

921
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:32,687
no I.D. on the woman.
We've got backup coming in.

922
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:33,938
We're set up in the garage back here.

923
00:55:34,022 --> 00:55:36,441
Somebody shut them down.
Jesus.

924
00:55:37,942 --> 00:55:39,819
Clear the media back, please.

925
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,993
We are live.

926
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,621
The drama continues in downtown LA,

927
00:55:50,705 --> 00:55:53,041
where we apparently have
a fatal shooting of an officer,

928
00:55:53,082 --> 00:55:54,959
here at the corner of Grace and 9th.

929
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:56,044
Is your wife going to be tuning in?

930
00:55:56,127 --> 00:55:57,879
No.

931
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,048
But I guarantee your husband's watching.

932
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:01,132
Back to you, Dennis.

933
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:04,886
My husband.

934
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:09,515
My husband's on the way to the airport by now.

935
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,644
He will be unreachable for comment.

936
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:17,774
Why'd you marry him?

937
00:56:17,857 --> 00:56:20,109
I thought he could save my father's company.

938
00:56:21,986 --> 00:56:23,655
It was a bad idea.

939
00:56:23,738 --> 00:56:25,365
I even thought I loved him.

940
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:28,826
Should we do a shield rescue
for the guy on the ground?

941
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,828
No. It's too risky until
we find out where the shooter is.

942
00:56:31,913 --> 00:56:33,665
Poor bastard's gonna bleed out.

943
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:36,459
I want all traffic locked down

944
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:37,919
from 5th to 9th.

945
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,961
Yeah, that's done already.

946
00:56:39,003 --> 00:56:41,798
Who's the negotiator on call?

947
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:43,132
John's going to be here in 10 minutes, Captain.

948
00:56:43,174 --> 00:56:46,636
Joe, more death isn't going
to make the guns disappear,

949
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:47,762
it's not going to bring your daughter back.

950
00:56:47,845 --> 00:56:51,265
I'm begging you.

951
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,350
Oh. Liberty.

952
00:56:53,518 --> 00:56:55,687
Tiananmen Square boiled down to one man,

953
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:58,856
standing in front of a tank,
that couldn't move or shoot.

954
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,609
Because human dignity was stronger

955
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:02,986
than steel or bullets.

956
00:57:03,027 --> 00:57:03,987
It changed a nation.

957
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:06,447
That was a completely different situation.

958
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,991
What's the difference?

959
00:57:08,032 --> 00:57:09,742
We've got gated communities,

960
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,620
security systems, and kids
carrying combat weapons,

961
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,497
all because most people

962
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:16,332
haven't even read the 2nd amendment.

963
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:17,333
So,

964
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:18,626
our freedom of speech,

965
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,044
is protected,

966
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:22,630
as long as we don't piss off a guy with a gun.

967
00:57:22,714 --> 00:57:25,299
I'm not brave enough
to take a bullet for my country.

968
00:57:25,383 --> 00:57:27,010
You underestimate yourself.

969
00:57:27,093 --> 00:57:30,221
The one thing that guarantees our freedom,

970
00:57:30,305 --> 00:57:33,558
and independence,
is responsibility.

971
00:57:34,642 --> 00:57:37,645
We lost that somewhere between
Vietnam and presidential blowjobs.

972
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:41,399
Many of the Fathers of the Constitution.

973
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:44,360
had slaves,
but they wrote a document,

974
00:57:44,402 --> 00:57:45,945
about freedom.

975
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,947
Go figure.

976
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:51,743
So you see,
things are meant to change.

977
00:57:51,826 --> 00:57:54,287
We're all grown up now.

978
00:57:55,663 --> 00:57:57,165
So are you, Liberty.

979
00:57:57,248 --> 00:57:58,916
I think you've figured out

980
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,377
there's no such thing

981
00:58:01,419 --> 00:58:03,588
as a politically correct gun.

982
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:05,506
I'll say all that to the press.

983
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,009
But please turn this bomb off, Joe.

984
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,094
I don't know what to do next.

985
00:58:10,178 --> 00:58:13,848
It feels like this whole thing was a dream.

986
00:58:15,016 --> 00:58:17,018
I should have told you before, but I.

987
00:58:18,478 --> 00:58:19,896
What do we do now?

988
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,381
Huh.

989
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,054
The cops have.

990
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,056
G-36's.

991
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,891
Did you make that deal too?

992
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,559
It was more of a donation.

993
00:58:58,643 --> 00:59:00,728
I'll bet that you were a hero.

994
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:03,064
We got a big luncheon,

995
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:05,733
key to the city,
mayor in my pocket,

996
00:59:05,817 --> 00:59:08,778
- You make it sound so easy.
- If you've got the cash flow,

997
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:10,279
a little planning goes a long way.

998
00:59:10,321 --> 00:59:13,032
Did they know
you had just sold 26 stripped down

999
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,451
P-99's that went straight to the streets?

1000
00:59:15,493 --> 00:59:18,788
I guess it was one of those
an-eye-for-an-eye deals.

1001
00:59:19,914 --> 00:59:22,041
It's easy to get lost in a deal.

1002
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,252
I know it's not an excuse.

1003
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:28,131
This is a perfect fucking nightmare.

1004
00:59:28,172 --> 00:59:31,050
127 locations for an asshole with a gun.

1005
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,428
We've got a cell phone we can't bust into,

1006
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,637
and a bomb next to a theater.

1007
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:35,763
Anybody picking up in there yet?

1008
00:59:35,847 --> 00:59:37,598
- Just voicemail.
- Fucking voicemail.

1009
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:43,688
Well.

1010
00:59:44,772 --> 00:59:46,274
the shooter is back.

1011
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,276
Who's he work for?

1012
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,819
Your husband or the CIA?

1013
00:59:49,902 --> 00:59:52,947
Whoever's got the cash.

1014
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,754
Who's the cowboy in the chopper?

1015
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:10,173
Get him higher,
he's surveillance.

1016
01:00:10,214 --> 01:00:11,758
I don't want him
landing on the fucking rooftop.

1017
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,180
Okay, you guys,
let's get in here.

1018
01:00:17,221 --> 01:00:18,181
Let's get into the theater.

1019
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,976
I should have told you before, but I.

1020
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,229
What do we do now?

1021
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:26,814
It's up to you.

1022
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:28,650
Do you still love me?

1023
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,444
Of course I do.

1024
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,197
How about you?

1025
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:35,323
Of course.

1026
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:38,910
It won't make a bit of difference.

1027
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:47,710
How full is the theater?

1028
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:49,295
It's the last performance.

1029
01:01:01,432 --> 01:01:03,142
I figure 10 to clear the building,

1030
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,520
Copy that.
No one exits the front door.

1031
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,146
Hold until we've cleared all rear exits.

1032
01:01:21,953 --> 01:01:24,038
Senator Tollman's son was just shot,

1033
01:01:24,122 --> 01:01:26,249
by the same guy who's got Liberty.

1034
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,755
I'm calling your husband.

1035
01:01:32,797 --> 01:01:34,424
Why?

1036
01:01:41,472 --> 01:01:42,807
Yeah.

1037
01:01:44,017 --> 01:01:45,601
Who called the militia?

1038
01:01:47,145 --> 01:01:48,563
I want to talk to Liberty.

1039
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:49,981
Touching.

1040
01:01:50,064 --> 01:01:52,025
It's not one of yours?

1041
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,985
That's not good,
Victor.

1042
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:55,069
Liberty are you there?

1043
01:01:55,153 --> 01:01:57,739
Such a sweet name,
don't you think?

1044
01:01:57,822 --> 01:01:59,449
Her parents were Republican.

1045
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:01,868
I want to talk to my wife.

1046
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,369
I'm here.

1047
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,912
Alive.

1048
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,956
And on TV.

1049
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,625
I. uh.

1050
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:12,462
I know, you're doing what you have to do.

1051
01:02:17,175 --> 01:02:18,718
You know who's calling the shots?

1052
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,386
The president's wife?

1053
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:23,222
Come on.

1054
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,935
No, of course not.
If it were, you'd be standing here.

1055
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:36,277
I'm doing what I can, but.

1056
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:39,155
You know the rules, right?

1057
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,658
Aw, honey,

1058
01:02:41,741 --> 01:02:43,284
fuck you.

1059
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,370
Joe, hang up.

1060
01:02:45,453 --> 01:02:47,747
No, what she meant is,

1061
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,916
why don't you let her die with some dignity?

1062
01:02:58,841 --> 01:02:59,926
Get the car.

1063
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,844
- Mr. Wallace is leaving.
- Yes, sir.

1064
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,852
Right through here.
Right this way.

1065
01:03:09,936 --> 01:03:10,979
Through here.

1066
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,276
How do you know Victor?

1067
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,486
Classified.

1068
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,949
Keep moving this way.
Come on, let's go!

1069
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,993
- Copy that.
- Who the fuck is she?

1070
01:03:25,076 --> 01:03:26,744
We just I.D.'d her,
Liberty Wallace.

1071
01:03:26,828 --> 01:03:29,330
the VP of McCloud,
married to the CEO,

1072
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:31,249
connections up the wazoo.

1073
01:03:31,332 --> 01:03:34,210
Jesus Christ.
I know him. Victor.

1074
01:03:34,252 --> 01:03:36,254
Yeah, we're trying to track him down right now.

1075
01:03:36,337 --> 01:03:39,257
Then there's no way she's
with the shooter, she's a hostage.

1076
01:03:41,509 --> 01:03:42,885
So I'm bait.

1077
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:45,388
No, more like.

1078
01:03:46,848 --> 01:03:49,225
more like a showpiece.

1079
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:52,270
I like your reckless side.

1080
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:56,190
You travel without your body guard,

1081
01:03:56,274 --> 01:03:59,277
five hours every week and sometimes twice.

1082
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,947
You're a little bit more
accessible and predictable

1083
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:04,365
than the president's wife.

1084
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:07,660
So, who's pissed off at Victor, the president?

1085
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,211
No.

1086
01:04:20,006 --> 01:04:22,342
It's all me this time.

1087
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,846
I was a dad.

1088
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,599
I'm not anymore.

1089
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:36,189
Somebody's pulling your string.
Who is it?

1090
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,692
No one.

1091
01:04:41,235 --> 01:04:42,570
Not now.

1092
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:45,740
Never thought my skills from
my former life would ever payoff.

1093
01:04:47,408 --> 01:04:48,826
CIA?

1094
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,415
Well.

1095
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,001
that too.

1096
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,171
Come on,
if I'm gonna die

1097
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:02,632
I have the right to know
my assassin a little better.

1098
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,052
I worked covert.

1099
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,930
covert operations for the CIA.

1100
01:05:08,972 --> 01:05:12,183
I was in China during Tiananmen Square,

1101
01:05:12,266 --> 01:05:16,312
Cuba, Panama,
and I was in Columbia.

1102
01:05:17,772 --> 01:05:19,440
when my daughter was killed.

1103
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:45,258
This is Captain Hank Wilford.

1104
01:05:46,426 --> 01:05:48,094
Could you tell us what this is about?

1105
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:53,433
I don't want anyone else to die
because they're talking to me.

1106
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:54,976
So, what's it gonna be?

1107
01:05:55,059 --> 01:05:56,060
Huh-uh-uh.

1108
01:05:56,144 --> 01:05:57,437
It's your show, baby.

1109
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,647
Just leave me out of this for now.

1110
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:05,528
There's a bomb in the hot dog cart!

1111
01:06:06,612 --> 01:06:09,866
It's set to blow when my cell phone dies.

1112
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:11,993
In about 15 minutes.

1113
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:15,204
I'm chained to the cart.

1114
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,333
What are the demands?

1115
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:24,130
A public debate of the 2nd amendment.

1116
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,798
- Hmm.
- Heard of it?

1117
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:27,008
Go, girl.

1118
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,427
I'd like to understand,

1119
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,429
are there any other demands?

1120
01:06:31,512 --> 01:06:33,264
Can I come closer?

1121
01:06:33,348 --> 01:06:35,266
Any other demands?

1122
01:06:35,975 --> 01:06:36,893
No.

1123
01:06:36,976 --> 01:06:38,353
No!

1124
01:06:46,944 --> 01:06:49,322
Liberty,

1125
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,574
I will kill anyone who comes close.

1126
01:06:51,658 --> 01:06:53,660
We have no confirmation yet,

1127
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,579
but it appears that KNBS reporter, Bill Tollman

1128
01:06:56,663 --> 01:06:57,997
has been seriously hurt.

1129
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:00,416
And that Liberty Wallace of McCloud Guns

1130
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,044
is demanding a public debate
about the constitution,

1131
01:07:03,127 --> 01:07:05,588
and its role in our violent times.

1132
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:08,549
She's grandstanding,
got to be militia.

1133
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,634
Sir.

1134
01:07:09,717 --> 01:07:11,844
Yeah.
Yes, sir.

1135
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:13,388
Yes, sir, Liberty Wallace.

1136
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,765
You were good under the pressure.

1137
01:07:15,848 --> 01:07:17,684
And the whole world will applaud you.

1138
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,727
Or laugh at me.

1139
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,896
The press is the least
of my concerns at this point.

1140
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:23,481
I'll try to move them back, but.

1141
01:07:25,566 --> 01:07:27,568
Yes, sir.
I'll move them back right away.

1142
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:28,736
Thank you, sir.

1143
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,613
Get rid of the press.
Tell them it's a safety issue.

1144
01:07:30,697 --> 01:07:32,407
Uptown doesn't want this thing
under a microscope.

1145
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,075
They're gonna make a move, Joe.

1146
01:07:34,158 --> 01:07:36,160
They'll never disarm that bomb.

1147
01:07:36,244 --> 01:07:38,121
They probably already guessed that.

1148
01:07:38,204 --> 01:07:40,832
You won't be alone in the final moment.

1149
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:45,753
Status on the theater?

1150
01:07:45,837 --> 01:07:47,547
Somebody welded all the side exits shut.

1151
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,589
We've got an entering team coming in,

1152
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:50,967
- But the fire department.
- Is stuck in traffic.

1153
01:07:51,009 --> 01:07:53,636
- All exits?
- Yeah, our cutters won't work.

1154
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,055
The only exit is onto the street,
and through the front door.

1155
01:07:57,432 --> 01:07:58,725
So in effect they're hostages.

1156
01:08:09,444 --> 01:08:10,945
Tell me about your daughter again.

1157
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:23,333
A boy at school put a gun to her head,

1158
01:08:23,374 --> 01:08:25,335
and asked her

1159
01:08:25,418 --> 01:08:27,170
if she believed in God.

1160
01:08:28,463 --> 01:08:29,589
What did she say?

1161
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:31,257
I don't know.

1162
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,217
What did she say?

1163
01:08:33,301 --> 01:08:34,844
I don't know.

1164
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:43,645
Is that robot ready to go?

1165
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,063
It'll be here in 15.

1166
01:08:45,146 --> 01:08:46,481
What about the bomb truck?

1167
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:49,442
We've got one coming in from the 48.
ETA. 30 minutes.

1168
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:50,485
General evacuation?

1169
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:51,903
We've got a full retreat going.

1170
01:08:51,986 --> 01:08:54,864
We'll find this son of a bitch.
It'll just take a little time.

1171
01:08:54,947 --> 01:08:56,157
Tell me about your father.

1172
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:04,540
My father.

1173
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:13,675
He was my hero.

1174
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:19,389
He was.

1175
01:09:26,312 --> 01:09:27,563
After he...

1176
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,108
you know.

1177
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:37,365
I had to leave school to earn a living.

1178
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,659
One thing led to the next.

1179
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:44,205
I found myself working in the family business

1180
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:45,999
that was no longer family-owned.

1181
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:47,709
Captain, I've only got 10 guys.

1182
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,211
We should be fine once the 53 squad shows up.

1183
01:09:50,253 --> 01:09:52,630
That should be another 10 or 12 minutes.

1184
01:09:52,714 --> 01:09:53,881
We're not gonna make it.

1185
01:09:53,965 --> 01:09:56,175
It's all I knew.
Along came Victor,

1186
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:58,678
he was brilliant, thought he could
save my father's company.

1187
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,388
Our first big deal was with the Saudis.

1188
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:03,308
But the Iraqis were shooting
us with our own guns.

1189
01:10:03,391 --> 01:10:05,935
What do people think the government
does with all those used weapons?

1190
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:08,563
Melt them down?
Make little sculptures out of them?

1191
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,148
Once we took the company international,

1192
01:10:10,231 --> 01:10:11,899
suddenly we were in a different league.

1193
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,526
It got complicated.

1194
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:15,903
Here I am.

1195
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,615
And Russell made you feel human again.

1196
01:10:19,699 --> 01:10:21,826
And anonymous.

1197
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:26,706
You know,
my great-great-grandfather,

1198
01:10:27,999 --> 01:10:32,045
he designed the gun that changed
the outcome of the Civil War.

1199
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:37,633
I grew up thinking that's
what we were still doing.

1200
01:10:40,678 --> 01:10:41,971
We are securing the building.

1201
01:10:54,776 --> 01:10:56,569
I'm really sorry about your daughter.

1202
01:11:16,297 --> 01:11:17,298
Joe.

1203
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:40,029
One less breathing to help us tell our story.

1204
01:11:41,739 --> 01:11:44,993
We've got the shooter
on the roof of a building at 8.

1205
01:11:47,453 --> 01:11:49,622
I don't care if it looks like the Russians,

1206
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:51,916
or the Pakistanis,
or the Girl Scouts,

1207
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:54,085
that guy's voice is American.

1208
01:11:54,168 --> 01:11:56,129
This is an internal thing,
get on it.

1209
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:58,131
I want to know who the fuck else
is shooting at my wife.

1210
01:12:02,635 --> 01:12:04,137
Yeah.

1211
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,555
Where are you going?

1212
01:12:07,348 --> 01:12:08,349
Why?

1213
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,647
The bereaved husband.

1214
01:12:14,689 --> 01:12:16,482
When are you gonna stop screwing around

1215
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:19,235
and tell me what this is all about?

1216
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,655
You're doing it by the book:

1217
01:12:22,697 --> 01:12:25,199
go on a business trip:

1218
01:12:25,283 --> 01:12:27,160
be unavailable for comment:

1219
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:28,286
touch down in Washington

1220
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:31,247
for a little face time with the client:

1221
01:12:31,331 --> 01:12:33,082
check the temperature.

1222
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:35,793
I don't really have a whole lot
of choice, now do I?

1223
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:38,963
Joe.

1224
01:12:41,883 --> 01:12:43,343
We know each other don't we?

1225
01:12:45,136 --> 01:12:46,346
Victor: Don't we?

1226
01:12:47,805 --> 01:12:49,307
You do any time in South America?

1227
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:52,769
Well, who didn't?

1228
01:12:52,852 --> 01:12:55,229
None of us really came through that

1229
01:12:55,313 --> 01:12:56,689
with our mental health intact,
did we?

1230
01:12:56,773 --> 01:12:58,483
God knows,
it took me a while

1231
01:12:58,524 --> 01:13:00,360
to pull my shit together when I got back.

1232
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:01,653
Yeah.

1233
01:13:01,654 --> 01:13:02,862
Yeah,

1234
01:13:02,904 --> 01:13:05,448
it's a mental health thing.

1235
01:13:07,325 --> 01:13:09,369
You talk like a company man.

1236
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:11,871
Or at least, well,
you were a company man,

1237
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:14,207
because they'd never go for
this kind of theatrical bullshit.

1238
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,169
What is your beef with me?

1239
01:13:18,252 --> 01:13:20,380
That you'd run away and let them take Liberty.

1240
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:24,050
That you're not man enough
to stand up for your wife.

1241
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:26,678
Hope you're impressed with your life.

1242
01:13:32,892 --> 01:13:33,935
Grace and 9th.

1243
01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:36,604
- Sure about that, sir?
- Grace and 9th!

1244
01:13:36,688 --> 01:13:37,689
You've got it.

1245
01:13:49,993 --> 01:13:52,495
- Shooter's still out here.
- Shit, take cover fast.

1246
01:13:52,578 --> 01:13:54,038
The sniper is shooting
at our guys on the ground.

1247
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:56,791
How many down?

1248
01:13:56,874 --> 01:13:58,251
No report yet.

1249
01:14:02,588 --> 01:14:04,340
Luke, it's Mac. We have the shooter.

1250
01:14:04,424 --> 01:14:05,800
We've got the guyon the roof.

1251
01:14:05,883 --> 01:14:08,177
Nobody moves until we get
more information. Understood?

1252
01:14:08,261 --> 01:14:10,054
Hail Mary, full of grace,

1253
01:14:10,096 --> 01:14:11,347
the Lord is with thee,

1254
01:14:11,431 --> 01:14:13,641
blessed art thou amongst women,

1255
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:17,145
blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

1256
01:14:18,271 --> 01:14:20,189
Looks like we've got a problem up here.

1257
01:14:20,273 --> 01:14:21,399
It's not the sniper.

1258
01:14:21,441 --> 01:14:23,943
Well, who the fuck is he?
Why is he shooting?

1259
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:25,403
No report yet.

1260
01:14:25,445 --> 01:14:28,740
...pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death.

1261
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:30,283
Amen.

1262
01:14:31,617 --> 01:14:34,287
Chuck says he's talking
the gold star clearance.

1263
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:35,621
CIA?

1264
01:14:35,663 --> 01:14:37,790
Jesus, get him down here
if he's still breathing.

1265
01:14:43,463 --> 01:14:45,006
Joe,

1266
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:47,383
what is enough?

1267
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:50,720
Are you begging for lives?

1268
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,059
Yes.

1269
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:04,400
Where are the shots coming from?

1270
01:15:04,484 --> 01:15:06,444
My guys are thinking the brick,
maybe the concrete.

1271
01:15:06,486 --> 01:15:07,862
I'm thinking higher than the.

1272
01:15:07,945 --> 01:15:09,822
Way too much information.
Status on backup?

1273
01:15:26,839 --> 01:15:28,883
It's probably a hoax.

1274
01:15:28,966 --> 01:15:31,260
I think it has something
to do with her husband.

1275
01:15:31,344 --> 01:15:33,680
Russell's been playing with fire.

1276
01:15:33,721 --> 01:15:35,723
Now, don't be jealous, dear.

1277
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,684
Oh, fuck off.

1278
01:15:39,018 --> 01:15:40,812
Victor knew your voice.

1279
01:15:44,148 --> 01:15:45,441
Is this some kind of setup?

1280
01:15:45,525 --> 01:15:48,194
Come on, now think hard
and you'll get it all figured out.

1281
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:49,988
What the fuck do you mean, think?

1282
01:15:50,029 --> 01:15:51,531
Come on, come clean.

1283
01:15:51,572 --> 01:15:54,242
You've taken my life,
you owe me that much.

1284
01:15:54,325 --> 01:15:56,536
If I'm CIA or FBl,

1285
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,287
then I went through all of this

1286
01:15:58,371 --> 01:16:01,582
because someone very high up
wants a lot of visibility.

1287
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:04,127
Okay, okay,
it was a stupid thought.

1288
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:06,671
Look, you can't write this off
to be some big conspiracy.

1289
01:16:06,754 --> 01:16:09,048
That's gonna confuse
the fuck out of all of them.

1290
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:12,301
Think. Think about how
you're doing on the scoreboard.

1291
01:16:12,385 --> 01:16:14,262
It's not like I woke up one day and said,

1292
01:16:14,345 --> 01:16:17,598
'Wow, it's great to be
in the lethal weapons business.'

1293
01:16:17,682 --> 01:16:19,559
It's like the guy on the corner

1294
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,894
who sells newspapers,
it's what I do.

1295
01:16:21,978 --> 01:16:24,147
- What else am I gonna do?
- Be the boss!

1296
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:25,898
It's your life, isn't it?

1297
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:28,735
If the idea was for me to see God,

1298
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:29,861
you've achieved it.

1299
01:16:29,902 --> 01:16:32,030
I mean, I prayed, for Christ's sake.

1300
01:16:32,071 --> 01:16:35,074
To the parking garage.
Let's assemble in there. Let's go!

1301
01:16:46,252 --> 01:16:48,838
When my daughter was killed,
my wife came apart.

1302
01:16:51,341 --> 01:16:53,593
We met the parents of the kid who did it.

1303
01:16:55,928 --> 01:16:57,680
His father...

1304
01:16:57,764 --> 01:16:59,432
cried.

1305
01:16:59,515 --> 01:17:01,309
And he told us that he had taught his son

1306
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:03,519
how to use a gun safely.

1307
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:09,400
Never saw it coming.

1308
01:17:11,903 --> 01:17:13,780
I wanted to kill that kid.

1309
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:17,283
Then I wanted to kill the father.

1310
01:17:20,286 --> 01:17:22,121
But.

1311
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:24,415
here I am instead.

1312
01:17:30,171 --> 01:17:31,464
I like you.

1313
01:17:34,008 --> 01:17:35,760
This is no way to die.

1314
01:17:38,137 --> 01:17:40,098
For us there's no other wayout.

1315
01:17:42,809 --> 01:17:45,103
I thought about this for a long time.

1316
01:17:46,354 --> 01:17:48,481
Bomb squad wants us to move further back.

1317
01:17:48,564 --> 01:17:50,316
Captain, it's Victor Wallace on the line.

1318
01:17:50,358 --> 01:17:51,442
Nobody move.

1319
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:57,240
Victor, Hank here.

1320
01:17:58,408 --> 01:17:59,367
Hank?

1321
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:02,120
Jesus Christ.

1322
01:18:02,161 --> 01:18:03,997
Do you know what this is about?

1323
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,248
I was hoping you'd tell me.

1324
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:07,166
I don't believe you.

1325
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,794
We found a guyon the roof
shooting at her. He looked CIA.

1326
01:18:09,877 --> 01:18:12,296
- Did you get him?
- No, somebody else shot him.

1327
01:18:12,338 --> 01:18:15,675
The guy we've got is not the sniper
or maybe he's one of them.

1328
01:18:15,717 --> 01:18:17,510
My ass is hanging out here, Victor.

1329
01:18:17,552 --> 01:18:19,679
I need you to tell me what's going on.

1330
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:21,431
What's going on?
We're dealing with a nutcase.

1331
01:18:21,514 --> 01:18:22,807
That's what's going on.

1332
01:18:22,849 --> 01:18:23,975
Yeah, or terrorists buying time.

1333
01:18:24,058 --> 01:18:26,519
It's only been half an hour
and the press is still stacking up.

1334
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:27,937
I'm five minutes away.

1335
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,402
This action may be connected
to the recent lawsuit

1336
01:18:34,485 --> 01:18:36,612
filed by seven of the largest gunmakers,

1337
01:18:36,696 --> 01:18:39,532
alleging that efforts by government to impose

1338
01:18:39,574 --> 01:18:41,868
gun safety measures,
amounts to a conspiracy

1339
01:18:41,909 --> 01:18:45,288
that violates constitutional
guarantees of free trade.

1340
01:18:45,371 --> 01:18:47,248
Wallace's company, McCloud Guns,

1341
01:18:47,332 --> 01:18:48,875
is at the center of this controversy

1342
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:52,128
by refusing to become signatory
to any government proposal

1343
01:18:52,211 --> 01:18:54,172
that legislates more controls.

1344
01:18:54,213 --> 01:18:55,340
Thanks for that breaking news.

1345
01:18:55,381 --> 01:18:57,633
Now on the international.

1346
01:18:57,717 --> 01:19:00,136
31 cities and countries
have brought charges against

1347
01:19:00,219 --> 01:19:02,347
manufacturers claiming they're not doing enough

1348
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:04,932
to keep guns out of the
hands of children and criminals.

1349
01:19:05,016 --> 01:19:07,310
Apparently, Wallace is
staging a high-stakes protest

1350
01:19:07,393 --> 01:19:08,853
against the very industry

1351
01:19:08,936 --> 01:19:10,855
that made her family famous in America.

1352
01:19:10,897 --> 01:19:11,898
Back to you, Dennis.

1353
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:13,858
We're in the final stretch, Liberty.

1354
01:19:15,526 --> 01:19:16,402
So,

1355
01:19:17,528 --> 01:19:18,946
what's your plan?

1356
01:19:20,948 --> 01:19:22,533
I don't want to die.

1357
01:19:24,077 --> 01:19:25,787
I don't want to die.

1358
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,879
I don't want anyone else
to die because of me, Joe.

1359
01:19:36,255 --> 01:19:37,632
Me neither.

1360
01:19:44,097 --> 01:19:45,056
You know,

1361
01:19:45,098 --> 01:19:47,183
the NRA is just gonna
spin this and say it's because

1362
01:19:47,266 --> 01:19:48,810
of people like you that we need to be armed.

1363
01:19:51,104 --> 01:19:54,440
Well, I was an honest law-abiding citizen.

1364
01:19:54,524 --> 01:19:56,818
By that definition I deserve to be armed.

1365
01:19:57,944 --> 01:20:00,655
And I was acting out against the oppression

1366
01:20:00,738 --> 01:20:02,115
of our freedom.

1367
01:20:07,286 --> 01:20:08,538
There it is.

1368
01:20:21,134 --> 01:20:23,553
You know,
I first saw you in Jerusalem.

1369
01:20:23,636 --> 01:20:25,263
About three years ago.

1370
01:20:26,389 --> 01:20:28,599
You must have made a hell of a deal.

1371
01:20:28,641 --> 01:20:30,643
'Cause they were kissing your ass.

1372
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:36,858
- Did I meet you?
- Nope.

1373
01:20:39,277 --> 01:20:41,696
I did business with Victor, though.

1374
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:43,573
On behalf of the Saudis.

1375
01:20:43,656 --> 01:20:46,242
It seems he likes to sell on all sides.

1376
01:20:47,452 --> 01:20:49,954
We met in our early days.

1377
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:53,833
Seriously flawed mission to Columbia.

1378
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:56,836
I saved his life.

1379
01:20:58,421 --> 01:20:59,964
How funny.

1380
01:21:01,174 --> 01:21:03,801
I saved the life of the man
that killed my daughter.

1381
01:21:14,646 --> 01:21:15,938
Joe.

1382
01:21:39,504 --> 01:21:40,505
Thanks, Barry.

1383
01:21:40,588 --> 01:21:41,923
I don't feel good about this.

1384
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:59,065
Death isn't as ex citing
as I thought it would be.

1385
01:22:12,328 --> 01:22:13,788
Excuse me, please.

1386
01:22:13,871 --> 01:22:15,873
Excuse me.

1387
01:22:15,915 --> 01:22:17,542
Excuse me,
I'm Victor Wallace.

1388
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:19,210
Sir, you can't come through here.

1389
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:21,295
I'm the husband,
you fucking moron.

1390
01:22:21,379 --> 01:22:23,047
Sir, just one question!

1391
01:22:24,257 --> 01:22:25,842
Don't talk to me.

1392
01:22:25,925 --> 01:22:27,552
Has this played into McCloud's position

1393
01:22:27,593 --> 01:22:29,178
on gun safety legislation?

1394
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:41,107
This has absolutely nothing to do
with McCloud Industries.

1395
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,484
These are the actions of an insane man.

1396
01:22:44,777 --> 01:22:46,738
And my wife is a wonderful woman.

1397
01:22:48,614 --> 01:22:49,991
She's a wonderful woman.

1398
01:22:56,039 --> 01:22:58,458
- Victor, you can't go out there.
- I just want to let her see me.

1399
01:22:58,499 --> 01:22:59,584
Why?

1400
01:23:01,294 --> 01:23:03,504
'Cause I think I know who this guy is.

1401
01:23:03,588 --> 01:23:05,340
And I think I can get her out of this.

1402
01:23:05,423 --> 01:23:07,300
Whatever you're thinking,

1403
01:23:07,383 --> 01:23:09,927
- I can't let...
- This is my problem.

1404
01:23:09,969 --> 01:23:11,763
Don't make me make problems for you.

1405
01:23:14,474 --> 01:23:16,059
Be good to the car.

1406
01:23:19,395 --> 01:23:20,938
I said the car.

1407
01:23:24,525 --> 01:23:26,069
Liberty!

1408
01:23:26,152 --> 01:23:27,320
Victor.

1409
01:23:36,996 --> 01:23:37,997
Hey, Alex.

1410
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:43,628
Well, here we are again,

1411
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:45,797
in the kill zone.
What can I do for you?

1412
01:23:45,838 --> 01:23:48,216
I remember the day you wept like a baby

1413
01:23:49,467 --> 01:23:51,636
while I promised not to let you die.

1414
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:56,057
Okay, okay,
you saved my life, yeah.

1415
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,267
Wasn't I thankful enough then?

1416
01:23:58,351 --> 01:23:59,811
Well, thanks again.

1417
01:23:59,852 --> 01:24:01,353
I mean it.

1418
01:24:01,354 --> 01:24:03,231
- Victor.
- But I have a feeling that.

1419
01:24:03,314 --> 01:24:05,066
what's really expected of me

1420
01:24:05,149 --> 01:24:08,236
is some sort of big,
public confession.

1421
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:10,279
Am I right?
What am I supposed to say?

1422
01:24:13,533 --> 01:24:14,659
Joe, don't do it.

1423
01:24:14,701 --> 01:24:15,952
That.

1424
01:24:16,035 --> 01:24:18,621
that really shiny one
that I have is actually for.

1425
01:24:18,705 --> 01:24:20,540
for leading a bunch of men to their death?

1426
01:24:20,623 --> 01:24:22,500
Is that what I'm supposed to say?

1427
01:24:22,542 --> 01:24:24,043
Come on.

1428
01:24:24,127 --> 01:24:25,670
Alex, it's a war.

1429
01:24:27,422 --> 01:24:29,007
That's the kind of stuff that happens.

1430
01:24:30,258 --> 01:24:32,343
You think I'm proud of it?
I didn't ask for the medal.

1431
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:39,809
Your death is gonna mean something.

1432
01:24:41,102 --> 01:24:42,145
But my daughter's...

1433
01:24:42,228 --> 01:24:43,229
won't.

1434
01:24:45,565 --> 01:24:46,566
Joe, don't do it.

1435
01:24:48,026 --> 01:24:49,152
Don't do it!

1436
01:24:50,236 --> 01:24:51,821
- Don't!
- Christ, he's been hit.

1437
01:24:51,904 --> 01:24:52,989
Get him out of here!

1438
01:25:09,422 --> 01:25:10,757
Get him inside fast!

1439
01:25:11,841 --> 01:25:13,217
Come on, pick him up!
Move!

1440
01:25:13,259 --> 01:25:15,219
Let's go! Let's go!

1441
01:25:23,394 --> 01:25:24,520
Don't!

1442
01:25:32,945 --> 01:25:34,030
Liberty.

1443
01:25:34,113 --> 01:25:35,073
Liberty!

1444
01:25:35,156 --> 01:25:36,658
- It's time.
- What?

1445
01:25:36,741 --> 01:25:38,451
Time for you to go.

1446
01:25:38,534 --> 01:25:39,994
The keys for your cuffs

1447
01:25:40,078 --> 01:25:42,872
is in a box taped to the underside
of the cart near the corner.

1448
01:25:42,955 --> 01:25:45,750
Okay, guys, it's got to be this one
right here, 7th and Alvarado.

1449
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:47,168
Move on it!
7th and Alvarado!

1450
01:25:56,302 --> 01:25:57,261
Aah!

1451
01:25:57,303 --> 01:25:58,888
Bring the chopper into the back,

1452
01:25:58,972 --> 01:26:01,015
or this guy will blow it out of the sky.

1453
01:26:02,225 --> 01:26:04,310
Must be some kind of shooter
if he's holed up that far.

1454
01:26:11,401 --> 01:26:13,444
In the theater,
officer needs backup.

1455
01:26:13,528 --> 01:26:15,113
There's people panicking.
Smoke everywhere.

1456
01:26:15,196 --> 01:26:16,614
A fire's been set or something.

1457
01:26:30,086 --> 01:26:31,004
Hey!

1458
01:26:31,045 --> 01:26:33,214
Stop! Get away!

1459
01:26:33,297 --> 01:26:34,382
There's a bomb!

1460
01:26:34,465 --> 01:26:36,300
Guys, all eyes out for the Wallace woman.

1461
01:26:36,342 --> 01:26:38,553
Run! Run!
There's a bomb!

1462
01:26:45,018 --> 01:26:45,977
Run!

1463
01:26:46,019 --> 01:26:47,729
There's a bomb!

1464
01:26:48,896 --> 01:26:49,856
Liberty,

1465
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:51,190
it's up to you now.

1466
01:26:51,274 --> 01:26:52,525
Time to choose.

1467
01:27:08,374 --> 01:27:09,500
Everybody, move!

1468
01:27:25,058 --> 01:27:27,393
Video attachment is streaming.

1469
01:27:27,435 --> 01:27:31,564
Senator Libby took at least
three payments in cash.

1470
01:27:31,648 --> 01:27:34,942
Senator Lipton, Crick,
Congressman Gomez,

1471
01:27:35,026 --> 01:27:37,695
check Geneva bank accounts.

1472
01:27:37,737 --> 01:27:40,448
You'll all be able to return to your cars,

1473
01:27:40,531 --> 01:27:42,033
once we secure the area.

1474
01:27:42,075 --> 01:27:43,660
Where's Russell?

1475
01:27:43,743 --> 01:27:45,662
- Where's Russell?
- I haven't seen him.

1476
01:27:49,957 --> 01:27:51,793
Russell!

1477
01:27:55,338 --> 01:27:56,255
Russell!

1478
01:27:57,632 --> 01:27:58,966
Get out of here!

1479
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:00,051
Don't!

1480
01:28:01,928 --> 01:28:05,139
Get out of here!
There's a bomb!

1481
01:28:05,223 --> 01:28:07,016
Get out! Run!

1482
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:08,351
Get out of here!

1483
01:28:31,624 --> 01:28:34,252
The file with the video
attachment has been sent.

1484
01:28:42,969 --> 01:28:45,054
As you can see,
the area has been contained.

1485
01:28:45,138 --> 01:28:46,931
The situation is under control.

1486
01:28:46,973 --> 01:28:49,559
Now, if you'll ex cuse me.

1487
01:29:04,657 --> 01:29:06,784
All right,
everybody into the alley, now!

1488
01:29:06,826 --> 01:29:08,494
All right, get the fire hose.

1489
01:29:10,163 --> 01:29:11,664
Find that motherfucker!

1490
01:29:25,803 --> 01:29:26,846
No, sir.

1491
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:29,098
No other civilian casualties
from the explosion.

1492
01:29:30,183 --> 01:29:32,143
We've had a fire reported
in the back of the theater, sir.

1493
01:29:32,226 --> 01:29:34,937
No damage. No casualties.
All noise and smoke.

1494
01:29:35,021 --> 01:29:36,230
He made me shoot it.

1495
01:29:38,316 --> 01:29:39,359
Close range.

1496
01:29:53,873 --> 01:29:55,708
- Who are you?
- I was looking for my wife's purse.

1497
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:57,335
It's not safe in here.
Get out of here.

1498
01:30:01,214 --> 01:30:03,216
My great-great-grandfather,

1499
01:30:03,299 --> 01:30:07,178
he designed the gun that changed
the outcome of the Civil War.

1500
01:30:27,699 --> 01:30:30,410
Where exactly were you when
the first explosion took place?

1501
01:30:30,493 --> 01:30:32,745
Umm. that's funny that you would ask.

1502
01:30:32,787 --> 01:30:34,956
Excuse me.
Mr. Perry! Mr. Perry!

1503
01:30:41,546 --> 01:30:44,215
I grew up thinking
that's what we were still doing.

1504
01:30:45,341 --> 01:30:46,342
On the other side!

1505
01:30:54,726 --> 01:30:56,936
I'm really sorry about your daughter.

1506
01:31:02,483 --> 01:31:03,776
My father.

1507
01:31:12,952 --> 01:31:15,121
he was my hero.

1508
01:31:25,214 --> 01:31:26,758
He was.

1509
01:31:55,662 --> 01:31:57,789
Let me do what I can really do.

1510
01:31:58,998 --> 01:32:01,042
Let me work from the inside.
I can.

1511
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:02,710
I can do something.

1512
01:32:16,349 --> 01:32:18,851
Joe,
I can really change things.

1513
01:32:18,935 --> 01:32:20,436
I promise you I'll do it.

1514
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,771
I promise.
