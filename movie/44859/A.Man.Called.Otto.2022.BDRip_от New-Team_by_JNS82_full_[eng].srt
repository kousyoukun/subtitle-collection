1
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,590
Welcome to the store.

2
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,425
Are you a busy beaver?

3
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,511
No, I am not a busy beaver.

4
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,811
Are you a frequent beaver?

5
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,730
Join our rewards club for savings.

6
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,649
You can get your teeth
into our dam good deals.

7
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,407
Don't forget:

8
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,118
If you need help, ask a beaver.

9
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,746
Oh. Oh.

10
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,124
Hey. Oh.
Can I, uh, help you with that, sir?

11
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,418
Do you think
I don't know how to cut rope?

12
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,630
No, it's just we usually do that for ya.

13
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:13,842
Do you think I'm gonna out myself
and bleed all over your floor and sue you?

14
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,555
Then I don't need your help.

15
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,642
Have an excellent day.

16
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,936
I'm a busy beaver.

17
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,688
Idiot.

18
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,027
Did you, um, find everything
you were lookin' for today?

19
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,115
Let's see here.

20
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,289
Uh, your total is 3.47.

21
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,792
You charged me for 6 feet of rope.

22
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,461
Oh, yes, it's 99¢ a yard.

23
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,339
I didn't get 2 yards. I got 5 feet.

24
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,468
Yeah, we don't charge by the foot.
We charge by the yard.

25
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,389
99¢ a yard is 33¢ a foot,
times 5, that's 1.65.

26
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,474
You charged me $1.98.

27
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,851
You're good at math. Um...

28
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,855
No, I know, but I can't put it into
the computer the way that you just said.

29
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,067
What the hell kind of computer
can't do simple math?

30
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,237
- Can I speak to your manager?
- He's at lunch.

31
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,116
Lunch. All anyone cares about
these days is lunch.

32
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,839
- Is there anyone else in charge?
- You want the assistant manager?

33
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,912
- Yes, I'd like the assistant manager.
- 'Kay.

34
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,916
Hey, Taylor?

35
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,836
Taylor? To the front register.

36
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,003
What's up?

37
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,088
Hey, Taylor.

38
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,633
This is the assistant manager?
How old is she?

39
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,343
Shouldn't you be in gym class?

40
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,469
Sorry, what?

41
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,804
Here. I got some change.

42
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,515
Let me cover that extra 33¢ for you.

43
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,477
Sir, I do not want your 33¢.
And this is not about 33¢.

44
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,398
This is about the fact that I got 5 feet
of rope because I want 5 feet of rope.

45
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,110
And I shouldn't have to pay
for 6 feet of rope if I don't want 6 feet.

46
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,446
Did you want another foot of rope?

47
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,642
Not again.

48
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,789
How hard can this be?

49
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,359
That bike goes over here.

50
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,986
Hey! What the hell?

51
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,946
That's mine.

52
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,782
- It belongs in the bike rack.
- I was only gone half a minute.

53
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,245
Next time, I'll lock it up
in the lost and found.

54
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,290
Grumpy old bastard.

55
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,041
Jeez.

56
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,390
Not on the mirror.

57
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,728
Hey, Otto!

58
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,277
Okay.

59
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,249
Don't you dare let that little rat dog
piss on my walkway again.

60
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,936
- I know it was you.
- Ignore him, prince.

61
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,712
He's a nasty, bitter old man.
And he has no idea who's doing that.

62
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,798
Well, it was one of you.

63
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:49,719
And tell that useless boyfriend of yours
to stop stretching his groin in public.

64
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,433
Looks like a 14-year-old Romanian gymnast,
for god's sakes.

65
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,991
Go on. Get outta here.

66
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,949
There he is, the big man himself.

67
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,204
What's all this?

68
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,790
It's, well, retirement cake, I guess.
Call it what you like.

69
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,625
"Have fun."

70
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,669
"Have fun."

71
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,962
Doing what?

72
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,382
Have fun with the rest of your life.
We wanted to, you know...

73
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,259
Celebrate?

74
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,719
Yes! Well, no.

75
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,304
Give you a nice send-off.

76
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,806
"Nice."

77
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,974
Come on, Otto.

78
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,018
You're the one who decided to leave.

79
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,353
And you did get a nice severance package.

80
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,356
You took me off operations.

81
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,233
You cut back on my hours.

82
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,737
You made Terry,
who I trained, my supervisor.

83
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,282
Terry, who can barely figure out
what year it is without his phone.

84
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,619
So, yes, I took the severance package.

85
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,204
I'm sorry you see it that way.

86
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,956
We all had to adjust after the merger.

87
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,877
But you've been quite an asset
to this company over the years, so...

88
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,129
You have. Reliable as hell.

89
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,006
We're gonna miss
those schedules of yours.

90
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,801
To Otto!

91
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,470
- To Otto!
- To Otto.

92
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,893
Okay, Otto. Want a piece of your face?

93
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,777
Who's hungry?

94
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,448
Look at this.

95
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,574
No, no.

96
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,660
Hey, hey, wait!

97
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,288
No, no, no. Hey, you cannot use
this road without a permit.

98
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,999
I'm not parking.
I just dropped off a package.

99
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,877
The sign doesn't say
anything about packages, does it?

100
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,838
It says "permits" and you don't have one.

101
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,881
This is not a through street.

102
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,801
Have a nice day, sir.

103
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,261
Every time you come in here

104
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,347
that means one of the residents
can't park in front of their homes!

105
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,434
The other guys don't do this.
The guys with the white trucks.

106
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,562
How come it's always you brown guys?

107
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,605
And I don't mean that racially!

108
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,159
Oh, hi. Sorry, can you hear me?

109
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,202
It's Susan.

110
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,287
Susan who?

111
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,664
I have great news
about your health insurance.

112
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,083
Oh, no, no, no. Robot, robot, robot!

113
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:14,632
Well, who do I have to talk to
to get this phone number disconnected?

114
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,996
That's account services.

115
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,469
Can you transfer me
or should I press a number?

116
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,642
Well, I have been listening
to that music for seven minutes.

117
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,126
I do apologize, Mr. Anderson.

118
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,396
I would like the electricity shut off
at this residence.

119
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,274
- Are you moving home?
- No, I am canceling the account.

120
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,861
A-n-d-e—r-s-o—n.

121
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,363
And why can't you refund me
for the six days?

122
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,240
O-t-t-o.

123
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,325
Oh, it's policy.

124
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,786
Well, my policy is that
if I'm going to pay for six days of gas,

125
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,247
then I will use six days of gas.

126
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,999
Then we are done here.

127
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,836
Idiots.

128
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,788
Okay.

129
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,791
Go, go, go. Stop. Go.

130
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,960
Okay. Yeah. Stop.

131
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,173
Back. You're in the blind spot,
be careful. Use the force.

132
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,426
Good, good.
No, you're going on the sidewalk.

133
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,219
Okay.

134
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,596
Back, back, back.

135
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,681
Go away.

136
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,893
Stop-stop.

137
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,525
Ah, shit.

138
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,445
What the hell is he doing?

139
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,281
Yes! Exactly!
That's exactly what I was saying.

140
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,909
Hey, you can't just drive here.

141
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,911
I'm not driving.
Am I driving the car? No.

142
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,307
You can't just bring a car
on this street without a permit.

143
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,542
No, we have a parking permit.
Right here. See?

144
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,669
What the hell's it doing in your pocket?!

145
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,463
Well, I'm the driver.

146
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,841
We're renting here. Yeah.

147
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,009
In 206.

148
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,183
That doesn't mean you can back
the trailer up to your front door.

149
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,853
No, I wasn't. I was, uh, parallel parking.

150
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,021
Parallel to what?

151
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,360
Yeah, that, uh, didn't go so well, huh?

152
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,153
I'll just give it another try.

153
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,863
Oh, my god.

154
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:26,991
Okay.

155
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,117
Mm...

156
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,663
Good. Good!

157
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,041
Keep backing away. Keep backing away.

158
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,501
Now go away more.

159
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,794
Okay, I got this.

160
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,381
The other way, but first the other way.

161
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,673
- Easy.
- Exactamente.

162
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,717
- Easy, easy.
- Uh-huh. Good.

163
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,719
No. No, no. What? No!

164
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,515
No, no, no! Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

165
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,101
Stop! Stop. Get outta the car.

166
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,560
- Get outta the car.
- I'm sorry.

167
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,324
How you could make it
this far through life

168
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,398
without knowing how to back up a trailer.

169
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,402
My god, a dog with one front paw and
cataracts coulda done better than that.

170
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,821
And an automatic, of course.
Give me the keys.

171
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,532
Oh, they're in the cupholder.

172
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,242
It's a push-button start.

173
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,493
No, I knew that.

174
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,331
What the hell is that?

175
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,624
Uh, that's the radar.

176
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,960
The trailer's too close
to the side of the car.

177
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,837
That's why it's still beeping, but...

178
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,963
Okay.

179
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,596
What's your name?

180
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,890
- Otto.
- Otto?

181
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,769
Otto. O-t-t-o.

182
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,106
I'm Abbie, o-t-t-o.

183
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,817
And I'm Luna.

184
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,445
Nice to meet you.

185
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,006
Oh, that was good, huh?

186
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,966
He just did it in one shot, huh?

187
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,471
- Perfecto!
- Thank you, sir.

188
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,724
Anyone who thinks
they need to use radar to back up a car

189
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,309
shouldn't be allowed to drive one.

190
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,227
They shouldn't be allowed
to use the radio.

191
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,770
That's what I said.

192
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,857
And the permit goes on
the rearview mirror. Not in your pocket!

193
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,442
- Okay, okay.
- Got it.

194
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,862
- Bye! Thank you!
- Thank you, sir. That was very nice.

195
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,326
Idiot.

196
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,045
You guys all ready?

197
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,347
Okay.

198
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,227
All right.

199
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,187
Bring your stuff, okay?

200
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,105
Come on, sweeties.

201
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,696
Chiquitita, take your stuff.

202
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,651
How much more shelf space is left?

203
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,153
Three shelves.

204
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,757
- How many more boxes of books do you have?
- Seven or eight.

205
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,700
"Then I'll build you another bookcase."

206
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,119
Then I'll build you another bookcase.

207
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,696
- Hi.
- Hey.

208
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,722
Hi. Otto.

209
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,307
Right? Yes?

210
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,558
Otto.

211
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,519
Yeah, that's what I said.
No? What did I say...?

212
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,397
It doesn't matter what you said.
Otto. O-t-t-o.

213
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,733
- Ah! Otto.
- Otto.

214
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,278
Otto. Okay, so it's the same fonnard
that is backwards.

215
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,654
- Otto.
- It's Otto, mari.

216
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,990
It's just you don't hear
that name very often.

217
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,073
I do.

218
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,202
Okay. If we're interrupting,
we can always come back.

219
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,495
What is it you want?

220
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,665
I brought you some food.

221
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:45,750
Why?

222
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,711
Because you looked hungry.

223
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,588
That's why we go so well together.

224
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,842
She loves to cook,
and I like to eat everything.

225
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,721
Anyway, we just, uh...

226
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,515
We wanted
to properly introduce ourselves

227
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,060
because we're gonna be neighbors
and everything, so...

228
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,814
-Okay.

229
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,940
- Okay.
- Bye.

230
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,243
My name is Marisol.

231
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,996
And I'm Tommy.

232
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,917
Otto.

233
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,421
Are you always this unfriendly?

234
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,340
I'm not unfriendly.

235
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,277
- I'd say you're a little unfriendly.
- I'm not unfriendly.

236
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,678
- UN poquito.
- I am not.

237
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,221
No? Okay, you're not.

238
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,890
No, no, no, no. You're not unfriendly.

239
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,102
Every word you say is like a warm cuddle.

240
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,687
It really is.

241
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,023
Enjoy it.

242
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:52,942
What is it?

243
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,944
Be careful with the salsa, please.

244
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,904
It's, um, pol/o con mole.

245
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,114
It's really good.

246
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,658
It's a Mexican dish.

247
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,618
I'm Mexican.

248
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,081
I was born in El Salvador
because my father is from there.

249
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,543
But my mom is Mexican,
so we went to first Mexico and then...

250
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,796
- And you?
- I'm an it consultant.

251
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,676
Oh, I'm from anaheim.

252
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,969
Oh, from anaheim.

253
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,095
Anaheim, yeah.

254
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,638
Yeah. El Paso.

255
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,100
Okay, well, I have some things
I need to do.

256
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,102
Excuse me, Mr. Otto.

257
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,147
You wouldn't have an Alvin wrench
I could borrow, would you?

258
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,732
You mean an Allen wrench.

259
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,692
No, an Alvin wrench.

260
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,545
- It's Allen wrench.
- Allen wrench.

261
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,654
It's "Allen" wrench, right?
It's Allen wrench.

262
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,739
It's Alvin.

263
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,699
All morning, "Alvin wrench, Alvin wrench."

264
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,902
Honey, it's Alvin, trust me.

265
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,790
Everybody else I know
calls it an Alvin wrench.

266
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,621
- Everybody else you know is wrong.
- Oh, yeah? You wanna Google it?

267
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,706
My god.

268
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,332
Google it! Google it!

269
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,626
Google it. Wikipediale. Wikipediale.

270
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,794
Give me your phone.

271
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,796
No, my phone. You use your phone.

272
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,139
Do you know what size you need?

273
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,016
Ah, just the usual size.

274
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,603
Take the set.

275
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,104
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

276
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,315
We go because you have things to do, so...

277
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,075
What do you want, huh?

278
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,176
Mmm.

279
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,154
Mmm.

280
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,119
Isn't she beautiful, son?

281
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,329
That's a Chevy engine for you.

282
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,123
Dependable.

283
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,208
Not enough you can depend on
in this world.

284
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,543
Dad, this is Otto.

285
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,631
That's enough now, darling.

286
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:22,985
Huh.

287
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,737
Two for $8?

288
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,962
Maybe I should just run myself
over with a car. That'll work.

289
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,090
Found some of the flowers you like.

290
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,675
Pink.

291
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,178
There was a deal on 'em.

292
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,015
On sale. Two for 8 bucks.

293
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,728
I'm sorry I didn't get 'em here earlier.

294
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,356
Got distracted.

295
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,525
By some new neighbors.

296
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,279
Nitwit husband.

297
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,700
Didn't even know an Allen wrench
from one of the chipmunks.

298
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,329
Renters, of course.

299
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,625
No commitment to anything.

300
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:26,006
I know, I know.
Maybe they can't afford to buy yet.

301
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,926
But what will they do
when those real estate bastards

302
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,345
decide to tear down their house

303
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,223
and put up more
of those ricky—ticky condos, huh?

304
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,433
It's gonna happen. I promise you.

305
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,770
They're already driving around the gates,

306
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,772
driving right across the grass.

307
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,735
Dye & merika.

308
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,781
What idiot thought that was a good name
for a real estate company?

309
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,242
Sounds like "dying america."

310
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,455
It is, of course.

311
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,333
Can't even buy
a decent screw hook anymore.

312
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,211
Or rope by the foot.

313
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,757
Nothing works when you're not home.

314
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,618
Next.

315
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:26,168
I suspect you have
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,

316
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,212
which is a genetic enlargement of the...

317
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,296
I know.

318
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,215
My father had it.

319
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,595
Well, you'll likely be around
a good long time,

320
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,473
but I'm afraid
your military prospects end here.

321
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,193
One return ticket to Pittsburgh, please.

322
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,736
That'll be 1.10.

323
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,030
Thank you.

324
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,872
Coming through.

325
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,188
Hey, you dropped your book!

326
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,732
Miss, you dropped your book! Hey!

327
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,072
Is that mine?

328
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,074
What?

329
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:26,413
Yes. I saw you dropped it, so I...

330
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,832
Thank you so much.

331
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,835
I'm halfway through reading it.
I would hate not knowing how it ends.

332
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,132
Oh, here. Why don't you join me?

333
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,347
I'm Sonya.

334
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,766
I'm Otto.

335
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,059
It was my father's name.

336
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,687
I'm on my way
to visit my father right now.

337
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,022
I go every Thursday.

338
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,698
Do you take this train a lot?

339
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,535
Oh, no, I had to come into town
for my army physical.

340
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,162
Oh, god.

341
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,124
Oh, that must be so hard, not knowing
what you're gonna face over there.

342
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,336
- When are you leaving?
- I'm not...

343
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,256
Not for a while.

344
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,801
Tickets, please.

345
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:26,932
Thank you.

346
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,934
All right, thank you.

347
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,940
I'm afraid you're on the wrong train.
This is an eastbound ticket.

348
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,568
I must have, um...

349
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,780
I'll get off at the next station.

350
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,073
Uh, how much is it?

351
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,242
Uh, $1.75.

352
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,847
Here. I have some change.

353
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,937
Thank you.

354
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,319
There you go. Thank you. Have a good day.

355
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,159
A quarter to spare.

356
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,162
It's 1964.

357
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,164
- It's pure silver.
- Oh?

358
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,291
Keep it, then. It's lucky.

359
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,339
Yes, it is.

360
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:31,223
Hey, Otto! A little late
for your morning rounds, isn't it?

361
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,017
No? Aren't you supposed to be at work?

362
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,439
Oh. Cool.
You wanna come over for lunch, then?

363
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,275
Lunch.

364
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,612
No, no.

365
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,573
Well, it's pork tenderloin,
in case you change your mind!

366
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,158
No, no, no, no.

367
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,369
Hey, excuse me.

368
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,123
It was you.

369
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,919
This is a private road, and these gates
are to keep down the flow of traffic.

370
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,548
Not so idiot drivers can go around them
and tear up the grass.

371
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,843
Okay. You got me. I'm with dye & merika.

372
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,596
I'm gonna have the groundskeeper
come down and fix that up for ya, okay?

373
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,724
Good as new. Even better.
You have a good one now, okay?

374
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,601
The rules are here for a reason.

375
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,150
I know what you guys are up to.

376
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,444
Okay, Mr. Anderson. Whatever you say.

377
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,821
Keep up the neighborhood watch.

378
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:34,077
Get out here, you little bugger!

379
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,538
Come on. Yeah.

380
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,622
Get out here!

381
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,749
You throw one more rock,

382
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,687
and I swear I'll dropkick that little
rat dog of yours right over the roof.

383
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,381
No, I'm not throwing it at your house.
That nasty cat scratched prince.

384
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,692
I'm gonna kill that piece of shit.

385
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:48,842
No, you're not.

386
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,677
What do you care? It's feral.

387
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,221
It's probably full of all sorts
of disgusting diseases.

388
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,682
So are you, most likely.
I don't throw rocks at you.

389
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,601
Andy.

390
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,520
- What's up?
- Did you hear what he just said this time?

391
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,498
I told you before about
how he talks to me.

392
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,524
Get outta here while you can.

393
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,817
I'm not your friend.

394
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,629
Dye & merika said they'll get all
the old people on this street into a home.

395
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,988
The sooner the better!

396
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,467
- Hello.
- What now?

397
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,653
I just wanted to bring the wrenches back.

398
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,639
- I found one that came with the furniture.
- Congratulations.

399
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,475
And I made you some salpores de arroz.

400
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,393
Is that chicken and mole?

401
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:44,940
No. These are Salvadoran cookies.
They were my father's favorite, so...

402
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,816
They're delicious.
You're gonna love 'em.

403
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,276
Yes, because I made them.

404
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,530
Also, Otto, I was wondering
if you have a ladder I can borrow.

405
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,948
Our window is jammed.

406
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,574
Why do you need a ladder?

407
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,826
Well, it's the one up there.

408
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,371
It won't open.

409
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,957
And you're gonna try to open it
from the outside?

410
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,291
Yeah. Right.

411
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,044
I'll get my coat.

412
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,546
Okay. Thank you.

413
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,341
I like how his hands are waving.

414
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,134
Let's put the arm in.

415
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,555
- Good.
- Anita.

416
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:21,184
Uh, Otto, hate to bother you,
but, um, we don't have any heat.

417
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,728
Could you come take a look?

418
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,230
Try bleeding your radiators.

419
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,650
How would I go about that?

420
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,027
By bleeding the radiators.

421
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,029
Otto. Don't be rude.

422
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,739
I wasn't being rude.

423
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:39,327
Well, it's hard to tell the difference
sometimes with Otto.

424
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,666
By the way, we, uh, just moved to 206.

425
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,960
- I'm Marisol.
- I'm Tommy.

426
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,129
- Welcome, honey.
- Nice meeting you.

427
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,297
I'm Anita.

428
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,341
My husband, Reuben,
is the one who used to handle the heat.

429
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,677
- Okay.
- But we always knew a day would come

430
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,556
when he wouldn't be able to handle things
around the house any longer.

431
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,311
Maybe Reuben should have thought of that
when he organized his coup.

432
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,394
Oh...

433
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,023
That was a long time ago.

434
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,274
A coup?

435
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,359
It was a misunderstanding.

436
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,527
It was a coup.

437
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:19,659
Otto, can't you just go
breathe Anita's radiators for her?

438
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,537
No. Because you don't breathe radiators.

439
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,663
You bleed them.

440
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,808
- Honey, look at this ramp.
- That's Sonya's.

441
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,113
- This is what we needed for the trailer.
- Put that down.

442
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,837
Put that down!
Who said you could touch that?!

443
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,173
- Sorry.
- All of you get outta here. Go, go.

444
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,092
Take your ladder and go.
Get outta here. All of you.

445
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,656
- Okay.
- Thank you.

446
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:39,929
Watch out.

447
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,682
Right. Right.

448
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,916
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

449
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,154
No. What are you doing in here?

450
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,114
How did you get in here? Come on.

451
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,617
Come on. Go! Get outta there.

452
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,746
No, get out. Get out of there.

453
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,830
Come on, go.

454
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:09,792
Hey.

455
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,506
Letgo!

456
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,383
Let go.

457
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,555
You scratch me, I'll bite you.

458
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,936
That'll teach you.

459
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,607
Stupid cat.

460
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,698
- Hi, Otto!
- Hi, Otto!

461
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,449
O-t-t-o.

462
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,219
Otto. Um...

463
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,902
I loaned you my garden hose last August.

464
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,057
If you give it back to me,
I'll bleed your radiators for you.

465
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:08,852
Come in.

466
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:20,989
So those new neighbors of yours,
they seem quite lovely, don't you think?

467
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:22,866
Lovely.

468
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:27,620
Yeah, well, you may have
some more new neighbors soon enough.

469
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,124
The realty people,
they've been telling us...

470
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,461
Reuben and I have to move out.

471
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,504
No, that's a load of crap.

472
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,299
They don't own this house. You do.

473
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,050
Yeah, well, that's what I said.

474
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,596
They, uh, have been
talking to our boy, Chris.

475
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,513
Oh.

476
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,808
Now he's saying that I can
no longer take care of Reuben,

477
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:52,020
that he needs to be
in a special care place.

478
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,857
And I should move into a retirement home.

479
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,985
What does Chris know about it?
He's an idiot. He always has been.

480
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,987
They can't make you do anything.

481
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,075
Does he even know we're here?

482
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,077
Of course he does.

483
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,954
Don't let him fool you.

484
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,081
He's still in there.

485
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,004
Let me go find your hose.

486
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,400
The whole neighborhood
is falling apart these days.

487
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,655
They don't even have
a homeowners' association anymore.

488
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,159
No one left to keep things running.

489
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,371
Not like we did.

490
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,879
Now, just to be clear...

491
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,674
I still haven't forgiven you.

492
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,428
I just didn't realize
you would fall to shit so quickly.

493
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,722
Now...

494
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,519
They're tearing apart
everything we worked so hard to build.

495
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,898
I haven't even left yet,
and they're trying to erase us.

496
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:25,363
Well, I am not staying around
to see that happen.

497
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,532
I'm leaving.

498
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,286
- Forgood.
- You ready for lunch?

499
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,169
I'm making that creamed corn you like.

500
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,205
Oh, thank you.

501
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,959
Thank you, Otto.
I'm sorry it took so long to give it back.

502
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,419
Um, you wanna stay for lunch?

503
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,296
Yeah, Anita made a pork tenderloin.

504
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,548
No, I have a lot of things I have to do.

505
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,177
Reuben, what are you doing, hon?

506
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,616
- Let go.
- What are you doing?

507
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,351
- Let go.
- Reuben. Reuben.

508
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,437
- Let...
- What are you doing?

509
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Go.

510
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,159
Oh, man.

511
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,766
Try opening it from the inside a little.

512
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,561
It's higher than I thought.

513
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,230
I'm a little bit dizzy, honey.

514
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,604
Mmm.

515
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,067
Mmm. Mmm.

516
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,345
J“ sun through the shadows j“

517
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,807
j“ light through the door j“

518
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,020
j“ your voice like an echo j“

519
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,315
j“ that I can't hear anymore j“

520
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,486
j“ so I follow your steps j“

521
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,739
j“ while the love that you left j“

522
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,657
j“ is burned in my heart j“

523
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,037
j“ with dreams in my mind j“

524
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,122
j“ of the next time that I j“

525
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,292
j“ have you in my arms j“

526
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,463
j“ 'cause I will tell you j“

527
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,798
j“ the whole truth j“

528
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:36,179
J“ that there's no color j“

529
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,639
j“ in the world without you j“

530
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,690
Looks like we'll both have
to take the next one.

531
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,110
Otto.

532
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,112
It was your father's name.

533
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,280
You remembered.

534
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,911
Did you have to go back
to the military center?

535
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,789
No, I wanted to pay you back
for the train ticket.

536
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,418
Wouldn't it be nicer
if you invited me to dinner?

537
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,756
J“ the best gift of this life j“

538
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,010
j“ is to see you up close j“

539
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,679
j“ and now and again... j“

540
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:19,931
Shall we?

541
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,224
Yeah, let's go in.

542
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,059
You're...

543
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,685
Fifteen minutes late.

544
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:25,769
Am I?

545
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,772
J“ so I write it all down j“

546
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,149
j“ all these moments I've found j“

547
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,652
j“ til I see you, my love j“

548
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,909
So, what kinds of things interest you?

549
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,495
Interest me like...?

550
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,955
What are you passionate about?

551
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,999
Machines. Engines.

552
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,501
I like knowing how things work.

553
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,836
I like knowing how things work.

554
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,672
What each part does
to make a car run smoothly.

555
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,590
It's more complicated than people realize.

556
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,677
A carburetor has to mix gas and air
in just the right combination,

557
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,929
and then the spark plug
has to ignite that mixture,

558
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,389
which drives the piston

559
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,908
and the connecting rods
and the drive shaft...

560
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,518
Where did you learn so much about cars?

561
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,019
From my father.

562
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:10,356
It's all we really talked about.
He was a good dad.

563
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,733
Dependable.

564
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,570
He passed away.

565
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:17,780
Two months ago.

566
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,367
It was sudden.

567
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:22,952
I'm sorry.

568
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:26,913
And your mom?

569
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,292
Don't remember her much.

570
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,461
Just how it felt when she was gone.

571
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:42,430
Why didn't you get an entree?

572
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,895
I ate at home.

573
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,980
Why?

574
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,418
So you could order whatever you wanted.

575
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,993
Look, I lied to you.

576
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,912
I'm sorry.

577
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,790
I'm not in the army.
I couldn't pass my physical.

578
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:13,294
If I had, at least I'd have a job now,
which is what I was counting on.

579
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,129
But I don't.

580
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,926
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

581
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:22,887
I should go.

582
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,281
Otto!

583
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,456
Otto!

584
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,502
I'm coming.

585
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,087
I'm coming!

586
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,839
What? What do you want?

587
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,050
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

588
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,052
- I'm looking for you.
- Well, you found me.

589
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,680
Can you please take me
to the hospital? Please?

590
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,432
Tommy fell off the ladder,
and the ambulance just took him away.

591
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:12,478
Well, you can drive yourself
in that imported toaster you call a car.

592
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,230
I don't have a license.

593
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,941
- How old are you?
- Huh? Thirty.

594
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,943
And you don't have a driver's license?

595
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,153
I have a driving's permit.

596
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,572
I just never got to the other parts.

597
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,574
How many other parts are there?

598
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:29,745
Please!

599
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,583
Focus! Please, listen!

600
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:40,089
Tommy is in the hospital,
and he may be dying as we speak.

601
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:43,676
So are you gonna drive me to the hospital,
or are you gonna make me take a bus?

602
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,803
- I will drive you to the hospital.
- Thank you.

603
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,805
Was it so hard?

604
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,516
Where are you going?

605
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,311
I'm going to get the children!

606
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,147
The children?

607
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,154
Pick me up, pick me up!

608
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,334
Bam everywhere. No! No!

609
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,506
Smack, smack, smack!

610
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,591
These dolls.

611
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,219
Are they some kind of superheroes?

612
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,305
Um, luchador are wrestlers. Yeah.

613
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,432
Wrestlers.

614
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,809
- I found a Mr. Bear book!
- So I see.

615
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,438
She wants you to read to her.

616
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:39,732
Exactly.

617
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,028
"Are you there, baby bear?

618
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,159
'Are you there, baby bear?'
Mr. Bear says.

619
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,745
'Where, oh where, is my baby bear.'"

620
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,747
no, talk like a bear.

621
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,417
Bears don't talk.

622
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,877
Um, this one does.

623
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,427
"'Where, oh where, is my baby bear?'

624
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:14,350
'Are you there, baby bear,
up in that tree?"'

625
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,352
No, it's an owl!

626
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:24,276
"'There's nobody here but baby and me.'

627
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,201
'are you there, baby bear,
deep underground?”

628
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,078
I'm no baby bear.

629
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,663
I'm beppo!

630
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,206
- Hi, beppo!
- Hi, beppo!

631
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,125
- Do you want to see a trick?
- Yes!

632
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,752
Actually, I was reading to them.

633
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:47,133
"Actually, I was reading to them,"
Mr. Bear grumbled.

634
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,260
Say, could I borrow a coin, Mr. Bear?

635
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,178
Yes, yes, yes, please?

636
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,180
Please, please, please?

637
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,058
Yes, yes, yes!

638
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,936
I need this back.

639
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,521
Absolutely.

640
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,833
He doesn't even own the costume.
That's owned by the hospital.

641
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,418
He's gonna have to pay for that.

642
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:26,380
Beppo means happiness.
He volunteers his time to be here.

643
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,216
Otto. What the hell did you do?

644
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,301
Nothing.

645
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,887
Abue/o Otto hit the clown.

646
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,847
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

647
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,640
Abue/o luchadoro!

648
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,059
Luchadoro!

649
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,895
It was all the clown's fault.

650
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:42,730
Ooh!

651
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,524
Where is it going?

652
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

653
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,280
Here you go.

654
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,289
Wow! Here it is!

655
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,374
- How'd you do that?
- Oh, it's magic.

656
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,126
Thank you.

657
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,253
I hope you have a magical day!

658
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,755
- Bye!
- Bye, beppo!

659
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,715
- Thank you.
- Hang on.

660
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,928
This isn't my quarter.

661
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:17,389
Well, it came from your ear, sir,
so that's a you problem.

662
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,059
No, this isn't my quarter.

663
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,603
"No, no, no. This is not your quarter."

664
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:27,775
Look. I gave you a quarter
that I said I needed back.

665
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,069
- You want a dollar?
- And you switched them on me.

666
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,880
- The ol' switcheroo.
- You gave me this quarter.

667
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:33,531
Is Otto going to get in trouble?

668
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,342
- It's just a quarter.
- No, it's not.

669
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,701
- Do you see the copper?
- He's not calling the coppers.

670
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,703
- I gave you a 1964 quarter.
- Please calm down.

671
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,205
I want it back! Where is it?

672
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,165
- You have it on you.
- Officer, help me.

673
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,125
129. We have a clown situation.

674
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,210
Where is it?

675
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,711
Let go of the clown! Sir! Sir!

676
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,797
A-ha! 1964.

677
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,181
Where's my toy?

678
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,724
It's in your backpack.

679
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,310
What pocket? There's a million pockets.

680
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,604
What?

681
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,817
My father used to smile like that.

682
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,695
I'm not smiling.

683
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,362
Exactly.

684
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,991
You should never be mean to a clown.

685
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,261
- What about Alvin wrench, is he coming?
- Look!

686
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:20,786
- Hey, guys!
- Mom, there he is!

687
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:24,114
Pull the car up please, so we pick him up.

688
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,165
Otto!

689
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,171
- Yay! Yay!
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

690
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,775
- Thanks for driving us.
- Bye, abue/o luchadoro.

691
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,599
- Thank you, Otto.
- Okay, good night.

692
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,354
- Bye!
- Thanks again, Otto.

693
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,221
Bye, then.

694
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,764
All right, ladies.

695
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:41,849
Let's go.

696
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:46,770
Look at your new leg!
They look like a robot leg.

697
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,085
Otto!

698
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,673
Oh, my god, is he dead?

699
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,800
No, he's probably sleeping.

700
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:20,179
Otto. No, no, no, please.
Please. Please. Take him out. Please.

701
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,139
No, why can't you?

702
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:26,268
Because I'm pregnant. I cannot handle
the cats because I can get the toxo thing.

703
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,730
Well, he got himself in there.
He can get himself out of there.

704
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,815
Ay.

705
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,299
Why are you like that?

706
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,693
I'm not good with cats.

707
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,403
Hey, man. What's going on?

708
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,739
Jimmy. Jimmy. We have a...

709
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,158
Oh, no!

710
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,910
We gotta warm you up, buddy!

711
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,495
Oh, yeah. Oh, be careful.

712
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,913
Oh, no.

713
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,414
Oh, I've got you.

714
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,083
He's so cold.

715
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,501
Where do we go?

716
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,337
- No. But no. Toxo. Otto.
- Oh.

717
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,131
Okay, let's go. I've got you now.

718
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:57,675
Otto. Open the door.

719
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,301
Oh, it's all right, buddy.

720
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,470
- It's gonna be okay, chiquitito.
- Poor guy.

721
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,307
Okay. You're okay.

722
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,476
- Snow all over my floor.
- Oh, sorry.

723
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,813
Oh, my god, it's so freezing here.

724
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,107
Okay, how about this one? Please?

725
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,693
No, no. Don't touch that coat.
It'll stay here.

726
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:19,071
- Okay. Can you please bring a blanket?
- For the cat?

727
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,990
- It's okay. I got this.
- What are you doing?

728
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:26,495
Oh, body heat works wonders.
I've got plenty of body and heat.

729
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,247
I'm gonna turn on the oven.

730
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,749
You are not putting that cat in my oven.

731
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,794
No, I'm just trying to get
some heat in the house.

732
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,052
Your counters are so low.
Where did you get them?

733
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,304
I built them.

734
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,306
For Sonya. For my wife.

735
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,101
Ah. Is she short too?

736
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,311
Sonya passed away.

737
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,524
She was a great cook though,
wasn't she?

738
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,318
I used to eat here all the time.

739
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,948
I'm sorry.

740
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,368
Well, can you go now?

741
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,078
I have things to do.

742
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,332
Well, it was great seeing ya, as usual.

743
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,627
Oh, hey, who's gonna look after this guy?

744
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:16,962
You are.

745
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,674
Okay.

746
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,517
Now ask me the right way.

747
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,484
It was so beautiful too.

748
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,528
Okay, now I'm hungry. Now I'm hungry.

749
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,077
Let's see.

750
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,417
"The board of regents hereby certifies
that Otto Anderson,

751
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:59,296
having completed all the requirements
for a bachelor's degree in engineering..."

752
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,839
Would you ever wanna...

753
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,091
Get married?

754
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,720
- 'Cause if you did...
- Look at me.

755
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,391
Now ask me the right way.

756
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,729
Will you...?

757
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,693
Will you marry me?

758
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,321
Yes!

759
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,740
Yes.

760
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes! Yes!

761
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,265
- Oh, my god!
- Someone call 911.

762
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,227
He fell down!

763
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,980
- Somebody help him!
- Get the camera on him. No, take video.

764
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,189
Oh, for god's sake.

765
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,984
- Who's gonna do something?
- Oh, my god, he fell.

766
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,070
- Get him off the tracks. Somebody help.
- Hey! Can you move?

767
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,824
You gotta move! Come on! You gotta get up!

768
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,785
Will somebody help me?

769
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,582
- Come on.
- Film it, film it, film it.

770
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,877
- Get the shot.
- I have him. I see him.

771
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,005
Zoom in on his face.

772
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,424
- Tell me what happened.
- We were going to the museum...

773
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,896
Look at me.

774
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:21,980
Say hello.

775
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,565
Take a breath, Otto.

776
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,819
Take my hand.

777
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:28,903
Take my hand.

778
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,657
Take my hand now!

779
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,336
Hey, are you out of your mind?
You could have been killed.

780
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,879
Sir, you saved his life.

781
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,363
He saved that guy's life.

782
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,716
You're amazing. Oh, my god.

783
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,051
That was amazing.

784
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,560
- Whatever. Follow us.
- Anyway, follow us.

785
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,162
Hey.

786
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,211
Are you trying to scare me to death?

787
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:27,963
Look at this.

788
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,051
Abbie wanted to make a picture
of her new neighbor.

789
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,553
She wants you to have that.

790
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,930
That's you.

791
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,932
She always draws you in color.

792
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,351
What do you mean, "always"?

793
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,604
I have a very good idea.

794
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,107
You can be my driver's instructor.

795
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,278
No, no, no.

796
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,447
I don't have time for that.

797
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:57,034
But don't worry,
I'll pay for the gas and everything.

798
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:01,747
Hey, there you guys are.
I've been looking for ya everywhere.

799
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,599
Hi, Jimmy. What are you doing?

800
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,042
- Cat in there?
- Yeah.

801
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,252
Oh, jeez! Calm down, dude.

802
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,421
He really doesn't like this.

803
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,173
Let him out of the box.

804
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,051
Okay. Sorry, buddy.

805
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:20,182
What do you think you were doing?
Taking him for a walk?

806
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,393
Well, I had to bring him back.
I forgot that I'm allergic.

807
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,354
- Oh, Jimmy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

808
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,524
I put oatmeal on it,
and it didn't help at all.

809
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:33,904
You know what, you come with me.
Tommy has a prescription from last year.

810
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,114
- He found a wasp's nest.
- Are you sure?

811
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,759
- I don't want to be a bother.
- It's okay.

812
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,844
- Don't scratch.
- I feel like I should scratch a little.

813
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,328
Hey, hey, what about the cat?

814
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,206
Uh, looks like he's yours now, Otto.

815
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:45,874
Love him.

816
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,766
Get in the box.

817
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,478
Get in the box.

818
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,734
Get in the box.

819
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,163
Sorry I haven't come yet.

820
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,253
It's been harder than I thought to...

821
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,177
And now he's moved in.

822
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,976
I have a cat.

823
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,356
I have to figure out what to do with him.

824
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,819
Then I'll come to you, Sonya. I promise.

825
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,364
I miss you.

826
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:07,330
J“ and I finally see j“

827
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,959
j“ how your love is the best of me j“

828
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:15,881
j“ yeah, there's so much
I want you to know j“

829
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:22,429
j“ yeah, there's so much
I want you to know j“

830
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,268
j“ guess I'll wait till you're home j“

831
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,896
oh, no, no, no.

832
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,231
You are not taking over my bed.

833
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,109
This is your bed.

834
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,362
Would you rather sleep outside,

835
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,364
back in the snow?

836
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:42,699
That can be arranged.

837
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:56,421
You'll be the best dad
our children could ever hope for.

838
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,582
Hey! Hey!

839
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:33,750
What?

840
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,002
Is this what you use that bike for?

841
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,629
Yeah. It's my job.

842
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,090
Waiting tables and pumping gas,
that's a job.

843
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:44,010
I also work nights at a pizza shop
and weekends at a thrift store, so...

844
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:49,057
- Huh.
- You're Mr. Anderson, aren't you?

845
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:50,475
Mm-hm.

846
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,435
You used to come
to presentations at school.

847
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,896
When was that?

848
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,940
Mrs. Anderson was my teacher.

849
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,112
She was the first person
that didn't treat me like a freak

850
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,571
'cause I'm transgender.

851
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,159
She was the first
to call me by my new name.

852
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:11,496
She got the other teachers to do it too.

853
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,000
It really helped me at school.

854
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,420
I won't leave these here anymore.

855
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:22,006
Hey.

856
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,218
What's your name?

857
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,637
- Malcolm.
- Malcolm.

858
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,389
Otto.

859
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,849
Nice to meet you, Otto.

860
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,522
Hey!

861
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,319
Otto! Good news.

862
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,362
Andy's teaching me how to drive.

863
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:45,530
The wrong way.

864
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,366
- Thank you.
- Of course.

865
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,869
- All right.
- Okay.

866
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,245
- Bye.
- Bye.

867
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,621
Park!

868
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,374
You're still in drive! It's an automatic.

869
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:59,377
You were still in drive.
You gotta put it into park.

870
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:00,461
In what?

871
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,180
- Help!
- I'm coming!

872
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,851
Saving the Princess!

873
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,103
- All right. Coming!
- Otto!

874
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:20,482
Otto's here!
My mom made her salpores.

875
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,192
Hey, Otto. Come in.

876
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,070
I can't stand watching
one idiot teach another how to drive.

877
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:28,156
You. Put on your coat. It's lesson time.

878
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,240
What?

879
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,827
You're gonna teach me? Really?

880
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,080
Otto, thank you!

881
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,749
- Mm.
- Thank you.

882
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,086
I'll be right out!

883
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,922
That's really, really nice of you, Otto.
Thank you.

884
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:46,800
I tried once.

885
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,469
You guys, okay.

886
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,553
Bye, Otto!

887
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:54,140
- Mama's going on a ride.
- Be careful, honey.

888
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,725
- Bye, mama!
- Bye, mi vida.

889
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,977
Have fun, guys!

890
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:58,937
Bye, mama!

891
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,021
All right.

892
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,566
- No more grown-ups. Come on!
- Yay!

893
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:08,029
Ah. Otto, pero can we go in our car?

894
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,532
Because I've only ever driven automatic.

895
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:11,615
No.

896
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:14,661
I'm teaching you how to drive. Get in.

897
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:22,460
Now, coming up on the red light.
You're going to have to stop.

898
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,379
Okay, but I get the clutch, right?

899
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,298
You get the clutch
and then press in on the brake.

900
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:30,468
- Do I hit the brake or the clutch?
- No, keep the clutch in.

901
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,470
Put in the brake, I put the clutch.

902
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,472
Clutch and brake. And now brake.

903
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,391
- Brake. Brake.
- No.No.

904
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,978
- Don't shout at me.
- I am not shouting at you.

905
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,271
Clutch in. It's in, it's in!

906
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,231
We're going to stop, and...

907
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:46,651
Clutch in, and brake.
Brake. Brake. Brake.

908
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,612
The car is stopped.
Don't hit the car! Brake, brake!

909
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,781
Yes. All right, let go.

910
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,367
Oh, my god.

911
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,412
It's clutch and brake.

912
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,581
I suck at this.

913
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,541
- I suck.
- You're learning.

914
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,962
Oh, my god, I almost hit the car.
It's like this.

915
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,089
It doesn't matter. It's a hybrid.

916
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,382
It's a hybrid, okay.

917
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,427
- Okay, I should move back.
- No, no, no. No.

918
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,762
- You're fine right where you are.
- But I'm very close.

919
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,931
- Doesn't matter.
- I don't need to go back?

920
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,895
Just wait for the green light.

921
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,604
And here we go. So press in on the clutch.

922
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,731
And give it a little gas.

923
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,149
Slowly let out on the clu...

924
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,442
Oh, you're not in gear.

925
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,028
Green!

926
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,907
Press in on the clutch, shift into fi...
You don't have to turn the key.

927
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,408
- Go!
- Just press in...

928
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,453
- Oh, my god.
- Press in on the...

929
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,296
Slowly let out the clutch,

930
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,765
- then press the gas.
- I can't do this.

931
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,958
- That is all you have to do.
- I can't do this.

932
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,878
No, Otto. Otto, no.

933
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:48,838
What?

934
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,632
Oh, shit.

935
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:51,925
What is wrong with you?

936
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,302
She's learning how to drive.

937
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,429
Did you not have to learn how to drive?

938
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:59,682
Calm down, old man. Hey, hey.

939
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:03,144
I'm not your old man! You son of a bitch!

940
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,523
If you honk that horn one more time,

941
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,150
it'll be the last thing you do.
You hear me? Huh?

942
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:10,818
5 comprende?

943
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,322
Oh, shit.

944
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,410
Now you listen to me.

945
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:23,706
You have given birth to two children.
Soon it'll be three.

946
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:27,627
You have come here
from a country very far away.

947
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,295
You learned a new language,

948
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,881
you got yourself an education
and a nitwit husband

949
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,050
and you are holding that family together.

950
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,636
You will have no problem
learning how to drive.

951
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,888
My god,
the world is full of complete idiots

952
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,808
who have managed to figure it out,
and you are not a complete idiot.

953
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,315
Clutch.

954
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:51,359
Shift.

955
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,530
Drive.

956
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,714
Que bueno.

957
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:13,840
Que bueno.

958
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,553
Okay, there's a spot right there.

959
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,888
Just pull up, parallel,

960
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:25,852
and back the car up until that bumper
is in line with your side-view mirror.

961
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,271
Now straighten out.

962
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,898
Back up all the way up to the curb.

963
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,653
- A little bit.
- Well, a little bit.

964
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:36,779
And stop.

965
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:38,865
Neutral.

966
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:41,284
Brake.

967
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,368
Key.

968
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:46,623
Is that it?

969
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:47,749
That's it.

970
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,585
And we're right on time.

971
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:52,837
Ihaveit

972
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,965
Uh-huh.

973
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,675
These are semlors.

974
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,597
- Swedish éclairs.
- Oh!

975
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,890
They're a little messy.

976
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,184
- But let's try.
- Yes.

977
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,310
With your finger.

978
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,320
How did you find this place?

979
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:19,656
This was Sonya's place.

980
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:24,577
We used to come here
every Saturday at 1:00.

981
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,414
And then? What?

982
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,249
Go home at 2:00.

983
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,544
I'd wash and wax the car,

984
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:38,174
and she would grade her papers and cook
and spend the rest of the day reading.

985
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,093
What kind of books?

986
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:42,970
Her books.

987
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,516
I tried to read some of them, but...

988
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,600
I'm just...

989
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,519
I'm not into books.

990
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,106
Her friends said
that we were like night and day.

991
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,695
My life was black-and-white
before I met Sonya.

992
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:00,905
She was the color.

993
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:05,993
I would have liked her.

994
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,412
She was a force of nature.

995
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,624
She convinced the school
to start up a program

996
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,251
for the kids that needed extra help.

997
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:15,545
A lot of kids had problems at home

998
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,715
or, uh, social anxieties.

999
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,093
But by the time Sonya was done with 'em,

1000
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,761
they were reciting Shakespeare.

1001
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,101
I ran into one of her students,

1002
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,353
just the other day.

1003
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,232
A kid named Malcolm.

1004
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,906
You need more cream.

1005
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,199
Okay.

1006
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:53,916
We all got along fine, of course,
when we first moved in.

1007
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,293
It was like a gift.

1008
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,253
Welcome to the neighborhood.

1009
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,338
- Hi, I'm Sonya.
- I'm Anita.

1010
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:02,008
Sonya and Anita were best friends.

1011
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,010
So I got my Allen keys...

1012
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,512
And Reuben and I were a lot alike.

1013
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,930
Hey! Slow down!

1014
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:09,891
About most things.

1015
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:11,642
Idiot.

1016
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:13,478
But people change.

1017
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,271
Or they don't change.

1018
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:19,233
Things happen. People drift apart.

1019
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,945
They build walls. They take offense.

1020
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,740
Who knows why.

1021
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:31,245
Maybe it was all the construction
that drove everybody crazy.

1022
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:34,207
You know, there used to be
a forest up on that hill.

1023
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,334
That's why they call it birchwood.

1024
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,336
Then they started building
all those condos

1025
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,670
and cut down all the birches.

1026
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:42,673
They didn't even realize
what they were doing until we told them,

1027
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:43,758
Reuben and I.

1028
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,010
But this was before the coup?

1029
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,846
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Reuben and I were friends then.

1030
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:52,475
After that,
all we saw were the differences.

1031
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:27,718
A few years later, their son, Chris,
he, uh, took a job in Japan,

1032
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:30,346
and I don't think
he's been back to visit them since.

1033
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,516
- Oh.
- Reuben and he never did get along.

1034
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,186
Anyway, that's when I decided
to Bury the hatchet.

1035
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,271
Reuben.

1036
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,315
Hey.

1037
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,152
Sonya gave me this a while back.

1038
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:46,863
Never found the occasion.

1039
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:50,867
I thought maybe we could start fresh.

1040
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,206
Hey, would you like to see my new car?

1041
01:12:58,833 --> 01:12:59,959
Sure.

1042
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,210
It's a new model.

1043
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,337
Just came out.

1044
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:13,555
A Toyota?

1045
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,976
You bought a Toyota.

1046
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,020
Celica gt convertible.

1047
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,522
Five-speed automatic.

1048
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:24,150
You gotta change with the times.

1049
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,193
Otto!

1050
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:32,033
I don't know what went wrong with Reuben,
but that's when I knew I'd lost him.

1051
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,285
I mean, a man has to stand up
for what he believes in.

1052
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:37,038
Even if it is an f-o-r-d.

1053
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:44,629
And you and Sonya,
did you ever think about having children?

1054
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,593
Well, 2:00.

1055
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,971
Okay.

1056
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,815
I was wondering
if you could help us out tonight.

1057
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:07,610
Me and Tommy don't get a lot of time
to go out for dinner

1058
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:08,986
before the baby comes.

1059
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:11,405
I'm not gonna drive you two
around on a date.

1060
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,867
No. We're gonna take a cab.

1061
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,703
What do you need me for, then?

1062
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:20,957
- Mama, I did not! Why would I?
- Yes, you did!

1063
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,792
- Give it back!
- You gotta catch me!

1064
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,710
You guys, por favor.

1065
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,759
And learn to share your everything.

1066
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,637
I'm not sure about this.

1067
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,723
No. Don't be silly.
It's gonna be very fun.

1068
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:41,602
If you remember,
Abbie has to be in bed by 9:00, okay?

1069
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,020
You're good?

1070
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:47,858
So, alarm code, 4491.4491.

1071
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:51,112
I'm setting it to "armed stay."
Are you paying attention?

1072
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,822
So if you wanna go out,

1073
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:56,158
you just have to press this button here,
and it's disalarmed.

1074
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:57,994
I'll be right here.

1075
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,329
Right. Yeah.

1076
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:02,665
Well, you never know.

1077
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,548
Be good to abuelo Otto please, okay?

1078
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,710
We will!

1079
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,632
I don't see chocolate milk in here.

1080
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:15,469
You make it with the syrup.
But not too much. It'll keep her awake.

1081
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:18,931
Give me milk.

1082
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,266
What is that?

1083
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,227
That's the goddamn useless dishwasher.

1084
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:27,481
Dad said he wanted
to throw it out the window,

1085
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,984
but mom said dad isn't allowed
to open windows anymore.

1086
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:36,782
Head.

1087
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:38,868
Cabeza.

1088
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,495
- Cabeza.
- Cabeza.

1089
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,330
Eyes.

1090
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:45,791
Ojos.

1091
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,377
- Ojos.
- Ojos.

1092
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,007
Arm. Brazo.

1093
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,342
Arm. Brazo.

1094
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,226
I don't think this is a good idea.

1095
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,519
Why?

1096
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,482
Because no one stands a chance
against a luchadoro.

1097
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,984
Abuelo luchadoro!

1098
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,153
Abuelo luchadoro!

1099
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:17,073
Help me, help me.

1100
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,699
Wait, no, he started it.

1101
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,994
- Ready?
- Rub it and smack!

1102
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,706
Rub it and smack! Smack! Karate chop!

1103
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:37,927
Huh.

1104
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:04,423
Wow, it's awfully quiet, huh?

1105
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,627
Hey, guys.

1106
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,045
Hi.

1107
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,966
She was already asleep.

1108
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,511
How was it?

1109
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,306
- Fine.
- You did a good job tonight, Otto.

1110
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,933
You should pat yourself on the back.

1111
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:37,361
- Thank you, Otto.
- Yeah.

1112
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:38,696
Exit now.

1113
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:39,947
Have a good night.

1114
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:42,158
Okay.

1115
01:17:58,257 --> 01:17:59,425
How did he do that?

1116
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,184
- Hi, Otto.
- Malcolm.

1117
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:12,021
You can't hear your chain rattle
when you switch gears like that?

1118
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,648
- My bike's getting old.
- Don't blame the bike.

1119
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,650
You just have to adjust your derailleur.

1120
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:20,529
- My what?
- Your derailleur needs adjusting.

1121
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,993
Uh, excuse me.

1122
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,828
- Hi, I'm shari Kenzie.
- Hi.

1123
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:30,080
I'm a social media journalist.

1124
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:33,334
I'm, um, looking for Otto Anderson.

1125
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,419
Are you sure you wanna do that?

1126
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:45,095
Wow. It's great. That's amazing.

1127
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,348
You treat it right, it'll treat you right.

1128
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,266
Here. Keep the set.

1129
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,476
Thanks, Otto.

1130
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:55,773
I can't believe I'm helping you
throw crap onto people's lawns.

1131
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:57,191
Isn't two jobs enough?

1132
01:18:58,275 --> 01:18:59,860
I'm saving up for a car.

1133
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,278
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1134
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:02,905
What kind?

1135
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,114
Volkswagen.

1136
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,708
Young lady, you're blocking the garage.

1137
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:17,962
Mr. Anderson? My name is shari Kenzie.

1138
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:20,547
I'm a social media journalist, and I...

1139
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:21,966
What is that?

1140
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:25,636
I have an online series
called everyday heroes.

1141
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:28,722
What you did the other day
at the train station was amazing.

1142
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,140
You saved that man's life.

1143
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,642
You have the wrong guy.

1144
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,397
No, I don't. I've watched the video
at least a dozen times.

1145
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,940
- It's you.
- Video?

1146
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,358
You haven't seen it?

1147
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:43,153
Oh. A commuter recorded what happened
on their phone and posted it online.

1148
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:46,949
Someone in the comments recognized you.
That's how I tracked you down.

1149
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,951
It's gotten over a million views.

1150
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,786
A million? A million.

1151
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:53,163
Why can't people mind their own business?

1152
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:56,625
Because stories like yours are inspiring.

1153
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,836
If I could just talk to you
for a few minutes...

1154
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:01,338
No, now I've got too many things
I have to do.

1155
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,716
I recorded a video message
from the man you saved.

1156
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:04,925
You should see this.

1157
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:07,052
- Um... just pull it up.
- Otto! Hi!

1158
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,054
Good morning.

1159
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:11,097
Good morning.

1160
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:13,600
Uh...

1161
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:16,371
So you ready for another driving lesson?

1162
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,314
- Now's not a good time.
- No?

1163
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:20,607
Hello? Hello? Hey, I'm still in here!

1164
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:22,401
- I didn't lock you in.
- Hello?

1165
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,695
Turn the knob, open the door.

1166
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:27,072
Opened a door before, haven't you?

1167
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:28,157
Idiot.

1168
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,953
Otto! It's me.

1169
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,121
She's gone.

1170
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,499
Good. I'm not through with my rounds.

1171
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,961
"Social media journalist"?

1172
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,504
What the hell does that even mean?

1173
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:46,425
Buncha knotheads pointin'
a camera at themselves.

1174
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,177
I thought you handled it really well.

1175
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,304
I mean, closing her in your garage.

1176
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:54,016
That was, like, excellent strategy.

1177
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,894
Good job.

1178
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:03,108
Otto, also, I was thinking
you've done so much for us.

1179
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:06,111
- I wanna do something for you too.
- I don't need anything.

1180
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:09,948
Well, I think you could do
with some decent food. Sometimes. No?

1181
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,116
Those cookies...

1182
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,743
The what? The "salporanz"?

1183
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,204
Those are not bad. They're not bad.

1184
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:17,414
And, also, I was thinking

1185
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:21,919
that I can help you clean out your house
and clean out the front hall in your home,

1186
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:25,381
and help you pack the coats and shoes
you have there of Sonya's.

1187
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:26,673
That's not needed.

1188
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:30,511
No, but it can help you move on.

1189
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,221
I don't wanna move on.

1190
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,139
She's always gonna be with you.

1191
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:36,266
- But you're still here.
- Ah...

1192
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,476
That's enough.

1193
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:42,606
When my father died,
my mother, she stopped living.

1194
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,858
- She just stopped like she used...
- Stop talking!

1195
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:48,278
- Stop it.
- Okay! Don't yell at me.

1196
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,659
Why can't people mind
their own business? Idiots.

1197
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,120
Interrupting me at every turn.

1198
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:59,498
The more they babble, the more
they drown out the memory of her voice.

1199
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:03,043
I don't want to clear Sonya from my life.

1200
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:04,503
She was everything.

1201
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,339
There was nothing before her,
and there's nothing after!

1202
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:09,383
I'm something.

1203
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,055
That son of a bitch!

1204
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:18,016
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

1205
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,685
Uh—uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh.

1206
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,438
Stop right there. You stop that car!

1207
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:26,024
Did you leave that gate open?
You left that gate open, didn't you?

1208
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:27,734
You're the only one who gives a damn.

1209
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,695
I give a damn
about people following the rules.

1210
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,156
Yes, I know. I know all about you.

1211
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,992
There's a file on you at the office.
It's this thick.

1212
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,535
I know about your wife.

1213
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,680
How you blame whatever happened to her
on everybody else.

1214
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:39,705
You shut up.

1215
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,416
Don't you say one more word.

1216
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,586
Take it easy, Otto.
Look, I'm not trying to upset you,

1217
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:48,964
but you really shouldn't be living alone.

1218
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:53,719
I mean, we know more about you
than you probably realize, so...

1219
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,555
Just look after that heart of yours, okay?

1220
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:57,931
What do you know about my heart?

1221
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,851
Hey, what do you know about my heart?!

1222
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,895
You prying bastard!

1223
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,188
Otto, Otto.

1224
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,066
Otto, what's going on?
Are you okay? Do you feel okay?

1225
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,235
You wanna help me, close the gate.

1226
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,584
Otto. Otto.

1227
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,712
Otto.

1228
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:32,382
Otto.

1229
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,636
Talk to me, Otto. Please?

1230
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:40,223
Otto.

1231
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,273
Talk to me, Otto.

1232
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:03,747
Otto.

1233
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:08,585
Otto.

1234
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:27,729
Thank you.

1235
01:24:57,551 --> 01:24:59,261
It'll be cute on you.

1236
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:00,929
- No.
- Aw, c'mon.

1237
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:04,141
Honey, you look really cute.

1238
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:50,140
Give me your hand.

1239
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:51,808
The baby's really kicking.

1240
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:06,072
I'll be right back.

1241
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:47,197
J“oohj“

1242
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:53,787
j“ a-ha, ooh j“

1243

1246

j“ I know you have a little life

1247
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:16,601
Sonya!

1248
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:20,438
J“ I know you have
a lot of strength left j“

1249
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:21,356
Sonya!

1250
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,860
J“ I should be crying
but I just can't let it show j“

1251
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:28,738
j“ I should be hoping
but I can't stop thinking j“

1252
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,867
j“ of all the things I should've said
that I never said j“

1253
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,427
j“ all the things we should've done j“

1254
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,451
Sonya!

1255
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:36,371
J“ that we never did j“

1256
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:39,541
j“ all the things I should've given
but I didn't j“

1257
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:42,711
j“ oh, darling j“

1258
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,339
J“ make it go j“

1259
01:29:46,423 --> 01:29:50,760
j“ make it go away j“

1260
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:58,059
J“ give me your hand j“

1262

j“ I know you have

1263
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:08,862
j“ I know you have a little life
in you yet j“

1264
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:12,073
j“ I know you have
a lot of strength left j“

1265
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:16,411
j“ I should be crying
but I just can't let it show j“

1266
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:22,459
j“ I should be hoping
but I can't stop thinking j“

1267
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:27,130
johj'

1268
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:28,131
there you are.

1269
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:30,592
J“ of all the things we should've said
that we never said j“

1270
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:34,262
j“ all the things we should've done
that we never did j“

1271
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:40,852
J“ oh, darling, make it go away j“

1272
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:46,858
j“ just make it go away now j“

1273
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,777
That's enough now, darling.

1274
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:55,992
You're angry. I know.

1275
01:30:58,119 --> 01:30:59,204
And sad.

1276
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,123
So am I.

1277
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:06,252
But now we have to live.

1278
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,715
[Gunshofl

1279
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:22,477
What now?

1280
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:29,192
Malcolm.

1281
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,902
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

1282
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:32,737
I'm not gonna shoot you.

1283
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:33,863
What was that noise?

1284
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:37,075
The generator blew and the power is out.

1285
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,119
What d'ya want? It's freezing.

1286
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:42,890
I was hoping you might let me crash
on your couch for the night.

1287
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:44,791
This is not a hotel.

1288
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,628
No. I'm sorry.

1289
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:50,380
Why can't you go home?

1290
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:54,676
My dad kicked me out.

1291
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:01,891
There's a sofa you can use.

1292
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:06,021
Don't go into the dining room.
The ceiling needs repair.

1293
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:08,189
It's upstairs in Sonya's old study.

1294
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:11,067
So why did he kick you out?

1295
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:13,236
Because you're Malcolm now?

1296
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:15,321
Yeah, because I'm Malcolm.

1297
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:17,490
Because I dress like this.

1298
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:21,786
I read too much.
I don't like sports. Take your pick.

1299
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:24,039
He's embarrassed 'cause I'm trans.

1300
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:25,540
Then he's an idiot.

1301
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,252
This is you.

1302
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:31,004
Try not to touch anything.

1303
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:32,130
Okay.

1304
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:33,149
Well...

1305
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:34,776
Good morning. The power's still out

1306
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,403
so I cooked up the last of the eggs
while they're still good.

1307
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,239
Hope you don't mind.

1308
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,992
I have to do my rounds.

1309
01:33:43,076 --> 01:33:44,828
Don't you at least want some coffee first?

1310
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:56,172
There you go.

1311
01:33:57,674 --> 01:33:58,716
Uh, some eggs?

1312
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:00,969
I wouldn't say no.

1313
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:02,679
All right.

1314
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,865
That can...

1315
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:24,284
Goes in here.

1316
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:28,705
Hang that up.

1317
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:37,046
Hey, Otto! Making your rounds.

1318
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,632
You mind if I join you?
I need to get my steps in.

1319
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:40,717
Okay.

1320
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:42,677
- I'm Jimmy.
- Malcolm.

1321
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,179
- Nice to meet you.
- Aw, thanks.

1322
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,098
Yes.

1323
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:54,480
Hey, Otto, if you want to slow down,
we can 'cause my beats are up.

1324
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:55,565
Yes.

1325
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:13,625
Otto, did you hear they're moving Reuben
into assisted living this afternoon?

1326
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:14,876
Who is?

1327
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:16,920
The dye & merika guys.

1328
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:18,129
My god.

1329
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:20,673
They convinced Anita to sell the house.

1330
01:35:20,757 --> 01:35:22,675
No, they made the deal with Chris.

1331
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:25,428
- Chris? He can't do that.
- Yeah, he can.

1332
01:35:25,511 --> 01:35:28,681
After dye & merika found out
Anita had Parkinson's,

1333
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:30,725
they tracked Chris down and...

1334
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:31,935
- Parkinson's?
- Yeah.

1335
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:34,979
So last year Chris convinced Anita
to give him power of attorney

1336
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:36,356
in case she got worse.

1337
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:39,442
So dye & merika made the deal
with Chris to buy the house.

1338
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:40,610
Those pricks.

1339
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:45,240
Wait, Anita found out
she had Parkinson's last year?

1340
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:47,033
No, that's not right.

1341
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,911
She would've told Sonya.
Sonya would've told me.

1342
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,874
Well, Anita and Reuben
didn't want you and Sonya to know.

1343
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,752
They said you had enough
on your plate as it is.

1344
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,505
They said that?

1345
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:15,061
I need to see everything
you ever got from dye & merika.

1346
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:18,231
Notices, letters. Do you have
a copy of the power of attorney?

1347
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:19,941
How do you know about that?

1348
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,609
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

1349
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:22,694
- Get it.
- Yes.

1350
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:29,575
And any records
of Reuben's condition and yours.

1351
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:31,452
Did Jimmy tell you that?

1352
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:32,954
Can you get it now?

1353
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:41,337
I've been an idiot.

1354
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:46,718
I got so wrapped up in my own troubles,
I stopped thinking of anyone else.

1355
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,137
And I figured
they weren't thinking about me.

1356
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:52,515
Friends shouldn't do that.

1357
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:57,937
This isn't easy to say
after all this time.

1358
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:00,106
But I'm sorry.

1359
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:05,153
And I will sort all this out.

1360
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:19,292
I need to use your phone.

1361
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:23,212
Why can't you use your own?

1362
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:26,049
Mine is disconnected at the moment.

1363
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,720
- Why?
- That doesn't matter.

1364
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:32,847
I just need to use your phone, okay?

1365
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:36,059
You know what?

1366
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:42,523
You won't tell me
why your phone is disconnected?

1367
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:45,943
You won't tell me
why you need to use my phone?

1368
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:49,155
You won't tell me what happened
to you in the street yesterday?

1369
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:52,950
And then you went inside
and you wouldn't even open the door?

1370
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,454
You scared me, Otto.

1371
01:37:58,206 --> 01:38:00,249
Do you know how long I was out there?

1372
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:03,294
And I didn't know
if something had happened to you.

1373
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:06,798
Or if something was gonna happen to you.

1374
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:11,552
And I'm sorry if I said
the wrong thing about Sonya's coats.

1375
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,054
But I was just trying to help.

1376
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:17,392
And you left me out there.

1377
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:22,188
So, no. You can't use my phone.

1378
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:31,572
You think your life is so hard
because everybody's an idiot

1379
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:33,576
and you have to do everything
on your own, right?

1380
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,159
Right?

1381
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:38,329
But guess what.

1382
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:40,665
You can't.

1383
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:42,917
No one can.

1384
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:45,962
And I think you should just be happy

1385
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:48,445
that someone was trying
to help you get through a crappy day.

1386
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:51,551
Even if they're an idiot.

1387
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:55,054
- So...
- The real estate bastards

1388
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:58,099
are trying to force
Anita and Reuben out of their home.

1389
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,393
That's why I need to use your phone.

1390
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:05,940
Okay, fine. Come on.

1391
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,333
We had never had a vacation.

1392
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,256
Sonya was six months pregnant.

1393
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:35,219
And she wanted to do something special
before the baby came.

1394
01:39:36,012 --> 01:39:38,514
So we booked a trip to Niagara Falls.

1395
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:42,435
On the way back, the bus crashed.

1396
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:46,689
There'd been a recall on the brake lines,

1397
01:39:46,772 --> 01:39:48,816
but the company never had them fixed.

1398
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:51,861
Sonya was paralyzed...

1399
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:55,448
And we lost our son.

1400
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:01,787
After three months,
she was finally able to come home.

1401
01:40:02,872 --> 01:40:05,791
But they had started building
the new condos

1402
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:09,086
and the community center
and the walkways,

1403
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:12,298
none of which were designed
for people in wheelchairs.

1404
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:15,801
The builders could have
changed their plans.

1405
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:21,057
But the laws weren't in place back then,
and they didn't care.

1406
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:22,767
I did.

1407
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:26,229
- We're putting in a new playground...
- I cared.

1408
01:40:26,312 --> 01:40:29,065
- There's places for people like your wife.
- And I was so angry.

1409
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:32,235
What does that mean?
People like her? What does that mean?

1410
01:40:32,318 --> 01:40:34,779
- What're you tryin' to say?!
- Get off of me!

1411
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:39,825
That's when they voted me out
as head of the homeowners' association.

1412
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,080
I wanted to obliterate them all.

1413
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:47,917
The builders, and the realtors,
and the bus company, the bus driver.

1414
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,627
I never would have let it go...

1415
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:52,338
But for Sonya.

1416
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,550
Sonya said we had to keep living.

1417
01:40:58,803 --> 01:40:59,887
That's what I did.

1418
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:02,765
I lived for Sonya.

1419
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:09,021
Six months ago she passed away.

1420
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:10,898
Cancer.

1421
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:16,445
I was going to join her.

1422
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:20,658
That's why I had them disconnect my phone.

1423
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:26,789
But now I think
she wants me to keep living.

1424
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:32,169
And I have things to do.

1425
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,870
You're wasting your time, Otto.

1426
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:08,414
It's a done deal. Reuben's coming with us.

1427
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:10,541
And if you get in our way,

1428
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:11,876
I'll have you arrested.

1429
01:42:12,501 --> 01:42:15,379
- I'm not doing a thing.
- Don't you take another step.

1430
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:18,049
You are not taking my husband
away from me.

1431
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:22,303
Anita, please.
We're doing this for your own good.

1432
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:25,473
What you're doing
is trying to take my property.

1433
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:30,603
I want Reuben to stay right here
for the rest of his life,

1434
01:42:30,686 --> 01:42:32,605
with me in our home.

1435
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:36,859
Okay, but who's gonna take care of Reuben
when you're no longer able to?

1436
01:42:36,942 --> 01:42:39,362
Who's gonna take care of you? Otto?

1437
01:42:39,445 --> 01:42:42,448
Otto's not in the best health either.
Are you, Otto?

1438
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:44,784
I'll take care of 'em.

1439
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:49,580
- What are you doing? Put that down.
- Anita and Reuben are like family to me.

1440
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:51,415
I'll take care of them
as long as they need.

1441
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:53,584
They're not your family.

1442
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:57,213
Uh, their son, Chris, has decided
they're not fit enough to be on their own,

1443
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:59,215
and so what we're doing is...

1444
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:02,635
Excuse me. When was the last time
Chris saw his parents?

1445
01:43:02,718 --> 01:43:06,389
He lives in Japan.
They've been estranged for 10 years.

1446
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:08,766
Chris would have no idea
how his parents are doing,

1447
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:10,518
except for what you told him.

1448
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,436
Okay. And who are you?

1449
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,397
My name is shari Kenzie.

1450
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,399
Social media journalist.

1451
01:43:16,482 --> 01:43:19,276
- We're streaming live right now.
- Uh...

1452
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:22,780
All right, all right,
shut that camera off. You can't film this.

1453
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:24,657
It's a public sidewalk.

1454
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:27,993
You told Anita's son, Chris,
that she had Parkinson's,

1455
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:31,872
but Anita never told anyone
about her diagnosis.

1456
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:34,041
So how did you know?

1457
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,252
I'd have to check the records.

1458
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:39,964
Mr. Anderson over there
is something of a local hero.

1459
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:45,261
He tells me you know details
about his private health records as well.

1460
01:43:45,344 --> 01:43:47,138
So how are you and your company

1461
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:50,391
getting illegal access
to the medical records of seniors?

1462
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:55,062
Okay, let's go. We're done. We're done.

1463
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:56,897
Very nice to meet you.

1464
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:58,691
No, you're done. You're done!

1465
01:43:58,774 --> 01:44:01,134
- Get that goddamn camera out of my face.
- Goodbye.

1466
01:44:01,193 --> 01:44:03,070
- We did it!
- Oh, we did!

1467
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:06,449
Bye, thank you!

1468
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:09,452
I first uploaded Anita and Chris's story
an hour ago.

1469
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:12,163
Already dozens of people are saying

1470
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:14,957
dye & merika forced them
out of their homes.

1471
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,792
- That was easy.
- Yeah, goodbye.

1472
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:20,212
If you have a story,
share it with me at shari_kenzie.

1473
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:22,506
I got it. I got it.

1474
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:26,302
Hey, you forgot to shut the gate!

1475
01:44:26,385 --> 01:44:29,305
You see that?
He just rolled right over. Gave up.

1476
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:31,599
In our day, the bastards would
at least put up a fight.

1477
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,602
They haven't gotten rid of us yet.

1478
01:44:45,237 --> 01:44:47,448
It does feel pretty good. Doesn't it?

1479
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:57,541
Neighborly neighbors,
a thing of the past?

1480
01:44:57,625 --> 01:45:01,712
Well, I'm here with eyewitnesses
Anita and Jimmy to find out more.

1481
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:04,924
Jimmy, you mentioned that Anita
and Reuben are like family to you.

1482
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:06,675
What does that mean, exactly?

1483
01:45:06,759 --> 01:45:09,512
Well, I have dinner at their house
nearly every single night.

1484
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:17,311
I know what you're waiting for.
You're ready for lunch, aren't you?

1485
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:19,814
I know what you want.

1486
01:45:22,608 --> 01:45:24,151
Whoa. Here we go.

1487
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:26,075
You moved into this community recently.

1488
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,239
- How has that been for you?
- It's been beautiful.

1489
01:45:28,322 --> 01:45:31,158
And your family,
to have people there that are...

1490
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:34,078
- Otto?
- Will you air this in Mexico?

1491
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:35,162
Otto!

1492
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:38,165
Call an ambulance!

1493
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:54,849
- Ms. Mendes? You can see him now.
- Yes?

1494
01:45:54,932 --> 01:45:56,642
Yes. Yeah.

1495
01:46:01,814 --> 01:46:04,108
Hola, abuelo Otto.

1496
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:20,040
Ms. Mendes?

1497
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,042
I'm Dr. Ellis.

1498
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:24,211
Mr. Anderson listed you as next of kin.

1499
01:46:25,087 --> 01:46:27,840
Yes. Yes, that's correct.

1500
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:31,010
Your uncle had a close call.
Has he spoken to you about his condition?

1501
01:46:31,844 --> 01:46:33,137
Mm...

1502
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,972
No, not really. No.

1503
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:37,558
It's called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

1504
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:40,769
Basically, his heart is too big.

1505
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:44,398
Too big?

1506
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:45,482
Mm-hm.

1507
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:47,693
Oh, okay.

1508
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:57,870
No, sorry. It's okay.

1509
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:11,967
You're really bad at dying, you know that?

1510
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,600
Ay.

1511
01:47:23,729 --> 01:47:25,564
Otto, I think it's time.

1512
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:27,983
I think it's time.

1513
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:30,444
It's time.

1514
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:33,572
Oh, uh, I'm a cardiologist.
I'll page ob for you.

1515
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:40,162
Do something. It's time!

1516
01:47:48,087 --> 01:47:49,672
All right, ready?

1517
01:47:49,755 --> 01:47:51,590
All right, picture, everybody!

1518
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:57,221
Picture, picture, picture.

1519
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:01,976
All right. Ready? Everybody say, "Marco."

1520
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:04,603
One, two, three.

1521
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:07,648
Marco!

1522
01:48:10,693 --> 01:48:11,860
Otto!

1523
01:48:11,944 --> 01:48:14,279
- Hola. Hi!
- Hey, Otto. Come in.

1524
01:48:14,363 --> 01:48:16,490
Everyone, this is our friend Otto.

1525
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:17,700
Hi, Otto!

1526
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:21,745
Hey, Otto.

1527
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:25,332
Sorry, is this about the cars
that are in front?

1528
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:27,501
No, I brought you something.

1529
01:48:30,087 --> 01:48:31,505
Otto.

1530
01:48:31,588 --> 01:48:33,173
Otto.

1531
01:48:34,258 --> 01:48:35,884
I gave it a fresh coat of paint.

1532
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,594
I love it.

1533
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,221
- It's for the baby.
- Yes.

1534
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:43,517
Thank you.
Okay, hold him one second, please.

1535
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,310
- Why?
- To show Tommy.

1536
01:48:45,394 --> 01:48:47,146
Hold him. Oh, he's gonna cry.

1537
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:49,523
Whoa...

1538
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,318
I'll be right back, bebé. Okay.

1539
01:48:53,402 --> 01:48:54,486
Tomaso?

1540
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:55,779
Hello. There we are.

1541
01:48:55,863 --> 01:48:58,866
Uh, should I put this thing back in him?

1542
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:06,123
Oh. Yeah.

1543
01:49:06,206 --> 01:49:07,499
Okay.

1544
01:49:07,583 --> 01:49:09,501
Yo soy abuelo Otto.

1545
01:49:10,627 --> 01:49:11,628
Okay?

1546
01:49:14,256 --> 01:49:19,094
Uh, well, let me show you how this works.

1547
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:23,390
You don't have to do anything.

1548
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:24,558
Easy.

1549
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:26,852
Your little head...

1550
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:29,980
Now, you just go...

1551
01:49:30,856 --> 01:49:31,857
Like so.

1552
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:34,233
Huh?

1553
01:49:59,093 --> 01:50:00,803
Sonya, this is Abbie and Luna.

1554
01:50:00,886 --> 01:50:02,763
They have something for you.

1555
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:06,308
- Hi, Sonya.
- Hi, Sonya.

1556
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:11,355
That's, uh, brand-new little Marco there.

1557
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:14,900
And Marisol, Tommy. I told you about them.

1558
01:50:16,193 --> 01:50:18,112
Say, "ho/a. Hola, Sonya."

1559
01:50:18,195 --> 01:50:20,030
She loved pink flowers, girls.

1560
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:21,115
You chose well.

1561
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:23,909
I like pink too.

1562
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,668
You see that?

1563
01:50:56,608 --> 01:50:58,110
- Ready?
- Yes.

1564
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:04,116
Okay.

1565
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:46,909
No, no, no.

1566
01:51:47,618 --> 01:51:48,911
Come on, Otto.

1567
01:51:57,502 --> 01:51:59,963
All right, Malcolm,
check that oil. Check it.

1568
01:52:00,047 --> 01:52:02,758
And let's see, what does it say?

1569
01:52:03,342 --> 01:52:04,801
Looks good, right?

1570
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:06,803
- If you say so.
- Okay.

1571
01:52:06,887 --> 01:52:09,431
That's it. Okay, now...

1572
01:52:10,432 --> 01:52:11,433
Here's your manual.

1573
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:13,268
Here's your papers.

1574
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:15,562
And the key.

1575
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:16,688
It's your car.

1576
01:52:17,856 --> 01:52:19,066
Are you kidding me?

1577
01:52:19,149 --> 01:52:20,192
Nope.

1578
01:52:20,275 --> 01:52:21,109
What?

1579
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:23,070
Otto!

1580
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:25,364
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

1581
01:52:26,615 --> 01:52:29,618
- Oh, my gosh.
- Saved you from a Volkswagen.

1582
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:31,870
I have a car! I have a car!

1583
01:52:31,954 --> 01:52:34,182
- This is your car!
- Are you kidding me?

1584
01:52:43,173 --> 01:52:45,175
Otto? You got your truck!

1585
01:52:45,259 --> 01:52:47,261
Oh, my god!

1586
01:52:47,344 --> 01:52:48,929
Wanna go for a ride?

1587
01:52:49,972 --> 01:52:51,972
- Let's go for a ride?
- That's a nice truck, Otto.

1588
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:53,558
Be careful.

1589
01:52:53,642 --> 01:52:55,227
I like your car, Otto.

1590
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:57,646
Yeah? Wait till you see how it rides.

1591
01:53:00,941 --> 01:53:02,901
It's enormous.

1592
01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:05,821
This is like Otto's luchador
monster truck.

1593
01:53:05,904 --> 01:53:08,240
Yeah. Do you have any comics?

1594
01:53:08,323 --> 01:53:09,783
Can we get Swedish éclairs?

1595
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:11,076
This is livin'.

1596
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:15,205
J“ every morning I get up j“

1597
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:18,500
J“ look out my window
I get up j'

1598
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:20,335
oh, okay.

1599
01:53:20,419 --> 01:53:24,172
J“ see the sunshine beating down j“

1600
01:53:24,256 --> 01:53:27,968
j“ every morning comes around j“

1601
01:53:28,051 --> 01:53:32,306
johj'

1602
01:53:32,389 --> 01:53:34,766
j“ every morning... j“

1603
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:37,519
Okay, who's ready for breakfast?

1604
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:40,897
Okay. Here we go.

1605
01:53:41,982 --> 01:53:43,984
Okay?

1606
01:53:49,531 --> 01:53:51,843
- I can't believe Marco's 3 already.
- You're such a big boy.

1607
01:53:51,867 --> 01:53:53,187
I'll get it, honey.

1608
01:54:07,716 --> 01:54:08,717
Hey, honey?

1609
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:09,885
Eh?

1610
01:54:11,136 --> 01:54:12,804
Otto hasn't shoveled his walk.

1611
01:54:16,683 --> 01:54:17,963
Watch your brother.

1612
01:54:30,906 --> 01:54:32,074
Get the keys.

1613
01:54:44,544 --> 01:54:45,545
Otto?

1614
01:54:47,881 --> 01:54:48,882
Otto.

1615
01:54:49,549 --> 01:54:50,550
Otto.

1616
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:00,811
Otto.

1617
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:29,339
Marisol.

1618
01:55:41,768 --> 01:55:42,769
Marisol,

1619
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,689
if you're reading this, don't worry.

1620
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:48,442
I haven't done anything stupid.

1621
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:52,529
It turns out having a big heart

1622
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:54,656
isn't as nice as it sounds.

1623
01:55:55,532 --> 01:55:58,452
The doctors warned me
it would get me in the end,

1624
01:55:59,494 --> 01:56:02,747
so I planned ahead, that's all.

1625
01:56:03,457 --> 01:56:06,084
The cat eats tuna twice a day

1626
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:08,879
and likes to do his business in private.

1627
01:56:09,504 --> 01:56:10,589
Please respect that.

1628
01:56:12,549 --> 01:56:14,092
I would like a funeral.

1629
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:16,720
We remember before you this day...

1630
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:18,054
But nothing overblown.

1631
01:56:18,138 --> 01:56:19,181
Our brother Otto.

1632
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:22,350
Just a remembrance of some sort...

1633
01:56:24,769 --> 01:56:28,064
For those people
who thought I pulled my weight.

1634
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:34,738
A local hero and good friend of the show
is being remembered today.

1635
01:56:34,821 --> 01:56:35,822
Otto Anderson.

1636
01:56:35,906 --> 01:56:38,283
Jimmy, would you like to say
a few words about Otto?

1637
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:40,535
Yeah. Otto, we love you.

1638
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:43,830
In your honor, Malcolm and I are doing

1639
01:56:43,914 --> 01:56:48,293
all of your rounds without fail
around lunch and on weekdays.

1640
01:56:49,628 --> 01:56:50,670
You loom large.

1641
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:55,050
My lawyer will give you access
to my bank accounts.

1642
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:58,678
I never wasted money on crap,

1643
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:01,848
so you'll have enough
to get the children through school.

1644
01:57:01,932 --> 01:57:03,433
How'd you do that?

1645
01:57:03,517 --> 01:57:06,186
And do what you like with the rest.

1646
01:57:06,269 --> 01:57:07,604
Oh, good boy.

1647
01:57:07,687 --> 01:57:08,939
Is that a doggie cake?

1648
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:10,273
My little monkey-poo.

1649
01:57:13,443 --> 01:57:14,694
To Otto.

1650
01:57:15,403 --> 01:57:18,865
The house, and everything in it, is yours,

1651
01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:24,079
so long as you promise never to sell it
to those real estate bastards.

1652
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:25,956
And for god's sakes, Marisol...

1653
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:27,123
Tommy.

1654
01:57:27,207 --> 01:57:29,292
Don't let Tommy drive the Chevy.

1655
01:57:32,587 --> 01:57:33,588
Come on.

1656
01:57:33,672 --> 01:57:35,966
Or anyone else, for that matter.

1657
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:39,511
I'm trusting it with you alone.

1658
01:57:41,513 --> 01:57:45,267
Because you are not an idiot.

1659
01:57:48,353 --> 01:57:50,814
Abuelo Otto.

1660
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:05,662
J“ sun through the shadows j“

1661
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:08,999
j“ light through the door j“

1662
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:14,254
j“ voice like an echo j“

1663
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:17,966
j“ I can't hear anymore j“

1664
01:58:19,676 --> 01:58:21,970
j“ so I follow your steps j“

1665
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:24,264
j“ while the love that you left j“

1666
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:26,808
j“ ls burned in my heart j“

1667
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:30,812
j“ with dreams in my mind j“

1668
01:58:30,895 --> 01:58:33,231
j“ of the next time that I j“

1669
01:58:33,315 --> 01:58:36,568
j“ have you in my arms j“

1670
01:58:36,651 --> 01:58:43,283
j“ 'cause I will tell
you the whole truth j'

1671
01:58:45,327 --> 01:58:49,080
j“ that there's no color j'

1672
01:58:49,164 --> 01:58:53,293
j“ in the world without you j“

1673
01:58:54,169 --> 01:58:58,173
j“ and I finally see j“

1674
01:58:58,256 --> 01:59:02,552
j“ how your love is the best of me j“

1675
01:59:03,136 --> 01:59:06,681
j“ yeah, there's so much
I want you to know j“

1676
01:59:08,683 --> 01:59:11,269
j“ guess I'll wait till you're home j“

1677
01:59:11,353 --> 01:59:14,439
j“ mm-mm-mm—mm j“

1678
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:19,277
j“ mm-mm-mm—mm j“

1679
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:25,825
j“ the way that you smile j“

1680
01:59:27,619 --> 01:59:29,996
j“ when you think you're alone j“

1681
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:34,709
j“ the best gift of this life j“

1682
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:39,422
j“ is to see you up close j“

1683
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:43,093
j“ now and again j“

1684
01:59:43,176 --> 01:59:45,553
j“ in the palm of my hand j“

1685
01:59:45,637 --> 01:59:47,722
j“ I feel your touch j“

1686
01:59:49,808 --> 01:59:52,018
j“ so I write it all down j“

1687
01:59:52,102 --> 01:59:54,229
j“ in these moments I've found j“

1688
01:59:54,312 --> 01:59:57,524
j“ 'til I see you, my love j“

1689
01:59:57,607 --> 02:00:04,406
j“ and I will tell you the whole truth j“

1690
02:00:06,324 --> 02:00:10,078
j“ that there's no color j'

1691
02:00:10,161 --> 02:00:14,165
j“ in the world without you j“

1692
02:00:15,375 --> 02:00:18,962
j“ and I finally see j“

1693
02:00:19,504 --> 02:00:23,258
j“ how your love is the best of me j“

1694
02:00:23,967 --> 02:00:27,846
j“ yeah, there's so much

1695
02:00:30,724 --> 02:00:34,602
j“ yeah, there's so much

1696
02:00:38,898 --> 02:00:41,860
j“ guess I'll wait 'til you're home j“

02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:46,948
j“ mm-mm-mm—mm. J“
