你觉得我不会割绳子？

你收我6呎绳子的钱
You charged me for 6 feet of rope.

27
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,460
是的，1码是99美分
Oh, yes, it's 99¢ a yard.

28
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,330
我没拿2码，只拿了5呎
I didn't get 2 yards. I got 5 feet.

29
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,460
我们不是以呎计价，是以码计价
Yeah, we don't charge by the foot. We charge by the yard.

30
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,460
1码99美分是1呎33美分 乘以5是1.65美元
99¢ a yard is 33¢ a foot, times 5, that's 1.65.

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,520
我知道，但我不能照你说的 输入电脑
No, I know, but I can't put it into the computer the way that you just said.

34
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,060
哪种电脑不会简单的算术？
What the hell kind of computer can't do simple math?

35
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,230
-我要找店长 -他在吃午餐
-Can I speak to your manager? -He's at lunch.

36
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,110
吃午餐，这年头大家只在乎吃吃吃

37
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,780
-现场有谁可以负责？ -副店长？

这就是副店长？她几岁？
This is the assistant manager? How old is she?

44
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,340
妳不是该去上体育课吗？
Shouldn't you be in gym class?

45
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,460
抱歉，什么？
Sorry, what?

46
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,800
拿去，我有零钱
Here. I got some change.

47
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,510
我替你付多出来的钱
Let me cover that extra 33¢ for you.

48
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,470
我不要你的钱，这跟钱无关
Sir, I do not want your 33¢. And this is not about 33¢.

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
事实是 我只要5呎长的绳子
This is about the fact that I got 5 feet of rope because I want 5 feet of rope.

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,100
不应该付6呎长绳子的钱
And I shouldn't have to pay for 6 feet of rope if I don't want 6 feet.

51
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,440
你要多拿1呎长的绳子吗？
Did you want another foot of rope?

52
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,640
又来了
Not again.

53
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,780
这到底有多难？
How hard can this be?

"不住在这里 就不要把垃圾丢这里"

55
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,350
脚踏车应该放在这里
That bike goes over here.

56
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,980
嘿，你在干嘛？
Hey! What the hell?

57
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,940
那是我的
That's mine.

58
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,780
-应该停在单车架 -我只离开一下子
-It belongs in the bike rack. -I was only gone half a minute.

59
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,240
下次我会把它锁进失物招领室
Next time, I'll lock it up in the lost and found.

60
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,280

Don't you dare let that little rat dog piss on my walkway again.

69
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,870
-我知道是妳 -别理他，王子
-I know it was you. -Ignore him, Prince.

70
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,580
他是个超难搞老头子
He's a nasty, bitter old man. And he has no idea who's doing that.

71
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,710
不知道是谁尿的

72
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,790
妳家的绝对有尿
Well, it was one of you.

73
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,710
叫妳那废柴男友别在大庭广众扭腰献宝
And tell that useless boyfriend of yours to stop stretching his groin in public.

74
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,430
又不是14岁的体操选手
Looks like a 14-year-old Romanian gymnast, for God's sakes.

75
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,990
快点，快滚开
Go on. Get outta here.

76
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,070
快滚开
Go.

是你自己决定要走
You're the one who decided to leave.

91
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,350
你也拿到不少资遣费
And you did get a nice severance package.

92
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,350
你把我从营运部调走
You took me off Operations.

93
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,230
削减我的工时
You cut back on my hours.

94
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,730
把我训练的泰瑞升为我主管
You made Terry, who I trained, my supervisor.

95
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,280
泰瑞没有手机就不知道何年何月
Terry, who can barely figure out what year it is without his phone.

96
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,610
所以我是拿了资遣费
So, yes, I took the severance package.

97
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,200
很遗憾你这么想
I'm sorry you see it that way.

98
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,950
并购之后大家都得调适
We all had to adjust after the merger.

99
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,870
但你这些年来对公司贡献良多
But you've been quite an asset to this company over the years, so--

是真的，你非常可靠
You have. Reliable as hell.

101
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,000
我们会怀念你订的进度表
We're gonna miss those schedules of yours.

104
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,890
奥托，要吃一块你的脸吗？
Okay, Otto. Want a piece of your face?

105
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
谁饿了？
-Who's hungry?

Look at this.

108

不行
No, no.

109
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,650
嘿，等等
Hey, hey, wait!

110
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,280
不不不，妳不可以没有许可就开进来
No, no, no. Hey, you cannot use this road without a permit.

111
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,990
我没停车，只是运送包裹
I'm not parking. I just dropped off a package.

112
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,870
招牌又没说可以运送包裹
The sign doesn't say anything about packages, does it?

113
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,830
只说需要许可，妳没有许可
It says "permits" and you don't have one.

114
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,880
这条街是条死巷
This is not a through street.

祝您愉快，先生
Have a nice day, sir.

116
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,260
妳每次开进来
Every time you come in here

117
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,340
就代表有个住户不能停车
that means one of the residents can't park in front of their homes!

118
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,430
别人不会这样，开白卡车的都很乖
The other guys don't do this. The guys with the white trucks.

119
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,560
怎么你们棕色的都来乱？
How come it's always you brown guys?

120
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,600
我说的不是妳的肤色
And I don't mean that racially!

121
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,570
喂？
Hello.

122
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,150

不不不，机器人！
Oh, no, no, no. Robot, robot, robot!

128
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,630
我要找谁才能停用这支电话？
Well, who do I have to talk to to get this phone number disconnected?

129
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,960
用户服务部门
That's Account Services.

130
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,460
能帮我转接或是要按个号码？
Can you transfer me or should I press a number?

131
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,640
我听那段音乐七分钟了

I would like the electricity shut off at this residence.

134
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,270
-您要搬家？ -不，我要取消帐户
-Are you moving home? -No, I am cancelling the account.

135
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,860
A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.
A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N

136
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,360
这六天为何不能退费？
And why can't you refund me for the six days?

137
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,240
O-T-T-O.
O-T-T-O

138
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
是公司规定
Oh, it's policy.

139
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,780
我的规定是多付六天瓦斯费
Well, my policy is that if I'm going to pay for six days of gas,

140
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,240
就能多用六天的瓦斯
then I will use six days of gas.

141
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,990
就这样
Then we are done here.

142
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,830
白痴
Idiots.

143
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,780
好了
Okay.

144
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,790
往前，停下来，往前
Go, go, go. Stop. Go.

145
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,960
好了，停下来
Okay. Yeah. Stop.

146
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,170
倒车，你看不到，小心点，用原力
Back. You're in the blind spot, be careful. Use the Force.

147
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,420
-噢，不行 -你会开上人行道
Good, good. No, you're going on the sidewalk.

148
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,510
很好
Okay.

149
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,590
倒车倒车
Back, back, back.

-Stop. Stop.

152
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,480
可恶
Ah, shit.

153
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,440
他在搞什么鬼？
What the hell is he doing?

154
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,280
没错，我也是这么说
Yes! Exactly! That's exactly what I was saying.

155
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,900
你们不能随便开进来
-Hey, you can't just drive here.

156
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,910
我没开车，我在开车吗？
I'm not driving. Am I driving the car? No.

157
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,240
没有许可证不能开车进来
You can't just bring a car on this street without a permit.

158
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,540
我们有停车许可证，这里，瞧？
No, we have a parking permit. Right here. See?

159
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,660
你放在口袋干嘛？
What the hell's it doing in your pocket?!

160
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,460
我是驾驶啊
Well, I'm the driver.

161
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,840
我们在这里租屋
We're renting here. Yeah.

162
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,000
206号
In 206.

163
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,130
那也不代表 你可以把拖车停在门口
That doesn't mean you can back the trailer up to your front door.

164
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,850
其实我只是想路边停车
No, I wasn't. I was, uh, parallel parking.

165
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,020
哪个路边？
Parallel to what?

166
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,350
我停得不是很好，对吧？
Yeah, that, uh, didn't go so well, huh?

167
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,150
我会再试一次
I'll just give it another try.

168
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,360
我的天啊
-Oh, my God.

169
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,990
好吧
Okay.

170
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,660
很好
Good. Good!

171
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,040
继续倒车
Keep backing away. Keep backing away.

172
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,500
再退后一点
Now go away more.

173
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,790
好了，我行的
Okay, I got this.

174
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,380
-先往另一边 -小心点
The other way, but first the other way.

175
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,670
这就对了
-Easy. -Exactamente.

176
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,710
-小心点 -很好
-Easy, easy. -Uh-huh. Good.

177
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,710
不不不，不对！
No. No, no. What? No!

178
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,510
不不不，停下来！
-No, no, no! Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

179
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,470
停下来！下车
-Stop! Stop. Get outta the car.

180
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,680
-下车 -对不起
-Get outta the car. -I'm sorry.

181
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,310
你不会倒车
How you could make it this far through life

182
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,390
怎么能活到现在
without knowing how to back up a trailer.

183
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,400
就连只有一只脚的狗狗 都能停得比你好
My God, a dog with one front paw and cataracts coulda done better than that.

184
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,820
而且是自排车，给我钥匙
And an automatic, of course. Give me the keys.

185
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,530
钥匙在瓶架里
Oh, they're in the cupholder.

186
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,240
要用按键启动
It's a push-button start.

187
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,490
我知道
No, I knew that.

188
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,330
那是什么？
What the hell is that?

189
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,620
那是雷达
Uh, that's the radar.

190
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,960
拖车太靠近汽车了
The trailer's too close to the side of the car.

191
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,830
所以才会哔哔叫
That's why it's still beeping, but--

192
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,960
好吧
Okay.

193
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
你好
Hello.

194
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,050
妳好
Hello.

195
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,590
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

196
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,890
奥托
奥托？

197
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,760

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,100
我是艾比，O-T-T-O

199
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,810
我是露娜
And I'm Luna.

200
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,440
幸会了
Nice to meet you.

201
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,540
他挺厉害的
Oh, that was good, huh?

202
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,960
只试一次就搞定
He just did it in one shot, huh?

203
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,470
-太好了 -谢谢你，先生
-Perfecto! -Thank you, sir.

204
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,720
需要靠雷达才会倒车的人
Anyone who thinks they need to use radar to back up a car

205
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,300
不应该开车
shouldn't be allowed to drive one.

206
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,220
也不应该用收音机
They shouldn't be allowed to use the radio.

207
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,770
我也这么说
That's what I said.

208
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,850
许可证要挂在后照镜 不是放在口袋
And the permit goes on the rear-view mirror. Not in your pocket!

209
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,440
-好啦 -了解
-Okay, okay. -Got it.

210
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,860
-再见，谢谢你 -谢谢，你真好心
-Bye! Thank you! -Thank you, sir. That was very nice.

211
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
白痴
Idiot.

212
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,010

You guys all ready?

213
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
好了
Okay.

214
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,220
很好
All right.

215
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,180
东西要拿好
Bring your stuff, okay?

216
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,100
来吧，亲爱的
Come on, sweeties.

217
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,690
乖女儿，东西要拿好
Chiquitita, take your stuff.

218
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,640
"大师与玛格丽特"

219
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,650
还有几个空书架？
How much more shelf space is left?

220
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,150
三个
Three shelves.

221
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,690
-妳有几箱书？ -七、八箱
-How many more boxes of books do you have? -Seven or eight.

222
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,700
我再替妳做一个书架
"Then I'll build you another bookcase."

223
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,490
我再替妳做一个书架
Then I'll build you another bookcase.

224
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,630
-嗨 -嘿
-Hi. -Hey.

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
嗨，欧托
Hi. Otto.

226
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,300
对吧？
Right? Yes?

227
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,550
是奥托
Otto.

228
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,510
我就是这么说的，不是吗？
Yeah, that's what I said. No? What did I say--?

229
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,390
那不重要，是奥托，O-T-T-O
It doesn't matter what you said. Otto. O-T-T-O.

230
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,730
-欧托 -奥托
-Ah! Otto. -Otto.

231
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,270
哦，欧托，正反的拼法都一样
Otto. Okay, so it's the same forward that is backwards.

232
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,650
-奥托 -是奥托，玛丽
-Otto. -It's Otto, Mari.

233
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,990
这名字很少听到
It's just you don't hear that name very often.

234
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,900
我就常听到
I do.

235
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,200
好吧，要是你在忙，我们再回来
Okay. If we're interrupting, we can always come back.

236
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,490
你们想要什么？
What is it you want?

237
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,660
我带了点吃的
I brought you some food.

238
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,750
为什么？
Why?

239
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,710
你看起来很饿
Because you looked hungry.

240
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,580
所以我们才会这么速配
That's why we go so well together.

241
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,840
她喜欢下厨，我喜欢吃
She loves to cook, and I like to eat everything.

242

我们想正式自我介绍
We wanted to properly introduce ourselves

244

245
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,810
-所以…
-So... -Okay.

我在萨尔瓦多出生，我爸是那里人

00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,720
抱歉没能早点带来
I'm sorry I didn't get 'em here earlier.

307
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,350
我被耽搁了
Got distracted.

308
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,520
认识了新邻居
By some new neighbours.

309
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,280
她老公是笨蛋
Nitwit husband.

310
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,700
连罗赖把都不知道
Didn't even know an Allen wrench from one of the Chipmunks.

311
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,320
当然是租客
Renters, of course.

312
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,620
不用给出承诺
No commitment to anything.

313
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,960
"索妮娅" 我知道，也许他们还买不起房子
I know, I know. Maybe they can't afford to buy yet.

314
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,920
但是如果可恶的建商
But what will they do when those real estate bastards

315
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,340
决定拆掉他们的房子
decide to tear down their house

316
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,220
改建廉价公寓该怎么办？
and put up more of those ricky-ticky condos, huh?

317
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,430
我保证一定会发生
It's gonna happen. I promise you.

318
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,770
他们已经在铁门附近
They're already driving around the gates,

319
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,770
乱开车还开上草地
driving right across the grass.

320
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,730
戴恩美利卡
Dye & Merika.

321
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,780
哪个白痴建商会取这种名字？
What idiot thought that was a good name for a real estate company?

322
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,240
听起来像是"垂死的美国"
Sounds like "dying America."

323
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,450
那倒是真的
It is, of course.

324
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,330
连像样的挂钩都买不到了
Can't even buy a decent screw hook anymore.

325
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,210
绳子也不用英呎计价
Or rope by the foot.

326
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,710
没有妳什么都不对
Nothing works when you're not home.

327
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,450
下一个
Next.

328
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,160
我怀疑你有肥厚性心肌症
I suspect you have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,

329
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,210
那是遗传的心肌…
which is a genetic enlargement of the--

330
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,290
我知道
I know.

331
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,210
我爸也有
My father had it.

332
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,590
你应该能活很久
Well, you'll likely be around a good long time,

333
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,470
但恐怕没办法当兵
but I'm afraid your military prospects end here.

334
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,050
下一个
Next.

335
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,190
一张匹兹堡回程车票
One return ticket to Pittsburgh, please.

336
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,730

That'll be 1.10.

337
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,860
谢谢妳
Thank you.

338
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,870
借过
Coming through.

339
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,180
嘿，妳的书掉了！
Hey, you dropped your book!

340
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,730
小姐，妳的书掉了！
Miss, you dropped your book! Hey!

341
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,070
那是我的书吗？
Is that mine?

342
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,070
什么？
What?

343
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,280
是的 我看到妳掉了，所以就…
-Yes. I saw you dropped it, so I...

344
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,410
"大师与玛格丽特"

345
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,830
真是感谢你
Thank you so much.

346
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,830
我看到一半，很想知道结局
I'm halfway through reading it. I would hate not knowing how it ends.

347
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,880
来吧 坐下来
Oh, here. Why don't you join me?

348
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
我是索妮娅
I'm Sonya.

349
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,760
我是奥托
I'm Otto.

350
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,050
那是我爸的名字
It was my father's name.

351
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,680
我正要去看我爸
I'm on my way to visit my father right now.

352
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,020
每周四都会去
I go every Thursday.

353
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,690
你常搭这班火车吗？
Do you take this train a lot?

354
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,530
没有，我只是来做兵役体检
Oh, no, I had to come into town for my Army physical.

355
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,160
天啊
Oh, God.

356
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,120
不知道会遇上什么一定很难熬
Oh, that must be so hard, not knowing what you're gonna face over there.

357
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,330
你何时会离开
我没有…

358
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,250
还有一阵子
Not for a while.

359
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,800

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,730
你搭错火车了 这是东向车票
I'm afraid you're on the wrong train. This is an eastbound ticket.

363
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,560
我一定是…
I must have, um...

364
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,780
我下一站就下车
I'll get off at the next station.

365
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,070
要补多少钱？
Uh, how much is it?

366
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,240
1.75美元
Uh, $1.75.

367
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,200
1元
One.

368

372
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,160
1964年的硬币
It's 1964.

373
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,530
纯银的
-It's pure silver. -Oh?

374
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,290

Keep it, then. It's lucky.

375
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,330
的确是
Yes, it is.

376
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,620
"谢谢 食物很有意思"

377
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,220
奥托，清晨巡逻有点晚吧
Hey, Otto! A little late for your morning rounds, isn't it?

378
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,180
不会
No.

379
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,010
不会？你不是该去上班吗？
No? Aren't you supposed to be at work?

380
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,100
不用
No.

381
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,440
酷喔，要过来吃午饭吗？
Oh. Cool. You wanna come over for lunch, then?

382
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,270
午饭
-Lunch.

383
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,940
对啊
Yeah.

384
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,610
不，不
No, no.

385
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,570
有兴趣的话今天吃猪里肌肉
Well, it's pork tenderloin, in case you change your mind!

386
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,150
不不不
No, no, no, no.

387
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,370
嘿，不好意思
Hey, excuse me.

388
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,120
就是你
It was you.

389
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,920
这是私人道路，铁门是用来减少车流
This is a private road, and these gates are to keep down the flow of traffic.

390
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,540
不是让白痴驾驶把车开上草地
Not so idiot drivers can go around them and tear up the grass.

391
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,840
被你逮到了，我是建商员工
-Okay. You got me. I'm with Dye & Merika.

392
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,590
我会请管理员来帮你修好
I'm gonna have the groundskeeper come down and fix that up for ya, okay?

393
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,720
比新的更好，祝你愉快
Good as new. Even better. You have a good one now, okay?

394
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,600
规定就是规定
The rules are here for a reason.

395
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,150
我知道你们想干嘛
I know what you guys are up to.

396
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,440
好吧，安德森先生，你说了算
Okay, Mr Anderson. Whatever you say.

397
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,820
继续守望相助
Keep up the neighbourhood watch.

398
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,070
快出来，你这小家伙
-Get out here, you little bugger!

399
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,530
出来啊
Come on. Yeah.

400
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,620
快给我出来！
Get out here!

401
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,750
妳敢再丢一块石头，我就会
You throw one more rock,

402
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,620
把妳的臭狗踢到屋顶
and I swear I'll dropkick that little rat dog of yours right over the roof.

403
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,380
我不是向你家丢石头，那只猫抓伤王子
No, I'm not throwing it at your house. That nasty cat scratched Prince.

404
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,630
我要杀了那只臭猫
I'm gonna kill that piece of shit.

405
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,840
想都别想
No, you're not.

406
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,670
关你什么事？那是只野猫
What do you care? It's feral.

407
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,220
全身上下可能都是病
It's probably full of all sorts of disgusting diseases.

408
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,680
妳也一样，但我不会向妳丢石头
So are you, most likely. I don't throw rocks at you.

409
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,600
安迪
Andy.

410
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,510
怎么了？
-What's up? -Did you hear what he just said this time?

411
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,520
你听到他这次骂我什么吗？

412
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,350
我跟你说过他常骂我
I told you before about how he talks to me.

413
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,520
赶快逃吧
Get outta here while you can.

414
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,810
我不是你的朋友
I'm not your friend.

415
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,570
建商说要把老人家都送到安养院
Dye & Merika said they'll get all the old people on this street into a home.

416
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,980
越快越好！
The sooner the better!

417
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,300
你好 又怎么了？
-Hello. -What now?

418
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,590
我只想把扳手还给你
I just wanted to bring the wrenches back.

419
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,510
我找到家具附上的扳手 恭喜了
-I found one that came with the furniture. -Congratulations.

420
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,470
我为你做了沙波洛
And I made you some salpores de arroz.

421
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,390
巧克力酱炖鸡？
Is that chicken and mole?

422
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,940
不是，这是萨尔瓦多饼干，我爸的最爱
No. These are Salvadoran cookies. They were my father's favourite, so...

423
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,810
很好吃喔，你一定会超爱
They're delicious. You're gonna love 'em.

424
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,270
对啊，因为是我做的
Yes, because I made them.

425
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,530
另外我也想向你借梯子
Also, Otto, I was wondering if you have a ladder I can borrow.

426
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,940
我们的窗户卡住了
Our window is jammed.

427
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,570
你为什么需要梯子？
Why do you need a ladder?

428
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,820
是上面的窗户
Well, it's the one up there.

429
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,370
打不开
It won't open.

430
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,950
你想试着从外面打开？
And you're gonna try to open it from the outside?

431
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,290
对，没错
Yeah. Right.

432
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,040
我去穿大衣
I'll get my coat.

433
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,540
好，谢谢你
Okay. Thank you.

434
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,340
我喜欢他挥手的样子
I like how his hands are waving.

435
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,130
把手插上去
Let's put the arm in.

436
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,550
-太好了 -安妮塔
-Good. -Anita.

437
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:20,180
奥托，打扰一下，我们的暖气坏了
Uh, Otto, hate to bother you, but, um, we don't have any heat.

438
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,720
能不能来看看？
Could you come take a look?

439
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,230
试试替散热器排水
Try bleeding your radiators.

440
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,650
我该怎么做？
How would I go about that?

441
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,020
替散热器排水
By bleeding the radiators.

442
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,030
奥托，别这么难搞
Otto. Don't be rude.

443
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,730
我没有难搞
I wasn't being rude.

444
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,320
有时候很难看得出来
Well, it's hard to tell the difference sometimes with Otto.

445
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,410
是啊
Yeah.

446
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,660
对了，我们才刚搬进206号
By the way, we, uh, just moved to 206.

447
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,960
-我是玛丽索 -我是汤米
-I'm Marisol. -I'm Tommy.

448
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,130
-欢迎 -幸会了
-Welcome, honey. -Nice meeting you.

449
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,290
我是安妮塔
I'm Anita.

450
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,340
我老公鲁本以前负责处理暖气
My husband, Reuben, is the one who used to handle the heat.

451
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,670
但我们知道总有一天
-Okay. -But we always knew a day would come

452
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,550
他会没办法处理这些事情
when he wouldn't be able to handle things around the house any longer.

453
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,310
鲁本把我踢出管委会时应该先想到
Maybe Reuben should have thought of that when he organised his coup.

454
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,020
那是很久以前的事
That was a long time ago.

455
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,270
踢出管委会？
A coup?

456
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,360
那是个误会
It was a misunderstanding.

457
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,520
他把我踢出去
It was a coup.

458
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,660
奥托，快去帮安妮塔替散热器排气
Otto, can't you just go breathe Anita's radiators for her?

459
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,530
不，不能替散热器排气
No. Because you don't breathe radiators.

460
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,660
要替散热器排水
You bleed them.

461
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,750
-看看这块坡道 -那是索妮娅的
-Honey, look at this ramp. -That's Sonya's.

462
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,910
-拉拖车时就需要 -放下来
-This is what we needed for the trailer. -Put that down.

463
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,830
放下来！谁说你能碰它？
Put that down! Who said you could touch that?!

464
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,170
-对不起 -你们全都给我滚
-Sorry. -All of you get outta here. Go, go.

465
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,090
拿了梯子就滚，全都给我滚
Take your ladder and go. Get outta here. All of you.

466
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,550
-好啦 -谢谢你
-Okay. -Thank you.

467
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,930
-谢谢你 -小心
Watch out.

468
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,680
好了
-Right. Right.

469
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,810
-谢谢你
-Thank you! -Thank you!

470
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,150
不行，你在这里干嘛？
No. What are you doing in here?

471
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,110
你怎么会躲到里面？
How did you get in here? Come on.

472
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,610
快滚！给我出去
Come on. Go! Get outta there.

473
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,740
出去，出去
No, get out. Get out of there.

474
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,830
快滚啊
Come on, go.

475
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,620
嘿
-Hey.

476
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,500
放开！
Let go!

477
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,380
放开
-Let go.

478
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,550
你敢抓伤我，我就咬你
You scratch me, I'll bite you.

479
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,060
学会教训了吧
-That'll teach you.

480
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,600
蠢猫
Stupid cat.

481
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,690
-嗨，奥托
-Hi, Otto!

482
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,450
-O-T-T-O.
O-T-T-O

483
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
奥托
Otto. Um...

484
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,880
我去年八月借水管给妳
I loaned you my garden hose last August.

485
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,050
只要还给我，我就帮妳替暖气排水
If you give it back to me, I'll bleed your radiators for you.

486
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,850
进来吧
Come in.

487
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:19,990
你的新邻居看起来人很好，对吧？
So those new neighbours of yours, they seem quite lovely, don't you think?

488
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
好到不行
Lovely.

489
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,620
你可能很快就会有更多邻居了
Yeah, well, you may have some more new neighbours soon enough.

490
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,120
建商的人告诉我们…
The realty people, they've been telling us...

491
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,460
我和鲁本必须搬走
Reuben and I have to move out.

492
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,500
那全是屁话
No, that's a load of crap.

493
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,300
这房子是你们的
They don't own this house. You do.

494
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,050
我也是这么说
Yeah, well, that's what I said.

495
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,590
他们找上我们的儿子克里斯
They, uh, have been talking to our boy, Chris.

496
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,800
他说我照顾不了鲁本
Now he's saying that I can no longer take care of Reuben,

497
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,020
必须把他送去护理之家
that he needs to be in a special care place.

498
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,850
我也应该搬去安养院
And I should move into a retirement home.

499
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,980
克里斯懂什么？他是个白痴
What does Chris know about it? He's an idiot. He always has been.

500
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,980
他们不能逼妳做任何事
They can't make you do anything.

501
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,070
他知道我们在这里吗？
Does he even know we're here?

502
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,070
当然知道
Of course he does.

503
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,950
别被他骗了
Don't let him fool you.

504
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,080
他头脑很清楚
He's still in there.

505
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
我去拿你的水管
Let me go find your hose.

506
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,400
这整个社区就快完蛋了
The whole neighbourhood is falling apart these days.

507
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,650
就连管委会都没有了
They don't even have a homeowners' association anymore.

508
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,160
没有人管理社区的事
No one left to keep things running.

509
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,370
不像我们以前那样
Not like we did.

510
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,880
我得把话说清楚
Now, just to be clear...

511
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,670
我还没原谅你
I still haven't forgiven you.

512
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,430
我只是没想到你病得这么快
I just didn't realise you would fall to shit so quickly.

513
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,720
现在…
Now...

514
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,520
他们要毁了我们努力建立的家园
they're tearing apart everything we worked so hard to build.

515
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,900
我都还没走，他们就想把我们赶走
I haven't even left yet, and they're trying to erase us.

516
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,360
我不会留下来看到那种事发生
Well, I am not staying around to see that happen.

517
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,530
我要走了
I'm leaving.

518
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,030
永远离开
-For good. -You ready for lunch?

519
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,280
午饭准备好了吗？

520
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,120
-我做了你爱吃的奶油玉米
I'm making that creamed corn you like.

521
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
-谢谢妳
Oh, thank you.

522
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,960
谢谢你，奥托，抱歉拖了这么久
Thank you, Otto. I'm sorry it took so long to give it back.

523
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,420
一起吃午饭？
Um, you wanna stay for lunch?

524
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,290
安妮塔做了猪里肌肉
Yeah, Anita made a pork tenderloin.

525
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,540
不了，我有很多事要做
No, I have a lot of things I have to do.

526
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,170
鲁本，你在干嘛？
Reuben, what are you doing, hon?

527
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,340
-放手 -你在干嘛？
-Let go. -What are you doing?

528
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,350
-放手 -鲁本
-Let go. -Reuben. Reuben.

529
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,430
放…你在干嘛？
-Let... -What are you doing?

530
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,350
…手
...go.

531
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,160
天啊
Oh, man.

532
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,760
试试从里头打开
Try opening it from the inside a little.

533
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,560
比我想像的更高
It's higher than I thought.

534
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,230

零件怎么运作来驱动车子
What each part does to make a car run smoothly.

574
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,590
那比一般人想得更复杂
It's more complicated than people realise.

575
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,670
化油器得先混和汽油和空气
A carburettor has to mix gas and air in just the right combination,

580
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,020
我爸教的
From my father.

581
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,350
我们只会聊车子，他是个好爸爸
It's all we really talked about. He was a good dad.

00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:11,730
非常可靠

00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:21,950
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

587
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:25,740

588
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,290
我不太记得她
Don't remember her much.

589
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,460

00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,430

Why didn't you get an entrée?

591
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,890
我在家吃过了
I ate at home.

592
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,810
为什么？
Why?

593
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,400
好让妳想点什么就点什么
So you could order whatever you wanted.

594
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,990
听着，我骗了妳
Look, I lied to you.

595
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,910
对不起
I'm sorry.

596
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,790
我体检没过，没能入伍
I'm not in the Army. I couldn't pass my physical.

597
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,290
我本来指望入伍就会有工作，但是…
If I had, at least I'd have a job now, which is what I was counting on.

598
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,130
并没有
But I don't.

599
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,920
我不知道我要做什么
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

600
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,880
我该走了
I should go.

601
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,280
奥托！
Otto!

602
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,450
奥托！
Otto!

603
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,500
我来了
I'm coming.

604
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,080
我来了
I'm coming!

605
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,840
干嘛？妳又要什么？
What? What do you want?

606
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,050
-你在这里干嘛？ -妳又在干嘛？
-What are you doing here? -What are you doing?

607
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,050
-我在找你 -妳找到我了
-I'm looking for you. -Well, you found me.

608
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,680
你能不能带我去医院？

Tommy fell off the ladder, and the ambulance just took him away.

Well, you can drive yourself in that imported toaster you call a car.

611
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,230
我没有驾照
I don't have a licence.

612
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,940
-妳几岁了？ -30岁
-How old are you? -Huh? Thirty.

613
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,940
妳没有驾照？
And you don't have a driver's licence?

614

615
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,570
只是一直没学会其他的
I just never got to the other parts.

616

So are you gonna drive me to the hospital, or are you gonna make me take a bus?

621
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,800
-我载妳去医院 -谢谢你
-I will drive you to the hospital. -Thank you.

有那么难吗？
Was it so hard?

623
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,510

他们是摔角手
Um, Luchador are wrestlers. Yeah.

633

-摔角手 -我找到熊先生的童书
Wrestlers.

634
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,810

635
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,440
她要你念给她听
She wants you to read to her.

636
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,730
没错
Exactly.

637
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,030
你在吗，熊宝宝？
"Are You There, Baby Bear?

638
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,160
你在吗，熊宝宝？熊先生问
'Are you there, Baby Bear?' Mr Bear says.

639
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,740
我的熊宝宝在哪里
'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear.'"

640
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,740
不是啦，你要学熊讲话
No, talk like a bear.

641
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,410
熊不会讲话
Bears don't talk.

642
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,870
这只熊会
Um, this one does.

643
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,420
我的熊宝宝在哪里？
"'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear?'

644
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,350
熊宝宝，你是不是在树上？
'Are you there, Baby Bear, up in that tree?'"

645
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,350
不是，那是一只猫头鹰！
-No, it's an owl!

646
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:23,270
这里没有别人，只有宝宝和我
"'There's nobody here but baby and me.'

647
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,200
熊宝宝，你在地底下吗？
'Are you there, Baby Bear, deep underground?'"

648
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,080
我不是熊宝宝
I'm no Baby Bear.

649
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,660
我是贝波！
I'm Beppo!

650
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,200
嗨，贝波！
-Hi, Beppo!

00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,120
-想要看我变魔术吗？ -想！

652
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,750
我正在念故事给她们听
Actually, I was reading to them.

653
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:46,130
我正在念故事给她们听，熊先生说
"Actually, I was reading to them," Mr Bear grumbled.

654
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,260
熊先生，可以借我个硬币吗？
Say, could I borrow a coin, Mr Bear?

655
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,180
好啦，拜托

660
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,830
小丑装不是他的，是医院的
He doesn't even own the costume. That's owned by the hospital.

661
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,420
他得赔钱给医院
He's gonna have to pay for that.

662
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,380
贝波带来欢乐，他自愿当志工
Beppo means happiness. He volunteers his time to be here.

663
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,210
奥托，你做了什么？

664
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,300
没什么
Nothing.

665
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,880
奥托阿公打了小丑
Abuelo Otto hit the clown.

666
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,840

全都是那小丑的错
It was all the clown's fault.

-Thank you. -Hang on.

679
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,930
这不是我的硬币
This isn't my quarter.

680
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,390
从你耳朵出来的，是你的问题
Well, it came from your ear, sir, so that's a you problem.

681
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,060

682
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,600
不不不，这不是你的硬币
"No, no, no. This is not your quarter."

683
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,770
听好，我给你个硬币，我说你一定要还给我
Look. I gave you a quarter that I said I needed back.

684
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,070
-你要一块钱？ -你偷偷换掉
-You want a dollar? -And you switched them on me.

685
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,820
-瞒天过海 -你给我这个硬币
-The ol' switcheroo. -You gave me this quarter.

686
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,490
奥托会有麻烦吗?
Is Otto going to get in trouble?

687
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,280
-只是个硬币 -并不是
-It's just a quarter. -No, it's not.

688
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,700
-这是铜的 -拜托不要报警
-Do you see the copper? -He's not calling the coppers.

我给你一个1964年硬币，还给我！
-I gave you a 1964 quarter. -Please calm down.

00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,710
放开那个小丑！先生，先生！

哈！1964年
A-ha! 1964.

696
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,180

Where's my toy?

00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,720

It's in your backpack.

我爸以前也会这么笑

我没在笑
I'm not smiling.

00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,190
没错
Exactly.

703
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,990
你不应该对小丑发脾气
You should never be mean to a clown.

704
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,200
-妳老公不来吗？ -看啊！

705
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,780
-大伙儿 -妈，他在那儿

麻烦把车开去接他
Pull the car up please, so we pick him up.

707
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,160
奥托！

Let's go.

714
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,770
看看你的新腿，好像机器人喔
Look at your new leg! They look like a robot leg.

715
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,080
奥托！
Otto!

716
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,670
天啊，牠死了吗？
Oh, my God, is he dead?

717
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,800
没啦，牠大概在睡觉
No, he's probably sleeping.

718
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,180
奥托，别走，拜托把牠抱出来
Otto. No, no, no, please. Please. Please. Take him out. Please.

719
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,140
不要，妳怎么不抱？
No, why can't you?

720
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,270
我怀孕了，不能碰猫，牠身上有虫
Because I'm pregnant. I cannot handle the cats because I can get the toxo thing.

721
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,730
牠自己跑进去，也能自己出来
Well, he got himself in there. He can get himself out of there.

722
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,230
你为什么这么难搞？
Why are you like that?

723
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:33,690
我不会抱猫
I'm not good with cats.

724
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,400
老兄，怎么了？
Hey, man. What's going on?

725
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,740

我们要帮你取暖
We gotta warm you up, buddy!

728
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,490
是啊，小心点
Oh, yeah. Oh, be careful.

729
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,910
噢，糟了
Oh, no.

730
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,410
我抱住你了
-Oh, I've got you.

731
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,080
-牠好冰冷喔 -天啊
He's so cold.

732
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,500
要带牠去哪？
Where do we go?

733
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,630
不行，牠身上有虫，奥托
-No. But no. Toxo. Otto. -Oh.

734
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,130
走吧，我抱住你了
Okay, let's go. I've got you now.

735
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:56,670
奥托，开门
Otto. Open the door.

736
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,300
没事了，小猫咪
Oh, it's all right, buddy.

737
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,470
-不会有事的 -真可怜
-It's gonna be okay, chiquitito. -Poor guy.

738
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,300
没事了
Okay. You're okay.

739
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,470
-地板全是雪 -抱歉
-Snow all over my floor. -Oh, sorry.

740
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,810
天啊，屋子里头好冷喔
Oh, my God, it's so freezing here.

741
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,100
这一件呢？
-不行 -能不能…？

742
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,690
别碰那件大衣
No, no. Don't touch that coat. It'll stay here.

743
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:18,070
-能不能拿条毯子？ -给那只猫？
-Okay. Can you please bring a blanket? -For the cat?

744
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,990
没关系，我行的 你在干嘛？
-It's okay. I got this. -What are you doing?

745
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,490
帮牠取暖啊，我的体温很高
Oh, body heat works wonders. I've got plenty of body and heat.

746
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,240
我去打开烤箱
I'm gonna turn on the oven.

747
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,750
不准把猫放进我的烤箱
You are not putting that cat in my oven.

748
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,750
我只想让屋子暖起来
No, I'm just trying to get some heat in the house.

749
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,050
流理台好低喔，哪里买的？
Your counters are so low. Where did you get them?

750

我做的
I built them.

751
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,300
替我太太索妮娅量身打造
For Sonya. For my wife.

752
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,100
她也很矮吗？
Ah. Is she short too?

753
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,310
索妮娅去世了
Sonya passed away.

754
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,520
她的厨艺很棒，对吧？
She was a great cook though, wasn't she?

755
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,230
我以前常常来蹭饭
I used to eat here all the time.

756
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,950
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

757
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,370
请你们离开，
Well, can you go now?

758
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,080

I have things to do.

759

见到你真好
Well, it was great seeing ya, as usual.

You are.

762

艾比想要画她的新邻居

那是你
That's you.

815

她总是把你画成彩色的
She always draws you in colour.

816
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,350
"总是"是什么意思？
What do you mean, "always"?

817
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,600
我有个好主意
I have a very good idea.

你可以当我的驾驶教练

不要

No, no, no.

821

放心，我会付油钱
But don't worry, I'll pay for the gas and everything.

827
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,420
牠真的很不喜欢这样
-He really doesn't like this.

828
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,170
把牠放出来
Let him out of the box.

829
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,050
好，抱歉，小兄弟
Okay. Sorry, buddy.

830
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,180
你在想什么？带他去散步？
What do you think you were doing? Taking him for a walk?

831
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,390
我忘了我对猫过敏，得把牠带回来
Well, I had to bring him back. I forgot that I'm allergic.

832
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:23,480
所以…
-So...

833
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,350

834
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,520
我涂了燕麦，但没有帮助
I put oatmeal on it, and it didn't help at all.

835
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:32,900
跟我来，汤米去年有条药膏
You know what, you come with me. Tommy has a prescription from last year.

836

-He found a wasp's nest. -Are you sure?

837
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,700
-我不想麻烦妳 -没关系，别抓了
-I don't want to be a bother. -It's okay.

838
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,780
我应该多抓一下
-Don't scratch. -I feel like I should scratch a little.

839
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,330
嘿，这只猫呢？
Hey, hey, what about the cat?

840
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,200
牠是你的了，奥托
Uh, looks like he's yours now, Otto.

841

比我想像的更困难
It's been harder than I thought to...

847
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,180
现在牠又搬进来
And now he's moved in.

848
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,970

我得先想办法处理牠

当服务生或加油站员工才是工作

她是第一个叫我新名字的人

01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:09,530
我只开过自排车
Because I've only ever driven automatic.

920
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,570
不行
No.

921
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,660
我要教妳怎么开车，上车
I'm teaching you how to drive. Get in.

922
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,460
前面是红灯，妳得刹车
Now, coming up on the red light. You're going to have to stop.

923
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,380
我得踩离合器，对吧？
Okay, but I get the clutch, right?

924
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,300
先踩离合器再踩刹车
You get the clutch and then press in on the brake.

925
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,470
-踩刹车或离合器？ -踩离合器
-Do I hit the brake or the clutch? -No, keep the clutch in.

926
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,470
先踩刹车再踩离合器
Put in the brake, I put the clutch.

927
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,470
先踩离合器，现在踩刹车
Clutch and brake. And now brake.

928
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,390
刹车，刹车
-Brake. Brake. -No. No.

929
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:38,980
别对我大叫 我没对妳大叫
-Don't shout at me. -I am not shouting at you.

930
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,270
我踩离合器了
Clutch in. It's in, it's in!

931
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,230
我们要停车，然后…
We're going to stop, and...

932
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:45,650
先踩离合器再踩刹车，踩刹车
Clutch in, and brake. Brake. Brake. Brake.

933
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:48,610
他停车了，别撞上去，刹车刹车
The car is stopped. Don't hit the car! Brake, brake!

934
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:50,780
好了，放手
Yes. All right, let go.

935
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,370
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

936
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,450
刹车
Brake.

937
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,410
先踩离合器再踩刹车
It's clutch and brake.

938
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:58,580
我逊毙了
I suck at this.

939
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,540
-逊毙了 -妳还在学
-I suck. -You're learning.

940
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,960
我差点撞到它，只差一点点
Oh, my God, I almost hit the car. It's like this.

941
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,090
没关系啦，那是台油电车
It doesn't matter. It's a hybrid.

942
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:08,380
那是台油电车
It's a hybrid, okay.

943
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:11,430
-我该倒车 -不用
-Okay, I should move back. -No, no, no. No.

944
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:13,760
-没关系 -我差点撞到它
-You're fine right where you are. -But I'm very close.

945
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,930
-无所谓 -不必倒车吗？
-Doesn't matter. -I don't need to go back?

946
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:17,850
先等绿灯
-Just wait for the green light.

947
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,600
走吧，先踩离合器
And here we go. So press in on the clutch.

948
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,730
再踩油门
And give it a little gas.

949
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,150
慢慢松开离合…
Slowly let out on the clu--

950
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,440
妳没有入档
Oh, you're not in gear.

951
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,030
绿灯！
Green!

952
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,910
先踩离合器再换档…不必转动钥匙
Press in on the clutch, shift into fi-- You don't have to turn the key.

953
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:34,410

先松开离合器再踩油门
-Slowly let out the clutch,

956
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:40,700
我办不到
-then press the gas. -I can't do this.

957
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,960
-就这么简单 -我办不到
-That is all you have to do. -I can't do this.

958
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,880
不要，奥托
No, Otto. Otto, no.

959
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,840
什么？
What?

960
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,630
哦，可恶
Oh, shit.

961
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:50,920
你有什么毛病？
What is wrong with you?

962
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:53,300
她正在学开车
She's learning how to drive.

963
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,430
你不必学开车吗？
Did you not have to learn how to drive?

964
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:58,680
冷静点，老头儿 嘿
Calm down, old man. Hey, hey.

965
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,140
我不是老头儿！王八蛋！
I'm not your old man! You son of a bitch!

966
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,520
你敢再按一次喇叭
If you honk that horn one more time,

967
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,400
你就死定了，听到吗？
it'll be the last thing you do. You hear me? Huh?

968
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:09,820
了解吗？
¿Comprende?

969
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,320
噢，惨了
Oh, shit.

970
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,410
妳给我听好
Now you listen to me.

971
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,700
妳生过两个小孩，就快生第三个
You have given birth to two children. Soon it'll be three.

972
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:26,630
妳从很远的国家来到这里
You have come here from a country very far away.

973
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,290
学会新的语言
You learned a new language,

974
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,880
上学念书，嫁了个笨老公
you got yourself an education and a nitwit husband

975
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,050
妳把全家照顾得好好的
and you are holding that family together.

976
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:35,630
学会开车绝对没问题
You will have no problem learning how to drive.

977
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,890
天啊，世上有一大堆白痴
My God, the world is full of complete idiots

978
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,140
都能学会开车 妳又不是白痴
who have managed to figure it out, and you are not a complete idiot.

979
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,140
所以…

01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:48,310

太好了
Que bueno.

986
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,550
这是个停车位
Okay, there's a spot right there.

987
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:19,890
练习路边停车
Just pull up, parallel,

988
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,850
先倒车，直到保险杆和照后镜对齐
and back the car up until that bumper is in line with your side-view mirror.

989
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:25,930
"史丹格烘焙店"

990
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,270
现在打直
Now straighten out.

991
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,900
把车子倒进路边
Back up all the way up to the curb.

992
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,650
-向前一点 -再向前一点
-A little bit. -Well, a little bit.

993
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,780
然后停车
And stop.

994
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:37,860
打N档
Neutral.

995
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,280
拉手刹车
-Brake.

996
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:41,370
车钥匙
Key.

997
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,620
就这样？
Is that it?

998
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,750
就这样
That's it.

999
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,580
时间刚刚好
-And we're right on time.

1000
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:51,840
我来吧
I have it.

1001
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,670
这些是萨姆拉面包
-These are semlors.

1002
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:00,800
瑞典的闪电泡芙
-Swedish éclairs. -Oh!

1003
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,890
小心会爆浆
They're a little messy.

1004
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,180
吃吃看吧
-But let's try. -Yes.

1005
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,310
用手指拿
With your finger.

1006
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,320
你怎么找到这地方？
How did you find this place?

1007
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:18,650
这是索妮娅的爱店
This was Sonya's place.

1008
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:23,580
我们以前每周六下午一点都会来
We used to come here every Saturday at- 00.

1009
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,410
然后做什么？
And then? What?

1010
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,250
两点钟回家
Go home at- 00.

1011
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,540
我会洗车打蜡
I'd wash and wax the car,

1012
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:37,170
她会改考卷做饭，然后看一整天的书
and she would grade her papers and cook and spend the rest of the day reading.

1013
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,090
什么样的书？
What kind of books?

1014
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,340
她的书
-Her books.

1015
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,510
我尝试看过，但是…
I tried to read some of them, but...

1016
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
我就是…
I'm just...

1017
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,520
我不爱看书
I'm not into books.

1018
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,100
她朋友说我们天差地远
Her friends said that we were like night and day.

1019
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:57,690
我遇见索妮娅之前的人生是黑白的
My life was black-and-white before I met Sonya.

1020
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,900
她增添了色彩
She was the colour.

1021
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:04,990
我一定会喜欢她
I would have liked her.

1022
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,370
她真的很有个性
She was a force of nature.

1023
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:10,620
说服学校为需要辅导的学生
She convinced the school to start up a programme

1024
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,250
特地开一门课
for the kids that needed extra help.

1025
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:14,540
很多孩子家庭有问题
A lot of kids had problems at home

1026
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:17,710
或是不善于社交
or, uh, social anxieties.

1027
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,090
但经过索妮娅的辅导
But by the time Sonya was done with 'em,

1028
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,760
他们都会读莎翁
they were reciting Shakespeare.

1029
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,100
我遇到她以前的学生…
I ran into one of her students,

1030
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,350
就在前几天
just the other day.

1031
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:35,230
他叫马尔坎
A kid named Malcolm.

1032
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:42,910
-妳需要奶精
You need more cream.

1033
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:44,200
-好
Okay.

1034
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:52,210
我们刚搬去的时候相处得很融洽
We all got along fine, of course, when we first moved in.

1035
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,290
就像天赐的礼物
It was like a gift.

1036
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,250
欢迎搬进这个社区
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

1037
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,340
-嗨，我是索妮娅 -我是安妮塔
-Hi, I'm Sonya. -I'm Anita.

1038
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,010
索妮娅和安妮塔是闺蜜
Sonya and Anita were best friends.

1039
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,010
我拿着罗赖把
So I got my Allen keys...

1040
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:05,510
我和鲁本其实很像
And Reuben and I were a lot alike.

1041
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:06,930
骑慢一点！
Hey! Slow down!

1042
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,890
各方面都很像
About most things.

1043
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,640
白痴
Idiot.

1044
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,480
但人都会变
But people change.

1045
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,270
或是不会变
Or they don't change.

1046
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:18,230
世事无常，我们越来越疏远
Things happen. People drift apart.

1047
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:21,940
筑起心墙，他们不高兴
They build walls. They take offence.

1048
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:23,360
"福特"

1049
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,740
我们都知道原因
Who knows why.

1050
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:30,240
也许建商一直盖房子把大家逼疯
Maybe it was all the construction that drove everybody crazy.

1051
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,210
那个山丘上本来有一座树林
You know, there used to be a forest up on that hill.

1052
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,330
所以才命名桦木社区
That's why they call it Birchwood.

1053
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,330
后来他们加盖公寓
Then they started building all those condos

1054
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,670
砍光桦木
and cut down all the birches.

1055
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:41,670
我们开始抗议他们才知道做了什么
They didn't even realise what they were doing until we told them,

1056
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,760
我和鲁本
Reuben and I.

1057
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,010
这是在他把你踢走之前？
But this was before the coup?

1058
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,850
对啊，我和鲁本当时还是朋友
Oh, yeah, yeah. Reuben and I were friends then.

1059
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:51,470
后来我们就意见不合
After that, all we saw were the differences.

1060
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,190
"福特"

1061
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:06,110
"雪佛兰"

1062
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,290
"福特"

1063
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,460
"雪佛兰"

1064
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:26,720
几年后，他们的儿子克里斯去日本工作
A few years later, their son, Chris, he, uh, took a job in Japan,

1065
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,340
后来他再也没回来看他们
and I don't think he's been back to visit them since.

1066
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:32,510
他和鲁本一直处不来
-Oh. -Reuben and he never did get along.

1067
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,190
于是我就决定放下前嫌
Anyway, that's when I decided to bury the hatchet.

1068
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,270
鲁本
Reuben.

1069
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,310
嘿
Hey.

1070
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,150
前阵子索妮娅给我这瓶酒
Sonya gave me this a while back.

1071

没机会打开来喝

想看我的新车吗？
Hey, would you like to see my new car?

01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:25,190
奥托！
Otto!

1084
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:31,030
我不知道他是怎么了，但我失去了他
I don't know what went wrong with Reuben, but that's when I knew I'd lost him.

1085
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:33,280
我得捍卫我相信的事
I mean, a man has to stand up for what he believes in.

1086
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:36,040
就算是一台福特汽车
Even if it is an F-O-R-D.

1087

你和索妮娅想过要生小孩吗？

我今晚想请你帮忙
I was wondering if you could help us out tonight.

我和汤米在宝宝出生前
Me and Tommy don't get a lot of time to go out for dinner

1093
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:07,990
很少出去吃晚饭
before the baby comes.

1094
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,400
我才不会载你们去约会
I'm not gonna drive you two around on a date.

1095
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:13,870
不用啦，我们会叫计程车
No. We're gonna take a cab.

1096
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,700
那妳要我帮什么忙？
What do you need me for, then?

1097
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,410
妈，我没拿！
-Mama, I did not! Why would I? -Yes, you did!

1098
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,960
才怪！还给我！
-Give it back! -You gotta catch me!

1099
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,710
-来抓我啊 -够了，别再吵了
You guys, por favor.

1100
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,760
妳们要学会分享一切
And learn to share your everything.

1101
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,640
我不确定耶
I'm not sure about this.

1102
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,720
别傻了，这会很好玩
No. Don't be silly. It's gonna be very fun.

1103
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,600
请记住，艾比九点得上床
If you remember, Abbie has to be in bed by- 00, okay?

1104
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:41,730

-You're good?

1105
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,860
警报器密码是4491
So, alarm code, 4491. 4491.

1106
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:50,110
我要设定为防盗模式 你有在专心看吗？
I'm setting it to "Armed Stay." Are you paying attention?

1107
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:51,820
你想出去只要按这个按钮
So if you wanna go out,

1108
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,160
就能解除警报器
you just have to press this button here, and it's disalarmed.

1109
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,990
我会待在屋里
I'll be right here.

1110
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,330
是喔，好吧
Right. Yeah.

1111
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:01,660
以防万一
Well, you never know.

1112
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,500
-对奥托阿公好一点
Be good to Abuelo Otto please, okay?

1113
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,710
-会啦！
We will!

1114
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,630
我没看到巧克力牛奶
I don't see chocolate milk in here.

1115
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:14,470
要加巧克力酱，但加太多她会睡不着
You make it with the syrup. But not too much. It'll keep her awake.

1116
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,930
牛奶给我
Give me milk.

1117
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,260
那是什么？
What is that?

1118
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:22,230
一点都没用的洗碗机
That's the goddamn useless dishwasher.

1119
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,480
爸爸说他想把它丢出窗户
Dad said he wanted to throw it out the window,

1120
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,980
但妈妈说爸爸不准再开窗户
but Mom said Dad isn't allowed to open windows anymore.

1121

1132
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:03,230
我觉得这不是好主意
I don't think this is a good idea.

1133
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,520
为什么？
Why?

1134
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,480
因为没人打得赢摔角手
Because no one stands a chance against a luchadoro.

1135
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,980
摔角手阿公！

哇，好安静喔
Wow, it's awfully quiet, huh?

1144
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:10,630
大伙儿
-Hey, guys.

很好啊
-Fine. -You did a good job tonight, Otto.

1150
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,310
你今晚做得很棒，奥托

1151
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:24,930
用这个拍拍你的背
You should pat yourself on the back.

1152
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:36,360
-谢谢你，奥托 -不客气

好吧
Okay.

1156

他怎么办到的？
How did he do that?

1157
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,180
-嗨，奥托 -马尔坎
-Hi, Otto. -Malcolm.

1158
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:11,020
换档的时候听不到落链声吗？
You can't hear your chain rattle when you switch gears like that?

1159
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,650
-太旧了 -别怪脚踏车
-My bike's getting old. -Don't blame the bike.

1160
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,650
只要调整拨链器
You just have to adjust your derailleur.

1161
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,530
-什么？ -你要调整拨链器
-My what? -Your derailleur needs adjusting.

1162
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,990
不好意思

我在找奥托安德森

1166
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,420
妳确定要找他？
Are you sure you wanna do that?

1167
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,090
太棒了，真是不可思议
Wow. It's great. That's amazing.

1168

1170
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,470
谢了，奥托
Thanks, Otto.

1171
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,770
我竟然帮你丢垃圾到别人家的草坪
I can't believe I'm helping you throw crap onto people's lawns.

1172
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,190
打两份工不够吗？
Isn't two jobs enough?

1173
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,860
我在存钱买车子
I'm saving up for a car.

1174
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,280

Volkswagen.

1177
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,710
小姐，妳挡住车库了
Young lady, you're blocking the garage.

1178
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:16,960
安德森先生？我是雪莉肯锡
Mr Anderson? My name is Shari Kenzie.

1179
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,550
我是社群媒体记者，我…
I'm a social media journalist, and I--

1180
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,960
那是什么？
What is that?

1181
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:24,640
我有个网路节目叫"日常英雄"
I have an online series called Everyday Heroes.

1182
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,720
你那天在火车站真的很勇敢

你救了那个人

1184
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:30,640
妳找错人了
You have the wrong guy.

1185
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:35,400
并没有，我看过影片十几次
No, I don't. I've watched the video at least a dozen times.

1186
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,940
-就是你 -影片？
-It's you. -Video?

1187
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,360
你还没看过？
You haven't seen it?

1188
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,150
有个通勤族拍下来放上网路
Oh. A commuter recorded what happened on their phone and posted it online.

1189
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,950
留言区有人认得你，我这才找到你
Someone in the comments recognised you. That's how I tracked you down.

1190
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,950
影片有一百多万人次观看
It's gotten over a million views.

1191
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:49,790
一百万？一百万
A million? A million.

1192
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:52,160
他们为什么要多管闲事？
Why can't people mind their own business?

1193
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:55,620
因为你的故事激励人心
Because stories like yours are inspiring.

1194
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,840
我只想跟你聊一下…
If I could just talk to you for a few minutes--

1195
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,340
不行，我有太多事情要做
No, now I've got too many things I have to do.

1196
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,710
我拍下你救的人的影片
I recorded a video message from the man you saved.

1197
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,920
你应该看看
You should see this.

1198
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:06,050
-奥托 -让我找出来
-Um... just pull it up. -Otto! Hi!

1199
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,050
早安

1200
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:09,970
早安
Good morning.

1201
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,310
准备再教我开车吗？
-So you ready for another driving lesson?

1202
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,310
-现在不方便 -是吗？
-Now's not a good time. -No?

1203
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,610
有人吗？我还在里面！
Hello? Hello? Hey, I'm still in here!

1204
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,400
-我没把妳锁起来 -有人吗？
-I didn't lock you in. -Hello?

1205
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,690
转一下把手就能开门
Turn the knob, open the door.

1206
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,070
妳有开过门吧？
-Opened a door before, haven't you?

1207
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,160
白痴
Idiot.

1208
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,950
奥托！是我
Otto! It's me.

1209
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,120
她走了
She's gone.

1210
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,500
很好，我还没巡逻完
Good. I'm not through with my rounds.

1211
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,960
社群媒体记者？
"Social media journalist"?

1212
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,500
那是什么意思？
What the hell does that even mean?

1213
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,420
一群笨蛋拿着手机自拍
Buncha knotheads pointin' a camera at themselves.

1214
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:47,180
你处理得很好
I thought you handled it really well.

1215
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,300
把她关进你的车库
I mean, closing her in your garage.

1216
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:53,020
那一招真的很赞
That was, like, excellent strategy.

1217
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,890
好样的
-Good job.

1218
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,110
奥托，我在想，你帮了我们这么多
Otto, also, I was thinking you've done so much for us.

1219
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,110
-我想为你做点事 -不需要
-I wanna do something for you too. -I don't need anything.

1220
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:08,950
你可以吃好一点，有时候
Well, I think you could do with some decent food. Sometimes. No?

1221
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,120
-那些饼干…
Those cookies...

1222
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,740
-沙波洛？
The what? The "salporanz"?

1223
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,200
那些不错吃，还不错
Those are not bad. They're not bad.

1224
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,410
我也在想
And, also, I was thinking

1225
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,920
我可以帮你清理家里和玄关
that I can help you clean out your house and clean out the front hall in your home,

1226
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,380
帮你打包索妮娅的大衣和鞋子
and help you pack the coats and shoes you have there of Sonya's.

1227
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:25,670
不需要
That's not needed.

1228
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:29,510
是啦，但这能帮你走出来
No, but it can help you move on.

1229
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:31,220
我不想走出来
I don't wanna move on.

1230
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,140
她永远都会陪着你
She's always gonna be with you.

1231
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:35,270
但你还在这里
-But you're still here. -Ah...

1232
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,480
够了
That's enough.

1233
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:41,610
我爸死后，我妈就放弃生活
When my father died, my mother, she stopped living.

1234
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:43,860
-她不再像以前那样… -别说了
-She just stopped like she used-- -Stop talking!

1235
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,280
-闭嘴 -好啦！别对我大叫
-Stop it. -Okay! Don't yell at me.

1236
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:52,660
为什么要多管闲事？
白痴

1237
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,120
逮到机会就来烦我
Interrupting me at every turn.

1238
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,500
他们一直喋喋不休，盖过我对她的回忆
The more they babble, the more they drown out the memory of her voice.

1239
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:02,040
我不想把索妮娅赶出我的生命
I don't want to clear Sonya from my life.

1240
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,500
她是我的所有
She was everything.

1241
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:06,340
我本来一无所有，她走后更是如此
There was nothing before her, and there's nothing after!

1242
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,380
你有我
I'm something.

1243
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,050
那个王八蛋！
That son of a bitch!

1244
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,020
不不不
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

1245
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,680
Uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh.

1246
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:21,440
停车，给我停车！
Stop right there. You stop that car!

1247
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,020
你把铁门打开？对吧？
Did you leave that gate open? You left that gate open, didn't you?

1248
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,730
只有你还在乎
You're the only one who gives a damn.

1249
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,690
我要住户遵守规定
I give a damn about people following the rules.

1250
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:31,150
我知道你的事
Yes, I know. I know all about you.

1251
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,990
你在办公室的档案很厚
There's a file on you at the office. It's this thick.

1252
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:35,530
我知道你老婆的事
I know about your wife.

1253
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,620
你怪每个人…
How you blame whatever happened to her on everybody else.

1254
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,700
给我闭嘴
You shut up.

1255
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:41,420
别再说一个字
Don't you say one more word.

1256
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,590
别激动，奥托，我不想惹你生气
Take it easy, Otto. Look, I'm not trying to upset you,

1257
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:47,960
但你不该一个人生活
but you really shouldn't be living alone.

1258
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:52,720
我们比你想像的更了解你，所以…
I mean, we know more about you than you probably realise, so...

1259
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,550
照顾好你的心脏，好吗？
Just look after that heart of yours, okay?

1260
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,930
你对我的心脏了解多少？
What do you know about my heart?

1261
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,850
你对我的心脏了解多少？
Hey, what do you know about my heart?!

1262
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:01,890
多管闲事的混蛋！
You prying bastard!

1263
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,190
奥托
Otto, Otto.

1264
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:07,070
怎么了？没事吧？还好吧？
Otto, what's going on? Are you okay? Do you feel okay?

1265
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:09,230
想帮我的话就关上铁门
You wanna help me, close the gate.

1266
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,580
奥托
Otto. Otto.

1267
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,710

1268
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,380

跟我说话，奥托

It's upstairs in Sonya's old study.

1336
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:10,070
他为什么把你踢出家门？
So why did he kick you out?

1337
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,240
因为你现在是马尔坎了？
Because you're Malcolm now?

1338
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,320
对，因为我是马尔坎
Yeah, because I'm Malcolm.

1339
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,490
因为我打扮成这样
Because I dress like this.

我是跨性别他觉得很丢脸
He's embarrassed 'cause I'm trans.

1342
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,540
那他就是个白痴
Then he's an idiot.

1343
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,250
你今晚睡这里

1375
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,430
-他不能那么做 -他可以
-Chris? He can't do that. -Yeah, he can.

建商发现安妮塔得了帕金森氏症
After Dye & Merika found out Anita had Parkinson's,

1377

就找到克里斯然后…
they tracked Chris down and--

1378
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:30,930
-帕金森氏症？ -对
-Parkinson's? -Yeah.

1379
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:33,980
去年克里斯说服安妮塔签了授权书
So last year Chris convinced Anita to give him power of attorney

1380
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:35,360
以防她的状况变糟
in case she got worse.

1381
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,440
于是建商就向克里斯买下房子
So Dye & Merika made the deal with Chris to buy the house.

1382
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:39,610
那群混蛋
Those pricks.

1383
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:44,240
等等，安妮塔去年发现自己有帕金森？
Wait, Anita found out she had Parkinson's last year?

1384
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,030
不可能是这样
No, that's not right.

1385
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,910
她会告诉索妮娅，索妮娅会告诉我
She would've told Sonya. Sonya would've told me.

1386
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,870
安妮塔和鲁本不想让你们知道
Well, Anita and Reuben didn't want you and Sonya to know.

1387
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,750
他们说你已经够忙了
They said you had enough on your plate as it is.

1388
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,510
他们那么说？
They said that?

1389
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:14,060
我要看建商给妳的所有文件
I need to see everything you ever got from Dye & Merika.

1390
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:17,230
通知、信件，妳有授权书副本吗？
Notices, letters. Do you have a copy of the power of attorney?

1391
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:18,940
你怎么会知道？
How do you know about that?

1392
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,610
-妳有吗？ -有
-Do you have it? -Yes.

1393
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:21,690
-去拿来 -好
-Get it. -Yes.

1394
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:28,580
还有妳和鲁本病情的纪录
And any records of Reuben's condition and yours.

1395
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:30,450
都是吉米跟你说的？
Did Jimmy tell you that?

1396
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:31,950
妳能去拿吗？
Can you get it now?

1397
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,040
可以
Yes.

1398
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,340
我是个白痴
I've been an idiot.

1399
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:45,720
纠结于自己的烦恼，不再替别人着想
I got so wrapped up in my own troubles, I stopped thinking of anyone else.

1400
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,140
我以为可以置身事外
And I figured they weren't thinking about me.

1401
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,520
朋友不该这么冷漠
Friends shouldn't do that.

1402
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,600
所以…
So...

1403
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:56,940
过了这么久很难开口
This isn't easy to say after all this time.

1404
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,110
但我很抱歉
But I'm sorry.

1405
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:04,150
我也会搞定这件事
And I will sort all this out.

1406
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,290
我得借用妳的手机
I need to use your phone.

1407
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,210
为何不能用你自己的？
Why can't you use your own?

1408
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:25,050
我的手机停话了
Mine is disconnected at the moment.

1409
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,140
为什么？
-Why? -That doesn't matter.

1410
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:31,850
不重要，我得借用妳的手机
I just need to use your phone, okay?

1411
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,060
你知道吗？
You know what?

1412
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,140
不行
No.

1413
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,690
-不行？ -不行
-No? -No.

1414
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:41,520
你不肯说你的手机为何停话
You won't tell me why your phone is disconnected?

1415
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:44,940
也不肯说为何要借用我的手机
You won't tell me why you need to use my phone?

1416
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:48,030
更不肯说你昨天在街上怎么了
You won't tell me what happened to you in the street yesterday?

1417
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:51,950
然后回家连门都不肯打开
And then you went inside and you wouldn't even open the door?

1418
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:55,450
你把我吓坏了，奥托
You scared me, Otto.

1419
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:59,250
你知道我在门外等了多久吗？
Do you know how long I was out there?

1420
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:02,290
我不知道你是不是出了事
And I didn't know if something had happened to you.

1421
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:05,800
或是你会出什么事
Or if something was gonna happen to you.

1422
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:10,550
很抱歉我提到索妮娅的大衣
And I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing about Sonya's coats.

1423
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,050
但我只是想帮忙
But I was just trying to help.

1424
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:16,390
你却把我拒之门外
And you left me out there.

1425
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:21,190
所以你不能借用我的手机
So, no. You can't use my phone.

1426
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:30,570
你觉得大家都是白痴所以人生很难
You think your life is so hard because everybody's an idiot

1427
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:32,450
你得自己扛下所有事，对吗？
and you have to do everything on your own, right?

1428
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:34,990
对吗？
Right?

1429
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:37,330
猜怎么着？
But guess what.

1430
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,670
你办不到
You can't.

1431
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:41,920
没人办得到
No one can.

1432
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:44,960
你应该感到高兴
And I think you should just be happy

1433
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:47,380
有人想帮你度过糟糕的一天
that someone was trying to help you get through a crappy day.

1434
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:50,550
就算他们是白痴
Even if they're an idiot.

1435
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,050
所以…建商那些混蛋
-So... -The real estate bastards

1436
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:57,100
想把安妮塔和鲁本赶出他们家
are trying to force Anita and Reuben out of their home.

1437
01:38:57,850 --> 01:38:59,390
所以我才得借用妳的手机
That's why I need to use your phone.

1438
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:04,940
好吧，进来吧
Okay, fine. Come on.

1439
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,330
我们从来没度过假
We had never had a vacation.

1440
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:29,260
索妮娅怀胎六个月
Sonya was six months pregnant.

1441
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:34,220
她想趁宝宝出生前做点特别的
And she wanted to do something special before the baby came.

1442
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:37,510
于是我们就决定去尼加拉大瀑布
So we booked a trip to Niagara Falls.

1443
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,440
回程时客运出车祸
On the way back, the bus crashed.

1444
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:45,690
车厂召回刹车线
There'd been a recall on the brake lines,

1445
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:47,820
但客运公司从没修好
but the company never had them fixed.

1446
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,860
索妮娅半身瘫痪，而且…
Sonya was paralyzed...

1447
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:54,450
我们也失去了儿子
and we lost our son.

1448
01:39:58,370 --> 01:40:00,790
三个月后她终于能回家
After three months, she was finally able to come home.

1449
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:04,790
但他们已经开始盖新公寓
But they had started building the new condos

1450
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,090
还有社区中心和步道
and the community centre and the walkways,

1451
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:11,300
全都不是无障碍空间
none of which were designed for people in wheelchairs.

1452
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:14,800
建商大可以修改设计蓝图
The builders could have changed their plans.

1453
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:20,060
但法律没这规定，他们也不在乎
But the laws weren't in place back then, and they didn't care.

1454
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,770
我在乎
I did.

1455
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:25,230
我非常在乎
-We're putting in a new playground... -I cared.

1456
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:28,070
-你太太这种人… -我好生气
-There's places for people like your wife. -And I was so angry.

1457
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:31,240
什么意思？她这种人？什么意思？
What does that mean? People like her? What does that mean?

1458
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,780
-你想说什么？ -放开我！
-What're you tryin' to say?! -Get off of me!

1459
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:38,830
于是他们就把我踢出管委会
That's when they voted me out as head of the homeowners' association.

1460
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,080
我想彻底毁掉他们
I wanted to obliterate them all.

1461
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:46,920
建商、房地商、客运公司和司机
The builders, and the realtors, and the bus company, the bus driver.

1462
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,630
我本来永远无法放手…
I never would have let it go...

1463
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:51,340
要是没有索妮娅
but for Sonya.

1464
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,550
索妮娅说我们必须继续过活
Sonya said we had to keep living.

1465
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:58,890
我就那么做
That's what I did.

1466
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:01,770
我为了索妮娅继续过活
I lived for Sonya.

1467
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:08,020
她半年前去世
Six months ago she passed away.

1468
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:09,900
癌症
Cancer.

1469
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:15,450
我本来也想寻死
I was going to join her.

1470
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,660
所以才会停用手机
That's why I had them disconnect my phone.

1471
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:25,790
但现在我觉得她要我继续过活
But now I think she wants me to keep living.

1472
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:31,170
我也有事要做
And I have things to do.

1473
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:38,140
"雪莉肯锡"

1474
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,870
你在浪费时间，奥托
You're wasting your time, Otto.

1475
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:07,410
木已成舟，鲁本要跟我们走
It's a done deal. Reuben's coming with us.

1476
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,540
你敢挡路
And if you get in our way,

1477
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:10,880
我就请警察逮捕你
I'll have you arrested.

1478
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,420
我什么都没做 别再向前走一步
-I'm not doing a thing. -Don't you take another step.

1479
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,050
你不能把我先生带走
You are not taking my husband away from me.

1480
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:21,300
安妮塔，我们这是为妳好
Anita, please. We're doing this for your own good.

1481
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:24,470
你想抢走我的房子
What you're doing is trying to take my property.

1482
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:26,600
我要鲁本 留下来跟我一起…
I want Reuben to stay right here for the rest of his life,

1483
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:29,600
"长照部门"

1484
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:31,610
…在家度过余生
with me in our home.

1485
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:35,860
妳不行了，谁会照顾鲁本？
Okay, but who's gonna take care of Reuben when you're no longer able to?

1486
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:38,360
谁会照顾妳？奥托？
Who's gonna take care of you? Otto?

1487
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:41,450
奥托的身体也不行了，对吧？
Otto's not in the best health either. Are you, Otto?

1488
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:43,780
我会照顾他们
I'll take care of 'em.

1489
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:48,580
你在干嘛？放下来 安妮塔和鲁本就像我的家人
-What are you doing? Put that down. -Anita and Reuben are like family to me.

1490
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,420
只要他们需要，我就会照顾他们
I'll take care of them as long as they need.

1491
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,580
他们不是你家人
They're not your family.

1492
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:56,210
他们的儿子克里斯决定他们无法自理
Uh, their son, Chris, has decided they're not fit enough to be on their own,

1493
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,220
所以我们只是…
and so what we're doing is--

1494
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,380
不好意思
Excuse me. When was the last time Chris saw his parents?

1495
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:01,640
克里斯上次见他父母是何时？

1496
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:05,390
他住在日本，十年没跟父母联络
He lives in Japan. They've been estranged for 10 years.

1497
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:07,770
克里斯不清楚他父母的状况
Chris would have no idea how his parents are doing,

1498
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:09,520
除了你跟他说的
except for what you told him.

1499
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,440
妳又是谁？
Okay. And who are you?

1500
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,400
我是雪莉肯锡
My name is Shari Kenzie.

1501
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:15,400
社群媒体记者
Social media journalist.

1502
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,650
我们现在正在直播
-We're streaming live right now. -Uh...

1503
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,780
够了…关掉摄影机，不准乱拍
All right, all right, shut that camera off. You can't film this.

1504
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:23,660
人行道是公共区域
It's a public sidewalk.

1505
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,990
你跟安妮塔儿子说她得了帕金森，但…
You told Anita's son, Chris, that she had Parkinson's,

1506
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:30,870
她从来没说过她的诊断结果
but Anita never told anyone about her diagnosis.

1507
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,040
你怎么会知道？
So how did you know?

1508
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:35,250
我得查一下记录
I'd have to check the records.

1509
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:38,960
安德森先生算是本地英雄
Mr Anderson over there is something of a local hero.

1510
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:41,430
他说你也知道
He tells me you know details about his private health records as well.

1511
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,260
他的私人就诊资料

1512
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,140
你和你公司
So how are you and your company

1513
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,390
是怎么非法取得老人家的病历？
getting illegal access to the medical records of seniors?

1514
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,390
好了，走吧
Okay, let's go. We're done. We're done.

1515
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,060
这件事结束了

1516
01:43:54,150 --> 01:43:55,900
幸会了
Very nice to meet you.

1517
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,690
你玩完了
No, you're done. You're done!

1518
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:00,110
别拿手机拍我 再见
-Get that goddamn camera out of my face. -Goodbye.

1519
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:02,070
-我们做到了 -没错
-We did it! -Oh, we did!

1520
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,450
掰，谢谢你！
Bye, thank you!

1521
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:06,740
我一个小时前
I first uploaded Anita and Chris's story an hour ago.

1522
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:08,450
