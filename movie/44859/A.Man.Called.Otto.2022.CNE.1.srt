我没买两码，只买了五尺
I didn't get 2 yards. I got 5 feet.

29
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,460
是，但我们不以尺收费，用码来算
Yeah, we don't charge by the foot.

30
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,380
99 分一码即 33 分一尺
乘以 5，是 1.65 元

Let me cover that extra 33¢ for you.

48
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,470
先生，我不想要你那 33 分
这也不是 33 分的问题

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,390
问题是我买了五尺绳，因为我只要五尺
This is about the fact that I got 5 feet

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,100
我不该付六尺的钱
因为我不想要六尺绳

51

你想要多一尺绳？
Did you want another foot of rope?

Well, I'm the driver.

162
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,840
我们租住了这里，是啊
We're renting here. Yeah.

163
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,000
住 206 号
In 206.

164
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,180
那不代表你可把拖车泊到前门
That doesn't mean you can back

165
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,850
不，我没有…我是想平行泊车
No, I wasn't. I was, uh, parallel parking.

166
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,020
同边度平行？
Parallel to what?

167
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,350
是啊，泊得不太好，对吧？
Yeah, that, uh, didn't go so well, huh?

168
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,150
我再试试
I'll just give it another try.

169
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,360
噢，天啊
-Oh, my God.

170
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,990
好了
Okay.

171
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,110
Mm...

172
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,660
好，很好！
Good. Good!

173
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,040
继续倒后，继续倒后
Keep backing away. Keep backing away.

174
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,500
再倒后些
Now go away more.

175
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,790
好了，我搞得掂
Okay, I got this.

176
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,670
- 另一边，先倒另一边
- 慢慢

177
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,670
对了
-Easy.

178
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,710
- 慢慢，慢慢
- 很好

179
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,710
不…搞什么？不！
No. No, no. What? No!

180
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,510
不要！停！停车！
-No, no, no! Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

181
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,470
停车！停车！你落车
-Stop! Stop. Get outta the car.

182
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,680
- 落车
- 很抱歉

183
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,310
你咁大个人
How you could make it

184
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,810
竟然不懂倒泊拖车
without knowing how to back up a trailer.

185
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,400
老天，跛了前脚
兼有白内障的狗都泊得比你好

186
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,820
自动波，果然
车匙给我

187
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,530
噢，在杯架上
Oh, they're in the cupholder.

188
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,240
这车是按掣起动的
It's a push-button start.

189
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,490
不，我知道
No, I knew that.

190
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,330
那是什么鬼？
What the hell is that?

191
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,620
是雷达
Uh, that's the radar.

192
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,960
拖车离车边太近
The trailer's too close

193
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,830
所以不断哔，但它…
That's why it's still beeping, but--

194
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,960
好吧
Okay.

195
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
哈罗
Hello.

196
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,050

他开得很好
Oh, that was good, huh?

204
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,960
他一次就泊好？
He just did it in one shot, huh?

205
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,470
- 完美！
- 谢谢，先生

206
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,720

Anyone who thinks

207
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,300
都应被禁止开车

更应被禁用无线电
They shouldn't be allowed

209
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,770
我也这样认为
That's what I said.

210
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,850
许可证要挂上倒后镜
不是放口袋里！

211
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,440
- 知道了
- 收到

212
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,860

来吧，宝贝们
Come on, sweeties.

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,690
孩子们，带齐物品

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,640
（《大师与玛格丽特》）

对吗？是吗？
Right? Yes?

00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,550
奥图

230
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,510
我就是那样说，不是吗？我说了…
Yeah, that's what I said.

231
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,390
你说了什么不重要
奥图，O-T-T-O

232
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,730
- 奥图
-Ah! Otto.

233
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,270
奥图…所以前后倒转都是一样
Otto. Okay, so it's the same forward

很少会听到这名字
It's just you don't hear

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,900
我常常听到啊

为什么？
Why?

241

因为你看起来很饿
Because you looked hungry.

242
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,580
所以我们很合衬
That's why we go so well together.

243
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,050
她爱做菜，而我什么都爱吃

我在萨尔瓦多出世，我爸是那里人

268
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,540
但我妈是墨西哥人
所以我们先去了墨西哥，然后…

不好意思，奥图先生
Excuse me, Mr Otto.

276
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,140
你有星型扳手可以借我吗？
You wouldn't have an Alvin wrench

277
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,730
你指六角扳手
You mean an Allen wrench.

老婆，是叫星形扳手，信我

284
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,780
我认识的人都叫它星形扳手
Everybody else I know

285
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,620
- 你认识的人都讲错，唔好意思
- 是吗？要上 Google 查吗？

286
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,700
天啊
My God.

287
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,330

我们走了，因为你有事要做，所以…

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,000
我知道，他们可能还未买得起
I know, I know.

324
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,920
但是，若那些房地产混蛋
But what will they do

325
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,340
决定拆他们的房子
decide to tear down their house

326
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,220
用来建更多廉价单调的公寓怎么办？
and put up more

327
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,430
一定会发生的，我保证
It's gonna happen. I promise you.

328
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,770
他们已经绕过闸门开车
They're already driving around the gates,

329
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,770
直接驶上草地
driving right across the grass.

330
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,730
美利健四德
Dye & Merika.

331
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,780
哪个蠢材认为这名字适合地产公司？
What idiot thought that was a good name

332
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,240
听落似“美利坚死得”
Sounds like "dying America."

333
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,450
事实上也是
It is, of course.

334
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,330
现在连稳阵的螺丝钩都买不到了
Can't even buy

335
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,210
以尺数买绳也不行
Or rope by the foot.

336
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,710
你不在家，诸事不顺
Nothing works when you're not home.

337
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,450
下一位
Next.

338
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,160
我怀疑你有肥厚型心肌病
I suspect you have

339
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,210
那是遗传性的增大…
which is a genetic enlargement of the--

340
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,290
我知道
I know.

341
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,210
我父亲也有
My father had it.

342
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,590
好吧，你应该可以活很久的…
Well, you'll likely be around

343
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,470
但恐怕你的军途到此为止
but I'm afraid

344
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,050
下一位
Next.

345
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,190
一张回匹兹堡的车票
One return ticket to Pittsburgh, please.

346
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,730
1.10 元
That'll be 1.10.

347
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,860
谢谢
Thank you.

348
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,870
借过
Coming through.

349
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,180
嘿，你的书掉了！
Hey, you dropped your book!

350
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,730
小姐，你的书掉了！嘿！
Miss, you dropped your book! Hey!

351
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,070
那是我的吗？
Is that mine?

352
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,070
什么？
What?

353
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,070
是的，我见到你掉了，所以我…
-Yes. I saw you dropped it, so I...

354
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,410
（《大师与玛格丽特》）

355
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,830
很感谢你
Thank you so much.

356
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,830
我已看了一半，不知道结局我会很气愤
I'm halfway through reading it.

357
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,130
坐吧，不如一起坐
Oh, here. Why don't you join me?

358
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
我叫桑雅
I'm Sonya.

359
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,760
我叫奥图
I'm Otto.

360
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,970
跟我父亲同名
It was my father's name.

361
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,680
我正要去探望爸爸
I'm on my way

362
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,020
我逢星期四都去
I go every Thursday.

363
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,690
你经常坐这班火车？
Do you take this train a lot?

364
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,530
不，我只是进城参加入伍体检
Oh, no, I had to come into town

365
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,160
天啊
Oh, God.

366
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,120
那一定很艰难
你不知道在那边会面临什么

367
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,330
- 你什么时候出发？
- 我不…

368
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,250
还有一段时间
Not for a while.

369
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,800
麻烦车票
Tickets, please.

370
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,930
谢谢
Thank you.

371
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,930
行了，谢谢
All right, thank you.

372
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,940
你好像上错车了，这是东行票
I'm afraid you're on the wrong train.

373
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,560
我一定是…
I must have, um...

374
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,780
我下一个站下车
I'll get off at the next station.

375
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,070
多少钱？
Uh, how much is it?

376
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,240
1.75 元
Uh, $1.75.

377
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,700
一元
One.

378
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,840
给你，我有些零钱
Here. I have some change.

379
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,930
谢谢
Thank you.

380
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,310
给你，祝你今天愉快
There you go. Thank you. Have a good day.

381
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,150
还剩 25 分
A quarter to spare.

382
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,160
是 1964 年的
It's 1964.

383
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,530
纯银的
-It's pure silver.

384
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,290
那你留着吧，代表幸运的
Keep it, then. It's lucky.

385
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,330
对，没错
Yes, it is.

386
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,620
（谢谢，这道菜很有趣）

387
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,220
嘿，奥图！
现在出来巡视太晚了，不是吗？

388
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,180
不是
No.

389
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,010
不是吗？你不是该已上班？
No? Aren't you supposed to be at work?

390
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,100
不是
No.

391
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,600
好极，你想过来吃午餐吗？
Oh. Cool.

392
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,770
午餐
-Lunch.

393
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,940
是啊
Yeah.

394
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,610
不，不行
No, no.

395
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,570
吃猪里脊，若你改变主意的话！
Well, it's pork tenderloin,

396
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,150
不，不行
No, no, no, no.

397
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,370
嘿，不好意思
Hey, excuse me.

398
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,120
就是你
It was you.

399
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,920
这是私家路，这闸是为了减少行车
This is a private road, and these gates

400
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,540
而不是让白痴司机绕过闸门、辗坏草地
Not so idiot drivers can go around them

401
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,840
好吧，被你抓到了
我是美利健四德的

402
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,590
我会叫管理员过来帮你修好，好吗？
I'm gonna have the groundskeeper

403
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,720
像新的一样，甚至更好
祝你今天愉快，好吗？

404
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,600
立规矩自有原因
The rules are here for a reason.

405
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,150
我知你们打算做什么
I know what you guys are up to.

406
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,440
好吧，安达臣先生，随你怎么说
Okay, Mr Anderson. Whatever you say.

407
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,820
继续巡视小区吧
Keep up the neighbourhood watch.

408
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,570
出来，你只衰猫！
-Get out here, you little bugger!

409
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,530
出来啊
Come on. Yeah.

410
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,620
出来！
Get out here!

411
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,750
你再丢一块石头
You throw one more rock,

412
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,620
我发誓我会一脚
踢你只老鼠狗上屋顶

413
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,380
我不是对你家丢石头
那只衰猫抓伤了王子

414
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,630
我要杀了那只畜生
I'm gonna kill that piece of shit.

415
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,840
不，不行
No, you're not.

416
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,670
你在乎什么？它是只野猫
What do you care? It's feral.

417
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,220
可能满身奇怪疾病
It's probably full of all sorts

418
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,680
你也很可能有，但我不会向你丢石头
So are you, most likely.

419
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,600
安迪
Andy.

420
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,520
- 怎么了？
- 你听到他这次说什么吗？

421
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,350
我跟你讲过他怎骂我
I told you before about

422
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,520
趁早走吧
Get outta here while you can.

423
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,810
我不是你的朋友
I'm not your friend.

424
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,570
地产公司的人说
会把这条街的老人都送去老人院

425
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,980
越快越好！
The sooner the better!

426
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,170
哈罗
-Hello.

427
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,590
- 又怎么了？
- 我只想还扳手给你

428
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,510
- 原来家具里有
- 恭喜

429
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,470
我还焗了些吃的给你
And I made you some salpores de arroz.

430
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,390
是浓酱鸡吗？
Is that chicken and mole?

431
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,940
不，是萨尔瓦多传统曲奇
我父亲最爱吃，所以…

432
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,810
很美味的，你会喜欢
They're delicious.

433
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,270
没错，因为是我焗的
Yes, because I made them.

434
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,530
还有，奥图
你有梯可以借给我吗？

435
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,940
我们的窗卡住了
Our window is jammed.

436
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,570
你为什么需要梯？
Why do you need a ladder?

437
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,820
因为是楼上的窗
Well, it's the one up there.

438
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,370
打不开
It won't open.

439
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,950
你想从外面打开？
And you're gonna try to open it

440
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,290
是，没错
Yeah. Right.

441
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,040
我去拿外套
I'll get my coat.

442
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,540
好，谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

443
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,340
我喜欢它这样挥手
I like how his hands are waving.

444
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,130
插上手臂
Let's put the arm in.

445
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,760
- 好极
- 安妮塔

446
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,180
奥图，抱歉打扰你
但我们没有暖气

447
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,720
你能来看看吗？
Could you come take a look?

448
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,230
试试帮散热器放气
Try bleeding your radiators.

449
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,650
我要怎样做到？
How would I go about that?

450
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,020
就是帮散热器放气
By bleeding the radiators.

451
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,030
奥图，别那么无礼
Otto. Don't be rude.

452
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,730
我没有无礼
I wasn't being rude.

453
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,320
有时听奥图的说话很难分辨
Well, it's hard to tell the difference

454
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,410
没错
Yeah.

455
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,660
顺便一说，我们刚搬到 206 号
By the way, we, uh, just moved to 206.

456
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,960
- 我叫玛莉素
- 我叫汤美

457
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,130
- 欢迎你们，亲爱的
- 幸会

458
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,290
我叫安妮塔
I'm Anita.

459
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,340
以前都是我老公鲁本处理暖气
My husband, Reuben,

460
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,670
但我们都知他迟早没法…
-Okay.

461
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,550
再处理家里的事
when he wouldn't be able to handle things

462
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,310
或许鲁本密谋夺权时
就该想到这一点

463
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,350
Oh...

464
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,020
那已是很久以前的事
That was a long time ago.

465
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,270
夺权？
A coup?

466
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,360
那是误会
It was a misunderstanding.

467
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,520
曾有人想夺权
It was a coup.

468
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,660
奥图，你就不能帮
安妮塔的散热器放热吗？

469
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,530
不行，因为散热器不能放热
No. Because you don't breathe radiators.

470
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,660
是要放气
You bleed them.

471
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,750
- 亲爱的，看这斜台
- 那是桑雅的

472
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,910
- 拖车用得着
- 放下它

473
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,830
放下它！谁说你可以碰的？
Put that down!

474
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,170
- 对不起，奥图
- 你们都滚！走！

475
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,090
拿梯子走
全部走，通通都走

476
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,550
- 好吧
- 谢谢

477
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,930
小心
Watch out.

478
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,680
知道了
-Right. Right.

479
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,810
- 谢谢！
-Thank you!

480
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,150
不，你在这里做什么？
No. What are you doing in here?

481
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,110
你怎么进来的？
How did you get in here? Come on.

482
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,610
快，走啊！出来！
Come on. Go! Get outta there.

483
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,740
不，出来！出来！
No, get out. Get out of there.

484
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,830
好了，快走
Come on, go.

485
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,620
嘿
-Hey.

486
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,500
放开！
Let go!

487
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,380
放开！
-Let go.

488
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,550
你敢抓伤我，我就咬你
You scratch me, I'll bite you.

489
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,060
受教训了吧
-That'll teach you.

490
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,600
蠢猫
Stupid cat.

491
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,690
- 嗨，奥图！
-Hi, Otto!

492
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,450
O-T-T-O

493
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,280
Hm.

494
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
奥图
Otto. Um...

495
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,880
去年八月我借了花园水管给你
I loaned you my garden hose last August.

496
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,050
你还给我，我就帮你的散热器放气
If you give it back to me,

497
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,850
进来
Come in.

498
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:19,990
你的那些新邻居
他们看来为人不错，不是吗？

499
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
很不错
Lovely.

500
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,620
是啊，你可能很快会有更多新邻居
Yeah, well, you may have

501
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,120
地产公司的人，他们一直跟我们说…
The realty people,

502
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,460
鲁本和我必须搬走
Reuben and I have to move out.

503
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,500
不，简直是放屁
No, that's a load of crap.

504
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,300
这间屋不是他们的，是你们的
They don't own this house. You do.

505
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,050
对，我也是这样说
Yeah, well, that's what I said.

506
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,470
他们最近游说我们的儿子基斯
They, uh, have been

507
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,510
Oh.

508
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,800
现在他说我没能力再照顾鲁本
Now he's saying that I can

509
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,020
说他需要住进特殊疗养院
that he needs to be

510
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,850
而我就该搬去老人院
And I should move into a retirement home.

511
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,980
基斯懂个屁？
他是个蠢蛋，一直都是

512
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,980
他们不能迫你做任何事
They can't make you do anything.

513
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,070
他知道我们在这吗？
Does he even know we're here?

514
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,070
他当然知道
Of course he does.

515
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,950
别让他骗了你
Don't let him fool you.

516
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,080
以前的他还在
He's still in there.

517
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,410
Um...

518
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
我去找你的水管
Let me go find your hose.

519
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,400
最近整个小区都乌烟瘴气
The whole neighbourhood

520
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,650
他们连业主会都不再有
They don't even have

521
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,160
没人留下来打理这小区
No one left to keep things running.

522
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,370
不像我们以前那样打理
Not like we did.

523
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,880
我先讲清楚
Now, just to be clear...

524
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,670
我仍没有原谅你
I still haven't forgiven you.

525
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,430
我只是没意识到你会恶化得那么快
I just didn't realise

526
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,720
现在…
Now...

527
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,520
他们正摧毁我们辛苦建立的一切
they're tearing apart

528
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,900
我还没走呢，他们就想把我们抹去
I haven't even left yet,

529
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,360
老实说，我不会留在这里看着一切发生
Well, I am not staying around

530
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,530
我要走了
I'm leaving.

531
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,280
- 永远离去
- 准备吃午餐了？

532
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,990
- 我煮了你喜欢的忌廉粟米
- 噢，谢谢

533
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,960
谢谢，奥图
抱歉这么久才还给你

534
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,420
留下来吃午餐吗？
Um, you wanna stay for lunch?

535
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,290
是啊，安妮塔煮了猪里脊
Yeah, Anita made a pork tenderloin.

536
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,540
不了，我有很多事要做
No, I have a lot of things I have to do.

537
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,170
鲁本，你做什么，亲爱的？
Reuben, what are you doing, hon?

538
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,340
- 放手
- 你在做什么？

539
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,350
- 放手
- 鲁本

540
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,430
- 放…
- 你在做什么？

541
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,350
手！
...go.

542
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,160
老天
Oh, man.

543
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,760
试试从里面打开
Try opening it from the inside a little.

544
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,560
比我想像中高
It's higher than I thought.

545
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,230
我有点头晕，老婆
I'm a little bit dizzy, honey.

546
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,440
Mmm.

547
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,060

化油器要把汽油和空气恰当混合
A carburettor has to mix gas and air

593
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,020
来自我父亲
From my father.

594
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,350
我们只会谈这些，他是个好爸爸
It's all we really talked about.

可靠
Dependable.

两个月前

598
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,360
很突然的

我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

600
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:25,740

不太记得她了
Don't remember her much.

602

只记得她过身时的感觉
Just how it felt when she was gone.

603
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,430
你为什么不点主菜？
Why didn't you get an entrée?

604
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,890
我在家吃过饭了
I ate at home.

605
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,810
为什么？
Why?

606
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,400
那你就可以随便点菜
So you could order whatever you wanted.

607
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,990
听着，我骗了你
Look, I lied to you.

608
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,910
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

609
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,790
我没入伍，我体检不合格
I'm not in the Army.

610
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,290
若合格了，至少现在
我有工作可依靠，但是…

611
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,130
我不合格
But I don't.

612
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,920
而我不知道我要做什么
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

613
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,880
我该走了
I should go.

00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,280

请你载我去医院？求求你
Can you please take me

622
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,430
汤美从梯上摔下来
救护车刚接走他

623
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:11,480
你可以开你那进口焗炉般的车去
Well, you can drive yourself

624
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,230
我没车牌
I don't have a licence.

625
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,940
- 你几岁了？
- 三十岁

626
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,940
而你没有车牌？
And you don't have a driver's licence?

627
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,150
我有学车许可证
I have a driving's permit.

628
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,570
只是从没去办之后各种手续
I just never got to the other parts.

629
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,570
仲有哪几种手续？
How many other parts are there?

630
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,740
拜托！
Please!

631
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,580
专心！请你听我讲！
Focus! Please, listen!

632
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:39,090
汤美进了医院
我们说话期间他可能已经死了

633
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,670
所以你要开车送我去医院
还是叫我去坐巴士？

634
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,800
- 我会开车送你去医院
- 谢谢

635
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,800
这很难吗？
Was it so hard?

636
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,510
你去哪里？
Where are you going?

637

孩子们？

（杜克逊医院）

640
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,150
抬起我！抬起我！
Pick me up, pick me up!

641

00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,810
- 我找到熊先生的书！
- 我见到

648
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,440
她想你讲故事
She wants you to read to her.

649
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,730
没错
Exactly.

650
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,030
《你在吗？熊宝宝？》
"Are You There, Baby Bear?

651
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,160
“你在吗，熊宝宝？”熊先生说
'Are you there, Baby Bear?'

652
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,740
“在哪里？我的熊宝宝”
'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear.'"

653
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,740
不，要说得像熊一样
No, talk like a bear.

654
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,410
熊不会说话
Bears don't talk.

655
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,870
这一只会
Um, this one does.

656
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,420
“在哪里？我的熊宝宝？”
"'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear?'

657
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,350
“熊宝宝，你在吗？在那棵树上？”
'Are you there, Baby Bear,

658
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,350
不，那是猫头鹰！
-No, it's an owl!

659
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:23,270
“这里没其他动物，只有宝宝和我”
"'There's nobody here but baby and me.'

660
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,200
“熊宝宝，你在吗？在地下深处？”
'Are you there, Baby Bear,

661
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,080
我不是熊宝宝
I'm no Baby Bear.

662
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,660
我是贝贝！
I'm Beppo!

663
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,200
- 嗨，贝贝！
-Hi, Beppo!

664
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,120
- 想看魔术吗？
- 想！

665
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,750
其实我正给她们讲故事
Actually, I was reading to them.

666
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:46,130
“其实我正给她们讲故事”
熊先生抱怨说

667
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,260
我可以借个硬币吗，熊先生？
Say, could I borrow a coin, Mr Bear?

668
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,180
可以，可以…求求你？
Yes, yes, yes, please?

669
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,180
求求你？
Please, please, please?

670
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,060
借啊！借啊！
-Yes, yes, yes!

671
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:57,930
要还给我
I need this back.

672
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,520
当然
Absolutely.

673
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,830
那套小丑装不是他的，是医院的
He doesn't even own the costume.

674
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,420
他要赔钱
He's gonna have to pay for that.

675
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,380
贝贝代表快乐
他来这里做义工的

676
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,210
奥图，你到底做了什么？
Otto. What the hell did you do?

677
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,300
没什么
Nothing.

678
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,880
奥图爷爷打了小丑
Abuelo Otto hit the clown.

679
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,840
- 我没有
- 有，你有

680
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,640
摔角手爷爷！
Abuelo Luchadoro!

681
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,060
摔角手！
Luchadoro!

682
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,890
都是那小丑的错
It was all the clown's fault.

683
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,730
Ooh!

684
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,520
它要去哪里？
Where is it going?

685
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

686
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,280
你来吧
Here you go.

687
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,490
吹口气
Blow.

688
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:59,290
哇！在这里！
Wow! Here it is!

689
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,370
- 你怎做到的？
- 是魔法啊

690
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,120
谢谢
-Thank you.

691
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,250
希望你们有神奇的一天！
I hope you have a magical day!

692
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,750
- 拜拜！
- 拜拜，贝贝！

693
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,710
- 谢谢
- 等等

694
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,930
这不是我的硬币
This isn't my quarter.

695
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,390
从你耳朵出来的，所以是你认错
Well, it came from your ear, sir,

696
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,060
不，这不是我的硬币
No, this isn't my quarter.

697
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,600
“不，这不是你的硬币”
"No, no, no. This is not your quarter."

698
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,770
听着，我给了你一个硬币
我说过要拿回来

699
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,070
- 你想要一元？
- 你换了这个给我

700
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,820
- 调包把戏
- 你给了我这硬币

701
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,690
奥图会有麻烦吗？
Is Otto going to get in trouble?

702
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,280
- 只是个硬币
- 不，不是

703
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,700
- 看到里面的铜吗？
- 他不是呼唤铜

704
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,700
- 我给你的是 1964 年的硬币
- 请冷静

705
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,200
还给我！在哪？
I want it back! Where is it?

706
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,160
- 在你身上的！
- 警察，帮我

707
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,120
129，有小丑纠纷
129. We have a clown situation.

708
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,210
在哪？
Where is it?

709
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,710
请放开小丑！先生！先生！
Let go of the clown! Sir! Sir!

710
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,790
哈！1964 年
A-ha! 1964.

711
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,180
我的玩具在哪？
Where's my toy?

712
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,720
在你的背包里
It's in your backpack.

713
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,310
哪一格？有太多格
What pocket? There's a million pockets.

714
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,600
怎么了？
What?

715
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,810
我父亲也曾那样笑
My father used to smile like that.

716
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,690
我没在笑
I'm not smiling.

717
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,190
正是这样
Exactly.

718
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,990
你不应该这样对小丑
You should never be mean to a clown.

719
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,200
- 星形扳手呢，他要来吗？
- 看！

720
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,780
- 嘿，各位！
- 妈，他在那！

721
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,080
麻烦开车过去，我们去接他
Pull the car up please, so we pick him up.

722
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,160
奥图！
Otto!

723
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,170
-Yay! Yay!

724
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,710
- 多谢你开车载我们
- 拜拜，摔角手爷爷

725
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,550
- 谢谢，奥图
- 好了，晚安

726
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,300
- 拜拜！
- 再次多谢，奥图

727
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,220
拜拜啦
Bye, then.

728
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,760
好了，女士们
All right, ladies.

729
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:40,850
走吧
Let's go.

730
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,770
看你只新脚！似机械脚
Look at your new leg!

731
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,080
奥图！
Otto!

732
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,670
天啊，它死了吗？
Oh, my God, is he dead?

733
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,800
不，它可能只是睡着
No, he's probably sleeping.

734
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,180
奥图，不，求求你
抱它出来，拜托

735
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,140
不，你为什么不去？
No, why can't you?

736
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,270
因为我怀孕了
我不能碰猫，可能会沾到弓虫

737
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,730
它自己走进去的，自然可自己出来
Well, he got himself in there.

738
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,810
Ay.

739
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,230
你怎么能这样？
Why are you like that?

740
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:33,690
我同猫唔夹
I'm not good with cats.

741
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,400
嘿，老友，怎么了？
Hey, man. What's going on?

742
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,740
占美！占美，我们有…
Jimmy. Jimmy. We have a...

743
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,160
噢，惨了！
Oh, no!

744
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,910
要帮你保暖，老友！
We gotta warm you up, buddy!

745
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,490
是啊…小心些
Oh, yeah. Oh, be careful.

746
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,910
真惨
Oh, no.

747
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,410
噢，我来抱你
-Oh, I've got you.

748
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,080
它很冰冷
He's so cold.

749
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,500
我们该去哪？
Where do we go?

750
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,630
不，不行，会有弓虫
去奥图度

751
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,130
好了，走吧
我救起你了

752
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:56,670
奥图，开门
Otto. Open the door.

753
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,300
噢，没事的，老友
Oh, it's all right, buddy.

754
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,470
- 没事的，小猫咪
- 真可怜

755
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,300
好了，没事了
Okay. You're okay.

756
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,470
- 弄得我全地板都是雪
- 噢，对不起

757
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,810
天啊，这里太冷了
Oh, my God, it's so freezing here.

758
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,100
好了，这件怎样？
Okay, how about this one? Please?

759
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,690
不，不行
别碰那外套，留在那里

760
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:18,070
- 好了，可否拿张毛毯来？
- 给猫用？

761
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,990
- 不要紧，我搞得掂
- 你在做什么？

762
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,490
体温有奇效，我够大只又够暖
Oh, body heat works wonders.

763
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,240
我去开焗炉
I'm gonna turn on the oven.

764
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,750
别把那只猫放进我焗炉
You are not putting that cat in my oven.

765
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,750
我只想让屋内暖和些
No, I'm just trying to get

766
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,050
你的枱面好低，哪里买来的？
Your counters are so low.

767
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,300
我自己造的
I built them.

768
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,300
给桑雅，我的太太
For Sonya. For my wife.

769
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,100
她也很矮吗？
Ah. Is she short too?

770
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,310
桑雅去世了
Sonya passed away.

771
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,520
但她厨艺了得，不是吗？
She was a great cook though,

772
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,230
我以前常来这里吃饭
I used to eat here all the time.

773
00:53:58,730 --> 00:53:59,570
Oh.

774
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,950
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

775
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,370
你们现在可以走了吗？
Well, can you go now?

776
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,080
我有事要做
I have things to do.

777
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,330
那么…见到你真好，一如以往
Well, it was great seeing ya, as usual.

778
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,630
嘿，谁来照顾这家伙？
Oh, hey, who's gonna look after this guy?

779
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,960
你
You are.

780
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,590
-Aw.

781
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,670
好吧
Okay.

782
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,520
现在正经地问我
Now ask me the right way.

783
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,480
那真的很美
It was so beautiful too.

784
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,530
好了，我饿了
Okay, now I'm hungry. Now I'm hungry.

785
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,650
（恭喜 1978 年工程班）

786
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,080
我们看看
Let's see.

“校委会特此证明奥图安达臣”
"The Board of Regents hereby certifies

00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,840
你有没有想过…
Would you ever wanna...

791
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,090
想过结婚？
get married?

792
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,630

愿意
Yes.

愿意！愿意！
-Yes! Yes!

他掉下去了！
He fell down!

803
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,980
- 找人帮他啊！
- 影他呀，不，拍片

804
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,190
有无搞错
Oh, for God's sake.

805
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,980
- 有无人帮手呀？
- 天啊，他摔倒了

806
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:46,070
- 抬他上来！救命！
- 嘿！你能动吗？

807
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,820
起来！快！你要起来！
You gotta move! Come on! You gotta get up!

808
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,780
来帮我好吗？
Will somebody help me?

809
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,580
- 快啊
- 影低！影啊！

810
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,870
- 拍片呀
- 拍到了，我见到他

811
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
拍近点
Zoom in on his face.

812
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,420
- 快说事件经过
- 我们本来要去博物馆…

813
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:19,890
看着我
Look at me.

814
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,980
打个招呼
Say hello.

815
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,560
吸一口气，奥图
Take a breath, Otto.

816
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,820
握住我的手
Take my hand.

817
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,780
握住我的手
Take my hand.

818
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,650
快握住我的手！
Take my hand now!

819
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,330
你疯了吗？你会无命
Hey, are you out of your mind?

820
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,880
先生，你救了他一命
Sir, you saved his life.

821
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,340
他救了他一命
He saved that guy's life.

822
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:50,050
真了不起
You're amazing. Oh, my God.

823
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,560
- 总之追踪我们
- 追踪我们

824
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:18,990
Hey.

825
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,210
你想吓死我吗？
Are you trying to scare me to death?

826
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,960
你看这个
Look at this.

827
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:28,670
Um...

828
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,050
艾比想给新邻居画幅画
Abbie wanted to make a picture

829
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,550
她想送给你
She wants you to have that.

830
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:35,930
那是你
That's you.

831
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,760
她总是把你画成彩色
She always draws you in colour.

832
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,350
“总是 ”是什么意思？
What do you mean, "always"?

833
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:41,810
Hm!

834
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,600
我有个非常好的主意
I have a very good idea.

835
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,100
你可以教我开车
You can be my driver's instructor.

836
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,360
不
No.

837
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,280
不，不要
No, no, no.

838
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,440
我没时间教你
I don't have time for that.

839
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,030
但放心，我会付油钱和其他费用
But don't worry,

840
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,740
嘿，你们在这，我到处找你们
Hey, there you guys are.

841
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,540
嗨，占美，你在做什么？
-Hi, Jimmy. What are you doing?

842
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,040
- 猫在里面？
- 是

843
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,250
天啊！冷静点，老友
-Oh, jeez! Calm down, dude.

844
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,420
它真的不喜欢这纸箱
-He really doesn't like this.

845
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,170
让它出来啊
Let him out of the box.

846
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,050
好吧…对不起，老友
Okay. Sorry, buddy.

847
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,180
你打算做什么？带它去散步？
What do you think you were doing?

848
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,390
我必须把它带回来，我忘了我会过敏
Well, I had to bring him back.

849
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:23,480
所以…
-So...

850
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,350
- 噢，占美
- 是啊

851
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,520
我涂了点燕麦，但没帮助
I put oatmeal on it,

852
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:32,900
好了，跟我来吧
汤美去年的药还在

853
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,110
- 他找到了黄蜂巢
- 你确定？

854
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,700
- 我不想烦到你
- 不要紧，但别抓了

855
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,780
我觉得该抓一下
-Don't scratch.

856
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,330
嘿！那只猫怎么办？
Hey, hey, what about the cat?

857
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,200
看来它是你的了，奥图
Uh, looks like he's yours now, Otto.

858
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:44,870
要爱它
Love him.

859
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,350
进纸箱
-Get in the box.

860
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:05,480
进纸箱
Get in the box.

861
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:11,730
进纸箱
Get in the box.

862
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,160
对不起，我还没来陪你
Sorry I haven't come yet.

863
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,250
那比我想像中难…
It's been harder than I thought to...

864
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,180
而且现在它搬进来了
And now he's moved in.

865
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,970
我有只猫
I have a cat.

866
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,350
我要想想如何安置它
I have to figure out what to do with him.

867
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,820
然后我就去找你
桑雅，我保证

868
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,360
我想念你
I miss you.

869
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:06,330
♪ And I finally see ♪

870
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,960
♪ How your love is the best of me ♪

871
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,880
♪ Yeah, there's so much

872
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:21,430
♪ Yeah, there's so much
I want you to know ♪

873
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,270
♪ Guess I'll wait till you're home ♪

874
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,890
噢，不行
Oh, no, no, no.

875
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,230
你不能霸占我的床
You are not taking over my bed.

876
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,110
这才是你的床
This is your bed.

877
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,360
你宁愿睡在外面
Would you rather sleep outside,

878
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:40,360
回到雪地里？
back in the snow?

879
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:41,700
我大可以安排
That can be arranged.

880
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:55,420
你会是我们孩子最想要的好爸爸
You'll be the best dad

881
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,580
嘿！嘿！
Hey! Hey!

882
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,750
怎么了？
What?

883
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:35,000
你踩那单车就是来派传单？
Is this what you use that bike for?

884
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,630
是啊，是我的工作
Yeah. It's my job.

885
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:39,090
做侍应和入油才是工作
Waiting tables and pumping gas,

886
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:43,010
我还在薄饼店返夜班
周末返夜冷店，所以…

887
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:44,430
Oh.

888
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,060
你是安达臣先生，对吗？
-Huh.

889
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,470
Mm-hm.

890
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,430
你以前常来学校的演讲
You used to come

891
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:53,890
几时的事？
When was that?

892
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,940
安达臣太太是我的老师
Mrs Anderson was my teacher.

893
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,110
她是第一个不把我当怪胎的人
She was the first person

894
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:02,570
因为我是跨男
'cause I'm transgender.

895
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:07,160
她是第一个叫我新名字的人
She was the first

896
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,490
她叫其他老师也这样做
She got the other teachers to do it too.

897
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,000
那样在学校真的帮到我
It really helped me at school.

898
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,420
我不会再在这里派传单了
I won't leave these here anymore.

899
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,840
嘿
Hey.

906
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,360
安迪在教我开车
Andy's teaching me how to drive.

907
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,530
学坏师
The wrong way.

01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,870

泊车档！
Park!

912
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,370
你仍在用前进档！它是自动波
You're still in drive! It's an automatic.

913
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,380
你仍在用前进档
你要转到泊车档

914
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,290
什么？
In what?

915
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,210
拜拜！
Bye!

916
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,130

- 好了，来了！

920
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:19,480
奥图来了！我妈焗了曲奇
Otto's here!

921
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,190
嘿，奥图，进来吧
Hey, Otto. Come in.

922
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:24,070
我无法忍受看着
一个蠢材教另一个蠢材开车

923
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:27,150
你！穿好外套，够钟上堂
You. Put on your coat. It's lesson time.

924
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,240
什么？
What?

925
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,830
你要教我？真的？
You're gonna teach me? Really?

926

你真的太好人了，奥图，谢谢
That's really, really nice of you, Otto.

930
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,130

931
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,800
我教过一次
I tried once.

932
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,050

935
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,140

936
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,720

好了
All right.

940
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,560
大人都不在了，来吧！
-No more grown-ups. Come on!

941
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:07,030
奥图，可以开我们的车吗？
Ah. Otto, pero can we go in our car?

942
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:09,530
因为我只开过自动波
Because I've only ever driven automatic.

943
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,570
不行
No.

944
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,660
我要正经教你开车，上车
I'm teaching you how to drive. Get in.

945
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,460
好了，快到红灯了
你要停下来

946
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,380
好，我要踩离合器，对吗？
Okay, but I get the clutch, right?

947
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,300
你要踩离合器，然后踩刹掣
You get the clutch

948
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,470
- 踩刹掣，还是离合器？
- 继续踩住离合器

949
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,470
踩刹掣，我踩离合器
Put in the brake, I put the clutch.

950
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,470
离合器和刹掣，然后踩刹掣
Clutch and brake. And now brake.

951
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,390
刹掣…刹掣
-Brake. Brake.

952
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,980
- 别大声骂我
- 我没大声骂你

953
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,270
踩离合器…踩了！踩了！
Clutch in. It's in, it's in!

954
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,230
我们要停下来，然后…
We're going to stop, and...

955
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:45,650
踩离合器，再踩刹掣
刹掣…刹掣…

956
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:48,610
那辆车停了，别撞上去！
刹掣，刹掣！

957
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:50,780
好了，放手吧
Yes. All right, let go.

958
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,370
天啊
Oh, my God.

959
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,450
刹掣
Brake.

960
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,410
踩离合器和刹掣
It's clutch and brake.

961
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:58,580
我开车很差
I suck at this.

962
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,540
- 我很差
- 你还在学

963
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,960
天啊，我差点撞上那辆车…就这么近
Oh, my God, I almost hit the car.

964
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,090
不要紧，那是混能车
It doesn't matter. It's a hybrid.

965
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:08,380
那是混能车，好吧
It's a hybrid, okay.

966
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:11,430
- 也许我该退后
- 不要…

967
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:13,760
- 你这样停就好
- 但我跟它很贴

968
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,930
- 不要紧
- 我不用倒后？

969
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:17,850
只需等绿灯
-Just wait for the green light.

970
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,600
好了，踩离合器
And here we go. So press in on the clutch.

971
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,730
慢慢踩油
And give it a little gas.

972
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,150
慢慢松开离合…
Slowly let out on the clu--

973
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,440
你还未入档
Oh, you're not in gear.

974
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,030
绿灯了！
Green!

975
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,910
踩离合器，转到第一…
你不用扭车匙

976
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:34,410
- 开车啦！
- 只需踩…

977
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,780
- 天啊
- 踩…

978
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:39,240
慢慢松开离合器
-Slowly let out the clutch,

979
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:40,700
- 然后踩油门
- 我做不到

980
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,960
- 你只需要那样做
- 我做不到

981
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,880
不，奥图
奥图，不要

982
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,840
怎么了？
What?

983
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,630
老天
Oh, shit.

984
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:50,920
你有病吗？
What is wrong with you?

985
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:53,300
她在学开车
She's learning how to drive.

986
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,430
你以前不用学开车吗？
Did you not have to learn how to drive?

987
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:58,680
冷静，老爹，嘿！嘿！
Calm down, old man. Hey, hey.

988
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,140
我不是你老爹！你这混帐！
I'm not your old man! You son of a bitch!

989
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,520
如果你再响鞍
If you honk that horn one more time,

990
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,400
那将是你临死前做的最后一件事，听到吗？
it'll be the last thing you do.

991
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:09,820
明白吗？
¿Comprende?

992
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,320
惨了
Oh, shit.

993
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,410
现在你听我讲
Now you listen to me.

994
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,700
你生了两个孩子，很快就生第三个
You have given birth to two children.

995
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:26,630
你从非常遥远的国家来到这里
You have come here

996
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,290
你学会了一种新语言
You learned a new language,

997
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,920
你来接受了教育，嫁了个笨老公
you got yourself an education

998
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,050
你维系了全家人
and you are holding that family together.

999
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:35,630
你学开车完全不会有问题
You will have no problem

1000
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,890
天啊，这世界充满了蠢材
My God,

1001
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,810
他们都学得懂，何况你不是蠢到贴地
who have managed to figure it out,

1002
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,140
好了…
So...

1003
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:48,310
离合器
Clutch.

1004
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:50,360
换档
Shift.

1005
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,230
踩油
Gas.

1006
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,530
开车
Drive.

1007
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,540
Ah...

1008
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,160
很不错
Yeah.

1009
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,710
很不错
Que bueno.

1010
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,840
很不错
Que bueno.

1011
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,550
好的，这里有位
Okay, there's a spot right there.

1012
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:19,890
上前，平行泊车
Just pull up, parallel,

1013
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,850
把车倒后
直到泵把与侧视镜一致

1014
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:25,930
（斯登面包）

1015
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,270
现在泊直
Now straighten out.

1016
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,900
一直退到路边
Back up all the way up to the curb.

1017
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,650
- 上少少
- 少少

1018
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,780
然后停
And stop.

1019
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:37,860
空档
Neutral.

1020
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,280
刹掣
-Brake.

1021
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:41,370
车匙
Key.

1022
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,620
成功了？
Is that it?

1023
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,750
成功了
That's it.

1024
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,580
而且来得刚刚好
-And we're right on time.

1025
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:51,840
我可以了
I have it.

1026
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,960
-Uh-huh.

1027
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,670
这些是豆蔻面包
-These are semlors.

1028
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:00,800
瑞典的长条泡芙
-Swedish éclairs.

1029
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,890
会吃得脏乱
They're a little messy.

1030
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,180
但尝尝吧
-But let's try.

1031
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,310
用手指按住
With your finger.

1032
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,360
Mmm!

1033
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,320
你怎找到这地方的？
How did you find this place?

1034
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:18,650
这里是桑雅最喜欢的
This was Sonya's place.

1035
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:23,580
我们以前逢星期六一点都来
We used to come here

1036
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,410
然后呢？之后做什么？
And then? What?

1037
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,250
两点钟回家
Go home at- 00.

1038
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,540
我会洗车、打蜡
I'd wash and wax the car,

1039
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:37,170
她会批改作业、煮饭
然后余下时间都看书

1040
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,090
什么书？
What kind of books?

1041
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,340
她喜欢的书
-Her books.

1042
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,510
我试过看过几本，但…
I tried to read some of them, but...

1043
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
我就是…
I'm just...

1044
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,520
我不喜欢看书
I'm not into books.

1045
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,100
她的朋友说，我俩像白天与黑夜
Her friends said

1046
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:57,690
遇到桑雅前，我的人生是黑白的
My life was black-and-white

1047
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,900
她就是那抹色彩
She was the colour.

1048
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:04,990
我一定会喜欢她
I would have liked her.

1049
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,370
她很有个性
She was a force of nature.

1050
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:10,620
她说服到学校成立特别计划
She convinced the school

1051
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,250
帮助有额外需要的孩子
for the kids that needed extra help.

1052
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:14,540
很多孩子有家庭问题
A lot of kids had problems at home

1053
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:17,710
或社交焦虑
or, uh, social anxieties.

1054
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,090
但当桑雅教过他们之后
But by the time Sonya was done with 'em,

1055
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,760
他们都开始会背莎士比亚了
they were reciting Shakespeare.

1056
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,100
我碰到她的一位学生
I ran into one of her students,

1057
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,350
就在前天
just the other day.

1058
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:35,230
那孩子叫马康
A kid named Malcolm.

1059
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:42,910
你要多些忌廉
You need more cream.

1060
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:44,200
好吧
Okay.

1061
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:52,210
我们刚搬进来时，和街坊相处得很好
We all got along fine, of course,

1062
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,290
像天赐大礼
It was like a gift.

1063
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,250
欢迎搬来这里
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

1064
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,340
- 嗨，我叫桑雅
- 我叫安妮塔

1065
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,010
桑雅和安妮塔是好朋友
Sonya and Anita were best friends.

1066
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,010
所以我拿我的六角扳手…
So I got my Allen keys...

1067
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:05,510
而鲁本和我也很相似
And Reuben and I were a lot alike.

1068
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:06,930
慢点！
Hey! Slow down!

1069
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,890
大部分观点都一样
About most things.

1070
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,640
蠢材
Idiot.

1071
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,480
但人是会变的
But people change.

1072
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,270
或许他们都一成不变
Or they don't change.

1073
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:18,230
有些事发生了，然后人们渐渐疏远
Things happen. People drift apart.

1074
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:21,940
筑起了墙，冒犯了对方
They build walls. They take offence.

1075
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:23,360
（福特）

1076
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,740
谁知道为什么
Who knows why.

1077
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:30,240
或许是那些建筑工程令大家发狂
Maybe it was all the construction

1078
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,210
你知嘛，那座山上曾有片树林
You know, there used to be

1079
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,330
所以这里才叫桦木庄
That's why they call it Birchwood.

1080
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,330
他们开始建那些公寓
Then they started building

1081
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,670
砍掉所有白桦树
and cut down all the birches.

1082
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:41,670
他们根本不知道，直至我们告诉他们
They didn't even realise

1083
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,760
鲁本和我
Reuben and I.

1084
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,010
这是夺位之前发生？
But this was before the coup?

1085
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,850
噢，没错，鲁本和我当时是朋友
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1086
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:51,470
在那之后，我们什么事都有分歧
After that,

1087
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,190
（福特）

1088
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:06,110
（雪佛兰）

1089
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,290
（福特）

1090
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,460
（雪佛兰）

1091
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:26,720
几年后，他们的儿子基斯
接受了一份在日本的工作

1092
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,340
他从此再没回来探望他们
and I don't think

1093
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,510
鲁本和他一直相处不来
-Oh.

1094
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,190
总之，我就在那时决定和解
Anyway, that's when I decided

1095
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,270
鲁本
Reuben.

1096
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,310
嘿
Hey.

1097
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,150
桑雅以前送我这瓶酒
Sonya gave me this a while back.

1098
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,860
从没找到机会去喝
Never found the occasion.

1099
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,870
我想我们或可重新做朋友
I thought maybe we could start fresh.

1100
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:56,210
嘿，你想看我的新车吗？
Hey, would you like to see my new car?

1101
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:58,960
好
Sure.

1102
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,210
是新型号
It's a new model.

1103
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,340
新出的
Just came out.

1104
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:09,010
看啊
Voilà.

1105
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,470
丰田？
A Toyota?

1106
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,970
你买了架丰田
You bought a Toyota.

1107
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,020
Celica GT 开篷车
Celica GT convertible.

1108
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,520
五档自动波
Five-speed automatic.

1109
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,150
你必须与时并进
You gotta change with the times.

1110
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:25,190
奥图！
Otto!

1111
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:31,030
我不知道鲁本发什么疯
但那时候我就知道失去了他

1112
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:33,280
一个人必须坚持他所相信的事
I mean, a man has to stand up

1113
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:36,040
即使那是一架福什么车
Even if it is an F-O-R-D.

1114
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,630
你和桑雅有想过生孩子吗？
And you and Sonya,

1115
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,590
好了，两点了
Well,- 00.

1116
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:52,970
好吧
Okay.

1117
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:55,810
好吧
Yes.

1118
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,810
我想知你今晚可否帮个忙
I was wondering

1119
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,610
我和汤美没太多机会出去约会
Me and Tommy don't get a lot of time

1120
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:07,990
而孩子快要出世
before the baby comes.

1121
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,400
我不会开车送你们去约会
I'm not gonna drive you two

1122
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:13,870
不，我们会坐的士
No. We're gonna take a cab.

1123
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,700
那你需要我做什么？
What do you need me for, then?

1124
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:19,960
- 妈妈，我没有！我为何要那样做？
- 是你！

1125
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,790
- 还给我！
- 你捉我啊！

1126
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:23,710
好了，你两个，拜托
You guys, por favor.

1127
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,760
学会分享你们的一切
And learn to share your everything.

1128
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,640
我不确定做得来
I'm not sure about this.

1129
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,720
不，别傻了，会很好玩的
No. Don't be silly.

1130
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,600
但你要记住
艾比必须在九点前睡，好吗？

1131
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:41,730
没问题？
-You're good?

1132
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,860
好了，警报密码是 4491…4491
So, alarm code, 4491. 4491.

1133
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:50,110
我会设为 “防盗留守”
你有留心吗？

1134
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:51,820
若你想出去
So if you wanna go out,

1135
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,160
只需按这个掣，它就会解除警报
you just have to press this button here,

1136
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,990
我会留在屋里
I'll be right here.

1137
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,330
对，没错
Right. Yeah.

1138
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:01,660
但世事难料
Well, you never know.

1139
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:04,080
- 要对奥图爷爷好一点，好吗？
- 我们会的！

1140
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,630
里面没朱古力奶
I don't see chocolate milk in here.

1141
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:14,470
要用糖浆做
但不要加太多，她会睡不着

1142
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,930
给我牛奶
Give me milk.

1143
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,260
那是什么？
What is that?

1144
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:22,230
烂鬼垃圾洗碗机
That's the goddamn useless dishwasher.

1145
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,480
爸爸说想把它丢出窗口
Dad said he wanted

1146
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,980
但妈妈说不准爸爸再开窗
but Mom said Dad isn't allowed

1147
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,780
头
Head.

1148
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,870
Cabeza
Cabeza.

1149
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,490
- Cabeza

1150
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:41,450
很好
Good.

1151
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,210
眼
Eyes.

1152
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:44,790
Ojos
Ojos.

1153
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:47,380
- Ojos

1154
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:49,880
很好
Good.

1155
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,010
手臂，Brazo
Arm. Brazo.

1156
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:54,340
手臂，Brazo
Arm. Brazo.

1157
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:55,300
很好
Good.

1158
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:03,230
我不认为这是个好主意
I don't think this is a good idea.

1159
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,520
为什么？
Why?

1160
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,480
因为没有人打得赢摔角手
Because no one stands a chance

1161
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,980
摔角手爷爷！
Abuelo Luchadoro!

1162
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:13,150
摔角手爷爷！
Abuelo Luchadoro!

1163
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,070
帮我，帮我
Help me, help me.

1164
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:17,700
等等，是他先出手的
Wait, no, he started it.

1165
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,990
- 准备好？
- 挞死你！

1166
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,710
挞落去，打！打！空手道斩！
Rub it and smack! Smack! Karate chop!

1167
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:32,800
（安第斯大学 玛莉素孟德斯）

1168
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,010
（加州大学 玛莉素孟德斯）
Huh.

1169
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,450
哇，静得离奇，对吧？
Wow, it's awfully quiet, huh?

1170
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:10,630
嘿，各位
-Hey, guys.

1171
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,040
嗨
Hi.

1172
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:13,500
嗨
Hi.

1173
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,960
她睡着了
She was already asleep.

1174
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:19,510
今晚顺利吗？
How was it?

1175
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,310
- 很好
- 你今晚做得很好，奥图

1176
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:24,930
拍拍背赞赞自己
You should pat yourself on the back.

1177
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:36,360
- 谢谢，奥图
- 不客气

1178
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,690
现在退出
Exit now.

1179
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,950
晚安
Have a good night.

1180
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,160
好了
Okay.

1181
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,420
他怎做到的？
How did he do that?

1182
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,180
- 嗨，奥图
- 马康

1183
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:11,020
你换档时，听不到链条响吗？
You can't hear your chain rattle

1184
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,650
- 我的单车很旧了
- 别怪单车

1185
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,650
你只需调你的变速器
You just have to adjust your derailleur.

1186
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,530
- 我的什么？
-你的变速器要调整

1187
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,990
不好意思
Uh, excuse me.

1188
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,830
- 嗨，我是莎莉肯兹
- 嗨

1189
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,080
我是社交媒体记者
I'm a social media journalist.

1190
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:32,330
我想找奥图安达臣
I'm, um, looking for Otto Anderson.

1191
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,420
你确定真的要找他？
Are you sure you wanna do that?

1192
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,090
哇，太好了，犀利
Wow. It's great. That's amazing.

1193
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,350
你好好对它，它也会好好对你
You treat it right, it'll treat you right.

1194
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,270
给你，全套留着吧
Here. Keep the set.

1195
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,470
谢谢，奥图
Thanks, Otto.

1196
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,770
不敢相信我竟然帮你
把垃圾丢到别人的草坪

1197
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,190
两份工作还不够吗？
Isn't two jobs enough?

1198
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,860
我在存钱买车
I'm saving up for a car.

1199
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,280
- 是吗？
- 是啊

1200
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,900
哪款车？
What kind?

1201
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:03,110
大众
Volkswagen.

1202
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,710
小姐，你挡住了车库
Young lady, you're blocking the garage.

1203
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:16,960
安达臣先生？我叫莎莉肯兹
Mr Anderson? My name is Shari Kenzie.

1204
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,550
我是社交媒体记者，我…
I'm a social media journalist, and I--

1205
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,960
那是什么？
What is that?

1206
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:24,640
我有个网上系列叫《平凡英雄》
I have an online series

1207
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,720
你前几天在火车站做的事很了不起
What you did the other day

1208
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,140
你救了那个人一命
You saved that man's life.

1209
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:30,640
你找错人了
You have the wrong guy.

1210
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:35,400
不，我没有
我看过那短片几十次

1211
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,940
- 是你
- 短片？

1212
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,360
你没看过？
You haven't seen it?

1213
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,150
有乘客用手机影低，放了上网
Oh. A commuter recorded what happened

1214
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,950
评论中有人认出你，所以我才追踪到你
Someone in the comments recognised you.

1215
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,950
已超过一百万观看次数
It's gotten over a million views.

1216
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:49,790
一百万？一百万
A million? A million.

1217
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:52,160
为什么人们总爱多管闲事？
Why can't people mind their own business?

1218
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:55,620
因为像你这样的故事令人鼓舞
Because stories like yours are inspiring.

1219
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,840
若我可和你谈几分钟…
If I could just talk to you

1220
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,340
不行，我现在有太多事要做
No, now I've got too many things

1221
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,710
被你救起的人
我帮他录了一段片

1222
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,920
你该看看
You should see this.

1223
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:06,050
- 奥图！嗨！
- 我找找看

1224
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,050
早晨
Good morning.

1225
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:09,970
早晨
Good morning.

1226
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,600
Uh...

1227
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,310
准备好再教我开车了？
-So you ready for another driving lesson?

1228
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,310
- 现在不方便
- 不方便？

1229
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,610
哈罗？嘿，我还在里面！
Hello? Hello? Hey, I'm still in here!

1230
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,400
- 我没锁门
- 哈罗？

1231
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,690
扭门柄，开门
Turn the knob, open the door.

1232
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,070
你以前开过门吧？
-Opened a door before, haven't you?

1233
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,160
蠢材
Idiot.

1234
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,950
奥图！是我
Otto! It's me.

1235
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,120
她走了
She's gone.

1236
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,500
好极，我今早未巡视完
Good. I'm not through with my rounds.

1237
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,960
“社交媒体记者”？
"Social media journalist"?

1238
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,500
那到底是什么鬼？
What the hell does that even mean?

1239
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,420
一群蠢蛋用相机对着自己
Buncha knotheads pointin'

1240
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:47,180
我认为你处理得很好
I thought you handled it really well.

1241
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,300
我指把她关在车库里
I mean, closing her in your garage.

1242
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:53,430
简直是…绝世好计
That was, like, excellent strategy.

1243
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,560
做得好
-Good job.

1244
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,110
奥图，还有我在想
你为我们做了那么多

1245
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,110
- 我也想为你做点事
- 我不需要任何东西

1246
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:08,950
我觉得你有时该好好吃一顿，不是吗？
Well, I think you could do

1247
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,120
那些曲奇…
Those cookies...

1248
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,740
那些什么？传统曲奇？
The what? The "salporanz"?

1249
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,200
那些不太差，不太差
Those are not bad. They're not bad.

1250
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,410
还有，我在想
And, also, I was thinking

1251
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,920
我可帮你清理房子、清理前廊
that I can help you clean out your house

1252
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,380
帮你收起桑雅的外套和鞋子
and help you pack the coats and shoes

1253
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:25,670
不需要
That's not needed.

1254
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:29,510
是没必要，但那可帮你放下
No, but it can help you move on.

1255
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:31,220
我不想放下
I don't wanna move on.

1256
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,140
她会永远在你心里
She's always gonna be with you.

1257
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:35,270
但你还在这里
-But you're still here.

1258
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,480
够了
That's enough.

1259
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:41,610
当我爸去世后
我妈她停止了生活

1260
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:43,860
- 她不再像以前那样…
- 别再说了！

1261
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,280
- 闭嘴
- 好！别呼喝我

1262
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:52,660
为何别人总爱管闲事？蠢材
Why can't people mind

1263
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,120
总是碍着我
Interrupting me at every turn.

1264
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,500
越是口水多多
越覆盖了我对她声音的回忆

1265
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:02,040
我不想把桑雅清出我的生活
I don't want to clear Sonya from my life.

1266
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,500
她就是一切
She was everything.

1267
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:06,340
遇到她之前，我人生一片空白
她过身后也是！

1268
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,380
我也有某种意义
I'm something.

1269
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,050
那混蛋！
That son of a bitch!

1270
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:17,020
不，不行！
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

1271
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,680
Uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh.

1272
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:21,440
停车！你停车！
Stop right there. You stop that car!

1273
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,020
是你没关闸？你没关闸，对吧？
Did you leave that gate open?

1274
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,730
只有你在乎
You're the only one who gives a damn.

1275
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,690
我在乎人们是否守规矩
I give a damn

1276
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:31,150
是，我知道
我知道你的一切

1277
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,990
公司有份你的档案，这么厚
There's a file on you at the office.

1278
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:35,530
我知道你太太的事
I know about your wife.

1279
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,620
你把她的遭遇怪罪所有人
How you blame whatever happened to her

1280
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,700
你收声
You shut up.

1281
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:41,420
你别再多说一个字
Don't you say one more word.

1282
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,590
冷静，奥图
听着，我不是要惹怒你

1283
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:47,960
但你真的不应该独居
but you really shouldn't be living alone.

1284
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:52,720
我意思是，我们了解你
多过你了解自己，所以…

1285
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,550
你好好保重自己的心脏，好吗？
Just look after that heart of yours, okay?

1286
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,930
你知道我的心脏怎么了？
What do you know about my heart?

1287
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,850
嘿，你知道我的心脏怎么了？
Hey, what do you know about my heart?!

1288
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:01,890
你这八卦混蛋！
You prying bastard!

1289
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,190
奥图…奥图
Otto, Otto.

1290
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:07,070
奥图，怎么了？
你还好吗？感觉还好吗？

1291
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:09,230
若你想帮我，就去关闸
You wanna help me, close the gate.

1292
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,580
奥图…奥图
Otto. Otto.

1293
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,710
奥图

1294
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,380
奥图
Otto.

1295
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,640
应应我，奥图
求求你

1296
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:39,060
奥图
Otto.

1297
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:47,270
应应我，奥图
Talk to me, Otto.

1298
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,750
奥图
Otto.

1299
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,580
奥图
Otto.

1300
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,730
谢谢
Thank you.

（尼亚加拉大瀑布）

1302
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:58,260
你戴得很好看
It'll be cute on you.

1303
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,930
- 不
- 来嘛

1304
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:02,470
宝贝，你戴得很好看
Honey, you look really cute.

1306
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,140
手给我
Give me your hand.

1307
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,810
宝宝在踢我
The baby's really kicking.

1308
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:05,070

马康
Malcolm.

I'm not gonna shoot you.

1351
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:32,860

What was that noise?

1352
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:36,070
发电机烧了，停电了

1355
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:43,790
这里不是酒店
This is not a hotel.

1356
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,630
对，我很抱歉
No. I'm sorry.

1357
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:49,380
你为什么不能回家？
Why can't you go home?

1358
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:53,680
我爸赶我走
My dad kicked me out.

1359
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,890
你可以睡梳化
There's a sofa you can use.

1360
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:05,020
不要进饭厅，天花板要修理
Don't go into the dining room.

1361
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,190
梳化在楼上，桑雅的旧书房里
It's upstairs in Sonya's old study.

1362
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:10,070
他为何赶你走？
So why did he kick you out?

1363
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,240
因为你现在是马康？
Because you're Malcolm now?

1364
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,320
是，因为我是马康
Yeah, because I'm Malcolm.

1365
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,490
因为我这样打扮
Because I dress like this.

1366
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,790
我看太多书、不喜欢运动
随你挑个藉口

1367
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:23,040
他觉得羞家，因为我是跨男
He's embarrassed 'cause I'm trans.

1368
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,540
那他就是个蠢材
Then he's an idiot.

1369
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,250
你睡这里
This is you.

1370
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:30,000
尽量不要碰任何东西
Try not to touch anything.

1371
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:31,130
好
Okay.

1372
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,150
好吧
Well...

1373
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:33,780
早晨，仍然无电
Good morning. The power's still out

1374
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:36,400
最后几只蛋要尽快吃，趁未坏
so I cooked up the last of the eggs

1375
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,200
希望你别介意
Hope you don't mind.

1376
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,990
我要去巡视了
I have to do my rounds.

1377
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,830
你不至少喝点咖啡？
Don't you at least want some coffee first?

1378
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:47,580
好
Yes.

1379
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,170
给你
There you go.

1380
01:33:56,670 --> 01:33:57,720
要蛋吗？
Uh, some eggs?

1381
01:33:58,880 --> 01:33:59,970
也好
I wouldn't say no.

1382
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:01,680
好吧
All right.

1383
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:20,860
那个罐
That can...

1384
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,280
放这里
goes in here.

1385
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:27,700
挂起它
Hang that up.

1386
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:36,050
嘿，奥图！在巡视吗？
Hey, Otto! Making your rounds.

1387
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:38,720
我可以跟你走吗？
我要走够步数

1388
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,720
好吧
-Okay.

1389
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:41,680
- 我叫占美
- 马康

1390
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,180
- 幸会
- 谢谢

1391
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:46,930
有证
Yes.

1392
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,680
有证
Yes.

1393
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:52,980
奥图，你可以走慢点
我心跳升了

1394
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,570
有证
Yes.

1395
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:12,620
奥图，你有听说
他们今午要送鲁本去疗养院吗？

1396
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:13,880
谁？
Who is?

1397
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,920
地产那班人
The Dye & Merika guys.

1398
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,130
天啊
-My God.

1399
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,670
他们说服了安妮塔卖屋
They convinced Anita to sell the house.

1400
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,680
不，他们是与基斯做交易
No, they made the deal with Chris.

1401
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,430
- 基斯？他不能那样做
- 他可以

1402
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:27,680
当他们查到安妮塔患柏金逊症
After Dye & Merika found out

1403
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,730
他们便找到了基斯，然后…
they tracked Chris down and--

1404
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:30,930
- 柏金逊症？
- 是啊

1405
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:33,980
所以去年基斯说服安妮塔签授权书
So last year Chris convinced Anita

1406
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:35,360
以防她病情恶化
in case she got worse.

1407
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,440
所以地产公司跟基斯做交易买屋
So Dye & Merika made the deal

1408
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:39,610
那些混帐
Those pricks.

1409
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:44,240
等等，安妮塔去年就知
自己有柏金逊症？

1410
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,030
不，不可能的
No, that's not right.

1411
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,910
她会告诉桑雅，然后桑雅会告诉我
She would've told Sonya.

1412
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,870
嗯…安妮塔和鲁本
不想让你和桑雅知道

1413
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,750
他们说你们已经够多麻烦事
They said you had enough

1414
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,510
他们那样说？
They said that?

1415
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:14,060
我要看你从地产公司收到的所有东西
I need to see everything

1416
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:17,230
通知、信件
你有授权书副本吗？

1417
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:18,940
你怎知道的？
How do you know about that?

1418
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,610
- 你有吗？
- 有

1419
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:21,690
- 去拿
- 好

1420
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:28,580
还有鲁本和你病情的任何纪录
And any records

1421
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:30,450
占美告诉你的？
Did Jimmy tell you that?

1422
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:31,950
现在能拿来吗？
Can you get it now?

1423
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,040
好
Yes.

1424
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,340
我一直是个蠢材
I've been an idiot.

1425
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:45,720
我沉浸于自己的烦恼，没再顾及其他人
I got so wrapped up in my own troubles,

1426
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,140
于是以为别人也不顾及我
And I figured

1427
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,520
朋友之间不应该这样
Friends shouldn't do that.

1428
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,600
所以…
So...

1429
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:56,940
隔了那么久，这句话很难开口
This isn't easy to say

1430
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,110
但我很抱歉
But I'm sorry.

1431
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:04,150
而且我会解决这一切
And I will sort all this out.

1432
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,290
我要用你的电话
I need to use your phone.

1433
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,210
为何不用你自己的？
Why can't you use your own?

1434
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:25,050
我的停用了
Mine is disconnected at the moment.

1435
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,720
- 为什么？
- 那不重要

1436
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,850
我只需要用你的电话，好吗？
I just need to use your phone, okay?

1437
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,060
你知道吗？
You know what?

1438
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,140
不行
No.

1439
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,690
- 不行？
- 不行

1440
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:41,520
你不肯告诉我
为何你的电话停用了？

1441
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:44,940
你不肯告诉我
为何你要用我的电话？

1442
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:48,030
你不肯告诉我
昨天你在街上发生什么事？

1443
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:51,950
然后你返入屋，门都不肯开？
And then you went inside

1444
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:55,450
你吓死我了，奥图
You scared me, Otto.

1445
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:59,250
你知道我在外面等了多久吗？
Do you know how long I was out there?

1446
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:02,290
我不知你是否出了事了
And I didn't know

1447
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:05,800
也不知你会否出事
Or if something was gonna happen to you.

1448
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:10,550
若我不该提起桑雅的外套，我道歉
And I'm sorry if I said

1449
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,050
但我只是想帮忙
But I was just trying to help.

1450
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:16,390
而你却把我关在外面
And you left me out there.

1451
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:21,190
所以不行
你不能用我的电话

1452
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:30,570
你认为你的生活很麻烦
因为人人都是蠢材

1453
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:32,450
一切都要你一力处理，是吗？
and you have to do everything

1454
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:34,990
是吗？
Right?

1455
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:37,330
但你猜怎样？
But guess what.

1456
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,670
只靠自己不行的
You can't.

1457
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:41,920
没有人可以
No one can.

1458
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:45,050
而你该感到高兴
And I think you should just be happy

1459
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:47,380
因为有人肯帮你度过糟糕的一天
that someone was trying

1460
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:50,550
即使他们是蠢材
Even if they're an idiot.

1461
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,050
- 所以…
- 那班地产混蛋

1462
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:57,100
要把安妮塔和鲁本赶走
are trying to force

1463
01:38:57,850 --> 01:38:59,390
所以我要用你的电话
That's why I need to use your phone.

1464
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:04,940
好，好吧，进来
Okay, fine. Come on.

1465
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,330
我们以前从没去过旅行
We had never had a vacation.

1466
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:29,260
桑雅那时候已怀孕六个月
Sonya was six months pregnant.

1467
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:34,220
她想在孩子出生前做些特别的事
And she wanted to do something special

1468
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:37,510
所以我们去尼亚加拉大瀑布旅行
So we booked a trip to Niagara Falls.

1469
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,440
回程时，巴士翻车了
On the way back, the bus crashed.

1470
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:45,690
车厂说过刹车有问题要回收
There'd been a recall on the brake lines,

1471
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:47,820
但那公司从没送修
but the company never had them fixed.

1472
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,860
桑雅瘫痪了…
Sonya was paralyzed...

1473
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:54,450
我们失去了儿子
and we lost our son.

1474
01:39:58,370 --> 01:40:00,790
三个月后，她终于可以回家了
After three months,

1475
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:04,790
但他们已开始建造新公寓
But they had started building

1476
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,090
社区中心和行人路
and the community centre

1477
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:11,300
没一样是为轮椅人士设计
none of which were designed

1478
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:14,800
建造商本可改变计划
The builders could have

1479
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:20,060
但当时没有相关法律
而且他们也不在乎

1480
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,770
我在乎
I did.

1481
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:24,060
我在意
-We're putting in a new playground...

1482
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:28,070
- 有其他地方给你妻子那样的人
- 我当时非常生气

1483
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:31,240
什么意思？
她那样的人？那什么意思？

1484
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,780
- 你想说什么？
- 放开我！

1485
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:38,830
就在那时
他们投票罢免我做业主会主席

1486
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,080
我想把他们全都赶走
I wanted to obliterate them all.

1487
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:46,920
那些建筑商、地产商
还有巴士公司、巴士司机

1488
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,630
我本来绝不罢休
I never would have let it go...

1489
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:51,340
但桑雅不想这样
but for Sonya.

1490
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,550
桑雅说我们要继续生活
Sonya said we had to keep living.

1491
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:58,890
于是我便那样做
That's what I did.

1492
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:01,770
我为桑雅而活
I lived for Sonya.

1493
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:08,020
六个月前，她去世了
Six months ago she passed away.

1494
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:09,900
癌症
Cancer.

1495
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:15,450
我本打算随她一起去
I was going to join her.

1496
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,660
所以我停用了电话
That's why I had them disconnect my phone.

1497
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:25,790
但现在我认为
她希望我继续活下去

1498
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:31,170
而且我还有很多事要做
And I have things to do.

1499
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:38,140
（莎莉肯兹）

1500
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,870
你在浪费时间，奥图
You're wasting your time, Otto.

1501
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:07,410
交易已落实，鲁本要跟我们走
It's a done deal. Reuben's coming with us.

1502
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,540
若你阻拦我们
And if you get in our way,

1503
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:10,880
我会报警拉你
I'll have you arrested.

1504
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,380
- 我什么也没做
- 你别想再踏前

1505
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,050
你不能带走我老公
You are not taking my husband

1506
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:21,300
安妮塔，拜托
我们这样做是为你好

1507
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:24,470
你们是想夺取我的财产
What you're doing

1508
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:28,100
我想鲁本在这里度过余生
I want Reuben to stay right here

1509
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:29,600
（美利健四德疗养部）

1510
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:31,610
和我一起在我们的家里
with me in our home.

1511
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:35,860
好吧，但当你没能力时
谁来照顾鲁本？

1512
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:38,360
谁来照顾你？奥图吗？
Who's gonna take care of you? Otto?

1513
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:41,450
奥图的健康也不是很好
是吗，奥图？

1514
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:43,780
我会照顾好他
I'll take care of 'em.

1515
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:48,580
- 你在做什么？放低手机
- 安妮塔和鲁本就像我的家人

1516
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,420
只要他们有需要，我会一直照顾
I'll take care of them

1517
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,580
他们不是你的家人
They're not your family.

1518
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:56,210
他们的儿子基斯已决定
他们不适合独自生活

1519
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,220
所以我们现在要…
and so what we're doing is--

1520
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:01,640
不好意思
基斯最后一次见父母是几时？

1521
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:05,390
他住在日本，他们已疏远了十年
He lives in Japan.

1522
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:07,770
基斯不会知道他父母的近况
Chris would have no idea

1523
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:09,520
除非你告诉他
except for what you told him.

1524
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,440
你是谁？
Okay. And who are you?

1525
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,400
我叫莎莉肯兹
My name is Shari Kenzie.

1526
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:15,400
社交媒体记者
Social media journalist.

1527
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,650
我们正在现场直播
-We're streaming live right now.

1528
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,780
好了，好了…
关上镜头，你不能拍

1529
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:23,660
这是公共行人路
It's a public sidewalk.

1530
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,990
你告诉安妮塔的儿子基斯
说她有柏金逊症

1531
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:30,870
但安妮塔…
从未对任何人说过她有病

1532
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,040
所以你怎知道的？
So how did you know?

1533
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:35,250
我要查一下纪录
I'd have to check the records.

1534
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:38,960
那边的安达臣先生是本地英雄
Mr Anderson over there

1535
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:44,260
他告诉我，你也知道他的私人健康纪录细节
He tells me you know details

1536
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,140
所以你和公司是如何…
So how are you and your company

1537
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,390
非法取得长者的医疗纪录？
getting illegal access

1538
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:54,060
好了，走吧，我们讲完了，讲完
Okay, let's go. We're done. We're done.

1539
01:43:54,150 --> 01:43:55,900
很高兴认识你们
Very nice to meet you.

1540
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,690
不，你们玩完了！玩完了！
No, you're done. You're done!

1541
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:00,110
- 该死的别再拍我
- 再见

1542
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:02,070
- 我们成功了！
- 成功了！

1543
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,450
拜拜，谢谢！
Bye, thank you!

1544
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:08,450
我在一小时前上传了
安妮塔和基斯的故事

1545
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:11,160
已有几十人回应说
Already dozens of people are saying

1546
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:13,960
美利健四德强迫他们离开家园
Dye & Merika forced them

1547
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:15,790
- 真容易
- 好了，拜拜

1548
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:19,210
如果你有故事
请到我的频道和我分享

1549
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:21,510
我拍到了，我拍到
-I got it. I got it.

1550
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,300
嘿，你忘了关闸！
Hey, you forgot to shut the gate!

1551
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:28,310
看到吗？他立即就投降，他放弃了
You see that?

1552
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:30,600
在我们的年代
那些混蛋至少会抗争一下

1553
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,600
他们还没能赶走我们
They haven't gotten rid of us yet.

1554
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:44,150
是啊
Yeah.

1555
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,450
真痛快，不是吗？
It does feel pretty good. Doesn't it?

1556
01:44:53,790 --> 01:44:56,540
友善的邻居，是否以前才会有？
Neighbourly neighbours,

1557
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:00,710
我在这里与目击者
安妮塔占美一起了解情况

1558
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,920
占美，你提到安妮塔和鲁本
就像你的家人

1559
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:05,680
那到底是什么意思？
What does that mean, exactly?

1560
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,510
我几乎每晚都在他们家吃饭
Well, I have dinner at their house

1561
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:16,230
我知道你在等什么
你准备好吃午餐了，对吗？

1562
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:18,810
我知道你想要什么
I know what you want.

1563
01:45:21,610 --> 01:45:23,150
哇，好了
Whoa. Here we go.

1564
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,860
你们最近搬来这小区，感觉如何？
You moved into this community recently.

1565
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:27,240
这里很美
-How has that been for you?

1566
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:30,160
而你的家人，这里有人可…
And your family,

1567
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,200
是啊
Yeah.

1568
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:32,490
- 奥图？
- 这条片会在墨西哥播吗？

1569
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,160
奥图！
Otto!

1570
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,170
叫救护车！
Call an ambulance!

1571
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:55,640
- 孟德斯女士？你可以见他了
- 好，好的

1572
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:03,110
嗨，奥图爷爷
Hola, Abuelo Otto.

1573
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,040
孟德斯女士？
Ms Mendes?

1574
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:21,040
我是艾莉斯医生
I'm Dr Ellis.

1575
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:23,210
安达臣先生把你列为近亲
Mr Anderson listed you as next of kin.

1576
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:26,840
是，是的，没错
Yes. Yes, that's correct.

1577
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,010
你叔叔差点丧命
他有跟你说过他的情况吗？

1578
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,140
Mm...

1579
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:33,970
不，不算有，没有
No, not really. No.

1580
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:36,560
那叫肥厚型心肌病
It's called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

1581
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,770
基本上说，他的心太大了
Basically, his heart is too big.

1582
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,400
太大？
Too big?

1583
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:44,480
Mm-hm.

1584
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:46,690
噢，好吧
Oh, okay.

1585
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:48,700
Oh.

1586
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:56,870
对不起，我没事
No, sorry. It's okay.

1587
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:10,970
你真的同死神唔夹，你知道嘛
You're really bad at dying, you know that?

1588
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:18,600
Ay.

1589
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:23,940
奥图，我好像要生了
Otto, I think it's time.

1590
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:26,980
好像要生了
I think it's time.

1591
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,440
要生了
It's time.

1592
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:32,570
我是心脏科医生，我帮你叫产科
Oh, uh, I'm a cardiologist.

1593
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:39,160
快想办法，因为…要生了！
Do something. It's time!

1594
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,000
（男孩！）

1595
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:48,670
好了，准备？
All right, ready?

1596
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:50,590
好了，各位影相！
All right, picture, everybody!

1597
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,220
影相！影相！
Picture, picture, picture.

1598
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,980
好了，准备好？
各位说“马可”

1599
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:03,600
一、二、三
One, two, three.

1600
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:06,650
马可！
Marco!

1601
