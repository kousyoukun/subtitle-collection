That way, we can control
the situation.

-That's correct.

-What does she know?
-Well, we gotta find out.

The good news is she got custody
of her child illegally, so she's vulnerable.

Vulnerable isn't good enough.

I'll see you tomorrow.

-Evening, everybody.
-Shit!

-Where you can't get her.

Is that ever the wrong answer.
Bring her to me now!

The judge is dead.

960
01:01:40,172 --> 01:01:42,009

to take your life?

you'll lose her forever.
