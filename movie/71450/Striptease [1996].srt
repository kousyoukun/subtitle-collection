1
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:59,892
Always considering
the best interest...

2
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:01,770
..and well-being of the child.

3
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:04,042
Therefore, you may make visitation..

4
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:06,931
..every other week
and Christmas Eve..

5
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,970
..and on Easter Sunday,
wearing your pretty Easter outfits.

6
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:14,280
Your honor, my ex-husband is addicted
to pills and he's a thief!

7
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:18,405
Because of his record, I lost
my job as a secretary for the FBI.

8
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:21,212
He was the finest high-school
tailback I ever saw.

9
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:24,963
Of course he's had his run-ins
with the law, but he's..

10
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:27,407
..made his accommodations
with the authorities.

11
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:30,121
Being an informer
for the vice squad..

12
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:33,364
..hardly qualifies him
to raise a seven-year-old!

13
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:35,762
Neither does being
a mother without a job!

14
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,287
But I lost it because of him!

15
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,765
Little lady..

16
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:42,803
..my decision is final.

17
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,691
Next case.

18
00:02:12,772 --> 00:02:13,887
The big man's here!

19
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,686
-When does she go on?
-Pretty soon, Jerry.

20
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:20,890
-Welcome to Eager Beaver, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

21
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:25,290
Keep it close.

22
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:28,491
-Keep it very close.
-You got it.

23
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:31,483
Last stop, okay?

24
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:35,890
-What do you say, congressman?
-Poontang.

25
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:38,686
The night is young
and full of promise, my boy.

26
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,291
Great!

27
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:47,528
Now look, this has to be
the last one. Now I told-

28
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:51,481
Come on!
We got a rehearsal tomorrow.

29
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:57,892
Melissa thinks I am in temple.
What if she calls?

30
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:17,562
We have got the legendary
twin temples from Fort Lauderdale.

31
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:21,887
Miss Urbana Sprawl wrapping up
on the great stage.

32
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:34,488
Nice spot, isn't it, Erb?

33
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,410
It's very uplifting, sir.

34
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:43,481
-Jerry, the usual Evian with lime?
-Please.

35
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,520
From Paris, France..

36
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:48,764
..put it together
for the fabulous Monique, Jr. !

37
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:04,484
Oh, my God. I love you!

38
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,608
That song is killing me!

39
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:20,242
Those babies going to wind up in traction,
you don't play some ballads.

40
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:21,646
God, it's freezing!

41
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:25,891
They could store meat in here.
In fact, they do store meat in here.

42
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,043
No, I have been trying all day!

43
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:30,083
Are you positive?

44
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:31,731
No, thank you.

45
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,725
-Can't reach her?
-Darrell's phone's out of order.

46
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:39,521
I just know he's moved with her
again to some new dump.

47
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,842
God, what a nightmare!

48
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:45,283
He drives around with her in that van.
Drinking, taking pills...

49
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:47,887
He doesn't even think about
putting a seat belt on her.

50
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:50,930
He's a dirtbag!
You hang in there, honey.

51
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,321
You will get Angela back.

52
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,130
That judge will see the light.

53
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:56,522
It's expensive light,
I will tell you that.

54
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,888
It's going to cost me $15,000
for this appeal.

55
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:01,765
Is there even a chance
I can make that in six weeks?

56
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:05,885
You will have to dance day and night
and hope some Arab sheik shows up.

57
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:09,886
I love you, girls, I do. But I can't
work here when I go back to court.

58
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:14,085
"Your honor, I found a new job.
I am working at the Eager Beaver."

59
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:16,687
It's honest work.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

60
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:20,289
I know that and you know that.
But the judge won't.

61
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:22,084
Not him.

62
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:29,770
God, I still get nauseous
before I have to go out there.

63
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:31,560
You will get over it.

64
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:35,285
Really? I can't imagine that.

65
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:46,283
You guys having a good time?

66
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:47,766
Here's the lucky guy!

67
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:50,401
You have come to the right place.
Monique!

68
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:52,290
Look at these hunks!

69
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:54,164
We're having a party!

70
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:01,686
Keep an eye on them bachelors.

71
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:07,365
They look like real trouble.

72
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:34,162
It's time to strap yourselves in
because you are going for a ride!

73
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:36,445
In her eighth week here..

74
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:39,923
..put your hands together
and make her feel good.

75
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:42,811
For the one, the only Erin Grant!

76
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:45,122
How about that!

77
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,727
-Larry King's at table six.
-What's he wearing?

78
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:50,810
-Tank top and gold chains
-That's Larry, all right.

79
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:56,201
-How do I look?
-Better than me.

80
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:59,046
That ain't easy.
You talk to her?

81
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:02,092
Darrell's phone's out of order.
I think he moved again.

82
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:05,324
I'd embrace the opportunity
to maim his white ass up.

83
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:09,688
That's really thoughtful, but I
don't think it'd help me in court.

84
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:12,770
Erin, come on.
I can't have an empty stage.

85
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:14,405
Man, let the chumps wait!

86
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,244
Going to the head.

87
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:22,044
You will behave?

88
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:11,570
An angel appeared.

89
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:16,330
An angel of pure delight.

90
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:51,120
Go, Paul!

91
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:54,125
I am getting married
this weekend to Melissa.

92
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:55,727
You love her?

93
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:58,361
-Very much.
-Then go home to her.

94
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:01,690
Shad!

95
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,690
Shad!

96
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:11,202
Listen up! The Flesh Farm
is killing us and you know why?

97
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:13,647
-They have free buffalo wings.
-Their girls are hookers.

98
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:16,087
No, because their girls dance fast.

99
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:18,846
And fast means sweat.
And sweat..

100
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:20,321
..means drinking!

101
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:24,007
Oh, my God!

102
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:26,768
What was that?

103
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:30,931
I got this.

104
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,363
Coming through.
Move out of the way.

105
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,205
Way to go, Davey!

106
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:54,090
Back up! Back the hell up!

107
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:56,810
-You all right?
-Fine. How about this guy?

108
00:10:57,092 --> 00:11:00,084
Good thing he was drunk.
You could have gotten hurt.

109
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:02,880
On the main stage,
our lost little pussycat.

110
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:07,529
Put your hands together for the one,
the only Miss Sabrina Hepburn!

111
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:09,364
Meow!

112
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:25,332
I leave you alone for five minutes!

113
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:28,405
Will you get in?
Watch your foot, stupid.

114
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:31,883
Malcolm's going to shit a brick.
Thank you.

115
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:33,321
Did I touch any girls?

116
00:11:33,572 --> 00:11:36,086
Not this time,
but you were recognized.

117
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,203
Okay? Happy?

118
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:53,086
-How are you, little angel?
-I am fine, thank you.

119
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:56,090
-Kids just tear me up.
-She's a brave one.

120
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:58,408
You will be in my prayers.

121
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,688
God bless you, ma'am.

122
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:15,687
Last stop, little 'un.

123
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:17,681
Daddy, you're mean!

124
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:20,810
Evers and Jennings.
This is the new model, the X12.

125
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,800
-You're happy?
-Oh, mucho happy.

126
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,283
-Mucho happy?
-Get in the van.

127
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:28,130
Mucho, mucho, mucho !

128
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:32,086
Get in. We're in a loading zone.
We don't want to break the law.

129
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:36,052
Daddy, did you tell Mommy
that we moved?

130
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,282
Of course I did, buttercup.

131
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:41,811
Of course I did.

132
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:48,890
How about a wine cooler, Erin?

133
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:50,605
I got mango, passion fruit-

134
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:54,481
Water would be just fine,
Alberto. Thanks.

135
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:57,924
Rita, the reason I stopped by
is Darrell's moved again..

136
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:00,163
..and I need his new phone number.

137
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:03,162
Yeah? Well, you come
to the wrong place.

138
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:06,290
I hardly sleep nights
and then I break out into-

139
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:10,162
Look, Erin, I got no idea
where our brother is, okay?

140
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:13,090
Shit! They got the cat!

141
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:14,526
Wolves got no restraint.

142
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:17,081
-Careful, sweetie.
-Shut up!

143
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,963
She's all caught up with them cubs.

144
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:24,923
Some of the guys down
at the nuclear plant..

145
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:29,211
..they were asking me
if you'd do, like..

146
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:30,891
..private parties.

147
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:32,561
I don't think so.

148
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,848
Oh, that's a shame.

149
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:38,687
Because I will bet that
you are a great dancer.

150
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:41,929
Alberto, I will go crazy if
I don't get Darrell's new number.

151
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:45,050
I promised Angie I would
call her every day and-

152
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:46,526
I hear he moved, Darrell.

153
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,251
Alberto, where is he?

154
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:50,968
You have to ask Rita about that.

155
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:55,960
He calls here about twice a week.
Collect.

156
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:58,328
Need money, as usual..

157
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,130
..but he don't speak to me.

158
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,409
Got no respect for me
even though I am..

159
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,882
..a professional man.

160
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,728
You're looking real good.

161
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,883
Oh, God, I have got such a headache.

162
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:12,850
Oh, yeah?
You want some Advil?

163
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:15,488
That would be so great.

164
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,085
Well now, you sit right here.

165
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:20,563
I am going to fix up
that mean old headache.

166
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:37,888
Never mind. I have got to run,
but thanks anyhow.

167
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,645
Deerfield Beach?

168
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:56,527
We had a good day, baby.

169
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,888
Phone's ringing.
Think it's Mama?

170
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:03,483
No, little 'un. I talked to her
and she's too busy to call you.

171
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:13,847
Damn him!

172
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,842
Nice leg.
Maybe I will take it home.

173
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:42,201
I recommend you let go.

174
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:44,170
Here's 500, baby.

175
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:45,361
What'd you say?

176
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:11,727
What's with Princess Di tonight?

177
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:14,202
Her husband disappeared
with the kid again.

178
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:58,291
I don't suppose you'd
accept this in appreciation.

179
00:18:58,532 --> 00:18:59,885
No need.

180
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:02,885
Senor Cucaracha
here is going to make me rich.

181
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:05,327
Oh, my God!

182
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:06,891
Is that a roach?

183
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,925
No, it's a fucking shrimp.
Move, you're in my light.

184
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:15,685
Get some manners, mister!

185
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:20,010
So this is the new brainstorm?

186
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:24,325
The Wall Street Journal says
this is the hottest-selling yogurt.

187
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:25,687
I will bring this in..

188
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,526
..say my hair fell off
from the shock. Boom.

189
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:30,330
They pay off bigtime.

190
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:32,528
Lawyer thinks it's a genius idea.

191
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,491
Your lawyer has an office
over a video store.

192
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:39,563
Call me a dreamer.
I don't want to be a bouncer forever.

193
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,123
Erin! Note from Jerry!

194
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,883
What did it say?

195
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,488
"Dearest Erin: I can help you
get your daughter back.

196
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,490
I ask nothing in return
but a kind smile."

197
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:54,687
Yeah, right!

198
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:55,688
He's a weirdo.

199
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:58,526
You guys!
He is totally harmless.

200
00:19:58,772 --> 00:19:59,841
Come on!

201
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:03,368
"Also, could you add
Kenny G to your routine?

202
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:05,489
Anything from his Christmas album."

203
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:06,926
That's sweet.

204
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,969
We could do a Christmas show here!

205
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:12,489
Seriously, it couldn't hurt
to talk to him, right?

206
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:15,850
-Only talking, no touching.
-Ladies! Attention!

207
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:18,722
-Major announcement.
-Major asshole.

208
00:20:18,972 --> 00:20:20,121
I heard that.

209
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:23,523
On Monday, I am installing a ring.

210
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:25,528
Mud wrestling?

211
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:28,002
This is something
that's really happening.

212
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:30,129
It's contemporary. It's now.

213
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:32,522
And it's creamed-corn wrestling.

214
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:33,966
-Corn?
-Corn wrestling?

215
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:35,651
That's disgusting!

216
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:38,491
I am not putting these in corn.
No way!

217
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:40,529
What?
No, it's terrific!

218
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,524
In Israel, we did falafel wrestling.

219
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:45,525
All the girls broke out
in hives everywhere.

220
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,125
And I mean, everywhere!

221
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,602
Well, falafel, sure.
This is corn!

222
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:53,480
-What is this, a mutiny?
-I don't think so.

223
00:20:54,012 --> 00:20:57,084
No chance that I am going to roll
around naked in creamed corn..

224
00:20:57,292 --> 00:21:00,728
..with drunken yahoos trying
to stick niblets up my hoo-hah.

225
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:03,532
Not naked. Topless.

226
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:05,922
Health Department won't go for naked.

227
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:07,241
Not with food products.

228
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:09,483
I always liked the Health Department.

229
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:10,881
So you will think about it?

230
00:21:11,132 --> 00:21:12,645
-Not for one second.
-Erin!

231
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:13,722
Please!

232
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,809
You're getting a big following here.

233
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:18,407
Even with that shit music,
the guys love you.

234
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:23,050
You go into the corn, you set
a great example to the other girls.

235
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:28,248
I got it!

236
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:30,922
How about pasta wrestling?

237
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:32,207
Now, that's classy.

238
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:35,728
Linguine, rigatoni?
Just nothing with meat or fish.

239
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:39,325
Orly, if I wanted to wrestle..

240
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:42,484
..I would have joined
the World Wrestling Federation.

241
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:47,650
-And speaking of real class?
-What's the problem?

242
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:48,682
We hate these.

243
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,890
They degrade women and beavers.

244
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:55,642
I will take it under advisement.
But just the coasters and the napkins.

245
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:58,207
Not the sign.
That's a landmark!

246
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:02,484
Good night, darling .

247
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:13,127
For you, Miss Grant.

248
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:17,288
They're beautiful, Jerry.
Thank you.

249
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:18,527
You can call me Erin-

250
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,002
I can't.
I worship you too much.

251
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:23,130
Believe me..

252
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:25,488
..I am no one to be worshiped.

253
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:27,523
I am just trying to make a living.

254
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,091
I worship your essence.

255
00:22:30,052 --> 00:22:32,441
If you were a nurse or a teacher,
I'd feel the same.

256
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:33,807
You receive my note?

257
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:38,205
I did and, you know, I was wondering
what you had in mind.

258
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:41,290
I believe I can help you
get your daughter back.

259
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:44,046
I believe I can
get to Judge Fingerhut.

260
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:47,566
-How?
-Through..

261
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:51,521
..a certain congressman who
I am certain will listen to me..

262
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:54,010
..because I know some things.

263
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:57,525
Things? Really?

264
00:22:57,772 --> 00:23:01,082
Well, you know what, Jerry?
You're really a terrific guy..

265
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:04,005
..and so supportive of me
ever since I started here.

266
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:05,685
Maybe you shouldn't-

267
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:08,084
Just give me a week.

268
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:11,571
Good night, my precious.

269
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:24,089
Melissa thinks I was in synagogue
the night this happened.

270
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:25,930
What do I tell her?

271
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,687
You left synagogue and a gang
of skinheads jumped you.

272
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:32,685
In the meantime, we will develop these,
we will see what we have.

273
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:36,083
I see mucho damages. These strip
joints are insured up the ass.

274
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,487
My neck really feels better,
Uncle Al.

275
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:40,131
Oh, yeah?

276
00:23:40,972 --> 00:23:42,690
How's it feel now?

277
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:51,764
Call Little Caesar's.

278
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:54,287
Order me a health pizza.
Get some for yourself.

279
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:56,124
No, thank you, sir.
I am dieting.

280
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:58,681
I will just grab a yogurt
out of the fridge.

281
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,090
This is a major disaster!

282
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:33,170
Major. Unbelievable.
Without doubt..

283
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:37,684
..the most asinine piece
of human behavior.

284
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:40,923
It's never going to
happen again, Malcolm.

285
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:42,730
I have got it under control.

286
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:44,681
You see..

287
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:47,924
..I just love naked women.
It's a character flaw.

288
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:49,161
God's testing me-

289
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:52,324
Oh, will you shut up!
You idiot.

290
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:56,127
You can't talk to me like that.
I am a U.S. congressman.

291
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:57,128
I can't?

292
00:24:57,572 --> 00:24:59,847
You go psycho in a titty bar
six weeks before the election.

293
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:03,283
What should I call you?
Winston fucking Churchill?

294
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:04,687
It was all I could do to keep..

295
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:08,607
..Willie Rojo from strangling you
with his bare hands.

296
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:10,126
Everybody has a bad night.

297
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:13,887
If you're under pressure like we are,
under the public eye-

298
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:17,283
Who recognized me?

299
00:25:17,972 --> 00:25:19,485
His name..

300
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:21,683
..is Jerry Killian.

301
00:25:21,972 --> 00:25:25,089
And he's waiting outside.

302
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,088
Now?

303
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:31,086
Now. We got to move on this
before we get eaten alive.

304
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:32,327
Move on what?

305
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,291
If this is a shakedown,
get Willie to pay them like always.

306
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:39,571
-Why drag me into it-
-Because it's not about money.

307
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:41,848
-It's not?
-No.

308
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:46,525
He wants you to persuade
Judge Fingerhut..

309
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:50,481
..to reverse a child custody case
for some stripper.

310
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,441
Who he's porking?

311
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,650
It's disgraceful to have
a man like me deal with--

312
00:25:56,532 --> 00:25:57,681
He's not porking her.

313
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:01,963
Well, then, why does he care?

314
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:04,282
Because he's nuts!

315
00:26:05,492 --> 00:26:06,686
That's why he's dangerous.

316
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,130
If he was porking her, at least
I could deal with him man to man..

317
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:12,964
..but this is fruitcake love.

318
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:20,685
I mean, Fingerhut's a democrat.
He won't listen to me.

319
00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:23,565
You can't say that
to this little creep, Davey.

320
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:25,883
You got to string him along.

321
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:27,684
Bullshit him.

322
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:30,963
Use the old..

323
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,924
..Dilbeck charm.

324
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,325
What if he doesn't go for it?

325
00:26:40,572 --> 00:26:42,847
Then we have a serious problem.

326
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,090
Mr. Killian!

327
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:52,804
Come in and meet
Congressman Dilbeck.

328
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:59,651
I will bet that's Jerry Killian.

329
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,690
Lucy!

330
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:06,285
Come here.

331
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,685
Come on.

332
00:27:10,132 --> 00:27:12,487
How perfect is this?

333
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:16,282
You know, I was just thinking..

334
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:20,881
..is this really on
the same planet as Miami?

335
00:27:23,972 --> 00:27:25,883
I can read.

336
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:28,930
Where's Andy?

337
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:31,811
He's been fishing since eight.

338
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:33,485
Dad!

339
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,291
Dad!

340
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:37,441
There's a floater!

341
00:27:52,452 --> 00:27:54,124
He's still got his glasses on.

342
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,485
Go tell Mom to call the police.

343
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:01,486
-You're the police.
-I am the Miami police.

344
00:28:01,692 --> 00:28:03,603
We just need the local law here.

345
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:05,285
Go on.

346
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:13,086
Man!

347
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:17,569
Of all the lakes..

348
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:20,088
..in all the counties..

349
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:21,691
..in all the world..

350
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,887
..you got to float up in mine.

351
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:28,211
You son of a bitch.

352
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:31,125
Mama!

353
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:33,730
Hey, come here!

354
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:35,883
I have been trying to reach you, baby.

355
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,600
Heard you stole my sister's mail!

356
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,683
That's a federal offense.

357
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:43,486
Wait for Mommy.
I am going to go talk to Daddy.

358
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:50,009
Why do you keep moving?
How will she make any friends?

359
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:51,571
Aren't we the child psych-

360
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,809
It has nothing to do with child
psychology, you moron!

361
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:56,531
Where's she going to school?

362
00:28:56,772 --> 00:29:00,287
Opa Locka? Deerfield Beach?
Have you even thought about it?

363
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:03,127
Yeah, I thought about it plenty.

364
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:08,083
Hey, you only got two hours!

365
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:11,045
That's what the judge ruled
right there from that bench!

366
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:15,080
I will be right behind you just in case
you're thinking about snatching her!

367
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,886
Mommy, does "snatch" mean "kidnap"?

368
00:29:18,372 --> 00:29:20,488
How did you get so smart?

369
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:38,883
Is Free Willy back yet?

370
00:29:40,372 --> 00:29:41,885
Still out.

371
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:47,251
People are pigs.
Sit on movies like they own them.

372
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:49,603
Freak.

373
00:29:56,372 --> 00:29:58,681
It's Shad. Open up.

374
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,924
It wasn't me. It was a temp.

375
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:02,730
Where's Perry Mason?

376
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:06,885
Our good friend, Mr. Shad!
Come on in, we have lots to discuss.

377
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:08,884
No shit.

378
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:14,767
If I buzz twice, you say my mother's
on the line. She has chest pains.

379
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:17,406
What do you mean
he's a wheelchair salesman?

380
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:19,768
There's one nice thing about hospitals.

381
00:30:20,012 --> 00:30:23,766
A lot of kids in chairs are
really sick, and I wave at them..

382
00:30:24,012 --> 00:30:26,242
..and they smile
just like on Jerry Lewis.

383
00:30:26,452 --> 00:30:29,922
-And do you do this every day?
-On Fridays I stay with Aunt Rita.

384
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:32,245
That's a wholesome environment.

385
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:33,931
She has real wolves.

386
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:36,561
I don't want you
touching those animals.

387
00:30:36,812 --> 00:30:39,007
They're not like dogs.

388
00:30:47,892 --> 00:30:49,325
Time.

389
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:51,924
Time.

390
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:55,007
I love you more than
anything in the world.

391
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:56,924
You know that in your heart.

392
00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:58,880
-Mommy?
-What, baby?

393
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:01,322
Do you know those dolls you got me?

394
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:04,366
Daddy says he can't
find them anywhere.

395
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:07,568
We will get you new ones.

396
00:31:08,012 --> 00:31:10,685
-I love you.
-Bye, baby. I love you.

397
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:12,126
Hey, let's go!

398
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,525
All right, you go on.
I will bring your stuff.

399
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:25,006
Hey, baby!
Did you have a good day?

400
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:27,331
Good.

401
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:34,290
She told me about your new profession.
Really admirable.

402
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:35,681
At least I ain't naked.

403
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:37,126
"At least I ain't naked"?

404
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:39,368
You get caught using
that child in a felony..

405
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:43,127
-..and Family Services will put her-
-No way I'd get caught.

406
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:47,721
Got me one of them doctor's
jackets and a stethoscope.

407
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:51,644
Look like one of them dudes on ER.

408
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:55,328
Darrell, would you think
for once in your life?

409
00:31:57,612 --> 00:32:00,729
I don't need no stripper
telling me how to behave.

410
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:03,203
I will see you in two weeks.

411
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:09,925
You ready?

412
00:32:29,692 --> 00:32:30,841
You know where that was taken?

413
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:32,725
Your mama's birthday party.

414
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:37,204
The Eager Beaver.
Can you identify those people?

415
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:39,962
Yeah, this old fool. Erin.

416
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:41,401
Erin's the stripper?

417
00:32:41,852 --> 00:32:42,648
What'd you say?

418
00:32:43,572 --> 00:32:45,324
Erin's the stripper.

419
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:46,528
Dancer, fat ass.

420
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:48,166
She's a dancer!

421
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:54,561
The young man who was
so savagely beaten..

422
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:57,121
..is my client, Paul Guber.

423
00:32:57,612 --> 00:32:59,568
No shit. Too bad for him.

424
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:01,561
I don't think so.

425
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:04,326
The third person in that photo
is none other than..

426
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:07,046
..David L. Dilbeck.

427
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:09,931
So what?

428
00:33:10,732 --> 00:33:13,121
Do you follow politics, Mr. Shad?

429
00:33:14,532 --> 00:33:16,762
Do I look like I follow politics?

430
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:19,162
David Dilbeck is
the U.S. congressman..

431
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:22,290
..from the fifth district.
He's up for reelection soon.

432
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:25,522
You going to put the squeeze on him.

433
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,690
Nice.
What that got to do with me?

434
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,527
I will give you 10% of the squeeze.

435
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:40,440
Is this conceivably
as big as the yogurt deal?

436
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,325
"As big"?

437
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:48,609
Congressman Dilbeck is chairman
of the subcommittee on sugar, okay?

438
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,127
The Rojo family cannot
allow him to lose.

439
00:33:51,372 --> 00:33:55,888
Because their price supports are worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

440
00:33:56,132 --> 00:33:57,804
And quite frankly, Mr. Shad..

441
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:01,531
..this is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

442
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,560
Good.

443
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:06,806
Just keep Erin out of it.

444
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,081
I will do my best.

445
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:11,044
She's out. Erin is out.
Erin who?

446
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:23,281
Charming spot.

447
00:34:23,532 --> 00:34:25,170
Look. Steven Spielberg's house.

448
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:29,325
I wish he'd come in here.
I am sure he would have big hots for me.

449
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:31,170
You'd turn his whole life around.

450
00:34:31,412 --> 00:34:35,564
Steven Spielberg's shower. Can you
imagine me and him in that shower?

451
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:39,327
-Oh, that cute little beard!
-Yours or his?

452
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:45,251
Hey, Jerry, it's Erin Grant.
What a long beep.

453
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:47,323
Someone's waiting for you.

454
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:49,204
Maybe you're out of town...

455
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:53,206
I am just calling to see about
that legal matter we discussed.

456
00:34:53,452 --> 00:34:56,524
If you get a chance,
just give me a call at the club.

457
00:34:56,772 --> 00:34:58,330
Thanks, bye.

458
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:02,401
-Michael Jordan's at table eight!
-Great.

459
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:05,849
Say hello to
the fantastic Monique, Jr. !

460
00:35:13,132 --> 00:35:15,965
Lieutenant Garcia with homicide.

461
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:17,725
What's he want with Erin?

462
00:35:17,972 --> 00:35:19,644
Got no idea.

463
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:21,610
All I need is scandal.

464
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:32,604
What do you know about Prozac?

465
00:35:33,612 --> 00:35:36,490
It makes you happy.
There's side effects.

466
00:35:36,972 --> 00:35:37,768
Like what?

467
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:39,962
Limp noodle.

468
00:35:40,812 --> 00:35:42,131
Who cares?

469
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:45,728
I haven't had a hard-on
since I started running this place.

470
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:49,130
Closest I got was Sea World.

471
00:35:49,692 --> 00:35:51,922
Porpoise got me hot.

472
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:56,131
What the fuck
you telling me that for?

473
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:02,129
I am going next door.
See what Ling's up to.

474
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,324
Drowned?

475
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:10,366
Oh, my God.

476
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:13,524
He had pictures of you
all over his apartment.

477
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:18,130
He was a really big fan.
He used to bring me flowers-

478
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:21,330
He was just a fan?
There was no touching?

479
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:24,170
This has been a real pleasure.

480
00:36:24,372 --> 00:36:26,169
I dance so I must turn tricks.

481
00:36:26,372 --> 00:36:29,887
Nice way to open a conversation.
"I understand you're a hooker?"

482
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:32,242
You don't work in a library here.

483
00:36:33,612 --> 00:36:35,489
I am trying to figure out
the man's life.

484
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:37,324
He was a customer.

485
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:40,245
That's all I know about his life.
Except that it's over.

486
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:43,130
I apologize.

487
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:46,444
Sincerely. Look, I am real-
I am nowhere on this.

488
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:49,001
I could use some-
Please give me a minute?

489
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:52,567
Please?

490
00:36:56,812 --> 00:36:59,280
-So where did this happen?
-Lake Okeechobee.

491
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:04,287
It's where I made the serious
mistake of taking my vacation.

492
00:37:07,532 --> 00:37:08,328
Your family?

493
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:09,802
Nice.

494
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:16,320
It's not the kind of place
you'd expect to encounter a homicide.

495
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:19,330
-Homicide? You said he drowned.
-No, we did an autopsy.

496
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:23,407
The water in his lungs,
they come up clean.

497
00:37:23,652 --> 00:37:25,210
There was tap water in his lungs?

498
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,208
Exactly.

499
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,967
Somebody killed him, like in a bathtub,
then dumped the body in a lake.

500
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:31,727
Do you read mysteries?

501
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,887
Up till three months ago,
I worked at the FBl in Miami.

502
00:37:36,692 --> 00:37:37,488
A secretary.

503
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:40,761
Until I got fired
for having a defective husband.

504
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:48,130
I am in a pretty bad custody fight.
Jerry was trying to help me.

505
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:50,169
From the shores of the Dead Sea..

506
00:37:50,412 --> 00:37:52,562
..a decorated nurse
in the Israeli army..

507
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:57,249
..say shalom to
the fabulous Ariel Sharon!

508
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:11,924
Could we go outside?
I could really use some air.

509
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:10,726
Oh, Mr. Orly!
What a wonderful surprise.

510
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:13,247
Nice to be in quality club, eh?

511
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:15,687
Yeah, if you like freak shows.

512
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:17,730
Ling! Ling!
Get over here!

513
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:19,087
Move it!

514
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:20,645
Excuse me. I am sorry.

515
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,689
But that's Mr. Chris Rojo..

516
00:39:22,892 --> 00:39:24,769
..of the sugar Rojos.

517
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:28,049
Typical of the kind
of rich big shots we get here.

518
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:48,526
Is this the place
where I met my angel?

519
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:51,367
I don't know which angel
you're referring to.

520
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,447
A congressman?

521
00:39:57,732 --> 00:39:59,324
You mean a U.S. congressman?

522
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:01,602
Well, he wasn't specific who it was.

523
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:03,171
I told him it was bananas..

524
00:40:03,412 --> 00:40:06,324
..and maybe it was better
that he stayed out of it.

525
00:40:07,332 --> 00:40:09,766
On Wednesday, there was an incident,
a guy with a bottle-

526
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:14,324
Oh, he was a total whack job.
Drunk out of his mind.

527
00:40:15,172 --> 00:40:17,527
Can you remember,
was Mr. Killian here?

528
00:40:18,412 --> 00:40:20,004
No, not offhand, but maybe.

529
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:23,722
Think about that and let me know.
Here's all my numbers.

530
00:40:24,332 --> 00:40:27,244
Once again, I apologize.
I mean, for any aspersions.

531
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:33,123
You want to make it up to me?

532
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:34,368
I beg your pardon?

533
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,040
I need a favor.

534
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:38,408
You have got friends on the vice squad?

535
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:40,131
They're not my bosom buddies.

536
00:40:40,332 --> 00:40:42,004
My ex-husband's an informant.

537
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:44,402
It's why this idiot judge
gave him custody.

538
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,529
-Are you joking?
-I wish.

539
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:50,765
But I was thinking,
if vice dumped him as an informer..

540
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:53,480
..when my appeal
came up in six weeks..

541
00:40:53,732 --> 00:40:56,644
..I could then say
my ex-husband is unfit.

542
00:40:56,892 --> 00:41:00,328
-He's such a criminal-
-Wait a minute. He's a criminal?

543
00:41:00,612 --> 00:41:02,568
Your ex? He's a criminal?

544
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:07,169
He steals wheelchairs.
Thank you very much.

545
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:11,923
All right, let me see what I can do.

546
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:13,128
Good night.

547
00:41:13,372 --> 00:41:15,681
You know, not having her around..

548
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:18,250
..it's like my heart is missing.

549
00:41:18,692 --> 00:41:20,523
I am sure.

550
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:23,330
Let me see what I can do.

551
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:24,808
Good night.

552
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,125
Good night.

553
00:41:42,892 --> 00:41:44,166
How much you pay them?

554
00:41:45,412 --> 00:41:47,243
I think they're up to $30 a day.

555
00:41:47,492 --> 00:41:49,767
Subtract room and board,
booze and smokes.

556
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:52,731
You know, who knows?
Maybe they pay us!

557
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:56,688
-Hell of a business.
-It's the best!

558
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,763
We got to protect it,
my friend, right?

559
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:03,127
Son, I have been protecting
your family for 20 years.

560
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:05,050
You're the greatest, man!

561
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:07,806
I am saying, until the election,
no more girls, huh?

562
00:42:08,412 --> 00:42:10,209
Bring your wife down here
for a weekend.

563
00:42:10,452 --> 00:42:11,362
What's her name?
Alice?

564
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,568
Mary Pat. Mary Pat.

565
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:18,246
Chris, I met an angel.

566
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:20,767
I mean, she's a dancer.

567
00:42:23,812 --> 00:42:27,361
She's so pure and clean.
Not like the rest of these whores.

568
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:29,011
-If I could be with her-
-What?

569
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:30,241
You'd be a good boy?

570
00:42:30,492 --> 00:42:33,484
I'd be perfect. I'd be perfect.
I swear I would!

571
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:35,450
I would stop going to clubs.

572
00:42:35,692 --> 00:42:37,330
I would stop drinking.

573
00:42:37,532 --> 00:42:39,921
I would just lead
a regular life, you know?

574
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:43,721
With my wife and a steady mistress.

575
00:42:44,012 --> 00:42:46,480
And I would have a decent life.

576
00:42:47,012 --> 00:42:49,526
So let's do it!
Where'd you see her?

577
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:56,484
My brain has just turned to shit.

578
00:42:56,732 --> 00:42:59,121
That's why you're in Congress!

579
00:43:03,092 --> 00:43:05,003
You're probably right.

580
00:45:09,132 --> 00:45:09,928
Who is it?

581
00:45:10,132 --> 00:45:12,930
It's Lieutenant Garcia.
Is it a bad time now?

582
00:45:13,132 --> 00:45:15,441
No, just a second.
I was rehearsing.

583
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:22,768
Morning.

584
00:45:23,292 --> 00:45:25,760
I was nearby.
I probably should have call-

585
00:45:26,012 --> 00:45:28,128
No, no, it's fine.
Please come on in.

586
00:45:29,212 --> 00:45:30,531
Thank you.

587
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:34,570
Can I get you some coffee
or English muffin?

588
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:36,564
No, no, thanks.

589
00:45:36,812 --> 00:45:39,326
You know, I was thinking..

590
00:45:39,932 --> 00:45:42,048
..and if I had to guess,
I would say..

591
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:46,205
..that Jerry was probably there
because he was there most nights.

592
00:45:46,612 --> 00:45:48,091
So do you know anything new?

593
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:50,766
Actually, I have some good news..

594
00:45:51,012 --> 00:45:53,321
..and I have some mediocre news.

595
00:45:54,092 --> 00:45:57,084
The good news is Darrell
lost his informant status.

596
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,087
9:00 this morning.

597
00:46:01,412 --> 00:46:03,846
Vice thought his information
was bogus anyway.

598
00:46:04,492 --> 00:46:07,848
This is great! Now in six weeks,
I can go to the judge-

599
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:10,322
That's the mediocre part.

600
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:14,282
Judge Fingerhut had a heart attack
early this morning..

601
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:16,289
..at a porno theater on Ocean.

602
00:46:16,892 --> 00:46:18,883
-Don't tell me that!
-He was DOA..

603
00:46:19,132 --> 00:46:20,929
..at Don Shula Hospital.

604
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:25,528
Anyway, I called around,
and the earliest...

605
00:46:25,772 --> 00:46:28,411
It will be six months
before your appeal's heard.

606
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:29,721
The system is all backed up.

607
00:46:29,972 --> 00:46:33,248
I can't allow her to stay
with him for another six months!

608
00:46:33,492 --> 00:46:36,131
There's nothing you can do
from a legal standpoint.

609
00:46:36,332 --> 00:46:38,129
Absolutely nothing.

610
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,724
I understand.

611
00:46:44,132 --> 00:46:45,565
Is today Friday?

612
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:47,211
Yeah, it's Friday.

613
00:46:47,612 --> 00:46:49,125
I got to run now.

614
00:47:19,492 --> 00:47:21,528
-How are you?
-All right.

615
00:47:35,212 --> 00:47:37,521
You're wonderful, Mr. Dilbeck!

616
00:47:42,732 --> 00:47:45,644
Shalom, darling.
Shalom to you.

617
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:48,924
Manischewitz!

618
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:52,447
Congressman.

619
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:53,448
Alan Mordecai.

620
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:55,762
-Alan, how you been?
-Fine, sir.

621
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:58,964
Congressman, I brought
a little souvenir for you.

622
00:47:59,212 --> 00:48:02,761
Obviously, the ramifications of that,
if it were to become public-

623
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:05,765
-Is this me?
-Yes, I am afraid so.

624
00:48:06,012 --> 00:48:08,765
If this became public,
it would be devastating..

625
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,530
..and I'd like to avoid that.

626
00:48:10,812 --> 00:48:11,608
It's her.

627
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,323
It's my angel.

628
00:48:16,692 --> 00:48:19,525
Heel! Slow down!
Heel, will you?

629
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:55,962
Are you going to your house, Mama?

630
00:48:56,212 --> 00:48:57,850
No, we're going to our house.

631
00:48:59,012 --> 00:49:00,047
For the whole day?

632
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:02,127
Even better.

633
00:49:02,612 --> 00:49:03,408
Really?

634
00:49:04,732 --> 00:49:06,131
Really.

635
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,044
You snatched me, didn't you?

636
00:49:24,572 --> 00:49:25,687
I guess I did.

637
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:27,167
You sure did.

638
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:40,727
Come on, pumpkin.
Zippity-doo-dah.

639
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:53,282
I didn't know she had a child.

640
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:54,971
Of course you-

641
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:57,766
She's divorced, but the husband
has custody. Remember?

642
00:49:58,012 --> 00:50:00,321
She's carrying numerous bags.

643
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:05,925
That doesn't look like just
a visitation, does it, Erb?

644
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:07,167
I will look into it.

645
00:50:07,412 --> 00:50:09,767
Check custody status
of Ms. Erin Grant.

646
00:50:10,012 --> 00:50:12,572
God, give me strength.

647
00:50:13,412 --> 00:50:15,926
What an extraordinary creature.

648
00:50:16,412 --> 00:50:19,927
How perfect in every detail.

649
00:50:20,132 --> 00:50:23,363
Davey, you promised you'd behave
until after the election.

650
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:26,490
You don't understand.
This is love.

651
00:50:26,692 --> 00:50:27,920
Please.

652
00:50:28,812 --> 00:50:30,165
I won't campaign..

653
00:50:30,412 --> 00:50:32,528
..until I can possess..

654
00:50:32,772 --> 00:50:35,240
..her actual velvet self.

655
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:39,162
In the meantime, I want you
to bring me something.

656
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,482
Something of hers.

657
00:50:41,692 --> 00:50:42,966
Something..

658
00:50:43,212 --> 00:50:45,089
..personal to tide me over.

659
00:50:46,332 --> 00:50:47,367
How personal?

660
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,928
Intensely personal.

661
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,166
Am I a good help?

662
00:51:03,412 --> 00:51:07,485
Honey, you are the best
laundry assistant I have ever had.

663
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:14,210
All right, let's hit the road, Jack.

664
00:51:14,452 --> 00:51:15,441
Who's Jack?

665
00:51:16,212 --> 00:51:18,282
It's just an expression.
Come on.

666
00:52:17,812 --> 00:52:19,564
This is some picture.

667
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:22,808
It's fatal.

668
00:52:24,012 --> 00:52:25,684
I don't accede to blackmail.

669
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,530
Willie, I agree with you
in principle..

670
00:52:27,732 --> 00:52:30,405
..but this gets out,
we're in a bigtime shitstorm.

671
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:33,291
Pop, pay the guy off.

672
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,729
You got a cancer,
you talk nice to it?

673
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:40,601
-No. You cut it out.
-Willie.

674
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:43,412
We can't operate like
we're in the funeral business.

675
00:52:43,732 --> 00:52:47,441
I'd rather buy cops than
pay blackmail. Understood?

676
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:51,006
I just think we should
consider other options.

677
00:52:51,532 --> 00:52:52,726
Understood?

678
00:53:08,572 --> 00:53:09,925
What else?

679
00:53:10,212 --> 00:53:11,440
A connected matter.

680
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:14,729
Davey wants this stripper,
and I'd like to use the boat.

681
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:17,532
That way, we can control
the situation.

682
00:53:17,772 --> 00:53:20,650
-She's the girl from the picture?
-That's correct.

683
00:53:20,892 --> 00:53:23,725
-What does she know?
-Well, we got to find out.

684
00:53:23,932 --> 00:53:27,527
The good news is she got custody
illegally, so she's vulnerable.

685
00:53:27,892 --> 00:53:29,928
Vulnerable isn't good enough.

686
00:53:30,172 --> 00:53:32,925
I say let Davey have his fun.
Then lose her.

687
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:36,967
Willie, Willie.

688
00:53:37,212 --> 00:53:40,522
First, let's determine
whether she can hurt us or not.

689
00:53:41,412 --> 00:53:43,050
I am sure she's just
another dumb whore.

690
00:53:43,812 --> 00:53:46,042
For her sake, I hope so.

691
00:53:48,612 --> 00:53:51,843
Phooey! I go back three.

692
00:53:53,932 --> 00:53:57,129
-This is complicated.
-It's easy.

693
00:53:58,932 --> 00:54:00,331
All right, is it your turn?

694
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:03,444
You stay here with us, sweetie.
Mama's orders.

695
00:54:03,692 --> 00:54:05,728
Everybody, listen up.

696
00:54:05,932 --> 00:54:09,004
This is Lorelei!

697
00:54:09,812 --> 00:54:11,928
Formerly of the Flesh Farm.

698
00:54:12,132 --> 00:54:15,920
She and her snake, Monty Python,
have signed an exclusive..

699
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:17,167
..contract with us.

700
00:54:17,412 --> 00:54:18,845
You have got a snake?

701
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,925
-Monty.
-And she starts tomorrow.

702
00:54:22,532 --> 00:54:24,568
So why don't we make
her feel at home..

703
00:54:24,812 --> 00:54:28,043
..and give her a real
Eager Beaver welcome!

704
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:29,601
Welcome, darling.

705
00:54:30,212 --> 00:54:32,168
I am Ariel, Miss Gaza Strip.

706
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:33,725
I am Tiffany Glass.

707
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:37,768
-How big is your snake?
-It's big.

708
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:40,128
So what brings you here?

709
00:54:40,972 --> 00:54:43,167
Just what we needed, another blonde!

710
00:54:43,372 --> 00:54:44,964
What the hell is that?

711
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:47,248
It just came from Ling's.

712
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,926
Monty sleeps with the fishes.

713
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:53,170
Lorelei has no idea, right?

714
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:55,124
No, it just got here.

715
00:54:56,332 --> 00:54:57,731
It's fresh.

716
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:00,130
Go rustle up a new snake.

717
00:55:00,332 --> 00:55:01,208
Where? The A & P?

718
00:55:01,452 --> 00:55:03,443
Who the fuck carries pythons at 10:00?

719
00:55:03,692 --> 00:55:06,843
There's an all-night
snake farm on Route 27.

720
00:55:07,092 --> 00:55:08,764
Ask for Jungle Juan.

721
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:11,081
And get rid of that.

722
00:55:11,372 --> 00:55:13,727
God, I hate this business.

723
00:55:13,932 --> 00:55:15,331
You know why?

724
00:55:15,572 --> 00:55:17,528
It's lost its humanity.

725
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:21,287
-Say hello to one gorgeous creature..
-Bring change.

726
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:24,006
..the unbelievable Erin Grant!

727
00:57:28,092 --> 00:57:30,560
Because he believes in the family..

728
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:33,963
..in the values that made us
a God-fearing people.

729
00:57:34,172 --> 00:57:37,448
Because he's long been
a friend of this organization.

730
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:49,522
Get him out of there.
Preferably with his clothes on.

731
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,451
David-
Oh, my God!

732
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,923
Tell me I am dreaming. Please.

733
00:58:00,212 --> 00:58:04,125
No, no, no!
I cannot believe this!

734
00:58:05,212 --> 00:58:06,008
Davey, no!

735
00:58:06,812 --> 00:58:08,040
Is this lint fresh?

736
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:09,281
Hot out of the Maytag.

737
00:58:12,212 --> 00:58:14,521
You just can't imagine!

738
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:18,402
This is the very essence
of that glorious creature.

739
00:58:18,652 --> 00:58:22,281
I got to say, even for you,
Davey, this is off the charts!

740
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:23,801
Why are you shiny?

741
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:26,402
It's Vaseline.

742
00:58:28,292 --> 00:58:30,567
It's Vas--
Great. It's Vaseline.

743
00:58:30,812 --> 00:58:33,326
You have never covered yourself
with Vaseline?

744
00:58:33,692 --> 00:58:35,284
Not unless I have third degree burns.

745
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:40,209
You don't know what you're missing.
I have got it all over.

746
00:58:40,572 --> 00:58:44,929
It's down in my boots. I can feel
it squishing in between my toes.

747
00:58:45,132 --> 00:58:46,281
All right, okay.

748
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:49,604
The Young Christians
are waiting so...

749
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:53,128
-When will I see her?
-It's in the works.

750
00:58:53,412 --> 00:58:55,004
-When?
-It's in the works!

751
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,929
Clean yourself up!

752
00:58:58,532 --> 00:59:02,571
I did not go into politics to pimp
for a twisted old fuck like you!

753
00:59:02,812 --> 00:59:04,530
I have had it, Davey.

754
00:59:06,412 --> 00:59:07,731
I quit.

755
00:59:09,492 --> 00:59:12,131
You are such a child.

756
00:59:16,572 --> 00:59:19,962
Onward, Christian soldiers

757
00:59:20,212 --> 00:59:24,171
Marching as to war

758
00:59:24,412 --> 00:59:28,291
With the cross of Jesus

759
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:32,002
Going on before

760
00:59:32,212 --> 00:59:35,841
Christ, the royal Master

761
00:59:36,092 --> 00:59:39,721
Leads against the foe

762
00:59:39,972 --> 00:59:43,123
Forward into battle

763
00:59:43,332 --> 00:59:47,007
See His banners go

764
00:59:55,572 --> 00:59:58,040
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

765
01:00:00,612 --> 01:00:02,523
You are too kind.

766
01:00:06,372 --> 01:00:11,162
What a privilege for me to be here
for you good people tonight..

767
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:13,926
..and to talk about an issue
that is so critical..

768
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:17,801
..to this campaign and
to all of the American people.

769
01:00:18,332 --> 01:00:20,527
I am talking about the issue..

770
01:00:20,732 --> 01:00:23,166
..of family values.

771
01:00:40,412 --> 01:00:42,528
Where's Monty?
He isn't here yet.

772
01:00:42,732 --> 01:00:45,121
He's on his way.
Relax.

773
01:00:47,012 --> 01:00:48,730
Do me a favor and watch Angela?

774
01:00:48,972 --> 01:00:51,361
I am going to get my car,
it's pouring out.

775
01:00:51,612 --> 01:00:53,728
-Yeah, sure, gorgeous.
-Thanks.

776
01:00:56,732 --> 01:00:58,484
Where have you been all night?

777
01:00:58,692 --> 01:01:02,731
Doing my Christmas shopping early.
Martha Stewart recommends it.

778
01:01:05,012 --> 01:01:08,163
If that's not a snake,
then it's an amazing belt.

779
01:01:08,812 --> 01:01:12,521
I got to find a new line of work.
This shit is getting out of hand.

780
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:15,127
Let me put this down
and walk you to your car.

781
01:01:15,332 --> 01:01:17,323
I am fine.
I will see you tomorrow.

782
01:01:33,332 --> 01:01:36,130
-Evening, everybody.
-Shit!

783
01:01:36,372 --> 01:01:39,523
-Where's my little 'un?
-Where you can't get her.

784
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:43,530
Is that ever the wrong answer.
Bring her to me now!

785
01:01:43,772 --> 01:01:46,525
I am not bringing her to you
in this lifetime.

786
01:01:46,732 --> 01:01:50,361
I will go to that judge and tell him
my whore of a wife abducted-

787
01:01:50,572 --> 01:01:52,927
Guess what, Darrell?
The judge is dead.

788
01:01:53,132 --> 01:01:55,009
So you will just have to kill me.

789
01:01:55,252 --> 01:01:57,925
-Go on!
-Think I am afraid to?

790
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,566
Think I don't have the manliness
to take your life?

791
01:02:00,772 --> 01:02:02,763
I think you are all man.

792
01:02:03,012 --> 01:02:07,528
That death row-lethal injection thing?
That's not going to scare you.

793
01:02:08,932 --> 01:02:10,843
They'd never execute a daddy.

794
01:02:11,332 --> 01:02:12,481
Drop the knife.

795
01:02:12,692 --> 01:02:13,966
You got till three. One.

796
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:16,051
Suck my dick.

797
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,243
Whip the little fella out. Two.

798
01:02:18,492 --> 01:02:20,847
This here is a domestic squabble.

799
01:02:24,812 --> 01:02:26,040
Three.

800
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,601
You broke my arm!

801
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:30,245
You sure?

802
01:02:37,332 --> 01:02:39,448
-Bitch!
-Bully!

803
01:02:45,412 --> 01:02:47,448
I am going to get you!

804
01:02:50,732 --> 01:02:53,485
-Are you okay?
-Just had a tiff with my ex.

805
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:57,691
I know what that's like.
Did you see? Monty finally got here.

806
01:02:57,932 --> 01:02:59,285
That's great, Lorelei.

807
01:02:59,532 --> 01:03:02,524
Hey, baby. Say hi to Erin.

808
01:03:03,052 --> 01:03:04,246
-Cute.
-Homicide.

809
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:05,641
Lieutenant Garcia.

810
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:09,689
She's a kidnapper!

811
01:03:09,932 --> 01:03:11,445
Watch your head there.

812
01:03:12,732 --> 01:03:15,610
The fact is he threatened,
and he did not attempt.

813
01:03:16,212 --> 01:03:18,931
What if he kills me?
Can I press charges then?

814
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:21,487
The law is the law.
I will screw around here.

815
01:03:21,732 --> 01:03:25,850
If you like, I will lose your paperwork.
He makes bail, she's his.

816
01:03:28,692 --> 01:03:31,252
I should split and
take her to New England.

817
01:03:32,172 --> 01:03:33,446
Understand this.

818
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:37,082
If you split without formal custody,
you will lose her forever.

819
01:03:37,332 --> 01:03:40,324
I have dealt with Family Services.
They are pencil pushers.

820
01:03:40,532 --> 01:03:43,205
-This is by the book.
-I am dealing with a maniac.

821
01:03:43,412 --> 01:03:45,880
I understand.
I repeat, you can't take off.

822
01:03:46,732 --> 01:03:48,290
You cannot.

823
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:52,043
You might have a bigger problem.

824
01:03:53,012 --> 01:03:55,367
-I can't have a bigger problem!
-Look at this.

825
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:59,242
Any of these clowns the one
who might have assaulted Mr. Guber?

826
01:04:09,452 --> 01:04:10,248
This clown.

827
01:04:11,612 --> 01:04:12,681
You're positive?

828
01:04:13,532 --> 01:04:14,408
Absolutely.

829
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:18,644
Who is he? He looks
like that guy on F Troop.

830
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:21,529
That's Congressman Dilbeck.

831
01:04:22,212 --> 01:04:23,770
This nut is a congressman?

832
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:26,930
You haven't heard from him?
From any of his staff?

833
01:04:29,892 --> 01:04:30,847
Wait.

834
01:04:32,052 --> 01:04:34,247
This is who
Jerry was talking about.

835
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:37,371
Are you saying I am in danger
from a congressman?

836
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:38,488
No.

837
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,447
Let me know if you hear
from him though.

838
01:04:44,332 --> 01:04:46,129
I think that's in both our interests.

839
01:04:47,132 --> 01:04:49,043
How did I get so popular?

840
01:04:51,332 --> 01:04:55,086
Hush, little baby
Don't you cry

841
01:04:55,332 --> 01:05:00,247
Mama's going to buy you a something

842
01:05:00,892 --> 01:05:02,769
Pumpkin pie.

843
01:05:03,412 --> 01:05:05,164
Oh, you're awake.

844
01:05:05,412 --> 01:05:07,880
-Can Mommy put you down?
-No.

845
01:05:08,132 --> 01:05:09,645
Fair enough.

846
01:05:30,932 --> 01:05:33,082
-Brush your teeth.
-I am too tired.

847
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:36,051
Okay, don't brush your teeth.
Go on to bed.

848
01:05:40,532 --> 01:05:43,842
"Mr. Dilbeck requests your company
for a private dance.

849
01:05:44,052 --> 01:05:47,727
You will receive $2,000 cash
for a one-hour set.

850
01:05:47,932 --> 01:05:52,642
Discretion and confidentiality
are of the utmost importance."

851
01:06:02,932 --> 01:06:05,446
Mommy, do you like dancing?

852
01:06:06,132 --> 01:06:07,485
Why are you still awake?

853
01:06:07,732 --> 01:06:10,849
I was just thinking.
Do you like dancing?

854
01:06:11,132 --> 01:06:12,247
Not really.

855
01:06:12,452 --> 01:06:14,761
-It's not fun?
-No.

856
01:06:15,492 --> 01:06:17,210
You're just dancing.

857
01:06:18,252 --> 01:06:21,369
Just dancing's fun, honey.
Sure, that part of the job.

858
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:24,009
What's not fun?
The customers?

859
01:06:24,212 --> 01:06:27,204
Urbana said some of them
are mean and stupid.

860
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:32,887
Pumpkin, have you ever seen me dance?

861
01:06:36,132 --> 01:06:36,962
Have you?

862
01:06:38,052 --> 01:06:40,850
-I told the girls that-
-I came out tonight.

863
01:06:45,532 --> 01:06:46,647
While I was dancing?

864
01:06:52,332 --> 01:06:54,084
You looked really pretty.

865
01:06:54,732 --> 01:06:55,926
No, I didn't.

866
01:06:56,332 --> 01:06:58,846
Yeah, you did.
You looked great.

867
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:06,244
Thank you, baby.

868
01:07:10,252 --> 01:07:12,243
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

869
01:07:12,452 --> 01:07:15,205
Welcome to the
Miami Seaquarium's Top Deck.

870
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:21,401
We are going to celebrate the oceans
and all the living things in them...

871
01:07:21,652 --> 01:07:25,725
...as we proudly present to you
a splash of the islands.

872
01:07:28,972 --> 01:07:32,044
Okay, now, I need all
the camp kids to come with me.

873
01:07:33,012 --> 01:07:34,331
Come on. You too.

874
01:07:35,732 --> 01:07:38,849
It's okay. You can go.
Go on. It's all right.

875
01:07:41,332 --> 01:07:42,447
I will be right here.

876
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:46,645
Don't worry.

877
01:07:47,532 --> 01:07:49,841
She's spent so little time with kids...

878
01:07:50,052 --> 01:07:52,646
It will change.
Once she's with you full-time.

879
01:07:52,892 --> 01:07:53,688
I hope so.

880
01:07:55,092 --> 01:07:58,050
Let me get this straight.
He offered you two grand?

881
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,250
To dance for one hour?

882
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:03,288
I don't know.

883
01:08:03,932 --> 01:08:05,968
I can't turn it down, Al.

884
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:10,364
Now that I have Angie with me,
I have got to find another job immediately.

885
01:08:10,612 --> 01:08:13,843
Which will pay me nothing
compared to what I am making now.

886
01:08:14,652 --> 01:08:16,051
But, you know..

887
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:19,404
..she saw me last night.
Can you imagine?

888
01:08:21,892 --> 01:08:23,211
Was she upset?

889
01:08:23,412 --> 01:08:26,643
She said no, but come on.
One day she's going to realize..

890
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,570
..and say, "That was my mother."

891
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:36,044
How about you? You ready
to feed Flipper? Step here.

892
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:37,767
Oh, my God.

893
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:43,046
-It's safe, though, right?
-What?

894
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:44,162
With Dilbeck.

895
01:08:44,652 --> 01:08:46,131
I am bringing Shad.

896
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:50,371
I think as long as they think you
don't know anything, you will be fine.

897
01:08:50,612 --> 01:08:51,681
Keep your ears open.

898
01:08:52,692 --> 01:08:54,205
What will you do with her tonight?

899
01:08:54,412 --> 01:08:55,481
Urbana said that she'd-

900
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:58,451
Why don't you drop her
off at our house?

901
01:08:59,332 --> 01:09:00,765
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

902
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:03,810
I told Donna everything.
Your whole situation.

903
01:09:04,012 --> 01:09:06,810
She said if you needed a hand
she'd love to help.

904
01:09:07,012 --> 01:09:09,890
She doesn't think I am something
out of A Current Affair ?

905
01:09:10,252 --> 01:09:13,847
Come on, you're a terrific girl.
You know that.

906
01:09:14,092 --> 01:09:17,721
So you made a mistake. You married
a bum. What are you going to do?

907
01:09:17,932 --> 01:09:20,446
You going to beat yourself up
for the rest of your life?

908
01:09:21,412 --> 01:09:24,051
Well, I usually don't,
but it's...

909
01:09:25,492 --> 01:09:27,050
I mean, it's just that..

910
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:29,567
..you know, she saw me dancing.

911
01:09:33,412 --> 01:09:34,527
It will all work out.

912
01:09:35,092 --> 01:09:37,652
I want her free and clear,
whatever it takes.

913
01:09:43,692 --> 01:09:45,444
Good job, baby!

914
01:10:11,892 --> 01:10:14,850
-You're Mrs. Grant?
-No, I am Barbara Bush.

915
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:17,362
-Who is he?
-George Bush.

916
01:10:17,812 --> 01:10:19,291
George Bush is not invited.

917
01:10:20,532 --> 01:10:21,362
Take a hike.

918
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,051
Oh, no, no.

919
01:10:24,452 --> 01:10:26,363
See, if he goes, I go.

920
01:10:29,332 --> 01:10:31,448
Raise your hands.
I got to pat you down.

921
01:10:32,692 --> 01:10:33,920
Stop.

922
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:37,245
Right this way.

923
01:11:15,612 --> 01:11:20,083
Hello, Erin.
My name is Congressman Dilbeck.

924
01:11:21,132 --> 01:11:23,885
You are-
You're a beauty.

925
01:11:29,612 --> 01:11:30,408
Good evening.

926
01:11:32,732 --> 01:11:34,006
I am Erin Grant.

927
01:11:37,532 --> 01:11:39,329
And you must be...

928
01:11:40,852 --> 01:11:42,649
Convak Dilvak.

929
01:11:43,812 --> 01:11:45,723
Congressman Dildo.

930
01:11:48,132 --> 01:11:50,043
I am Congressman David Dilbeck.

931
01:11:51,132 --> 01:11:53,362
And welcome, welcome.

932
01:11:57,692 --> 01:11:59,523
You are truly, truly welcome.

933
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:00,687
Thank you.

934
01:12:01,412 --> 01:12:03,482
Have we ever met before?

935
01:12:06,092 --> 01:12:08,242
But actually, I have seen..

936
01:12:08,852 --> 01:12:12,128
..many, many beautiful
photographs of you.

937
01:12:14,492 --> 01:12:16,960
Well, I am honored.
And a congressman.

938
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:21,245
Very successful congressman
you must be.

939
01:12:21,892 --> 01:12:23,007
This is not my boat.

940
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:27,249
It belongs to a very
close friend of mine.

941
01:12:27,892 --> 01:12:30,452
Do you like Dino?

942
01:12:33,532 --> 01:12:37,889
Dean's great, yeah.
But you know, I have brought my own.

943
01:12:38,132 --> 01:12:41,249
Do you care for The Artist
Formerly Known as Prince?

944
01:12:44,612 --> 01:12:46,125
I care for you.

945
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:52,641
So, George, you get to watch
any of the auditions?

946
01:12:53,012 --> 01:12:55,446
Watch, my ass.
I do the hiring.

947
01:12:56,052 --> 01:12:57,167
I have seen every girl in Florida.

948
01:12:57,652 --> 01:13:00,371
What are the criteria?
Monster jugs?

949
01:13:00,732 --> 01:13:03,041
Firmness is crucial.

950
01:13:03,252 --> 01:13:06,050
I got to hold them for a while.
Shake them.

951
01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:08,167
You shake their tits?

952
01:13:08,652 --> 01:13:13,089
It ain't no picnic, man.
Got tendinitis in my right wrist.

953
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:15,642
On a rainy day, it's agony.

954
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,691
You audition anybody famous?

955
01:13:19,932 --> 01:13:21,809
You know, before they were famous.

956
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:25,645
Sure did.

957
01:13:26,092 --> 01:13:27,605
Meryl Streep.

958
01:13:28,812 --> 01:13:30,803
Come on!
Meryl Streep stripped?

959
01:13:32,052 --> 01:13:33,849
One of the best.

960
01:13:34,092 --> 01:13:36,447
Chesty La France.

961
01:13:37,732 --> 01:13:39,324
That was Meryl.

962
01:13:41,252 --> 01:13:43,243
Chesty La France. I heard of her.

963
01:14:05,052 --> 01:14:07,008
I give you anything you want.

964
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:09,044
A diamond ring.

965
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:10,442
A Lexus.

966
01:14:10,932 --> 01:14:13,002
I will get you a condo on the beach.

967
01:14:13,252 --> 01:14:14,526
Just be my girlfriend.

968
01:14:15,052 --> 01:14:17,361
-Can't do that.
-Why not?

969
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:21,041
I love you.

970
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:24,244
You don't know what
I have done for you recently.

971
01:14:24,532 --> 01:14:26,841
Really? And what was that?

972
01:14:27,852 --> 01:14:30,525
I talked to Judge Fingerhut
about your daughter.

973
01:14:31,412 --> 01:14:32,640
You did?

974
01:14:33,532 --> 01:14:35,841
And how did you know about my case?

975
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:38,081
Little birdie told me.

976
01:14:38,532 --> 01:14:41,842
It must have been a little old
birdie who knew me very well.

977
01:14:42,492 --> 01:14:43,527
"Who" is not important.

978
01:14:44,132 --> 01:14:45,645
Come on now.

979
01:14:46,692 --> 01:14:48,762
Not just a little hint.

980
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,961
I can't do that.

981
01:14:54,972 --> 01:14:56,849
But I know the new judge.

982
01:14:57,692 --> 01:15:01,401
He's a very good friend of mine.
The Honorable Jack Goldberg.

983
01:15:03,092 --> 01:15:04,650
He will be more amenable.

984
01:15:06,812 --> 01:15:10,725
Darling, if you just come
into Davey's life..

985
01:15:11,092 --> 01:15:13,048
..good things will happen.

986
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:15,328
You don't know how much
I worship you.

987
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:18,045
How much?

988
01:15:18,492 --> 01:15:22,610
I sent my aide, Erb,
over to your laundromat.

989
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:26,088
He brought back some of your lint.

990
01:15:26,932 --> 01:15:27,921
My lint?

991
01:15:28,652 --> 01:15:29,687
Fresh..

992
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,089
..hot lint.

993
01:15:34,332 --> 01:15:38,962
And what did you do
with that fresh, hot lint?

994
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:42,488
I am afraid I made love to it.

995
01:15:48,132 --> 01:15:51,442
Close your eyes.
I have got a little surprise for you.

996
01:15:51,692 --> 01:15:53,410
Keep them closed.

997
01:15:53,612 --> 01:15:55,648
No peeking.

998
01:15:57,972 --> 01:16:01,851
Don't invade my private life again
or I will kill you. You understand?

999
01:16:02,052 --> 01:16:03,849
Show's over, big boy.

1000
01:16:09,292 --> 01:16:11,647
You will come back tomorrow?
Same time?

1001
01:16:11,852 --> 01:16:13,171
I don't think so.

1002
01:16:13,412 --> 01:16:15,642
I will give you $5,000.

1003
01:16:15,852 --> 01:16:19,162
Five thousand dollars for no sex?
You love me that much.

1004
01:16:19,852 --> 01:16:23,925
Just the touch of your hand
sets my pecker on fire.

1005
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:26,642
Maybe you should see a doctor.

1006
01:16:26,852 --> 01:16:27,967
Same time tomorrow?

1007
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:31,407
If I come, can we talk more
about my case?

1008
01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:34,530
We can talk about anything.
As long as you're naked.

1009
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:37,411
We will see.

1010
01:16:45,132 --> 01:16:46,645
Good evening.

1011
01:16:48,452 --> 01:16:51,250
You don't know me.
I am Malcolm Moldovsky.

1012
01:16:51,492 --> 01:16:53,084
Dilbeck's right hand.

1013
01:16:54,212 --> 01:16:55,691
You must be a very busy man.

1014
01:16:57,812 --> 01:16:59,040
Touche.

1015
01:17:00,012 --> 01:17:01,889
I wish to give you some advice..

1016
01:17:02,132 --> 01:17:04,646
..about your adorable
little daughter, Angela.

1017
01:17:04,932 --> 01:17:08,527
-What about her?
-Your custody of her is illegal.

1018
01:17:09,532 --> 01:17:12,251
That's just temporary
until the appeal gets heard-

1019
01:17:12,452 --> 01:17:15,046
Please, please, Miss Grant.

1020
01:17:15,252 --> 01:17:17,447
Really, it's of no concern to us.

1021
01:17:18,052 --> 01:17:21,442
As long as you refuse to cooperate
with certain individuals..

1022
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:24,843
..who seek to harm
and slur Congressman Dilbeck..

1023
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:28,451
..for their own selfish
political gain.

1024
01:17:34,892 --> 01:17:37,929
I don't know what you're
talking about. Excuse me.

1025
01:17:39,092 --> 01:17:40,445
Perhaps you don't.

1026
01:17:40,972 --> 01:17:44,442
But what a pity if Angela were
to be placed in a state home.

1027
01:17:44,692 --> 01:17:46,045
Pretty grim, most of them.

1028
01:17:46,812 --> 01:17:49,849
A lot of strange people working there.

1029
01:17:50,092 --> 01:17:54,722
I'd recommend that you cooperate
with us for the child's sake.

1030
01:17:55,412 --> 01:17:59,246
Which means you talk
to no one about tonight..

1031
01:18:00,732 --> 01:18:02,245
..or any night.

1032
01:18:04,092 --> 01:18:05,002
Understood?

1033
01:18:06,612 --> 01:18:07,408
Of course.

1034
01:18:09,812 --> 01:18:10,881
Good.

1035
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:12,850
Now if you will excuse me..

1036
01:18:13,052 --> 01:18:15,850
..I'd better toss the congressman
into a cold shower.

1037
01:18:19,012 --> 01:18:22,084
By the way, I can see why
he's so taken by your charms.

1038
01:18:24,052 --> 01:18:25,041
Good night.

1039
01:18:27,252 --> 01:18:28,890
Watch your step on the gangplank.

1040
01:18:36,932 --> 01:18:39,048
She ain't dumb enough.

1041
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:46,321
-Try anything?
-No.

1042
01:18:47,012 --> 01:18:48,650
He ask you back?

1043
01:18:50,132 --> 01:18:51,247
No.

1044
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:54,441
Aren't we Miss Talkative tonight?

1045
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:56,526
I am a little tired.

1046
01:19:00,412 --> 01:19:02,846
What's the matter, baby?
Come on.

1047
01:19:06,812 --> 01:19:08,245
Monty.

1048
01:19:16,132 --> 01:19:18,168
This reptile's a freaking lemon.

1049
01:19:18,372 --> 01:19:19,885
Who are you?

1050
01:19:20,372 --> 01:19:21,282
Help!

1051
01:19:25,932 --> 01:19:27,490
-So how did it go?
-Fine.

1052
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:30,645
-No problems?
-No, none.

1053
01:19:32,092 --> 01:19:32,888
But no information.

1054
01:19:35,932 --> 01:19:37,001
Zero.

1055
01:19:37,212 --> 01:19:39,885
Look, I got to run, you know.
Angela's wiped.

1056
01:19:40,132 --> 01:19:42,202
I will see you later, okay?

1057
01:19:48,572 --> 01:19:49,891
Come on, come on.

1058
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:56,008
Do something!

1059
01:19:56,212 --> 01:19:59,443
I am doing something.
I am protecting you.

1060
01:19:59,932 --> 01:20:01,524
-Stand back.
-Oh, my God!

1061
01:20:03,852 --> 01:20:05,729
That's not Monty!

1062
01:20:06,812 --> 01:20:08,962
You're fine, hon. You will be fine.

1063
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:13,044
It doesn't look bad.

1064
01:20:14,772 --> 01:20:16,251
What happened here?

1065
01:20:17,532 --> 01:20:19,443
We got a problem with a dead snake.

1066
01:20:19,932 --> 01:20:21,445
Gee, that's funny.

1067
01:20:22,612 --> 01:20:23,488
So do I.

1068
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:29,251
Here comes that brilliant and charming
attorney of yours, Mr. Mordecai.

1069
01:20:31,212 --> 01:20:35,649
Found him 400 yards offshore.
Now show him the rest of his kisser.

1070
01:20:37,932 --> 01:20:41,242
Crabs find lawyers
a particular delicacy.

1071
01:20:41,892 --> 01:20:42,961
Looks like lasagna.

1072
01:20:44,092 --> 01:20:44,922
Cover that shit up.

1073
01:20:45,692 --> 01:20:49,241
You want to tell me why your name
was on his calendar for tomorrow?

1074
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,448
I was involved in litigation
with a yogurt company.

1075
01:20:55,332 --> 01:20:58,051
From my limited experience,
this isn't something..

1076
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:00,852
..a yogurt company
would ordinarily do.

1077
01:21:01,212 --> 01:21:04,090
He represented the kid
who got mauled at your club.

1078
01:21:04,332 --> 01:21:07,244
Now that I find fascinating, Shad.

1079
01:21:07,652 --> 01:21:09,244
He had a picture.

1080
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,129
Man, I am going to lose it.

1081
01:21:12,332 --> 01:21:14,448
No, no. A picture of what?

1082
01:21:15,852 --> 01:21:16,887
A legislator?

1083
01:21:17,412 --> 01:21:19,687
Yeah, beating a kid's ass.

1084
01:21:19,892 --> 01:21:22,804
-Where's the original?
-I got no idea.

1085
01:21:25,012 --> 01:21:26,445
Here, freshen up.

1086
01:21:29,012 --> 01:21:30,240
All right, thanks.

1087
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:33,125
-Can I interest you in dessert?
-Just the check.

1088
01:21:33,332 --> 01:21:34,242
Good night.

1089
01:21:36,452 --> 01:21:39,091
-Dilbeck didn't invite her back?
-She said no.

1090
01:21:39,332 --> 01:21:43,644
That's good. I don't think she should
go there again, even with you.

1091
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:46,682
She seemed all edgy tonight.

1092
01:21:46,892 --> 01:21:49,850
Man, she got her moods.
Could be that time of month.

1093
01:21:50,052 --> 01:21:53,647
So you're like the gynecologist-bouncer,
bouncer-gynecologist.

1094
01:21:54,532 --> 01:21:57,285
-I just watch out for the girl.
-So do I.

1095
01:21:57,492 --> 01:22:00,450
That's a grand total
of two people in Florida.

1096
01:22:00,652 --> 01:22:04,486
The higher-ups in my department
aren't pushing this investigation.

1097
01:22:04,692 --> 01:22:06,967
-Because of this congressman?
-Bingo.

1098
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,244
We got two homicides here,
and nobody gives a shit.

1099
01:22:10,532 --> 01:22:12,648
And I am worried about that girl.

1100
01:22:13,932 --> 01:22:15,763
She's out there all by herself.

1101
01:22:48,332 --> 01:22:50,050
Where's the sheriff?

1102
01:23:03,892 --> 01:23:05,644
Hello, city desk?

1103
01:23:17,412 --> 01:23:19,642
It is an unusual time
for a news conference..

1104
01:23:19,892 --> 01:23:22,281
..but the congressman feels
it will dramatize his message.

1105
01:23:22,532 --> 01:23:23,851
We will send a camera crew.

1106
01:23:24,052 --> 01:23:26,725
-Confirm?
-There won't be any need to confirm.

1107
01:23:26,932 --> 01:23:28,684
-Got everything.
-Thank you.

1108
01:23:28,892 --> 01:23:31,281
Good morning, pumpkin.
How'd you sleep?

1109
01:23:31,532 --> 01:23:33,090
Good. How about you?

1110
01:23:33,332 --> 01:23:35,482
Well, I just-
I slept great, honey.

1111
01:23:42,692 --> 01:23:43,522
Want some cereal?

1112
01:23:43,932 --> 01:23:45,650
Not right now.

1113
01:23:49,012 --> 01:23:50,843
-Good morning.
-Hello, CNN?

1114
01:23:51,052 --> 01:23:52,644
-May I help you?
-News desk.

1115
01:23:52,852 --> 01:23:54,251
One second, please.

1116
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:55,681
This is Jennifer..

1117
01:23:55,932 --> 01:23:58,685
..and I am calling from
Congressman Dilbeck's office.

1118
01:23:58,892 --> 01:24:01,406
Malcolm Moldovsky asked me to call..

1119
01:24:01,612 --> 01:24:04,046
..about the news conference
at the refinery.

1120
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,088
Quit moving!

1121
01:24:18,012 --> 01:24:19,570
Whose Mercedes is that?

1122
01:24:19,812 --> 01:24:23,043
-Some orthodontist from Tampa.
-God, what would Mom say?

1123
01:24:23,252 --> 01:24:25,447
She'd say, "Nice fucking car."

1124
01:24:25,932 --> 01:24:28,048
You got a mouth like a sewer!

1125
01:24:29,332 --> 01:24:30,970
I need some morphine.

1126
01:24:31,212 --> 01:24:32,850
I don't got none for humans.

1127
01:24:33,092 --> 01:24:34,161
What do you mean?

1128
01:24:34,412 --> 01:24:36,880
All's I got is some
from when Lupa had her cubs.

1129
01:24:37,132 --> 01:24:39,327
-Wolf morphine?
-I don't know. I think so.

1130
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:42,524
So give me. I am dying.
Busted arm, two nights in jail.

1131
01:24:48,252 --> 01:24:49,287
How'd you break it?

1132
01:24:49,732 --> 01:24:53,042
Playing polo with Donald Trump, okay?

1133
01:24:55,092 --> 01:24:57,999
It says here you take two
every four hours with a bowl of milk.

1134
01:24:59,532 --> 01:25:01,250
Sounds good to me.

1135
01:25:01,452 --> 01:25:03,249
I said two!

1136
01:25:04,212 --> 01:25:06,043
Goddamn it!

1137
01:25:18,692 --> 01:25:22,002
Throw down a spade or seven
unless you have an eight.

1138
01:25:22,212 --> 01:25:23,645
Then you can change suits.

1139
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:28,040
So that's why
they call it Crazy Eights.

1140
01:25:28,652 --> 01:25:30,085
When are you coming back?

1141
01:25:30,332 --> 01:25:32,641
By two. But I hope
you will be asleep.

1142
01:25:32,932 --> 01:25:35,526
We will take care of her.
Don't worry.

1143
01:25:37,412 --> 01:25:38,367
You're going out?

1144
01:25:38,612 --> 01:25:40,887
I will be back by two.
I will dance the late shift.

1145
01:25:41,132 --> 01:25:43,646
-Can you tell me where you-?
-No, I can't.

1146
01:25:47,052 --> 01:25:49,441
-You be good, pumpkin.
-I will.

1147
01:25:50,452 --> 01:25:51,805
She will be fine.

1148
01:25:52,252 --> 01:25:53,970
Don't worry.

1149
01:25:54,212 --> 01:25:55,167
See you, baby.

1150
01:25:57,532 --> 01:25:59,250
You're going to the boat?

1151
01:26:02,252 --> 01:26:03,207
Not without me.

1152
01:26:05,212 --> 01:26:06,008
I will be late.

1153
01:26:07,212 --> 01:26:08,122
Listen up.

1154
01:26:08,332 --> 01:26:10,641
-You said you weren't going.
-I didn't want anybody to know.

1155
01:26:10,852 --> 01:26:11,967
-Like who?
-Garcia.

1156
01:26:12,212 --> 01:26:14,646
Then just say, "Don't tell Garcia."
What's up?

1157
01:26:14,852 --> 01:26:17,764
They will put Angela in a foster home
if I don't keep my mouth shut.

1158
01:26:18,012 --> 01:26:21,641
-Says who?
-Dilbeck's guy, that creep Moldovsky.

1159
01:26:21,852 --> 01:26:26,050
Promise me you will stay with her
every second. I need to know that.

1160
01:26:26,332 --> 01:26:28,050
I can't let you go there alone.

1161
01:26:28,252 --> 01:26:31,961
They're going to pay me $5,000.
I need the money.

1162
01:26:32,332 --> 01:26:35,449
I need to get out of here and
live a normal, fully-dressed life..

1163
01:26:35,692 --> 01:26:38,001
..with shopping lists
and school buses.

1164
01:26:38,332 --> 01:26:40,607
If they wanted to kill me,
they would have.

1165
01:26:40,932 --> 01:26:42,285
Let me get this straight.

1166
01:26:42,492 --> 01:26:45,564
So you going to go there, dance
and come back here.

1167
01:26:46,132 --> 01:26:47,042
Correct.

1168
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:49,327
Something's up.

1169
01:26:49,612 --> 01:26:51,568
I have got it under control.

1170
01:26:51,852 --> 01:26:54,446
Promise me you will stay
with Angela every second.

1171
01:26:58,212 --> 01:26:59,645
I will see you later.

1172
01:27:09,772 --> 01:27:11,251
Bonsoir.

1173
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:05,408
Sorry.

1174
01:28:08,732 --> 01:28:10,245
You speak English?

1175
01:28:11,612 --> 01:28:13,045
Sometime.

1176
01:28:13,932 --> 01:28:16,685
What do you think
about the people you work for?

1177
01:28:18,012 --> 01:28:19,286
They're filth.

1178
01:28:19,492 --> 01:28:21,642
Exploiters of the poor.

1179
01:28:23,092 --> 01:28:26,050
I think you and I are going to
get along just fine.

1180
01:28:28,492 --> 01:28:32,371
For $5,000, I expect to get laid.
It's only human.

1181
01:28:32,612 --> 01:28:34,091
Listen to me.

1182
01:28:34,332 --> 01:28:36,846
That beautiful lady
doesn't understand.

1183
01:28:37,132 --> 01:28:41,648
She doesn't understand what it's like
to make love to a congressman.

1184
01:28:41,852 --> 01:28:43,444
The ecstasy, the wonderful-

1185
01:28:43,692 --> 01:28:46,650
Listen to me, you sick fuck!

1186
01:28:46,932 --> 01:28:49,241
She's been meeting with a cop.

1187
01:28:49,572 --> 01:28:51,244
Maybe he's from the titty squad.

1188
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:53,050
He's homicide.

1189
01:28:53,332 --> 01:28:55,846
She used to work
at the FBl as a secretary.

1190
01:28:56,092 --> 01:28:59,641
This bitch is poison.
She's out to slaughter us.

1191
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:02,043
Make a fool of me.

1192
01:29:03,332 --> 01:29:07,007
Screw yourself bowlegged,
Davey of the Navy.

1193
01:29:08,132 --> 01:29:10,646
Then let us handle it.
I will be on the top deck.

1194
01:29:17,212 --> 01:29:19,248
I thought she cared for me.

1195
01:29:31,172 --> 01:29:31,968
We're heavy.

1196
01:29:34,132 --> 01:29:34,928
Copy.

1197
01:29:35,972 --> 01:29:37,007
No cheating.

1198
01:29:37,212 --> 01:29:39,043
-One, two, three...
-Doesn't look good.

1199
01:29:41,092 --> 01:29:42,844
Can't get a break.

1200
01:29:43,932 --> 01:29:46,969
Shad's a loser.
Shad's a loser.

1201
01:29:49,572 --> 01:29:51,244
All right, Miss Angela.

1202
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:52,641
Six!

1203
01:29:52,852 --> 01:29:54,843
She always gets six.

1204
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:53,647
Down, Bowser. Be patient.

1205
01:30:53,892 --> 01:30:55,086
Don't tease me!

1206
01:30:55,772 --> 01:30:58,889
I am not teasing.
You just sit back..

1207
01:30:59,132 --> 01:31:01,123
..relax, have yourself
another drink.

1208
01:31:01,612 --> 01:31:04,809
Because tonight is the night.

1209
01:31:08,012 --> 01:31:09,365
It sure is.

1210
01:31:22,132 --> 01:31:22,928
Who are you?

1211
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:25,327
I want my daughter.

1212
01:31:26,172 --> 01:31:29,289
What? Chico!
How'd you get onboard?

1213
01:31:29,732 --> 01:31:31,848
My little 'un. I want her.

1214
01:31:32,972 --> 01:31:36,760
Your "little 'un,"
whoever she is, is not here.

1215
01:31:38,972 --> 01:31:39,768
Chico!

1216
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:46,165
What's this?

1217
01:31:46,772 --> 01:31:47,727
Damn!

1218
01:31:48,812 --> 01:31:49,608
Look...

1219
01:31:57,012 --> 01:32:00,322
Well, there's a sight
to raise the dead.

1220
01:32:01,812 --> 01:32:03,928
Who's that old freak?

1221
01:32:05,612 --> 01:32:07,523
Hold on a second.

1222
01:32:07,892 --> 01:32:09,610
I know who that is.

1223
01:32:09,852 --> 01:32:12,002
Is that the-?

1224
01:32:12,972 --> 01:32:15,805
Is that that guy
from Price is Right ?

1225
01:32:18,972 --> 01:32:20,849
Oh, damn!

1226
01:32:23,212 --> 01:32:24,964
You got my daughter..

1227
01:32:25,212 --> 01:32:27,487
..and now you try
and kill me with a axe!

1228
01:32:28,092 --> 01:32:31,926
I don't have your daughter!
You're confused.

1229
01:32:32,812 --> 01:32:35,372
And it's "an" axe.

1230
01:32:35,932 --> 01:32:37,923
I am stoned..

1231
01:32:38,692 --> 01:32:41,126
..but I ain't confused.

1232
01:32:42,692 --> 01:32:44,922
You stole my little 'un!

1233
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:55,688
Before we make love,
I wish to shave you.

1234
01:32:56,412 --> 01:32:57,925
I don't need a shave.

1235
01:33:02,012 --> 01:33:04,128
Evening, partygoers.

1236
01:33:35,812 --> 01:33:36,642
Where's Erin?

1237
01:33:40,772 --> 01:33:42,251
I don't hear you.

1238
01:33:42,652 --> 01:33:44,449
Bullshit.

1239
01:33:54,012 --> 01:33:55,525
Tiffany!

1240
01:34:35,932 --> 01:34:36,887
Is Mommy okay?

1241
01:34:37,092 --> 01:34:39,925
She's fine, honey.
We're going to pick her up now.

1242
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:42,930
We will play card games,
have some fun!

1243
01:34:44,292 --> 01:34:45,964
She won't like this.
She told me-

1244
01:34:46,212 --> 01:34:49,921
I don't care what she told you!
How could you let her go alone?

1245
01:34:50,172 --> 01:34:52,766
-I thought you were in jail.
-I made my bail.

1246
01:34:53,012 --> 01:34:55,082
-This son of a bitch your-?
-Hang on.

1247
01:34:55,292 --> 01:34:58,728
Here's your nickel.
Nice dance.

1248
01:34:59,012 --> 01:35:02,322
Would you please
just get out of here?

1249
01:35:06,212 --> 01:35:09,443
Are you that guy
from Price is Right ?

1250
01:35:11,212 --> 01:35:13,567
I am Congressman David Dilbeck.

1251
01:35:13,812 --> 01:35:14,767
Congressman?

1252
01:35:15,012 --> 01:35:16,445
-Yeah.
-No shit?

1253
01:35:16,692 --> 01:35:18,125
Well, I steal wheelchairs..

1254
01:35:18,372 --> 01:35:20,522
..so we got a lot in common.

1255
01:35:21,212 --> 01:35:25,125
I am getting tired. I think
I just killed a lying weasel.

1256
01:35:25,332 --> 01:35:26,526
You did what?

1257
01:35:26,772 --> 01:35:29,161
Beat him with this here club.

1258
01:35:29,412 --> 01:35:32,529
Well then, get out!
And leave us alone!

1259
01:35:32,772 --> 01:35:35,047
I am about to mount this here beauty.

1260
01:35:36,292 --> 01:35:37,566
Maybe not.

1261
01:35:37,812 --> 01:35:40,929
You're talking about my wife.

1262
01:35:42,892 --> 01:35:45,122
It's time for us
to take a little drive.

1263
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:47,931
Malcolm.

1264
01:35:49,892 --> 01:35:51,325
Malcolm!

1265
01:35:57,212 --> 01:36:00,522
-Move it, move it!
-Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1266
01:36:17,572 --> 01:36:19,324
-Get on--
-Keep quiet!

1267
01:36:20,812 --> 01:36:23,690
-Pick a good one. Take it!
-Hurry it up!

1268
01:36:24,212 --> 01:36:25,406
Shit, look at this.

1269
01:36:25,972 --> 01:36:27,644
Help me, you assholes.

1270
01:36:29,212 --> 01:36:30,725
Help!

1271
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:35,566
Stop! Stop!

1272
01:36:36,572 --> 01:36:40,929
I voted against gun control.
Weapons could end up in the wrong hands.

1273
01:36:41,132 --> 01:36:42,451
Will you please shut up?

1274
01:36:53,012 --> 01:36:54,001
What?

1275
01:36:54,492 --> 01:36:57,131
-It doesn't start.
-Come on, man.

1276
01:36:59,612 --> 01:37:01,762
We are in trouble.

1277
01:37:02,012 --> 01:37:03,127
Oh, no!

1278
01:37:13,932 --> 01:37:15,445
That fracture looks bad.

1279
01:37:17,172 --> 01:37:18,844
We ought to drop him off
at the doctor.

1280
01:37:19,612 --> 01:37:23,366
-We're not dropping anybody anywhere.
-My sister Rita done up my arm.

1281
01:37:23,572 --> 01:37:26,405
Oh, really?
I am a great believer in family.

1282
01:37:26,812 --> 01:37:28,131
Do you have a pen and paper?

1283
01:37:28,892 --> 01:37:31,452
It didn't feel the way I thought,
killing a man.

1284
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:33,962
-Killing a man?
-It felt terrible.

1285
01:37:34,532 --> 01:37:37,808
-I want you to write something.
-What?

1286
01:37:40,212 --> 01:37:42,965
I want you to give me
custody of Angela.

1287
01:37:43,212 --> 01:37:44,088
No way.

1288
01:37:44,492 --> 01:37:46,528
You're going to jail
for what you did..

1289
01:37:46,732 --> 01:37:50,281
..and I will not have that child
placed in a foster home.

1290
01:37:51,012 --> 01:37:53,242
So please. A simple note.

1291
01:37:53,772 --> 01:37:56,240
"I, Darrell Grant.."

1292
01:37:56,492 --> 01:37:58,244
I love that little 'un.

1293
01:37:58,492 --> 01:38:01,245
I know you do.
"..give full custody.."

1294
01:38:01,492 --> 01:38:03,005
-You do?
-Yes, I do.

1295
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:06,324
Let's do this for her.
Let's not put her at risk anymore.

1296
01:38:06,532 --> 01:38:09,842
"..to my wife, Erin Grant."

1297
01:38:11,132 --> 01:38:12,724
Okay.

1298
01:38:13,572 --> 01:38:14,641
Good boy.

1299
01:38:20,612 --> 01:38:23,126
You know, you write quite poorly.

1300
01:38:23,812 --> 01:38:25,928
Are you a high-school graduate?

1301
01:38:33,212 --> 01:38:34,088
Shit!

1302
01:38:38,012 --> 01:38:40,526
Everybody just stay put, all right?

1303
01:39:03,612 --> 01:39:05,728
This girl is nuts.

1304
01:39:31,332 --> 01:39:32,970
My prostate doctor said..

1305
01:39:33,212 --> 01:39:36,124
..that I have to urinate
whenever possible.

1306
01:39:36,532 --> 01:39:39,000
Then go relieve yourself over there.

1307
01:39:40,412 --> 01:39:42,926
Pierre, just stay with him.

1308
01:40:04,092 --> 01:40:06,401
Now wake up.
Come on. Here.

1309
01:40:06,732 --> 01:40:07,960
You got to sign this.

1310
01:40:08,212 --> 01:40:10,442
Sign your name,
that's all you got to do..

1311
01:40:10,692 --> 01:40:12,045
..before you get arrested.

1312
01:40:12,292 --> 01:40:14,328
Now come on.
Sign your name.

1313
01:40:17,812 --> 01:40:18,608
There you go.

1314
01:40:20,412 --> 01:40:24,325
"Darrell Grant."
Good boy. Good.

1315
01:40:25,212 --> 01:40:26,531
That's right.

1316
01:40:29,172 --> 01:40:31,003
I am back!

1317
01:40:31,932 --> 01:40:34,127
No more teasing.

1318
01:40:34,892 --> 01:40:37,122
Oh, finally!

1319
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:38,567
What?

1320
01:40:38,812 --> 01:40:41,565
Finally you take me like a man.

1321
01:40:41,812 --> 01:40:44,121
Like a congressman.

1322
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:46,249
I knew you cared for me.

1323
01:40:46,492 --> 01:40:48,687
Malcolm didn't know
what he was talking about.

1324
01:40:48,932 --> 01:40:51,890
-Now take me.
-Here?

1325
01:40:52,092 --> 01:40:54,970
I have got a special spot
picked out for us.

1326
01:40:55,212 --> 01:40:58,522
Get that music box for me,
will you, honey?

1327
01:41:06,092 --> 01:41:09,528
-Sorry, boss. It all happened-
-Shut up, you nitwit!

1328
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:13,731
Don't explain. We got a goddamn
stripper about to bring us all down.

1329
01:41:14,412 --> 01:41:16,130
How do I look?

1330
01:41:16,572 --> 01:41:17,971
Not bad.

1331
01:41:20,292 --> 01:41:22,647
-What happened to him?
-I hit him with a rock.

1332
01:41:22,972 --> 01:41:24,371
Who's the man?

1333
01:41:24,612 --> 01:41:26,170
You're the man.

1334
01:41:26,412 --> 01:41:30,644
You are the man and oh, so strong.

1335
01:41:31,372 --> 01:41:34,330
-Well, here we are.
-Here?

1336
01:41:35,332 --> 01:41:37,448
You ever make it
on a pile of sugar before?

1337
01:41:37,692 --> 01:41:39,728
No, but I am willing to try.

1338
01:41:39,972 --> 01:41:41,371
Well, you're in for a treat.

1339
01:41:41,612 --> 01:41:43,887
You're in for a treat too, darling .

1340
01:41:44,412 --> 01:41:46,562
Now you just let me
put some music on..

1341
01:41:46,812 --> 01:41:49,406
..while you take off
those pretty little pants.

1342
01:41:49,652 --> 01:41:51,768
You'd better put on
some blast goggles.

1343
01:41:52,012 --> 01:41:54,526
Because you're in
for an overwhelming sight.

1344
01:41:54,772 --> 01:41:55,966
Shit! Radio for help!

1345
01:41:56,212 --> 01:41:59,761
What do I tell them?
Congressman Dilbeck abducted a woman.

1346
01:42:00,012 --> 01:42:02,048
They will shut off their radios
and go help him.

1347
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:04,283
So we're it.
A cop and a bouncer.

1348
01:42:04,532 --> 01:42:07,251
Plus two strippers and a kid.
We're in great shape.

1349
01:42:13,652 --> 01:42:15,165
And two.

1350
01:42:15,412 --> 01:42:17,767
How come here?
How come not that yacht?

1351
01:42:18,012 --> 01:42:20,731
I am kind of private.
I don't like people watching.

1352
01:42:20,932 --> 01:42:23,571
Me neither.
I don't like anything kinky.

1353
01:42:23,812 --> 01:42:25,768
I know you don't.
You're a real man.

1354
01:42:26,012 --> 01:42:29,129
I knew it when poor Jerry
was killed and Shad's lawyer.

1355
01:42:29,332 --> 01:42:33,610
I said, "Davey's the real thing.
An M-A-N man."

1356
01:42:33,852 --> 01:42:35,490
A man blackmails you..

1357
01:42:35,732 --> 01:42:37,051
..you got to deal with it!

1358
01:42:37,292 --> 01:42:38,930
You got to be hard and firm.

1359
01:42:39,172 --> 01:42:40,127
And you can dance!

1360
01:42:40,372 --> 01:42:41,964
-Marry me.
-What?

1361
01:42:42,212 --> 01:42:44,043
Marry me. Just say it.

1362
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:45,725
-You are married.
-I know.

1363
01:42:45,932 --> 01:42:48,127
But I'd leave my wife in a heartbeat.

1364
01:42:48,372 --> 01:42:50,932
She wouldn't care.
She doesn't like me anyhow.

1365
01:42:51,172 --> 01:42:54,926
Well, this is very sudden,
and I have a lot to think about.

1366
01:42:55,172 --> 01:42:58,005
-I will make you proud of me.
-I know you would.

1367
01:42:58,252 --> 01:43:01,369
It's like when Jerry said,
"I am going to shake down Dilbeck."

1368
01:43:01,612 --> 01:43:03,011
And I said, "Are you crazy?

1369
01:43:03,252 --> 01:43:06,528
Blackmail a real man like that?"

1370
01:43:06,772 --> 01:43:10,401
I said to Malcolm,
"Just do what you have to do..

1371
01:43:10,652 --> 01:43:13,246
..to Jerry, that fat lawyer.
Just do it!"

1372
01:43:13,492 --> 01:43:16,370
-Just do it.
-Just do it! And he did.

1373
01:43:16,612 --> 01:43:18,489
-Didn't he?
-He sure did.

1374
01:43:18,772 --> 01:43:19,921
You idiot!

1375
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:24,365
-Shit.
-Hi, Malcolm! How you doing?

1376
01:43:24,612 --> 01:43:26,967
I'd like to introduce you
to my fiancee.

1377
01:43:27,172 --> 01:43:28,491
This is Miss Erin Grant.

1378
01:43:28,732 --> 01:43:30,131
Sorry, Davey.

1379
01:43:30,332 --> 01:43:31,685
You both got to go.

1380
01:43:31,932 --> 01:43:33,524
Willie's orders.

1381
01:43:34,612 --> 01:43:35,886
You are sick.

1382
01:43:36,132 --> 01:43:37,565
Murder-suicide, Miss Grant.

1383
01:43:37,892 --> 01:43:38,802
Suicide?

1384
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:42,527
Hell of a story, isn't it?
A congressman and a stripper.

1385
01:43:44,772 --> 01:43:46,410
Excuse me.
What did you call me?

1386
01:43:46,812 --> 01:43:48,530
A stripper.

1387
01:43:49,412 --> 01:43:50,401
Dancer, asshole.

1388
01:43:51,732 --> 01:43:52,528
George Bush!

1389
01:43:53,732 --> 01:43:54,721
That's not George Bush.

1390
01:43:54,932 --> 01:43:57,321
That doesn't look anything
like George Bush.

1391
01:43:59,932 --> 01:44:02,765
Drop them.
You got till three.

1392
01:44:03,012 --> 01:44:03,922
One.

1393
01:44:05,972 --> 01:44:06,848
What are you, nuts?

1394
01:44:07,092 --> 01:44:09,367
Yeah, psycho.

1395
01:44:09,612 --> 01:44:13,525
Delusions of invincibility combined
with a strong homicidal urge.

1396
01:44:15,132 --> 01:44:17,930
I have a kick-your-ass fetish.

1397
01:44:18,532 --> 01:44:19,442
Two.

1398
01:44:28,772 --> 01:44:29,761
Boss?

1399
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:30,927
Three!

1400
01:44:33,132 --> 01:44:34,451
Goddamn it!

1401
01:44:34,692 --> 01:44:36,045
Good evening, everyone.

1402
01:44:36,292 --> 01:44:37,884
Postman, postman

1403
01:44:38,132 --> 01:44:39,451
Do your duty

1404
01:44:39,692 --> 01:44:42,684
Send this letter
To an American beauty

1405
01:44:42,932 --> 01:44:44,923
You're now under arrest.

1406
01:44:45,132 --> 01:44:47,327
For a variety of charges.

1407
01:44:50,892 --> 01:44:52,371
I need some coffee.

1408
01:44:52,732 --> 01:44:55,200
Why don't we start with homicide?

1409
01:44:59,252 --> 01:45:00,765
You're not arresting anyone.

1410
01:45:04,292 --> 01:45:05,520
Black.

1411
01:45:06,012 --> 01:45:06,967
No sugar.

1412
01:45:23,332 --> 01:45:25,607
I said, no sugar.

1413
01:45:32,932 --> 01:45:35,810
You know you have
a serious dandruff problem.

1414
01:45:36,412 --> 01:45:38,130
Ladies!

1415
01:45:40,012 --> 01:45:41,764
Mama! Mama!

1416
01:45:44,012 --> 01:45:45,525
Baby!

1417
01:45:48,012 --> 01:45:51,049
-You okay, Mama?
-I am fine, baby.

1418
01:45:54,012 --> 01:45:56,287
See how you could get tendinitis?

1419
01:45:59,692 --> 01:46:01,728
Come on, guys.

1420
01:46:03,092 --> 01:46:05,367
Congressman, you called
a news conference?

1421
01:46:09,612 --> 01:46:11,443
Holy shit!

1422
01:46:15,572 --> 01:46:16,925
Thank you.

1423
01:46:19,212 --> 01:46:23,569
There comes a time in
every public figure's career..

1424
01:46:23,812 --> 01:46:26,167
..when he has to think
about his future.

1425
01:46:26,372 --> 01:46:28,932
You are making
a tragic mistake here.

1426
01:46:38,412 --> 01:46:42,564
Jerry, that fat lawyer.
Just do it! And he did.

1427
01:46:42,812 --> 01:46:43,961
You idiot!

1428
01:46:45,972 --> 01:46:48,122
Do you have any idea
how nuts this was?

1429
01:46:50,412 --> 01:46:52,130
We're going, baby.

1430
01:46:53,172 --> 01:46:55,128
Thank you for all your help.

1431
01:46:55,372 --> 01:46:56,725
Yeah, likewise.

1432
01:46:56,932 --> 01:46:59,162
Keep me posted
on what you decide to do.

1433
01:46:59,412 --> 01:47:03,166
-Maybe I will run for Congress.
-There's going to be a seat open now.

1434
01:47:12,572 --> 01:47:13,368
