2
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,970
...and well-being of the child.

3
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,140
Therefore, you may make visitation
to you daughter...

4
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,350
...every other week
and on Christmas Eve...

5
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,520
...and on Easter Sunday,
wearing your pretty Easter outfits.

6
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,025
Your honor, my ex-husband is addicted
to pills and he's a thief!

7
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:12,321
Because of his arrest record, I lost
my job as a secretary for the FBI.

8
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,240
He was the finest high-school
tailback I ever saw.

9
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,161
Of course he's had his run-ins
with the law, but he's...

10
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,705
...made his accommodations
with the authorities.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,541
Being an informer
for the Dade County vice squad...

12
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,920
...hardly qualifies him
to raise a seven-year-old!

13
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,422
Neither does being
a mother without a job!

14
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,675
- But I lost it because of him!
- Heh, heh, heh.

15
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,636
Little lady...

16
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,763
...my decision is final.

17
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,684
Next case.

18
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,170
The big man's here!

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,090
- When does she go on?
- Pretty soon, Jerry.

20
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,469
- Welcome to Eager Beaver, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

21
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,057
Keep it close.

22
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,394
- Keep it very close.
- You got it.

23
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,522
Last stop, okay?

24
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,110
- What do you say, congressman?
- Poontang.

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,029
The night is young
and full of promise, my boy.

26
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,698
Great.

27
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,247
Now look, this has to be
the last one. Now I told--

28
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,376
Come on!
We got a rehearsal tomorrow.

29
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,049
Melissa thinks I'm in temple.
What if she calls?

30
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,067
Well, I feel so good
Everybody's getting high

31
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,570
We've got the legendary
twin temples from Fort Lauderdale.

32
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,074
Miss Urbana Sprawl wrapping up
on the great stage.

33
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,292
And I'm so glad you made it
So glad you made it

34
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,213
Nice spot, isn't it, Erb?

35
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,215
It's very uplifting, sir.

36
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,597
- The usual Evian with lime?
- Please.

37
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,724
From Paris, France...

38
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,102
...put it together
for the fabulous Monique, Jr!

39
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,032
- Hey
- Hey

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,533
- You
- You

41
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,494
Oh, my God. I love you!

42
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,496
- Who me?
- Yes, you

43
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,790
Oh, man.

44
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,131
That song is killing me!

45
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,927
Those babies gonna wind up in traction,
you don't play some ballads.

46
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,387
God, it's freezing!

47
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,808
They could store meat in here.
In fact, they do store meat in here.

48
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,060
No, I've been trying all day!

49
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,187
Are you positive?

50
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,897
No, thank you.

51
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,068
- Can't reach her?
- Darrell's phone's out of order.

52
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,030
I just know he's moved with her
again to some new dump.

53
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,449
God, what a nightmare!

54
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,036
He drives around with her in that van.
Drinking, taking pills....

55
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,747
He doesn't even think about
putting a seat belt on her.

56
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,917
He's a dirtbag!
You hang in there, honey.

57
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,377
You'll get Angela back.

58
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,254
That judge will see the light.

59
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,756
It's expensive light,
I'll tell you that.

60
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,217
It's gonna cost me $15,000
for this appeal.

61
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,220
Is there even a chance
I can make that in six weeks?

62
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,516
You'll have to dance day and night
and hope some Arab sheik shows up.

63
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,687
I love you, girls, I do. But I can't
work here when I go back to court.

64
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:18,066
"Your honor, I found a new job.
I'm working at the Eager Beaver."

65
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,777
It's honest work.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

66
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,531
I know that and you know that.
But the judge won't.

67
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,408
Not him.

68
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,037
Ugh....

69
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,416
God, I still get nauseous
before I have to go out there.

70
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,293
You'll get over it.

71
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,172
Really? I can't imagine that.

72
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,093
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

73
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,180
I'll be the sun, shining on you

74
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,641
You guys having a good time?

75
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,185
Here's the lucky guy!

76
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,937
You've come to the right place.
Monique!

77
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,898
Look at these hunks!

78
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,858
We're having a party!

79
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,654
Get out of my dreams

80
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,699
Keep an eye on them bachelors.

81
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,159
Get into my car

82
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,622
They look like real trouble.

83
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,126
Get into my car

84
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,503
Yeah!

85
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,298
Get out of my dreams

86
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,051
Get into my car

87
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,138
- I said, hey
- Hey

88
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,723
- You
- You

89
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,309
Get into my car

90
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:41,566
It's time to strap yourselves in
because you are going for a ride!

91
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,944
In her eighth week here...

92
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,572
...put your hands together
and make her feel good.

93
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,575
For the one, the only Erin Grant!

94
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,994
How about that!

95
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,705
- Larry King's at table six.
- What's he wearing?

96
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,917
- Tank top and gold chains
- That's Larry, all right.

97
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,168
Yo.

98
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,548
- How do I look?
- Better than me.

99
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,509
That ain't easy.
You talk to her?

100
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,679
Darrellβ€™s phone's out of order.
I think he moved again.

101
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,057
I'd embrace the opportunity
to maim his white ass up.

102
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,603
That's really thoughtful, but I
don't think it'd help me in court.

103
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,815
Erin, come on. Chop-chop.
I can't have an empty stage.

104
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,483
Man, let the chumps wait!

105
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:03,440
Money can't buy it, baby

106
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:08,820
Sex can't buy it, baby

107
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:14,326
Drugs can't buy it, baby

108
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,748
You can't buy it, baby

109
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,177
Going to the head.

110
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,054
You'll behave?

111
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,684
I believe in love alone
Yeah, yeah

112
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:58,370
Take the power to set you free

113
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,206
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Yeah!

114
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,124
Throw away the key

115
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,628
Give up your needs

116
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,300
Whoa.

117
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,597
I believe in the power of creation

118
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,350
I believe in the good vibration

119
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,689
An angel appeared.

120
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,652
An angel of pure delight.

121
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,947
What we're coming to

122
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,448
Oh....

123
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,994
Till we watch those dreams come true

124
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:45,083
All the money in the world
Won't buy you peace of mind

125
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:52,173
You can have it all
But you still won't be satisfied

126
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,720
Money can't buy it, baby

127
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,430
Go, Paul!

128
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,266
Sex can't buy it

129
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,559
Yeah!

130
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,938
Go, Paul!

131
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,066
I'm getting married
this weekend to Melissa.

132
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,735
You love Melissa?

133
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,487
- Very much.
- Then go home to her.

134
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,949
Shad!

135
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,035
Shad!

136
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,788
I got every kind of thing
That the money can buy

137
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,876
Listen up! The Flesh Farm
is killing us and you know why?

138
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,420
- They have free buffalo wings.
- Their girls are hookers.

139
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,964
No, because their girls dance fast.

140
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,842
And fast means sweat.
And sweat...

141
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,385
...means drinking!

142
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,222
Oh, my God!

143
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,515
Shad!

144
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,934
What was that?

145
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,438
I got this.

146
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,238
Whoa!

147
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,409
Coming through.
Move out of the way.

148
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,328
Way to go, Davey!

149
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,958
Everybody, go. Run.

150
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,587
Back up! Back the hell up!

151
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,423
- You all right?
- Fine. How about this guy?

152
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,843
Good thing he was drunk.
You could've gotten hurt.

153
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,763
On the main stage,
our lost little pussycat.

154
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:26,601
Put your hands together for the one,
the only Miss Sabrina Hepburn!

155
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,520
Meow!

156
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,113
Meow

157
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,073
- Is this your cat?
- Yoo-hoo

158
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,158
- Look at this cat
- Yoo-hoo

159
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,161
I leave you alone for five minutes!

160
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,373
Will you get in?
Watch your foot, stupid.

161
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,001
Malcolm's gonna shit a brick.
Thank you.

162
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,503
Did I touch any girls?

163
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,381
Not this time,
but you were recognized.

164
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,591
Okay? Happy?

165
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,107
- How are you, little angel?
- I'm fine, thank you.

166
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,235
- Kids just tear me up.
- She's a brave one.

167
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,654
You'll be in my prayers.

168
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,614
God bless you, ma'am.

169
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,672
Last stop, little 'un.

170
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,758
Daddy, you're mean!

171
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,011
Evers and Jennings.
This is the new model, the X12.

172
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,139
- You're happy?
- Oh, mucho happy.

173
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,725
- Mucho happy?
- Get in the van.

174
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,643
Mucho, mucho, mucho!

175
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,773
Get in. We're in a loading zone.
We don't wanna break the law.

176
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,902
Daddy, did you tell Mommy
that we moved?

177
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,323
Of course I did, buttercup.

178
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,908
Of course I did.

179
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,080
How about a wine cooler, Erin?

180
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,083
I got mango, passion fruit--

181
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,129
Water would be just fine,
Alberto. Thanks.

182
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,716
Rita, the reason I stopped by
is Darrellβ€™s moved again...

183
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,052
...and I need his new phone number.

184
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,180
Yeah? Well, you come
to the wrong place.

185
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,433
Rita, please. I hardly sleep nights
and then I break out into--

186
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,479
Look, Erin, I got no idea
where my brother is, okay?

187
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,524
Shit! They got the cat!

188
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,025
Wolves got no restraint.

189
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,694
- Careful, sweetie.
- Shut up!

190
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,740
She's all caught up with them cubs.

191
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,869
Some of the guys down
at the nuclear plant...

192
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,332
...they were asking me
if you'd do, like...

193
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,084
...private parties.

194
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,836
I don't think so.

195
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,213
Oh, that's a shame.

196
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:04,217
Because I'll bet that
you are a great dancer.

197
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,595
Alberto, I'll go crazy if
I don't get Darrellβ€™s new number.

198
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,849
I promised Angie I would
call her every day and--

199
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,392
I hear he moved, Darrell.

200
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,185
Alberto, where is he?

201
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,021
You have to ask Rita about that.

202
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,235
He calls here about twice a week.
Collect.

203
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,696
Need money, as usual...

204
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,573
...but he don't speak to me.

205
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,993
Got no respect for me
even though I am...

206
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,579
...a professional man.

207
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,540
You're looking real good.

208
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,792
Oh, God, I've got such a headache.

209
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,836
Oh, yeah?
You want some Advil?

210
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,589
That would be so great.

211
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,257
Well, now, you sit right here.

212
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,886
I'm gonna fix up
that mean old headache.

213
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,945
Alberto, never mind. I've gotta run,
but thanks anyhow.

214
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,378
Deerfield Beach?

215
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,839
We had a good day, baby.

216
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,842
Phone's ringing.
Think it's Mama?

217
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:32,639
No, little 'un. I talked to her
and she's too busy to call you.

218
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,441
Damn him!

219
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:03,813
Come to me, run to me
Do and be done with me

220
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:08,818
Cold, cold, cold

221
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,821
Don't I exist for you?

222
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,157
Nice leg.
Maybe I'll take it home.

223
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,575
I recommend you let go.

224
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,618
Here's 500, baby.

225
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,870
What'd you say?

226
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,039
Cold

227
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:27,628
Everything I possess
Given with tenderness

228
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:32,633
Wrapped in a ribbon of glass

229
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,095
Time, it may take us

230
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:43,811
But God only knows
How I've paid for those things in the past

231
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:52,945
Dying is easy
It's living that scares me to death

232
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,324
Ooh, yeah

233
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:05,875
I could be so content
Hearing the sound of your breath

234
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,711
Ooh, yeah

235
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,341
Cold is the color of crystal

236
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:20,348
The snowlight that falls
From the heavenly skies

237
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,520
Catch me and let me dive under

238
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:32,318
For I want to swim in the pools
Of your eyes

239
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,699
I want to be with you, baby

240
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:45,623
Oh, slip me inside your heart

241
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,918
What's with Princess Di tonight?

242
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,504
Her husband disappeared
with the kid again.

243
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,968
Nothing can tear us apart

244
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:02,348
Come on now, come on now, come on now

245
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:09,272
Telling you that I loved you
Right from the start

246
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,528
But the more I want you the less I get

247
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:21,701
Ain't that just the way things are?

248
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,466
I don't suppose you'd
accept this in appreciation.

249
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,135
No need.

250
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,263
SeΓ±or Cucaracha
here is gonna make me rich.

251
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,807
Oh, my God!

252
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,434
Is that a roach?

253
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,604
No, it's a fucking shrimp.
Move, you're in my light.

254
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,610
Get some manners, mister!

255
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,114
So this is the new brainstorm, huh?

256
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,619
The Wall Street Journal says
this is the hottest-selling yogurt.

257
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,037
I'll bring this in...

258
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,998
...say my hair fell out
from the shock. Boom.

259
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,875
They pay off bigtime.

260
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,169
Lawyer thinks it's a genius idea.

261
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,255
Your lawyer has an office
over a video store.

262
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,509
Call me a dreamer.
I don't wanna be a bouncer forever.

263
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:25,014
- Erin! Note from Jerry!
- Ooh.

264
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,099
What does it say?

265
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,896
"Dearest Erin: I can help you
get your daughter back.

266
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,024
I ask nothing in return
but a kind smile."

267
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,318
- Yeah, right!
- He's a weirdo.

268
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,279
You guys!
He is totally harmless.

269
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,656
Come on!

270
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,326
"Also, could you add
Kenny G to your routine?

271
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,536
Anything from his Christmas album."

272
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,038
That's sweet.

273
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,165
We could do a Christmas show here!

274
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,835
Seriously, it couldn't hurt
to talk to him, right?

275
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,339
- Only talking, no touching.
- Ladies! Attention!

276
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,342
- Major announcement.
- Major asshole.

277
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,802
I heard that.

278
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,347
On Monday, I'm installing a ring.

279
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,432
- Oh, no.
- Mud wrestling?

280
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,018
No, no, no. This is something
that's really happening.

281
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,229
It's contemporary. It's now.

282
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,731
And it's creamed-corn wrestling.

283
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,233
- Corn?
- Corn wrestling?

284
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,985
That's disgusting!

285
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,946
I'm not putting these in corn.
No way!

286
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,073
What? No, it's terrific!

287
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,158
In Israel, we did falafel wrestling.

288
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,287
All the girls broke out
in hives everywhere.

289
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,955
And I mean, everywhere!

290
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,541
Well, falafel, sure.
This is corn!

291
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,586
- What is this, a mutiny?
- I don't think so.

292
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,340
No chance that I'm gonna roll
around naked in creamed corn...

293
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,136
...with drunken yahoos trying
to stick niblets up my hoo-hah.

294
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,055
Not naked. Topless.

295
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,558
Health Department won't go for naked.

296
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,934
Not with food products.

297
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,270
I always liked the Health Department.

298
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,730
So you'll think about it?

299
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,565
- Not for one second.
- Erin!

300
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,860
Please!
You're getting a big following here.

301
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,571
Even with that shit music,
the guys love you.

302
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,409
You go into the corn, you set
a great example to the other girls.

303
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,370
No.

304
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:13,998
I got it!

305
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,625
How about pasta wrestling?

306
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,960
Now that's classy.

307
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,630
Linguine, rigatoni?
Just nothing with meat or fish.

308
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,384
Orly, if I wanted to wrestle...

309
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,679
...I would've joined
the World Wrestling Federation.

310
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,060
- And speaking of real class?
- What's the problem?

311
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,481
We hate these.
They degrade women and beavers.

312
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,401
I'll take it under advisement.
But just the coasters and the napkins.

313
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,071
Not the sign.
That's a landmark!

314
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,533
Good night, darling.

315
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,628
For you, Miss Grant.

316
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,965
They're beautiful, Jerry.
Thank you.

317
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,258
You can call me Erin--

318
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,844
I can't.
I worship you too much.

319
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,055
Believe me...

320
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,516
...I'm no one to be worshiped.

321
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,643
I'm just trying to make a living.

322
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,269
I worship your essence.

323
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,773
If you were a nurse or a teacher,
I'd feel the same.

324
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,191
You receive my note?

325
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,779
I did and, you know, I was wondering
what you had in mind.

326
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,990
I believe I can help you
get your daughter back.

327
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,868
I believe I can
get to Judge Fingerhut.

328
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,539
- How?
- Through...

329
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,668
...a certain congressman who
I'm certain will listen to me...

330
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,254
...because I know some things.

331
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,924
Things? Really?

332
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,636
Well, you know what, Jerry?
You're really a terrific guy...

333
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,681
...and so supportive of me
ever since I started here.

334
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,433
Maybe you shouldn't--

335
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,935
Just give me a week.

336
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,564
Good night, my precious.

337
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,618
Melissa thinks I was in synagogue
the night this happened.

338
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,537
What do I tell her?

339
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,458
You left synagogue and a gang
of skinheads jumped you in the parking lot.

340
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,586
In the meantime, we'll develop these,
we'll see what we have.

341
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,131
I see mucho damages. These strip
joints are insured up the ass.

342
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,633
My neck really feels better,
Uncle Al.

343
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,343
Oh, yeah?

344
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,013
How's it feel now?

345
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,481
Call Little Caesars.

346
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,108
Order me a health pizza.
Get some for yourself.

347
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,027
No, thank you, sir.
I'm dieting.

348
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,696
I'll just grab a yogurt
out of the fridge.

349
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,437
This is a major disaster!

350
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,649
Major. Unbelievable.
Without doubt...

351
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:31,362
...the most asinine piece
of human behavior.

352
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,740
It's never gonna
happen again, Malcolm.

353
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,617
I've got it under control.

354
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,661
You see...

355
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,039
...I just love naked women.
It's a character flaw.

356
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,332
God's testing me--

357
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,627
Oh, will you shut up!
You idiot.

358
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,589
You can't talk to me like that.
I'm a U.S. congressman.

359
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,468
I can't? You go psycho in a titty bar
six weeks before the election.

360
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,055
What should I call you?
Winston fucking Churchill?

361
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,515
It was all I could do to keep...

362
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:03,602
...Willie Rojo from strangling you
with his bare hands.

363
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,187
Everybody has a bad night.

364
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:09,108
If you're under pressure like we are,
under the public eye--

365
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,653
Who recognized me?

366
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,947
His name...

367
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,241
...is Jerry Killian.

368
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,786
And he's waiting outside.

369
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,871
Now?

370
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:27,042
Now. We gotta move on this
before we get eaten alive.

371
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,335
Move on what?

372
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,422
If this is a shakedown,
get Willie to pay them like always.

373
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,884
- Why drag me into it--
- Because it's not about money.

374
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,262
- It's not?
- No.

375
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,142
He wants you to persuade
Judge Fingerhut...

376
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:47,271
...to reverse a child custody case
for some stripper.

377
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,315
Who he's porking?

378
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,651
It's disgraceful to have
a man like me deal with--

379
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,778
He's not porking her.

380
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,241
Well, then, why does he care?

381
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,660
Because he's nuts!

382
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,163
That's why he's dangerous.

383
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:08,792
If he was porking her, at least
I could deal with him man to man...

384
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,711
...but this is fruitcake love.

385
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:18,761
I mean, Fingerhut's a democrat.
He won't listen to me.

386
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,764
You can't say that
to this little creep, Davey.

387
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,183
You gotta string him along.

388
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,060
Bullshit him.

389
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,480
Use the old...

390
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,523
...Dilbeck charm.

391
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,197
What if he doesn't go for it?

392
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,867
Then we have a serious problem.

393
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,374
Mr. Killian!

394
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,252
Come in and meet
Congressman Dilbeck.

395
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,259
I'll bet that's Jerry Killian.

396
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,554
Lucy!

397
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,308
Come here.

398
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,853
Come on.

399
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,773
How perfect is this?

400
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,735
You know, I was just thinking...

401
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,115
...is this really on
the same planet as Miami?

402
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,745
I can read.

403
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,915
Where's Andy?

404
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,918
He's been fishing since 8.

405
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,670
Dad!

406
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,547
Dad!

407
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,799
There's a floater!

408
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,191
He's still got his glasses on.

409
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,444
Yeah.

410
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,738
Go tell Mom to call the police.

411
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,866
- You're the police.
- I'm the Miami police.

412
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,076
We just need the local law here.

413
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,828
Go on.

414
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,961
Man.

415
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,632
Of all the lakes...

416
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,260
...in all the counties...

417
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,928
...in all the world...

418
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,265
...you gotta float up in mine.

419
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,727
You son of a bitch.

420
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,772
Mama!

421
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,483
Hey, come here!

422
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,735
I've been trying to reach you, baby.

423
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,571
Heard you stole my sister's mail!

424
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,740
That's a federal offense.

425
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,659
Wait for Mommy.
I'm gonna go talk to Daddy.

426
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,458
Why do you keep moving?
How will she make any friends?

427
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,084
Aren't we the child psych--

428
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,463
It has nothing to do with child
psychology, you moron!

429
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,256
Where's she going to school?

430
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,177
Opa-Iocka? Deerfield Beach?
Have you even thought about it?

431
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,138
Yeah, I thought about it plenty.

432
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,310
Hey, you only got two hours!

433
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,396
That's what the judge ruled,
right there, from that bench!

434
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,609
I'll be right behind you just in case
you're thinking about snatching her!

435
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,529
Mommy, does "snatch" mean "kidnap"?

436
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,032
- How did you get so smart?
- Heh, heh, heh.

437
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,425
Is Free Willy back yet?

438
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,554
Still out.

439
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:54,142
People are pigs.
Sit on movies like they own them.

440
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,603
Freak.

441
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,071
It's Shad. Open up.

442
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,407
It wasn't me. It was a temp.

443
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,284
Where's Perry Mason?

444
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,621
Our good friend, Mr. Shad!
Come on in, we have lots to discuss.

445
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,707
No shit.

446
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,838
If I buzz twice, you say my mother's
on the line. She has chest pains.

447
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,591
What do you mean
he's a wheelchair salesman?

448
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,051
There's one nice thing about hospitals.

449
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,222
A lot of kids in chairs are
really sick, and I wave at them...

450
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,808
...and they smile
just like on Jerry Lewis.

451
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,645
- And do you do this every day?
- On Fridays I stay with Aunt Rita.

452
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,064
That's a wholesome environment.

453
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,816
She has real wolves.

454
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,569
I don't want you
touching those animals.

455
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,113
They're not like dogs.

456
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:01,585
Time.

457
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,796
I love you more than
anything in the world.

458
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,382
- You know that in your heart.
- Mm-hm.

459
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,842
- Mommy?
- What, baby?

460
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,386
Do you know those dolls you got me?

461
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,556
Daddy says he can't
find them anywhere.

462
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,893
We'll get you new ones.

463
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,146
- I love you.
- Bye, baby. I love you.

464
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,648
Hey, let's go!

465
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,278
All right, you go on.
I'll bring your stuff.

466
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,078
Hey, baby!
Did you have a good day?

467
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,497
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

468
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,754
She told me about your new profession.
Really admirable.

469
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,214
At least I ain't naked.

470
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,715
"At least I ain't naked"?

471
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,051
You get caught using
that child in a felony...

472
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,972
- ...and Family Services will put her--
- No way I'd get caught.

473
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,768
Got me one of them doctor's
jackets and a stethoscope.

474
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,855
Look like one of them dudes on ER.

475
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,566
Darrell, would you think
for once in your life?

476
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,776
Hey!

477
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,323
I don't need no stripper
telling me how to behave.

478
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,909
I'll see you in two weeks.

479
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,333
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.

480
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,730
You know where that was taken?

481
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,690
Your mama's birthday party.

482
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:51,361
Heh, heh. The Eager Beaver. Last
Wednesday. Can you identify those people?

483
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,239
Yeah, this old fool. Erin.

484
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,741
Erin's the stripper?

485
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,826
What'd you say?

486
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,828
Erin's the stripper.

487
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,789
- Dancer, fat-ass.
- Dancer. She's a dancer!

488
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,833
All right, look.

489
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:09,463
The young man who was
so savagely beaten...

490
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,132
...is my client, Paul Guber.

491
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,676
No shit. Too bad for him.

492
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,762
I don't think so.

493
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,639
The third person in that photo
is none other than...

494
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,476
...David L. Dilbeck.

495
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,479
So what?

496
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,815
Do you follow politics, Mr. Shad?

497
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,611
Do I look like I follow politics?

498
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,197
David Dilbeck
is the United States congressman...

499
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,366
...from the fifth district.
He's up for reelection in six weeks.

500
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,745
You gonna put the squeeze on him.

501
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:45,040
Nice.
What that gotta do with me?

502
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,001
I'll give you 10 percent of the squeeze.

503
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,302
Is this conceivably
as big as the yogurt deal?

504
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,014
"As big"? Heh.

505
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:05,811
Congressman Dilbeck is chairman
of the subcommittee on sugar, okay?

506
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,438
The Rojo family cannot
allow him to lose.

507
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:13,401
Because their price supports are worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

508
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,403
And quite frankly, Mr. Shad...

509
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,282
...this is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

510
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,452
Good.

511
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,788
Just keep Erin out of it.

512
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,123
I'll do my best.

513
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,209
She's out. Erin is out.
Erin who?

514
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,008
Whoo-hoo!

515
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,428
They're all the time
Getting in front of me

516
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,972
Charming spot.

517
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,932
Look. Steven Spielberg's house.

518
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:48,270
I wish he'd come in here.
I'm sure he would have big hots for me.

519
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,188
You'd turn his whole life around.

520
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:54,776
Steven Spielberg's shower. Can you
imagine me and him in that shower?

521
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,697
- Oh, that cute little beard!
- Yours or his?

522
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:04,870
Hey, Jerry, it's Erin Grant.
What a long beep.

523
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,038
Someone's waiting for you.

524
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,999
Maybe you're out of town....

525
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,170
I'm just calling to see about
that legal matter we discussed.

526
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,631
If you get a chance,
just give me a call at the club.

527
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,508
Thanks, bye.

528
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,762
- Michael Jordan's at table eight!
- Great.

529
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,349
Say hello to
the fantastic Monique, Jr!

530
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,902
Lieutenant Garcia with homicide.

531
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,737
What's he want with Erin?

532
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,739
Got no idea.

533
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,782
All I need is scandal.

534
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,252
What do you know about Prozac?

535
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,298
It makes you happy.
There's side effects.

536
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,634
Like what?

537
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,636
Limp noodle.

538
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,179
Who cares?

539
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,933
I haven't had a hard-on
since I started running this place.

540
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,478
Closest I got was Sea World.

541
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,397
Porpoise got me hot.

542
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,777
What the fuck
you telling me that for?

543
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,033
I'm going next door.
See what Ling's up to.

544
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,498
- Drowned?
- Yeah.

545
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,625
Oh, my God.

546
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,920
He had pictures of you
all over his apartment.

547
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,716
He was a really big fan.
He used to bring me flowers--

548
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,053
He was just a fan?
There was no touching?

549
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,014
This has been a real pleasure.

550
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,100
I dance, so I must turn tricks?

551
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,979
Nice way to open a conversation.
"I understand you're a hooker?"

552
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,439
You don't work in a library here.

553
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,818
I'm trying to figure out
the man's life.

554
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,736
He was a customer.

555
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,781
That's all I know about his life.
Except that it's over.

556
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,784
Okay. I apologize.

557
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,246
Sincerely. Look, I'm real--
I'm nowhere on this.

558
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,915
I could use some--
Please give me a minute?

559
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,627
Please?

560
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,634
- So where did this happen?
- Lake Okeechobee.

561
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,848
It's where I made the serious
mistake of taking my vacation.

562
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,603
Your family? Nice.

563
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,402
It's not the kind of place
you'd expect to encounter a homicide.

564
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,530
- Homicide? You said he drowned.
- No, we did an autopsy.

565
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,784
The water in his lungs,
they come up clean.

566
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,704
- There was tap water in his lungs?
- Exactly.

567
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:56,624
Somebody killed him, like in a bathtub,
then dumped the body in a lake.

568
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,460
Do you read mysteries?

569
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,797
Up till three months ago,
I worked at the FBI in Miami.

570
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:07,886
A secretary. Until I got fired
for having a defective husband.

571
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,560
I'm in a pretty bad custody fight.
Jerry was trying to help me.

572
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,687
From the shores of the Dead Sea...

573
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,190
...a decorated nurse
in the Israeli army...

574
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:25,070
...say shalom to
the fabulous Ariel Sharon!

575
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,328
Ah

576
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,377
Could we go outside?
I could really use some air.

577
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,992
I don't like you

578
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,537
But I love you

579
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:21,668
Seems that I'm always thinking of you

580
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:26,339
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly

581
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,633
I love you madly

582
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,260
Oh!

583
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,637
You really got a hold on me

584
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,098
Really got a hold on me

585
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,350
You really got a hold on me

586
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,688
Oh, Mr. Orly!
What a wonderful surprise.

587
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,315
Nice to be in quality club, eh?

588
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,860
Yeah, if you like freak shows.

589
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,987
Ling! Ling!
Get over here!

590
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,405
Move it!

591
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,031
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

592
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,159
But that's Mr. Chris Rojo...

593
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,327
...of the sugar Rojos.

594
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,747
Typical of the kind
of rich big shots we get here.

595
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,709
My love is strong now

596
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,920
You really got a hold on me

597
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,965
Really got a hold on me

598
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,051
You really got a hold on me

599
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,804
Really got a hold on me

600
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,056
Baby

601
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,102
Is this the place
where I met my angel?

602
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,063
I don't know which angel
you're referring to.

603
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,403
- A congressman?
- A congressman.

604
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,363
You mean a U.S. congressman?

605
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,741
Well, he wasn't specific who it was.

606
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,367
I told him it was bananas...

607
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,662
...and maybe it was better
that he stayed out of it.

608
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,249
On Wednesday, there was an incident,
a guy with a bottle--

609
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:48,004
Oh, he was a total whack job.
Drunk out of his mind.

610
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,341
Can you remember,
was Mr. Killian here?

611
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,927
No, not offhand, but maybe.

612
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,805
Think about that and let me know.
Here's all my numbers.

613
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,476
Once again, I apologize.
I mean, for any aspersions.

614
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,607
You wanna make it up to me?

615
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,652
- I beg your pardon?
- I need a favor.

616
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,112
You've got friends on the vice squad?

617
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,906
They're not my bosom buddies.

618
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,866
My ex-husband's an informant.

619
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,369
It's why this idiot judge
gave him custody.

620
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,579
- Are you joking?
- I wish.

621
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:26,000
But I was thinking,
if vice dumped him as an informer...

622
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,836
...when my appeal
came up in six weeks...

623
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,131
...I could then say
my ex-husband is unfit.

624
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,969
- He's such a criminal--
- Wait a minute. He's a criminal?

625
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,304
Your ex? He's a criminal?

626
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,101
He steals wheelchairs.
Thank you very much.

627
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,064
All right, let me see what I can do.

628
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,985
- Good night.
- You know, not having her around...

629
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,654
...it's like my heart is missing.

630
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,031
I'm sure.

631
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,951
Let me see what I can do.

632
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,913
Good night.

633
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,681
How much you pay them?

634
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,892
I think they're up to $30 a day.

635
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,520
Subtract room and board,
booze and smokes.

636
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,482
You know, who knows?
Maybe they pay us! Ha, ha, ha!

637
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,736
- Hell of a business.
- It's the best!

638
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,904
We gotta protect it,
my friend, right?

639
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,451
Son, I've been protecting
your family for 20 years.

640
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,453
You're the greatest, man!

641
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,331
I'm saying, until the election,
no more girls, huh?

642
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,833
Bring your wife down here
for a weekend.

643
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:52,337
What's her name? Alice?
Mary Pat. Mary Pat.

644
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:57,216
Chris, I met an angel.

645
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,179
- I mean, she's a dancer.
- Oh.

646
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,726
She's so pure and clean.
Not like the rest of these whores.

647
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,436
- If I could be with her--
- What?

648
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,729
You'd be a good boy?

649
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,107
I'd be perfect. I'd be perfect.
I swear I would.

650
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,151
I would stop going to clubs.

651
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,111
I would stop drinking.

652
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,822
I would just lead
a regular life, you know?

653
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,785
With my wife and a steady mistress.

654
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,663
And I would have a decent life.

655
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,832
So let's do it!
Where'd you see her?

656
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,090
My brain has just turned to shit.

657
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,509
That's why you're in Congress!

658
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,973
You're probably right.

659
00:44:54,942 --> 00:45:01,155
I look up to the little bird

660
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:07,620
That glides across the sky

661
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:16,462
He sings the clearest melody

662
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:23,428
It makes me want to cry

663
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:31,102
It makes me want to sit right down
And cry, cry, cry

664
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,187
Yeah

665
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:39,527
I walk along the city streets

666
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:45,116
So dark with rage and fear

667
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:54,959
And I
I wish that I could be that bird

668
00:45:55,127 --> 00:46:01,674
And fly away from here

669
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:10,433
I wish I had the wings
To fly away from here

670
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,520
But my, my, I feel so low

671
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:18,399
My, my, where do I go?

672
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,278
My, my, what do I know?

673
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:26,365
My, my, we reap what we sow

674
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,452
They always said that you knew best

675
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,081
But this little bird's fallen out
Of that nest now

676
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:38,044
I've got a feeling
That it might have been blessed

677
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:42,340
So I've just got to put these wings to test

678
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,437
Who is it?

679
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,357
It's Lieutenant Garcia.
Is it a bad time now?

680
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,984
No, just a second.
I was rehearsing.

681
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,742
Morning.

682
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,745
Morning. I was nearby.
I probably should've call--

683
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,206
No, no, it's fine.
Please come on in.

684
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,708
Thank you.

685
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,921
Can I get you some coffee
or English muffin?

686
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,006
No, no, thanks.

687
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,884
You know, I was thinking...

688
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,720
...and if I had to guess,
I would say...

689
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:34,058
...that Jerry was probably there
because he was there most nights.

690
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,018
So do you know anything new?

691
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,813
Actually, I have some good news...

692
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,482
...and I have some mediocre news.

693
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,403
The good news is Darrell
lost his informant status.

694
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,321
Yes!

695
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,531
9:00 this morning.

696
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,451
Vice thought his information
was bogus anyway.

697
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,622
This is great! Now in six weeks,
I can go to the judge--

698
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,208
That's the mediocre part.

699
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,337
Judge Fingerhut had a heart attack
early this morning...

700
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,423
...at a porno theater on Ocean.

701
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,134
- Don't tell me that!
- He was DOA...

702
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,261
...at Don Shula Hospital.

703
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:15,057
Anyway, I called around,
and the earliest....

704
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,060
It'll be six months
before your appeal's heard.

705
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,437
The system is all backed up.

706
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:23,107
I can't allow her to stay
with him for another six months!

707
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,110
There's nothing you can do
from a legal standpoint.

708
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,195
Absolutely nothing.

709
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,992
I understand.

710
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,953
Is today Friday?

711
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,663
Yeah, it's Friday.

712
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,665
I gotta run now.

713
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,449
- How are you?
- All right.

714
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,132
You're wonderful, Mr. Dilbeck!

715
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,388
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Phil, how you doing?

716
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,599
Shalom, darling. Shalom to you.

717
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,019
Manischewitz!

718
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,732
Congressman. Alan Mordecai.

719
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,151
- Alan, how you been?
- Fine, sir.

720
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,488
Congressman, I brought
a little souvenir for you.

721
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,450
Obviously, the ramifications of that,
if it were to become public--

722
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,578
- Is this me?
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

723
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,707
If this became public,
it would be devastating...

724
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,668
- ...and I'd like to avoid that.
- It's her.

725
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,547
It's my angel.

726
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,926
Heel! Slow down!
Heel, will you? Heel!

727
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,922
Are you going to your house, Mama?

728
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,883
No, we're going to our house.

729
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,177
For the whole day?

730
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,345
Even better.

731
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,847
Really?

732
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,516
Really.

733
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,031
You snatched me, didn't you?

734
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,912
I guess I did.

735
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,455
You sure did.

736
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,594
Come on, pumpkin.
Zippity-doo-dah.

737
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,690
I didn't know she had a child.

738
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,442
Of course you--

739
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,362
She's divorced, but the husband
has custody. Remember?

740
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,031
She's carrying numerous bags.

741
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,870
That doesn't look like just
a visitation, does it, Erb?

742
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,163
I'll look into it.

743
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,874
Check custody status
of Ms. Erin Grant.

744
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,794
God, give me strength.

745
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,297
What an extraordinary creature.

746
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,468
How perfect in every detail.

747
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:23,055
Davey, you promised you'd behave
until after the election.

748
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,308
You don't understand.
This is love.

749
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,810
Please.

750
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,146
I won't campaign...

751
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,606
...until I can possess...

752
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,442
...her actual velvet self.

753
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,530
In the meantime, I want you
to bring me something.

754
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,949
Something of hers.

755
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,492
Something...

756
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,703
...personal to tide me over.

757
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,080
How personal?

758
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,792
Intensely personal.

759
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,555
Am I a good help?

760
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:09,059
Honey, you are the best
laundry assistant I've ever had.

761
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,066
All right, let's hit the road, Jack.

762
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,359
Who's Jack?

763
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,321
It's just an expression.
Come on.

764
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,218
This is some picture.

765
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,763
It's fatal.

766
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,599
I don't accede to blackmail.

767
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,518
Willie, I agree with you
in principle...

768
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,521
...but this gets out,
we're in a bigtime shitstorm.

769
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,524
Pop, pay the guy off.

770
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,111
You got a cancer,
you talk nice to it?

771
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:46,156
- No. You cut it out.
- Willie.

772
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,076
We can't operate like
we're in the funeral business.

773
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:53,289
I'd rather buy cops than
pay blackmail. Understood?

774
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,001
I just think we should
consider other options.

775
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,794
Understood?

776
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,008
Yes.

777
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,729
What else?

778
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,314
A connected matter.

779
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,734
Davey wants to nail this stripper,
and I'd like to use the boat.

780
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,653
That way, we can control
the situation.

781
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,906
- She's the girl from the picture?
- That's correct.

782
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,118
- What does she know?
- Well, we gotta find out.

783
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:35,080
The good news is she got custody
of her child illegally, so she's vulnerable.

784
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,583
Vulnerable isn't good enough.

785
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,711
I say let Davey have his fun.
Then lose her.

786
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,923
Willie, Willie.

787
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,635
First, let's determine
whether she can hurt us or not.

788
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,263
I'm sure she's just
another dumb whore.

789
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,391
For her sake, I hope so.

790
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,439
Phooey! I go back three.

791
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,944
- This is complicated.
- It's easy.

792
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,281
All right, is it your turn?

793
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,534
Uh-uh. You stay here with us,
sweetie. Mama's orders.

794
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,912
Everybody, listen up.

795
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,332
This is Lorelei.

796
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,377
Formerly of the Flesh Farm.

797
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:25,547
She and her snake, Monty Python,
have signed an exclusive...

798
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:26,840
...contract with us.

799
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,592
You've got a snake?

800
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,804
- Monty.
- And she starts tomorrow.

801
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,556
So why don't we make
her feel at home...

802
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:38,185
...and give her a real
Eager Beaver welcome!

803
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:39,812
Welcome, darling.

804
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,481
I'm Ariel, Miss Gaza Strip.

805
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,108
I'm Tiffany Glass.

806
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,320
- How big is your snake?
- It's big.

807
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,781
So what brings you here?

808
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,951
Just what we needed, another blonde!

809
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,828
What the hell is that?

810
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,205
It just came from Ling's.

811
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,999
Monty sleeps with the fishes.

812
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,378
Lorelei has no idea, right?

813
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,422
No, it just got here.

814
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,133
It's fresh.

815
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,635
Go rustle up a new snake.

816
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:15,097
Where? The A&P? Who the fuck
carries pythons at 10:00 at night?

817
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,642
There's an all-night
snake farm on Route 27.

818
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,644
Ask for Jungle Juan.

819
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,063
And get rid of that.

820
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,816
God, I hate this business.

821
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,484
You know why?

822
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,778
It's lost its humanity.

823
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,699
- Say hello to a gorgeous creature...
- Bring change.

824
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,535
...the unbelievable Erin Grant!

825
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:52,885
I look up to the little bird

826
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:59,308
That glides across the sky

827
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:08,567
He sings the clearest melody

828
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:15,073
It makes me want to cry

829
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:22,789
It makes me want to sit right down
And cry, cry, cry

830
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,082
Yeah

831
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:31,924
I walk along the city streets

832
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,593
All right!

833
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,803
Yeah!

834
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:46,813
And I
I wish that I could be that bird

835
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:53,695
And fly away from here

836
00:58:54,739 --> 00:59:02,120
I wish I had the wings to fly away from here
Yeah

837
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,500
But my, my, I feel so low

838
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:10,379
My, my, where do I go?

839
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:14,091
My, my, what do I know?

840
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:18,220
My, my, we reap what we sow

841
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,390
They always said that you knew best

842
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:25,852
But this little bird's fallen
Out of that nest now

843
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,106
I've got a feeling
That it might have been blessed

844
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:35,612
So I've just got to put these wings to test

845
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,500
Because he believes in the family...

846
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,045
...in the values that made us
a God-fearing people.

847
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,674
Because he's long been
a friend of this organization.

848
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:08,270
Get him out of there.
Preferably with his clothes on.

849
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,528
David-- Oh, my God!

850
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,114
Tell me I'm dreaming. Please.

851
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:23,493
No, no, no!
I cannot believe this!

852
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,454
No, no, no! Davey, no!

853
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,581
Is this lint fresh?

854
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,042
- Hot out of the Maytag.
- Oh.

855
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,338
You just can't imagine!

856
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:38,383
This is the very essence
of that glorious creature.

857
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:42,429
I gotta say, even for you,
Davey, this is off the charts!

858
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,014
Why are you shiny?

859
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,808
It's Vaseline.

860
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,063
It's Vas--
Great. It's Vaseline.

861
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,940
You've never covered yourself
with Vaseline?

862
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,984
Not unless I have third-degree burns.

863
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:01,114
You don't know what you're missing.
I've got it all over.

864
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:06,036
It's down in my boots. I can feel
it squishing in between my toes.

865
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:10,916
All right, okay. Davey,
the Young Christians are waiting so....

866
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,586
- When will I see her?
- It's in the works.

867
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,546
- When?
- It's in the works!

868
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,591
Clean yourself up!

869
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:24,513
I did not go into politics to pimp
for a twisted old fuck like you!

870
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,598
I've had it, Davey.

871
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,935
I quit.

872
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,481
You are such a child.

873
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,943
Davey! Davey! Davey!

874
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:42,656
Onward, Christian soldiers

875
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:47,035
Marching as to war

876
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:51,331
With the cross of Jesus

877
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:55,252
Going on before

878
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:59,256
Christ, the royal Master

879
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:03,301
Leads against the foe

880
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,805
Forward into battle

881
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:10,851
See his banners go

882
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:16,064
Onward, Christian soldiers

883
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,234
Marching as to war

884
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,362
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

885
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,826
You are too kind.
You are too kind.

886
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:36,042
What a privilege for me to be here
for you good people tonight...

887
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,920
...and to talk about an issue
that is so critical...

888
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:43,008
...to this campaign and
to all of the American people.

889
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,844
I'm talking about the issue...

890
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,555
...of family values.

891
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,742
Where's Monty?
He isn't here yet.

892
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,453
He's on his way.
Relax.

893
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,207
Do me a favor and watch Angela?

894
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,959
I'm gonna get my car,
it's pouring out.

895
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,420
- Yeah, sure, gorgeous.
- Thanks.

896
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,383
Where have you been all night?

897
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:29,846
Doing my Christmas shopping early.
Martha Stewart recommends it.

898
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,477
If that's not a snake,
then it's an amazing belt.

899
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:40,065
I gotta find a new line of work.
This shit is getting out of hand.

900
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,734
Let me put this down
and walk you to your car.

901
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:45,070
I'm fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.

902
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,631
- Evening, everybody.
- Shit!

903
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:08,176
- Where's my little 'un?
- Where you can't get her.

904
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,389
Is that ever the wrong answer.
Bring her to me now!

905
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:15,475
I am not bringing her to you
in this lifetime.

906
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:19,479
I'll go to that judge and tell him
my whore of a wife abducted--

907
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,148
Guess what, Darrell?
The judge is dead.

908
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,317
So you'll just have to kill me.

909
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:27,404
- Go on!
- Think I'm afraid to?

910
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:30,115
Think I don't have the manliness
to take your life?

911
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,450
I think you are all man.

912
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:37,414
That death row-lethal injection thing?
That's not gonna scare you.

913
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,834
They'd never execute a daddy.

914
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,544
Drop the knife.

915
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,129
You got till three. One.

916
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,298
Suck my dick.

917
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,550
Whip the little fella out. Two.

918
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,303
This here is a domestic squabble.

919
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,140
Ah!

920
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,683
Three.

921
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,352
You broke my arm!

922
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,062
You sure?

923
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,655
- Bitch!
- Bully!

924
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,327
Argh! Argh!

925
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,997
I'm gonna get you!

926
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,337
- Are you okay?
- Just had a tiff with my ex.

927
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:29,674
I know what that's like.
Did you see? Monty finally got here.

928
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,343
That's great, Lorelei.

929
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,721
Hey, baby. Say hi to Erin.

930
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,514
- Cute.
- Homicide.

931
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,016
Lieutenant Garcia.

932
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,187
She's a kidnapper!

933
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,022
Watch your head there.

934
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,360
The fact is he threatened,
and he did not attempt.

935
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,863
What if he kills me?
Can I press charges then?

936
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,532
The law is the law.
I'll screw around here.

937
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:59,037
If you like, I'll lose your paperwork.
He makes bail, she's his.

938
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,709
I should split and
take her to New England.

939
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,003
Understand this.

940
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:10,757
If you split without formal custody,
you'll lose her forever.

941
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,135
I've dealt with Family Services.
They are pencil pushers.

942
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,138
- This is by the book.
- I'm dealing with a maniac.

943
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,933
I understand.
I repeat, you can't take off.

944
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,435
You cannot.

945
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,398
You might have a bigger problem.

946
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,818
- I can't have a bigger problem!
- Look at this.

947
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,905
Any of these clowns the one
who might have assaulted Mr. Guber?

948
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,417
This clown.

949
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:49,671
- You're positive?
- Absolutely.

950
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:54,092
Who is he? He looks
like that guy on F Troop.

951
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,095
That's Congressman Dilbeck.

952
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,431
This nut is a congressman?

953
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,767
You haven't heard from him?
From any of his staff?

954
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:04,561
No.

955
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:06,813
Wait.

956
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,358
This is who
Jerry was talking about.

957
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,611
Are you saying I am in danger
from a congressman?

958
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:14,863
No.

959
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:19,951
Let me know if you hear
from him though.

960
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,787
I think that's in both our interests.

961
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,790
How did I get so popular?

962
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:32,130
Hush, little baby
Don't you cry

963
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:37,469
Mama's gonna buy you a something

964
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,138
Pumpkin pie.

965
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,640
Oh, you're awake.

966
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,477
- Can Mommy put you down?
- No.

967
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,312
Fair enough.

968
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,334
Mommy.

969
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,711
- Brush your teeth.
- I'm too tired.

970
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,839
Okay, don't brush your teeth.
Go on to bed.

971
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,931
"Mr. Dilbeck requests the pleasure
of your company for a private dance.

972
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:27,018
You'll receive $2,000 cash
for a one-hour set.

973
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:32,148
Obviously, discretion and confidentiality
are of the utmost importance."

974
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:45,453
Mommy, do you like dancing?

975
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,580
Why are you still awake?

976
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:51,084
I was just thinking.
Do you like dancing?

977
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,544
Not really.

978
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:55,213
- It's not fun?
- No.

979
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,715
You're just dancing.

980
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,053
Just dancing's fun, honey.
Sure, that part of the job.

981
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,806
What's not fun?
The customers?

982
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:08,184
Urbana said some of them
are mean and stupid.

983
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:14,065
Pumpkin, have you ever seen me dance?

984
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,403
Have you?

985
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:22,407
- I told the girls that--
- I came out tonight.

986
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,413
While I was dancing?

987
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,212
You looked really pretty.

988
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,089
No, I didn't.

989
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:41,134
Yeah, you did.
You looked great.

990
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,850
Thank you, baby.

991
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:55,106
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

992
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:58,234
Welcome to the
Miami Seaquarium's Top Deck.

993
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:04,657
We are going to celebrate the oceans
and all the living things in them...

994
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:09,162
...as we proudly present to you
a splash of the islands.

995
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,793
Okay, now, I need all
the camp kids to come with me.

996
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,129
Come on. You too.

997
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,842
It's okay. You can go.
Go on. It's all right.

998
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,638
I'll be right here.

999
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,975
Don't worry.

1000
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,312
She's spent so little time with kids....

1001
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:37,273
It'll change.
Once she's with you full-time.

1002
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,150
I hope so.

1003
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:42,862
Let me get this straight.
He offered you two grand?

1004
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,156
To dance for one hour?

1005
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:51,162
- I don't know.
- I can't turn it down, Al.

1006
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:55,708
Now that I have Angie with me,
I've gotta find another job immediately.

1007
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,337
Which will pay me nothing
compared to what I'm making now.

1008
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,673
But, you know...

1009
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,176
...she saw me last night.
Can you imagine?

1010
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:09,097
Was she upset?

1011
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,684
She said no, but come on.
One day she's gonna realize...

1012
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,686
...and say, "That was my mother."

1013
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:22,527
How about you? You ready
to feed Flipper? Step here.

1014
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
Oh, my God.

1015
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,826
- It's safe, though, right?
- What?

1016
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:33,037
With Dilbeck. I'm bringing Shad.

1017
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:37,417
I think as long as they think you
don't know anything, you'll be fine.

1018
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,835
Keep your ears open.

1019
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:41,421
What will you do with her tonight?

1020
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,755
Urbana said that she'd--

1021
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:45,883
Why don't you drop her
off at our house?

1022
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,261
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

1023
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,431
I told Donna everything.
Your whole situation.

1024
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,559
She said if you needed a hand
she'd love to help.

1025
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,770
She doesn't think I'm something
out of A Current Affair?

1026
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,899
Come on, you're a terrific girl.
You know that.

1027
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:05,945
So you made a mistake. You married
a bum. What are you gonna do?

1028
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,781
You gonna beat yourself up
for the rest of your life?

1029
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,577
Well, I usually don't,
but it's....

1030
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,663
I mean, it's just that...

1031
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:18,291
...you know, she saw me dancing.

1032
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,585
Yeah.

1033
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,463
It'll all work out.

1034
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:26,758
I want her free and clear,
whatever it takes.

1035
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,891
Good job, baby!

1036
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,505
- You're Mrs. Grant?
- No, I'm Barbara Bush.

1037
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:08,132
- Who is he?
- George Bush.

1038
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,134
George Bush is not invited.

1039
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,471
- Take a hike.
- Heh, heh, heh.

1040
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,139
Oh, no, no.

1041
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,517
See, if he goes, I go.

1042
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,814
Raise your hands.
I gotta pat you down.

1043
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:25,441
Stop.

1044
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,861
Right this way.

1045
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:55,054
Your lips and mine
Two sips of wine

1046
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:59,809
Memories are made of this

1047
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:06,149
Then add the wedding bells

1048
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,693
One house where lovers dwell

1049
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:13,531
Hello, Erin.
My name is Congressman Dilbeck.

1050
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,869
You are--
You're a beauty. Heh, heh.

1051
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:23,332
Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays

1052
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,293
Good evening.

1053
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,045
I'm Erin Grant.

1054
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,593
And you must be....

1055
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,596
Convak Dilvak.

1056
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:39,599
Congressman Dildo.

1057
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:44,770
I am Congressman David Dilbeck.

1058
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:48,232
And welcome, welcome.

1059
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:51,277
Welcome.

1060
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,655
You are truly, truly welcome.

1061
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:55,907
Thank you.

1062
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,784
Have we ever met before?

1063
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:00,912
No, no, no, no, no.

1064
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:03,748
But actually, I have seen...

1065
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:07,793
...many, many beautiful
photographs of you.

1066
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,840
Well, I'm honored.
And a congressman.

1067
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:17,303
Very successful congressman
you must be.

1068
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:19,138
This is not my boat.

1069
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:23,601
It belongs to a very
close friend of mine.

1070
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:26,938
Do you like Dino?

1071
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:34,654
Dean's great, yeah.
But you know, I've brought my own.

1072
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,823
Do you care for The Artist
Formerly Known as Prince?

1073
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:40,785
Fold in lightly with a dream

1074
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,287
I care for you.

1075
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:46,332
Your lips and mine

1076
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,086
So, George, you get to watch
any of the auditions?

1077
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:53,381
- Watch, my ass. I do the hiring.
- No, no, no.

1078
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,799
I've seen every girl in Florida.

1079
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,135
What are the criteria?
Monster jugs?

1080
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,888
Firmness is crucial.

1081
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:04,016
I gotta hold them for a while.
Shake them.

1082
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,227
You shake their tits?

1083
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:11,357
It ain't no picnic, man.
Got tendinitis in my right wrist.

1084
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,026
On a rainy day, it's agony.

1085
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,196
You audition anybody famous?

1086
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,491
- What?
- You know, before they were famous.

1087
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:24,495
Sure did.

1088
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,497
Meryl Streep.

1089
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,834
Come on!
Meryl Streep stripped?

1090
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,004
One of the best.

1091
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,715
Chesty La France.

1092
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,718
That was Meryl.

1093
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,847
Chesty La France. I heard of her.

1094
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:04,785
Ooh!

1095
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,580
I give you anything you want.

1096
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,707
A diamond ring.

1097
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,250
A Lexus.

1098
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,878
I'll get you a condo on the beach.

1099
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,421
Just be my girlfriend.

1100
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,382
- Can't do that.
- Why not?

1101
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:22,219
I love you.

1102
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:25,556
You don't know what
I've done for you recently.

1103
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,267
Really? And what was that?

1104
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:32,104
I talked to Judge Fingerhut
about your daughter.

1105
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,315
You did?

1106
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:37,693
And how did you know about my case?

1107
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:39,987
Little birdie told me.

1108
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:43,908
It must have been a little old
birdie who knew me very well.

1109
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:45,701
"Who" is not important.

1110
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:47,912
Come on now.

1111
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:51,123
Not just a little hint.

1112
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,460
I can't do that.

1113
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,590
But I know the new judge.

1114
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:04,303
He's a very good friend of mine.
The Honorable Jack Goldberg.

1115
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,723
He'll be more amenable.

1116
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:14,021
Darling, if you just come
into Davey's life...

1117
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,440
...good things will happen.

1118
01:18:16,733 --> 01:18:18,818
You don't know how much
I worship you.

1119
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:21,654
How much?

1120
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:26,450
I sent my aide, Erb,
over to your Laundromat.

1121
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:30,037
He brought back some of your lint.

1122
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:31,956
My lint?

1123
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:33,791
Fresh...

1124
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:36,293
...hot lint.

1125
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:43,467
And what did you do
with that fresh, hot lint?

1126
01:18:45,011 --> 01:18:47,138
I'm afraid I made love to it.

1127
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:56,480
Close your eyes.
I've got a little surprise for you.

1128
01:18:56,773 --> 01:18:58,524
Keep them closed.

1129
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:00,860
No peeking.

1130
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,406
- Ow!
- Don't invade my private life again...

1131
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,324
...or I'll kill you. You understand?

1132
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:09,452
Show's over, big boy.

1133
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,997
This is abnormal.

1134
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:17,543
You'll come back tomorrow?
Same time?

1135
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:19,170
I don't think so.

1136
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:21,714
I'll give you $5,000.

1137
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:25,384
Five thousand dollars for no sex?
You love me that much.

1138
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:30,347
Just the touch of your hand
sets my pecker on fire.

1139
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,184
Maybe you should see a doctor.

1140
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:34,560
Same time tomorrow?

1141
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:38,189
If I come, can we talk more
about my case?

1142
01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:41,400
We can talk about anything.
As long as you're naked.

1143
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,403
We'll see.

1144
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,038
Good evening.

1145
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:55,706
Good evening.

1146
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,876
You don't know me.
I'm Malcolm Moldovsky.

1147
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:00,753
Dilbeck's right hand.

1148
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,464
You must be a very busy man.

1149
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:06,967
TouchΓ©.

1150
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,929
I wish to give you some advice...

1151
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,848
...about your adorable
little daughter, Angela.

1152
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:16,894
- What about her?
- Your custody of her is illegal.

1153
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,731
That's just temporary
until the appeal gets heard--

1154
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,651
Please, please, Miss Grant.

1155
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:26,153
Really, it's of no concern to us.

1156
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:30,366
As long as you refuse to cooperate
with certain individuals...

1157
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:33,911
...who seek to harm
and slur Congressman Dilbeck...

1158
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:37,623
...for their own selfish
political gain.

1159
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:47,508
I don't know what you're
talking about. Excuse me.

1160
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,135
Perhaps you don't.

1161
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:54,306
But what a pity if Angela were
to be placed in a state home.

1162
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:55,975
Pretty grim, most of them.

1163
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:59,937
A lot of strange people working there.

1164
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:05,025
I'd recommend that you cooperate
with us for the child's sake.

1165
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:09,780
Which means you talk
to no one about tonight...

1166
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,908
...or any night.

1167
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:15,828
Understood?

1168
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,372
Of course.

1169
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:21,917
Good.

1170
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,961
Now if you'll excuse me...

1171
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:27,047
...I'd better toss the congressman
into a cold shower.

1172
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:33,554
By the way, I can see why
he's so taken by your charms.

1173
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,640
Good night.

1174
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,644
Watch your step on the gangplank.

1175
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:51,238
She ain't dumb enough.

1176
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:58,829
- Try anything?
- No.

1177
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:01,248
He ask you back?

1178
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,001
No.

1179
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,338
Aren't we Miss Talkative tonight?

1180
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,506
I'm a little tired.

1181
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,055
What's the matter, baby?
Come on.

1182
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,685
Monty.

1183
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,357
- All right!
- Yeah.

1184
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:32,029
This reptile's a freaking lemon.

1185
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:33,864
Who are you?

1186
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,366
Help!

1187
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,747
- So how did it go?
- Fine.

1188
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,042
- No problems?
- No, none.

1189
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:48,253
But no information.

1190
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:51,715
Zero.

1191
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:54,718
Look, I gotta run, you know.
Angela's wiped.

1192
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,096
I'll see you later, okay?

1193
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,104
Come on, come on!

1194
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:07,898
Come on, you can do it!

1195
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,234
Get this off of me.

1196
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:11,735
Do something!

1197
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:15,072
I'm doing something.
I'm protecting you.

1198
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:18,575
- Stand back.
- Oh, my God. What a show.

1199
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,620
That's not Monty!

1200
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:25,040
You're fine, hon. You'll be fine.

1201
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:27,084
Who was that snake?

1202
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,253
It doesn't look bad.

1203
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,589
What happened here?

1204
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:35,926
We got a problem with a dead snake.

1205
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,053
Gee, that's funny.

1206
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:40,264
So do I.

1207
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:46,145
Here's that brilliant, charming
attorney of yours, Mr. Mordecai.

1208
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:52,818
Found him 400 yards offshore.
Now show him the rest of his kisser.

1209
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:58,657
Crabs find lawyers
a particular delicacy.

1210
01:23:59,325 --> 01:24:00,451
Looks like lasagna.

1211
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:03,120
Cover that shit up.

1212
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,999
You wanna tell me why your name
was on his calendar for tomorrow?

1213
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:11,378
I was involved in litigation
with a yogurt company.

1214
01:24:13,339 --> 01:24:16,175
From my limited experience,
this isn't something...

1215
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,136
...a yogurt company
would ordinarily do.

1216
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:22,473
He represented the kid
who got mauled at your club.

1217
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,809
Now that I find fascinating, Shad.

1218
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,145
He had a picture. Ugh.

1219
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,856
Man, I'm gonna lose it.

1220
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:33,317
No, no. A picture of what?

1221
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:35,819
A legislator?

1222
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,739
Yeah, beating a kid's ass.

1223
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:41,992
- Where's the original?
- I got no idea.

1224
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,829
Here, freshen up.

1225
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,750
All right, thanks.

1226
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:52,753
- Can I interest you in dessert?
- Just the check.

1227
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:55,506
- Come here.
- Ha, ha, ha.

1228
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:59,009
- Dilbeck didn't invite her back?
- She said no.

1229
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:03,722
That's good. I don't think she should
go there again, even with you.

1230
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:06,892
She seemed all edgy tonight.

1231
01:25:07,143 --> 01:25:10,187
Man, she got her moods.
Could be that time of month.

1232
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:14,191
So you're like the gynecologist-bouncer,
bouncer-gynecologist.

1233
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,945
- I just watch out for the girl.
- So do I.

1234
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:21,240
That's a grand total
of two people in Florida.

1235
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:25,452
The higher-ups in my department
aren't pushing this investigation.

1236
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:28,038
- Because of this asshole congressman?
- Bingo.

1237
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:31,458
We got two homicides here,
and nobody gives a shit.

1238
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:33,961
And I'm worried about that girl.

1239
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,214
She's out there all by herself.

1240
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:12,958
Where's the sheriff?

1241
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,266
Hello, city desk?

1242
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:43,822
It is an unusual time
for a news conference...

1243
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:46,617
...but the congressman feels
it will dramatize his message.

1244
01:26:46,826 --> 01:26:48,243
We'll send a camera crew.

1245
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:51,246
- Confirm?
- There won't be any need to confirm.

1246
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,290
- Got everything.
- Thank you.

1247
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,959
Good morning, pumpkin.
How'd you sleep?

1248
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:57,836
Good. How about you?

1249
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:00,339
Well, I just--
I slept great, honey.

1250
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:08,889
Want some cereal?

1251
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,974
Not right now.

1252
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,355
- Good morning.
- Hello, CNN?

1253
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,273
- May I help you?
- News desk.

1254
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:19,900
One second, please.

1255
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,401
This is Jennifer...

1256
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:24,529
...and I'm calling from
Congressman Dilbeck's office.

1257
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:27,366
Malcolm Moldovsky asked me to call...

1258
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:29,660
...about the news conference
at the refinery.

1259
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:32,829
Mm-hm.

1260
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:42,673
- Ugh!
- Quit moving!

1261
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,343
Whose Mercedes is that?

1262
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:49,930
- Some orthodontist from Tampa.
- God, what would Mom say?

1263
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:52,432
She'd say, "Nice fucking car." Ow!

1264
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,185
You got a mouth like a sewer!

1265
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,188
I need some morphine.

1266
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,190
I don't got none for humans.

1267
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,525
What do you mean?

1268
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:04,361
All's I got is some
from when Lupa had her cubs.

1269
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,905
- Wolf morphine?
- I don't know. I think so.

1270
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:10,242
So give me. I'm dying.
Busted arm, two nights in jail.

1271
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,244
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Darrell!

1272
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:17,332
How'd you break it?

1273
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:21,211
Playing polo with Donald Trump, okay?

1274
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:27,259
It says here you take two
every four hours with a bowl of milk.

1275
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,761
Sounds good to me.

1276
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,888
I said two!

1277
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,766
Goddamn it!

1278
01:28:47,947 --> 01:28:51,408
You have to throw down a spade,
another seven, unless you have an eight.

1279
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:53,118
Then you can change suits.

1280
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:57,748
So that's why
they call it Crazy Eights.

1281
01:28:58,374 --> 01:28:59,875
When are you coming back?

1282
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:02,502
By two. But I hope
you will be asleep.

1283
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:05,505
We'll take care of her.
Don't worry.

1284
01:29:07,467 --> 01:29:08,467
You're going out?

1285
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,094
I'll be back by two.
I'll dance the late shift.

1286
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:13,972
- Can you tell me where you--?
- No, I can't.

1287
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:20,020
- You be good, pumpkin.
- I will.

1288
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:22,481
She'll be fine.

1289
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,775
Don't worry.

1290
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:25,984
See you, baby.

1291
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:30,280
You're going to the boat?

1292
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:34,409
Not without me.

1293
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,246
I'll be late.

1294
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:39,498
Listen up.

1295
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,125
- You said you weren't going.
- I didn't want anybody to know.

1296
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:43,502
- Like who?
- Garcia.

1297
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:46,296
Then just say, "Don't tell Garcia."
What's up?

1298
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:49,549
They'll put Angela in a foster home
if I don't keep my mouth shut.

1299
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,637
- Says who?
- Dilbeck's guy, that creep Moldovsky.

1300
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:58,183
Promise me you will stay with her
every second. I need to know that.

1301
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,310
I can't let you go there alone.

1302
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:04,356
They're gonna pay me $5,000.
I need the money.

1303
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:07,984
I need to get out of here and
live a normal, fully-dressed life...

1304
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,654
...with shopping lists
and school buses.

1305
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:13,365
If they wanted to kill me,
they would have.

1306
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:15,158
Let me get this straight.

1307
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:18,537
So you gonna go there, dance
and come back here.

1308
01:30:19,163 --> 01:30:20,247
Correct.

1309
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:22,499
Something's up.

1310
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,835
I've got it under control.

1311
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,838
Promise me you'll stay
with Angela every second.

1312
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:34,094
- I'll see you later.
- Erin.

1313
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,355
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.

1314
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:41,912
Sorry.

1315
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:46,833
You speak English?

1316
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:49,753
Sometime.

1317
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:53,590
What do you think
about the people you work for?

1318
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,259
They're filth.

1319
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:58,762
Exploiters of the poor.

1320
01:32:00,264 --> 01:32:03,308
I think you and I are gonna
get along just fine.

1321
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:09,940
For $5,000, I expect to get laid.
It's only human.

1322
01:32:10,149 --> 01:32:11,691
Davey, listen to me.

1323
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,611
That beautiful lady
doesn't understand.

1324
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:19,616
She doesn't understand what it's like
to make love to a congressman.

1325
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,451
The ecstasy, the wonderful--

1326
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:24,788
Listen to me, you sick fuck!

1327
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:27,499
She's been meeting with a cop.

1328
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:29,626
Maybe he's from the titty squad.

1329
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:31,461
He's homicide.

1330
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,381
She used to work
at the FBI as a secretary.

1331
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:38,343
This bitch is poison.
She's out to slaughter us.

1332
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:40,845
Make a fool of me.

1333
01:32:42,181 --> 01:32:46,017
Screw yourself bowlegged,
Davey of the Navy.

1334
01:32:47,186 --> 01:32:49,813
Then let us handle it.
I'll be on the top deck.

1335
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:58,822
I thought she cared for me.

1336
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,168
We're heavy.

1337
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:15,046
Copy.

1338
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,340
- Uh-huh.
- No cheating.

1339
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:20,427
- One, two, three....
- Doesn't look good.

1340
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,637
- Whee!
- Can't get a break.

1341
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:27,684
Shad's a loser. Shad's a loser.

1342
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:30,186
Yo! Yo!

1343
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:32,188
All right, Miss Angela.

1344
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:33,648
Six!

1345
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,900
She always gets six.

1346
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:18,902
Sweet dreams are made of this

1347
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:22,572
Who am I to disagree?

1348
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:26,534
I travel the world and the seven seas

1349
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:30,121
Everybody's looking for something

1350
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:34,042
Some of them want to use you

1351
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,253
Down, Bowser. Be patient.

1352
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:38,755
Don't tease me!

1353
01:34:39,423 --> 01:34:42,717
I'm not teasing.
You just sit back...

1354
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:45,011
...relax, have yourself another drink.

1355
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:48,848
Because tonight is the night.

1356
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:53,603
It sure is.

1357
01:34:57,858 --> 01:35:02,320
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?

1358
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:04,948
Ah! Ow!

1359
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,618
Who are you?

1360
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,286
I want my daughter.

1361
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:14,374
What? Chico!
How'd you get onboard?

1362
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:17,043
My little 'un. I want her.

1363
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:22,173
Your "little 'un,"
whoever she is, is not here.

1364
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:25,468
Chico!

1365
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,846
Keep your head up
Moving on

1366
01:35:30,474 --> 01:35:31,975
What's this?

1367
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:35,562
- Damn!
- Yeah, look....

1368
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:46,781
Well, there's a sight
to raise the dead.

1369
01:35:48,325 --> 01:35:50,493
Who's that old freak?

1370
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,289
Hold on a second.

1371
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:56,416
I know who that is.

1372
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:58,918
Is that the--? Hey.

1373
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,881
Is that that guy
from Price Is Right?

1374
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:05,341
- Hey!
- Argh!

1375
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,178
Oh, damn.

1376
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,432
You got my daughter...

1377
01:36:12,683 --> 01:36:15,059
...and now you try
and kill me with a ax!

1378
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:19,689
I don't have your daughter!
You're confused.

1379
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:23,318
And it's "an" axe.

1380
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:25,945
I'm stoned...

1381
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:29,949
- ...but I ain't confused.
- Hey. Hey!

1382
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,244
You stole my little 'un!

1383
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:37,290
Sweet dreams are made of this

1384
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,001
Who am I to disagree?

1385
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:44,464
Before we make love,
I wish to shave you.

1386
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,841
I don't need a shave.

1387
01:36:47,009 --> 01:36:50,887
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you

1388
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:52,764
Evening, partygoers.

1389
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:56,059
Some of them want to get used by you

1390
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:59,938
Some of them want to abuse you

1391
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:04,609
Some of them want to be abused

1392
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:19,207
Sweet dreams are made of this

1393
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:22,794
Who am I to disagree?

1394
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:25,755
I travel the world and the seven seas

1395
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:27,298
Where's Erin?

1396
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:30,635
Everybody's looking for something

1397
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:33,012
I don't hear you.

1398
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:35,306
Bullshit.

1399
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:45,108
Hold your head up
Keep your head up

1400
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:46,484
Tiffany!

1401
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:48,152
Hold your head up
Moving on

1402
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,029
Keep your head up
Moving on

1403
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:51,906
Hold your head up
Moving on

1404
01:37:52,074 --> 01:37:53,867
Keep your head up
Moving on

1405
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,785
Hold your head up
Moving on

1406
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:57,328
Keep your head up

1407
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:00,832
Yeah!

1408
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:05,545
- Tiffany!
- Here we go, babe! Here we go!

1409
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:16,973
Sweet dreams are made of this

1410
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:20,643
Who am I to disagree?

1411
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:24,480
I travel the world and the seven seas

1412
01:38:24,648 --> 01:38:27,817
Everybody's looking for something

1413
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:29,986
Is Mommy okay?

1414
01:38:30,195 --> 01:38:33,156
She's fine, honey.
We're gonna pick her up now.

1415
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:36,326
We'll play card games,
have some fun!

1416
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:39,495
She won't like this.
She told me--

1417
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:43,583
I don't care what she told you!
How could you let her go alone?

1418
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:46,628
- I thought you were in jail.
- I made my bail.

1419
01:38:46,879 --> 01:38:49,047
- This son of a bitch your--?
- Hang on.

1420
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:52,842
Here's your nickel.
Nice dance.

1421
01:38:53,135 --> 01:38:57,680
- Would you please just get out of here?
- Unh! Ow!

1422
01:38:59,725 --> 01:39:04,020
Hey. Are you that guy
from Price Is Right?

1423
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:08,316
No. I'm Congressman David Dilbeck.

1424
01:39:08,567 --> 01:39:09,567
Congressman?

1425
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:11,319
- Yeah.
- No shit?

1426
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:13,071
Well, I steal wheelchairs...

1427
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:15,573
...so we got a lot in common.

1428
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:20,370
I'm getting tired. I think
I just killed a lying weasel.

1429
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:21,829
You did what?

1430
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:24,582
Beat him with this here club.

1431
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:28,086
Well then, get out!
And leave us alone!

1432
01:39:28,337 --> 01:39:30,713
I'm about to mount this here beauty.

1433
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:33,341
Maybe not.

1434
01:39:33,592 --> 01:39:36,844
You're talking about my wife.

1435
01:39:38,889 --> 01:39:41,224
It's time for us
to take a little drive.

1436
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,143
Malcolm.

1437
01:39:46,188 --> 01:39:47,689
Malcolm!

1438
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:57,281
- Move it, move it!
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1439
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,884
- Get on--
- Keep quiet!

1440
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:21,431
- Pick a good one. Take it!
- Hurry it up!

1441
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:23,224
Shit, look at this.

1442
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:25,560
Help me, you assholes.

1443
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:28,771
Help!

1444
01:40:32,484 --> 01:40:33,818
Stop! Stop!

1445
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:39,407
I voted against gun control.
Weapons could end up in the wrong hands.

1446
01:40:39,616 --> 01:40:40,992
Will you please shut up?

1447
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,046
What?

1448
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:56,299
- It doesn't start.
- Come on, man.

1449
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:01,137
We are in trouble.

1450
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:02,555
Oh, no!

1451
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:10,438
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1452
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:15,401
That fracture looks bad.

1453
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:18,946
We ought to drop him off
at the doctor.

1454
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:23,659
- We're not dropping anybody anywhere.
- My sister Rita done up my arm.

1455
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:26,829
Oh, really?
I'm a great believer in family.

1456
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:28,623
Do you have a pen and paper?

1457
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:32,085
It didn't feel the way I thought,
killing a man.

1458
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:34,712
- Killing a man?
- It felt terrible.

1459
01:41:35,297 --> 01:41:38,716
- I want you to write something.
- What?

1460
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:44,097
I want you to give me
custody of Angela.

1461
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:47,809
- No way.
- You're going to jail for what you did...

1462
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:51,729
...and I will not have that child
placed in a foster home.

1463
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,816
So please. A simple note.

1464
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:57,944
"I, Darrell Grant..."

1465
01:41:58,195 --> 01:42:00,029
I love that little 'un.

1466
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:03,157
I know you do.
"...give full custody..."

1467
01:42:03,408 --> 01:42:04,992
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

1468
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:08,454
Let's do this for her.
Let's not put her at risk anymore.

1469
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:12,125
"...to my wife, Erin Grant."

1470
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:15,128
Okay.

1471
01:42:16,004 --> 01:42:17,130
Good boy.

1472
01:42:23,345 --> 01:42:25,972
You know, you write quite poorly.

1473
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:28,891
Are you a high-school graduate?

1474
01:42:34,898 --> 01:42:36,232
Darrell.

1475
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:37,483
Shit!

1476
01:42:41,488 --> 01:42:44,115
Everybody just stay put, all right?

1477
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,391
This girl is nuts.

1478
01:43:37,085 --> 01:43:38,794
My prostate doctor said...

1479
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:42,089
...that I have to urinate
whenever possible.

1480
01:43:42,507 --> 01:43:45,092
Then go relieve yourself over there.

1481
01:43:45,427 --> 01:43:49,180
Go. Pierre, just stay with him.

1482
01:43:52,976 --> 01:43:53,976
Darrell?

1483
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,104
Darrell? Darrell!

1484
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:13,663
Now wake up.
Come on. Here

1485
01:44:13,997 --> 01:44:15,289
You gotta sign this.

1486
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,875
Sign your name,
that's all you gotta do...

1487
01:44:18,126 --> 01:44:19,543
...before you get arrested.

1488
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:21,921
Now come on.
Sign your name.

1489
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:27,510
There you go.

1490
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:32,348
"Darrell Grant."
Good boy. Good.

1491
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:34,642
That's right.

1492
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:39,313
I'm back!

1493
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:42,566
No more teasing.

1494
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,695
Oh, finally.

1495
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:47,196
What?

1496
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:50,324
Finally you take me like a man.

1497
01:44:50,575 --> 01:44:52,994
Like a congressman.

1498
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:55,204
I knew you cared for me.

1499
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:57,748
Malcolm didn't know
what he was talking about.

1500
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,085
- Now take me.
- Here?

1501
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:04,297
I've got a special spot
picked out for us.

1502
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:08,009
Get that music box for me,
will you, honey?

1503
01:45:15,892 --> 01:45:19,478
- Sorry, boss. It all happened--
- Shut up, you nitwit!

1504
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:23,858
Don't explain. We got a goddamn
stripper about to bring us all down.

1505
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:26,360
How do I look?

1506
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,279
Not bad.

1507
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:33,159
- What happened to him?
- I hit him with a rock.

1508
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:34,952
Who's the man?

1509
01:45:35,203 --> 01:45:36,829
You're the man.

1510
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:41,500
You are the man and oh, so strong.

1511
01:45:42,252 --> 01:45:45,338
- Well, here we are.
- Here?

1512
01:45:46,381 --> 01:45:48,591
You ever make it
on a pile of sugar before?

1513
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:50,968
No, but I'm willing to try.

1514
01:45:51,219 --> 01:45:52,678
Well, you're in for a treat.

1515
01:45:52,929 --> 01:45:55,306
You're in for a treat too, darling.

1516
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:58,100
Now you just let me
put some music on...

1517
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:01,062
...while you take off
those pretty little pants.

1518
01:46:01,313 --> 01:46:03,522
You'd better put on
some blast goggles.

1519
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:06,400
Because you're in
for an overwhelming sight.

1520
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:07,902
Shit! Radio for help!

1521
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:11,864
What do I tell them?
Congressman Dilbeck abducted a woman.

1522
01:46:12,115 --> 01:46:14,241
They'll shut off their radios
and go help him.

1523
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:16,577
So we're it.
A cop and a bouncer.

1524
01:46:16,828 --> 01:46:19,663
Plus two strippers and a kid.
We're in great shape.

1525
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:30,633
And two. How come here?
How come not that yacht?

1526
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:33,719
I'm kind of private.
I don't like people watching.

1527
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:36,680
Me neither.
I don't like anything kinky.

1528
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:38,974
I know you don't.
You're a real man.

1529
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:42,478
I knew it when poor Jerry
was killed and Shad's lawyer.

1530
01:46:42,687 --> 01:46:47,149
I said, "Davey's the real thing.
An M-A-N man."

1531
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:49,110
A man blackmails you...

1532
01:46:49,361 --> 01:46:50,736
...you got to deal with it!

1533
01:46:50,987 --> 01:46:52,696
You got to be hard and firm.

1534
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:53,948
Whoo! And you can dance.

1535
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:55,866
- Marry me.
- What?

1536
01:46:56,118 --> 01:46:58,035
Marry me. Just say it.

1537
01:46:58,286 --> 01:46:59,787
- You are married.
- I know.

1538
01:46:59,996 --> 01:47:02,289
But I'd leave my wife in a heartbeat.

1539
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:05,209
She wouldn't care.
She doesn't like me anyhow.

1540
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:09,380
Well, this is very sudden,
and I have a lot to think about.

1541
01:47:09,631 --> 01:47:12,591
- I'll make you proud of me.
- I know you would.

1542
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:16,095
It's like when Jerry said,
"I'm gonna shake down Dilbeck."

1543
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:17,805
And I said, "Are you crazy?

1544
01:47:18,056 --> 01:47:21,475
Blackmail a real man like that?"

1545
01:47:21,726 --> 01:47:25,521
I said to Malcolm,
"Just do what you have to do...

1546
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:28,482
...to Jerry, that fat lawyer.
Just do it!"

1547
01:47:28,733 --> 01:47:31,735
- Just do it.
- Just do it! And he did.

1548
01:47:31,987 --> 01:47:33,946
- Didn't he?
- He sure did.

1549
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:35,448
You idiot!

1550
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:40,077
- Shit.
- Hi, Malcolm! How you doing?

1551
01:47:40,328 --> 01:47:42,788
I'd like to introduce you
to my fiancΓ©e.

1552
01:47:42,998 --> 01:47:44,373
This is Miss Erin Grant.

1553
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:46,083
Sorry, Davey.

1554
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:47,710
You both gotta go.

1555
01:47:47,961 --> 01:47:49,628
Willie's orders.

1556
01:47:50,755 --> 01:47:52,089
You are sick.

1557
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:55,134
- Murder-suicide, Miss Grant.
- Suicide?

1558
01:47:55,343 --> 01:47:59,013
Hell of a story, isn't it?
A congressman and a stripper.

1559
01:48:01,349 --> 01:48:03,058
Excuse me.
What did you call me?

1560
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:05,269
A stripper.

1561
01:48:06,188 --> 01:48:07,229
Dancer, asshole.

1562
01:48:08,607 --> 01:48:10,274
George Bush!

1563
01:48:10,692 --> 01:48:14,445
That's not George Bush.
That doesn't look anything like George Bush.

1564
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:20,117
Drop them.
You got till three.

1565
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:21,327
One.

1566
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:26,999
- What are you, nuts?
- Yeah, psycho.

1567
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:31,337
Delusions of invincibility combined
with a strong homicidal urge.

1568
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:35,925
I have a kick-your-ass fetish.

1569
01:48:36,551 --> 01:48:37,593
Two.

1570
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:48,270
Boss?

1571
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,480
Three!

1572
01:48:49,731 --> 01:48:53,150
Nico. Ah! Goddamn it!

1573
01:48:53,401 --> 01:48:54,777
Good evening, everyone.

1574
01:48:55,278 --> 01:48:56,737
Postman, postman

1575
01:48:56,988 --> 01:48:58,364
Do your duty

1576
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:01,742
Send this letter
To an American beauty

1577
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:04,078
You're now under arrest.

1578
01:49:04,287 --> 01:49:06,580
For a variety of charges.

1579
01:49:10,293 --> 01:49:11,835
I need some coffee.

1580
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:14,797
Why don't we start with homicide.

1581
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:20,594
You're not arresting anyone.

1582
01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:25,558
Black.

1583
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:27,059
No sugar.

1584
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:46,495
I said, no sugar.

1585
01:49:54,129 --> 01:49:57,131
You know you have
a serious dandruff problem.

1586
01:49:57,757 --> 01:49:59,550
Ladies!

1587
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:03,345
Mama! Mama!

1588
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:07,266
Baby!

1589
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:13,022
- You okay, Mama?
- I'm fine, baby.

1590
01:50:16,109 --> 01:50:18,485
See how you could get tendinitis?

1591
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:24,158
Come on, guys.

1592
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:27,953
Congressman, you called
a news conference?

1593
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:34,293
Holy shit!

1594
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:41,884
Thank you.

1595
01:50:42,385 --> 01:50:46,930
There comes a time in
every public figure's career...

1596
01:50:47,182 --> 01:50:49,642
...when he has to think
about his future.

1597
01:50:49,851 --> 01:50:52,519
You are making
a tragic mistake here.

1598
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:06,742
--Jerry, fat lawyer. Just do it! And he did.

1599
01:51:06,993 --> 01:51:08,202
You idiot!

1600
01:51:10,288 --> 01:51:12,539
Do you have any idea
how nuts this was?

1601
01:51:13,249 --> 01:51:14,249
Mama?

1602
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:16,710
We're going, baby.

1603
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:19,838
Thank you for all your help.

1604
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:21,507
Yeah, likewise.

1605
01:51:21,716 --> 01:51:24,051
Keep me posted
on what you decide to do.

1606
01:51:24,302 --> 01:51:28,222
- Maybe I'll run for Congress.
- There's gonna be a seat open now.

1607
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:40,359
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Yeah. Stay in touch.

1608
01:51:53,289 --> 01:51:54,873
You shouldn't have
done this without me.

1609
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:57,376
It won't happen again.

1610
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,094
