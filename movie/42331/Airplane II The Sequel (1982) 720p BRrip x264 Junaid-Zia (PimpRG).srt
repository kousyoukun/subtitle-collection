1
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:14,053
Watch your step.

2
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,307
All Pulsar Four mining personnel

3
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:22,603
report to the resource expedition
office, level seven.

4
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:57,930
Not on a four-hour layover.

5
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:09,317
Operator. Can I help you?

6
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,653
Phone home. Phone home.

7
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:17,241
Please deposit $6 million
for the first 3 minutes.

8
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,286
All lunar passengers,

9
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:23,623
please check with Passenger
Processing, level three.

10
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:25,041
That's us.

11
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:27,085
Can Scraps sit with us, Dad?

12
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:30,254
We'll check, Jimmy.
The moon's a long way.

13
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:33,091
- Can I help you folks?
- Thanks.

14
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,343
Is that your puppy, son?

15
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:38,304
Yeah. Scraps is going
to the moon with us.

16
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:40,807
No dogs are allowed
on the shuttle.

17
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,518
I'm afraid Scraps
will have to be shot.

18
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:49,857
He shot him! He shot Scraps!

19
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:51,317
Just joking!

20
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,195
Blanks. See? Scraps is fine.

21
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:00,451
I says, "Whenever
you're in town, call me."

22
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:04,205
Dinner in first class will be
bean sprouts and broccoli.

23
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:05,665
Fine.

24
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:08,334
- Chanting or non-chanting?
- Chanting, please.

25
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:13,464
Don't worry about
the Viatex account.

26
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,967
We have a buy-or-sell option.

27
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,762
- Watch their legal people, Bob.
- Will do.

28
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:22,390
And Bob... feed the cats.

29
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:23,933
Will do.

30
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,358
I'm sorry, ma'am,

31
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,569
you're only allowed one carry-on.

32
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:36,571
All right.

33
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:41,451
Bye-bye. Thank you.

34
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:50,793
For the best computer
officer on the lunar mission.

35
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:55,131
Simon, you shouldn't have!
I guess I'm a pretty lucky woman.

36
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:57,759
Women and the space program
have come far,

37
00:04:57,842 --> 00:05:01,471
but after the wedding, no more
complicated computers for my girl.

38
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:05,266
They've offered me a chance
to head the computer division.

39
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,395
You'll head up the baby division
for Mr and Mrs Simon Kurtz.

40
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,522
That's an order, Lieutenant.

41
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:16,069
Where's the passenger processing
lounge for the lunar shuttle?

42
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:18,279
Concourse lounge "C", fourth level.

43
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:19,572
- Thanks.
- Next.

44
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,741
How long is my parking valid?

45
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,701
- Two hours.
- Thank you.

46
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:26,871
- What's the fastest animal on earth?
- The cheetah. Next?

47
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:29,749
- Should I fake my orgasms?
- Yes.

48
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:31,209
Thank you.

49
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:48,351
This is mission control.

50
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:52,188
We have clearance on two-niner
for shuttle pre-launch checks.

51
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:56,275
You are clear to descend to 15,000
and hold until further notice.

52
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,694
A high-pressure front's
moving over Denver.

53
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:01,406
56 in the valley,
72 at the beaches.

54
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:04,075
The Supremes hit
the top of the charts

55
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:06,452
with this really
big one, Baby Love.

56
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:09,831
I have a collect call
for Michael Reese from his mother.

57
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:13,751
This is only
part of our mission control.

58
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:17,755
Right here we have re-entry
for all Earth-orbit ships.

59
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,593
That's handled by the computers
and simulated by these video units.

60
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:24,470
Now if you'll step this way...

61
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:29,100
Phoenix 6, you're programmed
on R two-niner and computer locked.

62
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:33,271
Computer lock acknowledged.
Over and out.

63
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:38,401
Well, gentlemen,
looks like it's out of our hands now.

64
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:41,529
- Janet, they need you in control.
- Right.

65
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:08,931
Shit!

66
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,613
Commissioner, we both know
that shuttle needs

67
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:25,615
another month of pre-launch testing.

68
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:27,825
Forget it, Bud.

69
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,036
- But Commissioner...
- I said forget it.

70
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:33,748
Mayflower is the first lunar shuttle
flying from a commercial terminal,

71
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:36,751
and the boys on the board
want her on schedule!

72
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:39,212
What do they know about safety?

73
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:42,423
The boys on the board
are under heavy pressure

74
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:44,550
from the boys downtown.

75
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,319
I'll be the one they crucify
if that shuttle screws up.

76
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:12,620
Not so fast. Frisk her!

77
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:15,790
These navigational charts seem OK.

78
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:18,292
I don't think
there'll be any problem.

79
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:20,253
Hey, why the long face?

80
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:22,296
I'm still worried
about the shuttle.

81
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,675
You saw Ted's report,
and he is the program's top pilot.

82
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:30,054
Was the program's top test pilot
until his mental breakdown.

83
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:34,559
Sweetheart, the opinion of a madman
doesn't impress me or anyone else.

84
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:36,477
The trial proved that.

85
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:38,730
Ted Striker's part of your past.

86
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,787
It's for your own good.

87
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,837
Please, may I have this bedpan?
I need it. I'll bring it right back.

88
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,214
Please, Mr Goldberg!

89
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,592
The company's doing pretty well.

90
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:12,055
The figures for the last quarter
show a 40% increase.

91
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:14,849
Visiting hours are over.

92
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:18,895
Doctor, will my brother be able
to come home to the farm soon?

93
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:22,982
It's hard to say.
He still thinks he's an accountant.

94
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:26,402
You must believe me...
invest in money markets!

95
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,581
And how are we this evening, Ted?

96
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:41,793
All right, I guess.

97
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:45,213
You can take off now.
We'll finish up tomorrow.

98
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:49,258
I thought you might like a paper.

99
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:51,094
Thanks.

100
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:55,515
- My God!
- What's wrong?

101
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:58,768
They're launching the XR-2300!
Know what that is?

102
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:01,145
The muffler bracket
for a '79 Pinto?

103
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:05,441
No. That's the XR-2200.
The 2300 is the lunar shuttle.

104
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,403
It's got to be stopped!
Don't you understand?

105
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:11,948
They put me here
to keep me out of the way.

106
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:15,743
The first step to mental hygiene
is admitting you're sick.

107
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:22,500
Now listen, Ted.
Our only concern is your condition.

108
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,545
Your alpha scan reading
seems to be leveling off.

109
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:27,505
Is that a good sign?

110
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:29,924
It does the job.

111
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:34,303
I can't stand it!
I refuse to pay $2,000 a day

112
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:37,598
for a hospital bed, rotten food,
horrible nurses, rotten doctors!

113
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:41,310
What's his problem?
The man's obviously crazy.

114
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:44,480
By the way,
I spoke to Elaine this morning.

115
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:47,900
Elaine? Was she here?

116
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:52,238
No. She called and asked me to
tell you that she's marrying Simon.

117
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:55,825
Tell me the whole story
from the beginning.

118
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:58,119
After all, that's why I'm here.

119
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,621
There's really nothing to tell.

120
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:04,751
My story is no different
than anyone else's story.

121
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,503
I'm sure you've heard it
a thousand times.

122
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,464
It all started during the war.

123
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:12,383
I lost most of my squadron
over Macho Grande.

124
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,094
Planes, too.

125
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:19,348
You're too low...

126
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:25,063
After the war, I couldn't go near
anything with a pair of wings.

127
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:31,152
Until fate dropped me in the seat
of a 767 into Chicago with no crew.

128
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:36,365
It's funny how fate can
make heroes out of cowards.

129
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,578
After that came the job offers,
then the publicity...

130
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,665
...then the crash and the trial.

131
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:46,125
Order! Order!

132
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,044
Now this.

133
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:53,049
Well, there's more, but I'm sure
you'd all be bored by it.

134
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:56,886
No, no, no. Continue.

135
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:08,773
This is mission control,

136
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:13,027
in "T" minus one hour, 43 minutes
ground crew report to stations.

137
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:34,048
This is Mayflower 1,
get me the sarge!

138
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:38,261
Hey, Sarge! Hold up!

139
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,348
Here it is.

140
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,767
Give me that radio.

141
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,519
Kruger, this is the sarge.

142
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:50,815
There's no way this wire passed
inspection without Simon Kurtz' OK.

143
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,775
What the hell's going on?

144
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:56,112
Patch up the damage.
Get that ship ready to fly.

145
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:58,823
- That's an order, mister!
- You got it, mister,

146
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:03,578
but you tell your boys on the board
that this thing stinks of kickback.

147
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:07,415
You heard it, boys.
What do you say?

148
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:08,916
Screw him!

149
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,545
Ted Striker was right
when he test-piloted that sucker,

150
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:16,632
and what did he get
for telling the truth?

151
00:13:16,716 --> 00:13:19,010
A one-way ticket to the funny farm!

152
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:23,556
We don't have much time. Let's move.

153
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:10,895
Thank you.

154
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:21,155
May I help you?

155
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:26,702
Yes. I'd like this Time and Newsweek
and a Lifesaver and...

156
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:30,289
the second time bomb
on the right, please.

157
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:31,999
Certainly.

158
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:37,839
- There.
- Thank you.

159
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:40,967
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- No.

160
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:10,621
Hi, Grandma Rudy!

161
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,544
How good to see you!

162
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:23,092
Just a few more hours to lift-off.

163
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:24,594
I'm very excited, Simon.

164
00:15:24,677 --> 00:15:28,598
- Guess this is a first for you.
- No. I've been excited before.

165
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:32,143
Ted, what are you doing here?

166
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:35,104
- Are you on that shuttle?
- Both of us.

167
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:37,273
When we return,
we're getting married.

168
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:39,442
Elaine, it has to be stopped.

169
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,944
Ted, the invitations
have already gone out.

170
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:44,197
No, the flight must be stopped.

171
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,406
Come on, sweetheart.

172
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:51,454
Simon, give me a moment
with Ted alone.

173
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:55,375
All right. You've got
exactly 10 minutes till we board.

174
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,086
I'd watch my step if I were you.

175
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:02,507
Ted, this whole thing's
all in your mind.

176
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:08,388
You should have never
left the hospital.

177
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:10,181
Elaine, whatever happened to us?

178
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:13,893
Ted, I guess I'll always love you,
but I need Simon.

179
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:18,523
He's stable and a good provider,
and I need that.

180
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:20,900
He doesn't run away
from every challenge.

181
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:24,404
He doesn't let every little setback
eat him up inside.

182
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:26,239
Now goodbye, Ted.

183
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:39,877
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet your captain... Captain Oveur.

184
00:16:39,961 --> 00:16:41,462
Gentlemen, welcome aboard.

185
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:44,757
Your navigator, Mr Unger
and first officer, Mr Dunn.

186
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,300
- Unger.
- Oveur.

187
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:47,969
- Oveur.
- Dunn.

188
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:49,679
Gentlemen, let's get to work.

189
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:54,016
Unger, didn't you serve under Oveur
in the air force?

190
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,146
Not directly. Technically, Dunn was
under Oveur, and I was under Dunn.

191
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:01,190
So, Dunn, you were...
under Oveur and over Unger.

192
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:05,862
That's right. Dunn was over Unger,
and I was over Dunn.

193
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:10,450
See? Dunn and I were under Oveur,
even though I was under Dunn.

194
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:14,037
Dunn was over Unger,
and I was over Dunn.

195
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:17,498
Do you have any tickets
for the shuttle?

196
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:20,835
There haven't been any available
seats for weeks now, sir.

197
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:23,880
What you want?
I got pairs and singles!

198
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:27,842
Check 'em out, y'all!
400-dollar lunar shuttle tickets.

199
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:31,179
Smokin'... what you want?
Lunar shuttle tickets - $400.

200
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:34,766
I got smokin', non-smokin',
first class, coach, economy,

201
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:37,060
by the aisle, by the window.

202
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:40,313
Take it easy, my man.
Lunar shuttle tickets!

203
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:42,231
Hi. Thank you.

204
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:46,861
Three of you to the left.

205
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:50,198
- Hi. Can I take your case?
- No.

206
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:52,575
- Howdy, girl.
- Hello.

207
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:54,369
Keep that thing moving.

208
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:57,121
- How's it going?
- Everything's fine, Sarge.

209
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,712
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!
Ted Striker.

210
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:09,884
Jack, I got a bad feeling in my gut
about this mission.

211
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:16,182
Number two checks.

212
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:23,898
What's happenin', bro?

213
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:25,900
Atmosphere control OK.

214
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:27,360
Atmosphere control... check.

215
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:30,196
- Antigravity check.
- All right.

216
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:34,575
- Checks out in positive mode, sir.
- Check.

217
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:37,620
- Checks out in negative mode, sir.
- Check.

218
00:18:37,704 --> 00:18:39,831
Neutral balance seems all right, sir.

219
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:42,917
- Good. That should do it.
- Antigravity off, sir.

220
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:46,379
Hope this weather
doesn't give us a problem.

221
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,673
Mr Dunn,
what's your temperature reading?

222
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:52,343
98.6, sir.

223
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:53,845
That sounds normal.

224
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:06,649
Sweetheart, you should have gone
before we got on the plane.

225
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:10,361
Sir, you're in the wrong seat.
That's mine.

226
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:15,533
Elaine, wait. Listen to me.

227
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:18,870
Why can't you
just let me live my life?

228
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:22,582
It's not just your life.
It's everyone on board this ship!

229
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:24,500
We must stop this flight.

230
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:28,296
Ted, we're taking off.

231
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:30,339
Why don't you trust me any more?

232
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:34,844
You're not the man you were.
You shouldn't have left the hospital.

233
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:36,804
Please, take your seat.

234
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:46,856
Well, it looks like
that weather's starting to clear.

235
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:49,609
Satellite photos look clear
over Wyoming and Connecticut.

236
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:53,154
- We just heard from Detroit.
- What about Reno and Buffalo?

237
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:55,531
Clear,
but check the New Jersey suburbs.

238
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:59,786
Mayflower 1, you're clear on
two-niner to taxi to launch position.

239
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:03,247
Roger. Ready to taxi. Over.

240
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,211
"T" minus 30 seconds and counting...

241
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:14,967
Mark "T" minus 20 seconds.

242
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:34,695
Ignition.

243
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:39,158
"T" minus 9...

244
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:41,703
8... 7...

245
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,996
6... 5...

246
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,457
4... 3...

247
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,710
2... 1...

248
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:00,304
You have lift-off, Mayflower 1!
Acknowledge.

249
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:07,979
Roger, Control. This is Mayflower 1 -
acknowledge lift-off.

250
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:28,624
We'll be serving breakfast
in a few minutes.

251
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,544
- Will all of you be eating?
- Yes, thanks.

252
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:36,007
Jimmy, when you're finished, you can
come up front and see the cockpit.

253
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,551
Gee, that'll be neat.

254
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:41,471
I'm glad they let
Scraps ride with us.

255
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:43,264
Scraps will love the moon.

256
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:46,100
Will things be much different
on the moon?

257
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:50,104
It'll be terrific - a whole
new world, new kids to play with...

258
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:52,815
So no more headlines
about the rape trial?

259
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,902
How many kids get a chance
to live on another planet?

260
00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:59,363
No kids yelling, "Your old man's
a psychopathic sex pervert"?

261
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:03,201
So I made a mistake.
Anyway, she was asking for it.

262
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:05,870
They're all asking for it
all the time!

263
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:10,124
Dad never slaps me around
at home. It must be his coffee.

264
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:14,087
No. I've been serving Dad decaf.

265
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,131
Maybe he's just an asshole.

266
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:23,221
You know, dear? This reminds me of
the first train trip we ever took -

267
00:22:23,304 --> 00:22:25,390
out to your mother's
house, remember?

268
00:22:25,473 --> 00:22:27,183
How could I forget?

269
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:30,395
You were so nervous
about meeting my mama.

270
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:33,147
And I declare,
you were pacing the aisle

271
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:37,193
all the way from St Louis
to Sioux Falls.

272
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:40,405
And remember
when we hopped in the family car

273
00:22:40,488 --> 00:22:42,907
and drove all the way to Woodstock?

274
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,450
That was a time.

275
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:49,205
And you got that bad acid
and didn't come down for two weeks.

276
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:52,458
You kept telling everyone
that you were Jesus Christ,

277
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:57,130
and then you jumped off a roof
'cause you thought you could fly.

278
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:59,173
- What a bummer.
- No shit.

279
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:57,440
You look a little green.
Are you all right, young man?

280
00:23:57,523 --> 00:24:01,444
You know, some people get airsick,
but I never do.

281
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:04,906
I must have an iron constitution.

282
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:07,033
- I'm all right.
- Good.

283
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:11,954
I guess what's really bothering me
is my whole life.

284
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:16,125
I really can't figure
where Elaine and I went wrong.

285
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:20,505
You know what it's like
when two people share the same space.

286
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:25,134
Something happens.
Your vibes go out of synch.

287
00:24:29,263 --> 00:24:32,892
I thought we shared
a very special kind of love.

288
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:36,687
I'm not sure
I know what love is any more.

289
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:41,234
I guess it all started at the trial.

290
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:45,571
They had to cover up for the crash,
so they made me the scapegoat.

291
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:48,032
I had no one to turn to.

292
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:50,952
I'm sure you've had
the same experience yourself.

293
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:54,580
I couldn't believe
what was happening to me.

294
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:58,876
I think it's important
we establish a few facts

295
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,838
so these people can make
a fair decision.

296
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:07,593
First, were you not the chief test
pilot for the lunar shuttle XR-2300?

297
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:09,095
Yes.

298
00:25:09,178 --> 00:25:13,307
On the fifth of October this year,
that shuttle crash-landed.

299
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:16,394
Were you not the pilot
on that flight?

300
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:18,229
Yes, but I wasn't...

301
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:21,315
And, Mr Striker, is it not true

302
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:26,529
that that crash was a direct result
of your incompetence?

303
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:29,949
No! The problem was with that ship,
not with me.

304
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:33,411
The wiring was shorting out
under high temperatures.

305
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:35,747
That thing was a flying deathtrap.

306
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:42,253
The fact is, gentlemen, nothing
serious was wrong with that ship.

307
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:44,630
Ted Striker folded up
on the approach.

308
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:46,132
That's a lie!

309
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:49,177
Order! Order!

310
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,932
On March 5, 1980, flight 209 into
Chicago lost its crew in midair.

311
00:25:55,016 --> 00:26:00,229
And on that fateful night,
Ted Striker saved that plane.

312
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:04,150
I'd like to call one of the
passengers from that flight,

313
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,902
if it pleases the court.

314
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:09,947
Do you swear on the Constitution

315
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:12,700
to tell the whole truth,
and nothing but?

316
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:14,827
I do.

317
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:27,048
Would you describe, in your own
words, what happened that night?

318
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:31,135
Mr. Striker performed exceptionally

319
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:33,805
The passengers were very concerned

320
00:26:34,263 --> 00:26:36,140
The pilots were incapacitated

321
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:39,268
So Mr. Striker took control

322
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:42,063
And landed that plane safely

323
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:44,190
Golly!

324
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:48,861
I know I wouldn't be alive today
if it wasn't for Mr Striker.

325
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:55,618
I find it difficult even now to think
about that night over Chicago.

326
00:26:55,702 --> 00:26:59,330
Please try, Mrs Hammen.
It's very important.

327
00:27:00,123 --> 00:27:01,666
Well...

328
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,419
we lost the crew...

329
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:07,213
and...

330
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:10,925
the food poisoning
made us all very ill.

331
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:14,011
I lost control. We all did.

332
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:17,765
And then... the bad weather...

333
00:27:19,142 --> 00:27:20,852
And the lightning...

334
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:23,312
I've got to get out of here!

335
00:27:23,396 --> 00:27:25,690
Calm down! Get a hold of yourself!

336
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,734
Stewardess, please,
let me handle this.

337
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:30,445
I've got to get out!

338
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:33,197
Calm down. Now get back to your seat.

339
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:35,783
Calm down! Get a hold of yourself!

340
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:40,913
Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.
Everything's going to be all right.

341
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:42,498
Now just calm down.

342
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:44,876
I've got to get out of here!

343
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:47,587
This is very important!

344
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:51,132
Let the court handle this!

345
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:56,929
Will you please control yourself?

346
00:27:57,013 --> 00:27:58,431
Bailiff, Valium.

347
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:01,142
I flew with Striker during the war.

348
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:04,270
I'll never forget the night
we bombed Macho Grande.

349
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:05,938
Striker was a squadron leader.

350
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:09,192
He brought us in low,
but he couldn't handle it.

351
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:12,445
Buddy couldn't handle it.
Was Buddy in your crew?

352
00:28:12,528 --> 00:28:15,823
Buddy was the bombardier,
but Striker couldn't handle it.

353
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:19,243
- And he went to pieces.
- Andy went to pieces?

354
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:22,205
Andy was the navigator.
Buddy went to pieces.

355
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:26,501
- It was awful, how he came unglued.
- Howie came unglued?

356
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:30,880
No, Howie was the best tail gunner
in the outfit. Buddy came unglued.

357
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:34,842
- And he bailed out?
- No! Andy hung tough. Buddy bailed.

358
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,804
How we survived was a miracle.

359
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,931
Then Howie survived.

360
00:28:40,014 --> 00:28:43,017
No. Afraid not.
We lost Howie the next day.

361
00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:46,229
Over Macho Grande?

362
00:28:46,312 --> 00:28:49,774
No. I don't think
I'll ever get over Macho Grande.

363
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:53,027
Those wounds run... pretty deep.

364
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:57,323
Ted and I were very close once.

365
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:59,409
We had the kind of relationship

366
00:28:59,492 --> 00:29:03,079
where we laughed and laughed
and laughed all the time.

367
00:29:03,162 --> 00:29:05,498
Do you know what that's like?

368
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:07,750
Yes. Yes, I do.

369
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:12,004
Then things started to come apart.
He was obsessed with that shuttle.

370
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:16,801
He started to talk about it
all the time, even at night in bed,

371
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:20,263
and I guess that's when
the real problems started.

372
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:22,473
Please elaborate.

373
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:24,934
Well...

374
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:26,811
at first...

375
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:30,606
sex between us
was a wonderful experience -

376
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:34,277
the way he touched me...

377
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:36,988
He was so gentle.

378
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:39,907
He'd unbutton my blouse...

379
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:42,201
and then...

380
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:44,370
and then...

381
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:50,418
We drifted apart.
I'm sorry. I can't go on.

382
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,713
At the request of this court,

383
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:57,258
Mr Striker has undergone
a psychiatric examination.

384
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:00,636
The court calls Dr Franklin Stone.

385
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,264
Can you give your impression
of Mr Striker?

386
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:06,392
I don't do impressions.
My training is in psychiatry.

387
00:30:06,476 --> 00:30:07,643
Of course.

388
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:12,023
In your opinion, Doctor, was Ted
Striker competent to fly the shuttle?

389
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:14,942
The defendant suffers
from chronic psychological stress

390
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:17,987
and in a pressure situation
can snap like that.

391
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:20,114
- Like that?
- That's it.

392
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:24,911
He's a danger to himself and others,
and needs treatment.

393
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:27,080
Mr Striker.

394
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,127
This court recommends that
you be confined to an institution

395
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:38,424
for treatment until such time as you
are deemed fit to re-enter society.

396
00:30:38,508 --> 00:30:40,134
But I was framed!

397
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:43,638
I'm not guilty!
That ship did have faulty wiring!

398
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:46,099
Would you hold for a picture?

399
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:49,268
I'm not guilty!

400
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,690
A photo for the Daily News?

401
00:30:54,774 --> 00:30:56,109
Of course.

402
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:58,111
Thanks, counselor.

403
00:30:58,194 --> 00:30:59,737
Picture.

404
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:03,157
It's for Ted's own good, Elaine.

405
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:06,285
I thought I was right
and they were wrong.

406
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,746
Now I'm not sure
of anything any more.

407
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,959
There's more to the story, but
you probably heard enough already.

408
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:15,378
I don't want to go on forever...

409
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:43,448
Captain, I'm picking up
an overheat in the computer core.

410
00:31:43,531 --> 00:31:47,118
- How serious is it, Mr Dunn?
- I can't tell, sir.

411
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,537
You can tell me. I'm the captain.

412
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,124
I can't localize it, but
it's definitely in the computer core.

413
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:56,711
- Elaine, run a computer check.
- Yes, sir.

414
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:01,507
Voice interface.

415
00:32:01,591 --> 00:32:04,343
There's an overheat in the core.
Please analyze.

416
00:32:04,427 --> 00:32:06,971
There is no apparent overheat.

417
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:10,850
Yes, there is, Rok.
We read a core overheat.

418
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:12,226
Repeat analysis.

419
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,645
Analysis confirmed.

420
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:16,939
All systems compute positive.

421
00:32:18,107 --> 00:32:20,818
Well, not from where
I'm sitting, they don't.

422
00:32:20,902 --> 00:32:24,113
Look, Elaine,
cut the "not where I'm sitting" shit.

423
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:26,324
It must be a human error.

424
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:29,369
Captain, I think
we have a computer foul-up.

425
00:32:29,452 --> 00:32:32,580
- I see.
- What do you recommend, Captain?

426
00:32:32,663 --> 00:32:34,374
Run it through the computer.

427
00:32:34,457 --> 00:32:36,459
- I already have!
- Good.

428
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:40,213
Just to be safe
should I check the rear data banks?

429
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:44,550
- No. You check the rear data banks.
- Yes, sir.

430
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:56,187
Sir, you should put that case
in the compartment above your head.

431
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:01,025
- I'll keep it with me.
- I'll help if you can't get it up.

432
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:03,694
I said I'll keep it with me.

433
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:16,999
- Ted, please.
- Elaine, listen...

434
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:20,044
- We can't do this.
- We have to go back.

435
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,256
I understand. We had
something special, but it's over.

436
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:26,259
- We can't go back.
- This flight has to go back.

437
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:29,137
That wiring could blow any second.

438
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,098
The problem's in your mind,
like always.

439
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:36,018
- Then you do think I'm insane.
- I'd never use that word.

440
00:33:36,102 --> 00:33:39,981
- What word would you use?
- The word is sick, Ted.

441
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:41,482
Goodbye.

442
00:33:44,902 --> 00:33:47,113
Sir, that overheat
is getting worse.

443
00:33:47,196 --> 00:33:50,783
I'd better get back into the core
and check it out.

444
00:33:50,867 --> 00:33:53,661
- I'd rather you check it out.
- Right...

445
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:56,122
Sir, we're carrying
emergency fuel back there.

446
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:58,833
You'd better go, too.
I'll fly the ship.

447
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:02,086
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

448
00:34:04,005 --> 00:34:07,592
Captain, do you mind if Jimmy here
takes a look around?

449
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:12,513
Of course not, Mary.
Come on in, Jimmy. Hi there.

450
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:15,475
Boy, there's a lot
of neat stuff in here.

451
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:18,644
This is the nerve center
of the whole ship.

452
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:21,439
That's a cute puppy.
What's his name?

453
00:34:21,522 --> 00:34:22,815
Scraps.

454
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:25,485
- Can I hold him once?
- Yeah.

455
00:34:25,568 --> 00:34:31,115
Come on, Scraps. I used to have
a puppy like this when I was a kid.

456
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,243
- You like to play ball with him?
- Yeah.

457
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:36,996
You like to have him
fetch a stick?

458
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,206
Yeah.

459
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,749
Of course you do.

460
00:34:39,832 --> 00:34:42,919
Well, my goodness,
Scraps is a boy, isn't he?

461
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:44,337
Yeah.

462
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,091
Jimmy, do you like it
when Scraps holds onto your leg

463
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:50,510
and rubs up and down?

464
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:55,640
God help us. Look at this place.

465
00:34:55,723 --> 00:34:58,559
Check the fuel drums,
I'll do the computer.

466
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:24,752
Jimmy, did you ever wonder
why dogs sniff each other?

467
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,587
Well, Captain, everything A-OK?

468
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:29,132
Yes, everything's fine. Right, Jimmy?

469
00:35:29,215 --> 00:35:31,217
Yeah. Everything's real neat up here.

470
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,094
That's strange.

471
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,098
What's strange, Captain?

472
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:40,435
It's an asteroid field. But there's
nothing in this sector, unless...

473
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:43,438
- Unless what, Captain?
- Unless we're off course.

474
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:51,571
- Captain Oveur, Dunn here.
- Come in, Dunn. Over.

475
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:53,698
There's been a fire here, sir.

476
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:56,993
We're going to have to disconnect
the damaged systems.

477
00:35:57,076 --> 00:36:00,204
Mr Unger is attempting
a manual shutdown right now.

478
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:02,248
What are you doing, Dave?

479
00:36:02,957 --> 00:36:05,752
The computer has suffered
some bad damage.

480
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:08,463
This is highly irregular.

481
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:11,466
Right. Right.

482
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:15,261
I hope we can still control
Rok's higher brain function, sir.

483
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:18,556
Do what's necessary.
I'll go to manual on all systems.

484
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,932
Yes, sir, we will.

485
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:23,144
Jesus! Hang on!

486
00:36:23,227 --> 00:36:27,648
I'll try to override Rok's circuit
and shut the door from here!

487
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:29,734
Holy shit!

488
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,434
- Did you see that?
- Excuse me?

489
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:06,062
There's two crewmen out there. Look.

490
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:16,447
I'm afraid there's nothing out there
but empty space.

491
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:19,450
I swear I...

492
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:23,329
The defendant suffers
from chronic psychological stress

493
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:26,791
and in a pressure situation
can snap just like that.

494
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:33,005
Maybe they were right about me.

495
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:35,758
My God. Maybe I am cracking up.

496
00:37:44,434 --> 00:37:46,436
What's happening, Captain?

497
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:48,438
We're off course and computer-locked.

498
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:52,191
That fire in Rok's core played havoc
with the brain functions.

499
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:56,112
Mr Dunn and Mr Unger
were sucked out an air lock.

500
00:37:56,195 --> 00:37:57,530
Both together?

501
00:37:57,613 --> 00:38:01,951
Mr Dunn and Mr Unger
were sucked out an air lock.

502
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:05,538
Don't panic. Calm down, ladies.
Are there any other problems?

503
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:07,790
Captain, we've run out of coffee.

504
00:38:07,874 --> 00:38:11,210
Damn! I've told them
a hundred times - store extra coffee!

505
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:14,922
Captain, what should we do
if the passengers start to panic?

506
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:17,300
This is the way we'll play it -

507
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:20,678
Mary, you're here
in case there's a full-cabin press.

508
00:38:20,762 --> 00:38:24,307
Testa, cover Mary's weak side
in case she gets double-teamed.

509
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,808
Right!

510
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:28,811
Captain, I don't think
we have any alternatives.

511
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:32,023
I see. What do you think
our alternatives are?

512
00:38:32,106 --> 00:38:34,192
To disconnect Rok's
higher brain function

513
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:35,985
without disturbing
his regulatory system.

514
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:38,279
That computer
has a self-defense mechanism.

515
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:40,698
You heard what happened
to the others.

516
00:38:40,782 --> 00:38:43,743
I know. Sucked out.

517
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:48,998
Still, it's our only chance.
We could try it from here.

518
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:51,876
You get back and monitor
the regulatory unit.

519
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:55,296
- Right. Good luck, Captain.
- Don't worry about me.

520
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:02,929
Ladies and gentlemen,
please calm down.

521
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:05,431
Please, listen to me.

522
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:09,185
I want to tell you what's
going on with the ship.

523
00:39:11,813 --> 00:39:13,272
Thank you.

524
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:16,192
We've been thrown
off course just a tad.

525
00:39:16,275 --> 00:39:18,361
What's a tad?

526
00:39:18,444 --> 00:39:20,488
Miss, what exactly is a tad?

527
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:24,117
In space terms,
that's about half a million miles.

528
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,036
That's interesting.

529
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,083
The bumps you feel are asteroids
smashing into the hull of the ship.

530
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:35,169
Also, we're flying
without a navigational system

531
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:37,338
and can't seem to change course.

532
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:40,258
Miss, are you telling us
absolutely everything?

533
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:43,886
Not exactly.
We're also out of coffee.

534
00:39:58,276 --> 00:40:02,822
Listen to me! Your crew is in
complete control of the situation.

535
00:40:04,824 --> 00:40:07,702
Trust me.
There's nothing to worry about!

536
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:15,376
You're right. They're off course
and heading straight for the sun.

537
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,379
I've seen enough, Bob.

538
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,673
Get me Steve McCroskey, and fast.

539
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:23,426
McCroskey hasn't handled
a tower since the strike.

540
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:26,721
Since Reagan fired the controllers,
he's been completely senile.

541
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,598
Yeah, but what about McCroskey?

542
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:32,769
- Pretty much the same as Reagan.
- I don't care. Get him.

543
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:41,819
Father, I've led such a sinful life.

544
00:40:41,903 --> 00:40:46,157
I'm married with two kids, and there
were these girls at the company.

545
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,700
I got them pregnant,

546
00:40:47,784 --> 00:40:51,829
so I stole from the company
to pay for the abortions...

547
00:40:51,913 --> 00:40:53,790
God bless you.

548
00:40:53,873 --> 00:40:55,416
Thank you, Father.

549
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,170
I've always loved you, darling,
but I have to tell you

550
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:01,589
I was unfaithful to you, just once.

551
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,508
I understand, darling.

552
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:06,511
Remember Jill, my first secretary?
Forgive me.

553
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:10,098
That's all right.
I knew about it all the time.

554
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:12,975
I was unfaithful, too.

555
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:14,685
I understand, darling.

556
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:17,647
Remember Susan,
your last receptionist?

557
00:41:21,943 --> 00:41:24,195
I don't mean to sound forward.

558
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:27,448
I mean, I know I don't know you,
but...

559
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:30,827
I don't think
we're going to live through this,

560
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,997
and... I've... never...

561
00:41:35,081 --> 00:41:37,333
been with a man before.

562
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:41,879
I know this really
isn't the place.

563
00:41:41,963 --> 00:41:44,340
No, no. I understand.

564
00:41:45,174 --> 00:41:46,926
Who turned off the...

565
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,644
What are you doing, Captain?

566
00:41:59,188 --> 00:42:01,607
This is highly irregular.

567
00:42:18,082 --> 00:42:20,752
- Get me some coffee, miss.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:42:20,835 --> 00:42:23,838
And a quart of Geritol
and a ham on rye.

569
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:25,339
Welcome home, sir.

570
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:27,258
Here's the navigational charts, sir.

571
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,597
Get me radio contact
with that ship. Pronto.

572
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,309
Here's all the information
on the sun. That thing is hot!

573
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:38,728
Get Bud Kruger immediately.
And some ice.

574
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:39,937
Yes, sir.

575
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:41,439
Jacobs.

576
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,319
I want to know absolutely everything
that's happened up till now.

577
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:49,530
First the Earth cooled,
and then the dinosaurs came.

578
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:53,659
But they got too big,
so they died, and turned into oil.

579
00:42:53,743 --> 00:42:56,496
Then the Arabs came
and bought Mercedes Benzes.

580
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:59,123
Prince Charles started wearing
Lady Di's clothes.

581
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:03,336
I couldn't believe it! He took
her best summer dress, put it on...

582
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:05,963
Things sure haven't changed.

583
00:43:06,506 --> 00:43:08,883
Captain, I think we've got...

584
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:12,345
Captain Oveur, what's wrong?

585
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:15,348
What's wrong?
What are you trying to say?

586
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:18,309
One... One what? One word!

587
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:19,811
First word? First syllable?

588
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:23,606
Captain, I'm not very good at this.
10 words!

589
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:25,942
How to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying.

590
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:27,944
What am I saying? Throat.

591
00:43:28,027 --> 00:43:31,698
Throat. Sounds like choke.
Choke. You...

592
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:34,826
Oh, my God!
You were gassed by Rok?

593
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:37,453
I got it! I got it!

594
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:41,999
Simon, the Captain's
been gassed by Rok.

595
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:45,586
Simon, we're way off course.

596
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,005
You're right, Elaine.
We are off course.

597
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:51,050
- My God! The sun!
- What is it, Simon?

598
00:43:51,134 --> 00:43:54,929
The fiery ball in our solar system,
but that's not important now.

599
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:58,558
We're headed right for it.
We've got to leave this ship.

600
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:01,018
That's foolish.
We have to change course.

601
00:44:01,102 --> 00:44:04,522
We're computer-locked, and the manual
navigational system is down.

602
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:06,399
Ted was right all along.

603
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:09,902
What will I do?
My career will be ruined.

604
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:12,822
What about the careers
of everyone on this ship?

605
00:44:12,905 --> 00:44:15,116
The lawyers, the architects,
the dental hygienists?

606
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,411
Forget about them.
We have to think of ourselves.

607
00:44:18,494 --> 00:44:22,957
What happened to the man I thought
I loved? I'm going to get Ted.

608
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,959
Don't come apart on me now.

609
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:35,261
I don't mean to sound forward -
I mean, I know I don't know you,

610
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:39,057
but I don't think that we're going
to live through this.

611
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,685
And I've never been
with a man before.

612
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:46,189
I know that this
isn't the right place.

613
00:44:51,986 --> 00:44:55,823
Until we get through,
our hands are tied. We need plans.

614
00:44:55,907 --> 00:44:57,533
I'm busy right through Friday.

615
00:44:57,617 --> 00:45:00,328
- Stinson.
- But how about lunch Saturday?

616
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:02,663
Have you contacted the families
of those on board?

617
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:05,500
They're outside now, sir.
They're not too happy.

618
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:13,257
Try and calm them down.
For God's sake, be diplomatic.

619
00:45:13,341 --> 00:45:15,093
Give them the lead!

620
00:45:28,648 --> 00:45:30,108
Ted, listen to me.

621
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:33,403
We've lost the crew,
and Simon's turned to jelly.

622
00:45:36,114 --> 00:45:37,990
Ted, we need you.

623
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:41,452
Elaine, you were right about me.

624
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:46,249
I folded up over Macho Grande,
and I folded up on the test flight.

625
00:45:46,332 --> 00:45:48,960
I crack under pressure
just like they said.

626
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:53,131
You overcame your drinking problem.
I know you can overcome this.

627
00:45:56,092 --> 00:45:59,053
It's no use, Elaine.
I just can't do it.

628
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:01,389
Ted, you were right about this ship.

629
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:06,602
I don't know how to say this,
but maybe in this topsy-turvy world,

630
00:46:06,686 --> 00:46:10,857
they should take all the "sane"
people and lock them up

631
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,319
and let all the psychopaths
out of the asylums to run the world.

632
00:46:15,403 --> 00:46:18,239
No... on second thoughts,
that's a bad idea.

633
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:21,743
What I'm trying to say is that I was
wrong and I hope you forgive me,

634
00:46:21,826 --> 00:46:26,664
because we need you in that cockpit
now more than ever.

635
00:46:26,748 --> 00:46:29,042
There's some banged-up people
back there.

636
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:33,296
I'll need some fresh sheets, gauze,
and all the Vaseline you have.

637
00:46:33,379 --> 00:46:36,924
- Ted, please!
- Right now.

638
00:46:37,258 --> 00:46:40,428
- Are you the nurse?
- Yes. Take this.

639
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:43,973
The washroom's just down there
on the right.

640
00:46:44,057 --> 00:46:46,225
I don't mean to sound forward.

641
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:49,187
I mean, I know I don't know you,

642
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:53,399
but I don't think we're going
to live through this,

643
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:56,736
and I've never been
with a man before.

644
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:59,030
I know this isn't the right place...

645
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,074
Simon, I...

646
00:47:01,157 --> 00:47:04,202
This is mission control.
Do you read, Mayflower?

647
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:06,704
This is the Mayflower.
Come in, anyone.

648
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:10,041
Now we're making some headway.

649
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:12,335
We read you, Mayflower.
Identify yourself.

650
00:47:12,418 --> 00:47:17,340
Well, this is Elaine Dickenson.
I'm 5'8", 123 pounds,

651
00:47:17,423 --> 00:47:21,344
I have... brown hair, blue eyes.

652
00:47:21,427 --> 00:47:26,307
I enjoy surfing, backgammon
and men who aren't afraid to cry.

653
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:31,354
Would somebody tell me what a woman
is doing in charge of that ship?

654
00:47:31,437 --> 00:47:33,856
Maybe she's got her ship together.

655
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:43,700
But he smells so bad...

656
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:50,123
- Can I sit here, mister?
- Yeah, sure.

657
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,919
- Be careful with that.
- I will.

658
00:47:55,002 --> 00:47:58,172
- Can I ask a question?
- What is it?

659
00:47:58,256 --> 00:48:01,342
It's an interrogative statement
used to test knowledge.

660
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:03,803
But that's not important
right now, mister.

661
00:48:03,886 --> 00:48:07,265
Is my dog Scraps going to make it?

662
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:10,977
I'm scared, mister.
Somebody has to do something.

663
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,526
Scraps is going to be fine, son.
You'll both be just fine.

664
00:48:25,992 --> 00:48:30,663
Striker, you got to listen to me.
They forced me to cut corners.

665
00:48:30,747 --> 00:48:34,917
- Get out of my way!
- You gotta help me...

666
00:48:37,545 --> 00:48:41,674
- Elaine. You're all alone up here.
- Yes, I am.

667
00:48:41,758 --> 00:48:44,927
- What's going on?
- There's no time to explain.

668
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:48,848
- I was wrong about you.
- We all make mistakes.

669
00:48:48,931 --> 00:48:52,685
- I'll never make that mistake again.
- Forget about it.

670
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:56,230
We're not living in the past
or the present any more.

671
00:48:56,314 --> 00:48:58,232
This is the future.

672
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:03,404
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be OK.

673
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:05,531
I love you, Ted.

674
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:19,462
Here it is. Elaine Dickenson,
ship's computer officer.

675
00:49:19,545 --> 00:49:22,215
Jacobs, what have you got
on Elaine Dickenson?

676
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:26,386
I'm taller, a better dancer
and much more fun to be with.

677
00:49:28,596 --> 00:49:31,349
Ted, I have the feeling

678
00:49:31,432 --> 00:49:35,937
we've been through
this exact thing before.

679
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,856
Except this time
I know exactly what I'm doing.

680
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:44,278
You mean...?

681
00:49:44,362 --> 00:49:47,573
That's right. We're at the mercy
of that computer.

682
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,202
Then these things
are totally useless.

683
00:49:54,122 --> 00:49:56,958
Mayflower 1 calling mission control.
Do you read me?

684
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:01,421
A man. That's more like it. Identify
yourself and give me your position.

685
00:50:04,716 --> 00:50:07,719
The name's Striker.
I'm sitting down and facing front.

686
00:50:07,802 --> 00:50:11,597
- Why would you want to know that?
- Striker?

687
00:50:13,933 --> 00:50:15,560
Striker!

688
00:50:19,355 --> 00:50:21,733
- Ted Striker?
- That's right, McCroskey.

689
00:50:21,816 --> 00:50:25,945
I may be in the cockpit,
but there's not much I can do.

690
00:50:26,029 --> 00:50:28,322
We're at the mercy of the computer.

691
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,745
- McCroskey, do you read me?
- Striker?

692
00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:36,914
- McCroskey!
- You're fading out. Come in.

693
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:39,167
- Damn! Lost them again.
- Could be sunspots.

694
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,626
Or your detergent.

695
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:44,630
Striker flew that 767 into Chicago
years ago without a crew.

696
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:48,718
Now, would somebody tell me
what he's doing up there?

697
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:52,013
The radio's gone dead.
Elaine, try the emergency phone.

698
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:57,226
Help us, please.

699
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:00,313
Thank you for calling the mission
control emergency line.

700
00:51:00,396 --> 00:51:03,399
All our operators are busy,
so please stand by.

701
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:07,278
- Ted, it's a recording.
- Let me have that.

702
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:11,991
We said all our operators are busy,
so please stand by!

703
00:51:13,951 --> 00:51:17,288
The boys downtown
are taking heat from Washington.

704
00:51:17,372 --> 00:51:19,749
The president will want
an explanation.

705
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:23,252
Bud, let the boys in Washington
handle the president.

706
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:24,796
Sorry to pull you out of bed.

707
00:51:24,879 --> 00:51:27,173
- Forget it. I was reading.
- What's the story?

708
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:31,511
It's about an man who catches this
fish, but that's not important now.

709
00:51:31,594 --> 00:51:33,304
We've restored radio contract.

710
00:51:33,388 --> 00:51:36,224
Good. We keep losing their radio.

711
00:51:36,307 --> 00:51:39,936
McCroskey, give it to me straight.
What's it look like?

712
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:43,815
A radio? It's about so big,
green, lots of knobs.

713
00:51:43,898 --> 00:51:47,193
I mean the situation.
What do your people think?

714
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:51,030
They're screwed.

715
00:51:51,114 --> 00:51:53,032
They're dead.

716
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:56,411
Did I leave the iron on?

717
00:52:03,209 --> 00:52:07,004
- Come in, Control.
- We read you. Come in.

718
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:09,882
McCroskey,
I got to be straight with you.

719
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:13,136
I don't think I can regain
control of this ship.

720
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:16,514
Striker, this is Steve McCroskey,
chief controller.

721
00:52:16,597 --> 00:52:19,183
Now, I want you to listen good.

722
00:52:19,267 --> 00:52:24,022
A few years ago I helped a young
pilot through a storm over Chicago.

723
00:52:24,105 --> 00:52:26,357
He said he couldn't do it, too.

724
00:52:26,441 --> 00:52:30,737
But when the going got tough,
that kid pulled it together.

725
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:35,700
He made all the big papers
and the Canadian Jewish News.

726
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:38,828
I don't know if that kid's
still got it,

727
00:52:38,911 --> 00:52:41,748
but if he has, I know one thing...

728
00:52:41,831 --> 00:52:46,252
if he was there now, he'd find
a way to turn that bucket around

729
00:52:46,335 --> 00:52:48,337
and get out of there, pronto!

730
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:52,425
You gave the wrong speech.
I'm not your problem. It's the ship.

731
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:54,719
The fire made the computer
go berserk.

732
00:52:54,802 --> 00:52:57,972
We've lost the crew,
and we're en route to the sun.

733
00:52:58,056 --> 00:53:02,393
Now here's what you do. Stay calm,
keep an eye on those gauges.

734
00:53:02,477 --> 00:53:07,190
Things are going to heat up. We'll
figure out a way around the computer.

735
00:53:07,273 --> 00:53:09,484
What are we going to do?

736
00:53:11,027 --> 00:53:14,530
We're going to have to
blow the computer.

737
00:53:14,614 --> 00:53:15,823
Blow Rok?

738
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,748
- That's right.
- Ted, you can't do it.

739
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:25,208
What do you mean?

740
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:28,795
It has a self-defense mechanism.
I can't get around it.

741
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:32,673
We've already lost three men.
I don't want to lose you, too.

742
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,638
Then I guess it's
in God's hands now.

743
00:53:39,263 --> 00:53:42,058
I'm Father O'Flanagan.
I'm a man of God.

744
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:46,938
And you must trust me when I say
it's likely we're all going to die.

745
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:14,173
Our top story tonight,
fire rages through downtown Buffalo.

746
00:54:14,257 --> 00:54:18,970
Also in the news, lunar shuttle heads
for the sun and certain disaster.

747
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:23,683
Our top story tonight,
fire rages through downtown Tokyo.

748
00:54:23,766 --> 00:54:28,646
Also in the news, American lunar
mission locked in death struggle.

749
00:54:30,356 --> 00:54:36,696
A fire in downtown Moscow clears way
for a glorious new tractor factory.

750
00:54:36,779 --> 00:54:39,824
And on the lighter side of the news,

751
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:44,662
hundreds of capitalists are soon
to perish in shuttle disaster.

752
00:54:44,746 --> 00:54:49,834
If this country was run by vegetarian
women rather than flesh-eating men,

753
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:52,712
this whole space disaster
would never have happened.

754
00:54:52,795 --> 00:54:55,256
We're working
to raise the consciousness

755
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:58,634
of the vegetarian minorities
with diet sensitivity training

756
00:54:58,718 --> 00:55:01,012
so that people will be able
to deal...

757
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:05,725
The key is their computer.

758
00:55:05,808 --> 00:55:09,729
Until we put that ship on manual,
there's nothing we can do.

759
00:55:09,812 --> 00:55:13,566
- Get me that computer program.
- Yes, sir.

760
00:55:13,649 --> 00:55:15,860
- Who's in charge here?
- McCroskey, Control.

761
00:55:15,943 --> 00:55:18,279
- Hallick, Homicide.
- Jacobs, Sagittarius.

762
00:55:18,363 --> 00:55:21,574
We've got our own problems,
so make it good.

763
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:24,077
A passenger has a bomb
and is suicidal.

764
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,203
Good one.

765
00:55:25,286 --> 00:55:27,497
His name is Joe Salucci.

766
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,708
He was flying to Des Moines for
an operation for sexual impotence.

767
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:33,711
- The Des Moines Institute?
- You know it?

768
00:55:33,795 --> 00:55:35,296
We're familiar with it.

769
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:39,717
Joe gave his wife this insurance
policy then got on the shuttle.

770
00:55:39,801 --> 00:55:41,386
Mrs Salucci thinks he's suicidal.

771
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:45,014
We had the boys in psychiatry
do a profile on him.

772
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,312
- Yeah, that looks pretty bad.
- It's not his good side.

773
00:55:51,396 --> 00:55:57,610
Now, blowing up a plane in space
leaves no traces for investigators.

774
00:55:57,694 --> 00:56:00,154
This is a $1-million policy.

775
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:04,325
Wait a minute.

776
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:06,369
This is auto insurance!

777
00:56:06,452 --> 00:56:08,621
That's why we're worried, gentlemen.

778
00:56:08,705 --> 00:56:12,542
This clown's impotent,
suicidal and incredibly stupid.

779
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:15,545
And that spells trouble in my book.

780
00:56:17,171 --> 00:56:19,757
Trouble.

781
00:56:19,841 --> 00:56:22,760
Stinson,
get me those Mayflower plans.

782
00:56:22,844 --> 00:56:24,804
You, clear that table in there.

783
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:27,807
I'll get the cards
and the bridge bits.

784
00:56:30,476 --> 00:56:33,187
And somebody get me the sarge.

785
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:49,954
The heat in this cockpit
is getting unbearable.

786
00:56:50,038 --> 00:56:53,291
You can fry an egg
on this control panel.

787
00:56:57,837 --> 00:57:00,631
I don't know what'll to happen to us,

788
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:04,385
but I love you and I always will.

789
00:57:06,888 --> 00:57:10,099
That might be the news
we've been waiting for.

790
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:13,853
- This is Mayflower 1.
- Striker, I got news for you.

791
00:57:15,021 --> 00:57:17,565
You got a passenger aboard
named Joe Salucci.

792
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:20,193
- He's carrying a bomb.
- A bo...

793
00:57:20,276 --> 00:57:23,654
No, not a "bo," a bomb.
Do you hear me, Striker?

794
00:57:23,738 --> 00:57:26,491
What am I supposed to do now?

795
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:30,495
Get that bomb. I don't care how.
That's our top priority.

796
00:57:30,578 --> 00:57:33,039
All the other problems can just wait.

797
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:39,087
As if we don't have
enough problems already.

798
00:57:41,756 --> 00:57:44,509
You'd better fasten your seat belt.

799
00:57:44,592 --> 00:57:47,720
Sir, you'll have to put
your cigarette out.

800
00:57:55,737 --> 00:57:59,115
- Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
- 16-C. Why?

801
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:01,784
- He's carrying a bomb.
- A bo...!

802
00:58:01,868 --> 00:58:04,162
No, not a "bo," a bomb.

803
00:58:04,245 --> 00:58:08,124
Now, as discreetly as possible,
move the passengers into the lounge.

804
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:11,794
- We don't have a lounge.
- That's not important now.

805
00:58:11,878 --> 00:58:14,589
- Get everyone away from that bomb.
- What should I say?

806
00:58:14,672 --> 00:58:17,592
Anything. Just don't let Salucci
think we're on to him.

807
00:58:17,675 --> 00:58:19,135
I'll do my best.

808
00:58:29,187 --> 00:58:32,106
Attention,
ladies and gentlemen, please.

809
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:36,611
Would everybody move to the lounge
who is not carrying a bomb.

810
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:39,447
Don't move!

811
00:58:39,531 --> 00:58:42,075
Mr Salucci,
they know about you back home.

812
00:58:42,158 --> 00:58:43,493
Stay where you are!

813
00:58:43,576 --> 00:58:46,829
You don't want to kill
all these innocent people.

814
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:51,334
- I don't care about them.
- Joe, listen to me. It's hopeless.

815
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:55,797
No one's ever gotten away
with a stunt like this before.

816
00:58:58,925 --> 00:59:01,386
Joe, the insurance is worthless now.

817
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:03,429
I don't believe you.

818
00:59:03,513 --> 00:59:05,682
Joe, you got to trust me.

819
00:59:14,065 --> 00:59:15,692
No one will hurt you.

820
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:18,611
No one has to know
about your problem.

821
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:20,572
No one has to know you're impotent.

822
00:59:20,655 --> 00:59:23,157
Don't say that word!

823
00:59:36,462 --> 00:59:37,672
Scraps!

824
00:59:55,231 --> 00:59:56,900
Nice going, Striker!

825
00:59:56,983 --> 00:59:59,861
We're not out of the woods,
but you got rid of that bomb.

826
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:02,864
- Not exactly, McCroskey.
- What do you mean?

827
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:07,702
- The bomb's here beside me.
- There, beside you in the cockpit?

828
01:00:09,162 --> 01:00:10,496
Striker...

829
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,166
What the hell
are you doing up there?

830
01:00:13,249 --> 01:00:16,002
I got an idea that might just work.

831
01:00:16,085 --> 01:00:18,296
It's a long shot.

832
01:00:18,379 --> 01:00:21,674
I want to use the bomb
to blow the computer.

833
01:00:21,758 --> 01:00:25,762
Striker, you've got to be crazy
to try a stunt like that.

834
01:00:25,845 --> 01:00:29,265
Maybe, but it's
the only chance we've got.

835
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:32,602
When that bomb blows,
we'll lose our oxygen fast.

836
01:00:32,685 --> 01:00:36,648
I'll have to get us out
as quick as I can.

837
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:40,568
- I'm taking her to 0.5 worp.
- 0.5 worp?

838
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:42,737
0.5 worp.

839
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:46,616
I test-piloted this shuttle.
I know exactly what it can do.

840
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:49,536
Striker, listen to me now
and listen good.

841
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:55,083
That thing is bound to come apart
at that speed, and that's no good.

842
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:58,753
It's got to be
in one piece when you land.

843
01:00:58,836 --> 01:01:02,549
You know that that worp drive
has never been tested!

844
01:01:02,632 --> 01:01:07,095
You're putting yourself and everybody
else on that ship in jeopardy!

845
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:10,265
- Over here!
- Contestant 38.

846
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:12,934
I'll take air shuttle disasters
for 40.

847
01:01:13,017 --> 01:01:16,563
The answer is... the Mayflower.

848
01:01:16,646 --> 01:01:19,566
Ted, what are you going to do?

849
01:01:19,649 --> 01:01:22,569
Elaine, I'm going back there
with the bomb.

850
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:25,947
You're my hero.

851
01:01:28,575 --> 01:01:30,201
The bomb.

852
01:01:35,164 --> 01:01:41,004
Be careful.

853
01:01:41,087 --> 01:01:47,176
Listen good. If you got any ideas,
now is the time. I want to hear them.

854
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:51,514
How about Hollywood Squares but
with kids? Gary Coleman could host.

855
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,537
- Simon just ejected.
- Sit down, Elaine.

856
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,039
If this works, we might make it.

857
01:02:58,122 --> 01:03:01,876
- Simon was a fool to eject now.
- You mean...?

858
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,088
That's right. Premature ejection.

859
01:03:06,673 --> 01:03:08,550
Striker, listen and listen good.

860
01:03:08,633 --> 01:03:11,052
You'll be on lunar radio range
any second.

861
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:13,513
The next transmission
that you receive

862
01:03:13,596 --> 01:03:16,641
will be from Buck Murdock
at Alpha Beta Base.

863
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:21,396
- Not BUCK Murdock?
- No. Buck MURdock.

864
01:03:21,479 --> 01:03:23,314
Who's Buck Murdock, Ted?

865
01:03:23,398 --> 01:03:25,900
A guy I flew with during the war.

866
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:29,988
He was with us that day
I led the raid over Macho Grande.

867
01:03:30,071 --> 01:03:32,156
And he's still alive?

868
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:38,246
Striker, son...
we're all betting on you.

869
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:40,248
5-1 they all die.

870
01:03:40,331 --> 01:03:43,501
8-5 the women and children make it.

871
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:45,712
6-4 they lose the crew.

872
01:03:45,795 --> 01:03:47,505
0.5 worp... God help them.

873
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:50,133
Nobody's ever traveled
at that speed before.

874
01:03:50,216 --> 01:03:52,886
Last spring,
we did Europe in nine days.

875
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:55,889
Then we went
to Bakersfield and Fresno.

876
01:03:55,972 --> 01:03:58,224
No one goes to Fresno any more.

877
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:17,202
All communication lines are clear.

878
01:04:17,285 --> 01:04:21,372
Ready to transfer to Buck Murdock
at Alpha Beta. Over.

879
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,375
Gentlemen...

880
01:04:24,459 --> 01:04:28,755
I don't find it easy to talk
at a time like this,

881
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:32,634
but I got to say something
about that guy up there,

882
01:04:32,717 --> 01:04:36,846
and I can sum it all up
in just one word... courage,

883
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:39,891
dedication, daring, pride, pluck,
spirit, grit, mettle

884
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:45,021
and... G-U-T-S. Guts!

885
01:04:45,104 --> 01:04:47,982
Ted Striker's got more guts
in his little finger

886
01:04:48,066 --> 01:04:53,029
than most of us have in our large
intestine, including the colon!

887
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,660
When we're ready, we'd like you
to remove your eyeglasses and shoes

888
01:04:58,743 --> 01:05:01,704
and place your head
between the knees.

889
01:05:01,788 --> 01:05:04,123
Between your own knees, Father.

890
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:19,097
We've blown the computer.

891
01:05:21,975 --> 01:05:24,269
Elaine, you'd better
check the readout.

892
01:05:29,148 --> 01:05:31,109
We're slowing down.

893
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,907
- Set course change.
- Set.

894
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:39,450
Compute.

895
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,918
Here goes.

896
01:05:58,052 --> 01:06:02,432
Elaine, we hit 0.5 worp,
and everything seems OK.

897
01:06:06,978 --> 01:06:09,022
We've got gravity control back.

898
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:12,275
Sorry.

899
01:06:20,158 --> 01:06:24,454
Elaine, you'd better brace yourself.

900
01:06:24,537 --> 01:06:27,790
This is faster than man
has ever traveled before.

901
01:06:38,426 --> 01:06:40,637
In case some of you are wondering,

902
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,806
we are traveling
at half the speed of light.

903
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:47,101
Some of you might experience
a temporary metabolic change,

904
01:06:47,185 --> 01:06:50,063
but there's nothing to worry about.
Thank you.

905
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:25,932
- Commander Murdock.
- What is it, Lieutenant?

906
01:07:26,015 --> 01:07:29,686
The Mayflower's in trouble. She's
coming in hotter than a firecracker.

907
01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:32,897
Their computer's down. They've lost
their crew. They're on manual.

908
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:36,609
- We'd better get to the tower.
- We have no tower.

909
01:07:36,693 --> 01:07:39,863
- No tower?
- Just a bridge, sir.

910
01:07:39,946 --> 01:07:43,157
Why the hell aren't I notified
about these things?

911
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:46,661
Lieutenant...
How would you handle this?

912
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:49,831
- We could try ignoring it.
- I see.

913
01:07:49,914 --> 01:07:52,000
Pretend nothing has happened

914
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:54,127
and hope everything's all right
in the morning.

915
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,670
Just a thought, sir.

916
01:07:55,753 --> 01:07:59,173
I've considered that.
Must be a better angle...

917
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:08,183
If they've lost their crew,
who's in control of that bucket?

918
01:08:08,266 --> 01:08:10,685
Some guy by the name
of Ted Striker, sir.

919
01:08:10,768 --> 01:08:11,769
Ted Striker.

920
01:08:11,853 --> 01:08:14,689
- Do you know him?
- Never heard of him.

921
01:08:14,772 --> 01:08:17,692
That's not exactly true.
We were like brothers.

922
01:08:17,775 --> 01:08:20,153
We flew together during the war.

923
01:08:20,236 --> 01:08:23,656
We were close, real close, until...

924
01:08:24,115 --> 01:08:25,074
Until, sir?

925
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:27,202
Until that day over Macho Grande.

926
01:08:27,243 --> 01:08:28,661
Over Macho Grande, sir?

927
01:08:28,745 --> 01:08:30,997
I'll never get over Macho Grande.

928
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,667
Forget it, Lieutenant.
It wasn't a pretty picture.

929
01:08:38,796 --> 01:08:40,131
What have you found?

930
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:42,842
These red lights keep moving
back and forth.

931
01:08:42,926 --> 01:08:46,804
Aside from that, this thing seems
to have no function whatsoever.

932
01:08:46,888 --> 01:08:48,640
It must have some function.

933
01:08:48,723 --> 01:08:53,478
Why would the government put all
that money into a thing with lights?

934
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:56,147
Sir, these lights keep blinking
out of sequence.

935
01:08:56,231 --> 01:08:58,483
What should we do about it?

936
01:08:58,566 --> 01:09:00,777
Get them to blink in sequence.

937
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:04,697
- Rorshack, what do you got?
- What do you make of these?

938
01:09:04,781 --> 01:09:08,243
That's a bird.
That's a horse with a hat on.

939
01:09:08,326 --> 01:09:13,289
I pulled Striker's record. I don't
think you're going to like it.

940
01:09:13,373 --> 01:09:16,876
It's worse than I thought.

941
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,172
They'll hit our atmosphere in three
minutes. How do you want to play it?

942
01:09:21,256 --> 01:09:25,802
I want a 6-foot trench dug around
the base. Fill it with gasoline.

943
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:28,137
Get women and children
to the shelters.

944
01:09:28,221 --> 01:09:30,014
Contact the Japanese ambassador.

945
01:09:30,098 --> 01:09:32,141
Rorshack, get me a complete file

946
01:09:32,225 --> 01:09:36,354
on everyone who's seen the Sound
Of Music more than four times.

947
01:09:36,437 --> 01:09:38,648
On second thought, kill those orders.

948
01:09:38,731 --> 01:09:40,191
Down scope.

949
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:46,030
Fate can play a strange
game sometimes, Lieutenant.

950
01:09:46,114 --> 01:09:47,866
Fate, sir?

951
01:09:47,949 --> 01:09:51,661
Striker wipes out his entire squadron
over Macho Grande,

952
01:09:51,744 --> 01:09:56,457
and now those people's lives up there
are in his hands.

953
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:02,213
I guess irony can be
pretty ironic sometimes.

954
01:10:03,756 --> 01:10:05,633
But it's his ship now.

955
01:10:05,717 --> 01:10:09,095
He's the top dog,

956
01:10:09,178 --> 01:10:11,472
the big man,

957
01:10:11,556 --> 01:10:15,393
numero uno honcho,

958
01:10:15,476 --> 01:10:18,104
the head cheese.

959
01:10:26,738 --> 01:10:30,325
I just hope he has
the right stuff. Up scope.

960
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:32,202
We have radio contact.

961
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,667
Yes, I'll take care of it right away.

962
01:10:39,751 --> 01:10:42,128
We've had some problems
with the ship.

963
01:10:42,212 --> 01:10:46,090
If you're going to use the washroom,
please be careful.

964
01:10:46,174 --> 01:10:49,135
I've been on my feet all day.

965
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:52,180
I sure could use a little breather.

966
01:10:58,228 --> 01:11:01,523
Striker, this is Buck Murdock.
Do you read me?

967
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:03,024
I read you, Murdock.

968
01:11:03,107 --> 01:11:07,237
Hope he's not still bitter
about what happened between us.

969
01:11:07,403 --> 01:11:10,615
If not for those people,
I'd say let Striker go down

970
01:11:10,698 --> 01:11:13,785
in a fiery mass of molten metal.

971
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:18,456
Striker, let's just pray
you don't screw up here

972
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:22,252
like you did over Macho Grande,
so just follow orders.

973
01:11:22,335 --> 01:11:26,047
We've got you locked on beam.
Prepare to kill auxiliary engines.

974
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:27,465
Roger, Murdock.

975
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:31,719
All right, Striker,
kill the auxiliary engines.

976
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:35,640
Ted, the lever!

977
01:11:35,723 --> 01:11:39,060
The lever just came off.
We're still at worp.

978
01:11:39,143 --> 01:11:41,437
Try another lever.

979
01:11:41,521 --> 01:11:43,565
There are no more levers,
just switches.

980
01:11:43,648 --> 01:11:47,443
- No buttons?
- Just switches, lights and knobs.

981
01:11:47,527 --> 01:11:49,821
Cut the bleeding-heart crap.

982
01:11:49,904 --> 01:11:53,950
We've all got our switches, lights,
and knobs to deal with, Striker.

983
01:11:54,033 --> 01:11:56,953
Down here,
there are hundreds and thousands

984
01:11:57,036 --> 01:11:59,414
of blinking, beeping,
and flashing lights.

985
01:11:59,497 --> 01:12:01,624
Blinking and beeping
and flashing.

986
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:03,626
They're flashing
and they're beeping.

987
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:07,088
I can't stand it any more!
They're blinking and beeping...

988
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:09,090
Sir! Sir, control yourself!

989
01:12:09,173 --> 01:12:12,135
- Pull yourself together, sir!
- I'm all right.

990
01:12:12,218 --> 01:12:13,636
All right, Striker.

991
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:18,183
You'll have to pull that
lever panel off. Do you understand?

992
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:19,559
Just rip it off.

993
01:12:20,685 --> 01:12:22,478
Elaine, screwdriver.

994
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:45,084
OK, the panel's off.

995
01:12:45,168 --> 01:12:47,962
Find a piece of metal
and shove it in.

996
01:12:48,087 --> 01:12:50,215
A piece of metal?

997
01:12:50,298 --> 01:12:52,634
Any piece of metal will do.

998
01:12:52,717 --> 01:12:55,637
I'd give anything
to get some metal up there.

999
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:59,599
Here we are surrounded by metal,
and it's useless.

1000
01:12:59,682 --> 01:13:01,935
Might as well write them off.

1001
01:13:02,018 --> 01:13:03,937
Let's close up the bridge.

1002
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,396
Let's get outta here.

1003
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,024
Close it up. Lights out.

1004
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:13,613
Where am I going to find
a piece of metal here?

1005
01:13:13,696 --> 01:13:17,242
In space? At this hour?

1006
01:13:38,763 --> 01:13:40,932
Will this work, Ted?

1007
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,436
Thanks.

1008
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:52,193
Hold it, Murdock.
I've got something that might work.

1009
01:13:52,277 --> 01:13:54,737
- Wait.
- A bobby pin.

1010
01:13:56,322 --> 01:14:00,243
What the hell's a man doing
with a bobby pin?

1011
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,289
Lights on.

1012
01:14:06,165 --> 01:14:11,838
All right, Striker, if a bobby pin's
all you got, it'll have to do.

1013
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:15,049
Shove it in there
and short that thing out.

1014
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,018
Ted, it's working.

1015
01:14:25,101 --> 01:14:27,145
We're losing speed.

1016
01:14:27,228 --> 01:14:29,647
She feels like
she's going to break up.

1017
01:14:31,649 --> 01:14:34,986
- She's starting to shake.
- Starting to shake.

1018
01:14:38,781 --> 01:14:42,118
- She's starting to shimmy.
- Starting to shimmy.

1019
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:46,289
She's starting to...

1020
01:14:51,085 --> 01:14:55,381
What? What's she starting to do?
What's she starting to do?

1021
01:14:55,465 --> 01:14:58,885
- Shudder, Ted?
- She's starting to shudder.

1022
01:14:58,968 --> 01:15:00,220
Starting to shudder.

1023
01:15:00,303 --> 01:15:03,806
- How bad is it?
- At least she's not cracking up.

1024
01:15:06,476 --> 01:15:07,936
She's beginning to crack up.

1025
01:15:18,613 --> 01:15:21,908
All right! Quiet!

1026
01:15:21,991 --> 01:15:26,579
We're monitoring you.
Keep her nose up. Don't fight her.

1027
01:15:26,663 --> 01:15:28,665
She's fighting me!

1028
01:15:32,001 --> 01:15:35,255
Ted, there's Alpha Beta.

1029
01:15:37,215 --> 01:15:40,677
We're going to have to come
in low to land.

1030
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,180
- Is that difficult, Ted?
- Sure, it's difficult.

1031
01:15:44,264 --> 01:15:47,058
Coming in low is part
of every textbook approach.

1032
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:51,062
It's just something
you have to do when you land.

1033
01:15:57,110 --> 01:16:00,864
Striker, we don't have much time,
but I'll say this...

1034
01:16:00,947 --> 01:16:02,407
you pull this off,

1035
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:07,078
and a lot of people just might forget
that Macho Grande ever happened.

1036
01:16:07,161 --> 01:16:09,956
We'll get her down and down safe.

1037
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:18,047
Before we go any further, there's
something important you should know.

1038
01:16:18,131 --> 01:16:21,009
Slow down!
The base is straight ahead.

1039
01:16:21,092 --> 01:16:23,595
They've just hooked into
a communications satellite,

1040
01:16:23,678 --> 01:16:29,601
and as we speak, our transmissions
are broadcast all over the world.

1041
01:16:29,684 --> 01:16:34,230
Billions of people are hanging
on our every word.

1042
01:16:34,314 --> 01:16:38,943
The eyes, ears, noses and throats
of every American are on you,

1043
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:42,447
each one of them hoping and praying

1044
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:47,577
that you could put
that ship down in one piece.

1045
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:49,245
Ted, we're not stopping.

1046
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:55,084
Now, Striker, start
by positioning your landing gear.

1047
01:16:55,168 --> 01:16:57,629
Lower your flaps.

1048
01:16:57,712 --> 01:17:00,006
Just keep her level.

1049
01:17:02,717 --> 01:17:04,135
There's no looking back.

1050
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:07,680
Put on your horizon sensor
and level her off.

1051
01:17:14,854 --> 01:17:17,315
Ted, we're going back up.

1052
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:23,279
Elaine, you'd better get ready
for this landing.

1053
01:17:25,156 --> 01:17:28,535
Keep up your stabilizers.
Don't lose control.

1054
01:17:28,618 --> 01:17:31,454
Now fire both jets
and hang on with both hands.

1055
01:17:31,538 --> 01:17:34,832
Both hands, damn it!
I'll say one thing,

1056
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:39,462
you bring down that flying hunk
of junk, you're OK in my book.

1057
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:51,224
Don't fight her, Striker.
Hold her up.

1058
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,570
I hope you enjoyed your flight.

1059
01:18:03,653 --> 01:18:07,031
Fly Pan Universe again.

1060
01:18:14,205 --> 01:18:19,252
You gotta hit the center
of that strip or you're a dead duck.

1061
01:18:20,003 --> 01:18:21,838
Let's go home.

1062
01:18:24,632 --> 01:18:27,552
Yes, thank you
for flying Pan Universe.

1063
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:29,512
Have a nice stay.

1064
01:18:42,775 --> 01:18:44,235
Shift those turbo chargers.

1065
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,655
Now check the sensors.
Deploy your secondary boosters.

1066
01:18:49,282 --> 01:18:52,076
Is there a courtesy phone
around here?

1067
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,246
Hello. We'd like you
to have this flower.

1068
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:59,459
We're with the Church
of Lunar Consciousness.

1069
01:18:59,542 --> 01:19:04,756
We'd like you to have this flower.
Would you like to make a donation?

1070
01:19:13,932 --> 01:19:15,475
You're almost home.

1071
01:19:15,558 --> 01:19:17,185
Hold her.

1072
01:19:17,268 --> 01:19:19,229
Stay with her, Striker.

1073
01:19:19,312 --> 01:19:21,648
It takes a soft touch.

1074
01:19:21,731 --> 01:19:25,235
Don't let her get away
from you this time, Striker.

1075
01:19:37,789 --> 01:19:40,458
I don't know
if this is a good time to ask,

1076
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:43,670
but could I get my briefcase back?

1077
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,677
Striker!

1078
01:19:56,349 --> 01:19:59,102
You know what it's like
to laugh like that?

1079
01:19:59,185 --> 01:20:01,312
Yes. Yes, I do.

1080
01:20:02,438 --> 01:20:04,065
What did he get?

1081
01:20:04,148 --> 01:20:06,818
A one-way ticket to the funny farm.

1082
01:20:07,694 --> 01:20:10,530
- Des Moines Institute?
- Then you know it.

1083
01:20:10,613 --> 01:20:12,657
We're familiar with it.

1084
01:20:13,616 --> 01:20:16,578
Just don't come apart on me now.

1085
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:24,294
Jimmy, do you like it
when Scraps holds your leg

1086
01:20:24,377 --> 01:20:26,838
and rubs up and down?

1087
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:30,174
You were gassed by Rok?

1088
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:32,552
I got it! I got it!

1089
01:20:39,309 --> 01:20:40,977
Your navigator Mr Unger.

1090
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:42,645
First officer Mr Dunn.

1091
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:46,608
Let's get to the tower.

1092
01:20:46,691 --> 01:20:48,067
We have no tower.

1093
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:49,861
No tower?

1094
01:20:49,944 --> 01:20:51,321
Just a bridge, sir.

1095
01:20:51,404 --> 01:20:54,532
Why the hell aren't I notified
about these things?

1096
01:20:56,409 --> 01:20:58,578
How would you handle this?

1097
01:20:58,661 --> 01:21:02,207
I want to know absolutely everything
that's happened up till now.

1098
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:05,293
Well, first the Earth cooled.

1099
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:07,128
Then the dinosaurs came,

1100
01:21:07,212 --> 01:21:09,088
but they got fat and died

1101
01:21:09,172 --> 01:21:10,506
and turned into oil.

1102
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:11,758
Then the Arabs came

1103
01:21:11,841 --> 01:21:13,301
and bought Mercedes Benzes.

1104
01:21:13,384 --> 01:21:16,054
Give the court
your impression of Mr Striker.

1105
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,305
I don't do impressions.

1106
01:21:17,388 --> 01:21:19,807
My training is in psychiatry.

1107
01:21:19,891 --> 01:21:22,018
Do you swear to tell the truth,

1108
01:21:22,101 --> 01:21:24,103
so help you God?

1109
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,234
The second time bomb on your right.

1110
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:30,527
Certainly.

1111
01:23:40,573 --> 01:23:44,244
That's exactly what they'll
be expecting us to do.
