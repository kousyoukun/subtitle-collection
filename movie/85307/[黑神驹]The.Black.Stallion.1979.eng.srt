1
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:45,116
Daddy,do you know what I saw?

2
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:48,729
It was the most fantastic thing.
Come look.

3
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,629
My son.

4
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,791
Look,son,
I'm really busy...

5
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:57,405
but I'll tell you
what I do need.

6
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:59,733
I need some good luck.

7
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,785
Okay,Mr. Lucky,
it's time we divvy up the loot.

8
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:19,627
Look at all of these things.
What a night.

9
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:24,465
What do you think of this?
This is pretty. I'll take those.

10
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,903
Try that.
Isn't that pretty?

11
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,771
I better keep that.
That's pretty nice.

12
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,742
I think I better take that.
You shouldn't have that.

13
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,975
I better take that.
You're too young for that.

14
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:40,416
Look at that watch.

15
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:43,523
I'll take that.
That's a pretty watch.

16
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:51,691
It's time I got myself another knife.
So I oughta give you this.

17
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:55,097
You never know when a knife
might come in handy.

18
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,203
You want some gold?
There's lots of gold.

19
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,953
You know,I'll bet this is
the most valuable piece here.

20
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:17,148
It's Bucephalus,the magic horse
of Alexander the Great.

21
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:21,557
A long time ago,this king
was gonna kill Bucephalus...

22
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:24,960
because he was so wild
the king couldn't ride him.

23
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:28,664
He had Bucephalus brought
into a big arena.

24
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,034
People came from all around.

25
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,142
They wanted to see this horse
that was the biggest...

26
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,747
and the blackest and the strongest,
most beautiful horse that ever was.

27
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:43,645
King Philip walked out there
and looked at some of his men.

28
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:46,480
He said,"Kill that horse."

29
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:49,817
Just then a voice called out
from the edge of the crowd.

30
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:52,585
It said,"I can ride that horse."

31
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:57,324
Everybody said,"Who said that?"

32
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:03,233
It was a little kid,just about
your size,just about your age.

33
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:05,668
King Philip said...

34
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,608
"Son,if you can ride that horse,
you can have that horse."

35
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:17,280
So Alexander walked out
into the big arena.

36
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:21,445
Standing in the middle of the arena
was Bucephalus.

37
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:24,683
He was big,and he was strong.

38
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:28,894
He was pawing the ground...

39
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,623
and there was fire in his eyes...

40
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,290
and there was smoke
coming out of his nose.

41
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:36,130
He went--

42
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:39,466
Alexander walked up...

43
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:41,802
then quick as a cat,
he jumped up on his back.

44
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:45,139
He grabbed hold
of that long,black mane...

45
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,905
and away they went,
like lightning.

46
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,482
He jumped right over the crowd,
over the stand...

47
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:53,246
and went ridin' out
over the hill.

48
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:56,923
Everybody said,"Whew!"

49
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,559
Smoke comin' out of his nose!

50
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,158
Fire in his eyes.

51
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,995
Fire in his eyes!

52
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,228
That's the way I heard the story.

53
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,172
Here. I want you
to have this.

54
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,150
Dad,what's going on?

55
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:36,685
Alec,come here!

56
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:43,026
Just take it easy.
We'll be okay.

57
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,990
- What's happening?
- I don't know. Put this on.

58
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,795
Help me with this. Here.
Come here,son.

59
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,528
Put this life vest on.

60
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,866
It's okay.
Tie the bottom.

61
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,584
Let's get outta here!

62
00:14:34,282 --> 00:14:38,275
Hang onto that rail!
Stay right there!

63
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:40,216
I'll be back!

64
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:49,861
Stay there! I'm gonna help these guys!
Don't move! Hang on!

65
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,853
- Help!
- Hey,Alec!

66
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,006
Help!

67
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:13,971
Dad!

68
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:01,451
Help!

69
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,212
Help!

70
00:17:26,787 --> 00:17:29,688
Help!

71
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,770
He saved my life.

72
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:53,343
I can't leave the island
without him.

73
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:57,038
He'll die without me.

74
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,327
Stop!

75
00:48:33,919 --> 00:48:35,853
Let me go!

76
00:48:42,561 --> 00:48:43,858
Black!

77
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,932
Black,come on!

78
00:49:05,184 --> 00:49:06,742
Black!

79
00:50:21,193 --> 00:50:24,128
"Ode to Alec Ramsey."

80
00:50:24,296 --> 00:50:26,958
"I think that I shall never see...

81
00:50:27,132 --> 00:50:32,069
a boy as brave as Alec Ramsey.

82
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,696
Hunger and thirst,
in fear and pain.

83
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:38,435
He lived because
his heart had aim.

84
00:50:38,611 --> 00:50:42,069
A horse
as black as night to day...

85
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,808
a beast,a god...

86
00:50:44,984 --> 00:50:48,215
with whom he did stay.

87
00:50:48,387 --> 00:50:51,481
They slept on the sand
and played in the ocean.

88
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:55,491
And rode over the island
in a singular motion.

89
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:59,654
Now,here he sits,
a hero among boys...

90
00:50:59,832 --> 00:51:05,600
with the love of a horse,
much more than mere toys."

91
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:47,732
I'm very happy
to have my son back.

92
00:53:49,535 --> 00:53:54,131
Thank you. I wish you could have
saved his father too.

93
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,585
You're kind of a pretty horse.

94
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:56,934
Black,no!

95
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:15,185
Black,come back!

96
00:55:58,163 --> 00:56:00,028
Wow!

97
00:56:01,867 --> 00:56:04,563
Yes,I saw a black horse!
It ran thataway!

98
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:57,714
Whoa.

99
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,387
What happened to you?

100
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,620
- Everything.
- Everything?

101
00:58:10,796 --> 00:58:12,696
That's a whole lot.

102
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,798
Can't be everything.

103
00:58:21,606 --> 00:58:24,404
You lost a black horse.

104
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,143
Yeah. Have you seen him?

105
00:58:30,315 --> 00:58:33,250
Do you know where he is?

106
00:58:35,454 --> 00:58:36,785
Napoleon...

107
00:58:38,156 --> 00:58:41,284
did you tell me
you saw a black stallion?

108
00:58:52,037 --> 00:58:54,505
Well,what did he say?

109
00:58:56,174 --> 00:58:59,439
He says,
"Well,not very far from here."

110
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:04,010
Just past the dairy...

111
00:59:04,182 --> 00:59:07,618
there's a big black barn.

112
00:59:07,786 --> 00:59:11,017
Then you see a long bunch
of skinny trees...

113
00:59:11,189 --> 00:59:12,622
that you walk around.

114
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:17,353
Then you go right by a morning star.

115
00:59:17,529 --> 00:59:19,895
You keep following that star...

116
00:59:20,065 --> 00:59:23,899
and see a large patch
of green grass.

117
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:25,434
Then you stop.

118
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,504
Then you listen.

119
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:31,699
Pretty soon you'll see
just what you've been looking for.

120
00:59:55,267 --> 00:59:56,700
Hey,Black!

121
01:00:20,692 --> 01:00:21,989
Black?

122
01:01:22,988 --> 01:01:24,046
Black!

123
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:29,893
Black,it's you!

124
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:39,134
You okay?
I knew it was you.

125
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:00,458
What do you think
you're doin' over there,sonny?

126
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:03,685
I'm gettin' my horse!

127
01:02:13,305 --> 01:02:15,637
You're a big,fat thief!

128
01:02:17,876 --> 01:02:19,844
- Nobody's a thief.
- You are!

129
01:02:20,011 --> 01:02:22,445
I said,"Nobody's a thief."

130
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:27,610
Who do you think you're callin' a thief?
This is my place.

131
01:02:27,819 --> 01:02:29,684
I'm thinkin' that's my horse.

132
01:02:29,854 --> 01:02:33,017
No,he's mine!

133
01:02:33,191 --> 01:02:37,059
Hold on,son.
Wait a minute.

134
01:02:40,198 --> 01:02:42,257
What are you gonna do here,buddy?

135
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:47,004
What are you gonna do?

136
01:02:55,614 --> 01:02:57,047
Easy.

137
01:03:10,962 --> 01:03:13,988
Maybe he is yours...

138
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,636
but I spent all last night tryin'
to catch this wild horse.

139
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,771
All night I spent.

140
01:03:26,945 --> 01:03:29,937
You're just lucky I got him
instead of the police.

141
01:03:30,148 --> 01:03:31,581
Hear me?

142
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:39,516
He kicked a garbageman?

143
01:03:40,992 --> 01:03:42,960
He's somethin',all right.

144
01:03:43,128 --> 01:03:45,062
Did you have any breakfast?

145
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,904
Henry,I think
he likes it out here.

146
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,560
Tried cows. It didn't work.

147
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,166
5:00 in the morning.

148
01:04:24,302 --> 01:04:25,564
Chickens--

149
01:04:28,306 --> 01:04:31,503
They just about drove me nuts.
Chickens.

150
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:37,478
Look,if you clean this stall up
in here real good...

151
01:04:37,649 --> 01:04:41,176
and you get it fit for him,
I could let you have it.

152
01:08:13,731 --> 01:08:16,723
There are too many red cards.

153
01:08:24,776 --> 01:08:27,244
Is The Black fast?

154
01:08:27,445 --> 01:08:29,379
He's fast.

155
01:08:30,915 --> 01:08:33,281
Fast enough
to be a racehorse?

156
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,853
That Black is a desert horse.

157
01:08:39,023 --> 01:08:41,355
He's fast,all right.
Sure,he's fast.

158
01:08:42,894 --> 01:08:45,158
But he hasn't got any papers.

159
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,265
Fast or not,I don't think
they'd ever let him run.

160
01:08:51,369 --> 01:08:53,997
Can I ask you a question?

161
01:08:54,205 --> 01:08:55,797
Sure.

162
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:58,999
Why did you stop training?

163
01:09:05,216 --> 01:09:07,150
I got tired.

164
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:22,493
Do you think you'll ever
try it again?

165
01:09:29,607 --> 01:09:31,074
Sure,I do.

166
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:34,742
Sure.

167
01:09:42,954 --> 01:09:44,387
It's work.

168
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:48,184
Worth it,though.

169
01:09:51,963 --> 01:09:55,023
Hold onto him good,son.
Stay in the center of him.

170
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,258
Turn him around the other way.

171
01:09:57,468 --> 01:10:00,926
The other way,son.
Bring him in and turn him around.

172
01:10:01,139 --> 01:10:03,266
Now send him down around here.

173
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,939
It comes as no surprise
that again this week...

174
01:11:09,107 --> 01:11:12,076
both Sunraider,
the fiery red stallion from the West...

175
01:11:12,176 --> 01:11:14,337
and Cyclone,
the sleek gray from the East...

176
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:16,604
have won their races with ease.

177
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:20,045
They have won
with monotonous regularity.

178
01:11:20,218 --> 01:11:24,348
But,hey-hey,
let's see these two champions...

179
01:11:24,555 --> 01:11:26,182
run head-to-head.

180
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:29,791
Perhaps horse fans will be treated
to the match race of the century.

181
01:11:29,961 --> 01:11:34,455
This is "Hey-Hey" Jim Neville,
from Belmont.

182
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,860
Lookin' this way.
Not lookin' down on the ground.

183
01:11:40,071 --> 01:11:42,801
Lookin' straight ahead.
That's right.

184
01:11:45,576 --> 01:11:47,874
You want to see what's comin',
you look underneath your arm.

185
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,414
Not over your shoulder.
Down under here.

186
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:56,042
In here. See what's going on
down there,all around you.

187
01:11:56,254 --> 01:11:58,950
You can scoot and boot,
understand?

188
01:11:59,157 --> 01:12:02,149
Then you've got your balance.

189
01:12:04,595 --> 01:12:07,564
Keep your knees in close
when you're puttin' your stirrups on.

190
01:12:07,765 --> 01:12:12,498
Check down underneath here too.
Get that leather outta your way.

191
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,968
Pull it back in there underneath
so that your knees--

192
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:18,836
Nothin' in the way in here.
All right.

193
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:22,877
Now you're up. Feel that?
Feel that in your legs?

194
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:26,483
Hmm? Feel it pullin'
on your legs back here?

195
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:31,021
Look ahead down the lane.

196
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,656
No,you don't jump
straight up and down.

197
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,225
Just try and keep your body
as still as possible.

198
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:39,955
He'll be movin'.
He'll be makin' that rhythm.

199
01:12:40,164 --> 01:12:44,066
You just go on with him.
You don't have to pump him.

200
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:47,568
Just kind of go
straight ahead with him.

201
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,707
Just like you're throwing it away,
like this.

202
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,934
Throw it away.
That's right.

203
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:00,539
When a horse starts outta that gate,
you've got to remember this.

204
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:04,517
Remember,you don't want him
to outbreak you.

205
01:13:04,689 --> 01:13:06,884
You know what that means?
That horse starts to settle--

206
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:10,549
They open that gate,wham,like that.

207
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,195
Some of 'em just scat!

208
01:13:13,364 --> 01:13:15,457
You can't do that,
so you grab a handful of mane...

209
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:18,328
just before he says,"Go,"
so he don't outbreak you.

210
01:13:18,536 --> 01:13:22,996
Because they'd open that gate,
and you'd just be sittin' in midair.

211
01:13:23,207 --> 01:13:25,334
You understand?

212
01:13:25,543 --> 01:13:28,011
- This Black can outbreak you.
- Right.

213
01:13:28,212 --> 01:13:30,305
He can move right on out there.

214
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,689
You know,Alec...

215
01:14:54,231 --> 01:14:55,664
"secrecy."

216
01:14:57,268 --> 01:14:58,963
That's the key word.

217
01:15:01,005 --> 01:15:02,632
Yeah. Okay.

218
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,240
Don't just say,"Okay."
Know what I'm talking about.

219
01:15:05,409 --> 01:15:10,472
It's a secret.
You and me,we have a secret.

220
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,869
Now,listen to me.
We'll just make this an easy workout.

221
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,371
- You understand?
- All right.

222
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:41,375
Get him used to this place.
Jake and I will be here with Napoleon.

223
01:15:41,545 --> 01:15:44,514
You go down to the half-mile pole
and watch me.

224
01:15:44,715 --> 01:15:46,649
I'll give you the start
by dropping my hand.

225
01:15:46,817 --> 01:15:50,218
Then I want you to work him
for a half mile.

226
01:15:50,388 --> 01:15:52,720
I want to you to breeze him
for a half mile...

227
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:54,357
then pull him up,nice and easy.

228
01:15:54,558 --> 01:15:57,721
Go down to the half-mile pole
and watch me.

229
01:16:39,537 --> 01:16:41,437
Come on! Let's go!

230
01:17:10,234 --> 01:17:12,361
Too much horse for your boy.

231
01:17:25,382 --> 01:17:28,249
Jake,he's gonna be all right.

232
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:43,091
Come on,Nappy.
Let's go.

233
01:18:11,095 --> 01:18:14,929
Come on! Giddap! Go on,get him!

234
01:18:15,099 --> 01:18:17,567
Pull him up!

235
01:18:18,669 --> 01:18:21,729
Pull him up,Nappy!
On the inside!

236
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:28,903
Come on,Jake.

237
01:18:37,354 --> 01:18:40,983
Hey,your hand's-- You all right?

238
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:42,955
I'm okay.

239
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:46,154
I better walk him now.

240
01:18:46,363 --> 01:18:49,298
All right,go ahead.
Cool him out,son.

241
01:18:56,707 --> 01:18:58,937
Did you get what I got?

242
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:04,103
Right on the button.

243
01:19:05,883 --> 01:19:10,320
That horse has got speed
he ain't even tapped yet.

244
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:22,162
You're not actually--
You're not.

245
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:24,198
You are outta your mind.

246
01:19:24,401 --> 01:19:28,462
That monster has no more business
being out on this track with class--

247
01:19:28,672 --> 01:19:30,503
He's fast,but he's wild.

248
01:19:30,674 --> 01:19:33,234
You saw him zigzagging
all over the course.

249
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,909
What about his papers?

250
01:19:41,852 --> 01:19:45,219
- He ain't got any.
- He ain't?

251
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:47,482
That's taste.

252
01:19:47,691 --> 01:19:51,149
What are you gonna do?
Hitch him up to a plow?

253
01:19:55,032 --> 01:19:56,499
I got an idea.

254
01:20:03,207 --> 01:20:04,834
A match race?

255
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:07,010
Cyclone?

256
01:20:07,211 --> 01:20:09,543
You are too much.

257
01:20:09,713 --> 01:20:12,181
You are really too much.

258
01:20:12,383 --> 01:20:15,318
You got me thinking crazy too.

259
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,394
Squeeze my hand.
I want to try something here.

260
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:41,571
You feel that?
That's a pretty good grip.

261
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:45,869
That's not bad,but we're gonna
have to work on your grip.

262
01:21:46,076 --> 01:21:49,910
What I used when I was a rider
was this ball. See how--

263
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,548
- What does a ball do?
- It strengthens your band.

264
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:57,084
No matter what you're doin'
through the day,just use this ball.

265
01:21:57,254 --> 01:22:01,691
Let me see you do it. Next time you
grip my hand,we'll see a difference.

266
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:05,158
This reporter has
the hottest racing news of the year.

267
01:22:05,329 --> 01:22:06,660
Hold onto your hats.

268
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:09,060
The most sensational
match race imaginable...

269
01:22:09,266 --> 01:22:12,292
between Cyclone from the East
and Sunraider from the West...

270
01:22:12,503 --> 01:22:15,495
is finally set for the afternoon
of August 15 at Santa Anita.

271
01:22:15,706 --> 01:22:18,607
They'll go over two gruelling miles
to prove once and for all...

272
01:22:18,776 --> 01:22:20,835
which is really
the greatest champion.

273
01:22:21,044 --> 01:22:24,673
This is "Hey-Hey" Jim Neville
from Belmont.

274
01:22:47,304 --> 01:22:51,035
Well,whoever you are...

275
01:22:51,241 --> 01:22:53,175
here we go.

276
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:35,617
It's open.

277
01:23:51,201 --> 01:23:54,227
Sure is quiet in here today.

278
01:23:54,438 --> 01:23:56,463
Anything wrong with that?

279
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:00,009
The Black,he--

280
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:04,874
He just wouldn't play.

281
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:09,849
He just stands there
and looks out into the rain.

282
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,315
Maybe The Black is blue today.

283
01:24:14,491 --> 01:24:16,982
- Did you ever think of that?
- "Blue"?

284
01:24:18,395 --> 01:24:20,363
Rain,man,rain.

285
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:30,306
We're gonna show everybody that he's
the fastest horse in the world.

286
01:24:34,044 --> 01:24:36,171
You think you know that animal?

287
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:38,314
Yeah,I know him.

288
01:24:41,518 --> 01:24:43,213
I don't know.

289
01:24:48,058 --> 01:24:50,083
I get a funny feeling.

290
01:24:51,995 --> 01:24:57,900
I feel right now that you better
let that horse stay wild,Alec.

291
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,298
It's his soul.

292
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:30,163
Easy,Black.

293
01:26:08,572 --> 01:26:11,700
- He ain't gonna show.
- I don't wanna hear that.

294
01:26:11,908 --> 01:26:15,344
He'll show. He'll be here.

295
01:26:20,283 --> 01:26:22,808
He probably doesn't even remember us.

296
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:27,480
- He'll be here.
- We're ancient history.

297
01:26:27,691 --> 01:26:30,660
I tell you,he's gonna be here.
He's busy.

298
01:26:30,861 --> 01:26:32,351
He's a little jumpy.

299
01:26:36,867 --> 01:26:39,097
Come on. We'll work him.
Get him out there.

300
01:26:50,447 --> 01:26:53,177
- You okay?
- Where'd he get you?

301
01:26:53,383 --> 01:26:56,011
- On my arm.
- Here?

302
01:26:56,219 --> 01:26:58,244
- Is it broken?
- Leave it alone!

303
01:26:58,455 --> 01:27:00,286
It's all right.
He just nicked me.

304
01:27:00,457 --> 01:27:02,687
Will you please stop?

305
01:27:02,893 --> 01:27:05,828
All right. What?

306
01:27:09,132 --> 01:27:10,565
It's him.

307
01:27:18,508 --> 01:27:22,945
It's him,by God.
I tell you,it's him.

308
01:27:28,018 --> 01:27:29,952
It is him.

309
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:38,494
Yeah. All right. It's him.

310
01:27:45,368 --> 01:27:49,304
All right.
Give him a leg up there.

311
01:27:52,509 --> 01:27:54,875
Remember,this is our big chance.

312
01:27:55,045 --> 01:27:57,070
It's up to you.

313
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,271
Take him out.

314
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,084
Come on! Bring him on!

315
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:58,359
Hey! He's out cold.

316
01:29:58,568 --> 01:30:00,934
He passed out.

317
01:30:02,339 --> 01:30:05,831
Get him out of that mane.
Hold him steady.

318
01:30:06,042 --> 01:30:07,669
- Got him.
- Give me your knife.

319
01:30:07,844 --> 01:30:11,712
- All right.
- Watch it. Hold him steady.

320
01:30:11,848 --> 01:30:13,440
Whoa,sonny.

321
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:34,403
- Where'd you get this animal?
- Get him off.

322
01:30:37,374 --> 01:30:39,672
- Get him outta here.
- I got him.

323
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:42,470
Watch yourself.
Watch it,sir.

324
01:31:12,208 --> 01:31:14,768
What happened?
Did I fall off?

325
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:21,314
No,you hung on like a champ.

326
01:31:32,228 --> 01:31:34,788
What happened?
Where's The Black?

327
01:31:34,998 --> 01:31:37,523
It's all right.
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

328
01:31:37,734 --> 01:31:39,998
He's over in the van with Nappy.

329
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:49,879
He did good,didn't he?

330
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,445
He did great.

331
01:31:51,614 --> 01:31:53,548
You did great.

332
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,688
You all right?

333
01:32:09,265 --> 01:32:13,395
- How did you like what you saw?
- I wasn't disappointed.

334
01:32:14,204 --> 01:32:16,035
Disappointed?

335
01:32:16,206 --> 01:32:19,664
You never saw a horse
run like that in your life.

336
01:32:19,876 --> 01:32:21,901
This could put you back
in the action,eh,Dailey?

337
01:32:23,546 --> 01:32:27,983
Don't get hard with me.
You know I never liked it.

338
01:32:28,184 --> 01:32:29,617
I need this race.

339
01:32:30,854 --> 01:32:33,322
I need it bad,
and you can do it.

340
01:32:36,393 --> 01:32:38,759
Will you do it?

341
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:40,896
If that horse goes like that
with a kid...

342
01:32:41,064 --> 01:32:44,591
- what will he do with a real rider?
- The race.

343
01:32:45,735 --> 01:32:47,362
Nice going,kid.
You got guts.

344
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,643
You heard me say
that Cyclone and Sunraider...

345
01:33:03,853 --> 01:33:05,753
are the fastest horses
in the world today.

346
01:33:05,922 --> 01:33:09,323
I'm going to eat those words now
because I've seen another horse...

347
01:33:09,492 --> 01:33:12,154
that defies the imagination,
that runs like a demon possessed...

348
01:33:12,362 --> 01:33:14,830
at night,alone,
at speeds beyond belief.

349
01:33:15,031 --> 01:33:17,363
He's never run a race,
and he comes out of nowhere...

350
01:33:17,534 --> 01:33:20,833
but he could be the greatest
sensation in racing history.

351
01:33:21,037 --> 01:33:23,267
So I challenge the owners
of both Cyclone...

352
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:28,501
and Sunraider to meet this mystery horse
in their upcoming match race.

353
01:33:28,711 --> 01:33:30,235
This isn't a joke.

354
01:33:30,447 --> 01:33:33,678
This mystery horse is real,
and I'll stake my reputation on it.

355
01:33:33,883 --> 01:33:37,319
This is "Hey-Hey" Jim Neville
from Belmont.

356
01:33:42,225 --> 01:33:46,457
Do you know any
real good,famous jockeys?

357
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:50,861
There are a lot of 'em.
George Wolf,the Iceman.

358
01:33:51,067 --> 01:33:54,525
That's just what they call him.
Georgie Wolf.

359
01:33:54,737 --> 01:33:57,069
They call him in the newspapers
the Iceman...

360
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,868
because he sits chilly
on a horse.

361
01:34:00,076 --> 01:34:02,044
That means he sits there
and he can wait.

362
01:34:02,245 --> 01:34:04,372
He knows what to do.
He's studying a horse.

363
01:34:04,581 --> 01:34:08,711
He's up there ridin',
goin' on with him.

364
01:34:08,918 --> 01:34:11,386
You know what I mean?
He's sittin' up there,goin' on...

365
01:34:11,588 --> 01:34:13,522
just studyin' him!

366
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:17,319
Studyin' him.
Just studyin' him.

367
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:20,587
When it's time to make his move,
he'll say--

368
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,333
Here comes the Iceman!

369
01:34:42,785 --> 01:34:46,619
Mom,do you want me
to mow the lawn...

370
01:34:46,789 --> 01:34:49,280
or wash the dishes
or something?

371
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:54,827
Sure.

372
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:59,468
Why don't you make all the beds
and vacuum in here too?

373
01:35:22,525 --> 01:35:25,926
- Mom,have you read this here? See?
- What is it?

374
01:35:29,666 --> 01:35:32,066
This is more about that mystery horse.

375
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:45,510
Remember last year when they were
giving away aluminum ballpoint pens?

376
01:35:45,715 --> 01:35:48,149
- The Black is the mystery horse.
- It's amazing the lengths...

377
01:35:48,318 --> 01:35:53,187
they will go to get people
to go to a horse race.

378
01:35:53,389 --> 01:35:55,516
And I'm gonna ride him.

379
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:57,593
I'll get it!

380
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,126
What did you say? Wait!

381
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:04,528
Alec,wait one more second.
What did you say? Say that again.

382
01:36:04,734 --> 01:36:07,567
The Black is the mystery horse,
and I'm gonna ride him.

383
01:36:07,737 --> 01:36:10,433
Alec,that horse
is not the mystery horse.

384
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,609
Even if he were,
you're not gonna ride him.

385
01:36:13,776 --> 01:36:16,244
It was a secret.
I told you as soon as I could.

386
01:36:16,446 --> 01:36:19,574
You're not supposed to keep
secrets from your mother.

387
01:36:22,018 --> 01:36:24,953
- Someone's at the door.
- I know!

388
01:36:27,023 --> 01:36:28,490
Mrs. Ramsey,how--

389
01:36:30,026 --> 01:36:34,656
The Black is the mystery horse,
and you're gonna ride him in a race.

390
01:36:39,202 --> 01:36:43,332
All right. Well,well,well.

391
01:36:43,539 --> 01:36:46,007
Isn't this just fascinating timing?

392
01:36:46,209 --> 01:36:48,837
What's been going on
between you two guys and that horse?

393
01:36:49,045 --> 01:36:52,378
- I have a right to know.
- Guess you've been talking to Alec.

394
01:36:52,548 --> 01:36:56,882
I have been trying to. Would you like
to tell me something about this?

395
01:36:57,053 --> 01:36:59,886
- I'd be happy to.
- Come in,please.

396
01:37:00,056 --> 01:37:05,790
It's quite a long story,
Mrs. Ramsey.

397
01:37:06,896 --> 01:37:09,194
I'm sure it's a long story.

398
01:37:09,399 --> 01:37:12,266
But you've got to be kidding,
thinking I'll let him ride in a race.

399
01:37:12,435 --> 01:37:15,461
My son could get killed
in a horse race.

400
01:37:15,672 --> 01:37:18,505
I think you
could be exaggerating.

401
01:37:18,675 --> 01:37:21,803
I'm not exaggerating.
Don't lie to me,Mr. Dailey.

402
01:37:22,011 --> 01:37:25,811
You're willing to risk his life?
I'm not willing to risk his life.

403
01:37:26,015 --> 01:37:29,348
I've lost a husband,
and I'm not gonna lose a son.

404
01:37:29,519 --> 01:37:34,650
I wouldn't hurt that boy
for anything in the world.

405
01:37:34,857 --> 01:37:38,691
What kind of dreams
are you filling his head with?

406
01:37:38,861 --> 01:37:43,321
It's much more than just a race.

407
01:37:43,533 --> 01:37:47,264
Your son has his heart set on it.

408
01:37:49,706 --> 01:37:52,834
Good-bye,Mr. Dailey.

409
01:37:53,042 --> 01:37:54,976
Good-bye,Mrs. Ramsey.

410
01:38:13,996 --> 01:38:17,727
So what happened to the new deal,
the clean slate?

411
01:38:22,004 --> 01:38:26,338
Alec,I can't let you
ride in that horse race.

412
01:38:26,509 --> 01:38:28,443
It's ridiculous.

413
01:38:32,348 --> 01:38:33,815
I'm sorry.

414
01:38:46,696 --> 01:38:48,163
What is that?

415
01:38:49,866 --> 01:38:52,426
Alexander the Great's horse.

416
01:39:07,717 --> 01:39:09,776
Dad gave it to me...

417
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,546
just before the storm.

418
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:29,066
It reminds me
of The Black and me.

419
01:39:31,541 --> 01:39:36,843
Alexander's father gave it to him...

420
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:38,947
before he died.

421
01:39:44,854 --> 01:39:49,154
I was in the water.

422
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:51,553
I couldn't breathe.

423
01:39:51,761 --> 01:39:54,924
It was dark and...

424
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:04,264
I yelled out for Dad,but--

425
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:12,837
I looked up,
and there was The Black...

426
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:15,517
and I grabbed onto him.

427
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:17,811
He saved your life,didn't he?

428
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:42,241
What am I gonna do?

429
01:40:49,318 --> 01:40:51,309
I gotta ride.

430
01:41:16,212 --> 01:41:17,645
Okay,Alec.

431
01:42:22,378 --> 01:42:25,370
Neville planned the publicity?

432
01:42:25,581 --> 01:42:28,516
I'll bet the mystery horse
don't even show.

433
01:42:31,721 --> 01:42:34,281
Did you see that?

434
01:42:35,891 --> 01:42:38,121
I'll beat him.

435
01:42:39,729 --> 01:42:43,392
- I heard Mendoza's comin' in.
- Who's missing from the room?

436
01:42:43,599 --> 01:42:46,898
- That beats him right there.
- Yeah. Who rides him?

437
01:42:47,103 --> 01:42:49,367
Where did that guy over there
get them silks?

438
01:42:49,572 --> 01:42:53,440
- Looks like he's ready for Halloween.
- It sure does.

439
01:42:58,781 --> 01:43:00,806
Rider number one,up.

440
01:43:06,022 --> 01:43:10,049
- Number one,sir.
- Add two pounds.

441
01:43:10,259 --> 01:43:12,090
Got that,George?

442
01:43:23,105 --> 01:43:25,073
Rider number two now.

443
01:43:28,177 --> 01:43:29,610
Thank you.

444
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,814
Rider number three.

445
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:40,111
Number three?
Number three?

446
01:43:40,322 --> 01:43:41,619
How do I look?

447
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:43,849
Number three,please.

448
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,585
I don't think he's gonna show.
It's been a joke.

449
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:04,974
The mystery rider.
Hop on the scale.

450
01:44:05,181 --> 01:44:08,878
-He's not strong enough to go two miles.
-No way. Too small.

451
01:44:09,085 --> 01:44:12,987
- Rider on the scale,please.
- He's on the scale,sir.

452
01:44:13,155 --> 01:44:15,020
He's on the scale?

453
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:19,293
Add it on.

454
01:45:49,385 --> 01:45:53,378
Take him out.
All right,bring him right on out.

455
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:34,827
Two miles.
They'll come by the stands twice.

456
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:36,497
The stands are jammed.

457
01:47:43,732 --> 01:47:46,132
He's moving on the black horse,
the mystery horse.

458
01:47:52,207 --> 01:47:53,936
Bring that horse.

459
01:48:17,499 --> 01:48:19,023
Cyclone,settle! Whoa!

460
01:49:11,887 --> 01:49:13,411
Whoa!

461
01:49:15,591 --> 01:49:17,354
Stop,Black!

462
01:49:18,994 --> 01:49:21,019
There's some problem
with the mystery horse.

463
01:49:46,989 --> 01:49:49,457
Cyclone keeping the pace.

464
01:50:18,353 --> 01:50:20,321
They're in the front turn now.

465
01:53:05,787 --> 01:53:08,312
He's won!
The mystery horse won!

466
01:53:21,203 --> 01:53:23,671
This,ladies and gentlemen--

467
01:54:02,244 --> 01:54:06,977
This horse has got a leg like iron.
It's gonna be all right,son.
