It's Bucephalus, the magic horse
of Alexander the Great.

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,820
A long time ago, this king
was gonna kill Bucephalus...

because he was so wild
the king couldn't ride him.

that was the biggest...

most beautiful horse that ever was.

King Philip walked out there
and looked at some of his men.

41

He said, 'Kill that horse.'

42
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,080
Just then a voice called out
from the edge of the crowd.

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,750
It said, 'I can ride that horse.'

King Philip said...

'Son, if you can ride that horse,
you can have that horse.'

So Alexander walked out
into the big arena.

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,710
Standing in the middle of the arena
was Bucephalus.

then quick as a cat,
he jumped up on his back.

Remember, you don't want him
to outbreak you.

330
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:55,140
You know what that means?
That horse starts to settle...

331
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:58,810
They open that gate, wham, like that.

332
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:01,410
Some of 'em just scat!

333
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:03,720
You can't do that,
so you grab a handful of mane...

334
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:06,590
just before he says, 'Go,'
so he don't outbreak you.

335
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:11,260
Because they'd open that gate,
and you'd just be sitting' in mid-air.

336
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:13,590
You understand?

337
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:16,260
- This Black can outbreak you.
- Right.

338
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,460
He can move right on out there.

339
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:40,850
[Henry]
You know, Alec...

340
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,790
'secrecy.'

341
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:47,120
That's the key word.

342
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,890
Yeah. Okay.

343
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,450
Don't just say, 'Okay.'
Know what I'm talking about.

344
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:58,630
It's a secret.
You and me, we have a secret.

345
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:24,090
[Henry] Now, listen to me.
We'll just make this an easy workout.

346
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,600
- You understand?
- All right.

347
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:29,600
Get him used to this place.
Jake and I will be here with Napoleon.

348
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:32,760
You go down to the half-mile pole
and watch me.

349
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,860
I'll give you the start
by dropping my hand.

350
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:38,430
Then I want you to work him
for a half mile.

351
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,950
I want to you to breeze him
for a half mile...

352
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:42,610
then pull him up, nice and easy.

353
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,880
Go down to the half-mile pole
and watch me.

354
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,560
Come on! Let's go!

355
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,950
[Alec Grunting]

356
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,520
Too much horse for your boy.

357
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,370
Jake, he's gonna be all right.

358
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:31,250
Hyah. Come on, Nappy.
Let's go.

359
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,670
- [Whinnies]
- Whoa.

360
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:03,150
[Henry]
Come on! Giddap! Go on, get him!

361
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,690
Pull him up!

362
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:09,880
Pull him up, Nappy!
On the inside!

363
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:17,060
Come on, Jake.

364
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:25,410
[Snorts]

365
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,240
[Henry]
Hey, your hand's... You all right?

366
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,110
I'm okay.

367
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,410
[Alec]
I better walk him now.

368
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,420
All right, go ahead.
Cool him out, son.

369
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:44,760
[Jake Chuckles]

370
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:47,090
Did you get what I got?

371
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,260
- [Jake Chuckles]
- Right on the button.

372
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,440
That horse has got speed
he ain't even tapped yet.

373
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,870
You're not...

374
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:10,390
You're not actually...
You're not.

375
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,450
You are out of your mind.

376
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,720
That monster has no more business
being out on this track with class...

377
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:18,730
- [Henry Laughs]
- He's fast, but he's wild.

378
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,390
You saw him zigzagging
all over the course.

379
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,730
[Henry Grunts]

380
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,060
What about his papers?

381
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:33,430
- He ain't got any.
- He ain't?

382
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,740
That's taste.

383
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:39,300
What are you gonna do?
Hitch him up to a plough?

384
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,650
No.

385
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:44,620
I got an idea.

386
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:53,090
A match race?

387
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,260
Cyclone?

388
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:57,770
You are too much.

389
01:19:57,830 --> 01:20:00,430
You are really too much.
[Chuckling]

390
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,440
You got me thinking crazy too.

391
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,650
Squeeze my hand.
I want to try something here.

392
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,780
You feel that?
That's a pretty good grip.

393
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:34,130
That's not bad, but we're gonna
have to work on your grip.

394
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:38,130
What I used when I was a rider
was this ball. See how...

395
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,800
- What does a ball do?
- It strengthens your band.

396
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:45,310
No matter what you're doing'
through the day, just use this ball.

397
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:49,900
Let me see you do it. Next time you
grip my hand, we'll see a difference.

398
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:53,380
[Neville On Radio] This reporter has
the hottest racing news of the year.

399
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,880
Hold onto your hats.

400
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:57,320
The most sensational
match race imaginable...

401
01:21:57,390 --> 01:22:00,550
between Cyclone from the East
and Sunraider from the West...

402
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:03,750
is finally set for the afternoon
of August 15 at Santa Anita.

403
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:06,820
They'll go over two gruelling miles
to prove once and for all...

404
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,090
which is really
the greatest champion.

405
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:12,830
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville
from Belmont.

406
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:39,290
[Henry]
Well, whoever you are...

407
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,300
here we go.

[Knocking]

410
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,740
It's open.

411

(music)(music) [Humming Continues]

412
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,490
Sure is quiet in here today.

413
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,620
Anything wrong with that?

414
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,130
The Black, he...

415
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,130
He just wouldn't play.

416
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:57,970
He just stands there
and looks out into the rain.

417
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,800
[Clears Throat]

418
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,570
[Man]
Maybe The Black is blue today.

419
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:05,110
- Did you ever think of that?
- 'Blue'?

420
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:08,510
[Chuckles]
Rain, man, rain.

421
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:09,880
Rain.

422
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:14,420
[Clears Throat]

423
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:18,430
We're gonna show everybody that he's
the fastest horse in the world.

424
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:24,430
You think you know that animal?

425
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,440
Yeah, I know him.

426
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:31,370
I don't know.

427
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,910
[Man Sighs]

428
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:38,240
I get a funny feeling.

429
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:46,020
I feel right now that you better
let that horse stay wild, Alec.

430
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,450
It's his soul.

431
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:01,670
[Thunder Rumbling]

432
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,400

[Thunder Rumbling]

434
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:18,280
- [Whinnies]
- Easy, Black.

435
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:59,960
- He ain't gonna show.
- I don't wanna hear that.

436
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:03,490
He'll show. He'll be here.

437
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:06,800
[Alec Sighs]

438
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,070
[Jake]
He probably doesn't even remember us.

439
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:15,740
- He'll be here.
- We're ancient history.

440
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:18,910
I tell you, he's gonna be here.
He's busy.

441
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,510
[Alec]
He's a little jumpy.

442
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,910
- [Thunderclap]
- [Whinnying]

443
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:27,250
Come on. We'll work him.
Get him out there.

[Alec] Henry!

- [Alec] You okay?
- [Jake] Where'd he get you?

447
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,270
- On my arm.
- [Jake] Here?

448
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,500
- [Jake] Is it broken?
- [Henry] Leave it alone!

449
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,510
It's all right.
He just nicked me.

450
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,940
Will you please stop?

451
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:53,950
All right. What?

452
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,690
It's him.

453
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:06,560
- It's him.
- [Jake] No.

454
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:11,070
[Henry] It's him, by God.
I tell you, it's him.

455
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,070
[Jake]
It is him.

456
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:26,620
Yeah. All right. It's him.

457
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:37,430
[Henry]
All right. Give him a leg up there.

458
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:43,100
Remember, this is our big chance.

459
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,330
It's up to you.

460
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,430
Take him out.

461
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,200
Come on! Bring him on!

Hey! He's out cold.

468
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:49,060
- He passed out.
- [Black Panting]

469
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:54,090
Get him out of that mane.
Hold him steady.

470
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,930
- [Jake] Got him.
- [Henry] Give me your knife.

471
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,930
- [Jake] All right.
- [Henry] Watch it. Hold him steady.

[Jake] Whoa, sonny.

[Henry Groans, Mutters]
Here.

474
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:22,520
- Where'd you get this animal?
- [Henry] Get him off.

475
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:25,420
- [Henry Groans]
- [Jake] Good boy.

476
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:27,930
- [Henry] Get him out of here.
- [Jake] I got him.

477
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,630
Watch yourself.
Watch it, sir.

478
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:33,290
- [Black Snorts]
- [Jake] Whoa, boy.

479
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,920
What happened?
Did I fall off?

480
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:05,560
No.

481
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:09,430
No, you hung on like a champ.

482
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:23,050
What happened?
Where's The Black?

483
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,780
It's all right.
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

484
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:28,150
He's over in the van with Nappy.

485
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:38,120
He did good, didn't he?

run like that in your life.

in the action, eh, Dailey?

with a kid...

- [Henry] The race.

Nice going, kid.
You got guts.

that Cyclone and Sunraider...

in the world today.

502

503
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:00,410
that defies the imagination,
that runs like a demon possessed...

at speeds beyond belief.

and he comes out of nowhere...

506

but he could be the greatest
sensation in racing history.

of both Cyclone...

in their upcoming match race.

They call him in the newspapers
the Iceman...

516
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,120
because he sits chilly
on a horse.

That means he sits there
and he can wait.

He's studying a horse.
