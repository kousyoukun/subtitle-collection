1
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,210
天 那是我想的东西吗？
Oh, man! Is that what I think it is?

2
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,180
好了 新丁 欢迎来到越南 跟我来
All right, cheesedicks. Welcome to the Nam. Follow me.

3
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,520
糟了 有新血
I'll be dipped in shit. New meat!

4
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,730
你们会很喜欢越南的 永远的
You dudes gonna love the Nam. For-fucking-ever.

5
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,460
365天
365 and a wake-up. Oh, lord.

6
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,450
1967年9月B连第25队步兵

7
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,450
在柬埔寨边境附近

8
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,430
下面小心
Watch it below!

9
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,130
莫浩 走快点
Morehouse, drop back to slack.

10
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,160
查理 谁在队尾？
Who's on tail-end Charlie?

11
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,080
总部 这是六队 位置如下…
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six, Pos rep follows,'

12
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,420
L、A、W、A、F…
Lemur, Alpha, Whiskey, Alpha, Foxtrot...,

13
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,090
华伦 你去队侧
Warren, you get out on flank.

14
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,230
- 何迈特 - 什么事？
- Hey, Hoffmeister! - Yo?

15
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,500
你有香烟吗？
You got a smoke?

16
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,740
- 没有 - 没关系
- No, man, I don't. - Sin loi, man.

17
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,030
B26 为何延迟了？
Bravo 2-6. What's the delay on point?

18
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,740
又找不到路了吗？
Having compass trouble again?

19
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,470
继续走
Get a move on, boy.

20
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,330
你还在等什么？
Boy, what you waiting for?

21
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,040
他不会咬你
He ain't gonna bite you.

22
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,180
那是越南兵 死了
That's a good gook. Good and dead.

23
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,400
- 新丁 - 新丁
- Cherry. - Yo, cherry!

24
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,440
行动 第六队说我们挡住了他们 完毕
Move it out. Six says we're jamming them up back there. Over.

25
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,370
叫他去见鬼吧
Tell that dipshit to get fucked.

26
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,410
这是第25队 听好 我们很快便出发 完毕
This is 2-5. Be advised. We're moving out shortly. Out.

27
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,980
泰勒 你怎么了？
What's the matter with you, Taylor?

28
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
你是个大混蛋
You are one simple son of a bitch.

29
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,960
中士 对不起
I'm sorry, sergeant.

30
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,660
叫另外那个新丁过来 葛拿 还有军医
Get that other cherry up here. Gardner. And the doc.

31
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,860
葛拿 军医 上前来
Gardner, doc, up!

32
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,690
葛拿 军医 上前来
Gardner, doc, to the front!

33
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,800
葛拿 快过来 你他妈的
Gardner, get your ass up the hill, you fat fuck!

34
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,170
大胖子 快点
Hurry up, bubble- butt!

35
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,720
-  你有没有事？  -  蚂蚁
-  You all right?   -  Ants.

36
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,120
我脖子全都是蚂蚁
I got ants all over my neck.

37
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,070
这些是红蚂蚁
You got some red ants.

38
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,060
红蚂蚁是杀手 黑蚂蚁最可怕
Reds are killers. Black ants are the worse.

39
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,940
快点 混球
Hurry up, lard-ass!

40
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,800
我很累
I'm so tired!

41
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,640
只喝一点
Just a little.

42
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,110
不要喝太多 你不要再喝了
Don't drink too much. I don't want you drinking any more.

43
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,610
我不想你抽搐
I don't want you cramping up.

44
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,290
你带着太多东西
You're humping too much stuff.

45
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,590
有一半是不需要的
You don't need half this shit.

46
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,790
我帮你拿
I'll haul it for you.

47
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,000
但请你下次先向我请示
But next time check with me first, all right?

48
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,360
谢谢你 中士
Thanks, sarge.

49
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,210
-  你有没有事？   -  没事
-  Are you okay?    -  Yeah.

50
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,380
这是总部 有直升机接近你们
2-2, this is six, I understand you have a bird inbound at your pos,

51
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,560
总部 请留意
Bravo Six, be advised.

52
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,830
军资直升机正驶来
Resupply helo is inbound at this time, Over,

53
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,740
快点搬军火下来
Go, you people! Get that ammo off now!

54
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,850
这个字不是这样写的
It ain't D-E-R-E. It's D-E-A-R.

55
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,950
而且莎拉也不是那样写的 笨蛋
And Sarah ain't got no two R's, King. Damn, you dumb!

56
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,390
没关系 她会明白我的意思
Don't matter. She know what I mean.

57
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,860
她也不大认识字
She don't read too good nohow.

58
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,700
你看 又是猪肉
Look at this shit! Pork again!

59
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,700
我跟你换你的火鸡 我不能再吃这玩意了
Trade me that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man. I can't eat this shit.

60
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,380
你抽了什么？
What you been smoking?

61
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,280
希望你不用洗衣服 你要运动一下
I hope you don't get that laundry gig. Your ass need to hump, hump.

62
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,020
白小子 你在等什么？
Hey, white boy! What you waiting for?

63
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,310
那个洞不会自己出现的
That hole won't dig itself.

64
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,020
快点掘
Come on. Get your dick skin on that thing!

65
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,660
时间无多 快点掘…
You ain't got all day! Dig, dig!

66
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,230
有人写过 "地狱是不可理喻的"
Somebody once wrote, ''Hell is the impossibility of reason, ''

67
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,370
这个地方就像地狱
That's what this place feels like,' hell,

68
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,830
我只是来了一周 但已经讨厌这里
I hate it already, and it's only been a week,

69
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,470
祖母 这一周很痛苦
Some goddamn week, Grandma,

70
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,240
最辛苦的事就是这星期站岗三次
The hardest thing I've ever done is go on point three times this week,

71
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,170
我不知道我在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing,

72
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,850
我连越共在我面前出现也不知道
A gook could be right in front of me and I wouldn't know it,

73
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,740
我实在很累
I'm so tired,

74
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,290
我们早上五点起床…
We get up at 5,'00 a,m...

75
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,360
整天走动 四五点钟扎营 掘壕沟 进食…
...hump all day, camp around 4 or 5, dig a foxhole, eat...

76
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,260
然后整晚埋伏 或是当哨兵
...then put out an all-night ambush or a listening post,

77
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,190
我是新来的 没有人教我任何事
Nobody tells me how to do anything because I'm new,

78
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,770
没人理会新丁 他们连你的名字也不想知道
Nobody cares about the new guys, They don't want to know your name,

79
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,670
新丁的生命不重要 因为他没有经验
A new guy's life isn't worth much because he hasn't put his time in yet,

80
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,610
若在越南战死 最好在最初几周
If you're gonna get killed in Nam, it's better to get it in the first weeks,

81
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,680
原因是你不会受太多苦
The logic being, you don't suffer that much,

82
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,050
如果幸运 留在外围防线…
If you're lucky, you stay in the perimeter...

83
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,590
守卫时能够睡三至四小时
...then pull a guard shift, so you sleep three or four hours,

84
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,190
但你不能真的入睡
But you don't really sleep,

85
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,700
我认为我撑不到一年
I don't think I can keep this up for a year, Grandma,

86
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,430
我不应该来这里
I've made a big mistake coming here,

87
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,770
我们有很多活动
We got beaucoup movement.

88
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,250
第三部队在15公里外被袭击
3rd Battalion got hit 15 klicks north of here.

89
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,580
越共在树上挂上地雷
Charlie had claymores strung in the trees.

90
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,950
整排军队被炸 真倒霉
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit.

91
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,470
两个中尉和一个上尉被炸死
Got two lieutenants and a captain.

92
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,960
我的天
Jesus.

93
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,030
你想谁去埋伏？
All right, who do you want on ambush?

94
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,230
奕礼 你带你的小队出去
Elias, you take your squad out.

95
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,840
华伦 留下 我需要德斯和小尊
Warren, stay in, but I need Tex and Junior from your squad.

96
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,580
知道
Roger that.

97
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,080
调动到20M的位置
Move out in 2-0 mikes.

98
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,350
我以为今晚轮到奥尼尔
I thought it was O'NeilI's turn tonight.

99
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,160
托斯和莫浩经验不足
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

100
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,720
福生明天放假 还要他们去吗？
Fu Sheng is going on R and R tomorrow. You want to send them out on ambush?

101
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,820
你要带新丁去
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

102
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,530
他们什么都不懂 可能会遇到事情 仔细想想
They don't know shit and we'll probably run into something. Think about it.

103
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,770
太好了 你想我怎样做？
Great. What do you want me to do?

104
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,300
你想我为了一个混蛋要好好睡觉 而让手下被杀吗？
Get one of my guys zapped so a lame ass can get his beauty sleep?

105
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,610
奥尼尔…
Hey, O'Neill...

106
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,310
别再啰嗦
...take a break.

107
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,880
你不用每天都这么讨厌
You needn't be a prick every day.

108
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,810
奕礼 叫手下准备好
Elias, get your men ready.

109
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,050
他来了三年 以为自己是耶稣
Guy's in 3 years, thinks he's Jesus Christ.

110
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,480
奥尼尔 他们留下 但你要去
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out.

111
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,590
我需要有经验的老兵
I need veterans out there.

112
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,520
彭斯中士？
Sergeant Barnes?

113
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,900
在他们面前应由我下命令
I think in front of the men, I need to give the orders.

114
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,100
是 长官
Yes, sir.

115
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,450
看来会下雨
Shit, looks like rain.

116
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,180
我们整晚都要在雨中了
It's gonna piss on us all night.

117
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,650
会令你脸烂掉
It'll put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours.

118
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,530
你为那个白人而冒险
Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man.

119
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,230
这里是没有公义的
No justice around here.

120
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,160
奥尼尔又触怒中尉了？
What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

121
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,400
为什么总是我们负责埋伏？
Why do we always get fucking ambush?

122
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,570
这是因为他们在玩政治
Because it's politics, man. Politics.

123
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,680
- 我有否给你看过露珍的照片？ - 没有
- Did I show you a picture of Lucy Jean? - No, you didn't.

124
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,910
她会是我的另一半
She's the one for me all right, that Lucy Jean.

125
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,840
她也在等我
She's waiting for me too.

126
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,680
她很漂亮 你很幸福
She's real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

127
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,960
你有你女朋友的照片吗？
You got a picture of your girl?

128
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,560
那我们有一个被留在家乡的可怜女孩 不是吗？
That leaves some unlucky girl back home, don't it?

129
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,690
插进去
Tuck this in.

130
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,400
装进去
Shit-can this.

131
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,270
不需要这个 转身
Don't need this. Turn around.

132
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,800
来吧
Come on.

133
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,440
德斯! 跟小尊和泰勒一队
Tex! You got Junior and Taylor here on your position.

134
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,340
奕礼 不要乱来

我会坐在海滩上看美女
I'll be sitting outside checking out the babes on the beach.

269
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,810
冲浪一定会很好玩
The surfing's gonna be good.

270
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,310
三月在田纳西州
March, man, in Tennessee.

271
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:30,020
可以闻到松树的气味 可以在河边闻到女人的气味
Sniff the pines. Sniff that pussy down by the river.

272
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,950
真棒
Hot damn!

273
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,450
泰勒 你还有多少天？
Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?

274
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,400
- 三百什么？ - 三十二
- Three hundred and what? - Thirty-two.

275
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,130
332天
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

276
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,300
傻小子
Sin loi, my boy.

277
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,300
我不记得那个日子了
I can't even remember when I was 332, man.

278
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,940
你要向前数 好像你已来了40天
You gotta count backwards or something, like you got 40 days in.

279
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,240
想的乐观些
Think positive, dude.

280
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,480
你怎会来这里？你看来受过教育
How in the fuck did you get here anyway? You look educated.

281
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,090
-  我自愿来的    -  什么？
-  I volunteered for it.     -  You did what?

282
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,390
我自愿来的
I volunteered.

283
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,290
我退出大学 想加入越战
I dropped out of college and told them I wanted infantry, combat, Vietnam.

284
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,330
你自愿来的？
You volunteered for this shit, man?

285
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,260
你能相信吗？
Can you believe that?

286
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,490
你放弃念大学实在太疯狂
You is a crazy fucker, giving up college.

287
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,440
我在大学什么都学不到
It didn't make much sense. I wasn't learning anything.

288
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,180
为什么穷人就要去打仗 有钱人就不用？
Why should the poor kids go to war and the rich kids get away with it?

289
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,510
他是个斗士
What we got here is a crusader.

290
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,280
- 看来是了 - 可恶
- Sounds like it. - Shit.

291
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,290
你一定是很富有才会那样想
You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that.

292
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,160
大家都知道…
Everybody knows...

293
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,560
穷人总是被有钱人欺负
...the poor's always fucked over by the rich.

294
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,520
那是不能改变的事实
Always have, always will.

295
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,200
如果你上道 我会介绍一些大头给你认识
If you be cool, I'll introduce you to some of the heads.

296
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,010
什么样的大头？
What are the heads?

297
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,110
晚一点吧
Later, man.

298
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,480
怎么了？
What's up, brother?

299
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,280
大人驾到 发生什么事了？
Your Highness has arrived. What's happening?

300
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,960
我以为你在柬埔寨
I thought you was hanging ten in Cambodia.

301
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,610
你为什么在这里？
Why are you in the underworld?

302
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,610
这个不是泰勒 泰勒中枪了 是柯里斯 他被救活了
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This is Chris. He been resurrected.

303
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,850
泰勒 你跛了吗？
You lame, Taylor?

304
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,990
你是跛的吗？
Are you lame or something?

305
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,790
继续吧 抽一口吧
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

306
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,880
抽一口享受一下吧
Your shit's in the wind, troop.

307
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,710
你好吗？
Hey, man. What's happening?

308
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,280
不是那样叫的
If you do that ''baa,'' you do it right.

309
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,730
你很古怪
You're weird, man.

310
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,220
你是个孩子 我不会在你身上浪费时间
You're a child. I don't waste time on you.

311
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,400
-  第一次吗？   -  是
-  First time?     -  Yeah.

312
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,910
那么你一定会上瘾
Then the worm has definitely turned for you, man.

313
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,150
感觉好吗？
Feel good?

314
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,250
感觉很好 我的脖子不痛了
Yeah, it feels good. I got no pain in my neck now.

315
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,690
感觉很好已足够
Feeling good's good enough.

316
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,530
放入口里
Put your mouth on this.

317
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,020
大家在哪里？
Where the hell is everybody, man?

318
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,130
大家都正在享受 一群毒虫 他们觉得他们很特别
They're getting high. Bunch of hopheads. They think they're special.

319
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,600
你听 很糟的演奏
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

320
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,330
烦透的噪音 就是那样
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

321
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,910
和你一样那么烦
Make about as much sense as you do.

322
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,370
他们都在埋怨…
All them chucks be rapping about how they losing their ho...

323
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,450
埋怨自己没有钱
...saying how they ain't got no bread for beer.

324
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,680
去他的!  给我黑人音乐 开始吧？
Fuck that honky shit! Gotta get me some Motown jams, dig it?

325
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,650
你干嘛那样说？
What are you talking that shit for?

326
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,820
小尊 你吸食过毒品吗？
Junior, you ever smoke any shit?

327
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,060
对
That's right.

328
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,960
你们想用毒品荼毒黑人
You trying to keep the black man down and string him out on that shit.

329
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,830
但黑人很快就会推翻你们
But the time's coming when the black man will throw that yoke off.

330
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,940
很简单 释放你的心灵就行 你的身体就会跟随
Simple. Free your mind, your ass will follow.

331
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,280
明白 你吸那东西 一切会变得离奇
Yeah, I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit and everything gets weird.

332
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,570
越南人在草丛散布化学毒药
You hear about gooks putting chemicals in the grass...

333
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,320
令我们不再打仗 变成反战者吧
...so we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

334
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,590
不用担心 你怎样都是个杀手
But don't you worry, Bunny, you's a killer anyway.

335
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,480
但我仍然喜欢女人
But I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

336
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,890
除了赛车 没东西比得上女人
Nothing like a piece of pussy, except maybe the lndy 500.

337
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,820
只有女人死了遗留她的身体给你
Only way you get pussy is if the bitch dies and wills it to you...

338
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,790
你或许才会有
...and then maybe.

339
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,370
宾尼 你好吗？
How's it going, Bunny?

340
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,160
中尉

你喜欢吗？
You like that?

343
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,240
很棒
Terrific.

344
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,980
我会寄回家
I'll send it home.

345
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,220
小尊
Hey, Junior.

346
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,320
- 中尉 - 你好
- Lieutenant. - Hello, sir.

347
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,800
罗志杰 你的寺庙很棒

348
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,430
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

349
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,300
-  你有什么需要吗？    -  没有
-  You need anything?    -  No, sir.

350
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,240
这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

351
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,610
这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

352
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,640
他被奥尼尔勒着
He's in the O'Neill death grip.

353
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,570
他不知道要害怕还是瞎了较好
He doesn't know whether to shit or go blind.

354
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,180
- 中尉 你认为怎样？  - 你好吗 里德？
- What do you say, L.T.?  - How you doing, Red?

355
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,450
不好 他拿了所有的好牌
Not good. This cocksucker has every card in the deck.

356
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,950
呼鲁
Full house.

357
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,850
你还不错
You're doing all right.

358
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,660
对 我还没开始作弊呢
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

359
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:45,730
- 中尉 要喝酒吗？ - 谢谢
- Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage? - Oh, thanks, Andy.

360
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,320
中尉 你想玩吗？
Play, lieutenant?

361
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,470
不 我不想被你们强奸
No. Wouldn't want to get raped by you guys.

362
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,640
为什么？你留着为了谁？
Why's that, lieutenant? What are you saving up to be?

363
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,870
犹太人？
Jewish?

364
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,010
我要走了
I gotta run.

365
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,080
稍后再见 你们玩得高兴点
I'll catch you men later. Enjoy yourselves tonight.

366
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,400
他真是一个混蛋
That is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

367
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,190
你认为呢？鲍布？ 他能挨过这场仗吗？
What do you say there, Bob? A guy like that make it? Yes or no?

368
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,430
我也是那样想
I have to say that's precisely what I saw.

369
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,110
我只用看一看他就知道了
Sometimes I just look at a guy, and I know he's not going to make it.

370
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,200
他一定不行
Just no fucking way.

371
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,610
1968年 元旦

A lot of little firefights, ambushes,

我们投下炸弹后 像鬼魅般穿越丛林
We drop bombs, then we walk through the jungle like ghosts in a landscape,

376
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,310

00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,800
我们需要增援
This...  We need help, sir. ASAP.

403
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,440
立即离开这里 一轮搏斗你们就完蛋
Move your ass out of here! One round to get you all!

404
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,770
罗德里 乔利亚 快点
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

405
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,090
中尉
Lieutenant.

406
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,780
告诉总部我们需要工程师 这里到处是陷阱
Tell 6 we need engineers. This pos is full of traps.

407
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,050
他们快来了
They're coming.

408
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,260
下面的村庄有北越军的踪影
NVA were seen at a village half a klick down the river.

409
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,290
六队说我们要立即赶去
Now, 6 says to get there ASAP.

410
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,790
留下四个手下和军医
Also, leave four of your men here and a medic.

411
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,260
- 好 - 快点
- All right. - Move it out.

412
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,720
召集所有士兵 快点!
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

413
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,320
曼尼在哪里？
Hey, where's Manny?

414
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,870
曼尼 你在哪里？
Manny, where you at?

415
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,170
我们要在入黑前到达村庄
We had to reach the village before dark,

416
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,210
伊利亚等人继续找寻 和等候工程师
We left Elias and some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers,

417
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,000
但最后金找到他
But it was King who found him...

418
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,780
他在下游一千码那里
...about 1000 yards downriver, not far from the village,

419
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,380
谜团被解开了
It was the end of the mystery,

420
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,310
混蛋
The motherfuckers.

421
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:26,160
那个千年村的村民不知道我们会来
The village, which was maybe 1000 years old, didn't know we were coming,

422
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,370
否则他们早就逃走
If they had, they would have run,

423
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,870
巴恩是众矢之的 阿合上尉会经过他
Barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him, our Captain Ahab...

424
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,900
改善事情
...who would set things right again,

425
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,400
那一天我们都很敬爱他
That day, we loved him,

426
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,340
他在那里
There he goes, sarge.

427
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,690
- 把他捡起来 - 好
- Pick him up. - Yeah, you got it, sarge.

428
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:56,890
快来
Let's go.

429
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,940
不要那样望着我
Get that stupid look off your face!

430
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,760
奥尼尔 清除房子
O'Neill, clear out these hooches.

431
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,440
小猪…
Hey, piggy- piggy. Hey, pig.

432
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,080
宾尼 你要烧掉房子
Bunny, you've got to bring the hooches down.

433
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,580
去右边 小心 出发!
Spread out on the right. Watch your back. Let's go!

434
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,710
这里有什么？
What do you got here, huh?

435
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,460
去那边 快!
Get over there! Move it!

436
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,260
来吧 快点!
Come on, let's go!

437
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,460
乔利亚 集合他们
Let's go, Junior, bring them in.

438
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,600
出来 混球! 行动!
Get out of there, you fuckheads! Move!

439
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,450
来吧
Come on!

440
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,830
- 把他们赶进猪栏去 - 过来
- Put them in the pigpen! - Get over here.

441
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,400
回去! 住口!
Get back! Shut up!

442
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,430
给我手榴弹
Give me your willie pete.

443
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,500
退后
Get back!

444
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,840
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

445
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,020
住口
Shut up!

446
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,190
赶他们出来
Get them out of here!

447
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,630
妈的! 这里有一个
Oh, fuck! We got one.

448
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,490
赶他出来
Get the fuck out of the hole!

449
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,240
出来 混蛋
Get out of there. Come on, motherfucker!

450
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,700
冷静下来 他们很害怕
Be cool! Be cool! They're scared, man!

451
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,670
他们害怕？我又怎样？
Oh, they're scared, huh? What about me, man?

452
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,640
我厌倦这样 快出来 混球 快!
I'm sick of this fucking shit! Come on, motherfucker, move!

453
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,710
看看这混球
Watch this fucker!

454
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:59,610
他们认为我们为谁而战？
Who the fuck do they think we're fighting for?

455
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,220
- 还有一个 - 你…
- You got one more! - Hey, hey!

456
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,090
有什么发现？
Well, what have we here?

457
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:17,600
我们有一 二 三 四支机关枪 捷克制米克58机关枪
They have one, two, three, four Mag 58 Czechoslovakian machine guns.

458
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,700
他们有二、四…
They got two, four....

459
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,380
他们有足够米粮供应一队军队
Barnes, they got enough rice here to feed a whole fucking regiment.

460
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:31,010
华伦 带村长来
Sergeant Warren, you bring the honcho over here.

461
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,290
特斯 出来 乔利亚 烧掉房子
Tubbs, get out of there! Junior, burn it!

462
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,750
怎么了？我不会伤害你
What the fuck's the matter? I wasn't gonna hurt you!

463
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,680
我看来想伤害你吗？
Look like I was gonna hurt you?

464
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,120
你为什么不听我说？你他妈的为什么不听我说？
Why didn't you listen to me?! Why didn't you fucking listen to me?!

465
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,890
你这个笨蛋! 你这个王八!
Fucking stupid?! You stupid asshole!

466
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,030
他妈的过来! 到这里! 混球!
Get the fuck up here! Come here, motherfucker!

467
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:54,070
你在笑什么？ 你为什么不听我说？
What are you smiling at?! Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?!

468
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,360
杀死他们
Do them, man!

469
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,380
你在笑什么？ 想有点可笑的东西？
What are you smiling at?! You want something to smile at, huh?!

470
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,180
- 想有点可笑的东西？ - 对
- You want something to smile at?! - That's right!

471
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,010
- 混蛋 跳舞吧   - 对
- Dance, motherfucker!  - Yeah!

472
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,380
跛子 跳舞吧
Dance, one-legger!

473
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,920
跳舞…
Dance! Dance!

474
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,420
跳舞 跛子
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

475
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,940
来吧
Come on. Come on, let's go, man.

476
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:34,370
他妈的! 他在嘲笑你
Fucking pussy, man! He's laughing at you!

477
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,180
越南人是那样笑的
That's the way the gook laughs.

478
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,050
当然了
Yeah, sure you are!

479
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,350
你很后悔吧？
You're real sorry, ain't you?

480
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:45,720
你为曼尼他们的死感到内疚吧？
You're just crying your little hearts out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

481
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,790
宾尼 算了吧？我们走!
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

482
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,690
你说呢？
What do you say?

483
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:15,250
妈的! 你看到他的头颅是怎样爆开的吗？
Holy shit! You see that fucking head come apart, man?

484
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:19,080
我从来没见过那样的脑袋
I never seen brains like that before, man.

485
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,600
我打赌一定是她指挥一切的
I bet you the old bitch runs the whole fucking show.

486
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:30,130
大概是她割开曼尼的喉咙 她一定也想把我的睾丸割掉
She probably cut Manny's throat. Probably cut my balls off if she could.

487
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,600
宾尼 离开吧 没有人看到什么
Bunny, we leave now, nobody saw a thing!

488
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,430
泰勒 你明白吗？
You understand, Taylor?

489
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,100
杀死她吧 杀死整条村的人
Come on, let's fucking do her! Let's do the whole fucking village!

490
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:43,280
这个越南人头目脸上有些疤痕
There's scars on this gook honcho, sarge.

491
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,780
特斯 出来
Get out of here, Tubbs.

492
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,220
他从哪里弄到伤痕？
Where did he get these wounds?

493
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,340
- 他说他在轰炸中受伤 - 他一定是北越的人
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid. - He's a dink for sure.

494
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,100
问他这里为什么会有武器
Ask him why these weapons are here.

495
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,350
他们没有选择 北越杀了抗命的老头目
They had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.

496
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:22,250
- 他说那些米是属于他们 - 莱纳 胡说
- He says all the rice is theirs. - Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

497
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,580
我们在河边杀死的越军是谁？
Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?

498
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,100
他不知道 北越军几个月没来过
He doesn't know. The NVA ain't been here in a couple of months.

499
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,340
- 或许他是哨兵   - 当然了
- Maybe he was a scout.   - Yeah, sure. A scout.

500
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,770
那些米和武器是给谁的？
What about the rice and the weapons?! Who they for?!

501
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,230
北越军
An NVC!

502
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,210
他知道我在说什么吧？
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying. Don't you?

503
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:50,680
他一定知道
Goddamn right he does.

504
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,920
他在说谎
He's lying!

505
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,950
杀死他 看谁会说真话
Waste the fucker! Then see who talks.

506
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,520
他说他什么都不知道
Look, he says he doesn't know anything.

507
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,460
他讨厌北越 但他们擅自来这里
He hates the NVA, but they come when they want and take over.

508
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,060
她在说什么？
What's the bitch saying?

509
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,400
她问我们为什么要杀死猪
She's going on about why we killed the pigs...

510
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,400
他们是农夫 要养活自己
...they're farmers, they have to make a living....

511
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,610
住口
Shut up!

512
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,950
叫她住口
Shut her the fuck up!

513
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,810
你叫他快点说 否则我会杀死更多人
You tell him to start talking or I'll waste more of them.

514
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,950
莱纳 告诉他
Tell him, Lerner!

515
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,420
让我们大开杀戒
Let us in on this, all right?

516
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,730
我们杀死整条村吧
Let's go for it! Let's do the whole fucking village!

517
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,060
中士 我们还在等什么？
Come on, sarge. What the fuck are we waiting for?

518
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,600
- 杀死他们 - 走开
- Let's do them! - Out of my way!

519
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,250
这是他的女儿吧？
This is his daughter, right? Right?

520
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,450
你说谎! 不 你说谎!  你这个越共!
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

521
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,330
巴恩
Barnes!

522
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,040
你他妈的在做什么？
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

523
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,350
别管闲事 这和你无关
Stay out of this. It ain't your show.

524
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:12,720
你不是火枪队 猪哥!
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

525
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,790
- 打倒他 - 巴恩 加油
- Get him! - Come on, Barnes!

526
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,290
打倒他! … 打烂他的头!
Get him! Get him! Tear his fucking head off!

527
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,770
伊利亚 杀死他
Come on, Elias. Send him to hell!

528
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,070
妈的! 别这样! 停手!
Goddamn it! Come on, break it up!

529
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:38,940
停手
Break it up!

530
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,880
停手
Break it up!

531
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,460
伊利亚 冷静点
Elias, chill.

532
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,730
伊利亚 你死定了 我发誓 你死定了
You're dead, Elias! I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

533
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,120
你会坐牢的
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

534
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,270
这件事不会就此罢休的 混蛋
This shit won't wash, you puke!

停手! …住口!
Break it up! Break it up! Shut up!

536
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,770
停手 留心听着
Break it up! Listen up!

537
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,840
上尉说烧掉这里 听到了吗？
Captain says to torch this place, hear that?

538
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,480
烧掉这里
Torch this place!

539
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,110
烧掉武器
Blow the weapons in place!

540
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,450
集合他们 我们时间不多
Round up suspected VC and shake it up! We ain't got much light left!

541
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,880
中尉 你为什么不作出行动？
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?

542
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,780
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

543
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,530
你知道我在说什么
You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

544
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:26,090
不 我不知道 我不知道你他妈的在说什么
No, I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.

545
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:33,500
快点出发! 快! 听到命令了吧!
Move it out! Let's go! You heard the lieutenant!

546
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:38,040
泰勒 走了 妈的!  烧掉武器 然后离开
Taylor, let's go, for chrissake! Police up the weapons and let's go!

547
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,570
哈洛 来吧
Come on, Harold.

548
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,010
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

549
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,960
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

550
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:15,270

妈的! 滚开
You fucker! Get out of here!

552
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,910
滚开! …不要那样做
Get the fuck off! Don't do it! Don't do it!

553
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:25,340
混蛋 这是什么一回事？
You fucker! What is this, huh?!

554
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,910
你是同志吗？
You a homosexual?

555
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:33,690
你怎么了？她是越南人
What's your problem? She's a fucking dink.

556
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:37,690
她是人类! 去你的!
She's a fucking human being, man! Fuck you!

557
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,060
泰勒 你这个可恶的新兵
Total fucking cherry, Taylor!

558
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,860
妈的禽兽! 你们全部都是禽兽!
Fucking animal! All of you! You're fucking animals!

559
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,040
混蛋
Fucking lame fuck!

560
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,970
你不属于越南 这里不适合你
You don't belong in the Nam. This ain't your place.

561
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:51,500
你们一点都不明白吧？
You don't fucking get it, do you?

562
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,710
你们不明白
You just don't fucking get it.

563
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,110
没事的
It's okay.

564
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,850
离开吧
Get out of there!

565
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,050
出发吧
Police up your dicks and let's go.

566
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,180
- 我什么都看不见   - 我看到
- I didn't see anything, sir.   - I did.

567
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,990
巴恩中士说那个是北越兵
Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.

568
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,950
我的报告中 沃夫上尉是目击证人
My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

569
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:16,730
伊利亚 好
All right, Elias.

570
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:20,030
- 巴恩中士 - 是
- Staff Sergeant Barnes. - Sir!

571
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:23,360
我们回到总部后 我要详细报告
I want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

572
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,730
你有日志 我有很多目击证人
You got a diary. I have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

573
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,310
不是现在
Not now, goddamn it! Not now!

574
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,640
我们回到总部才调查这件事
We'll get into this at the base camp.

575
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:37,250
我保证如果发现非法杀戮…
I can promise you, if I find out there was an illegal killing...

576
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,250
一定会有军事法庭
...there will be a court-martial.

577
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,720
现在我要全军作战 你们别再吵
Right now, I need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

578
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:48,120
巴恩和伊利亚中士 听到吗？
Staff Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Elias. You hear me?

579
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,360
- 是    - 知道
- Yes, sir.    - Yes, sir.

580
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,860
明天你们从东面再去那越共地堡
We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

581
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,800
你们休息一下  晚上七点钟回来开会
You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 19:00 for a briefing.

582
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,330
- 是     - 是
- Yes, sir.    - Yes, sir.

583
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:10,180
你认为他们会在乎我们吗？
Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

584
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,550
哈洛 也许会是你阻碍了巴恩
It could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

585
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:15,920
那个宾尼呢？
And that Bunny?

586
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,460
他是疯的
That motherfucker's crazy.

587
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,220
他令我不寒而栗
I mean, he scares me.

588
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,560
他很可怕
He just scares me.

589
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,960
你已经受牵连
You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

590
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,120
这些越南人比你想像中聪明
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.

591
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,400
巴恩知道他在做什么
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

592
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,500
他们是北越兵
They was NVA, every last of them.

593
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,210
他带领我们走到这里了 他会带领我们走完这场战争
He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.

594
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:39,480
我不知道
I don't know, Holmes.

595
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,710
基督教徒不会到处杀人
A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

596
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,820
情况失去控制了 完全失控了
This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

597
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,090
看来你不知道怎样分别…
Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

598
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,760
事情的轻重
...the way you always shoot up that shit.

599
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,230
我不知道…
I don't know, brothers...

600
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,290
但我内心大受伤害
...but I'm hurting real bad inside.

601
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,100
别担心 伊利亚不能证明什么
Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

602
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:07,370
他是个麻烦制造者
He's a troublemaker.

603
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:11,270
伊利亚像华盛顿的政客…
Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

604
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:15,240
想独力打这场仗
...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

605
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,580
这里没有时间进行审讯
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

606
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,850
- 中士     - 谢谢你
- Sarge.      - Thanks, Bun.

607
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,290
情况怎样？
How did it go there, Bob?

608
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,650
那个可恶的伊利亚
Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

609
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,970
他是个卑鄙小人
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

610
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,130
他会连累这个连的所有人
He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

611
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,700
有人要教训他
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

612
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:43,540
你认为呢？ 会有调查吗？
So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

613
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:46,080
鲍布？
Bob?

614
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:51,380
你太担心了 中士会解决他
O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

615
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:59,260
今晚天色很美
It's a beautiful night.

616
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:02,530
我喜欢这里的夜晚
Yeah, I love this place at night.

617
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,330
繁星…
The stars....

618
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,040
它们没有对与错 它们就是在那里
There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

619
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,840
你的比喻很好
That's a nice way of putting it.

620
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,500
巴恩憎恨你吧？
Barnes has it in for you, huh?

621
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,710
巴恩相信他所做的一切
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

622
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,520
你呢？你相信吗？
And you? Do you believe?

623
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,380
1965年时吗？我会相信
ln '65? Yeah.

624
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,490
现在呢？
Now?

625
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,290
不相信
No.

626
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,370
今天所发生的事只是开始
What happened today is just the beginning.

627
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,700
我们会输掉这场仗
We're gonna lose this war.

628
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,010
不会吧
Come on.

629
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,910
你真的认为我们会输？
You really think so? Us?

630
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,580
我们欺负别人太久了
We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...

631
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,150
现在轮到我们被打击
...I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

632
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,200
我每天都在挣扎
Day by day, I struggle to maintain...

633
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,090
我努力维持体力和意志
...not only my strength, but my sanity,

634
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,000
一切都很模糊
It's all a blur,

635
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:21,210
我没有气力写信
I have no energy to write,

636
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,110
我不能分辨对与错
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore,

637
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:28,240
我们的士气低落 出现内讧
The morale of the men is low, A civil war in the platoon,

638
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:31,050
一半支持伊利亚 一半支持巴恩
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes,

639
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:34,080
有很多猜忌和憎恨
There's a lot of suspicion and hate,

640
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:38,150
我们竟然在自伤残杀
I can't believe we're fighting each other instead of them,

641
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:44,890
数着日子和留意着周遭 没别的
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face, Not much else,

642
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:47,530
祖母 希望你一切安好
Hope things are well, Grandma,

643
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,700
告诉妈妈和爸爸…
Tell Mom and Dad I...

644
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:53,500
你知道告诉他们什么的 柯里斯上
Well, just tell them, Chris,

645
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:19,430
我知道你以为会被派去洗衣服
Hey, big boy. I know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out.

646
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,130
我要把自己涂白 才能得到那些工作
Hell, I gotta paint myself white just to get one of those jobs.

647
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:27,430
我递了申请去割包皮 我要离开
Got my request in for a circumcision. I'm getting my big ass out of here.

648
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,710
你会成为犹太教教士吗？
What are you gonna do, become a rabbi?

649
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,030
水蛭
Leech.

650
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,080
继续走
All right! Move it out!

651
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,280
不要喝 你会得痢疾
Don't drink that, asshole. You're gonna get malaria.

652
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,120
我希望会
Yeah, I hope so.

653
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:48,290
去吧
Let's go.

654
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:28,830
军医 莱纳被击中
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

655
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:36,670
中士 华伦被击中

It's an ambush! They were just waiting for us here!

658
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,220
- 谁负责防守？    - 莱纳和华伦
- Who's on point?     - Lerner and Warren.

659
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,040
你去哪里？
Where are you going?!

660
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,690
天啊! 混球! 派火力上前
Goddamn it, you assholes! Get some firepower up there!

661
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:57,890
对

662
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,170
小心 火箭炮
Watch out! Rockets!

663
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,210
莱纳在哪里？
Where the fuck is Lerner?

664
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:22,080
他在木头那边
He's over there! By the log!

01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:59,520
中尉 他们会步步进逼
Lieutenant, they'll get in tight under the arty!

669
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:03,990
我看到缺口 让我带人去那边
I saw a cut. Let me take some men and roll up that flank.

若越军进入这些洞 我们就要交锋
Dinks get in these holes, we'll be in a crossfire.

675
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,980
- 我们会互相开火    - 听来很不寻常
- We'll shoot each other.    - Sounds far- out to me.

676
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:31,390
我在1966年的战役里见过
I've seen it happen. la Drang in '66.

677

我不想在外面孤军作战
I don't want to be stuck out there with my ass hanging in the breeze.

681
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,400
伊利亚 不要教我怎样打仗
You don't tell me how to run my war, Elias.

682
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:50,040
你去呼喝你的手下好了
You go crying to fucking brigade on your own time.

705
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:33,740

706
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,170
军医 照顾他

你这个自大混蛋
You ignorant asshole!

710

你给他们什么座标？
What the fuck coordinates are you giving?

711
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:54,890
你的座标已经令很多人受伤
You wasted a lot of people up there with your fucked- up fire mission!

712
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,590
你知道吗？
Do you know that?

713
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,660
你知道吗？妈的!
Do you know that? Ah, shit!

炮手 这是B2
Redleg! Redleg! Ripper Bravo 2.

715
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:09,440
停火…
Check your fire! Check your fire!

716
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:20,650
他们来了

他们会从那里过来
They'll be coming from over there.

719
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:34,960
只要被他们攻破 我们便死定了
Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.

720
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,990
你去哪里？
Where the hell are you going?

721
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,760
到下游大约一百米处…
Down by the river about 100 meters...

722
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:42,560
以防他们准备从外围进攻
...in case they try to flank us.

723
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:45,500
第三连正在后面赶来
3rd Platoon is coming behind us. Watch for them.

724
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:47,540
我可以和你一起去吗？
Hey. Can I go with you?

725
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,380
不 我单独行事较敏捷
No. I move faster alone.

726
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:02,390
让炮兵队来处理
Let's let arty do a bit of the work.

727
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,560
叫所有人去教堂…

...and link up with 3rd Platoon. You got that?

729
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,670
伊利亚怎样？他会孤立无援
What about Elias? If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

730
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:15,910
中尉 你也快去
You just haul ass too, lieutenant.

731
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,100

Kiss my ass. Man, I never thought I'd get hit.

738
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:17,700
你击中两个混蛋
A lung, babe. You got two of them fuckers.

739
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,930
伊利亚在哪里？一班越兵刚经过
Where's Elias? A bunch of gooks came through here.

749
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,580
泰勒 你去哪里？
Taylor, where are you going?

750
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,380
伊利亚死了
Elias is dead.

751
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,720
和他们一起撤退
Fall back with the platoon.

01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,480
他死了？
He's dead?

754
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:05,560
对 他在一百米外
Yeah, he's back there about 100 meters.

755

你看到他吗？哪里？
You saw him? Where?

756

Oh, fuck!

761

他们抓到伊利亚
They've got Elias!

762
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:29,910
什么？
What?

763
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:38,810
退后…

停火…
Hold your arms, Guns, hold off,

766
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,380
他杀死他

767
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:20,120
我知道是他 我看到他的眼神
I know he did. I saw his eyes when he came in.

768
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:23,990
你怎知不是越兵？你没有证据
How do you know the dinks didn't get him? You got no proof.

769
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:26,630
证据就在他的眼神 我看得出
Proof's in the eyes. When you know, you know.

770
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,020
你也看见 我知道你在想什么
You saw. I know what you were thinking.

771
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:30,890
我们今天解决他
I say we frag him tonight.

772
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:33,200
我赞成 以牙还牙
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

773
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,300
让军事法庭处理吧
I say let military justice do the job on him.

774
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:41,170
去他的军事法庭!  你在说笑吗？
Come on, fuck the military justice! Are you joking me?

775
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:45,500
他们会相信谁？奥尼尔？宾尼？ 全是胡说!
Whose story you think they'll believe? O'NeilI's? Bunny's? Bullshit!

776
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:49,910
巴恩不会放过你的
You try that, Barnes will shove it back up your ass, with a candle on it.

777
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,910
你认为我们应怎做？
What do you suggest we do?

778
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:57,250
你们小心  巴恩会一个个地解决他们
Watch your own asses. Barnes will be coming down on all of them.

779
01:21:57,590 --> 01:22:00,760
你们忘记和伊利亚的美好日子吗？
You gonna forget about Elias? All the good times we had here?

780
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:04,660
你想把头砍下来治头痛？
Shit, you trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.

781
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,340
伊利亚没有叫你为他打仗
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him.

782
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:12,830
如果真的有天堂 天啊 我希望真的有
And if there's a heaven, and God, I hope there is...

783
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:17,840
他会在上面喝到大醉
...he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit...

784
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,820
因为他把痛苦留在这里
...because he left his pains down here.

785
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:24,380
你错了 总之巴恩是杀人凶手
You're wrong! Anyway you cut it, Barnes is a murderer!

786
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,660
- 对 - 泰勒…
- Right on. - Taylor...

787
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:32,190
你当初入伍时说很欣赏巴恩
...when you first came in here, you told me how you admired the bastard.

788
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:36,730
- 我错了 - 你做任何事都是错的
- I was wrong. - You've never been right about nothing!

789
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:40,230
你们这班混蛋 留心听着
Dig this, you assholes, and dig it good.

790
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,470
巴恩中枪七次都没有死去
Barnes been shot seven times, and he ain't dead.

791
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:46,670
那对你有意思吗？
Does that mean anything to you?

792
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,410
巴恩是不会死的
Barnes ain't meant to die.

793
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:54,220
唯一能杀死他的是他自己
The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.

794
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:56,650
你们在谈死亡吗？
Talking about killing?

795
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:10,830
你们是专家吗？
You all experts?

796
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,000
你们都知道杀戮吗？
You all know about killing?

797
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:18,910
我想听听 猪头
Well, I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

798
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,270
你们抽这个来逃避现实？
You smoke this shit to escape from reality?

799
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,050
我不需要这个
Me, I don't need this shit.

800
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,490
我就是现实
I am reality.

801
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:52,500
现实应该是这样 而现实就是这样
There's the way it ought to be, and there's the way it is.

802
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,300
伊利亚满口一派胡言
Elias was full of shit.

803
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,210
伊利亚是个斗士
Elias was a crusader.

804
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:07,820
我不会跟听从命令的人作对
Now, I got no fight with any man who does what he's told.

805
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:09,820
但当他不听命时…
But when he don't...

806
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,890
运作便会崩溃
...the machine breaks down.

807
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:17,030
运作崩溃时 我们就会崩溃
And when the machine breaks down, we break down.

808
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:20,200
我不会许容那样的事
I ain't going to allow that.

809
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,170
你们任何一个都不能
From any of you.

810
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:24,870
一个都不可以
Not one.

811
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:43,450
你们都爱伊利亚
You all love Elias.

812
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,960
你们想为他报仇
You want to kick ass.

813
01:24:56,910 --> 01:25:00,210
我独个儿在这里
Well, here I am. All by my lonesome.

814
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:05,140
没有人会知道
And ain't nobody gonna know.

815
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:13,320
你们六个对我一个
Six of you boys against me.

816
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:20,920
杀我吧
Kill me.

817
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,980
我卑视你们
I shit on all of you.

818
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:45,790
混蛋
You motherfucker!

819
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:53,220
打吧
Come on, man.

820
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:55,460
柯里斯 打他
Get him, Chris.

821
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:02,130
巴恩 不要下手
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man!

822
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:04,700
你要坐牢的
You'll go dinky dau in LBJ, man.

823
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:08,010
杀军人要坐十年牢 十年
Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years.

824
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:10,070
你想想吧
Climb the fucking walls, man.

825
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,150
不要下手
Don't do it.

826
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,660
死亡？
Death?

827
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,800
你们对死亡有什么认识？
What do you all know about death?

828
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:54,360
我们翌日被派回到山谷里
They sent us baCk into the valley the next day...

829
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:58,420
进入离柬埔寨约二千米的战区
...about 2000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter,

830
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,590
我们好像回到案发现场
It felt like we were returning to the sCene of a Crime,

831
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:39,720
A连在前一天被重击
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable forCe,

832
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:42,330
C连在那一天被袭击
Charlie Company had been probed that night,

833
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,670
山谷里有其他战事…
There were other battalions in the valley...

834
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:48,880
但我们是引他们出来的饵
...but we knew we were the bait to lure them out,

835
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:53,770
141北越军就在下面某处
Somewhere out there was the entire 141st NVA regiment,

836
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:15,700
他们昨晚想袭击C连
Caught them trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.

837
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:18,040
他们发现地图
They found maps on them, man.

838
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:23,080
听说每个散兵坑都有地雷
Got a friend at Battalion, says they had every foxhole here fixed on.

839
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:27,820
知道我方的距离、林木线和地雷
Distances, tree lines, our claymores, everything.

840
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:29,710
情况不妙
This is bad, man.

841
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:34,480
- 我有不祥之兆   - 听说我们身在柬埔寨
- I got bad vibes here.   - I also heard we're in Cambodia now.

842
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:37,380
柬埔寨？你在开玩笑
Cambodia? Man, you're kidding me.

843
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:39,860
你想见我？
You wanted to see me, sir?

844
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:44,830
拉姆治 伊利亚小组归你
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

845
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:49,040
小组？我不知道我的连叫小组
Squad? I didn't know we were still referring to this platoon as squads.

846
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:53,710
我要你去那两个坑
I want you to take those two holes, right there and there.

847
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:56,810
跟在上面的巴恩 和在下面的金联络
Tie it off with Barnes up here and King down there.

848
01:28:58,450 --> 01:29:00,140
长官 对不起…
Begging your pardon, sir...

849
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:04,120
那两个坑距离太远 一个连队可以从中通过
...my two holes are so far apart, a regiment could run between them.

850
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:06,010
我只有五个军人活着
I have five live bodies left.

851
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:09,880
我不想听你的问题 新兵很快到
I don't want to hear your problems. You'll get new men any day.

852
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:11,850
你要和别人一样作战
Make do like everybody else.

853
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,630
- 我没有要求这个   - 我不想再听
- I didn't ask for this.  - I don't want to hear it.

854
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,160
- 你不想再听？   - 对
- You don't want to hear it? - That's right.

855
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:20,800
因为老实说我毫不在乎
Because, to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.

856
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,830
我不再在乎
I just don't give a flying fuck anymore.

857
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:33,450
我很高兴我不用和他们一起去
I'm glad I ain't going with them.

858
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,820
外面有一头饥饿的野兽
Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.

859
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:41,290
真失败
What a fucking bummer.

860
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:45,860
只剩十天了 我仍要面对这一切
Ten days and a wake- up, and I'm still dealing with this shit.

861
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:51,020
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

862
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,560
你为什么不写信？
Why ain't you writing nobody?

863
01:29:54,370 --> 01:29:55,860
你的父母呢？
What about your folks?

864
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:58,760
你向我提起的祖母怎样？
That grandma you told me about?

865
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:02,340
女朋友？
Girl?

866
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:06,710
你有父母吧？
You got parents, don't you?

867
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:08,870
一定有些亲密的人
There must be somebody.

868
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:11,820
没有
No, there's nobody.

869
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,890
你抽太多了
You been smoking too much of this shit.

870
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:20,760
你要控制一下 令人颓丧
Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

871
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,670
我记得你初来时什么都不懂
I remember when you first come out here to the bush, you's green as...

872
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,290
你可曾被无法 摆脱的错误缠绕着？
You ever get caught in a mistake you just can't get out of?

873
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:33,240
总有方法解决的
There's a way out of anything.

874
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:36,980
只要你振作精神
Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry...

875
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:39,210
一定有方法的
...and the worm will turn.

876
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,710
你还有多少天？
How many days you short?

877
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:48,550
不只是我 而是整个事情
It's not just me. It's how the whole thing works.

878
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,520
像伊利亚般的人要牺牲
People like Elias get wasted.

879
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:54,560
巴恩那种人却能继续为所欲为
People like Barnes go on making up all the rules any way they want.

880
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:58,590
我们只能逆来顺受吗？
So, what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it.

881
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:01,830
我们不用理会那些事情
We just don't add up to dry shit.

882
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:06,930
谁说你需要的？ 你只需要活着离开这里
Whoever said we did? All you got to do is make it out of here...

883
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:11,580
然后每天快乐地生活
...and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life. Gravy.

884
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:16,940
你是理想主义者
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

885
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:21,210
收拾你的行装 你的命令刚下达
Collect up your shit. Your orders just come through.

886
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,850
不要骗我
Man, don't fuck with me.

887
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:25,790
你要邀请信吗？
Oh, what do you need, a written invitation?

888
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:30,690
天啊! 他们做错事
Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers done made a mistake!

889
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:32,500
他们竟然饶我一命
They cut me some slack!

890
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,500
你有十分钟时间赶去搭直升机
You got 10 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here.

891
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:38,430
因为如果你不上机…
Because if you're not on it...

892
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:40,310
我便会去
...I'm gonna be.

893
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,410
泰勒 法兰西准备好了
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

894
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,410
太好了 金 我为你感到高兴 回家吧!
That's great, King, I'm happy for you. Take it on home for me.

895
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:50,950
你有我的地址 你知道怎么联络我
You got my address. You know where to reach me anytime.

896
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:54,010
我要走了 我不想错过直升机
I gotta di di, Don't want to miss that chopper.

897
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:00,660
- 你没事吧？   - 我没事
- You okay?     - Yeah, I'm okay.

898
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:02,720
记住放松点
Remember, take it easy.

899
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:05,670
不要想太多 别做傻瓜
Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool.

900
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:09,630
记住这里没有人是懦夫
Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here.

901
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,670
我的朋友
My man.

902
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:20,820
我送你出去
I'll walk you out, man.

903
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,310
金 保重
Take it easy, King.

904
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:30,120
- 我会的     - 再见
- I'll take it any way I can get it. - I hear you. Later.

905
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:34,290
很痛 中士 不要碰它
I'm pretty fucked up, sarge. Don't touch it!

906
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:36,800
我一定要上直升机
I gotta get on the chopper, man.

907
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:39,630
- 有什么问题？   - 他说不能走路
- So, what's the problem? - Says he can't walk.

908
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,100
可恶
Shit.

909
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:44,240
马丁…
Martin...

910
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:46,370
穿上靴子
...get your boots on.

911
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:53,810
下次给我见到你喷防蚊水…
And the next time I catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your feet...

912
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:56,550
我会送你上军事法庭
...I'll court- martial your nigger ass.

913
01:32:57,650 --> 01:32:59,640
送我去吧
Then court- martial me, motherfucker!

914
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:02,920
逮捕我啊! 送我去坐牢吧
Bust my ass! Send me to fucking Long Binh!

915
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:04,450
下手吧
Do your fucking worst!

916
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:08,200
你们白人欺负我
You white folks got your last klick out of Junior!

917
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:11,600
奥尼尔 把蜈蚣拿来
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

918
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,800
- 中士？    - 是
- Sarge?     - Yeah.

919
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:18,840
我找到那毛茸茸、红黑色的虫
That long, hairy, red and black bastard I found in the ammo crate.

920
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:22,580
我会把它放进他的伤口
I'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch.

921
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:23,840
我记得了
I remember now.

922
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,180
等一下
Hold up, man!

923
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,250
等一下好吗？
You just hold up and wait, okay?

924
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:32,110
我会走路了
Fuck it, I'll walk! I'll fucking walk!

925
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:35,050
我要和他同一个坑？
Fucking pussy! Sarge, I gotta have him in my hole?

926
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:36,550
对
Yeah.

927
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,520
我可以和你谈谈吗？
Bob, I'd like to speak to you a minute.

928
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:45,960
我不能再忍受了
I can't take it no more.

929
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,010
什么事？
Yeah, what is it?

930
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:54,470
我有伊利亚的假期 有三天
Bob, I got Elias' R and R. It's coming up in three days.

931
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:57,470
我想回去夏威夷见柏丝
I was thinking about going to Hawaii and see Patsy.

932
01:33:58,050 --> 01:34:00,140
我从没向你要求过任何事
I never asked you for a thing over here.

933
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,450
坦白说…
Well, to be honest with you...

934
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:06,280
我想和金一起坐直升机回去 你觉得呢？
...I was hoping you'd put me on a chopper with King. What do you say?

935
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,180
我不能让你那样做
I can't do that for you.

936
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:11,150
你知道这里很需要人手
You know we need every swinging dick in the field.

937
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:14,860
你可以跟我说 我只是请三天假
You can talk to me, for chrissake! I'm just asking for three days.

938
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,720
我告诉你不可以
I am talking to you, Red. And I'm telling you no.

939
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:20,600
回到散兵坑
Get back in your foxhole.

940
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,630
我有不祥之兆 知道吗？
Bob, I've got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

941
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,400
我今次有不祥之兆
I mean I've got a bad feeling.

942
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:30,480
我觉得我不能活着离开这里
I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.

943
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:32,680
你明白吗？
You understand what I'm saying?

944
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:36,510
每个人都会死的
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

945
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:45,220
可恶
Oh, shit!

946
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:03,110
混蛋们 再见
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

947
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:17,380
埋伏在哪里？
Where's that fucking ambush?

948
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:22,390
他们不会等 他们现在就来了

You know, Junior? Some of the things we done, man...

951
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:35,840
我不觉得我们在做错事
...I don't feel like we done something wrong.

952
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:38,170
但有时…
But sometimes, man...

953
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:42,180
我有不祥的感觉
...I get this bad feeling.

954
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:47,550
我坦然对随军牧师说我喜欢这里
I told the padre the truth. I like it here.

955
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:50,650
你可以为所欲为 没有人理会你
You get to do what you want, nobody fucks with you.

956
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,360
你只用担心死亡
The only worry you got is dying.

957
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:56,060
反正死的时候你不会知道
And if that happens, you won't know about it...

958
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,260
那么担心什么？
...so, what the fuck, man?

959
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:02,070
我要和你同一个坑？
Shit. I got to be in this hole with you, man?

960
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,300
我早知道我不应该来
I just know I shouldn't have come.

961
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:11,070
不用担心 你和爱迪墨菲在一起
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging with Audie Murphy here.

是
Yes, sir.

1066
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:07,660
- 准备好了吗？   - 好了
- Ready?    - You bet.

1067
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,380
现在回想一切…
I think now, looking back...

1068
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:44,590
我们不是对抗敌人 而是自己
...we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves...

1069
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:47,190
敌人就在我们心中
...and the enemy was in us,

1070
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,520
战争对我来说现在已经完结
The war is over for me now...

1071
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:55,670
但它永远会存留在我的心中
...but it will always be there the rest of my days,

1072
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,100
伊利亚会和巴恩…
As I'm sure Elias will be...

1073
01:54:58,610 --> 01:55:01,940
为了像罗德所说的"灵魂的掌控"继续作战
...fighting with Barnes for, what Rhah Called, possession of my soul,

1074
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:05,910
我有时会觉得…
There are times sinCe...

1075
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:10,310
我是那两个父亲的儿子
...I have felt like the Child born of those two fathers,

1076
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:14,720
但无论如何…
But be that as it may...

1077
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:19,020
我们有责任重建社会…
...those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again,

1078
01:55:19,790 --> 01:55:21,920
教导别人我们认识的一切…
To teaCh to others what we know...

1079
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:25,930
我们利用剩下的一生…
...and to try with what's left of our lives...

1080
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:30,000
尝试找寻生命的意义
...to find a goodness and meaning to this life,

1081
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:46,750
献给在越战牺牲的士兵
