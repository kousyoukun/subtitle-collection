1
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,160
Johnson!

2
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,530
Yes, sir!

3
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,040
- Honeycutt!
- Here!

4
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,910
- Melvin!
- Here.

5
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,460
Oh, man. Is that what I think it is?

6
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,680
All right, you cheese dicks,
welcome to the Nam. Follow me!

7
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,550
I'll be dipped in shit!

8
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,600
New meat!
You dudes gonna love the Nam.

9
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,180
For fucking ever.

10
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,270
365 and a wake-up.

11
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,690
Oh, Lord!

12
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,670
Xin loi, buddy.

13
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,660
Get him up here.

14
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,440
Sky Six, Ripper Six, radio
check. Over.

15
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,630
BARNES: Watch it below!

16
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,820
BARNES: Morehouse, drop back to slack.

17
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,620
BARNES: Who's on Tail-end Charlie?

18
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,760
EagIe, EagIe, Ripper Six.
Pos rep follows.

19
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,570
I, ShackIe, Lima, Whiskey,
Alpha, Whiskey, Foxtrot.

20
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,400
Warren, move Sanderson out on flank.

21
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,120
- Say, Huffmeister!
- Yo!

22
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,990
- You got a smoke?
- No, I'm out of those!

23
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,860
Xin loi, man.

24
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,490
HARRIS: Bravo Two-Six.

25
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,160
What's the delay up on point?

26
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,390
You having compass trouble again, Wolfe?

27
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,780
Come higher.

28
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,090
Shit.

29
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,580
- Get up.
- Get up.

30
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,960
Get a move on, boy.

31
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,470
Boy, what you waiting for?

32
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,720
Ain't gonna bite you.

33
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,060
That's a good gook.

34
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,940
Good and dead.

35
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,630
Cherry. Yo! Cherry!

36
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,970
Two-five-two actual. Move it out. Six says
we're jamming them up back there. Over.

37
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,890
Tell that dipshit to get unfucked.

38
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,600
WOLFE: This is Two-Five, be advised.
We're moving out shortly. Out.

39
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,520
What the hell's the matter with you,
Taylor?

40
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,610
You are one simple son of a bitch.

41
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,190
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

42
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,900
Get that other cherry up here. Gardner.

43
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,070
- And the Doc.
- Gardner! Doc! Up!

44
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,570
Gardner and the Doc, to the front!
To the front!

45
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,210
Gardner, up.

46
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,960
Gardner, get your ass up the hill,
you fat fuck!

47
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,300
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

48
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,050
Pos rep foIIows.

49
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,640
I, ShackIe, Lima, Whiskey,

50
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,140
Alpha, Whiskey, Foxtrot,

51
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,890
Foxtrot, Echo, Whiskey, ShackIe.

52
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,650
You all right?

53
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,400
Ants. I got ants all over my neck.

54
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,950
You got some fucking red ants.

55
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,260
Bites are killers.

56
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,560
Black ants are the worst.

57
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,930
Hurry up, lard-ass.

58
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,580
- Better lose some weight.
- Better hustle up, bacon.

59
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,330
I'm so tired!

60
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,780
Just a little.

61
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,110
Don't drink too much.

62
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,640
Look, I don't want you drinking any more.
All right?

63
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,120
I don't want you cramping up.

64
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,510
You're humping too much stuff, troop.

65
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,270
You don't need half this shit.

66
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,100
I'll haul it for you,

67
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,270
but next time you check with me first,
all right?

68
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,450
Okay. Thanks, Sarge.

69
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,350
- All right, you okay?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,210
Two-Two, this is Six.

71
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,480
l understand you have a bird inbound
at your pos at this time.

72
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,630
RTO: Bravo Six, Bravo Six, be advised.

73
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,220
Resupply helo is inbound at this time.
Over.

74
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,310
Come on, you people! Get ready.
Get that ammo off now!

75
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,190
Move it!

76
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,150
It ain't D-E-R-E, it's D-E-A-R.

77
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,420
And Sarah ain't got no two "R" s, King.
Damn, you dumb!

78
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,610
It don't make no difference.
She know what I mean.

79
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,480
She don't read too good nohow.

80
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,310
JUNIOR: Look at this shit! Pork again!

81
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,700
Man, why don't you let me have
that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man?

82
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,920
Just today. I can't eat this shit, Harold!

83
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,070
What you been smoking, Junior?

84
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,930
I hope you don't get that laundry gig.
I hope Manny get it.

85
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,640
'Cause your ass need
to hump, hump, and hump.

86
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,440
Hey, white boy, what you waiting for?
That hole ain't gonna dig itself.

87
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,100
Come on, boy.
Get your dick skin on that thing! Dig!

88
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,970
We ain't got all day! Dig! Dig!

89
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,650
CHRIS: Somebody once wrote,

90
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,480
"Hell is the impossibility of reason."

91
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,650
That's what this place feels like. Hell.

92
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,460
l hate it already, and it's only been a week.
Some goddamn week, Grandma.

93
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,250
The hardest thing l think l've ever done
is go on point. Three times this week.

94
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,370
l don't even know what l'm doing.

95
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,170
A gook could be standing three feet
in front of me, and l wouldn't know it.

96
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,050
l'm so tired.

97
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,970
We get up at 5:00 a.m., hump all day,

98
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,480
camp around 4:00 or 5:00,
dig a foxhole, eat.

99
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,330
Then put out an all-night ambush
or a three-man listening post in the jungle.

100
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,730
lt's scary, 'cause nobody tells me
how to do anything 'cause l'm new.

101
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,740
Nobody cares about the new guys.
They don't even want to know your name.

102
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,570
The unwritten rule is
a new guy's life isn't worth as much

103
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,780
'cause he hasn't put his time in yet.

104
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,320
And they say if you're gonna get killed
in the Nam,

105
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,630
it's better to get it in the first few weeks.

106
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,670
The logic being you don't suffer that much.

107
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,640
lf you're lucky,
you get to stay in the perimeter at night,

108
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,840
and then you pull a three-hour guard shift.

109
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,160
So, maybe you sIeep three, four hours
a night,

110
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,200
but you don't really sleep.

111
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,010
l don't think l can keep this up for a year,
Grandma.

112
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,510
l think l made a big mistake coming here.

113
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,730
We've got beaucoup movement.

114
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,570
The third battalion just got hit
15 klicks north of here.

115
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,990
Charlie had claymores
strung up in the trees.

116
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,530
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces.
Bad shit.

117
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,750
Yeah, they got two lieutenants
and a captain.

118
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,380
Jesus.

119
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,090
All right, Sergeant,
who do you want on ambush?

120
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,010
Elias, you take your squad out.

121
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,670
Warren, you stay in,

122
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,810
but I need Tex and Junior from your squad.

123
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,030
Roger that.

124
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,130
Okay, move out in two-zero mikes.

125
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,180
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

126
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,520
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

127
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,650
Fu Sheng's going on an R&R tomorrow,

128
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,070
and you want to send them out
on an ambush?

129
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,030
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

130
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,620
They don't know shit, Barnes,

131
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,740
and chances are
we're gonna run into something.

132
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,830
Think about it.

133
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,950
O'NEILL: That's just great, Bob,
and what do you want me to do?

134
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,410
Send one of my guys out to get zapped

135
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,290
so some lame-ass just in from the world
can get his beauty sleep? No.

136
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,340
Hey, O'Neill, take a break.

137
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,130
You don't have to be a prick
every day of your life, you know.

138
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,630
Elias, get your men ready.

139
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,560
Guy's in three years, he thinks
he's Jesus fucking Christ or something.

140
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,850
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in,
but you go out.

141
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,140
I need veterans out there.

142
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,080
Sergeant Barnes.

143
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,440
Sergeant.

144
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,910
I think, in front of the men,
it's necessary for me to give the orders.

145
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,540
Yes, sir.

146
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,750
TEX: Shit, looks like it's gonna rain.

147
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,980
Man, it's gonna piss on us all night.

148
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,720
Gonna put a serious case of crotch rot
on that your ugly face of yours, Junior.

149
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,010
Goddamn, man.
You break your ass for the white man.

150
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,430
No justice, right?

151
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,350
What's O'Neill got,
a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

152
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,610
How come we always get fucking ambush?

153
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,790
'Cause it's politics, man, politics.

154
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,860
Hey, Chris, did I show you
a picture of Lucy Jean?

155
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,200
No, you didn't.

156
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,240
She's the one for me, all right,
that Lucy Jean.

157
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,370
- And she's waiting for me, too.
- Yeah, she's real pretty.

158
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,040
You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

159
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,670
- Hey, you got a picture of your girl?
- No.

160
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,380
I guess that leaves some unlucky girl
back at home, don't it?

161
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,200
Tuck this in.

162
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,790
Shitcan this.

163
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,810
Don't need this. Turn around.

164
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,310
Come on.

165
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,770
Tex, you got Junior and Taylor here
on your position.

166
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,690
God damn it, Elias,
don't mess with my pig.

167
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,860
I ain't getting greased
on this bush tonight,

168
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,570
so you keep this sorry cheese-dick
off my ass.

169
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,950
You got Taylor.

170
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,400
Gardner, you're with me.

171
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,830
Look, case anything happens to you,
you get lost or separated,

172
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,250
- don't yell out, okay?
- Okay.

173
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,580
- Just sit tight, and we'll get to you.
- All right.

174
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,290
Yo! Saddle up!

175
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,000
Lock and load!

176
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,810
Of course, Mom and Dad
didn't want me to come here.

177
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,690
They wanted me to be just like them,

178
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,110
respectable, hard-working,
a little house, a family.

179
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,110
They drove me crazy
with their goddamn worId, Grandma.

180
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,940
You know Mom.

181
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,740
l guess, l mean, l've always been sheltered
and special.

182
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,700
l just want to be anonymous,
like everybody else.

183
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,660
Do my share for my country.

184
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,670
Live up to what Grandpa did
in the first war, and Dad did in the second.

185
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,340
Well, here l am, anonymous, all right.

186
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,260
With guys nobody really cares about.

187
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,090
They come from the end of the line,
most of them,

188
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,260
small towns you never heard of.

189
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,350
Pulaski, Tennessee. Brandon, Mississippi.

190
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,850
Pork Bend, Utah. Wampum, Pennsylvania.

191
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,850
Two years high school's about it.

192
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,230
Maybe if they're lucky,
a job waiting for them back in a factory.

193
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,940
But most of them got nothing.

194
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,280
They're poor. They're the unwanted.

195
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,950
Yet they're fighting
for our society and our freedom.

196
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,240
lt's weird, isn't it? They're
the bottom of the barrel, and they know it.

197
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,500
Maybe that's why
they call themselves grunts,

198
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,080
'cause a grunt can take it,
can take anything.

199
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,510
They're the best I've ever seen, Grandma.
The heart and soul.

200
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,950
Hey, Taylor.

201
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,510
Hey, cheese-dick, you're up.

202
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,600
- What?
- You're up.

203
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,430
You sure you know how to work
the claymores, dude?

204
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,560
Yeah. I'm sure.

205
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,650
Flick the safety off
and bang on that sucker three times.

206
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,990
Three times. I got it.

207
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,120
And don't catch any "Z" s on me, buddy,
or I'll sling your sorry ass.

208
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,300
- You hear me?
- Okay.

209
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,090
Maybe I finaIIy found it,
way down here in the mud.

210
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,430
Maybe from down here
l can start up again.

211
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,600
Be something l can be proud of
without having to fake it,

212
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,930
be a fake human being.

213
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:45,730
Maybe l can see something l don't yet see
or learn something l don't yet know.

214
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,020
l miss you.

215
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,860
l miss you very much.

216
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,780
Tell Mom l miss her, too. Chris.

217
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,260
Junior.

218
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,010
Hey.

219
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,010
All right, motherfucker!

220
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,040
It's your shift, man!

221
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,810
Okay?

222
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,010
Here, take this.

223
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,140
Blow the fucking claymore!

224
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,270
Take the safety off! Goddamn it.

225
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,080
- Drop it!
- Take the safety off, boy!

226
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,790
Feed me, Junior!
Get over here and feed me!

227
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,160
Bravo Two, Bravo Two,
we...

228
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,140
My fucking arm! My fucking arm!

229
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,060
- Jesus fucking Christ! My arm!
- Easy, Tex! Easy, boy!

230
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,560
I'm getting you medicine.

231
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,900
HAROLD: Doc, over here. Gardner's hit!

232
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,530
- Be right there!
- Oh, shit.

233
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,030
I'm hit!

234
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,950
- HAROLD: Doc, he's hit, too.
- JUNIOR: Taylor's hit!

235
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,580
- Taylor's hit!
- Oh, shit.

236
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,200
Doc.

237
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,040
CHRIS: How bad is it, Doc?

238
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,000
That dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore!

239
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,170
DOC: Just relax, man, it's a scratch.

240
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,670
Hold this on here.

241
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,460
Don't lie to me, Doc! How bad is it?

242
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,720
He let them walk right up on us.
He was sleeping on his goddamn shift!

243
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,590
No, I did not.

244
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,020
Big Harold, you keep an eye on him.
You don't let him go into shock.

245
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,760
Shut up! Shut up and take the pain!
Take the pain!

246
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,620
RedIeg, RedIeg, Bravo Six.
l have NDPs at this time. Over.

247
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,380
Hey, little guy, you're gonna be okay.

248
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,090
Okay? Don't worry.

249
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,360
Big Harold.

250
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,270
Do you know if... If you're gonna die?

251
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,020
Do you feel like
everything's just gonna be fine?

252
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,980
Don't give me that morbid bullshit.
We're about to get out of here.

253
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,070
They gonna give you
three hot meals a day,

254
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,890
white sheets.

255
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,910
Them pretty white nurses,

256
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,120
they gonna give you blowjobs
if you pay them enough.

257
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,950
I heard all about them white bitches.

258
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,500
Don't baby-talk him, man!

259
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,500
The cocksucker fell asleep. He let them
walk right up on us and he don't do shit!

260
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,740
Just shut up, Junior.

261
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,630
You relax, okay, man?

262
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,930
Okay.

263
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,410
It's not so bad,

264
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,600
dying.

265
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,360
How long is...

266
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,870
Come on, bird's on the way, man.
Hang in there! You're gonna make it!

267
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,250
Come on, Gardner, hang in there!
You're gonna make it.

268
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,260
Come on! Don't quit!

269
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,670
Come on, Gardner! Help me!
Don't give up!

270
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,150
Y'all take a good look at this lump of shit.

271
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,490
Remember what it looks like.

272
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,880
You fuck up in a firefight

273
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,840
and I goddamn guarantee you
a trip out of the bush

274
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,720
in a body bag!

275
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,360
Out here, assholes,
you keep your shit wired tight at all times!

276
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,530
And that goes for you, shit-for-brains.

277
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,100
You don't sleep on no fucking ambush!

278
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,030
And the next son of a bitch
I catch copping "Z" s in the bush,

279
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,200
I'm personally gonna take an interest
in seeing him suffer.

280
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,960
I shit you not.

281
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,410
Doc, tag him and bag him.

282
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,450
I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant.

283
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,010
- It was Junior.
- Shut your face, chicken shit.

284
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,930
You in big trouble, boy.

285
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,090
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor,

286
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,260
everybody got one.

287
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,090
ELIAS: Knock it off!

288
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,320
We got two men need attention here.

289
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,060
Police up your extra ammo and frags.

290
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,940
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.

291
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,570
Junior,

292
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,900
Tony,

293
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,990
carry Gardner.

294
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,710
The man would be alive if he had
a few more days to learn something.

295
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,650
KING: Hey, Taylor. What's in the breeze?

296
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,320
- Okay, got light duty. Three days' worth.
- No shit!

297
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,950
- Yeah.
- Well, too bad we in base camp anyway.

298
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,370
- What you got, beers?
- Yeah.

299
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,620
Just stole me some from the Top's supply.

300
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,700
Yeah?

301
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,330
Shit, he been stealing it from us anyway.

302
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,000
Hey, Taylor! What, are you back?

303
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,210
Yeah, it looks like it.

304
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,920
Hey, King,
where'd you get those beers, boy?

305
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,050
I found it.
- Oh, you found it.

306
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,760
You going on report, son, now.

307
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,630
Yeah, both of you come with me.
I got a little job for you.

308
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,190
Good morning, Vietnam.

309
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,020
Motherfucker!

310
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,690
This is the bright sound in the a.m.

311
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,560
Motherfucker!

312
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,660
I'm too short for this shit, man.

313
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,830
They always fucking with us! No letup.

314
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,950
Politics, man. Fucking politics.

315
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,750
That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far up
Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio.

316
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,840
Thirty-nine and a wake-up, a pause for
the cause, and I'm a gone motherfucker!

317
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,010
- Back to the world!
- I hear you, man.

318
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,180
- Broke 100 the other day.
- No shit.

319
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,800
Ninety-two left to go.

320
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:09,390
April 17, heroes, man. Home to California.

321
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,480
I'll be sitting outside,
checking out the babes on the beach.

322
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,440
The surfing's gonna be good.

323
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,240
March, man, in Tennessee. Sniff the pines.

324
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,950
Sniff that cross-mounted pussy
down by the river.

325
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,570
Hot damn!

326
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,580
Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?

327
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,550
- Three hundred and what?
- Thirty-two.

328
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,420
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

329
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,710
Xin loi, my boy!

330
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,380
I can't even remember
when I was 332, man.

331
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,590
You gotta, like,
count backwards or something.

332
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,260
You know, like, you got 40 days in.

333
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,270
I mean, think positive, dude.

334
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,060
Hey, Taylor.
How in the fuck you get here anyway?

335
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,940
- Why, you look educated.
- I volunteered for it.

336
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,400
You did what?

337
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,690
I volunteered. I dropped out of college,

338
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,570
and told them I wanted the infantry,
combat, and Vietnam.

339
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,700
CRAWFORD: You volunteered for this shit,
man?

340
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,790
You believe that?

341
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,440
You's a crazy fucker, giving up college.

342
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,630
It didn't make much sense.
I wasn't learning anything.

343
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,750
I figured why should just the poor kids
go off to war

344
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,880
and the rich kids always get away with it?

345
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,530
Oh, I see. What we got here is a crusader.

346
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,390
CRAWFORD: Sounds like it.

347
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,010
Shit.

348
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,170
You gotta be rich in the first place
to think like that.

349
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,360
Everybody know

350
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,770
the poor always being fucked over
by the rich.

351
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,690
Always have, always will.

352
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,490
I tell you what, if you be cool, I
introduce you around to some of the heads.

353
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,470
What are the heads?

354
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,920
Later, man.

355
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,310
What's up, brother?

356
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,510
Your highness has arrived.

357
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,640
Hey, what's happening?

358
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,290
Man, I thought you was
hanging 10 in Cambodia.

359
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,520
Come on, man.

360
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,730
How's it going?

361
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,900
What you doing in the underworld, Taylor?

362
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,320
Well, this here ain't Taylor.

363
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,540
Taylor been shot. This man here is Chris.
He been resurrected.

364
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,250
You lame, Taylor?

365
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,540
- Am I what?
- Are you lame or something?

366
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,550
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

367
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,850
Give it here.

368
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,410
This shit's in the wind, troop.

369
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,990
Hey, man, what's happening, brother?
Why you...

370
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,740
You're gonna do that pot,
you better do it right.

371
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,970
LERNER: You're weird, man.

372
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,120
You're a child, Lerner.
Rhah don't waste time on you.

373
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,170
- First time?
- Yeah.

374
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,360
Then the worm
has definitely turned for you, man.

375
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,480
Feel good?

376
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah, it feels good.

377
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,230
I got no pain in my neck now.

378
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,890
Feeling good's good enough.

379
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,780
Put your mouth on this.

380
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,440
Man, where the hell is everybody, man?

381
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,060
They're getting high, that's what.

382
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,940
Bunch of hopheads. They think
they're something special, man.

383
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,020
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

384
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,660
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

385
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,160
Make about as much sense as you do.

386
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,660
All them chucks be rapping
about how they losing they ho,

387
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,900
saying how they ain't got
no bread for beer.

388
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:50,050
Fuck that honky shit. Ought to give me
some Motown jams, dig it?

389
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,010
Man, what are you talking shit for, man?

390
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,510
- Hey, Junior, you ever smoke any shit?
- That's right, dude.

391
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,640
You see, y'all be trying to keep
the black man down

392
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,430
and string him out on that shit.

393
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,190
But the time be coming, my man, when
the black man throw that yoke off.

394
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,440
Simple. Free your mind,
your ass will follow.

395
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,940
Yeah, I can dig it, man.

396
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,990
You smoke that shit, everything kind of
gets weird. You know what I mean?

397
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,950
You hear that story about the gooks
putting chemicals in the grass,

398
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,700
so we don't fight, so we become pacifists?

399
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,160
Hey, but don't you worry, Bunny,
'cause you's a killer anyway, man.

400
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,750
Yeah, but I still like a piece of pussy
once in a while.

401
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,090
Ain't nothing like a piece of pussy
except maybe the Indy 500.

402
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,340
Only way you get some pussy, man,
is a bitch dies and wills it to you,

403
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,530
and then, maybe.

404
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,920
How's it going, Bunny?

405
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,080
L.T., check it out.

406
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,230
You like that?

407
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,730
Terrific.

408
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,820
I'll send it home.

409
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,210
Hey, Junior.

410
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,490
- Lieutenant.
- Hello, sir.

411
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,170
Hey, Rodriguez,
that's quite a shrine you got there.

412
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,890
Thank you, sir.

413
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,550
- You need anything?
- No, sir.

414
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,340
...around this flyboy's neck
on the floor of the hot, hothouse, okay?

415
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Now wait a minute. This guy is easily
three, four times my size.

416
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,470
- Come on, man.
- No. No.

417
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,010
'Cause I got him in the O'Neill death grip.

418
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,680
He didn't know whether to shit or go blind,
for Christ's sake.

419
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,440
- Hey, what do you say there, L.T.?
- How you doing there, Red?

420
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,690
Not good. Not good.

421
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,730
This cocksucker's got every card
in the deck.

422
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,360
Full house.

423
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,320
Look like you're doing all right there,
Sergeant.

424
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,650
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

425
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,460
Hey, Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage?

426
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,160
Thanks, Sandy.

427
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,080
Play, Lieutenant?

428
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,790
No. Wouldn't want to get raped
by you guys.

429
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,590
Why's that, Lieutenant?
What you saving up to be, Jewish?

430
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,130
Jewish.

431
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,300
I gotta run.

432
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,800
I'll catch you men later.
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

433
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,480
News is up in five...

434
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,980
Well, that is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

435
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,230
What do you say there, Bob?

436
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,260
A guy like that make it? Yes or no?

437
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,820
I have to tell you,
that's precisely what I saw.

438
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,990
I mean, sometimes I just look at a guy,
and I know.

439
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,750
This fella's not gonna make it.

440
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,730
Just no fucking way.

441
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,220
- Yeah!
- I'm going now.

442
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,180
Come on, now!

443
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,320
I want some, now.

444
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,260
Yeah!

445
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,910
New Year's Day, 1968.

446
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,490
Just another day, staying alive.

447
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,070
There's been a lot of movement
near the Cambodian border.

448
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,410
Regiments of NVA moving across.

449
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,030
A lot of little firefights, ambushes.

450
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,410
We drop a lot of bombs,

451
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,000
then we walk through the jungle
like ghosts in a landscape.

452
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,940
Bunker.

453
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,230
Where?

454
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,040
Bravo Two, Bravo Two-Five.

455
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,340
We got beaucoup bunkers up here.
Over.

456
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,340
Two-five-two, roger. Bunkers at point.

457
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,690
Two actuals on the way.

458
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,300
Bravo Six, Bravo Six, Bravo Two.

459
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,810
Be advised.
There is a bunker complex up front.

460
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,840
Turning right on our way down. Over.

461
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,460
See you next week.

462
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,080
Bravo Two. This is AIpha.
Be advised. We're at the tunnels...

463
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,710
- I got swiped three times in my first week.
- ...and one man down at this time. Over.

464
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,550
Taylor, get your ass up on that flank
about 50 meters.

465
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,520
Washington, you cover this side.

466
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,850
- Yes, sir.
- Get off your ass, Harold.

467
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,970
Bummer.

468
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,610
Christ. Look at that, will you?
The teapot's still boiling.

469
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,060
Man, they were just here.

470
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,380
Man, this is spooky, Sandy.
Let's get out of here.

471
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,390
SAL: Watch it. Watch it!

472
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,700
Look what we got, Sal. We got maps.

473
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,880
We got S-2 stuff.

474
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,470
Man, this is gook stuff!
Let's get out of here!

475
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,320
No, Sal. This is important.
This is important.

476
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,050
Let's leave. Let's go.

477
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,590
Booby trap! Get down!

478
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,400
Medic!

479
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,950
Holy...

480
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,560
God damn it.

481
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,340
We got...

482
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,600
We got two men down, sir.
There was an explosion.

483
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,100
This... We need help, sir. ASAP.

484
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,690
Move your ass out of here! Let's go.
One round would get all you guys out.

485
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,070
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

486
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,900
- Lieutenant.
- What?

487
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,070
Tell Six we need engineers.
This pos is crawling with traps.

488
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,530
They're on their way. Now listen.

489
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,780
The NVA out of here have been spotted
in the village half a klick down the river.

490
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,620
- Now Six says we gotta get there ASAP.
- Okay.

491
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,160
Also, leave four of your men here
and a medic, okay?

492
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,300
- All right.
- Move it out.

493
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,980
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

494
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:39,030
- Hey, where's Manny?
- Manny!

495
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,950
- Yo, Manny!
- Hey, Washington.

496
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,570
Manny!

497
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,910
- Hey, Manny!
- Manny!

498
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,040
- Washington!
- Yo, Manny.

499
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,280
Manny, where you at?

500
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,360
We had to get to the viIIage before
dark.

501
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,320
So we left Elias with some men to
keep looking and to wait for the engineers.

502
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,030
But it was King who found him,
about 1,000 yards downriver,

503
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,170
not far from the village.

504
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,520
lt was the end of the mystery.

505
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,330
The motherfuckers.

506
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,340
The viIIage,
which had stood for maybe 1,000 years,

507
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,630
didn't know we were coming that day.

508
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,930
lf they had, they would have run.

509
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,510
Barnes was at the eye of our rage.

510
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,100
And through him, our Captain Ahab.

511
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,270
He would set things right again.

512
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,610
That day, we loved him.

513
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:40,070
There he goes, Sarge.

514
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,580
- Check him out.
- Yeah. You got it, Sarge.

515
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,340
Tubbs and Ebenhock, let's go.

516
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,090
Get that stupid look off your face!

517
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,420
Hey, piggy, piggy. Hey, pig.

518
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,770
Don't leave a hooch.
Spread out on the right!

519
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,430
Okay, watch your back!

520
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,360
Let's go!

521
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,560
What do you got here, huh?

522
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,980
Let's go! Move it! Go!

523
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,820
Get over there. Move it!

524
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,150
Come on! Let's go!

525
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,160
Let's go, Junior. Bring them in.

526
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,330
We have some people down here.

527
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,540
Get out of there, you fuckheads! Move!

528
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,720
Come on!

529
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,680
Put them in the pig pen.

530
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,400
Give me your Willy Pete.

531
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,490
Shut up! Get back!

532
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,810
Fire in the hole!

533
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,510
Shut up! I said shut up! Shut up!

534
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,380
Get them out of here.

535
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,420
Fuck. We got one.

536
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,730
Get the fuck out of the hole! Move!

537
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,520
Get the fuck out of there. Let's go!
Come on, motherfucker!

538
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,020
Be cool. Be cool. They're scared, man.
They're scared.

539
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,570
They're scared, huh?
What about me, man?

540
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,610
What about me?
I'm sick of this fucking shit.

541
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,240
Come on, motherfucker, move!

542
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,990
Watch this, fucker!

543
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,280
Fuckers don't want us here, man.

544
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,990
Who the fuck
do you think they're fighting for, huh?

545
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,080
Yeah, one more!

546
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,700
Hey! Hey!

547
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,650
Well, well. What have we here?

548
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,560
One, two, three, four MAG 58
Czechoslovakian machine guns.

549
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,870
We got two, four...

550
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:19,770
Barnes, they got enough rice here
to feed a whole fucking regiment.

551
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:25,150
Sergeant Warren,
you bring that honcho over here.

552
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,820
Tubbs, get over here. Junior, burn it.

553
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,950
What the fuck's the matter with you?
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

554
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,160
Look like I was gonna fucking hurt you?

555
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,120
Why didn't you listen to me, huh? Why?
Why didn't you fucking listen to me?

556
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,580
Fucking stupid? You stupid asshole.
Get the fuck up here!

557
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,000
Come here, motherfucker.
What are you smiling at?

558
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,970
- Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?
- Do him, man. Do him!

559
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,470
What are you smiling at, huh?
You want something to smile at, huh?

560
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,650
You want something to smile at,
motherfucker?

561
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,580
Dance, motherfucker!

562
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,460
BUNNY: Do him, man! Do him!

563
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,520
Dance, motherfucker!

564
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,610
Dance! Dance!

565
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,690
Dance!

566
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,140
One-legged motherfucker!

567
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,320
Come on, man. Let's go, man.

568
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,800
Fucking pussy, man. He's laughing at you.

569
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,720
That's the way the gook laughs.

570
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,300
Yeah, sure you are.

571
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,390
You're real sorry, ain't you?

572
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:40,020
You're just crying your little hearts out
about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

573
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,250
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

574
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,500
What do you say?

575
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:10,020
Holy shit! You see that fucking head
come apart, man?

576
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,920
I never seen brains like that before, man.

577
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,970
I bet you the old bitch
runs the whole fucking show, man.

578
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,220
She probably cut Manny's throat.

579
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:24,520
She'd probably cut my balls off
if she had the chance.

580
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,810
Bunny, we leave now.
Nobody saw a fucking thing!

581
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:27,940
- You understand me, Taylor?
- Fucking woman, man.

582
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,060
Not a fucking thing.

583
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:33,870
Come on, man, let's fucking do her, man.
Let's do this whole fucking village!

584
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,290
Look at the scars on this gook honcho,
Sarge.

585
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,250
Get out of here, Tubbs.

586
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,930
Where'd he get these wounds?

588
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:01,100
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid.
- He's a dink for sure.

589
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,600
Ask him why those weapons are here.

590
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,440
Says they had no choice.

591
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,400
Says the NVA killed the old honcho
when he said no.

592
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,820
Now he says all the rice is theirs.

593
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,610
Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

594
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,700
Who the hell was the gook
we nailed on the riverbank?

595
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,920
He doesn't know. He says that the NVA
ain't been around in a couple of months.

596
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,920
Look, maybe he was a scout or something,
Sarge.

597
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,630
Yeah, sure, a scout.

598
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:37,630
What about the fucking rice
and the weapons? Who are they for?

599
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,510
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying!
He understands. Don't you, pop?

600
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,510
- Goddamn right he does.
- You bet.

601
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,310
Damn it! He's lying through his teeth.
Come on!

602
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,180
Waste the fucker, then see who talks.

603
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,300
The boy doesn't fucking know anything.

604
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,030
He swears he doesn't know anything.

605
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,820
He hates the NVA,
but they come when they want,

606
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,990
- and they just take the...
- What's the bitch saying?

607
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,700
I don't know. She's going on
about why'd we kill the pigs,

608
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,950
they're farmers, they got to make a living.
All that kind of shit.

609
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,290
Jesus!

610
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,530
Enough! Shut the fuck up! Enough.

611
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:50,040
You tell him he starts talking,
or I'm gonna waste more of them.

612
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,120
Tell him, Lerner!

613
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,040
Hey, Sarge, let us in on this, all
right?

614
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,270
Let's go for it!
Let's do the whole fucking village!

615
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,760
Come on, Sarge!
What the fuck are we waiting for?

616
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,840
Let's do them, all right?

617
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:24,100
This is his daughter, right? Right?

618
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:36,400
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

619
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,720
Barnes!

620
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,560
Barnes!

621
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,700
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

622
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,060
Stay out of this, Elias.
This ain't your show.

623
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,930
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit.

624
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,200
- Get him!
- Get up, Barnes!

625
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,440
Elias! No, no, no!

626
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,750
Chief! Chief, tear his fucking head
off!

627
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,130
Get him! Get him!

628
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,880
Tear him apart!

629
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,170
Come on, Elias!

630
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,750
Send him to hell! Send him to hell,
Elias!

631
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:29,390
Come on, boys, break it up now!

632
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:36,440
Break it up!

633
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,770
Come on, Elias, chill!

634
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:45,000
You're dead, Elias!
I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

635
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,620
You're going to do time!

636
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,490
This shit won't wash, you fucking puke!

637
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,730
Break it up! Shut up!

638
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:57,030
Break it up! Listen up!

639
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,000
The captain says to torch this place!
You hear that?

640
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Torch this place!

641
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,340
Blow the weapons in place! Round up
all suspected VC and shake it up!

642
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,720
We ain't got much light left.

643
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,220
Lieutenant, why the fuck
didn't you do something?

644
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,180
What are you talking about?

645
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,810
You know what the fuck I'm talking about!

646
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:20,610
No, I don't. I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Elias.

647
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,780
All right, move it out! Let's go!
You heard the Lieutenant! Move it out!

648
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,200
Taylor, let's go, for Christ's sake!

649
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,370
Move it out!
Police up the weapons and let's go!

650
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,610
Come on, Harold. It's cool.

651
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,160
Fire in the hole!

652
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,210
Hey, come on.

653
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,260
Fucker. You fucker, get out of here!

654
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,470
Get the fuck off!

655
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:16,180
Don't do it! Don't do it!

656
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,460
You fucker! What is this, huh?

657
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,230
What are you, a homosexual, Taylor?

658
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,900
What the fuck is your problem, Taylor?
She's a fucking dink.

659
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,780
She's a fucking human being, man!

660
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,320
- Fuck you!
- Go fuck a cherry, Taylor.

661
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,200
Fucking animal!
All of you, you're fucking animals!

662
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,290
Fucking lame fuck!

663
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:43,160
TONY: You don't belong in the Nam, man.
This ain't your place at all.

664
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:46,450
You don't fucking get it, do you, man?

665
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:49,580
You just don't fucking get it.

666
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,550
It's okay.

667
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,100
Get out of there!

668
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:00,820
Fuck you, too, man.

669
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:05,780
Come on, guys. Police up your dicks
and let's get out of here.

670
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:02,410
- I didn't see anything, sir.
- I did.

671
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,330
That dink was reported to me as NVA
by Sergeant Barnes, sir.

672
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:09,330
My report, sir, will include Lieutenant
Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

673
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,420
All right, Elias.

674
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:14,260
- Staff Sergeant Barnes?
- Sir!

675
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:17,550
I want a full report from you on this
when we get back to the CP.

676
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:21,640
You got it, Dai-'Uy, and I can throw in
plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.

677
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,510
Not now, god damn it! Not now.

678
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,100
We'll get into this when we get back
to the base camp.

679
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,020
And I can promise you something.

680
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:33,610
If I find out there was an illegal killing,
there will be a court-martial.

681
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:38,410
Right now I need every man in the field,
and you two will cease fire.

682
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:42,160
Staff Sergeant Barnes,
Sergeant Elias, you hear me?

683
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,620
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

684
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,620
Now, we're going back into
that NVA bunker complex tomorrow.

685
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,120
This time from the East.

686
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,670
You people get some rest

687
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,040
and be back up here at the CP
at 1900 for a briefing.

688
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:55,230
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

689
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,340
Come on, man.

690
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,510
You think these chucks
give a fuck about you and me?

691
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,640
It could just as well have been you, Harold,
you got in Barnes' way.

692
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,760
And that Bunny,
that motherfucker's crazy.

693
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,980
I mean, he scares me, man.
He just scares me.

694
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:20,410
Look, you bloods are getting too hung up
on all this shit.

695
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:23,240
These gooks are a lot smarter
than you think.

696
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,700
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

697
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,990
They was NVA, every last one of them.

698
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:32,710
Now, he's taken us this far, right?
He'll take us the rest of the way.

699
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,290
I don't know.

700
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,460
I mean, a Christian don't go around
a village, cutting off heads and shit.

701
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:42,010
This shit is really getting out of hand,
man. It's going way out of control.

702
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:45,470
It seems to me that you don't seem
to know the difference,

703
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:48,680
the way you shoot up that shit
all the time.

704
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,030
I don't know, brothers,

705
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,940
but I'm hurting real bad inside.

706
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,450
Don't worry about it, Sergeant.
Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

707
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:03,820
- I mean, he's a troublemaker, but...
- Elias is a water-walker,

708
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,950
like them politicians in Washington
trying to fight this war

709
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,790
with one hand tied around their balls.

710
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:12,080
Ain't no need or time
for a courtroom out here.

711
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,120
Come on, let's go.

712
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,150
- Sarge.
- Thanks, Bun.

713
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,320
How'd it go there, Bob?

714
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,890
Yeah. Atta way, Sarge. Fucking Elias, man.

715
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,220
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

716
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:31,480
He's gonna get everybody in this platoon
in deep shit.

717
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,150
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

718
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:38,900
So, what do you think there, Bob?
Gonna be an investigation or what?

719
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,530
Bob?

720
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,990
BUNNY: O'Neill, man, you worry too much.

721
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:46,600
Sarge will take care of it.

722
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:53,580
It's a beautiful night.

723
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,710
ELIAS: Yeah. I love this place at night,

724
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,420
the stars.

725
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,420
There's no right or wrong in them.

726
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,720
They're just there.

727
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,770
That's a nice way of putting it.

728
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:15,440
Barnes has got it in for you, doesn't he?

729
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,620
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

730
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,650
And you? Do you believe?

731
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,720
In '65, yeah.

732
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,910
Now,

733
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,750
no.

734
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:41,220
What happened today
is just the beginning.

735
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,430
We're gonna lose this war.

736
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:47,760
Come on. You really think so?

737
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,390
Us?

738
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,770
We been kicking other people's asses
for so long,

739
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:56,100
I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

740
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:10,620
Day by day, I struggIe to maintain
not only my strength but my sanity.

741
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:15,520
lt's all a blur. l have no energy to write.

742
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,670
l don't know what's right
and what's wrong anymore.

743
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,630
The morale of the men is low.

744
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,670
A civil war in the platoon.

745
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:26,010
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.

746
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,550
There's a lot of suspicion and hate.

747
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:33,350
l can't believe we're fighting each other
when we should be fighting them.

748
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,350
Counting days and the six inches
in front of my face.

749
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,280
Not much else.

750
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:41,810
Hope things are weII, Grandma.

751
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,030
Tell Mom and Dad l...

752
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:47,990
WeII, just teII them. Chris.

753
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,720
Hey, big boy. I know you thought you had
that laundry gig all laid out.

754
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,390
Hell, I got to paint myself white
just to get me one of them fucking jobs.

755
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:19,440
It's all right.
I got my request in for a circumcision.

756
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,270
I'm gonna get my big ass
out of this fucker.

757
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:22,690
You gonna become a rabbi?

758
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,520
What you gonna do
with that little flap, boy?

759
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,150
Leech.

760
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,250
All right! Move it out!

761
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,830
Don't drink that, asshole.
You're gonna get malaria.

762
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,500
Yeah, I hope so.

763
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,330
Let's go.

764
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,280
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

765
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,550
Sergeant Warren's hit!

766
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,140
What the fuck's going on?

767
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:39,220
They got RPGs man, it's an ambush!
They were just fucking waiting for us here!

768
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,480
- Who's on point?
- Lerner and Warren!

769
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,850
Taylor, where you going?

770
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,350
Dig! Dig! Down!

771
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:50,740
God damn it, you assholes!
Get some firepower up there!

772
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,360
Right!

773
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,460
Watch out! Rockets!

774
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,460
Where the fuck's Lerner?

775
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:17,050
He's over there, by the log!

776
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,700
Fire mission. Grid. 6-4-9-4-0-2.

777
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:46,880
Direction. 6-1 -0...

778
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,940
Adjust fire, over.

779
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:54,130
Lieutenant, they're gonna get in
tight under the arty!

780
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,470
I spotted a cut over there.

781
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,430
Let me get some men and roll up that
flank. I can work right up on them.

782
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:01,390
Get me Barnes. Look, Elias, I don't know.
We got four down up there.

783
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,530
What do you want me to do?

784
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,140
Where the fuck is Red platoon?

785
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,810
Tell those assholes to get up here!

786
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,940
Elias, what the fuck
are you doing back here?

787
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,170
Listen to me, Barnes,
there's holes back here.

788
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,110
Third platoon's coming up here.
We're here.

789
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:19,370
Dinks get men in these holes,
they got us caught in a crossfire.

790
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,740
We'll shoot each other to shit.

791
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,620
Sounds pretty far-out to me, Elias.

792
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:25,410
I've seen it happen, Ia Drang in '66.

793
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,710
They cut us to fucking pieces!

794
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,790
I need three men!

795
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:30,670
Then you got them. Take off.

796
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:33,380
You keep pouring off that cover fire.

797
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:37,430
I don't wanna be stuck out there
with my ass hanging in the breeze.

798
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:40,390
You don't tell me
how to run my war, Elias!

799
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,350
Now, you go crying and rat fucking
the brigade on your own time!

800
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:47,480
But out here, you belong to me!
Now move!

801
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,150
You're an asshole, Barnes!

802
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:52,190
Sergeant, get that asshole O'Neill up here.

803
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:56,200
Two Charlie, this is Two! Be advised...

804
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:38,820
Stay down!

805
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,540
- Ammo!
- Ammo!

806
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,210
Be right back!

807
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:07,830
Sarge! Short round!

808
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,030
Medic!

809
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:39,130
- God!
- Medic!

810
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:49,290
Satchel charge!

811
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,230
Doc!

812
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,640
- Doc, help me out!
- Yeah.

813
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:02,110
Jesus!

814
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,870
- You okay?
- Don't leave me, man.

815
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,030
- All right.
- Don't leave me.

816
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,250
Hey, Gator, you're gonna be okay, man.

817
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,070
Don't leave me, man.

818
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:16,750
- You'll be okay.
- Here you go, man.

819
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,840
Hang in there.

820
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,590
- Drop your rucks.
- Just hang in there.

821
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,980
Taylor, you're coming with us.

822
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:23,800
Please, don't go.

823
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,500
- You're gonna be okay.
- Come on!

824
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:30,640
Doc! Take care of him, man.

825
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,770
Redleg, Redleg, Ripper Bravo Two
actual.

826
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:38,730
Adjustment follows. Grid.

827
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,690
You ignorant asshole!

828
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:44,950
What the fuck coordinates you giving?

829
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:49,120
You wasted a lot of people up there
with your fucked-up fire mission!

830
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,950
You know that? You know that?

831
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,880
Shit!

832
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:59,460
Redleg. Redleg. Ripper Bravo Two.

833
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:03,370
Check your fire! Check your fire!

834
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:15,370
They're coming.

835
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:22,490
Stagger yourself across this line.
Shoot anything that moves.

836
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,490
- They'll be coming from over there.
- Gotcha.

837
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:29,280
Any one of them gets through,
we are truly fucked.

838
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,660
Where the hell are you going?

839
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,660
Down by the river, about 100 meters,

840
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,870
in case they try to flank us.

841
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:40,000
Third platoon's coming up to our rear,
so watch for them.

842
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,250
Hey. Can I go with you?

843
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:45,640
No. I move faster alone.

844
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:54,060
Come here.

845
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,770
Let's let arty do
a little bit of the work here.

846
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,850
We tell everybody to pull back
to the church.

847
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:03,270
We link up with third platoon.
You got that?

848
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,650
What about Elias?
If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

849
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:09,700
You just haul ass, too, Lieutenant.

850
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,370
I'll get him.

851
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:54,530
- I got two of them fuckers, man.
- I got one!

852
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:57,750
Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!

853
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,210
Crawford!

854
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:04,790
Oh, man!

855
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:09,590
- Kiss my ass. I never thought I'd get hit.
- It's a lung, babe.

856
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:12,130
You got two of them fuckers.

857
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:13,260
Where's Elias?

858
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,300
Sarge, there's a bunch of gooks
came through there.

859
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,760
We got three of them fuckers.

860
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:19,730
Hey, didn't you hear the arty shift?
We're pulling back.

861
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:22,100
Now, get your wounded man
and get the fuck back to the church.

862
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,190
Get going.

863
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:26,020
- But Elias is still out there, Sarge.
- Taylor, I'll get him!

864
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:30,820
You get Crawford in now,
before I article 15 both your asses. Move!

865
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,490
Move it.

866
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,230
- All right, men. He's coming.
- Hold him down.

867
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:31,230
Medic, where the fuck are you?

868
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:34,490
Drag him there.

869
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:38,240
It's gonna be all right in a minute, brother.

870
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:41,440
Taylor, where you going?

871
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:54,760
Elias is dead. Fall back with the platoon.

872
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:57,420
- Get going.
- He's dead?

873
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,450
Yeah. Yeah, he's back there
about 100 meters.

874
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:03,450
- You saw him? Where?
- He's dead.

875
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:07,670
And there's gooks all over
the goddamn place. Get moving.

876
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,390
Let's go. Move it! Move it! Okay, let's go!

877
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:29,370
You okay, Harold? You're on the next one.

878
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:31,400
You're okay, bud.

879
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,830
Fuck!

880
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:24,920
- They got Elias!
- What?

881
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:33,640
Back down! Back down there!

882
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,730
Snake one-niner, fIy four,
there's still one on the deck down there.

883
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:46,640
Bring in the gunships, over.

884
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,640
HoId your armor! Guns! Guns! PuII off!
Pull off!

885
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,820
We're trying to come around my side.

886
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,900
He killed him.

887
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:14,450
I know that he killed him.
I saw his eyes when he came back in.

888
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:16,910
How do you know
the dinks didn't get him?

889
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,450
You got no proof, man.

890
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:21,000
Proof's in the eyes, man.
When you know, you know.

891
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,330
You were there, Rhah,
and I know what you were thinking.

892
01:21:23,330 --> 01:21:25,250
I say we frag that fucker tonight.

893
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:28,170
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

894
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:31,590
I say let Military Justice do the job on him.

895
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:35,430
Come on. Fuck the Military Justice!
Are you joking me?

896
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,930
Whose story you think
they're gonna believe?

897
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:39,930
O'Neill's? Bunny's? Wolfe's? Bullshit!

898
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,350
Shit, man, you try that

899
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:44,230
and Barnes will shove it
right back up your ass with a candle on it.

900
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:45,980
Well, then what do you suggest
we do, huh?

901
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:49,150
I suggest you all watch your own asses,

902
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,610
because Barnes gonna be coming down
on all of them.

903
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:53,110
You just gonna forget about Elias

904
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:55,280
and all the good times
we done had right in here?

905
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:59,450
Shit. You're trying to cure the headache
by cutting off the head.

906
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:03,290
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles
for him.

907
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:07,040
If there's a heaven,
and God I hope there is,

908
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:10,090
I know he's sitting up there
drunk as a fucking monkey

909
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:12,070
and smoking shit,

910
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,140
'cause he done left his pains down here.

911
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,300
You're wrong, man.

912
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,760
Any way you cut it,
Barnes is a fucking murderer.

913
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,810
Right on.

914
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:24,190
Taylor, I remember
when you first came in here

915
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,480
telling me how much you admired
the bastard.

916
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,560
I was wrong.

917
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:31,210
Wrong?
You ain't never been right about nothing!

918
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:35,450
And dig this, you assholes,
and dig it good...

919
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:38,830
Barnes been shot seven times
and he ain't dead.

920
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:41,540
Does that mean anything to you, huh?

921
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,090
Barnes ain't meant to die.

922
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:48,550
The only thing that can kill Barnes
is Barnes.

923
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,180
Talking about killing?

924
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,290
Y'all experts?

925
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,850
Y'all know about killing?

926
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,630
I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

927
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:24,160
Why do you smoke this shit?
So as to escape from reality?

928
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:28,820
Me, I don't need this shit.

929
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,590
I am reality.

930
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,770
There's the way it ought to be.

931
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:47,060
And there's the way it is.

932
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,910
Elias was full of shit.

933
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,570
Elias was a crusader.

934
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,740
Now, I got no fight

935
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:02,240
with any man who does what he's told,

936
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:06,360
but when he don't,
the machine breaks down.

937
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:11,460
And when the machine breaks down,
we break down.

938
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:14,840
And I ain't gonna allow that

939
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,820
in any of you.

940
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:19,220
Not one.

941
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,600
Y'all love Elias.

942
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,750
Oh, you wanna kick ass.

943
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:48,250
Yeah.

944
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,520
Well, here I am, all by my lonesome,

945
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,710
and ain't nobody gonna know.

946
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:08,010
Six of you boys against me.

947
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,270
Kill me.

948
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,250
I shit on all of you.

949
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:39,800
You motherfucker!

950
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:44,890
Give it to him! Whoop his ass.
Come on.

951
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,010
Yes, man.

952
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,680
- Come on, man! Go.
- Get him!

953
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,520
- Oh, fuck, come on.
- Get him, Chris. Come on.

954
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,810
Come on, boy! Come on!

955
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:56,190
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man.

956
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:58,940
You'll go dinky down in LBJ, man.

957
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:01,150
Ten years for killing an enlisted man.

958
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:05,010
Ten years,
you'll climb the fucking walls, man.

959
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,360
Don't do it.

960
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:28,180
Death?

961
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,690
What do you all know about death?

962
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,490
They sent us back into the vaIIey
the next day

963
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:50,580
about 2,000 meters from Cambodia

964
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,750
into a battalion perimeter.

965
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:57,130
lt felt like we were returning
to the scene of a crime.

966
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:34,120
AIpha Company had been hit hard
the day before by a sizable force,

967
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,920
and CharIie Company had been probed
that night.

968
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,960
There were other battalions in the valley.
We weren't the only ones.

969
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,170
But we knew we were gonna be the bait
to lure them out.

970
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:47,970
Somewhere out there
was the entire 141 st NVA regiment.

971
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,320
Caught those motherfuckers
trying to pull some shit

972
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,950
on Charlie Company last night.

973
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:12,620
They found maps on them, man.

974
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,290
Got a friend at battalion,

975
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:17,330
says they had every fucking foxhole here
fixed on it.

976
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:22,090
Distances, tree-lines, our claymores,
everything.

977
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:26,170
This is bad, man. I got bad vibes here.

978
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:28,840
I also heard we're in fucking Cambodia
right now.

979
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,870
Cambodia? Man, you kidding me.

980
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:34,730
You wanted to see me, sir?

981
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,190
Yeah, Ramucci.
Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

982
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:40,520
Squad, sir?

983
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,360
I didn't know we were still referring
to this platoon in terms of squads.

984
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,980
All right, look.

985
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:47,990
I want you to take those two holes
right there and there.

986
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:51,240
You're tying it off with Barnes up here,
King down there.

987
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,450
Yeah.

988
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:54,410
Begging your pardon, sir.

989
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:57,250
My two holes are far enough apart
you can run a regiment through them

990
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,370
and never see them.

991
01:28:58,370 --> 01:29:00,080
I have five live bodies left, sir.

992
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,380
Look, I don't wanna hear your problems,
Ramucci.

993
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:04,170
You'll get new men any day.

994
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:06,170
Meantime, you make do
like everybody else. Okay?

995
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:08,720
- I didn't ask for this job.
- I don't want to hear it.

996
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,760
- Oh, you don't wanna hear it?
- Yeah, that's right.

997
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,680
I don't wanna hear it, 'cause to tell
the truth, I don't give a shit, okay?

998
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,690
- I just don't give a flying fuck anymore.
- Right.

999
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:28,590
I'm glad I ain't going with them.

1000
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:33,590
Somewhere out there is the beast
and he hungry tonight.

1001
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:36,280
What a fucking bummer.

1002
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:40,790
Ten days and a wake-up,
and I'm still dealing with this shit.

1003
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:45,750
What's the matter with you, man?

1004
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,340
How come you ain't writing nobody?

1005
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:50,420
What about your folks?

1006
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:53,910
That grandma you was telling me about?

1007
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,930
Girl?

1008
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:03,680
You got a mother and father, don't you?
There must be somebody.

1009
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:06,210
Nah, there's nobody.

1010
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:11,240
You been smoking too much of this shit,
troop.

1011
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:15,440
Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

1012
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:18,120
I remember when you first come out here,
to the bush.

1013
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,410
You was green as a...

1014
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:25,330
Did you ever get caught in a mistake
that you just can't get out of, King?

1015
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:27,880
There's a way out of anything, man.

1016
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,340
Just keep your pecker hard
and your powder dry,

1017
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,760
and the world will turn.

1018
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,230
How many days you short?

1019
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:40,720
Nah, it's not just me.

1020
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,850
It's the way the whole thing works.
People like Elias get wasted.

1021
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:48,860
People like Barnes just go on
making up the rules any way they want.

1022
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:52,980
So what do we do?
Sit in the middle and suck on it.

1023
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,200
We just don't add up to dry shit, King.

1024
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,240
Whoever said we did, man?

1025
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,990
All you got to do is make it out of here,

1026
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:02,910
and it's all gravy.

1027
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:06,350
Every day, the rest of your life, gravy.

1028
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,120
Oh, shit, superlifer.

1029
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:15,680
Hey, King, collect up your shit.
Your orders just come through.

1030
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,300
Now look, man. Don't fuck with me.

1031
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:20,140
What do you need, a written invitation,
for Christ's sake?

1032
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:22,590
Cocksucker! Oh, wow!

1033
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,930
The lifers have made a mistake.

1034
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,520
They cut me some slack, Taylor.

1035
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,060
Look, you get your freight to Rodriguez.

1036
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:30,860
You got 10 minutes to make
the last fucking chopper out of here, man,

1037
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:34,510
'cause if you're not on it, I'm gonna be.

1038
01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:37,780
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

1039
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,700
That's great, King. I'm happy for you, man.

1040
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,530
- You take it on home for me, okay?
- Yeah.

1041
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,660
You got my address.

1042
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:45,250
You know where you can get a hold of me
anytime, right?

1043
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:49,160
I gotta beat it, man.
I don't want to miss that chopper.

1044
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:54,810
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1045
01:31:55,550 --> 01:32:00,260
Remember now, take it easy. Don't think
too much. Don't you be no fool.

1046
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:04,350
Remember, ain't no such thing
as a coward out here. Don't mean nothing.

1047
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:05,970
My man.

1048
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,660
I'll walk you out, man.

1049
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,410
Take it easy, King.

1050
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:23,240
I'm gonna take it any way I can get it,
brother.

1051
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,330
I hear you. Later.

1052
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,290
I'm pretty fucked up, Sarge!

1053
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:28,830
Oh, man! Don't touch that.

1054
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:30,580
I got to get on a chopper, man.

1055
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,210
So what's the problem?

1056
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,350
Says he can't walk.

1057
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:36,170
Shit.

1058
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:40,510
Martin, get your boots on.

1059
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,100
And the next time I catch you spraying
skeeter repellent on your fucking feet,

1060
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,230
I'm gonna court-martial your nigger ass.

1061
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,810
Well, then court-martial me,
motherfucker!

1062
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:57,280
Bust my ass.
Send me to fucking Long Binh!

1063
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,110
You do your fucking worst!

1064
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:03,160
You white folks have got
your last klick out of Junior!

1065
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:07,370
- O'Neill, get me that centipede.
- Sergeant?

1066
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:10,920
Yeah, that long, hairy,
red and black bastard

1067
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,420
I found in the ammo crate.

1068
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:17,050
I'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch,
see if he can walk.

1069
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,880
I remember now.

1070
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,430
Hey. Now hold up, man!

1071
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,470
You just hold up and wait, all right?

1072
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:26,310
Fuck it! I'll walk! I'll fucking walk, man!

1073
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:29,480
Fucking pussy, man.
Hey, Sarge, I got to have him in my hole?

1074
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:30,940
Yeah.

1075
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:34,320
Bob, I'd like to speak to you a minute.

1076
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,820
I can't take it no more.

1077
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:45,410
- I'd like to speak to you, Bob.
- Yeah, what is it?

1078
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:48,790
Bob, I got Elias' R&R.
It's coming up in three days, here.

1079
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:51,870
I was thinking about going to Hawaii,
maybe see Patsy.

1080
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:54,500
Hey, Bob, come on, I never asked you
for a fucking thing over here.

1081
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,710
You know, I was thinking maybe...
Well, to be honest with you,

1082
01:33:56,710 --> 01:33:58,920
I was hoping you'd put me
on that chopper with King out of here.

1083
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,050
What do you say, chief-a-rooney?

1084
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:02,590
I can't do that for you, Red.

1085
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:05,090
We need every swinging dick in the field,
and you know that.

1086
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,310
Hey, Bob, come on.
You can talk to me, for Christ's sake.

1087
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,470
All I'm asking for is three fucking days,
here.

1088
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:12,770
I am talking to you, Red,
and I'm telling you "no."

1089
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:15,100
So get back in your foxhole.

1090
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:18,960
Bob, I got a bad feeling on this one,
all right?

1091
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,980
I mean, I got a bad feeling.

1092
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,700
I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.

1093
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,870
You understand what I'm saying to you?

1094
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:30,990
Everybody got to die sometime, Red.

1095
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:40,630
Oh, shit.

1096
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:57,750
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

1097
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:11,880
Where's that fucking ambush?

1098
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:16,580
They ain't even waiting till later.
It's fucking coming now, man.

1099
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:19,030
Right fucking now.

1100
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:27,580
You know, Junior,
some of the things we done, man...

1101
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,600
I don't feel like we done something wrong.

1102
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,680
But sometimes, man,

1103
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,710
I get this bad feeling.

1104
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:41,860
I told the Padre the truth, man.
I like it here.

1105
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:45,110
You get to do what you want.
Nobody fucks with you.

1106
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:47,820
The only worry you got is dying.

1107
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:50,410
And if that happens,
you won't know about it anyway.

1108
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:52,700
So what the fuck, man.

1109
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:56,460
Shit, I got to be in this hole
with you, man?

1110
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:59,430
I just know I shouldn't have come.

1111
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,380
Don't you worry, Junior.

1112
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:06,130
You're hanging with Audie Murphy here,
my man.

1113
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:11,140
Bravo Three, Bravo Three, Bravo Six,
send me a grid. Send me a grid. Over.

1114
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:14,310
Can't, sir. Pinned down.
They're in the fucking trees.

1115
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,640
Okay, Three Alpha, now calm down, son.

1116
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,520
I'll get you a fire mission ASAP.
Smoke will be first.

1117
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,650
Lieutenant's dead.
Radioman looks dead, sir.

1118
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,190
I don't know where the map is, Captain!

1119
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:25,480
They're all around us, sir,
hundreds of them!

1120
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:27,610
l can hear them talking gook.

1121
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:30,780
Okay, Three Alpha. Now spot that smoke,
and tell me where to shift.

1122
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:33,990
Just calm down, son. Hang in there.
We'll get you out.

1123
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:36,960
Just tell me where the rounds hit. Over.

1124
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:54,970
Three Alpha Six.
How about those rounds, son?

1125
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:57,530
Can you adjust fire? Over.

1126
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:02,150
Three Alpha Six.

1127
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:06,730
If you can't talk, son,
just key your handset twice. Over.

1128
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:22,250
Shit.

1129
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:09,390
Trip flare! Rodriguez's hole!

1130
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:15,970
RPG!

1131
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,600
Doc, Doc!

1132
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,350
Taylor, Francis.

1133
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:23,280
Over here, man.

1134
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:27,270
What the fuck's going on?
Rodriguez's hole just got nailed, man!

1135
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:30,110
Gooks, man.
We got gooks in the fucking perimeter.

1136
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:31,780
Oh, shit! That's it.

1137
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,530
They got through Alpha Company.

1138
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:36,950
Anything behind you don't identify itself,
fucking blow it away, okay?

1139
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:41,540
Fuck! Two, air strike's coming in.
They're gonna be laying snake and nape.

1140
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:44,870
Don't get out of your fucking hole.
Stay right here, man.

1141
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,500
Fuck.

1142
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:53,300
They're probing us.

1143
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:56,050
They're gonna be going up and down
this line all night trying to get through.

1144
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:59,430
All right. Stay here. Stay cool.
I'll be right back.

1145
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:04,230
Whiskey, Foxtrot, Foxtrot,
Echo, Whiskey. Over.

1146
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,120
Who is it?

1147
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,870
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1148
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:33,550
It's the ambush. Over here, man. Hurry.

1149
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:38,470
Fuck it up.

1150
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:40,220
Shit. Quiet.

1151
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:44,810
They're all over the place.
Hundreds of them, moving this way!

1152
01:39:45,350 --> 01:39:48,020
They wiped us out, man!
We didn't have a chance!

1153
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:50,020
- Where's the CP?
- Back there.

1154
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,360
You guys, get out of here!
They're right on my ass!

1155
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:55,120
They ain't stopping for shit!

1156
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,370
Hey, Taylor, man, let's didi.

1157
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:00,990
You go.

1158
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:11,460
There!

1159
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:48,580
No. Hold it. Hold it.

1160
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:07,530
Out of the hole! Fast!

1161
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:12,400
Get out of the fucking hole!
They're gonna blow it!

1162
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:17,150
Let's go! Let's go!
Francis, move your fucking ass!

1163
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:19,650
They're gonna fucking...

1164
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,360
- Follow me.
- Wait.

1165
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:58,480
Die, you motherfuckers!

1166
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:09,120
Get back!

1167
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,460
It's fucking beautiful!

1168
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:17,780
- Let's fucking do it!
- Where are you going?

1169
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:26,920
- All right!
- Now come on, motherfuckers!

1170
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:33,390
Come on. You can do better than that!

1171
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:37,620
They just keep coming, man!
Fuck this shit!

1172
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:41,530
Get back here, you gutless shit!

1173
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,550
All right. Get me Bravo. Right away.

1174
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:43,420
Charlie Company reports hand-to-hand
on perimeter, sir.

1175
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:45,420
Three holes are down. They need help.

1176
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:48,800
Okay. Get two squads from Alpha
down there right away. Go. Go.

1177
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,360
Where's that goddamn air strike?

1178
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:55,700
Hey, scumbag, where the fuck you going?

1179
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:04,450
Eagle Six...

1180
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:11,750
Son of a bitch.

1181
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:15,120
Can't you get anybody?

1182
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:17,290
Damn it! Negative contact!
Can't raise Barnes.

1183
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:18,960
Two Bravo, Two Charlie, nothing.

1184
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,040
Get me Six!

1185
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:23,270
Bravo Six! Bravo Six! Oh, God!

1186
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,630
Get him in!

1187
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:31,800
They're coming through all over!
I can't do anything!

1188
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,010
Where's Barnes?

1189
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:35,140
Shit, he's dead! I think they're all dead.

1190
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:38,690
Doc, he's dead. Six, LT, Six.

1191
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:42,150
Captain. Captain, we've been overrun.
We're pulling back! Over.

1192
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:45,320
God damn it, Lieutenant.
Where are you gonna pull back to?

1193
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:47,360
They're all over the perimeter.

1194
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,490
Now you be advised.
You will hold in place, and you will fight.

1195
01:44:51,490 --> 01:44:54,330
That means you, Lieutenant.
Bravo Six out.

1196
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,690
Be advised.
We've got zips in the wire down here.

1197
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:29,740
Roger your Iast, Bravo Six.
Can't run it any cIoser.

1198
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:33,910
We're hot to trot and packing
snake and nape but we're bingo on fuel.

1199
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:36,030
For the record, it's my call.

1200
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:38,870
Dump everything you've got left
on my pos.

1201
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:43,670
I say again,
expend all remaining in my perimeter.

1202
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:47,300
It's a lovely fucking war. Bravo Six out.

1203
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:52,430
Roger your Iast, Bravo Six. We copy.
lt's your call.

1204
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:55,760
Get them in their holes down there.
Hang tough, Bravo Six.

1205
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,840
We're coming cocked for treetops.

1206
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:27,010
Barnes!

1207
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:33,760
No!

1208
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:25,220
Get me a medic.

1209
01:49:27,730 --> 01:49:29,440
Go on, boy!

1210
01:49:47,290 --> 01:49:48,910
Do it.

1211
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:23,800
We got men wounded
and live gooks at 3 o'clock.

1212
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:26,790
Look down here. Check them out.

1213
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:31,280
Come on, Elmo. Move your flea-bitten ass!

1214
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:38,300
Hey, you okay? You all right?

1215
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:40,850
Can you walk, huh?

1216
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:45,800
Hey, Doc, we need a medic up here.
Come on, Elmo.

1217
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,830
Come on, Doc, we got wounded here.

1218
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:10,550
Yeah.
That must have been some fucking fight.

1219
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:13,010
You alone here, man?

1220
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:15,290
Yeah.

1221
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:19,490
The bunch of fucking faggots,
they all left me.

1222
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:11,140
122 wounded and still counting.

1223
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:14,520
Estimate 500 Victor Charlie KIA.

1224
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:18,370
122 and still counting. Over.

1225
01:52:24,110 --> 01:52:27,490
- Hey, Taylor, that you?
- Hey, Francis.

1226
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:30,820
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- I'm okay. How you doing?

1227
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:33,030
Fine, man. Just fine. Hey, dig it.

1228
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:35,700
We two timers, man.
We're gonna get out of here, boy.

1229
01:52:35,710 --> 01:52:39,960
I'm gonna see you in the hospital.
We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.

1230
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,990
Sergeant O'Neill.

1231
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:45,130
- How you doing?
- Well, I'm just fine, sir.

1232
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:48,680
Well, that's good.
'Cause you got second platoon.

1233
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,300
Yes, sir.

1234
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:02,250
- You ready?
- You bet.

1235
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:34,250
I think now, Iooking back,

1236
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:38,700
we did not fight the enemy.
We fought ourselves.

1237
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:41,880
And the enemy was in us.

1238
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:45,630
The war is over for me now,

1239
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:50,210
but it will always be there
the rest of my days

1240
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:52,670
as l'm sure Elias will be,

1241
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:57,480
fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called
possession of my soul.

1242
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:00,100
There are times since,

1243
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:04,630
l've felt like the child
born of those two fathers.

1244
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,980
But, be that as it may,

1245
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:10,820
those of us who did make it

1246
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:13,790
have an obligation to build again,

1247
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:16,690
to teach to others what we know,

1248
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:19,990
and to try with what's left of our lives

1249
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:24,320
to find a goodness and meaning
to this life.
