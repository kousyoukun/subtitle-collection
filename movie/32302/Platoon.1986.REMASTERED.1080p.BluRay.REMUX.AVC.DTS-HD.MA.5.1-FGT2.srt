{\ren}And Sarah ain't got no two R's, King. Damn, you dumb!

57
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,520

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,150
白小子 你在等什么
{\ren}Hey, white boy! What you waiting for?

64
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,440
那个洞不会自己出现的
{\ren}That hole won't dig itself.

65
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,150
快点挖
{\ren}Come on. Get your dick skin on that thing!

66
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,790
时间无多 快点挖…
{\ren}You ain't got all day! Dig, dig!

67
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,350
有人写过 地狱是不可理喻的
{\ren}Somebody once wrote, ""Hell is the impossibility of reason. ""

68
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,500
这个地方就像地狱
{\ren}That"s what this place feels like.; hell.

69
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,960
我只是来了一周 但已经讨厌这里
{\ren}I hate it already, and it"s only been a week.

70
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,600
祖母 这一周很痛苦
{\ren}Some goddamn week, Grandma.

71
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,370
最辛苦的事 就是这星期站岗三次
{\ren}The hardest thing I"ve ever done is go on point three times this week.

72
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,300
我不知道我在做什么
{\ren}I don"t know what I"m doing.

73
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,980
我连越共在我面前出现也不知道
{\ren}A gook could be right in front of me and I wouldn"t know it.

74
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,880
我实在很累
{\ren}I"m so tired.

75
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,420
我们早上五点起床…
{\ren}We get up at 5.;00 a.m...

76
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,490
整天走动 四五点钟扎营 挖壕沟 进食…
{\ren}...hump all day, camp around 4 or 5, dig a foxhole, eat...

77
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,390
然后整晚埋伏 或是当哨兵
{\ren}... then put out an all-night ambush or a listening post.

78
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,330
我是新来的 没有人教我任何事
{\ren}Nobody tells me how to do anything because I"m new.

79
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,890
没人理会新兵 他们连你的名字也不想知道
{\ren}Nobody cares about the new guys. They don"t want to know your name.

80
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,800
新兵的生命不重要 因他没有经验
{\ren}A new guy"s life isn"t worth much because he hasn"t put his time in yet.

81
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,740
若在越南战死 最好在最初几周
{\ren}If you"re gonna get killed in Nam, it"s better to get it in the first weeks.

82
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,810
原因是你不会受太多苦
{\ren}The logic being, you don"t suffer that much.

83
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,180
如果幸运 留在外围防线…
{\ren}If you"re lucky, you stay in the perimeter...

84
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,720
守卫时能够睡三至四小时
{\ren}... then pull a guard shift, so you sleep three or four hours.

85
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,320
但你不能真的入睡
{\ren}But you don"t really sleep.

86
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,830
我认为我撑不到一年
{\ren}I don"t think I can keep this up for a year.

87
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,640
我不应该来这里
{\ren}I"ve made a big mistake coming here.

88
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,900
我们有很多活动

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,710
越共在树上挂上地雷
{\ren}Charlie had claymores strung in the trees.

91
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,080
整排军队被炸 真倒霉
{\ren}Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit.

92
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,560
两个中尉和一个上尉被炸死
{\ren}Got two lieutenants and a captain.

93
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,090
我的天
{\ren}Jesus.

94
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,170
你想谁去埋伏
{\ren}All right, who do you want on ambush?

95
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,370
伊利亚 你带你的小队出去
{\ren}Elias, you take your squad out.

96
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,670

99
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,490
我以为今晚轮到奥尼尔
{\ren}I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

100
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,250
特斯和莫尔豪经验不足
{\ren}Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

101
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,860
丰山明天放假 还要他们去吗
{\ren}Fu Sheng is going on R and R tomorrow. You want to send them out on ambush?

102
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,960
你要带新兵去
{\ren}You got the fresh meat, buddy.

103
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,660
他们什么都不懂 可能会遇到事情 仔细想想
{\ren}They don't know shit and we'll probably run into something. Think about it.

104
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,900
太好了 你想我怎样做
{\ren}Great. What do you want me to do?

105
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,430
你想我为了一个混蛋要好好睡觉 而让手下被杀吗
{\ren}Get one of my guys zapped so a lame ass can get his beauty sleep?

106
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,740
奥尼尔…
{\ren}Hey, O'Neill...

107
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,440
别再罗嗦
{\ren}...take a break.

108
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,010
你不用每天都这么讨厌
{\ren}You needn't be a prick every day.

109
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,940
伊利亚 叫手下准备好
{\ren}Elias, get your men ready.

110
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,150
他来了三年 以为自己是耶稣
{\ren}Guy's in 3 years, thinks he's Jesus Christ.

111
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,610
奥尼尔 他们留下 但你要去
{\ren}O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out.

112
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,720
我需要有经验的老兵
{\ren}I need veterans out there.

113
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,650
巴恩中士
{\ren}Sergeant Barnes?

114
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,030
在他们面前应该由我下命令
{\ren}I think in front of the men, I need to give the orders.

115
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,240
是 长官
{\ren}Yes, sir.

116
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,580
看来会下雨
{\ren}Shit, looks like rain.

117
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,320
我们整晚都要在雨中了
{\ren}It's gonna piss on us all night.

118
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,790
会令你脸烂掉
{\ren}It'll put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours.

119
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,660
你为那个白人而冒险
{\ren}Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man.

120
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
这里是没有公义的
{\ren}No justice around here.

121
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,290
奥尼尔又触怒中尉了吗
{\ren}What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

122
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,530
为什么总是我们负责埋伏呢
{\ren}Why do we always get fucking ambush?

123
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,700
这是因为他们在玩政治
{\ren}Because it's politics, man. Politics.

124
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,800
我有否给你看过露丝的照片 没有
{\ren}-Did I show you a picture of Lucy Jean? -No, you didn't.

125
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,040
她会是我的另一半
{\ren}She's the one for me all right, that Lucy Jean.

126
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,970
她也在等我
{\ren}She's waiting for me too.

127
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,810
她很漂亮 你很幸福
{\ren}She's real pretty. You're a Iucky guy, Gardner.

128
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,090
你有你女朋友的照片吗
{\ren}You got a picture of your girl?

129

{\ren}Where did he get these wounds?

495
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,710
他说他在轰炸中受伤 他一定是北越的人

496
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,480
问他这里为什么会有武器
{\ren}Ask him why these weapons are here.

497
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,730
他们没有选择 北越杀了抗命的老头目
{\ren}They had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.

498
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,620
他说那些米是属于他们 莱纳 胡说

{\ren}Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?

500
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,480
他不知道 北越军几个月没来过
{\ren}He doesn't know. The NVA ain't been here in a couple of months.

501
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,720
或许他是哨兵 当然了
{\ren}-Maybe he was a scout. -Yeah, sure. A scout.

502
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:39,150
那些米和武器是给谁的
{\ren}What about the rice and the weapons?! Who they for?!

503
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,610
北越军
{\ren}An NVC!

504
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,580

{\ren}That cocksucker knows what I'm saying. Don't you?

505
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,050
他一定知道
{\ren}Goddamn right he does.

506
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,290
他在说谎
{\ren}He's lying!

507

508
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,890
他说他什么都不知道
{\ren}Look, he says he doesn't know anything.

509
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,840
他讨厌北越但他们擅自来这里
{\ren}He hates the NVA, but they come when they want and take over.

510
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,440
她在说什么
{\ren}What's the bitch saying?

511
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,770
她问我们为什么要杀死猪只
{\ren}She's going on about why we killed the pigs...

512
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,780
他们是农夫 要养活自己
{\ren}...they're farmers, they have to make a living....

513
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,990

563
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,880
你们一点都不明白吧
{\ren}You don't fucking get it, do you?

564
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,090
你们不明白
{\ren}You just don't fucking get it.

565
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,490

{\ren}-I didn't see anything, sir. -I did.

569
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:07,360

{\ren}Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.

570
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,330

{\ren}My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

571
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,100
伊利亚 好
{\ren}All right, Elias.

572
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,410
巴恩中士 是
{\ren}-Staff Sergeant Barnes. -Sir!

573
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:19,740
我们回到总部后我要详细报告
{\ren}I want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

574
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:24,110
你有日志 我有很多目击证人
{\ren}You got a diary. I have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

575
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,680
不是现在
{\ren}Not now, goddamn it! Not now!

576
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:29,010
我们回到总部才调查这件事
{\ren}We'll get into this at the base camp.

577
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,620
我保证如果发现非法杀戮…
{\ren}I can promise you, if I find out there was an illegal killing...

578
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,620
一定会有军事法庭
{\ren}...there will be a court-martial.

579
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:41,090
现在我要全军作战 你们别再吵
{\ren}Right now, I need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

580
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:44,490
巴恩和伊利亚中士 听到吗

{\ren}-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

582
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,240
明天你们从东面再去那越共地堡
{\ren}We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

583
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:55,170
你们休息一下 晚上七点钟回来开会
{\ren}You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 1 900 for a briefing.

584
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,710
是 是
{\ren}-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

585
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:06,560
你认为他们会在乎我们吗
{\ren}Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

586
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:09,930
哈洛 也许会是你阻碍了巴恩
{\ren}It could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

587
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,300
那个宾尼呢
{\ren}And that Bunny?

588
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:14,830
他是个疯子
{\ren}That motherfucker's crazy.

589
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,600
他令我不寒而栗
{\ren}I mean, he scares me.

590
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,930
他很可怕
{\ren}He just scares me.

591
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,330
你已经受牵连
{\ren}You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

592
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,500
这些越南人比你想像中聪明
{\ren}These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.

593
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,780
巴恩知道他在做什么
{\ren}You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

594
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,880
他们是北越兵
{\ren}They was NVA, every last of them.

595
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,580
他带领我们走到这里了 他会带领我们走完这场战争
{\ren}He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.

596
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:35,860
我不知道
{\ren}I don't know, Holmes.

597
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,090
基督教徒不会到处杀人
{\ren}A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

598
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:44,190
情况失去控制了 完全失控了
{\ren}This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

599
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:47,460
看来你不知道怎样分别…
{\ren}Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

600
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,130
事情的轻重
{\ren}...the way you always shoot up that shit.

601
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,590
我不知道…
{\ren}I don't know, brothers...

602
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,670
但我内心大受伤害
{\ren}...but I'm hurting real bad inside.

603
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:02,470
别担心 伊利亚不能证明什么
{\ren}Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

604
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,740
他是个麻烦制造者
{\ren}He's a troublemaker.

605
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:07,650
伊利亚像华盛顿的政客…
{\ren}Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

606
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:11,620
想独力打这场仗
{\ren}...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

607
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,960
这里没有时间进行审讯
{\ren}Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

608
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,220
中士 谢谢你
{\ren}-Sarge. -Thanks, Bun.

609
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,660
情况怎么样
{\ren}How did it go there, Bob?

610
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:28,030
那个可恶的伊利亚
{\ren}Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

611
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,330
他是个卑鄙小人
{\ren}He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

612
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,510
他会连累这个连的所有人
{\ren}He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

613
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,080
有人要教训他
{\ren}Somebody ought to frag his ass.

614
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,910
你认为呢 会有调查吗
{\ren}So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

615
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:42,450
鲍布
{\ren}Bob?

616
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,760
你太担心了 中士会解决他
{\ren}O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

617
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,630
今晚天色很美
{\ren}It's a beautiful night.

618
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:58,800
我喜欢这里的夜晚
{\ren}Yeah, I love this place at night.

619
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:00,710
繁星…
{\ren}The stars....

620
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,400
它们没有对与错 它们就是在那里
{\ren}There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

621
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,220
你的比喻很好
{\ren}That's a nice way of putting it.

622
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,880
巴恩憎恨你吧
{\ren}Barnes has it in for you, huh?

623
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,090
巴恩相信他所做的一切
{\ren}Barnes believes in what he's doing.

624
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,890
你呢 你相信吗
{\ren}And you? Do you believe?

625
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,760
1965年时吗 我会相信
{\ren}In '65? Yeah.

626
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:32,870
现在呢
{\ren}Now?

627
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,670
不相信
{\ren}No.

628
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,740
今天所发生的事只是开始
{\ren}What happened today is just the beginning.

629
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,080
我们会输掉这场仗
{\ren}We're gonna lose this war.

630
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,380
不会吧
{\ren}Come on.

631
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:51,280
你真的认为我们会输
{\ren}You really think so? Us?

632
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,950
我们欺负别人太久了
{\ren}We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...

633
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,530
现在轮到我们被打击
{\ren}...I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

634
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,570
我每天都在挣扎
{\ren}Day by day, I struggle to maintain...

635
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,470
我努力维持体力和意志
{\ren}...not only my strength, but my sanity.

636
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,370
一切都很模糊
{\ren}It"s all a blur.

637
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,580
我没有气力写信
{\ren}I have no energy to write.

638
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:20,490
我不能分辨对与错
{\ren}I don"t know what"s right or wrong anymore.

639
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,710
我们的士气低落 出现内讧
{\ren}The morale of the men is low. A civil war in the platoon.

640
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,480
一半支持伊利亚 一半支持巴恩
{\ren}Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.

641
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,550
有很多猜忌和憎恨
{\ren}There"s a lot of suspicion and hate.

642

01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,790
你也看见 我知道你在想什么
{\ren}You saw. I know what you were thinking.

773
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,660
我们今天解决他
{\ren}I say we frag him tonight.

774
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:29,960
我赞成 以牙还牙
{\ren}I go with that. An eye for an eye.

775
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:34,070
让军事法庭处理吧
{\ren}I say let military justice do the job on him.

776
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:37,940
去他的军事法庭 你在说笑吗
{\ren}Come on, fuck the military justice! Are you joking me?

777
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:42,280
他们会相信谁 奥尼尔 宾尼 全是胡说
{\ren}Whose story you think they'll believe? O'Neill's? Bunny's? Bullshit!

778
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:46,680
巴恩不会放过你的
{\ren}You try that, Barnes will shove it back up your ass, with a candle on it.

779
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:48,690
你认为我们应该怎么做
{\ren}What do you suggest we do?

780
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:54,020
你们小心 巴恩会一个个的解决他们
{\ren}Watch your own asses. Barnes will be coming down on all of them.

781
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:57,530
你们忘记和伊利亚的美好日子吗
{\ren}You gonna forget about Elias? All the good times we had here?

782
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,430
你想把头砍下来治头痛
{\ren}Shit, you trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.

783
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:05,110
伊利亚没有叫你为他打仗
{\ren}Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him.

784
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:09,610
如果真的有天堂 天啊 我希望真的有
{\ren}And if there's a heaven, and God, I hope there is...

785
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:14,610
他会在上面喝到大醉
{\ren}...he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit...

786
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:17,590
因为他把痛苦留在这里
{\ren}...because he left his pains down here.

787
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:21,150
你错了 总之巴恩是杀人凶手
{\ren}You're wrong! Anyway you cut it, Barnes is a murderer!

788
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,430
对 泰勒…
{\ren}-Right on. -Taylor...

789
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:28,970
你当初入伍时说很欣赏巴恩
{\ren}...when you first came in here, you told me how you admired the bastard.

790
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:33,500
我错了 你做任何事都是错的
{\ren}-I was wrong. -You've never been right about nothing!

791
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:37,000
你们这班混蛋 留心听着
{\ren}Dig this, you assholes, and dig it good.

792
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:41,240
巴恩中枪七次都没有死去
{\ren}Barnes been shot seven times, and he ain't dead.

793
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:43,450
那对你有意思吗
{\ren}Does that mean anything to you?

794
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:46,180
巴恩是不会死的
{\ren}Barnes ain't meant to die.

795
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:50,990
唯一能杀死他的是他自己
{\ren}The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.

796
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,420
你们在谈死亡吗
{\ren}Talking about killing?

797
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,590
你们是专家吗
{\ren}You all experts?

798
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,770
你们都知道杀戮吗
{\ren}You all know about killing?

799
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:15,870
我想听听 猪头
{\ren}Well, I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

800
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:26,050
你们抽这个来逃避现实
{\ren}You smoke this shit to escape from reality?

801
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,830
我不需要这个
{\ren}Me, I don't need this shit.

802
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,260
我就是现实
{\ren}I am reality.

803
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:49,270
现实应该是这样 而现实就是这样
{\ren}There's the way it ought to be, and there's the way it is.

804
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,080
伊利亚满口一派胡言
{\ren}Elias was full of shit.

805
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:58,990
伊利亚是个斗士
{\ren}Elias was a crusader.

806
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:04,580
我不会跟听从命令的人作对
{\ren}Now, I got no fight with any man who does what he's told.

807
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,600
但当他不听命时…
{\ren}But when he don't...

808
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,660
运作便会崩溃
{\ren}...the machine breaks down.

809
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,800
运作崩溃时 我们就会崩溃
{\ren}And when the machine breaks down, we break down.

810
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,970
我不会许容那样的事
{\ren}I ain't going to allow that.

811
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,940
你们任何一个都不能
{\ren}From any of you.

812
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:21,640
一个都不可以
{\ren}Not one.

813
01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:40,230
你们都爱伊利亚
{\ren}You all love Elias.

814
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,730
你们想为他报仇
{\ren}You want to kick ass.

815
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,980
我独个儿在这里
{\ren}Well, here I am. All by my lonesome.

816
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,910
没有人会知道
{\ren}And ain't nobody gonna know.

817
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:10,090
你们六个对我一个
{\ren}Six of you boys against me.

818
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:17,690
杀我吧
{\ren}Kill me.

819
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,750
我卑视你们
{\ren}I shit on all of you.

820
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,550
混蛋
{\ren}You motherfucker!

821
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:49,990
打吧
{\ren}Come on, man.

822
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,230
柯里斯 打他
{\ren}Get him, Chris.

823
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,900
巴恩 不要下手
{\ren}Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man!

824
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,470
你要坐牢的
{\ren}You'll go dinky dau in LBJ, man.

825
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:04,780
杀军人要坐十年牢 十年
{\ren}Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years.

826
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,850
你想想吧
{\ren}Climb the fucking walls, man.

827
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,890
不要下手
{\ren}Don't do it.

828
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:30,430
死亡
{\ren}Death?

829
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:33,570
你们对死亡有什么认识
{\ren}What do you all know about death?

830
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:51,120
我们翌日被派回到山谷里
{\ren}They sent us back into the valley the next day...

831
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:55,200
进入离柬埔寨约二千米的战区
{\ren}...about 2000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter.

832
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:58,370
我们好像回到案发现场
{\ren}It felt like we were returning to the scene of a crime.

833
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:36,500
A连在前一天被重击
{\ren}Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable force.

834
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:39,110
C连在那一天被袭击
{\ren}Charlie Company had been probed that night.

835
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:42,440
山谷里有其他战事…
{\ren}There were other battalions in the valley...

836
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:45,650
但我们是引他们出来的饵
{\ren}...but we knew we were the bait to lure them out.

837
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:50,550
141北越军就在下面某处
{\ren}Somewhere out there was the entire 1 4 1 st NVA regiment.

838
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:12,470
他们昨晚想袭击C连
{\ren}Caught them trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.

839
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:14,800
他们发现地图
{\ren}They found maps on them, man.

840
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:19,850
听说每个散兵坑都有地雷
{\ren}Got a friend at Battalion, says they had every foxhole here fixed on.

841
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:24,580
知道我方的距离 林木线和地雷
{\ren}Distances, tree lines, our claymores, everything.

842
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:26,480
情况不妙
{\ren}This is bad, man.

843
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:31,260
我有不祥之兆 听说我们身在柬埔寨
{\ren}-I got bad vibes here. -I also heard we're in Cambodia now.

844
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,160
柬埔寨 你在开玩笑
{\ren}Cambodia? Man, you're kidding me.

845
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:36,630
你想见我
{\ren}You wanted to see me, sir?

846
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,600
拉姆治 伊利亚小组归你
{\ren}Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

847
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:45,810
小组 我不知道我的连叫小组
{\ren}Squad? I didn't know we were still referring to this platoon as squads.

848
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:50,480
我要你去那两个坑
{\ren}I want you to take those two holes, right there and there.

849
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:53,580
跟在上面的巴恩 和在下面的金联络
{\ren}Tie it off with Barnes up here and King down there.

850
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:56,910
长官 对不起…
{\ren}Begging your pardon, sir...

851
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:00,880
那两个坑距离太远 一个连队可以从中通过
{\ren}...my two holes are so far apart, a regiment could run between them.

852
01:29:01,190 --> 01:29:02,780
我只有五个军人活着
{\ren}I have five live bodies left.

853
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:06,650
我不想听你的问题 新兵很快到
{\ren}I don't want to hear your problems. You'll get new men any day.

854
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,630
你要和别人一样作战
{\ren}Make do like everybody else.

855
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,400
我没有要求这个 我不想再听
{\ren}-I didn't ask for this. -I don't want to hear it.

856
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,930
你不想再听 对
{\ren}-You don't want to hear it? -That's right.

857
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:17,570
因为老实说我毫不在乎
{\ren}Because, to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.

858
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,610
我不再在乎
{\ren}I just don't give a flying fuck anymore.

859
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:30,220
我很高兴我不用和他们一起去
{\ren}I'm glad I ain't going with them.

860
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:35,580
外面有一头饥饿的野兽
{\ren}Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.

861
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:38,060
真失败
{\ren}What a fucking bummer.

862
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,630
只剩十天了 我仍要面对这一切
{\ren}Ten days and a wake-up, and I'm still dealing with this shit.

863
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:47,800
你怎么了
{\ren}What's the matter with you?

864
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:50,330
你为什么不写信
{\ren}Why ain't you writing nobody?

865
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:52,630
你的父母呢
{\ren}What about your folks?

866
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:55,540
你向我提起的祖母怎样
{\ren}That grandma you told me about?

867
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,120
女朋友呢
{\ren}Girl?

868
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:03,480
你有父母吧
{\ren}You got parents, don't you?

869
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,650
一定有些亲密的人
{\ren}There must be somebody.

870
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:08,590
没有
{\ren}No, there's nobody.

871
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:12,660
你抽太多了
{\ren}You been smoking too much of this shit.

872
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:17,520
你要控制一下 令人颓丧
{\ren}Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

873
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:22,440
我记得你初来时什么都不懂
{\ren}I remember when you first come out here to the bush, you's green as--

874
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:27,070
你可曾被无法摆脱的错误缠绕着
{\ren}You ever get caught in a mistake you just can't get out of?

875
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:30,010
总有方法解决的
{\ren}There's a way out of anything.

876
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,740
只要你振作精神
{\ren}Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry...

877
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,980
一定有方法的
{\ren}...and the worm will turn.

878
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,480
你还有多少天
{\ren}How many days you short?

879
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,320
不只是我 而是整个事情
{\ren}It's not just me. It's how the whole thing works.

880
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,290
像伊利亚般的人要牺牲
{\ren}People like Elias get wasted.

881
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,330
巴恩那种人却能继续为所欲为
{\ren}People like Barnes go on making up all the rules any way they want.

882
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:55,370
我们只能逆来顺受吗
{\ren}So, what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it.

883
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:58,610
我们不用理会那些事情
{\ren}We just don't add up to dry shit.

884
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:03,710
谁说你需要的 你只需要活着离开这里
{\ren}Whoever said we did? All you got to do is make it out of here...

885
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:08,350
然后每天快乐地生活
{\ren}...and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life. Gravy.

886
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:13,710
你是理想主义者
{\ren}Oh, shit. Superlifer.

887
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,980
收拾你的行装 你的命令刚下达
{\ren}Collect up your shit. Your orders just come through.

888
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,630
不要骗我
{\ren}Man, don't fuck with me.

889
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:22,560
你要邀请信吗
{\ren}Oh, what do you need, a written invitation?

890
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:27,460
天啊 他们做错事
{\ren}Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers done made a mistake!

891
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:29,240
他们竟然饶我一命
{\ren}They cut me some slack!

892
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:33,270
你有十分钟时间赶去搭直升机
{\ren}You got 1 0 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here.

893
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:35,200
因为如果你不上机…
{\ren}Because if you're not on it...

894
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,080
我便会去
{\ren}...I'm gonna be.

895
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,180
泰勒 法兰西准备好了
{\ren}Taylor, Francis is coming up.

896
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:44,190
太好了 金 我为你 感到高兴 回家吧
{\ren}That's great, King, I'm happy for you. Take it on home for me.

{\ren}You got my address. You know where to reach me anytime.

898
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:50,790
我要走了 我不想错过直升机

{\ren}-Where's Barnes?! -He's dead! They're all dead!

1027
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:40,750
六队 中尉
{\ren}Six, L.T.!

1028
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:44,600
中尉 我们被袭击 我们会撤退
{\ren}Captain, we've been overrun. We're pulling back. Over.

1029
01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:49,590
妈的 撤退到哪里 到处都是他们
{\ren}Goddamn it! Where will you pull back to? They're all over the perimeter!

1030
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:53,870
你听着 你们要坚守作战
{\ren}Now you be advised! You will hold in place and you will fight!

1031
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:56,700
中尉 即是指你 六队通话完毕
{\ren}That means you, lieutenant. Bravo 6 out.

1032
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,100
这里被袭
{\ren}We got zips in the wire down here.

1033
01:45:29,410 --> 01:45:32,310
收到 B6 但我们不能再接近了
{\ren}Roger that, Bravo 6. Can"t run it any closer.

1034
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:35,740
我们准备投弹 我们燃料充足
{\ren}We"re packing snake and nape but we"re bingo on fuel.

1035
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:41,380
这是我的决定 投下所有炸弹
{\ren}For the record, it's my call! Dump all you've got on my pos.

1036
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:46,130
我再说投下所有炸弹
{\ren}I say again, expend all remaining in my perimeter.

1037
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:49,490
这是一场很棒的战争 B6通话完毕
{\ren}It's a lovely fucking war. Bravo 6 out.

1038
01:45:51,730 --> 01:45:54,860

{\ren}Roger your last, Bravo 6. We copy it"s your call.

1039
01:45:55,170 --> 01:45:58,140
叫他们留守散兵坑 你们支持着
{\ren}Get them in their holes. Hang tough, Bravo 6.

1040
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:01,000
我们会从树顶投下炸弹
{\ren}We are coming cocked for treetops.

1041
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:26,460
巴恩
{\ren}Barnes!

1042
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:35,240
不要
{\ren}No!

1043
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,410

下手吧
{\ren}Do it.

1046
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:25,970
小心 三点钟位置还有越兵活着
{\ren}Look out, we got live gooks at 3:00.

1047
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:33,620
快点
{\ren}Come on, Elmo! Move your flea-bitten ass!

1048
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:40,910
你没事吧
{\ren}You okay? You all right?

1049
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:42,210
你能走动吗
{\ren}Can you walk?

1050
01:50:44,190 --> 01:50:47,420
这里需要军医

{\ren}-Come on, Elmo. -Doc, we got wounded here!

1052
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:12,480
战争一定是很激烈
{\ren}That must have been some fucking fight.

1053
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:15,290
只有你一个吗
{\ren}You alone here, man?

1054
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:17,450
是
{\ren}Yeah.

1055
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:20,990
那些混球 他们留下我
{\ren}Bunch of fucking faggots. They all left me.

1056
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:13,810
122个受伤 仍在点算中
{\ren}1 22 wounded and still counting.

1057
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:15,240
估计有五百个伤者…
{\ren}Estimate 500...

1058
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:19,720
敌军22人阵亡 仍在点算中 完毕
{\ren}...Victor Charlie K.I.A. 22 and still counting. Over.

1059
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:28,250
泰勒 是你吗
{\ren}Taylor! That you?

1060
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:30,000
法兰西
{\ren}Hey, Francis.

1061
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:33,230

{\ren}-Hey, man, how you doing? -I'm okay. How you doing?

1062
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:34,590
我很好
{\ren}Fine, man. Just fine.

1063
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:38,170
我们受过两次伤可以离开这里
{\ren}Hey, dig it, we two-timers. We're gonna get out of here, boy.

1064
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:42,270
在医院再见
{\ren}I'm gonna see you in the hospital. We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.

1065
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:47,580
你好吗 我没事
{\ren}-How you doing? -I'm just fine, sir.

1066
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,940
好 因为第二连由你指挥
{\ren}Good, because you got 2nd Platoon.

1067
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:52,480

{\ren}Yes, sir.

1068
01:53:02,730 --> 01:53:04,430
准备好吗 准备好
{\ren}-Ready? -You bet.

1069
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:36,150
现在回想一切…
{\ren}I think now, looking back...

1070
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:41,360
我们不是对抗敌人 而是自己
{\ren}...we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves...

1071
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:43,960
敌人就在我们心中
{\ren}...and the enemy was in us.

1072
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:48,290
战争对我来说现在已经完结
{\ren}The war is over for me now...

1073
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:52,440
但它永远会存留在我的心中里
{\ren}...but it will always be there the rest of my days.

1074
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:54,880
伊利亚会和…
{\ren}As I"m sure Elias will be...

1075
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:58,710
巴恩为了 像罗德所说的 “灵魂的掌控”继续作战
{\ren}...fighting with Barnes for, what Rhah called, possession of my soul.

1076
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:02,680
我有时会觉得…
{\ren}There are times since...

1077
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:07,080
我是那两个父亲的儿子
{\ren}...I have felt like the child born of those two fathers.

1078
01:55:09,630 --> 01:55:11,490
但无论如何…
{\ren}But be that as it may...

1079
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:15,790
我们有责任重建社会…
{\ren}... those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again.

1080
01:55:16,530 --> 01:55:18,690
教导别人我们认识的一切…
{\ren}To teach to others what we know...

1081
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:22,700
我们利用剩下的一生…
{\ren}...and to try with what"s left of our lives...

1082
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:26,770
尝试找寻生命的意义
{\ren}... to find a goodness and meaning to this life.

1083
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:44,290
献给在越战中牺牲的士兵
