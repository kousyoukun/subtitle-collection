1
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,492
Oh, man! Is that what I think it is?

2
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,082
All right, you cheese-dicks,
welcome to the Nam. Follow me.

3
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,583
Dipped in shit! New meat!

4
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,668
- You dudes gonna love the Nam!
- For fucking ever!

5
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,890
365 and a wake-up! Oh, Lord!

00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,359
SEPTEMBER 1967
BRAVO COMPANY, 25TH INFANTRY

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,609
SOMEWHERE NEAR
THE CAMBODIAN BORDER

8
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,804
Get him up here.

9
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,276
<i>Sky Six, Ripper Six,
radio check. Over.</i>

10
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,824
Watch it below!

11
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:56,401
Morehouse, drop back to slack!

12
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,745
Who's on tail end? Charlie?

13
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,212
<i>Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six.
Pos rep follows...</i>

14
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,680
Warren, you get out on flank.

15
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,555
Say, Hoffmeister!
Got a smoke?

16
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,141
- No, man, I don't!
- Sin loi, man.

17
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,439
Bravo Two-Six...

18
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,819
What's the delay up on point?
You having compass trouble again?

19
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,789
Come on, you...

20
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,184
Get a move on, boy!

21
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,583
Hey, boy, what ya waiting for?

22
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,341
He ain't gonna bite you.

23
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,676
That's a good gook. Good and dead.

24
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,538
252 actual. Move it out. Six says
we're jamming 'em up back there.

25
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,010
Tell that dipshit to get fucked!

26
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,672
Bravo, it's Two-Five.
We're moving out shortly. Out.

27
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,477
What the hell's the matter
with you, Taylor?

28
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,971
- You are one simple sonofabitch!
- I'm sorry, Sergeant.

29
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,937
Get that other cherry up here -
Gardner. And the doc.

30
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,060
Gardner! Doc! Up!

31
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,112
Gardner, Doc, to the front!

32
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,910
Gardner, get your ass up the hill,
you fat fuck!

33
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,077
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

34
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,007
You all right?

35
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,642
Ants. I got ants all over my neck.

36
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:22,232
You got some red ants.
Reds are killers.

37
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,850
Black ants are the worst.

38
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,442
Hurry up, lard-ass!

39
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,902
I'm so tired.

40
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,242
Just a little. Don't drink too much.

41
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,991
I don't want you drinking any more.
I don't want you cramping up.

42
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:45,667
You're humping too much stuff, troop.
You don't need half this shit.

43
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:51,257
I'll haul it for you, but next time
you check with me first, all right?

44
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,882
OK. Thanks, Sarge.

45
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,436
Are you OK?

46
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,194
<i>Two-Two, this is Six.</i>

49
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:26,964
re-supply helo is inbound
at this time. Over.

50
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,801
Let's go, you people!
Get that ammo off now!

51
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,601
Let's move it!

52
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,930
It ain't D-E-R-E, it's D-E-A-R,

53
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:22,969
and "Sarah" ain't got no two Rs, King.
Damn, you dumb!

54
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:26,390
It don't make no difference.
She know what I mean.

55
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,609
She don't read too good nohow!

56
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,781
Look at this shit! Pork again!

57
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,987
Let me have that turkey loaf
for this pork shit. I can't eat this shit!

58
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,282
What you been smoking, Junior?

59
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,660
I hope you don't get that laundry gig.
I hope Manny get it,

60
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,500
cos your ass need to hump,
hump and hump!

61
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:54,459
Hey, white boy... what you waiting for?
That hole ain't gonna dig itself.

62
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:59,506
Come on, get your dick-skin on that thing!
Dig! You ain't got all day! Dig! Dig!

63
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:05,347

<i>I hate it already and it's only been a week.
Some goddamn week, Grandma.</i>

<i>We get up at 5am, hump all day,

<i>dig a foxhole, eat,</i>

71
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:37,542
<i>then put out an all-night ambush

72
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,764
<i>It's scary cos nobody tells me
how to do anything, cos I'm new.</i>

73

<i>Nobody cares about new guys.

We got boo-coo movement.

82
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,398
Third Battalion just got hit
15 kliks north of here.

83
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:36,602
Charlie had claymores in the trees,
blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces.

84
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,530
Bad shit.

85
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,706
Yeah. They got two lieutenants
and a captain.

86
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,828
All right, Sergeant,
who do you want on ambush?

87
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,334
Elias... you take your squad out.

88
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,631
Warren, you stay in, but I'll need
Tex and Junior from your squad.

89
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,177
- Roger that.
- OK, move out in two-zero mikes.

90
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:08,265
- I thought it was O'Neill's turn.
- No! Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

91
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,772
Fu Sheng's on an R and R tomorrow, and
you wanna send them out on an ambush?

92
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,141
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

93
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:19,738
They don't know shit, and chances are
we're gonna run into something.

94
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,573
What do you want me to do?

95
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,156
Send one of my guys to get zapped, so
some lame-ass can get his beauty sleep?

96
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,700
O'Neill...

97
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,912
Take a break! You don't have to
be a prick every day of your life!

98
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,378
Elias, get your men ready.

99
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,128
He's in three years and thinks
he's Jesus fucking Christ!

100
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:45,843
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in,
but you go out. I need veterans out there.

101
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,430
Sergeant Barnes.

102
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:57,561
I think, in front of the men,
it's necessary for me to give the orders.

103
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,691
Yes, sir.

104
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,535
Shit, looks like it's gonna rain.

105
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,748
It's gonna piss on us all night.

106
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,752
I'm gonna put a serious case of crotch-rot
on that ugly face of yours, Junior.

107
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:23,302
Goddamn, man! You break your ass for
the white man! No justice around here!

108
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,844
What's O'Neill got?
A nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

109
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,512
How come
we always get fucking ambush?

110
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,679
Cos it's politics, man, politics.

111
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,724
- Chris, show you a picture of Lucy Jean?
- No, you didn't.

112
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,979
She's the one for me all right,
that Lucy Jean.

113
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:45,822
- She's waiting for me.
- Real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

114
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,193
Hey, you got a picture of your girl?

115
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,029
I guess that leaves some unlucky girl
back at home, don't it?

116
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,663
Tuck this in.

117
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,415
Shitcan this.

118
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,631
Don't need this. Turn around.

119
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,045
Come on.

120
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,549
Tex, you got Junior and Taylor here
on your position.

121
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,511
Goddamn it, Elias,
don't mess with my pig!

122
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:17,437
I ain't getting greased, so you keep
this sorry cheese-dick off my ass!

123
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:21,516
You got Taylor. Gardner, you're with me.

124
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:28,023
Look, case anything happens, you get lost
or separated, don't yell out, OK?

125
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,323
Just sit tight and we'll get to you.

126
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,496
Saddle up! Lock and load!

127
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,502
<i>Mom and Dad
didn't want me to come here.</i>

128
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,891
<i>They wanted me to be like them:
Respectable, hard-working, a family.</i>

129

be anonymous like everybody else,</i>

131
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,692

132
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:55,741
<i>Live up to what Grandpa did in the
first war, and Dad did in the second.</i>

133
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,494
<i>Well, here I am, anonymous,</i>

134
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,460
<i>with guys nobody really cares about.</i>

135
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:05,916
<i>Most come from the end of the line,
small towns you never heard of.</i>

136

Brandon, Mississippi.</i>

137

<i>Pork Bend, Utah.
Wampum, Pennsylvania.</i>

138

<i>Two years' high school's about it.</i>

139
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,726
<i>If they're lucky, a job waiting for them
back in a factory. Most have got nothing.</i>

140
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,931
<i>They're poor. They're the unwanted.</i>

141
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,897
<i>Yet they're fighting
for our society and our freedom.</i>

142
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:30,156
<i>It's weird, isn't it? At the bottom
of the barrel, and they know it.</i>

143
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:35,822
<i>Maybe that's why they're called "grunts",
cos a grunt can take it, can take anything.</i>

144
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:39,655
<i>They're the best I've ever seen,
Grandma. The heart and soul.</i>

Taylor...

146
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,210
Cheese-dick, you're up.

147
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,380
- What?
- You're up.

148
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,967
Sure you know how to work
the claymores, dude?

149
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,218
Flick the safety off
and bang on that sucker three times.

150
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,976
I got it.

151
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:10,520
Don't catch any Zs on me, buddy,
or I'll sling your sorry ass. You hear me?

152
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,831
<i>Maybe I've finally found it
way down here in the mud.</i>

153
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,250
<i>Maybe from here I can start up again.</i>

154
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:32,588
<i>Be something I can be proud of
without having to be a fake human being.</i>

155
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:38,176
<i>Maybe I can see something I don't yet
see, or learn something I don't yet know.</i>

156
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,511
<i>I miss you. I miss you very much.</i>

157
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:45,228
<i>Tell Mom I miss her, too. Chris.</i>

158
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,243
Junior.

159
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:15,293
- All right, motherfucker!
- It's your shift, man.

160
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,971
Here, take this.

161
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,429
Blow the fucking claymore!
Take the safety off, goddamn it!

162
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,596
Take the safety off!

163
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,617
Feed me, Junior!
Get over here and feed me!

164
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,083
My fucking arm!

165
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,807
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Easy, Tex! Easy, boy!

166
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,973
I can't even see!

167
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,641
- Doc, Gardner's hit!
- Right there!

168
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,687
I'm hit!

169
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,814
Taylor's hit!

170
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,861
- How bad is it?
- Dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore!

171
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:13,496
Relax, man, it's a scratch.
Hold this on here.

172
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,285
Don't lie to me, Doc. How bad is it?

173
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,455
He let 'em walk right up on us!
He was sleeping on his shift!

174
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,415
No, I did not.

175
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,926
Big Harold, keep an eye on him.
Don't let him go into shock.

176
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,342
Shut up! Shut up and take the pain!

177
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:29,512
Take the pain!

178
00:22:55,667 --> 00:23:01,006
Hey, little guy... you're gonna be OK.
Don't worry.

179
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,707
Big Harold,

180
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,882
do you know if...

181
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,467
if you're gonna die?

182
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,018
Do you feel like everything's
just gonna be fine?

183
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,808
Don't gimme that morbid bullshit!
You're about to get outta here.

184
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:22,313
They're gonna give you three hot meals
a day... White sheets...

185
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:26,109
Them pretty white nurses'll give you
blow jobs if you pay 'em enough!

186
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,406
- I heard about them white bitches!
- Don't babytalk him!

187
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:33,235
The cocksucker fell asleep!
He let 'em walk up on us!

188
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:35,411
Just shut up, Junior.

189
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,249
You relax, OK, man?

190
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,378
It's not so bad...

191
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,381
Dying...

192
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,050
How long...

193
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,261
How long...

194
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,809
Come on, bird's on the way, man.
Hang in there. You're gonna make it!

195
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:11,113
Come on, Gardner, hang in there.

196
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,698
Come on...! Don't quit!

197
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:17,951
Come on, help me! Don't give up!

198
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:54,577
Y'all take a good look at this lump of shit.

199
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,747
Remember what it looks like.

200
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:04,497
You fuck up in a firefight and I goddamn
guarantee you a trip out of the bush,

201
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,669
in a body bag!

202
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,045
Out here, assholes, you keep
your shit wired tight at all times!

203
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:17,805
And that goes for you, shit-for-brains!

204
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:22,015
You don't sleep on no fucking ambush!

205
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:26,773
And the next sonofabitch I catch
copping Zs in the bush,

206
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:31,813
I'm personally gonna take
an interest in seeing him suffer.

207
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,988
I shit you not.

208
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:37,911
Doc... tag him and bag him!

209
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:42,581
I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant.

210
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,749
- It was Junior...
- Shut your face, chicken-shit!

211
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,705
You in big trouble, boy!

212
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:49,923
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor -
everybody got one.

213
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,090
Knock it off!

214
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,846
We got two men need attention here.

215
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:03,561
Police up your extra ammo and frags.
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.

216
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,099
Junior,

217
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,692
Tony,

218
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:09,857
carry Gardner.

219
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:16,158
The man would be alive if he had
a few more days to learn something.

220
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:48,316
- Hey, Taylor, what's in the breeze?
- Got light duty. Three days' worth.

221
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:51,775
No shit!
Too bad we're in base camp, anyway.

222
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,398
What you got? Beers?

223
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,610
Stole me some from the Top's supply.
Shit, he been stealing it from us.

224
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:02,910
- Are you back?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

225
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,957
King, where did you get those beers, boy?

226
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:09,667
- I found it.
- You're going on report, son.

227
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:13,379
Both of you, come with me.
I got a little job for you.

228
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,888
Motherfucker!

229
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:30,392
I'm too short for this shit, man!

230
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:35,104
They're always fucking with us...
no let-up!

231
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:38,773
Politics, man. Fucking politics.

232
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:44,745
That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far up
Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio!

233
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:50,579
39 and a wake-up, a pause for the cause,
and I'm a gone motherfucker!

234
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:54,331
- Back to the world!
- Broke 100 the other day.

235
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:58,049
- No shit!
- 92 left to go. April 17.

236
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,093
DEROS, man. Home to California.

237
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:05,137
I'm gonna be sitting outside,
checking out the babes on the beach.

238
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,638
The surfing's gonna be good!

239
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,014
March, man, in Tennessee.

240
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:16,187
Sniff the pines... sniff that
cross-mounted pussy down by the river!

241
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,314
Hot damn!

242
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:22,742
Hey, Taylor, how long have you got left?
300 and what?

243
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,280
32.

244
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:28,121
332 days.

245
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,373
Sin loi, my boy!

246
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:34,452
I can't even remember
when I was 332, man!

247
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:41,339
You gotta, like, count backwards.
You got 40 days in. Think positive, dude.

248
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:45,054
Taylor, how the fuck
you get here, anyway?

249
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,935
- You look educated.
- I volunteered.

250
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,137
- You did what?
- I volunteered.

251
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:55,563
I dropped out of college, told 'em
I wanted the infantry, combat, Vietnam.

252
00:28:55,694 --> 00:29:00,320
- You volunteered for this shit, man?
- Can you believe that?

253
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:04,317
You's a crazy fucker... giving up college.

254
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:07,537
Didn't make much sense.
I wasn't learning anything.

255
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:12,622
Why should just the poor kids go off to
war and the rich kids get away with it?

256
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:17,331
- What we got here is a crusader.
- Sounds like it.

257
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:22,884
You gotta be rich in the first place
to think like that.

258
00:29:23,806 --> 00:29:26,094
Everybody know...

259
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:33,346
the poor always being fucked over
by the rich. Always have, always will.

260
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:40,318
You be cool, I introduce you round
to some of the heads.

261
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:44,527
- What are the heads?
- Later, man!

262
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,247
What's up, brother?

263
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:01,090
Your Highness has arrived!
Hey, what's happening?

264
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:05,346
I thought you was hanging ten
in Cambodia!

265
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,931
- What you doing here, Taylor?
- This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot.

266
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:21,769
This man here is Chris.
He been resurrected.

267
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,205
Go ahead, Taylor.

268
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,416
- What?
- Are you lame or something?

269
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,920
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

270
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,685
Your shit's in the wind, troop!

271
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:02,734
If you do that baa,
you'd better do it right.

272
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:06,028
You're weird, man.

273
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,661
You're a child, Lerner.
I don't waste time on you.

274
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:23,173
- First time?
- Yeah.

275
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:29,546
Then the worm has definitely turned
for you, man.

276
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,508
Feel good?

277
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:36,138
Yeah, it feels good.
I got no pain in my neck now.

278
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,356
Feeling good's good enough.

279
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,074
Put your mouth on this.

280
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,929
Where the hell is everybody, man?
They getting high, that's what.

281
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:20,763
Bunch of hopheads.
They think they're special!

282
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:24,399
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

283
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:30,032
Redneck noise, dude, that's all it is.
Make about as much sense as you do.

284
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:33,527
All them chucks be rappin'
about how they losing their ho,

285
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:37,494
saying how they ain't got
no bread for beer.

286
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:43,211
Fuck that honky shit!
Gimme some Motown jams - dig it?

287
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:46,043
What are you talking shit for, man?

288
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:49,460
- Junior, you ever smoke any shit?
- That's right, dude!

289
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:53,094
Y'all be trying to keep the black man
down and string him out on that shit.

290
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:57,007
The time be's coming, my man,
when the black man throw that yoke off.

291
00:32:57,144 --> 00:33:00,145
Simple - free your mind,
your ass will follow.

292
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:05,942
I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit,
everything kinda gets weird.

293
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,904
You hear that story about the gooks
putting chemicals in the grass?

294
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:11,652
So we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

295
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,654
Don't you worry, Bunny.
You's a killer anyway, man.

296
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:17,491
I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

297
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:20,992
Ain't nothing like a piece of pussy,
'cept maybe the Indy 500.

298
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:25,124
Only way you'd get some pussy is if
a bitch dies and wills it to you and then...

299
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:26,749
maybe!

300
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,050
How's it going, Bunny?

301
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,674
LT,

302
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:36,846
check it out.

303
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:42,385
- Like that?
- Terrific. I'll send it home.

304
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:46,316
Hey, Junior.

305
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:49,527
- Lieutenant.
- Hello, sir.

306
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:00,034
Hey, Rodriguez,
that's quite a shrine you got there.

307
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,743
Thank you, sir.

308
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,868
You... need anything?

309
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:06,042
No, sir.

310
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:09,705
This guy's three, four times my size.

311
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:14,803
I got him in the O'Neill death grip.
He don't know whether to shit or go blind!

312
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,302
- Whaddaya say, LT?
- How ya doing, Red?

313
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:20,599
Not good. This cocksucker's got
every card in the deck.

314
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:23,978
- Full house.
- Look like you're doing all right!

315
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:26,775
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

316
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,483
Hey, Lieutenant,
some Kentucky windage?

317
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,652
Thanks, Sandy.

318
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,067
Play, Lieutenant?

319
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,699
Nah. Wouldn't wanna get raped
by you guys.

320
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:44,452
Why's that, Lieutenant?
What are you saving up to be? Jewish?

321
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,501
Jewish!

322
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:53,707
I gotta run. I'II, uh, catch you men later.
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

323
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:04,645
Well, that is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

324
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:10,314
What do you say there, Bob?
Guy like that make it? Yes or no?

325
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,645
That's precisely what I saw.

326
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,573
Sometimes I just look at a guy
and I know this fella's not gonna make it.

327
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,741
Just no fucking way.

328
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,662
Get it going now!

329
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,097
<i>New Year's Day, 1968.</i>

330
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:31,438
<i>Just another day. Staying alive.</i>

331
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:36,312
<i>There's been a lot of movement
near the Cambodian border.</i>

332
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,818
<i>A lot of little firefights, ambushes.</i>

333
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:45,236
<i>We drop bombs, then we walk through
the jungle like ghosts in a landscape.</i>

334
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,259
Bunker.

335
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,931
Where?

336
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:38,841
<i>Roger. Bunkers at point.
Two actuals on the way.</i>

337
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:24,469
Bravo Six, Bravo Two. Be advised
there is a bunker complex up front.

338
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:27,301
<i>We're on the way down. Over.</i>

339
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,849
See you next week!

340
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:55,411
Taylor, get your ass up on that flank -
about 50 metres.

341
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:58,379
Washington, you cover this side.

342
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:02,170
- Yes, sir.
- Get off your ass, Harold.

343
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:03,296
Bummer!

344
00:39:55,479 --> 00:40:02,098
Christ, look at that, will ya? The teapot's
still boiling! They were just here!

345
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:06,020
Man, this is spooky, Sander.
Let's get outta here.

346
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,110
Watch it... watch it!

347
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:37,243
Look what we got, Sal.
We got maps,

348
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:41,581
we got...

349
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,248
This is gook stuff!
Let's get outta here!

350
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:48,508
No, Sal, this is important.

351
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,801
Come on, let's go!

352
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:58,675
Booby trap! Get down!

353
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:05,096
Medic!

354
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,687
Holy jeez!

355
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,501
Goddamn it!

356
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,630
We got two men down, sir.

357
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:36,889
There was an explosion.
Listen, we need help, sir, ASAP.

358
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:40,716
Move your ass outta here!
One round could get all you guys!

359
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:42,928
Rodriguez, Junior, let's go!

360
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:47,809
Lieutenant... tell Six we need engineers.
This pos is crawling with traps.

361
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:52,272
On their way. The NVA have been spotted
in the village half a klik down the river.

362
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:54,564
Six says we gotta get there ASAP.

363
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,409
Also, leave four of your men here,
and a medic, OK? Move it out.

364
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:26,021
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

365
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:30,776
Hey, where's Manny?

366
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:33,773
Yo, Washington!

367
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:40,987
Manny, where you at?

368
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:09,229
<i>We had to get to the village
before dark,</i>

369
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,058
<i>so we left Elias with some men
to keep looking.</i>

370
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:15,104
<i>But it was King who found him,</i>

371
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:20,399
<i>about a thousand yards downriver,
not far from the village.</i>

372
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:26,790
<i>It was the end of the mystery.</i>

373
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:59,028
The motherfuckers!

374
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:10,244
<i>The village which had stood
for maybe 1,000 years</i>

375
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:14,457
<i>didn't know we were coming that day.
If they had, they would've run.</i>

376
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:20,083
<i>Barnes was at the eye of our rage
and, through him, our Captain Ahab.</i>

377
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,348
<i>He would set things right again.
That day we loved him.</i>

378
00:45:29,729 --> 00:45:31,769
There he goes, Sarge!

379
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:40,529
- Check him out.
- Yeah, you got it, Sarge.

380
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:43,409
Tubbs, Ebenhock, let's go!

381
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:48,747
Get that stupid look off your face!

382
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,119
Hey, piggy, piggy! Hey, pig!

383
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,298
Bunny, clear the hooches now!

384
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:05,216
Spread out on the right!
Watch your back!

385
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:07,388
Let's go! Let's move 'em out!

386
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:17,060
- Move it!
- Come on, let's go!

387
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:22,235
Let's go, Junior! Bring 'em in!
Get those people down here!

388
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:29,072
Get outta there, you fuckheads! Move!

389
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:46,261
Come on!

390
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:51,351
Put 'em in the pig pen!

391
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:56,771
Give me your willie pete!

392
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:03,986
Fire in the hole!

393
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:20,498
Get 'em outta here!

394
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:22,708
Oh, fuck! We got one!

395
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:28,596
Get the fuck outta the hole!

396
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:31,393
Get the fuck outta there!
Come on, motherfucker!

397
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:33,843
Be cool. They're scared, man.

398
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:36,600
They're scared? What about me, man?

399
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:41,228
I'm sick of this fucking shit!
Come on, motherfucker! Move!

400
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:42,820
Watch this fucker!

401
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:48,106
Who the fuck do you think
they're fighting for? Got one more!

402
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,205
What have we here?

403
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,759
We got one, two, three, four mag 58
Czechoslovakian machine guns.

404
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:12,094
Barnes, they got enough rice here
to feed a whole fucking regiment.

405
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:17,014
Sergeant Warren,
you bring that honcho over here.

406
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:20,397
Tubbs, get outta there.
Junior, burn it.

407
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,943
What the fuck's the matter?
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

408
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:25,731
Look like I was gonna fucking hurt you?

409
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:29,613
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?
Why didn't you fucking listen to me?

410
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:33,112
Fucking stupid? You stupid asshole!

411
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:37,458
Get the fuck up here! Come here,
motherfucker! What are you smiling at?

412
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:40,035
Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?

413
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,499
Do 'em, man!

414
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,916
What are you smiling at?
You want something to smile at?

415
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:50,136
Dance, motherfucker!

416
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:57,386
Dance, one-legger!

417
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:02,524
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

418
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,239
Come on. Let's go, man.

419
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,084
Fucking pussy, man!
He's laughing at you!

420
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:23,619
That's the way the gook laughs.

421
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:27,420
Yeah, sure you are!
You're real sorry, ain't ya?

422
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,880
You're just crying your little hearts out
about Sandy and Sal, and Manny!

423
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:34,884
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

424
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:37,682
Whaddaya say?

425
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:02,326
Holy shit! Did you see
that fucking head come apart, man?

426
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:06,043
I never seen brains like that before, man!

427
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:11,670
I bet you the old bitch runs
the whole fucking show.

428
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:16,181
She probably cut Manny's throat.
Probably cut my balls off if she could.

429
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:21,184
We leave now, and nobody saw a fucking
thing! You understand me, Taylor?

430
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:24,764
Let's fucking do her!
Let's do this whole fucking village!

431
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:30,856
Look at the scars
on this gook honcho, Sarge.

432
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,029
Get out of here, Tubbs.

433
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:45,585
Where'd he get these wounds?

434
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:53,627
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid.
- He's a dink for sure!

435
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:58,014
Ask him why these weapons were here.

436
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:04,678
They had no choice. The NVA killed
the old honcho when he said no.

437
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:08,647
- All the rice is theirs.
- Bullshit, Lerner!

438
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:13,819
Who the hell was the gook
we nailed on the riverbank?

439
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:22,283
He doesn't know. He says NVA ain't
been around in a couple of months.

440
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,417
- Maybe it was a scout or something.
- Yeah, sure, a scout!

441
00:51:25,544 --> 00:51:31,380
What about the fucking rice and
the weapons? Who are they for?

442
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:34,379
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying.

443
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:36,800
Goddamn right he does!

444
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,299
- He's lying through his teeth!
- Waste the fucker!

445
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:43,637
Where the hell's the VC?

446
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:52,152
He swears he doesn't know anything.
He hates the NVA, but...

447
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,735
What's the bitch saying?

448
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,356
She's going on about
why we killed the pigs.

449
00:51:57,492 --> 00:52:00,493
They gotta make a living. All that shit.

450
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:11,372
Shut up!

451
00:52:11,506 --> 00:52:13,084
Shut the fuck up!

452
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:42,530
You tell him, he starts talking
or I'm gonna waste more of 'em!

453
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:44,702
Tell him, Lerner!

454
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,754
Hey, Sarge! Let us in on this, all right?

455
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:00,840
Let's go for it!
Let's do the whole fucking village!

456
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:04,972
Come on!
What the fuck are we waiting for?

457
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:10,560
- Let's do 'em!
- Outta my way!

458
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:15,694
This is his daughter, right? Right?

459
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:27,613
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

460
00:53:36,174 --> 00:53:37,373
Barnes!

461
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:49,303
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

462
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:55,316
Stay outta this, Elias.
This ain't your show.

463
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:58,943
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

464
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:07,287
Tear his fucking head off!

465
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,091
Break it up!

466
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:30,304
Break it up!

467
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:36,811
You're dead, Elias!
I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

468
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:40,395
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

469
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:43,200
This shit won't wash, you fucking puke!

470
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:46,077
Break it up! Shut up!

471
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:49,239
Break it up! Listen up!

472
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:51,946
Captain says to torch this place!

473
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:55,203
Torch this place!
Blow the weapons in place!

474
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:58,254
Round up all suspected VC
and shake it up!

475
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:01,418
- We ain't got much light left!
- Lieutenant...

476
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:05,086
- Why didn't you do something?
- What are you talking about?

477
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:07,677
You know what I'm talking about!

478
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:13,597
No, I don't. I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about, Elias!

479
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:19,687
All right, move it out! Let's go!

480
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,108
Taylor, let's go, for Christ's sake!

481
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,367
Move it out! Police up the weapons,
and let's go!

482
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:03,443
Fire in the hole!

483
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:15,204
Fire in the hole!

484
00:56:59,836 --> 00:57:02,125
Hey, come on! Morehouse!

485
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:05,375
You fucker! Get outta here!
Get the fuck off!

486
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:09,092
Don't do it! Don't do it! You fucker!

487
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:11,260
What is this?

488
00:57:15,894 --> 00:57:19,809
- What, you a homosexual, Taylor?
- Taylor, she's a fucking dink!

489
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,727
She's a fucking human being, man!

490
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,145
- Fuck you!
- You're a fucking cherry, Taylor!

491
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,980
Fucking animal!
All of you, you're fucking animals!

492
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:32,406
Fucking lame fuck!

493
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:35,027
You don't belong in Nam, man!
Ain't your place at all!

494
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:38,746
You don't fucking get it, do you, man?

495
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,710
You just don't fucking get it.

496
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:43,876
It's OK.

497
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:49,713
Get outta there!

498
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,177
Police up your dicks
and let's get outta here.

499
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,483
- I didn't see anything, sir.
- I did.

500
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:57,370
That dink was reported to me as NVA.

501
00:58:57,496 --> 00:59:01,196
My report will include Lieutenant Wolfe
as being witness to the shooting.

502
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,741
All right, Elias.

503
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,498
Staff Sergeant Barnes.

504
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,714
I want a full report on this
when we get back to the CP.

505
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:13,969
You got it, and I can throw in
plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.

506
00:59:14,096 --> 00:59:16,551
Not now, goddamn it, not now!

507
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:23,479
We'll get into this when we get to camp.
If I find out there was an illegal killing,

508
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,681
there will be a court martial.

509
00:59:25,816 --> 00:59:30,774
Right now I need every man in the field.
And you two will cease fire.

510
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:33,312
Staff Sergeant Barnes, Sergeant Elias...

511
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:35,484
You hear me?

512
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:40,078
We're back in that NVA bunker complex
tomorrow. This time from the east.

513
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:44,832
You people get some rest and be back
here at the CP at 1900 for a briefing.

514
00:59:51,467 --> 00:59:53,293
Come on, man.

515
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:56,381
You think these chucks
give a fuck about us?

516
00:59:56,513 --> 01:00:00,558
It could just as well have been you,
Harold, if you got in Barnes' way.

517
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:06,438
And that Bunny? That motherfucker's
crazy! I mean, he scares me, man.

518
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,479
He just scares me.

519
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,694
You bloods are getting
too hung up on all this shit.

520
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:17,530
These gooks are smarter than you think.
Barnes knows his shit, man.

521
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:21,324
They was NVA, every last one of 'em.

522
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:25,702
He's taken us this far, right?
He'll take us the rest of the way.

523
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:30,629
A Christian don't go around a village
cutting off heads and shit.

524
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:34,172
This shit is really getting outta hand, man.

525
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:37,302
You don't seem to know the difference,

526
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,181
the way you shoot up
that shit all the time.

527
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:44,010
I don't know, brothers,

528
01:00:44,144 --> 01:00:47,928
but I'm hurting real bad inside.
