1
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:46,404


2
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,210
Oh, man! ls that what l think it is?

3
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,184
All right, cheesedicks. Welcome to the Nam. Follow me.

4
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,525
l'll be dipped in shit. New meat!

5
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:25,735
You dudes gonna love the Nam. For-fucking-ever.

6
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:30,469
365 and a wake-up. Oh, lord.

7
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:43,451


8
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,452


9
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,433
Watch it below!

10
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,133
Morehouse, drop back to slack.

11
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:13,168
Who's on tail-end Charlie?

12
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:29,087
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six, Pos rep follows,'

13
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:32,420
Lemur, Alpha, Whiskey, Alpha, Foxtrot...,

14
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:36,092
Warren, you get out on flank.

15
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,235
-Hey, Hoffmeister! -Yo?

16
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:40,504
You got a smoke?

17
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:43,740
-No, man, l don't. -Sin loi, man.

18
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:47,037
Bravo 2-6. What's the delay on point?

19
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,745
Having compass trouble again?

20
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,471
Get a move on, boy.

21
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,336
Boy, what you waiting for?

22
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:54,043
He ain't gonna bite you.

23
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,846
That's a good gook. Good and dead.

24
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:26,408
-Cherry. -Yo, cherry!

25
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:31,444
Move it out. Six says we're jamming them up back there. Over.

26
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:34,378
Tell that dipshit to get fucked.

27
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,418
This is 2-5. Be advised. We're moving out shortly. Out.

28
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:40,988
What's the matter with you, Taylor?

29
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,323
You are one simple son of a bitch.

30
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:44,960
l'm sorry, sergeant.

31
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:48,665
Get that other cherry up here. Gardner. And the doc.

32
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,866
Gardner, doc, up!

33
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,694
Gardner, doc, to the front!

34
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,803
Gardner, get your ass up the hill, you fat fuck!

35
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:02,171
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

36
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,724
-You all right? -Ants.

37
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:24,125
l got ants all over my neck.

38
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:28,071
You got some red ants.

39
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:32,066
Reds are killers. Black ants are the worse.

40
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,940
Hurry up, lard-ass!

41
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:38,806
l'm so tired!

42
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,645
Just a little.

43
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:46,116
Don't drink too much. l don't want you drinking any more.

44
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,619
l don't want you cramping up.

45
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,292
You're humping too much stuff.

46
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:52,597
You don't need half this shit.

47
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,796
l'll haul it for you.

48
00:07:56,602 --> 00:08:00,003
But next time check with me first, all right?

49
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:02,367
Thanks, sarge.

50
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:11,216
-Are you okay? -Yeah.

51
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:24,387
2-2, this is six, I understand you have a bird inbound at your pos,

52
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,566
Bravo Six, be advised.

53
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:33,838
Resupply helo is inbound at this time, Over,

54
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:40,746
Go, you people! Get that ammo off now!

55
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:25,852
lt ain't D-E-R-E. lt's D-E-A-R.

56
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:29,958
And Sarah ain't got no two R's, King. Damn, you dumb!

57
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:33,396
Don't matter. She know what l mean.

58
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,860
She don't read too good nohow.

59
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:44,702
Look at this shit! Pork again!

60
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:49,708
Trade me that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man. l can't eat this shit.

61
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,380
What you been smoking?

62
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:57,285
l hope you don't get that laundry gig. Your ass need to hump, hump.

63
00:09:57,656 --> 00:10:00,022
Hey, white boy! What you waiting for?

64
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:02,316
That hole won't dig itself.

65
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:05,027
Come on. Get your dick skin on that thing!

66
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:07,662
You ain't got all day! Dig, dig!

67
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:13,237
Somebody once wrote, ''Hell is the impossibility of reason, ''

68
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:16,370
That's what this place feels like,' hell,

69
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,833
I hate it already, and it's only been a week,

70
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,476
Some goddamn week, Grandma,

71
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:26,247
The hardest thing I've ever done is go on point three times this week,

72
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:28,176
I don't know what I'm doing,

73
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:31,854
A gook could be right in front of me and I wouldn't know it,

74
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,748
I'm so tired,

75
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,291
We get up at 5,'00 a,m...

76
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:41,362
...hump all day, camp around 4 or 5, dig a foxhole, eat...

77
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:45,261
...then put out an all-night ambush or a listening post,

78
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:48,198
Nobody tells me how to do anything because I'm new,

79
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:52,777
Nobody cares about the new guys, They don't want to know your name,

80
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:57,674
A new guy's life isn't worth much because he hasn't put his time in yet,

81
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:02,613
If you're gonna get killed in Nam, it's better to get it in the first weeks,

82
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:05,686
The logic being, you don't suffer that much,

83
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:08,050
If you're lucky, you stay in the perimeter...

84
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:12,592
...then pull a guard shift, so you sleep three or four hours,

85
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:14,194
But you don't really sleep,

86
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:24,707
I don't think I can keep this up for a year,

87
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:26,738
I've made a big mistake coming here,

88
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,777
We got beaucoup movement.

89
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:39,256
3rd Battalion got hit 1 5 klicks north of here.

90
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:41,583
Charlie had claymores strung in the trees.

91
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:45,954
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit.

92
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,471
Got two lieutenants and a captain.

93
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:54,966
Jesus.

94
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,039
All right, who do you want on ambush?

95
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:02,239
Elias, you take your squad out.

96
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:07,543
Warren, stay in, but l need Tex and Junior from your squad.

97
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:08,581
Roger.

98
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:11,082
Move out in 2-0 mikes.

99
00:12:11,423 --> 00:12:14,358
l thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

100
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,160
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

101
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:20,728
Fu Sheng is going on R and R tomorrow. You want to send them out on ambush?

102
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,829
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

103
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:27,536
They don't know shit and we'll probably run into something. Think about it.

104
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:29,771
Great. What do you want me to do?

105
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:34,306
Get one of my guys zapped so a lame ass can get his beauty sleep?

106
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,612
Hey, O'Neill...

107
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,314
...take a break.

108
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:40,881
You needn't be a prick every day.

109
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:42,813
Elias, get your men ready.

110
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,058
Guy's in 3 years, thinks he's Jesus Christ.

111
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:50,485
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out.

112
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:52,592
l need veterans out there.

113
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:55,527
Sergeant Barnes?

114
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:04,903
l think in front of the men, l need to give the orders.

115
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,109
Yes, sir.

116
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:16,450
Shit, looks like rain.

117
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:19,189
lt's gonna piss on us all night.

118
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:24,657
lt'll put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours.

119
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:29,532
Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man.

120
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:31,233
No justice around here.

121
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,165
What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

122
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:37,407
Why do we always get fucking ambush?

123
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,574
Because it's politics, man. Politics.

124
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:45,683
-Did l show you a picture of Lucy Jean? -No, you didn't.

125
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:48,914
She's the one for me all right, that Lucy Jean.

126
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:50,846
She's waiting for me too.

127
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,681
She's real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

128
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:55,960
You got a picture of your girl?

129
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:59,560
That leaves some unlucky girl back home, don't it?

130
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,695
Tuck this in.

131
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:05,400
Shit-can this.

132
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:09,271
Don't need this. Turn around.

133
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:13,800
Come on.

134
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,446
Tex! You got Junior and Taylor here on your position.

135
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:20,342
Elias, don't mess with my pig.

136
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:25,351
l ain't getting greased tonight. Keep this cheesedick off my ass.

137
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:26,749
You got Taylor.

138
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:28,992
Gardner, you're with me.

139
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:33,458
ln case anything happens to you, you get lost or separated...

140
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,029
-...don't yell out, okay? -Okay.

141
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:38,392
-Just sit tight and we'll get to you. -All right.

142
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,104
Saddle up! Lock and load!

143
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,493
Mom and Dad didn't want me to come here,

144
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:40,389
They want me to be just like them,'

145
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,759
Respectable, hard-working, a little house, a family,

146
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:49,471
They drove me crazy with their goddamn world, Grandma, You know Mom,

147
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,575
Having always been sheltered and special...

148
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,438
...I want to be anonymous like everyone else,

149
00:15:57,783 --> 00:15:59,307
Do my share for my country,

150
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:02,984
Live up to what Grandpa did in the first war, Dad in the second,

151
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:06,383
Well, here I am, Anonymous, all right,

152
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:09,193
With guys nobody really cares about,

153
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:11,721
They come from the end of the line,

154
00:16:12,064 --> 00:16:13,793
Small towns you never heard of,

155
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:17,158
Polaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi,

156
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:20,403
Pork Bend, Utah, Wampum, Pennsylvania,

157
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:23,003
Two years high school's about it,

158
00:16:23,342 --> 00:16:25,970
If they're lucky, a job waiting for them in a factory,

159
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:27,869
Most of them got nothing,

160
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,976
They're poor and unwanted...

161
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:32,875
...yet they're fighting for our society and freedom,

162
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:37,387
It's weird, They're the bottom of the barrel, and they know it,

163
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:40,188
Maybe that's why they call themselves grunts,

164
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:43,722
Because a grunt can take it, can take anything,

165
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:47,520
They're the best I've ever seen, Grandma, The heart and soul,

166
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:52,362
Hey, Taylor?

167
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:55,198
Hey, cheesedick, you're up.

168
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,303
-What? -You're up.

169
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,947
-Sure you can work the claymores? -l'm sure.

170
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:06,450
Flick the safety off and bang on it three times.

171
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:08,310
Three times. l got it.

172
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:16,484
Don't catch any Z's on me, or l'll sling your sorry ass! Hear me?

173
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,090
Okay.

174
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:32,699
Maybe I finally found it way down here in the mud,

175
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,146
Maybe from down here I can start up again,

176
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,577
Be something I can be proud of without faking it, Be a fake human being,

177
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:45,456
Maybe I can see something I don't yet see, learn something I don't yet know,

178
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:49,527
I miss you, I miss you very much,

179
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,261
Tell Mom I miss her too, Chris,

180
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:11,573
Junior.

181
00:18:18,757 --> 00:18:21,692
-All right, motherfucker. -lt's your shift, man.

182
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:27,522
Here, take this.

183
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:11,919
Blow the fucking claymore!

184
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:12,662
Take the safety off! Damn it!

185
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,192
Take the safety off! Damn it!

186
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:21,071
Get the safety off!

187
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:33,206
Feed me, Junior! Get over here and feed me!

188
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,732
-Jesus-fucking-Christ! -Easy, boy.

189
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,545
-Doc, Gardner's hit! -Right there!

190
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,944
Oh, shit. l'm hit!

191
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,847
Doc, Taylor's hit! Taylor's hit!

192
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,487
-Oh, shit. -Doc, doc!

193
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:15,819
How bad is it?

194
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:17,753
He didn't blow his claymore!

195
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:21,327
Relax, man. lt's a scratch. Hold this on here.

196
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,190
Don't lie. How bad is it?

197
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:26,401
He let them walk right up on us! He was asleep on his shift!

198
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:28,367
No, l did not.

199
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:30,504
Big Harold, keep an eye on him.

200
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:32,469
Don't let him go into shock.

201
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:33,708
Shut up!

202
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:37,446
Shut up and take the pain. Take the pain!

203
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:50,654
Red rag, red rag, bravo six, I have NDPs at this time, Over,

204
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:06,436
Hey, little guy, you're gonna be okay.

205
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:08,938
Don't worry.

206
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,983
Do you know if you're gonna die?

207
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,749
Do you feel it'll all be fine?

208
00:23:21,092 --> 00:23:23,890
No morbid bullshit. You're about to get out of here.

209
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:30,100
They're gonna give you three hot meals a day. White sheets.

210
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:33,869
Pretty white nurses will give you blow jobs if you pay them.

211
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:37,265
-l heard about them white bitches. -Don't baby talk him.

212
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:41,170
The cocksucker fell asleep. He let them walk right up on us!

213
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:43,208
Just shut up, Junior.

214
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:46,150
You relax. Okay, man?

215
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:51,512
lt's not so bad...

216
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,852
...dying.

217
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,951
How long?

218
00:23:58,363 --> 00:24:00,194
How long?

219
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,832
Bird's on the way. Hang in there. You'll make it.

220
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:18,810
Come on, Gardner, hang in there. You're gonna make it!

221
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:21,548
Come on. Don't quit.

222
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:25,816
Come on, Gardner, help me. Don't give up!

223
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:01,788
You all take a good look at this lump of shit.

224
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:05,863
Remember what it looks like.

225
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:12,295
You fuck up in a firefight and l guarantee you a trip out of the bush...

226
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:14,338
...in a body bag.

227
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,907
Out here, assholes, you keep your shit wired tight at all times.

228
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:24,112
That goes for you, shit-for-brains.

229
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:28,876
You don't sleep on no fucking ambush.

230
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:34,754
The next son of a bitch l catch copping Z's in the bush...

231
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:38,187
...l'm personally gonna make him suffer.

232
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:41,792
l shit you not.

233
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:46,093
Tag him and bag him.

234
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:49,930
l didn't fall asleep, sergeant.

235
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:52,676
-lt was Junior. -Shut up, chickenshit.

236
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,706
You're in big trouble, boy.

237
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:57,913
Excuses are like assholes. Everybody's got one.

238
00:25:58,249 --> 00:25:59,716
Knock it off!

239
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:04,715
We got two men need attention here.

240
00:26:06,157 --> 00:26:08,625
Police up your extra ammo and frags.

241
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:11,327
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.

242
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,065
Carry Gardner.

243
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:23,699
Man would be alive if he had a few more days to learn something.

244
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:51,900
Hey, Taylor.

245
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,135
What's in the breeze?

246
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:56,030
Got light duty. Three days' worth.

247
00:26:56,374 --> 00:26:59,707
No shit. Too bad we're in base camp anyway.

248
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,170
What you got? Beers?

249
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:05,108
Stole some from the Top's supply. Shit, he's been stealing it from us.

250
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:08,984
What are you, back?

251
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,550
Yeah, it looks like it.

252
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,585
Where'd you get the beers, boy?

253
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:14,789
l found it.

254
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:17,651
Found it? You're going on report, son, now.

255
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:21,295
Both of you, come with me. l got a job for you.

256
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,604
Motherfucker!

257
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:37,974
l'm too short for this shit, man.

258
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,948
They're always fucking with us.

259
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,583
No letup.

260
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:44,916
Politics, man.

261
00:27:45,256 --> 00:27:46,723
Fucking politics.

262
00:27:47,058 --> 00:27:52,155
That O'Neill's got his nose so far up Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio.

263
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:54,395
Thirty-nine and a wake-up.

264
00:27:54,732 --> 00:27:57,496
A pause for the cause and l'm a gone motherfucker.

265
00:27:58,937 --> 00:28:00,632
-Back to the world. -l hear you.

266
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,906
l broke a hundred the other day.

267
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:07,108
Ninety-two left to go. April 1 7th.

268
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:09,276
Home to California.

269
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:13,209
l'll be sitting outside checking out the babes on the beach.

270
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,816
The surfing's gonna be good.

271
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:19,318
March, man, in Tennessee.

272
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:24,026
Sniff the pines. Sniff that pussy down by the river.

273
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:25,954
Hot damn!

274
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:29,456
Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?

275
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:32,400
-Three hundred and what? -Thirty-two.

276
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:36,134
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

277
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:38,305
Sin loi, my boy.

278
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:42,304
l can't even remember when l was 332, man.

279
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:46,947
You gotta count backwards or something, like you got 40 days in.

280
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,242
Think positive, dude.

281
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:54,483
How in the fuck did you get here anyway? You look educated.

282
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:57,090
-l volunteered for it. -You did what?

283
00:28:57,428 --> 00:28:58,395
l volunteered.

284
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:03,292
l dropped out of college and told them l wanted infantry, combat, Vietnam.

285
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:06,330
You volunteered for this shit, man?

286
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:08,265
Can you believe that?

287
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:11,498
You is a crazy fucker, giving up college.

288
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,440
lt didn't make much sense. l wasn't learning anything.

289
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,183
Why should the poor kids go to war and the rich kids get away with it?

290
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:22,513
What we got here is a crusader.

291
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:26,286
-Sounds like it. -Shit.

292
00:29:27,358 --> 00:29:30,293
You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that.

293
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:33,162
Everybody knows...

294
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,561
...the poor's always fucked over by the rich.

295
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:40,529
Always have, always will.

296
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:48,209
lf you be cool, l'll introduce you to some of the heads.

297
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:50,013
What are the heads?

298
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,113
Later, man.

299
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:00,488
What's up, brother?

300
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:08,288
Your Highness has arrived. What's happening?

301
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:12,966
l thought you was hanging ten in Cambodia.

302
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:23,610
Why are you in the underworld?

303
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:28,612
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This is Chris. He been resurrected.

304
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:39,855
You lame, Taylor?

305
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:41,995
Are you lame or something?

306
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:45,796
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

307
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,884
Your shit's in the wind, troop.

308
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:05,712
Hey, man. What's happening?

309
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:08,287
lf you do that ''baa,'' you do it right.

310
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:13,730
You're weird, man.

311
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:17,229
You're a child. l don't waste time on you.

312
00:31:28,212 --> 00:31:30,407
-First time? -Yeah.

313
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:35,918
Then the worm has definitely turned for you, man.

314
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:39,153
Feel good?

315
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:43,255
Yeah, it feels good. l got no pain in my neck now.

316
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:46,695
Feeling good's good enough.

317
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:59,535
Put your mouth on this.

318
00:32:20,765 --> 00:32:23,029
Where the hell is everybody, man?

319
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:28,134
They're getting high. Bunch of hopheads. They think they're special.

320
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,600
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

321
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,337
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

322
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,910
Make about as much sense as you do.

323
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:41,375
All them chucks be rapping about how they losing their ho...

324
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:44,450
...saying how they ain't got no bread for beer.

325
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:49,682
Fuck that honky shit! Gotta get me some Motown jams, dig it?

326
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:53,655
What are you talking that shit for?

327
00:32:53,998 --> 00:32:55,829
Junior, you ever smoke any shit?

328
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,064
That's right.

329
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:00,962
You trying to keep the black man down and string him out on that shit.

330
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,831
But the time's coming when the black man will throw that yoke off.

331
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:07,940
Simple. Free your mind, your ass will follow.

332
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:13,281
Yeah, l can dig it, man. You smoke that shit and everything gets weird.

333
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,579
You hear about gooks putting chemicals in the grass...

334
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:19,321
...so we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

335
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:22,592
But don't you worry, Bunny, you's a killer anyway.

336
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,487
But l still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

337
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,890
Nothing like a piece of pussy, except maybe the lndy 500.

338
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:32,828
Only way you get pussy is if the bitch dies and wills it to you...

339
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:34,296
...and then maybe.

340
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,372
How's it going, Bunny?

341
00:33:41,178 --> 00:33:42,167
L.T.

342
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:43,771
Check it out.

343
00:33:46,384 --> 00:33:47,442
You like that?

344
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,245
Terrific.

345
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,982
l'll send it home.

346
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:53,220
Hey, Junior.

347
00:33:54,358 --> 00:33:56,326
-Lieutenant. -Hello, sir.

348
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:07,802
Rodriguez, that's quite a shrine you have.

349
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,434
Thank you, sir.

350
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,306
-You need anything? -No, sir.

351
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:15,243
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

352
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:17,610
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

353
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:19,644
He's in the O'Neill death grip.

354
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:22,579
He doesn't know whether to shit or go blind.

355
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,184
-What do you say, L.T.? -How you doing, Red?

356
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:28,458
Not good. This cocksucker has every card in the deck.

357
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:29,953
Full house.

358
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:31,859
You're doing all right.

359
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,664
Yeah, and l ain't even cheating yet.

360
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:39,732
-Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage? -Oh, thanks, Andy.

361
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,328
Play, lieutenant?

362
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,473
No. Wouldn't want to get raped by you guys.

363
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:49,644
Why's that, lieutenant? What are you saving up to be?

364
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:50,879
Jewish?

365
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:58,014
l gotta run.

366
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:01,581
l'll catch you men later. Enjoy yourselves tonight.

367
00:35:08,432 --> 00:35:11,401
That is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

368
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:17,198
What do you say there, Bob? A guy like that make it? Yes or no?

369
00:35:19,276 --> 00:35:21,437
l have to say that's precisely what l saw.

370
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:26,113
Sometimes l just look at a guy, and l know he's not going to make it.

371
00:35:26,684 --> 00:35:28,208
Just no fucking way.

372
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,617
New Year's Day, 1 968,

373
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:39,179
Just another day, Staying alive,

374
00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:44,051
Lots of movement near the Cambodian border, NVA regiments moving across,

375
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:46,693
A lot of little firefights, ambushes,

376
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:51,525
We drop bombs, then we walk through the jungle like ghosts in a landscape,

377
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:13,313
Bunker.

378
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:15,549
Where?

379
00:37:36,614 --> 00:37:40,243
Bravo 2, Bravo 2-5, I've got beaucoup bunkers up here, Over,

380
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:46,654
2-5, 2, Roger, Bunkers at point, Two actuals on the way, Over,

381
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:32,429
Bravo 6, Bravo 2, Be advised there is a bunker complex up front,

382
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:35,135
We're on our way down, Over,

383
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,206
See you next week.

384
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:03,155
Taylor, get your ass up on that flank, about 50 meters.

385
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:05,900
Washington, you cover this side.

386
00:39:06,503 --> 00:39:08,232
-Yes, sir. -Get off your ass, Harold.

387
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:09,436
Shit.

388
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:11,203
Bummer!

389
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:08,291
Christ, look at that. The teapot's still boiling. They were just here!

390
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,734
Man, this is spooky, Sander. Let's get out of here.

391
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,415
Watch it, watch it!

392
00:41:41,754 --> 00:41:43,312
Look what we got, Sal.

393
00:41:43,822 --> 00:41:45,483
We got maps.

394
00:41:47,426 --> 00:41:48,654
We got...

395
00:41:49,261 --> 00:41:52,162
-...S-2 stuff. -That's the gooks' stuff. Let's go!

396
00:41:52,531 --> 00:41:55,125
No, Sal, this is important. This is important.

397
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:02,072
Come on. Let's go.

398
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:05,637
Booby trap! Get down!

399
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:12,975
Medic!

400
00:42:16,388 --> 00:42:17,787
Holy gee!

401
00:42:32,604 --> 00:42:34,367
Goddamn it.

402
00:42:39,578 --> 00:42:42,308
We got two men down, sir. There was an explosion.

403
00:42:42,614 --> 00:42:44,809
This-- We need help, sir. ASAP.

404
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,449
Move your ass out of here! One round to get you all!

405
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:50,778
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

406
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:52,090
Lieutenant.

407
00:42:52,991 --> 00:42:55,789
Tell 6 we need engineers. This pos is full of traps.

408
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:57,059
They're coming.

409
00:42:57,429 --> 00:43:00,262
NVA were seen at a village half a klick down the river.

410
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,294
Now, 6 says to get there ASAP.

411
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:05,797
Also, leave four of your men here and a medic.

412
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:07,264
-All right. -Move it out.

413
00:43:31,063 --> 00:43:33,725
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

414
00:43:36,134 --> 00:43:37,328
Hey, where's Manny?

415
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:48,876
Manny, where you at?

416
00:44:15,274 --> 00:44:17,174
We had to reach the village before dark,

417
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:17,770
We left Elias and some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers,

418
00:44:19,745 --> 00:44:21,212
We left Elias and some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers,

419
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,004
But it was King who found him...

420
00:44:23,348 --> 00:44:26,784
...about 1 000 yards downriver, not far from the village,

421
00:44:31,657 --> 00:44:33,386
It was the end of the mystery,

422
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,315
The motherfuckers.

423
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:20,169
The village, which was maybe 1 000 years old, didn't know we were coming,

424
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:22,370
If they had, they would have run,

425
00:45:23,008 --> 00:45:27,877
Barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him, our Captain Ahab...

426
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,909
...who would set things right again,

427
00:45:30,248 --> 00:45:32,409
That day, we loved him,

428
00:45:37,856 --> 00:45:39,346
There he goes, sarge.

429
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:48,693
-Pick him up. -Yeah, you got it, sarge.

430
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:50,893
Let's go.

431
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:55,940
Get that stupid look off your face!

432
00:45:57,776 --> 00:45:59,767
O'Neill, clear out these hooches.

433
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:02,444
Hey, piggy-piggy. Hey, pig.

434
00:46:07,786 --> 00:46:10,084
Bunny, you've got to bring the hooches down.

435
00:46:10,422 --> 00:46:14,586
Spread out on the right. Watch your back. Let's go!

436
00:46:16,194 --> 00:46:17,718
What do you got here, huh?

437
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:22,464
Get over there! Move it!

438
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:24,268
Come on, let's go!

439
00:46:25,404 --> 00:46:27,463
Let's go, Junior, bring them in.

440
00:46:34,112 --> 00:46:36,603
Get out of there, you fuckheads! Move!

441
00:46:52,397 --> 00:46:53,455
Come on!

442
00:46:56,468 --> 00:46:58,834
-Put them in the pigpen! -Get over here.

443
00:47:00,472 --> 00:47:02,406
Get back! Shut up!

444
00:47:02,741 --> 00:47:04,436
Give me your willie pete.

445
00:47:08,313 --> 00:47:09,507
Get back!

446
00:47:09,981 --> 00:47:11,846
Fire in the hole!

447
00:47:22,894 --> 00:47:24,020
Shut up!

448
00:47:26,732 --> 00:47:28,199
Get them out of here!

449
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,632
Oh, fuck! We got one.

450
00:47:34,973 --> 00:47:36,497
Get the fuck out of the hole!

451
00:47:36,842 --> 00:47:39,242
Get out of there. Come on, motherfucker!

452
00:47:39,544 --> 00:47:41,705
Be cool! Be cool! They're scared, man!

453
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:44,675
Oh, they're scared, huh? What about me, man?

454
00:47:45,016 --> 00:47:48,645
l'm sick of this fucking shit! Come on, motherfucker, move!

455
00:47:49,354 --> 00:47:50,719
Watch this fucker!

456
00:47:51,056 --> 00:47:53,616
Who the fuck do they think we're fighting for?

457
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:56,223
-You got one more! -Hey, hey!

458
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,097
Well, what have we here?

459
00:48:06,538 --> 00:48:11,601
They have one, two, three, four Mag 58 Czechoslovakian machine guns.

460
00:48:11,943 --> 00:48:13,706
They got two, four....

461
00:48:15,013 --> 00:48:19,382
Barnes, they got enough rice here to feed a whole fucking regiment.

462
00:48:21,853 --> 00:48:25,016
Sergeant Warren, you bring the honcho over here.

463
00:48:25,357 --> 00:48:28,292
Tubbs, get out of there! Junior, burn it!

464
00:48:29,027 --> 00:48:31,757
What the fuck's the matter? l wasn't gonna hurt you!

465
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,688
Look like l was gonna hurt you?

466
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:37,523
Why didn't you listen to me?! Why didn't you fucking listen to me?!

467
00:48:38,203 --> 00:48:40,899
Fucking stupid?! You stupid asshole!

468
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:44,037
Get the fuck up here! Come here, motherfucker!

469
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:48,073
What are you smiling at?! Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?!

470
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,369
Do them, man!

471
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:53,382
What are you smiling at?! You want something to smile at, huh?!

472
00:48:53,718 --> 00:48:56,186
-You want something to smile at?! -That's right!

473
00:48:56,521 --> 00:48:58,011
-Dance, motherfucker! -Yeah!

474
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,388
Dance, one-legger!

475
00:49:03,762 --> 00:49:05,923
Dance! Dance!

476
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:10,427
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

477
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:19,944
Come on. Come on, let's go, man.

478
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:28,374
Fucking pussy, man! He's laughing at you!

479
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,181
That's the way the gook laughs.

480
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,055
Yeah, sure you are!

481
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:35,359
You're real sorry, ain't you?

482
00:49:35,694 --> 00:49:39,721
You're just crying your little hearts out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

483
00:49:40,098 --> 00:49:42,794
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

484
00:49:43,668 --> 00:49:44,692
What do you say?

485
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:09,252
Holy shit! You see that fucking head come apart, man?

486
00:50:10,495 --> 00:50:13,089
l never seen brains like that before, man.

487
00:50:16,635 --> 00:50:19,604
l bet you the old bitch runs the whole fucking show.

488
00:50:19,938 --> 00:50:24,136
She probably cut Manny's throat. Probably cut my balls off if she could.

489
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:26,603
Bunny, we leave now, nobody saw a thing!

490
00:50:26,912 --> 00:50:28,436
You understand, Taylor?

491
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:30,976
Come on, let's fucking do her! Let's do the whole fucking village!

492
00:50:34,419 --> 00:50:37,286
There's scars on this gook honcho, sarge.

493
00:50:39,257 --> 00:50:40,781
Get out of here, Tubbs.

494
00:50:50,669 --> 00:50:52,227
Where did he get these wounds?

495
00:50:57,075 --> 00:51:00,340
-Says he was hit in a bombing raid. -He's a dink for sure.

496
00:51:02,948 --> 00:51:05,109
Ask him why these weapons are here.

497
00:51:08,987 --> 00:51:12,354
They had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.

498
00:51:12,691 --> 00:51:16,252
-He says all the rice is theirs. -Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

499
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:19,586
Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?

500
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:30,106
He doesn't know. The NVA ain't been here in a couple of months.

501
00:51:30,442 --> 00:51:33,343
-Maybe he was a scout. -Yeah, sure. A scout.

502
00:51:33,645 --> 00:51:36,773
What about the rice and the weapons?! Who they for?!

503
00:51:37,749 --> 00:51:39,239
An NVC!

504
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:42,212
That cocksucker knows what l'm saying. Don't you?

505
00:51:42,554 --> 00:51:44,681
Goddamn right he does.

506
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,921
He's lying!

507
00:51:46,257 --> 00:51:48,953
Waste the fucker! Then see who talks.

508
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:51,522
Look, he says he doesn't know anything.

509
00:51:57,202 --> 00:52:00,467
He hates the NVA, but they come when they want and take over.

510
00:52:00,805 --> 00:52:02,067
What's the bitch saying?

511
00:52:02,941 --> 00:52:05,409
She's going on about why we killed the pigs...

512
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:08,406
...they're farmers, they have to make a living....

513
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:18,614
Shut up!

514
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:20,956
Shut her the fuck up!

515
00:52:46,217 --> 00:52:49,812
You tell him to start talking or l'll waste more of them.

516
00:52:50,622 --> 00:52:51,953
Tell him, Lerner!

517
00:52:58,363 --> 00:53:00,422
Let us in on this, all right?

518
00:53:06,004 --> 00:53:08,734
Let's go for it! Let's do the whole fucking village!

519
00:53:09,407 --> 00:53:12,069
Come on, sarge. What the fuck are we waiting for?

520
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,604
-Let's do them! -Out of my way!

521
00:53:20,885 --> 00:53:23,251
This is his daughter, right? Right?

522
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:35,457
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

523
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:45,333
Barnes!

524
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:56,045
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

525
00:54:00,258 --> 00:54:02,351
Stay out of this. lt ain't your show.

526
00:54:03,595 --> 00:54:06,723
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

527
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:09,793
-Get him! -Come on, Barnes!

528
00:54:10,635 --> 00:54:14,298
Get him! Get him! Tear his fucking head off!

529
00:54:21,146 --> 00:54:23,774
Come on, Elias. Send him to hell!

530
00:54:25,517 --> 00:54:28,077
Goddamn it! Come on, break it up!

531
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:32,948
Break it up!

532
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:37,887
Break it up!

533
00:54:39,664 --> 00:54:40,460
Elias, chill.

534
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:44,734
You're dead, Elias! l swear to fucking God, you're dead!

535
00:54:45,103 --> 00:54:48,129
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

536
00:54:48,473 --> 00:54:50,270
This shit won't wash, you puke!

537
00:54:50,608 --> 00:54:53,771
Break it up! Break it up! Shut up!

538
00:54:54,412 --> 00:54:56,778
Break it up! Listen up!

539
00:54:57,515 --> 00:54:59,847
Captain says to torch this place, hear that?

540
00:55:00,185 --> 00:55:01,482
Torch this place!

541
00:55:01,819 --> 00:55:03,116
Blow the weapons in place!

542
00:55:03,721 --> 00:55:07,452
Round up suspected VC and shake it up! We ain't got much light left!

543
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:10,886
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?

544
00:55:11,262 --> 00:55:12,786
What are you talking about?

545
00:55:13,164 --> 00:55:15,530
You know what the fuck l'm talking about.

546
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,098
No, l don't. l don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.

547
00:55:24,976 --> 00:55:27,501
Move it out! Let's go! You heard the lieutenant!

548
00:55:27,812 --> 00:55:32,044
Taylor, let's go, for chrissake! Police up the weapons and let's go!

549
00:55:32,383 --> 00:55:33,577
Come on, Harold.

550
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,012
Fire in the hole!

551
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:22,962
Fire in the hole!

552
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:09,278
Hey, come on.

553
00:57:10,348 --> 00:57:11,906
You fucker! Get out of here!

554
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,913
Get the fuck off! Don't do it! Don't do it!

555
00:57:16,254 --> 00:57:19,348
You fucker! What is this, huh?!

556
00:57:23,928 --> 00:57:24,917
You a homosexual?

557
00:57:25,296 --> 00:57:27,696
What's your problem? She's a fucking dink.

558
00:57:28,066 --> 00:57:31,695
She's a fucking human being, man! Fuck you!

559
00:57:32,036 --> 00:57:34,061
Total fucking cherry, Taylor!

560
00:57:34,405 --> 00:57:37,863
Fucking animal! All of you! You're fucking animals!

561
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:40,040
Fucking lame fuck!

562
00:57:40,345 --> 00:57:42,973
You don't belong in the Nam. This ain't your place.

563
00:57:43,314 --> 00:57:45,509
You don't fucking get it, do you?

564
00:57:46,818 --> 00:57:48,718
You just don't fucking get it.

565
00:57:49,921 --> 00:57:51,115
lt's okay.

566
00:57:55,126 --> 00:57:56,855
Get out of there!

567
00:58:01,065 --> 00:58:03,056
Police up your dicks and let's go.

568
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:02,189
-l didn't see anything, sir. -l did.

569
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,995
Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.

570
00:59:05,363 --> 00:59:08,958
My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

571
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:10,732
All right, Elias.

572
00:59:11,669 --> 00:59:14,035
-Staff Sergeant Barnes. -Sir!

573
00:59:14,372 --> 00:59:17,364
l want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

574
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:21,735
You got a diary. l have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

575
00:59:22,046 --> 00:59:24,310
Not now, goddamn it! Not now!

576
00:59:24,649 --> 00:59:26,640
We'll get into this at the base camp.

577
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:31,250
l can promise you, if l find out there was an illegal killing...

578
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:33,250
...there will be a court-martial.

579
00:59:33,624 --> 00:59:38,721
Right now, l need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

580
00:59:39,096 --> 00:59:42,122
Staff Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Elias. You hear me?

581
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,364
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

582
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:47,865
We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

583
00:59:48,206 --> 00:59:52,802
You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 1 900 for a briefing.

584
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:54,338
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

585
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:04,183
Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

586
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:07,556
lt could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

587
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,924
And that Bunny?

588
01:00:10,595 --> 01:00:12,460
That motherfucker's crazy.

589
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:14,227
l mean, he scares me.

590
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:16,566
He just scares me.

591
01:00:17,401 --> 01:00:19,961
You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

592
01:00:20,638 --> 01:00:23,129
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.

593
01:00:23,474 --> 01:00:25,408
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

594
01:00:25,743 --> 01:00:28,507
They was NVA, every last of them.

595
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:32,211
He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.

596
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:33,482
l don't know, Holmes.

597
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:37,718
A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

598
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:41,822
This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

599
01:00:42,293 --> 01:00:45,091
Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

600
01:00:45,463 --> 01:00:47,761
...the way you always shoot up that shit.

601
01:00:48,766 --> 01:00:50,233
l don't know, brothers...

602
01:00:52,103 --> 01:00:54,298
...but l'm hurting real bad inside.

603
01:00:57,008 --> 01:01:00,102
Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

604
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:01,378
He's a troublemaker.

605
01:01:01,712 --> 01:01:05,273
Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

606
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:09,245
...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

607
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,584
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

608
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:16,852
-Sarge. -Thanks, Bun.

609
01:01:17,995 --> 01:01:19,292
How did it go there, Bob?

610
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:25,658
Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

611
01:01:26,003 --> 01:01:27,971
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

612
01:01:28,306 --> 01:01:31,139
He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

613
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:33,703
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

614
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:37,547
So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

615
01:01:39,216 --> 01:01:40,080
Bob?

616
01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:45,385
O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

617
01:01:51,896 --> 01:01:53,261
lt's a beautiful night.

618
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:55,030
Yeah, l love this place at night.

619
01:01:56,968 --> 01:01:58,333
The stars....

620
01:02:01,105 --> 01:02:05,041
There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

621
01:02:05,977 --> 01:02:07,842
That's a nice way of putting it.

622
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:14,509
Barnes has it in for you, huh?

623
01:02:15,419 --> 01:02:17,717
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

624
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:21,522
And you? Do you believe?

625
01:02:24,862 --> 01:02:27,387
ln '65? Yeah.

626
01:02:29,367 --> 01:02:30,493
Now?

627
01:02:33,304 --> 01:02:34,293
No.

628
01:02:37,742 --> 01:02:40,370
What happened today is just the beginning.

629
01:02:41,946 --> 01:02:43,709
We're gonna lose this war.

630
01:02:44,548 --> 01:02:46,015
Come on.

631
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,910
You really think so? Us?

632
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,582
We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...

633
01:02:52,923 --> 01:02:55,153
...l figure it's time we got ours kicked.

634
01:03:05,903 --> 01:03:08,201
Day by day, I struggle to maintain...

635
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:11,099
...not only my strength, but my sanity,

636
01:03:11,442 --> 01:03:13,000
It's all a blur,

637
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:15,210
I have no energy to write,

638
01:03:15,713 --> 01:03:18,113
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore,

639
01:03:18,716 --> 01:03:22,243
The morale of the men is low, A civil war in the platoon,

640
01:03:22,586 --> 01:03:25,054
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes,

641
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,083
There's a lot of suspicion and hate,

642
01:03:28,492 --> 01:03:32,155
I can't believe we're fighting each other instead of them,

643
01:03:34,432 --> 01:03:38,892
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face, Not much else,

644
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,538
Hope things are well, Grandma,

645
01:03:41,872 --> 01:03:43,703
Tell Mom and Dad I--

646
01:03:44,175 --> 01:03:47,508
Well, just tell them, Chris,

647
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:13,436
Hey, big boy. l know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out.

648
01:04:13,804 --> 01:04:17,137
Hell, l gotta paint myself white just to get one of those jobs.

649
01:04:17,475 --> 01:04:21,434
Got my request in for a circumcision. l'm getting my big ass out of here.

650
01:04:21,746 --> 01:04:23,714
What are you gonna do, become a rabbi?

651
01:04:24,048 --> 01:04:25,037
Leech.

652
01:04:29,754 --> 01:04:32,086
All right! Move it out!

653
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:38,287
Don't drink that, asshole. You're gonna get malaria.

654
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:40,123
Yeah, l hope so.

655
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:42,298
Let's go.

656
01:05:20,037 --> 01:05:22,335
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

657
01:05:28,412 --> 01:05:29,879
Sergeant, Warren's hit!

658
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:35,916
-What's going on? -They got RPGs, man!

659
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:38,915
lt's an ambush! They were just waiting for us here!

660
01:05:39,256 --> 01:05:41,224
-Who's on point? -Lerner and Warren.

661
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:43,049
Where are you going?!

662
01:05:46,964 --> 01:05:50,695
Goddamn it, you assholes! Get some firepower up there!

663
01:05:51,035 --> 01:05:51,899
Right!

664
01:06:01,512 --> 01:06:03,173
Watch out! Rockets!

665
01:06:11,555 --> 01:06:13,216
Where the fuck is Lerner?

666
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:16,082
He's over there! By the log!

667
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:43,443
Fire mission. Grid: 6-4-9-4-0-2.

668
01:06:43,787 --> 01:06:46,722
Direction: 6-1 -0--

669
01:06:47,224 --> 01:06:48,418
Adjust fire. Over.

670
01:06:50,895 --> 01:06:53,523
Lieutenant, they'll get in tight under the arty!

671
01:06:54,231 --> 01:06:57,997
l saw a cut. Let me take some men and roll up that flank.

672
01:06:58,335 --> 01:07:02,431
Get Barnes! Elias, we got four down. What do you want me to do?

673
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:08,268
Where the fuck is Red Platoon?! Tell those assholes to get up here!

674
01:07:09,046 --> 01:07:11,207
Elias, what are you doing back here?

675
01:07:11,548 --> 01:07:15,780
There's holes back here, 3rd Platoon's coming up here, we're here!

676
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:19,089
Dinks get in these holes, we'll be in a crossfire.

677
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,983
-We'll shoot each other. -Sounds far-out to me.

678
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:25,390
l've seen it happen. la Drang in '66.

679
01:07:25,763 --> 01:07:28,231
They cut us to pieces. l need three men.

680
01:07:28,565 --> 01:07:29,862
You got them! Take off!

681
01:07:30,768 --> 01:07:33,293
You keep pouring off that cover fire.

682
01:07:33,637 --> 01:07:37,403
l don't want to be stuck out there with my ass hanging in the breeze.

683
01:07:37,741 --> 01:07:40,403
You don't tell me how to run my war, Elias.

684
01:07:40,711 --> 01:07:44,044
You go crying to fucking brigade on your own time.

685
01:07:44,381 --> 01:07:47,316
Out here you belong to me! Now, move!

686
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:49,118
You're an asshole, Barnes.

Get that asshole O'Neill up here!

688

-You okay? -Don't leave me, man.

700
01:10:07,057 --> 01:10:08,922
-You all right? -Don't leave me, man.

701
01:10:09,259 --> 01:10:13,355
-Hey, Gator, you'll be okay, man. -Don't leave me, man.

702
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:15,698
Gator? Gator, you'll be okay.

703
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:16,930
Let him go, man.

704
01:10:17,267 --> 01:10:20,964
-Drop your rucks. -Taylor, you're coming with us.

705
01:10:22,606 --> 01:10:23,834
Please don't go.

706
01:10:24,174 --> 01:10:25,664
You're gonna be okay.

707
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:27,741
Come on.

708
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:30,171
Doc, take care of him, man.

709
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:35,475
Redleg, Redleg. Ripper Bravo 2 actual.

710
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:38,754
Adjustment follows: Bridge....

711
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:42,420
You ignorant asshole!

712
01:10:42,759 --> 01:10:44,852
What the fuck coordinates are you giving?

713
01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:48,892
You wasted a lot of people up there with your fucked-up fire mission!

714
01:10:49,233 --> 01:10:50,598
Do you know that?

715
01:10:51,869 --> 01:10:54,667
Do you know that? Ah, shit!

716
01:10:56,373 --> 01:10:57,237
Redleg! Redleg! Ripper Bravo 2.

01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,652
They're coming.

719
01:11:17,794 --> 01:11:21,890
Stagger yourself across this line. Shoot anything that moves.

720
01:11:22,599 --> 01:11:24,464
They'll be coming from over there.

721
01:11:25,636 --> 01:11:28,969
Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.

722
01:11:29,506 --> 01:11:30,996
Where the hell are you going?

723
01:11:31,675 --> 01:11:34,769
Down by the river about 1 00 meters...

724
01:11:35,078 --> 01:11:36,568
...in case they try to flank us.

725
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:39,508
3rd Platoon is coming behind us. Watch for them.

726
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:41,540
Hey. Can l go with you?

727
01:11:42,486 --> 01:11:45,387
No. l move faster alone.

728
01:11:54,298 --> 01:11:56,391
Let's let arty do a bit of the work.

729
01:11:56,767 --> 01:11:59,565
Tell everyone to pull back to the church...

730
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:02,997
...and link up with 3rd Platoon. You got that?

731
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:06,675
What about Elias? lf we pull back, he'll be cut off.

732
01:12:06,977 --> 01:12:09,912
You just haul ass too, lieutenant.

A lung, babe. You got two of them fuckers.

741
01:13:12,442 --> 01:13:14,933
Where's Elias? A bunch of gooks came through here.

742
01:13:15,245 --> 01:13:17,042
-We got three of them fuckers. -Hey!

743
01:13:17,381 --> 01:13:19,315
The arty shifted. We're pulling back.

744
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,548
Get your wounded man and get the fuck back to church.

01:15:39,022 --> 01:15:40,580
Taylor, where are you going?

752
01:16:50,126 --> 01:16:51,388
Elias is dead.

753
01:16:52,128 --> 01:16:53,720
Fall back with the platoon.

754
01:16:54,231 --> 01:16:55,129
Get going.

755
01:16:55,465 --> 01:16:56,489
He's dead?

756
01:16:57,234 --> 01:16:59,566
Yeah, he's back there about 1 00 meters.

757
01:16:59,903 --> 01:17:01,632
You saw him? Where?

758
01:17:02,005 --> 01:17:05,805
He's dead! There's gooks all over the goddamn place! Get moving!

759
01:17:20,457 --> 01:17:22,982
Let's go! Come on, move it!

Let's go! Move it! Okay, let's go!

You okay, Harold? You're on the next one! You're okay, bud!

762
01:19:17,078 --> 01:19:17,942
Oh, fuck!

They've got Elias!

764
01:19:23,084 --> 01:19:23,914
What?

765
01:19:31,158 --> 01:19:32,819
Back down! Back down there!

766
01:19:39,533 --> 01:19:43,299
Snake 1-9, Fly 4, There's still one of the men down there,

767
01:20:08,162 --> 01:20:10,187
Hold your arms, Guns, hold off,

768
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,384
He killed him.

769
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:14,127
l know he did. l saw his eyes when he came in.

770
01:21:14,695 --> 01:21:17,994
How do you know the dinks didn't get him? You got no proof.

771
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:20,630
Proof's in the eyes. When you know, you know.

772
01:21:20,968 --> 01:21:23,027
You saw. l know what you were thinking.

773
01:21:23,371 --> 01:21:24,895
l say we frag him tonight.

774
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:27,207
l go with that. An eye for an eye.

775
01:21:28,209 --> 01:21:31,303
l say let military justice do the job on him.

776
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,171
Come on, fuck the military justice! Are you joking me?

777
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:39,509
Whose story you think they'll believe? O'Neill's? Bunny's? Bullshit!

778
01:21:39,854 --> 01:21:43,915
You try that, Barnes will shove it back up your ass, with a candle on it.

779
01:21:44,258 --> 01:21:45,919
What do you suggest we do?

780
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:51,254
Watch your own asses. Barnes will be coming down on all of them.

781
01:21:51,599 --> 01:21:54,762
You gonna forget about Elias? All the good times we had here?

782
01:21:55,102 --> 01:21:58,663
Shit, you trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.

783
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,341
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him.

784
01:22:03,277 --> 01:22:06,838
And if there's a heaven, and God, l hope there is...

785
01:22:07,181 --> 01:22:11,845
...he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit...

786
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,821
...because he left his pains down here.

787
01:22:15,156 --> 01:22:18,387
You're wrong! Anyway you cut it, Barnes is a murderer!

788
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:20,660
-Right on. -Taylor...

789
01:22:21,796 --> 01:22:26,199
...when you first came in here, you told me how you admired the bastard.

790
01:22:26,534 --> 01:22:30,732
-l was wrong. -You've never been right about nothing!

791
01:22:31,939 --> 01:22:34,237
Dig this, you assholes, and dig it good.

792
01:22:35,643 --> 01:22:38,476
Barnes been shot seven times, and he ain't dead.

793
01:22:38,813 --> 01:22:40,678
Does that mean anything to you?

794
01:22:41,649 --> 01:22:43,412
Barnes ain't meant to die.

795
01:22:44,819 --> 01:22:48,220
The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.

796
01:22:49,023 --> 01:22:50,650
Talking about killing?

797
01:23:03,370 --> 01:23:04,837
You all experts?

798
01:23:07,308 --> 01:23:09,003
You all know about killing?

799
01:23:10,478 --> 01:23:12,912
Well, l'd like to hear about it, potheads.

800
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:23,279
You smoke this shit to escape from reality?

801
01:23:26,227 --> 01:23:28,058
Me, l don't need this shit.

802
01:23:34,768 --> 01:23:36,497
l am reality.

803
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:46,502
There's the way it ought to be, and there's the way it is.

804
01:23:50,751 --> 01:23:52,309
Elias was full of shit.

805
01:23:54,421 --> 01:23:56,218
Elias was a crusader.

806
01:23:57,892 --> 01:24:01,828
Now, l got no fight with any man who does what he's told.

807
01:24:02,429 --> 01:24:03,828
But when he don't...

808
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:05,893
...the machine breaks down.

809
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:11,031
And when the machine breaks down, we break down.

810
01:24:12,273 --> 01:24:14,207
l ain't going to allow that.

811
01:24:14,909 --> 01:24:16,171
From any of you.

812
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:18,872
Not one.

813
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:37,459
You all love Elias.

814
01:24:42,903 --> 01:24:44,962
You want to kick ass.

815
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:54,210
Well, here l am. All by my lonesome.

816
01:24:57,151 --> 01:24:59,142
And ain't nobody gonna know.

817
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:07,326
Six of you boys against me.

818
01:25:13,834 --> 01:25:14,926
Kill me.

819
01:25:33,053 --> 01:25:34,987
l shit on all of you.

820
01:25:37,825 --> 01:25:39,793
You motherfucker!

821
01:25:46,033 --> 01:25:47,227
Come on, man.

822
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:49,462
Get him, Chris.

823
01:25:53,907 --> 01:25:56,137
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man!

824
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:58,705
You'll go dinky dau in LBJ, man.

825
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:02,014
Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years.

826
01:26:02,349 --> 01:26:04,078
Climb the fucking walls, man.

827
01:26:06,687 --> 01:26:08,154
Don't do it.

828
01:26:26,607 --> 01:26:27,665
Death?

829
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,800
What do you all know about death?

830
01:26:45,893 --> 01:26:48,361
They sent us baCk into the valley the next day...

831
01:26:48,696 --> 01:26:52,427
...about 2000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter,

832
01:26:52,766 --> 01:26:55,599
It felt like we were returning to the sCene of a Crime,

833
01:27:30,237 --> 01:27:33,729
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable forCe,

834
01:27:34,074 --> 01:27:36,338
Charlie Company had been probed that night,

835
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:39,672
There were other battalions in the valley...

836
01:27:40,013 --> 01:27:42,880
...but we knew we were the bait to lure them out,

837
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:47,779
Somewhere out there was the entire 1 4 1 st NVA regiment,

838
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:09,705
Caught them trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.

839
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:12,045
They found maps on them, man.

840
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:17,080
Got a friend at Battalion, says they had every foxhole here fixed on.

841
01:28:17,384 --> 01:28:21,821
Distances, tree lines, our claymores, everything.

842
01:28:22,156 --> 01:28:23,714
This is bad, man.

843
01:28:24,792 --> 01:28:28,489
-l got bad vibes here. -l also heard we're in Cambodia now.

844
01:28:28,829 --> 01:28:31,389
Cambodia? Man, you're kidding me.

845
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:33,860
You wanted to see me, sir?

846
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:38,832
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

847
01:28:39,173 --> 01:28:43,041
Squad? l didn't know we were still referring to this platoon as squads.

848
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:47,710
l want you to take those two holes, right there and there.

849
01:28:48,015 --> 01:28:50,813
Tie it off with Barnes up here and King down there.

850
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,147
Begging your pardon, sir...

851
01:28:54,688 --> 01:28:58,124
...my two holes are so far apart, a regiment could run between them.

852
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,016
l have five live bodies left.

853
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,887
l don't want to hear your problems. You'll get new men any day.

854
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:05,858
Make do like everybody else.

855
01:29:06,266 --> 01:29:08,632
-l didn't ask for this. -l don't want to hear it.

856
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:11,164
-You don't want to hear it? -That's right.

857
01:29:11,872 --> 01:29:14,807
Because, to tell you the truth, l don't give a shit.

858
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:17,837
l just don't give a flying fuck anymore.

859
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:27,450
l'm glad l ain't going with them.

860
01:29:29,857 --> 01:29:32,826
Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.

861
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:35,291
What a fucking bummer.

862
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:39,860
Ten days and a wake-up, and l'm still dealing with this shit.

863
01:29:43,437 --> 01:29:45,029
What's the matter with you?

864
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,564
Why ain't you writing nobody?

865
01:29:48,375 --> 01:29:49,865
What about your folks?

866
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:52,769
That grandma you told me about?

867
01:29:55,415 --> 01:29:56,347
Girl?

868
01:29:59,419 --> 01:30:00,716
You got parents, don't you?

869
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:02,879
There must be somebody.

870
01:30:04,091 --> 01:30:05,820
No, there's nobody.

871
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:09,893
You been smoking too much of this shit.

872
01:30:12,299 --> 01:30:14,767
Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

873
01:30:15,802 --> 01:30:19,670
l remember when you first come out here to the bush, you's green as--

874
01:30:20,807 --> 01:30:24,299
You ever get caught in a mistake you just can't get out of?

875
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:27,244
There's a way out of anything.

876
01:30:28,015 --> 01:30:30,984
Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry...

877
01:30:31,351 --> 01:30:33,216
...and the worm will turn.

878
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:37,713
How many days you short?

879
01:30:39,026 --> 01:30:42,553
lt's not just me. lt's how the whole thing works.

880
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:44,523
People like Elias get wasted.

881
01:30:44,865 --> 01:30:48,562
People like Barnes go on making up all the rules any way they want.

882
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:52,599
So, what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it.

883
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,838
We just don't add up to dry shit.

884
01:30:56,343 --> 01:31:00,939
Whoever said we did? All you got to do is make it out of here...

885
01:31:01,281 --> 01:31:05,581
...and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life. Gravy.

886
01:31:08,956 --> 01:31:10,947
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

887
01:31:12,225 --> 01:31:15,217
Collect up your shit. Your orders just come through.

888
01:31:15,562 --> 01:31:16,859
Man, don't fuck with me.

889
01:31:17,197 --> 01:31:19,791
Oh, what do you need, a written invitation?

890
01:31:20,233 --> 01:31:24,693
Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers done made a mistake!

891
01:31:25,038 --> 01:31:26,505
They cut me some slack!

892
01:31:26,807 --> 01:31:30,504
You got 1 0 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here.

893
01:31:30,877 --> 01:31:32,435
Because if you're not on it...

894
01:31:33,013 --> 01:31:34,310
...l'm gonna be.

895
01:31:35,482 --> 01:31:37,416
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

896
01:31:38,085 --> 01:31:41,418
That's great, King, l'm happy for you. Take it on home for me.

897
01:31:41,755 --> 01:31:44,952
You got my address. You know where to reach me anytime.

898
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:48,019
l gotta di di, Don't want to miss that chopper.

899
01:31:52,332 --> 01:31:54,664
-You okay? -Yeah, l'm okay.

900
01:31:55,535 --> 01:31:56,729
Remember, take it easy.

901
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:59,670
Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool.

902
01:32:00,374 --> 01:32:03,639
Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here.

903
01:32:04,444 --> 01:32:05,672
My man.

904
01:32:13,353 --> 01:32:14,820
l'll walk you out, man.

905
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:21,316
Take it easy, King.

906
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,129
-l'll take it any way l can get it. -l hear you. Later.

907
01:32:25,699 --> 01:32:28,293
l'm pretty fucked up, sarge. Don't touch it!

908
01:32:28,935 --> 01:32:30,800
l gotta get on the chopper, man.

909
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:33,639
-So, what's the problem? -Says he can't walk.

910
01:32:34,508 --> 01:32:36,100
Shit.

911
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:38,242
Martin...

912
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:40,377
...get your boots on.

913
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:47,816
And the next time l catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your feet...

914
01:32:48,155 --> 01:32:50,555
...l'll court-martial your nigger ass.

915
01:32:51,658 --> 01:32:53,649
Then court-martial me, motherfucker!

916
01:32:53,994 --> 01:32:56,326
Bust my ass! Send me to fucking Long Binh!

917
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:58,456
Do your fucking worst!

918
01:32:59,299 --> 01:33:02,200
You white folks got your last klick out of Junior!

919
01:33:03,236 --> 01:33:05,602
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

920
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,805
-Sarge? -Yeah.

921
01:33:08,141 --> 01:33:12,840
That long, hairy, red and black bastard l found in the ammo crate.

922
01:33:14,614 --> 01:33:16,582
l'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch.

923
01:33:16,983 --> 01:33:17,847
l remember now.

924
01:33:19,853 --> 01:33:21,184
Hold up, man!

925
01:33:21,521 --> 01:33:23,250
You just hold up and wait, okay?

926
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:26,115
Fuck it, l'll walk! l'll fucking walk!

927
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:29,054
Fucking pussy! Sarge, l gotta have him in my hole?

928
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:30,556
Yeah.

929
01:33:30,964 --> 01:33:33,524
Bob, l'd like to speak to you a minute.

930
01:33:38,472 --> 01:33:39,962
l can't take it no more.

931
01:33:44,044 --> 01:33:45,011
Yeah, what is it?

932
01:33:45,378 --> 01:33:48,472
Bob, l got Elias' R and R. lt's coming up in three days.

933
01:33:48,815 --> 01:33:51,477
l was thinking about going to Hawaii and see Patsy.

934
01:33:52,052 --> 01:33:54,145
l never asked you for a thing over here.

935
01:33:54,488 --> 01:33:56,456
Well, to be honest with you...

936
01:33:56,790 --> 01:34:00,282
...l was hoping you'd put me on a chopper with King. What do you say?

937
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:02,189
l can't do that for you.

938
01:34:02,529 --> 01:34:05,157
You know we need every swinging dick in the field.

939
01:34:05,499 --> 01:34:08,866
You can talk to me, for chrissake! l'm just asking for three days.

940
01:34:09,202 --> 01:34:11,727
l am talking to you, Red. And l'm telling you no.

941
01:34:12,839 --> 01:34:14,602
Get back in your foxhole.

942
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:18,636
Bob, l've got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

943
01:34:19,246 --> 01:34:21,407
l mean l've got a bad feeling.

944
01:34:22,182 --> 01:34:24,480
l don't think l'm gonna make it out of here.

945
01:34:24,818 --> 01:34:26,683
You understand what l'm saying?

946
01:34:27,888 --> 01:34:30,516
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

947
01:34:38,498 --> 01:34:39,226
Oh, shit!

948
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,114
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

949
01:35:09,396 --> 01:35:11,387
Where's that fucking ambush?

950
01:35:12,098 --> 01:35:16,398
They ain't even waiting till later. lt's fucking coming now, man.

951
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,727
Right fucking now.

952
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:26,909
You know, Junior? Some of the things we done, man...

953
01:35:27,614 --> 01:35:29,844
...l don't feel like we done something wrong.

954
01:35:30,584 --> 01:35:32,176
But sometimes, man...

955
01:35:34,254 --> 01:35:36,188
...l get this bad feeling.

956

957
01:35:41,895 --> 01:35:44,659
You get to do what you want, nobody fucks with you.

958
01:35:45,065 --> 01:35:47,363
The only worry you got is dying.

959
01:35:47,834 --> 01:35:50,064
And if that happens, you won't know about it...

960
01:35:50,403 --> 01:35:52,268

963
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:05,077
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging with Audie Murphy here.

964

Charlie Company reports hand-to-hand, three holes are down. They need help.

1018
01:43:45,445 --> 01:43:48,676
Okay, get two squads from Alpha down there right away. Go, go!

1019

Hey, you two! Where the fuck are you going?

-Come on, Elmo. -Doc, we got wounded here!

1052
01:51:07,253 --> 01:51:09,721
That must have been some fucking fight.

1053
01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:12,557
You alone here, man?

1054
01:51:13,726 --> 01:51:14,693
Yeah.

1055
01:51:15,761 --> 01:51:18,229
Bunch of fucking faggots. They all left me.

1056
01:52:07,413 --> 01:52:11,042
1 22 wounded and still counting.

1057
01:52:11,383 --> 01:52:12,475
Estimate 500...

1058
01:52:12,818 --> 01:52:16,948
...Victor Charlie K.l.A. 22 and still counting. Over.

1059
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:25,497
Taylor! That you?

1060
01:52:26,365 --> 01:52:27,229
Hey, Francis.

1061
01:52:27,566 --> 01:52:30,467
-Hey, man, how you doing? -l'm okay. How you doing?

1062
01:52:30,803 --> 01:52:31,827
Fine, man. Just fine.

1063
01:52:32,171 --> 01:52:35,402
Hey, dig it, we two-timers. We're gonna get out of here, boy.

1064
01:52:35,741 --> 01:52:39,507
l'm gonna see you in the hospital. We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.

1065
01:52:42,982 --> 01:52:44,813
-How you doing? -l'm just fine, sir.

1066
01:52:45,150 --> 01:52:47,175
Good, because you got 2nd Platoon.

1067
01:52:48,754 --> 01:52:49,721
Yes, sir.

1068
01:52:59,999 --> 01:53:01,660
-Ready? -You bet.

1069
01:54:31,123 --> 01:54:33,387
I think now, looking baCk...

1070
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:38,591
...we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves...

1071
01:54:38,931 --> 01:54:41,195
...and the enemy was in us,

1072
01:54:43,502 --> 01:54:45,527
The war is over for me now...

1073
01:54:45,871 --> 01:54:49,671
...but it will always be there the rest of my days,

1074
01:54:50,209 --> 01:54:52,109
As I'm sure Elias will be...

1075
01:54:52,611 --> 01:54:55,944
...fighting with Barnes for, what Rhah Called, possession of my soul,

1076
01:54:58,517 --> 01:54:59,916
There are times sinCe...

1077
01:55:00,285 --> 01:55:04,312
...I have felt like the Child born of those two fathers,

1078
01:55:06,892 --> 01:55:08,723
But be that as it may...

1079
01:55:09,428 --> 01:55:13,023
...those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again,

1080
01:55:13,799 --> 01:55:15,926
To teaCh to others what we know...

1081
01:55:17,336 --> 01:55:19,930
...and to try with what's left of our lives...

1082
01:55:20,272 --> 01:55:24,003
...to find a goodness and meaning to this life,

1083
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:40,757
