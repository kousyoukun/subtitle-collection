好了 新兵 欢迎来到越南 跟我来
All right, cheesedicks. Welcome to the Nam. Follow me.

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,860
你们会很喜欢越南的 永远的
You dudes gonna love the Nam. For-fucking-ever.

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,600
365天
365 and a wake-up. Oh, lord.

7
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,580
1967年9月B连第25队步兵

8
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,580
在柬埔寨边境附近

9
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,560
下面小心
Watch it below!

10
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,260
莫尔豪 走快点
Morehouse, drop back to slack.

11
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,300
查理 谁在队尾
Who's on tail-end Charlie?

12
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,210
总部 这是六队 位置如下…
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six. Pos rep follows.;

13
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,550
L A W A F…
Lemur, Alpha, Whiskey, Alpha, Foxtrot....

14
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,220
华伦 你去队侧
Warren, you get out on flank.

15
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,360
霍梅斯特 什么事
-Hey, Hoffmeister! -Yo?

16
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,630
你有香烟吗
You got a smoke?

17
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,870
没有 没关系
-No, man, I don't. -Sin loi, man.

18
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,160
B26 为何延迟了
Bravo 2-6. What's the delay on point?

19
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,870
又找不到路了吗
Having compass trouble again?

20
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,600
继续走
Get a move on, boy.

21
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,460
你还在等什么
Boy, what you waiting for?

22
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,170
他不会咬你
He ain't gonna bite you.

23
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,540
那是越南兵 死了
That's a good gook. Good and dead.

24
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,540
新兵 新兵
-Cherry. -Yo, cherry!

25
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,570
行动 第六队说我们挡住了他们 完毕
Move it out. Six says we're jamming them up back there. Over.

26
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,510
叫他去见鬼吧
Tell that dipshit to get fucked.

27
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,550
这是第25队 听好 我们很快便出发 完毕
This is 2-5. Be advised. We're moving out shortly. Out.

28
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,120
泰勒 你怎么了
What's the matter with you, Taylor?

29
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,450
你是个大混蛋
You are one simple son of a bitch.

30
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,090
中士 对不起
I'm sorry, sergeant.

31
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,790
叫另外那个新兵过来 嘉勒 还有军医
Get that other cherry up here. Gardner. And the doc.

32
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,990
嘉勒 军医 上前来
Gardner, doc, up!

33
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,820
嘉勒 军医 上前来
Gardner, doc, to the front!

34
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,930
嘉勒 快过来 你他妈的
Gardner, get your ass up the hill, you fat fuck!

35
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,300
大胖子 快点
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

36
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,850
你有没有事 蚂蚁
-You all right? -Ants.

37
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,250
我脖子全都是蚂蚁
I got ants all over my neck.

38
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
这些是红蚂蚁
You got some red ants.

39
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,190
红蚂蚁是杀手 黑蚂蚁最可怕
Reds are killers. Black ants are the worse.

40
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,070
快点 混球
Hurry up, lard-ass!

41
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:43,930
我很累
I'm so tired!

42
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,770
只喝一点
Just a little.

43
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,240
不要喝太多 你不要再喝了
Don't drink too much. I don't want you drinking any more.

44
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,750
我不想你抽搐
I don't want you cramping up.

45
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,420
你带着太多东西
You're humping too much stuff.

46
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,720
有一半是不需要的
You don't need half this shit.

47
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,920
我帮你拿
I'll haul it for you.

48
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,130
但请你下次先向我请示
But next time check with me first, all right?

49
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,490
谢谢你 中士
Thanks, sarge.

50
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,330
你有没有事吧 没事
-Are you okay? -Yeah.

51
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,510
这是总部 有直升机接近你们
2-2, this is six. I understand you have a bird inbound at your pos.

52
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,690
总部 请留意
Bravo Six, be advised.

53
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,970
军资直升机正驶来
Resupply helo is inbound at this time. Over.

54
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,860
快点搬军火下来
Go, you people! Get that ammo off now!

55
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,980
这个字不是这样写的
It ain't D-E-R-E. It's D-E-A-R.

56
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,090
而且莎拉也不是那样写的 笨蛋
And Sarah ain't got no two R's, King. Damn, you dumb!

57
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,520
没关系 她会明白我的意思
Don't matter. She know what I mean.

58
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,990
她也不大认识字
She don't read too good nohow.

59
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,830
你看 又是猪肉
Look at this shit! Pork again!

60
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,840
我跟你换你的火鸡 我不能再吃这玩意了
Trade me that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man. I can't eat this shit.

61
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,510
你抽了什么
What you been smoking?

62
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,410
希望你不用洗衣服 你要运动一下
I hope you don't get that laundry gig. Your ass need to hump, hump.

63
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,150
白小子 你在等什么
Hey, white boy! What you waiting for?

64
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
那个洞不会自己出现的
That hole won't dig itself.

65
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,150
快点挖
Come on. Get your dick skin on that thing!

66
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,790
时间无多 快点挖…
You ain't got all day! Dig, dig!

67
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,350
有人写过 地狱是不可理喻的
Somebody once wrote, ""Hell is the impossibility of reason. ""

68
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,500
这个地方就像地狱
That"s what this place feels like.; hell.

69
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,960
我只是来了一周 但已经讨厌这里
I hate it already, and it"s only been a week.

70
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,600
祖母 这一周很痛苦
Some goddamn week, Grandma.

71
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,370
最辛苦的事 就是这星期站岗三次
The hardest thing I"ve ever done is go on point three times this week.

72
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,300
我不知道我在做什么
I don"t know what I"m doing.

73
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,980
我连越共在我面前出现也不知道
A gook could be right in front of me and I wouldn"t know it.

74
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,880
我实在很累
I"m so tired.

75
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,420
我们早上五点起床…
We get up at 5.;00 a.m...

76
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,490
整天走动 四五点钟扎营 挖壕沟 进食…
...hump all day, camp around 4 or 5, dig a foxhole, eat...

77
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,390
然后整晚埋伏 或是当哨兵
... then put out an all-night ambush or a listening post.

78
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,330
我是新来的 没有人教我任何事
Nobody tells me how to do anything because I"m new.

79
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,890
没人理会新兵 他们连你的名字也不想知道
Nobody cares about the new guys. They don"t want to know your name.

80
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,800
新兵的生命不重要 因他没有经验
A new guy"s life isn"t worth much because he hasn"t put his time in yet.

81
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,740
若在越南战死 最好在最初几周
If you"re gonna get killed in Nam, it"s better to get it in the first weeks.

82
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,810
原因是你不会受太多苦
The logic being, you don"t suffer that much.

83
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,180
如果幸运 留在外围防线…
If you"re lucky, you stay in the perimeter...

84
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,720
守卫时能够睡三至四小时
... then pull a guard shift, so you sleep three or four hours.

85
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,320
但你不能真的入睡
But you don"t really sleep.

86
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,830
我认为我撑不到一年
I don"t think I can keep this up for a year.

87
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,640
我不应该来这里
I"ve made a big mistake coming here.

88
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,900
我们有很多活动
We got beaucoup movement.

89
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,380
第三部队在15公里外被袭击
3rd Battalion got hit 1 5 klicks north of here.

90
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,710
越共在树上挂上地雷
Charlie had claymores strung in the trees.

91
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,080
整排军队被炸 真倒霉
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit.

92
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,560
两个中尉和一个上尉被炸死
Got two lieutenants and a captain.

93
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,090
我的天
Jesus.

94
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,170
你想谁去埋伏
All right, who do you want on ambush?

95
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,370
伊利亚 你带你的小队出去
Elias, you take your squad out.

96
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,670
华伦 留下 我需要德斯和乔利亚
Warren, stay in, but I need Tex and Junior from your squad.

97
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,710
收到
Roger.

98
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,210
调动到20M的位置
Move out in 2-0 mikes.

99
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,490
我以为今晚轮到奥尼尔
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

100
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,250
特斯和莫尔豪经验不足
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

101
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,860
丰山明天放假 还要他们去吗
Fu Sheng is going on R and R tomorrow. You want to send them out on ambush?

102
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,960
你要带新兵去
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

103
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,660
他们什么都不懂 可能会遇到事情 仔细想想
They don't know shit and we'll probably run into something. Think about it.

104
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,900
太好了 你想我怎样做
Great. What do you want me to do?

105
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,430
你想我为了一个混蛋要好好睡觉 而让手下被杀吗
Get one of my guys zapped so a lame ass can get his beauty sleep?

106
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,740
奥尼尔…
Hey, O'Neill...

107
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,440
别再罗嗦
...take a break.

108
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,010
你不用每天都这么讨厌
You needn't be a prick every day.

109
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,940
伊利亚 叫手下准备好
Elias, get your men ready.

110
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,150
他来了三年 以为自己是耶稣
Guy's in 3 years, thinks he's Jesus Christ.

111
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,610
奥尼尔 他们留下 但你要去
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out.

112
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,720
我需要有经验的老兵
I need veterans out there.

113
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,650
巴恩中士
Sergeant Barnes?

114
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,030
在他们面前应该由我下命令
I think in front of the men, I need to give the orders.

115
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,240
是 长官
Yes, sir.

116
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,580
看来会下雨
Shit, looks like rain.

117
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,320
我们整晚都要在雨中了
It's gonna piss on us all night.

118
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,790
会令你脸烂掉
It'll put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours.

119
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,660
你为那个白人而冒险
Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man.

120
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,360
这里是没有公义的
No justice around here.

121
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,290
奥尼尔又触怒中尉了吗
What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

122
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,530
为什么总是我们负责埋伏呢
Why do we always get fucking ambush?

123
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,700
这是因为他们在玩政治
Because it's politics, man. Politics.

124
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,800
我有否给你看过露丝的照片 没有
-Did I show you a picture of Lucy Jean? -No, you didn't.

125
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,040
她会是我的另一半
She's the one for me all right, that Lucy Jean.

126
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,970
她也在等我
She's waiting for me too.

127
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,810
她很漂亮 你很幸福
She's real pretty. You're a Iucky guy, Gardner.

128
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,090
你有你女朋友的照片吗
You got a picture of your girl?

129
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,690
那我们有一个被 留在家乡的可怜女孩 不是吗
That leaves some unIucky girl back home, don't it?

130
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,820
插进去
Tuck this in.

131
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,530
装进去
Shit-can this.

132
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,400
不需要这个 转身
Don't need this. Turn around.

133
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,930
来吧
Come on.

134
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,570
德斯 跟乔利亚和泰勒一队
Tex! You got Junior and Taylor here on your position.

135
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,470
伊利亚 不要乱来

为国家效力

It"s weird. They"re the bottom of the barrel, and they know it.

163
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,320
所以他们自称平凡人
Maybe that"s why they call themselves grunts.

164
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,850
因为平凡人什么都能承受
Because a grunt can take it, can take anything.

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,940
冲浪一定会很好玩
The surfing's gonna be good.

271
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,450
三月在田纳西州
March, man, in Tennessee.

272
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,150
可以闻到松树的气味 可以在河边闻到女人的气味
Sniff the pines. Sniff that pussy down by the river.

273
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,080
真棒
Hot damn!

274
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,580
泰勒 你还有多少天
Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?

275
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,530
三百什么 三十二
-Three hundred and what? -Thirty-two.

276
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,260
332天
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

277
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,430
傻小子
Sin loi, my boy.

278
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,430
我不记得那个日子了
I can't even remember when I was 332, man.

279
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:52,070
你要向前数 好像你已来了40天
You gotta count backwards or something, like you got 40 days in.

280
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,370
想的乐观些
Think positive, dude.

281
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,610
你怎么会来这里 你看来受过教育
How in the fuck did you get here anyway? You look educated.

282
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,220
我自愿来的 什么
-I volunteered for it. -You did what?

283
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,510
我自愿来的
I volunteered.

284
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,420
我退出大学 想加入越战
I dropped out of college and told them I wanted infantry, combat, Vietnam.

285
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,460
卧槽你居然是自愿来的
You volunteered for this shit, man?

286
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,390
你能相信吗
Can you believe that?

287
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,630
你放弃念大学实在太疯狂
You is a crazy fucker, giving up college.

288
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,570
我在大学什么都学不到
It didn't make much sense. I wasn't learning anything.

289
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,310
为什么穷人就要去打仗 有钱人就不用
Why should the poor kids go to war and the rich kids get away with it?

290
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,640
他是个斗士
What we got here is a crusader.

291
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,410
看来是了 可恶
-Sounds like it. -Shit.

292
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,420
你一定是很富有才会那样想
You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that.

293
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,290
大家都知道…
Everybody knows...

294
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,690
穷人总是被有钱人欺负
...the poor's always fucked over by the rich.

295
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,660
那是不能改变的事实
Always have, always will.

296
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,340
如果你上道 我会介绍一些大头给你认识
If you be cool, I'll introduce you to some of the heads.

297
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,110
什么样的大头
What are the heads?

298
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,240
晚一点吧
Later, man.

299
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,620
怎么了
What's up, brother?

300
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,420
大人驾到 发生什么事
Your Highness has arrived. What's happening?

301
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,090
我以为你在柬埔寨
I thought you was hanging ten in Cambodia.

302
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,740
你为什么在这里
Why are you in the underworld?

303
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,740
这个不是泰勒 泰勒中枪了 是柯里斯 他被救活了
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This is Chris. He been resurrected.

304
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,980
泰勒 你残废吗
You lame, Taylor?

305
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,120
你是残废的吗
Are you lame or something?

306
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,920
继续吧 抽一口吧
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

307
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,010
抽一口享受一下吧
Your shit's in the wind, troop.

308
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,840
你好吗
Hey, man. What's happening?

309
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,410
不是那样叫的
If you do that ''baa,'' you do it right.

310
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,850
你很古怪
You're weird, man.

311
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,360
你是个孩子 我不会 在你身上浪费时间
You're a child. I don't waste time on you.

312
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,540
第一次吗 是
-First time? -Yeah.

313
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,050
那么你一定会上瘾
Then the worm has definitely turned for you, man.

314
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,280
感觉好吗
Feel good?

315
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,380
对 感觉很好 我的脖子不痛了
Yeah, it feels good. I got no pain in my neck now.

316
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,820
感觉很好已足够
Feeling good's good enough.

317
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,660
放入口里
Put your mouth on this.

318
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,160
大家在哪里
Where the hell is everybody, man?

319
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:33,260
大家都正在享受 一群毒虫 他们觉得他们很特别
They're getting high. Bunch of hopheads. They think they're special.

320
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,730
你听 很糟的演奏
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

321
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,460
烦透的噪音 就是那样
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

322
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,040
和你一样那么烦
Make about as much sense as you do.

323
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,500
他们都在埋怨…
All them chucks be rapping about how they losing their ho...

324
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,580
埋怨自己没有钱
...saying how they ain't got no bread for beer.

325
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,810
去他的 给我黑人音乐 开始吧
Fuck that honky shit! Gotta get me some Motown jams, dig it?

326
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,780
你干嘛那样说
What are you talking that shit for?

327
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,960
乔利亚 你吸食过毒品吗
Junior, you ever smoke any shit?

328
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,190
对
That's right.

329
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,090
你们想用毒品荼毒黑人
You trying to keep the black man down and string him out on that shit.

330
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,960
但黑人很快就会推翻你们
But the time's coming when the black man will throw that yoke off.

331
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,070
很简单 释放你的心灵就行 你的身体就会跟随
Simple. Free your mind, your ass will follow.

332
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:18,410
明白 你吸那东西 一切会变得离奇
Yeah, I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit and everything gets weird.

333
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,710
越南人在草丛散布化学毒药
You hear about gooks putting chemicals in the grass...

334
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,450
令我们不再打仗 变成反战者吧
...so we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

335
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,720
不用担心 你怎样都是个杀手
But don't you worry, Bunny, you's a killer anyway.

336
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,610
但我仍然喜欢女人
But I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

337
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,020
除了赛车 没东西比得上女人
Nothing like a piece of pussy, except maybe the Indy 500.

338
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,960
只有女人死了遗留她的身体 给你
Only way you get pussy is if the bitch dies and wills it to you...

339
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,420
你或许才会有
...and then maybe.

340
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,500

这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

353
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,770
他被奥尼尔勒着
He's in the O'Neill death grip.

354
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,710
他不知道要害怕还是瞎了较好
He doesn't know whether to shit or go blind.

355
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,310
中尉 你认为怎么样 你好吗 里德
-What do you say, L.T.? -How you doing, Red?

356
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,590

满堂红
Full house.

358

你还不错
You're doing all right.

359
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,780
对 我还没开始作弊呢
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

360
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:44,860
中尉 要喝酒吗 谢谢
-Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage? -Oh, thanks, Andy.

361
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,460
中尉 你想玩吗
Play, lieutenant?

362
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,600
不 我不想被你们操了
No. Wouldn't want to get raped by you guys.

363
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,770
为什么 你留着为了谁
Why's that, lieutenant? What are you saving up to be?

364
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,010
犹太人么
Jewish?

365
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,140

That is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

368
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,330
你认为呢 鲍布 他能挨过这场仗吗
What do you say there, Bob? A guy like that make it? Yes or no?

369
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,560
我也是那样想
I have to say that's precisely what I saw.

370
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:31,240
我只用看一看他就知道了
Sometimes I just look at a guy, and I know he's not going to make it.

371
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,340
他一定不行
Just no fucking way.

372

他们快来了
They're coming.

409
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,650
下面的村庄有北越军的踪影
NVA were seen at a village half a klick down the river.

410
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,690
六队说我们要立即赶去

415
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,270
曼尼 你在哪里
Manny, where you at?

416
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,570
我们要在入黑前到达村庄

伊利亚等人继续找寻 和等候工程师

但最后金找到他
But it was King who found him...

420
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,160
他在下游一千码那里
...about 1 000 yards downriver, not far from the village.

421
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,780
谜团被解开了
It was the end of the mystery.

422
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,710
混蛋
The motherfuckers.

423
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:25,560
那个千年村的村民不知道我们会来
The village, which was maybe 1 000 years old, didn"t know we were coming.

424
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,760
否则他们早就逃走
If they had, they would have run.

425
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:33,270
巴恩是众矢之的 阿合上尉会经过他
Barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him, our Captain Ahab...

426
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,300
改善事情
...who would set things right again.

427
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,800
那一天我们都很敬爱他
That day, we loved him.

428
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,740

There he goes, sarge.

429
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:54,090

432
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,160
奥尼尔 清除房子
O'Neill, clear out these hooches.

小猪
Hey, piggy-piggy. Hey, pig.

434

Get back!

446
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,220
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

Shut up!

448

Be cool! Be cool! They're scared, man!

453
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,050
他们害怕吗 我又怎样呢
Oh, they're scared, huh? What about me, man?

454

Watch this fucker!

456
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,990
他们认为我们为谁而战
Who the fuck do they think we're fighting for?

457
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,600
还有一个 你…
-You got one more! -Hey, hey!

458

They got two, four....

461
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:24,750
他们有足够米粮供应一队军队
Barnes, they got enough rice here to feed a whole fucking regiment.

462
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,390
华伦 带村长来
Sergeant Warren, you bring the honcho over here.

463

What the fuck's the matter? I wasn't gonna hurt you!

465
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,060
我看来想伤害你吗
Look like I was gonna hurt you?

466
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,900
你为什么不听我说 你为什么不他妈的听我说
Why didn't you listen to me?! Why didn't you fucking listen to me?!

478
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,750
他妈的 他在嘲笑你
Fucking pussy, man! He's laughing at you!

479
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,550
越南人是那样笑的
That's the way the gook laughs.

480
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,430
当然了
Yeah, sure you are!

481
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,720
你很后悔吧
You're real sorry, ain't you?

482
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:45,090
你为曼尼他们的死感到内疚吧
You're just crying your little hearts out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

483
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,170
宾尼 算了吧 我们走
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

What do you say?

485
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,620
妈的 你看到他的头颅 是怎样爆开吗
Holy shit! You see that fucking head come apart, man?

486
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:18,460
我从来没见过那样的脑袋
I never seen brains like that before, man.

487
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,970
我打赌一定是她指挥一切的
I bet you the old bitch runs the whole fucking show.

488
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,510
大概是她割开曼尼的喉咙 她一定也想把我的睾丸割掉
She probably cut Manny's throat. Probably cut my balls off if she could.

489
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,980
宾尼 离开吧 没有人看到什么
Bunny, we leave now, nobody saw a thing!

490
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,810
泰勒 你明白吗
You understand, Taylor?

491
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:38,020
杀死她吧 杀死整条村的人
Come on, let's fucking do her! Let's do the whole fucking village!

492
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,660
这个越南人头目脸上有些疤痕
There's scars on this gook honcho, sarge.

493
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,150
特斯 出来
Get out of here, Tubbs.

494
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,600
他从哪里弄到伤痕
Where did he get these wounds?

495
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:05,710
他说他在轰炸中受伤 他一定是北越的人
-Says he was hit in a bombing raid. -He's a dink for sure.

496
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,480
问他这里为什么会有武器
Ask him why these weapons are here.

497
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,730
他们没有选择 北越杀了抗命的老头目
They had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.

498
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,620
他说那些米是属于他们 莱纳 胡说
-He says all the rice is theirs. -Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

499
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,960
我们在河边杀死的越军是谁
Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?

500
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,480
他不知道 北越军几个月没来过
He doesn't know. The NVA ain't been here in a couple of months.

501
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,720
或许他是哨兵 当然了
-Maybe he was a scout. -Yeah, sure. A scout.

502
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,150
那些米和武器是给谁的
What about the rice and the weapons?! Who they for?!

503
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,610
北越军
An NVC!

504
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,580
他知道我在说什么吧
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying. Don't you?

505
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,050
他一定知道
Goddamn right he does.

506
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,290
他在说谎
He's lying!

507
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,330
杀死他 看谁会说真话
Waste the fucker! Then see who talks.

508
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,890
他说他什么都不知道
Look, he says he doesn't know anything.

509
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,840
他讨厌北越但他们擅自来这里
He hates the NVA, but they come when they want and take over.

510
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,440
她在说什么
What's the bitch saying?

511
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,770
她问我们为什么要杀死猪只
She's going on about why we killed the pigs...

512
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,780
他们是农夫 要养活自己
...they're farmers, they have to make a living....

513
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,990
住口
Shut up!

514
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,330
叫她住口
Shut her the fuck up!

515
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,180
你叫他快点说 否则我会杀死更多人
You tell him to start talking or I'll waste more of them.

516
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,330
莱纳 告诉他
Tell him, Lerner!

517
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,790
让我们大开杀戒
Let us in on this, all right?

518
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,110
我们杀死整条村吧
Let's go for it! Let's do the whole fucking village!

519
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,440
中士 我们还在等什么
Come on, sarge. What the fuck are we waiting for?

520
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,980
杀死他们 走开
-Let's do them! -Out of my way!

521
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,620
这是他的女儿吧
This is his daughter, right? Right?

522
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,830
你说谎 不 你说谎 你这个越共
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

523
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:50,710
巴恩
Barnes!

524
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,420
你在他妈的做什么
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

525
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,720
别管闲事 这和你无关
Stay out of this. It ain't your show.

526
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:12,100
你不是火枪队 猪哥
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

527
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,170
打倒他 巴恩 加油
-Get him! -Come on, Barnes!

528
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:19,670
打倒他… 打烂他的头
Get him! Get him! Tear his fucking head off!

529
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,150
伊利亚 杀死他

530

00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,100
伊利亚 你死定了 我发誓 你死定了
You're dead, Elias! I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

535
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,500
你会坐牢的
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

536
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,640
这件事不会就此罢休的 混蛋
This shit won't wash, you puke!

537

00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,220
上尉说烧掉这里 听到了吗
Captain says to torch this place, hear that?

540
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,850
烧掉这里
Torch this place!

541
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,490
烧掉武器
Blow the weapons in place!

542
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,830
集合他们 我们时间不多
Round up suspected VC and shake it up! We ain't got much light left!

543
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,260
中尉 你为什么不作出行动
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?

544
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,160
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

545
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,900
你知道我在说什么
You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

546
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,470
不 我不知道 我不知道你他妈的在说什么
No, I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.

547
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:32,870
快点出发 快 听到命令了吧
Move it out! Let's go! You heard the lieutenant!

548
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:37,420
泰勒 走了 妈的 烧掉武器 然后离开
Taylor, let's go, for chrissake! Police up the weapons and let's go!

549
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,950
哈洛 来吧
Come on, Harold.

550
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,390
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

551
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,330
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

552
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,650
来吧
Hey, come on.

553
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,280
妈的 滚开
You fucker! Get out of here!

554
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:21,290
滚开…不要那样做
Get the fuck off! Don't do it! Don't do it!

555
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:24,720
混蛋 这是什么一回事
You fucker! What is this, huh?!

556
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,290
你是同志吗
You a homosexual?

557
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,070
你怎么了 她是越南人
What's your problem? She's a fucking dink.

558
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,070
她是人类 去你的
She's a fucking human being, man! Fuck you!

559
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,430
泰勒 你这个可恶的新兵
Total fucking cherry, Taylor!

560
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,240
妈的禽兽 你们全部都是禽兽
Fucking animal! All of you! You're fucking animals!

561
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,410
混蛋
Fucking lame fuck!

562
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,350
你不属于越南 这里不适合你
You don't belong in the Nam. This ain't your place.

563
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,880
你们一点都不明白吧
You don't fucking get it, do you?

564
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,090
你们不明白
You just don't fucking get it.

565
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,490
没事的
It's okay.

566
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,230
离开吧
Get out of there!

567
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,430
出发吧
Police up your dicks and let's go.

568
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,560
我什么都看不见 我看到
-I didn't see anything, sir. -I did.

569
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,360
巴恩中士说那个是北越兵
Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.

570
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,330
我的报告中 沃夫上尉是目击证人
My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

571
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,100
伊利亚 好
All right, Elias.

572
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:19,410
巴恩中士 是
-Staff Sergeant Barnes. -Sir!

573
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:22,740
我们回到总部后我要详细报告
I want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

574
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:27,110
你有日志 我有很多目击证人
You got a diary. I have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

575
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,680
不是现在
Not now, goddamn it! Not now!

576
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,010
我们回到总部才调查这件事
We'll get into this at the base camp.

577
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,620
我保证如果发现非法杀戮…
I can promise you, if I find out there was an illegal killing...

578
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,620
一定会有军事法庭
...there will be a court-martial.

579
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,090
现在我要全军作战 你们别再吵
Right now, I need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

580
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,490
巴恩和伊利亚中士 听到吗
Staff Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Elias. You hear me?

581
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,740
是 知道
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

582
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,240
明天你们从东面再去那越共地堡
We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

583
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:58,170
你们休息一下 晚上七点钟回来开会
You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 1 900 for a briefing.

584
00:59:58,450 --> 00:59:59,710
是 是
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

585
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:09,560
你认为他们会在乎我们吗
Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

586
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,930
哈洛 也许会是你阻碍了巴恩
It could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

587
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,300
那个宾尼呢
And that Bunny?

588
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:17,830
他是个疯子
That motherfucker's crazy.

589
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:19,600
他令我不寒而栗
I mean, he scares me.

590
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,930
他很可怕
He just scares me.

591
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,330
你已经受牵连
You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

592
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,500
这些越南人比你想像中聪明
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.

593
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,780
巴恩知道他在做什么
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

594
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,880
他们是北越兵
They was NVA, every last of them.

595
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,580
他带领我们走到这里了 他会带领我们走完这场战争
He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.

596
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:38,860
我不知道
I don't know, Holmes.

597
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,090
基督教徒不会到处杀人
A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

598
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:47,190
情况失去控制了 完全失控了
This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

599
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,460
看来你不知道怎样分别…
Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

600
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,130
事情的轻重
...the way you always shoot up that shit.

601
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,590
我不知道…
I don't know, brothers...

602
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,670
但我内心大受伤害
...but I'm hurting real bad inside.

603
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,470
别担心 伊利亚不能证明什么
Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

604
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,740
他是个麻烦制造者
He's a troublemaker.

605
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:10,650
伊利亚像华盛顿的政客…
Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

606
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:14,620
想独力打这场仗
...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

607
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,960
这里没有时间进行审讯
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

608
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:22,220
中士 谢谢你
-Sarge. -Thanks, Bun.

609
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:24,660
情况怎么样
How did it go there, Bob?

610
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,030
那个可恶的伊利亚
Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

611
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,330
他是个卑鄙小人
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

612
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,510
他会连累这个连的所有人
He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

613
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,080
有人要教训他
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

614
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,910
你认为呢 会有调查吗
So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

615
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,450
鲍布
Bob?

616
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,760
你太担心了 中士会解决他
O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

617
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:58,630
今晚天色很美
It's a beautiful night.

618
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,800
我喜欢这里的夜晚
Yeah, I love this place at night.

619
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,710
繁星…
The stars....

620
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,400
它们没有对与错 它们就是在那里
There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

621
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,220
你的比喻很好
That's a nice way of putting it.

622
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,880
巴恩憎恨你吧
Barnes has it in for you, huh?

623
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,090
巴恩相信他所做的一切
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

624
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:26,890
你呢 你相信吗
And you? Do you believe?

625
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,760
1965年时吗 我会相信
In '65? Yeah.

626
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:35,870
现在呢
Now?

627
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,670
不相信
No.

628
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,740
今天所发生的事只是开始
What happened today is just the beginning.

629
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,080
我们会输掉这场仗
We're gonna lose this war.

630
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,380
不会吧
Come on.

631
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:54,280
你真的认为我们会输
You really think so? Us?

632
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,950
我们欺负别人太久了
We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...

633
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,530
现在轮到我们被打击
...I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

634
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,570
我每天都在挣扎
Day by day, I struggle to maintain...

635
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,470
我努力维持体力和意志
...not only my strength, but my sanity.

636
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,370
一切都很模糊
It"s all a blur.

637
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:20,580
我没有气力写信
I have no energy to write.

638
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,490
我不能分辨对与错
I don"t know what"s right or wrong anymore.

639
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,710
我们的士气低落 出现内讧
The morale of the men is low. A civil war in the platoon.

640
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:30,480
一半支持伊利亚 一半支持巴恩
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.

641
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,550
有很多猜忌和憎恨
There"s a lot of suspicion and hate.

642
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,620
我们竟然在自相残杀
I can"t believe we"re fighting each other instead of them.

643
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,350
数着日子和留意着周围 没别的
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face. Not much else.

644
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,990
祖母 希望你一切安好
Hope things are well, Grandma.

645
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,170
告诉妈妈和爸爸…
Tell Mom and Dad I--

646
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,970
你知道告诉他们什么的 柯里斯上
Well, just tell them. Chris.

647
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:18,900
我知道你以为会被派去洗衣服
Hey, big boy. I know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out.

648
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,600
我要把自己涂白 才能得到那些工作
Hell, I gotta paint myself white just to get one of those jobs.

649
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,900
我递了申请去割包皮 我要离开
Got my request in for a circumcision. I'm getting my big ass out of here.

650
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:29,170
你会成为犹太教教士吗
What are you gonna do, become a rabbi?

651
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,500
水蛭
Leech.

652
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,550
继续走
All right! Move it out!

653
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:43,750
不要喝 你会得痢疾的
Don't drink that, asshole. You're gonna get malaria.

654
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,590
我希望会
Yeah, I hope so.

655
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,750
去吧
Let's go.

656
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:27,800
军医 莱纳被击中
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

657
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,310
中士 华伦被击中
Sergeant, Warren's hit!

658
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,380
发生什么事 他们有火箭榴弹
-What's going on? -They got RPGs, man!

659
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,380
他们已在这里埋伏了很久
It's an ambush! They were just waiting for us here!

660
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,680
谁负责防守 莱纳和华伦
-Who's on point? -Lerner and Warren.

661
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,510
你去哪里
Where are you going?!

662
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:56,160
天啊 混球 派火力上前
Goddamn it, you assholes! Get some firepower up there!

663
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,360
对
Right!

664
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,640
小心 火箭
Watch out! Rockets!

665
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,680
莱纳在哪里
Where the fuck is Lerner?

666
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:21,550
他在木头那边
He's over there! By the log!

667
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,910
开火坐标649602
Fire mission. Grid: 6-4-9-4-0-2.

668
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:52,180
方向610
Direction: 6-1 -0--

669
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,880
调整发射 完毕
Adjust fire. Over.

670
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,990
中尉 他们会步步进逼
Lieutenant, they'll get in tight under the arty!

671
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:03,460
我看到缺口 让我带人去那边
I saw a cut. Let me take some men and roll up that flank.

672
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,890
叫巴恩去 我们已有四个人受伤 你要我怎么办

伊利亚 不要教我怎么打仗
You don't tell me how to run my war, Elias.

Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.

722
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,460

以防他们准备从外围进攻
...in case they try to flank us.

725
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,970
第三连正在后面赶来
3rd Platoon is coming behind us. Watch for them.

727
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:50,850
不 我单独行事比较敏捷
No. I move faster alone.

728
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,850

What about Elias? If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

732
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:15,370

你击中两个混蛋
A lung, babe. You got two of them fuckers.

01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:02,440
他死了
He's dead?

756
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:05,520
对 他在一百米外
Yeah, he's back there about 1 00 meters.

757
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,580
你看到他吗 哪里

They've got Elias!

764
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,260
什么
What?

765
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:38,170
退后…
Back down! Back down there!

766
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:49,650
蛇1-9队 飞行4 下面仍然有一个士兵
Snake 1-9, Fly 4. There"s still one of the men down there.

767
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,950
停火…
Hold your arms. Guns, hold off.

768
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:16,150
他杀死他
He killed him.

769
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:19,880
我知道是他 我看到他的眼神
I know he did. I saw his eyes when he came in.

770
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:23,760
你怎么知道不是越兵 你没有证据
How do you know the dinks didn't get him? You got no proof.

771
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:26,400
证据就在他的眼神 我看得出
Proof's in the eyes. When you know, you know.

772
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,790
你也看见 我知道你在想什么
You saw. I know what you were thinking.

773
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,660
我们今天解决他
I say we frag him tonight.

774
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,960
我赞成 以牙还牙
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

775
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:37,070
让军事法庭处理吧
I say let military justice do the job on him.

776
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:40,940
去他的军事法庭 你在说笑吗
Come on, fuck the military justice! Are you joking me?

777
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:45,280
他们会相信谁 奥尼尔 宾尼 全是胡说
Whose story you think they'll believe? O'Neill's? Bunny's? Bullshit!

778
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:49,680
巴恩不会放过你的
You try that, Barnes will shove it back up your ass, with a candle on it.

779
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,690
你认为我们应该怎么做
What do you suggest we do?

780
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:57,020
你们小心 巴恩会一个个的解决他们
Watch your own asses. Barnes will be coming down on all of them.

781
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,530
你们忘记和伊利亚的美好日子吗
You gonna forget about Elias? All the good times we had here?

782
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,430
你想把头砍下来治头痛
Shit, you trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.

783
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:08,110
伊利亚没有叫你为他打仗
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him.

784
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:12,610
如果真的有天堂 天啊 我希望真的有
And if there's a heaven, and God, I hope there is...

785
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:17,610
他会在上面喝到大醉
...he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit...

786
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:20,590
因为他把痛苦留在这里
...because he left his pains down here.

787
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:24,150
你错了 总之巴恩是杀人凶手
You're wrong! Anyway you cut it, Barnes is a murderer!

788
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:26,430
对 泰勒…
-Right on. -Taylor...

789
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:31,970
你当初入伍时说很欣赏巴恩
...when you first came in here, you told me how you admired the bastard.

790
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:36,500
我错了 你做任何事都是错的
-I was wrong. -You've never been right about nothing!

791
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:40,000
你们这班混蛋 留心听着
Dig this, you assholes, and dig it good.

792
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,240
巴恩中枪七次都没有死去
Barnes been shot seven times, and he ain't dead.

793
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:46,450
那对你有意思吗
Does that mean anything to you?

794
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,180
巴恩是不会死的
Barnes ain't meant to die.

795
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:53,990
唯一能杀死他的是他自己
The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.

796
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,420
你们在谈死亡吗
Talking about killing?

797
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,590
你们是专家吗
You all experts?

798
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,770
你们都知道杀戮吗
You all know about killing?

799
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:18,870
我想听听 猪头
Well, I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

800
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:29,050
你们抽这个来逃避现实
You smoke this shit to escape from reality?

801
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,830
我不需要这个
Me, I don't need this shit.

802
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,260
我就是现实
I am reality.

803
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:52,270
现实应该是这样 而现实就是这样
There's the way it ought to be, and there's the way it is.

804
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,080
伊利亚满口一派胡言
Elias was full of shit.

805
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:01,990
伊利亚是个斗士
Elias was a crusader.

806
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:07,580
我不会跟听从命令的人作对
Now, I got no fight with any man who does what he's told.

807
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,600
但当他不听命时…
But when he don't...

808
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,660
运作便会崩溃
...the machine breaks down.

809
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,800
运作崩溃时 我们就会崩溃
And when the machine breaks down, we break down.

810
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:19,970
我不会许容那样的事
I ain't going to allow that.

811
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,940
你们任何一个都不能
From any of you.

812
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:24,640
一个都不可以
Not one.

813
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:43,230
你们都爱伊利亚
You all love Elias.

814
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,730
你们想为他报仇
You want to kick ass.

815
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:59,980
我独个儿在这里
Well, here I am. All by my lonesome.

816
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,910
没有人会知道
And ain't nobody gonna know.

817
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:13,090
你们六个对我一个
Six of you boys against me.

818
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:20,690
杀我吧
Kill me.

819
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:40,750
我卑视你们
I shit on all of you.

820
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,550
混蛋
You motherfucker!

821
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:52,990
打吧
Come on, man.

822
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,230
柯里斯 打他
Get him, Chris.

823
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,900
巴恩 不要下手
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man!

824
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,470
你要坐牢的
You'll go dinky dau in LBJ, man.

825
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:07,780
杀军人要坐十年牢 十年
Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years.

826
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,850
你想想吧
Climb the fucking walls, man.

827
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,890
不要下手
Don't do it.

828
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,430
死亡
Death?

829
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:36,570
你们对死亡有什么认识
What do you all know about death?

830
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:54,120
我们翌日被派回到山谷里
They sent us back into the valley the next day...

831
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:58,200
进入离柬埔寨约二千米的战区
...about 2000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter.

832
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,370
我们好像回到案发现场
It felt like we were returning to the scene of a crime.

833
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:39,500
A连在前一天被重击
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable force.

834
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:42,110
C连在那一天被袭击
Charlie Company had been probed that night.

835
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,440
山谷里有其他战事…
There were other battalions in the valley...

836
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:48,650
但我们是引他们出来的饵
...but we knew we were the bait to lure them out.

837
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:53,550
141北越军就在下面某处
Somewhere out there was the entire 1 4 1 st NVA regiment.

838
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:15,470
他们昨晚想袭击C连
Caught them trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.

839
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:17,800
他们发现地图
They found maps on them, man.

840
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:22,850
听说每个散兵坑都有地雷
Got a friend at Battalion, says they had every foxhole here fixed on.

841
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:27,580
知道我方的距离 林木线和地雷
Distances, tree lines, our claymores, everything.

842
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:29,480
情况不妙
This is bad, man.

843
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:34,260
我有不祥之兆 听说我们身在柬埔寨
-I got bad vibes here. -I also heard we're in Cambodia now.

844
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,160
柬埔寨 你在开玩笑
Cambodia? Man, you're kidding me.

845
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:39,630
你想见我
You wanted to see me, sir?

846
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,600
拉姆治 伊利亚小组归你
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

847
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:48,810
小组 我不知道我的连叫小组
Squad? I didn't know we were still referring to this platoon as squads.

848
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:53,480
我要你去那两个坑
I want you to take those two holes, right there and there.

849
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,580
跟在上面的巴恩 和在下面的金联络
Tie it off with Barnes up here and King down there.

850
01:28:58,190 --> 01:28:59,910
长官 对不起…
Begging your pardon, sir...

851
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:03,880
那两个坑距离太远 一个连队可以从中通过
...my two holes are so far apart, a regiment could run between them.

852
01:29:04,190 --> 01:29:05,780
我只有五个军人活着
I have five live bodies left.

853
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:09,650
我不想听你的问题 新兵很快到
I don't want to hear your problems. You'll get new men any day.

854
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,630
你要和别人一样作战
Make do like everybody else.

855
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,400
我没有要求这个 我不想再听
-I didn't ask for this. -I don't want to hear it.

856
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,930
你不想再听 对
-You don't want to hear it? -That's right.

857
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:20,570
因为老实说我毫不在乎
Because, to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.

858
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:23,610
我不再在乎
I just don't give a flying fuck anymore.

859
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:33,220
我很高兴我不用和他们一起去
I'm glad I ain't going with them.

860
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:38,580
外面有一头饥饿的野兽
Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.

861
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:41,060
真失败
What a fucking bummer.

862
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,630
只剩十天了 我仍要面对这一切
Ten days and a wake-up, and I'm still dealing with this shit.

863
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:50,800
你怎么了
What's the matter with you?

864
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:53,330
你为什么不写信
Why ain't you writing nobody?

865
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:55,630
你的父母呢
What about your folks?

866
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,540
你向我提起的祖母怎样
That grandma you told me about?

867
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:02,120
女朋友呢
Girl?

868
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,480
你有父母吧
You got parents, don't you?

869
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:08,650
一定有些亲密的人
There must be somebody.

870
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,590
没有
No, there's nobody.

871
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:15,660
你抽太多了
You been smoking too much of this shit.

872
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,520
你要控制一下 令人颓丧
Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

873
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:25,440
我记得你初来时什么都不懂
I remember when you first come out here to the bush, you's green as--

874
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:30,070
你可曾被无法摆脱的错误缠绕着
You ever get caught in a mistake you just can't get out of?

875
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:33,010
总有方法解决的
There's a way out of anything.

876
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,740
只要你振作精神
Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry...

877
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,980
一定有方法的
...and the worm will turn.

878
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,480
你还有多少天
How many days you short?

879
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,320
不只是我 而是整个事情
It's not just me. It's how the whole thing works.

880
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:50,290
像伊利亚般的人要牺牲
People like Elias get wasted.

881
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:54,330
巴恩那种人却能继续为所欲为
People like Barnes go on making up all the rules any way they want.

882
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:58,370
我们只能逆来顺受吗
So, what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it.

883
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:01,610
我们不用理会那些事情
We just don't add up to dry shit.

884
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:06,710
谁说你需要的 你只需要活着离开这里
Whoever said we did? All you got to do is make it out of here...

885
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:11,350
然后每天快乐地生活
...and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life. Gravy.

886
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:16,710
你是理想主义者
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

887
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,980
收拾你的行装 你的命令刚下达
Collect up your shit. Your orders just come through.

888
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,630
不要骗我
Man, don't fuck with me.

889
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:25,560
你要邀请信吗
Oh, what do you need, a written invitation?

890
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:30,460
天啊 他们做错事
Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers done made a mistake!

891
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:32,240
他们竟然饶我一命
They cut me some slack!

892
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:36,270
你有十分钟时间赶去搭直升机
You got 1 0 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here.

893
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,200
因为如果你不上机…
Because if you're not on it...

894
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:40,080
我便会去
...I'm gonna be.

895
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:43,180
泰勒 法兰西准备好了
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

896
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:47,190
太好了 金 我为你 感到高兴 回家吧
That's great, King, I'm happy for you. Take it on home for me.

897
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:50,720
你有我的地址 你知道怎么联络我
You got my address. You know where to reach me anytime.

898
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:53,790
我要走了 我不想错过直升机
I gotta di di. Don't want to miss that chopper.

899
01:31:58,070 --> 01:32:00,430
你没事吧 我没事
-You okay? -Yeah, I'm okay.

900
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:02,500
记住放松点
Remember, take it easy.

901
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,440
不要想太多 别做傻瓜
Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool.

902
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:09,410
记住这里没有人是懦夫
Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here.

903
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,440
我的朋友
My man.

904
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:20,580
我送你出去
I'll walk you out, man.

905
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,080
金 保重
Take it easy, King.

906
01:32:27,390 --> 01:32:30,830
我会 再见
-I'll take it any way I can get it. -I hear you. Later.

907
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:34,060
很痛 中士 不要碰它
I'm pretty fucked up, sarge. Don't touch it!

908
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:36,570
我一定要上直升机
I gotta get on the chopper, man.

909
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,370
有什么问题 他说不能走路
-So, what's the problem? -Says he can't walk.

910
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,870
可恶
Shit.

911
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,010
马丁…
Martin...

912
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:46,140
穿上靴子
...get your boots on.

913
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,580
下次给我见到你喷防蚊水…
And the next time I catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your feet...

914
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:56,320
我会送你上军事法庭
...I'll court-martial your nigger ass.

915
01:32:57,390 --> 01:32:59,420
送我去吧
Then court-martial me, motherfucker!

916
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:02,090
逮捕我啊 送我去坐牢吧
Bust my ass! Send me to fucking Long Binh!

917
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,220
下手吧
Do your fucking worst!

918
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:07,970
你们白人欺负我
You white folks got your last klick out of Junior!

919
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:11,370
奥尼尔 把蜈蚣拿来
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

920
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,570
中士 是
-Sarge? -Yeah.

921
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:18,610
我找到那毛茸茸 红黑色的虫
That long, hairy, red and black bastard I found in the ammo crate.

922
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:22,340
我会把它放进他的伤口
I'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch.

923
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:23,610
我记得了
I remember now.

924
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:26,950
等一下
Hold up, man!

925
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:29,020
等一下好吗
You just hold up and wait, okay?

926
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,880
我会走路了
Fuck it, I'll walk! I'll fucking walk!

927
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,820
我要和他同一个坑
Fucking pussy! Sarge, I gotta have him in my hole?

928
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:36,320
对
Yeah.

929
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,290
我可以和你谈谈吗
Bob, I'd like to speak to you a minute.

930
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:45,730
我不能再忍受了
I can't take it no more.

931
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:50,770
什么事
Yeah, what is it?

932
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:54,240
我有伊利亚的假期 有三天
Bob, I got Elias' R and R. It's coming up in three days.

933
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:57,240
我想回去夏威夷见柏丝
I was thinking about going to Hawaii and see Patsy.

934
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59,910
我从没向你要求过任何事
I never asked you for a thing over here.

935
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:02,210
坦白说…
Well, to be honest with you...

936
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:06,050
我想和金一起坐直升机回去 你觉得呢
...I was hoping you'd put me on a chopper with King. What do you say?

937
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:07,960
我不能让你那样做
I can't do that for you.

938
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:10,920
你知道这里很需要人手
You know we need every swinging dick in the field.

939
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:14,630
你可以跟我说 我只是请三天假
You can talk to me, for chrissake! I'm just asking for three days.

940
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,500
我告诉你不可以
I am talking to you, Red. And I'm telling you no.

941
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:20,370
回到散兵坑
Get back in your foxhole.

942
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:24,400
我有不祥之兆 知道吗
Bob, I've got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

943
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:27,170
我今次有不祥之兆
I mean I've got a bad feeling.

944
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,250
我觉得我不能活着离开这里
I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.

945
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:32,450
你明白吗
You understand what I'm saying?

946
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:36,280
每个人都会死的
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

947
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:46,320
可恶
Oh, shit!

948
01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:02,880
混蛋们 再见
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

949
01:35:15,130 --> 01:35:17,150
埋伏在哪里
Where's that fucking ambush?

950
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:22,170
他们不会等 他们现在就来了
They ain't even waiting till later. It's fucking coming now, man.

951
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:24,490
现在就来了
Right fucking now.

952

乔利亚 我们所做的一切
You know, Junior? Some of the things we done, man...

953
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:35,610
我不觉得我们在做错事
...I don't feel like we done something wrong.

954
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,940
但有时…
But sometimes, man...

955
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:41,960
我有不祥的感觉
...I get this bad feeling.

956
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:47,320
我坦然对随军牧师说我喜欢这里
I told the padre the truth. I like it here.

957
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:50,430
你可以为所欲为 没有人理会你
You get to do what you want, nobody fucks with you.

958
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,130
你只用担心死亡
The only worry you got is dying.

959
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:55,830
反正死的时候你不会知道
And if that happens, you won't know about it...

960
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:58,040
那么担心什么
...so, what the fuck, man?

961
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:01,840
我要和你同一个坑么
Shit. I got to be in this hole with you, man?

962
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:04,080
我早知道我不应该来
I just know I shouldn't have come.

963
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:10,840
不用担心 你和爱迪墨菲在一起
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging with Audie Murphy here.

他们分布在四周 好几百个 我听到他们说越南话
They"re all around us. Hundreds of them. I can hear them talking gook.

970
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,170

3 Alpha, spot that smoke and tell me where to shift.

971
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:39,070
冷静下来 撑着点 我们会救你

1020
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:00,680
你们去哪里
Hey, you two! Where the fuck are you going?

1021
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:20,760
联络不到任何人吗

1022
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:24,310

We"re packing snake and nape but we"re bingo on fuel.

1035
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:44,380
这是我的决定 投下所有炸弹
For the record, it's my call! Dump all you've got on my pos.

1036
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:49,130
我再说投下所有炸弹
I say again, expend all remaining in my perimeter.

1037

That must have been some fucking fight.

1053
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,290
只有你一个吗
You alone here, man?

1054
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:20,450
是
Yeah.

1055
01:51:21,490 --> 01:51:23,990
那些混球 他们留下我
Bunch of fucking faggots. They all left me.

1056
01:52:13,150 --> 01:52:16,810
122个受伤 仍在点算中
1 22 wounded and still counting.

1057
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,240

-Hey, man, how you doing? -I'm okay. How you doing?

1062
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:37,590
我很好
Fine, man. Just fine.

1063
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:41,170
我们受过两次伤可以离开这里
Hey, dig it, we two-timers. We're gonna get out of here, boy.

1064
01:52:41,470 --> 01:52:45,270
在医院再见
I'm gonna see you in the hospital. We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.

1065
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,580

-Ready? -You bet.

1069
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:39,150
现在回想一切…
I think now, looking back...

1070
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:44,360
我们不是对抗敌人 而是自己
...we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves...

1071
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:46,960
敌人就在我们心中
...and the enemy was in us.

1072
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:51,290
战争对我来说现在已经完结
The war is over for me now...

1073
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:55,440
但它永远会存留在我的心中里
...but it will always be there the rest of my days.

1074
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:57,880
伊利亚会和…
