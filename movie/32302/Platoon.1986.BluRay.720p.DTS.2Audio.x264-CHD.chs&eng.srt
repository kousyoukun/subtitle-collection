00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:45,734
You're dead, Elias! l swear to fucking God, you're dead!
伊利亚，你死定了 我发誓，你死定了

535
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:49,129
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!
你会坐牢的

536
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:51,270
This shit won't wash, you puke!
这件事不会就此罢休的，混蛋

537
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:54,771
Break it up! Break it up! Shut up!
停手！…住口！

538
00:54:55,412 --> 00:54:57,778
Break it up! Listen up!
停手，留心听着

539
00:54:58,515 --> 00:55:00,847
Captain says to torch this place, hear that?

540
00:55:01,185 --> 00:55:02,482
Torch this place!

541
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:04,116
Blow the weapons in place!
烧掉武器

542
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:08,452
Round up suspected VC and shake it up! We ain't got much light left!
集合他们，我们时间不多

543
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:11,886
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?
中尉，你为什么不作出行动？

544
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:13,786
What are you talking about?

You know what the fuck l'm talking about.

546
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:21,098
No, l don't. l don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.
不，我不知道 我不知道你他妈的在说什么

547
00:55:25,976 --> 00:55:28,501
Move it out! Let's go! You heard the lieutenant!
快点出发！快！听到命令了吧！

548
00:55:28,812 --> 00:55:33,044
Taylor, let's go, for chrissake! Police up the weapons and let's go!
泰勒，走了，妈的！ 烧掉武器，然后离开

549
00:55:33,383 --> 00:55:34,577
Come on, Harold.

00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:12,906
You fucker! Get out of here!
妈的！滚开

554
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:16,913
Get the fuck off! Don't do it! Don't do it!
滚开！…不要那样做

555
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:20,348
You fucker! What is this, huh?!
混蛋，这是什么一回事？

556
00:57:24,928 --> 00:57:25,917
You a homosexual?
你是同志吗？

557
00:57:26,296 --> 00:57:28,696
What's your problem? She's a fucking dink.
你怎么了？她是越南人

558
00:57:29,066 --> 00:57:32,695
She's a fucking human being, man! Fuck you!
她是人类！去你的！

559
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,061
Total fucking cherry, Taylor!
泰勒，你这个可恶的新兵

560
00:57:35,405 --> 00:57:38,863
Fucking animal! All of you! You're fucking animals!
妈的禽兽！你们全部都是禽兽！

561
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,040
Fucking lame fuck!
混蛋

562
00:57:41,345 --> 00:57:43,973
You don't belong in the Nam. This ain't your place.
你不属于越南，这里不适合你

563
00:57:44,314 --> 00:57:46,509
You don't fucking get it, do you?
你们一点都不明白吧？

564
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:49,718
You just don't fucking get it.
你们不明白

565
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:52,115
lt's okay.
没事的

566
00:57:56,126 --> 00:57:57,855
Get out of there!
离开吧

567
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:04,056
Police up your dicks and let's go.
出发吧

568
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,595
- 我什么都看不见 - 我看到

569
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:03,189
-l didn't see anything, sir. -l did.
巴恩中士说那个是北越兵

570
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:05,995
Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.
我的报告中 沃夫上尉是目击证人

571
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:09,958
My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

572
00:59:08,705 --> 00:59:10,138
伊利亚，好

573
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,732
All right, Elias.
- 巴恩中士 - 是

574
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:15,035
-Staff Sergeant Barnes. -Sir!
我们回到总部后我要详细报告

575
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:18,364
l want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

576
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,141
你有日志，我有很多目击证人

577
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:22,735
You got a diary. l have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

578
00:59:21,418 --> 00:59:23,716
不是现在

579
00:59:23,046 --> 00:59:25,310
Not now, goddamn it! Not now!
我们回到总部才调查这件事

580
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,640
We'll get into this at the base camp.
我保证如果发现非法杀戮…

581
00:59:27,984 --> 00:59:32,250
l can promise you, if l find out there was an illegal killing...

582
00:59:30,961 --> 00:59:32,656
一定会有军事法庭

583
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:34,250
...there will be a court-martial.
现在我要全军作战，你们别再吵

584
00:59:34,624 --> 00:59:39,721
Right now, l need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

585
00:59:38,468 --> 00:59:41,528
巴恩和伊利亚中士，听到吗？

586
00:59:40,096 --> 00:59:43,122
Staff Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Elias. You hear me?

587
00:59:41,872 --> 00:59:42,770
- 是 - 知道

588
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,364
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
明天你们从东面再去那越共地堡

589
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:48,865
We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

590
00:59:47,578 --> 00:59:52,208
你们休息一下， 晚上七点钟回来开会

591
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:53,802
You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 1 900 for a briefing.

592
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:53,744
- 是 - 是

593
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,338
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

594
00:59:58,822 --> 01:00:03,589
你认为他们会在乎我们吗？

595
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:05,183
Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

596
01:00:04,061 --> 01:00:06,962
哈洛，也许会是你阻碍了巴恩

597
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,556
lt could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

598
01:00:07,931 --> 01:00:09,330
那个宾尼呢？

599
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:10,924
And that Bunny?
他是个疯子

600
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:13,460
That motherfucker's crazy.
他令我不寒而栗

601
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,227
l mean, he scares me.
他很可怕

602
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:17,566
He just scares me.
你已经受牵连

603
01:00:18,401 --> 01:00:20,961
You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

604
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:22,535
这些越南人比你想像中聪明

605
01:00:21,638 --> 01:00:24,129
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.
巴恩知道他在做什么

606
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:26,408
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.
他们是北越兵

607
01:00:26,743 --> 01:00:29,507
They was NVA, every last of them.

608
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:31,617
他带领我们走到这里了 他会带领我们走完这场战争

609
01:00:30,447 --> 01:00:33,211
He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.
我不知道

610
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,482
l don't know, Holmes.
基督教徒不会到处杀人

611
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:38,718
A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

612
01:00:37,861 --> 01:00:41,228
情况失去控制了，完全失控了

613
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:42,822
This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

614
01:00:41,665 --> 01:00:44,498
看来你不知道怎样分别…

615
01:00:43,293 --> 01:00:46,091
Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

616
01:00:44,835 --> 01:00:47,167
事情的轻重

617
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,761
...the way you always shoot up that shit.

618
01:00:48,138 --> 01:00:49,628
我不知道…

619
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:51,233
l don't know, brothers...

620
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:53,705
但我内心大受伤害

621
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:55,298
...but l'm hurting real bad inside.

622
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:59,508
别担心，伊利亚不能证明什么

623
01:00:58,008 --> 01:01:01,102
Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

624
01:00:59,783 --> 01:01:00,772
他是个麻烦制造者

625
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:02,378
He's a troublemaker.
伊利亚像华盛顿的政客…

626
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:06,273
Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

627
01:01:04,988 --> 01:01:08,651
想独力打这场仗

628
01:01:06,616 --> 01:01:10,245
...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

629
01:01:09,192 --> 01:01:11,990
这里没有时间进行审讯

630
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:13,584
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

631
01:01:13,664 --> 01:01:16,258
- 中士 - 谢谢你

632
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:17,852
-Sarge. -Thanks, Bun.

633
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:18,698
情况怎么样？

634
01:01:18,995 --> 01:01:20,292
How did it go there, Bob?

635
01:01:21,538 --> 01:01:25,065
那个可恶的伊利亚

636
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:26,658
Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

637
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,366
他是个卑鄙小人

638
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:28,971
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.
他会连累这个连的所有人

639
01:01:29,306 --> 01:01:32,139
He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

640
01:01:30,914 --> 01:01:33,109
有人要教训他

641
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:34,703
Somebody ought to frag his ass.
你认为呢？ 会有调查吗？

642
01:01:35,111 --> 01:01:38,547
So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

643
01:01:38,588 --> 01:01:39,486
鲍布？

644
01:01:40,216 --> 01:01:41,080
Bob?
你太担心了，中士会解决他

645
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:46,385
O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

646
01:01:51,268 --> 01:01:52,667
今晚天色很美

647
01:01:52,896 --> 01:01:54,261
lt's a beautiful night.
我喜欢这里的夜晚

648
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,030
Yeah, l love this place at night.

649
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:57,739
繁星…

650
01:01:57,968 --> 01:01:59,333
The stars....

651
01:02:00,477 --> 01:02:04,436
它们没有对与错 它们就是在那里

652
01:02:02,105 --> 01:02:06,041
There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

653
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:07,249
你的比喻很好

654
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,842
That's a nice way of putting it.

655
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:13,916
巴恩憎恨你吧？

656
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:15,509
Barnes has it in for you, huh?
巴恩相信他所做的一切

657
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:18,717
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

658
01:02:18,562 --> 01:02:20,928
你呢？你相信吗？

659
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,522
And you? Do you believe?

660
01:02:24,234 --> 01:02:26,794
1965年时吗？我会相信

661
01:02:25,862 --> 01:02:28,387
ln '65? Yeah.

662
01:02:28,739 --> 01:02:29,899
现在呢？

663
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:31,493
Now?

664
01:02:32,676 --> 01:02:33,700
不相信

665
01:02:34,304 --> 01:02:35,293
No.

666
01:02:37,114 --> 01:02:39,776
今天所发生的事只是开始

667
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:41,370
What happened today is just the beginning.

668
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:43,115
我们会输掉这场仗

669
01:02:42,946 --> 01:02:44,709
We're gonna lose this war.
不会吧

670
01:02:45,548 --> 01:02:47,015
Come on.
你真的认为我们会输？

671
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,910
You really think so? Us?

672
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:51,988
我们欺负别人太久了

673
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,582
We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...
现在轮到我们被打击

674
01:02:53,923 --> 01:02:56,153
...l figure it's time we got ours kicked.

675
01:03:05,275 --> 01:03:07,607
我每天都在挣扎

676
01:03:06,903 --> 01:03:09,201
Day by day, I struggle to maintain...
我努力维持体力和意志

677
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:12,099
...not only my strength, but my sanity,
一切都很模糊

678
01:03:12,442 --> 01:03:14,000
It's all a blur,
我没有气力写信

679
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,210
I have no energy to write,
我不能分辨对与错

680
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:19,113
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore,
我们的士气低落，出现内讧

681
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:23,243
The morale of the men is low, A civil war in the platoon,

682
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,516
一半支持伊利亚，一半支持巴恩

683
01:03:23,586 --> 01:03:26,054
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes,

684
01:03:25,452 --> 01:03:27,579
有很多猜忌和憎恨

685
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:29,083
There's a lot of suspicion and hate,
我们竟然在自相残杀

686
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:33,155
I can't believe we're fighting each other instead of them,

687
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:38,388
数着日子和留意着周围，没别的

688
01:03:35,432 --> 01:03:39,892
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face, Not much else,

689
01:03:39,032 --> 01:03:41,023
祖母，希望你一切安好

690
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,538
Hope things are well, Grandma,
告诉妈妈和爸爸…

Well, just tell them, Chris,

693
01:04:08,495 --> 01:04:12,932
我知道你以为会被派去洗衣服

694
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:14,436
Hey, big boy. l know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out.

695
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,633
我要把自己涂白 才能得到那些工作

696
01:04:14,804 --> 01:04:18,137
Hell, l gotta paint myself white just to get one of those jobs.

697
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:20,930
我递了申请去割包皮，我要离开

698
01:04:18,475 --> 01:04:22,434
Got my request in for a circumcision. l'm getting my big ass out of here.

699
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,199
你会成为犹太教教士吗？

700
01:04:22,746 --> 01:04:24,714
What are you gonna do, become a rabbi?
水蛭

701
01:04:25,048 --> 01:04:26,037
Leech.

702

继续走

703
01:04:30,754 --> 01:04:33,086
All right! Move it out!

704
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,784
不要喝，你会得痢疾的

705
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,287
Don't drink that, asshole. You're gonna get malaria.

706
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:39,619
我希望会

707
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:41,123
Yeah, l hope so.

708
01:04:41,831 --> 01:04:43,298
Let's go.

709

军医，莱纳被击中

710
01:05:21,037 --> 01:05:23,335

714
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:36,916
-What's going on? -They got RPGs, man!
他们已在这里埋伏了很久

715
01:05:37,253 --> 01:05:39,915
lt's an ambush! They were just waiting for us here!
- 谁负责防守？ - 莱纳和华伦

716
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:42,224
-Who's on point? -Lerner and Warren.

717
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,049
Where are you going?!

718
01:05:46,426 --> 01:05:50,192
天啊！混球！派火力上前

719
01:05:47,964 --> 01:05:51,695
Goddamn it, you assholes! Get some firepower up there!

720
01:05:50,497 --> 01:05:51,395
对

721

Right!

722
01:06:00,974 --> 01:06:02,669
小心，火箭

723

Watch out! Rockets!

724
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:12,712
莱纳在哪里？

725
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:14,216
Where the fuck is Lerner?
他在木头那边

726
01:06:14,557 --> 01:06:17,082
He's over there! By the log!

727
01:06:38,878 --> 01:06:42,939
开火坐标649602

728
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:44,443
Fire mission. Grid: 6-4-9-4-0-2.

调整发射，完毕！

732
01:06:48,224 --> 01:06:49,418
Adjust fire. Over.

733
01:06:50,357 --> 01:06:53,019
中尉，他们会步步进逼

734
01:06:51,895 --> 01:06:54,523
Lieutenant, they'll get in tight under the arty!

735
01:06:53,693 --> 01:06:57,493
我看到缺口，让我带人去那边

736
01:06:55,231 --> 01:06:58,997
l saw a cut. Let me take some men and roll up that flank.

737
01:06:57,797 --> 01:07:01,927
叫巴恩去，我们已有四个人受伤 你要我怎么办？

738
01:06:59,335 --> 01:07:03,431
Get Barnes! Elias, we got four down. What do you want me to do?

739
01:07:03,703 --> 01:07:07,764
红连在哪里？叫那些混蛋赶来

740
01:07:05,241 --> 01:07:09,268
Where the fuck is Red Platoon?! Tell those assholes to get up here!

741
01:07:08,508 --> 01:07:10,703
伊利亚，你在这里做什么？

742
01:07:10,046 --> 01:07:12,207
Elias, what are you doing back here?
第三连在这里，我们在这里

743
01:07:12,548 --> 01:07:16,780
There's holes back here, 3rd Platoon's coming up here, we're here!

744
01:07:15,582 --> 01:07:18,574
若越军进入这些洞我们就要交锋

745
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,089
Dinks get in these holes, we'll be in a crossfire.

746
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:21,479
- 我们会互相开火 - 听来很不寻常

747
01:07:20,423 --> 01:07:22,983
-We'll shoot each other. -Sounds far-out to me.

748
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:24,886
我在1966年的战役里见过

749
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:26,390
l've seen it happen. la Drang in '66.

750
01:07:25,225 --> 01:07:27,693
他们会击溃我们，我需要三个人

751
01:07:26,763 --> 01:07:29,231
They cut us to pieces. l need three men.
好，去吧

752
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:30,862
You got them! Take off!
继续掩护我们

753
01:07:31,768 --> 01:07:34,293
You keep pouring off that cover fire.
我不想在外面孤军作战

754
01:07:34,637 --> 01:07:38,403
l don't want to be stuck out there with my ass hanging in the breeze.

755
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:39,899
伊利亚，不要教我怎么打仗

756
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:41,403
You don't tell me how to run my war, Elias.
你去呼喝你的手下好了

757
01:07:41,711 --> 01:07:45,044
You go crying to fucking brigade on your own time.

758
01:07:43,843 --> 01:07:46,812
在这里你属于我，快行动！

759
01:07:45,381 --> 01:07:48,316
Out here you belong to me! Now, move!

760
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:48,603
巴恩，你是个混蛋

761
01:07:48,651 --> 01:07:50,118
You're an asshole, Barnes.
叫奥尼尔上前来

762
01:07:50,453 --> 01:07:52,683
Get that asshole O'Neill up here!

763
01:08:23,483 --> 01:08:25,348
可恶

764

Holy fuck,

765
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,720

Ammo! Ammo!

769
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:06,181
中士，子弹不够

Sarge! Short round!

771
01:09:07,694 --> 01:09:09,184

Get it out!

775
01:09:36,055 --> 01:09:37,454

Satchel charge!

- 你没事吧？ - 不要留下我

-You okay? -Don't leave me, man.

-Hey, Gator, you'll be okay, man. -Don't leave me, man.

788
01:10:13,192 --> 01:10:15,183
你会没事的

789
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:16,698
Gator? Gator, you'll be okay.

791
01:10:18,267 --> 01:10:21,964
-Drop your rucks. -Taylor, you're coming with us.

792
01:10:22,068 --> 01:10:23,330
求你不要走

793
01:10:23,606 --> 01:10:24,834
Please don't go.
你会没事的

794
01:10:25,174 --> 01:10:26,664
You're gonna be okay.
来吧

795
01:10:27,877 --> 01:10:28,741
Come on.
军医，照顾他

796
01:10:29,078 --> 01:10:31,171
Doc, take care of him, man.

797
01:10:32,412 --> 01:10:34,972
炮手，B2实际射程

798
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,475
Redleg, Redleg. Ripper Bravo 2 actual.
调整方位，B…

799
01:10:36,819 --> 01:10:39,754
Adjustment follows: Bridge....

800
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:41,916
你这个自大混蛋

801
01:10:41,657 --> 01:10:43,420
You ignorant asshole!
你给他们什么座标？

802
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:45,852
What the fuck coordinates are you giving?
你的座标已经令很多人受伤

803
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:49,892
You wasted a lot of people up there with your fucked-up fire mission!

804
01:10:48,695 --> 01:10:50,094
你知道吗？

805
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:51,598
Do you know that?
你知道吗？妈的！

806
01:10:52,869 --> 01:10:55,667
Do you know that? Ah, shit!

807
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,668
炮手，这是B2

808
01:10:57,373 --> 01:10:58,237
Redleg! Redleg! Ripper Bravo 2.

809
01:10:58,938 --> 01:11:01,634
停火…

810
01:11:00,476 --> 01:11:01,443
Check your fire! Check your fire!

811
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,149
他们来了

812
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:15,652
They're coming.

813
01:11:17,256 --> 01:11:21,386
坚守这里 枪杀任何走动着的东西

814
01:11:18,794 --> 01:11:22,890
Stagger yourself across this line. Shoot anything that moves.

815
01:11:22,061 --> 01:11:23,961
他们会从那里过来

816
01:11:23,599 --> 01:11:25,464
They'll be coming from over there.
只要被他们攻破，我们便死定了

817
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:29,969
Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.

818
01:11:28,968 --> 01:11:30,492
你去哪里？

819
01:11:30,506 --> 01:11:31,996
Where the hell are you going?
到下游大约一百米处…

820
01:11:32,675 --> 01:11:35,769
Down by the river about 1 00 meters...

821
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,064
以防他们准备从外围进攻

822
01:11:36,078 --> 01:11:37,568
...in case they try to flank us.
第三连正在后面赶来

823
01:11:37,914 --> 01:11:40,508
3rd Platoon is coming behind us. Watch for them.

824
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:41,036
我可以和你一起去吗？

825
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,540
Hey. Can l go with you?
不，我单独行事比较敏捷

826
01:11:43,486 --> 01:11:46,387
No. l move faster alone.

827
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,887
让炮兵队来处理

828
01:11:55,298 --> 01:11:57,391
Let's let arty do a bit of the work.
叫所有人去教堂…

829
01:11:57,767 --> 01:12:00,565
Tell everyone to pull back to the church...

830
01:11:59,365 --> 01:12:02,493
和第三连会合，知道吗？

831
01:12:00,903 --> 01:12:03,997
...and link up with 3rd Platoon. You got that?

832
01:12:03,202 --> 01:12:06,171
伊利亚怎么样？他会孤立无援

833
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:07,675
What about Elias? lf we pull back, he'll be cut off.

834
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:09,408
中尉，你也快去

835
01:12:07,977 --> 01:12:10,912
You just haul ass too, lieutenant.

836
01:12:10,309 --> 01:12:11,606
我去找他

837
01:12:11,847 --> 01:12:13,109
l'll get him.

838
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:36,725
去吧

839
01:12:36,739 --> 01:12:38,229
