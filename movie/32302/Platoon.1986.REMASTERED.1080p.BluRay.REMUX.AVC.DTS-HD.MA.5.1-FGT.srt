1
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,210
天 那是我想的东西吗？
Oh, man! Is that what I think it is?

2
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,180
好了 新丁 欢迎来到越南 跟我来
All right, cheesedicks. Welcome to the Nam. Follow me.

3
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,520
糟了 有新血
I'll be dipped in shit. New meat!

4
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,730
你们会很喜欢越南的 永远的
You dudes gonna love the Nam. For-fucking-ever.

5
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,460
365天
365 and a wake-up. Oh, lord.

6
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,450
1967年9月B连第25队步兵

7
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,450
在柬埔寨边境附近

8
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,430
下面小心
Watch it below!

9
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,130
莫浩 走快点
Morehouse, drop back to slack.

10
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,160
查理 谁在队尾？
Who's on tail-end Charlie?

11
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,080
总部 这是六队 位置如下…
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six, Pos rep follows,'

12
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,420
L、A、W、A、F…
Lemur, Alpha, Whiskey, Alpha, Foxtrot...,

13
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,090
华伦 你去队侧
Warren, you get out on flank.

14
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,230
- 何迈特 - 什么事？
- Hey, Hoffmeister! - Yo?

15
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,500
你有香烟吗？
You got a smoke?

16
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,740
- 没有 - 没关系
- No, man, I don't. - Sin loi, man.

17
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,030
B26 为何延迟了？
Bravo 2-6. What's the delay on point?

18
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,740
又找不到路了吗？
Having compass trouble again?

19
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,470
继续走
Get a move on, boy.

20
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,330
你还在等什么？
Boy, what you waiting for?

21
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,040
他不会咬你
He ain't gonna bite you.

22
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,180
那是越南兵 死了
That's a good gook. Good and dead.

23
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,400
- 新丁 - 新丁
- Cherry. - Yo, cherry!

24
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,440
行动 第六队说我们挡住了他们 完毕
Move it out. Six says we're jamming them up back there. Over.

25
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,370
叫他去见鬼吧
Tell that dipshit to get fucked.

26
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,410
这是第25队 听好 我们很快便出发 完毕
This is 2-5. Be advised. We're moving out shortly. Out.

27
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,980
泰勒 你怎么了？
What's the matter with you, Taylor?

28
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,320
你是个大混蛋
You are one simple son of a bitch.

29
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,960
中士 对不起
I'm sorry, sergeant.

30
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,660
叫另外那个新丁过来 葛拿 还有军医
Get that other cherry up here. Gardner. And the doc.

31
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,860
葛拿 军医 上前来
Gardner, doc, up!

32
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,690
葛拿 军医 上前来
Gardner, doc, to the front!

33
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
葛拿 快过来 你他妈的
Gardner, get your ass up the hill, you fat fuck!

34
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,170
大胖子 快点
Hurry up, bubble- butt!

35
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,720
-  你有没有事？  -  蚂蚁
-  You all right?   -  Ants.

36
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,120
我脖子全都是蚂蚁
I got ants all over my neck.

37
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,070
这些是红蚂蚁
You got some red ants.

38
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,060
红蚂蚁是杀手 黑蚂蚁最可怕
Reds are killers. Black ants are the worse.

39
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,940
快点 混球
Hurry up, lard-ass!

40
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,800
我很累
I'm so tired!

41
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,640
只喝一点
Just a little.

42
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,110
不要喝太多 你不要再喝了
Don't drink too much. I don't want you drinking any more.

43
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,610
我不想你抽搐
I don't want you cramping up.

44
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,290
你带着太多东西
You're humping too much stuff.

45
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,590
有一半是不需要的
You don't need half this shit.

46
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,790
我帮你拿
I'll haul it for you.

47
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,000
但请你下次先向我请示
But next time check with me first, all right?

48
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,360
谢谢你 中士
Thanks, sarge.

49
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,210
-  你有没有事？   -  没事
-  Are you okay?    -  Yeah.

50
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,380
这是总部 有直升机接近你们
2-2, this is six, I understand you have a bird inbound at your pos,

51
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,560
总部 请留意
Bravo Six, be advised.

52
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,830
军资直升机正驶来
Resupply helo is inbound at this time, Over,

53
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,740
快点搬军火下来
Go, you people! Get that ammo off now!

54
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,850
这个字不是这样写的
It ain't D-E-R-E. It's D-E-A-R.

55
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,950
而且莎拉也不是那样写的 笨蛋
And Sarah ain't got no two R's, King. Damn, you dumb!

56
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,390
没关系 她会明白我的意思
Don't matter. She know what I mean.

57
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,860
她也不大认识字
She don't read too good nohow.

58
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,700
你看 又是猪肉
Look at this shit! Pork again!

59
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,700
我跟你换你的火鸡 我不能再吃这玩意了
Trade me that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man. I can't eat this shit.

60
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,380
你抽了什么？
What you been smoking?

61
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,280
希望你不用洗衣服 你要运动一下
I hope you don't get that laundry gig. Your ass need to hump, hump.

62
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,020
白小子 你在等什么？
Hey, white boy! What you waiting for?

63
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,310
那个洞不会自己出现的
That hole won't dig itself.

64
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,020
快点掘
Come on. Get your dick skin on that thing!

65
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,660
时间无多 快点掘…
You ain't got all day! Dig, dig!

66
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,230
有人写过 "地狱是不可理喻的"
Somebody once wrote, ''Hell is the impossibility of reason, ''

67
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,370
这个地方就像地狱
That's what this place feels like,' hell,

68
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,830
我只是来了一周 但已经讨厌这里
I hate it already, and it's only been a week,

69
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,470
祖母 这一周很痛苦
Some goddamn week, Grandma,

70
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,240
最辛苦的事就是这星期站岗三次
The hardest thing I've ever done is go on point three times this week,

71
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,170
我不知道我在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing,

72
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,850
我连越共在我面前出现也不知道
A gook could be right in front of me and I wouldn't know it,

73
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,740
我实在很累
I'm so tired,

74
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,290
我们早上五点起床…
We get up at 5,'00 a,m...

75
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,360
整天走动 四五点钟扎营 掘壕沟 进食…
...hump all day, camp around 4 or 5, dig a foxhole, eat...

76
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,260
然后整晚埋伏 或是当哨兵
...then put out an all-night ambush or a listening post,

77
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,190
我是新来的 没有人教我任何事
Nobody tells me how to do anything because I'm new,

78
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,770
没人理会新丁 他们连你的名字也不想知道
Nobody cares about the new guys, They don't want to know your name,

79
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,670
新丁的生命不重要 因为他没有经验
A new guy's life isn't worth much because he hasn't put his time in yet,

80
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,610
若在越南战死 最好在最初几周
If you're gonna get killed in Nam, it's better to get it in the first weeks,

81
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,680
原因是你不会受太多苦
The logic being, you don't suffer that much,

82
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,050
如果幸运 留在外围防线…
If you're lucky, you stay in the perimeter...

83
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,590
守卫时能够睡三至四小时
...then pull a guard shift, so you sleep three or four hours,

84
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,190
但你不能真的入睡
But you don't really sleep,

85
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,700
我认为我撑不到一年
I don't think I can keep this up for a year, Grandma,

86
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,430
我不应该来这里
I've made a big mistake coming here,

87
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,770
我们有很多活动
We got beaucoup movement.

88
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,250
第三部队在15公里外被袭击
3rd Battalion got hit 15 klicks north of here.

89
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,580
越共在树上挂上地雷
Charlie had claymores strung in the trees.

90
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,950
整排军队被炸 真倒霉
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit.

91
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,470
两个中尉和一个上尉被炸死
Got two lieutenants and a captain.

92
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,960
我的天
Jesus.

93
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,030
你想谁去埋伏？
All right, who do you want on ambush?

94
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,230
奕礼 你带你的小队出去
Elias, you take your squad out.

95
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,840
华伦 留下 我需要德斯和小尊
Warren, stay in, but I need Tex and Junior from your squad.

96
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,580
知道
Roger that.

97
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,080
调动到20M的位置
Move out in 2-0 mikes.

98
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,350
我以为今晚轮到奥尼尔
I thought it was O'NeilI's turn tonight.

99
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,160
托斯和莫浩经验不足
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

100
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,720
福生明天放假 还要他们去吗？
Fu Sheng is going on R and R tomorrow. You want to send them out on ambush?

101
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,820
你要带新丁去
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

102
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,530
他们什么都不懂 可能会遇到事情 仔细想想
They don't know shit and we'll probably run into something. Think about it.

103
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,770
太好了 你想我怎样做？
Great. What do you want me to do?

104
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,300
你想我为了一个混蛋要好好睡觉 而让手下被杀吗？
Get one of my guys zapped so a lame ass can get his beauty sleep?

105
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,610
奥尼尔…
Hey, O'Neill...

106
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,310
别再啰嗦
...take a break.

107
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,880
你不用每天都这么讨厌
You needn't be a prick every day.

108
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,810
奕礼 叫手下准备好
Elias, get your men ready.

109
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,050
他来了三年 以为自己是耶稣
Guy's in 3 years, thinks he's Jesus Christ.

110
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,480
奥尼尔 他们留下 但你要去
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out.

111
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,590
我需要有经验的老兵
I need veterans out there.

112
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,520
彭斯中士？
Sergeant Barnes?

113
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,900
在他们面前应由我下命令
I think in front of the men, I need to give the orders.

114
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,100
是 长官
Yes, sir.

115
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,450
看来会下雨
Shit, looks like rain.

116
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,180
我们整晚都要在雨中了
It's gonna piss on us all night.

117
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,650
会令你脸烂掉
It'll put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours.

118
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,530
你为那个白人而冒险
Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man.

119
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,230
这里是没有公义的
No justice around here.

120
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,160
奥尼尔又触怒中尉了？
What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

121
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,400
为什么总是我们负责埋伏？
Why do we always get fucking ambush?

122
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,570
这是因为他们在玩政治
Because it's politics, man. Politics.

123
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,680
- 我有否给你看过露珍的照片？ - 没有
- Did I show you a picture of Lucy Jean? - No, you didn't.

124
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,910
她会是我的另一半
She's the one for me all right, that Lucy Jean.

125
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,840
她也在等我
She's waiting for me too.

126
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,680
她很漂亮 你很幸福
She's real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

127
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,960
你有你女朋友的照片吗？
You got a picture of your girl?

128
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,560
那我们有一个被留在家乡的可怜女孩 不是吗？
That leaves some unlucky girl back home, don't it?

129
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,690
插进去
Tuck this in.

130
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,400
装进去
Shit-can this.

131
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,270
不需要这个 转身
Don't need this. Turn around.

132
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,800
来吧
Come on.

133
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,440
德斯! 跟小尊和泰勒一队
Tex! You got Junior and Taylor here on your position.

134
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,340
奕礼 不要乱来

我会坐在海滩上看美女
I'll be sitting outside checking out the babes on the beach.

269
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,810
冲浪一定会很好玩
The surfing's gonna be good.

270
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,310
三月在田纳西州
March, man, in Tennessee.

271
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,020
可以闻到松树的气味 可以在河边闻到女人的气味
Sniff the pines. Sniff that pussy down by the river.

272
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,950
真棒
Hot damn!

273
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,450
泰勒 你还有多少天？
Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?

274
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,400
- 三百什么？ - 三十二
- Three hundred and what? - Thirty-two.

275
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,130
332天
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

276
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,300
傻小子
Sin loi, my boy.

277
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,300
我不记得那个日子了
I can't even remember when I was 332, man.

278
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,940
你要向前数 好像你已来了40天
You gotta count backwards or something, like you got 40 days in.

279
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,240
想的乐观些
Think positive, dude.

280
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,480
你怎会来这里？你看来受过教育
How in the fuck did you get here anyway? You look educated.

281
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,090
-  我自愿来的    -  什么？
-  I volunteered for it.     -  You did what?

282
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,390
我自愿来的
I volunteered.

283
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,290
我退出大学 想加入越战
I dropped out of college and told them I wanted infantry, combat, Vietnam.

284
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,330
你自愿来的？
You volunteered for this shit, man?

285
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,260
你能相信吗？
Can you believe that?

286
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,490
你放弃念大学实在太疯狂
You is a crazy fucker, giving up college.

287
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,440
我在大学什么都学不到
It didn't make much sense. I wasn't learning anything.

288
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,180
为什么穷人就要去打仗 有钱人就不用？
Why should the poor kids go to war and the rich kids get away with it?

289
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,510
他是个斗士
What we got here is a crusader.

290
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,280
- 看来是了 - 可恶
- Sounds like it. - Shit.

291
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,290
你一定是很富有才会那样想
You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that.

292
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,160
大家都知道…
Everybody knows...

293
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,560
穷人总是被有钱人欺负
...the poor's always fucked over by the rich.

294
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,520
那是不能改变的事实
Always have, always will.

295
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,200
如果你上道 我会介绍一些大头给你认识
If you be cool, I'll introduce you to some of the heads.

296
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,010
什么样的大头？
What are the heads?

297
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,110
晚一点吧
Later, man.

298
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,480
怎么了？
What's up, brother?

299
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,280
大人驾到 发生什么事了？
Your Highness has arrived. What's happening?

300
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,960
我以为你在柬埔寨
I thought you was hanging ten in Cambodia.

301
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,610
你为什么在这里？
Why are you in the underworld?

302
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:35,610
这个不是泰勒 泰勒中枪了 是柯里斯 他被救活了
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This is Chris. He been resurrected.

303
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,850
泰勒 你跛了吗？
You lame, Taylor?

304
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,990
你是跛的吗？
Are you lame or something?

305
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,790
继续吧 抽一口吧
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

306
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,880
抽一口享受一下吧
Your shit's in the wind, troop.

307
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,710
你好吗？
Hey, man. What's happening?

308
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,280
不是那样叫的
If you do that ''baa,'' you do it right.

309
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,730
你很古怪
You're weird, man.

310
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,220
你是个孩子 我不会在你身上浪费时间
You're a child. I don't waste time on you.

311
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,400
-  第一次吗？   -  是
-  First time?     -  Yeah.

312
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,910
那么你一定会上瘾
Then the worm has definitely turned for you, man.

313
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,150
感觉好吗？
Feel good?

314
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,250
感觉很好 我的脖子不痛了
Yeah, it feels good. I got no pain in my neck now.

315
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,690
感觉很好已足够
Feeling good's good enough.

316
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,530
放入口里
Put your mouth on this.

317
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,020
大家在哪里？
Where the hell is everybody, man?

318
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,130
大家都正在享受 一群毒虫 他们觉得他们很特别
They're getting high. Bunch of hopheads. They think they're special.

319
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,600
你听 很糟的演奏
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

320
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,330
烦透的噪音 就是那样
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

321
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,910
和你一样那么烦
Make about as much sense as you do.

322
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,370
他们都在埋怨…
All them chucks be rapping about how they losing their ho...

323
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,450
埋怨自己没有钱
...saying how they ain't got no bread for beer.

324
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,680
去他的!  给我黑人音乐 开始吧？
Fuck that honky shit! Gotta get me some Motown jams, dig it?

325
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,650
你干嘛那样说？
What are you talking that shit for?

326
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,820
小尊 你吸食过毒品吗？
Junior, you ever smoke any shit?

327
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,060
对
That's right.

328
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,960
你们想用毒品荼毒黑人
You trying to keep the black man down and string him out on that shit.

329
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,830
但黑人很快就会推翻你们
But the time's coming when the black man will throw that yoke off.

330
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,940
很简单 释放你的心灵就行 你的身体就会跟随
Simple. Free your mind, your ass will follow.

331
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,280
明白 你吸那东西 一切会变得离奇
Yeah, I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit and everything gets weird.

332
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,570
越南人在草丛散布化学毒药
You hear about gooks putting chemicals in the grass...

333
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,320
令我们不再打仗 变成反战者吧
...so we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

334
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,590
不用担心 你怎样都是个杀手
But don't you worry, Bunny, you's a killer anyway.

335
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,480
但我仍然喜欢女人
But I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

336
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,890
除了赛车 没东西比得上女人
Nothing like a piece of pussy, except maybe the lndy 500.

337
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,820
只有女人死了遗留她的身体给你
Only way you get pussy is if the bitch dies and wills it to you...

338
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,790
你或许才会有
...and then maybe.

339
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,370
宾尼 你好吗？
How's it going, Bunny?

340
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,160
中尉

You like that?

343
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,240
很棒
Terrific.

344
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,980
我会寄回家
I'll send it home.

345
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,220
小尊
Hey, Junior.

346
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,320
- 中尉 - 你好
- Lieutenant. - Hello, sir.

347
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,800
罗志杰 你的寺庙很棒

348
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,430
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

349
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,300
-  你有什么需要吗？    -  没有
-  You need anything?    -  No, sir.

350
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,240
这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

351
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,610
这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

352
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,640
他被奥尼尔勒着
He's in the O'Neill death grip.

353
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,570
他不知道要害怕还是瞎了较好
He doesn't know whether to shit or go blind.

354
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,180
- 中尉 你认为怎样？  - 你好吗 里德？
- What do you say, L.T.?  - How you doing, Red?

355
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,450
不好 他拿了所有的好牌
Not good. This cocksucker has every card in the deck.

356
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,950
呼鲁
Full house.

357
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,850
你还不错
You're doing all right.

358
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,660
对 我还没开始作弊呢
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

359
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,730
- 中尉 要喝酒吗？ - 谢谢
- Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage? - Oh, thanks, Andy.

360
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,320
中尉 你想玩吗？
Play, lieutenant?

361
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,470
不 我不想被你们强奸
No. Wouldn't want to get raped by you guys.

362
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,640
为什么？你留着为了谁？
Why's that, lieutenant? What are you saving up to be?

363
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,870
犹太人？
Jewish?

364
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,010
我要走了
I gotta run.

365
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,080
稍后再见 你们玩得高兴点
I'll catch you men later. Enjoy yourselves tonight.

366
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,400
他真是一个混蛋
That is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

367
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,190
你认为呢？鲍布？ 他能挨过这场仗吗？
What do you say there, Bob? A guy like that make it? Yes or no?

368
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,430
我也是那样想
I have to say that's precisely what I saw.

369
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:33,110
我只用看一看他就知道了
Sometimes I just look at a guy, and I know he's not going to make it.

370
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,200
他一定不行
Just no fucking way.

371
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,610
1968年 元旦

A lot of little firefights, ambushes,

我们投下炸弹后 像鬼魅般穿越丛林
We drop bombs, then we walk through the jungle like ghosts in a landscape,

376
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,310

00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,800
我们需要增援
This...  We need help, sir. ASAP.

403
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:55,440
立即离开这里 一轮搏斗你们就完蛋
Move your ass out of here! One round to get you all!

404
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,770
罗德里 乔利亚 快点
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

405
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,090
中尉
Lieutenant.

406
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,780
告诉总部我们需要工程师 这里到处是陷阱
Tell 6 we need engineers. This pos is full of traps.

407
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,050
他们快来了
They're coming.

408
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,260
下面的村庄有北越军的踪影
NVA were seen at a village half a klick down the river.

409
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,290
六队说我们要立即赶去
Now, 6 says to get there ASAP.

410
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,790
留下四个手下和军医
Also, leave four of your men here and a medic.

411
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,260
- 好 - 快点
- All right. - Move it out.

412
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,720
召集所有士兵 快点!
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

413
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,320
曼尼在哪里？
Hey, where's Manny?

414
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,870
曼尼 你在哪里？
Manny, where you at?

415
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:24,170
我们要在入黑前到达村庄
We had to reach the village before dark,

416
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,210
伊利亚等人继续找寻 和等候工程师
We left Elias and some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers,

417
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,000
但最后金找到他
But it was King who found him...

418
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,780
他在下游一千码那里
...about 1000 yards downriver, not far from the village,

419
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,380
谜团被解开了
It was the end of the mystery,

420
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,310
混蛋
The motherfuckers.

421
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:27,160
那个千年村的村民不知道我们会来
The village, which was maybe 1000 years old, didn't know we were coming,

422
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,370
否则他们早就逃走
If they had, they would have run,

423
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,870
巴恩是众矢之的 阿合上尉会经过他
Barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him, our Captain Ahab...

424
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,900
改善事情
...who would set things right again,

425
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,400
那一天我们都很敬爱他
That day, we loved him,

426
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,340
他在那里
There he goes, sarge.

427
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,690
- 把他捡起来 - 好
- Pick him up. - Yeah, you got it, sarge.

428
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:57,890
快来
Let's go.

429
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,940
不要那样望着我
Get that stupid look off your face!

430
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,760
奥尼尔 清除房子
O'Neill, clear out these hooches.

431
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,440
小猪…
Hey, piggy- piggy. Hey, pig.

432
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,080
宾尼 你要烧掉房子
Bunny, you've got to bring the hooches down.

433
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,580
去右边 小心 出发!
Spread out on the right. Watch your back. Let's go!

434
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,710
这里有什么？
What do you got here, huh?

435
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,460
去那边 快!
Get over there! Move it!

436
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,260
来吧 快点!
Come on, let's go!

437
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,460
乔利亚 集合他们
Let's go, Junior, bring them in.

438
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,600
出来 混球! 行动!
Get out of there, you fuckheads! Move!

439
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:00,450
来吧
Come on!

440
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,830
- 把他们赶进猪栏去 - 过来
- Put them in the pigpen! - Get over here.

441
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,400
回去! 住口!
Get back! Shut up!

442
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,430
给我手榴弹
Give me your willie pete.

443
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,500
退后
Get back!

444
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,840
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

445
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,020
住口
Shut up!

446
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,190
赶他们出来
Get them out of here!

447
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,630
妈的! 这里有一个
Oh, fuck! We got one.

448
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,490
赶他出来
Get the fuck out of the hole!

449
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,240
出来 混蛋
Get out of there. Come on, motherfucker!

450
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,700
冷静下来 他们很害怕
Be cool! Be cool! They're scared, man!

451
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,670
他们害怕？我又怎样？
Oh, they're scared, huh? What about me, man?

452
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:55,640
我厌倦这样 快出来 混球 快!
I'm sick of this fucking shit! Come on, motherfucker, move!

453
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,710
看看这混球
Watch this fucker!

454
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,610
他们认为我们为谁而战？
Who the fuck do they think we're fighting for?

455
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,220
- 还有一个 - 你…
- You got one more! - Hey, hey!

456
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,090
有什么发现？
Well, what have we here?

457
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:18,600
我们有一 二 三 四支机关枪 捷克制米克58机关枪
They have one, two, three, four Mag 58 Czechoslovakian machine guns.

458
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,700
他们有二、四…
They got two, four....

459
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,380
他们有足够米粮供应一队军队
Barnes, they got enough rice here to feed a whole fucking regiment.

460
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,010
华伦 带村长来
Sergeant Warren, you bring the honcho over here.

461
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,290
特斯 出来 乔利亚 烧掉房子
Tubbs, get out of there! Junior, burn it!

462
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,750
怎么了？我不会伤害你
What the fuck's the matter? I wasn't gonna hurt you!

463
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,680
我看来想伤害你吗？
Look like I was gonna hurt you?

464
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,120
你为什么不听我说？你他妈的为什么不听我说？
Why didn't you listen to me?! Why didn't you fucking listen to me?!

465
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,890
你这个笨蛋! 你这个王八!
Fucking stupid?! You stupid asshole!

466
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:51,030
他妈的过来! 到这里! 混球!
Get the fuck up here! Come here, motherfucker!

467
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:55,070
你在笑什么？ 你为什么不听我说？
What are you smiling at?! Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?!

468
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,360
杀死他们
Do them, man!

469
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,380
你在笑什么？ 想有点可笑的东西？
What are you smiling at?! You want something to smile at, huh?!

470
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,180
- 想有点可笑的东西？ - 对
- You want something to smile at?! - That's right!

471
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,010
- 混蛋 跳舞吧   - 对
- Dance, motherfucker!  - Yeah!

472
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,380
跛子 跳舞吧
Dance, one-legger!

473
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,920
跳舞…
Dance! Dance!

474
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:17,420
跳舞 跛子
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

475
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,940
来吧
Come on. Come on, let's go, man.

476
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:35,370
他妈的! 他在嘲笑你
Fucking pussy, man! He's laughing at you!

477
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,180
越南人是那样笑的
That's the way the gook laughs.

478
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,050
当然了
Yeah, sure you are!

479
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,350
你很后悔吧？
You're real sorry, ain't you?

480
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,720
你为曼尼他们的死感到内疚吧？
You're just crying your little hearts out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

481
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:49,790
宾尼 算了吧？我们走!
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

482
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,690
你说呢？
What do you say?

483
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:16,250
妈的! 你看到他的头颅是怎样爆开的吗？
Holy shit! You see that fucking head come apart, man?

484
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,080
我从来没见过那样的脑袋
I never seen brains like that before, man.

485
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:26,600
我打赌一定是她指挥一切的
I bet you the old bitch runs the whole fucking show.

486
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:31,130
大概是她割开曼尼的喉咙 她一定也想把我的睾丸割掉
She probably cut Manny's throat. Probably cut my balls off if she could.

487
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,600
宾尼 离开吧 没有人看到什么
Bunny, we leave now, nobody saw a thing!

488
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:35,430
泰勒 你明白吗？
You understand, Taylor?

489
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,100
杀死她吧 杀死整条村的人
Come on, let's fucking do her! Let's do the whole fucking village!

490
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:44,280
这个越南人头目脸上有些疤痕
There's scars on this gook honcho, sarge.

491
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,780
特斯 出来
Get out of here, Tubbs.

492
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,220
他从哪里弄到伤痕？
Where did he get these wounds?

493
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,340
- 他说他在轰炸中受伤 - 他一定是北越的人
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid. - He's a dink for sure.

494
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,100
问他这里为什么会有武器
Ask him why these weapons are here.

495
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,350
他们没有选择 北越杀了抗命的老头目
They had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.

496
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:23,250
- 他说那些米是属于他们 - 莱纳 胡说
- He says all the rice is theirs. - Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

497
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:26,580
我们在河边杀死的越军是谁？
Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?

498
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,100
他不知道 北越军几个月没来过
He doesn't know. The NVA ain't been here in a couple of months.

499
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,340
- 或许他是哨兵   - 当然了
- Maybe he was a scout.   - Yeah, sure. A scout.

500
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,770
那些米和武器是给谁的？
What about the rice and the weapons?! Who they for?!

501
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,230
北越军
An NVC!

502
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,210
他知道我在说什么吧？
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying. Don't you?

503
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,680
他一定知道
Goddamn right he does.

504
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,920
他在说谎
He's lying!

505
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,950
杀死他 看谁会说真话
Waste the fucker! Then see who talks.

506
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,520
他说他什么都不知道
Look, he says he doesn't know anything.

507
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,460
他讨厌北越 但他们擅自来这里
He hates the NVA, but they come when they want and take over.

508
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,060
她在说什么？
What's the bitch saying?

509
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,400
她问我们为什么要杀死猪
She's going on about why we killed the pigs...

510
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,400
他们是农夫 要养活自己
...they're farmers, they have to make a living....

511
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,610
住口
Shut up!

512
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:27,950
叫她住口
Shut her the fuck up!

513
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,810
你叫他快点说 否则我会杀死更多人
You tell him to start talking or I'll waste more of them.

514
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,950
莱纳 告诉他
Tell him, Lerner!

515
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,420
让我们大开杀戒
Let us in on this, all right?

516
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,730
我们杀死整条村吧
Let's go for it! Let's do the whole fucking village!

517
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,060
中士 我们还在等什么？
Come on, sarge. What the fuck are we waiting for?

518
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,600
- 杀死他们 - 走开
- Let's do them! - Out of my way!

519
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,250
这是他的女儿吧？
This is his daughter, right? Right?

520
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:42,450
你说谎! 不 你说谎!  你这个越共!
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

521
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,330
巴恩
Barnes!

522
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,040
你他妈的在做什么？
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

523
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,350
别管闲事 这和你无关
Stay out of this. It ain't your show.

524
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,720
你不是火枪队 猪哥!
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

525
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,790
- 打倒他 - 巴恩 加油
- Get him! - Come on, Barnes!

526
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:21,290
打倒他! … 打烂他的头!
Get him! Get him! Tear his fucking head off!

527
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,770
伊利亚 杀死他
Come on, Elias. Send him to hell!

528
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,070
妈的! 别这样! 停手!
Goddamn it! Come on, break it up!

529
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:39,940
停手
Break it up!

530
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,880
停手
Break it up!

531
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,460
伊利亚 冷静点
Elias, chill.

532
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,730
伊利亚 你死定了 我发誓 你死定了
You're dead, Elias! I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

533
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,120
你会坐牢的
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

534
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:57,270
这件事不会就此罢休的 混蛋
This shit won't wash, you puke!

停手! …住口!
Break it up! Break it up! Shut up!

536
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:03,770
停手 留心听着
Break it up! Listen up!

537
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,840
上尉说烧掉这里 听到了吗？
Captain says to torch this place, hear that?

538
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,480
烧掉这里
Torch this place!

539
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,110
烧掉武器
Blow the weapons in place!

540
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,450
集合他们 我们时间不多
Round up suspected VC and shake it up! We ain't got much light left!

541
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,880
中尉 你为什么不作出行动？
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?

542
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,780
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

543
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,530
你知道我在说什么
You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

544
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,090
不 我不知道 我不知道你他妈的在说什么
No, I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.

545
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,500
快点出发! 快! 听到命令了吧!
Move it out! Let's go! You heard the lieutenant!

546
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:39,040
泰勒 走了 妈的!  烧掉武器 然后离开
Taylor, let's go, for chrissake! Police up the weapons and let's go!

547
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,570
哈洛 来吧
Come on, Harold.

548
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,010
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

549
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,960
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

550
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,270

妈的! 滚开
You fucker! Get out of here!

552
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,910
滚开! …不要那样做
Get the fuck off! Don't do it! Don't do it!

553
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,340
混蛋 这是什么一回事？
You fucker! What is this, huh?!

554
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,910
你是同志吗？
You a homosexual?

555
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,690
你怎么了？她是越南人
What's your problem? She's a fucking dink.

556
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,690
她是人类! 去你的!
She's a fucking human being, man! Fuck you!

557
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,060
泰勒 你这个可恶的新兵
Total fucking cherry, Taylor!

558
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,860
妈的禽兽! 你们全部都是禽兽!
Fucking animal! All of you! You're fucking animals!

559
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,040
混蛋
Fucking lame fuck!

560
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,970
你不属于越南 这里不适合你
You don't belong in the Nam. This ain't your place.

561
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,500
你们一点都不明白吧？
You don't fucking get it, do you?

562
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,710
你们不明白
You just don't fucking get it.

563
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,110
没事的
It's okay.

564
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,850
离开吧
Get out of there!

565
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,050
出发吧
Police up your dicks and let's go.

566
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,180
- 我什么都看不见   - 我看到
- I didn't see anything, sir.   - I did.

567
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,990
巴恩中士说那个是北越兵
Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.

568
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,950
我的报告中 沃夫上尉是目击证人
My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

569
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,730
伊利亚 好
All right, Elias.

570
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,030
- 巴恩中士 - 是
- Staff Sergeant Barnes. - Sir!

571
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:24,360
我们回到总部后 我要详细报告
I want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

572
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,730
你有日志 我有很多目击证人
You got a diary. I have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

573
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,310
不是现在
Not now, goddamn it! Not now!

574
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,640
我们回到总部才调查这件事
We'll get into this at the base camp.

575
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,250
我保证如果发现非法杀戮…
I can promise you, if I find out there was an illegal killing...

576
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,250
一定会有军事法庭
...there will be a court-martial.

577
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:45,720
现在我要全军作战 你们别再吵
Right now, I need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

578
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:49,120
巴恩和伊利亚中士 听到吗？
Staff Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Elias. You hear me?

579
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,360
- 是    - 知道
- Yes, sir.    - Yes, sir.

580
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,860
明天你们从东面再去那越共地堡
We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

581
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,800
你们休息一下  晚上七点钟回来开会
You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 19:00 for a briefing.

582
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,330
- 是     - 是
- Yes, sir.    - Yes, sir.

583
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:11,180
你认为他们会在乎我们吗？
Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

584
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,550
哈洛 也许会是你阻碍了巴恩
It could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

585
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:16,920
那个宾尼呢？
And that Bunny?

586
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,460
他是疯的
That motherfucker's crazy.

587
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,220
他令我不寒而栗
I mean, he scares me.

588
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,560
他很可怕
He just scares me.

589
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,960
你已经受牵连
You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

590
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:30,120
这些越南人比你想像中聪明
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.

591
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:32,400
巴恩知道他在做什么
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

592
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,500
他们是北越兵
They was NVA, every last of them.

593
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,210
他带领我们走到这里了 他会带领我们走完这场战争
He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.

594
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:40,480
我不知道
I don't know, Holmes.

595
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,710
基督教徒不会到处杀人
A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

596
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,820
情况失去控制了 完全失控了
This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

597
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,090
看来你不知道怎样分别…
Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

598
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,760
事情的轻重
...the way you always shoot up that shit.

599
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,230
我不知道…
I don't know, brothers...

600
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,290
但我内心大受伤害
...but I'm hurting real bad inside.

601
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,100
别担心 伊利亚不能证明什么
Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

602
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:08,370
他是个麻烦制造者
He's a troublemaker.

603
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:12,270
伊利亚像华盛顿的政客…
Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

604
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:16,240
想独力打这场仗
...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

605
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,580
这里没有时间进行审讯
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

606
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,850
- 中士     - 谢谢你
- Sarge.      - Thanks, Bun.

607
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:26,290
情况怎样？
How did it go there, Bob?

608
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,650
那个可恶的伊利亚
Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

609
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,970
他是个卑鄙小人
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

610
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,130
他会连累这个连的所有人
He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

611
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,700
有人要教训他
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

612
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:44,540
你认为呢？ 会有调查吗？
So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

613
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,080
鲍布？
Bob?

614
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:52,380
你太担心了 中士会解决他
O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

615
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:00,260
今晚天色很美
It's a beautiful night.

616
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,530
我喜欢这里的夜晚
Yeah, I love this place at night.

617
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,330
繁星…
The stars....

618
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:12,040
它们没有对与错 它们就是在那里
There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

619
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,840
你的比喻很好
That's a nice way of putting it.

620
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,500
巴恩憎恨你吧？
Barnes has it in for you, huh?

621
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,710
巴恩相信他所做的一切
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

622
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,520
你呢？你相信吗？
And you? Do you believe?

623
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,380
1965年时吗？我会相信
ln '65? Yeah.

624
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,490
现在呢？
Now?

625
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,290
不相信
No.

626
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,370
今天所发生的事只是开始
What happened today is just the beginning.

627
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,700
我们会输掉这场仗
We're gonna lose this war.

628
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,010
不会吧
Come on.

629
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,910
你真的认为我们会输？
You really think so? Us?

630
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,580
我们欺负别人太久了
We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...

631
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,150
现在轮到我们被打击
...I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

632
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,200
我每天都在挣扎
Day by day, I struggle to maintain...

633
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:18,090
我努力维持体力和意志
...not only my strength, but my sanity,

634
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,000
一切都很模糊
It's all a blur,

635
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,210
我没有气力写信
I have no energy to write,

636
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,110
我不能分辨对与错
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore,

637
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:29,240
我们的士气低落 出现内讧
The morale of the men is low, A civil war in the platoon,

638
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,050
一半支持伊利亚 一半支持巴恩
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes,

639
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,080
有很多猜忌和憎恨
There's a lot of suspicion and hate,

640
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:39,150
我们竟然在自伤残杀
I can't believe we're fighting each other instead of them,

641
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:45,890
数着日子和留意着周遭 没别的
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face, Not much else,

642
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:48,530
祖母 希望你一切安好
Hope things are well, Grandma,

643
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,700
告诉妈妈和爸爸…
Tell Mom and Dad I...

644
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:54,500
你知道告诉他们什么的 柯里斯上
Well, just tell them, Chris,

645
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:20,430
我知道你以为会被派去洗衣服
Hey, big boy. I know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out.

646
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,130
我要把自己涂白 才能得到那些工作
Hell, I gotta paint myself white just to get one of those jobs.

647
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:28,430
我递了申请去割包皮 我要离开
Got my request in for a circumcision. I'm getting my big ass out of here.

648
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,710
你会成为犹太教教士吗？
What are you gonna do, become a rabbi?

649
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,030
水蛭
Leech.

650
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:39,080
继续走
All right! Move it out!

651
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,280
不要喝 你会得痢疾
Don't drink that, asshole. You're gonna get malaria.

652
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,120
我希望会
Yeah, I hope so.

653
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,290
去吧
Let's go.

654
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,830
军医 莱纳被击中
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

655
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,670
中士 华伦被击中

It's an ambush! They were just waiting for us here!

658
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,220
- 谁负责防守？    - 莱纳和华伦
- Who's on point?     - Lerner and Warren.

659
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,040
你去哪里？
Where are you going?!

660
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:57,690
天啊! 混球! 派火力上前
Goddamn it, you assholes! Get some firepower up there!

661
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:58,890
对

662
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,170
小心 火箭炮
Watch out! Rockets!

663
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,210
莱纳在哪里？
Where the fuck is Lerner?

664
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:23,080
他在木头那边
He's over there! By the log!

665

01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,520
中尉 他们会步步进逼
Lieutenant, they'll get in tight under the arty!

669
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:04,990
我看到缺口 让我带人去那边
I saw a cut. Let me take some men and roll up that flank.

若越军进入这些洞 我们就要交锋
Dinks get in these holes, we'll be in a crossfire.

675
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,980
- 我们会互相开火    - 听来很不寻常
- We'll shoot each other.    - Sounds far- out to me.

676
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,390
我在1966年的战役里见过
I've seen it happen. la Drang in '66.

677

我不想在外面孤军作战
I don't want to be stuck out there with my ass hanging in the breeze.

681
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,400
伊利亚 不要教我怎样打仗
You don't tell me how to run my war, Elias.

682
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:51,040
你去呼喝你的手下好了
You go crying to fucking brigade on your own time.

705
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:34,740

706
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:37,170
军医 照顾他

你这个自大混蛋
You ignorant asshole!

710
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,850
你给他们什么座标？
What the fuck coordinates are you giving?

711
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,890
你的座标已经令很多人受伤
You wasted a lot of people up there with your fucked- up fire mission!

712
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:57,590
你知道吗？
Do you know that?

713
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,660
你知道吗？妈的!
Do you know that? Ah, shit!

炮手 这是B2
Redleg! Redleg! Ripper Bravo 2.

715
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:10,440
停火…
Check your fire! Check your fire!

716
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:21,650
他们来了

他们会从那里过来
They'll be coming from over there.

719
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:35,960
只要被他们攻破 我们便死定了
Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.

720
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,990
你去哪里？
Where the hell are you going?

721
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:41,760
到下游大约一百米处…
Down by the river about 100 meters...

722
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:43,560
以防他们准备从外围进攻
...in case they try to flank us.

723
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:46,500
第三连正在后面赶来
3rd Platoon is coming behind us. Watch for them.

724
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:48,540
我可以和你一起去吗？
Hey. Can I go with you?

725
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,380
不 我单独行事较敏捷
No. I move faster alone.

726
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:03,390
让炮兵队来处理
Let's let arty do a bit of the work.

727
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,560
叫所有人去教堂…

...and link up with 3rd Platoon. You got that?

729
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:13,670
伊利亚怎样？他会孤立无援
What about Elias? If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

730
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:16,910
中尉 你也快去
You just haul ass too, lieutenant.

731
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,100

Kiss my ass. Man, I never thought I'd get hit.

738
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:18,700
你击中两个混蛋
A lung, babe. You got two of them fuckers.

739
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,930
伊利亚在哪里？一班越兵刚经过
Where's Elias? A bunch of gooks came through here.

749
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,580
泰勒 你去哪里？
Taylor, where are you going?

750
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,380
伊利亚死了
Elias is dead.

751
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,720
和他们一起撤退
Fall back with the platoon.

01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,480
他死了？
He's dead?

754
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:06,560
对 他在一百米外
Yeah, he's back there about 100 meters.

755

你看到他吗？哪里？
You saw him? Where?

756

Oh, fuck!

761

他们抓到伊利亚
They've got Elias!

762
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:30,910
什么？
What?

763
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,810
退后…

停火…
Hold your arms, Guns, hold off,

766
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:17,380
他杀死他

767
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:21,120
我知道是他 我看到他的眼神
I know he did. I saw his eyes when he came in.

768
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:24,990
你怎知不是越兵？你没有证据
How do you know the dinks didn't get him? You got no proof.

769
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:27,630
证据就在他的眼神 我看得出
Proof's in the eyes. When you know, you know.

770
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,020
你也看见 我知道你在想什么
You saw. I know what you were thinking.

771
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:31,890
我们今天解决他
I say we frag him tonight.

772
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:34,200
我赞成 以牙还牙
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

773
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,300
让军事法庭处理吧
I say let military justice do the job on him.

774
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:42,170
去他的军事法庭!  你在说笑吗？
Come on, fuck the military justice! Are you joking me?

775
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:46,500
他们会相信谁？奥尼尔？宾尼？ 全是胡说!
Whose story you think they'll believe? O'NeilI's? Bunny's? Bullshit!

776
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:50,910
巴恩不会放过你的
You try that, Barnes will shove it back up your ass, with a candle on it.

777
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,910
你认为我们应怎做？
What do you suggest we do?

778
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:58,250
你们小心  巴恩会一个个地解决他们
Watch your own asses. Barnes will be coming down on all of them.

779
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:01,760
你们忘记和伊利亚的美好日子吗？
You gonna forget about Elias? All the good times we had here?

780
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,660
你想把头砍下来治头痛？
Shit, you trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.

781
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:09,340
伊利亚没有叫你为他打仗
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him.

782
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:13,830
如果真的有天堂 天啊 我希望真的有
And if there's a heaven, and God, I hope there is...

783
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:18,840
他会在上面喝到大醉
...he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit...

784
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:21,820
因为他把痛苦留在这里
...because he left his pains down here.

785
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:25,380
你错了 总之巴恩是杀人凶手
You're wrong! Anyway you cut it, Barnes is a murderer!

786
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,660
- 对 - 泰勒…
- Right on. - Taylor...

787
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:33,190
你当初入伍时说很欣赏巴恩
...when you first came in here, you told me how you admired the bastard.

788
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:37,730
- 我错了 - 你做任何事都是错的
- I was wrong. - You've never been right about nothing!

789
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:41,230
你们这班混蛋 留心听着
Dig this, you assholes, and dig it good.

790
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,470
巴恩中枪七次都没有死去
Barnes been shot seven times, and he ain't dead.

791
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:47,670
那对你有意思吗？
Does that mean anything to you?

792
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,410
巴恩是不会死的
Barnes ain't meant to die.

793
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:55,220
唯一能杀死他的是他自己
The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.

794
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:57,650
你们在谈死亡吗？
Talking about killing?

795
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:11,830
你们是专家吗？
You all experts?

796
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,000
你们都知道杀戮吗？
You all know about killing?

797
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:19,910
我想听听 猪头
Well, I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

798
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,270
你们抽这个来逃避现实？
You smoke this shit to escape from reality?

799
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,050
我不需要这个
Me, I don't need this shit.

800
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,490
我就是现实
I am reality.

801
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:53,500
现实应该是这样 而现实就是这样
There's the way it ought to be, and there's the way it is.

802
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,300
伊利亚满口一派胡言
Elias was full of shit.

803
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:03,210
伊利亚是个斗士
Elias was a crusader.

804
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:08,820
我不会跟听从命令的人作对
Now, I got no fight with any man who does what he's told.

805
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,820
但当他不听命时…
But when he don't...

806
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,890
运作便会崩溃
...the machine breaks down.

807
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:18,030
运作崩溃时 我们就会崩溃
And when the machine breaks down, we break down.

808
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:21,200
我不会许容那样的事
I ain't going to allow that.

809
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,170
你们任何一个都不能
From any of you.

810
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:25,870
一个都不可以
Not one.

811
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:44,450
你们都爱伊利亚
You all love Elias.

812
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,960
你们想为他报仇
You want to kick ass.

813
01:24:57,910 --> 01:25:01,210
我独个儿在这里
Well, here I am. All by my lonesome.

814
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:06,140
没有人会知道
And ain't nobody gonna know.

815
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:14,320
你们六个对我一个
Six of you boys against me.

816
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:21,920
杀我吧
Kill me.

817
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:41,980
我卑视你们
I shit on all of you.

818
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,790
混蛋
You motherfucker!

819
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:54,220
打吧
Come on, man.

820
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,460
柯里斯 打他
Get him, Chris.

821
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:03,130
巴恩 不要下手
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man!

822
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:05,700
你要坐牢的
You'll go dinky dau in LBJ, man.

823
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:09,010
杀军人要坐十年牢 十年
Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years.

824
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,070
你想想吧
Climb the fucking walls, man.

825
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,150
不要下手
Don't do it.

826
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,660
死亡？
Death?

827
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,800
你们对死亡有什么认识？
What do you all know about death?

828
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:55,360
我们翌日被派回到山谷里
They sent us baCk into the valley the next day...

829
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:59,420
进入离柬埔寨约二千米的战区
...about 2000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter,

830
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,590
我们好像回到案发现场
It felt like we were returning to the sCene of a Crime,

831
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:40,720
A连在前一天被重击
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable forCe,

832
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,330
C连在那一天被袭击
Charlie Company had been probed that night,

833
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,670
山谷里有其他战事…
There were other battalions in the valley...

834
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:49,880
但我们是引他们出来的饵
...but we knew we were the bait to lure them out,

835
01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:54,770
141北越军就在下面某处
Somewhere out there was the entire 141st NVA regiment,

836
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,700
他们昨晚想袭击C连
Caught them trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.

837
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:19,040
他们发现地图
They found maps on them, man.

838
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:24,080
听说每个散兵坑都有地雷
Got a friend at Battalion, says they had every foxhole here fixed on.

839
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:28,820
知道我方的距离、林木线和地雷
Distances, tree lines, our claymores, everything.

840
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:30,710
情况不妙
This is bad, man.

841
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:35,480
- 我有不祥之兆   - 听说我们身在柬埔寨
- I got bad vibes here.   - I also heard we're in Cambodia now.

842
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,380
柬埔寨？你在开玩笑
Cambodia? Man, you're kidding me.

843
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:40,860
你想见我？
You wanted to see me, sir?

844
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:45,830
拉姆治 伊利亚小组归你
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

845
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:50,040
小组？我不知道我的连叫小组
Squad? I didn't know we were still referring to this platoon as squads.

846
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:54,710
我要你去那两个坑
I want you to take those two holes, right there and there.

847
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:57,810
跟在上面的巴恩 和在下面的金联络
Tie it off with Barnes up here and King down there.

848
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:01,140
长官 对不起…
Begging your pardon, sir...

849
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:05,120
那两个坑距离太远 一个连队可以从中通过
...my two holes are so far apart, a regiment could run between them.

850
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:07,010
我只有五个军人活着
I have five live bodies left.

851
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,880
我不想听你的问题 新兵很快到
I don't want to hear your problems. You'll get new men any day.

852
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:12,850
你要和别人一样作战
Make do like everybody else.

853
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,630
- 我没有要求这个   - 我不想再听
- I didn't ask for this.  - I don't want to hear it.

854
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,160
- 你不想再听？   - 对
- You don't want to hear it? - That's right.

855
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:21,800
因为老实说我毫不在乎
Because, to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.

856
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:24,830
我不再在乎
I just don't give a flying fuck anymore.

857
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:34,450
我很高兴我不用和他们一起去
I'm glad I ain't going with them.

858
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:39,820
外面有一头饥饿的野兽
Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.

859
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:42,290
真失败
What a fucking bummer.

860
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:46,860
只剩十天了 我仍要面对这一切
Ten days and a wake- up, and I'm still dealing with this shit.

861
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:52,020
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

862
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,560
你为什么不写信？
Why ain't you writing nobody?

863
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:56,860
你的父母呢？
What about your folks?

864
01:29:58,210 --> 01:29:59,760
你向我提起的祖母怎样？
That grandma you told me about?

865
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:03,340
女朋友？
Girl?

866
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:07,710
你有父母吧？
You got parents, don't you?

867
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:09,870
一定有些亲密的人
There must be somebody.

868
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:12,820
没有
No, there's nobody.

869
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,890
你抽太多了
You been smoking too much of this shit.

870
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,760
你要控制一下 令人颓丧
Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

871
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,670
我记得你初来时什么都不懂
I remember when you first come out here to the bush, you's green as...

872
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,290
你可曾被无法 摆脱的错误缠绕着？
You ever get caught in a mistake you just can't get out of?

873
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:34,240
总有方法解决的
There's a way out of anything.

874
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:37,980
只要你振作精神
Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry...

875
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,210
一定有方法的
...and the worm will turn.

876
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:44,710
你还有多少天？
How many days you short?

877
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:49,550
不只是我 而是整个事情
It's not just me. It's how the whole thing works.

878
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:51,520
像伊利亚般的人要牺牲
People like Elias get wasted.

879
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:55,560
巴恩那种人却能继续为所欲为
People like Barnes go on making up all the rules any way they want.

880
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:59,590
我们只能逆来顺受吗？
So, what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it.

881
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,830
我们不用理会那些事情
We just don't add up to dry shit.

882
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:07,930
谁说你需要的？ 你只需要活着离开这里
Whoever said we did? All you got to do is make it out of here...

883
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:12,580
然后每天快乐地生活
...and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life. Gravy.

884
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:17,940
你是理想主义者
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

885
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:22,210
收拾你的行装 你的命令刚下达
Collect up your shit. Your orders just come through.

886
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,850
不要骗我
Man, don't fuck with me.

887
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:26,790
你要邀请信吗？
Oh, what do you need, a written invitation?

888
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:31,690
天啊! 他们做错事
Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers done made a mistake!

889
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:33,500
他们竟然饶我一命
They cut me some slack!

890
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,500
你有十分钟时间赶去搭直升机
You got 10 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here.

891
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:39,430
因为如果你不上机…
Because if you're not on it...

892
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:41,310
我便会去
...I'm gonna be.

893
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,410
泰勒 法兰西准备好了
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

894
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,410
太好了 金 我为你感到高兴 回家吧!
That's great, King, I'm happy for you. Take it on home for me.

895
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,950
你有我的地址 你知道怎么联络我
You got my address. You know where to reach me anytime.

896
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:55,010
我要走了 我不想错过直升机
I gotta di di, Don't want to miss that chopper.

897
01:31:59,330 --> 01:32:01,660
- 你没事吧？   - 我没事
- You okay?     - Yeah, I'm okay.

898
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:03,720
记住放松点
Remember, take it easy.

899
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,670
不要想太多 别做傻瓜
Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool.

900
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:10,630
记住这里没有人是懦夫
Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here.

901
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,670
我的朋友
My man.

902
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:21,820
我送你出去
I'll walk you out, man.

903
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,310
金 保重
Take it easy, King.

904
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:31,120
- 我会的     - 再见
- I'll take it any way I can get it. - I hear you. Later.

905
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:35,290
很痛 中士 不要碰它
I'm pretty fucked up, sarge. Don't touch it!

906
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:37,800
我一定要上直升机
I gotta get on the chopper, man.

907
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:40,630
- 有什么问题？   - 他说不能走路
- So, what's the problem? - Says he can't walk.

908
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,100
可恶
Shit.

909
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:45,240
马丁…
Martin...

910
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:47,370
穿上靴子
...get your boots on.

911
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:54,810
下次给我见到你喷防蚊水…
And the next time I catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your feet...

912
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:57,550
我会送你上军事法庭
...I'll court- martial your nigger ass.

913
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:00,640
送我去吧
Then court- martial me, motherfucker!

914
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:03,920
逮捕我啊! 送我去坐牢吧
Bust my ass! Send me to fucking Long Binh!

915
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:05,450
下手吧
Do your fucking worst!

916
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:09,200
你们白人欺负我
You white folks got your last klick out of Junior!

917
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:12,600
奥尼尔 把蜈蚣拿来
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

918
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,800
- 中士？    - 是
- Sarge?     - Yeah.

919
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:19,840
我找到那毛茸茸、红黑色的虫
That long, hairy, red and black bastard I found in the ammo crate.

920
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:23,580
我会把它放进他的伤口
I'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch.

921
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:24,840
我记得了
I remember now.

922
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:28,180
等一下
Hold up, man!

923
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,250
等一下好吗？
You just hold up and wait, okay?

924
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:33,110
我会走路了
Fuck it, I'll walk! I'll fucking walk!

925
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:36,050
我要和他同一个坑？
Fucking pussy! Sarge, I gotta have him in my hole?

926
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:37,550
对
Yeah.

927
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,520
我可以和你谈谈吗？
Bob, I'd like to speak to you a minute.

928
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:46,960
我不能再忍受了
I can't take it no more.

929
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,010
什么事？
Yeah, what is it?

930
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:55,470
我有伊利亚的假期 有三天
Bob, I got Elias' R and R. It's coming up in three days.

931
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:58,470
我想回去夏威夷见柏丝
I was thinking about going to Hawaii and see Patsy.

932
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:01,140
我从没向你要求过任何事
I never asked you for a thing over here.

933
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,450
坦白说…
Well, to be honest with you...

934
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:07,280
我想和金一起坐直升机回去 你觉得呢？
...I was hoping you'd put me on a chopper with King. What do you say?

935
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,180
我不能让你那样做
I can't do that for you.

936
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,150
你知道这里很需要人手
You know we need every swinging dick in the field.

937
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:15,860
你可以跟我说 我只是请三天假
You can talk to me, for chrissake! I'm just asking for three days.

938
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,720
我告诉你不可以
I am talking to you, Red. And I'm telling you no.

939
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:21,600
回到散兵坑
Get back in your foxhole.

940
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:25,630
我有不祥之兆 知道吗？
Bob, I've got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

941
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,400
我今次有不祥之兆
I mean I've got a bad feeling.

942
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:31,480
我觉得我不能活着离开这里
I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.

943
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:33,680
你明白吗？
You understand what I'm saying?

944
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,510
每个人都会死的
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

945
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:46,220
可恶
Oh, shit!

946
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:04,110
混蛋们 再见
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

947
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:18,380
埋伏在哪里？
Where's that fucking ambush?

948
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:23,390
他们不会等 他们现在就来了
They ain't even waiting till later. It's fucking coming now, man.

乔利亚 我们所做的一切
You know, Junior? Some of the things we done, man...

951
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:36,840
我不觉得我们在做错事
...I don't feel like we done something wrong.

952
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:39,170
但有时…
But sometimes, man...

953
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:43,180
我有不祥的感觉
...I get this bad feeling.

954
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:48,550
我坦然对随军牧师说我喜欢这里
I told the padre the truth. I like it here.

955
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:51,650
你可以为所欲为 没有人理会你
You get to do what you want, nobody fucks with you.

956
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:54,360
你只用担心死亡
The only worry you got is dying.

957
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:57,060
反正死的时候你不会知道
And if that happens, you won't know about it...

958
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,260
那么担心什么？
...so, what the fuck, man?

959
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:03,070
我要和你同一个坑？
Shit. I got to be in this hole with you, man?

960
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,300
我早知道我不应该来
I just know I shouldn't have come.

961
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:12,070
不用担心 你和爱迪墨菲在一起
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging with Audie Murphy here.

是
Yes, sir.

1066
01:53:06,990 --> 01:53:08,660
- 准备好了吗？   - 好了
- Ready?    - You bet.

1067
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:40,380
现在回想一切…
I think now, looking back...

1068
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:45,590
我们不是对抗敌人 而是自己
...we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves...

1069
01:54:45,930 --> 01:54:48,190
敌人就在我们心中
...and the enemy was in us,

1070
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,520
战争对我来说现在已经完结
The war is over for me now...

1071
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:56,670
但它永远会存留在我的心中
...but it will always be there the rest of my days,

1072
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,100
伊利亚会和巴恩…
As I'm sure Elias will be...

1073
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:02,940
为了像罗德所说的"灵魂的掌控"继续作战
...fighting with Barnes for, what Rhah Called, possession of my soul,

1074
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:06,910
我有时会觉得…
There are times sinCe...

1075
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:11,310
我是那两个父亲的儿子
...I have felt like the Child born of those two fathers,

1076
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:15,720
但无论如何…
But be that as it may...

1077
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:20,020
我们有责任重建社会…
...those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again,

1078
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:22,920
教导别人我们认识的一切…
To teaCh to others what we know...

1079
01:55:24,330 --> 01:55:26,930
我们利用剩下的一生…
...and to try with what's left of our lives...

1080
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:31,000
尝试找寻生命的意义
...to find a goodness and meaning to this life,

1081
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:47,750
献给在越战牺牲的士兵
