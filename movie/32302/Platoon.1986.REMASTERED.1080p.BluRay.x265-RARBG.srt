Having compass trouble again?

22
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:27,698
继续走
Get a move on, boy.

23
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:58,558
你还在等什么？
Boy, what you waiting for?

24
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:00,268
他不会咬你
He ain't gonna bite you.

25
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,408
那是越南兵 死了

30
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:47,208
泰勒 你怎么了？
What's the matter with you, Taylor?

31
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:49,548
你是个大混蛋
You are one simple son of a bitch.

32
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:51,188
中士 对不起
I'm sorry, sergeant.

33
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:54,888
叫另外那个新丁过来 葛拿 还有军医

34
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:57,088
葛拿 军医 上前来

35
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,918
葛拿 军医 上前来

39
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:30,348
我脖子全都是蚂蚁
I got ants all over my neck.

40
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:34,298
这些是红蚂蚁

41
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:38,288
红蚂蚁是杀手 黑蚂蚁最可怕

我很累
I'm so tired!

44
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:48,868
只喝一点
Just a little.

45
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,338
不要喝太多 你不要再喝了
Don't drink too much. I don't want you drinking any more.

46
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:53,838
我不想你抽搐
I don't want you cramping up.

47
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:56,518
你带着太多东西
You're humping too much stuff.

48
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,818
有一半是不需要的
You don't need half this shit.

49
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,018
我帮你拿
I'll haul it for you.

50
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:06,228
但请你下次先向我请示
But next time check with me first, all right?

51
00:08:07,398 --> 00:08:08,588
谢谢你 中士
Thanks, sarge.

52
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:17,438
- 你有没有事？ - 没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

53
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:30,608
这是总部 有直升机接近你们
2-2, this is six, I understand you have a bird inbound at your pos,

54
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,788
总部 请留意
Bravo Six, be advised.

55
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:40,058
军资直升机正驶来
Resupply helo is inbound at this time, Over,

56
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:46,968
快点搬军火下来
Go, you people! Get that ammo off now!

57
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:32,078
这个字不是这样写的
It ain't D-E-R-E. It's D-E-A-R.

58
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:36,178
而且莎拉也不是那样写的 笨蛋
And Sarah ain't got no two R's, King. Damn, you dumb!

59
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,618
没关系 她会明白我的意思
Don't matter. She know what I mean.

60
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:43,088
她也不大认识字
She don't read too good nohow.

61
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,928
你看 又是猪肉
Look at this shit! Pork again!

62
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:55,928
我跟你换你的火鸡 我不能再吃这玩意了
Trade me that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man. I can't eat this shit.

63
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:57,608
你抽了什么？
What you been smoking?

64
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:03,508
希望你不用洗衣服 你要运动一下
I hope you don't get that laundry gig. Your ass need to hump, hump.

65
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:06,248
白小子 你在等什么？
Hey, white boy! What you waiting for?

66
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,538
那个洞不会自己出现的
That hole won't dig itself.

67
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:11,248
快点掘
Come on. Get your dick skin on that thing!

68
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,888
时间无多 快点掘…
You ain't got all day! Dig, dig!

69
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:19,458
有人写过 "地狱是不可理喻的"
Somebody once wrote, ''Hell is the impossibility of reason, ''

70
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,598
这个地方就像地狱
That's what this place feels like,' hell,

71
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:25,058
我只是来了一周 但已经讨厌这里
I hate it already, and it's only been a week,

72
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:27,698
祖母 这一周很痛苦
Some goddamn week, Grandma,

73
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:32,468
最辛苦的事就是这星期站岗三次
The hardest thing I've ever done is go on point three times this week,

74
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:34,398
我不知道我在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing,

75
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:38,078
我连越共在我面前出现也不知道
A gook could be right in front of me and I wouldn't know it,

76
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:39,968
我实在很累
I'm so tired,

77
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:42,518
我们早上五点起床…
We get up at 5,'00 a,m...

78
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:47,588
整天走动 四五点钟扎营 掘壕沟 进食…
...hump all day, camp around 4 or 5, dig a foxhole, eat...

79
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,488
然后整晚埋伏 或是当哨兵
...then put out an all-night ambush or a listening post,

80
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:54,418
我是新来的 没有人教我任何事
Nobody tells me how to do anything because I'm new,

81
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,998
没人理会新丁 他们连你的名字也不想知道
Nobody cares about the new guys, They don't want to know your name,

82
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:03,898
新丁的生命不重要 因为他没有经验
A new guy's life isn't worth much because he hasn't put his time in yet,

83
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:08,838
若在越南战死 最好在最初几周
If you're gonna get killed in Nam, it's better to get it in the first weeks,

84
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:11,908
原因是你不会受太多苦
The logic being, you don't suffer that much,

85
00:11:12,248 --> 00:11:14,278
如果幸运 留在外围防线…
If you're lucky, you stay in the perimeter...

86
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:18,818
守卫时能够睡三至四小时
...then pull a guard shift, so you sleep three or four hours,

87
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:20,418
但你不能真的入睡
But you don't really sleep,

88
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:30,928
我认为我撑不到一年
I don't think I can keep this up for a year, Grandma,

89
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:33,658
我不应该来这里
I've made a big mistake coming here,

90
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:38,998
我们有很多活动
We got beaucoup movement.

91
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,478
第三部队在15公里外被袭击
3rd Battalion got hit 15 klicks north of here.

92
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:47,808
越共在树上挂上地雷
Charlie had claymores strung in the trees.

93
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:52,178
整排军队被炸 真倒霉
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit.

94
00:11:58,228 --> 00:11:59,698
两个中尉和一个上尉被炸死
Got two lieutenants and a captain.

95
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:01,188
我的天
Jesus.

96
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:05,258
你想谁去埋伏？
All right, who do you want on ambush?

97
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,458
奕礼 你带你的小队出去
Elias, you take your squad out.

98
00:12:10,238 --> 00:12:14,068
华伦 留下 我需要德斯和小尊
Warren, stay in, but I need Tex and Junior from your squad.

99
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:14,808
知道
Roger that.

100
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:17,308
调动到20M的位置
Move out in 2-0 mikes.

101
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:20,578
我以为今晚轮到奥尼尔
I thought it was O'NeilI's turn tonight.

102
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:22,388
托斯和莫浩经验不足
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

103
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:26,948
福生明天放假 还要他们去吗？
Fu Sheng is going on R and R tomorrow. You want to send them out on ambush?

104
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:29,048
你要带新丁去
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

105
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:33,758
他们什么都不懂 可能会遇到事情 仔细想想
They don't know shit and we'll probably run into something. Think about it.

106
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,998
太好了 你想我怎样做？
Great. What do you want me to do?

107
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:40,528
你想我为了一个混蛋要好好睡觉 而让手下被杀吗？
Get one of my guys zapped so a lame ass can get his beauty sleep?

108
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:42,838
奥尼尔…
Hey, O'Neill...

109
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:44,538
别再啰嗦
...take a break.

110
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:47,108
你不用每天都这么讨厌
You needn't be a prick every day.

111
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:49,038
奕礼 叫手下准备好
Elias, get your men ready.

112
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:53,278
他来了三年 以为自己是耶稣
Guy's in 3 years, thinks he's Jesus Christ.

113
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:56,708
奥尼尔 他们留下 但你要去
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out.

114
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,818
我需要有经验的老兵
I need veterans out there.

115
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:01,748
彭斯中士？
Sergeant Barnes?

116
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:11,128
在他们面前应由我下命令
I think in front of the men, I need to give the orders.

117
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:17,328
是 长官
Yes, sir.

118
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:22,678
看来会下雨
Shit, looks like rain.

119
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:25,408
我们整晚都要在雨中了
It's gonna piss on us all night.

120
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:30,878
会令你脸烂掉
It'll put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours.

121
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:35,758
你为那个白人而冒险
Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man.

122
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:37,458
这里是没有公义的
No justice around here.

123
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:41,388
奥尼尔又触怒中尉了？
What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

124
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:43,628
为什么总是我们负责埋伏？
Why do we always get fucking ambush?

125
00:13:43,998 --> 00:13:46,798
这是因为他们在玩政治
Because it's politics, man. Politics.

126
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:51,908
- 我有否给你看过露珍的照片？ - 没有
- Did I show you a picture of Lucy Jean? - No, you didn't.

127
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:55,138
她会是我的另一半
She's the one for me all right, that Lucy Jean.

128
00:13:55,478 --> 00:13:57,068
她也在等我
She's waiting for me too.

129
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:59,908
她很漂亮 你很幸福
She's real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

130
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:02,188
你有你女朋友的照片吗？
You got a picture of your girl?

131
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:05,788
那我们有一个被留在家乡的可怜女孩 不是吗？
That leaves some unlucky girl back home, don't it?

132
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:08,918
插进去
Tuck this in.

133
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:11,628
装进去
Shit-can this.

134
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,498
不需要这个 转身

为国家效力

It's weird, They're the bottom of the barrel, and they know it,

165
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:46,408
所以他们自称平凡人

因为平凡人什么都能承受

I broke a hundred the other day.

269
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:13,328
还有92天 4月17日
Ninety-two left to go. April 17th.

270
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:15,498
我便可以回加州了
Home to California.

271
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:19,428
我会坐在海滩上看美女
I'll be sitting outside checking out the babes on the beach.

272
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:22,038
冲浪一定会很好玩
The surfing's gonna be good.

273
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:25,538
三月在田纳西州
March, man, in Tennessee.

274
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:30,248
可以闻到松树的气味 可以在河边闻到女人的气味
Sniff the pines. Sniff that pussy down by the river.

275
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:32,178
真棒
Hot damn!

276
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:35,678
泰勒 你还有多少天？
Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?

277
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:38,628
- 三百什么？ - 三十二
- Three hundred and what? - Thirty-two.

278
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:42,358
332天
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

279
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:44,528
傻小子
Sin loi, my boy.

280
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:48,528
我不记得那个日子了
I can't even remember when I was 332, man.

281
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:53,168
你要向前数 好像你已来了40天
You gotta count backwards or something, like you got 40 days in.

282
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:55,468
想的乐观些
Think positive, dude.

283
00:28:57,148 --> 00:29:00,708
你怎会来这里？你看来受过教育
How in the fuck did you get here anyway? You look educated.

284
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:03,318
- 我自愿来的 - 什么？
- I volunteered for it. - You did what?

285
00:29:03,648 --> 00:29:04,618
我自愿来的
I volunteered.

286
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:09,518
我退出大学 想加入越战
I dropped out of college and told them I wanted infantry, combat, Vietnam.

287
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:12,558
你自愿来的？
You volunteered for this shit, man?

288
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:14,488
你能相信吗？
Can you believe that?

289
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:17,718
你放弃念大学实在太疯狂
You is a crazy fucker, giving up college.

290
00:29:18,938 --> 00:29:21,668
我在大学什么都学不到
It didn't make much sense. I wasn't learning anything.

291
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:26,408
为什么穷人就要去打仗 有钱人就不用？
Why should the poor kids go to war and the rich kids get away with it?

292
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:28,738
他是个斗士
What we got here is a crusader.

293
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,508
- 看来是了 - 可恶
- Sounds like it. - Shit.

294
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:36,518
你一定是很富有才会那样想
You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that.

295
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:39,388
大家都知道…
Everybody knows...

296
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:43,788
穷人总是被有钱人欺负
...the poor's always fucked over by the rich.

297
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,748
那是不能改变的事实
Always have, always will.

298
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:54,428
如果你上道 我会介绍一些大头给你认识
If you be cool, I'll introduce you to some of the heads.

299
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:56,238
什么样的大头？
What are the heads?

300
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:58,338
晚一点吧
Later, man.

301
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:06,708
怎么了？
What's up, brother?

302
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,508
大人驾到 发生什么事了？
Your Highness has arrived. What's happening?

303
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:19,188
我以为你在柬埔寨
I thought you was hanging ten in Cambodia.

304
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:29,838
你为什么在这里？
Why are you in the underworld?

305
00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:34,838
这个不是泰勒 泰勒中枪了 是柯里斯 他被救活了
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This is Chris. He been resurrected.

306
00:30:43,988 --> 00:30:46,078
泰勒 你跛了吗？
You lame, Taylor?

307
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:48,218
你是跛的吗？
Are you lame or something?

308
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:52,018
继续吧 抽一口吧
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

309
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:07,108
抽一口享受一下吧
Your shit's in the wind, troop.

310
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:11,938
你好吗？
Hey, man. What's happening?

311
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:14,508
不是那样叫的
If you do that ''baa,'' you do it right.

312
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:19,958
你很古怪
You're weird, man.

313
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:23,448
你是个孩子 我不会在你身上浪费时间
You're a child. I don't waste time on you.

314
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:36,628
- 第一次吗？ - 是
- First time? - Yeah.

315
00:31:39,238 --> 00:31:42,138
那么你一定会上瘾
Then the worm has definitely turned for you, man.

316
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:45,378
感觉好吗？
Feel good?

317
00:31:46,248 --> 00:31:49,478
感觉很好 我的脖子不痛了
Yeah, it feels good. I got no pain in my neck now.

318
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:52,918
感觉很好已足够
Feeling good's good enough.

319
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,758
放入口里
Put your mouth on this.

320
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,248
大家在哪里？
Where the hell is everybody, man?

321
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:34,358
大家都正在享受 一群毒虫 他们觉得他们很特别
They're getting high. Bunch of hopheads. They think they're special.

322
00:32:35,268 --> 00:32:37,828
你听 很糟的演奏
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

323
00:32:38,968 --> 00:32:41,558
烦透的噪音 就是那样
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

324
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:44,138
和你一样那么烦
Make about as much sense as you do.

325
00:32:44,568 --> 00:32:47,598
他们都在埋怨…
All them chucks be rapping about how they losing their ho...

326
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:50,678
埋怨自己没有钱
...saying how they ain't got no bread for beer.

327
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:55,908
去他的! 给我黑人音乐 开始吧？
Fuck that honky shit! Gotta get me some Motown jams, dig it?

328
00:32:57,818 --> 00:32:59,878
你干嘛那样说？
What are you talking that shit for?

329
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:02,048
小尊 你吸食过毒品吗？
Junior, you ever smoke any shit?

330
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:03,288
对
That's right.

331
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:07,188
你们想用毒品荼毒黑人
You trying to keep the black man down and string him out on that shit.

332
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,058
但黑人很快就会推翻你们
But the time's coming when the black man will throw that yoke off.

333
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:14,168
很简单 释放你的心灵就行 你的身体就会跟随
Simple. Free your mind, your ass will follow.

334
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:19,508
明白 你吸那东西 一切会变得离奇
Yeah, I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit and everything gets weird.

335
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:22,798
越南人在草丛散布化学毒药
You hear about gooks putting chemicals in the grass...

336
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:25,548
令我们不再打仗 变成反战者吧
...so we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

337
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,818
不用担心 你怎样都是个杀手
But don't you worry, Bunny, you's a killer anyway.

338
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:31,708
但我仍然喜欢女人
But I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

339
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:35,118
除了赛车 没东西比得上女人
Nothing like a piece of pussy, except maybe the lndy 500.

340
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,048
只有女人死了遗留她的身体给你
Only way you get pussy is if the bitch dies and wills it to you...

341
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:41,018
你或许才会有
...and then maybe.

342
00:33:45,338 --> 00:33:46,598
宾尼 你好吗？
How's it going, Bunny?

343
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:48,388
中尉

你喜欢吗？
You like that?

346
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:55,468
很棒
Terrific.

347
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:57,208
我会寄回家
I'll send it home.

348
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,448
小尊
Hey, Junior.

349
00:34:00,578 --> 00:34:02,548
- 中尉 - 你好

350
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:14,028

谢谢
Thank you, sir.

352
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:19,528
- 你有什么需要吗？ - 没有
- You need anything? - No, sir.

353
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:21,468
这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

354
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,838
这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

355
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:25,868
他被奥尼尔勒着
He's in the O'Neill death grip.

356
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:28,798
他不知道要害怕还是瞎了较好
He doesn't know whether to shit or go blind.

357
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:31,408
- 中尉 你认为怎样？ - 你好吗 里德？
- What do you say, L.T.? - How you doing, Red?

358
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:34,678
不好 他拿了所有的好牌
Not good. This cocksucker has every card in the deck.

359
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:36,178
呼鲁
Full house.

360
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:38,078
你还不错
You're doing all right.

361
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:40,888
对 我还没开始作弊呢
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

362
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:45,958
- 中尉 要喝酒吗？ - 谢谢
- Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage? - Oh, thanks, Andy.

363
00:34:47,558 --> 00:34:48,548
中尉 你想玩吗？
Play, lieutenant?

364
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:52,698
不 我不想被你们强奸
No. Wouldn't want to get raped by you guys.

365
00:34:53,038 --> 00:34:55,868
为什么？你留着为了谁？
Why's that, lieutenant? What are you saving up to be?

366
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,098
犹太人？
Jewish?

367
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:04,238
我要走了
I gotta run.

368
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:08,308
稍后再见 你们玩得高兴点
I'll catch you men later. Enjoy yourselves tonight.

369
00:35:14,658 --> 00:35:17,628
他真是一个混蛋
That is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

370
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:23,418
你认为呢？鲍布？ 他能挨过这场仗吗？
What do you say there, Bob? A guy like that make it? Yes or no?

371
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,658
我也是那样想
I have to say that's precisely what I saw.

372
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:32,338
我只用看一看他就知道了
Sometimes I just look at a guy, and I know he's not going to make it.

373
00:35:32,908 --> 00:35:34,428
他一定不行
Just no fucking way.

374
00:36:38,978 --> 00:36:41,838
1968年 元旦

00:42:38,828 --> 00:42:40,588
可恶
Goddamn it.

404
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:48,528
刚才发生爆炸 两个士兵被炸伤
We got two men down, sir. There was an explosion.

405
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:51,028
我们需要增援
This... We need help, sir. ASAP.

406
00:42:51,378 --> 00:42:54,668
立即离开这里 一轮搏斗你们就完蛋
Move your ass out of here! One round to get you all!

407
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:56,998
罗德里 乔利亚 快点
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

408
00:42:57,348 --> 00:42:58,318
中尉
Lieutenant.

409
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:02,008
告诉总部我们需要工程师 这里到处是陷阱
Tell 6 we need engineers. This pos is full of traps.

410
00:43:02,388 --> 00:43:03,278
他们快来了
They're coming.

411
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:06,488
下面的村庄有北越军的踪影
NVA were seen at a village half a klick down the river.

412
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,518
六队说我们要立即赶去
Now, 6 says to get there ASAP.

413
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:12,018
留下四个手下和军医
Also, leave four of your men here and a medic.

414
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:13,488
- 好 - 快点
- All right. - Move it out.

415
00:43:37,288 --> 00:43:39,948
召集所有士兵 快点!
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

416
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:43,548
曼尼在哪里？
Hey, where's Manny?

417
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,098
曼尼 你在哪里？
Manny, where you at?

418
00:44:21,498 --> 00:44:23,398
我们要在入黑前到达村庄
We had to reach the village before dark,

419
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:27,438
伊利亚等人继续找寻 和等候工程师
We left Elias and some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers,

420
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,228
但最后金找到他
But it was King who found him...

421
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:33,008
他在下游一千码那里
...about 1000 yards downriver, not far from the village,

422
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:39,608
谜团被解开了
It was the end of the mystery,

423
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:13,538
混蛋
The motherfuckers.

424
00:45:21,558 --> 00:45:26,388
那个千年村的村民不知道我们会来
The village, which was maybe 1000 years old, didn't know we were coming,

425
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:28,598
否则他们早就逃走
If they had, they would have run,

426
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:34,098
巴恩是众矢之的 阿合上尉会经过他
Barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him, our Captain Ahab...

427
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:36,128
改善事情
...who would set things right again,

428
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:38,628
那一天我们都很敬爱他
That day, we loved him,

429
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:45,568
他在那里
There he goes, sarge.

430
00:45:51,758 --> 00:45:54,918
- 把他捡起来 - 好
- Pick him up. - Yeah, you got it, sarge.

431
00:45:56,058 --> 00:45:57,118
快来
Let's go.

432
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:02,168
不要那样望着我
Get that stupid look off your face!

433
00:46:03,998 --> 00:46:05,988
奥尼尔 清除房子
O'Neill, clear out these hooches.

434
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:08,668
小猪…
Hey, piggy- piggy. Hey, pig.

435
00:46:14,008 --> 00:46:16,308
宾尼 你要烧掉房子
Bunny, you've got to bring the hooches down.

436
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:20,808
去右边 小心 出发!
Spread out on the right. Watch your back. Let's go!

437
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:23,938
这里有什么？
What do you got here, huh?

438
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:28,688
去那边 快!
Get over there! Move it!

439
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:30,488
来吧 快点!
Come on, let's go!

440
00:46:31,628 --> 00:46:33,688
乔利亚 集合他们
Let's go, Junior, bring them in.

441
00:46:40,338 --> 00:46:42,828
出来 混球! 行动!
Get out of there, you fuckheads! Move!

442
00:46:58,618 --> 00:46:59,678
来吧
Come on!

443
00:47:02,688 --> 00:47:05,058
- 把他们赶进猪栏去 - 过来
- Put them in the pigpen! - Get over here.

444
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,628
回去! 住口!
Get back! Shut up!

445
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:10,658
给我手榴弹
Give me your willie pete.

446
00:47:14,538 --> 00:47:15,728
退后
Get back!

447
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,068
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

448
00:47:29,118 --> 00:47:30,248
住口
Shut up!

449
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:34,418
赶他们出来
Get them out of here!

450
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:36,858
妈的! 这里有一个
Oh, fuck! We got one.

451
00:47:41,198 --> 00:47:42,718
赶他出来
Get the fuck out of the hole!

452
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,468
出来 混蛋
Get out of there. Come on, motherfucker!

453
00:47:45,768 --> 00:47:47,928
冷静下来 他们很害怕
Be cool! Be cool! They're scared, man!

454
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,898
他们害怕？我又怎样？
Oh, they're scared, huh? What about me, man?

455
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:54,868
我厌倦这样 快出来 混球 快!
I'm sick of this fucking shit! Come on, motherfucker, move!

456
00:47:55,578 --> 00:47:56,938
看看这混球
Watch this fucker!

457
00:47:57,278 --> 00:47:59,838
他们认为我们为谁而战？
Who the fuck do they think we're fighting for?

458
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:02,448
- 还有一个 - 你…
- You got one more! - Hey, hey!

459
00:48:08,528 --> 00:48:10,318
有什么发现？
Well, what have we here?

460
00:48:12,758 --> 00:48:17,828
我们有一 二 三 四支机关枪 捷克制米克58机关枪
They have one, two, three, four Mag 58 Czechoslovakian machine guns.

461
00:48:18,168 --> 00:48:19,928
他们有二、四…
They got two, four....

462
00:48:21,238 --> 00:48:25,608
他们有足够米粮供应一队军队
Barnes, they got enough rice here to feed a whole fucking regiment.

463
00:48:28,078 --> 00:48:31,238
华伦 带村长来
Sergeant Warren, you bring the honcho over here.

464
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:34,518
特斯 出来 乔利亚 烧掉房子
Tubbs, get out of there! Junior, burn it!

465
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:37,978
怎么了？我不会伤害你
What the fuck's the matter? I wasn't gonna hurt you!

466
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:39,908
我看来想伤害你吗？
Look like I was gonna hurt you?

467
00:48:40,288 --> 00:48:44,348
你为什么不听我说？你他妈的为什么不听我说？
Why didn't you listen to me?! Why didn't you fucking listen to me?!

468
00:48:44,428 --> 00:48:47,118
你这个笨蛋! 你这个王八!
Fucking stupid?! You stupid asshole!

469
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:50,258
他妈的过来! 到这里! 混球!
Get the fuck up here! Come here, motherfucker!

470
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:54,298
你在笑什么？ 你为什么不听我说？
What are you smiling at?! Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?!

471
00:48:54,608 --> 00:48:55,588
杀死他们
Do them, man!

472
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:59,608
你在笑什么？ 想有点可笑的东西？
What are you smiling at?! You want something to smile at, huh?!

473
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:02,408
- 想有点可笑的东西？ - 对
- You want something to smile at?! - That's right!

474
00:49:02,748 --> 00:49:04,238
- 混蛋 跳舞吧 - 对
- Dance, motherfucker! - Yeah!

475
00:49:08,388 --> 00:49:09,608
跛子 跳舞吧
Dance, one-legger!

476
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,148
跳舞…
Dance! Dance!

477
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:16,648
跳舞 跛子
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

478
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:26,168
来吧
Come on. Come on, let's go, man.

479
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:34,598
他妈的! 他在嘲笑你
Fucking pussy, man! He's laughing at you!

480
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:37,408
越南人是那样笑的
That's the way the gook laughs.

481
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:39,278
当然了
Yeah, sure you are!

482
00:49:39,618 --> 00:49:41,578
你很后悔吧？
You're real sorry, ain't you?

483
00:49:41,918 --> 00:49:45,948
你为曼尼他们的死感到内疚吧？
You're just crying your little hearts out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

484
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:49,018
宾尼 算了吧？我们走!
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

485
00:49:49,888 --> 00:49:50,918
你说呢？
What do you say?

486
00:50:11,878 --> 00:50:15,478
妈的! 你看到他的头颅是怎样爆开的吗？
Holy shit! You see that fucking head come apart, man?

487
00:50:16,718 --> 00:50:19,308
我从来没见过那样的脑袋
I never seen brains like that before, man.

488
00:50:22,858 --> 00:50:25,828
我打赌一定是她指挥一切的
I bet you the old bitch runs the whole fucking show.

489
00:50:26,158 --> 00:50:30,358
大概是她割开曼尼的喉咙 她一定也想把我的睾丸割掉
She probably cut Manny's throat. Probably cut my balls off if she could.

490
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:32,828
宾尼 离开吧 没有人看到什么
Bunny, we leave now, nobody saw a thing!

491
00:50:33,138 --> 00:50:34,658
泰勒 你明白吗？
You understand, Taylor?

492
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:39,328
杀死她吧 杀死整条村的人
Come on, let's fucking do her! Let's do the whole fucking village!

493
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,508
这个越南人头目脸上有些疤痕
There's scars on this gook honcho, sarge.

494
00:50:45,478 --> 00:50:47,008
特斯 出来
Get out of here, Tubbs.

495
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,448
他从哪里弄到伤痕？
Where did he get these wounds?

496
00:51:03,298 --> 00:51:06,568
- 他说他在轰炸中受伤 - 他一定是北越的人
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid. - He's a dink for sure.

497
00:51:09,168 --> 00:51:11,328
问他这里为什么会有武器
Ask him why these weapons are here.

498
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:18,578
他们没有选择 北越杀了抗命的老头目
They had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.

499
00:51:18,918 --> 00:51:22,478
- 他说那些米是属于他们 - 莱纳 胡说
- He says all the rice is theirs. - Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

500
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:25,808
我们在河边杀死的越军是谁？
Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?

501
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:36,328
他不知道 北越军几个月没来过
He doesn't know. The NVA ain't been here in a couple of months.

502
00:51:36,668 --> 00:51:39,568
- 或许他是哨兵 - 当然了
- Maybe he was a scout. - Yeah, sure. A scout.

503
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:42,998
那些米和武器是给谁的？
What about the rice and the weapons?! Who they for?!

504
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:45,458
北越军
An NVC!

505
00:51:45,808 --> 00:51:48,438
他知道我在说什么吧？
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying. Don't you?

506
00:51:48,778 --> 00:51:50,908
他一定知道
Goddamn right he does.

507
00:51:51,248 --> 00:51:52,148
他在说谎
He's lying!

508
00:51:52,478 --> 00:51:55,178
杀死他 看谁会说真话
Waste the fucker! Then see who talks.

509
00:51:55,588 --> 00:51:57,748
他说他什么都不知道
Look, he says he doesn't know anything.

510
00:52:03,428 --> 00:52:06,688
他讨厌北越 但他们擅自来这里
He hates the NVA, but they come when they want and take over.

511
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:08,288
她在说什么？
What's the bitch saying?

512
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,628
她问我们为什么要杀死猪
She's going on about why we killed the pigs...

513
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:14,628
他们是农夫 要养活自己
...they're farmers, they have to make a living....

514
00:52:23,748 --> 00:52:24,838
住口
Shut up!

515
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:27,178
叫她住口
Shut her the fuck up!

516
00:52:52,438 --> 00:52:56,038
你叫他快点说 否则我会杀死更多人
You tell him to start talking or I'll waste more of them.

517
00:52:56,848 --> 00:52:58,178
莱纳 告诉他
Tell him, Lerner!

518
00:53:04,588 --> 00:53:06,648
让我们大开杀戒
Let us in on this, all right?

519
00:53:12,228 --> 00:53:14,958
我们杀死整条村吧
Let's go for it! Let's do the whole fucking village!

520
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:18,288
中士 我们还在等什么？
Come on, sarge. What the fuck are we waiting for?

521
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:23,828
- 杀死他们 - 走开
- Let's do them! - Out of my way!

522
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:29,478
这是他的女儿吧？
This is his daughter, right? Right?

523
00:53:38,158 --> 00:53:41,678
你说谎! 不 你说谎! 你这个越共!
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

524
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:51,558
巴恩
Barnes!

525
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:02,268
你他妈的在做什么？
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

526
00:54:06,478 --> 00:54:08,578
别管闲事 这和你无关
Stay out of this. It ain't your show.

527
00:54:09,818 --> 00:54:12,948
你不是火枪队 猪哥!
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

528
00:54:13,388 --> 00:54:16,018
- 打倒他 - 巴恩 加油
- Get him! - Come on, Barnes!

529
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:20,518
打倒他! … 打烂他的头!
Get him! Get him! Tear his fucking head off!

530
00:54:27,368 --> 00:54:29,998
伊利亚 杀死他
Come on, Elias. Send him to hell!

531
00:54:31,738 --> 00:54:34,298
妈的! 别这样! 停手!
Goddamn it! Come on, break it up!

532
00:54:38,118 --> 00:54:39,168
停手
Break it up!

533
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,108
停手
Break it up!

534
00:54:45,888 --> 00:54:46,688
伊利亚 冷静点
Elias, chill.

535
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:50,958
伊利亚 你死定了 我发誓 你死定了
You're dead, Elias! I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

536
00:54:51,328 --> 00:54:54,348
你会坐牢的
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

537
00:54:54,698 --> 00:54:56,498
这件事不会就此罢休的 混蛋
This shit won't wash, you puke!

538
00:54:56,828 --> 00:54:59,998
停手! …住口!
Break it up! Break it up! Shut up!

539
00:55:00,638 --> 00:55:02,998
停手 留心听着
Break it up! Listen up!

540
00:55:03,738 --> 00:55:06,068
上尉说烧掉这里 听到了吗？
Captain says to torch this place, hear that?

541
00:55:06,408 --> 00:55:07,708
烧掉这里
Torch this place!

542
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,338
烧掉武器
Blow the weapons in place!

543
00:55:09,948 --> 00:55:13,678
集合他们 我们时间不多
Round up suspected VC and shake it up! We ain't got much light left!

544
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:17,108
中尉 你为什么不作出行动？
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?

545
00:55:17,488 --> 00:55:19,008
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

546
00:55:19,388 --> 00:55:21,758
你知道我在说什么
You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

547
00:55:22,128 --> 00:55:26,318
不 我不知道 我不知道你他妈的在说什么
No, I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.

548
00:55:31,198 --> 00:55:33,728
快点出发! 快! 听到命令了吧!
Move it out! Let's go! You heard the lieutenant!

549
00:55:34,038 --> 00:55:38,268
泰勒 走了 妈的! 烧掉武器 然后离开
Taylor, let's go, for chrissake! Police up the weapons and let's go!

550
00:55:38,608 --> 00:55:39,798
哈洛 来吧
Come on, Harold.

551
00:56:15,648 --> 00:56:17,238
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

552
00:56:27,388 --> 00:56:29,188
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

553
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,498
来吧
Hey, come on.

554
00:57:16,568 --> 00:57:18,128
妈的! 滚开
You fucker! Get out of here!

555
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:22,138
滚开! …不要那样做
Get the fuck off! Don't do it! Don't do it!

556
00:57:22,478 --> 00:57:25,568
混蛋 这是什么一回事？
You fucker! What is this, huh?!

557
00:57:30,148 --> 00:57:31,138
你是同志吗？
You a homosexual?

558
00:57:31,518 --> 00:57:33,918
你怎么了？她是越南人
What's your problem? She's a fucking dink.

559
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:37,918
她是人类! 去你的!
She's a fucking human being, man! Fuck you!

560
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:40,288
泰勒 你这个可恶的新兵
Total fucking cherry, Taylor!

561
00:57:40,628 --> 00:57:44,088
妈的禽兽! 你们全部都是禽兽!
Fucking animal! All of you! You're fucking animals!

562
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:46,268
混蛋
Fucking lame fuck!

563
00:57:46,568 --> 00:57:49,198
你不属于越南 这里不适合你
You don't belong in the Nam. This ain't your place.

564
00:57:49,538 --> 00:57:51,728
你们一点都不明白吧？
You don't fucking get it, do you?

565
00:57:53,038 --> 00:57:54,938
你们不明白
You just don't fucking get it.

566
00:57:56,148 --> 00:57:57,338
没事的
It's okay.

567
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:03,078
离开吧
Get out of there!

568
00:58:07,288 --> 00:58:09,278
出发吧
Police up your dicks and let's go.

569
00:59:06,578 --> 00:59:08,408
- 我什么都看不见 - 我看到
- I didn't see anything, sir. - I did.

570
00:59:08,748 --> 00:59:11,218
巴恩中士说那个是北越兵
Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.

571
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:15,178
我的报告中 沃夫上尉是目击证人
My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

572
00:59:15,558 --> 00:59:16,958
伊利亚 好
All right, Elias.

573
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,258
- 巴恩中士 - 是
- Staff Sergeant Barnes. - Sir!

574
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,588
我们回到总部后 我要详细报告
I want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

575
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:27,958
你有日志 我有很多目击证人
You got a diary. I have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

576
00:59:28,268 --> 00:59:30,538
不是现在
Not now, goddamn it! Not now!

577
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:32,868
我们回到总部才调查这件事
We'll get into this at the base camp.

578
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:37,478
我保证如果发现非法杀戮…
I can promise you, if I find out there was an illegal killing...

579
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:39,478
一定会有军事法庭
...there will be a court-martial.

580
00:59:39,848 --> 00:59:44,948
现在我要全军作战 你们别再吵
Right now, I need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

581
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:48,348
巴恩和伊利亚中士 听到吗？
Staff Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Elias. You hear me?

582
00:59:48,728 --> 00:59:49,588
- 是 - 知道
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

583
00:59:49,928 --> 00:59:54,088
明天你们从东面再去那越共地堡
We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

584
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:59,028
你们休息一下 晚上七点钟回来开会
You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 19:00 for a briefing.

585
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:00,558
- 是 - 是
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

586
01:00:05,678 --> 01:00:10,408
你认为他们会在乎我们吗？
Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

587
01:00:10,908 --> 01:00:13,778
哈洛 也许会是你阻碍了巴恩
It could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

588
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,148
那个宾尼呢？
And that Bunny?

589
01:00:16,818 --> 01:00:18,688
他是疯的
That motherfucker's crazy.

590
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:20,448
他令我不寒而栗
I mean, he scares me.

591
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,788
他很可怕
He just scares me.

592
01:00:23,628 --> 01:00:26,188
你已经受牵连
You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

593
01:00:26,858 --> 01:00:29,348
这些越南人比你想像中聪明
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.

594
01:00:29,698 --> 01:00:31,628
巴恩知道他在做什么
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

595
01:00:31,968 --> 01:00:34,728
他们是北越兵
They was NVA, every last of them.

596
01:00:35,668 --> 01:00:38,438
他带领我们走到这里了 他会带领我们走完这场战争
He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.

597
01:00:38,778 --> 01:00:39,708
我不知道
I don't know, Holmes.

598
01:00:40,608 --> 01:00:43,938
基督教徒不会到处杀人
A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

599
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:48,048
情况失去控制了 完全失控了
This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

600
01:00:48,518 --> 01:00:51,318
看来你不知道怎样分别…
Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

601
01:00:51,688 --> 01:00:53,988
事情的轻重
...the way you always shoot up that shit.

602
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:56,458
我不知道…
I don't know, brothers...

603
01:00:58,328 --> 01:01:00,518
但我内心大受伤害
...but I'm hurting real bad inside.

604
01:01:03,228 --> 01:01:06,328
别担心 伊利亚不能证明什么
Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

605
01:01:06,638 --> 01:01:07,598
他是个麻烦制造者
He's a troublemaker.

606
01:01:07,938 --> 01:01:11,498
伊利亚像华盛顿的政客…
Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

607
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:15,468
想独力打这场仗
...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

608
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:18,808
这里没有时间进行审讯
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

609
01:01:20,518 --> 01:01:23,078
- 中士 - 谢谢你
- Sarge. - Thanks, Bun.

610
01:01:24,218 --> 01:01:25,518
情况怎样？
How did it go there, Bob?

611
01:01:28,388 --> 01:01:31,878
那个可恶的伊利亚
Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

612
01:01:32,228 --> 01:01:34,198
他是个卑鄙小人
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

613
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:37,358
他会连累这个连的所有人
He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

614
01:01:37,768 --> 01:01:39,928
有人要教训他
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

615
01:01:40,338 --> 01:01:43,768
你认为呢？ 会有调查吗？
So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

616
01:01:45,438 --> 01:01:46,308
鲍布？
Bob?

617
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:51,608
你太担心了 中士会解决他
O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

618
01:01:58,118 --> 01:01:59,488
今晚天色很美
It's a beautiful night.

619
01:01:59,858 --> 01:02:02,758
我喜欢这里的夜晚
Yeah, I love this place at night.

620
01:02:03,188 --> 01:02:04,558
繁星…
The stars....

621
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:11,268
它们没有对与错 它们就是在那里
There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

622
01:02:12,198 --> 01:02:14,068
你的比喻很好
That's a nice way of putting it.

623
01:02:19,138 --> 01:02:20,728
巴恩憎恨你吧？
Barnes has it in for you, huh?

624
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,938
巴恩相信他所做的一切
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

625
01:02:25,418 --> 01:02:27,748
你呢？你相信吗？
And you? Do you believe?

626
01:02:31,088 --> 01:02:33,608
1965年时吗？我会相信
ln '65? Yeah.

627
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:36,718
现在呢？
Now?

628
01:02:39,528 --> 01:02:40,518
不相信
No.

629
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,598
今天所发生的事只是开始
What happened today is just the beginning.

630
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:49,928
我们会输掉这场仗
We're gonna lose this war.

631
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:52,238
不会吧
Come on.

632
01:02:52,578 --> 01:02:55,138
你真的认为我们会输？
You really think so? Us?

633
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:58,808
我们欺负别人太久了
We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...

634
01:02:59,148 --> 01:03:01,378
现在轮到我们被打击
...I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

635
01:03:12,128 --> 01:03:14,428
我每天都在挣扎
Day by day, I struggle to maintain...

636
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:17,318
我努力维持体力和意志
...not only my strength, but my sanity,

637
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:19,228
一切都很模糊
It's all a blur,

638
01:03:19,538 --> 01:03:21,438
我没有气力写信
I have no energy to write,

639
01:03:21,938 --> 01:03:24,338
我不能分辨对与错
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore,

640
01:03:24,938 --> 01:03:28,468
我们的士气低落 出现内讧
The morale of the men is low, A civil war in the platoon,

641
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:31,278
一半支持伊利亚 一半支持巴恩
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes,

642
01:03:32,218 --> 01:03:34,308
有很多猜忌和憎恨
There's a lot of suspicion and hate,

643
01:03:34,718 --> 01:03:38,378
我们竟然在自伤残杀
I can't believe we're fighting each other instead of them,

644
01:03:40,658 --> 01:03:45,118
数着日子和留意着周遭 没别的
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face, Not much else,

645
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:47,758
祖母 希望你一切安好
Hope things are well, Grandma,

646
01:03:48,098 --> 01:03:49,928
告诉妈妈和爸爸…
Tell Mom and Dad I...

647
01:03:50,398 --> 01:03:53,728
你知道告诉他们什么的 柯里斯上
Well, just tell them, Chris,

648
01:04:15,258 --> 01:04:19,658
我知道你以为会被派去洗衣服
Hey, big boy. I know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out.

649
01:04:20,028 --> 01:04:23,358
我要把自己涂白 才能得到那些工作
Hell, I gotta paint myself white just to get one of those jobs.

650
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:27,658
我递了申请去割包皮 我要离开
Got my request in for a circumcision. I'm getting my big ass out of here.

651
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:29,938
你会成为犹太教教士吗？
What are you gonna do, become a rabbi?

652
01:04:30,268 --> 01:04:31,258
水蛭
Leech.

653
01:04:35,978 --> 01:04:38,308
继续走
All right! Move it out!

654
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:44,508
不要喝 你会得痢疾
Don't drink that, asshole. You're gonna get malaria.

655
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,348
我希望会
Yeah, I hope so.

656
01:04:47,058 --> 01:04:48,518
去吧
Let's go.

657
01:05:26,258 --> 01:05:29,058
军医 莱纳被击中
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

658
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:36,898
中士 华伦被击中

It's an ambush! They were just waiting for us here!

661
01:05:45,478 --> 01:05:47,448

- Who's on point? - Lerner and Warren.

662
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:49,268
你去哪里？
Where are you going?!

663
01:05:53,188 --> 01:05:56,918
天啊! 混球! 派火力上前
Goddamn it, you assholes! Get some firepower up there!

664
01:05:57,258 --> 01:05:58,118
对
Right!

665
01:06:07,738 --> 01:06:09,398
小心 火箭炮
Watch out! Rockets!

666
01:06:17,778 --> 01:06:19,438
莱纳在哪里？
Where the fuck is Lerner?

667
01:06:19,778 --> 01:06:22,308
他在木头那边
He's over there! By the log!

668
01:06:45,638 --> 01:06:49,668

- We'll shoot each other. - Sounds far- out to me.

他们会从那里过来
They'll be coming from over there.

722
01:11:31,858 --> 01:11:35,188
只要被他们攻破 我们便死定了
Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.

723
01:11:35,728 --> 01:11:37,218
你去哪里？
Where the hell are you going?

724
01:11:37,898 --> 01:11:40,988
到下游大约一百米处…
Down by the river about 100 meters...

725
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:42,788
以防他们准备从外围进攻
...in case they try to flank us.

726
01:11:43,138 --> 01:11:45,728
第三连正在后面赶来
3rd Platoon is coming behind us. Watch for them.

727
01:11:46,278 --> 01:11:47,768
我可以和你一起去吗？
Hey. Can I go with you?

728
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:51,608
不 我单独行事较敏捷
No. I move faster alone.

729
01:12:00,518 --> 01:12:02,618
让炮兵队来处理
Let's let arty do a bit of the work.

732
01:12:09,968 --> 01:12:12,898

What about Elias? If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

733
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:16,138
中尉 你也快去
You just haul ass too, lieutenant.

Kiss my ass. Man, I never thought I'd get hit.

741
01:13:14,798 --> 01:13:17,928
你击中两个混蛋
A lung, babe. You got two of them fuckers.

伊利亚死了
Elias is dead.

754

01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:05,788
对 他在一百米外

765
01:19:29,308 --> 01:19:30,138
什么？

766
01:19:37,378 --> 01:19:39,038
退后…

我知道是他 我看到他的眼神
I know he did. I saw his eyes when he came in.

771
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:24,218
你怎知不是越兵？你没有证据
How do you know the dinks didn't get him? You got no proof.

772
01:21:24,558 --> 01:21:26,858
证据就在他的眼神 我看得出
Proof's in the eyes. When you know, you know.

773
01:21:27,188 --> 01:21:29,248
你也看见 我知道你在想什么
You saw. I know what you were thinking.

774
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:31,118
我们今天解决他
I say we frag him tonight.

775
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:33,428
我赞成 以牙还牙
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

776
01:21:34,428 --> 01:21:37,528
让军事法庭处理吧
I say let military justice do the job on him.

777
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:41,398
去他的军事法庭! 你在说笑吗？
Come on, fuck the military justice! Are you joking me?

778
01:21:41,738 --> 01:21:45,728
他们会相信谁？奥尼尔？宾尼？ 全是胡说!
Whose story you think they'll believe? O'NeilI's? Bunny's? Bullshit!

779
01:21:46,078 --> 01:21:50,138
巴恩不会放过你的
You try that, Barnes will shove it back up your ass, with a candle on it.

780
01:21:50,478 --> 01:21:52,138
你认为我们应怎做？
What do you suggest we do?

781
01:21:52,488 --> 01:21:57,478
你们小心 巴恩会一个个地解决他们
Watch your own asses. Barnes will be coming down on all of them.

782
01:21:57,818 --> 01:22:00,988
你们忘记和伊利亚的美好日子吗？
You gonna forget about Elias? All the good times we had here?

783
01:22:01,328 --> 01:22:04,888
你想把头砍下来治头痛？
Shit, you trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.

784
01:22:05,668 --> 01:22:08,568
伊利亚没有叫你为他打仗
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him.

785
01:22:09,498 --> 01:22:13,058
如果真的有天堂 天啊 我希望真的有
And if there's a heaven, and God, I hope there is...

786
01:22:13,408 --> 01:22:18,068
他会在上面喝到大醉
...he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit...

787
01:22:19,108 --> 01:22:21,048
因为他把痛苦留在这里
...because he left his pains down here.

788
01:22:21,378 --> 01:22:24,608
你错了 总之巴恩是杀人凶手
You're wrong! Anyway you cut it, Barnes is a murderer!

789
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:26,888
- 对 - 泰勒…
- Right on. - Taylor...

790
01:22:28,018 --> 01:22:32,418
你当初入伍时说很欣赏巴恩
...when you first came in here, you told me how you admired the bastard.

791
01:22:32,758 --> 01:22:36,958
- 我错了 - 你做任何事都是错的
- I was wrong. - You've never been right about nothing!

792
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:40,458
你们这班混蛋 留心听着
Dig this, you assholes, and dig it good.

793
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:44,698
巴恩中枪七次都没有死去
Barnes been shot seven times, and he ain't dead.

794
01:22:45,038 --> 01:22:46,898
那对你有意思吗？
Does that mean anything to you?

795
01:22:47,868 --> 01:22:49,638
巴恩是不会死的
Barnes ain't meant to die.

796
01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:54,448
唯一能杀死他的是他自己
The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.

797
01:22:55,248 --> 01:22:56,878
你们在谈死亡吗？
Talking about killing?

798
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:11,058
你们是专家吗？
You all experts?

799
01:23:13,528 --> 01:23:15,228
你们都知道杀戮吗？
You all know about killing?

800
01:23:16,698 --> 01:23:19,138
我想听听 猪头
Well, I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

801
01:23:26,508 --> 01:23:29,498
你们抽这个来逃避现实？
You smoke this shit to escape from reality?

802
01:23:32,448 --> 01:23:34,278
我不需要这个
Me, I don't need this shit.

803
01:23:40,988 --> 01:23:42,718
我就是现实
I am reality.

804
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:52,728
现实应该是这样 而现实就是这样
There's the way it ought to be, and there's the way it is.

805
01:23:56,978 --> 01:23:58,528
伊利亚满口一派胡言
Elias was full of shit.

806
01:24:00,648 --> 01:24:02,438
伊利亚是个斗士
Elias was a crusader.

807
01:24:04,118 --> 01:24:08,048
我不会跟听从命令的人作对
Now, I got no fight with any man who does what he's told.

808
01:24:08,648 --> 01:24:10,048
但当他不听命时…
But when he don't...

809
01:24:10,388 --> 01:24:12,118
运作便会崩溃
...the machine breaks down.

810
01:24:13,088 --> 01:24:17,258
运作崩溃时 我们就会崩溃
And when the machine breaks down, we break down.

811
01:24:18,498 --> 01:24:20,428
我不会许容那样的事
I ain't going to allow that.

812
01:24:21,128 --> 01:24:22,398
你们任何一个都不能
From any of you.

813
01:24:23,898 --> 01:24:25,098
一个都不可以
Not one.

814
01:24:41,918 --> 01:24:43,678
你们都爱伊利亚
You all love Elias.

815
01:24:49,128 --> 01:24:51,188
你们想为他报仇
You want to kick ass.

816
01:24:57,138 --> 01:25:00,438
我独个儿在这里
Well, here I am. All by my lonesome.

817
01:25:03,378 --> 01:25:05,368
没有人会知道
And ain't nobody gonna know.

818
01:25:11,618 --> 01:25:13,548
你们六个对我一个
Six of you boys against me.

819
01:25:20,058 --> 01:25:21,148
杀我吧
Kill me.

820
01:25:39,278 --> 01:25:41,208
我卑视你们
I shit on all of you.

821
01:25:44,048 --> 01:25:46,018
混蛋
You motherfucker!

822
01:25:52,258 --> 01:25:53,448
打吧
Come on, man.

823
01:25:54,488 --> 01:25:55,688
柯里斯 打他
Get him, Chris.

824
01:26:00,128 --> 01:26:02,358
巴恩 不要下手
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man!

825
01:26:02,738 --> 01:26:04,928
你要坐牢的
You'll go dinky dau in LBJ, man.

826
01:26:05,298 --> 01:26:08,238
杀军人要坐十年牢 十年
Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years.

827
01:26:08,568 --> 01:26:10,298
你想想吧
Climb the fucking walls, man.

828
01:26:12,908 --> 01:26:14,378
不要下手
Don't do it.

829
01:26:32,828 --> 01:26:33,888
死亡？
Death?

830
01:26:35,028 --> 01:26:37,028
你们对死亡有什么认识？
What do you all know about death?

831
01:26:52,118 --> 01:26:54,588
我们翌日被派回到山谷里
They sent us baCk into the valley the next day...

832
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:58,648
进入离柬埔寨约二千米的战区
...about 2000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter,

833
01:26:58,988 --> 01:27:01,818
我们好像回到案发现场
It felt like we were returning to the sCene of a Crime,

834
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:39,948
A连在前一天被重击
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable forCe,

835
01:27:40,298 --> 01:27:42,558
C连在那一天被袭击
Charlie Company had been probed that night,

836
01:27:43,268 --> 01:27:45,898
山谷里有其他战事…
There were other battalions in the valley...

837
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:49,108
但我们是引他们出来的饵
...but we knew we were the bait to lure them out,

838
01:27:49,438 --> 01:27:53,998
141北越军就在下面某处
Somewhere out there was the entire 141st NVA regiment,

839
01:28:11,628 --> 01:28:15,928
他们昨晚想袭击C连
Caught them trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.

840
01:28:16,298 --> 01:28:18,268
他们发现地图
They found maps on them, man.

841
01:28:18,968 --> 01:28:23,308
听说每个散兵坑都有地雷
Got a friend at Battalion, says they had every foxhole here fixed on.

842
01:28:23,608 --> 01:28:28,048
知道我方的距离、林木线和地雷
Distances, tree lines, our claymores, everything.

843
01:28:28,378 --> 01:28:29,938
情况不妙
This is bad, man.

844
01:28:31,018 --> 01:28:34,708
- 我有不祥之兆 - 听说我们身在柬埔寨
- I got bad vibes here. - I also heard we're in Cambodia now.

845
01:28:35,048 --> 01:28:37,608
柬埔寨？你在开玩笑
Cambodia? Man, you're kidding me.

846
01:28:38,418 --> 01:28:40,088
你想见我？
You wanted to see me, sir?

847
01:28:41,888 --> 01:28:45,058
拉姆治 伊利亚小组归你
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

848
01:28:45,398 --> 01:28:49,268
小组？我不知道我的连叫小组
Squad? I didn't know we were still referring to this platoon as squads.

849
01:28:49,638 --> 01:28:53,938
我要你去那两个坑
I want you to take those two holes, right there and there.

850
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:57,038
跟在上面的巴恩 和在下面的金联络
Tie it off with Barnes up here and King down there.

851
01:28:58,678 --> 01:29:00,368
长官 对不起…
Begging your pardon, sir...

852
01:29:00,908 --> 01:29:04,348
那两个坑距离太远 一个连队可以从中通过
...my two holes are so far apart, a regiment could run between them.

853
01:29:04,678 --> 01:29:06,238
我只有五个军人活着
I have five live bodies left.

854
01:29:06,588 --> 01:29:10,108
我不想听你的问题 新兵很快到
I don't want to hear your problems. You'll get new men any day.

855
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:12,078
你要和别人一样作战
Make do like everybody else.

856
01:29:12,488 --> 01:29:14,858
- 我没有要求这个 - 我不想再听
- I didn't ask for this. - I don't want to hear it.

857
01:29:15,188 --> 01:29:17,388
- 你不想再听？ - 对
- You don't want to hear it? - That's right.

858
01:29:18,098 --> 01:29:21,028
因为老实说我毫不在乎
Because, to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.

859
01:29:21,868 --> 01:29:24,058
我不再在乎
I just don't give a flying fuck anymore.

860
01:29:31,838 --> 01:29:33,678
我很高兴我不用和他们一起去
I'm glad I ain't going with them.

861
01:29:36,078 --> 01:29:39,048
外面有一头饥饿的野兽
Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.

862
01:29:40,218 --> 01:29:41,518
真失败
What a fucking bummer.

863
01:29:42,888 --> 01:29:46,088
只剩十天了 我仍要面对这一切
Ten days and a wake- up, and I'm still dealing with this shit.

864
01:29:49,658 --> 01:29:51,248
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

865
01:29:52,228 --> 01:29:53,788
你为什么不写信？
Why ain't you writing nobody?

866
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:56,088
你的父母呢？
What about your folks?

867
01:29:57,438 --> 01:29:58,988
你向我提起的祖母怎样？
That grandma you told me about?

868
01:30:01,638 --> 01:30:02,568
女朋友？
Girl?

869
01:30:05,638 --> 01:30:06,938
你有父母吧？
You got parents, don't you?

870
01:30:07,578 --> 01:30:09,098
一定有些亲密的人
There must be somebody.

871
01:30:10,318 --> 01:30:12,048
没有
No, there's nobody.

872
01:30:13,788 --> 01:30:16,118
你抽太多了
You been smoking too much of this shit.

873
01:30:18,518 --> 01:30:20,988
你要控制一下 令人颓丧
Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

874
01:30:22,028 --> 01:30:25,898
我记得你初来时什么都不懂
I remember when you first come out here to the bush, you's green as...

875
01:30:27,028 --> 01:30:30,518
你可曾被无法 摆脱的错误缠绕着？
You ever get caught in a mistake you just can't get out of?

876
01:30:31,598 --> 01:30:33,468
总有方法解决的
There's a way out of anything.

877
01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:37,208
只要你振作精神
Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry...

878
01:30:37,578 --> 01:30:39,438
一定有方法的
...and the worm will turn.

879
01:30:42,448 --> 01:30:43,938
你还有多少天？
How many days you short?

880
01:30:45,248 --> 01:30:48,778
不只是我 而是整个事情
It's not just me. It's how the whole thing works.

881
01:30:49,118 --> 01:30:50,748
像伊利亚般的人要牺牲
People like Elias get wasted.

882
01:30:51,088 --> 01:30:54,788
巴恩那种人却能继续为所欲为
People like Barnes go on making up all the rules any way they want.

883
01:30:55,128 --> 01:30:58,818
我们只能逆来顺受吗？
So, what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it.

884
01:30:59,768 --> 01:31:02,058
我们不用理会那些事情
We just don't add up to dry shit.

885
01:31:02,568 --> 01:31:07,158
谁说你需要的？ 你只需要活着离开这里
Whoever said we did? All you got to do is make it out of here...

886
01:31:07,508 --> 01:31:11,808
然后每天快乐地生活
...and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life. Gravy.

887
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:17,168
你是理想主义者
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

888
01:31:18,448 --> 01:31:21,438
收拾你的行装 你的命令刚下达
Collect up your shit. Your orders just come through.

889
01:31:21,788 --> 01:31:23,078
不要骗我
Man, don't fuck with me.

890
01:31:23,418 --> 01:31:26,018
你要邀请信吗？
Oh, what do you need, a written invitation?

891
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:30,918
天啊! 他们做错事
Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers done made a mistake!

892
01:31:31,258 --> 01:31:32,728
他们竟然饶我一命
They cut me some slack!

893
01:31:33,028 --> 01:31:36,728
你有十分钟时间赶去搭直升机
You got 10 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here.

894
01:31:37,098 --> 01:31:38,658
因为如果你不上机…
Because if you're not on it...

895
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:40,538
我便会去
...I'm gonna be.

896
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:43,638
泰勒 法兰西准备好了
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

897
01:31:44,308 --> 01:31:47,638
太好了 金 我为你感到高兴 回家吧!
That's great, King, I'm happy for you. Take it on home for me.

898
01:31:47,978 --> 01:31:51,178
你有我的地址 你知道怎么联络我
You got my address. You know where to reach me anytime.

899
01:31:51,678 --> 01:31:54,238
我要走了 我不想错过直升机
I gotta di di, Don't want to miss that chopper.

900
01:31:58,558 --> 01:32:00,888
- 你没事吧？ - 我没事
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.

901
01:32:01,758 --> 01:32:02,948
记住放松点
Remember, take it easy.

902
01:32:03,498 --> 01:32:05,898
不要想太多 别做傻瓜
Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool.

903
01:32:06,598 --> 01:32:09,858
记住这里没有人是懦夫
Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here.

904
01:32:10,668 --> 01:32:11,898
我的朋友
My man.

905
01:32:19,578 --> 01:32:21,048
我送你出去
I'll walk you out, man.

906
01:32:26,548 --> 01:32:27,538
金 保重
Take it easy, King.

907
01:32:27,888 --> 01:32:30,348
- 我会的 - 再见
- I'll take it any way I can get it. - I hear you. Later.

908
01:32:31,918 --> 01:32:34,518
很痛 中士 不要碰它
I'm pretty fucked up, sarge. Don't touch it!

909
01:32:35,158 --> 01:32:37,028
我一定要上直升机
I gotta get on the chopper, man.

910
01:32:37,398 --> 01:32:39,858
- 有什么问题？ - 他说不能走路
- So, what's the problem? - Says he can't walk.

911
01:32:40,728 --> 01:32:42,328
可恶
Shit.

912
01:32:43,538 --> 01:32:44,468
马丁…
Martin...

913
01:32:45,238 --> 01:32:46,598
穿上靴子
...get your boots on.

914
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:54,038
下次给我见到你喷防蚊水…
And the next time I catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your feet...

915
01:32:54,378 --> 01:32:56,778
我会送你上军事法庭
...I'll court- martial your nigger ass.

916
01:32:57,878 --> 01:32:59,868
送我去吧
Then court- martial me, motherfucker!

917
01:33:00,218 --> 01:33:03,148
逮捕我啊! 送我去坐牢吧
Bust my ass! Send me to fucking Long Binh!

918
01:33:03,558 --> 01:33:04,678
下手吧
Do your fucking worst!

919
01:33:05,518 --> 01:33:08,428
你们白人欺负我
You white folks got your last klick out of Junior!

920
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:11,828
奥尼尔 把蜈蚣拿来
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

921
01:33:12,668 --> 01:33:14,028
- 中士？ - 是
- Sarge? - Yeah.

922
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:19,068
我找到那毛茸茸、红黑色的虫
That long, hairy, red and black bastard I found in the ammo crate.

923
01:33:20,838 --> 01:33:22,808
我会把它放进他的伤口
I'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch.

924
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:24,068
我记得了
I remember now.

925
01:33:26,078 --> 01:33:27,408
等一下
Hold up, man!

926
01:33:27,748 --> 01:33:29,478
等一下好吗？
You just hold up and wait, okay?

927
01:33:29,818 --> 01:33:32,338
我会走路了
Fuck it, I'll walk! I'll fucking walk!

928
01:33:32,688 --> 01:33:35,278
我要和他同一个坑？
Fucking pussy! Sarge, I gotta have him in my hole?

929
01:33:35,618 --> 01:33:36,778
对
Yeah.

930
01:33:37,188 --> 01:33:39,748
我可以和你谈谈吗？
Bob, I'd like to speak to you a minute.

931
01:33:44,698 --> 01:33:46,188
我不能再忍受了
I can't take it no more.

932
01:33:50,268 --> 01:33:51,238
什么事？
Yeah, what is it?

933
01:33:51,598 --> 01:33:54,698
我有伊利亚的假期 有三天
Bob, I got Elias' R and R. It's coming up in three days.

934
01:33:55,038 --> 01:33:57,698
我想回去夏威夷见柏丝
I was thinking about going to Hawaii and see Patsy.

935
01:33:58,278 --> 01:34:00,368
我从没向你要求过任何事
I never asked you for a thing over here.

936
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:02,678
坦白说…
Well, to be honest with you...

937
01:34:03,018 --> 01:34:06,508
我想和金一起坐直升机回去 你觉得呢？
...I was hoping you'd put me on a chopper with King. What do you say?

938
01:34:07,148 --> 01:34:08,408
我不能让你那样做
I can't do that for you.

939
01:34:08,748 --> 01:34:11,378
你知道这里很需要人手
You know we need every swinging dick in the field.

940
01:34:11,718 --> 01:34:15,088
你可以跟我说 我只是请三天假
You can talk to me, for chrissake! I'm just asking for three days.

941
01:34:15,428 --> 01:34:17,948
我告诉你不可以
I am talking to you, Red. And I'm telling you no.

942
01:34:19,058 --> 01:34:20,828
回到散兵坑
Get back in your foxhole.

943
01:34:21,268 --> 01:34:24,858
我有不祥之兆 知道吗？
Bob, I've got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

944
01:34:25,468 --> 01:34:27,628
我今次有不祥之兆
I mean I've got a bad feeling.

945
01:34:28,408 --> 01:34:30,708
我觉得我不能活着离开这里
I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.

946
01:34:31,038 --> 01:34:32,908
你明白吗？
You understand what I'm saying?

947
01:34:34,108 --> 01:34:36,738
每个人都会死的
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

948
01:34:44,718 --> 01:34:45,448
可恶
Oh, shit!

949
01:34:59,508 --> 01:35:03,338
混蛋们 再见
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

950
01:35:15,618 --> 01:35:17,608
埋伏在哪里？
Where's that fucking ambush?

951
01:35:18,318 --> 01:35:22,618
他们不会等 他们现在就来了
They ain't even waiting till later. It's fucking coming now, man.

乔利亚 我们所做的一切
You know, Junior? Some of the things we done, man...

954
01:35:33,838 --> 01:35:36,068
我不觉得我们在做错事
...I don't feel like we done something wrong.

955
01:35:36,808 --> 01:35:38,398
但有时…
But sometimes, man...

956
01:35:40,478 --> 01:35:42,408
我有不祥的感觉

957
01:35:45,578 --> 01:35:47,778
我坦然对随军牧师说我喜欢这里
I told the padre the truth. I like it here.

958
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:50,878
你可以为所欲为 没有人理会你
You get to do what you want, nobody fucks with you.

959
01:35:51,288 --> 01:35:53,588
你只用担心死亡
The only worry you got is dying.

960
01:35:54,058 --> 01:35:56,288
反正死的时候你不会知道
And if that happens, you won't know about it...

961
01:35:56,628 --> 01:35:58,488
那么担心什么？
...so, what the fuck, man?

962
01:35:58,898 --> 01:36:02,298
我要和你同一个坑？
Shit. I got to be in this hole with you, man?

963
01:36:02,668 --> 01:36:04,528
我早知道我不应该来
I just know I shouldn't have come.

964
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:11,298
不用担心 你和爱迪墨菲在一起
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging with Audie Murphy here.

01:53:06,218 --> 01:53:07,888
- 准备好了吗？ - 好了
- Ready? - You bet.

1070
01:54:37,348 --> 01:54:39,608
现在回想一切…
I think now, looking back...

1071
01:54:41,088 --> 01:54:44,818
我们不是对抗敌人 而是自己
...we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves...

1072
01:54:45,158 --> 01:54:47,418
敌人就在我们心中
...and the enemy was in us,

1073
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,748
战争对我来说现在已经完结
The war is over for me now...

1074
01:54:52,098 --> 01:54:55,898
但它永远会存留在我的心中
...but it will always be there the rest of my days,

1075
01:54:56,428 --> 01:54:58,328
伊利亚会和巴恩…
As I'm sure Elias will be...

1076
01:54:58,838 --> 01:55:02,168
为了像罗德所说的"灵魂的掌控"继续作战
...fighting with Barnes for, what Rhah Called, possession of my soul,

1077
01:55:04,738 --> 01:55:06,138
我有时会觉得…
There are times sinCe...

1078
01:55:06,508 --> 01:55:10,538
我是那两个父亲的儿子
...I have felt like the Child born of those two fathers,

1079
01:55:13,118 --> 01:55:14,948
但无论如何…
But be that as it may...

1080
01:55:15,648 --> 01:55:19,248
我们有责任重建社会…
...those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again,

1081
01:55:20,018 --> 01:55:22,148
教导别人我们认识的一切…
To teaCh to others what we know...

1082
01:55:23,558 --> 01:55:26,158
我们利用剩下的一生…
...and to try with what's left of our lives...

1083
01:55:26,498 --> 01:55:30,228
尝试找寻生命的意义
...to find a goodness and meaning to this life,

1084
01:55:41,608 --> 01:55:46,978
献给在越战牺牲的士兵
