153
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,240
# Don't you cry for me

154
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,120
# For I come from Alabama
with my banjo...

155
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,549
<i>Mom and Dad didn't
want me to come here.</i>

156
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,036
<i>They wanted me to be like them:
Respectable, hard-working,</i>

157
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,116
<i>a little house, a family.</i>

158
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,391
<i>They drove me crazy
with their goddamn world, Grandma.</i>

159
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,476
<i>You know Mom.</i>

160
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,553
<i>I guess I've always been
sheltered and special.</i>

161
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,797
<i>I just wanna be anonymous
like everybody else,</i>

162
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,876
<i>do my share for my country.</i>

163
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,117
<i>Live up to what Grandpa did in the
first war, and Dad did in the second.</i>

164
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,800
<i>Well, here I am, anonymous,</i>

165
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,388
<i>with guys nobody really cares about.</i>

166
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,750
<i>Most come from the end of the line,</i>

167
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,519
<i>small towns you never heard of.</i>

168
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,757
<i>Pulaski, Tennessee.
Brandon, Mississippi.</i>

169
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,838
<i>Pork Bend, Utah.
Wampum, Pennsylvania.</i>

170
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,315
<i>Two years' high school's about it.</i>

171
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,797
<i>If they're lucky, a job waiting for them
back in a factory. Most have got nothing.</i>

172
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,876
<i>They're poor. They're the unwanted.</i>

173
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,798
<i>Yet they're fighting
for our society and our freedom.</i>

174
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,152
<i>It's weird, isn't it? At the bottom
of the barrel, and they know it.</i>

175
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,317
<i>Maybe that's why
they call themselves "grunts",</i>

176
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,238
<i>cos a grunt can take it,
can take anything.</i>

177
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,875
<i>They're the best I've ever seen,
Grandma. The heart and soul.</i>

178
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,796
Hey, Taylor...

179
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,115
Hey... cheese-dick, you're up.

180
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,196
- What?
- You're up.

181
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,515
Sure you know how to work
the claymores, dude?

182
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,595
I'm sure.

183
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,678
Flick the safety off
and bang on that sucker three times.

184
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,358
Three times. I got it.

185
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,718
Don't catch any Zs on me, buddy,
or I'll sling your sorry ass. You hear me?

186
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,512
OK.

187
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,195
<i>Maybe I've finally found it
way down here in the mud.</i>

188
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,515
<i>Maybe from down here
I can start up again.</i>

189
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,552
<i>Be something I can be proud of
without having to fake it,</i>

190
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,636
<i>be a fake human being.</i>

191
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,479
<i>Maybe I can see something
I don't yet see, or</i>

192
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,989
<i>learn something I don't yet know.</i>

193
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,873
<i>I miss you. I miss you very much.</i>

194
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,959
<i>Tell Mom I miss her, too. Chris.</i>

195
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,552
Junior.

196
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,436
Junior... Hey.

197
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,112
- All right, motherfucker!
- It's your shift, man... OK?

198
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,796
Here, take this.

199
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,671
Blow the fucking claymore!
Take the safety off, goddamn it!

200
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,513
Take the safety off!

201
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,833
Feed me, Junior!
Get over here and feed me!

202
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,033
My fucking arm!

203
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,439
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Easy, Tex! Easy, boy!

204
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,516
I can't even see!

205
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,835
- Doc, over here! Gardner's hit!
- Right there!

206
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,713
Oh, shit... I'm hit!

207
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,791
Taylor's hit!

208
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,876
Oh, shit!

209
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,590
- How bad is it?
- Dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore!

210
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,632
Relax, man, it's a scratch.
Hold this on here.

211
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,796
Don't lie to me, Doc. How bad is it?

212
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,832
He let 'em walk right up on us!
He was sleeping on his shift!

213
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,712
No, I did not.

214
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,116
Big Harold, keep an eye on him.
Don't let him go into shock.

215
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,310
Shut up! Shut up and take the pain!

216
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,311
Take the pain!

217
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,750
Hey, little guy... you're gonna be OK.

218
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,633
OK? Don't worry.

219
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,716
Big Harold,

220
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,316
do you know if...

221
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,396
if you're gonna die?

222
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,472
Do you feel like everything's
just gonna be fine?

223
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,990
Don't gimme that morbid bullshit!
You're about to get outta here.

224
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,471
They're gonna give you three hot meals
a day... White sheets...

225
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,195
Them pretty white nurses'll give you
blow jobs if you pay 'em enough!

226
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,232
- I heard about them white bitches!
- Don't babytalk him!

227
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,558
The cocksucker fell asleep!
He let 'em walk up on us, didn't do shit!

228
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,636
Just shut up, Junior.

229
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,312
You relax, OK, man?

230
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,396
OK...

231
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,276
It's not so bad...

232
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,952
Dying...

233
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,716
How long...

234
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,796
How long...

235
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,116
Come on, bird's on the way, man.
Hang in there. You're gonna make it!

236
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,869
Come on, Gardner, hang in there.
You're gonna make it!

237
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,309
Come on! Don't quit!

238
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,398
Come on, Gardner, help me!
Don't give up!

239
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,239
Y'all take a good look at this lump of shit.

240
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,034
Remember what it looks like.

241
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,039
You fuck up in a firefight and I goddamn
guarantee you a trip out of the bush,

242
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,156
in a body bag!

243
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,273
Out here, assholes, you keep
your shit wired tight at all times!

244
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,280
And that goes for you, shit-for-brains!

245
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,960
You don't sleep on no fucking ambush!

246
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,436
And the next sonofabitch I catch
copping Zs in the bush,

247
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,394
I'm personally gonna take
an interest in seeing him suffer.

248
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,118
I shit you not.

249
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,913
Doc... tag him and bag him!

250
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,795
I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant.

251
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,674
- It was Junior...
- Shut your face, chicken-shit!

252
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,552
You in big trouble, boy!

253
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,638
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor -
everybody got one.

254
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,716
Knock it off!

255
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,675
We got two men need attention here.

256
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,796
Police up your extra ammo and frags.
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.

257
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,592
Junior,

258
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,676
Tony,

259
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,756
carry Gardner.

260
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,878
The man would be alive if he had
a few more days to learn something.

261
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,355
Hey, Taylor, what's in the breeze?

262
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,233
OK. Got light duty. Three days' worth.

263
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,079
No shit!
Too bad we're in base camp, anyway.

264
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,156
- What you got? Beers?
- Yeah.

265
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,114
<i>Stole me some from the Top's supply.
Shit, he been stealing it from us.</i>

266
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,151
Taylor!

267
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,636
- Are you back?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

268
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,228
King, where did you get those beers, boy?

269
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,316
- I found it.
- You found it?

270
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,591
- You're going on report, son.
- Both of you, come with me.

271
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,676
I got a little job for you.

272
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,750
<i>Goo-o-o-o-o-ood morning, Vietnam!</i>

273
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,836
Motherfucker!

274
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,116
Motherfucker!

275
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,071
I'm too short for this shit, man!

276
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,192
They're always fucking with us...
no let-up!

277
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,198
Politics, man. Fucking politics.

278
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,790
That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far up
Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio!

279
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,351
39 and a wake-up, a pause for the cause,
and I'm a gone motherfucker!

280
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,436
- Back to the world!
- I hear you, man.

281
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,516
- Broke 100 the other day.
- No shit!

282
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,438
92 left to go. April 17.

283
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,630
DEROS, man. Home to California.

284
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,309
I'm gonna be sitting outside,
checking out the babes on the beach.

285
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,670
The surfing's gonna be good!

286
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,756
March, man, in Tennessee.

287
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,431
Sniff the pines... sniff that
cross-mounted pussy down by the river!

288
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,516
Hot damn!

289
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,191
Hey, Taylor, how long have you got left?
300 and what?

290
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,276
32.

291
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,356
332 days.

292
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,516
<i>Sin loi, my boy!</i>

293
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,996
I can't even remember
when I was 332, man!

294
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,270
You gotta, like, count backwards.

295
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,632
You know, you got 40 days in.
I mean, think positive, dude.

296
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,277
Hey, Taylor,
how the fuck you get here, anyway?

297
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,119
- You look educated.
- I volunteered.

298
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,754
- You did what?
- I volunteered. I...

299
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,192
dropped out of college, told 'em
I wanted the infantry, combat, Vietnam.

300
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,959
You volunteered for this shit, man?

301
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,230
Can you believe that?

302
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,352
You's a crazy fucker... giving up college.

303
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,597
Didn't make much sense.
I wasn't learning anything.

304
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,518
I figured, why should
just the poor kids go off to war

305
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,029
and the rich kids
always get away with it?

306
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,994
- What we got here is a crusader.
- Sounds like it.

307
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,553
Shit!

308
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,832
You gotta be rich in the first place
to think like that.

309
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,914
Everybody know

310
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,795
the poor always being fucked over
by the rich. Always have, always will.

311
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,594
I tell you what - you be cool, I introduce
you round to some of the heads.

312
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,551
What are the heads?

313
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,352
Later, man!

314
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,476
What's up, brother?

315
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,511
Your Highness has arrived!
Hey, what's happening?

316
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,279
I thought you was hanging ten
in Cambodia!

317
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,392
- Hey, man, how ya doing?
- How ya doing, man?

318
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,476
All right!

319
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,509
What you doing in the underworld,
Taylor?

320
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,676
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot.

321
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,268
This man here is Chris.
He been resurrected.

322
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,239
Go ahead, Taylor.

323
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,828
- What?
- Are you lame or something?

324
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,990
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

325
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,869
Here!

326
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,752
Your shit's in the wind, troop!

327
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,996
Hey, man, what's happening?

328
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,591
If you do that baa,
you'd better do it right.

329
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,030
You're weird, man.

330
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,958
You're a child, Lerner.
I don't waste time on you.

331
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,800
- First time?
- Yeah.

332
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,876
Then the worm has definitely turned
for you, man.

333
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,192
Feel good?

334
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,915
Yeah, it feels good.
I got no pain in my neck now.

335
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,600
Feeling good's good enough.

336
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,956
Put your mouth on this.

337
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,275
Where the hell is everybody, man?
They getting high, that's what.

338
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,358
Bunch of hopheads. They think
they're something special!

339
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,313
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

340
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,591
Redneck noise, dude, that's all it is.
Make about as much sense as you do.

341
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,671
All them chucks be rappin'
about how they losing their ho,

342
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,598
saying how they ain't got
no bread for beer.

343
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,876
Fuck that honky shit!
Gimme some Motown jams - dig it?

344
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,071
What are you talking shit for, man?

345
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,670
- Junior, you ever smoke any shit?
- That's right, dude!

346
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,429
Y'all be trying to keep the black man
down and string him out on that shit.

347
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,189
The time be's coming, my man,
when the black man throw that yoke off.

348
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,198
Simple - free your mind,
your ass will follow.

349
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,313
I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit,
everything kinda gets weird.

350
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,399
You hear that story about the gooks
putting chemicals in the grass?

351
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,829
So we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

352
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,157
Don't you worry, Bunny.
You's a killer anyway, man.

353
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,840
I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

354
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,236
Ain't nothing like a piece of pussy,
'cept maybe the Indy 500.

355
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,830
<i>Only way you'd get some pussy is
if a bitch dies and wills it to you</i>

356
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,712
<i>and then... maybe!</i>

357
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,196
How's it going, Bunny?

358
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,878
LT,

359
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,956
check it out.

360
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,236
Like that?

361
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,794
Terrific. I'll send it home.

362
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,559
Hey, Junior.

363
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,035
- Lieutenant.
- Hello, sir.

364
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,353
Hey, Rodriguez,
that's quite a shrine you got there.

365
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,277
Thank you, sir.

366
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,356
You... need anything?

367
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,038
No, sir.

368
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,909
This guy's easily three,
four times my size.

369
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,477
I got him in the O'Neill death grip.
He don't know whether to shit or go blind!

370
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,995
- Whaddaya say, LT?
- How ya doing, Red?

371
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,351
Not good. This cocksucker's got
every card in the deck.

372
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,631
- Full house.
- Look like you're doing all right!

373
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,320
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

374
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,829
Hey, Lieutenant,
some Kentucky windage?

375
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,278
Thanks, Sandy.

376
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,629
Play, Lieutenant?

377
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,196
Nah. Wouldn't wanna get raped
by you guys.

378
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,791
Why's that, Lieutenant?
What are you saving up to be? Jewish?

379
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,197
Jewish!

380
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,109
I gotta run. I'II, uh, catch you men later.
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

381
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,879
Well, that is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

382
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,955
What do you say there, Bob?
Guy like that make it? Yes or no?

383
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,913
I have to tell you,
that's precisely what I saw.

384
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,996
Sometimes I just look at a guy

385
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,588
and I know this fella's not gonna make it.

386
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,676
Just no fucking way.

387
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,796
Get it going now!

388
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,280
# People say I'm the life of the party

389
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,760
# Cos I tell a joke or two

390
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,240
# Although I might be laughing

391
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,520
# Loud and hearty

392
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,000
# Deep inside I'm blue

393
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,960
# So take a good look at my face

394
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,360
# You see the smile

395
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,800
# Looks out of place

396
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,120
# If you look closer, it's easy to trace

397
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,760
# The tracks of my tears

398
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,400
Yeah!

399
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,440
# I need you
# Need you!

400
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,800
# Need you
# Need you!

401
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,595
<i>New Year's Day, 1968.</i>

402
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,710
<i>Just another day. Staying alive.</i>

403
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,877
<i>There's been a lot of movement
near the Cambodian border.</i>

404
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,070
<i>Regiments of NVA moving across.</i>

405
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,953
<i>A lot of little firefights, ambushes.</i>

406
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,596
<i>We drop bombs, then we walk through
the jungle like ghosts in a landscape.</i>

407
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,956
Bunker.

408
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,112
Where?

409
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,799
<i>Roger. Bunkers at point.
Two actuals on the way.</i>

410
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,238
Bravo Six, Bravo Two. Be advised
there is a bunker complex up front.

411
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,954
<i>We're on the way down. Over.</i>

412
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,996
See you next week!

413
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,436
Taylor, get your ass up on that flank -
about 50 metres.

414
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,835
Washington, you cover this side.

415
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,394
- Yes, sir.
- Get off your ass, Harold.

416
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,475
Bummer!

417
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,957
Christ, look at that, will ya? The teapot's
still boiling! They were just here!

418
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,151
Man, this is spooky, Sander.
Let's get outta here.

419
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,436
Watch it... watch it!

420
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,396
Look what we got, Sal.

421
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,476
We got maps,

422
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,310
we got... S...

423
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,874
Man, this is gook stuff!
Let's get outta here!

424
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,719
No, Sal, this is important,
this is important.

425
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,916
Come on, let's leave! Let's go!

426
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,674
Booby trap! Get down!

427
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,828
Medic!

428
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,432
Holy jeez!

429
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,356
Goddamn it!

430
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,035
We got... We got two men down, sir.

431
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,076
There was an explosion.

432
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,350
Listen, we need help, sir, ASAP.

433
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,631
Move your ass outta here!
One round could get all you guys!

434
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,115
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

435
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,791
Lieutenant... tell Six we need engineers.
This pos is crawling with traps.

436
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,072
On their way. The NVA have been spotted
in the village half a klik down the river.

437
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,430
- Six says we gotta get there ASAP.
- OK.

438
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,917
Also, leave four of your men here,
and a medic, OK? Move it out.

439
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,119
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

440
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,999
- Hey, where's Manny?
- Manny?

441
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,873
- Hey, Washington!
- Manny?

442
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,310
- Manny?
- Washington!

443
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,795
Manny, where you at?

444
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,400
<i>We had to get to the village
before dark,</i>

445
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,557
<i>so we left Elias with some men
to keep looking.</i>

446
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,070
<i>But it was King who found him,
about a thousand yards downriver,</i>

447
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,156
<i>not far from the village.</i>

448
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,276
<i>It was the end of the mystery.</i>

449
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,636
The motherfuckers!

450
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,833
<i>The village which had stood
for maybe 1,000 years</i>

451
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,349
<i>didn't know we were coming that day.</i>

452
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,436
<i>If they had, they would've run.</i>

453
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,190
<i>Barnes was at the eye of our rage
and, through him, our Captain Ahab.</i>

454
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,311
<i>He would set things right again.</i>

455
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,396
<i>That day we loved him.</i>

456
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,036
There he goes, Sarge!

457
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,953
- Check him out.
- Yeah, you got it, Sarge.

458
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,230
Tubbs, Ebenhock, let's go!

459
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,510
Get that stupid look off your face!

460
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,436
Hey, piggy, piggy! Hey, pig!

461
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,596
Bunny, clear the hooches now!

462
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,473
Spread out on the right!
OK, watch your back!

463
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,556
Let's go! Let's move 'em out!

464
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,509
Let's go! Move it! Go!

465
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,234
- Move it!
- Come on, let's go!

466
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,071
Let's go, Junior! Bring 'em in!
Get those people down here!

467
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,435
Get outta there, you fuckheads! Move!

468
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,953
Come on!

469
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,039
- Put 'em in the pig pen!
- Kill these!

470
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,476
Give me your willie pete!

471
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,628
Shut up!

472
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,876
Get back!

473
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,433
Fire in the hole!

474
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,356
Get 'em outta here!

475
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,436
Oh, fuck! We got one!

476
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,112
Get the fuck outta the hole!

477
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,754
Get the fuck outta there!
Come on, motherfucker!

478
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,836
Be cool. They're scared, man.

479
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,758
<i>They're scared?
What about me, man?</i>

480
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,668
I'm sick of this fucking shit!
Come on, motherfucker! Move!

481
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,756
Watch this fucker!

482
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,953
Who the fuck do you think
they're fighting for? Got one more!

483
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,551
Well, well. What have we here?

484
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,117
We got one, two, three, four mag 58
Czechoslovakian machine guns.

485
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,316
Barnes, they got enough rice here
to feed a whole fucking regiment.

486
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,512
Sergeant Warren,
you bring that honcho over here.

487
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,119
Tubbs, get outta there.

488
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,753
Junior, burn it.

489
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,629
What the fuck's the matter?
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

490
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,950
Look like I was gonna fucking hurt you?

491
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,629
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?
Why didn't you fucking listen to me?

492
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,433
Fucking stupid? You stupid asshole!

493
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,111
Get the fuck up here! Come here,
motherfucker! What are you smiling at?

494
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,754
Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?

495
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,995
Do 'em, man!

496
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,630
What are you smiling at?
You want something to smile at?

497
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,278
Motherfucker! Dance, motherfucker!

498
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,873
Dance, one-legger! Dance!

499
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,158
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

500
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,711
Hey, man, come on. Let's go, man.

501
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,196
Fucking pussy, man!
He's laughing at you!

502
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,276
That's the way the gook laughs.

503
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,311
Yeah, sure you are!

504
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,396
You're real sorry, ain't ya?

505
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,312
You're just crying your little hearts out
about Sandy and Sal, and Manny!

506
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,193
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

507
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,276
Whaddaya say?

508
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,952
Holy shit! Did you see
that fucking head come apart, man?

509
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,313
I never seen brains like that before, man!

510
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,472
I bet you the old bitch runs
the whole fucking show, man!

511
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,832
She probably cut Manny's throat.
Probably cut my balls off if she could.

512
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,999
We leave now, and nobody saw a fucking
thing! You understand me, Taylor?

513
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,079
Come on, man, let's fucking do her!
Let's do this whole fucking village!

514
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,958
Look at the scars
on this gook honcho, Sarge.

515
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,956
Get out of here, Tubbs.

516
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,996
Where'd he get these wounds?

517
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,709
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid.
- He's a dink for sure!

518
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,630
Ask him why these weapons were here.

519
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,030
They had no choice. The NVA killed
the old honcho when he said no.

520
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,232
- All the rice is theirs.
- Bullshit, Lerner!

521
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,670
Who the hell was the gook
we nailed on the riverbank?

522
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,716
He doesn't know. He says NVA ain't
been around in a couple of months.

523
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,230
- Maybe it was a scout or something.
- Yeah, sure, a scout!

524
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,830
What about the fucking rice and
the weapons? Who are they for?

525
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,798
That cocksucker knows
what I'm saying, don't you, pop?

526
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,150
Goddamn right he does!

527
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,511
- He's lying through his teeth!
- Waste the fucker!

528
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,677
Where the hell's the VC?

529
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,270
He swears he doesn't know anything.
He hates the NVA, but...

530
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,311
What's the bitch saying?

531
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,829
She's going on about
why we killed the pigs.

532
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,838
- They gotta make a living. All that shit.
- Jesus!

533
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,271
Shut up!

534
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,913
Shut the fuck up!

535
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,868
You tell him, he starts talking
or I'm gonna waste more of 'em!

536
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,558
Tell him, Lerner!

537
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,958
Hey, Sarge! Let us in on this, all right?

538
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,713
Let's go for it!
Let's do the whole fucking village!

539
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,229
Come on!
What the fuck are we waiting for?

540
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,514
- Let's do 'em!
- Outta my way!

541
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,355
This is his daughter, right? Right?

542
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,389
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

543
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,749
Barnes!

544
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,678
Barnes!

545
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,108
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

546
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,149
Stay outta this, Elias.
This ain't your show.

547
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,355
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

548
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,439
- Get him, Barnes!
- Come on, Barnes! Come on, Barnes!

549
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,357
Get him!

550
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,550
Tear his fucking head off!

551
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,718
Break it up!

552
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,716
Break it up!

553
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,671
Goddamn!

554
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,793
You're dead, Elias!
I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

555
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,753
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

556
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,872
This shit won't wash, you fucking puke!

557
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,956
Break it up! Shut up!

558
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,836
Break it up! Listen up!

559
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,030
Captain says to torch this place!

560
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,431
Torch this place!
Blow the weapons in place!

561
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,358
Round up all suspected VC
and shake it up!

562
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,040
- We ain't got much light left!
- Lieutenant...

563
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,709
- Why didn't you do something?
- What are you talking about?

564
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,354
You know what the fuck I'm talking about!

565
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,429
No, I don't. I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about, Elias!

566
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,156
All right, move it out! Let's go!

567
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,589
Taylor, let's go, for Christ's sake!

568
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,757
Move it out! Police up the weapons,
and let's go!

569
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,676
Fire in the hole!

570
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,556
Fire in the hole!

571
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,153
Hey, come on! Morehouse!

572
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,238
You fucker! Get outta here!
Get the fuck off!

573
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,796
Don't do it! Don't do it! You fucker!

574
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,876
What is this?

575
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,108
- What, you a homosexual, Taylor?
- Taylor, she's a fucking dink!

576
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,708
She's a fucking human being, man!

577
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,150
- Fuck you!
- You're a fucking cherry, Taylor!

578
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,829
Fucking animal!
All of you, you're fucking animals!

579
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,712
Fucking lame fuck!

580
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,673
You don't belong in Nam, man!
Ain't your place at all!

581
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,109
You don't fucking get it, do you, man?

582
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,237
You just don't fucking get it.

583
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,713
It's OK.

584
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,116
Get outta there!

585
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,432
Fuck you, man.

586
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,994
Police up your dicks
and let's get outta here.

587
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,990
<i>- I didn't see anything, sir.
- I did.</i>

588
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,998
That dink was reported to me
as NVA by Sergeant Barnes, sir.

589
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,669
My report will include Lieutenant Wolfe
as being witness to the shooting.

590
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,313
All right, Elias.

591
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,998
Staff Sergeant Barnes.

592
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,475
Sir!

593
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,512
I want a full report on this
when we get back to the CP.

594
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,918
You got it, and I can throw in
plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.

595
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,395
Not now, goddamn it, not now!

596
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,354
We'll get into this when we get back
to camp. I can promise you something.

597
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,040
If I find out there was an illegal killing,

598
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,151
there will be a court martial.

599
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,432
<i>Right now I need every man in the field.
And you two will cease fire.</i>

600
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,472
Staff Sergeant Barnes, Sergeant Elias...

601
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,556
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

602
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,992
We're back in that NVA bunker complex
tomorrow. This time from the east.

603
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,511
You people get some rest and be back
here at the CP at 1900 for a briefing.

604
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,198
Yes, sir.

605
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,632
Come on, man.

606
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,593
You think these chucks give a fuck
about you and me?

607
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,599
It could just as well have been you,
Harold, if you got in Barnes' way.

608
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,238
And that Bunny? That motherfucker's
crazy! I mean, he scares me, man.

609
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,316
He just scares me.

610
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,591
You bloods are getting
too hung up on all this shit.

611
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,439
These gooks are a lot smarter
than you think.

612
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,869
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

613
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,549
They was NVA, every last one of 'em.

614
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,719
He's taken us this far, right?
He'll take us the rest of the way.

615
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,913
A Christian don't go around a village
cutting off heads and shit.

616
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,589
This shit is really getting outta
hand, man. Way outta control.

617
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,871
Seems to me that you don't seem
to know the difference,

618
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,594
the way you shoot up
that shit all the time.

619
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,156
I don't know, brothers,

620
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,960
but I'm hurting real bad inside.

621
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,998
Don't worry about it.
Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

622
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,078
- He's a troublemaker.
- Elias is a water-walker.

623
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,510
Like them politicians in Washington
trying to fight this war

624
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,200
with one hand tied around their balls.

625
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,198
Ain't no need or time
for a courtroom out here.

626
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,830
- Sarge.
- Thanks, Bun.

627
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,836
How'd it go there, Bob?

628
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,191
Yeah, that-away, Sarge.
Fucking Elias, man.

629
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,629
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

630
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,150
He's gonna get everybody
in this platoon in deep shit.

631
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,589
Somebody oughta frag his ass.

632
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,429
So whaddaya think, Bob?
Gonna be an investigation or what?

633
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,873
Bob?

634
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,714
O'Neill, man, you worry too much.
Sarge'll take care of it.

635
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,311
It's a beautiful night.

636
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,477
Yeah. I love this place at night.

637
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,352
The stars...

638
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,080
There's no right or wrong in 'em.

639
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,952
They're just there.

640
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,036
That's a nice way of putting it.

641
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,636
Barnes has got it in for you, doesn't he?

642
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,310
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

643
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,870
And you? Do you believe?

644
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,390
In '65... yeah.

645
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,873
Now,

646
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,393
no.

647
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,079
What happened today
is just the beginning.

648
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,636
We're gonna lose this war.

649
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,671
Come on!

650
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,758
You really think so? Us?

651
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,077
We've been kicking
other people's asses for so long,

652
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,589
I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

653
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,114
<i>Day by day, I struggle to maintain</i>

654
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,629
<i>not only my strength, but my sanity.</i>

655
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,832
<i>It's all a blur. I have no energy to write.</i>

656
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,918
<i>I don't know what's right
and what's wrong any more.</i>

657
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,715
<i>The morale of the men is low.
There's civil war in the platoon.</i>

658
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,229
<i>Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.</i>

659
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:46,150
<i>There's a lot of suspicion and hate.
I can't believe we're fighting each other</i>

660
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,430
<i>when we should be fighting them.</i>

661
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:54,113
<i>Counting days, and the six inches
in front of my face. Not much else.</i>

662
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,038
<i>Hope things are well, Grandma.
Tell Mom and Dad I...</i>

663
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,118
<i>Well... just tell them. Chris.</i>

664
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,199
Hey, big boy, I know you thought
you had that laundry gig all laid out.

665
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,432
I gotta paint myself white
just to get me one of them fucking jobs!

666
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,348
I got my request in for a circumcision!
I'm gonna get my big ass outta here!

667
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,436
You gonna become a rabbi?

668
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,516
Leech.

669
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,875
All right!

670
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,956
Move it out!

671
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,709
Don't drink that, asshole.
You're gonna get malaria.

672
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,273
Yeah, I hope so!

673
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,833
Let's go!

674
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,720
Doc! Get up here! Lerner's hit!

675
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,956
Sergeant Warren's hit!

676
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,516
What the fuck's going on?

677
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,394
They got RPGs, man! It's an ambush!
They were fucking waiting for us!

678
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,875
- Who's on point?
- Lerner and Warren!

679
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,956
Taylor, where are you going?

680
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,954
Goddamn it, you assholes!
Get some firepower up there!

681
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,916
Watch out! Rockets!

682
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,311
- Where the fuck's Lerner?
- He's over there! By the log!

683
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:51,314
Fire mission! Grid 649402.

684
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,396
Direction, 610...

685
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,319
Adjust fire! Over!

686
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,197
Lieutenant, they're gonna get in
tight under the arty!

687
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,313
Let me get some men and roll up
that flank. I can work right up on them!

688
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,672
Get me Barnes! Elias, we got four down
up there! What do you want me to do?

689
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,035
Where the fuck is Red Platoon?
Tell those assholes to get up here!

690
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:19,312
- Elias, what the fuck are you!
- Listen, Barnes, there's holes here.

691
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,238
Third Platoon's coming up here.
We're here.

692
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:26,399
Dinks get men in these holes,
they got us caught in the crossfire.

693
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,511
Sounds pretty far out to me, Elias.

694
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,791
I've seen it happen - la Drang in '66.

695
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,480
They cut us to fucking pieces!
I need three men!

696
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,479
- OK, you got 'em. Take off.
- Keep pouring off that cover fire.

697
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,195
I don't want to be stuck out there
with my ass hanging in the breeze!

698
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,154
You don't tell me
how to run my war, Elias!

699
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,716
You go crying and rat-fucking
to brigade on your own time!

700
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,832
Out here you belong to me! Now, move!

701
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,552
You're an asshole, Barnes!

702
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,069
Sir, get that asshole O'Neill up here!

703
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,431
Two Charlie, this is two! Be advised!

704
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,035
Stay down!

705
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,272
- Ammo!
- Ammo!

706
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,911
Sarge! Short round!

707
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,316
Medic!

708
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,193
Satchel charge!

709
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,438
Doc!

710
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,236
Doc, help me out!

711
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,236
You OK?

712
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,591
- Don't leave me, man.
- All right.

713
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,872
- Hey, Gator... you'll be OK, man.
- Don't leave me, man.

714
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,673
Gator, hang tough. You'll be OK.

715
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,756
Drop your rucks.

716
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,110
Taylor, you're coming with us.

717
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,878
Please don't go! Don't!

718
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,638
You're gonna be OK.

719
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,473
- Come on!
- Doc! Take care of him, man.

720
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,994
Redleg! Redleg!
Ripper Bravo Two actual!

721
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,076
Adjustment follows!

722
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,793
You ignorant asshole! What the fuck
coordinates are you giving?

723
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,879
You wasted a lot of people up there
with your fucked-up fire mission!

724
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,558
You know that?

725
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,829
You know that? Ah, shit!

726
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,792
Redleg! Redleg! Ripper Bravo Two!

727
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,718
Check your fire! Check your fire!

728
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,712
They're coming.

729
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,515
Stagger yourself across this line.

730
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,596
Shoot anything that moves.

731
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,359
- They'll be coming from over there.
- Gotcha.

732
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,597
Any one of 'em gets through,
we're truly fucked.

733
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,477
<i>Where the hell are you going?</i>

734
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,592
Down by the river, about 100 metres,

735
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,676
in case they try to flank us.

736
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,473
Third Platoon's coming up to our rear,
so watch for 'em.

737
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,431
Can I go with you?

738
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,114
No.

739
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,196
I move faster alone.

740
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,229
Come here. Let's let arty
do a little bit of the work here.

741
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,352
You tell everybody to pull back
to the church.

742
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,199
We link up with Third Platoon.
You got that?

743
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,029
What about Elias?
If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

744
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,118
You just haul ass, too, Lieutenant!

745
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,992
I'll get him.

746
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,432
- I got two of them fuckers, man!
- I got one!

747
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,120
Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dicks!

748
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,592
Crawford!

749
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,075
Oh, man!

750
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,317
Kiss my ass, man!
I never thought I'd get hit!

751
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,035
It's a lung, babe.
You got two of them fuckers.

752
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:08,438
Sarge, a bunch of gooks came through
there. We got three of the fuckers!

753
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,199
Did you hear the arty shift?
We're pulling back.

754
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,390
Get the fuck back to church.

755
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,354
- Elias is still out there, Sarge!
- Taylor, I'll get him!

756
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,519
You get Crawford in. Now! Before you
Article 15 both your asses! Move!

757
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,596
Move it!

758
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,156
We still got ya.

759
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,431
- Come on, brother.
- Medic, where the fuck are you?

760
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,109
You're gonna be all right
in a minute, brother.

761
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,876
Taylor, where are you going?

762
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,435
Elias is dead. Fall back with the platoon.

763
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,074
- Get going.
- He's dead?

764
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,078
Yeah. He's back there about 100 metres.

765
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,031
You saw him? Where?

766
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:49,073
He's dead! There's gooks all over
the goddamn place! Get moving!

767
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,228
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Move it!

768
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,158
Let's go! Move it, move it!
OK, let's go!

769
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,479
You OK, Harold?
You're on the next one. You're OK, bud.

770
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,115
Oh, fuck!

771
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,791
They've got Elias!

772
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,875
What?

773
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,430
Back down! Back down there!

774
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,719
<i>Snake One-Nine, Fly Four.
There's still one of the men down there.</i>

775
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,278
<i>Hold your armour!
Guns, guns, pull up, pull up!</i>

776
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,755
<i>We're trying to cover it on my side.</i>

777
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,957
He killed him. I know that he killed him.
I saw his eyes when he came back in.

778
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,311
How do you know the dinks didn't
get him? You got no proof, man.

779
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,877
<i>The proof's in the eyes, man. You were
there. I know what you were thinking.</i>

780
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,956
I say we frag that fucker tonight!

781
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,116
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

782
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,274
I say let military justice do the job on him.

783
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,152
Fuck the military justice!
Are you joking me?

784
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:10,239
Who do you think they'll believe?
O'Neill? Bunny? Wolfe? Bullshit!

785
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,316
Shit, man, you try that,

786
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,193
Barnes'll shove it up your ass
with a candle on it!

787
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,117
What do you suggest we do, huh?

788
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,390
<i>I suggest you all watch your own asses!</i>

789
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,080
Barnes is gonna
be coming down on all of 'em!

790
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,590
You gonna forget about Elias and all
the good times we done had in here?

791
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,712
You're trying to cure the headache
by cutting off the head.

792
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,309
Elias didn't ask you to fight
his battles for him.

793
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,149
And if there's a heaven -
and, God, I hope there is -

794
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:42,434
I know he's sitting up there drunk as
a fucking monkey, and smoking shit,

795
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,835
cos he done left his pains down here.

796
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,999
You're wrong, man! Any way you cut it,
Barnes is a fucking murderer!

797
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,190
Taylor...

798
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:55,757
I remember when you first came in here,
telling me how you admired the bastard!

799
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,359
- I was wrong.
- Wrong?

800
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,119
You ain't never been right...
about nothing!

801
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,958
And dig this, you assholes,
and dig it good!

802
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,358
Barnes has been shot seven times,
and he ain't dead!

803
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,153
Does that mean anything to you, huh?

804
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,236
Barnes ain't meant to die!

805
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,351
The only thing
that could kill Barnes... is Barnes.

806
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,396
Talking about killing?

807
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,036
You all experts?

808
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,716
You all know about killing?

809
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,030
I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

810
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,317
You smoking this shit
so as to escape from reality?

811
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,996
Me, I don't need this shit.

812
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,876
<i>I am reality.</i>

813
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,790
There's the way it ought to be,
and there's the way it is.

814
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,476
Elias was full of shit.

815
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,116
Elias was a crusader.

816
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,148
I got no fight with any man
who does what he's told,

817
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,718
but when he don't...
the machine breaks down.

818
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,878
<i>And when the machine breaks down
we break down.</i>

819
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,469
And I ain't gonna allow that

820
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,716
from any of you.

821
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,912
Not one.

822
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,316
You all love Elias.

823
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,876
You wanna kick ass.

824
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,998
Well, here I am, all by my lonesome.

825
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,999
And there ain't nobody gonna know.

826
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,916
Six of you boys against me.

827
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,792
Kill me.

828
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,636
I shit on all of you!

829
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,349
You motherfucker!

830
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,196
- Come on, man, get him!
- Oh, fuck!

831
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,276
Get him, Chris!

832
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,068
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man.

833
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,952
You'll go dinky dow in LBJ.

834
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,389
Ten years for killing an enlisted man.

835
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,671
Ten years climbing
the fucking walls, man!

836
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,676
Don't do it!

837
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,956
Death?

838
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,549
What do you all know about death?

839
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,358
<i>They sent us back into the valley
the next day,</i>

840
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,472
<i>about 2000 metres from Cambodia,
into a battalion perimeter.</i>

841
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,910
<i>It felt like we were returning
to the scene of a crime.</i>

842
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,832
<i>Alpha Company had been hit hard
by a sizeable force</i>

843
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,157
<i>and Charlie Company
had been probed that night.</i>

844
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,840
<i>There were other battalions
in the valley,</i>

845
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,713
<i>but we knew we were gonna be
the bait to lure them out.</i>

846
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:03,072
<i>Somewhere out there
was the entire 141 st NVA Regiment.</i>

847
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:24,992
Caught those motherfuckers trying to
pull some shit on Charlie Company.

848
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,076
They found maps on 'em, man.

849
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,591
A friend at Battalion says they had
every fucking foxhole fixed on it.

850
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,679
Distances... tree lines... our claymores...

851
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:40,635
- Everything.
- This is bad, man. I got bad vibes here.

852
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,194
I also heard
we're in fucking Cambodia now.

853
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,959
Cambodia? Man, you kidding me!

854
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,036
You wanted to see me, sir?

855
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,789
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like
you got Elias's squad now.

856
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,072
I didn't know we were still referring to
this platoon in terms of squads.

857
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:01,591
All right, look... I want you to take
those two holes there and there.

858
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,553
You're tying it off with Barnes
up here, King down there.

859
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:08,639
Begging your pardon, sir.
My two holes are far enough apart

860
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,399
you could run a regiment through
and never see 'em.

861
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,431
I got five live bodies left, sir.

862
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:16,711
I don't wanna hear your problems.
You'll get new men any day.

863
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,991
- Make do like everybody else.
- I didn't ask for this job.

864
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,475
- I don't wanna hear it.
- You don't wanna hear it?

865
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:27,674
That's right. I don't wanna hear it cos, to
tell you the truth, I don't give a shit, OK?

866
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,756
I don't give a flying fuck any more.

867
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,839
Right.

868
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,475
I'm glad I ain't going with 'em.

869
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,156
Somewhere out there's the beast,
and he hungry tonight.

870
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,236
What a fuckin' bummer!

871
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:51,069
Ten days and a wake-up
and I'm still dealing with this shit.

872
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,710
What's the matter with you, man?

873
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,990
How come you ain't writing nobody?

874
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:03,989
What about your folks? That grandma
you was telling me about?

875
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,438
Girl?

876
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,278
Got a mother and father, don't you?
There must be somebody.

877
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,356
Nah, there's nobody.

878
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,678
You been smoking too much
of this shit, troop.

879
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,480
Gotta control that - bring a man down.

880
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,595
I remember when you first come out here
to the bush. You was green as a...

881
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:34,759
Ever get caught in a mistake that
you just can't get out of, King?

882
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,030
There's a way out of anything, man.

883
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,232
Just keep your pecker hard
and your powder dry

884
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,316
and the worm will turn.

885
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,670
How many days are you short?

886
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,552
Nah, it's not just me.

887
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:53,719
It's the way the whole thing works.
People like Elias get wasted.

888
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,719
People like Barnes go on making up
the rules any way they want.

889
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,798
So what do we do?
Sit in the middle and suck on it.

890
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,474
We just don't add up to dry shit, King.

891
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,556
Whoever said we did, man?

892
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,399
All you got to do is make it outta here

893
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,672
and it's all gravy. Every day,
the rest of your life - gravy!

894
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,476
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

895
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,071
King, collect up your shit.
Your order's just come through.

896
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:27,398
- Don't fuck with me.
- What, you need a written invitation?

897
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,354
Cocksucker! Oh, wow!
The lifers have made a mistake!

898
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,752
They cut me some slack, Taylor!

899
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,839
Get your pig to Rodriguez. You got ten
minutes to make the last chopper out.

900
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,633
If you're not on it... I'm gonna be.

901
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,115
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

902
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,150
Great, King. I'm happy for you, man.
You take it on home for me, OK?

903
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,999
You got my address.
You know where to get hold of me.

904
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,829
I gotta di-di, man.
I don't wanna miss that chopper.

905
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,033
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

906
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,878
Remember now, take it easy.

907
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,798
Don't think too much,
and don't you be no fool.

908
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,879
Ain't no such thing as a coward
out here. It don't mean nothing.

909
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,956
My man!

910
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,236
I'll walk you out, man.

911
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,513
Take it easy, King.

912
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,870
I'll take it any way I can get it, brother!

913
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,069
Later!

914
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,189
I'm pretty fucked up, Sarge.
No, man, don't touch this!

915
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,555
I gotta get on that chopper, man!

916
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,478
- So what's the problem?
- Says he can't walk.

917
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,352
Shit!

918
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,915
Martin... get your boots on.

919
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,832
Next time I catch you spraying
'skeeter repellant on your fucking feet,

920
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,838
I'm gonna court-martial your nigger ass.

921
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,349
Then court-martial me, motherfucker!

922
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,040
Bust my ass!
Send me to fucking Long Binh!

923
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,071
Do your fucking worst!

924
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,431
You white folks have got
your last klik outta Junior!

925
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,908
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

926
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,076
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.

927
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,876
That... long, hairy, red and black
bastard I found in the ammo crate.

928
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,476
I'll put it in his crotch, see if he can walk.

929
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,669
I remember now.

930
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,557
Hold up, man! You just hold up!
Wait, all right?

931
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:28,638
Fuck it, I'll walk!
I'll fucking walk, man!

932
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,433
<i>Fucking pussy!
Sarge, I gotta have him in my hole?</i>

933
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,039
Yeah.

934
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,720
Bob? I'd like to speak to you a minute.

935
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,916
I can't take it no more!

936
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,430
- I'd like to speak to you. Bob...
- Yeah, what is it?

937
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,037
Bob, I got Elias's R and R.
It's coming up in three days.

938
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:52,993
I was thinking about going
to Hawaii to see Patsy.

939
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,759
Bob, I never asked you
for a fucking thing.

940
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,589
To be honest, I hoped you'd put me
on that chopper with King.

941
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:03,269
- Whaddaya say, chief-a-rooney?
- I can't do that for you, Red.

942
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:06,392
We need every swinging dick
in the field. You know that.

943
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,717
Talk to me! All I'm asking you for
is three fucking days here!

944
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,354
<i>I am talking to you, Red,
and I'm telling you no.</i>

945
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,879
- Get back in your foxhole!
- Bob...

946
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,560
I got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

947
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,276
I got a bad feeling.

948
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,515
I don't think I'm gonna make it outta here.

949
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,995
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

950
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,273
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

951
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,956
Oh... shit!

952
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:55,396
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

953
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,159
There goes a fucking ambush.

954
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,510
They ain't even waiting till later.

955
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,995
It's fucking coming now, man.

956
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,793
Right fucking now.

957
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,396
You know, Junior,
some of the things we done, man,

958
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,318
I don't feel like we done
something wrong.

959
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,396
Sometimes, man,

960
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,956
I get this bad feeling.

961
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,549
I told the padre the truth, man.
I like it here.

962
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,638
You get to do what you want.
Nobody fucks with you.

963
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,910
The only worry you got is dying.

964
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:48,750
If that happens, you won't know about
it anyway. So what the fuck, man?

965
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,917
Shit! I gotta be in this hole with you, man?

966
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,194
I just know I shouldn't have come.

967
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,158
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging
with Audie Murphy here, my man!

968
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,998
Bravo Three, Bravo Six.
Send me a grid. Over.

969
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:09,556
<i>I can't, sir! We're pinned down!
They're in the fucking trees!</i>

970
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:14,231
Calm down, son. I'll get you a fire
mission ASAP. Smoke'll be first.

971
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,114
<i>Lieutenant's dead, radio man's dead.
I don't know where the map is.</i>

972
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:21,994
<i>They're all around us - hundreds!
I can hear 'em talking gook.</i>

973
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:26,830
OK, now spot that smoke and tell me
where to shift. Calm down, son.

974
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,077
We'll get you out.
Tell me where the rounds hit. Over.

975
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:50,637
Three Alpha Six, how about those rounds,
son? Can you adjust fire? Over.

976
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,552
Three Alpha Six, if you can't talk, son,
just key your handset twice. Over.

977
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,229
Shit!

978
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,116
Trip flare - Rodriguez's hole!

979
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,515
RPG!

980
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,959
Doc!

981
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,355
- Taylor! Francis!
- Over here, man!

982
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:16,758
What the fuck's going on?
Rodriguez's hole just got nailed, man!

983
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,758
Here it is, man. We got gooks
in the fucking perimeter!

984
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,677
Shit, that's it!

985
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:26,237
Anything behind you don't identify
itself, fucking blow it away, OK?

986
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:30,751
Fuck! Two! Air strikes coming in -
they'll be laying snake and nape.

987
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:35,476
Don't get outta your fucking holes.
Stay right here, man. Fuck!

988
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:44,559
They're probing. They'll search this
line all night trying to get through.

989
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,911
All right, stay here, stay cool.
I'll be right back.

990
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,599
Who is it?

991
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:12,636
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

992
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,158
It's the ambush! Over here, man, hurry!

993
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,874
- Oh, shit!
- Water!

994
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,276
They're all over the place!
Hundreds of 'em - moving this way!

995
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:35,396
They wiped us out, man! We didn't
have a chance! Where's the CP?

996
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,670
- Back there!
- You guys get outta here!

997
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,634
They're right on my ass!
They ain't stopping for shit!

998
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,512
Taylor, man, let's di-di.

999
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,317
You go.

1000
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,156
There!

1001
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,436
No, hold it, hold it!

1002
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,629
Out of the hole! Fast!

1003
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,633
Get outta the fucking hole!
They're gonna blow it!

1004
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,320
Let's go, let's go!

1005
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:01,034
Francis, move your fucking ass!
They're gonna...

1006
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,878
Follow me.

1007
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,038
What is it?

1008
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,470
Die, you motherfuckers!

1009
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,396
It's fucking beautiful!

1010
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,516
Come on, motherfuckers!

1011
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,870
Come on! You can do better than that!

1012
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,878
They just keep coming, man!
Fuck this shit!

1013
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,040
Get back here, you gutless shit!

1014
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,070
- Get me Bravo!
- Charlie Company reports hand-to-hand.

1015
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,230
Three holes down. They need help.

1016
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,749
OK, get two squads from Alpha
down there! Go!

1017
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,836
Where's that goddamn air strike?

1018
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:31,638
Hey, you people!
Where the fuck are you going?

1019
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,234
Sir!

1020
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:53,439
- Can't you get anybody?!
- Negative contact! I can't raise Barnes!

1021
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:55,516
- Nothing!
- Get me Six!

1022
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,313
- Bravo Six, Bravo Six!
- It's Doc!

1023
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,193
- Get him in!
- Come on!

1024
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:06,314
They're coming through our line!
I can't do anything!

1025
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,591
- Where's Barnes?
- Dead! I think they're all dead!

1026
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,951
- Give it up, Doc! He's dead!
- Six, LT! Six!

1027
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,629
Captain, we've been overrun!
We're pulling back! Over!

1028
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,513
Goddamn it!
Where are you gonna pull back to?

1029
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,631
They're all over the perimeter!

1030
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:25,309
You be advised, you will hold
in place and you will fight!

1031
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,238
That means you, Lieutenant!
Bravo Six out.

1032
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:59,640
Be advised,
we got zips in the wire down here.

1033
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,479
<i>Roger your last, Bravo Six.
Can't run it any closer.</i>

1034
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,672
<i>We're hot to trot and packing snake
and nape, but we're bingo on fuel.</i>

1035
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:11,031
For the record, it's my call! Dump
everything you've got left on my pos!

1036
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:15,159
I say again, expend all remaining
in my perimeter!

1037
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,718
It's a lovely fucking war. Bravo Six out.

1038
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:24,030
<i>Roger your last, Bravo Six.
We copy. It's your call.</i>

1039
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:27,152
<i>Get 'em in their holes down there.
Hang tough, Bravo Six.</i>

1040
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,555
<i>We are coming cocked for treetops.</i>

1041
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:53,994
Barnes!

1042
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,272
Barnes!

1043
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:02,753
No!

1044
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:48,196
Get me a medic.

1045
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:51,996
Go on, boy!

1046
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,838
Do it.

1047
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:44,036
Look out, Mad Dog!
We got live gooks at three o'clock!

1048
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:46,549
What's down here? Let's go!

1049
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:51,591
Come on, Elmo!
Move your flea-bitten ass!

1050
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,396
Hey... you OK?

1051
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:00,277
You all right? Can you walk? Huh?

1052
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,997
Hey, Doc!
We need a medic up here!

1053
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:07,752
- Come on, Elmo.
- Come on, Doc! We got wounded here!

1054
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:28,713
Hey, that must've been
some fucking fight.

1055
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,436
You alone here, man?

1056
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,514
Yeah.

1057
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:36,791
The bunch of fucking faggots,
they all left me!

1058
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:27,232
122 wounded and still counting.

1059
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:30,557
Estimate 500 Victor Charlie KIA.

1060
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:33,035
122 and still counting. Over.

1061
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,309
Hey, Taylor!

1062
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,230
- Hey, Francis.
- Hey, man, how you doing?

1063
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:46,078
<i>I'm OK. How are you doing?</i>

1064
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,156
Just fine, man! Hey, dig it!

1065
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:50,919
We two-timers, man.
We gonna get outta here, boy!

1066
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:54,749
I'm gonna see you in the hospital.
We gonna get high, high! Yes, sir!

1067
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,836
Sergeant O'Neill!

1068
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,830
- How are you doing?
- Just fine, sir.

1069
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:02,110
That's good, cos you got second platoon.

1070
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,152
Yes, sir.

1071
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,991
- Ready?
- You bet.

1072
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:45,070
<i>I think now, looking back,</i>

1073
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:48,909
<i>we did not fight the enemy,
we fought ourselves,</i>

1074
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:51,873
<i>and the enemy... was in us.</i>

1075
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,510
<i>The war is over for me now,</i>

1076
01:49:55,720 --> 01:50:00,316
<i>but it will always be there,
for the rest of my days,</i>

1077
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:02,158
<i>as I'm sure Elias will be,</i>

1078
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:05,590
<i>fighting with Barnes for what Rhah
called possession of my soul.</i>

1079
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,516
<i>There are times since</i>

1080
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:12,996
<i>I've felt like the child
born of those two fathers.</i>

1081
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:19,475
<i>But be that as it may,
those of us who did make it</i>

1082
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,592
<i>have an obligation to build again,</i>

1083
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,280
<i>to teach to others what we know,</i>

1084
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:28,633
<i>and to try with what's left of our lives</i>

1085
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:32,116
<i>to find a goodness,
and meaning, to this life.</i>

1086
01:50:50,005 --> 01:50:56,005
<i>Hope You Enjoyed! :)
