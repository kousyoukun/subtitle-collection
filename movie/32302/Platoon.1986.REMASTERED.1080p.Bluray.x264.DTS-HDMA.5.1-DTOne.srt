00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,650
365天
365 and a wake-up. Oh, lord.

7
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,630
1967年9月B连第25队步兵

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,630
在柬埔寨边境附近

9
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,610
下面小心
Watch it below!

10
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,310
莫尔豪 走快点
Morehouse, drop back to slack.

11
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,350
查理 谁在队尾
Who's on tail-end Charlie?

12
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,260
总部 这是六队 位置如下…
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six. Pos rep follows.;

13
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,600
L A W A F…
Lemur, Alpha, Whiskey, Alpha, Foxtrot....

14
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,270
华伦 你去队侧
Warren, you get out on flank.

15
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,410
霍梅斯特 什么事
-Hey, Hoffmeister! -Yo?

16
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,680
你有香烟吗
You got a smoke?

17
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,920
没有 没关系
-No, man, I don't. -Sin loi, man.

18
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,210
B26 为何延迟了
Bravo 2-6. What's the delay on point?

19
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,920
又找不到路了吗
Having compass trouble again?

20
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,650
继续走
Get a move on, boy.

21
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,510
你还在等什么
Boy, what you waiting for?

22
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,220
他不会咬你
He ain't gonna bite you.

23
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,590
那是越南兵 死了
That's a good gook. Good and dead.

24
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,590
新兵 新兵
-Cherry. -Yo, cherry!

25
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,620
行动 第六队说我们挡住了他们 完毕
Move it out. Six says we're jamming them up back there. Over.

26
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,560
叫他去见鬼吧
Tell that dipshit to get fucked.

27
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,600
这是第25队 听好 我们很快便出发 完毕
This is 2-5. Be advised. We're moving out shortly. Out.

28
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,170
泰勒 你怎么了
What's the matter with you, Taylor?

29
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,500
你是个大混蛋
You are one simple son of a bitch.

30
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,140
中士 对不起
I'm sorry, sergeant.

31
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,840
叫另外那个新兵过来 嘉勒 还有军医
Get that other cherry up here. Gardner. And the doc.

32
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,040
嘉勒 军医 上前来
Gardner, doc, up!

33
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,870
嘉勒 军医 上前来
Gardner, doc, to the front!

34
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,980
嘉勒 快过来 你他妈的
Gardner, get your ass up the hill, you fat fuck!

35
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,350
大胖子 快点
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

36
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,900
你有没有事 蚂蚁
-You all right? -Ants.

37
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,300
我脖子全都是蚂蚁
I got ants all over my neck.

38
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,250
这些是红蚂蚁
You got some red ants.

39
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,240
红蚂蚁是杀手 黑蚂蚁最可怕
Reds are killers. Black ants are the worse.

40
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,120
快点 混球
Hurry up, lard-ass!

41
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:44,980
我很累
I'm so tired!

42
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,820
只喝一点
Just a little.

43
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,290
不要喝太多 你不要再喝了
Don't drink too much. I don't want you drinking any more.

44
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,800
我不想你抽搐
I don't want you cramping up.

45
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,470
你带着太多东西
You're humping too much stuff.

46
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,770
有一半是不需要的
You don't need half this shit.

47
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,970
我帮你拿
I'll haul it for you.

48
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,180
但请你下次先向我请示
But next time check with me first, all right?

49
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,540
谢谢你 中士
Thanks, sarge.

50
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,380
你有没有事吧 没事
-Are you okay? -Yeah.

51
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,560
这是总部 有直升机接近你们
2-2, this is six. I understand you have a bird inbound at your pos.

52
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,740
总部 请留意
Bravo Six, be advised.

53
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,020
军资直升机正驶来
Resupply helo is inbound at this time. Over.

54
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,910
快点搬军火下来
Go, you people! Get that ammo off now!

55
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,030
这个字不是这样写的
It ain't D-E-R-E. It's D-E-A-R.

56
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,140
而且莎拉也不是那样写的 笨蛋
And Sarah ain't got no two R's, King. Damn, you dumb!

57
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,570
没关系 她会明白我的意思
Don't matter. She know what I mean.

58
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,040
她也不大认识字
She don't read too good nohow.

59
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,880
你看 又是猪肉
Look at this shit! Pork again!

60
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,890
我跟你换你的火鸡 我不能再吃这玩意了
Trade me that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man. I can't eat this shit.

61
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,560
你抽了什么
What you been smoking?

62
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,460
希望你不用洗衣服 你要运动一下
I hope you don't get that laundry gig. Your ass need to hump, hump.

63
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,200
白小子 你在等什么
Hey, white boy! What you waiting for?

64
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,490
那个洞不会自己出现的
That hole won't dig itself.

65
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,200
快点挖
Come on. Get your dick skin on that thing!

66
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,840
时间无多 快点挖…
You ain't got all day! Dig, dig!

67
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,400
有人写过 地狱是不可理喻的
Somebody once wrote, ""Hell is the impossibility of reason. ""

68
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,550
这个地方就像地狱
That"s what this place feels like.; hell.

69
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,010
我只是来了一周 但已经讨厌这里
I hate it already, and it"s only been a week.

70
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,650
祖母 这一周很痛苦
Some goddamn week, Grandma.

71
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,420
最辛苦的事 就是这星期站岗三次
The hardest thing I"ve ever done is go on point three times this week.

72
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,350
我不知道我在做什么
I don"t know what I"m doing.

73
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,030
我连越共在我面前出现也不知道
A gook could be right in front of me and I wouldn"t know it.

74
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,930
我实在很累
I"m so tired.

75
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,470
我们早上五点起床…
We get up at 5.;00 a.m...

76
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,540
整天走动 四五点钟扎营 挖壕沟 进食…
...hump all day, camp around 4 or 5, dig a foxhole, eat...

77
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,440
然后整晚埋伏 或是当哨兵
... then put out an all-night ambush or a listening post.

78
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,380
我是新来的 没有人教我任何事
Nobody tells me how to do anything because I"m new.

79
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,940
没人理会新兵 他们连你的名字也不想知道
Nobody cares about the new guys. They don"t want to know your name.

80
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,850
新兵的生命不重要 因他没有经验
A new guy"s life isn"t worth much because he hasn"t put his time in yet.

81
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,790
若在越南战死 最好在最初几周
If you"re gonna get killed in Nam, it"s better to get it in the first weeks.

82
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,860
原因是你不会受太多苦
The logic being, you don"t suffer that much.

83
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,230
如果幸运 留在外围防线…
If you"re lucky, you stay in the perimeter...

84
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,770
守卫时能够睡三至四小时
... then pull a guard shift, so you sleep three or four hours.

85
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,370
但你不能真的入睡
But you don"t really sleep.

86
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,880
我认为我撑不到一年
I don"t think I can keep this up for a year.

87
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,690
我不应该来这里
I"ve made a big mistake coming here.

88
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,950
我们有很多活动
We got beaucoup movement.

89
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,430
第三部队在15公里外被袭击
3rd Battalion got hit 1 5 klicks north of here.

90
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,760
越共在树上挂上地雷
Charlie had claymores strung in the trees.

91
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,130
整排军队被炸 真倒霉
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit.

92
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,610
两个中尉和一个上尉被炸死
Got two lieutenants and a captain.

93
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,140
我的天
Jesus.

94
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,220
你想谁去埋伏
All right, who do you want on ambush?

95
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,420
伊利亚 你带你的小队出去
Elias, you take your squad out.

96
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,720
华伦 留下 我需要德斯和乔利亚
Warren, stay in, but I need Tex and Junior from your squad.

97
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,760
收到
Roger.

98
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,260
调动到20M的位置
Move out in 2-0 mikes.

99
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,540
我以为今晚轮到奥尼尔
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

100
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,300
特斯和莫尔豪经验不足
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

101
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,910
丰山明天放假 还要他们去吗
Fu Sheng is going on R and R tomorrow. You want to send them out on ambush?

102
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,010
你要带新兵去
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

103
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,710
他们什么都不懂 可能会遇到事情 仔细想想
They don't know shit and we'll probably run into something. Think about it.

104
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,950
太好了 你想我怎样做
Great. What do you want me to do?

105
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,480
你想我为了一个混蛋要好好睡觉 而让手下被杀吗
Get one of my guys zapped so a lame ass can get his beauty sleep?

106
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,790
奥尼尔…
Hey, O'Neill...

107
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,490
别再罗嗦
...take a break.

108
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,060
你不用每天都这么讨厌
You needn't be a prick every day.

109
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,990
伊利亚 叫手下准备好
Elias, get your men ready.

110
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,200
他来了三年 以为自己是耶稣
Guy's in 3 years, thinks he's Jesus Christ.

111
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,660
奥尼尔 他们留下 但你要去
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out.

112
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,770
我需要有经验的老兵
I need veterans out there.

113
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,700
巴恩中士
Sergeant Barnes?

114
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,080
在他们面前应该由我下命令
I think in front of the men, I need to give the orders.

115
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,290
是 长官
Yes, sir.

116
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,630
看来会下雨
Shit, looks like rain.

117
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,370
我们整晚都要在雨中了
It's gonna piss on us all night.

118
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,840
会令你脸烂掉
It'll put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours.

119
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,710
你为那个白人而冒险
Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man.

120
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,410
这里是没有公义的
No justice around here.

121
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,340
奥尼尔又触怒中尉了吗
What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

122
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,580
为什么总是我们负责埋伏呢
Why do we always get fucking ambush?

123
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,750
这是因为他们在玩政治
Because it's politics, man. Politics.

124
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,850
我有否给你看过露丝的照片 没有
-Did I show you a picture of Lucy Jean? -No, you didn't.

125
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,090
她会是我的另一半
She's the one for me all right, that Lucy Jean.

126
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,020
她也在等我
She's waiting for me too.

127
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,860
她很漂亮 你很幸福
She's real pretty. You're a Iucky guy, Gardner.

128
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,140
你有你女朋友的照片吗
You got a picture of your girl?

129
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,740
那我们有一个被 留在家乡的可怜女孩 不是吗
That leaves some unIucky girl back home, don't it?

130
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,870
插进去
Tuck this in.

131
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,580
装进去
Shit-can this.

132
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,450
不需要这个 转身
Don't need this. Turn around.

133
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,980
来吧
Come on.

134
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,620
德斯 跟乔利亚和泰勒一队
Tex! You got Junior and Taylor here on your position.

135
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,520
伊利亚 不要乱来

为国家效力

It"s weird. They"re the bottom of the barrel, and they know it.

163
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,370
所以他们自称平凡人
Maybe that"s why they call themselves grunts.

164
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,900
因为平凡人什么都能承受
Because a grunt can take it, can take anything.

Maybe I can see something I don"t yet see, learn something I don"t yet know.

00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,990
冲浪一定会很好玩
The surfing's gonna be good.

271
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,500
三月在田纳西州
March, man, in Tennessee.

272
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:30,200
可以闻到松树的气味 可以在河边闻到女人的气味
Sniff the pines. Sniff that pussy down by the river.

273
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,130
真棒
Hot damn!

274
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,630
泰勒 你还有多少天
Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?

275
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,580
三百什么 三十二
-Three hundred and what? -Thirty-two.

276
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,310
332天
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

277
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,480
傻小子
Sin loi, my boy.

278
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,480
我不记得那个日子了
I can't even remember when I was 332, man.

279
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,120
你要向前数 好像你已来了40天
You gotta count backwards or something, like you got 40 days in.

280
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,420
想的乐观些
Think positive, dude.

281
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,660
你怎么会来这里 你看来受过教育
How in the fuck did you get here anyway? You look educated.

282
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,270
我自愿来的 什么
-I volunteered for it. -You did what?

283
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,560
我自愿来的
I volunteered.

284
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,470
我退出大学 想加入越战
I dropped out of college and told them I wanted infantry, combat, Vietnam.

285
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,510
卧槽你居然是自愿来的
You volunteered for this shit, man?

286
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,440
你能相信吗
Can you believe that?

287
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,680
你放弃念大学实在太疯狂
You is a crazy fucker, giving up college.

288
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,620
我在大学什么都学不到
It didn't make much sense. I wasn't learning anything.

289
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:26,360
为什么穷人就要去打仗 有钱人就不用
Why should the poor kids go to war and the rich kids get away with it?

290
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,690
他是个斗士
What we got here is a crusader.

291
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,460
看来是了 可恶
-Sounds like it. -Shit.

292
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,470
你一定是很富有才会那样想
You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that.

293
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,340
大家都知道…
Everybody knows...

294
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,740
穷人总是被有钱人欺负
...the poor's always fucked over by the rich.

295
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,710
那是不能改变的事实
Always have, always will.

296
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,390
如果你上道 我会介绍一些大头给你认识
If you be cool, I'll introduce you to some of the heads.

297
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,160
什么样的大头
What are the heads?

298
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,290
晚一点吧
Later, man.

299
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,670
怎么了
What's up, brother?

300
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,470
大人驾到 发生什么事
Your Highness has arrived. What's happening?

301
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,140
我以为你在柬埔寨
I thought you was hanging ten in Cambodia.

302
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,790
你为什么在这里
Why are you in the underworld?

303
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,790
这个不是泰勒 泰勒中枪了 是柯里斯 他被救活了
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This is Chris. He been resurrected.

304
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,030
泰勒 你残废吗
You lame, Taylor?

305
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,170
你是残废的吗
Are you lame or something?

306
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,970
继续吧 抽一口吧
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

307
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,060
抽一口享受一下吧
Your shit's in the wind, troop.

308
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,890
你好吗
Hey, man. What's happening?

309
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,460
不是那样叫的
If you do that ''baa,'' you do it right.

310
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,900
你很古怪
You're weird, man.

311
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,410
你是个孩子 我不会 在你身上浪费时间
You're a child. I don't waste time on you.

312
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,590
第一次吗 是
-First time? -Yeah.

313
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,100
那么你一定会上瘾
Then the worm has definitely turned for you, man.

314
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,330
感觉好吗
Feel good?

315
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,430
对 感觉很好 我的脖子不痛了
Yeah, it feels good. I got no pain in my neck now.

316
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,870
感觉很好已足够
Feeling good's good enough.

317
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,710
放入口里
Put your mouth on this.

318
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,210
大家在哪里
Where the hell is everybody, man?

319
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:34,310
大家都正在享受 一群毒虫 他们觉得他们很特别
They're getting high. Bunch of hopheads. They think they're special.

320
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,780
你听 很糟的演奏
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

321
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,510
烦透的噪音 就是那样
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

322
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,090
和你一样那么烦
Make about as much sense as you do.

323
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,550
他们都在埋怨…
All them chucks be rapping about how they losing their ho...

324
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,630
埋怨自己没有钱
...saying how they ain't got no bread for beer.

325
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,860
去他的 给我黑人音乐 开始吧
Fuck that honky shit! Gotta get me some Motown jams, dig it?

326
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,830
你干嘛那样说
What are you talking that shit for?

327
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,010
乔利亚 你吸食过毒品吗
Junior, you ever smoke any shit?

328
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,240
对
That's right.

329
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:07,140
你们想用毒品荼毒黑人
You trying to keep the black man down and string him out on that shit.

330
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,010
但黑人很快就会推翻你们
But the time's coming when the black man will throw that yoke off.

331
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,120
很简单 释放你的心灵就行 你的身体就会跟随
Simple. Free your mind, your ass will follow.

332
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,460
明白 你吸那东西 一切会变得离奇
Yeah, I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit and everything gets weird.

333
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,760
越南人在草丛散布化学毒药
You hear about gooks putting chemicals in the grass...

334
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,500
令我们不再打仗 变成反战者吧
...so we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

335
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,770
不用担心 你怎样都是个杀手
But don't you worry, Bunny, you's a killer anyway.

336
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,660
但我仍然喜欢女人
But I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

337
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,070
除了赛车 没东西比得上女人
Nothing like a piece of pussy, except maybe the Indy 500.

338
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,010
只有女人死了遗留她的身体 给你
Only way you get pussy is if the bitch dies and wills it to you...

339
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,470
你或许才会有
...and then maybe.

340
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,550

这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

353
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,820
他被奥尼尔勒着
He's in the O'Neill death grip.

354
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,760
他不知道要害怕还是瞎了较好
He doesn't know whether to shit or go blind.

355
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,360
中尉 你认为怎么样 你好吗 里德
-What do you say, L.T.? -How you doing, Red?

356
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,640

满堂红
Full house.

358

你还不错
You're doing all right.

359
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,830
对 我还没开始作弊呢
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

360
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,910
中尉 要喝酒吗 谢谢
-Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage? -Oh, thanks, Andy.

361
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,510
中尉 你想玩吗
Play, lieutenant?

362
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,650
不 我不想被你们操了
No. Wouldn't want to get raped by you guys.

363
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,820
为什么 你留着为了谁
Why's that, lieutenant? What are you saving up to be?

364
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,060
犹太人么
Jewish?

365
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,190

That is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

368
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,380
你认为呢 鲍布 他能挨过这场仗吗
What do you say there, Bob? A guy like that make it? Yes or no?

369
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,610
我也是那样想
I have to say that's precisely what I saw.

370
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,290
我只用看一看他就知道了
Sometimes I just look at a guy, and I know he's not going to make it.

371
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,390
他一定不行
Just no fucking way.

372

他们快来了
They're coming.

409
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,700
下面的村庄有北越军的踪影
NVA were seen at a village half a klick down the river.

410
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,740
六队说我们要立即赶去

414

曼尼在哪里
Hey, where's Manny?

415
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,320
曼尼 你在哪里
Manny, where you at?

416
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,620
我们要在入黑前到达村庄

417
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,080
伊利亚等人继续找寻 和等候工程师

但最后金找到他
But it was King who found him...

420
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,210
他在下游一千码那里
...about 1 000 yards downriver, not far from the village.

421
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,830
谜团被解开了
It was the end of the mystery.

422
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,760
混蛋
The motherfuckers.

423
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,610
那个千年村的村民不知道我们会来
The village, which was maybe 1 000 years old, didn"t know we were coming.

424
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,810
否则他们早就逃走
If they had, they would have run.

425
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:34,320
巴恩是众矢之的 阿合上尉会经过他
Barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him, our Captain Ahab...

426
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,350
改善事情
...who would set things right again.

427
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,850
那一天我们都很敬爱他
That day, we loved him.

428
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,790

There he goes, sarge.

429
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:55,140

431
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,370

Get that stupid look off your face!

432
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,210
奥尼尔 清除房子
O'Neill, clear out these hooches.

433
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,890
小猪
Hey, piggy-piggy. Hey, pig.

434

Get back!

446
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,270
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

447
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,440
住口
Shut up!

448

冷静下来 他们很害怕
Be cool! Be cool! They're scared, man!

453
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,100
他们害怕吗 我又怎样呢
Oh, they're scared, huh? What about me, man?

454
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,070

Watch this fucker!

456
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,040
他们认为我们为谁而战
Who the fuck do they think we're fighting for?

457
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,650
还有一个 你…
-You got one more! -Hey, hey!

458

They got two, four....

461
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:25,800
他们有足够米粮供应一队军队
Barnes, they got enough rice here to feed a whole fucking regiment.

462
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,440
华伦 带村长来
Sergeant Warren, you bring the honcho over here.

463

特斯 出来 乔利亚 烧掉房子
Tubbs, get out of there! Junior, burn it!

464

What the fuck's the matter? I wasn't gonna hurt you!

465
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,110
我看来想伤害你吗
Look like I was gonna hurt you?

466
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,950
你为什么不听我说 你为什么不他妈的听我说
Why didn't you listen to me?! Why didn't you fucking listen to me?!

478
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:34,800
他妈的 他在嘲笑你
Fucking pussy, man! He's laughing at you!

479
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,600
越南人是那样笑的
That's the way the gook laughs.

480
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,480
当然了
Yeah, sure you are!

481
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,770
你很后悔吧
You're real sorry, ain't you?

482
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:46,140
你为曼尼他们的死感到内疚吧
You're just crying your little hearts out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

483
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,220
宾尼 算了吧 我们走
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

What do you say?

485
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,670
妈的 你看到他的头颅 是怎样爆开吗
Holy shit! You see that fucking head come apart, man?

486
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,510
我从来没见过那样的脑袋
I never seen brains like that before, man.

487
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:26,020
我打赌一定是她指挥一切的
I bet you the old bitch runs the whole fucking show.

488
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:30,560
大概是她割开曼尼的喉咙 她一定也想把我的睾丸割掉
She probably cut Manny's throat. Probably cut my balls off if she could.

489
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,030
宾尼 离开吧 没有人看到什么
Bunny, we leave now, nobody saw a thing!

490
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,860
泰勒 你明白吗
You understand, Taylor?

491
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,070
杀死她吧 杀死整条村的人
Come on, let's fucking do her! Let's do the whole fucking village!

492
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,710
这个越南人头目脸上有些疤痕
There's scars on this gook honcho, sarge.

493
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,200
特斯 出来
Get out of here, Tubbs.

494
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,650
他从哪里弄到伤痕
Where did he get these wounds?

495
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:06,760
他说他在轰炸中受伤 他一定是北越的人
-Says he was hit in a bombing raid. -He's a dink for sure.

496
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,530
问他这里为什么会有武器
Ask him why these weapons are here.

497
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,780
他们没有选择 北越杀了抗命的老头目
They had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.

498
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:22,670
他说那些米是属于他们 莱纳 胡说
-He says all the rice is theirs. -Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

499
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,010
我们在河边杀死的越军是谁
Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?

500
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,530
他不知道 北越军几个月没来过
He doesn't know. The NVA ain't been here in a couple of months.

501
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,770
或许他是哨兵 当然了
-Maybe he was a scout. -Yeah, sure. A scout.

502
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,200
那些米和武器是给谁的
What about the rice and the weapons?! Who they for?!

503
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,660
北越军
An NVC!

504
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,630
他知道我在说什么吧
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying. Don't you?

505
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,100
他一定知道
Goddamn right he does.

506
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,340
他在说谎
He's lying!

507
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,380
杀死他 看谁会说真话
Waste the fucker! Then see who talks.

508
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,940
他说他什么都不知道
Look, he says he doesn't know anything.

509
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,890
他讨厌北越但他们擅自来这里
He hates the NVA, but they come when they want and take over.

510
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,490
她在说什么
What's the bitch saying?

511
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,820
她问我们为什么要杀死猪只
She's going on about why we killed the pigs...

512
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,830
他们是农夫 要养活自己
...they're farmers, they have to make a living....

513
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,040
住口
Shut up!

514
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,380
叫她住口
Shut her the fuck up!

515
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,230
你叫他快点说 否则我会杀死更多人
You tell him to start talking or I'll waste more of them.

516
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,380
莱纳 告诉他
Tell him, Lerner!

517
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,840
让我们大开杀戒
Let us in on this, all right?

518
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,160
我们杀死整条村吧
Let's go for it! Let's do the whole fucking village!

519
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,490
中士 我们还在等什么
Come on, sarge. What the fuck are we waiting for?

520
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,030
杀死他们 走开
-Let's do them! -Out of my way!

521
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,670
这是他的女儿吧
This is his daughter, right? Right?

522
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,880
你说谎 不 你说谎 你这个越共
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

523
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:51,760
巴恩
Barnes!

524
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,470
你在他妈的做什么
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

525
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,770
别管闲事 这和你无关
Stay out of this. It ain't your show.

526
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,150
你不是火枪队 猪哥
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

527
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,220
打倒他 巴恩 加油
-Get him! -Come on, Barnes!

528
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:20,720
打倒他… 打烂他的头
Get him! Get him! Tear his fucking head off!

529
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,200
伊利亚 杀死他
Come on, Elias. Send him to hell!

530
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,500

534
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,150
伊利亚 你死定了 我发誓 你死定了
You're dead, Elias! I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

535
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,550
你会坐牢的
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

536
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:56,690
这件事不会就此罢休的 混蛋
This shit won't wash, you puke!

537
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,190

00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,270
上尉说烧掉这里 听到了吗
Captain says to torch this place, hear that?

540
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,900
烧掉这里
Torch this place!

541
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,540
烧掉武器
Blow the weapons in place!

542
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,880
集合他们 我们时间不多
Round up suspected VC and shake it up! We ain't got much light left!

543
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,310
中尉 你为什么不作出行动
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?

544
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,210
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

545
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,950
你知道我在说什么
You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

546
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:26,520
不 我不知道 我不知道你他妈的在说什么
No, I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.

547
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,920
快点出发 快 听到命令了吧
Move it out! Let's go! You heard the lieutenant!

548
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:38,470
泰勒 走了 妈的 烧掉武器 然后离开
Taylor, let's go, for chrissake! Police up the weapons and let's go!

549
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,000
哈洛 来吧
Come on, Harold.

550
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,440
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

551
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,380
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

552
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,700
来吧
Hey, come on.

553
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,330
妈的 滚开
You fucker! Get out of here!

554
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:22,340
滚开…不要那样做
Get the fuck off! Don't do it! Don't do it!

555
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,770
混蛋 这是什么一回事
You fucker! What is this, huh?!

556
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:31,340
你是同志吗
You a homosexual?

557
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:34,120
你怎么了 她是越南人
What's your problem? She's a fucking dink.

558
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:38,120
她是人类 去你的
She's a fucking human being, man! Fuck you!

559
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,480
泰勒 你这个可恶的新兵
Total fucking cherry, Taylor!

560
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,290
妈的禽兽 你们全部都是禽兽
Fucking animal! All of you! You're fucking animals!

561
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,460
混蛋
Fucking lame fuck!

562
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,400
你不属于越南 这里不适合你
You don't belong in the Nam. This ain't your place.

563
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,930
你们一点都不明白吧
You don't fucking get it, do you?

564
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,140
你们不明白
You just don't fucking get it.

565
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,540
没事的
It's okay.

566
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,280
离开吧
Get out of there!

567
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,480
出发吧
Police up your dicks and let's go.

568
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,610
我什么都看不见 我看到
-I didn't see anything, sir. -I did.

569
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:11,410
巴恩中士说那个是北越兵
Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.

570
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,380
我的报告中 沃夫上尉是目击证人
My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

571
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,150
伊利亚 好
All right, Elias.

572
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,460
巴恩中士 是
-Staff Sergeant Barnes. -Sir!

573
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:23,790
我们回到总部后我要详细报告
I want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

574
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:28,160
你有日志 我有很多目击证人
You got a diary. I have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

575
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,730
不是现在
Not now, goddamn it! Not now!

576
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,060
我们回到总部才调查这件事
We'll get into this at the base camp.

577
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:37,670
我保证如果发现非法杀戮…
I can promise you, if I find out there was an illegal killing...

578
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,670
一定会有军事法庭
...there will be a court-martial.

579
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:45,140
现在我要全军作战 你们别再吵
Right now, I need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

580
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,540
巴恩和伊利亚中士 听到吗
Staff Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Elias. You hear me?

581
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,790
是 知道
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

582
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:54,290
明天你们从东面再去那越共地堡
We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

583
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,220
你们休息一下 晚上七点钟回来开会
You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 1 900 for a briefing.

584
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,760
是 是
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

585
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:10,610
你认为他们会在乎我们吗
Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

586
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,980
哈洛 也许会是你阻碍了巴恩
It could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

587
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,350
那个宾尼呢
And that Bunny?

588
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,880
他是个疯子
That motherfucker's crazy.

589
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:20,650
他令我不寒而栗
I mean, he scares me.

590
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,980
他很可怕
He just scares me.

591
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,380
你已经受牵连
You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

592
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,550
这些越南人比你想像中聪明
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.

593
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,830
巴恩知道他在做什么
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

594
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,930
他们是北越兵
They was NVA, every last of them.

595
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:38,630
他带领我们走到这里了 他会带领我们走完这场战争
He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.

596
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:39,910
我不知道
I don't know, Holmes.

597
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:44,140
基督教徒不会到处杀人
A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

598
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:48,240
情况失去控制了 完全失控了
This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

599
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,510
看来你不知道怎样分别…
Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

600
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,180
事情的轻重
...the way you always shoot up that shit.

601
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,640
我不知道…
I don't know, brothers...

602
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,720
但我内心大受伤害
...but I'm hurting real bad inside.

603
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,520
别担心 伊利亚不能证明什么
Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

604
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:07,790
他是个麻烦制造者
He's a troublemaker.

605
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:11,700
伊利亚像华盛顿的政客…
Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

606
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:15,670
想独力打这场仗
...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

607
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,010
这里没有时间进行审讯
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

608
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,270
中士 谢谢你
-Sarge. -Thanks, Bun.

609
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,710
情况怎么样
How did it go there, Bob?

610
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,080
那个可恶的伊利亚
Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

611
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,380
他是个卑鄙小人
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

612
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,560
他会连累这个连的所有人
He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

613
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,130
有人要教训他
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

614
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:43,960
你认为呢 会有调查吗
So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

615
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,500
鲍布
Bob?

616
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:51,810
你太担心了 中士会解决他
O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

617
01:01:58,290 --> 01:01:59,680
今晚天色很美
It's a beautiful night.

618
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:02,850
我喜欢这里的夜晚
Yeah, I love this place at night.

619
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:04,760
繁星…
The stars....

620
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,450
它们没有对与错 它们就是在那里
There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

621
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,270
你的比喻很好
That's a nice way of putting it.

622
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,930
巴恩憎恨你吧
Barnes has it in for you, huh?

623
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,140
巴恩相信他所做的一切
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

624
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:27,940
你呢 你相信吗
And you? Do you believe?

625
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,810
1965年时吗 我会相信
In '65? Yeah.

626
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:36,920
现在呢
Now?

627
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:40,720
不相信
No.

628
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:46,790
今天所发生的事只是开始
What happened today is just the beginning.

629
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,130
我们会输掉这场仗
We're gonna lose this war.

630
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,430
不会吧
Come on.

631
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,330
你真的认为我们会输
You really think so? Us?

632
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,000
我们欺负别人太久了
We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...

633
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,580
现在轮到我们被打击
...I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

634
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,620
我每天都在挣扎
Day by day, I struggle to maintain...

635
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,520
我努力维持体力和意志
...not only my strength, but my sanity.

636
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,420
一切都很模糊
It"s all a blur.

637
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:21,630
我没有气力写信
I have no energy to write.

638
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:24,540
我不能分辨对与错
I don"t know what"s right or wrong anymore.

639
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,760
我们的士气低落 出现内讧
The morale of the men is low. A civil war in the platoon.

640
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:31,530
一半支持伊利亚 一半支持巴恩
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.

641
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,600
有很多猜忌和憎恨
There"s a lot of suspicion and hate.

642
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,670
我们竟然在自相残杀
I can"t believe we"re fighting each other instead of them.

643
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,400
数着日子和留意着周围 没别的
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face. Not much else.

644
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,040
祖母 希望你一切安好
Hope things are well, Grandma.

645
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,220
告诉妈妈和爸爸…
Tell Mom and Dad I--

646
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,020
你知道告诉他们什么的 柯里斯上
Well, just tell them. Chris.

647
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,950
我知道你以为会被派去洗衣服
Hey, big boy. I know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out.

648
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:23,650
我要把自己涂白 才能得到那些工作
Hell, I gotta paint myself white just to get one of those jobs.

649
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,950
我递了申请去割包皮 我要离开
Got my request in for a circumcision. I'm getting my big ass out of here.

650
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,220
你会成为犹太教教士吗
What are you gonna do, become a rabbi?

651
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,550
水蛭
Leech.

652
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,600
继续走
All right! Move it out!

653
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:44,800
不要喝 你会得痢疾的
Don't drink that, asshole. You're gonna get malaria.

654
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,640
我希望会
Yeah, I hope so.

655
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,800
去吧
Let's go.

656
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,850
军医 莱纳被击中
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

657
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,360
中士 华伦被击中
Sergeant, Warren's hit!

658
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,430

-What's going on? -They got RPGs, man!

659
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,430
他们已在这里埋伏了很久
It's an ambush! They were just waiting for us here!

660
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,730
谁负责防守 莱纳和华伦
-Who's on point? -Lerner and Warren.

661
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,560
你去哪里
Where are you going?!

662
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:57,210
天啊 混球 派火力上前
Goddamn it, you assholes! Get some firepower up there!

663
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,410
对
Right!

664
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,690
小心 火箭
Watch out! Rockets!

665
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,730
莱纳在哪里
Where the fuck is Lerner?

666
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,600
他在木头那边
He's over there! By the log!

667
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:49,960
开火坐标649602
Fire mission. Grid: 6-4-9-4-0-2.

668
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,230
方向610
Direction: 6-1 -0--

669
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:54,930
调整发射 完毕
Adjust fire. Over.

670
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,040
中尉 他们会步步进逼
Lieutenant, they'll get in tight under the arty!

671
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,510
我看到缺口 让我带人去那边
I saw a cut. Let me take some men and roll up that flank.

672
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:08,940
叫巴恩去 我们已有四个人受伤 你要我怎么办

伊利亚 不要教我怎么打仗
You don't tell me how to run my war, Elias.

只要被他们攻破 我们便死定了
Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.

722
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,510

以防他们准备从外围进攻

725
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,020
第三连正在后面赶来
3rd Platoon is coming behind us. Watch for them.

727
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,900
不 我单独行事比较敏捷
No. I move faster alone.

728
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:02,900

What about Elias? If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

732
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:16,420

你击中两个混蛋
A lung, babe. You got two of them fuckers.

01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,490
他死了
He's dead?

756
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:06,570
对 他在一百米外
Yeah, he's back there about 1 00 meters.

757
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,630

They've got Elias!

764
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,310
什么
What?

765
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,220
退后…
Back down! Back down there!

766
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:50,700

Snake 1-9, Fly 4. There"s still one of the men down there.

767
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,000
停火…
Hold your arms. Guns, hold off.

768
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,200
他杀死他
He killed him.

769
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,930
我知道是他 我看到他的眼神
I know he did. I saw his eyes when he came in.

770
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:24,810
你怎么知道不是越兵 你没有证据
How do you know the dinks didn't get him? You got no proof.

771
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,450
证据就在他的眼神 我看得出
Proof's in the eyes. When you know, you know.

772
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,840
你也看见 我知道你在想什么
You saw. I know what you were thinking.

773
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,710
我们今天解决他
I say we frag him tonight.

774
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:34,010
我赞成 以牙还牙
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

775
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,120
让军事法庭处理吧
I say let military justice do the job on him.

776
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:41,990
去他的军事法庭 你在说笑吗
Come on, fuck the military justice! Are you joking me?

777
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:46,330
他们会相信谁 奥尼尔 宾尼 全是胡说
Whose story you think they'll believe? O'Neill's? Bunny's? Bullshit!

778
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:50,730
巴恩不会放过你的
You try that, Barnes will shove it back up your ass, with a candle on it.

779
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:52,740
你认为我们应该怎么做
What do you suggest we do?

780
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:58,070
你们小心 巴恩会一个个的解决他们
Watch your own asses. Barnes will be coming down on all of them.

781
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:01,580
你们忘记和伊利亚的美好日子吗
You gonna forget about Elias? All the good times we had here?

782
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:05,480
你想把头砍下来治头痛
Shit, you trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.

783
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:09,160
伊利亚没有叫你为他打仗
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him.

784
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:13,660
如果真的有天堂 天啊 我希望真的有
And if there's a heaven, and God, I hope there is...

785
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:18,660
他会在上面喝到大醉
...he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit...

786
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,640
因为他把痛苦留在这里
...because he left his pains down here.

787
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:25,200
你错了 总之巴恩是杀人凶手
You're wrong! Anyway you cut it, Barnes is a murderer!

788
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,480
对 泰勒…
-Right on. -Taylor...

789
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:33,020
你当初入伍时说很欣赏巴恩
...when you first came in here, you told me how you admired the bastard.

790
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:37,550
我错了 你做任何事都是错的
-I was wrong. -You've never been right about nothing!

791
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:41,050
你们这班混蛋 留心听着
Dig this, you assholes, and dig it good.

792
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,290
巴恩中枪七次都没有死去
Barnes been shot seven times, and he ain't dead.

793
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:47,500
那对你有意思吗
Does that mean anything to you?

794
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,230
巴恩是不会死的
Barnes ain't meant to die.

795
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:55,040
唯一能杀死他的是他自己
The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.

796
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:57,470
你们在谈死亡吗
Talking about killing?

797
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,640
你们是专家吗
You all experts?

798
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,820
你们都知道杀戮吗
You all know about killing?

799
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:19,920
我想听听 猪头
Well, I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

800
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,100
你们抽这个来逃避现实
You smoke this shit to escape from reality?

801
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:34,880
我不需要这个
Me, I don't need this shit.

802
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,310
我就是现实
I am reality.

803
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,320
现实应该是这样 而现实就是这样
There's the way it ought to be, and there's the way it is.

804
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,130
伊利亚满口一派胡言
Elias was full of shit.

805
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,040
伊利亚是个斗士
Elias was a crusader.

806
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:08,630
我不会跟听从命令的人作对
Now, I got no fight with any man who does what he's told.

807
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:10,650
但当他不听命时…
But when he don't...

808
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,710
运作便会崩溃
...the machine breaks down.

809
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:17,850
运作崩溃时 我们就会崩溃
And when the machine breaks down, we break down.

810
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:21,020
我不会许容那样的事
I ain't going to allow that.

811
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,990
你们任何一个都不能
From any of you.

812
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:25,690
一个都不可以
Not one.

813
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:44,280
你们都爱伊利亚
You all love Elias.

814
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,780
你们想为他报仇
You want to kick ass.

815
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:01,030
我独个儿在这里
Well, here I am. All by my lonesome.

816
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,960
没有人会知道
And ain't nobody gonna know.

817
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,140
你们六个对我一个
Six of you boys against me.

818
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:21,740
杀我吧
Kill me.

819
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:41,800
我卑视你们
I shit on all of you.

820
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,600
混蛋
You motherfucker!

821
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:54,040
打吧
Come on, man.

822
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,280
柯里斯 打他
Get him, Chris.

823
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:02,950
巴恩 不要下手
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man!

824
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,520
你要坐牢的
You'll go dinky dau in LBJ, man.

825
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:08,830
杀军人要坐十年牢 十年
Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years.

826
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,900
你想想吧
Climb the fucking walls, man.

827
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,940
不要下手
Don't do it.

828
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,480
死亡
Death?

829
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,620
你们对死亡有什么认识
What do you all know about death?

830
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:55,170
我们翌日被派回到山谷里
They sent us back into the valley the next day...

831
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:59,250
进入离柬埔寨约二千米的战区
...about 2000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter.

832
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:02,420
我们好像回到案发现场
It felt like we were returning to the scene of a crime.

833
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:40,550
A连在前一天被重击
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable force.

834
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:43,160
C连在那一天被袭击
Charlie Company had been probed that night.

835
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,490
山谷里有其他战事…
There were other battalions in the valley...

836
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:49,700
但我们是引他们出来的饵
...but we knew we were the bait to lure them out.

837
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:54,600
141北越军就在下面某处
Somewhere out there was the entire 1 4 1 st NVA regiment.

838
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:16,520
他们昨晚想袭击C连
Caught them trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.

839
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:18,850
他们发现地图
They found maps on them, man.

840
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:23,900
听说每个散兵坑都有地雷
Got a friend at Battalion, says they had every foxhole here fixed on.

841
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:28,630
知道我方的距离 林木线和地雷
Distances, tree lines, our claymores, everything.

842
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,530
情况不妙
This is bad, man.

843
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:35,310
我有不祥之兆 听说我们身在柬埔寨
-I got bad vibes here. -I also heard we're in Cambodia now.

844
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:38,210
柬埔寨 你在开玩笑
Cambodia? Man, you're kidding me.

845
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:40,680
你想见我
You wanted to see me, sir?

846
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:45,650
拉姆治 伊利亚小组归你
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

847
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:49,860
小组 我不知道我的连叫小组
Squad? I didn't know we were still referring to this platoon as squads.

848
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,530
我要你去那两个坑
I want you to take those two holes, right there and there.

849
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:57,630
跟在上面的巴恩 和在下面的金联络
Tie it off with Barnes up here and King down there.

850
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,960
长官 对不起…
Begging your pardon, sir...

851
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,930
那两个坑距离太远 一个连队可以从中通过
...my two holes are so far apart, a regiment could run between them.

852
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:06,830
我只有五个军人活着
I have five live bodies left.

853
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:10,700
我不想听你的问题 新兵很快到
I don't want to hear your problems. You'll get new men any day.

854
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,680
你要和别人一样作战
Make do like everybody else.

855
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:15,450
我没有要求这个 我不想再听
-I didn't ask for this. -I don't want to hear it.

856
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,980
你不想再听 对
-You don't want to hear it? -That's right.

857
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:21,620
因为老实说我毫不在乎
Because, to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.

858
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,660
我不再在乎
I just don't give a flying fuck anymore.

859
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:34,270
我很高兴我不用和他们一起去
I'm glad I ain't going with them.

860
01:29:36,650 --> 01:29:39,630
外面有一头饥饿的野兽
Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.

861
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:42,110
真失败
What a fucking bummer.

862
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:46,680
只剩十天了 我仍要面对这一切
Ten days and a wake-up, and I'm still dealing with this shit.

863
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:51,850
你怎么了
What's the matter with you?

864
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,380
你为什么不写信
Why ain't you writing nobody?

865
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:56,680
你的父母呢
What about your folks?

866
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,590
你向我提起的祖母怎样
That grandma you told me about?

867
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:03,170
女朋友呢
Girl?

868
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:07,530
你有父母吧
You got parents, don't you?

869
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:09,700
一定有些亲密的人
There must be somebody.

870
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,640
没有
No, there's nobody.

871
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:16,710
你抽太多了
You been smoking too much of this shit.

872
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:21,570
你要控制一下 令人颓丧
Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

873
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:26,490
我记得你初来时什么都不懂
I remember when you first come out here to the bush, you's green as--

874
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,120
你可曾被无法摆脱的错误缠绕着
You ever get caught in a mistake you just can't get out of?

875
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:34,060
总有方法解决的
There's a way out of anything.

876
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:37,790
只要你振作精神
Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry...

877
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,030
一定有方法的
...and the worm will turn.

878
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,530
你还有多少天
How many days you short?

879
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:49,370
不只是我 而是整个事情
It's not just me. It's how the whole thing works.

880
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:51,340
像伊利亚般的人要牺牲
People like Elias get wasted.

881
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:55,380
巴恩那种人却能继续为所欲为
People like Barnes go on making up all the rules any way they want.

882
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:59,420
我们只能逆来顺受吗
So, what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it.

883
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,660
我们不用理会那些事情
We just don't add up to dry shit.

884
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:07,760
谁说你需要的 你只需要活着离开这里
Whoever said we did? All you got to do is make it out of here...

885
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:12,400
然后每天快乐地生活
...and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life. Gravy.

886
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,760
你是理想主义者
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

887
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:22,030
收拾你的行装 你的命令刚下达
Collect up your shit. Your orders just come through.

888
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,680
不要骗我
Man, don't fuck with me.

889
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:26,610
你要邀请信吗
Oh, what do you need, a written invitation?

890
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:31,510
天啊 他们做错事
Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers done made a mistake!

891
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:33,290
他们竟然饶我一命
They cut me some slack!

892
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,320
你有十分钟时间赶去搭直升机
You got 1 0 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here.

893
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:39,250
因为如果你不上机…
Because if you're not on it...

894
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:41,130
我便会去
...I'm gonna be.

895
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,230
泰勒 法兰西准备好了
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

896
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,240
太好了 金 我为你 感到高兴 回家吧
That's great, King, I'm happy for you. Take it on home for me.

897
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:51,770
你有我的地址 你知道怎么联络我
You got my address. You know where to reach me anytime.

898
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:54,840
我要走了 我不想错过直升机
I gotta di di. Don't want to miss that chopper.

899
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:01,480
你没事吧 我没事
-You okay? -Yeah, I'm okay.

900
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:03,550
记住放松点
Remember, take it easy.

901
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,490
不要想太多 别做傻瓜
Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool.

902
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:10,460
记住这里没有人是懦夫
Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here.

903
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,490
我的朋友
My man.

904
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:21,630
我送你出去
I'll walk you out, man.

905
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,130
金 保重
Take it easy, King.

906
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:31,880
我会 再见
-I'll take it any way I can get it. -I hear you. Later.

907
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:35,110
很痛 中士 不要碰它
I'm pretty fucked up, sarge. Don't touch it!

908
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,620
我一定要上直升机
I gotta get on the chopper, man.

909
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,420
有什么问题 他说不能走路
-So, what's the problem? -Says he can't walk.

910
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,920
可恶
Shit.

911
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,060
马丁…
Martin...

912
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,190
穿上靴子
...get your boots on.

913
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:54,630
下次给我见到你喷防蚊水…
And the next time I catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your feet...

914
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:57,370
我会送你上军事法庭
...I'll court-martial your nigger ass.

915
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:00,470
送我去吧
Then court-martial me, motherfucker!

916
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:03,140
逮捕我啊 送我去坐牢吧
Bust my ass! Send me to fucking Long Binh!

917
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,270
下手吧
Do your fucking worst!

918
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:09,020
你们白人欺负我
You white folks got your last klick out of Junior!

919
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:12,420
奥尼尔 把蜈蚣拿来
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

920
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,620
中士 是
-Sarge? -Yeah.

921
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:19,660
我找到那毛茸茸 红黑色的虫
That long, hairy, red and black bastard I found in the ammo crate.

922
01:33:21,410 --> 01:33:23,390
我会把它放进他的伤口
I'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch.

923
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:24,660
我记得了
I remember now.

924
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:28,000
等一下
Hold up, man!

925
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:30,070
等一下好吗
You just hold up and wait, okay?

926
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,930
我会走路了
Fuck it, I'll walk! I'll fucking walk!

927
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,870
我要和他同一个坑
Fucking pussy! Sarge, I gotta have him in my hole?

928
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:37,370
对
Yeah.

929
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,340
我可以和你谈谈吗
Bob, I'd like to speak to you a minute.

930
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:46,780
我不能再忍受了
I can't take it no more.

931
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,820
什么事
Yeah, what is it?

932
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:55,290
我有伊利亚的假期 有三天
Bob, I got Elias' R and R. It's coming up in three days.

933
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:58,290
我想回去夏威夷见柏丝
I was thinking about going to Hawaii and see Patsy.

934
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:00,960
我从没向你要求过任何事
I never asked you for a thing over here.

935
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,260
坦白说…
Well, to be honest with you...

936
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:07,100
我想和金一起坐直升机回去 你觉得呢
...I was hoping you'd put me on a chopper with King. What do you say?

937
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,010
我不能让你那样做
I can't do that for you.

938
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,970
你知道这里很需要人手
You know we need every swinging dick in the field.

939
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:15,680
你可以跟我说 我只是请三天假
You can talk to me, for chrissake! I'm just asking for three days.

940
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,550
我告诉你不可以
I am talking to you, Red. And I'm telling you no.

941
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:21,420
回到散兵坑
Get back in your foxhole.

942
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:25,450
我有不祥之兆 知道吗
Bob, I've got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

943
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:28,220
我今次有不祥之兆
I mean I've got a bad feeling.

944
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:31,300
我觉得我不能活着离开这里
I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.

945
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:33,500
你明白吗
You understand what I'm saying?

946
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:37,330
每个人都会死的
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

947
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:47,370
可恶
Oh, shit!

948
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:03,930
混蛋们 再见
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

949
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:18,200
埋伏在哪里
Where's that fucking ambush?

950
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:23,220
他们不会等 他们现在就来了
They ain't even waiting till later. It's fucking coming now, man.

951
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:25,540
现在就来了
Right fucking now.

952

乔利亚 我们所做的一切
You know, Junior? Some of the things we done, man...

953
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:36,660
我不觉得我们在做错事
...I don't feel like we done something wrong.

954
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:38,990
但有时…
But sometimes, man...

955
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:43,010
我有不祥的感觉
...I get this bad feeling.

956
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:48,370
我坦然对随军牧师说我喜欢这里
I told the padre the truth. I like it here.

957
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:51,480
你可以为所欲为 没有人理会你
You get to do what you want, nobody fucks with you.

958
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,180
你只用担心死亡
The only worry you got is dying.

959
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:56,880
反正死的时候你不会知道
And if that happens, you won't know about it...

960
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,090
那么担心什么
...so, what the fuck, man?

961
01:35:59,470 --> 01:36:02,890
我要和你同一个坑么
Shit. I got to be in this hole with you, man?

962
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,130
我早知道我不应该来
I just know I shouldn't have come.

963
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:11,890
不用担心 你和爱迪墨菲在一起
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging with Audie Murphy here.

They"re all around us. Hundreds of them. I can hear them talking gook.

970

3 Alpha, spot that smoke and tell me where to shift.

971
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:40,120
冷静下来 撑着点 我们会救你

1020
01:43:59,010 --> 01:44:01,730
你们去哪里
Hey, you two! Where the fuck are you going?

1021
01:44:20,770 --> 01:44:21,810
联络不到任何人吗

1022
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:25,360

For the record, it's my call! Dump all you've got on my pos.

1036

我再说投下所有炸弹
I say again, expend all remaining in my perimeter.

1037

That must have been some fucking fight.

1053
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,340
只有你一个吗
You alone here, man?

1054
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,500
是
Yeah.

1055
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:25,040
那些混球 他们留下我
Bunch of fucking faggots. They all left me.

1056
01:52:14,210 --> 01:52:17,860
122个受伤 仍在点算中
1 22 wounded and still counting.

1057
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:19,290

-Hey, man, how you doing? -I'm okay. How you doing?

1062
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:38,640
我很好
Fine, man. Just fine.

1063
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:42,220
我们受过两次伤可以离开这里
Hey, dig it, we two-timers. We're gonna get out of here, boy.

1064
01:52:42,530 --> 01:52:46,320
在医院再见
I'm gonna see you in the hospital. We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.

1065
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:51,630

-Ready? -You bet.

1069
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,200
现在回想一切…
I think now, looking back...

1070
01:54:41,650 --> 01:54:45,410
我们不是对抗敌人 而是自己
...we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves...

1071
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:48,010
敌人就在我们心中
...and the enemy was in us.

1072
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:52,340
战争对我来说现在已经完结
The war is over for me now...

1073
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:56,490
但它永远会存留在我的心中里
...but it will always be there the rest of my days.

1074
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,930
伊利亚会和…
