1
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,889
" These violent delights have violent ends,

2
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,456
"and in their triumph die, like fire and powder,

3
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,030
"which, as they kiss, consume."

4
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,532
Gran?

5
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,520
Edward, don't! She'll see you.

6
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:17,429
Okay.

7
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,978
Gran, I'd like you to meet...

8
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,344
Happy birthday, Bella.

9
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,751
Happy birthday.

10
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,157
I thought we agreed, no presents.

11
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,796
Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count.

12
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,270
That's actually great. Thanks, Dad.

13
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:36,546
It goes with this one from your mom. We coordinated.

14
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,875
Well, she coordinated me.

15
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:44,211
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.

16
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,919
Senior year.

17
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,524
- How'd you get so old so fast? - I didn't. It's not that old.

18
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,392
I don't know. Is that a gray hair?

19
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,501
No. No way.

20
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,199
Happy birthday.

21
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,709
That's really funny.

22
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,181
Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.

23
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,977
Rangers are searching for the killer animal...

24
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,217
Situation's all critical

25
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,157
You've got to look first before you go

26
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,126
It's Bella. Bella!

27
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,052
- Hi. - I'm...

28
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,358
Today's the big day, Bella.

29
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,031
R and J essay due.

30
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,500
- Oh, yeah. - Wherefore art thou, Bella?

31
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,509
Let me take a picture of you guys. My mom wants me to put together, like,

32
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,705
a scrapbook full of memories.

33
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,769
- Oh. - Cool. Yeah.

34
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,213
I take them. I'm not in them.

35
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,681
- No, no, no, come here. - Well, you are today.

36
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,115
You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?

37
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:50,019
Don't worry, I'm in the picture. No one will be looking at you guys.

38
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,488
That's good.

39
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,250
Oh, good. Cullen's here.

40
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,288
Well, talk to you later.

41
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:24,016
- Happy birthday. - Don't remind me.

42
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,079
Mmm.

43
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:29,352
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.

44
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,124
- Yeah, but my aging's not. - Your aging?

45
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,265
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.

46
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,963
It's one year older than you.

47
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,563
No, it isn't. I'm 109.

48
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,004
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.

49
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:48,638
- Mmm. - It's gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed.

50
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:49,703
Uh-huh.

51
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,893
- We have to go to class. - Okay.

52
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,191
Wait a second.

53
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,865
Someone wants you.

54
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,472
- Bella! - Jacob!

55
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,235
What?

56
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,069
I'll leave you to talk.

57
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:28,049
Hello, biceps! You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.

58
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,519
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.

59
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,027
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.

60
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,429
You should switch schools. You can come hang out with the palefaces.

61
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,933
I'm all right. I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.

62
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,036
They let any old riffraff into this place.

63
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,197
- I see. Then why are you slumming it? - Mmm-hmm.

64
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,764
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

65
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,367
You should really come take a ride when it's done.

66
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,810
Is it fast?

67
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:54,935
Um.

68
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,840
It's decent.

69
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,281
- I'm kidding. - Okay. Good.

70
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,113
Hey, happy birthday.

71
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,851
Your dad told my dad, so...

72
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,461
Yeah, of course he did.

73
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,590
I saw this the other day and thought of you.

74
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,963
Catches bad dreams.

75
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,995
That's kind of perfect.

76
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,573
Thank you.

77
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,576
No problem.

78
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,939
- Good seeing you. - Yeah, I'll see you later.

79
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,141
Bye.

80
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,314
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?

81
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,390
Because I have nothing to give back to you.

82
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,893
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.

83
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,456
See? Thank you.

84
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,126
- That's all I want. - Bella!

85
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,001
- Happy birthday! - Shh, shh!

86
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,801
I thought I said no presents.

87
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,037
I've already seen you open it, and guess what,

88
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,544
you love it.

89
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,411
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.

90
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,143
Come on. Please? It'll be fun.

91
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,157
- Okay. All right. - Great!

92
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:16,353
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.

93
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,400
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.

94
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,528
Sorry, Bella. Happy...

95
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,237
Never mind.

96
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,808
You can't trust vampires. Trust me.

97
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,839
O my love! My wife!

98
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,845
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath

99
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,353
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

100
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,387
Thou art not conquered.

101
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,761
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.

102
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,464
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

103
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,501
I hate being celebrated.

104
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,138
There are worse tragedies. I mean, look at Romeo.

105
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,175
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.

106
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,169
Yeah.

107
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,840
Though I do envy him one thing.

108
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,775
Juliet is, like, perfect.

109
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,117
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.

110
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,326
Not the girl, the suicide.

111
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,495
It's nearly impossible for...

112
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,597
For some people.

113
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,505
For humans, a little poison,

114
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,604
a dagger to the heart.

115
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,476
There's so many different options.

116
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,655
Why would you say that?

117
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,449
Because I had to consider it once.

118
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,688
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.

119
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:03,495
I had to come up with some kind of plan.

120
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,465
What was the plan?

121
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,997
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.

122
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,073
- The what? - The Volturi.

123
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,603
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter

124
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,242
just to show they were paying attention?

125
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,051
Mr. Cullen?

126
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,716
Yes, Mr. Berty.

127
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,328
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest

128
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,497
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.

129
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,203
"Eyes, look your last.

130
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,071
"Arms, take your last embrace!

131
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,945
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,

132
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:52,948
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"

133
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,280
Eyes on the screen, people.

134
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,290
ROMEO: Thus with a kiss I die.

135
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,861
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.

136
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,096
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.

137
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,900
- Is that Carlisle? - Yeah.

138
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,303
He lived with them for a few decades.

139
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:22,973
Described them as very refined. No respect for human life, of course,

140
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,352
but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.

141
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,411
And the law.

142
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,186
Above all, the law.

143
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,191
Vampires have laws?

144
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,359
Not very many.

145
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,367
And only one that's regularly enforced.

146
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,340
What is it?

147
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,503
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.

148
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,006
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,

149
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,409
and we don't kill conspicuously.

150
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,792
Unless, of course, you want to die.

151
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,299
You gotta stop talking about that.

152
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,142
I can't even think about someone hurting you.

153
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,810
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.

154
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,680
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.

155
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,816
That's not true.

156
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,025
Victoria? She'll come for me one day.

157
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:51,460
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.

158
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,637
I could protect you

159
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,369
if you change me.

160
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,476
Bella, you already do protect me.

161
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,438
You're my only reason

162
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,847
to stay alive,

163
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,350
if that's what I am.

164
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,988
But it's my job to protect you.

165
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,657
From everyone except my sister.

166
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,964
It's time! It's time. It's time. It's time!

167
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,467
Your lips are nettles

168
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,600
Your tongue is wine

169
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,671
You're left as liquid But your body's pine

170
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,442
Sorry about all this.

171
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,348
- We tried to rein Alice in. - As if that were even possible.

172
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,909
- Happy birthday, Bella. - Thanks.

173
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,859
I found it in your bag. You mind?

174
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,858
Dating an older woman. Hot.

175
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,295
- What? - You first, Rosalie.

176
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,230
It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

177
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:02,867
Thanks.

178
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,306
Show me the love.

179
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,007
This one's from Emmett.

180
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,978
Already installed it in your truck.

181
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,490
Finally a decent sound system

182
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,958
- for that piece of... - Hey! Don't hate the truck.

183
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,289
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

184
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,090
Just a little something to brighten your day.

185
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,137
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.

186
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,398
Ow.

187
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,476
Paper cut.

188
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,298
Jaz, Jaz. It's okay. It's just a little

189
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,041
blood.

190
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,451
Get Jasper out of here.

191
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,490
I'm sorry, I can't.

192
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,595
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.

193
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,494
Check on Jasper.

194
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,771
I'm sure he's very upset with himself,

195
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,366
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.

196
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,637
Edward.

197
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,581
- I never wanted to have a party. - It's not your fault.

198
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:06,791
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.

199
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,160
How do you do it?

200
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,262
Years and years of practice.

201
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:16,672
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?

202
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,568
No.

203
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,182
I knew who I wanted to be. I wanted to help people.

204
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,683
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.

205
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,521
Damned?

206
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,222
Like hell?

207
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,102
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.

208
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,768
You couldn't. It's impossible.

209
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,934
Thank you, Bella.

210
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:54,104
You've always been very gracious about us.

211
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,448
So that's it? That's why he won't change me?

212
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,923
Imagine the situation in reverse. Hmm.

213
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,428
If you believed as Edward does,

214
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,028
could you take away his soul?

215
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,088
You can't protect me

216
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,855
from everything.

217
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,298
At some point, something's gonna separate us.

218
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,629
It's gonna be an accident or illness

219
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,203
or old age,

220
00:17:55,974 --> 00:18:00,343
as long as I'm human. And the only solution is to change me.

221
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,578
That's not a solution. That's a tragedy.

222
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:09,280
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.

223
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,800
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?

224
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,300
Carlisle told me

225
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,536
how you feel about your soul.

226
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,943
I don't believe that.

227
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,242
So don't worry about mine.

228
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,216
You should go inside.

229
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,869
It's still my birthday.

230
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:04,498
So can I ask one thing?

231
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,308
Kiss me?

232
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,111
I love you.

233
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,115
I love you.

234
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,243
Up with your turret

235
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,477
Aren't we just terrified?

236
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,659
Shale, screen your worry

237
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:43,731
From what you won't ever find

238
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,554
Don't let it fool you

239
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,419
Don't let it fool you

240
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,119
Down

241
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,227
Hey.

242
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,572
Just come take a walk with me.

243
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,298
We have to leave Forks.

244
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,763
Why?

245
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:52,865
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks,

246
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,344
and people are starting to notice.

247
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:02,008
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.

248
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,696
When you say "we"...

249
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,201
I mean my family and myself.

250
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,939
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.

251
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,978
You're right. It was nothing,

252
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,112
nothing but what I always expected

253
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,322
and nothing compared to what could have happened.

254
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,165
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

255
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,937
I belong with you.

256
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,011
No. You don't.

257
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,984
I'm coming.

258
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,213
Bella,

259
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,954
I don't want you to come.

260
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:22,261
You don't want me?

261
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,132
No.

262
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,247
That changes things a lot.

263
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,184
But if it's not too much to ask,

264
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,421
can you just promise me something?

265
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,986
Don't do anything reckless.

266
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,526
For Charlie's sake.

267
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,935
And I'll promise something to you in return.

268
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,870
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

269
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,065
I won't come back,

270
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:07,469
and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.

271
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:12,046
It will be like I never existed, I promise.

272
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:19,253
If this is about my soul, take it. I don't want it without you.

273
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,349
It's not about your soul.

274
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,794
You're just not good for me.

275
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,368
Not good enough for you.

276
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,231
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.

277
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,438
Please...

278
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,274
Don't...

279
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,914
Goodbye.

280
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,761
Edward.

281
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,742
Edward.

282
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,381
Edward.

283
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:27,688
Edward!

284
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,861
Edward.

285
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:35,179
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.

286
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,981
- The Cullens left town, Charlie. - Good riddance.

287
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,752
Where'd they go?

288
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,659
We'll find her, Charlie.

289
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,060
- Thanks, Harry. - Charlie!

290
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,423
Hey.

291
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,294
She's all right.

292
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,629
I got her. Thank you, Sam.

293
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:42,746
There's a possibility

294
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:51,423
There's a possibility

295
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,894
All that I had

296
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,564
Was all I'm gonna get

297
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,911
Alice, you've disappeared,

298
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,485
like everything else.

299
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:18,449
Now who else can I talk to? I'm lost.

300
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,157
When you left,

301
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,728
and he left,

302
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,337
you took everything with you.

303
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,468
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.

304
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,379
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.

305
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,087
Bella.

306
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:16,246
But in a way I'm glad.

307
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,873
The pain is my only reminder that he was real,

308
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,642
that you all were.

309
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,555
All right. That's it.

310
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,425
What?

311
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:40,167
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.

312
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,441
I'm not leaving Forks.

313
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,610
Bells, he's not coming back.

314
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,945
I know.

315
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,019
It's just not normal, this behavior.

316
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:02,523
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.

317
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,494
Baby, I don't want you to leave.

318
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:11,632
I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville. Make some new friends.

319
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,363
I like my old friends.

320
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,202
- Well, you never see them anymore. - I do.

321
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,938
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.

322
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,944
- You hate shopping. - I...

323
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,814
I need a girls' night out.

324
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,457
All right. Girls' night.

325
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,194
Shopping.

326
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:44,695
I like it. Go buy some stuff.

327
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,068
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.

328
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,179
Yeah, Bella Swan.

329
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,654
I don't know why you want to sit through

330
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:08,021
all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.

331
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,619
It's gross. Like... And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?

332
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,290
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy,

333
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,357
my cousin had leprosy. It's not funny, you know?

334
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,336
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?

335
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:22,599
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like,

336
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:25,301
self-referential cleverness, you know?

337
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,868
Like, some girls like to shop. Not all girls, apparently.

338
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,938
Although I was surprised you even called at all. You know?

339
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,144
Like, your depression thing, I get it. I'm totally, totally worried.

340
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,243
But after a while it's like,

341
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,810
- you're still bumming... - You want a ride, girls?

342
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,880
...and I'm going through stuff, too. You know? Like Mike deciding

343
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,015
he just wants to be friends.

344
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,081
What's up? Look what we found.

345
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,354
It's hard, you know?

346
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:44,758
Like, and since when does "just friends"...

347
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,353
- What's up guys? - Look what we found.

348
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,489
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, where you going?

349
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:57,563
Keep walking.

350
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,338
This is dangerous.

351
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,451
- Dude, come on. - Come here for a sec!

352
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,655
I think I know those guys.

353
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:22,557
We got beer! We got bikes!

354
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,725
Well, they seem great. Can we go?

355
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,969
I'm just gonna see something.

356
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,507
Hey, girlie!

357
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,609
All right, all right. We got a taker.

358
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,750
Turn around.

359
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,797
- Shut up! - You shut up!

360
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:05,335
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

361
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:08,242
No, that's cool. I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.

362
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,974
So, what do you say?

363
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,147
You promised me, nothing reckless.

364
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,290
You promised it would be as if you never existed.

365
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:33,565
- You lied. - You say something, babe?

366
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,128
You know what? Never mind.

367
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,918
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

368
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,837
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

369
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,600
Just curious.

370
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,010
- I thought that I saw something. - You... Oh.

371
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,711
You're insane, actually. Or suicidal.

372
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:20,809
That homeboy could've been a psycho.

373
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:25,254
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.

374
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,615
God, that was such a rush.

375
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,887
Awesome. So you're an adrenaline junkie now?

376
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,224
That's cool. You can go bungee jumping.

377
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,562
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.

378
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,794
Crazy.

379
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,968
Alice, I saw him.

380
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,877
Maybe I'm crazy now. I guess that's okay.

381
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,281
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him,

382
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,583
then that's what I'll find.

383
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,852
Bella!

384
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,021
Where the hell have you been, loca?

385
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,535
I brought you something.

386
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,798
- Okay. - It's a little crazy.

387
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:21,936
Wow.

388
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,541
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

389
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,845
I saved it from the junkyard.

390
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:32,954
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth,

391
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,488
but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend

392
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,821
- to help me out then... - Ah!

393
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:40,261
- Me being the mechanic-type friend? - That's right.

394
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,458
- Since when are you into motorcycles? - Since now.

395
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,742
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.

396
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,837
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.

397
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,477
When do we start?

398
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:04,743
Um.

399
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:06,886
Now.

400
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:09,522
- Please? - All right.

401
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:16,296
Oh, hey, be careful. Those things are actually really heavy, so...

402
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,903
Jake, you're, like, buff.

403
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:26,238
How did that happen? You're, like, 16. I don't get it.

404
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,643
Mmm-hmm. Age is just a number, baby. What are you, like, 40 now?

405
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:36,282
It feels like that sometimes.

406
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,193
That song's good. You don't like it?

407
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:54,703
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.

408
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:57,863
Okay. No more music.

409
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,138
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day,

410
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,079
and hopefully we will,

411
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,879
we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.

412
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,012
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.

413
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:14,182
You? Influence me? Please.

414
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,085
Are you... I'm older than you,

415
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,530
so that makes me the influencer and you the influencee.

416
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,192
No, no, no.

417
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,999
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you

418
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,597
because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.

419
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:33,165
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.

420
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,805
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?

421
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,111
Okay. So where do we stand?

422
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,086
- I'm 35. And you might be, like, 32. - Come on.

423
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,850
- Yo, Jake, you in there? - It's okay. It's just my boys.

424
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,723
- Hey, Jake. - Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

425
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:53,319
- Bella, that's Quil and Embry. - Hi.

426
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,761
I'm Quil Ateara.

427
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,802
So the bike building story is true.

428
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,963
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.

429
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,837
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?

430
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:06,466
Uh...

431
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,375
We're friends, you know.

432
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:10,106
- Burn. - Actually,

433
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,081
remember I said she's a girl and a friend.

434
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,015
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?

435
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:16,074
Nope.

436
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,644
So you guys have girlfriends? That's awesome.

437
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,417
Yeah, right. Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.

438
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,255
Yeah, that's still a riot.

439
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,298
You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

440
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,931
Jeez.

441
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,332
Hey, that hold's illegal!

442
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,394
I got five bucks on Quil.

443
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:36,103
You're on.

444
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:42,636
All of the astronauts Champagne in plastic cups

445
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:47,013
Waiting for the big hero to show

446
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:52,144
Outside the door he stands His head in his hands

447
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,451
And his heart in his throat

448
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:58,552
What can he tell them now

449
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,158
Dear Alice,

450
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,596
I wish I had your real address.

451
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,593
I wish I could tell you about Jake.

452
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:08,064
He makes me feel better.

453
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,673
I mean, he makes me feel alive.

454
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:16,371
The hole in my chest,

455
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:21,474
well, when I'm with Jake, it's like it's almost healed

456
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,951
for a while.

457
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:28,521
So, Quil keeps asking to come over. I think he likes you a little too much.

458
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,048
Oh.

459
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,694
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing. You know?

460
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,891
What's up with you and age?

461
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,338
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?

462
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,809
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.

463
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,181
Hey, hey, hey!

464
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,083
Wake up, Bella.

465
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,819
You're okay. You're okay.

466
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:18,341
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.

467
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,774
Can I ask you something?

468
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,686
Hanging out with Jacob,

469
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:35,319
that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?

470
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,127
You know, sometimes

471
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,162
you gotta learn to love what's good for you.

472
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,903
You know what I mean?

473
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,468
Of course, what do I know?

474
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,109
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

475
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,407
Famous ladies' man.

476
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:05,079
Okay.

477
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,582
I'm gonna go to bed.

478
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,282
Uh...

479
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,227
I love you.

480
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:22,896
If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?

481
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,743
Are you doubting your mad skills?

482
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,779
No. Definitely not. I mean, they'll run fine.

483
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,149
It's just,

484
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,887
maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.

485
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:49,022
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that that's really too bad,

486
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,967
but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.

487
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,871
Is that Sam Uley?

488
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,244
Yeah. Him and his cult.

489
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,583
Oh, my God.

490
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,349
Did you see that?

491
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,962
They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving.

492
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,523
Scary as hell, but a total rush.

493
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,671
- A rush? - Most of us jump from lower down.

494
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:34,040
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.

495
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,545
You have some kind of beef with him or something?

496
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:42,241
I don't know.

497
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,879
They just think they run this place.

498
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:48,223
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.

499
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,726
- Now look at him. - That's Embry?

500
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,894
- Yeah. - What happened to him?

501
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,957
He missed some school.

502
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:01,130
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.

503
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,038
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.

504
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,806
Sam keeps giving me this look,

505
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,609
like he's waiting for me or something.

506
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,613
It's kind of starting to freak me out.

507
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,086
Well, you should just avoid him.

508
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:21,454
I try.

509
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,906
Okay.

510
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,106
- You look scared. - I'm not.

511
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,880
All right.

512
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,942
- Brake? - That one.

513
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,688
Clutch?

514
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:55,952
Good.

515
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,418
Gas?

516
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,192
Ready?

517
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,393
Now, slowly release the clutch.

518
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,598
Bella.

519
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:13,164
Stop.

520
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,074
You all right?

521
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,148
I'm gonna go again.

522
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:24,747
Okay.

523
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,031
Hit the brake!

524
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,647
I wanna go again.

525
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,453
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

526
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,086
- No. I want to go again. - No. Forget it.

527
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,523
No more bikes.

528
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,023
Man, your head.

529
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,333
- Yeah. - Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

530
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,236
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?

531
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,175
Yeah. I guess I am.

532
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,948
Well, it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.

533
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,484
There.

534
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,122
What are you staring at?

535
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,629
You're sort of beautiful.

536
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,844
How hard did you hit your head?

537
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,340
I don't know.

538
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,118
Let's go.

539
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:09,024
I did see something in the woods.

540
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:10,958
Totally. Baby, I believe you.

541
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,326
No, he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky.

542
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:18,758
No, okay. It was jet black and huge.

543
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,668
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.

544
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:22,932
A bear, maybe?

545
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,474
Or an alien. You're lucky you didn't get probed.

546
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,868
Well, I saw it.

547
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,638
You know, you're not the only one.

548
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,111
My dad's been getting reports at the station.

549
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,120
Like, five hikers have been killed by some bear.

550
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,315
But they can't find the bear.

551
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,379
Hmm.

552
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:46,360
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.

553
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,086
Um...

554
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,934
So? I mean,

555
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,396
Bella's back?

556
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,800
Yeah, I guess so.

557
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,436
All right, that's... Well, welcome.

558
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,541
So, listen, now that you're talking

559
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:12,715
and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there,

560
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:19,057
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.

561
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,728
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I do.

562
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:28,866
Cool.

563
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,430
Let me see, we could check out

564
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,272
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.

565
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,472
You know, it's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy.

566
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,380
- I mean, it's supposed to be pretty... - No. No romance.

567
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:47,514
How about Face Punch? Have you heard of that?

568
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:50,791
I mean, that's an action movie.

569
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,692
Yeah, that's perfect.

570
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,360
Guns, adrenaline.

571
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,461
That's my thing.

572
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:58,694
Okay.

573
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:03,403
We should get a bunch of people to go. Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?

574
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,701
Face Punch, yeah!

575
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:06,264
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that.

576
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:07,901
Remember, the trailer's like...

577
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,208
- "Punch faces." - I remember.

578
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,976
Yeah! Movie night with Bella.

579
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,084
So Face Punch, huh?

580
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,747
You like action movies?

581
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,148
Not really.

582
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,893
I heard it sucks. Bad.

583
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,301
Are you even old enough to see this movie?

584
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,000
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision.

585
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:38,040
Right, yeah, well, she's buying my ticket for me.

586
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:40,042
She's buying it. Okay.

587
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,113
Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu,

588
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,445
so Eric's taking care of her.

589
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,577
- It's just us three. - Great!

590
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:52,211
- Great. - Yeah.

591
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,723
Put your gun down.

592
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,489
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.

593
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:02,031
Both of you put both of your guns down

594
00:50:02,098 --> 00:50:04,828
or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.

595
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,703
All right, forget it, let's do this!

596
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,647
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.

597
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:36,161
He's...

598
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,330
What a marshmallow!

599
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:42,927
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.

600
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,464
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.

601
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,374
Yeah. I'll keep my eye open for that.

602
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:55,016
I feel bad. He probably has that flu that's going around.

603
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,687
What? I can't hold your hand?

604
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,782
No, of course you can.

605
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:09,656
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you. So...

606
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:15,269
Okay, well, tell me something. You like me, right?

607
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,772
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?

608
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:27,476
Jacob, please, don't do this.

609
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,349
Why?

610
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,593
Because you're about to ruin everything.

611
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,061
And I need you.

612
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,444
Well, I've got loads of time.

613
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,479
I'm not gonna give up.

614
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,210
I don't want you to,

615
00:52:04,487 --> 00:52:07,684
but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.

616
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:12,490
And that's really selfish.

617
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,230
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.

618
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:27,400
I'm never gonna run right. So I should be fair to you.

619
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,076
It's because of him, right?

620
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,620
Look,

621
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,695
I know what he did to you.

622
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:53,297
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.

623
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:59,202
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.

624
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,610
I won't let you down.

625
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,480
You can count on me.

626
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,312
Well,

627
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,458
I need to go home.

628
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,472
I was feeling sick before the movie. Okay?

629
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,042
What is your problem?

630
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,376
Right now? You're my problem.

631
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:42,381
Feeling sick? Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

632
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,351
You want me to put you in the hospital?

633
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,755
Jake! Jake. Jake, the movie's over. What are you doing?

634
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,787
You're really hot.

635
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,628
Like, you feel like you have a fever. Are you okay?

636
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,932
I don't know what's happening.

637
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,395
I gotta go.

638
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,173
That dude is weird.

639
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:16,412
Jake, your dad says you have mono.

640
00:54:16,986 --> 00:54:20,149
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?

641
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,323
Hey, it's me again. I just...

642
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:32,300
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.

643
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:36,600
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.

644
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,142
Jacob, please...

645
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,478
Call me.

646
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:47,175
Okay. We should be back around 3:00.

647
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,384
Hey.

648
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,317
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.

649
00:54:58,394 --> 00:54:59,827
Yes, you do.

650
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,824
Yeah, you do. Go. What are you talking about?

651
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,594
Just be careful.

652
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,100
Always am.

653
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:10,295
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.

654
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,364
My kung fu is strong.

655
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,768
Jake!

656
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,039
Hey!

657
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,817
You cut your hair off?

658
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,486
And got a tattoo?

659
00:56:03,826 --> 00:56:05,054
Bella.

660
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,097
I thought you were too sick to come outside

661
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,728
or pick up the phone when I call.

662
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,300
Go away.

663
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:16,798
What?

664
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:19,805
Go away.

665
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,973
What happened to you? What's...

666
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,311
Hey! What happened?

667
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,345
Did Sam get to you? Is that what's happening?

668
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:35,721
Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him.

669
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,294
But if you want somebody to blame,

670
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:43,398
how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?

671
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:51,733
I don't know what you're talking about.

672
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:54,538
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

673
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,375
You've been lying to everyone. Charlie.

674
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,707
But you can't lie to me.

675
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,980
- Not anymore, Bella. - Jacob!

676
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:06,986
Jacob!

677
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,519
Look, Bella,

678
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,097
we can't be friends anymore.

679
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:22,734
Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you.

680
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,433
It's killing me. It kills me.

681
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,510
I just need... Maybe give me, like,

682
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,607
- some time or something. - Look, don't.

683
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:37,075
It's not you.

684
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,890
It's not you, it's me, right? Really?

685
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:46,158
It's true. It is me.

686
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:51,225
I'm not good.

687
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:57,234
I used to be a good kid.

688
00:57:58,574 --> 00:57:59,973
Not anymore.

689
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,738
This doesn't even matter. All right?

690
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,036
This is over.

691
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,275
You can't break up with me.

692
00:58:09,218 --> 00:58:10,480
I mean...

693
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,118
I mean, you're my best friend.

694
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,389
You promised me.

695
00:58:19,862 --> 00:58:21,193
I know.

696
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,761
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.

697
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:28,161
And this is me keeping that promise.

698
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,269
Go home

699
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,443
and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.

700
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,288
Alice,

701
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,816
things are...

702
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,363
Things are bad again.

703
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,660
Without Jake, I just... I can't stand it.

704
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,303
I don't see Edward anymore.

705
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,677
Will it really feel like he never existed?

706
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,349
I will find the place where I can see him again.

707
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:16,839
Bella.

708
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,142
Laurent.

709
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,641
I didn't expect to find you here.

710
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:30,088
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.

711
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,953
I'm surprised they left you behind.

712
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,155
Weren't you sort of

713
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,893
a pet of theirs?

714
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,428
Yeah. You could say that.

715
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,837
Do the Cullens visit often?

716
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,035
Lie.

717
01:00:56,652 --> 01:00:57,914
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.

718
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,578
Lie better.

719
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:02,249
I'll tell them that you stopped by.

720
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,054
But I probably shouldn't

721
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:08,190
tell Edward,

722
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,364
'cause he's pretty protective.

723
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,629
But he's far away, isn't he?

724
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,302
Why are you here?

725
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:22,743
I came as a favor to Victoria.

726
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,739
- Victoria? - She asked me to see

727
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:31,446
if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.

728
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,921
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate,

729
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,153
given he killed hers.

730
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:38,989
An eye for an eye.

731
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:40,856
Threaten him.

732
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,422
Edward would know who did it. And he'd come after you.

733
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,402
I don't think he will.

734
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,573
After all, how much could you mean to him

735
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:54,499
if he left you here unprotected?

736
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,871
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you,

737
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,940
but I can't help myself.

738
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,014
You are so mouth-watering.

739
01:02:04,086 --> 01:02:07,817
- Please, don't. I mean, you helped us. - No, no, no, no.

740
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:12,256
Don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.

741
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:15,223
Victoria plans on killing you slowly,

742
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:17,830
painfully,

743
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:21,031
whereas I'll make it quick.

744
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,769
I promise.

745
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,764
You will feel nothing.

746
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,141
Edward, I love you.

747
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,213
I don't believe it.

748
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,813
- Dad! I saw them. - What's the matter?

749
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,915
- In the woods. They're not bears. - What do you mean "in the woods"?

750
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,721
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?

751
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:55,525
They're wolves. I mean, they're like huge wolves.

752
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,463
Are you sure about that, Bella?

753
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,764
Yeah! I just saw them. They were after something.

754
01:04:01,937 --> 01:04:03,165
Wolves?

755
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,807
You saw them?

756
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,004
All right, well, Harry,

757
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:15,614
feel like going hunting? Get some of your guys together?

758
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,110
Sure, yeah, I'll just...

759
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,720
By now, those wolves will be dead,

760
01:04:23,325 --> 01:04:26,385
and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.

761
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,724
Victoria.

762
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:30,955
I should go to the station.

763
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,467
Yeah, you should. You should go.

764
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,469
Can you just stay in the house?

765
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:02,759
Bella!

766
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:06,867
You scared me.

767
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:10,394
- What the hell are you doing? - Back up. I'm coming up.

768
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:23,845
Hey.

769
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:27,716
Look, I'm sorry.

770
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:37,095
- For what? - I wish I could explain.

771
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:40,329
But I literally can't.

772
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:52,445
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone,

773
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,850
one that wasn't yours to share?

774
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,279
Well, that's what it's like for me.

775
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:02,888
But worse.

776
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,661
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.

777
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:10,264
I hate this.

778
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,191
I hate what they've done to you.

779
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,743
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.

780
01:06:34,823 --> 01:06:39,556
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?

781
01:06:41,096 --> 01:06:42,393
The...

782
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:49,064
The story. The story about

783
01:06:50,372 --> 01:06:51,999
the cold ones.

784
01:06:53,742 --> 01:06:57,473
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.

785
01:07:04,486 --> 01:07:08,354
There's gotta be something that you can do.

786
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,449
No. I'm in it for life.

787
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,522
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.

788
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,462
Just leave,

789
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,159
just you and me.

790
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:20,193
You'd do that?

791
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,307
I would do it for you.

792
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,947
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.

793
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:39,376
But I would run away with you

794
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,058
if I could.

795
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,429
I gotta go. They'll start wondering where I am.

796
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,072
Come here.

797
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:03,641
Please,

798
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,477
try to remember.

799
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:10,210
It'd be so much easier

800
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:13,045
if you knew.

801
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,015
I'll try. But, Jake...

802
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:21,557
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.

803
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:29,864
Jake.

804
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:48,518
Edward, I'm scared.

805
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,718
You should be.

806
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,732
Really, it's just like an old story.

807
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,665
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.

808
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:03,535
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?

809
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:19,615
Bella?

810
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:21,784
I need to see him.

811
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:24,048
He's not in.

812
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:29,027
- Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him. - Bella!

813
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:46,674
What did you do?

814
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:48,707
- Okay, what did you do? - Hey.

815
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,183
- What did you do to him? - Easy!

816
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,310
He didn't want this.

817
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,753
What did we do? What did he do? What'd he tell you?

818
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,255
- Both of you calm down. - Nothing.

819
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:58,418
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.

820
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:05,499
- Too late now. - Bella, get back!

821
01:10:06,668 --> 01:10:09,398
Paul, calm down, now!

822
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:19,274
Bella!

823
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:21,642
Run!

824
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,218
Jake, run!

825
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,574
Paul!

826
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,888
Hey! Take Bella back to Emily's place.

827
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,997
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

828
01:11:16,004 --> 01:11:19,872
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?

829
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,976
The fairy tales and horror stories?

830
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:26,606
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?

831
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,684
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.

832
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:33,414
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him. Serves him right.

833
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,286
No way. Jacob's a natural.

834
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:39,088
You see him phase on the fly? I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.

835
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,595
Come on in, Bella. We won't bite.

836
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,727
Speak for yourself.

837
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,891
I done me wrong

838
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,164
And done all wrong

839
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:53,364
All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long

840
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:58,038
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiance? Don't stare. It bugs Sam.

841
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:02,377
Why would I stare?

842
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,579
Are you guys hungry? Like I have to ask.

843
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,587
Who's this?

844
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,494
Bella Swan. Who else?

845
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,190
Hmm.

846
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:21,532
So, you're the vampire girl.

847
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,632
So, you're the wolf girl.

848
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:30,944
Guess so.

849
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,573
Well, I'm engaged to one.

850
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:41,447
Save some for your brothers. And ladies first. Muffin?

851
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,981
Sure. Thanks.

852
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,551
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.

853
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,298
He didn't say anything to me.

854
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:51,525
That's a wolf thing.

855
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,091
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.

856
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:56,433
And check it out. We can hear each other's thoughts.

857
01:12:56,505 --> 01:13:00,373
Would you shut up? These are trade secrets. Damn it!

858
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:03,008
This chick runs with vampires.

859
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,606
You can't really run with vampires.

860
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:10,449
'Cause they're fast.

861
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,450
Yeah? Well, we're faster.

862
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,517
Freaked out yet?

863
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,660
You're not the first monsters I've met.

864
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,562
Jake's right. You're good with weird.

865
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:26,494
Hey.

866
01:13:45,887 --> 01:13:47,252
Sorry.

867
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,568
So you're a werewolf?

868
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,774
Yeah. Last time I checked.

869
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:13,106
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.

870
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:17,283
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.

871
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:20,947
Mono.

872
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,215
Yeah. I wish.

873
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:31,557
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?

874
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:36,093
I mean, it's wrong.

875
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:41,232
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.

876
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:44,373
I was born this way. I can't help it.

877
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:47,643
You're such a hypocrite. What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?

878
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:49,616
It's not what you are.

879
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,419
It's what you do. They never hurt anybody.

880
01:14:55,857 --> 01:14:57,290
You've killed people, Jake.

881
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,759
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

882
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,229
Then who is?

883
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:06,267
What we're trying to protect you people from,

884
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,662
the only thing we do kill,

885
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,336
vampires.

886
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:14,900
Wait, Jake, you can't.

887
01:15:14,976 --> 01:15:17,240
Don't worry. We can't touch your little precious Cullens

888
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,780
unless they violate the treaty.

889
01:15:20,348 --> 01:15:22,509
That's not what I'm saying.

890
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:25,344
You can't kill vampires. They'II...

891
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,482
They'll kill you.

892
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:31,092
Really? We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.

893
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,656
Laurent?

894
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,394
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.

895
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,234
Victoria's here?

896
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:44,329
Was. We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.

897
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:47,842
She keeps coming back. We don't know what she's after.

898
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:49,240
I do.

899
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:53,740
Me.

900
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,691
Don't worry. We've got this place covered.

901
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:08,829
She won't get near you or Charlie.

902
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:11,126
Look, you've got to be careful.

903
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,327
She's fast. You don't know how fast she is.

904
01:16:14,402 --> 01:16:18,270
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.

905
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:21,640
All right, I'd better go.

906
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,569
You gotta go?

907
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,640
Yeah.

908
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,509
Got a vampire to kill.

909
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,690
Alice, I'm all right.

910
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,132
Until I'm alone.

911
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,872
And lately, that's all the time.

912
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,004
Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria.

913
01:16:56,077 --> 01:16:58,341
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.

914
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,108
And you're gone.

915
01:17:01,082 --> 01:17:02,845
And so is Edward.

916
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:09,221
And there's just nothing now.

917
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,285
You got something, Harry?

918
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:17,124
Nope. Nothing.

919
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,740
But I realize where I have to go,

920
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,333
what I have to do to see him again.

921
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,681
A tear in my brain

922
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,759
Allows the voices in

923
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:02,473
They wanna push you off the path

924
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:10,707
With their frequency wires

925
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:21,823
And you can do no wrong

926
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,933
In my eyes

927
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,698
In my eyes

928
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:40,404
You can do no wrong

929
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:49,180
In my eyes

930
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:53,358
In my eyes

931
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,389
A drunken salesman

932
01:18:57,465 --> 01:18:59,399
Your hearing damage

933
01:18:59,467 --> 01:19:01,367
Your mind is restless

934
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,529
They say you're getting better

935
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:06,836
But you don't feel any better

936
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:16,008
Your speakers are blowing

937
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,177
Your ears are wrecking

938
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,153
Your hearing damage

939
01:19:20,221 --> 01:19:22,416
You wish you felt better

940
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:24,754
You wish you felt better

941
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:36,565
You can do no wrong

942
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,611
In my eyes

943
01:19:46,881 --> 01:19:48,439
In my eyes

944
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:52,781
In my eyes

945
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:28,846
Don't do this.

946
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,922
You wanted me to be human.

947
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:39,764
Watch me.

948
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:43,834
Please.

949
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:46,130
For me.

950
01:20:46,207 --> 01:20:48,869
You won't stay with me any other way.

951
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:53,479
Bella, please.

952
01:21:55,977 --> 01:22:02,405
This constant noise all the time

953
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:18,766
Even though you're the only one I see

954
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:22,965
Breathe!

955
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:25,764
Breathe!

956
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,467
Come on, Bella, breathe!

957
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,179
Bella? Bella, can you hear me?

958
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:46,892
Jake?

959
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:49,728
Come here.

960
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:57,502
What the hell were you thinking?

961
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,835
I just wanted to see something.

962
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:05,007
Get her home! I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.

963
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:10,041
What happened at Harry's?

964
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,980
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

965
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,215
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.

966
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,781
Is he okay?

967
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:21,325
He's gone.

968
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:28,560
Come on. I'll get you something dry and drive you home.

969
01:23:39,747 --> 01:23:42,307
108 degrees over here.

970
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,413
God!

971
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,488
My hands are freezing.

972
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,185
It must be nice, never getting cold.

973
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,223
It's a wolf thing.

974
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,361
It's not.

975
01:23:57,999 --> 01:23:59,830
It's a Jacob thing.

976
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,199
You're just warm.

977
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:06,540
You're like your own sun.

978
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:13,808
This is better, now that you know about me.

979
01:24:17,151 --> 01:24:18,379
But...

980
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:26,024
You saw what happened to Emily.

981
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:30,956
Sam got angry.

982
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:34,094
Lost it for a split second.

983
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,596
Em was standing too close.

984
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:42,738
He'll never be able to take that back.

985
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,371
What if I got mad at you?

986
01:24:58,826 --> 01:25:00,293
Sometimes,

987
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,424
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.

988
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,270
Okay, not that you need me

989
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:17,241
to tell you something like this,

990
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,475
but I always will. You're not gonna lose yourself.

991
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,547
I wouldn't let that happen.

992
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:31,052
How?

993
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:36,827
I'll tell you all the time

994
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:42,459
how special you are.

995
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:04,153
Thank you. For everything.

996
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,359
Wait.

997
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:16,864
There's a vampire.

998
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:19,034
How do you know?

999
01:26:19,273 --> 01:26:22,299
I can smell it. I'm getting you out of here.

1000
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:24,702
That's Carlisle's car.

1001
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:27,737
They're here.

1002
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:31,643
Bella, it's a trick! Stop! You gotta come with me!

1003
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:36,850
They won't hurt me.

1004
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:40,325
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.

1005
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:43,162
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.

1006
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:47,292
- I can't protect you here. - Okay. That's okay. You don't have to.

1007
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:51,567
You're about to cross a line.

1008
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:53,573
Then don't draw one.

1009
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,137
Please?

1010
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:13,253
Alice?

1011
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:16,121
- Oh, my God! What are you... - Bella!

1012
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:20,962
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here. Is...

1013
01:27:21,035 --> 01:27:24,334
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?

1014
01:27:25,072 --> 01:27:26,096
What?

1015
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:29,371
I saw a vision of you. You jumped off a cliff.

1016
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,438
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?

1017
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,673
I mean, what about Charlie?

1018
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:36,512
- What about... - I didn't try to kill myself.

1019
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,051
I was cliff jumping.

1020
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,882
Recreationally.

1021
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:41,353
It was fun.

1022
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:47,589
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.

1023
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,192
Does...

1024
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:56,828
Did you tell him?

1025
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:57,962
No.

1026
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,370
He only calls in once every few months.

1027
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:06,242
He said he wants to be alone.

1028
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:15,453
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?

1029
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:17,880
Um...

1030
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:20,489
That's probably me.

1031
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:23,760
Or it's Jacob.

1032
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,398
Jacob who?

1033
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,862
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

1034
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:34,600
Bella! Werewolves are not good company to keep.

1035
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:37,742
Speak for yourself.

1036
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,778
I had to see you were safe.

1037
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,084
I thought you couldn't protect me here.

1038
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:51,120
Guess I don't care.

1039
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,093
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.

1040
01:28:58,699 --> 01:29:00,633
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

1041
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:04,137
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.

1042
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:05,263
Victoria?

1043
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:07,466
Yeah, Victoria's been around.

1044
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,305
I didn't see her.

1045
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:13,337
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.

1046
01:29:14,248 --> 01:29:17,217
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.

1047
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:19,446
Don't get me upset...

1048
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,684
- Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. ...or things are gonna get very ugly.

1049
01:29:29,063 --> 01:29:30,997
I'll give you a minute.

1050
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:38,062
Hey.

1051
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,768
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna come back,

1052
01:29:41,842 --> 01:29:44,606
- right? - As soon as you put the dog out.

1053
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:54,986
Is he...

1054
01:29:59,126 --> 01:30:00,684
Are there others? How many Cullens are here

1055
01:30:00,761 --> 01:30:02,956
and how long are they staying?

1056
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,122
No.

1057
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:06,761
It's just Alice.

1058
01:30:11,405 --> 01:30:14,203
And she can stay as long as she'd like.

1059
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:18,976
Well, are the rest coming back?

1060
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,344
No.

1061
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:29,655
Not that I know of.

1062
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:32,383
Anything else?

1063
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:38,029
That's it.

1064
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:43,897
Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.

1065
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:48,771
I've done it again.

1066
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,905
I keep breaking my promise.

1067
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,915
We don't have to do this to each other.

1068
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:05,916
Yes, we do.

1069
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:19,103
Bella...

1070
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:43,588
Swan residence.

1071
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,463
He's not here right now.

1072
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,073
He's arranging a funeral.

1073
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:11,651
Who was that?

1074
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:12,984
What?

1075
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,857
Always in the way.

1076
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:18,225
Who was that?

1077
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:19,960
Bella, step back.

1078
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:23,231
- Jake, who was that? - Bella! Bella, it's Edward.

1079
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:27,239
He thinks you're dead. Rosalie told him why I came here.

1080
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:32,173
Why would you... Why didn't you let me speak to him?

1081
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:33,440
- He didn't ask for you. - Bella.

1082
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:37,075
- I don't care! - Bella. Bella! He's going to the Volturi.

1083
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:39,652
He wants to die, too.

1084
01:32:41,589 --> 01:32:44,717
JACOB: He left you, Bella. He didn't want you anymore. Remember?

1085
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:48,250
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.

1086
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:50,794
What about your dad?

1087
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:54,732
I'm 18. I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.

1088
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:58,233
Please, Bella,

1089
01:32:59,673 --> 01:33:01,766
just stay here.

1090
01:33:03,544 --> 01:33:05,034
For Charlie.

1091
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,406
Or for me.

1092
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:11,975
I have to go.

1093
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,687
I'm begging you.

1094
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:23,762
Please.

1095
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:27,126
Goodbye, Jacob.

1096
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:36,837
Okay.

1097
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:40,637
So you've made up your minds.

1098
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,343
I'm afraid your particular gifts

1099
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,810
are too valuable to destroy.

1100
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:52,617
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.

1101
01:34:53,754 --> 01:34:57,485
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.

1102
01:34:58,425 --> 01:35:00,985
Won't you consider staying with us?

1103
01:35:02,763 --> 01:35:05,129
You know it will happen anyway.

1104
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,099
Not without cause.

1105
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,930
Such a waste.

1106
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:21,978
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?

1107
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:24,108
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.

1108
01:35:24,184 --> 01:35:25,549
Not today.

1109
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:30,550
What? What do you see?

1110
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:32,524
They refused him.

1111
01:35:32,593 --> 01:35:35,027
- So? - He's gonna make a scene.

1112
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:38,160
- Show himself to the humans. - No! When?

1113
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:42,259
He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.

1114
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:46,233
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.

1115
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:48,207
There's Volterra.

1116
01:36:12,967 --> 01:36:15,800
- Why are they all in red? - San Marco's Day festival.

1117
01:36:15,869 --> 01:36:18,702
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.

1118
01:36:18,772 --> 01:36:20,103
It's the perfect setting.

1119
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,734
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.

1120
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,539
We have five minutes.

1121
01:36:24,611 --> 01:36:26,875
I know, Bella, just breathe.

1122
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:33,976
Alice!

1123
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:36,249
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.

1124
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:39,383
If I go, he'll read my thoughts. He'll think I'm lying. He'll rush into it.

1125
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:43,493
- Where do I go? - He'll be under the clock tower. Go!

1126
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:37,274
Don't!

1127
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:40,506
Heaven.

1128
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,242
You have to move.

1129
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:45,847
Open your eyes. Look at me. I'm alive.

1130
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,349
You have to move.

1131
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:50,451
Bella.

1132
01:38:57,931 --> 01:39:00,024
- You're here. - I'm here.

1133
01:39:02,903 --> 01:39:04,097
You're alive.

1134
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:08,768
Yes.

1135
01:39:18,218 --> 01:39:20,812
I needed to make you see me once.

1136
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:23,152
You had to know that I was alive,

1137
01:39:23,223 --> 01:39:26,351
that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.

1138
01:39:29,229 --> 01:39:31,823
I can let you go now.

1139
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:38,764
I never acted out of guilt.

1140
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:44,700
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.

1141
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:48,138
- But you said... - I lied.

1142
01:39:48,849 --> 01:39:51,943
I had to lie. But you believed me so easily.

1143
01:39:57,591 --> 01:40:01,186
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.

1144
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:07,492
I mean, I'm nothing. I'm human. I'm nothing.

1145
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:12,263
Bella, you're everything to me.

1146
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:15,936
You're everything.

1147
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:43,761
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.

1148
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:45,930
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1149
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:47,234
No rules were broken.

1150
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:51,505
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.

1151
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:52,840
Fine.

1152
01:40:54,147 --> 01:40:56,513
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?

1153
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:57,948
The girl comes with us.

1154
01:40:58,018 --> 01:40:59,713
No. You can go to hell.

1155
01:41:02,089 --> 01:41:03,681
Come on, guys.

1156
01:41:03,924 --> 01:41:07,325
It's a festival. You wouldn't want to make a scene.

1157
01:41:08,161 --> 01:41:09,594
We wouldn't.

1158
01:41:09,963 --> 01:41:11,294
Enough.

1159
01:41:12,866 --> 01:41:13,992
Jane.

1160
01:41:14,801 --> 01:41:17,793
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.

1161
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:27,814
Just do as she says.

1162
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:41,759
Go ahead.

1163
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,427
Don't be scared.

1164
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:49,699
Are you?

1165
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:51,763
No.

1166
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:32,471
- Is she human? - Yes.

1167
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:37,276
Does she know?

1168
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:38,911
Yes.

1169
01:42:39,286 --> 01:42:41,049
Then, why would...

1170
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:44,486
She wants to be.

1171
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:46,357
And so she will be.

1172
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:47,859
Or dessert.

1173
01:42:56,370 --> 01:43:00,170
Sister. They send you out to get one and you bring back two.

1174
01:43:00,907 --> 01:43:02,374
And a half.

1175
01:43:03,543 --> 01:43:04,942
Such a clever girl.

1176
01:43:05,011 --> 01:43:06,911
What a happy surprise!

1177
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:10,609
Bella is alive after all.

1178
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:14,180
Isn't that wonderful?

1179
01:43:15,288 --> 01:43:17,188
I love a happy ending.

1180
01:43:18,291 --> 01:43:19,280
Ah.

1181
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:23,459
They are so rare.

1182
01:43:30,303 --> 01:43:32,828
Her blood appeals to you so much

1183
01:43:34,107 --> 01:43:35,938
it makes me thirsty.

1184
01:43:36,209 --> 01:43:38,973
How can you stand to be so close to her?

1185
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:42,171
- It's not without difficulty. - Yes, I can see that.

1186
01:43:45,585 --> 01:43:49,146
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.

1187
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:52,385
And now you know everything.

1188
01:43:53,026 --> 01:43:54,789
So get on with it.

1189
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:01,128
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.

1190
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:07,035
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1191
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:11,911
Fascinating.

1192
01:44:15,449 --> 01:44:20,819
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.

1193
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:25,684
Would you do me the honor?

1194
01:44:46,546 --> 01:44:47,979
Interesting.

1195
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:49,337
Hmm.

1196
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:51,742
I see nothing.

1197
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:02,618
I wonder if...

1198
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:06,432
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.

1199
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:09,468
Shall we, Jane?

1200
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:13,067
- No! - Pain.

1201
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:30,453
Stop!

1202
01:45:31,291 --> 01:45:33,020
Stop! Please! Stop!

1203
01:45:33,093 --> 01:45:36,961
Stop! Just stop hurting him! Please! Please!

1204
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:39,893
Jane?

1205
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:42,991
Master?

1206
01:45:47,574 --> 01:45:49,303
Go ahead, my dear.

1207
01:45:54,814 --> 01:45:57,009
This may hurt just a little.

1208
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:14,633
Remarkable!

1209
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:19,100
She confounds us all.

1210
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,337
So what do we do with you now?

1211
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:26,971
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.

1212
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:29,846
She knows too much.

1213
01:46:30,383 --> 01:46:32,146
She's a liability.

1214
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,509
Hmm.

1215
01:46:36,122 --> 01:46:37,680
That's true.

1216
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:42,823
Felix?

1217
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:47,791
No!

1218
01:47:49,362 --> 01:47:52,456
Please! No! No! Please, please!

1219
01:47:55,335 --> 01:47:58,463
Kill me! Kill me! Not him.

1220
01:48:09,482 --> 01:48:12,007
How extraordinary.

1221
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:18,157
You would give up your life for someone like us.

1222
01:48:19,259 --> 01:48:20,624
A vampire.

1223
01:48:22,028 --> 01:48:24,462
A soulless monster.

1224
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:26,522
Just get away from her!

1225
01:48:30,637 --> 01:48:35,074
You don't know a thing about his soul.

1226
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:48,381
This is a sadness.

1227
01:48:50,523 --> 01:48:54,084
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.

1228
01:49:03,002 --> 01:49:04,264
Wait!

1229
01:49:05,905 --> 01:49:07,998
Bella will be one of us.

1230
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:11,199
I've seen it.

1231
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:14,913
I'll change her myself.

1232
01:49:48,815 --> 01:49:50,305
Mesmerizing.

1233
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:55,153
To see what you have seen before it has happened.

1234
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:02,551
Your gifts will make for an intriguing

1235
01:50:03,797 --> 01:50:05,230
immortal,

1236
01:50:06,299 --> 01:50:07,823
Isabella.

1237
01:50:12,705 --> 01:50:14,138
Go now.

1238
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:16,809
Make your preparations.

1239
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:19,601
Let us be done with this.

1240
01:50:21,447 --> 01:50:23,711
Heidi will arrive any moment.

1241
01:50:25,585 --> 01:50:28,986
Thank you for your visit.

1242
01:50:29,055 --> 01:50:30,613
We will return the favor.

1243
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:33,659
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.

1244
01:50:33,726 --> 01:50:36,092
We do not offer second chances.

1245
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:40,824
Goodbye, my young friends.

1246
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:49,038
Nice fishing, Heidi.

1247
01:50:49,108 --> 01:50:51,338
Yes, they do look rather juicy.

1248
01:50:51,411 --> 01:50:53,140
Save some for me.

1249
01:50:54,113 --> 01:50:56,911
This way, please. Stay together.

1250
01:51:11,564 --> 01:51:13,088
Stop! Stop!

1251
01:51:23,977 --> 01:51:25,501
You're here.

1252
01:51:27,547 --> 01:51:29,139
You can sleep.

1253
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:35,547
I'll still be here when you wake up.

1254
01:51:39,158 --> 01:51:42,184
Bella, the only reason I left

1255
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:46,898
was because I thought I was protecting you.

1256
01:51:48,768 --> 01:51:50,429
I needed you

1257
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:54,439
to have a chance at a normal, happy life.

1258
01:51:58,544 --> 01:52:00,910
It was so easy for you to leave.

1259
01:52:03,516 --> 01:52:07,179
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.

1260
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,518
And I swear,

1261
01:52:16,863 --> 01:52:19,491
I will never fail you again.

1262
01:52:21,801 --> 01:52:23,359
I'm so sorry.

1263
01:52:25,772 --> 01:52:27,706
- Charlie's coming. - Hey.

1264
01:52:30,843 --> 01:52:32,242
You okay?

1265
01:52:33,646 --> 01:52:34,908
I'm fine.

1266
01:52:38,017 --> 01:52:40,178
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1267
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,711
You know, last time you said that, you took off.

1268
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:44,950
I didn't see you for three days.

1269
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:48,559
I'm really sorry, Dad.

1270
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:54,027
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.

1271
01:52:56,869 --> 01:52:57,961
Ever.

1272
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:02,331
And you're grounded

1273
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:04,936
for the rest of your life.

1274
01:53:06,112 --> 01:53:07,272
Okay.

1275
01:53:17,557 --> 01:53:20,355
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.

1276
01:53:23,363 --> 01:53:26,594
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.

1277
01:53:27,066 --> 01:53:29,364
I came in through the window.

1278
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:35,497
He's not gonna forgive me easily.

1279
01:53:37,977 --> 01:53:39,274
I know.

1280
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:42,679
Can you?

1281
01:53:46,452 --> 01:53:48,010
I hope you can,

1282
01:53:48,821 --> 01:53:52,018
'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.

1283
01:53:56,362 --> 01:53:57,761
Come here.

1284
01:54:15,415 --> 01:54:18,384
Once Alice changes me,

1285
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:23,447
you can't get rid of me.

1286
01:54:24,690 --> 01:54:26,988
She won't need to change you.

1287
01:54:27,593 --> 01:54:31,085
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.

1288
01:54:32,799 --> 01:54:35,199
No. No.

1289
01:54:41,974 --> 01:54:43,965
You all know what I want.

1290
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:49,148
And I know how much I'm asking for.

1291
01:54:51,417 --> 01:54:54,909
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.

1292
01:54:54,987 --> 01:54:58,354
- You don't know what you're talking about. - Shut up.

1293
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:01,153
Alice?

1294
01:55:01,627 --> 01:55:04,187
I already consider you my sister.

1295
01:55:07,967 --> 01:55:09,594
- Yes. - Thank you.

1296
01:55:09,669 --> 01:55:11,159
JASPER: I vote "yes."

1297
01:55:12,605 --> 01:55:16,097
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.

1298
01:55:17,977 --> 01:55:18,966
Hmm.

1299
01:55:19,112 --> 01:55:20,443
I'm sorry.

1300
01:55:22,348 --> 01:55:25,476
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted,

1301
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:28,178
and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough

1302
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:30,347
to go and save my brother.

1303
01:55:31,891 --> 01:55:35,327
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.

1304
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:41,527
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.

1305
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:45,836
So, no.

1306
01:55:47,273 --> 01:55:49,173
I vote "Hell, yeah."

1307
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:53,476
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.

1308
01:55:53,546 --> 01:55:56,515
I already consider you a part of the family.

1309
01:55:57,150 --> 01:55:58,378
Yes.

1310
01:56:04,257 --> 01:56:06,487
Why are you doing this to me?

1311
01:56:08,194 --> 01:56:09,559
You know what this means.

1312
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:13,497
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.

1313
01:56:14,233 --> 01:56:16,133
I won't lose my son.

1314
01:56:22,341 --> 01:56:26,368
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.

1315
01:56:31,384 --> 01:56:34,319
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.

1316
01:56:41,294 --> 01:56:43,387
He wants to talk to me.

1317
01:56:46,532 --> 01:56:48,159
So you're still alive for now.

1318
01:56:48,234 --> 01:56:50,702
He thinks it's me keeping you away.

1319
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:53,261
You stay the hell out of my head.

1320
01:56:54,373 --> 01:56:57,865
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.

1321
01:57:00,213 --> 01:57:04,115
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.

1322
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:06,650
Thank you.

1323
01:57:09,789 --> 01:57:13,190
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.

1324
01:57:13,726 --> 01:57:15,819
No. You didn't.

1325
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:20,492
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.

1326
01:57:20,566 --> 01:57:22,431
I'm still grateful.

1327
01:57:23,002 --> 01:57:24,230
But I'm here now.

1328
01:57:24,303 --> 01:57:27,033
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.

1329
01:57:27,106 --> 01:57:28,437
We'll see.

1330
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:33,471
Hey, my turn to talk.

1331
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:41,577
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.

1332
01:57:41,754 --> 01:57:43,619
I haven't forgotten.

1333
01:57:43,689 --> 01:57:45,247
What key point?

1334
01:57:45,491 --> 01:57:47,789
If any of them bites a human,

1335
01:57:48,561 --> 01:57:50,324
the truce is over.

1336
01:57:51,731 --> 01:57:53,562
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.

1337
01:57:53,633 --> 01:57:55,658
No. No, I won't let you.

1338
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,704
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.

1339
01:57:59,772 --> 01:58:01,672
It's not up to you.

1340
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:04,741
You know what we'll do to you. I won't have a choice.

1341
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:06,505
Bella, please, come.

1342
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:07,739
Wait.

1343
01:58:09,715 --> 01:58:12,309
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.

1344
01:58:19,659 --> 01:58:20,990
Jake,

1345
01:58:27,433 --> 01:58:29,025
I love you.

1346
01:58:33,739 --> 01:58:35,400
So, please,

1347
01:58:39,979 --> 01:58:42,038
don't make me choose,

1348
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:49,754
'cause it'll be him.

1349
01:58:53,125 --> 01:58:54,990
It's always been him.

1350
01:59:02,468 --> 01:59:03,799
Bella...

1351
01:59:11,577 --> 01:59:14,705
- Goodbye, Jacob. - No, you don't speak for her!

1352
01:59:19,485 --> 01:59:21,476
Bella, get out of here.

1353
01:59:23,255 --> 01:59:24,620
Stop!

1354
01:59:26,826 --> 01:59:28,123
Stop!

1355
01:59:28,194 --> 01:59:31,254
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.

1356
01:59:50,282 --> 01:59:51,408
Jake.

1357
02:00:06,465 --> 02:00:07,898
He's right.

1358
02:00:09,034 --> 02:00:11,468
You shouldn't become what I am.

1359
02:00:16,675 --> 02:00:18,336
I can't do this alone.

1360
02:00:21,013 --> 02:00:22,981
Then, please, just wait.

1361
02:00:29,989 --> 02:00:32,617
Just give me five years.

1362
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:39,857
That's too long.

1363
02:00:44,336 --> 02:00:45,803
Then three?

1364
02:00:50,509 --> 02:00:52,306
You're so stubborn.

1365
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:56,273
What are you waiting for?

1366
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:08,084
I have one condition

1367
02:01:10,563 --> 02:01:13,031
if you want me to do it myself.

1368
02:01:17,169 --> 02:01:19,000
What's the condition?

1369
02:01:19,605 --> 02:01:21,300
And then forever.

1370
02:01:23,075 --> 02:01:24,975
That's what I'm asking.

1371
02:01:36,322 --> 02:01:37,983
Marry me, Bella.

1372
02:04:12,544 --> 02:04:16,412
White demon love song down the hall

1373
02:04:18,117 --> 02:04:22,451
White demon shadow on the road

1374
02:04:23,656 --> 02:04:27,752
Back up your mind, there is a call

1375
02:04:29,161 --> 02:04:32,892
He isn't coming after all

1376
02:04:32,965 --> 02:04:35,160
Love this time

1377
02:04:35,234 --> 02:04:39,398
She likes the way he sings

1378
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:44,198
White demon love song's in her dreams

1379
02:04:48,447 --> 02:04:52,679
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?

1380
02:04:53,986 --> 02:04:58,355
White demon sorrow will arrange

1381
02:04:59,525 --> 02:05:03,689
Let's not forget about the fear

1382
02:05:04,997 --> 02:05:10,401
Black invitation to this place that cannot change

1383
02:05:10,469 --> 02:05:15,702
While strangely holy

1384
02:05:15,941 --> 02:05:19,138
Come for a rain

1385
02:05:24,650 --> 02:05:29,713
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1386
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:35,627
White demon, who let your friend go?

1387
02:05:35,694 --> 02:05:40,563
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1388
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:47,969
White demon, who let your friend go?

1389
02:05:50,843 --> 02:05:56,304
- Let us be in love - Let us be in love

1390
02:05:56,381 --> 02:06:01,785
- Let's do old and gray - Let's do old and gray

1391
02:06:01,854 --> 02:06:07,315
- I won't make you cry - I won't make you cry

1392
02:06:07,392 --> 02:06:12,830
- I will never stray - I will never stray

1393
02:06:12,898 --> 02:06:18,359
- I will do my part - I will do my part

1394
02:06:18,437 --> 02:06:23,966
Let us be in love tonight

1395
02:06:24,042 --> 02:06:29,344
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1396
02:06:29,414 --> 02:06:34,545
White demon, who let your friend go?

1397
02:06:34,987 --> 02:06:40,050
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1398
02:06:40,526 --> 02:06:47,159
White demon, who let your friend go?

1399
02:07:03,215 --> 02:07:07,447
Stand it anymore, darling

1400
02:07:08,587 --> 02:07:09,952
Stand it

1401
02:07:18,964 --> 02:07:22,866
Meet me on the equinox

1402
02:07:22,935 --> 02:07:25,733
Meet me halfway

1403
02:07:25,804 --> 02:07:29,103
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1404
02:07:29,174 --> 02:07:32,940
In the middle of the day

1405
02:07:33,011 --> 02:07:36,412
Let me give my love to you

1406
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:39,679
Let me take your hand

1407
02:07:40,118 --> 02:07:43,576
As we walk in the dimming light

1408
02:07:43,655 --> 02:07:46,783
Oh, darling, understand

1409
02:07:47,226 --> 02:07:52,186
That everything, everything ends

1410
02:07:54,266 --> 02:07:59,863
That everything, everything ends

1411
02:08:05,177 --> 02:08:08,874
Meet me on your best behavior

1412
02:08:08,947 --> 02:08:11,848
Meet me at your worst

1413
02:08:11,917 --> 02:08:15,478
For there will be no stone unturned

1414
02:08:15,554 --> 02:08:18,523
Or bubble left to burst

1415
02:08:19,191 --> 02:08:22,752
Let me lay beside you, darling

1416
02:08:23,262 --> 02:08:26,254
Let me be your man

1417
02:08:26,331 --> 02:08:29,767
And let our bodies intertwine

1418
02:08:29,835 --> 02:08:33,362
But always understand

1419
02:08:33,438 --> 02:08:38,705
That everything, everything ends

1420
02:08:40,445 --> 02:08:46,179
That everything, everything ends

1421
02:08:47,486 --> 02:08:54,221
That everything, everything, everything ends

1422
02:08:58,130 --> 02:09:00,724
A window

1423
02:09:01,667 --> 02:09:05,398
An opened tomb

1424
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:08,234
The sun crawls

1425
02:09:08,307 --> 02:09:11,936
Across your bedroom

1426
02:09:12,377 --> 02:09:14,572
A halo

1427
02:09:15,914 --> 02:09:19,441
A waiting room

1428
02:09:19,518 --> 02:09:22,453
Your last breaths

1429
02:09:22,521 --> 02:09:25,115
Moving through you

1430
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:30,457
As everything, everything ends

1431
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:37,627
As everything, everything, everything

1432
02:09:37,703 --> 02:09:44,131
Everything, everything, everything ends

1433
02:09:49,982 --> 02:09:53,782
Meet me on the equinox

1434
02:09:54,152 --> 02:09:56,746
Meet me halfway

1435
02:09:56,822 --> 02:10:00,280
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1436
02:10:00,359 --> 02:10:03,624
In the middle of the day

1437
02:10:04,162 --> 02:10:08,098
Let me give my love to you

1438
02:10:08,166 --> 02:10:10,691
Let me take your hand

1439
02:10:11,269 --> 02:10:14,568
And as we walk in the dimming light

1440
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:17,802
Oh, darling, understand

1441
02:10:17,943 --> 02:10:24,473
That everything, everything ends
