"我们现在居住在哪"

3
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:33,065
能源即污染的状况已经持续一段时间了
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.

4
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:35,776
开灯与否也曾经是个艰难选择
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.

5
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:37,736
城市里的灯火管制...

食物短缺 车辆靠吞油而行

但这些都已成往事

我们现在在哪 是如何使这个世界如此多娇
Where are we now? How do we make the world so much better?

连沙漠都能迸发蓬勃生机

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,919
此刻  我们就是世界最大的混合能源生产商
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.

11
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:56,589
太阳能投射到月岩 被其所捕获

12
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,133
再由月球远端的机器所开采

13
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,763
今日 地球所需能源总量的70％可由
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3...

14
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:07,516
我们开采的清洁能源氦-3所供给
to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.

15
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:11,812
当时谁会想到 我们急需的能源
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed

16
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:13,606
其实抬头可见

17

月能
The power of the moon...

I have a full container full of helium-3, ready to roll.

44
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,431

你知道 那可是相当相当相当相当的漫长
You know? It's way, way, way, way, way too long!

54
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,461
我在习惯性地
I'm talking to myself...

该死的 我说过我来做
God damn it! I said I got it!

62
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,712
你就不能听我的话么

货物准备发射

山姆?      干吗?

00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,506
你今天看上去和平时不大一样
You don't seem like yourself today.

67
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:56,634
出问题了吗      没有 你能把它关了吗
Is something wrong?        No. Can you turn that off, please?

68
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,594
天啊
Jesus Christ!

69
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,016
山姆 和我聊聊也许会有用
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.

70
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,938
柯里 你有没有关于维修月星的新消息
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?

71
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:11,690
没有 山姆
No, Sam.

72
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:13,692
据我所知 在公司优先名单上
From what I understand, it is fairly low...

73
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,112
该项目现排名低至可忽略不计
on the company's priority list right now.

74
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:17,696
你得叫他们解决掉
You tell them to sort that out.

75
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,199
你知道我在说什么 对吧
You know what I'm talking about? That's not?

76
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:22,368
我只剩两周 无所谓了
I've only got two weeks!

77
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:25,496
但对于轮班的人来说可就不公平了
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.

78
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,250
好的 山姆 需要我等会再帮你剪头发吗
I will, Sam. Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?

79
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,335
不 继续剪吧
No, come on; let's finish this.

80
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,465
又头疼了
Got one of those headaches...

81
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:38,759

我也很想你
I miss you, too!

89
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:28,893
我知道你在上面很孤独
I know you're really lonely up there...

90
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:32,646
但我想 从很多角度看
But I think... In a lot of ways....

91
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:35,357
其实这样对你更好

对我们都好
For both of us.

93
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:41,113
天 希望你别介意我这么说
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.

94
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:45,993
我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you!

95
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:49,330
有人想和你说两句
Someone has got something to say.

96
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,043
想和爸爸说什么 宝宝
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?

97
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,797
说"宇航员"
Say "astronaut".

98
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:00,382
宇航员
Astronaut.

99
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,468
他是一个宇航员
He is an astronaut!

100
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:06,222
说爸爸是宇航员 大声点

105
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:21,153
真不敢相信你马上就能回家啦
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.

106
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,782
下个月她就过生日了
It's her birthday next month...

107
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,119
我在想 也许该在花园里给她建个玩具屋
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.

108
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,413
柯里      我们可以一起去布置
Gerty!        We could work at it together.

109
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,706

You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?

118
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:20,880
凯斯
Kath...

119
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:41,108
不太秒
Not good!

120
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:43,611
那大象怎么样
What about Dumbo?...

121
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,281
日
Fuck!

122
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:31,075
见鬼
God damn it!

123
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:32,743
我日
Fuck!

124
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:37,206
我又犯傻了 是吧 柯里
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?

125
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:41,085
山姆 我能问问发生什么了吗      我告诉过你了
Sam, can I ask how it happened?        I told you.

126
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:44,630
我光顾着看电视然后开水烫到手了
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.

127
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,425
你看电视?
You saw something on TV?

128
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,136
对 电视让我分神了
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.

129
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,221
这有什么问题吗 柯里
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?

130
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:55,141
山姆 你说你被电视分神了
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you...

131
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:57,852
但我进来时 电视是关着的
but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.

132
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,271
也许是你出现幻觉了
Perhaps you were imagining things?

133
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,276
哈 你想太多了 伙计
Yeah, you think too much, pal.

134
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:10,281
你需要躺会 我得继续干活
You need to get laid. I'm going to go back to work.

135
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:06,253
丫闭嘴
Shut up!

136
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:41,205

How are you today?        Fine!

139
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,001
不错
Fine.

140
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,295
手怎么样      噢 还有点疼
How is the hand?        Oh, it's a little sore!

141
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:50,256
一点点 没事
A little sore. It's OK.

142
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:56,011
早餐想吃什么      和平时一样
What's for breakfast?        The usual.

143
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:57,054
嗯哼
Mmhmm.

144
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:04,645
还剩两周 山姆      还剩两周 老兄
Two weeks to go, Sam.        Two weeks to go, buddy!

145
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,773
要在豆子上浇点热沙司吗
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?

146
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,318
不用 实际上我的胃有点小毛病
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.

147
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:15,489
不过 还是谢啦 柯里
But, thank you. Thank you, Gerty.

148
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:16,741
不客气 山姆
You're welcome, Sam.

149
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:21,537
8点19分 太平洋时间 数据如下
08:19, Pacific Time. Readouts are as follows...

150
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:24,582
马修号 9.8英里
Matthew ... 9.8 miles.

151
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,959
马克号距离更近?
Mark is less?

152
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,044
9...      嘿 柯里
9...        Hey, Gerty!

153
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,547
干活咯
Rock and roll!

154
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,602
马克号 嗯...
Mark,mmm...

155
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,813
仪表显示马克号距离11英里
Mark is 11 miles on the button.

156
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:53,152
卢克号今天有点小着急
Luke is a little twitchy today.

157
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:07,833
嗨 柯里
Hey, Gerty.

158
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:11,295
看上去好像马修号又装满了一罐能源
Looks like we have got a live one out on Matthew.

159
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,880
我要出去几分钟
I'm going to go out in a few minutes.

160
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,966
就当出去喝杯咖啡 好吗
I'm just going to finish my coffee, OK?

161
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:16,801
好的 山姆
OK, Sam.

162
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,433
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

163
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:30,564
信号搜索失败
Signal failure on long-range comms.

164
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,219
危险 空气外泄
Danger. Atmosphere compromised.

165
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,420
我在哪...
Where am...

166
00:18:17,254 --> 00:18:20,591
我在哪里      山姆 你在医务室
Where am I?        Sam, you're in the infirmary.

167
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,428
你出了事故 还记得怎么回事吗
You had an accident. Do you remember what happened?

168
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:33,187
不 我...一点都记不得了
No, I don't... I don't remember a thing.

169
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:36,941
你还记得我吗
Do you remember me?

170
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,611
当然记得你 柯里
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.

171
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:42,988
很好 好极了
That's good. That is very good.

172
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,491
好高兴看到你清醒过来
It's nice to see you awake again.

173
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:49,578
我得让你在医务室待两天接受观察
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days

174
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:51,664
再进行些测试
And run some tests.

175
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:55,209
我昏迷多久了
How long have I been out?

176
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,546
不久 山姆 你再睡一会吧
Not long, Sam. Go back to sleep.

177
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:01,715
好的 伙计      你还是很劳累
OK, pal.        You're still very tired.

178
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,342
我们以后再谈
We can talk later.

179
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:43,466
有人吗
Hello?

180
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,950
新山姆正在重新修订指令
The new Sam is in reworking order.

181
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,079
但我们只剩两台可供使用的采能车
But we only have two working harvesters now.

182
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,081
是啊 真是意外啊
Yeah, well,what a surprise!

183
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:19,043
柯里 我们得想办法提高产量
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.

184
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:20,503
我知道
I know.

185
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:23,172
真是难以置信 但你如何在一天时间里...
This is incredible! But how do you manage to destroy...

186
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:26,967
同时销毁一辆探路车一台采能车和一名员工呢
a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?

187
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:29,970
正如您所知 这是突发状况
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.

188
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:32,389
柯里 3号采能车状况怎么样
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?

189
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,350
维修进展怎么...
How do the repairs look on...

190
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:37,269
山姆 你下床了      是啊
Sam, you're out of bed.        Yeah.

191
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:41,440
我想舒展下两条腿 刚才是谁
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit. Who was that?

192
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,071
月星出了点问题
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...

193
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,281
所以能源传递可能得暂停了
And our live feed seems to be down.

194
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,992
我已经录制了中心的视频信息
I was recording a video-message for Central...

195
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:54,370
并将其更新在你的进度上
Updating them on your progress.

196
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,455
山姆 你需要待在床上休息
Sam, you need to stay in bed.

197
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:59,291
你还没做好下床走动的准备
You're not ready to walk around yet.

198
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:05,005
能把我的太阳眼镜拿来吗 这里太亮了
Can you bring me my sunglasses? It's really bright in here.

199
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,927
给我点...把我的东西都拿来 你知道的
Give me some... Give me all my stuff, you know?

200
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:12,930
你的私人物品都在你的住宿区 山姆
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.

201
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:16,475
那就把它们挪过来      好的
Well, bring them in here.        Certainly.

202
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,405
好极了 山姆
Excellent, Sam.

203
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:35,453
我...我可以离开这了吗 柯里
What... When can I get out of here, Gerty?

204
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:38,706
山姆 撞车时你的脑部可能受伤了
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.

205
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,126
所以你短期记忆失忆 逻辑混乱
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.

206
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:47,548
那诊断结论是什么 我什么时候可以回去工作
So what's the diagnosis? When can I get back to work?

207
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,176
中心已经要求我减缓采能进度
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters...

208
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:53,304
以确保你有足够时间痊愈
to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.

209
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,430
这很好
That's terrific!

210
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:56,515
非常棒
That's fantastic!

211
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,809
你明天就可以回你的住宿区
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.

212
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:00,728
但要想恢复到正常的工作状态
But it will still be a few more days

213
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:03,606
还需要几天时间
before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.

214
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,442
我们进行下一个测试
Let's try another test.

215
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,693
我不想再做什么测试
I don't want to try another test!

216
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:10,196
拜托了 山姆
Please, Sam.

217
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,391
嘿 柯里
Hey, Gerty?

218
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:44,063
你知道这个吗
Do you know about this?

219
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,567
马修号的读数一点反映也没有 它已经完全沉寂了
Matthew has got no velocity readout. He is completely still.

220
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,444
它一定是抛锚了
He must have stalled.

221
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:51,862
是的 明显是抛锚了
Well, he has obviously stalled.

222
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,155
你不认为我们该告诉中心么
Don't you think we should tell Central?

223
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:55,449
给门解锁 我要出去修修看
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.

224
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,952
我会传达你的意见
I will pass on your message.

225
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,912
经"朱庇特"中转 地球方面已收到信息
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.

226
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,539
山姆 我们很感谢你的提议
Sam, we appreciate the offer,

227
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,875
但你最好以康复为第一要务
but you concentrate on feeling better.

228
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,502
是的 我们不想让你承担不必要的风险
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.

229
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,213
对我们来说你太重要了      保持原状
You are too important to us.        You stay put.

230
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:53,007
这是命令
That is an order.

231
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,092
这是命令 山姆 月星总部的命令
It's an order, Sam... from Lunar.

232
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:57,136
我们的下一步行动是输送一组救援小队过来
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit...

233
00:23:57,178 --> 00:24:00,097
帮助修理采能车 以使它能自己返回基地
to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.

234
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:03,434
操他娘的 妈的      抱歉 山姆
Fuck is with...? What the fuck?        I'm sorry, Sam.

235
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,727
什么      山姆...
What?        Sam...

236
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:07,605
我必须服从直接命令 禁止你外出
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.

237
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:11,984
我可不喜欢被当成个小孩子对待
I don't appreciate that was being treated like a child.

238
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,235
不喜欢
I don't appreciate it.

239
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:52,525
柯里
Gerty!

240
00:24:58,155 --> 00:24:59,198
柯里
Gerty!

241
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:00,991
柯里 过来
Gerty, come here!

242
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:04,412
怎么了      我不知道 也许被陨石击中了
What happened?        I do not know, maybe a meteorite...

243
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,705
这里没有陨石 山姆
There have been no meteorites, Sam.

244
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,707
陨石微粒 也许吧 我不知道
Micrometeorites, maybe. I do not know.

245
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:11,210
不管怎样 也许外层护罩也被损坏了
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.

246
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:14,004
我想你最好...最好让我出去查查
I think you better... you better let me go outside and take a look.

247
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,298
外层护罩没有损坏
There is no damage to the exterior shell.

248
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:18,509
好吧 也许没有 但我不相信 柯里
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...

249
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,637
可是 你看 这玩意漏得像个消防喷头一样
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.

250
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,140
你得让我出去解决问题 柯里
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.

251
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,308
我不能让你出去 山姆
I can't let you go outside, Sam.

252
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,562
柯里 你要是不让我出去 我们就不能修复泄露
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.

253
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:31,689
我被禁止允许你外出
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.

254
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:34,650
就让我...你知我知天知地知 怎么样 伙计
Just let... We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?

255
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,778
这可是气体外泄 出发吧 来吧
This thing is leaking gas. Let's go! Come on...

256
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:40,740
就去查查外层护罩吗
Just to check the exterior shell?

257
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,575
那当然      好吧 山姆
Of course.        OK, Sam.

258
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,743
谢谢
Thank you.

259
00:25:58,215 --> 00:25:59,175
柯里
Gerty!

260
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,127
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

261
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:39,298
远距通讯信号搜索中

262
00:26:41,926 --> 00:26:43,886

264
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:50,805
柯里
Gerty!

265
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:52,139
柯里
Gerty!

266
00:28:55,392 --> 00:28:56,519
我在外面找到他了
I found him outside!

267
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,481
我在外面找到他了
I found him outside!

268
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,360
就在那个抛锚的采能车边上
Near one of the stalled harvesters...

269
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:05,611
他是谁
Who is he?

270
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:07,238
他是谁?!
Who is he?!

271
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,031
我们得把他带回医务室
We need to get him to the infirmary.

272
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,284
除非你告诉我他是谁
Not until you tell me who that is.

273
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,370
告诉我他是谁!
You tell me who that is!

274
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:19,041

医务室
The infirmary.

279
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,777
你在一台采能车那遇到事故了
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.

280
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,028
你还记得吗
Do you remember?

281
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:51,574
不记得 我好渴
No, I'm thirsty.

282
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,493
我去给你倒点水
I could get you some water.

283
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,169
我在外面看到个人 柯里
I saw someone out there, Gerty.

284
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:09,717
我在外面看到个人
I saw someone out there.

285
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:13,804
山姆 你在撞击中遭受轻微脑震荡
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash

286
00:30:13,804 --> 00:30:15,139
以及不可治愈的局部损伤
and have incurred minor injuries.

287
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,975
但重点是 医疗预计是好的
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.

288
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:22,354
很高兴再次看到你
I'm happy to see you again.

289
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:47,463

00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:54,678
房间里是不是还有个人和我们在一起
Is there someone in the room with us?

292
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:00,392
山姆 该睡会了
Sam, get some sleep.

293
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:03,521
你太疲劳了
You're very tired.

294
00:31:27,837 --> 00:31:29,380
今天说到汤普森了
Spoke to Thompson today.

295
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:33,342
他们在欧洲 向全世界许诺
They are in Europe, they are promising the world.

296
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:42,101
我觉得那是正确的
I think it was the right thing.

297
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,566
但是...太漫长了
But... it's just such a long time.

298
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:54,530
我觉得 是时候...
I suppose there are things...

299
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:59,410
你知道...是时候做些什么了
You know... that needed to happen.

300
00:32:01,495 --> 00:32:03,914
我需要时间考虑
I need time to think.

301
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,630
听着...呃...
Listen... umm...

302
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:13,716

注意安全...我会...
Be safe... And I'll...

304
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,430
我会再和你联系的
I'll talk to you soon.

305
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:21,515
再见
Goodbye.

306
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:52,922
柯里
Gerty?

307
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:56,675
柯里 他妈的到底怎么回事
Gerty, what the fuck, what the hell's going on?

308
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:00,513
他是谁 康乐室里这人是谁
Who is the guy? Who is the guy in the rec room?

309
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,807
他从哪来 为什么长得和我一样
Where did he come from? Why does he look like me?

310
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:05,017
山姆 你下床了
Sam, you're out out of bed.

311
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:07,937
没错 柯里 我下床了 他是谁
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed. Who is the guy?

312
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,605
康乐室里那人是谁
Who is the guy in the rec room?

313
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:12,817
山姆・贝尔      快告诉我吧
Sam Bell.        Come on, come on, come on!

314
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:15,653
你是山姆・贝尔
You are Sam Bell.

315
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:19,698
山姆 怎么了
Sam, what is it?

316
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,118
也许谈谈对你有帮助
It might help to talk about it.

317
00:33:23,244 --> 00:33:24,703
我不明白发生什么了
I don't understand what is happening...

318
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:28,249
我觉得我开始丧失理智了
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.

319
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,625
我们可以做些测试
We can run some tests.

320
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:32,545
我没有让山姆联系月星
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.

321
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,714
他们不知道你从事故中逃生
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.

322
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:39,009
"逃生"? 什么意思 你为什么不向中心报告
"Recovered alive"? What do you mean? Why did not you report it to Central?

323
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:39,927
你究竟在说什么
What are you talking about?

324
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:41,804
我在这儿保证你的安全 山姆
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

325
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,432
你饿吗
Are you hungry?

326
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:23,220
两周 两周 两周
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks

327
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:29,185
两周 两周 两周 两周
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks,

328
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:30,311
两周 两周 两周
two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...

329
00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:59,381
我只是过来拿我的拖鞋...      我在用
I'm just getting my slippers...        I'm using them... I'm using them.

330
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:02,635
那是我的
These are mine.

331
00:35:13,771 --> 00:35:15,648
柯里说你是山姆・贝尔
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.

332
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:18,901
我也是山姆・贝尔!
I'm Sam Bell, too!

333
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:22,655
什么      好吧 就是这样子
What?        Well, we've got that going for us.

334
00:35:25,032 --> 00:35:26,283
为什么...
Why...?

335
00:35:32,248 --> 00:35:33,582
你已经...多久了
How long have you been...

336
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,584
什么
What?

337
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,128
你已经在这多久了
How long have you been here?

338
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:39,004
大约一周
About a week.

339
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:42,466
那你都做得怎样      什么
So how are you doing?        What?

340
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:44,135
你做得怎样
How are you doing?

341
00:35:46,303 --> 00:35:47,888
"我做得怎样"
"How am I doing?"

342
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,268
你觉得我做的怎样
How do you think I'm doing?

343
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:05,823
他们封锁了所有出口 谁在照看采能车
They locked all the exits. Who's looking after the harvesters?

344
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,619
采能车没事
Harvesters are fine.

345
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,082
事实上 我在这对着克隆说话才有事
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.

346
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:18,210
我不是克隆
I'm not a clone.

347
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,255
我不是克隆
I'm not a clone!

348
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:30,723
你才是      好吧 山姆
You're the clone.        Okay, Sam.

349
00:36:31,682 --> 00:36:33,142
你不是克隆
You're not a clone.

350
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:44,612
嘿嘿 你看上去不太好
Hey, hey... You're not looking too good.

351
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:50,451
嘘 就当我放屁 我啥都没说过 伙计
Sh! Butt out of this! I'm not even talking to you, pal.

352
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:55,039
我觉得凯瑟琳对你有意思 我觉得她喜欢你
I think that Katherine likes you. I think she likes you a bit.

353
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:57,416
你看上去不太好 朋友
You're not looking too good, my friend.

354
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,210
希望你感觉别太糟
I hope you're not feeling too bad.

355
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,628
你在自言自语?
Are you talking to yourself?

356
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:02,838
让我们来帮你解决问题      你在这里多久了
Let's just get you fixed up...        How long have you been here?

357
00:37:04,924 --> 00:37:07,635
大约...三年了
Well, it's about... three years.

358
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:09,303
快到三年了
For almost three years.

359
00:37:11,514 --> 00:37:12,431
听着 我...
Listen, I...

360
00:37:14,016 --> 00:37:15,142
我想谢谢你
I wanted to thank you?

361
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:18,813
我想谢谢你 呃
I wanted to thank you for, um...

362
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:22,566
要不是有你 我...
If it wasn't for you, I'd...

363
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,529
我估计现在还躺在瘫痪的探路车里 你救了我
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover. You saved my life.

364
00:37:31,117 --> 00:37:32,576
我知道这很古怪...
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?

365
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:37,164
我真的很孤独 你知道的 我...
I'm real lonely, you know, I...

366
00:37:37,998 --> 00:37:40,584
我只想同你握下手 你愿意吗
I just wanted to shake your hand. Will you shake my hand?

367
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:49,552
也许以后吧
Maybe later.

368
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:57,893
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

369
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,438
你看上去和我一模一样 太不可思议了
You look just like me; it's incredible.

370
00:38:01,147 --> 00:38:02,398
为什么是我看上去像你?
Why do I look like you?

371
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:03,733
为什么不是你看上去像我?
Why don't you look like me?

372
00:38:04,692 --> 00:38:06,569
也许我们看上去都很像 我不知道
We look like each other, I guess. I don't know.

373
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:08,529
嘿 你知道...
Hey, you know...

375
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:21,792

What's the score?        2-18.

380
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:40,561

382
00:38:45,649 --> 00:38:47,651
我不需要你来教
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!

383

00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:19,433
你得换个方式来处理
You should approach this in a different way.

393
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:23,729
还记得你去飞行学校吗      你在干吗
Remember when you went to flight school?        What are you doing?

394
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:25,189

00:40:32,423 --> 00:40:34,633
那你知道夏娃吗      什么
You know about Eve, right?        What?

409
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:37,219
我有个...我们有个女儿...
I had a... We had a girl...

410
00:40:40,264 --> 00:40:41,182
夏娃
Eve.

411
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:46,103
她漂亮吧
Ain't she beautiful?

412
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,189
她可是我的小猴子
She's my little monkey.

413
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:50,149
我们的小猴子
She's our little monkey.

414
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,486
来击个掌
High five!

415
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:02,161
也许她是送奶工的 但她很漂亮
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.

416
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:07,583
山姆 来自地球的新信息
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.

417
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:09,460
噢该死
Oh shit!

418
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:17,802
你好 山姆      我们的人怎样
Greetings, Sam.        How's our man?

419
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:18,844
你觉得好点了吗
You feeling better?

420
00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:21,013
休息够了吗      痊愈了吧 山姆
Have you had enough rest?        You resting up, Sam?

421
00:41:21,347 --> 00:41:22,807
最好痊愈了 你个混蛋
You better be, you bastard.

422
00:41:23,224 --> 00:41:25,393
好好享受吧 我们有些好消息
Well, enjoy it while it lasts. We've got some good news.

423
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:28,354
朱庇特项目不得不中断了
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus,

424
00:41:28,354 --> 00:41:30,064
我们给你派了些人手
so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.

425
00:41:30,314 --> 00:41:33,943
现在我们所关注的就是给你安排一组救援小队
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.

426
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:35,403
伊莱扎救援小组
Rescue Unit Eliza.

427
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:38,072
过去两周里伊莱扎被布署在
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19

428
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:39,073
轨道起重机"歌利亚-19"上
for the last 2 months.

429
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:41,867
预计14个小时后到达
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.

430
00:41:42,076 --> 00:41:43,661
开始欢呼吧
So commence to jump for joy!

431
00:41:43,744 --> 00:41:44,995
你马上就能回去工作了
You're about to be back at work.

432
00:41:45,538 --> 00:41:47,706
至于目前 就先等着
In the meantime, hang in there.

433
00:41:48,249 --> 00:41:49,166
休息下
Rest up.

434
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,168
坚持住 山姆 通话结束
You hang in there, Sam. Over and out!

435
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:55,005
他们派救援小队来? 为什么 为什么要这样做
They're sending a rescue unit? Why? Why are they sending a rescue unit?

436
00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:58,759
为了修好抛锚的采能车 他们不认为我搞得定
To fix the stalled harvester. They didn't think I was up to it.

437
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:00,344
很好 然后我就可以回去了
Well, then I'm going back.

438
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,012
是我回去
That's it for me.

439
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:05,641
什么      你真这样以为?
What?        Is that what you really think?

440
00:42:06,267 --> 00:42:08,352
没错 我有合同
Yeah. I've got a contract!

441
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:10,020
我要回家
I'm going home.

442
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:13,899
你就他妈一克隆 屎都不是      嘿 我要回家了
You're a fucking clone. You don't have shit.        Hey, I'm going home!

443
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:15,860
回家      你哪都去不了
Home!        You're not going anywhere.

444
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:18,696
你知道 你待在上头太久了 都开始丧失理智了
You know, you've been up here too long, man. You have lost your marbles.

445
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:20,281
你以为呢 苔丝躺在家里沙发上
What do you think, Tess is back home,

446
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:22,283
穿着蕾丝睡衣等你?
waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?

447
00:42:22,324 --> 00:42:23,576
那个原版的山姆怎么办 嗯?
What about the original Sam? Huh?

448
00:42:25,453 --> 00:42:26,829
我才是原版的山姆
I am the original Sam!

449
00:42:27,747 --> 00:42:29,415
我才他妈的是山姆・贝尔      嗨
I am Sam-fucking-Bell.        Hey!

450
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,458
我才是
Me!

451
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,460
我
Me!

452
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:36,213
柯里 我是克隆吗
Gerty, am I a clone?

453
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:40,176
你饿吗
Are you hungry?

454
00:42:46,098 --> 00:42:47,266
嗨 嗨
Hey, hey...

455
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:53,189
你别他妈的搞不清状况 我俩现在一条船上 混蛋
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist. I'm in the same boat, asshole.

456
00:42:58,819 --> 00:42:59,862
听着
Listen...

457
00:42:59,987 --> 00:43:01,655
其他的克隆人怎么办      什么
What about the other clones?        What?

458
00:43:01,864 --> 00:43:03,824
也许我们不是仅有的被激活的两个
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.

459
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,744
你是说当你在这时那个模型就已经做了一半了?
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.

460
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:07,787
那么 是谁干的
Well, who started it?

461
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:10,206
也许是之前来这里的人
There might be others up here right now.

462
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,211
仔细想想 你撞车后我怎么会这么快就到达这里
Think about it. How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?

463
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:18,214
我不知道      他们就没有从中心把我装船
I don't know...        They didn't ship me in from Central.

464
00:43:18,631 --> 00:43:20,716
没有时间 我一定是从基地里来的
There wasn't time. I must have come from the base.

465
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:24,428
我听不懂你的意思
I don't know what you're smoking.

466
00:43:24,428 --> 00:43:26,222
为什么他们要那样做 太荒唐了
Why would they do that? That's ridiculous.

467
00:43:26,764 --> 00:43:27,932
不可能
Impossible.

468
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:30,226
我猜这里肯定有个密室
I bet there's some kind of secret room.

469
00:43:30,226 --> 00:43:31,268
密室?
"Secret room"?

470
00:43:32,395 --> 00:43:33,979
没错 有个密室 为何不会有
Yeah, a secret room. Why not?

471
00:43:34,063 --> 00:43:36,148
知道嘛 你才是失去理智的那个人
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.

472
00:43:36,565 --> 00:43:38,776
我在这三年了 朋友
I've been here three years, man.

473
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:40,319
基地里的一砖一瓦我都认识
I know every inch of this base.

474
00:43:40,444 --> 00:43:43,447
我连夹在壁板里的灰尘有多厚都清清楚楚
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.

475
00:43:43,656 --> 00:43:45,533
那他们为何这么做 动机是什么
Why would they do that? What's the motive?

476
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:47,535
你看 他们是公司 对吧
Look, it's a company, right?

477
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:51,497
有的是投资人 股东 还有诸如此类的臭狗屎
They have investors, they have shareholders. Shit like that.

478
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:54,500
哪一个更经济 花钱花时间去培训一个新人
What's cheaper? Spending time and money training new personnel...

479
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:57,211
还是弄一打备胎给这个岗位?
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?

480
00:43:57,545 --> 00:43:59,213
这里是月球远端
It's the far side of the moon!

481
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,967
这群贱人连个通讯卫星都没修好!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!

482
00:44:05,344 --> 00:44:06,846
苔丝会知道的 她会告诉我的
Tess would know, she would have told me...

483
00:44:06,846 --> 00:44:08,556
嗨 泽佩托 醒醒吧(制作木偶匹诺曹的木匠)
Hey, Gepetto, wake up!

484
00:44:09,098 --> 00:44:10,891
你真的以为他们会他妈的关心我们?
You really think they give a shit about us?

485
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:12,852
他们正在去银行的路上哈哈大笑
They're laughing all the way to the bank!

486
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,729
苔丝会知道的 她会告诉我的
Tess would know, she would have told me...

487
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:15,688
你就不能起来?!
Where do you get off?!

488
00:44:16,105 --> 00:44:18,691
他妈的坐在那生闷气跟个欠揍的娃一样
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!

489
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:20,901
天啊      醒醒吧
Jesus Christ...        Wake up!

490
00:44:24,655 --> 00:44:26,741
这里一定有什么我们不知道的区域
There's some area that we don't know about.

491
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,617
我要去把他找出来
And I'm going to find it.

492
00:44:30,077 --> 00:44:32,663
是啊 说不定你还能找到宝藏
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.

493
00:45:07,406 --> 00:45:08,449
操
Fuck!

494
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:12,203
伊莱扎小组预计13小时后到达
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.

495
00:45:13,537 --> 00:45:15,331
找到你的密室了吗
You find your secret room?

496
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:18,667
就把它搁那儿吧
Just put that anywhere.

497
00:45:20,544 --> 00:45:22,713
嗯 这是个好主意
Yes, that's a good idea...

498
00:45:22,922 --> 00:45:24,924
这就是我放我的小妖精的地方      闪开
That's where I keep my leprechauns.        Get out of the way.

499
00:45:25,758 --> 00:45:28,761
什么 为什么      我想查查模型下面
What? Why?        I want to look underneath that model.

500
00:45:29,804 --> 00:45:31,389
不许你碰模型
You're not touching this model.

501
00:45:32,515 --> 00:45:33,766
他妈的给我让开
Get the fuck out of the way!

502
00:45:34,308 --> 00:45:36,185
听着 为什么你就不能放松一下
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?

503
00:45:36,477 --> 00:45:38,479
为什么你不吃点药 或者烤块饼干吃吃
Why don't you take a pill? Bake a cake?

504
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,856
去读读百科全书什么的      现在你到成了硬汉?
Go read the encyclopedia or something?        Oh, you're a tough guy now?

505
00:45:41,065 --> 00:45:42,108
怎么 你想捅我一刀?
What, are you going to stab me?

506
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,568
不 我是个热爱和平的勇士
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.

507
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:46,320
我是个博爱的人 不是个嗜暴之徒
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

508
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:49,156
把刀放心 我想看看这下面
Put the knife down. I want to look underneath there.

509
00:45:49,198 --> 00:45:50,991
把刀放下      不 我不会把刀给你
Put the knife down.        No, I'm not going to give you the knife.

510
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:52,410
什么      你让开
What?        Just get out of the way.

511
00:45:52,451 --> 00:45:53,786
放轻松      把刀放下
Take it easy.        Let go of the knife.

512
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:55,579
别对我指手画脚
Don't ever tell me what to do.

513
00:45:56,831 --> 00:45:59,208
松开 把刀松开
Let go. You let go of the knife.

514
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,502
别跟个混球一样 别逼我
Don't be an asshole.Don't push me.

515
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:04,130
别逼我 贱人      松开
Don't push me, motherfucker!        Let go.

516
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:06,006
松开
Let go!

517
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:18,811
他妈的听不懂啊 我叫你送开那狗屎的刀
What did I fucking tell you? "Let go of the goddamn knife. "

518
00:46:26,527 --> 00:46:28,195
操你个小娘们
You fucking little girl, man!

519
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:39,582
妈的 我怎么跟你说的
Damn it! What did I tell you?

520
00:46:51,051 --> 00:46:53,846
你停手吗 你停手吗
You going to stop? You going to stop?

521
00:46:54,263 --> 00:46:55,431
停手
OK!

522
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:57,933
好的
OK!

523
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,894
老天 该死
Jesus, fuck!

524
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:04,065
操 操他妈的
Fuck me! What the fuck?

525
00:47:04,482 --> 00:47:06,776

I hardly... I hardly touched you.

526
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:08,402
让我看看
Let me see.

527
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:10,446
流了不少血      滚开
That's a lot of blood.        Get off of me!

528
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:08,087

530
00:48:12,258 --> 00:48:13,092
没事

531
00:48:14,969 --> 00:48:19,140

Yeah, we had a fight. Me and the other guy, the other...

532
00:48:21,225 --> 00:48:24,061
他很生气 你知道么?
He's very angry, you know?

533
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:26,147
你知道他做什么了吗
You know what he did?

534
00:48:26,647 --> 00:48:28,524
他把我的模型整个给掀翻了
He flipped my entire model over!

535
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:30,526
你知道我在那上面耗了多少精力么
You know how much work I put into that thing?

536
00:48:30,818 --> 00:48:32,403
938个小时

537

538
00:48:36,574 --> 00:48:38,576
938个小时 真的?
938 hours, really?

539
00:48:38,617 --> 00:48:40,619
差不多
Approximately.

540
00:48:41,871 --> 00:48:43,038
他有问题
He's got a problem.

541
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:46,792
他吓到我了 柯里
He scares me, Gerty.

542
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:49,170
山姆吓到你什么了
What is it about Sam that scares you?

543
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:50,963
他有点失控了
The guy flies off the handle.

544
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,883
我现在知道了 知道苔丝的意思了
I see it now. I see what Tess was talking about.

545
00:48:58,554 --> 00:49:00,556
我从没和你说过 柯里 但她...
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...

546
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,689
她离开我了 苔丝和我分了
She left me. Tess left me.

547
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:11,609
分了6个月了 她搬回娘家住了
For 6 months. She moved back in with her parents.

548
00:49:11,817 --> 00:49:12,943
我知道
I know.

549
00:49:18,074 --> 00:49:19,825
她又给了我一次机会
She gave me a second chance.

550
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:24,538
我答应她我会改      你已经改了 山姆
I promised her that I'd change.        You have changed, Sam.

551
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,709
嗨 柯里 自从我上来以后 我发给苔丝...
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...

552
00:49:29,835 --> 00:49:31,837
发了一百多条视频短信
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.

553
00:49:32,254 --> 00:49:33,798
这些短信都去哪了
Where did those messages go?

554
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,674
她收到了吗
Did they ever reach her?

555
00:49:36,092 --> 00:49:39,220
山姆 我只知道基地里发生的事
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.

556
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:44,642
那她发给我的呢
What about the messages she sent to me?

557
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:49,647
山姆 我只知道基地里发生的事
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.

558
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:09,375
柯里...柯里?
Gerty... Gerty?

559
00:50:14,797 --> 00:50:17,091
我真的是个克隆吗
Am I really a clone?

560
00:50:18,968 --> 00:50:22,304
当你第一次到达莎拉站的时候 发生了小碰撞
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.

561
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:23,973
你在医务室醒过来
You woke up in the infirmary.

562
00:50:24,432 --> 00:50:27,101
你的大脑局部受创 记忆丧失
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.

563
00:50:27,184 --> 00:50:30,104
我对你进行医学观察 还做了些测试
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.

564
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:31,647
我记得 对 我记得
I remember, yea, I remember that...

565
00:50:31,689 --> 00:50:34,859
山姆 其实没有什么碰撞 你是被激活的
Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened.

566
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,028
为了保证神智正常 和机能健康
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests...

567
00:50:38,154 --> 00:50:40,656
对所有新克隆人
to establish mental stability..

568
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,408
进行测试属于标准程序
and general physical health.

569
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:46,370
DNA复制中的细小错误和遗传性变异
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA...

570
00:50:46,495 --> 00:50:48,164
会影响到...
can have considerable impact on...

571
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:50,458
那苔丝呢 夏娃呢
What about Tess? What about Eve?

572
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,752
都是记忆植入 山姆
They are memory implants, Sam.

573
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,548
从真正的山姆・贝尔那上传并经修改的记忆
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.

574
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,320
我很抱歉
I'm very sorry.

575
00:51:22,573 --> 00:51:25,367
山姆 你已经好几个小时没有吃东西了
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.

576
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:27,369
要我给你做点吃的吗
Can I prepare you something?

577
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,583
救援小组预计11小时后到达
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.

578
00:52:18,254 --> 00:52:23,050
没事吧 宝贝      我只是去看看星空
You OK, sweetheart?        Yeah, I'm staring into space.

579
00:52:24,427 --> 00:52:27,555
嗨 谢啦 这玩意儿很不错
Hey! Thanks for this, this is good.

580
00:52:28,264 --> 00:52:31,058
这玩意挺保暖 你鼻子咋样
This is cozy. How's the nose?

581
00:52:32,017 --> 00:52:33,769
好多了 谢谢
Much better, thank you.

582
00:52:35,354 --> 00:52:39,817
刚刚我疯掉了 你知道...我失去理智了...我...
I went haywire before. You know... I lost it. I...

583
00:52:42,445 --> 00:52:45,030
我很抱歉      没事
I'm sorry about that.        It's OK.

584
00:52:45,156 --> 00:52:47,783
不 有事 我把菲尔德掀翻了
No, it's not OK. I fucked up Fairfield.

585
00:52:47,783 --> 00:52:48,909
把你的模型搞得一团糟
I fucked up your model.

586
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:50,786
我也不知道自己怎么了 我...
I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got...

587
00:52:51,203 --> 00:52:53,080
我一下子就来了火气 我得做点什么避免再犯
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.

588
00:52:53,164 --> 00:52:54,832
是的 确实
Yes, you do.

589
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:01,213
嗨 你能关掉一会吗 我想和你谈谈
Hey, can you turn that off for a second? I want to talk to you.

590
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,299
你能把它关掉吗
Can you turn that off?

591
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:06,010
听着 听着
Listen. Listen.

592
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,678
我不是想...
I wasn't supposed to...

593
00:53:11,098 --> 00:53:12,892
我只是想告诉你点事儿
I'm trying to tell you something.

594
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:17,688
我从没指示柯里去...
I never instructed Gerty to...

595
00:53:19,774 --> 00:53:23,110
听我说 我当时没想到要去找你
Listen to me. I wasn't supposed to find you...

596
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,618
硬汉
Tough Guy.

597
00:53:30,701 --> 00:53:35,414
听我说      你穿得像个女用的太空棉棒
Listen to me!        You look like a radioactive tampon.

598
00:53:35,539 --> 00:53:36,999
整一个XX更健康的大香蕉
Like a banana with a yeast infection.

599
00:53:39,376 --> 00:53:42,296
听我说 我没打算去找你
Listen to me. I wasn't supposed to find you.

600
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,967
你在外面时 月星指示柯里把我锁在基地里
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.

601
00:53:47,301 --> 00:53:49,804
还有别的 差不多在我苏醒的时候
And there's something else. Right around the time I was awakened...

602
00:53:50,638 --> 00:53:52,431
我听到柯里在和中心联系
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.

603
00:53:52,431 --> 00:53:54,225
而且是实时通讯
He was having a live conversation.

604
00:53:55,017 --> 00:53:56,477
"实时通讯"
"A live conversation"?

605
00:53:56,977 --> 00:54:00,231
没错      你怎么知道是实时通讯
Yeah        How do you know it was a live conversation?

606
00:54:01,065 --> 00:54:03,859
因为他们是在一问一答地对话
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.

607
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:07,905
可通讯设备早就被太阳风暴损坏了
Communications equipment was damaged. There was a solar storm.

608
00:54:07,947 --> 00:54:09,949
真的是实时通讯 伙计 实时
It was live, man, it was live.

609
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:12,701
不可能 太阳耀斑早就把卫星烧坏了
That's impossible. There was a flare, it fried the satellite.

610
00:54:12,743 --> 00:54:13,911
卫星没事
The satellite is fine.

611
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:17,081
他们不想让我们联系上地球 他们骗了我们
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth. They lied to us.

612
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:19,250
从一开始就在骗我们
They've been lying to us since the beginning.

613
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,001
一直就在骗我们
They've been lying since forever.

614
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,339
如果卫星管用 他们怎么从基地里屏蔽信号
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?

615
00:54:25,464 --> 00:54:27,425
其他仪器都很正常啊
Everything works fine.

616
00:54:27,842 --> 00:54:31,303
也许他们不是从基地里封锁的信号?
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?

617
00:54:32,138 --> 00:54:33,472
那从哪儿
From where, then?

618
00:54:55,077 --> 00:54:57,288
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

619
00:54:59,498 --> 00:55:01,125
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

620
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,961
我刚刚超越最后一辆采能车 好像是约翰号
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters. Looks like John.

621
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:06,046
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

622
00:55:06,547 --> 00:55:08,924
你驶出基地范围还需要多久
How long until you are out of the base's range?

623
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:10,801
一分钟
Um, a minute.

624
00:55:11,552 --> 00:55:14,889
最多90秒      你有到过那么远吗
90 seconds tops.        Have you ever been out this far?

625
00:55:15,598 --> 00:55:19,101
没有 从来没有      信号搜索失败
No... never have.        Signal failure on long-range comms.

626
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,314
驶离莎拉站区域
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

627
00:55:24,273 --> 00:55:26,233
驶离莎拉站区域
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

628
00:55:27,401 --> 00:55:29,570
驶离莎拉站区域
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

629
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:45,753
看到什么了      我都不知道自己在找啥
See anything?        It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.

630
00:55:48,881 --> 00:55:50,758
等等 我看到什么了
Wait a second, I see something.

631
00:55:52,218 --> 00:55:53,552
3号基站接近中
Approaching station 3.

632
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:40,266
妈的 我想我也看到了
Holy shit! I think I see something, too.

633
00:56:41,016 --> 00:56:42,768
1号基站接近中
Approaching station 1.

634
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:51,861
你看到的和我看到的一样么 它看上去像天线或者
Do you see what I see? Looks like an antenna or... or...

635
00:56:52,486 --> 00:56:54,572
像是个发射塔一样的东西 应该是个干扰发射器
A pylon or something. I think it's the jammer.

636
00:56:55,865 --> 00:56:59,452
老兄 这就是我们收不到信号的原因
Dude! This is why we're not getting the live feed.

637
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,516
山姆 听得见吗      嗯
Sam? Can you hear me?        Yeah.

638
00:57:24,602 --> 00:57:26,270
我听得见
Yeah, yeah I hear you.

639
00:57:28,439 --> 00:57:29,732
我感觉不太好
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.

640
00:57:29,732 --> 00:57:31,817
我要...我要先回基地
I'm going to... I'm going to head back to the base.

641
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:34,236
好 我在外面继续兜一会
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.

642
00:57:34,236 --> 00:57:36,072
看看还有没有别的干扰器
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.

643
00:58:01,931 --> 00:58:05,684
操 操 操
Fuck... Fuck... Fuck.

我开始脱发了
My hair's falling out.

651
01:00:43,426 --> 01:00:45,010
这个状况正常吗
How about that for a status?

652
01:00:45,428 --> 01:00:47,513
下次再做吧
We'll do this another time.

653
01:01:10,244 --> 01:01:11,287
操
Fuck!

654
01:01:17,543 --> 01:01:18,586
马上就能看到她了

躺下 放松 深呼吸
Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.

657
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:27,530
低温冷冻箱用来
The cryogenic protection pod is designed

658
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,073
帮助进入深层睡眠
to put you into a deep sleep for...

659
01:02:29,156 --> 01:02:32,910
从而渡过返程所需的3天时间
The duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.

660
01:02:33,035 --> 01:02:34,703
当你感到睡意来临
As you begin to feel sleepy,

661
01:02:35,037 --> 01:02:37,915
就想想你所完成的了不起的工作
think about the magnificent job that you've done.

662
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:41,460
想想你的家人多么为你的成就而自豪
And how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.

663
01:02:41,794 --> 01:02:46,799
月星企业之所以成为世界最大的清洁能源供应商
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide...

664
01:02:46,882 --> 01:02:50,010
就是因为有你们这些辛勤工作的员工
Due to the hard work of people like you.

665
01:02:50,136 --> 01:02:53,681
一路平安 "阿牛咳死呦"(棒子语) 再见
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.

Approaching station 2.

667
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,919
嗨 我又找到了三座类似的干扰器
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.

668
01:04:48,796 --> 01:04:51,507
估计基地就被围在当中 我把坐标都打出来了
I think the base is surrounded with them. I printed out their coordinates.

669
01:04:53,175 --> 01:04:54,635
老兄 你怎么了

我找到密室了
I found your secret room.

谁先下      我先
Who goes first?        I go first.

673
01:06:19,512 --> 01:06:21,889
天啊 好多人
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.

674
01:06:23,265 --> 01:06:24,934
为什么会如此之多
Why are there so many of them?

675
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:11,939
山姆 能帮你什么吗
Sam, can I help you with something?

676
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:15,609
现在别 柯里 我没事
Not now, Gerty. I'm OK.

677
01:07:18,946 --> 01:07:23,325
柯里 为什么之前你要帮我
Gerty, why did you help me before?

678
01:07:23,826 --> 01:07:27,913
帮我输密码 那不是和你的程序相违吗
With the password? Doesn't that go against your programming or something?

679
01:07:28,122 --> 01:07:29,874
我的程序就是帮助你
Helping you is what I do.

680
01:07:41,677 --> 01:07:43,846
驶离萨拉站工作范围

Could you call back? There's something wrong with the picture.

688
01:08:34,522 --> 01:08:36,732
我想找苔丝・贝尔

689
01:08:37,775 --> 01:08:40,486
抱歉 她几年前就过世了
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.

Are you sure?        Yeah, I think so.

691
01:09:02,258 --> 01:09:05,177
我是她女儿 能帮你什么吗
I'm her daughter. Can I help you?

692
01:09:08,639 --> 01:09:09,974
夏娃?

693
01:09:10,516 --> 01:09:13,227
是的      嗨 夏娃
Yeah.        Hi! Hi, Eve.

How old old are you now?        I'm 15.

695
01:09:18,524 --> 01:09:20,943
我认识你吗      亲爱的
Do I know you?        Sweetheart...

696
01:09:23,446 --> 01:09:25,406
妈咪是怎么死的 亲爱的
How did mommy die, sweetheart?

697
01:09:27,491 --> 01:09:29,285
妈咪是怎么死的
How did mommy die?

698
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,496
爸爸      在
Dad!        Yeah.

699
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:36,167
有人问妈妈的事      谁在问
There's someone asking about mom.        Who's asking about mom?

700
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,473
够了 够了
That's enough. That's enough.

701
01:09:55,978 --> 01:09:57,438
我想回家
I want to go home!

702
01:10:03,694 --> 01:10:05,446
...我想回家...
...want to go...

703
01:10:37,144 --> 01:10:40,606
伊莱扎小队将在7小时后到达

操
Fuck!

705
01:10:45,403 --> 01:10:47,279
怎么 你切到自己了?      是的
What, did you cut yourself?        Yeah.

706
01:10:49,782 --> 01:10:51,033
你笑什么
What are you laughing at?

707
01:10:51,534 --> 01:10:52,576
你可不能像要去
Well, you don't hold it

708
01:10:53,035 --> 01:10:56,247
捅人一样拿小刻刀
like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.

709
01:10:56,247 --> 01:10:57,289
来 给我
Here, give me that.

710
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,340
得握得离刀刃近一点 看到吗 就像我这样
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see? Watch what I'm doing.

711
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,383
你在发抖?
Why are you shaking?

712
01:11:08,342 --> 01:11:10,094
像这样刻下去
Carve out like that.

713
01:11:26,152 --> 01:11:27,737
这里有点冷
It's freezing in here.

714
01:11:28,571 --> 01:11:31,574
你就像坐在冰柜里一样 你到底怎么了
Well, you're sitting under the fridge. What's going on with you?

715
01:11:31,991 --> 01:11:32,825
你没事吧?
You all right?

716
01:11:34,618 --> 01:11:36,912
没事 运过来的那组人
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...

717
01:11:37,955 --> 01:11:40,082
要是他们发现我们俩同时被激活了
If they find us awake at the same time,

718
01:11:40,082 --> 01:11:42,376
他们绝不会放过我们
they aren't going to let us live.

719
01:11:45,463 --> 01:11:46,797
你知道的 对吧
You know that, right?

720
01:11:49,425 --> 01:11:51,719
你也知道 返程载具其实...
You know, the return vehicle is a...

721
01:11:57,349 --> 01:11:58,809
你没事吧
You OK?

722
01:12:02,146 --> 01:12:05,566
你应该躺一会 吃点镇静剂之类的药
You should lay down for a while. Take some tranquilizers or something.

723
01:12:05,691 --> 01:12:08,486
镇静剂? 我就要永久性沉睡了
"Take some tranquilizers"? I'll never wake up again.

724
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:20,289
你会好起来的 一切都会好起来的
You're going to be OK. Everything's going to be OK.

725
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:32,885
我好冷
I'm freezing.

726
01:12:45,106 --> 01:12:48,526
嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey? Hey?

727
01:12:55,616 --> 01:12:57,493
我真的很害怕
I'm really scared.

728
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:05,418
你去哪
Where are you going?

729
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:00,681
你好
Hello?

730
01:14:02,683 --> 01:14:05,186
是贝尔家吗      是贝尔家
Is this the Bell residence?        This is the Bell residence.

731
01:14:05,811 --> 01:14:08,189
你能重打回来吗 我看不见图像
Could you call back? There's something wrong with the picture.

732
01:14:09,565 --> 01:14:11,233
我想找苔丝・贝尔
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

733
01:14:11,442 --> 01:14:14,153
对不起 她几年前就过世了
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.

734
01:14:15,696 --> 01:14:19,658
你确定?      我想是的 我是她女儿
Are you sure?        Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.

735
01:14:20,284 --> 01:14:21,660
能帮你什么吗
Can I help you?

736
01:15:18,801 --> 01:15:20,970
柯里 我要和你谈谈
Gerty, I need to talk to you.

737
01:15:21,178 --> 01:15:23,055
当然 山姆 能帮你什么
Of course, Sam, how can I help?

738
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,141
我们发现了密室 我们也知道有其他人
We've found the hidden room. We know about the others.

739
01:15:26,308 --> 01:15:28,394
那间密室 柯里
That hidden room, Gerty.

740
01:15:28,811 --> 01:15:32,440
底层甲板禁止活体克隆进入 山姆
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.

741
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:35,651
柯里 我们需要激活一个新克隆
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.

742
01:15:35,693 --> 01:15:39,739
只有当一份3年合同完结了才能激活新克隆
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.

743
01:15:40,156 --> 01:15:41,657
柯里 要是你再不激活一个新的
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone,

744
01:15:41,657 --> 01:15:43,409
我和另一个山姆就会死
me and the other Sam will die.

745
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:45,703
会被杀死 你明白吗
We will be killed, do you understand?

746
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,706
明白      你想看着我们被杀死吗
Yes        You want me and the other Sam to be killed?

747
01:15:48,831 --> 01:15:50,624
这是我最不希望看见的
That is the last thing I want.

748
01:15:50,624 --> 01:15:52,626
那你就必须激活一个新克隆
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.

749
01:15:52,668 --> 01:15:54,253
好吗 伙计
OK, pal?

750
01:16:07,183 --> 01:16:10,728
伊莱扎小组预计5小时后到达
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.

751
01:17:11,205 --> 01:17:13,082
怎么了 你没事吧
What's going on? You OK?

752
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:16,627
别 别碰他
Don't, don't touch him.

753
01:17:19,338 --> 01:17:20,464
过来
Come here.

754
01:17:22,675 --> 01:17:26,429
他还没有苏醒 柯里和我刚激活他
He's not conscious yet. Gerty and I just woke him up.

755
01:17:26,429 --> 01:17:28,931
为什么 发生什么了
Why? What's going on?

756
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,808
我们外头谈
Come on outside.

757
01:17:35,604 --> 01:17:37,106
当救援小组到达
When the rescue unit arrives,

758
01:17:37,106 --> 01:17:40,109
他们将会在撞坏的探路车里发现一具尸体
they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.

759
01:17:41,235 --> 01:17:42,695
那个人?
That guy?

760
01:17:44,363 --> 01:17:46,031
什么 你打算杀了他?
What, are you going to kill him?

761
01:17:46,657 --> 01:17:48,951
天啊      你在做什么
Jesus Christ.        What are you doing?

762
01:17:49,034 --> 01:17:50,828
把"校门"拉拉好
Zip up your fly.

763
01:17:52,496 --> 01:17:55,708
你发烧了 出了好多汗
You're burning up. Sweating like a pig.

764
01:17:57,793 --> 01:18:01,255
帽子戴好 帽子戴好
Put your hat on. Put your hat on.

765
01:18:11,557 --> 01:18:12,808
要想让计划成功
If I go through with this,

766
01:18:12,808 --> 01:18:15,061
我需要你帮我把他拖过去
I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.

767
01:18:15,853 --> 01:18:17,188
那我们呢
What about us?

768
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:19,315
当伊莱扎到达时
When Eliza arrives,

769
01:18:19,315 --> 01:18:20,691
要是发现你和我在给他们开欢迎会
it finds you and me as a welcome party...

770
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:22,777
他们不会发现我们的欢迎会
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.

771
01:18:22,777 --> 01:18:23,611
他们只会找到我
They're going to find me.

772
01:18:23,652 --> 01:18:25,738
在他们到达前你就会踏上回乡之路
You're going back to Earth before they get here.

773
01:18:26,489 --> 01:18:30,493
通过氦-3运输器 我算过了 你得承受好几个重力
In that helium-3 launcher. I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.

774
01:18:30,493 --> 01:18:32,661
但你不会有事
But you'll be fine. You'll be all right.

775
01:18:32,745 --> 01:18:34,830
你会回家
You're going home.

776
01:18:35,456 --> 01:18:37,333
你干完了你的三年
You did your three years.

777
01:18:38,584 --> 01:18:40,753
他们不能再把你钉死在这
They can't expect you to stick around.

778
01:18:42,129 --> 01:18:44,090
也许你还能偷偷看看夏娃
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

779
01:18:44,507 --> 01:18:46,300
我看过视频通话了
I saw that V.P.

780
01:18:46,592 --> 01:18:49,845
她真漂亮 美若仙女
She's beautiful. She's gorgeous.

781
01:18:50,262 --> 01:18:51,722
你做得不错了
You did good.

782
01:18:52,139 --> 01:18:53,682
击个掌!
High five!

783
01:19:03,192 --> 01:19:04,944
去吧
Go for it.

784
01:19:15,287 --> 01:19:17,790
宽敞吗      不宽敞
Are you comfy?        No.

785
01:19:18,082 --> 01:19:19,667
什么      不宽敞
What?        No!

786
01:19:26,006 --> 01:19:27,383
要是我要拉屎咋办
What if I have to take a shit?

787
01:19:27,842 --> 01:19:30,553
那 我猜你只能摒着 伙计
Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.

788
01:19:31,345 --> 01:19:32,805
摒三天?
For three days?

789
01:19:34,348 --> 01:19:36,016
只能这样了
That's the way it goes.

790
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,353
要帮忙吗      不用
Need a hand?        No.

791
01:19:41,021 --> 01:19:43,607
好吧
OK. All right.

792
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:46,152
我可没敌意 只是想帮你一把
No reason for hostility. I'm just trying to help out.

793
01:20:26,067 --> 01:20:28,903
伊莱扎将在3小时后到达
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.

794
01:20:58,724 --> 01:21:01,018
嗨 我们必须这样做 要是我们等太久...
Hey, we need to do this. If we wait too long...

795
01:21:01,936 --> 01:21:03,813
另一个会苏醒
The other one's going to be conscious.

796
01:21:06,732 --> 01:21:08,317
天啦 你怎么了
What's going on with you?

797
01:21:09,777 --> 01:21:11,737
我改主意了 我不回去
I changed my mind. I'm not going back.

798
01:21:14,865 --> 01:21:16,867
我连腿都动不了
I don't think I can move my legs.

799
01:21:17,493 --> 01:21:18,953
还有 看看我
Besides, look at me!

800
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,830
要是我见到夏娃
If I meet Eve now...

801
01:21:22,081 --> 01:21:24,166
一定会吓到她惊声尖叫
I'd scare the crap out of her!

802
01:21:26,127 --> 01:21:28,671
你在说什么呢 她可是你女儿
What are you talking about, man? She's your daughter.

803
01:21:28,671 --> 01:21:30,214
她不会在乎你的样子
She doesn't care what you look like.

804
01:21:32,925 --> 01:21:36,137
你不能杀了他 我们不能杀人
You're not going to kill anybody. We can't kill anybody.

805
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:39,181
你不会 我知道你不会 因为我也不会
You can't. I know you can't, because I can't.

806
01:21:40,725 --> 01:21:41,976
换你回去吧
You go.

807
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:47,314
你是个好人 山姆
You're a good guy, Sam.

808
01:21:48,023 --> 01:21:51,694
计划也不错 除了找错了回去的人
And it was a good plan. You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.

809
01:22:02,329 --> 01:22:04,623
你确定吗
Are you sure about this?

810
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:11,380
是的 你应该 你应该去旅行 知道吗
Yeah. You should, you should travel, you know?

811
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:14,425
我一直想去
I always wanted to do that.

812
01:22:16,177 --> 01:22:17,553
阿姆斯特丹或者...
Amsterdam or...

813
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:22,850
是啊 我在想夏威夷或者...墨西哥
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe... Mexico.

814
01:22:23,267 --> 01:22:24,935
啊喽哈(夏威夷语 你好)
Aloha!

815
01:22:26,187 --> 01:22:29,106
记得帮我带杯椰汁凤梨朗姆酒 伙计
Bring me back a pina colada. All right, pal?

816
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,030
嗨 太空威士忌(酒原名johnny walker)
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?

817
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:23,244
你还记得和苔丝的那次面试吗
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?

818
01:23:24,495 --> 01:23:26,580
她真美
She was so beautiful.

819
01:23:27,206 --> 01:23:30,543
她不是最好的候选人 但这不重要
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...

820
01:23:31,585 --> 01:23:33,671
我不得不给她那份工作
I had to give her the job.

821
01:23:34,714 --> 01:23:36,590
我想把她留在美国
I wanted to keep her in the country.

822
01:23:38,134 --> 01:23:40,219
结果她还是回爱尔兰了
She was going back to Ireland.

823
01:23:44,098 --> 01:23:46,058
你知道 这时候你得赌一把
And you knew you had to take a chance.

824
01:23:46,684 --> 01:23:49,395
所以...你打电话给她...
So... you called her...

825
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:51,522
你自己都被你留在答录机上的
You were terrified with that whole speech

826
01:23:51,522 --> 01:23:52,648
那套豪言壮语吓到了
for the answering machine...

827
01:23:52,648 --> 01:23:54,525
但其实用不着 因为她接电话了
but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.

828
01:23:54,608 --> 01:23:57,027
她就好像在说"为什么他给我打电话"
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"

829
01:23:57,653 --> 01:24:00,573
"面试结束了 为什么他往我家打电话"
"The internship is over. Why is he calling me at home?"

830
01:24:02,658 --> 01:24:05,494
然后我问她想不想吃甜筒
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone

831
01:24:05,494 --> 01:24:07,663
还提了些类似的蠢建议
or something dorky like that.

832
01:24:08,289 --> 01:24:10,666
她却说"一起去喝一杯吧"
She said, "Let's get a drink. "

833
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,254
我说"好" 我们...
I said, "OK." We...

834
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:07,093
山姆 这不管用
Sam, this is not going to work.

835
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:09,220
为什么
Why?

836
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:12,223
我已经记录下了从你被激活的所有活动
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.

837
01:27:13,265 --> 01:27:15,476
要是有人检查我的记忆存储器
If anyone were to check my memory cache,

838
01:27:15,476 --> 01:27:17,269
你就会陷入极其危险的境地
it would put you in considerable danger.

839
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:23,526
但你可以格式化我的记忆库
You could erase my memory banks.

840
01:27:23,609 --> 01:27:26,320
我可以设定在你离开后再重启
I could reboot myself once you have departed.

841
01:27:26,904 --> 01:27:28,322
那样你会没事吧?
Are you okay with that?

842
01:27:28,531 --> 01:27:30,241
我的使命就是保证你的安全 山姆
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

843
01:27:30,282 --> 01:27:31,826
我想帮你^_^
I want to help you.

844
01:27:42,878 --> 01:27:46,215

我设定...设定主机在...
I set your... I set your computer to reboot...

847
01:28:03,607 --> 01:28:06,944
我被发射后重启      我明白 山姆
the moment that I launch.        I understand, Sam.

848
01:28:07,069 --> 01:28:08,487
你应该会没事
You should be OK.

849
01:28:08,529 --> 01:28:11,741
我希望地球上的生活如你所愿
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.

850
01:28:14,034 --> 01:28:15,286
谢谢你 柯里
Thanks, Gerty.

851
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:19,582
你会没事的吧?      当然
Are you going to be OK?        Of course.

852
01:28:19,665 --> 01:28:22,126
一旦我完成了重启
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming

853
01:28:22,126 --> 01:28:23,836
新的山姆和我会继续按编程行事
as soon as I have finished rebooting.

854
01:28:25,629 --> 01:28:30,634
柯里 我们不是程序 我们是人 明白吗
Gerty, we're not programmed. We're people. Understand?

855
01:28:34,096 --> 01:28:35,056
"踹我啊"
KICK ME

856
01:29:04,001 --> 01:29:07,129
伊莱扎小组将在8分钟后到达

857

860
01:30:30,212 --> 01:30:31,589

861
01:30:32,965 --> 01:30:34,800
嗨 山姆
Hey, Sam?

862
01:30:36,594 --> 01:30:37,928
你没事吧 伙计
You OK, buddy?

863
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:40,347
"骑兵"增援到了

You're in the infirmary. You've had an accident.

866

How long have I been out.        Not long, Sam.

接近目标
We've made contact.

869
01:31:31,857 --> 01:31:34,360
伊莱扎 他哪也没去

870
01:31:35,277 --> 01:31:38,322
把他装袋 我们去修采能车

871
01:31:38,406 --> 01:31:40,074
