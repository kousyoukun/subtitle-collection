00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,157
我们不是说好了不送礼物的吗?
I thought we agreed, no presents.

12
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,796
我的这份没有包装 所以不算
Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count.

Let me take a picture of you guys. My mom wants me to put together, like,

- No, no, no, come here. - Well, you are today.

37
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,115

You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?

38
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:50,019
别担心 相片里有我呐 就没人看你们了

43
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,079

Bella 你的生日是绝对要庆祝的
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.

45
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,124
- 是啊 但是别庆祝我变老 - 变老?
- Yeah, but my aging's not. - Your aging?

46
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,265
我觉着18岁就担心这事儿 有点过早了
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.

47
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,963
我比你老一岁了
It's one year older than you.

48
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,563
不是的 我109岁了
No, it isn't. I'm 109.

49
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,004
那么 或许我不该交这么老的男朋友
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.

50
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:48,638
- 嗯 - 那太恶了 我应该深恶痛绝才是
- Mmm. - It's gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed.

51
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:49,703
啊哈
Uh-huh.

52
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,893
- 我们得上课去了 - 好吧
- We have to go to class. - Okay.

Wait a second.

54
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,865
有人找你
Someone wants you.

55
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,472
- Bella! - Jacob!
- Bella! - Jacob!

56
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,235

What?

57
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,069
你们先聊
I'll leave you to talk.

Hello, biceps! You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.

59

我只是长大了而已 Bella
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.

60
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,027
如果咱常在一起玩的话 你就不会这么惊讶了
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.

61
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,429
你转学算了 你可以和白人们一起玩
You should switch schools. You can come hang out with the palefaces.

62
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:38,497
不必了 我更倾向于寄宿学校的排他性
I'm all right. I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.

63
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,933
{\a6}专收印第安原住民的学校

这里什么烂人都收
They let any old riffraff into this place.

65
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,197
- 明白了 那你为何大驾光临呢? - 嗯
- I see. Then why are you slumming it? - Mmm-hmm.

66
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,764
我只是过来给爱车买配件
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

67
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,367
等弄好了你真该过来试一下
You should really come take a ride when it's done.

68
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,810
跑的快吗?
Is it fast?

69
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:54,935
嗯
Um.

70
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,840
还好吧
It's decent.

71
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,281
- 我开玩笑呢 - 好吧 不错
- I'm kidding. - Okay. Good.

72
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,113
嘿 生日快乐
Hey, happy birthday.

73
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,851
你老爸跟我老爸说了 所以...
Your dad told my dad, so...

74
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,461
是啊 他不说才怪
Yeah, of course he did.

75
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,590
有一天我看到这个 然后我想起你了
I saw this the other day and thought of you.

76
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,963
除恶梦哒
Catches bad dreams.

77
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,995
我正缺这个呢
That's kind of perfect.

78
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,573
谢谢
Thank you.

79
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,576

- 见到你很高兴 - 是啊 回头再见
- Good seeing you. - Yeah, I'll see you later.

81
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,141
再见
Bye.

82
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,314
凭啥Jacob Black能送你礼物 而我却不能?
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?

83
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,390
因为我没有可以回赠你的东西
Because I have nothing to give back to you.

84
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,893
Bella 你的一呼一吸 就给了我全世界
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.

85
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,456
看到了没? 谢谢
See? Thank you.

86
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,126
- 我别无他求了 - Bella!
- That's all I want. - Bella!

87
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,001
- 生日快乐! - 嘘!
- Happy birthday! - Shh, shh!

88
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,801
我记得我说过不要礼物的
I thought I said no presents.

89
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,037
我已经预见你打开它了 你猜怎么着
I've already seen you open it, and guess what,

90
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,544
你特喜欢它
you love it.

91
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,411
今晚穿上它来我们家
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.

92
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,143
拜托了 好不? 肯定有意思
Come on. Please? It'll be fun.

93
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,157
- 好吧 - 太棒了!
- Okay. All right. - Great!

94
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:16,353
7点见
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.

95
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,400
Jasper 又控制我的情绪 太不公平了
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.

96
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,528
不好意思 Bella 生日...
Sorry, Bella. Happy...

97
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,237
算了
Never mind.

98
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,808
相信我 你不能相信吸血鬼
You can't trust vampires. Trust me.

99
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,839
噢我的爱! 我的妻子!
O my love! My wife!

100
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,845
死神虽然吸干了你甜蜜的气息
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath

101
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,353
却没有力量摧毁你的美丽
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

102
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,387
你没有被征服
Thou art not conquered.

103
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,761
美丽的红旗仍然轻拂着你的嘴唇和面颊
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.

104
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,464
死神的白旗还未插到那里
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

105
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,501
我讨厌庆祝生日
I hate being celebrated.

106
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,138
有人比你惨多了 你看罗密欧
There are worse tragedies. I mean, look at Romeo.

107
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,175
因自己纯犯傻行为 害死了他的真爱
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.

108
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,169
是啊
Yeah.

109
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,840
然而有一件事我嫉妒他
Though I do envy him one thing.

110
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,775
朱丽叶太完美了
Juliet is, like, perfect.

111
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,117
如果你喜欢那种超级完美的话
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.

112
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,326
不是指她 我意思是自杀
Not the girl, the suicide.

113
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,495
几乎不可能...
It's nearly impossible for...

114
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,597
对某些人来说
For some people.

115
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,505
人类的话 一点毒药
For humans, a little poison,

116
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,604
心脏上插一刀
a dagger to the heart.

117
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,476
有很多不同的选择
There's so many different options.

118
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,655
你为什么这么说?
Why would you say that?

119
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,449
因为我曾考虑过一次
Because I had to consider it once.

120
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,688
我当时不知道能否及时救你
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.

121
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:03,495
我得有个类似的准备
I had to come up with some kind of plan.

122
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,465
什么准备?
What was the plan?

123
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,997
就是我会去意大利去惹Volturi家族
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.

124
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,073
- 什么家族? - Volturi
- The what? - The Volturi.

125
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,603
现在 有谁能重复一下 最后几行的抑扬格五音步
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter

126
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,242
来证明刚才认真听了?
just to show they were paying attention?

127
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,051
Cullen先生?
Mr. Cullen?

128
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,716
好的 Berty先生
Yes, Mr. Berty.

129
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,328
<font color=#F08080>啊 我要在这儿永远安息 </font>
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest

130
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,497
<font color=#F08080>从我这厌恶人生的躯体上 挣脱厄运的奴役</font>
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.

"Arms, take your last embrace!

<font color=#F08080>在你的双唇呼吸之处</font>
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,

134
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:52,948
<font color=#F08080>印下堂堂正正的一吻 与死神签下永世的契约!</font>
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"

135
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,280
大家要注意看屏幕
Eyes on the screen, people.

00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,290
我就这样在这一吻中死去
ROMEO: Thus with a kiss I die.

137
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,861
Volturi家族渊源悠久 能力强大
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.

138
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,096
我猜他们是我们这类中 最接近皇家血统的了
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.

139
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,900
- 那个是Carlisle吗? - 是的
- Is that Carlisle? - Yeah.

140
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,303
他与他们一起住过几十年
He lived with them for a few decades.

141
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:22,973
他说他们非常文雅 当然 不尊重人类的生命
Described them as very refined. No respect for human life, of course,

142
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,352
但是至少尊重艺术和科学
but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.

143
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,411
以及法律
And the law.

144
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,186
尤其是法律
Above all, the law.

145
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,191
吸血鬼有法律?
Vampires have laws?

146
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,359
不是很多
Not very many.

147
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,367
只有一条须强加执行
And only one that's regularly enforced.

148
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,340
是什么?
What is it?

149
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,503
将我们的存在保密
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.

150
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,006
绝不暴露人前
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,

151
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,409
也不在大庭广众下杀戮
and we don't kill conspicuously.

152
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,792
当然 除非你想死
Unless, of course, you want to die.

153
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,299
你能不说这事了吗?
You gotta stop talking about that.

154
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,142
我不敢想象有人伤害你的情形
I can't even think about someone hurting you.

155
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,810
Bella 唯一能伤害我的只有你
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.

156
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,680
除此之外我什么也不怕
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.

157
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,816
你说的不对
That's not true.

158
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,025
Victoria? 以后她会来找我的
Victoria? She'll come for me one day.

159
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:51,460
她决定了 Alice能预见 咱就能做好准备
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.

160
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,637
我可以保护你
I could protect you

161
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,369
如果你初拥了我
if you change me.

162
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,476
Bella 你已经在保护我了
Bella, you already do protect me.

163
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,438
你是我"活"下去的
You're my only reason

164
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,847
唯一理由
to stay alive,

165
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,350
可能我这样算"活着"
if that's what I am.

166
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,988
但是我的职责是保护你
But it's my job to protect you.

167
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,657
不受任何人伤害 除了我妹妹
From everyone except my sister.

168
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,964
到点了! 到点了!
It's time! It's time. It's time. It's time!

169
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,467
* Your lips are nettles *
Your lips are nettles

170
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,600
* Your tongue is wine *
Your tongue is wine

171
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,671
* You're left as liquid But your body's pine *
You're left as liquid But your body's pine

172
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,442
很抱歉
Sorry about all this.

173
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,348
- 我们试着拦着Alice来着 - 说的好像你能做到似的
- We tried to rein Alice in. - As if that were even possible.

174
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,909
- 生日快乐 Bella - 谢谢
- Happy birthday, Bella. - Thanks.

175
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,859
我从你包包里找到的 你介意吗?
I found it in your bag. You mind?

176
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,858
泡比你大的妞 帅啊
Dating an older woman. Hot.

177
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,295
- 什么? - 你先来 Rosalie
- What? - You first, Rosalie.

178
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,230
这是一个项链 Alice挑的
It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

179
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:02,867
谢谢
Thanks.

180
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,306
恩爱一点看看
Show me the love.

181
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,007
这个是Emmett送的
This one's from Emmett.

182
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,978
已经安在你卡车上了
Already installed it in your truck.

183
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,490
终于有个像样的音响了
Finally a decent sound system

184
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,958
- 那辆破的... - 嘿 别说我卡车的坏话
- for that piece of... - Hey! Don't hate the truck.

185
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,289
看看Esme和Carlisle的礼物
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

186
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,090
只是一些让你开心的小礼物
Just a little something to brighten your day.

187
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,137
是啊 最近你看起来气色不好
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.

188
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,398
噢
Ow.

189
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,476
被纸割到了
Paper cut.

190
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,298
Jaz Jaz 没事的 仅仅是一点
Jaz, Jaz. It's okay. It's just a little

191
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,041
血
blood.

192
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,451
带Jasper出去
Get Jasper out of here.

193
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,490
对不起 我不行
I'm sorry, I can't.

194
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,595
得去我办公室缝一下
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.

195
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,494
去看一下Jasper
Check on Jasper.

196
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,771
我肯定他现在肯定很内疚
I'm sure he's very upset with himself,

197
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,366
估计现在除了你 他谁的话也听不进去
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.

198
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,637
Edward
Edward.

199
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,581
- 我一直就没想要开派对 - 这不是你的错
- I never wanted to have a party. - It's not your fault.

200
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:06,791
Jasper断人血的时间 不像我们这么久
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.

201
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,160
你怎么做到的?
How do you do it?

202
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,262
年复一年的练习
Years and years of practice.

203
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:16,672
你有没有想过简单的那个方法?
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?

204
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,568
没有
No.

205
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,182
我知道我想成为什么样的 我想要帮助人们
I knew who I wanted to be. I wanted to help people.

206
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,683
这样让我感到快乐 即使我无论如何都要被罚
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.

207
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,521
被罚?
Damned?

208
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,222
你指地狱?
Like hell?

209
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,102
Carlisle 你不会被罚下地狱的
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.

210
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,768
你不会的 不可能
You couldn't. It's impossible.

211
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,934
谢谢你 Bella
Thank you, Bella.

212
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:54,104
你对我们一直很客气
You've always been very gracious about us.

213
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,448
就是这个原因? 他就是因此不让我变吸血鬼?
So that's it? That's why he won't change me?

214
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,923
换位思考一下
Imagine the situation in reverse. Hmm.

215
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,428
假如你和Edward想的一样
If you believed as Edward does,

216
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,028
你会夺去他的灵魂吗?
could you take away his soul?

217
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,088
你不能保护我
You can't protect me

218
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,855
不受任何伤害
from everything.

219
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,298
某一天 我们总会两两相隔
At some point, something's gonna separate us.

220
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,629
可能是事故或者疾病
It's gonna be an accident or illness

221
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,203
或者衰老
or old age,

222
00:17:55,974 --> 00:18:00,343
只要我还是人类的话 唯一的解决办法就是初拥了我
as long as I'm human. And the only solution is to change me.

223
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,578
那不是解决办法 这叫悲剧
That's not a solution. That's a tragedy.

224
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:09,280
等我变成老奶奶时你就不会要我了
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.

225
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,800
Bella 你一点也不懂我对你的感觉吗?
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?

226
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,300
Carlisle和我说了
Carlisle told me

227
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,536
你对自己灵魂的感觉
how you feel about your soul.

228
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,943
我不相信
I don't believe that.

229
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,242
所以也别担心我
So don't worry about mine.

230
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,216
你该进屋了
You should go inside.

231
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,869
现在还是我的生日
It's still my birthday.

232
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:04,498
我能要求一件事吗?
So can I ask one thing?

233
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,308
吻我?
Kiss me?

234
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,111
我爱你
I love you.

235
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,115
我爱你
I love you.

236
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,243
* Up with your turret *
Up with your turret

237
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,477
* Aren't we just terrified? *
Aren't we just terrified?

238
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,659
* Shale, screen your worry *
Shale, screen your worry

Don't let it fool you

Down

243
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,227
嘿
Hey.

244
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,572
跟我走走去
Just come take a walk with me.

245
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,298
我们要离开福克斯镇了
We have to leave Forks.

246
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,763
为什么?
Why?

247
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:52,865
Carlisle本该比他看起来老10岁
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks,

248
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,344
人们开始注意到了
and people are starting to notice.

249
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:02,008
好吧 我得编个理由和Charlie说
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.

250
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,696
你说"我们"...
When you say "we"...

251
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,201
我指的是我的家人和我
I mean my family and myself.

252
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,939
Edward Jasper的意外什么也不是
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.

253
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,978
你说的对 什么也不是
You're right. It was nothing,

254
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,112
除了我一直预料的 什么也不是
nothing but what I always expected

255
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,322
和可能发生的事相比 什么也不是
and nothing compared to what could have happened.

256
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,165
你不属于我的世界 Bella
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

257
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,937
我属于你
I belong with you.

258
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,011
不 你不属于
No. You don't.

259
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,984
我来了
I'm coming.

260
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,213
Bella
Bella,

261
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,954
我不想你接近
I don't want you to come.

262
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:22,261
你不想要我?
You don't want me?

263
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,132
不想
No.

264
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,247
那样的话一切都不同了
That changes things a lot.

265
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,184
恕我要求太多
But if it's not too much to ask,

266
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,421
你能答应我一件事吗?
can you just promise me something?

267
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,986
不要鲁莽行事
Don't do anything reckless.

268
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,526
为了Charlie
For Charlie's sake.

269
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,935
同样我也答应你一件事作为回报
And I'll promise something to you in return.

270
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,870
这将是你最后一次见我
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

271
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,065
我不会再回来了
I won't come back,

272
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:07,469
你可以在没有我的打扰下 继续你的生活
and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.

273
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:12,046
就好像我从未存在过一样 我保证
It will be like I never existed, I promise.

274
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:19,253
如果是因为我的灵魂 拿走吧 没有你我也不想要啥灵魂了
If this is about my soul, take it. I don't want it without you.

275
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,349
和你的灵魂无关
It's not about your soul.

276
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,794
你只是不配我
You're just not good for me.

277
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,368
不配你是吧
Not good enough for you.

278
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,231
我很抱歉拖了这么久
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.

279
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,438
求求你...
Please...

280
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,274
不要...
Don't...

281
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,914
再见
Goodbye.

282
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,761
Edward
Edward.

283
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,742
Edward
Edward.

284
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,381
Edward
Edward.

285
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:27,688
Edward!
Edward!

286
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,861
Edward
Edward.

287
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:35,179
我要再打给Cullen家试试
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.

288
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,981
- Cullens家搬走了 Charlie - 可算滚蛋了
- The Cullens left town, Charlie. - Good riddance.

289
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,752
他们去哪了?
Where'd they go?

290
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,659
我们会找到她的 Charlie
We'll find her, Charlie.

291
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,060
- 谢谢 Harry - Charlie!
- Thanks, Harry. - Charlie!

292
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,423
嘿
Hey.

293
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,294
她没事
She's all right.

294
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,629
我来吧 谢谢你 Sam
I got her. Thank you, Sam.

295
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:26,629
十月

296
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:42,746
* There's a possibility *
There's a possibility

297
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:51,423
* There's a possibility *
There's a possibility

298
00:28:52,224 --> 00:28:54,299
{\a6}十一月

299
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,894
* All that I had *
All that I had

300
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,564
* Was all I'm gonna get *
Was all I'm gonna get

301
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,911
Alice 你消失不见了
Alice, you've disappeared,

302
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,485
像其他一切
like everything else.

303
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:18,449
现在谁能听我倾诉? 我很迷茫
Now who else can I talk to? I'm lost.

304
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:24,749
十二月

305
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,157
当你走时
When you left,

306
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,728
他也走了
and he left,

307
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,337
你带走了一切
you took everything with you.

308
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,468
我只能看着他走后留下的空桌
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.

309
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,379
就像有人在我胸口重重打了一拳
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.

310
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,087
Bella
Bella.

311
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:16,246
但我又有点开心
But in a way I'm glad.

312
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,873
唯有这疼痛提醒我 他是真的
The pain is my only reminder that he was real,

313
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,642
你们都是真的
that you all were.

314
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,555
好了 够了
All right. That's it.

315
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,425
什么?
What?

316
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:40,167
你回杰克逊维尔 和你妈一起住
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.

317
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,441
我不要离开福克斯
I'm not leaving Forks.

318
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,610
Bells 他不会回来了
Bells, he's not coming back.

319
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,945
我知道
I know.

320
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,019
但这不正常 你的行为
It's just not normal, this behavior.

321
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:02,523
老实说 都快吓死我和你妈了
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.

322
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,494
宝贝 我也不想你走
Baby, I don't want you to leave.

323
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:11,632
我不想 但还是走吧 回到杰克逊维尔 交些新朋友
I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville. Make some new friends.

324
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,363
我喜欢我的老朋友
I like my old friends.

325
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,202
- 你都不见他们了 - 我有
- Well, you never see them anymore. - I do.

326
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,938
我明天和Jessica去逛街
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.

327
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,944
- 你讨厌逛街 - 我...
- You hate shopping. - I...

328
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,814
我要过个女生之夜
I need a girls' night out.

329
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,457
好吧 女生之夜
All right. Girls' night.

330
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,194
逛街
Shopping.

331
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:44,695
我喜欢 去买点东西也好
I like it. Go buy some stuff.

332
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,068
嗨 Jessica 是我Bella
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.

333
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,179
是的 Bella Swan
Yeah, Bella Swan.

334
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,654
不明白你怎么有耐性看完
I don't know why you want to sit through

335
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:08,021
那些僵尸吃人的场面 而不是看帅哥和美女亲热
all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.

336
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,619
很恶心不是吗 像... 怎么世上有这么多僵尸电影呀?
It's gross. Like... And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?

337
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,290
感觉像是在学麻疯病?
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy,

338
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,357
我表弟有麻疯病 这可一点都不好玩
my cousin had leprosy. It's not funny, you know?

339
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,336
算是暗喻用户至上主义吗?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?

340
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:22,599
像是在说 不要满足于自我...
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like,

341
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:25,301
自作聪明啥的
self-referential cleverness, you know?

342
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,868
就像 有些女孩喜欢逛街 但不是所有的女孩都喜欢
Like, some girls like to shop. Not all girls, apparently.

343
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,938
我还是很惊讶你会打电话约我
Although I was surprised you even called at all. You know?

344
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,144
你的失落 我明白 我真的 真的很担心
Like, your depression thing, I get it. I'm totally, totally worried.

345
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,243
但过了一阵子后
But after a while it's like,

346
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,810
- 你还在郁闷... - 要搭便车嘛 美女们?
- you're still bumming... - You want a ride, girls?

347
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,880
...我也有过心理波折 就像Mike决定
...and I'm going through stuff, too. You know? Like Mike deciding

348
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,015
他只想和我做朋友
he just wants to be friends.

349
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,081
看看我们找到了什么?
What's up? Look what we found.

350
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,354
这很难
It's hard, you know?

351
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:44,758
啥时候开始流行"只做朋友"了...
Like, and since when does "just friends"...

352
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,353
- 伙计们 怎么回事? - 看看我们的发现
- What's up guys? - Look what we found.

353
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,489
喔 喔 喔  嘿 你去哪里?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, where you going?

354
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:57,563
继续往前走
Keep walking.

355
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,338
这里很危险
This is dangerous.

356
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,451
- 丫头 回神 - 来一下下!
- Dude, come on. - Come here for a sec!

357
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,655
我想我认识他们
I think I know those guys.

358
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:22,557
我们有啤酒! 还有机车!
We got beer! We got bikes!

359
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,725
他们看着不错 但我们能离开吗?
Well, they seem great. Can we go?

360
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,969
我只想去看点东西
I'm just gonna see something.

361
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,507
嘿 美女们
Hey, girlie!

362
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,609
好了 好了 我们有乘客了
All right, all right. We got a taker.

363
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,750
转身
Turn around.

364
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,797
- 闭嘴! - 你给我闭嘴!
- Shut up! - You shut up!

365
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:05,335
对不起 我把你当别人了
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

366
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:08,242
没事 你想把我当谁都可以 宝贝
No, that's cool. I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.

367
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,974
上来不?
So, what do you say?

368
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,147
你答应过 不会鲁莽
You promised me, nothing reckless.

369
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,290
你也保证说 会像你从来没存在过一样
You promised it would be as if you never existed.

370
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:33,565
- 你撒谎 - 你说什么 宝贝?
- You lied. - You say something, babe?

371
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,128
管他呢? 算了吧
You know what? Never mind.

372
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,918
停下! 停下 停下 快停下!
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

373
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,837
嘿 你发什么神经?
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

374
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,600
只是有点好奇
Just curious.

375
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,010
- 我以为我看见什么了 - 你... 噢
- I thought that I saw something. - You... Oh.

376
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,711
事实上 你疯了 或者想自杀
You're insane, actually. Or suicidal.

377
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:20,809
那个老乡可能是个神经病
That homeboy could've been a psycho.

378
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:25,254
我差点就要像蹩脚电视里的那样 走进FBI的讯问室了
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.

379
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,615
天哪 真刺激
God, that was such a rush.

380
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,887
好啊 你有肾上腺素瘾症啦?
Awesome. So you're an adrenaline junkie now?

381
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,224
行啊 那去蹦极好了
That's cool. You can go bungee jumping.

382
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,562
但不要去坐小混混的摩托车
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.

383
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,794
疯子
Crazy.

384
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,968
Alice 我看见他了
Alice, I saw him.

385
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,877
也许我疯了 但没关系
Maybe I'm crazy now. I guess that's okay.

386
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,281
如果只有遇险才能见到他
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him,

387
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,583
我愿意以身犯险
then that's what I'll find.

388
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,852
Bella!
Bella!

389
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,021
你去哪里了 疯丫头?
Where the hell have you been, loca?

390
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,535
我给你带了点东西
I brought you something.

391
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,798
- 好吧 - 这玩意儿有点疯狂
- Okay. - It's a little crazy.

392
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:21,936
喔哦
Wow.

393
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,541
破铜烂铁 你真客气
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

394
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,845
我从废品站捡来的
I saved it from the junkyard.

395
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:32,954
我想修理价会比它的身价更高
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth,

396
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,488
然后我又想到 如果我有个懂机械的朋友
but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend

397
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,821
- 愿意帮我 那么... - 啊!
- to help me out then... - Ah!

398
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:40,261
- 我就是那个懂机械的朋友? - 是的
- Me being the mechanic-type friend? - That's right.

399
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,458
- 你啥时候迷上摩托车了? - 现在开始
- Since when are you into motorcycles? - Since now.

400
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,742
如果你认为我很蠢很冲动 我理解
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.

401
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,837
是的哈 确实很愚蠢 很冲动
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.

402
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,477
我们什么时候开工?
When do we start?

403
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:04,743
呃
Um.

404
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:06,886
现在吧
Now.

405
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:09,522
- 求你了? - 好吧
- Please? - All right.

406
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:16,296
噢 嘿 小心点 这些家伙很重的 所以...
Oh, hey, be careful. Those things are actually really heavy, so...

407
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,903
Jake 你真...健壮
Jake, you're, like, buff.

408
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:26,238
怎么回事? 你不是才16岁嘛 我不明白
How did that happen? You're, like, 16. I don't get it.

409
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,643
呃... 年龄只是个数字 宝贝 你几岁了呢? 40岁?
Mmm-hmm. Age is just a number, baby. What are you, like, 40 now?

410
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:36,282
我有时会有这种感觉
It feels like that sometimes.

411
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,193
那首歌很好听 你不喜欢吗?
That song's good. You don't like it?

412
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:54,703
我有点不再迷音乐了
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.

413
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:57,863
好吧 不听音乐了
Okay. No more music.

414
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,138
我在想 如果我们每天都坚持动工
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day,

415
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,079
但愿我们每天都能开工
and hopefully we will,

416
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,879
我们是否要 在哪里先做点功课
we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.

417
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,012
我不想让Billy觉得我把你带坏了
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.

418
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:14,182
你? 带坏我? 拜托
You? Influence me? Please.

419
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,085
你...我年纪比你大
Are you... I'm older than you,

420
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,530
所以我就是施影响者 而你则是受影响的人
so that makes me the influencer and you the influencee.

421
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,192
不 不 不
No, no, no.

422
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,999
我的个头和知识库 都比你大
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you

423
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,597
因为你整日苍白 又不谙世事
because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.

424
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:33,165
我好歹说服你 跟我一起修理2辆报废机车
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.

425
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,805
这没让你觉得自己幼稚天真吗?
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?

426
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,111
好吧 那咱多大?
Okay. So where do we stand?

427
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,086
- 我35岁了 你估计也就32吧 - 少来
- I'm 35. And you might be, like, 32. - Come on.

428
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,850
- 哟 Jake 在家吗? - 没事 是我哥们
- Yo, Jake, you in there? - It's okay. It's just my boys.

429
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,723
- 嘿 Jake - 嘿 伙计们 这位是Bella
- Hey, Jake. - Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

430
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:53,319
- Bella 这两位是Quil和Embry - 嗨
- Bella, that's Quil and Embry. - Hi.

431
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,761
我叫Quil Ateara
I'm Quil Ateara.

432
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,802
这么说还真有修机车这事
So the bike building story is true.

433
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,963
噢 是的 没错 我手把手教会他
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.

434
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,837
那么你是他女朋友这话可是当真?
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?

435
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:06,466
呃...
Uh...

436
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,375
我们是朋友
We're friends, you know.

437
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:10,106
- 糗大了 - 实际上
- Burn. - Actually,

438
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,081
记得我是这么说的 她是女性-朋友
remember I said she's a girl and a friend.

439
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,015
Embry 有记得他这么区分吗?
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?

440
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:16,074
没有
Nope.

441
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,644
你们都有女朋友? 很赞哇
So you guys have girlfriends? That's awesome.

442
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,417
嗯 是的 Quil带他表妹去参加毕业舞会
Yeah, right. Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.

443
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,255
是啊 也算轰动嘛
Yeah, that's still a riot.

444
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,298
想搞笑嘛 Black? 那我让你爽一下
You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

445
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,931
见鬼
Jeez.

446
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,332
嘿 这么抱算着犯规!
Hey, that hold's illegal!

447
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,394
我压5块钱赌Quil赢
I got five bucks on Quil.

448
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:36,103
赌就赌
You're on.

449
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:42,636

454
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,158
亲爱的Alice
Dear Alice,

455
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,596
真希望能有你的真实地址
I wish I had your real address.

456
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,593
真希望能跟你讲讲Jake
I wish I could tell you about Jake.

457
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:08,064
他让我的好过很多
He makes me feel better.

458
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,673
他让我感觉生机勃勃
I mean, he makes me feel alive.

459
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:16,371
我胸口的伤痛
The hole in my chest,

460
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:21,474
和Jake在一起时 好像痊愈了
well, when I'm with Jake, it's like it's almost healed

461
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,951
有那么一阵子
for a while.

462
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:28,521
Quil一直说要来这里 我想他有点喜欢你过头了
So, Quil keeps asking to come over. I think he likes you a little too much.

463
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,048
噢
Oh.

464
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,694
我对姐弟恋可没兴趣 懂不?
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing. You know?

465
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,891
你和你年纪较啥劲呢?
What's up with you and age?

466
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,338
Cullen那家伙又几岁了?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?

467
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,809
但 即使Jake也没办法赶走梦魇
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.

468
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,181
嘿 嘿 嘿!
Hey, hey, hey!

469
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,083
醒醒 Bella
Wake up, Bella.

470
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,819
你没事 你没事
You're okay. You're okay.

471
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:18,341
我还以为这玩意儿有用 看样子没用
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.

472
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,774
能问你点事吗?
Can I ask you something?

473
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,686
和Jacob一起玩
Hanging out with Jacob,

474
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:35,319
好像有点转移你的注意力 不是吗?
that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?

475
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,127
有时候
You know, sometimes

476
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,162
你得学会去爱对自己有益的事物
you gotta learn to love what's good for you.

477
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,903
懂我的意思吗?
You know what I mean?

478
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,468
当然 我知道个啥呢?
Of course, what do I know?

479
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,109
我只不过是个终极单身汉
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

480
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,407
出了名得有女人缘
Famous ladies' man.

481
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:05,079
好了
Okay.

482
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,582
我去睡觉了
I'm gonna go to bed.

483
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,282
呃...
Uh...

484
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,227
我爱你
I love you.

485
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:22,896
如果我说 我没法修好摩托车 你会说什么?
If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?

486
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,743
你在怀疑自己的疯狂技能?
Are you doubting your mad skills?

487
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,779
不 当然不是 它们能跑起来
No. Definitely not. I mean, they'll run fine.

488
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,149
只是
It's just,

489
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,887
如果我够聪明 我应该放慢维修速度
maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.

490
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:49,022
如果你说你不能修好摩托车 我会说 真糟糕
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that that's really too bad,

491
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,967
那我们只能去找别的事做了
but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.

492
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,871
那个是Sam Uley吗?
Is that Sam Uley?

493
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,244
是的 他和他的信徒
Yeah. Him and his cult.

494
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,583
噢 天哪
Oh, my God.

495
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,349
你看到了吗?
Did you see that?

496
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,962
他们不是真打架 Bella 他们在玩悬崖跳水
They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving.

497
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,523
非常恐怖 但是很刺激
Scary as hell, but a total rush.

498
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,671
- 刺激? - 大部分人都选择矮的地方跳
- A rush? - Most of us jump from lower down.

499
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:34,040
就让Sam和他的门徒显摆好了
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.

500
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,545
你跟他有啥过节?
You have some kind of beef with him or something?

501
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:42,241
我不知道
I don't know.

502
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,879
他们觉得自己拥有这个地方
They just think they run this place.

503
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:48,223
Embry以前称他们为 打了类固醇的纠察队员
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.

504
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,726
- 瞧他现在这样子 - 那个是Embry?
- Now look at him. - That's Embry?

505
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,894
- 是的 - 他怎么回事?
- Yeah. - What happened to him?

506
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,957
他翘了几天课
He missed some school.

507
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:01,130
突然之间 他开始做Sam的跟屁虫
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.

508
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,038
Paul和Jared也这样
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.

509
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,806
Sam不停地用怪异的眼神看我
Sam keeps giving me this look,

510
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,609
好像他在等我或什么的
like he's waiting for me or something.

511
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,613
我觉得有点恐怖
It's kind of starting to freak me out.

512
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,086
你还是躲着他比较好
Well, you should just avoid him.

513
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:21,454
我在努力
I try.

514
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,906
好了
Okay.

515
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,106
- 你好像很怕 - 我不怕
- You look scared. - I'm not.

516
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,880
好吧
All right.

517
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,942
- 刹车? - 那个
- Brake? - That one.

518
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,688
离合器?
Clutch?

519
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:55,952
很好
Good.

520
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,418
汽油?
Gas?

521
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,192
准备好了吗?
Ready?

522
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,393
慢慢松开离合器
Now, slowly release the clutch.

523
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,598
Bella
Bella.

524
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:13,164
停下
Stop.

525
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,074
你没事吧?
You all right?

526
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,148
我再试一次
I'm gonna go again.

527
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:24,747
好的
Okay.

528
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,031
踩刹车!
Hit the brake!

529
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,647
我要再来一次
I wanna go again.

530
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,453
你想自杀吗?
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

531
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,086
- 不 我要再试一次 - 不 想都别想
- No. I want to go again. - No. Forget it.

532
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,523
不准再骑机车
No more bikes.

533
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,023
噢 你的额头
Man, your head.

534
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,333
- 是的 - 噢 天哪 对不起
- Yeah. - Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

535
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,236
什么 你为自己流血而道歉?
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?

536
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,175
我想是的
Yeah. I guess I am.

537
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,948
只流了一点血 Bella 不严重
Well, it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.

538
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,484
来
There.

539
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,122
你盯啥呢?
What are you staring at?

540
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,629
你长得还挺帅
You're sort of beautiful.

541
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,844
你脑子被撞傻了?
How hard did you hit your head?

542
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,340
我不知道
I don't know.

543
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,118
我们走吧
Let's go.

544
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:09,024
我确实在树林里看见过
I did see something in the woods.

545
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:10,958
宝贝 我相信你
Totally. Baby, I believe you.

546
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,326
不 他不信 他只想撞运罢了
No, he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky.

547
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:18,758
没有 那玩意乌黑乌黑的 非常大
No, okay. It was jet black and huge.

548
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,668
四脚触地 还比人要高
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.

549
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:22,932
可能是熊?
A bear, maybe?

550
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,474
或者是外星人 你没被针戳算你走运
Or an alien. You're lucky you didn't get probed.

551
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,868
我看见它了
Well, I saw it.

552
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,638
不只你看见过
You know, you're not the only one.

553
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,111
我爸爸在警局接到举报
My dad's been getting reports at the station.

554
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,120
5个背包客被啥熊杀害
Like, five hikers have been killed by some bear.

555
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,315
但却一直找不到那只熊
But they can't find the bear.

556
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,379
呃
Hmm.

557
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:46,360
这是你们丫最后一次敢怀疑我女朋友
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.

558
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,086
呃...
Um...

559
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,934
那么...
So? I mean,

560
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,396
Bella回来了?
Bella's back?

561
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,800
我想是的
Yeah, I guess so.

562
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,436
很好 这个...  欢迎你
All right, that's... Well, welcome.

563
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,541
听着 既然你又开始说话
So, listen, now that you're talking

564
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:12,715
吃饭 你好歹得补点蛋白质
and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there,

565
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:19,057
不知...你要不要和我一起去看电影
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.

566
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,728

我们可以去看
Let me see, we could check out

569
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,272
"终究是爱"
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.

570
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,472
片名有点俗 但是部浪漫喜剧
You know, it's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy.

571
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,380
- 应该会蛮... - 不 不要浪漫的
- I mean, it's supposed to be pretty... - No. No romance.

572
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:47,514
"一击即中"怎么样? 听说过这部电影吗?
How about Face Punch? Have you heard of that?

573

586
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,148

Not really.

587
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,893
听说不好看 很烂
I heard it sucks. Bad.

588
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,301
你够年纪看这电影?
Are you even old enough to see this movie?

589
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,000
没有成人监督下可以吗?
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision.

590
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:38,040
噢 她在帮我买票

Jessica耍约 Angela得了肠胃炎

593

Eric在照顾她
so Eric's taking care of her.

594
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,577
- 只有我们仨 - 很好!

595
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:52,211
- 很好 - 是的
- Great. - Yeah.

596
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,723
把枪放下
Put your gun down.

597
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,489
你把枪放下 否则我就打爆你的脑袋
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.

598
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:02,031
你们俩都把枪放下
Both of you put both of your guns down

599
00:50:02,098 --> 00:50:04,828
否则我就打爆你们俩的脑袋
or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.

600
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,703
好吧 算了 我们开战吧!
All right, forget it, let's do this!

601
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,647
我想我要吐了
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.

602
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:36,161
他...
He's...

603
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,330
真是脆弱啊!
What a marshmallow!

604
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:42,927
你得找个肠胃坚强点的人
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.

605
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,464
嘲笑让懦弱男人呕吐的血腥场面的人
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.

606
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,374
好的 我会留意的
Yeah. I'll keep my eye open for that.

607
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:55,016
我好内疚哦 他可能得了流感了
I feel bad. He probably has that flu that's going around.

608
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,687
怎么了 我不能牵你的手吗?
What? I can't hold your hand?

609
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,782
能 你当然能
No, of course you can.

610
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:09,656
我只是认为这动作对你来说有特殊含义 所以...
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you. So...

611
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:15,269
好吧 说出来吧 你喜欢我 对吧?
Okay, well, tell me something. You like me, right?

612
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,772
而且你觉得我挺帅的?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?

613
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:27,476
Jacob 拜托 不要这样
Jacob, please, don't do this.

614
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,349
为什么?
Why?

615
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,593
因为你会毁了这一切的
Because you're about to ruin everything.

616
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,061
而且我需要你
And I need you.

617
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,444
我有大把的时间
Well, I've got loads of time.

618

我不会放弃的
I'm not gonna give up.

619
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,210
我也不想你放弃
I don't want you to,

620
00:52:04,487 --> 00:52:07,684
但那只因我不想你离开
but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.

621
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:12,490
这真是自私啊
And that's really selfish.

622
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,230
我不像一辆能被你修好的汽车
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.

623
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:27,400
我再也不会正常行驶了 所以我对你该公平些
I'm never gonna run right. So I should be fair to you.

624
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,076
都是因为他 是不是?
It's because of him, right?

625
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,620
听着
Look,

626
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,695
我知道他对你做了什么
I know what he did to you.

627
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:53,297
但是Bella 我永远也不会那样做的
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.

628
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:59,202
我永远也不会伤害你 我发誓
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.

629
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,610
我不会令你失望的
I won't let you down.

630
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,480
你能依靠我
You can count on me.

631
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,312
好了
Well,

632
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,458
我得回家了
I need to go home.

633
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,472
电影前我就觉得想吐了

634
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,042

What is your problem?

635
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,376
现在吗? 就是你
Right now? You're my problem.

636
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:42,381
想吐? 或许你应该去医院了
Feeling sick? Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

637
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,351
想让我把你送进医院吗
You want me to put you in the hospital?

638
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,755
Jake 电影都放完了 你这是在干什么?
Jake! Jake. Jake, the movie's over. What are you doing?

639
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,787

You're really hot.

640
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,628
好像发烧了似的 你还好吗
Like, you feel like you have a fever. Are you okay?

641
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,932
我不知道怎么了
I don't know what's happening.

642
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,395

I gotta go.

643
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,173
那家伙太奇怪了
That dude is weird.

644
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:16,412
Jake 你爸说你得了单细胞核增多症
Jake, your dad says you have mono.

645
00:54:16,986 --> 00:54:20,149
他不让我来看你 你能回个电话吗
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?

646
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,323
嘿 还是我 我只是...

I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.

648

I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.

649
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,142

00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,510
我只是需要...给我点
I just need... Maybe give me, like,

687
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,607
- 时间或什么的 - 不用了
- some time or something. - Look, don't.

688
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:37,075
不是因为你
It's not you.

689
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,890
不怪你 是我 对吗?
It's not you, it's me, right? Really?

690
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:46,158
是真的 因为我
It's true. It is me.

691
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:51,225
我不够好
I'm not good.

692
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:57,234
我曾经是个乖孩子的
I used to be a good kid.

693
00:57:58,574 --> 00:57:59,973
再也不是了
Not anymore.

694
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,738
这一点儿也不重要 行吗
This doesn't even matter. All right?

695
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,036
全结束了
This is over.

696
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,275
你不能和我分手
You can't break up with me.

697
00:58:09,218 --> 00:58:10,480
我是说...
I mean...

698
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,118
你是我最好的朋友啊
I mean, you're my best friend.

699
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,389
你保证过的
You promised me.

700
00:58:19,862 --> 00:58:21,193
我知道
I know.

701
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,761
我保证过不会伤害你 Bella
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.

702
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:28,161
我正在坚守我的誓言
And this is me keeping that promise.

703
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,269
回家吧
Go home

704
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,443
不要回来 不然你会受伤的
and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.

705
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,288
Alice
Alice,

706
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,816
一切都...
things are...

707
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,363
又变的糟糕了
Things are bad again.

708
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,660
没有了Jake 我...我坚持不下去了
Without Jake, I just... I can't stand it.

709
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,303
我再没见到Edward了
I don't see Edward anymore.

710
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,677
真能做到像他从未存在过一般么?
Will it really feel like he never existed?

711
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,349
我会找到能见到他的地方
I will find the place where I can see him again.

712
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:16,839
Bella
Bella.

713
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,142
Laurent
Laurent.

714
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,641
没想到在这儿能见到你
I didn't expect to find you here.

715
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:30,088
我去拜访Cullen一家 但房子空了
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.

716
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,953
我真惊讶他们把你留下了
I'm surprised they left you behind.

717
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,155
你不就如
Weren't you sort of

718
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,893
他们的个宠物吗?
a pet of theirs?

719
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,428
是 可以这么说吧
Yeah. You could say that.

720
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,837
Cullen一家经常看你吗?
Do the Cullens visit often?

721
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,035
撒谎
Lie.

722
01:00:56,652 --> 01:00:57,914
是的 当然 一直有来
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.

723
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,578
编好点
Lie better.

724
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:02,249
我会告诉他们你来过的
I'll tell them that you stopped by.

725
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,054
或许我不应该
But I probably shouldn't

726
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:08,190
告诉Edward
tell Edward,

727
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,364
因为他太保护我了
'cause he's pretty protective.

728
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,629
但是他远在天边 不是吗
But he's far away, isn't he?

729
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,302
你为什么来这?
Why are you here?

730
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:22,743
算是帮Victoria一个忙
I came as a favor to Victoria.

731
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,739
- Victoria? - 她让我来看看
- Victoria? - She asked me to see

732
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:31,446
你是不是还在Cullen庇护之下
if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.

733
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,921
鉴于Edward杀了她的伴侣
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate,

734
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,153
Victoria觉得只有杀了他的才够公平
given he killed hers.

735
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:38,989
以牙还牙
An eye for an eye.

736
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:40,856
威胁他
Threaten him.

737
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,422
Edward会知道是谁干的 他会找你算账的
Edward would know who did it. And he'd come after you.

738
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,402
我不这么认为
I don't think he will.

739
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,573
毕竟 他把你毫无庇护地丢在这儿
After all, how much could you mean to him

740
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:54,499
你对他能算是什么?
if he left you here unprotected?

741
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,871
我杀了你Victoria会不高兴的
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you,

742
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,940
但我忍不住
but I can't help myself.

743
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,014
你太令人垂涎欲滴了
You are so mouth-watering.

744
01:02:04,086 --> 01:02:07,817
- 求你不要 你帮过我们的 - 不不不
- Please, don't. I mean, you helped us. - No, no, no, no.

745
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:12,256
别害怕 我这是在帮你
Don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.

746
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:15,223
Victoria打算慢慢折磨死你
Victoria plans on killing you slowly,

747
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:17,830
痛苦地
painfully,

748
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:21,031
但是我会很快了结你
whereas I'll make it quick.

749
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,769
我保证
I promise.

750
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,764
你什么都感觉不到
You will feel nothing.

751
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,141
Edward 我爱你
Edward, I love you.

752
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,213
我不相信
I don't believe it.

753
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,813
- 爸 我看见它们了 - 怎么了?
- Dad! I saw them. - What's the matter?

754
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,915
- 在树林里 不是熊 - 在树林里 什么意思?
- In the woods. They're not bears. - What do you mean "in the woods"?

755
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,721
Bell 你去树林里干什么
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?

756
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:55,525
它们是狼 巨型的狼
They're wolves. I mean, they're like huge wolves.

757
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,463
你确信 Bella?
Are you sure about that, Bella?

758
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,764
是的 我刚刚看见它们 它们在追赶着什么
Yeah! I just saw them. They were after something.

759
01:04:01,937 --> 01:04:03,165
狼?
Wolves?

760
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,807
你看见它们了?
You saw them?

761
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,004
好吧 Harry
All right, well, Harry,

762
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:15,614
想打猎么 把你的伙计们聚起来?
feel like going hunting? Get some of your guys together?

763
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,110
当然 只是...
Sure, yeah, I'll just...

764
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,720
眼下那些狼该没命了
By now, those wolves will be dead,

765
01:04:23,325 --> 01:04:26,385
Laurent会告诉她我毫无保护
and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.

766
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,724
Victoria
Victoria.

767
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:30,955
我要去局里
I should go to the station.

768
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,467
是的 你应该去
Yeah, you should. You should go.

769
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,469
你能待在屋里吗?
Can you just stay in the house?

770
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:02,759
Bella
Bella!

771
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:06,867
你吓着我了
You scared me.

772
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:10,394
- 你到底在干什么? - 后退 我要上来了
- What the hell are you doing? - Back up. I'm coming up.

773
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:23,845
嘿
Hey.

774
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:27,716
听着 我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

775
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:37,095
- 为什么? - 真希望我能解释
- For what? - I wish I could explain.

776
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:40,329
但我真不能说
But I literally can't.

777
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:52,445
你有过不能告诉任何人的秘密吗?
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone,

778
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,850
不能与他人分享的秘密?
one that wasn't yours to share?

779
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,279
我就是这样
Well, that's what it's like for me.

780
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:02,888
但更糟糕
But worse.

781
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,661
你不知道我被拘束得多紧
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.

782
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:10,264
我讨厌这样
I hate this.

783
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,191
我恨他们对你做的
I hate what they've done to you.

784
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,743
我是说 吸血鬼的那部分 你已经知道了
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.

785
01:06:34,823 --> 01:06:39,556
Bella 你记得我们在拉普什海滩上散步吗?
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?

786
01:06:41,096 --> 01:06:42,393
那个...
The...

787
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:49,064
那个关于
The story. The story about

788
01:06:50,372 --> 01:06:51,999
吸血鬼的故事
the cold ones.

789
01:06:53,742 --> 01:06:57,473
我已经知道为什么你只记得那部分了
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.

790
01:07:04,486 --> 01:07:08,354
一定有些什么你能做的
There's gotta be something that you can do.

791
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,449
不 我生来如此
No. I'm in it for life.

792
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,522
或许我们应该离开一阵子
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.

793
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,462
只管离开
Just leave,

794
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,159
只有你和我
just you and me.

795
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:20,193
你愿意这样?
You'd do that?

796
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,307
为了你 我会的
I would do it for you.

797
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,947
这不是我能一逃了之的事情 Bella
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.

798
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:39,376
但如果可以
But I would run away with you

799
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,058
我会和你一起逃开
if I could.

800
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,429
我要走了 他们会起疑我去哪儿了
I gotta go. They'll start wondering where I am.

801
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,072
过来
Come here.

802
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:03,641
请你
Please,

803
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,477
试着记住
try to remember.

804
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:10,210
如果你知道一切
It'd be so much easier

805
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:13,045
你会好受很多
if you knew.

806
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,015
我会的 但是Jake...
I'll try. But, Jake...

807
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:21,557
Jake 你在干什么 等等 Jake
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.

808
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:29,864
Jake
Jake.

809
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:48,518
Edward 我很害怕
Edward, I'm scared.

810
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,718
你应当如此
You should be.

811
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,732
这只是个古老传说了
Really, it's just like an old story.

812
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,665
我真的应该什么也不说的
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.

813
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:03,535
你知道Quileute族是狼的后代吗?
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?

814
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:19,615
Bella
Bella?

815
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:21,784
我要见他
I need to see him.

816
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:24,048
他不在
He's not in.

817
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:29,027
- 我很抱歉 我真的需要见见他 - Bella
- Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him. - Bella!

818
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:46,674
你们做什么了
What did you do?

819
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:48,707
- 你们都做了什么? - 嘿
- Okay, what did you do? - Hey.

820
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,183
- 你们对他怎么样了? - 放松
- What did you do to him? - Easy!

821
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,310
他不想这样
He didn't want this.

822
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,753
我们做什么了 他呢 他告诉你什么了?
What did we do? What did he do? What'd he tell you?

823
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,255
- 你们都冷静点儿 - 什么也没有
- Both of you calm down. - Nothing.

824
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:58,418
他什么也没告诉我 因为他害怕你们
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.

825
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:05,499
- 太迟了 - Bella 回去
- Too late now. - Bella, get back!

826
01:10:06,668 --> 01:10:09,398
Paul 冷静下来 现在
Paul, calm down, now!

827
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:19,274
Bella
Bella!

828
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:21,642
快跑
Run!

829
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,218
Jake 快跑
Jake, run!

830
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,574
Paul
Paul!

831
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,888
嘿 把Bella带回Emily那儿
Hey! Take Bella back to Emily's place.

832
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,997
看起来狼的秘密暴露了
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

833
01:11:16,004 --> 01:11:19,872
Alice 这一切有可能是真的吗?
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?

834
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,976
童话和恐怖故事
The fairy tales and horror stories?

835
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:26,606
是否可能理智与正常根本不存在?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?

836
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,684
嘿 我觉得该回去看看Jacob是不是安好了
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.

837
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:33,414
我希望Paul用牙咬他 他是罪有应得
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him. Serves him right.

838
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,286
没可能 Jacob是天才
No way. Jacob's a natural.

839
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:39,088
你看他跑时的样子没? 我打包票Paul根本碰不到他
You see him phase on the fly? I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.

840
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,595
进来 Bella 我们不会咬你的
Come on in, Bella. We won't bite.

841
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,727
说你自己呢吧
Speak for yourself.

842
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,891
* I done me wrong *
I done me wrong

843
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,164
* And done all wrong *
And done all wrong

844
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:53,364
* All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long *
All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long

845
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:58,038
嘿 Emily Sam的未婚妻 别盯着看 Sam最讨厌那样
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiance? Don't stare. It bugs Sam.

846
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:02,377
我为什么要盯着
Why would I stare?

847
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,579
伙计们饿了没 真是明知故问
Are you guys hungry? Like I have to ask.

848
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,587
这位是
Who's this?

849
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,494
Bella Swan 还能有谁
Bella Swan. Who else?

850
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,190
嗯
Hmm.

851
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:21,532
那么 你是吸血鬼的女友
So, you're the vampire girl.

852
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,632
那么 你是狼人的女友
So, you're the wolf girl.

853
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:30,944
算是
Guess so.

854
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,573
我都和个狼人订婚了
Well, I'm engaged to one.

855
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:41,447
给你兄弟留点儿吧 女士优先 要松饼吗?
Save some for your brothers. And ladies first. Muffin?

856
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,981
当然 谢谢
Sure. Thanks.

857
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,551
让Jacob自己想办法琢磨Sam的禁言令吧
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.

858
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,298
他什么也没对我说
He didn't say anything to me.

859
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:51,525
那是狼族的事儿
That's a wolf thing.

860
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,091
老大的命令要无条件服从
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.

861
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:56,433
知道吗 我们能读懂彼此的想法
And check it out. We can hear each other's thoughts.

862
01:12:56,505 --> 01:13:00,373
能闭嘴么 这些可是秘密 丫的!
Would you shut up? These are trade secrets. Damn it!

863
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:03,008
这小妞和吸血鬼一路的
This chick runs with vampires.

864
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,606
我可跟不上他们的脚步
You can't really run with vampires.

865
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:10,449
他们太快了
'Cause they're fast.

866
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,450
真的么 我们速度更快
Yeah? Well, we're faster.

867
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,517
吓到了没?
Freaked out yet?

868
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,660
你不是我见到的第一个怪物了
You're not the first monsters I've met.

869
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,562
Jake说对了 你很能接受奇怪事物
Jake's right. You're good with weird.

870
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:26,494
嘿
Hey.

871
01:13:45,887 --> 01:13:47,252
抱歉
Sorry.

872
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,568
那么 你是狼人?
So you're a werewolf?

873
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,774
是的 千真万确
Yeah. Last time I checked.

874
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:13,106
部落里一小部分幸运儿有这个基因
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.

875
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:17,283
吸血鬼搬进城了 我就全身发烧
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.

876
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:20,947
单核细胞增多症
Mono.

877
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,215
我倒希望是
Yeah. I wish.

878
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:31,557
你们找不到方法停止吗?
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?

879
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:36,093
我的意思是 这不对
I mean, it's wrong.

880
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:41,232
这可不是选择生活方式 Bella
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.

881
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:44,373
天生的 我也管不住
I was born this way. I can't help it.

882
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:47,643
你真虚伪 怎么 我不是你要的那款怪物?
You're such a hypocrite. What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?

883
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:49,616
这无关你是什么种族
It's not what you are.

884
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,419
是你做了什么 他们从未伤害任何人
It's what you do. They never hurt anybody.

885
01:14:55,857 --> 01:14:57,290
你们杀人了 Jake
You've killed people, Jake.

886
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,759
Bella 我们没杀过任何人
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

887
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,229
那是谁干的?
Then who is?

888
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:06,267
我们试图保护你们人类免受他们伤害的
What we're trying to protect you people from,

889
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,662
那些我们唯一杀的
the only thing we do kill,

890
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,336
吸血鬼
vampires.

891
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:14,900
等下 Jake 你不能
Wait, Jake, you can't.

892
01:15:14,976 --> 01:15:17,240
别担心 我们不会动你的宝贝Cullen一家
Don't worry. We can't touch your little precious Cullens

893
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,780
除非他们违反契约
unless they violate the treaty.

894
01:15:20,348 --> 01:15:22,509
我不是这个意思
That's not what I'm saying.

895
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:25,344
你们不能杀吸血鬼 他们会...
You can't kill vampires. They'II...

896
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,482
他们会杀了你的
They'll kill you.

897
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:31,092
真的吗 我们把那个吸血鬼轻易了结了
Really? We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.

898
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,656
Laurent?
Laurent?

899
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,394
他的红发女友是下一位
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.

900
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,234
Victoria在这儿?
Victoria's here?

901
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:44,329
曾经在 那晚我们一路追踪她到加拿大边境
Was. We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.

902
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:47,842
她总回来 我们不知道她要找什么
She keeps coming back. We don't know what she's after.

903
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:49,240
我知道
I do.

904
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:53,740
我
Me.

905
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,691
别担心 我们严守这一块儿
Don't worry. We've got this place covered.

906
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:08,829
她不会接近你和Charlie的
She won't get near you or Charlie.

907
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:11,126
你小心点
Look, you've got to be careful.

908
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,327
她速度很快 远远超越你的想象
She's fast. You don't know how fast she is.

909
01:16:14,402 --> 01:16:18,270
你对我们没信心 有点侮辱人哦
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.

910
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:21,640
好吧 我得走了
All right, I'd better go.

911
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,569
你要走吗?
You gotta go?

912
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,640
是
Yeah.

913
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,509
去猎杀吸血鬼
Got a vampire to kill.

914
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,690
Alice 我没事
Alice, I'm all right.

915
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,132
除了有些孤单
Until I'm alone.

916
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,872
最近始终如此
And lately, that's all the time.

917
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,004
Jacob走了 他去猎杀Victoria
Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria.

918
01:16:56,077 --> 01:16:58,341
而Charlie在猎杀Jacob
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.

919
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,108
你又走了
And you're gone.

920
01:17:01,082 --> 01:17:02,845
Edward也走了
And so is Edward.

921
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:09,221
于是现在空无一片
And there's just nothing now.

922
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,285
你有发现吗 Harry?
You got something, Harry?

923
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:17,124
没 没有
Nope. Nothing.

924
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,740
但我知道我该去哪里
But I realize where I have to go,

925
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,333
我必须做什么才能再次见他
what I have to do to see him again.

01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:10,041
Harry怎么了?
What happened at Harry's?

969
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,980
据说Harry心脏病发作
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

970
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,215
Charlie和我爸去慰问他的家人了
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.

971
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,781
他还好吗?
Is he okay?

972
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:21,325
他过世了
He's gone.

973
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:28,560
来 我帮你弄干然后送你回家
Come on. I'll get you something dry and drive you home.

974
01:23:39,747 --> 01:23:42,307
我身上热的很呐
108 degrees over here.

975
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,413
老天!
God!

976
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,488
我的手冻僵了
My hands are freezing.

977
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,185
永不会冷的感觉一定很棒
It must be nice, never getting cold.

978
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,223
狼人都会如此
It's a wolf thing.

979
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,361
不
It's not.

980
01:23:57,999 --> 01:23:59,830
只有Jacob这样
It's a Jacob thing.

981
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,199
你真的很温暖
You're just warm.

982
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:06,540
你就像太阳一样
You're like your own sun.

983
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:13,808
这样更好 现在你了解我了
This is better, now that you know about me.

984
01:24:17,151 --> 01:24:18,379
但...
But...

985
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:26,024
你看到Emily的事了吧
You saw what happened to Emily.

986
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:30,956
Sam怒了
Sam got angry.

987
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:34,094
只是一秒钟的失控
Lost it for a split second.

988
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,596
而Em当时站得太近
Em was standing too close.

989
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:42,738
他永远无法挽回了
He'll never be able to take that back.

990
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,371
如果我对你怒了该如何?
What if I got mad at you?

991
01:24:58,826 --> 01:25:00,293
有时
Sometimes,

992
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,424
我感觉自己快要消失
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.

993
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,270
并不是说 你需要我
Okay, not that you need me

994
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:17,241
对你说这样的话
to tell you something like this,

995
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,475
但我会一直提醒你 你不会迷失自己
but I always will. You're not gonna lose yourself.

996
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,547
我不会让那种事发生的
I wouldn't let that happen.

997
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:31,052
怎么做?
How?

998
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:36,827
我会一直对你说
I'll tell you all the time

999
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:42,459
你是多么与众不同
how special you are.

1000
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:04,153
谢谢 为我所做的一切
Thank you. For everything.

1001
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,359
等等
Wait.

1002
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:16,864
这里有个吸血鬼
There's a vampire.

1003
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:19,034
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

1004
01:26:19,273 --> 01:26:22,299
我可以闻到 我带你离开这
I can smell it. I'm getting you out of here.

1005
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:24,702
那是Carlisle的车
That's Carlisle's car.

1006
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:27,737
他们在这里
They're here.

1007
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:31,643
Bella 是个圈套 停! 你跟我走!
Bella, it's a trick! Stop! You gotta come with me!

1008
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:36,850
他们不会伤害我的
They won't hurt me.

1009
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:40,325
如果Cullen一家回来  这里是他们的领地
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.

1010
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:43,162
契约规定我们只保卫自己的领地
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.

1011
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:47,292
- 在这里我不能保护你 - 好的 没事 不必
- I can't protect you here. - Okay. That's okay. You don't have to.

1012
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:51,567
你好像打算越界
You're about to cross a line.

1013
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:53,573
那就别划界线
Then don't draw one.

1014
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,137
求你?
Please?

1015
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:13,253
Alice?
Alice?

1016
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:16,121
- 哦 老天! 你怎么... - Bella!
- Oh, my God! What are you... - Bella!

1017
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:20,962
抱歉 我只是 我只是无法相信你会在这儿 你...
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here. Is...

1018
01:27:21,035 --> 01:27:24,334
能给我解释一下你怎么活下来的吗?
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?

1019
01:27:25,072 --> 01:27:26,096
什么?
What?

1020
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:29,371
我在幻象中看到你跳崖
I saw a vision of you. You jumped off a cliff.

1021
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,438
你究竟为何要自杀?
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?

1022
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,673
Charlie怎么办?
I mean, what about Charlie?

1023
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:36,512
- 怎么办... - 我不是尝试自杀
- What about... - I didn't try to kill myself.

1024
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,051
我是要跳崖
I was cliff jumping.

1025
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,882
闹着玩的!
Recreationally.

1026
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:41,353
有趣而已
It was fun.

1027
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:47,589
我从没见过如此不顾性命的蠢行
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.

1028
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,192
你...
Does...

1029
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:56,828
你告诉他了吗?
Did you tell him?

1030
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:57,962
没
No.

1031
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,370
他只是每几个月来一个电话
He only calls in once every few months.

1032
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:06,242
他说他想独处
He said he wants to be alone.

1033
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:15,453
Bella 为什么闻起来 会有可怖的落汤狗的味道?
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?

1034
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:17,880
嗯...
Um...

1035
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:20,489
可能是我
That's probably me.

1036
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:23,760
或者Jacob的气味
Or it's Jacob.

1037
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,398
Jacob是谁?
Jacob who?

1038
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,862
Jacob是狼人
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

1039
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:34,600
Bella!  狼人可不是什么志趣相投的伙伴
Bella! Werewolves are not good company to keep.

1040
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:37,742
说你自己呢吧
Speak for yourself.

1041
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,778
我来看看你是否安全
I had to see you were safe.

1042
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,084
我记得你说在这你不能保护我
I thought you couldn't protect me here.

1043
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:51,120
也许我不在意这些了
Guess I don't care.

1044
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,093
我不会伤害她的
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.

1045
01:28:58,699 --> 01:29:00,633
是 你是一个无害的Cullen家的人
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

1046
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:04,137
我说的是另外一个吸血鬼 因为你们而想杀了Bella
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.

1047
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:05,263
Victoria?
Victoria?

1048
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:07,466
是的 Victoria曾在附近出现
Yeah, Victoria's been around.

1049
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,305
我没看见过她
I didn't see her.

1050
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:13,337
我也没看见有人把你从水里救出
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.

1051
01:29:14,248 --> 01:29:17,217
我看不见你和你们那群疯狗
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.

1052
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:19,446
别惹我...
Don't get me upset...

1053
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,684
- 嘿 停 停 停 停 - ...否则给你难堪
- Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. ...or things are gonna get very ugly.

1054
01:29:29,063 --> 01:29:30,997
我给你们点时间
I'll give you a minute.

1055
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:38,062
嗨
Hey.

1056
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,768
别去其他地方 到时回这来
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna come back,

1057
01:29:41,842 --> 01:29:44,606
- 对吗? - 你一赶走这只狗我就回来
- right? - As soon as you put the dog out.

1058
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:54,986
他...
Is he...

1059
01:29:59,126 --> 01:30:00,684
还有其他Cullen家的人在吗?
Are there others? How many Cullens are here

1060
01:30:00,761 --> 01:30:02,956
他们要待多久?
and how long are they staying?

1061
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,122
没
No.

1062
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:06,761
只有Alice一个
It's just Alice.

1063
01:30:11,405 --> 01:30:14,203
她随便待多久都可
And she can stay as long as she'd like.

1064
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:18,976
那其他人会回来吗?
Well, are the rest coming back?

1065
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,344
不
No.

1066
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:29,655
据我所知不会
Not that I know of.

1067
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:32,383
还有别的事吗?
Anything else?

1068
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:38,029
就这些
That's it.

1069
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:43,897
如果没事 那你最好赶快回Sam那里
Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.

1070
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:48,771
我又这么做了
I've done it again.

1071
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,905
不断违背我的誓言
I keep breaking my promise.

1072
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,915
我们之间不必如此
We don't have to do this to each other.

1073
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:05,916
不 需要
Yes, we do.

1074
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:19,103
Bella...
Bella...

1075
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:43,588
这里是Swan家
Swan residence.

1076
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,463
他现在不在
He's not here right now.

1077
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,073
他安排葬礼去了
He's arranging a funeral.

1078
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:11,651
哪位?
Who was that?

1079
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:12,984
怎么了?
What?

1080
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,857
总是挡道
Always in the way.

1081
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:18,225
是谁?
Who was that?

1082
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:19,960
Bella 退后
Bella, step back.

1083
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:23,231
- Jake 是谁? - Bella! Bella 是Edward
- Jake, who was that? - Bella! Bella, it's Edward.

1084
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:27,239
他以为你死了 Rosalie告诉了他我来这的原因
He thinks you're dead. Rosalie told him why I came here.

1085
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:32,173
你为什么...不让我跟他说话?
Why would you... Why didn't you let me speak to him?

1086
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:33,440
- 他没有找你 - Bella
- He didn't ask for you. - Bella.

1087
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:37,075
- 我不在乎! - Bella Bella 他要去找Volturi家族
- I don't care! - Bella. Bella! He's going to the Volturi.

1088
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:39,652
他也想死
He wants to die, too.

1089
01:32:41,589 --> 01:32:44,717
他抛弃了你 Bella 他不再要你 记得吗?
JACOB: He left you, Bella. He didn't want you anymore. Remember?

1090
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:48,250
不 我不能让他因为内疚而去送死
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.

1091
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:50,794
那你爸爸怎么办?
What about your dad?

1092
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:54,732
我18岁了 从法律上讲我行动自由 而我也留了纸条
I'm 18. I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.

1093
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:58,233
求你 Bella
Please, Bella,

1094
01:32:59,673 --> 01:33:01,766
留下
just stay here.

1095
01:33:03,544 --> 01:33:05,034
为Charlie
For Charlie.

1096
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,406

Or for me.

1097
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:11,975
我必须去
I have to go.

1098
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,687
我求你
I'm begging you.

1099
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:23,762
求你
Please.

1100
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:27,126
再见 Jacob
Goodbye, Jacob.

1101
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:36,837
好吧
Okay.

1102
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:40,637
你打定主意了哈
So you've made up your minds.

1103
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,343
我有点可惜你的天赋
I'm afraid your particular gifts

1104
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,810
如此珍贵不应毁灭
are too valuable to destroy.

1105
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:52,617
如果你惋叹命运不幸 可加入我们
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.

1106
01:34:53,754 --> 01:34:57,485
我们也乐意利用你的的能力
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.

1107
01:34:58,425 --> 01:35:00,985
你何不考虑下留在我们这里吗?
Won't you consider staying with us?

1108
01:35:02,763 --> 01:35:05,129
你明知早晚会如此
You know it will happen anyway.

1109
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,099
但不会毫无由头
Not without cause.

1110
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,930
暴殄天物!
Such a waste.

1111
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:21,978
我猜这辆你不是租来的吧?
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?

1112
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:24,108
我想你眼下不会介意我偷车
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.

1113
01:35:24,184 --> 01:35:25,549
今天不会
Not today.

1114
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:30,550
怎么了? 你看到什么了?
What? What do you see?

1115
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:32,524
他们拒绝了他
They refused him.

1116
01:35:32,593 --> 01:35:35,027
- 那? - 他想暴露身份
- So? - He's gonna make a scene.

1117
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:38,160
- 把自己的身份暴露给人类 - 不! 什么时候?
- Show himself to the humans. - No! When?

1118
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:42,259
他会等到正午 太阳升到最高点
He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.

1119
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:46,233
天呢 Alice 你开快点
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.

1120
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:48,207
那就是沃特拉
There's Volterra.

1121
01:36:12,967 --> 01:36:15,800
- 为何他们都身着红装? - 庆祝圣马库斯节
- Why are they all in red? - San Marco's Day festival.

1122
01:36:15,869 --> 01:36:18,702
纪念吸血鬼被逐出这个城市
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.

1123
01:36:18,772 --> 01:36:20,103
背景很完美
It's the perfect setting.

1124
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,734
在此暴露 Volturi家族绝不会放过他
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.

1125
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,539
我们只有5分钟
We have five minutes.

1126
01:36:24,611 --> 01:36:26,875
我知道 Bella 深呼吸
I know, Bella, just breathe.

1127
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:33,976
Alice!
Alice!

1128
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:36,249
Bella 你是唯一一个他不会想到会来的人
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.

1129
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:39,383
换成我 他会读我思维 他会因为我的欺骗而选择速死
If I go, he'll read my thoughts. He'll think I'm lying. He'll rush into it.

1130
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:43,493
- 我去哪找? - 他就在钟塔下面 快!
- Where do I go? - He'll be under the clock tower. Go!

1131
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:37,274
别!
Don't!

1132
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:40,506
这是天堂
Heaven.

1133
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,242
必须进去
You have to move.

1134
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:45,847
睁开眼睛 看看我 我还活着
Open your eyes. Look at me. I'm alive.

1135
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,349
必须进去
You have to move.

1136
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:50,451
Bella
Bella.

1137
01:38:57,931 --> 01:39:00,024
- 你来了 - 是我
- You're here. - I'm here.

1138
01:39:02,903 --> 01:39:04,097
你还活着
You're alive.

1139
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:08,768
对
Yes.

1140
01:39:18,218 --> 01:39:20,812
我想让你再次看到我
I needed to make you see me once.

1141
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:23,152
必须让你知道我还活着
You had to know that I was alive,

1142
01:39:23,223 --> 01:39:26,351
这样你就不必内疚
that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.

1143
01:39:29,229 --> 01:39:31,823
现在我可以让你走了
I can let you go now.

1144
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:38,764
我绝不是因为内疚
I never acted out of guilt.

1145
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:44,700
没有你我活不下去
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.

1146
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:48,138
- 但你说... - 我骗你的
- But you said... - I lied.

1147
01:39:48,849 --> 01:39:51,943
我必须撒谎 但你却那么轻易就信了
I had to lie. But you believed me so easily.

1148
01:39:57,591 --> 01:40:01,186
因为你爱我 这说不通啊
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.

1149
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:07,492
我一无是处 我是人类 无关紧要
I mean, I'm nothing. I'm human. I'm nothing.

1150
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:12,263
Bella 你于我是一切
Bella, you're everything to me.

1151
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:15,936
全部
You're everything.

1152
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:43,761
我现在不需要你们的帮忙了 绅士们
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.

1153
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:45,930
Aro想再次跟你聊聊
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1154
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:47,234
没有破坏规矩
No rules were broken.

1155
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:51,505
虽说如此 咱应该到个更适合的审判地谈吧
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.

1156
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:52,840
好吧
Fine.

1157
01:40:54,147 --> 01:40:56,513
Bella 要不你和大家一起欢度节日?
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?

1158
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:57,948
这女孩必须跟我们一起走
The girl comes with us.

1159
01:40:58,018 --> 01:40:59,713
不 你去死吧
No. You can go to hell.

1160
01:41:02,089 --> 01:41:03,681
别逗了 伙计们
Come on, guys.

1161
01:41:03,924 --> 01:41:07,325
这是庆祝节日 你们也不愿引起骚动
It's a festival. You wouldn't want to make a scene.

1162
01:41:08,161 --> 01:41:09,594
我们不想
We wouldn't.

1163
01:41:09,963 --> 01:41:11,294
够了
Enough.

1164
01:41:12,866 --> 01:41:13,992
Jane
Jane.

1165
01:41:14,801 --> 01:41:17,793
Aro派我来看下为何要这么久
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.

1166
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:27,814
按她吩咐的意思做
Just do as she says.

1167
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:41,759
你们先请
Go ahead.

1168
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,427
别害怕
Don't be scared.

1169
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:49,699
你呢?
Are you?

1170
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:51,763
不
No.

1171
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:32,471
- 她是人类? - 是
- Is she human? - Yes.

1172
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:37,276
她知道这一切?
Does she know?

1173
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:38,911
是
Yes.

1174
01:42:39,286 --> 01:42:41,049
那为何...
Then, why would...

1175
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:44,486
想要成为...
She wants to be.

1176
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:46,357
她会转变的
And so she will be.

1177
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:47,859
或者成为甜点
Or dessert.

1178
01:42:56,370 --> 01:43:00,170
妹妹 让你抓一个你却带回来两个
Sister. They send you out to get one and you bring back two.

1179
01:43:00,907 --> 01:43:02,374
还有半个
And a half.

1180
01:43:03,543 --> 01:43:04,942
真是个聪明姑娘
Such a clever girl.

1181
01:43:05,011 --> 01:43:06,911
真是个惊喜!
What a happy surprise!

1182
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:10,609
Bella终究还是活着呐
Bella is alive after all.

1183
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:14,180
简直棒极了哈?
Isn't that wonderful?

1184
01:43:15,288 --> 01:43:17,188
我喜欢圆满的结局
I love a happy ending.

1185
01:43:18,291 --> 01:43:19,280
啊
Ah.

1186
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:23,459
罕见啊
They are so rare.

1187
01:43:30,303 --> 01:43:32,828
她甜美的鲜血如此吸引你
Her blood appeals to you so much

1188
01:43:34,107 --> 01:43:35,938
都让我饥渴了
it makes me thirsty.

1189
01:43:36,209 --> 01:43:38,973
你距她一步之遥何以忍住?
How can you stand to be so close to her?

1190
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:42,171
- 并不容易 - 是 我可以理解
- It's not without difficulty. - Yes, I can see that.

1191
01:43:45,585 --> 01:43:49,146
Aro只要轻轻一摸 就可以知道我所有的想法
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.

1192
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:52,385
现在你知晓一切了
And now you know everything.

1193
01:43:53,026 --> 01:43:54,789
那就继续吧
So get on with it.

1194
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:01,128
你的读心术也很不错啊 Edward
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.

1195
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:07,035
尽管如此你却无法获悉Bella的想法
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1196
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:11,911
妙啊!
Fascinating.

1197
01:44:15,449 --> 01:44:20,819
我很愿意看看你是否也能防御我的能力
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.

1198
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:25,684
肯赏光吗?
Would you do me the honor?

1199
01:44:46,546 --> 01:44:47,979
有趣
Interesting.

1200
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:49,337
嗯
Hmm.

1201
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:51,742
我什么都没有读到
I see nothing.

1202
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:02,618
我非常好奇...
I wonder if...

1203
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:06,432
让咱看看她是否对我们所有的能力都免疫
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.

1204
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:09,468
能展示下吗 Jane?
Shall we, Jane?

1205
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:13,067
- 不! - 疼痛
- No! - Pain.

1206
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:30,453
住手!
Stop!

1207
01:45:31,291 --> 01:45:33,020
住手! 求你! 住手!
Stop! Please! Stop!

1208
01:45:33,093 --> 01:45:36,961
住手! 别伤害她! 求你! 求你!
Stop! Just stop hurting him! Please! Please!

1209
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:39,893
Jane?
Jane?

1210
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:42,991
主人?
Master?

1211
01:45:47,574 --> 01:45:49,303
继续 亲爱的
Go ahead, my dear.

1212
01:45:54,814 --> 01:45:57,009
这可能会有些痛
This may hurt just a little.

1213
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:14,633
太不可思议!
Remarkable!

1214
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:19,100
她挫败了我们所有人
She confounds us all.

1215
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,337
那我们现在该如何处置你呢?
So what do we do with you now?

1216
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:26,971
你已知道怎么做 Aro
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.

1217
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:29,846
她知道的太多了
She knows too much.

1218
01:46:30,383 --> 01:46:32,146
她是个负担
She's a liability.

1219
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,509
嗯
Hmm.

1220
01:46:36,122 --> 01:46:37,680
的确如此
That's true.

1221
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:42,823
Felix?
Felix?

1222
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:47,791
不!
No!

1223
01:47:49,362 --> 01:47:52,456
求你! 不! 不! 求你! 求你!
Please! No! No! Please, please!

1224
01:47:55,335 --> 01:47:58,463
杀了我! 杀了我! 别伤害他
Kill me! Kill me! Not him.

1225
01:48:09,482 --> 01:48:12,007
多特别啊!
How extraordinary.

1226
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:18,157
你竟然愿意为我们这类放弃生命
You would give up your life for someone like us.

1227
01:48:19,259 --> 01:48:20,624
为吸血鬼
A vampire.

1228
01:48:22,028 --> 01:48:24,462
一群无魂的怪物
A soulless monster.

1229
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:26,522
放她走!
Just get away from her!

1230
01:48:30,637 --> 01:48:35,074
你对他的灵魂一无所知
You don't know a thing about his soul.

1231
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:48,381
真是悲剧!
This is a sadness.

1232
01:48:50,523 --> 01:48:54,084
只要你有意使她永生
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.

1233
01:49:03,002 --> 01:49:04,264
等等!
Wait!

1234
01:49:05,905 --> 01:49:07,998
Bella会成为我们的一员
Bella will be one of us.

1235
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:11,199
我预见到了
I've seen it.

1236
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:14,913
我来初拥她
I'll change her myself.

1237
01:49:48,815 --> 01:49:50,305
令人着迷!
Mesmerizing.

1238
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:55,153
能遇见尚未发生之事
To see what you have seen before it has happened.

1239
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:02,551
你的天赋将成就一个有趣
Your gifts will make for an intriguing

1240
01:50:03,797 --> 01:50:05,230
而不朽的
immortal,

1241
01:50:06,299 --> 01:50:07,823
Isabella
Isabella.

1242
01:50:12,705 --> 01:50:14,138
去吧
Go now.

1243
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:16,809
做好准备
Make your preparations.

1244
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:19,601
我们来亲自来处理
Let us be done with this.

1245
01:50:21,447 --> 01:50:23,711
Heidi随时会到
Heidi will arrive any moment.

1246
01:50:25,585 --> 01:50:28,986
感谢你们的拜访
Thank you for your visit.

1247
01:50:29,055 --> 01:50:30,613
我们也会热情回馈
We will return the favor.

1248
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:33,659
我建议你们立即实现诺言
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.

1249
01:50:33,726 --> 01:50:36,092
下不为例
We do not offer second chances.

1250
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:40,824
再见 我的年轻朋友们
Goodbye, my young friends.

1251
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:49,038
收获不错 Heidi
Nice fishing, Heidi.

1252
01:50:49,108 --> 01:50:51,338
是 他们的确看来诱人
Yes, they do look rather juicy.

1253
01:50:51,411 --> 01:50:53,140
给我留点
Save some for me.

1254
01:50:54,113 --> 01:50:56,911
走这边 一起走
This way, please. Stay together.

1255
01:51:11,564 --> 01:51:13,088
停! 停!
Stop! Stop!

1256
01:51:23,977 --> 01:51:25,501
你还在
You're here.

1257
01:51:27,547 --> 01:51:29,139
安心睡吧
You can sleep.

1258
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:35,547
你睡醒前我都会守着你
I'll still be here when you wake up.

1259
01:51:39,158 --> 01:51:42,184
Bella 我离开你的唯一原因
Bella, the only reason I left

1260
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:46,898
是我以为我是在保护你
was because I thought I was protecting you.

1261
01:51:48,768 --> 01:51:50,429
我希望你
I needed you

1262
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:54,439
有机会过上正常快乐的生活
to have a chance at a normal, happy life.

1263
01:51:58,544 --> 01:52:00,910
你可以那么轻易的离开我
It was so easy for you to leave.

1264
01:52:03,516 --> 01:52:07,179
离开你是我这一百年最艰难的事
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.

1265
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,518
我发誓
And I swear,

1266
01:52:16,863 --> 01:52:19,491
我不会再辜负你
I will never fail you again.

1267
01:52:21,801 --> 01:52:23,359
我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1268
01:52:25,772 --> 01:52:27,706
- Charlie来了 - 嗨
- Charlie's coming. - Hey.

1269
01:52:30,843 --> 01:52:32,242
你还好吗?
You okay?

1270
01:52:33,646 --> 01:52:34,908
还好
I'm fine.

1271
01:52:38,017 --> 01:52:40,178
爸 你不必担心我
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1272
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,711
上次你这样说 你出走了
You know, last time you said that, you took off.

1273
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:44,950
三天都不见
I didn't see you for three days.

1274
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:48,559
我真的很抱歉 爸爸
I'm really sorry, Dad.

1275
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:54,027
Bella 别再这么对我
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.

1276
01:52:56,869 --> 01:52:57,961
永远别
Ever.

1277
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:02,331
你被禁足了哦
And you're grounded

1278
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:04,936
终生禁足哦
for the rest of your life.

1279
01:53:06,112 --> 01:53:07,272
好吧
Okay.

1280
01:53:17,557 --> 01:53:20,355
严格说 我没有违反他的规定
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.

1281
01:53:23,363 --> 01:53:26,594
他的确有说 我不能踏进门内一步
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.

1282
01:53:27,066 --> 01:53:29,364
我是从窗子进来
I came in through the window.

1283
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:35,497
他不会这么容易原谅我的
He's not gonna forgive me easily.

1284
01:53:37,977 --> 01:53:39,274
我知道
I know.

1285
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:42,679
你呢?
Can you?

1286
01:53:46,452 --> 01:53:48,010
我希望你能
I hope you can,

1287
01:53:48,821 --> 01:53:52,018
因为没有你 我真的不知如何生活
'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.

1288
01:53:56,362 --> 01:53:57,761
过来
Come here.

1289
01:54:15,415 --> 01:54:18,384
一旦Alice把我转变
Once Alice changes me,

1290
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:23,447
你就别想再抛弃我
you can't get rid of me.

1291
01:54:24,690 --> 01:54:26,988
她不一定要转变你
She won't need to change you.

1292
01:54:27,593 --> 01:54:31,085
一定还有别的方法可以瞒住Volturi家族
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.

1293
01:54:32,799 --> 01:54:35,199
不 不
No. No.

1294
01:54:41,974 --> 01:54:43,965
你们都知道我想要的
You all know what I want.

1295
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:49,148
而我也知道我的要求有些过分
And I know how much I'm asking for.

1296
01:54:51,417 --> 01:54:54,909
我认为唯一公平的是大家投票表决
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.

1297
01:54:54,987 --> 01:54:58,354
- 你不知道你在说什么 - 闭嘴
- You don't know what you're talking about. - Shut up.

1298
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:01,153
Alice?
Alice?

1299
01:55:01,627 --> 01:55:04,187
我已经把你当成我的姐妹了
I already consider you my sister.

1300
01:55:07,967 --> 01:55:09,594
- 我同意 - 谢谢
- Yes. - Thank you.

1301
01:55:09,669 --> 01:55:11,159
我也投"同意"
JASPER: I vote "yes."

1302
01:55:12,605 --> 01:55:16,097
这样我就不用一直想要杀你
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.

1303
01:55:17,977 --> 01:55:18,966
嗯
Hmm.

1304
01:55:19,112 --> 01:55:20,443
对不起
I'm sorry.

1305
01:55:22,348 --> 01:55:25,476
我为之前的行为向你两道歉
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted,

1306
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:28,178
而且我真感激的是你足够勇敢
and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough

1307
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:30,347
去救我弟弟
to go and save my brother.

1308
01:55:31,891 --> 01:55:35,327
但换了我 我不会选择这样的生活
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.

1309
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:41,527
如果是我 我希望有人能阻止我
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.

1310
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:45,836
故此 我反对
So, no.

1311
01:55:47,273 --> 01:55:49,173
我当然投"同意"
I vote "Hell, yeah."

1312
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:53,476
我们用别的方法打击Volturi家族
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.

1313
01:55:53,546 --> 01:55:56,515
我早把你当成是家庭的一员了
I already consider you a part of the family.

1314
01:55:57,150 --> 01:55:58,378
我同意
Yes.

1315
01:56:04,257 --> 01:56:06,487
你为什么要这样对我?
Why are you doing this to me?

1316
01:56:08,194 --> 01:56:09,559
你知道里边的含义
You know what this means.

1317
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:13,497
你选择没她不活 这让我别无选择
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.

1318
01:56:14,233 --> 01:56:16,133
我不想失去我的儿子
I won't lose my son.

1319
01:56:22,341 --> 01:56:26,368
我想等到毕业以后再做 这样子Charlie会好过些
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.

1320
01:56:31,384 --> 01:56:34,319
Edward 我希望由你亲自来做
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.

1321
01:56:41,294 --> 01:56:43,387
他想和我聊会
He wants to talk to me.

1322
01:56:46,532 --> 01:56:48,159
因此你现在还活着
So you're still alive for now.

1323
01:56:48,234 --> 01:56:50,702
他认为是我把你带远了
He thinks it's me keeping you away.

1324
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:53,261
别读我的想法
You stay the hell out of my head.

1325
01:56:54,373 --> 01:56:57,865
Jacob 我知道你有话对我说
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.

1326
01:57:00,213 --> 01:57:04,115
如果可以的话 我想先对你说点什么
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.

1327
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:06,650
谢谢
Thank you.

1328
01:57:09,789 --> 01:57:13,190
谢谢你在我不在的时候保护Bella
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.

1329
01:57:13,726 --> 01:57:15,819
不 你确实不在
No. You didn't.

1330
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:20,492
我不是为你保护她 相信我
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.

1331
01:57:20,566 --> 01:57:22,431
我还是很感激
I'm still grateful.

1332
01:57:23,002 --> 01:57:24,230
但现在我回来了
But I'm here now.

1333
01:57:24,303 --> 01:57:27,033
除非她赶我走否则我不会离开她
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.

1334
01:57:27,106 --> 01:57:28,437
咱们走着瞧
We'll see.

1335
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:33,471
该我说了
Hey, my turn to talk.

1336
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:41,577
我提醒你别忘记我们契约的一个重点
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.

1337
01:57:41,754 --> 01:57:43,619
我没忘
I haven't forgotten.

1338
01:57:43,689 --> 01:57:45,247
什么重点?
What key point?

1339
01:57:45,491 --> 01:57:47,789
如果你们中任何人咬了人类
If any of them bites a human,

1340
01:57:48,561 --> 01:57:50,324
停战就会结束
the truce is over.

1341
01:57:51,731 --> 01:57:53,562
但如果我是自愿 就不关你事
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.

1342
01:57:53,633 --> 01:57:55,658
不 不 我不会让你
No. No, I won't let you.

1343
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,704
你不能变成他们的一份子 Bella
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.

1344
01:57:59,772 --> 01:58:01,672
这你不能决定
It's not up to you.

1345
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:04,741
你知道我们会怎样对你 我别无选择
You know what we'll do to you. I won't have a choice.

1346
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:06,505
Bella 拜托 走吧
Bella, please, come.

1347
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:07,739
等等
Wait.

1348
01:58:09,715 --> 01:58:12,309
他会伤害我吗? 读他的想法
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.

1349
01:58:19,659 --> 01:58:20,990
Jake
Jake,

1350
01:58:27,433 --> 01:58:29,025
我爱你
I love you.

1351
01:58:33,739 --> 01:58:35,400
所以 求你
So, please,

1352
01:58:39,979 --> 01:58:42,038
不要逼我抉择
don't make me choose,

1353
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:49,754
因为我一定选他
'cause it'll be him.

1354
01:58:53,125 --> 01:58:54,990
一直就是他
It's always been him.

1355
01:59:02,468 --> 01:59:03,799
Bella...
Bella...

1356
01:59:11,577 --> 01:59:14,705
- 再见 Jacob - 不 不用你为她说
- Goodbye, Jacob. - No, you don't speak for her!

1357
01:59:19,485 --> 01:59:21,476
Bella 咱们走
Bella, get out of here.

1358
01:59:23,255 --> 01:59:24,620
停!
Stop!

1359
01:59:26,826 --> 01:59:28,123
停!
Stop!

1360
01:59:28,194 --> 01:59:31,254
你们互相伤害 我也不能幸免
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.

1361
01:59:50,282 --> 01:59:51,408
Jake
Jake.

1362
02:00:06,465 --> 02:00:07,898
他是对的
He's right.

1363
02:00:09,034 --> 02:00:11,468
你不该变成我这样
You shouldn't become what I am.

1364
02:00:16,675 --> 02:00:18,336
我一个人做不到
I can't do this alone.

1365
02:00:21,013 --> 02:00:22,981
那就请等等
Then, please, just wait.

1366
02:00:29,989 --> 02:00:32,617
给我五年的时间
Just give me five years.

1367
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:39,857
这太长了
That's too long.

1368
02:00:44,336 --> 02:00:45,803
那么三年?
Then three?

1369
02:00:50,509 --> 02:00:52,306
你真固执
You're so stubborn.

1370
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:56,273
你要等什么?
What are you waiting for?

1371
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:08,084
我有一个条件
I have one condition

1372
02:01:10,563 --> 02:01:13,031
如果你要我亲自来的话
if you want me to do it myself.

1373
02:01:17,169 --> 02:01:19,000
什么条件?
What's the condition?

1374
02:01:19,605 --> 02:01:21,300
约束永远
And then forever.

1375
02:01:23,075 --> 02:01:24,975
正如我愿
That's what I'm asking.

1376
02:01:36,322 --> 02:01:37,983
嫁给我 Bella
Marry me, Bella.

1377
02:01:55,322 --> 02:01:59,983
<font color="#ffff00">新月 -=结束=-</font>

1378
02:04:12,544 --> 02:04:16,412
White demon love song down the hall

1379
02:04:18,117 --> 02:04:22,451
White demon shadow on the road

1380
02:04:23,656 --> 02:04:27,752
Back up your mind, there is a call

1381
02:04:29,161 --> 02:04:32,892
He isn't coming after all

1382
02:04:32,965 --> 02:04:35,160
Love this time

1383
02:04:35,234 --> 02:04:39,398
She likes the way he sings

1384
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:44,198
White demon love song's in her dreams

1385
02:04:48,447 --> 02:04:52,679
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?

1386
02:04:53,986 --> 02:04:58,355
White demon sorrow will arrange

1387
02:04:59,525 --> 02:05:03,689
Let's not forget about the fear

1388
02:05:04,997 --> 02:05:10,401
Black invitation to this place that cannot change

1389
02:05:10,469 --> 02:05:15,702
While strangely holy

1390
02:05:15,941 --> 02:05:19,138
Come for a rain

1391
02:05:24,650 --> 02:05:29,713
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1392
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:35,627
White demon, who let your friend go?

1393
02:05:35,694 --> 02:05:40,563
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1394
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:47,969
White demon, who let your friend go?

1395
02:05:50,843 --> 02:05:56,304
- Let us be in love - Let us be in love

1396
02:05:56,381 --> 02:06:01,785
- Let's do old and gray - Let's do old and gray

1397
02:06:01,854 --> 02:06:07,315
- I won't make you cry - I won't make you cry

1398
02:06:07,392 --> 02:06:12,830
- I will never stray - I will never stray

1399
02:06:12,898 --> 02:06:18,359
- I will do my part - I will do my part

1400
02:06:18,437 --> 02:06:23,966
Let us be in love tonight

1401
02:06:24,042 --> 02:06:29,344
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1402
02:06:29,414 --> 02:06:34,545
White demon, who let your friend go?

1403
02:06:34,987 --> 02:06:40,050
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1404
02:06:40,526 --> 02:06:47,159
White demon, who let your friend go?

1405
02:07:03,215 --> 02:07:07,447
Stand it anymore, darling

1406
02:07:08,587 --> 02:07:09,952
Stand it

1407
02:07:18,964 --> 02:07:22,866
Meet me on the equinox

1408
02:07:22,935 --> 02:07:25,733
Meet me halfway

1409
02:07:25,804 --> 02:07:29,103
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1410
02:07:29,174 --> 02:07:32,940
In the middle of the day

1411
02:07:33,011 --> 02:07:36,412
Let me give my love to you

1412
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:39,679
Let me take your hand

1413
02:07:40,118 --> 02:07:43,576
As we walk in the dimming light

1414
02:07:43,655 --> 02:07:46,783
Oh, darling, understand

1415
02:07:47,226 --> 02:07:52,186
That everything, everything ends

1416
02:07:54,266 --> 02:07:59,863
That everything, everything ends

1417
02:08:05,177 --> 02:08:08,874
Meet me on your best behavior

1418
02:08:08,947 --> 02:08:11,848
Meet me at your worst

1419
02:08:11,917 --> 02:08:15,478
For there will be no stone unturned

1420
02:08:15,554 --> 02:08:18,523
Or bubble left to burst

1421
02:08:19,191 --> 02:08:22,752
Let me lay beside you, darling

1422
02:08:23,262 --> 02:08:26,254
Let me be your man

1423
02:08:26,331 --> 02:08:29,767
And let our bodies intertwine

1424
02:08:29,835 --> 02:08:33,362
But always understand

1425
02:08:33,438 --> 02:08:38,705
That everything, everything ends

1426
02:08:40,445 --> 02:08:46,179
That everything, everything ends

1427
02:08:47,486 --> 02:08:54,221
That everything, everything, everything ends

1428
02:08:58,130 --> 02:09:00,724
A window

1429
02:09:01,667 --> 02:09:05,398
An opened tomb

1430
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:08,234
The sun crawls

1431
02:09:08,307 --> 02:09:11,936
Across your bedroom

1432
02:09:12,377 --> 02:09:14,572
A halo

1433
02:09:15,914 --> 02:09:19,441
A waiting room

1434
02:09:19,518 --> 02:09:22,453
Your last breaths

1435
02:09:22,521 --> 02:09:25,115
Moving through you

1436
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:30,457
As everything, everything ends

1437
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:37,627
As everything, everything, everything

1438
02:09:37,703 --> 02:09:44,131
Everything, everything, everything ends

1439
02:09:49,982 --> 02:09:53,782
Meet me on the equinox

1440
02:09:54,152 --> 02:09:56,746
Meet me halfway

1441
02:09:56,822 --> 02:10:00,280
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1442
02:10:00,359 --> 02:10:03,624
In the middle of the day

1443
02:10:04,162 --> 02:10:08,098
Let me give my love to you

1444
02:10:08,166 --> 02:10:10,691
Let me take your hand

1445
02:10:11,269 --> 02:10:14,568
And as we walk in the dimming light

1446
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:17,802
Oh, darling, understand

1447
02:10:17,943 --> 02:10:24,473
That everything, everything ends
