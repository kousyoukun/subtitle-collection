1
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:15,368
Let's take this outside.

2
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:19,330
You like asking questions,
so I'll ask you a few.

3
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:20,957
Traitor!

4
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,968
This looks like an Arab faggot bar.

5
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:33,887
Nothing but old people here.

6
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:38,099
I guess young people in your countries
prefer to screw tourists.

7
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:42,437
That's why you old codgers
have to screw each other.

8
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,608
I don't like wogs...

9
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,280
but queer wogs are worse
than the Holocaust!

10
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,867
Death to the wogs!

11
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:58,036
Hail François Bayrou!

12
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:00,163
Hail Nixon!

13
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,832
Hail Henri Emmanuelli!

14
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,211
Hail Harlem Désir!

15
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:09,464
You'll never pop my cherry!

16
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,174
Bunch of Taliban pussies!

17
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,344
You won't get to screw me,
don't you worry!

18
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,975
The Arab Spring
is a spring for faggots!

19
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:27,023
Algiers, Algiers, Algiers!

20
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:28,775
Sea, sex and sun!

21
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,360
Sex and sun!

22
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,817
What would have happened
without you?

23
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,571
Thanks.

24
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,576
I'm glad
nobody knows me around here.

25
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,912
If we were in Villeneuve,
I couldn't have helped you.

26
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,040
But it's the last time...

27
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,792
you moron.

28
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,047
I'm joking.

29
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,761
You need to learn
how to ask questions.

30
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,891
It's an art in itself, you know.

31
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:49,022
I might be a diabetic,
but that's not why I don't get it.

32
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:00,992
Come in!

33
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,001
The death of an informant
is always complicated.

34
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,420
We still don't know

35
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,507
if Farid Benamar was ratted out
by someone in the police precinct.

36
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:17,884
Who found the body?

37
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,054
Nadal, a television reporter.

38
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:25,266
He discovered it on a knoll
at Villeneuve, a suburb of Lille.

39
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,645
Nadal lives opposite the knoll.

40
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,231
Precinct reactions?

41
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:36,069
For 4 months, we didn't even know
that Benamar was their snitch...

42
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,113
until his wife finally told the judge.

43
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,324
Suspicions on precinct?

44
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,992
I don't really know.

45
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,954
We must find out if someone
at the precinct

46
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:50,833
gave up Benamar, either by
negligence or by treason. That's all!

47
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:04,973
Good luck, you have the intelligence
and the faculties it takes.

48
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,725
Thank you for the compliment,
Mr. Comptroller General.

49
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,811
And I won't be on my own.

50
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:10,979
Who is it?

51
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:14,107
Sally Marinelli,
she was demoted to Internal Affairs.

52
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,025
Why was she demoted?

53
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,028
Incompatibility with police ethics.

54
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,531
- Which means?
- I have no idea.

55
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,867
She was transferred
to I.A. in 2010.

56
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,912
I trust you.
You do the same.

57
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,062
I'm glad to work with you.

58
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,147
That's nice.

59
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:59,819
Walking into a police department
is so tiresome, such theatrics.

60
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:04,866
We'll keep the precinct in the dark,
let fear creep in by itself.

61
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,119
Don't give me that look, Sally.

62
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:11,414
We shouldn't let them
get to us that easily, right?

63
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:14,167
I've heard so much about you,
you know.

64
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:18,129
Sorry, excuse me,
I think it's my friend calling.

65
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,717
8 pm spot on. The hour for husbands
and television news.

66
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,018
Good night, Sally.

67
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:36,981
I'll call you back.

68
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,166
I don't know yet.

69
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,211
We didn't speak much.

70
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:01,547
I'll see how things turn out.

71
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:06,469
Be more self-conscious,
yes, I know, darling, but...

72
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,055
Agreed.

73
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,392
I kiss you goodnight.

74
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,608
It's prettier
with a sandbox and a swing.

75
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,610
I liked it more before.

76
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,657
You know there's been a murder here?
Does that ring a bell?

77
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,159
It does.

78
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:14,078
Always the same...
Harki or police snitch.

79
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:16,205
Always the same.

80
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:18,916
It is late, Madam.

81
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,402
You took up smoking again?

82
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:51,324
May I ask what you're doing here?

83
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,661
Why did they meet
Benamar at the lake beach?

84
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:59,582
- Why not directly on the knoll?
- I don't know.

85
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,336
You speak of a beach,
you speak of a lake.

86
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,397
If you all are above reproach
all will be well, Bontemps.

87
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,817
I'm not afraid of Internal Affairs.

88
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,986
So you never had any doubts?

89
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:33,366
No, with Farid Benamar
as with any informant,

90
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,243
there was a protocol...

91
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,788
Protocols are my department.
It's a passion of mine.

92
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,834
So our protocol...

93
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,587
Sorry I'm late.

94
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,006
You're kind of old!

95
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,886
Rozynski, Bontemps.
Where is Mendes, the third man?

96
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,555
They're all waiting for you.

97
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:06,440
Good morning.

98
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,069
It is important that
we get to know you.

99
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,197
These are our assistants,
Mr. Jean Marconi, Mr. Patrick Païs.

100
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:19,579
Our mission consists in understanding
how you worked with Farid Benamar

101
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,290
and to find out whether
there have been failures.

102
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:43,102
Lieutenant Delesne! Superintendent
Lafarge, Commander Marinelli!

103
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:48,232
Lieutenant Marsias! Superintendent
Lafarge, Commander Marinelli!

104
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,323
Esther memorised everybody's name
and rank in the precinct.

105
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,491
She really commands respect.

106
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:08,294
Officer Bastide! Superintendent
Lafarge, Commander Marinelli.

107
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,214
Are you done
with your trick and pony show?

108
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,468
Captain Robert Mendes...
at your service.

109
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:20,765
Farid Benamar's contact, his closest
collaborator in the precinct.

110
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:26,937
A silk blouse?
Am I mistaken or is that for me?

111
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,440
No, I always dress like this.

112
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,194
No special effort for your sake,
neither flattery nor contempt.

113
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:37,198
Madam likes sonnets.
"Neither flattery nor contempt".

114
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,034
<i>Eeny... meeny...
miney... moe...</i>

115
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,829
<i>Catch a tiger by the toe
If it's an Arab, let him go!</i>

116
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:58,719
<i>ARE WE SERIOUS
IN OUR PRACTICE OF ISLAM?</i>

117
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,246
Room service!

118
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,963
Esther, you tell me
when real work starts.

119
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,966
Did you like our visit
to the precinct?

120
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:21,635
No idea...
they looked a bit scared.

121
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,847
No kidding,
they're always scared when I drop in.

122
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:28,517
Scared, scared,
scared... of fairness, yes!

123
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:31,937
Is it a good thing?

124
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:33,939
To scare them?

125
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,525
No, fairness!

126
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,403
Truth, integrity.

127
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,782
Sally, this is
above your pay grade.

128
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,992
You'll be my little weasel.

129
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:48,913
Nosy, nosy, nosy,
gather all the tiny details.

130
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,540
My family needs me.

131
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,279
<i>RIOTS IN ALGIERS</i>

132
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:20,838
Straight on.

133
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,551
Take a right.

134
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,555
The road to the mosque.

135
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,251
I've been watching since yesterday.

136
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,836
So far, there's no one.

137
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,338
And Belkacem?

138
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:06,258
Still haven't seen her.
But I have a lot of patience.

139
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,720
I know, Younès,
that's a good quality to have.

140
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:13,015
You need to go on.
Your sister called me.

141
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,185
She thinks she's my mother.
She gets on my nerves.

142
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,980
Women deserve respect, Younès.
They need protection.

143
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,024
I told her not to worry,

144
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:25,110
that I got you
a doctor's appointment.

145
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,865
- You'll scream, but...
- Go ahead, what's up?

146
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:33,452
I'd like to go to Algiers.
Not for too long, understand?

147
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:37,539
I want to be part of it,
be there when things change.

148
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,125
No way, I need you here.

149
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,129
What the hell will you do in Algiers?

150
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,633
You haven't got a clue.
But you know what happens here.

151
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,012
You can go afterwards,
once you did what you had to do.

152
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,226
I'm not as clever as Benamar, right?

153
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:01,105
No idea, but we'll soon find out.

154
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:04,817
Belkacem will surely
ask you to do something.

155
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:10,239
Some kind of mission,
nothing complicated, messenger stuff.

156
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,824
A drop is going down.

157
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,202
How can you know? Who told you?
Where were you?

158
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:19,206
You have no idea how important
the person you question is.

159
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,041
It is our raw material.

160
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,839
That person must be emblematic,
unifying, pleasant, brilliant!

161
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,259
Anything but placid!

162
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,428
You must understand this!

163
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,139
And don't misinterpret things
you cannot see!

164
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,433
Go ahead, interpret me!
Come on!

165
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,768
What do I make you think of?

166
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,895
I don't know, chief.

167
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,856
You look like a pervert.

168
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,275
I'm no pervert, Younès.

169
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,154
I'm a professional,
and I'm teaching you to be one too.

170
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,894
We must see your mother.

171
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,189
My father painted them.

172
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:27,900
Mum!

173
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,111
Mother!

174
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,869
Mrs. Benamal?

175
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,747
Chief Superintendent Esther Lafarge,

176
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:46,085
Commander Sally Marinelli,
Internal Affairs.

177
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,892
- He got friends?
- Yes!

178
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,227
Good.

179
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,188
Most snitches live precariously.

180
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,732
Money, trafficking, jail,
money, trafficking, jail...

181
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,151
you could call it
Algerian rollercoaster.

182
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,114
You liked Farid despite
the kind of person he was,

183
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,448
I get it.

184
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,492
Consider the fallout!

185
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,995
Fallout is our domain.
And protocol even more.

186
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,123
I don't understand you.

187
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,458
Protocols are very revealing.

188
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,376
Protocols?

189
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,087
- For snitches!
- How's that?

190
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,256
You knew your husband snitched?

191
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:33,382
Yes!

192
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,843
So how did the money come in?

193
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,971
5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 notes?
Used or new?

194
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,598
Did he tell you ?
Every time?

195
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,517
When did he tell you?

196
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,519
What was special
about these occasions?

197
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,522
Did you sometimes
count the notes ?

198
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,276
What was special
when you did count the notes?

199
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:02,286
I know people don't like explaining
how their husband was bribed.

200
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,456
Going into protocols
can be sordid...

201
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,960
even if he was paid
to help the police

202
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,503
which means the community.

203
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,630
My husband gave no details.

204
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,924
And he told you to say this.

205
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,801
To protect you.

206
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,804
We can admit that.
Back to the money.

207
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:21,763
I don't think...

208
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:27,352
Farid possibly came home after
meeting his contact, Mr. Mendes?

209
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:31,648
Farid calmly sat down
and then what was the protocol?

210
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,652
This could tell us
when the protocol changed

211
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,613
and the person who changed it.

212
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,114
That's our job!

213
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:40,157
I believe....

214
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,950
Let's take a step back here.

215
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,785
He comes home with the money

216
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:47,080
and you share a moment
of gratifying intimacy.

217
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,753
You show the kid the money
to prove that intelligence pays off,

218
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,547
the intelligence
of being well informed.

219
00:20:55,756 --> 00:21:00,010
Maybe count the money on the table
to teach the kid mental calculation.

220
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,144
The beach at the lake.

221
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,813
You'd like to know who sent Farid

222
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,358
where he met his murderers.

223
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,402
So try to remember, Virginie!

224
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,529
Sally thinks it's important.

225
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,330
Is it you?

226
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:30,916
Yes.

227
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,086
<i>The Lake Beach</i>

228
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,432
We've been waiting for you.
Were you held up?

229
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,519
They are not leaving you alone, right?

230
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,479
Go sit with the others.

231
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,903
Look, this is Rachida Dati.

232
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,032
She changed her hairstyle.

233
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,579
Looks like plastic surgery to me.

234
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:15,335
Her bra sticks out a bit.

235
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,004
Sexy, isn't it?

236
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,880
The little devil!

237
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,177
Communication is essential.

238
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,013
When did you get your first cell?

239
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,390
I was 6, but that was late.

240
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,809
You need a cell at all times

241
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,811
even at a young age.

242
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,188
- When did you get yours?
- At 4 !

243
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,816
Great!
Mother is a Samsung person.

244
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:41,069
Older people here
prefer Korean brands.

245
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:57,461
Beautiful dress. It's a size 36.

246
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,880
You look fabulous.

247
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,724
I wish they all fell into the water.

248
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:11,641
Why?

249
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,478
I could use
my first-aid kit on them.

250
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,313
It contains everything.

251
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,359
I must lose a few pounds first,
I've put on weight.

252
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:26,448
Not easy to look fabulous
if you have my responsibilities.

253
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:31,828
Mother!

254
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,934
You wanted to scare your mum,
Aurélien?

255
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,438
Virginie, I guess you didn't
bring a towel.

256
00:23:58,647 --> 00:23:59,856
Good that I am here.

257
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,067
Why did you choose this beach?

258
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,821
You need to get on with your life.
Move forward.

259
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,198
I did not want to come back here.

260
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:13,870
With my husband, we would stand
at the window after big thunderstorms.

261
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,791
The light is very special
after a big thunderstorm

262
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,545
the sky looks totally different
and you feel different, too.

263
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,588
I always loved that.

264
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,366
Amazing. Overwhelming.
I love you to pieces.

265
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,118
Well done, darling!

266
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,842
Thank you, my love.

267
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,512
Let me speak to Romain.

268
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,724
Romain, it's mum.
How are you?

269
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:02,354
I met a boy today,
a bit younger than you.

270
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:03,980
He looked sad.

271
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,859
I can't tell you why,
investigation secrecy.

272
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,903
So how are you then?

273
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,782
I'm sorry to hear that.

274
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,287
You too?

275
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,792
Back in my days,
we used to say...

276
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,461
there are more fish
in the sea.

277
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:30,340
I know,
it's an idiotic thing to say.

278
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:00,870
Esther!

279
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:04,874
Yes?

280
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,799
As a child, when I left the room,
nobody would notice.

281
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,759
Ok... so what?

282
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:20,890
I'd like the opposite, to enter
a room without anybody noticing.

283
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,892
- Be invisible?
- Yes!

284
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,813
Like Virginie,
the woman nobody notices.

285
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,275
You really threw her off.

286
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,403
How did the money arrive?

287
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:37,282
Were there 5, 10,
50 or 100 euro notes?

288
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,328
If so, every time or just sometimes?
And if sometimes, on what occasion?

289
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:46,207
Did you count the money yourself?
If only sometimes, on what occasion?

290
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,501
I've got work to do, Sally.

291
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:54,674
I've got one final question:
Virginie Benamar she's naive, isn't she?

292
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,217
She's even a bit stupid?

293
00:27:56,426 --> 00:28:00,096
She understood things
but doesn't want to face them.

294
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:01,931
A bit like you.

295
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,934
I'd like to give you
your first assignment, Sally.

296
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,105
- Are you tactful?
- Very much so.

297
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,566
- With Algerians?
- Even more.

298
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,568
So find me Mendes's new snitch!

299
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:33,630
How?

300
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,719
I can't get a grip
on the two women you sent us.

301
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,350
What do you mean by "fairness"?

302
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,353
People always refer
to Esther's fairness.

303
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,146
Her fairness is distinctive.

304
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:51,523
I don't mean her work.

305
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,652
Tell me more intimate
details about her...

306
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,656
things that allow me
to adapt to her.

307
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,909
About her family?

308
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,079
Marital?

309
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,541
Private behaviour incompatible
with police ethics.

310
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:13,712
Incompatible with police ethics?
They're muff divers, aren't they?

311
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,465
I don't get it.
Give me details.

312
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,385
- They like hitting each other!
- What?

313
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,681
Esther needs more.
It's not a sentimental problem...

314
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,016
she needs new surroundings,
a change of set.

315
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,601
Explain!

316
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,857
Does Sally also have problems?

317
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,611
Go ahead, give me details!

318
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,654
She peeps.

319
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,949
What do you mean "she peeps"?

320
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:46,536
She's kind of vicious
with her eyes.

321
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,538
Crap!

322
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,003
Stop freaking out.
Take it easy.

323
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,756
Those two will come up
with all sorts of theories.

324
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:01,009
Girls like that require
any number of possibilities.

325
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,594
Otherwise they feel fenced in.

326
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,941
May I have a moment?

327
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:24,324
I gathered some information
on Esther Lafarge and Sally Marinelli.

328
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:26,451
May I sit down?

329
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:30,914
It appears they're a bit weird.

330
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,335
What are you insinuating, Mendes?

331
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,546
I mean sexually...

332
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,425
one likes to hit,
the other one peeps.

333
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,136
What do you think
the police is doing then?

334
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,692
Mendes, draw graffiti in the toilets
if it makes you feel better.

335
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,267
- You want a beer?
- No!

336
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,477
- A little beer with me?
- I said no!

337
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:36,980
Your eyes are so blue,
I must buy you a drink.

338
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:38,314
I repeat - no!

339
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:41,359
- Ok, don't blow a fuse!
- Go ahead, rant louder!

340
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,738
Give me a break!
Stop that crap, for fuck's sake!

341
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,875
Women should be
respected and protected.

342
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,878
You throw a nice punch.

343
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,505
He might have
kicked your teeth in.

344
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,799
Such a gorgeous smile.

345
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,468
A woman's smile
can change a life.

346
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:11,514
That might be a banality,
but I like it.

347
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,893
Do you have a girlfriend?

348
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,313
Not at the moment.

349
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,232
Is it the first time you come here?

350
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,693
Yes, just passing through.

351
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,446
And you are...?

352
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,161
Look here.

353
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,915
Guess what this is?

354
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,334
A partner?

355
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,212
I never thought of it.

356
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:45,757
Why not indeed?

357
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:52,555
My syringe as a partner...

358
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,315
So?

359
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:11,986
It's true, we can't even
see the stars. Is that normal?

360
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,740
It's called light pollution.
It blocks everything.

361
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,955
What's the sky like in Algiers?

362
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,666
No idea,
I've never been there.

363
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,545
Pity, I'd like someone
to tell me about it.

364
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,090
What are you doing?

365
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:34,759
I don't know...

366
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:39,847
Being with you feels good.
It doesn't happen very often.

367
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,352
You have nobody?

368
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,604
You mean people who count?

369
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,606
Yes, people who count.

370
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,025
Maybe.

371
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,946
There's a guy who protects me.
He's asking me questions.

372
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,531
Your big brother?

373
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,992
I don't have a brother, just a sister.

374
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:06,207
Funny, I'm also with someone
who asks questions. A woman.

375
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,626
Does she protect you?

376
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,504
I don't know yet.

377
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:20,054
By coming here, you tried
to get away from your partner?

378
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,099
Maybe.

379
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:25,977
Maybe what?

380
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:29,188
A bit of fresh air.

381
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:32,233
That's the formula
Mendes is interested in.

382
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,695
I suppose you heard the rumours?
He's snooping around.

383
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,572
I don't care.

384
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:42,702
You want to leave
your partner...

385
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,745
He's called Ahmed, right?

386
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:50,793
Not making one's mind up
happens to anybody.

387
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,212
Maybe.

388
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,095
What kind of clothes
does Ahmed wear?

389
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,681
Quite simple.

390
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,684
Some velvet,
some spring colours.

391
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,104
What about Gérald?

392
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,566
He's a bow-tie guy.

393
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,259
How many of these
traffic lights are there?

394
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:45,264
"Incompatibility with police ethics"
says your file.

395
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:46,682
You want to know, don't you?

396
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:49,769
I could have phoned around,
like Mendes.

397
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,771
I prefer that you
tell me yourself...

398
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:53,940
when you feel like it.

399
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:01,405
The only person in the world
to understand me is my husband.

400
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:05,576
So much so that we hate to separate,
even for a few days.

401
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,248
Is that a good thing or is it bad,
I don't really know.

402
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:16,879
He shakes me
the way I need to be shaken.

403
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:19,090
Shake me all over.

404
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,553
Just like you, Sally, right?

405
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:27,265
What I really need is
to look less gawky.

406
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,645
If I tell you something,
will you return me the favour?

407
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,941
I can give you the name of a person
who's tailing you right now.

408
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,944
What's that shit-stirrer up to?

409
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,197
You must be Nadal?

410
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:45,866
No shady deals,
I'm not interested. Never!

411
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,412
I could be an ally
if you accepted to talk to me.

412
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,665
Your only ally, maybe.
I know about many things.

413
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:56,794
Nadal, you're upset,
you lost your job on television.

414
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,004
I get it.

415
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:02,383
I'm not upset at all. Are you going
after somebody in the precinct?

416
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,678
I know them all,
I've been seeing them for years.

417
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,014
I discovered Benamar's body.

418
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,224
Nadal, you are anguished!

419
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,935
We women know how to deal
with that, right Sally?

420
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:16,063
- Anguish doesn't scare us.
- No, not in the least.

421
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,442
For God's sake, I'm not anguished.
I could help you, shit!

422
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,943
That's enough!

423
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:23,529
Get out of my car!

424
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:27,825
Does working with a demoted
colleague make you act like this?

425
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,459
Don't listen to him.

426
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:38,878
He's...

427
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,340
He's jobless.

428
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,467
No, not jobless, he's a parasite.

429
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:46,677
No, he's not a parasite...

430
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,138
he's a Peeping Tom.

431
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,809
What do you mean by "Peeping Tom"?

432
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:57,396
Farid bringing home the banknotes

433
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,274
had to be a particularity
in your relationship.

434
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:03,319
Sally,
ask her what he looked like:

435
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,321
the way he talked,
his body language.

436
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:07,365
Body language?

437
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,158
It's a figure of speech.

438
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:12,119
They are important
in police work. Right?

439
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:15,706
I've taken an interest in body
language since I was six.

440
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,876
It's a language
Sally hasn't got a grip on yet.

441
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,380
We'll teach her
one step at a time.

442
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:27,718
What was his relationship
with his superiors?

443
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,763
He never talked about
the people he was working with.

444
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,015
He said:
"Do right and let them speak."

445
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:36,894
Another figure of speech.
Maybe the most beautiful of all.

446
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,146
It really says

447
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:43,692
"let them speak if it doesn't screw up
what's being done."

448
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:44,777
Right, Sally?

449
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,655
We're digging.
This is just the beginning!

450
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:51,867
We just want our lives back.

451
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:55,871
Digging it all up again
won't help us.

452
00:40:56,122 --> 00:41:00,167
Help moving things along?
We're not here to move things along!

453
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:04,630
We're here to screw people,
we might as well screw the right ones.

454
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,092
Why do you use
such vulgar language, Madam?

455
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,183
Excuse me, I'll be back in a second.

456
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:49,216
That's my father.

457
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:52,636
He was a policeman
in Algeria before coming to France.

458
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:56,015
In France, he became
a policeman again.

459
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:58,350
Some story.

460
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,144
Not entirely, Aurélien.

461
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:02,813
He taught me how to draw.

462
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:05,024
I also have a son, Aurélien.

463
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,151
He's a bit older than you.
His name is Romain.

464
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:09,778
So what, I don't give a shit.

465
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:25,044
He must have liked your
"beautiful French woman" aspect?

466
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:28,255
You have hazel eyes, a firm body.

467
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,176
Not to mention other advantages.

468
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:35,012
He didn't marry me
to get a French passport.

469
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:38,057
Sally must be touched
by a mixed marriage.

470
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,601
Sally experienced one herself.

471
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:44,146
Wasn't your marriage more
of a romantic story?

472
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:46,690
I don't think Farid
found it romantic.

473
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,652
He believed France to be romantic.

474
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,154
He kept talking
about France's grandeur

475
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:54,323
its famous statesmen
and so on.

476
00:42:54,532 --> 00:42:57,493
- And he betrayed for France.
- No, he didn't!

477
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,038
True believers must ignore
things not of their concern.

478
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:04,208
A Muslim doesn't care about
things which don't concern him.

479
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:07,670
Your husband did not follow
Mohammed's hadith, Virginie.

480
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,256
And I know he was a believer.

481
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:11,715
I don't speak Arabic.

482
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,468
Esther worked in Algeria
and speaks well.

483
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:17,096
Unbelievable the things she can do.

484
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:21,433
Your husband worked on the Belkacem
network. Does that ring a bell?

485
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:22,601
No.

486
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,062
"Belkacem network"?

487
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:39,243
Obviously, the worst is over now.

488
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,915
Pity if it started all over again.

489
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:46,250
What?

490
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,960
The nastiness.

491
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:54,592
In some situations,
you need to know where you stand.

492
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:59,221
You were the wife of a snitch,
now you are his widow.

493
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,098
It's not the same thing.

494
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:03,809
It's more delicate.

495
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:05,352
I do what I can.

496
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:11,859
It can't be easy to live
in fear and shame.

497
00:44:14,945 --> 00:44:16,447
I've still got Aurélien.

498
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:19,408
Don't forget to keep a low profile.

499
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,369
Mum, what do we eat tonight?

500
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,754
What did Farid have to do
with Belkacem?

501
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:34,757
You have a beautiful son.

502
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:37,551
He looks more like
his father every day.

503
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,099
How is school?

504
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,478
I've heard you're a bit violent.

505
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,981
- Your dad wasn't violent.
- I know.

506
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,901
- What do you look for in violence?
- I dunno.

507
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,445
Forget about violence,
it doesn't help.

508
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:29,144
You're not exactly discreet.

509
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:43,992
3 days ago, a 35 year old blonde
with blue eyes had a drink here.

510
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:48,914
Lanky and underfed, with lots
of freckles. Ring a bell?

511
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:52,000
I don't know who you mean.

512
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:55,838
What about this then?

513
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:59,091
- What do you want of her?
- And you?

514
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,176
I fancy her.

515
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,137
She's a cop.

516
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,182
- Is that any of your business?
- Yes, it is!

517
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,229
She's here for Benamar.

518
00:46:13,564 --> 00:46:17,025
- Are you scared of her?
- I need to protect us, that's all.

519
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,157
I'll buy you a drink.

520
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:37,546
<i>The Lake Beach</i>

521
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:54,980
What are you doing here?

522
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:04,239
The women can ask what they want,
but they won't understand.

523
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:09,244
My wife understood everything
from inside.

524
00:47:11,288 --> 00:47:13,332
But she cost me a lot of money.

525
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:16,168
And she still costs a lot.

526
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:24,426
What is it that Lafarge
and Marinelli don't understand?

527
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:28,138
All of this.

528
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:33,143
People who are asleep
and who don't have a clue.

529
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:38,148
Or people who can help you
all of a sudden... like Farid.

530
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:44,363
What Farid really liked
was talking to Mendes.

531
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:50,369
I wonder if Mendes is really up to it.

532
00:47:51,537 --> 00:47:53,288
He's unmanageable.

533
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,252
He'll do something
stupid with these two women.

534
00:47:58,502 --> 00:48:00,587
Don't worry, I have a hold on him.

535
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:07,803
Did we screw it up with Farid?

536
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,056
I don't believe we did.

537
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:14,726
But I keep thinking about one thing...

538
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,772
that Benamar wouldn't last long.

539
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:23,193
You can sense it,
if someone will last or not.

540
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:29,116
I also sense it about Mendes

541
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:31,743
that he's not going to last.

542
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:33,662
I hope I'm wrong.

543
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:35,914
I sensed it about my wife, too.

544
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:57,686
There are 3 categories of men
Allah will ignore on Resurrection Day:

545
00:48:58,312 --> 00:49:01,899
an adulterous old man,
a ruler lying to his people

546
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:04,026
and a poor man filled with pride.

547
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:05,527
Why are you so ugly?

548
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:07,487
Caroline!

549
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:14,870
I have my daughter this week.

550
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:18,749
Entertaining her isn't easy,
she's done it all with her mother.

551
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,376
Thanks for the info on Sally.

552
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:24,630
"Private behaviour incompatible
with police ethics."

553
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:28,508
What the hell
were you doing in their car?

554
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,011
You got scared, didn't you?
I'm not surprised.

555
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,306
I watch you lurk around
at dawn from my balcony.

556
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:36,433
What are you looking for?

557
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:38,393
So now you spy on me.

558
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:41,730
You're a shit-stirrer
and a Peeping Tom.

559
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:44,733
Just like me, no?
Struggling to get out?

560
00:49:44,942 --> 00:49:48,362
Why read that?
Everybody knows you're lost.

561
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,571
No!

562
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,781
What, no?

563
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:51,907
I'm working.

564
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:55,243
We could write a great book
on the Benamar case.

565
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:57,871
We'd call it
"Until Death do us part,

566
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,582
Are we serious in our police work?"

567
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,542
You little shit!

568
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:05,087
I need a scoop.

569
00:50:12,386 --> 00:50:13,470
What's that photo about?

570
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,764
You've never seen
someone like that.

571
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:17,975
I don't know. Who is it?

572
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:19,476
The most beautiful woman.

573
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,565
So the big day has come, Sally?

574
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:28,860
You're right,
this sweater calls for nail varnish.

575
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:49,756
Rozynski, were you
Benamar's pilot all the time?

576
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:53,218
Yes, Mendes proposed
to hire Farid Benamar

577
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:55,178
who turned informant.

578
00:50:56,013 --> 00:51:00,142
Mendes was his contact
and he reported directly to me.

579
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:04,104
Benamar was an Algerian policeman
who had fled his country.

580
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,606
We saw him hanging around.

581
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,067
Hanging around the precinct, was he?

582
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:12,654
Many Algerian policemen turned
informant in France this way.

583
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,740
This way? Really?

584
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:16,074
Absolutely.

585
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:20,662
Another protocol?

586
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:22,497
Maybe...

587
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:27,169
he was missing his work.
Some people have a calling.

588
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:32,883
So Farid hung around the precinct
every night...

589
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:35,385
- Like a...
- No, not like a whore!

590
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:38,138
Couldn't he apply
for political asylum?

591
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:42,851
Islamist persecution doesn't qualify
for asylum, you know that.

592
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:44,436
So he couldn't.

593
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,104
How did you turn him?

594
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,357
Once you're terrorised,
you stay terrorised.

595
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,985
The things he witnessed
over there left him spooked.

596
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:57,699
Sally supposes your trio
operated according to the law.

597
00:51:58,158 --> 00:51:58,825
Absolutely.

598
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:01,369
If the police works in the shadow

599
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:05,499
you must shed light
on them, right Sally?

600
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:10,295
Yet, because of required secrecy
and a certain reciprocity

601
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:14,091
snitches always need
shadow zones, right Sally?

602
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:17,761
- Reciprocity?
- Yes, reciprocity!

603
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:21,098
Sally is better
at explaining these terms.

604
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:22,349
Please Sally.

605
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:26,394
A certain amount of give and take
between informants and policemen.

606
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:34,111
A cop tolerating
misdemeanors as counterpart

607
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,863
one could call it shadow zone, no?

608
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:41,493
It would be highly questionable
as such actions were not approved.

609
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:45,664
Are you trying to make us believe
that Farid was beyond reproach?

610
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:53,380
Shady activities by Benamar
were mentioned. Drug trafficking.

611
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,757
- Protected activities?
- Yes!

612
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:58,260
Sally worries about informants
getting too powerful.

613
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:00,137
Powerful... in what sense?

614
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:02,222
Some just turn greedy.

615
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:11,731
Mysterious turn of events, right?

616
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:14,776
When does the suit no longer fit?

617
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:17,195
Why not yesterday
or even tomorrow?

618
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:20,991
Sally keeps wondering,
but she'll never put on weight.

619
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:28,123
Were there important drug dealers
Farid could or would not inform on?

620
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:30,250
Like Belkacem.

621
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,544
Belkacem's case is special.

622
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:36,047
Does your department
protect drug dealers?

623
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:38,842
Corruption?

624
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:46,057
Answer me!

625
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,143
You won't dig up a thing.

626
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:50,103
We'll see about that.

627
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,523
Did you follow
protocol on Farid?

628
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:11,166
I love talk or silence.

629
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:40,528
I've done nothing wrong to this day,

630
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,614
sincerely.

631
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:46,076
I followed protection protocols
by the book.

632
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:56,878
Rachida Belkacem,
you're up!

633
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,634
As your new President, I thank you.

634
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:07,430
Thank you for coming to celebrate
our association's 10th anniversary.

635
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:11,601
Our former President
was Farid Benamar.

636
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,187
I'm sure you haven't
forgotten his story.

637
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:21,152
In 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front
was winning the elections.

638
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:25,490
The military seized power
between the two election rounds.

639
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:29,119
The Islamists had been
robbed of their victory, yes...

640
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,871
so what were they left with?

641
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:35,709
Civil servants to be shot,
policemen to be executed?

642
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:37,669
Ironic turn of history.

643
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,799
Thousands of Algerian policemen,
Farid among them,

644
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:47,178
took the brave decision
to seek sanctuary in France

645
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:49,931
and to start
their lives from scratch.

646
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:52,559
I would like to honour his memory

647
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:55,437
acknowledge his wife, Virginie.

648
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:07,907
I'd like to add a few simple words.

649
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:12,329
I want to honour the memory
of Farid Benamar

650
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:17,334
And I feel like saying let's drink
and eat to his health.

651
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:19,878
You should know that Farid...

652
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,838
We've all read the papers

653
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:24,883
a snitch, a drug dealer,
what does all that mean?

654
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,218
Honest people should lead us.

655
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:29,471
Here we talk of fairness,

656
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,890
of integrity,

657
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:34,768
of totality, of impartiality,

658
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,104
we talk of national feelings

659
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,525
feelings on justice
of recognising everyone's rights

660
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:45,695
and not about enforcing
existing territorial laws.

661
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:49,157
This couldn't be further
from our thoughts.

662
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,453
Yes Sir, you're offending!

663
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:03,671
I realised that,
by losing such a close friend

664
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:08,760
I lost someone
who was very important to me.

665
00:57:21,398 --> 00:57:24,484
Benamar was open,
Belkacem is authoritarian.

666
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:25,944
She's very opinionated.

667
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:29,280
- There are cops among us.
- What do they want?

668
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:32,283
They must be here
for Benamar's widow.

669
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,868
She lives on what?

670
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:36,871
She should get to work
rather than doll up.

671
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:40,500
Her son turned violent at school,
my girl told me.

672
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:44,212
My God, why do you talk like this?

673
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:46,881
Virginie is a nice lady,

674
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:49,843
she has a big <i>dog.</i>

675
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:52,637
<i>Qalb</i> not <i>kelb</i>,
she has a big <i>heart</i>!

676
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:57,976
<i>Kelb</i> means dog,
<i>qalb</i> means heart.

677
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:12,407
- He speaks awful Arabic.
- He's still taking lessons.

678
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,244
Where did Rachida Dati's
elegance come from?

679
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,163
Who on earth is she?

680
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:20,790
Her elegance
comes from her mother.

681
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:23,585
But she doesn't want it known.

682
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:26,504
- Why?
- Because she's much prettier than her.

683
00:58:26,713 --> 00:58:28,214
She's a real woman!

684
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:33,386
Rachida Dati is as old as you are.

685
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:35,763
Me old? Speak for yourself!

686
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:39,142
Don't say the contrary
of what you think or shut up.

687
00:58:40,477 --> 00:58:42,228
I'm a very classy guy!

688
00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:44,022
I only buy luxury stuff.

689
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,734
I know the greatest <i liars
in Paris, Rome.</i>

690
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,153
Not <i>liars</i> but <i>fashion designers!</i>

691
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:54,032
I know how to dress,
I am very "chicos"!

692
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,118
"Chicos"?
Chikkour (a pimp), yes!

693
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,787
There's no <i>pussy</i> in that!

694
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,253
Go clean your <i>pussy!</i>

695
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:13,051
Hello Virginie.

696
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:14,427
Hello Mr. Rozynski.

697
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,097
You could have come
to my husband's funeral.

698
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:19,516
Yes...

699
00:59:20,016 --> 00:59:21,768
You had another engagement?

700
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,811
No, that wasn't it.

701
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:28,399
I suppose your presence
wasn't part of the protocol?

702
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:30,193
Yes.

703
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:17,156
Rozynski worries me.
He looks fragile.

704
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:22,078
He'll keel over.
I hope in the right direction.

705
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:27,625
I think he's going to give us
some juicy stuff.

706
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:29,085
Gérald!

707
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:32,380
Hurry, I miss you.

708
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:42,223
We haven't seen each other
in ten days.

709
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,934
It felt more like ten years.

710
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:50,648
Did staying at your brother's
upset Romain?

711
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:53,610
I don't want to leave him
alone these days.

712
01:00:54,736 --> 01:00:57,405
He needs to find
a new girlfriend soon.

713
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:01,909
Our son has his heart
in the right place.

714
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:05,622
Did you get
your strength back, darling?

715
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:09,167
I do want a lot of pleasure.

716
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:04,532
Not my balls!

717
01:03:11,456 --> 01:03:12,665
Stop it!

718
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:24,135
Mrs. Lafarge!

719
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:57,418
<i>800 wounded and 5 casualties
in Algeria since the riots started,</i>

720
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,796
<i>according to</i> Le Monde.

721
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:02,965
<i>Violence has rocked Algeria all year.</i>

722
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:07,261
<i>I spent my holidays in Algeria,
prices are sky high,</i>

723
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,599
<i>life in Algeria is almost
as expensive as it is in France</i>

724
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:15,853
<i>while salaries are 13 times
lower than in France...</i>

725
01:04:16,813 --> 01:04:20,066
<i>Young people are rioting
just like in France.</i>

726
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:23,486
<i>They're unhappy
with their government and vice-versa.</i>

727
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:28,444
Chief?

728
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,281
Careful with that dew!

729
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,534
Chief!

730
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,497
A knoll is beautiful at dawn, isn't it?

731
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,062
Pardon me, I have to do this.

732
01:07:06,691 --> 01:07:09,068
You were always
my mentor, Rozynski

733
01:07:09,694 --> 01:07:12,196
with your knowledge
about informants,

734
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:17,451
about their usefulness,

735
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,413
the rules of the game

736
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:25,501
and its twilight zones
as you kept saying.

737
01:07:34,135 --> 01:07:36,345
I need to read to you
one last time.

738
01:07:38,431 --> 01:07:40,224
Look at these faggots!

739
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:54,780
Sally, it's Nadal.
You'd better get in touch with me.

740
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:05,166
I'm out of here!

741
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:26,228
You must be Sally.

742
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:28,731
Esther warned me

743
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:32,068
that you keep appearing
out of the blue

744
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:35,154
like a big snooping badger
that lost its way.

745
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:41,869
You must be itching
to try this, right?

746
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,584
You want to patch me up?

747
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:50,002
Yes.

748
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:53,631
Is Esther hurt too?

749
01:08:55,716 --> 01:08:57,134
You should ask her.

750
01:08:57,927 --> 01:09:00,596
I leave you to it,
I have a train to catch.

751
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:12,108
Your leg!

752
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:16,987
We have to do something.
His leg must be looked after.

753
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:19,949
I can do it.

754
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:23,035
I've got mercurochrome.

755
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:34,588
Let's go!

756
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:42,096
- Died where?
- On the knoll!

757
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,891
Same place as Farid Benamar.
Spot on!

758
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:50,104
Doesn't it hurt too much?

759
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:53,774
My husband is no boxer,
he plays the violin.

760
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:57,528
The entire precinct will be there

761
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:01,073
seeing you like this,
can't be good for our investigation.

762
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,827
They have bigger fish to fry.

763
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:07,288
Their main problem is Rozynski.

764
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:09,582
Let's hurry, Sally!

765
01:10:15,296 --> 01:10:18,048
Crap, they must have
gone over everything!

766
01:10:18,883 --> 01:10:21,969
Now leave me alone, Sally,
I need to think.

767
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:36,377
I dreamt of Gérald.
It was pleasant but too short.

768
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,129
Let's go!

769
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:07,491
- Suicide?
- Yes!

770
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:10,619
- Who found the body?
- A lady walking her dog.

771
01:12:11,287 --> 01:12:12,579
Thanks.

772
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:16,083
If I find out this is your fault!

773
01:12:22,673 --> 01:12:25,801
Commissioner Lafarge,
you are out of your mind.

774
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:46,363
Don't stare at me like that, Mendes,
I'll recover.

775
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:49,825
You, maybe, but he won't!

776
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:56,290
What did you do to Rozynski?

777
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:08,302
Move over dear,
you're embarrassing me.

778
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:21,357
Isn't it nice to meet
among women?

779
01:13:23,776 --> 01:13:25,361
Come help me.

780
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:51,220
I've been looking for you.

781
01:13:53,389 --> 01:13:55,516
Did you love your husband,
Mrs. Belkacem?

782
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:59,520
Of course I did. A marriage of love,
just like yours, Virginie.

783
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,315
Farid was working your case
before he died.

784
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:05,859
The two police-women told me.

785
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:10,406
Farid was not working,
I'd say he was snitching.

786
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:13,700
I, for one, am working
but I'm not snitching.

787
01:14:15,744 --> 01:14:18,205
Were you involved
in his death, Rachida?

788
01:14:18,831 --> 01:14:20,416
Shame on you!

789
01:14:35,848 --> 01:14:36,849
Excuse me?

790
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:45,941
You have no idea
who you're dealing with, Virginie.

791
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:48,735
Poor Aurélien.

792
01:14:51,572 --> 01:14:53,157
Fasten your seatbelt.

793
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:56,952
Indicator!

794
01:15:00,706 --> 01:15:01,957
Slow down!

795
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:05,669
I'll check on the wheel.

796
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:07,588
God bless you!

797
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:18,182
300...

798
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:21,059
Hey... Mohammed!

799
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,187
Where are you?

800
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:01,183
Chirac...

801
01:16:07,064 --> 01:16:08,607
Napoleon...

802
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:14,571
Charles de Gaulle...

803
01:16:19,243 --> 01:16:20,077
Joan of Arc...

804
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:24,164
Rozynski committed suicide.
It's confirmed.

805
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:27,251
Yes, I'm longing to see you again.

806
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:29,962
Thanks, it's nice of you
to tell me that.

807
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:33,257
Your surprise worked perfectly.
Very violent indeed.

808
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:36,635
Don't pass me Romain,
I'm not up to it today.

809
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:46,228
- Still not sleeping?
- No!

810
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:48,230
- Rozynski?
- Yes!

811
01:16:48,897 --> 01:16:51,984
I've had enough of these
grand immolations on that knoll.

812
01:16:53,402 --> 01:16:56,989
Your wounds have healed a bit.
Apart from the cut on the nose.

813
01:16:57,614 --> 01:17:00,576
I'll buy a mason's hammer in case
my husband returns.

814
01:17:00,784 --> 01:17:03,537
Short handle,
fits into the night-table.

815
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:04,621
Why a mason?

816
01:17:05,706 --> 01:17:07,207
Way more violent!

817
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,964
Esther, I wanted to tell you something.

818
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:15,465
I'm listening, Sally.

819
01:17:17,092 --> 01:17:20,846
About my "private behaviour
incompatible with police ethics"

820
01:17:24,016 --> 01:17:26,602
I like to quietly watch people.

821
01:17:27,436 --> 01:17:28,979
People doing what?

822
01:17:34,318 --> 01:17:37,446
Your demotion
to Internal Affairs is unfair.

823
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:41,533
- Watching doesn't hurt anybody.
- I'm a compulsive peeper.

824
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:44,369
I can't help it,
it's stronger than me.

825
01:17:44,995 --> 01:17:46,455
It's bad, isn't it?

826
01:17:46,788 --> 01:17:49,124
I'll get you out
of that closet, you'll see.

827
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:50,584
I repeat my question:

828
01:17:51,627 --> 01:17:53,378
You watch people making what?

829
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:56,673
Love.

830
01:18:46,181 --> 01:18:48,392
Describe the man
with the envelope.

831
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,895
I told you I couldn't see very well.
It was too dark.

832
01:18:52,104 --> 01:18:53,689
I didn't know him.

833
01:18:54,648 --> 01:18:56,900
Describe him again.
Every detail.

834
01:18:57,109 --> 01:18:59,903
I need to run.
Belkacem is expecting me.

835
01:19:00,112 --> 01:19:02,864
There's a delivery at the hangar
in three hours.

836
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:24,553
Mendes,
as Rozynski is no longer around

837
01:19:24,761 --> 01:19:27,639
we need to find a new pilot
for your new informant.

838
01:19:28,265 --> 01:19:31,601
A snitch needs a pilot,
you know that!

839
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:35,397
There's no time to look,
so I'll take care of it myself.

840
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:38,817
I want to be
your new informant's pilot.

841
01:19:39,151 --> 01:19:41,862
Set up a meeting, Mendes!
And fast!

842
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:01,840
What are you doing here?
Where is your master?

843
01:20:02,716 --> 01:20:05,677
Where are the others?
Where is Younès?

844
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:11,600
Why is there nobody?

845
01:20:11,808 --> 01:20:14,186
Where's Bontemps?
What's this mess?

846
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:20,442
It's me!

847
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:23,779
Your brother?

848
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:25,572
No idea where he is.

849
01:20:25,781 --> 01:20:27,824
He doesn't pick up his phone.

850
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:42,172
Younès, it's me again, Robert.

851
01:20:42,798 --> 01:20:46,551
It all went wrong at the hangar.
We can't reach you.

852
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,845
We don't know where you are.

853
01:20:49,054 --> 01:20:51,515
Get in touch!
I'm at your sister's.

854
01:20:51,723 --> 01:20:54,434
You don't pick up.
There's no trace of you.

855
01:20:55,435 --> 01:20:57,103
Call me back.

856
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:13,036
It is complicated to find out

857
01:21:13,245 --> 01:21:15,664
if treason came from inside.

858
01:21:15,914 --> 01:21:17,290
Impossible, from inside.

859
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:19,251
- Anything is possible!
- No.

860
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:21,086
Ask Sally about it.

861
01:21:33,682 --> 01:21:36,685
The attorney-general
called me in tomorrow.

862
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:51,533
Good evening, Younès.
I'm Commissioner Bontemps.

863
01:21:52,242 --> 01:21:54,202
Mendes told me a lot about you.

864
01:21:56,496 --> 01:21:58,164
Why isn't Mendes here?

865
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:02,043
He should have told me it was you.
It's the first time that...

866
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,672
I must see Mendes,
I need his advice.

867
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:07,382
Advice?

868
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:09,217
Are you panicking?

869
01:22:09,426 --> 01:22:10,635
Yes!

870
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:14,097
It's called a vocation.

871
01:22:15,432 --> 01:22:18,226
Farid Benamar
felt exactly the same thing.

872
01:22:18,727 --> 01:22:22,397
I don't know what's going on.
Belkacem took away my cellphone.

873
01:22:26,693 --> 01:22:31,281
Tell me, Younès,
your work with Rachida Belkacem,

874
01:22:32,991 --> 01:22:34,284
tell me

875
01:22:35,535 --> 01:22:36,620
all about it.

876
01:22:36,828 --> 01:22:38,914
Here, in the car, straight away?

877
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:42,167
- No, we'll do it elsewhere.
- Where elsewhere?

878
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:44,628
At the lake beach.

879
01:23:02,312 --> 01:23:04,564
<i>The Lake Beach</i>

880
01:23:12,322 --> 01:23:14,199
<i>Investigation or carnival?</i>

881
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:17,202
<i>I.A. finds it difficult to clear up</i>

882
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:20,038
<i>the sad case
of Farid Benamar's murder.</i>

883
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:22,874
<i>Lafarge's excessive private life</i>

884
01:23:23,124 --> 01:23:25,669
<i>raises serious doubts
about her reliability.</i>

885
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:30,298
<i>The manager of the hotel
where she's staying has filed charges</i>

886
01:23:30,715 --> 01:23:33,218
<i>for night-time disturbance</i>

887
01:23:33,426 --> 01:23:35,470
<i>as well as sex disturbance.</i>

888
01:23:35,887 --> 01:23:37,514
Does this ring a bell?

889
01:23:37,722 --> 01:23:40,100
This is a <i>Punch and Judy show!</i>

890
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:43,895
<i>Internal Affairs in France
is sinking lower by the day.</i>

891
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:48,358
<i>The country of Human Rights
is no longer a country of police duty.</i>

892
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:50,902
<i>Nadal is back on Channel 3!</i>

893
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:57,492
I'm not sure
I'm gonna get you out of that closet!

894
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:23,935
Do you know Commissioner Bontemps?

895
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:27,063
- Who are you?
- The law!

896
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:30,275
Arabic won't help
with our community.

897
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:32,944
To each his own.

898
01:24:33,194 --> 01:24:35,280
No idea who you mean.

899
01:24:35,488 --> 01:24:38,575
I lost my job
and you're about to lose yours.

900
01:24:56,968 --> 01:24:59,804
Leave us alone,
I must talk to Aurélien.

901
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:05,101
Aurélien, I knew your father well.

902
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:08,813
You are surprised?

903
01:25:09,272 --> 01:25:11,191
Why do you stare at me like that?

904
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:15,904
Mrs. Belkacem came by earlier on.

905
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:18,031
- She asked to see me?
- No.

906
01:25:18,615 --> 01:25:19,824
She came for me.

907
01:25:20,784 --> 01:25:24,954
She talked about her husband,
about being faithful to the dead.

908
01:25:26,331 --> 01:25:29,501
When Dad was still around,
I was less scared.

909
01:26:43,283 --> 01:26:44,367
Come in, Sally.

910
01:26:46,953 --> 01:26:49,164
What were you doing
in your room?

911
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:53,585
I thought you just liked to watch.

912
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:56,254
I'm changing and I think it shows.

913
01:26:57,088 --> 01:26:58,882
It's our last night in this place.

914
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:03,052
You go about it all wrong.
This is how you do it. Watch!

915
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:18,860
If he removes his jocks,
I'll have him locked up.

916
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:24,574
I wonder if that guy
is not unemployed.

917
01:27:49,724 --> 01:27:51,935
You really don't get it, do you?

918
01:27:52,852 --> 01:27:56,648
While I was showing off,
I got what I wanted... quietly.

919
01:27:57,023 --> 01:28:00,401
Just like you.
Why did you not come to the hangar?

920
01:28:00,777 --> 01:28:04,364
I wasn't at the hangar.
You're no longer on the case.

921
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:11,871
Your wife died two years ago.

922
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:16,709
Cancer.

923
01:28:19,128 --> 01:28:21,631
I'll put her photo up
with Farid's in my office.

924
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:23,466
They'll make a nice couple.

925
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:29,055
You adored your wife?

926
01:28:31,432 --> 01:28:34,936
Here husbands and wives
seem to love each other a lot.

927
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:38,856
Virginie loved her husband a lot,
I love mine a lot.

928
01:28:39,065 --> 01:28:40,817
Sally loves hers a lot.

929
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:44,612
Belkacem loved hers a lot,
you loved your wife a lot.

930
01:28:45,613 --> 01:28:47,031
It all fits.

931
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:50,326
But Gérald is alive.

932
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:55,081
Isn't it great to have
a husband who's alive?

933
01:28:56,708 --> 01:28:58,751
You want the photo? Take it!

934
01:28:59,502 --> 01:29:02,422
A wife, alive or dead,
is more important than a photo.

935
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:07,176
I asked myself...

936
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:11,681
why you would
possibly need money?

937
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:13,933
So I asked around.

938
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:20,023
Your wife was a gambler.

939
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:24,152
She was a compulsive gambler
as Sally would put it.

940
01:29:25,862 --> 01:29:27,905
Why did she gamble that much?

941
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:32,535
She certainly accumulated
a huge debt.

942
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:35,455
And you are not even upset.

943
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,999
Solidarity to the bitter end.

944
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:42,170
Just like Virginie,
just like me and my husband.

945
01:29:43,755 --> 01:29:45,840
- I love it.
- I love it too.

946
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:52,638
You're lucky,
I've got nothing on you.

947
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:55,016
I guess I'm lucky then.

948
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:56,517
You know Belkacem?

949
01:29:57,101 --> 01:29:58,144
No.

950
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:09,530
- Want a beer or a tea?
- There's no time.

951
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:12,325
Let's

952
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:14,994
It's about time.

953
01:30:18,873 --> 01:30:19,999
Is that all?

954
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,002
Farid Benamar's
Algerian police I.D.?

955
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:24,796
I think it's a lot.

956
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:28,341
Who saw me on that knoll?

957
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,177
Nadal.

958
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:35,139
- I didn't think you would tell me.
- I trust you.

959
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,729
There aren't too many women
in Villeneuve.

960
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,357
What are you on about, Mendes?

961
01:30:45,024 --> 01:30:47,026
- You know what I'm thinking?
- No.

962
01:30:49,946 --> 01:30:52,365
We could go to Paris together, no?

963
01:30:54,742 --> 01:30:58,413
I dream of Paris.
Just waited for the right person.

964
01:30:58,663 --> 01:31:00,581
I hear Paris is a beautiful city.

965
01:31:01,207 --> 01:31:03,042
Lots of sights.

966
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,672
- You do love Paris, don't you?
- Yes.

967
01:31:14,137 --> 01:31:16,973
- Before you, I was afraid.
- Of what?

968
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:20,184
Of drowning in decadence.

969
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:27,191
You look like Younès's dog.

970
01:31:31,028 --> 01:31:32,321
Slow down!

971
01:31:34,949 --> 01:31:38,161
I have an idea, Mendes.
Belkacem will freak out.

972
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:39,996
I'm listening.

973
01:31:41,289 --> 01:31:43,916
Imagine rather than Farid's police i.d.

974
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:46,669
there was a letter
in Rozynski's pocket.

975
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:49,088
- A letter telling it all.
- Oh yes!

976
01:32:08,274 --> 01:32:09,775
Go to your mother!

977
01:32:10,485 --> 01:32:12,028
This is for the TV report!

978
01:32:12,236 --> 01:32:15,072
Audiences loved it.
Internal Affairs screwing up,

979
01:32:15,281 --> 01:32:17,074
it turns them on like hell!

980
01:32:17,366 --> 01:32:19,869
- You owe me something, no?
- I know.

981
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:22,079
You go see Rachida Belkacem...

982
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:24,624
and tell her exactly
what you saw on that knoll

983
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:26,709
between me and Rozynski, right!

984
01:32:26,959 --> 01:32:28,920
Tell her I thought
you turned queer?

985
01:32:29,128 --> 01:32:33,966
Tell her you saw me remove
a piece of paper on Rozynski's corpse!

986
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:35,426
A letter telling it all!

987
01:32:41,057 --> 01:32:42,934
Are you there, Mohammed?

988
01:32:47,688 --> 01:32:48,814
Oh, it's you?

989
01:33:55,756 --> 01:33:57,633
Is booth number 2 free?

990
01:33:57,842 --> 01:33:59,135
Yes, go ahead.

991
01:34:08,394 --> 01:34:09,854
Hello... Algeria?

992
01:34:10,187 --> 01:34:12,982
Excuse me, brother,
the phone doesn't work!

993
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:17,612
Can you help me?

994
01:34:21,741 --> 01:34:24,368
I am trying to get a hold of
my family in Algeria.

995
01:34:24,619 --> 01:34:27,830
I haven't heard from them
since the riots broke out.

996
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,750
The police hit them,
then they arrested them.

997
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,544
They took them to the jail.

998
01:34:34,754 --> 01:34:36,797
Help me please!

999
01:34:37,006 --> 01:34:39,425
I must speak to my family.

1000
01:34:39,634 --> 01:34:40,885
Help me please!

1001
01:34:59,862 --> 01:35:01,322
May God bless you!

1002
01:35:09,288 --> 01:35:10,289
Hello, Algeria?

1003
01:35:13,084 --> 01:35:15,628
We're starting our tour
of Villeneuve, welcome!

1004
01:35:15,878 --> 01:35:18,839
So when was the urban area
of Villeneuve developed?

1005
01:35:19,048 --> 01:35:21,884
The pavilions were built in 1975,

1006
01:35:22,093 --> 01:35:24,720
that's when the development
started to expand.

1007
01:35:25,012 --> 01:35:27,223
To put all this in context...

1008
01:35:27,431 --> 01:35:30,768
No idea they had
tour buses in the suburbs.

1009
01:35:32,395 --> 01:35:34,021
You're as beautiful as ever.

1010
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:37,149
I'm here to help you,
not to listen to compliments.

1011
01:35:38,651 --> 01:35:41,946
On your right,
you see a harmless little street

1012
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:45,783
were it not for a building
where a well known local lady

1013
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,285
was found assassinated
three days ago.

1014
01:35:49,245 --> 01:35:52,415
Many flats built
on limited building ground...

1015
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:53,874
Sally,

1016
01:35:55,126 --> 01:35:58,003
we have been reinstated.
We go on investigating.

1017
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:02,216
Yes, the case is getting too big.

1018
01:36:02,425 --> 01:36:04,927
Whoever killed Belkacem
did us a favour.

1019
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,180
I know you're thinking of Virginie.

1020
01:36:08,389 --> 01:36:10,307
Two benches, tiny garden

1021
01:36:10,808 --> 01:36:13,060
to preserve
the integrity of the knoll.

1022
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:19,400
The revolutionary idea was leaving
nature as intact as possible.

1023
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:23,821
Did we really understand Virginie?
I mean her love for Farid?

1024
01:36:24,905 --> 01:36:26,657
We didn't see it coming.

1025
01:36:26,866 --> 01:36:28,576
I missed the essential.

1026
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:34,123
...close to nature. The apartments
have balconies facing the knoll...

1027
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:35,583
Yes, yes, Esther!

1028
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:40,087
Despite this revolutionary
natural aspect, I insist,

1029
01:36:40,296 --> 01:36:43,299
two gruesome discoveries
on the knoll.

1030
01:36:43,507 --> 01:36:48,053
Two men were found assassinated
in the same spot on top of it.

1031
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:51,056
The people responsible
for Benamar's death.

1032
01:36:52,975 --> 01:36:55,060
We'll put them away, us two.

1033
01:36:56,103 --> 01:36:56,771
I need you.

1034
01:36:57,104 --> 01:36:58,856
...urban furniture
thrown on the slope...

1035
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:00,024
Thank you, Esther.

1036
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:04,320
Sandbox on the slope,
swing on the slope.

1037
01:37:04,528 --> 01:37:06,530
I insist on the word slope.

1038
01:37:20,294 --> 01:37:22,838
Where there is water,
there are animals.

1039
01:37:23,047 --> 01:37:25,966
If we listen and observe carefully,

1040
01:37:26,175 --> 01:37:28,219
we will spot on the lake beach

1041
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:29,762
a wide variety of geese:

1042
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:32,139
Alopochen Aegyptiaca,
Branta Canadensis

1043
01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:36,811
Anas Platyrhyncos, Anas Penelope,
also swans and common moorhens.

1044
01:37:38,062 --> 01:37:40,147
How did these birds
get to Villeneuve?

1045
01:37:40,815 --> 01:37:41,982
Simple answer.

1046
01:37:42,191 --> 01:37:44,026
As birds tend to fly

1047
01:37:44,235 --> 01:37:49,198
they immediately spot lakes
as the sky reflects in them.

1048
01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:51,659
Just like here
at the lake beach.

1049
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:01,502
Hello, Esther, this is
Robert Mendes speaking.

1050
01:38:02,336 --> 01:38:04,755
I'm calling to leave a message.

1051
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:11,846
I realise we didn't
always see eye to eye

1052
01:38:12,054 --> 01:38:15,057
our collaboration
hasn't always been... Abdullah!

1053
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:21,355
What I'm saying is we really
need you here. Please call me back.

1054
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:29,738
<i>Widen</i> your <i>cheeks.</i>

1055
01:38:30,614 --> 01:38:33,075
You should say:
<i>Wipe off</i> your <i>tears!</i>

1056
01:38:35,452 --> 01:38:37,079
Don't be <i>pretty!</i>

1057
01:38:37,663 --> 01:38:40,374
Not <i>pretty</i>, you mean <i>sad!</i>

1058
01:38:47,339 --> 01:38:49,341
I wonder where he could be?

1059
01:38:50,384 --> 01:38:53,929
It's only been four days,
not four weeks since he left.

1060
01:38:56,348 --> 01:39:01,186
There's not much we can do,
apart from eating balanced meals

1061
01:39:01,395 --> 01:39:05,858
sleep as much as possible and wait.
There's nothing else to do.

1062
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:12,531
He's no idiot,
he's got a fifth sense.

1063
01:39:12,823 --> 01:39:14,575
That's why we worked together.

1064
01:39:18,329 --> 01:39:20,581
<i>Thanks to the determination
of Esther Lafarge</i>

1065
01:39:20,831 --> 01:39:24,919
<i>this investigation will finally
pick up again. And speed up, too.</i>

1066
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:27,963
<i>According to unofficial
and exclusive sources</i>

1067
01:39:28,172 --> 01:39:31,926
<i>we believe that Esther Lafarge
is following a solid lead.</i>

1068
01:39:32,384 --> 01:39:34,261
<i>Will we ever know who's...</i>

1069
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:38,057
<i>responsible for Benamar's death,
5 months later?</i>

1070
01:39:38,265 --> 01:39:39,767
<i>Villeneuve is agog!</i>

1071
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:44,313
<i>It should be noted that the murder
of Rachida Belkacem 3 days ago</i>

1072
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:46,148
<i>revived the investigation.</i>

1073
01:40:39,618 --> 01:40:41,912
Open that door right now,
for God's sake!

1074
01:40:42,413 --> 01:40:45,082
Is that bloody violinist
with you, Sally?

1075
01:40:47,501 --> 01:40:48,669
Gérald!

1076
01:40:49,086 --> 01:40:50,129
My love!

1077
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:51,588
Gérald...

1078
