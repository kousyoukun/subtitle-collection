00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:08,368
――秋叔  翻译――

2
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:13,368
完美无缺

3
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:15,368
我们把这东西拿出去
Let's take this outside.

4
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:19,330
你喜欢问问题是吧 那我就问你几个问题
You like asking questions, so I'll ask you a few.

5
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:20,957
叛徒！
Traitor!

6
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,968
这里看上去像是阿拉伯基佬酒吧
This looks like an Arab faggot bar.

7
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:33,887
全都是老头
Nothing but old people here.

8
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:38,099
我猜你国的年轻人更喜欢操游客
I guess young people in your countries prefer to screw tourists.

9
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:42,437
所以老头只能互相操
That's why you old codgers have to screw each other.

10
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,608
我不喜欢外国佬
I don't like wogs...

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,280
外国基佬比大屠杀更可怕！
but queer wogs are worse than the Holocaust!

12
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,867
外国佬全都去死！
Death to the wogs!

13
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:58,036
弗朗索瓦・贝鲁万岁！
（法国中间派民主运动党主席，2012年曾参加总统大选）
Hail Francois Bayrou!

14
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:00,163
尼克松万岁！
（曾任美国总统）

15
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,832

你夺不走我的贞操！
You'll never pop my cherry!

18
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,174
一群塔利班小拢
Bunch of Taliban pussies!

19
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,344
你们搞不定我的 别担心！
You won't get to screw me, don't you worry!

20
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,975
“阿拉伯之春”是基佬之春！
（2010年底北非西亚阿拉伯国家发生的社会运动）
The Arab Spring is a spring for faggots!

21
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:27,023
阿尔及尔！阿尔及尔！阿尔及尔！
（北非阿尔及利亚首都，曾是法国殖民地）
Algiers, Algiers, Algiers!

22
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:28,775
大海！性交！太阳！
Sea, sex and sun!

23
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,360
性交！太阳！
Sex and sun!

24
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,817
要是没有你真不晓得会发生什么？
What would have happened without you?

25
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,571
多谢
Thanks.

26
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,576
这里没人认识我真好
I'm glad nobody knows me around here.

27
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,912
如果我们在维耶纳夫 我就帮不了你
If we were in Villeneuve, I couldn't have helped you.

28
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,040
不过这是最后一次
But it's the last time...

29
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,792
你个傻逼
you moron.

30
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,047
我开玩笑的
I'm joking.

31
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,761
你得学习如何问问题
You need to learn how to ask questions.

32
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,891
这是门艺术 懂不懂
It's an art in itself, you know.

33
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:49,022
我也许有糖尿病 但这不是我不懂的原因
I might be a diabetic, but that's not why I don't get it.

34
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:00,992
进来
Come in!

35
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,001
线人的死亡总是错综复杂
The death of an informant is always complicated.

36
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,420
我还是不知道
We still don't know

37
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:13,822
法瑞德・贝纳马是不是
if Farid Benamar was

38
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:16,507
被警局里的人出卖
ratted out by someone in the police precinct.

39
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:17,884
谁发现尸体？
Who found the body?

40
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,054
纳达尔 一个电视记者
Nadal, a television reporter.

41
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:25,266
他在里尔郊区维耶纳夫的一处土丘发现的
（里尔：法国北部最大城市）
He discovered it on a knoll at Villeneuve, a suburb of Lille.

42
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,645
纳达尔住在土丘对面
Nadal lives opposite the knoll.

43
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,231
警局什么反应？
Precinct reactions?

44
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,158
四个月了
For 4 months, we didn't

45
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:36,069
直到他老婆最后告诉法官
even know that Benamar was their snitch...

46
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,113
我们才直到贝纳马是他们的线人
until his wife finally told the judge.

47
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,324
警局有所怀疑吗？
Suspicions on precinct?

48
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,992
我真的不知道
I don't really know.

49
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,954
我们必须找出来是否警局里有人抛弃贝纳马
We must find out if someone at the precinct

50
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:50,833
无论是疏忽还是背叛 就这样！
gave up Benamar, either by negligence or by treason. That's all!

51
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:04,973
祝你好运 你有智慧又有能力
Good luck, you have the intelligence and the faculties it takes.

52
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,725
谢谢您的赞美 审计长先生
Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Comptroller General.

53
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,811
我不会单独行动
And I won't be on my own.

54
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:10,979
还有谁？
Who is it?

55
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:14,107
莎莉・玛里内丽 她被降到内政部
Sally Marinelli, she was demoted to Internal Affairs.

56
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,025
她为什么被降级？
Why was she demoted?

57
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,028
不符合警察道德
Incompatibility with police ethics.

58
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,531
- 什么意思？ - 我不知道
- Which means? - I have no idea.

59
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,867
她在2010年被转到内政部
She was transferred to I.A. In 2010.

60
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,912
我信任你 代我问候她一声
I trust you. You do the same.

61
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,062
很高兴能跟你共事
I'm glad to work with you.

62
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,147
这就好
That's nice.

63
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:59,819
走进警局真令人生厌 演舞台剧似的
Walking into a police department is so tiresome, such theatrics.

64
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:04,866
我们把警局放在黑暗中 让恐惧肆意蠕动
We'll keep the precinct in the dark, let fear creep in by itself.

65
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,119
别用那种眼神看我 莎莉
Don't give me that look, Sally.

66
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:11,414
我们不该让他们轻易就能接近我们 不是吗？
We shouldn't let them get to us that easily, right?

67
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:14,167
我听过很多你的事 知道吗
I've heard so much about you, you know.

68
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:18,129
抱歉 我想是我朋友打来的
Sorry, excuse me, I think it's my friend calling.

69
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,717

晚安 莎莉
Good night, Sally.

71
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:36,981
我回头打给你
I'll call you back.

72
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,166
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

73
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,211
我们没有聊太多
We didn't speak much.

74
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:01,547
走一步看一步吧
I'll see how things turn out.

75
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:06,469
再自信点 对 我知道 亲爱的 可是
Be more self-conscious, yes, I know, darling, but...

76
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,055
我同意
Agreed.

77
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,392
吻安
I kiss you goodnight.

78
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,608
有了沙坑和秋千这里更美了
It's prettier with a sandbox and a swing.

79
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,610
我更喜欢以前的样子
I liked it more before.

80
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,657
你知道这里发生了谋杀吗？有没有很熟悉？
You know there's been a murder here? Does that ring a bell?

81
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,159
没错
It does.

82
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:14,078
总是一样 要么哈基 要么警方线人
（阿尔及利亚民族解放战争中志愿加入法军
的阿尔及利亚穆斯林，相当于卖国贼）
Always the same... Harki or police snitch.

83
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:16,205
总是老一套
Always the same.

84
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:18,916
天色已晚 女士
It is late, Madam.

85
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,402
你又开始抽烟了？
You took up smoking again?

86
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:51,324
我能问你在这里干什么吗？
May I ask what you're doing here?

87
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,661
为什么他们在湖边海滩跟贝纳马见面？
Why did they meet Benamar at the lake beach?

88
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:59,582
- 为什么不直接在土丘见？ - 我不知道
- Why not directly on the knoll? - I don't know.

89
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,336
你说海滩 又说湖边
You speak of a beach, you speak of a lake.

90
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,397
如果你们全都无可指责 那就什么事都没了 邦特蒙普斯
If you all are above reproach all will be well, Bontemps.

91
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,817
我不怕内政部
I'm not afraid of Internal Affairs.

92
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,986
那你从没怀疑过吗？
So you never had any doubts?

93
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:33,366
没有 法瑞德・贝纳马和其他线人一样
No, with Farid Benamar as with any informant,

94
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,243
签过一份协议
there was a protocol...

95
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,788
协议是我的部门 是我们的激情所在
Protocols are my department. It's a passion of mine.

96
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,834
我们的协议
So our protocol...

97
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,587
抱歉我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

98
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,006
你有点儿老啊！
You're kind of old!

105
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:19,579
了解你们和法瑞德・贝纳马的工作方式

106
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,290
以及查出其中是否存在失误

Are you done with your trick and pony show?

113
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,468
罗伯特・门德斯警监 乐意为您效劳
Captain Robert Mendes... at your service.

114
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,555
我是法瑞德・贝纳马的联络人
Farid Benamar's contact,

115
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:20,765
他在警局里最亲密的合作者

116
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:26,937

117
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,440
不 我一直都这么穿

你做我的耳目
You'll be my little weasel.

135
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:48,913
打听 打听 打听 收集所有小细节
Nosy, nosy, nosy, gather all the tiny details.

136
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,540
我家人叫我了
My family needs me.

137
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,279
“阿尔及尔暴动”
Riots in algiers

138
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:20,838
直走
Straight on.

139
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,551
右转
Take a right.

140
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,555
走去清真寺的路
The road to the mosque.

141
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,251
我昨天开始一直在监视
I've been watching since yesterday.

142
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,836
目前为止什么人都没有
So far, there's no one.

143
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,338
贝卡森呢？
And Belkacem?

144
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:06,258
还是没看到她 但我很有耐心
Still haven't seen her. But I have a lot of patience.

145
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,720
我知道 尤尼斯 这是你的优点
I know, Younés, that's a good quality to have.

146
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:13,015
你得继续 你姐姐打给我了
You need to go on. Your sister called me.

147
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,185
她以为她是我妈 烦死我了
She thinks she's my mother. She gets on my nerves.

148
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,980
女人值得尊重 尤尼斯 她们需要被保护
Women deserve respect, Younés. They need protection.

149
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,024
我告诉她别担心
I told her not to worry,

150
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:25,110
我给你预约了医生
that I got you a doctor's appointment.

151
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,865
- 你会尖叫 但是 - 继续 怎么了？
- You'll scream, but... - Go ahead, what's up?

152
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:33,452
我想去阿尔及尔 不长待 明白吗？
I'd like to go to Algiers. Not for too long, understand?

153
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:37,539
当事情发生时我想在那里 成为一份子 
I want to be part of it, be there when things change.

154
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,125
没门 我这里需要你
No way, I need you here.

155
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,129
你他妈的在阿尔及尔能干什么？
What the hell will you do in Algiers?

156
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,633
你没找到线索 但你知道这里发生了什么
You haven't got a clue. But you know what happens here.

157
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,012
一旦你做完该做的 你就可以走 
You can go afterwards, once you did what you had to do.

158
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,226
我不像贝纳马那么聪明 对吧？
I'm not as clever as Benamar, right?

159
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:01,105
不知道 但我们很快就会找出来
No idea, but we'll soon find out.

160
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:04,817
贝卡森一定会要求你做什么事
Belkacem will surely ask you to do something.

161
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:10,239
某项任务 根本不复杂 送信之类的
Some kind of mission, nothing complicated, messenger stuff.

162
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,824
正平静下来了
A drop is going down.

163
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,202
你怎么知道？谁告诉你的？你当时在哪里？
How can you know? Who told you? Where were you?

164
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:19,206
你根本不知道你问的那个人有多重要
You have no idea how important the person you question is.

165
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,041
那是我们的信息源
It is our raw material.

166
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,839
那个人一定是典型的 统一的 友好的 杰出的
That person must be emblematic, unifying, pleasant, brilliant!

167
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,259
什么都可能 除了文静的
Anything but placid!

168
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,428
你必须明白！
You must understand this!

169
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,139
不要曲解你看不见的东西！
And don't misinterpret things you cannot see!

170
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,433
继续 理解我！来吧！
Go ahead, interpret me! Come on!

171
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,768
你觉得我是怎样的人？
What do I make you think of?

172
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,895
我不知道 长官
I don't know, chief.

173
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,856
你看上去像个变态
You look like a pervert.

174
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,275
我不是变态 尤尼斯
I'm no pervert, Younés.

175
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,154
我是专家 我也在教你成为专家
I'm a professional, and I'm teaching you to be one too.

176
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,894
我们得见你妈
We must see your mother.

177
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,189
它们是我爸画的
My father painted them.

178
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:27,900
妈！
Mum!

179
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,111
老妈！
Mother!

180
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,869
贝纳马夫人？
Mrs. Benamal?

181
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,747
埃丝特・拉法吉警司
Chief Superintendent Esther Lafarge,

182
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:46,085
莎莉・玛里内丽指挥官 内政部的
Commander Sally Marinelli, Internal Affairs.

183
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,892
- 他有朋友吗？ - 有
- He got friends? - Yes!

184
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,227
很好
Good.

185
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,188
大多数线人生活不安稳
Most snitches live precariously.

186
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,732
钱 贩毒 进监狱 钱 贩毒 进监狱
Money, trafficking, jail, money, trafficking, jail...

187
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,151
你可以叫它阿尔及利亚过山车
you could call it Algerian roller coaster.

188
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,114
尽管他是那种人你还是喜欢法瑞德
You liked Farid despite the kind of person he was,

189
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,448
我明白
I get it.

190
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,492
想想后果
Consider the fallout!

191
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,995
处理后果是我们的领域 协议更是
Fallout is our domain. And protocol even more.

192
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,123
我不明白你说什么
I don't understand you.

193
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,458
协议能揭露真相
Protocols are very revealing.

194
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,376
协议？
Protocols?

195
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,087
- 线人的协议 - 那是什么？
- For snitches! - How's that?

196
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,256
你知道你老公是线人吗？
You knew your husband snitched?

197
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:33,382
知道
Yes!

198
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,843
那么钱是怎么来的？
So how did the money come in?

199
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,971
5块 10块 20块 50块 或者100块钞票 用过的还是新的？
5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 notes? Used or new?

200
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,598
他跟你说过吗？每一次都说？
Did he tell you ? Every time?

201
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,517
他什么时候跟你说的？
When did he tell you?

202
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,519
这种情况有什么特别之处？
What was special about these occasions?

203
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,522
你有时会数钞票吗？
Did you sometimes count the notes ?

204
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,276
当你数钞票时有什么特别的没？
What was special when you did count the notes?

205
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:02,286
我知道人们不喜欢解释他们的老公怎样收受贿赂
I know people don't like explaining how their husband was bribed.

206
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,456
签了协议可能要干脏事
Going into protocols can be sordid...

207
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,960
即便他收钱是帮警察办事
even if he was paid to help the police

208
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,503
而这意味着他们是共同体
which means the community.

209
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,630
我老公没讲过什么细节
My husband gave no details.

210
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,924
是他让你这么说的
And he told you to say this.

211
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,801
为了保护你
To protect you.

212
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,804
这点我们可以理解 说回钱的事
We can admit that. Back to the money.

213
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:21,763
我不认为
I don't think...

214
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:27,352
法瑞德可能是跟联络人门德斯先生见面后回的家？
Farid possibly came home after meeting his contact, Mr. Mendes?

215
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:31,648
法瑞德安静地坐下 那么协议是什么呢？
Farid calmly sat down and then what was the protocol?

216
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,652
这告诉了我们协议变更的时间
This could tell us when the protocol changed

217
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,613
还有变更协议的那个人
and the person who changed it.

218
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,114
这是我们的工作！
That's our job!

219
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:40,157
我相信
I believe...

220
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,950
让我们回到刚才的话题
Let's take a step back here.

221
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,785
他带着钱回家
He comes home with the money

222
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:47,080
你俩温存了一小段时间
and you share a moment of gratifying intimacy.

223
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,753
你把钞票给孩子看来证明
You show the kid the money to prove that intelligence pays off,

224
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,547
知识渊博会有回报
the intelligence of being well informed.

225
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,214
也许在这张桌子上数钞票
Maybe count the money on

226
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,010
来教孩子心算
the table to teach the kid mental calculation.

227
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,144
湖边的海滩
The beach at the lake.

228
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,813
你想知道是谁送法瑞德
You'd like to know who sent Farid

229
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,358
去跟杀他的凶手见面
where he met his murderers.

230
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,402
那么努力记起来 维吉妮！
So try to remember, Virginie!

231
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,529
莎莉认为这很重要
Sally thinks it's important.

232
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,330
那是你吗？
Is it you?

233
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:30,916
对
Yes.

234
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,086
“湖边海滩”
The Lake Beach

235
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,432
我们一直在等你 有事耽误了？
We've been waiting for you. Were you held up?

236
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,519
他们不让你走是吧？
They are not leaving you alone, right?

237
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,479
去跟其他人坐一起吧
Go sit with the others.

238
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,903
看 这是拉齐达・达蒂
（法国首位女司法部长）
Look, this is Rachida Dati.

239
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,032
她换了发型
She changed her hairstyle.

240
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,579
看上去就像做了整形手术
Looks like plastic surgery to me.

241
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:15,335
她的胸罩凸出了一点
Her bra sticks out a bit.

242
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,004
很性感 对不对？
Sexy, isn't it?

243
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,880
这个小恶魔
The little devil!

244
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,177
沟通至关重要
Communication is essential.

245
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,013
你几岁有自己的第一个房间？
When did you get your first cell?

246
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,390
我六岁的时候 不过已经晚了
I was 6, but that was late.

247
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,809
你始终都需要一个房间
You need a cell at all times

248
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,811
甚至在你童年时
even at a young age.

249
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,188
- 你是几岁的时候？ - 四岁
- When did you get yours? - At 4 !

250
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,816
好棒 我妈是三星人
Great! Mother is a Samsung person.

251
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:41,069
这里的大人更喜欢韩国牌子
Older people here prefer Korean brands.

252
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:57,461
这条漂亮的裙子36码
Beautiful dress. It's a size 36.

253
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,880
你看上去美极了
You look fabulous.

254
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,724
我希望他们全都掉进水里
I wish they all fell into the water.

255
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:11,641
为什么？
Why?

256
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,478
我的急救箱就能派上用场
I could use my first-aid kit on them.

257
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,313
里头应有尽有
It contains everything.

258
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,359
我必须先减减肥 我又胖起来了
I must lose a few pounds first, I've put on weight.

259
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:26,448
如果你有我的责任 要漂亮可不容易
Not easy to look fabulous if you have my responsibilities.

260
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:31,828
妈妈！
Mother!

261
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,934
你要吓死你妈 奥雷利安？
You wanted to scare your mum, Aurélien?

262
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,438
维吉妮 我猜你没有带毛巾
Virginie, I guess you didn't bring a towel.

263
00:23:58,647 --> 00:23:59,856
幸好我在这里
Good that I am here.

264
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,067
你为什么选这片湖滩？
Why did you choose this beach?

265
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,821
你得继续过你的日子 要向前看
You need to get on with your life. Move forward.

266
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,198
我不想回到这里
I did not want to come back here.

267
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,412
大雷雨过后
With my husband, we would

268
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:13,870
我和老公会站在窗边
stand at the window after big thunderstorms.

269
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,791
大雷雨后的光线格外特别
The light is very special after a big thunderstorm

270
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,545
天空看上去截然不同 你也会有不同的感受
the sky looks totally different and you feel different, too.

271
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,588
我总是喜欢这么做
I always loved that.

272
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,366
棒呆了 无法抗拒 我爱你爱到死
Amazing. Overwhelming. I love you to pieces.

273
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,118
做得好 亲爱的
Well done, darling!

274
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,842
多谢 小可爱
Thank you, my love.

275
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,512
让我跟罗曼说话
Let me speak to Romain.

276
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,724
罗曼 是妈妈 你过得好吗？
Romain, it's mum. How are you?

277
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:02,354
我今天见到一个男孩 比你小一点
I met a boy today, a bit younger than you.

278
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:03,980
他看上去很伤心
He looked sad.

279
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,859
我不能告诉你原因 这是调查机密
I can't tell you why, investigation secrecy.

280
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,903
那么你过得好吗？
So how are you then?

281
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,782
很抱歉听你这么说
I'm sorry to hear that.

282
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,287
你也是？
You too?

283
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,792
回想以前的日子 我们常说
Back in my days, we used to say...

284
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,461
大海里的鱼更多
there are more fish in the sea.

285
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:30,340
我知道 这么说很蠢
I know, it's an idiotic thing to say.

286
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:00,870
埃丝特！
Esther!

287
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:04,874
怎么了？
Yes?

288
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,799
当我还是小孩时 我离开了房间 没人会注意到
As a child, when I left the room, nobody would notice.

289
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,759
好的 那又怎样？
Ok... so what?

290
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:20,890
我喜欢反过来 没有人注意到我进入房间
I'd like the opposite, to enter a room without anybody noticing.

291
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,892
- 变成隐形人？ - 没错
- Be invisible? - Yes!

292
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,813
就像没有人注意的维吉妮
Like Virginie, the woman nobody notices.

293
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,275
你真的让她很慌
You really threw her off.

294
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,403
钞票是怎么来的？
How did the money arrive?

295
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:37,282
有5块 10块 50块 100块欧元的钞票吗？
Were there 5, 10, 50 or 100 euro notes?

296
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,436
如果是 每次还是偶尔？
If so, every time or just sometimes?

297
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:41,328
如果是偶尔 在什么情况下？
And if sometimes, on what occasion?

298
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,835
你亲手数过钞票吗？
Did you count the money yourself?

299
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:46,207
如果只是偶尔 在什么情况下？
If only sometimes, on what occasion?

300
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,501
我有工作要做 莎莉
I've got work to do, Sally.

301
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,220
我有最后一个问题
I've got one final question:

302
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:54,674
维吉妮・贝纳马 她很天真 对吗？
Virginie Benamar she's naive, isn't she?

303
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,217
她甚至有点蠢？
She's even a bit stupid?

304
00:27:56,426 --> 00:28:00,096
她明白可她不愿面对
She understood things but doesn't want to face them.

305
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:01,931
有点像你
A bit like you.

306
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,934
我要给你第一项任务 莎莉
I'd like to give you your first assignment, Sally.

307
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,105
- 你够老练吗？ - 特别老练
- Are you tactful? - Very much so.

308
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,566
- 对付阿尔及利亚人呢？ - 更老练
- With Algerians? - Even more.

309
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,568
给我把门德斯的新线人找出来
So find me Mendes's new snitch!

310
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:33,630
怎么找？
How?

311
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,719
我无法掌控你派给我们的那俩女人
I can't get a grip on the two women you sent us.

312
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,350
你说“公正”是什么意思？
What do you mean by "Fairness"?

313
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,353
人们总是更喜欢埃丝特的公正
People always refer to Esther's fairness.

314
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,146
她的公正独树一帜
Her fairness is distinctive.

315
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:51,523
我不是指她的工作
I don't mean her work.

316
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,652
告诉我更多她的详情
Tell me more intimate details about her...

317
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,656
以便让我适应她
things that allow me to adapt to her.

318
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,909
关于她的家庭？
About her family?

319
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,079
婚姻状况？
Marital?

320
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,541
不符合警察道德的行为
Private behaviour incompatible with police ethics.

321
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,721
不符合警察道德？
Incompatible with police ethics?

322
00:29:11,722 --> 00:29:13,712
她们舔阴 不是吧？
They're muff divers, aren't they?

323
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,465
我不明白 我要细节
I don't get it. Give me details.

324
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,385
- 她们喜欢互打 - 什么？
- They like hitting each other! - What?

325
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,681
埃丝特更喜欢 这不是情感问题
Esther needs more. It's not a sentimental problem...

326
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,016
她需要新环境 做出改变
she needs new surroundings, a change of set.

327
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,601
解释一下！
explain!

328
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,857
莎莉也有问题吗？
Does Sally also have problems?

329
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,611
继续说 我要细节
Go ahead, give me details!

330
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,654
她偷窥
She peeps.

331
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,949
“她偷窥”是什么意思？
What do you mean "She peeps"?

332
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:46,536
她的眼睛有毒
She's kind of vicious with her eyes.

333
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,538
胡说！
Crap!

334
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,003
别给吓死了 放松点
Stop freaking out. Take it easy.

335
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,756
她们俩会冒出各种各样的理论
Those two will come up with all sorts of theories.

336
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:01,009
像那样的女孩需要许多的可能性
Girls like that require any number of possibilities.

337
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,594
否则她们会感到束缚
Otherwise they feel fenced in.

338
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,941
我能借用您几分钟吗？
May I have a moment?

339
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,836
我获得了一些
I gathered some information

340
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:24,324
关于埃丝特・拉法吉和莎莉・玛里内丽的信息
on Esther Lafarge and Sally Marinelli.

341
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:26,451
我能坐下吗？
May I sit down?

342
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:30,914
看来她们有点怪异
It appears they're a bit weird.

343
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,335
你在暗示什么 门德斯？
What are you insinuating, Mendes?

344
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,546
我是指性方面
I mean sexually...

345
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,425
一个喜欢打人 另一个喜欢偷窥
one likes to hit, the other one peeps.

346
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,136
那你觉得警察是干什么的？
What do you think the police is doing then?

347
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,692
门德斯 去厕所涂鸦吧 如果这能让你感觉好些的话
Mendes, draw graffiti in the toilets if it makes you feel better.

348
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,267
- 喝啤酒不？ - 不喝
- You want a beer? - No!

349
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,477
- 跟我喝一小口吧？ - 我说了不喝！
- A little beer with me? - I said no!

350
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:36,980
你的眼眸真蓝 我必须请你喝酒
Your eyes are so blue, I must buy you a drink.

351
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:38,314
我重复一遍  不喝！
I repeat - no!

352
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:41,359
- 好啦 犯不着发飙！ - 继续 喊大点声！
- Ok, don't blow a fuse! - Go ahead, rant louder!

353
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,738
别烦我！给我闭嘴！去他妈的！
Give me a break! Stop that crap, for fuck's sake!

354
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,875
女人应当被尊重和保护
Women should be respected and protected.

355
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,878
你身手不错
You throw a nice punch.

356
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,505
他也许把你牙齿打掉了
He might have kicked your teeth in.

357
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,799
多么迷人的微笑
Such a gorgeous smile.

358
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,468
女人的微笑能改变生活
A woman's smile can change a life.

359
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:11,514
有点陈词滥调 可我喜欢
That might be a banality, but I like it.

360
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,893
你有女朋友吗？
Do you have a girlfriend?

361
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,313
目前没有
Not at the moment.

362
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,232
这是你第一次来这里吗？
Is it the first time you come here?

363
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,693
对 刚好路过
Yes, just passing through.

364
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,446
那么你是？
And you are...?

365
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,161
看这里
Look here.

366
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,915
猜猜这是什么？
Guess what this is?

367
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,334
一个搭档？
A partner?

368
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,212
我从没这么想过
I never thought of it.

369
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:45,757
为什么不呢？
Why not indeed?

370
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:52,555
我的注射器做搭档
My syringe as a partner...

371
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,315
那啥？
So?

372
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:11,986
真的 我们甚至看不到星星 这正常吗？
It's true, we can't even see the stars. Is that normal?

373
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,740
这叫做光污染 遮住了一切东西
It's called light pollution. It blocks everything.

374
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,955
阿尔及尔的天空是什么样子？
What's the sky like in Algiers?

375
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,666
不知道 我从没去过那里
No idea, I've never been there.

376
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,545
真可惜 我想有人能跟我讲讲
Pity, I'd like someone to tell me about it.

377
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,090
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

378
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:34,759
我不知道
I don't know...

379
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:39,847
跟你在一起感觉真好 这可不常有
Being with you feels good. It doesn't happen very often.

380
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,352
你没有其他人吗？
You have nobody?

381
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,604
你是指重要的人？
You mean people who count?

382
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,606
没错 重要的人
Yes, people who count.

383
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,025
也许吧
Maybe.

384
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,946
有个保护我的人 他问我问题
There's a guy who protects me. He's asking me questions.

385
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,531
你的哥哥？
Your big brother?

386
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,992
我没有哥哥只有一个姐姐
I don't have a brother, just a sister.

387
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:06,207
有意思 我也跟一个问问题的人一起 女人
Funny, I'm also with someone who asks questions. A woman.

388
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,626
她保护你吗？
Does she protect you?

389
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,504
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

390
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:20,054
你来这里是为了躲开你的搭档吗？
By coming here, you tried to get away from your partner?

391
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,099
也许吧
Maybe.

392
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:25,977
也许什么？
Maybe what?

393
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:29,188
呼吸新鲜空气
A bit of fresh air.

394
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:32,233
这就是门德斯感兴趣的方式
That's the formula Mendes is interested in.

395
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,695
我想你听到流言了吧？他在到处打探
I suppose you heard the rumors? He's snooping around.

396
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,572
我不在乎
I don't care.

397
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:42,702
你想离开你的搭档
You want to leave your partner...

398
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,745
他叫艾哈迈德 对吧？
He's called Ahmed, right?

399
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:50,793
完全想不出来他是什么人
Not making one's mind up happens to anybody.

400
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,212
也许吧
Maybe.

401
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,095
艾哈迈德穿哪种衣服？
What kind of clothes does Ahmed wear?

402
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,681
非常简单
Quite simple.

403
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,684
天鹅绒 春天的颜色
Some velvet, some spring colours.

404
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,104
杰拉德呢？
What about Gérald?

405
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,566
他是个打领结的家伙
He's a bow-tie guy.

406
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,259
这是有多少红绿灯啊？
How many of these traffic lights are there?

407
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:45,264
“不符合警察道德”说的就是你
"Incompatibility with police ethics" Says your file.

408
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:46,682
你想知道 对吧？
You want to know, don't you?

409
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:49,769
我本可以像门德斯那样打电话
I could have phoned around, like Mendes.

410
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,771
但我更期望当你想说的时候
I prefer that you tell me yourself...

411
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:53,940
由你自己亲口告诉我
when you feel like it.

412
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:01,405
世界上唯一理解我的人就是我的老公
The only person in the world to understand me is my husband.

413
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:05,576
我俩特别讨厌分开 哪怕只有几天
So much so that we hate to separate, even for a few days.

414
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,248
这是好事还是坏事 我真的不知道
Is that a good thing or is it bad, I don't really know.

415
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:16,879
他用我需要的方式摇晃我
He shakes me the way I need to be shaken.

416
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:19,090
令我浑身颤抖
Shake me all over.

417
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,553
就像你一样 莎莉 对吗？
Just like you, Sally, right?

418
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:27,265
我真正需要的是看上去没那么笨手笨脚
What I really need is to look less gawky.

419
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,645
如果我告诉你消息 你会帮我吗？
If I tell you something, will you return me the favour?

420
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,941
我可以给你正在跟踪你的人的名字
I can give you the name of a person who's tailing you right now.

421
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,944
那个搅屎棍什么居心？
What's that shit-stirrer up to?

422
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,197
你一定是纳达尔吧？
You must be Nadal?

423
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:45,866
没有黑幕 我不感兴趣 从不！
No shady deals, I'm not interested. Never!

424
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,412
如果你愿意跟我谈 我们可以结盟
I could be an ally if you accepted to talk to me.

425
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,665
也许是你唯一的盟友 我知道很多事
Your only ally, maybe. I know about many things.

426
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:56,794
纳达尔 你很难过 你丢了电视台的工作
Nadal, you're upset, you lost your job on television.

427
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,004
我明白
I get it.

428
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,539
我一点都不难过
I'm not upset at all.

429
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,383
你是在找警局的人吗？
Are you going after somebody in the precinct?

430
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,678
他们我全认识 我认识他们很多年了
I know them all, I've been seeing them for years.

431
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,014
我发现了贝纳马的尸体
I discovered Benamar's body.

432
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,224
纳达尔 你很痛苦！
Nadal, you are anguished!

433
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,935
我们女人知道怎么应付 对吧莎莉？
We women know how to deal with that, right Sally?

434
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:16,063
- 痛苦吓不到我们 - 不 一点也不
- Anguish doesn't scare us. - No, not in the least.

435
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,442
天呐 我不痛苦 我可以帮你 该死！
For God's sake, I'm not anguished. I could help you, shit!

436
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,943
够了！
That's enough!

437
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:23,529
滚出我的车！
Get out of my car!

438
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:27,825
是跟降级的同事合作让你变成这样吗？
Does working with a demoted colleague make you act like this?

439
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,459
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

440
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:38,878
他
He's...

441
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,340
他失业了
He's jobless.

442
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,467
不 没有失业 他是寄生虫
No, not jobless, he's a parasite.

443
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:46,677
不 他不是寄生虫
No, he's not a parasite...

444
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,138
他是偷窥狂
he's a Peeping Tom.

445
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,809
你说“偷窥狂”是什么意思？
What do you mean by "Peeping Tom"?

446
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:57,396
法瑞德带回家的钞票
Farid bringing home the banknotes

447
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,274
一定是你们关系中的特殊一环
had to be a particularity in your relationship.

448
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:03,319
莎莉 问她他看上去什么样
Sally, ask her what he looked like:

449
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,321
他说话的方式 他的身体语言
the way he talked, his body language.

450
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:07,365
身体语言？
Body language?

451
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,158
就打个比方
It's a figure of speech.

452
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:12,119
这在警察工作中很重要 对吧？
They are important in police work. Right?

453
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:15,706
我六岁起就对身体语言产生了兴趣
I've taken an interest in body language since I was six.

454
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,876
莎莉还没有掌握这门语言
It's a language Sally hasn't got a grip on yet.

455
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,380
我们会一步一步教会她
We'll teach her one step at a time.

456
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:27,718
他跟上司的关系怎样？
What was his relationship with his superiors?

457
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,763
他从不谈论他的同事
He never talked about the people he was working with.

458
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,015
“做对的事让他们说去吧”
"Do right and let them speak."

459
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:36,894
又是打比方 也许是最好的一个
Another figure of speech. Maybe the most beautiful of all.

460
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,146
其实说的是
It really says

461
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:43,692
“如果不会搞砸正在做的事就让他们说去吧”
"Let them speak if it doesn't screw up what's being done."

462
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:44,777
对吧 莎莉？
Right, Sally?

463
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,655
我们在追根究底 这仅仅是开始！
We're digging. This is just the beginning!

464
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:51,867
我们只想回到原来的生活
We just want our lives back.

465
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:55,871
追根究底对我们无济于事
Digging it all up again won't help us.

466
00:40:56,122 --> 00:41:00,167
让生活继续？我们在这里不是为了让生活继续的！
Help moving things along? We're not here to move things along!

467
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,386
我们是为了搞定别人
We're here to screw people,

468
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:04,630
我们也许能搞定对的人
we might as well screw the right ones.

469
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,092
您为什么要说这么粗鲁的话 长官？
Why do you use such vulgar language, Madam?

470
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,183
抱歉 我马上就回来
Excuse me, I'll be back in a second.

471
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:49,216
那是我老爸
That's my father.

472
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:52,636
他来法国之前在阿尔及利亚当警察
He was a policeman in Algeria before coming to France.

473
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:56,015
在法国 他也成为了警察
In France, he became a policeman again.

474
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:58,350
有意思
Some story.

475
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,144
不全对 奥雷利安
Not entirely, Aurélien.

476
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:02,813
他教我画画
He taught me how to draw.

477
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:05,024
我也有个儿子 奥雷利安
I also have a son, Aurélien.

478
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,151
他比你大一点 他叫罗曼
He's a bit older than you. His name is Romain.

479
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:09,778
那又怎样 关我屁事
So what, I don't give a shit.

480
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:25,044
他一定喜欢你“美丽的法国女人”的模样吧？
He must have liked your "Beautiful French woman" Aspect?

481
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:28,255
你有双淡褐色的眼睛 结实的身体
You have hazel eyes, a firm body.

482
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,176
更别说其他优点了
Not to mention other advantages.

483
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:35,012
他不是为了法国护照才娶我
He didn't marry me to get a French passport.

484
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:38,057
莎莉一定被跨国婚姻感动了
Sally must be touched by a mixed marriage.

485
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,601
莎莉亲身经历过
Sally experienced one herself.

486
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:44,146
难道你们的婚姻不更像个浪漫故事吗？
Wasn't your marriage more of a romantic story?

487
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:46,690
我想法瑞德并不觉得浪漫
I don't think Farid found it romantic.

488
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,652
我相信法国是个浪漫的国家
He believed France to be romantic.

489
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,154
他一直在讲法国多么宏伟
He kept talking about France's grandeur

490
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:54,323
还有著名的政治家等等
its famous statesmen and so on.

491
00:42:54,532 --> 00:42:57,493
- 他背叛了自己的国家 - 不 他没有！
- And he betrayed for France. - No, he didn't!

492
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,038
真的信徒必须无视跟他们无关的事
True believers must ignore things not of their concern.

493
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:04,208
穆斯林不关心跟他无关的事
A Muslim doesn't care about things which don't concern him.

494
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:07,670
你老公没有追随穆罕默德的圣训 维吉妮
Your husband did not follow Mohammed's hadith, Virginie.

495
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,256
我知道他是信徒
And I know he was a believer.

496
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:11,715
我不说阿拉伯语
I don't speak Arabic.

497
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,468
埃丝特在阿尔及利亚工作过 能说流利的阿拉伯语
Esther worked in Algeria and speaks well.

498
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:17,096
她的能力简直难以置信
Unbelievable the things she can do.

499
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:19,209
你老公给贝卡森网络做事
Your husband worked on

500
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,433
是不是很耳熟？
the Belkacem network. Does that ring a bell?

501
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:22,601
没有
No.

502
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,062
“贝卡森网络”？
"Belkacem network"?

503
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:39,243
最糟糕的事现在显然已经结束了
Obviously, the worst is over now.

504
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,915
如果又来一遍的话就太可怜了
Pity if it started all over again.

505
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:46,250
什么？
What?

506
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,960
肮脏的事
The nastiness.

507
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:54,592
有些情况下 你得清楚自己的位置
In some situations, you need to know where you stand.

508
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:59,221
你曾是线人的老婆 现在你是他的遗孀
You were the wife of a snitch, now you are his widow.

509
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,098
这可不是一码事
It's not the same thing.

510
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:03,809
现在更微妙
It's more delicate.

511
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:05,352
我尽力了
I do what I can.

512
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:11,859
生活在恐惧与耻辱中可不容易
It can't be easy to live in fear and shame.

513
00:44:14,945 --> 00:44:16,447
我还有奥雷利安
I've still got Aurélien.

514
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:19,408
别忘了保持低调
Don't forget to keep a low profile.

515
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,369
老妈 我们晚上吃什么？
Mum, what do we eat tonight?

516
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,754
法瑞德不得不跟贝卡森做什么事？
What did Farid have to do with Belkacem?

517
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:34,757
你有个漂亮的儿子
You have a beautiful son.

518
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:37,551
每一天他愈来愈像他爸
He looks more like his father every day.

519
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,099
学校怎么样？
How is school?

520
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,478
我听说你有点暴力
I've heard you're a bit violent.

521
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,981
- 你爸可不暴力 - 我知道
- Your dad wasn't violent. - I know.

522
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,901
- 你在暴力中寻找什么？ - 不知道
- What do you look for in violence? - I dunno.

523
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,445
把暴力忘了吧 那没用
Forget about violence, it doesn't help.

524
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:29,144
你还不够谨慎
You're not exactly discreet.

525
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:43,992
三天前 一个35岁蓝眼睛的金发女郎在这里喝酒
3 days ago, a 35 year old blonde with blue eyes had a drink here.

526
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:48,914
瘦得营养不良 有很多雀斑 耳熟不？
Lanky and underfed, with lots of freckles. Ring a bell?

527
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:52,000
我不知道你说的是谁
I don't know who you mean.

528
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:55,838
那么这个呢？
What about this then?

529
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:59,091
- 你想从她那得到什么？ - 你呢？
- What do you want of her? - And you?

530
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,176
我喜欢她
I fancy her.

531
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,137
她是条子
She's a cop.

532
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,182
- 跟你有关系吗？ - 当然有！
- Is that any of your business? - Yes, it is!

533
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,229
她为了贝纳马而来
She's here for Benamar.

534
00:46:13,564 --> 00:46:17,025
- 你怕她吗？ - 我得保护我们 仅此而已
- Are you scared of her? - I need to protect us, that's all.

535
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,157
我请你喝一杯
I'll buy you a drink.

536
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:37,546
“湖边海滩”
The Lake Beach

537
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:54,980
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

538
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:04,239
女人会向你要她们想要的东西 但她们不会明白
The women can ask what they want, but they won't understand.

539
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:09,244
我老婆什么都明白
My wife understood everything from inside.

540
00:47:11,288 --> 00:47:13,332
但她花了我很多钱
But she cost me a lot of money.

541
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:16,168
她仍然大手大脚
And she still costs a lot.

542
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:24,426
拉法吉和玛里内丽不明白什么？
What is it that Lafarge and Marinelli don't understand?

543
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:28,138
所有事
All of this.

544
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:33,143
睡着的人和提供不了线索的人
People who are asleep and who don't have a clue.

545
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:38,148
或是能突然帮你的人 就像法瑞德
Or people who can help you all of a sudden... like Farid.

546
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:44,363
法瑞德真正喜欢的是跟门德斯谈话
What Farid really liked was talking to Mendes.

547
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:50,369
我想知道是否门德斯真的能够胜任
I wonder if Mendes is really up to it.

548
00:47:51,537 --> 00:47:53,288
他难以控制
He's unmanageable.

549
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,252
他会对那俩女人干出蠢事来
He'll do something stupid with these two women.

550
00:47:58,502 --> 00:48:00,587
别担心 我对他有把握
Don't worry, I have a hold on him.

551
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:07,803
我们搞砸法瑞德的事了吗？
Did we screw it up with Farid?

552
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,056
我相信没有
I don't believe we did.

553
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:14,726
但我一直在想一件事
But I keep thinking about one thing...

554
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,772
贝纳马没能持久
that Benamar wouldn't last long.

555
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:23,193
你能觉察到某人能不能持久
You can sense it, if someone will last or not.

556
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:29,116
我也觉察到
I also sense it about Mendes

557
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:31,743
门德斯无法持久
that he's not going to last.

558
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:33,662
我希望我是错的
I hope I'm wrong.

559
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:35,914
我也觉察到我的老婆
I sensed it about my wife, too.

560
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,705
在复活节
There are 3 categories of

561
00:48:54,706 --> 00:48:57,686
真主安拉会无视三种人
men Allah will ignore on Resurrection Day:

562
00:48:58,312 --> 00:49:01,899
通奸的老人 对人民说谎的统治者
an adulterous old man, a ruler lying to his people

563
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:04,026
还有自豪的穷人
and a poor man filled with pride.

564
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:05,527
你为什么这么丑？
Why are you so ugly?

565
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:07,487
卡洛琳！
Caroline!

566
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:14,870
这周我陪我女儿
I have my daughter this week.

567
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:18,749
逗她开心可不容易 她跟她妈都玩过了
Entertaining her isn't easy, she's done it all with her mother.

568
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,376
多谢你给我莎莉的消息
Thanks for the info on Sally.

569
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:24,630
“不符合警察道德的个人行为”
"Private behaviour incompatible with police ethics."

570
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:28,508
你他妈的在她们车上干什么？
What the hell were you doing in their car?

571
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,011
你害怕了 对吧？我不惊讶
You got scared, didn't you? I'm not surprised.

572
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,306
我从阳台上看见你在黎明时潜伏在周围
I watch you lurk around at dawn from my balcony.

573
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:36,433
你在寻找什么？
What are you looking for?

574
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:38,393
那么现在你在监视我咯
So now you spy on me.

575
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:41,730
你这个搅屎棍 偷窥狂
You're a shit-stirrer and a Peeping Tom.

576
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:44,733
就跟我一样 不是吗？拼命想脱身？
Just like me, no? Struggling to get out?

577
00:49:44,942 --> 00:49:48,362
为什么读这个？每个人都知道你输了
Why read that? Everybody knows you're lost.

578
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,571
没有！
No!

579
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,781
什么 没有？ 
What, no?

580
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:51,907
我在工作
I'm working.

581
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:55,243
我们可以就贝纳马的案子写一本大书
We could write a great book on the Benamar case.

582
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:57,871
我们给书起名叫作
We'd call it "Until Death do us part,

583
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,582
《直到死亡将我们分离，我们有认真对待警察工作吗？》
Are we serious in our police work?"

584
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,542
你个蠢货！
You little shit!

585
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:05,087
我需要独家新闻
I need a scoop.

586
00:50:12,386 --> 00:50:13,470
那张照片上是什么？
What's that photo about?

587
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,764
你从没见过那种人
You've never seen someone like that.

588
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:17,975
我不知道 那是谁？
I don't know. Who is it?

589
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:19,476
最美丽的女人
The most beautiful woman.

590
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,565
大日子到了是吧 莎莉？
So the big day has come, Sally?

591
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:28,860
你说的没错 这件毛衣需要指甲油
You're right, this sweater calls for nail varnish.

592
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:49,756
洛兹扬斯基 你一直是贝纳马的引路人吗？
Rozynski, were you Benamar's pilot all the time?

593
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:53,218
对 门德斯提议雇佣
Yes, Mendes proposed to hire Farid Benamar

594
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:55,178
法瑞德・贝纳马做线人
who turned informant.

595
00:50:56,013 --> 00:51:00,142
门德斯是他的联络人 他直接向我汇报
Mendes was his contact and he reported directly to me.

596
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:04,104
贝纳马曾是阿尔及利亚警察 他逃出了自己的国家
Benamar was an Algerian policeman who had fled his country.

597
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,606
我们看见他在附近游荡
We saw him hanging around.

598
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,067
他在警局附近游荡？
Hanging around the precinct, was he?

599
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:12,654
许多阿尔及利亚警察在法国通过这种方式变成了线人
Many Algerian policemen turned informant in France this way.

600
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,740
这种方式？真的吗？
This way? Really?

601
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:16,074
当然是真的
Absolutely.

602
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:20,662
另一种协议？
Another protocol?

603
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:22,497
也许吧
Maybe...

604
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:27,169
他想念他的工作 有些人就是有种使命感
he was missing his work. Some people have a calling.

605
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:32,883
所以法瑞德每晚在警局附近游荡
So Farid hung around the precinct every night...

606
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:35,385
- 像一个 - 不 不是像妓女！
- Like a... - No, not like a whore!

607
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:38,138
难道他不能申请政治避难吗？
Couldn't he apply for political asylum?

608
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:42,851
伊斯兰主义者迫害不符合避难条件 你知道的
Islamist persecution doesn't qualify for asylum, you know that.

609
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:44,436
所以他不能
So he couldn't.

610
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,104
你是怎样吸收他的？
How did you turn him?

611
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,357
一旦你被恐吓 你就陷入恐怖之中
Once you're terrorized, you stay terrorized.

612
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,985
他在那里目睹的事情使他深受震惊
The things he witnessed over there left him spooked.

613
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:57,699
莎莉认为你们仨在依法办事
Sally supposes your trio operated according to the law.

614
00:51:58,158 --> 00:51:58,825
当然
Absolutely.

615
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:01,369
如果警察在暗中行事
If the police works in the shadow

616
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:05,499
你必须解释清楚 对吧莎莉？
you must shed light on them, right Sally?

617
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:10,295
然而 因为必要的保密性与一定的互惠性
Yet, because of required secrecy and a certain reciprocity

618
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:14,091
线人总是需要阴影区 对吧莎莉？
snitches always need shadow zones, right Sally?

619
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:17,761
- 互惠性？ - 没错 互惠性！
- Reciprocity? - Yes, reciprocity!

620
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:21,098
莎莉在解释这些术语上很有一套
Sally is better at explaining these terms.

621
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:22,349
请吧莎莉
Please Sally.

622
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:24,058
在线人跟警察之间
A certain amount of give

623
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:26,394
定量的给予与索取
and take between informants and policemen.

624
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:34,111
警察能容忍跟职位相当的轻罪
A cop tolerating misdemeanors as counterpart

625
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,863
这可以叫作阴影区 不是吗？
one could call it shadow zone, no?

626
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:38,296
未获得批准的活动
It would be highly

627
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:41,493
显得非常可疑
questionable as such actions were not approved.

628
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:45,664
你是在试图让我相信法瑞德无可指责吗？
Are you trying to make us believe that Farid was beyond reproach?

629
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:53,380
贝纳马的不正当行动被提及了 贩毒
Shady activities by Benamar were mentioned. Drug trafficking.

630
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,757
- 受保护的行动？ - 没错！
- Protected activities? - Yes!

631
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:58,260
莎莉担心线人权力太大
Sally worries about informants getting too powerful.

632
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:00,137
权力太大 怎么会这么想？
Powerful... in what sense?

633
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:02,222
有的变得贪婪
Some just turn greedy.

634
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:11,731
神秘的转向 对吗？
Mysterious turn of events, right?

635
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:14,776
衣服什么时候不再合身了？
When does the suit no longer fit?

636
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:17,195
为什么不是昨天或是明天？
Why not yesterday or even tomorrow?

637
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:20,991
莎莉一直想胖可从没胖起来
Sally keeps wondering, but she'll never put on weight.

638
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:24,720
是否有重要的毒贩
Were there important drug

639
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:28,123
法瑞德可能没有或不想告发出来？
dealers Farid could or would not inform on?

640
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:30,250
譬如贝卡森
Like Belkacem.

641
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,544
贝卡森的案子是特例
Belkacem's case is special.

642
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:36,047
你的部门有保护毒贩吗？
Does your department protect drug dealers?

643
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:38,842
腐败吗？
Corruption?

644
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:46,057
回答我！
Answer me!

645
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,143
你查不出什么来的
You won't dig up a thing.

646
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:50,103
我们走着瞧
We'll see about that.

647
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,523
你有遵守法瑞德的协议吗？
Did you follow protocol on Farid?

648
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:11,166
我喜欢谈话或是沉默
I love talk or silence.

649
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:40,528
到今天我也没做错什么事
I've done nothing wrong to this day,

650
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,614
说真的
sincerely.

651
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:46,076
我照章办事遵守了保护协议
I followed protection protocols by the book.

652
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:56,878
拉齐达・贝卡森 该你上了！
Rachida Belkacem, you're up!

653
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,634
作为各位的新任主席 我感谢各位
As your new President, I thank you.

654
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,670
感谢各位前来
Thank you for coming to

655
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:07,430
庆祝我们协会的十周年纪念日
celebrate our association's 10th anniversary.

656
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:11,601
我们的前主席是法瑞德・贝纳马
Our former President was Farid Benamar.

657
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,187
我确信各位没有忘记他的事迹
I'm sure you haven't forgotten his story.

658
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:21,152
1991年 伊斯兰拯救阵线正赢得大选
（伊斯兰原教旨主义组织，阿尔及利亚最大反对党）
In 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front was winning the elections.

659
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:25,490
军方在两轮选举之间夺权
The military seized power between the two election rounds.

660
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:29,119
伊斯兰主义者被窃取了胜利果实 没错
The Islamists had been robbed of their victory, yes...

661
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,871
那么留给他们的是什么呢？
so what were they left with?

662
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:35,709
公务员被枪杀 警察被取决？
Civil servants to be shot, policemen to be executed?

663
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:37,669
历史的嘲讽性转折
Ironic turn of history.

664
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,799
数千名阿尔及利亚警察 包括法瑞德在内
Thousands of Algerian policemen, Farid among them,

665
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:47,178
鼓起勇气寻求法国避难
took the brave decision to seek sanctuary in France

666
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:49,931
开启新生活
and to start their lives from scratch.

667
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:52,559
我要向他的妻子维吉妮
I would like to honour his memory

668
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:55,437
表达感谢之情
acknowledge his wife, Virginie.

669
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:07,907
我想说几句话
I'd like to add a few simple words.

670
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:12,329
我想致敬法瑞德・贝纳马
I want to honour the memory of Farid Benamar

671
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:17,334
我想说让我们举杯祝他健康
And I feel like saying let's drink and eat to his health.

672
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:19,878
各位应该知道法瑞德
You should know that Farid...

673
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,838
我们全都读过报纸
We've all read the papers

674
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:24,883
线人 毒贩 这都什么意思？
a snitch, a drug dealer, what does all that mean?

675
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,218
诚实的人应该领导我们
Honest people should lead us.

676
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:29,471
我们谈到了公正
Here we talk of fairness,

677
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,890
正直
of integrity,

678
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:34,768
整体 公平
of totality, of impartiality,

679
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,104
我们谈到了民族感情
we talk of national feelings

680
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,525
承认每个人权利的正义感
feelings on justice of recognizing everyone's rights

681
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:45,695
而不是强制执行属地法
and not about enforcing existing territorial laws.

682
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:49,157
这远远超出了我们的想法
This couldn't be further from our thoughts.

683
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,453
没错先生 你在冒天下之大不韪！
Yes Sir, you're offending!

684
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:03,671
我意识到 失去一位亲密好友
I realised that, by losing such a close friend

685
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:08,760
我也失去了对我非常重要的人
I lost someone who was very important to me.

686
00:57:21,398 --> 00:57:24,484
贝纳马是开明的人 贝卡森是独裁者
Benamar was open, Belkacem is authoritarian.

687
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:25,944
她非常顽固
She's very opinionated.

688
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:29,280
- 我们中有条子 - 他们想要什么？
- There are cops among us. - What do they want?

689
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:32,283
他们一定是冲着贝纳马的遗孀来的
They must be here for Benamar's widow.

690
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,868
她靠什么生活？
She lives on what?

691
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:36,871
她应该去工作而不是打扮得花枝招展
She should get to work rather than doll up.

692
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:40,500
我女儿告诉我 她儿子在学校变得很暴力
Her son turned violent at school, my girl told me.

693
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:44,212
天呐 你为什么这么说？
My God, why do you talk like this?

694
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:46,881
维吉妮是位善良的女士
Virginie is a nice lady,

695
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:49,843
她有一条大狗
she has a big dog.

696
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:52,637
qalb不是kelb 她心胸开阔
Qalb not kelb, she has a big heart'.!

697
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:57,976
kelb指的是狗 qalb指的是心
（皆为阿拉伯语）
Kelb means dog, qalb means heart.

698
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:12,407
- 他的阿拉伯语烂死了 - 他还在学习中
- He speaks awful Arabic. - He's still taking lessons.

699
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,244
拉齐达・达蒂的优雅来自哪里？
Where did Rachida Dati's elegance come from?

700
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,163
她究竟是谁？
Who on earth is she?

701
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:20,790
她的优雅来自她母亲
Her elegance comes from her mother.

702
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:23,585
但她不想被人知道
But she doesn't want it known.

703
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:26,504
- 为什么？ - 因为她比她更漂亮
- Why? - Because she's much prettier than her.

704
00:58:26,713 --> 00:58:28,214
她是真正的女人！
She's a real woman!

705
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:33,386
拉齐达・达蒂年纪跟你一样
Rachida Dati is as old as you are.

706
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:35,763
跟我一样大？说给你自己听的吧！
Me old? Speak for yourself!

707
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:39,142
不要说反话 要不就闭嘴
Don't say the contrary of what you think or shut up.

708
00:58:40,477 --> 00:58:42,228
我是个时髦的人！

709

我只买奢侈品

710
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,734
我认识巴黎罗马最大的骗子
I know the greatest liars in Paris, Rome.

711
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,153
不是骗子而是时尚设计师！
Not liars but fashion designers!

712
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:54,032
我知道怎么打扮 我非常“男孩”（西班牙语）！
I know how to dress, I am very "Chicos"!

713
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,118
“男孩”（西班牙语）？没错！
"Chicos“? Chikkour , yes!

714
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,787
下面没有拢
There's no pussy in that!

715
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,253
去洗干净你的掳桑
Go clean your pussy!

716
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:13,051
你好 维吉妮
Hello Virginie.

717
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:14,427
您好 洛兹扬斯基先生

您本该来参加我丈夫的葬礼

720
00:59:20,016 --> 00:59:21,768
您另有安排吗？
You had another engagement?

721
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,811
不 没有安排
No, that wasn't it.

722
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:28,399
我猜协议里没有您的存在？
I suppose your presence wasn't part of the protocol?

723
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:30,193
没错
Yes.

724
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:17,156
洛兹扬斯基担心我 他看上去很憔悴
Rozynski worries me. He looks fragile.

725
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:22,078
他会突然昏倒 我希望他倒对了方向
He'll keel over. I hope in the right direction.

726
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:27,625
我想他将给我们一些有趣的东西
I think he's going to give us some juicy stuff.

727
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:29,085

729
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:42,223
我们已经十天没见
We haven't seen each other in ten days.

730
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,934
感觉却更像过了十年
It felt more like ten years.

731
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:50,648
待在你哥那会让罗曼不爽吗？
Did staying at your brother's upset Romain?

732
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:53,610
我不想这几天留他一个人在家
I don't want to leave him alone these days.

733
01:00:54,736 --> 01:00:57,405
他需要尽快找个新女友

734
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:01,909
我们的儿子知道自己该做什么

735
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:05,622
你的力量恢复了没 亲爱的？

736
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:09,167
我要好好爽一把
I do want a lot of pleasure.

737
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:04,532
别打我的蛋蛋！

738
01:03:11,456 --> 01:03:12,665
住手！
Stop it!

739
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:24,135
拉法吉夫人！
Mrs. Lafarge!

740
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:57,418
据（法国）《世界报》报道 阿尔及利亚暴动开始后
800 wounded and 5 casualties in Algeria since the riots started,

741
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,796
已造成八百人受伤及五人死亡
according to Le Monde.

742
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:02,965
暴力事件使得阿尔及利亚动荡了一整年

743
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:07,261
我在阿尔及利亚度假 物价高得吓死人
I spent my holidays in Algeria, prices are sky high,

744
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,599
在阿尔及利亚生活几乎跟在法国一样贵
life in Algeria is almost as expensive as it is in France

745
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:15,853
而薪水却比法国低十三倍
while salaries are 13 times lower than in France...

746
01:04:16,813 --> 01:04:20,066
年轻人就跟在法国一样参与暴动
Young people are rioting just like in France.

747
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:23,486
他们不满他们的政府 反之亦然
They're unhappy with their government and vice-versa.

748
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:28,444
长官？
Chief?

749
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,281
小心露水！
Careful with that dew!

750
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,534
长官！
Chief!

751
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,497
黎明时分的土丘很美 不是吗？
A knoll is beautiful at dawn, isn't it?

752
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,062
抱歉 我必须这么做
Pardon me, I have to do this.

753

您一直是我的良师益友 洛兹扬斯基
You were always my mentor, Rozynski

754
01:07:09,694 --> 01:07:12,196
您非常了解线人
with your knowledge about informants,

755
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:17,451
他们的用处
about their usefulness,

756
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,413
游戏规则
the rules of the game

757
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:25,501
还有您一直说的灰色地带
and its twilight zones as you kept saying.

758
01:07:34,135 --> 01:07:36,345
我得给您读最后一次

看看这些基佬！

760

761
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:05,166
我要走了！
I'm out of here!

762
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:26,228
你一定是莎莉
You must be Sally.

763
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:28,731
埃丝特提醒我
Esther warned me

764
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:32,068
你就像一只迷路的大獾
that you keep appearing out of the blue

765
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:35,154
在暗中偷窥 冷不防冒出来
like a big snooping badger that lost its way.

766
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:41,869
你一定手痒想试试 对吧？
You must be itching to try this, right?

767
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,584
你想给我擦药吗？
You want to patch me up?

768
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:50,002
对
Yes.

769
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:53,631
埃丝特也受伤了吗？
Is Esther hurt too?

770
01:08:55,716 --> 01:08:57,134
你该问她
You should ask her.

771
01:08:57,927 --> 01:09:00,596
我得走了 我要赶火车
I leave you to it, I have a train to catch.

772
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:12,108
你的腿！
Your leg!

773
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:16,987
我们必须做些什么 必须有人照看他的腿
We have to do something. His leg must be looked after.

774
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:19,949
我可以
I can do it.

775
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:23,035
我有红药水
I've got mercurochrome.

776
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:34,588

- 死在哪里？ - 死在土丘上！
- Died where? - On the knoll!

778
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,891
跟法瑞德・贝纳马同个地方 对极了！ 
Same place as Farid Benamar. Spot on!

779
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:50,104
不会伤得太重吗？
Doesn't it hurt too much?

780
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:53,774
我老公又不打拳击 他拉小提琴
My husband is no boxer, he plays the violin.

781
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:57,528
警局所有人都会看到你这副模样
The entire precinct will be there

782
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:01,073
这不利于我们的调查
seeing you like this, can't be good for our investigation.

783
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,827
他们有更重要的事要办
They have bigger fish to fry.

784

他们的主要问题是洛兹扬斯基

Crap, they must have gone over everything!

787
01:10:18,883 --> 01:10:21,969
现在让我一个人待会 莎莉 我需要思考
Now leave me alone, Sally, I need to think.

788
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:36,377
我梦见了杰拉德 开心是开心就是太短暂
I dreamt of Gérald. It was pleasant but too short.

789
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,129
好啦
Let's

790
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:07,491
- 自杀？ - 没错！

如果让我发现这是你们俩的错！
If I find out this is your fault!

794
01:12:22,673 --> 01:12:25,801
拉法吉专员 你疯了吗
Commissioner Lafarge, you are out of your mind.

795
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:46,363
别那样瞪着我 门德斯 我会痊愈的
Don't stare at me like that, Mendes, I'll recover.

796
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:49,825
你 也许吧 可他不会！
You, maybe, but he won't!

797
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:56,290
你对洛兹扬斯基干了什么？
What did you do to Rozynski?

798
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:08,302
看开点亲爱的 你让我很尴尬
Move over dear, you're embarrassing me.

799
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:21,357
在女人堆里见面是不是好多了？
Isn't it nice to meet among women?

800

进来帮我

当然了 充满爱的婚姻 就跟你的一样 维吉妮
Of course I did. A marriage of love, just like yours, Virginie.

804
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,315
法瑞德死前在调查您的案子
Farid was working your case before he died.

805
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:05,859
那两个女警察告诉我的
The two police-women told me.

806
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:10,406
法瑞德不是在调查 我会说他是在告密
Farid was not working, I'd say he was snitching.

807
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:13,700
我是在给别人办事可我没有告密
I, for one, am working but I'm not snitching.

808
01:14:15,744 --> 01:14:18,205
你跟他的死有关系吗 拉齐达？
Were you involved in his death, Rachida?

809
01:14:18,831 --> 01:14:20,416
你真可耻！
Shame on you!

810
01:14:35,848 --> 01:14:36,849
打扰一下？
Excuse me?

811
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:45,941
你不知道你在跟谁打交道 维吉妮
You have no idea who you're dealing with, Virginie.

812
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:48,735
可怜的奥雷利安
Poor Aurélien.

813
01:14:51,572 --> 01:14:53,157
系好安全带

954
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:50,326
但杰拉德还活着

955
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:55,081
有个活着的老公是不是很美好？

956
01:28:56,708 --> 01:28:58,751
你想要那张照片？拿去吧！
You want the photo? Take it!

957
01:28:59,502 --> 01:29:02,422
一个活着或是死了的老婆比一张照片更重要
A wife, alive or dead, is more important than a photo.

958
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:07,176
我问自己
I asked myself...

959
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:11,681
你为什么可能需要钱？
why you would possibly need money?

960
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:13,933
于是我到处打听
So I asked around.

961
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:20,023
你老婆是个赌徒
Your wife was a gambler.

962
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:24,152
她嗜赌如命 跟莎莉一样
She was a compulsive gambler as Sally would put it.

963
01:29:25,862 --> 01:29:27,905
她为什么那么喜欢赌博？
Why did she gamble that much?

964
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:32,535
她当然欠了一屁股债
She certainly accumulated a huge debt.

965
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:35,455
你却并不苦恼
And you are not even upset.

966
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,999
团结一致到痛苦结局
Solidarity to the bitter end.

967
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:42,170
就跟维吉妮一样 就跟我和我老公一样
Just like Virginie, just like me and my husband.

968
01:29:43,755 --> 01:29:45,840
- 我喜欢 - 我也喜欢
- I love it. - I love it too.

969
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:52,638
你很走运 我没有任何你的把柄
You're lucky, I've got nothing on you.

970
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:55,016
我猜我很幸运
I guess I'm lucky then.

971
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:56,517
你认识贝卡森吗？
You know Belkacem?

972
01:29:57,101 --> 01:29:58,144
不认识
No.

973
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:09,530
- 喝啤酒还是喝茶？ - 没时间了
- Want a beer or a tea? - There's no time.

974
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:12,325
走吧
Let's

975
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:14,994
是时候了
It's about time.

976
01:30:18,873 --> 01:30:19,999
就这样？
Is that all?

977
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,002
法瑞德・贝纳马的阿尔及利亚身份证？
Farid Benamar's Algerian police I.D.?

978
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:24,796
我想这够多了
I think it's a lot.

979
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:28,341
谁看见我在土丘上？
Who saw me on that knoll?

980
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,177
纳达尔
Nadal

981
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:35,139
- 我以为你不会告诉我 - 我信任你
- I didn't think you would tell me. - I trust you.

982
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,729
维耶纳夫没有太多女人
There aren't too many women in Villeneuve.

983
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,357
你想说什么　门德斯？
What are you on about, Mendes?

984
01:30:45,024 --> 01:30:47,026
- 你知道我在想什么吗？－不知道
- You know what I'm thinking? - No.

985
01:30:49,946 --> 01:30:52,365
我们可以一起去巴黎　不去吗？
We could go to Paris together, no?

986
01:30:54,742 --> 01:30:58,413
我梦想着巴黎　只为等到对的人
I dream of Paris. Just waited for the right person.

987
01:30:58,663 --> 01:31:00,581
我听说巴黎是个美丽的城市

- Before you, I was afraid. - Of what?

991
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:20,184
在堕落中沉溺
Of drowning in decadence.

992
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:27,191
你看上去像尤尼斯的狗
You look like Younés's dog.

993
01:31:31,028 --> 01:31:32,321
减速！
Slow down!

994
01:31:34,949 --> 01:31:38,161
我有个主意 门德斯 贝卡森会露出马脚
I have an idea, Mendes. Belkacem will freak out.

995
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:39,996
我听着
I'm listening.

996
01:31:41,289 --> 01:31:43,916
别光想着法瑞德的身份证
Imagine rather than Farid's police I.D.

997
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:46,669
在洛兹扬斯基口袋里有封信
there was a letter in Rozynski's pocket.

998
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:49,088
- 一封写着所有事的信 - 噢对啊！
- A letter telling it all. - Oh yes!

999
01:32:08,274 --> 01:32:09,775
去找你妈！
Go to your mother!

1000
01:32:10,485 --> 01:32:12,028
这巴掌是为电视报道！
This is for the TV report!

1001
01:32:12,236 --> 01:32:15,072
观众喜欢看 内政部搞砸了
Audiences loved it. Internal Affairs screwing up,

1002
01:32:15,281 --> 01:32:17,074

你去见拉齐达・贝卡森
You go see Rachida Belkacem...

1005
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:24,624
把你在土丘见到的全都告诉她
and tell her exactly what you saw on that knoll

1006
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:26,709
我跟洛兹扬斯基之间的事 马上！

告诉她我觉得你变成了基佬？
Tell her I thought you turned queer?

你在吗 穆罕默德？
Are you there, Mohammed?

1011
01:32:47,688 --> 01:32:48,814
噢  是你啊？
Oh, it's you?

1012
01:33:55,756 --> 01:33:57,633
二号电话亭能用吗？
Is booth number 2 free?

1013
01:33:57,842 --> 01:33:59,135
能用 你去吧
Yes, go ahead.

1014
01:34:08,394 --> 01:34:09,854
喂 阿尔及利亚吗？

1015
01:34:10,187 --> 01:34:12,982
抱歉 伙计 这电话打不通！
Excuse me, brother, the phone doesn't work!

1016
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:17,612
你能帮我吗？
Can you help me?

1017
01:34:21,741 --> 01:34:24,368
我试图找到我在阿尔及利亚的家人
I am trying to get a hold of my family in Algeria.

1018
01:34:24,619 --> 01:34:27,830
暴动爆发后我就再没有他们的消息
I haven't heard from them since the riots broke out.

1019
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,750
警察打了他们 然后把他们逮捕了
The police hit them, then they arrested them.

1020
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,544
他们把他们关进了牢里
They took them to the jail.

1021
01:34:34,754 --> 01:34:36,797
请帮帮我！
Help me please!

1022
01:34:37,006 --> 01:34:39,425
我必须跟我家人说话
I must speak to my family.

1023
01:34:39,634 --> 01:34:40,885
请帮帮我！
Help me please!

1024
01:34:59,862 --> 01:35:01,322
愿主保佑你！
May God bless you!

1025
01:35:09,288 --> 01:35:10,289
喂 阿尔及利亚吗？
Hello, Algeria?

1026
01:35:13,084 --> 01:35:15,628
我们开始我们的维耶纳夫之旅 欢迎大家！
We're starting our tour of Villeneuve, welcome!

1027
01:35:15,878 --> 01:35:18,839
那么维耶纳夫的郊区是何时发展的呢？
So when was the urban area of Villeneuve developed?

1028
01:35:19,048 --> 01:35:21,884
这些建筑建于1975年
The pavilions were built in 1975,

1029
01:35:22,093 --> 01:35:24,720
就在那时发展开始扩大
that's when the development started to expand.

1030
01:35:25,012 --> 01:35:27,223
考虑到背景
To put all this in context...

1031
01:35:27,431 --> 01:35:30,768
真不知道他们在郊区还有旅游大巴
No idea they had tour buses in the suburbs.

1032
01:35:32,395 --> 01:35:34,021
你还是那么帅
You're as beautiful as ever.

1033
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:37,149
我来这里是为了帮你 不是听你恭维我
I'm here to help you, not to listen to compliments.

1034
01:35:38,651 --> 01:35:41,946
在你们右边 可以看见一条无害的小街
On your right, you see a harmless little street

1035
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:45,783
不是那幢建筑
were it not for a building where a well known local lady

1036
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,285
三天前一位著名的本地女士被发现暗杀在那里
was found assassinated three days ago.

1037
01:35:49,245 --> 01:35:52,415
许多公寓在有限的土地上建造起来
Many flats built on limited building ground...

1038
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:53,874
莎莉
Sally,

1039
01:35:55,126 --> 01:35:58,003
我们复职了 我们继续调查
we have been reinstated. We go on investigating.

1040
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:02,216
没错 案子变得太大了
Yes, the case is getting too big.

1041
01:36:02,425 --> 01:36:04,927
杀贝卡森的人帮了我们个忙
Whoever killed Belkacem did us a favour.

1042
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,180
我知道你在想维吉妮
I know you're thinking of Virginie.

1043
01:36:08,389 --> 01:36:10,307
两条长椅 小花园
Two benches, tiny garden

1044
01:36:10,808 --> 01:36:13,060
保存了土丘的完整性
to preserve the integrity of the knoll.

1045
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:19,400
革命性的想法是尽可能保留自然形态
The revolutionary idea was leaving nature as intact as possible.

1046
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:23,821
我们真的了解维吉妮吗？我是指她对法瑞德的爱？
Did we really understand Virginie? I mean her love for Farid?

1047
01:36:24,905 --> 01:36:26,657
我们没想过
We didn't see it coming.

1048
01:36:26,866 --> 01:36:28,576
我遗漏了要点
I missed the essential.

1049
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:30,589
亲近自然
...close to nature. The

1050
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:34,123
公寓有面向土丘的阳台
apartments have balconies facing the knoll...

1051
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:35,583
没错 没错 埃丝特！
Yes, yes, Esther!

1052
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:40,087
尽管有着革命性的自然外观 我还是要说
Despite this revolutionary natural aspect, I insist,

1053
01:36:40,296 --> 01:36:43,299
土丘上发生了可怕的事情
two gruesome discoveries on the knoll.

1054
01:36:43,507 --> 01:36:48,053
两个人被发现暗杀在土丘顶上同一个地方
Two men were found assassinated in the same spot on top of it.

1055
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:51,056
对贝纳马的死负责的人
The people responsible for Benamar's death.

1056
01:36:52,975 --> 01:36:55,060
我们要把他们拿下 我们俩
We'll put them away, us two.

1057
01:36:56,103 --> 01:36:56,771
我需要你
I need you.

1058
01:36:57,104 --> 01:36:58,856
城市家具被扔在斜坡上
...urban furniture thrown on the slope...

1059
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:00,024
多谢 埃丝特
Thank you, Esther.

1060
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:04,320
斜坡上的沙坑 斜坡上的秋千
Sandbox on the slope, swing on the slope.

1061
01:37:04,528 --> 01:37:06,530
我坚持用这个词 斜坡
I insist on the word slope.

1062
01:37:20,294 --> 01:37:22,838
有水的地方就有动物
Where there is water, there are animals.

1063
01:37:23,047 --> 01:37:25,966
如果我们仔细聆听仔细观察
If we listen and observe carefully,

1064
01:37:26,175 --> 01:37:28,219
我们就能在湖滩看见
we will spot on the lake beach

1065
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:29,762
各种各样的鹅类
a wide variety of geese:

1066

埃及雁 加拿大黑雁

01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:36,811
绿头鸭 赤颈鸭 还有天鹅与黑水鸡
Anas Platyrhynchos, Anas Penelope, also swans and common moorhens.

1068
01:37:38,062 --> 01:37:40,147
这些鸟是如何来到维耶纳夫呢？
How did these birds get to Villeneuve?

1069
01:37:40,815 --> 01:37:41,982
答案很简单
Simple answer.

1070
01:37:42,191 --> 01:37:44,026
湖水倒映出天空
As birds tend to fly

1071
01:37:44,235 --> 01:37:49,198
随着鸟儿飞翔它们马上就能发现湖在哪
they immediately spot lakes as the sky reflects in them.

1072
01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:51,659
就像这里的湖边海滩
Just like here at the lake beach.

1073
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:01,502
喂 埃丝特 我是罗伯特・门德斯

我给你留条信息
I'm calling to leave a message.

1075
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:11,846
我意识到我们总是不能面对面见到
I realise we didn't always see eye to eye

1076
01:38:12,054 --> 01:38:15,057
我们的合作不总是   阿卜杜拉！
（伊斯兰教先知默罕默德之父）
our collaboration hasn't always been... Abdullah!

1077
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:21,355
我想说的是我们这里真的需要你 请给我回电
What I'm saying is we really need you here. Please call me back.

1078
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:29,738
展开你的笑容
Widen your cheeks.

1079
01:38:30,614 --> 01:38:33,075
你应该说 擦掉你的眼泪
You should say: Wipe off your tears!

1080
01:38:35,452 --> 01:38:37,079
别那么
Don't be pretty'.!

1081
01:38:37,663 --> 01:38:40,374
你是说别那么悲伤麽
Not pretty, you mean sad!

1082
01:38:47,339 --> 01:38:49,341
我想知道他会在哪？
I wonder where he could be?

1083

Is that bloody violinist with you, Sally?
