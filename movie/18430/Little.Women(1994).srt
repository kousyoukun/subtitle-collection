1
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,220
我和姐妹们都记得...
My sisters and I remember that winter...

2
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,640
童年里最冷的一年冬天
as the coldest of our childhood.

3
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,030
几年前我们家就遭遇了暂时性的经济拮据
A temporary poverty had settled upon our family some years before.

4
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,100
（康柯德市 马萨诸塞州）

5
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,050
内战导致燃料和灯油短缺
The war had made fuel and lamp oil scarce.

6
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,240
但是外在的需求总能孕育出内在的创造力
But necessity is indeed the mother of invention.

7
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,490
因此就在这么个黑暗时期...我们家 马屈家
Somehow in that dark time...our family, the March family,

8
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,860
不知不觉创造了属于自己的光明
seemed to create its own light.

9
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,200
妈咪！妈咪到家了！
Marmee! Marmee's home!

10
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,210
妈咪!妈咪!妈咪!
Marmee! Marmee!Marmee!

11
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,750
我们等了又等！
We waited and waited!

12
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,880
我们“期等”你几个钟头了
We've been "expectorating" you for hours!

13
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,940
有吗 亲爱的？
Have you, my darling?

14
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,960
该说“期待” 你个草包
" Expecting," featherhead.

15
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,000
噢 妈咪 你都快冻坏了！
Oh, Marmee, you're frozen!

16
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,490
是的
Yes.

17
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,220
你如果看到这个冷天里 在希望之家外面排队的人就知道了
If you could see the people lined up outside Hope House in this bitter cold.

18
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,420
唔 你的脸颊特别暖和
Mmm, your cheeks are so warm.

19
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,490
谢谢 小蟋蟀
Thank you, cricket.

20
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,760
你做好圣诞济贫小包了吗？
Have you finished your Christmas bundles?

21
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,570
-今年做了好多! 我们还送了… -哦 你的感冒怎么样了？
-So many this year! We were handing out… - Oh, how was your cold?

22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,110
-好多了 -那就好
- Better. -That's good.

23
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,580
我们送食物的速度...就跟做篮子的速度一样快
We were handing out food...as quickly as we could make up the baskets.

24
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,810
艾米小姐 知道我口袋里有什么吗？
Now, Miss Amy, what is this in my pocket?

25
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,680
是爸爸的信！
Father!

26
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,570
“我最亲爱的家人
" My dearest family,

27
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,630
我目前安然无恙
I am well and safe.

28
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,030
我们驻札在‘波特莫克’”
Our battalion is encamped on the 'Potamac'."

29
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,440
是“波特摩克”
Potomac.

30
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,440
“对远离家乡的我们而言 十二月是个寒冷的季节
" December makes a hard, cold season for all of us so far from home.

31
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,380
我日夜思念着我的女儿们…
I think of my girls day and night...

32
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,320
对你们的爱是我最好的慰藉
and find my best comfort in your affection.

33
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,050
我祈祷你们的艰困不至于大到无法承受
I pray that your own hardships will not be too great to bear.

34
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,190
给她们我的爱和我的吻
Give them all my dear love and a kiss.

35
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,590
告诉她们我白天思念她们
Tell them I think of them by day,

36
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,000
晚上为她们祈祷
pray for them by night."

37
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,400
可怜的父亲
Poor Father.

38
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,070
我真是个自私的女孩
I'm a selfish girl.

39
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,410
哦！小不点
Oh! Little ones.

40
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,550
这是圣诞夜 爸爸不会希望我们难过的
It's Christmas Eve. Father wouldn't want us to be sad now.

汉娜完成了一个圣诞奇迹
Hannah's put together an absolute Christmas miracle.

75
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,240
那是香肠吗？

76
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,520
等等！
Wait!

77

奶油
Butter

78

哦, 奶油!哦 哦 这就是奶油的“神性”吗？
Oh, butter! Oh, oh, isn't butter "divinity"?

79
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,730
哦 主 感谢你赐予这顿早餐
Oh, God, thank you for this breakfast.

80
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,000
乔 小天使 去叫你妈咪
Jo, angel, fetch your Marmee.

81
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,200
她天没亮就去见那几个德国人了
She went out at the crack of dawn to see some Germans.

82
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,270
是汉默家 他家的那个男孩一句英文都不会说
Hummel, the boy said not a word of English.

83
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,010
他爸爸去世了
His da's gone.

84
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,280
已经有六个孩子 他的妈妈又要生了
Six children, and she's 'bout to issue another.

85
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,400
可以送些柴火过去 我敢肯定他们没有柴火
May as well take 'em a stick of firewood. Sure they haven't got any.

86
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,220
甚至早餐都没有
Or breakfast either.

87
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,100
也许我们可以把我们的面包送给汉默他们
Perhaps we could send the Hummels our bread.

88
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,970
奶油也一并送去吧 奶油用不着了...因为没有面包来涂
Might as well send the butter too. Butter's not much use...without bread to put it on.

89
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,330
哦 好美的雪！
Oh, wonderful snow!

90
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,330
你是不是想像狗一样在雪上打滚呢？
Don't you wish you could roll about in it like dogs?

91
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,740

Jo, you should let them speak first. What will they think of us?

95
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,300
噢 别回头！
Oh, don't look back!

96

我们在嫩绿的树林间举杯同欢
Here we come a-wassailing among the leaves so green

97
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,110
我们在如此美好的天气四处游荡
And here we come a-wandering so fair as to be seen

98
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,920
愿爱与喜悦降临你

105

波琳看见新郎的面罩掉了下来 吓得大叫起来...
Pauline cried out in horror as her bridegroom's mask fell...

106
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,170
那人并非她的爱人佛迪南...
disclosing not her lover Ferdinand...

107
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,100
却是他的死敌 安东尼伯爵
but the face of his sworn enemy, Count Antonio.

108
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,780

112
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,980
You ought to publish it, Jo. Really! Not just in the Pickwick Portfolio.
你应该出版它 乔 真的！而不是只登在我们的皮威克报上
（皮威克报，原著中乔自办的家庭报纸）

113
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,010
塔普曼先生 你是在贬低我们这么好的报刊吗？
Mr. Tupman, are you demeaning our fine newspaper?

114
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,150
“小长春... ”这是广告
"One periwink..." Advertisement.

115
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,680
“一条属于小长春先生的小长春花腰带...
"One periwinkle sash belonging to Mr. N. Winkle...

116
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,020

has been 'abscondated' from the wash line...

117

出版社的先生们 听着 听着！请关注...
Gentlemen of the press, hear, hear! I call to your attention...

119
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,240

120
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,300
哦 别念我写的故事
Oh, don't read mine.

121
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,780
贝丝 你这不是故事 这就是个食谱
Beth, this isn't a story. It's a recipe.

122
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,120
噢 亲爱的 我一直都不知道该写什么
Oh, dear, I never know what to write.

123
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,920
写作的首要原则 塔普曼先生
First rule of writing, Mr. Tupman,

124
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,460
不要写你了解的事
is never write what you know.

125
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,260
我们觉得那男孩如何？
What do we think of the boy?

126
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,200
他像不像《尼古拉斯·尼克贝》里的斯密？
（《尼古拉斯·尼克贝》，狄更斯小说）
Is he a captive like Smee in Nicholas Nickleby?

127
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,670
他看起来很孤单
He looks lonely.

128
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,670
你想他会不会来访？
You don't think he'll try to call?

129
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,880
也许他有啥秘密...
Maybe he has a secret...

130
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,410
悲剧的 欧洲式的秘密
tragic, European secret.

131
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:38,220
他们说 他根本没有受过教育 他在意大利的艺术家和流浪汉中长大
He's had no upbringing at all, they say. He was reared in Italy among artists and vagrants.

132
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,150
他不是有个看着特高贵的额头吗？
Doesn't he have a noble brow?

133
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,220
如果我是个男孩子 我就想长成那样
If I were a boy, I'd want to look just like that.

134
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,290
想想看 放弃我书里的意大利 却和那糟老头住的感觉！
Imagine giving up Italy to come live with that awful old man!

135
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,960
乔 别说“糟老头” 那是粗话
Jo, please don't say awful. It's slang.

136
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,630
和他住我一定会吓坏
I'd be terrified to live with him.

137
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,840
我倒不介意住这么大房子 还有这么好的东西
I shouldn't mind living in such a fine house and having nice things.

138
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,710
喔 没有礼物就不像圣诞节
Oh, it doesn't seen like Christmas this year without presents.

139
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,960
我十分渴望拥有画笔
I'm desperate for drawing pencils.

140
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,030
我希望不必为马屈姑婆...那个乖戾的守财奴工作
I wish I didn't have to work for Great-Aunt March...that crabby old miser.

141
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,900
你呢 贝丝？你的圣诞愿望是什么？
And you, Beth. What's your Christmas wish?

142
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,440
我想要战争结束 这样爸爸就能回家了
I'd like the war to end so Father can come home.

143
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,770
哦 好贝丝
Oh, sweet Beth.

144
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,850
我们都想要这样
We all want that.

145
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,340
他们家有一架漂亮的钢琴
They do have a beautiful piano.

146
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,980
等我成为作家 我就给你买架上帝创世以来最好的钢琴
Wait 'til I'm a writer. I'll buy you the best piano in creation.

147
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,620
如果她没给你买 你可以来我这弹我的
And if she doesn't, you can come over and play mine.

148
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,100
当我结婚时 我要变得非常富有
When I marry, I'm going to be disgustingly rich.

149
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,790
那如果你爱的男人是个穷人但人很好 就像爸爸一样呢？
And what if the man you love is a poor man but good, like Father?

150
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,010
这个嘛 爱不像长着一个难看的鼻子那样别无选择
Well, it isn't like being stuck with the dreadful nose you get.

151
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,810
一个人可以选择要爱谁
One does have a choice to whom one loves.

152
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,180
你的鼻子天生就很可爱！
You have a lovely nose!

153
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,440
我不会为钱而结婚
I wouldn't marry for the money.

154
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,550
我的意思是 万一他事业失败呢？
I mean, what if his business goes bust?

155
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,960
并且 在鹰报 他们给每则刊登的故事支付五美元
Besides, down at the Eagle, they pay $5 for each story they print.

156
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,660
这个嘛 现在我脑中就有十个故事！
Well, I have ten stories in my head right now!

157
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,460
各位先生
Gentlemen,

158
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,330
我不爱谈钱
I dislike all this money talk.

159
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,930
这不高雅
It isn't refined.

160
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,540
如果不注意个人财务是高雅的标志...
If lack of attention to personal finances is a mark of refinement...

161
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,880
那我敢说我们马屈家是这里最高贵的家庭了
then I'd say the Marches are the most elegant family in Concord.

162
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,810
我们都会长大的 梅格
We'll all grow up someday, Meg.

163
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,280
我们该想清楚自己要什么
We might as well know what we want.

164
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,390
可以了
That'll do.

165
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,560
把马车拉开 动作麻利点
Put the carriage away, and look smart about it.

166
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,690
好的 先生
Very good, sir.

167
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,730
圣诞快乐！
Merry Christmas!

168
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,400
我对今晚的感觉很棒
I have the most wonderful feeling about tonight.

169
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,910
梅格和乔 你们得告诉我...所有关于贝尔·嘉丁纳的“精致”事
Meg and Jo, you have to tell me..."exquisitely" everything about Belle Gardiner.

170
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,470
她鼻子和她的戒指长啥样 安妮·嘉丁纳说她的戒指是颗祖母绿
What her nose looks like and about her ring. Annie Gardiner says it's an emerald.

171
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,990
你能想象吗？除了我 大家都很幸运
Can you imagine? Everyone's lucky but me.

172
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,820
真高兴我不必去 不用和那些可怕的人一起...
I'm glad I don't have to go and be with those frightening people...

173
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,890
也不用试着找话来聊
and try to think of things to say.

174
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,790
嘘
Hush now.

175
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,730
噢 注意点 乔...
Oh, mind you, Jo...

176
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,130
晚餐别吃太多...还有不要和人握手 没别的了
don't eat much at supper... and don't shake hands with people. It isn't the thing anymore.

177
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,300
乔 你的裙子！
Jo, your dress!

178
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,670
噢 我知道！
Oh, I know!

179
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,380
你老是站的离炉火太近
You always stand too close to the fire.

180
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,610
噢 亲爱的 这个 只要背靠着墙别让人看见就行
Oh, dear. Well, just keep your backside to the wall.

181
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,180
梅格 看 多可爱的小鞋跟
Meg, look. What cunning little heels.

182
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,610
它们太小了
They're rather small.

183
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,590
没关系 只穿一晚而已
That's all right. It's only for one night.

184
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,560
你觉得会有人注意到...它们是拿碎布袋做的吗？
You don't suppose anyone will notice... they came out of the rag bag, do you?

185
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,160
啊...呃 你必须得有鞋跟
Uh-uh. You have to have heels.

186
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,370
这是什么怪味道？
What's that strange smell?

187
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,940
像是烧焦的羽毛
Like burnt feathers.

188
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,980
天啊！
Heavens above!

189
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,750
你毁了我！
You've ruined me!

190
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,920
对不起！对不起 你就不该让我弄头发！
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. You shouldn't have had me do it!

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,520
-你把一切都毁了 –梅格 别担心 很快会长回来的
-You spoil everything. -Meg, don't worry. It'll come out soon.

192
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,860
我不能就这样出去！
I can't go out like this!

193
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,840
好吧！那我也不去了
Good! I'm not going either.

194
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,340
来 我们把蝴蝶结放前面
Here, we'll place my bow in front.

195
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,900
好极了 遮住了
Yes, that covers it.

196
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,980
它很配呀
It's very becoming.

197
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,410
我再也不会有追求者们了
I'll never have any suitors.

198
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,690
我会变成一个风干的老姑娘
I'll just be a dried-up old spinster.

199
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,690
你不需要许多的追求者 你只需要一个
You don't need scores of suitors. You only need one,

200
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,890
前提是他就是那个对的人
if he's the right one.

201
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,000
听听这孩子说的
Listen to the child.

202
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,460
梅格不打算马上结婚 对吧？
Meg isn't going to be married right away, is she?

203
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,790
有了乔的帮忙 我再也嫁不出去了
With Jo's help, I never will.

204
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,840
你一定非常快乐
You must be so happy.

205
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,670
哦 贝尔 你真迷人
Oh, Belle, it's enchanting.

206
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,090
这个 我最好去帮一下我妈 原谅我
Well, I best go help Mama. Excuse me.

207
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,980
天呀！对不起
Jehoshaphat! I'm sorry.

208
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,050
不 不 留下！
No, no, stay!

209
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,960
这是个不错的藏匿处
It's not a bad hiding place.

210
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,430
你看 我不认识任何人...所以我觉得站在那盯着人看好尴尬
You see, I don't know anyone... so I feel awkward standing and staring at people.

211
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,670
我应该穿上我的外套吗？我不懂这些规矩
Should I put on my jacket? I never know the rules.

212
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,510
呃 嗯 我是罗利
Um, um, I'm Laurie.

213
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,680
西奥多·罗伦斯 不过
Theodore Laurence, but

214
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,180
我是 呃 大家都叫我罗利
I'm, uh, I'm called Laurie.

215
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,440
乔.马屈 嗯...
Jo March. Um...

216
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,120
那 你在盯着谁看？
So, who were you staring at?

217
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,820
呃 其实 是你 你在玩什么游戏吗？
Uh, you, actually. What... what game were you playing?

218
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,720
我不知道 不过我想我赢了
I don't know, but I think I won.

219
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,390
你还盯着谁在看？
Who else?

220
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,100
这个 我对...
Well, I was...

221
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,610
我对那个人很感兴趣
I was quite taken with that one.

222
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,110
那是梅格
That's Meg.

223
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,380
那是我姐姐
That's my sister.

224
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,620
她的前额全都秃了
She's completely bald in front.

225
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,990
是真的吗 你和艺术家，游民一起生活在意大利？
Is it true that you lived in Italy among artists and vagrants?

226
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,940
我母亲是意大利人
My mother was Italian.

227
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,100
一个 呃 钢琴家
A, uh, pianist.

228
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,870
但爷爷不喜欢她
Grandfather disapproved of her.

229
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,970
真的？我看过类似的剧本 你喜欢戏剧吗？
Truly? I saw a play like that once. Do you like the theater?

230
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,080
哦 是的
Oh, yes.

231
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,550
你在那里出生的吗？
Were you born there?

232
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,610
那里？在...
Where? In...

233
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,550
在 呃 意大利
In, uh, Italy.

234
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,650
-你会说法文还是意大利文？ -在家说英语
- Do you speak French or Italian? - English at home.

235
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,890
在学校说法文 我上音乐学校（法语）
Francais a L 'ecole. The Music Conservatory in Vevey.

236
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,200
但现在爷爷给我请家教了
But Grandfather's having me tutored now.

237
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,240
他坚持让我念大学
He insists I go to college.

238
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,300
哦 只要能上大学 我甚至愿意去干谋杀
Oh, I'd commit murder to go to college.

239
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,780
事实上 我是要去欧洲
Actually, I'm going to Europe.

240
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,110
这个嘛 至少我希望我能去
Well, at least I hope I am.

241
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,820
我马屈姑婆说她总有一天会去...她得带我去
My Great-Aunt March says she'll go one of these days... and she has to take me with her

242
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:04,660
因为我可以做她的同伴 我得念好几个小时的书给她听
because I work as her companion. I have to read to her for hours and hours.

243
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,730
不过我会给所有的角色配音！
But I do all the voices!

244
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,130
我相信你会的
I'll bet you do.

245
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,900
如果我不是立志要成为一个作家...
If I weren't going to be a writer...

246
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,370
我就会去纽约外加从事舞台工作了
I'd go to New York and pursue the stage.

247
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,700
你惊着了吗？
Are you shocked?

248
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,980
很惊讶
Very.

249
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,060
对...对不起
I...I'm sorry.

250
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,340
对不起 不过梅格在家总要让我扮演男士的角色
I'm sorry. Meg always makes me take the gentleman's part at home.

251
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,920
只可惜你不了解女士的角色
It's a shame you don't know the lady's part.

252
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,890
你为啥要看我裙子的背面？
Why are you looking at the back of my dress?

253
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,050
它并不太难看！实话实说
It isn't so bad! Honestly.

254
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,220
你答应不看的
You promised you wouldn't look.

255
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,130
哦 乔 我扭伤了我的脚踝
Oh, Jo, I've sprained my ankle.

256
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,640
穿这样的鞋 是我的话就不会奇怪了！痛吗？
I shouldn't wonder in those shoes! Does it hurt?

257
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,070
哦 不 不 不 我很好 谢谢
Oh. Oh, no, no. I'm quite well, thank you.

258
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,180
哈 这是我们的邻居 罗利 那个俘虏
（乔在引用狄更斯小说中的角色）
Well, this is our neighbor, Laurie, the captive.

259
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,110
喔 可怜的梅格 我去跟嘉丁纳太太说
Oh, poor Meg. I'll go tell Mrs. Gardiner.

260
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,950
噢 别 乔 她会以为我喝了潘趣酒
（潘趣酒，一种源于印度的果汁鸡尾酒）
Oh, no, Jo. She'll think I've been sampling the punch.

261
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,520
这会把这么完美的派对给破坏的
A perfectly good party ruined.

262
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,750
我有马车 让我送你回家
I have my carriage. Let me take you home.

263
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,350
-哦 真好！ -不 谢谢
- Oh, yes! - Oh, no, thank you.

264
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,390
谢谢你
Thank you.

265
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,900
靠着我
Lean on me.

266
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,780
谢谢你 罗伦斯先生 你真是太好了
Thank you, Mr. Laurence. That's very kind of you.

267
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,510
不客气
Not at all.

268
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,150
-晚安 罗利 -晚安 马屈小姐
- Good-bye, Laurie. - Good night, Miss. March.

269
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,020
你这鞋哪儿来的？
Wherever did you get this shoe?

270
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,160
你们坐了他的马车？哦 你俩真是幸运
Did you ride in his carriage? Oh, you two have all the luck.

271
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,630
喔 乔 他很浪漫吗？
Oh, Jo, is he very romantic?

272
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,130
一点也不！
Not in the slightest!

273
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
我们很感谢他
We're very much obliged to him,

274
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,430
但他是个糟糕的男孩子
but he's a dreadful boy.

275
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,170
他做的很好 用雪敷在你的脚踝上
He did a good deed putting snow on this ankle.

276
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,300
他把雪敷在你脚踝上？
He put snow on your ankle?

277
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,350
睡觉去 艾米小姐
To bed, Miss Amy.

278
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,280
他亲手弄的？
With his own hands?

279
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,010
噢 别那么神魂颠倒的
Oh, stop being so swoony.

280
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,550
我可不希望我的女儿们对男孩子们做傻事 睡觉去
I won't have my girls being silly about boys. To bed,

281
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,790
乔 带她去
Jo, dear.

282
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,760
还痛吗？
Does this hurt?

283
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,290
所有好事都让梅格遇上了
Everything lovely happens to Meg.

284
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,730
哦 的确如此！
Oh, yes indeed!

285
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,870
你不可以像学校的笨女孩那样...对罗利感情用事
You mustn't be soppy about Laurie anymore than you should be soppy... about those silly girls at school.

286
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,710
我希望我们能和他成为好朋友
I hope we shall be good friends with him.

287
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,570
和一个男孩做朋友？
With a boy?

288
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,950
他不是男孩！他是罗利！
He isn't a boy! He's Laurie!

289
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,650
快点！
Faster!

290
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,790
快点！
Faster!

291
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,480
您的小姐们异常活跃 马屈太太 如果我可以这么说的话
Your young ladies are unusually active, Mrs. March, if I may say so.

292
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,780
你的确可以这么说 布鲁克先生
You may indeed, Mr. Brooke.

293
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,890
在我看来 年轻的女孩和男孩没有什么不同…他们需要努力运动
It is my opinion that young girls are no different than boys...in their need for exertion.

294
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,900
女性身体虚弱和易晕厥...
Feminine weakness and fainting spells are the direct result...

295
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,230
是我们限制年轻女孩子在家里穿着束腹 并且弯腰做针线活的直接结果
of our confining young girls to the house... bent over their needlework in restrictive corsets.

296
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,430
妈咪！
Marmee!

297
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,770
你的年轻学生是个运动员
Your young student is an athlete.

298
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,380
他 谢谢夸奖 是个好运动员
He is, thank you, a good one.

299
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,320
但是个不守规矩的学生
But he makes an unruly scholar.

300
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,820
我很遗憾他的祖父经常不在家
I regret that his grandfather is away much.

301
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,060
希望你的女儿们…能给他更温和的影响
One hopes that your girls...will be a gentling influence.

302
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,130
是呀 布鲁克先生
Indeed, Mr. Brooke.

303
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,200
妈咪 你非得跟所有人说束腹的事吗？
Marmee, must you speak to everyone about corsets?

304
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,410
哦 梅格 我有提吗？
Oh, Meg. Do I?

305
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,150
我靠 这些该死的裙子
Blast these wretched skirts!

306
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,300
别说我靠和该死
Don't say blast and wretch.

307
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,160
艾米 别那么傻
Amy, don't be such a ninny-pinny.

308
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,970
我希望我是贝丝 那样就能待在家里做些高兴事
I wish I was Beth so I could stay home and do pleasant things.

309
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,300
噢 如果你把洗衣服和做家事称作高兴事就行！
Oh, if you call doing laundry and housework pleasant!

310
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,940
我靠！
Blast!

311
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,580
艾米 快呀 我工作要迟到了
Amy, hurry. I'll be late for work.

312
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,050
金太太来了 我又迟到了
There's Mrs. King. I'm tardy again.

313
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,250
可爱的孩子
Lovely children.

314
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,320
噢 梅格 我必须去上学吗?我很“吴用”
Oh, Meg, must I go to school? I'm so "degradatated."

315
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,890
我简直无地自容 我还欠至少一打的莱姆果
（莱姆果，一种类似酸橙的水果，学生常用作货币）
I can hardly hold my head up. I owe at least a dozen limes.

316
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,100
-莱姆果？ -现在莱姆果很流行吗？
- Limes? - Are limes the fashion now?

317
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,940
当然 现在就莱姆果好用
Of course they are. It's nothing but limes now.

318
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,150
大家把莱姆果藏在桌子里 用它交换珠子和其他东西 然后课间所有女孩都拿它们互相款待
Everyone keeps them in their desks and trades them for beads and things. And all the girls treat each other in recess.

319
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,810
如果你不带莱姆果到学校 你就完了 你还不如死掉算了
If you don't bring limes to school, you're nothing. You might as well be dead.

320
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,930
我曾有很多莱姆果 而我现在一个也付不起了
I've had ever so many limes, and I can't pay anyone back.

321
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,900
难怪你在学校什么都学不到！
No wonder you don't learn anything at that school!

322
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,000
我知道没有一点小奢侈品的感受
I know how it feels to do without any little luxuries.

323
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,060
但我们并不是一贫如洗 至少目前还不是
But we are not destitute, not yet.

324
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,370
这有两毛五 妈咪这个月给了我零用钱
Here's a quarter. Marmee gave me the rag money this month.

325
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,710
去吧！
Go on!

326
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:12,400
“第二 灵魂的不朽被认为是由于它的非物质性...
"Secondly, the immortality of the soul is asserted to be in consequence of its immateriality...

327
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,690
就像在所有的宗教案例中一样...
as in all leipothymic cases...

328
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,570
与不朽...
consistent with the idea of immortality...

329
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:28,250
和非道德，以及肉体的观念相一致...”
and immorality, and physicality..."

330
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:34,360
而我想你终于睡着了
And I think you finally dozed off.

331
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,170
乔瑟芬 你有封信！
Josephine, there's a draft!

332
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,180
是爸爸的消息吗？
Is it Father?

333
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,280
老师打了我
Teacher struck me.

334
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,250
他把莱姆果丢到雪地里
He put the limes out into the snow.

335
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,040
玫·切斯特说我的莱姆果烂透了 一定曾捐给希望之家
May Chester said my limes must have been donated to Hope House.

336
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,770
然后我说她休想从我这儿再拿到一个莱姆果
Then I said that she wouldn't get a single lime from me.

337
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,720
然后她告诉老师戴维斯先生 莱姆果藏在我桌子里 然后他就打了我
And then she told Mr. Davis they were hidden in my desk...and then he struck me.

338
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,050
我们应该过去用他的棍子把他的肥油打出来!
We oughta go over there and beat the tar out of him with his own stick!

339
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,990
乔 我们不接受暴力
Jo, we must not embrace violence.

340
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,690
我会写封信给他
I'll write this man a letter.

341
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,530
-写信？ -那会让他明白他错了
- A letter? - That'll show him.

342
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,440
你没告诉我莱姆果是被学校禁止带的 那可是整整一个月的零用钱啊?
You failed to mention to me they were forbidden. A whole month's rag money?

343
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,010
艾米 我不该拿钱给你的
Amy, I shouldn't have given it to you.

344
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,440
对不起！
I'm sorry!

345
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,140
那些可爱的莱姆果呀 我完全“荒凉”了
（年幼的艾米不会用词）
All those lovely limes. I'm perfectly "desolated."

346
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,880
你失去莱姆果算不了什么
I'm not sorry you lost them.

347
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,010
这时候它是一个无关紧要的事
It's a frivolous concern in times like these.

348
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,050
你更想重塑你亲爱的小鼻子…而不是塑造你的性格
You are more intent upon reshaping your dear little nose...than in fashioning your character.

349
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,020
那是所可怕的学校！难怪你拼字那么糟...你的拉丁语那么荒谬
It's an appalling school. Your spelling's atrocious... your Latin absurd.

350
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,860
戴维斯先生说了 教育女人...和训练母猫一样有用
Mr. Davis said it was as useful to educate a woman... as to educate a female cat.

351
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,260
我要勒死戴维斯先生！
I shall strangle Mr. Davis!

352
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,500
“致戴维斯先生...
" Mr. Davis...

353
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,470
你有什么权利打一个孩子？
what right have you to strike a child?

354
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,810
在上帝的眼中 我们都是孩子 我们都是平等的
In God's eyes we are all children and we are all equals.

355
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,910
如果你殴打和羞辱一个孩子
If you hit and humiliate a child,

356
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,110
那么她唯一学到的教训是...就是打骂和羞辱"
the only lesson she will learn...is to hit and humiliate."

357
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,080
艾米 你觉得你能约束自己...像贝丝那样在家里学习吗?
Amy, do you think you can discipline yourself... to learn at home as Beth has done?

358
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,390
“我要我女儿艾米从你学校退学”
"I withdraw my daughter Amy from your school."

359
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,220
这坏蛋活该!
It serves the scoundrel right!

360
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,600
乔现在会监督你的教育工作
Jo will now supervise your education.

361
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,340
乔 告诉我接下来的故事发生了什么...
Jo, tell me what happens next...

362
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,050
在公爵抛弃家产 拯救礼拉夫人之后
after the Duke turns his back on his family fortune and saves Lady Zara.

363
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,050
不知道 全是谋杀和打斗
Don't know. It's all murder and gore.

364
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,850
-那少女身陷危难 -我喜欢你的少女身陷危难
-The damsel's in distress. -Oh, I love your damsels in distress.

365
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,220
哦 贝丝 说真的
Oh, Beth, truly,

366
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,420
我不知道我能否像妈咪那么善良
I don't know if I could ever be good like Marmee.

367
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,400
我宁愿使用暴力
I rather crave violence.

368
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,000
要是我能像爸爸一样...
If only I could be like Father...

369
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,340
去打仗 站起来反抗不公正的世界
and go to war and stand up to the lions of injustice.

370
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,210
妈咪也是如此 只是用她自己的方式而已
And so Marmee does in her own way.

371
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,910
是的
Yes.

372
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,520
但我想做点不同的事情！
But I want to do something different!

373
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,520
我还不知道是什么 不过我正在找
I don't know what it is yet, but I'm on the watch for it.

374
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,050
你会找到的 乔
You will find it, Jo.

375
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,630
哈啰！乔！过来这里
Hello! Jo! Come over here.

376
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,860
还有你 梅格
You too, Meg.

377
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,440
这附近沉闷得像坟墓一样
It's dull as tombs around here.

378
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,940
罗伦斯先生 一个人不能像对牛那样对女士们大喊大叫
Mr. Laurence, one doesn't shout at ladies as if they were cattle.

379
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,910
我道歉
My apologies.

380
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,690
好啦
All right.

381
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,100
那些女孩子整天在那儿做什么？
What do those girls do over there all day?

382
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,100
女性生活的秘密...
Over the mysteries of female life...

383
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,210
就像被面纱蒙上的脸 最好别去打扰
there is drawn a veil, best left undisturbed.

384
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,070
哦 亲爱的伯爵夫人 请为我祈祷...
Oh, dear Countess, pray for me...

385
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,010
因为我和我的亲哥哥罗吉戈犯下原罪 品尝了禁果
for I have sinned against meself and me brother Rodrigo.

386
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,610
你应该说重读“犯下原罪” 这样才能表示你真的犯了原罪
You've got to say sinned as if you've really sinned!

387
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,280
犯下原罪！
Sinned!

388
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,750
犯下原罪！
Sinned!

389
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,420
罗吉戈！
Rodrigo!

390
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,820
你是来找兰克斯郡公爵的
You arrive seeking the Duke of Lankershire.

391
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,960
喂 谁在那儿？
Hark ye. Who goes there?

392
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,290
哦 我忘敲铜钹了
Oh, I forgot the cymbals.

393
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:55,830
怎么...
Why it’s...

394
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,900
那是罗吉戈！
it's Rodrigo!

395
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,630
罗吉戈？
Rodrigo?

396
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,300
我要扮裴莉特夫人
I want to be Lady Violet.

397
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,670
我“倦厌”演那个男孩了
（艾米再次用错单词）
I'm "exhaustified" of being the boy.

398
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,680
戏剧就是人生 艾米！
The play is the thing, Amy!

399
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,510
你扮裴莉特夫人还太小
You're too little to be Lady Violet.

400
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,740
那 你来演我的蒙太内斯库伯爵夫人吧
Here, be the Countess de Montanescu.

401
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,440
你的角色一句台词都没有
You don't have any lines.

402
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,250
那谁来扮我们的罗吉戈哥哥？
Besides who would be our Rodrigo?

403
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,180
各位先生...
Gentlemen...

404
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,050
我提议允许一位新会员 加入我们的戏剧社
I propose the admission of a new member to our theatrical society.

405
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,730
西奥多·罗伦斯 我们投票表决
Theodore Laurence. We'll put it to a vote.

406
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,960
不 他会嘲讽我们的表演 以后还会取笑我们
Nay. He'll laugh at our acting and poke fun at us later.

407
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,600
他会认为这只是个游戏
He'll think it's only a game.

408
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,070
不 他不会的 作为一个绅士 我保证
No, he won't. Upon my word as a gentleman.

409
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,630
乔 只有女士在场的时候 我们才可以无拘无束一点
Jo, when it's only ladies, we don't guard our conduct in the same way.

410
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,840
我们才可以袒露我们的灵魂 说出最可怕的秘密
We bear our souls and tell the most appalling secrets.

411
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,810
不然他会发现我们举止不当的
He would find us improper.

412
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,980
泰迪不会做这种事的
Teddy would do nothing of the sort.

413
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,620
噢 拜托？我们试试他 好吗？
Oh, please? Let's try him. Shall we?

414
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,180
-叛徒！ -各位艺术家
-Traitor! -Fellow artists,

415
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,320
请允许我介绍一下...作为一个演员 一个音乐家
may I present myself...as an actor, a musician,

416
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,840
也是这个俱乐部忠诚而谦逊的仆人
and a loyal and very humble servant of the club.

417
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,460
我们自有论断
We'll be the judge of that.

418
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,500
为表达我的感谢之情
In token of my gratitude,

419
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,870
及促进两国沟通...
and as a means of promoting... communication between adjoining nations...

420
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,500
由于现在禁止窗口喊叫
shouting from windows being forbidden,

421
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,840
所以我将提供...
I shall provide...

422
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,080
一个挂在树篱上的邮筒...
a post office in our hedge...

423
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,440
以此来进一步鼓励
to further encourage

424
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,950
袒露我们的灵魂...
the baring of our souls...

425
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,150
说出我们最可怕的秘密的行为
and the telling of our most appalling secrets.

426
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,990
我谨承诺...
I do pledge...

427
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,430
永远不会泄露我在这里得到的秘密
never to reveal what I receive in confidence here.

428
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,900
既然这样...
Well then...

429
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,440
请就位吧 罗吉戈
do take your place, Rodrigo.

430
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,800
罗吉戈...爵士
Sir...Rodrigo.

431
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,090
于是罗利被我们的戏剧社所接纳...
And so Laurie was admitted as an equal into our society...

432
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,690
而我们马屈家的女孩可以享受拥有一个真正兄弟般的新奇生活了…
and we March girls could enjoy the daily novelty...of having a real brother of our very own.

433
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,030
我要去戏院 我哪儿也没去过
I want to go to the theater. I never get to go anywhere.

434
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,600
你太小了 贝丝 妈咪看戏的眼镜呢？
You're too little. Beth, where in tarnation are Marmee's opera glasses?

435
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,840
我不小了 你们只是想霸占罗利
I'm not too little. You're just hogging Laurie.

436
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,980
拜托 我不能去吗？
Please, can't I go?

437
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,980
喔 艾米 我怕罗利只预定了四个座位 我看起来是不是太寒酸了？
Oh, Amy, I'm afraid Laurie only reserved four seats. Do I look too shabby?

438
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,610
哦 天哪 梅格 这又不是加冕典礼
Oh, Jehoshaphat, Meg, this isn't a coronation.

439
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,880
只是罗利和那个可怕的布鲁克先生而已
It's just Laurie and that awful Mr. Brooke.

440
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,720
乔 你不能向泰迪再要张票吗？
Jo, can't you ask Teddy to get another ticket?

441
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,990
不!
No!

442
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,290
你感冒了 亲爱的
You have a cold, dear.

443
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,890
-闭上眼睛 -依芙琪琳和我去沏茶
-Rest your eyes. -Evangeline and I will make you some ginger tea.

444
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,800
你的代数学落了好几个礼拜
You're weeks behind in algebra.

445
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,770
划记号那几页都要写 我可不想有个懒惰无知的妹妹
Do all the pages that I've marked. I won't have a sister who's a lazy ignoramus.

446
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,810
别生闷气 你看起来像只鸽子
Don't sulk. You look like a pigeon.

447
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,810
晚安
Good night.

448
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,680
你会后悔的 乔·马屈！
You'll be sorry for this, Jo March!

449
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,030
谢谢
Thank you.

450
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:29,220
哦 内尔·沃森太太 她还真是个完美的花痴啊？
（沃森太太，片中戏院的剧中人物）
Oh, Mrs. Nell Watson. Wasn't she a wonderful swooner?

451
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,600
-如果我是那种让犯花痴的人就好了! -如果我是那种让犯花痴的人就好了
-If only I were the swooning type! -If only I were the catching type.

452
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,140
小罗伦斯告诉我...你是一个戏剧迷 马屈小姐
Young Laurence informs me...you are an aficionado of the theater, Miss March.

453
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,580
这个 我...我喜欢读剧本
Well, I...I enjoy reading plays.

454
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,110
是呀 我 我觉得这是最令人愉快的经历
Yes. I, I find it most pleasurable myself.

455
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,910
虽然我得承认 我在剧院的时候...
Though I confess I'm distracted at the theater...

456
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,220
一想到演员们的特殊生活我就分心了
thinking of the peculiar lives of the actors themselves.

457
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,150
每当我想到沃森太太所遭受的粗暴对待时...
When one considers the immodesties Mrs. Nell Watson suffers...

458
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,090
总怀疑什么样的女人会愿意过这种生活
one wonders what sort of lady would seek such a life.

459
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,530
梅格可是个出色的女演员！
Meg is a sensational actress!

460
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,540
我们总是演疯狂的戏剧
We're always putting on wild theatricals.

461
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,770
这只是我们玩的游戏
It's just something that we play at.

462
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,280
嗯 事实上...在学校里 我参加过辩论
Well, as, as a matter of fact...at school I engaged in debating.

463
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,570
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think of that?

464
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,510
让我们去看他们做什么
Let's see what they do.

465
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,090
-我玩得很愉快 布鲁克先生 -我也是
- I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke. - As did I.

466
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,260
这是最快乐的一晚 我很想...
It was a most delightful evening. And I'd very much like...

467
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,030
非常感谢你 晚安
Thank you very much. Good night.

468
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,130
哦 晚安
Oh, good night.

469
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,210
这是不礼貌的
That was rude.

470
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,740
你醉倒在他怀里了
You plastered yourself on him.

471
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,300
-当男士举起手臂时 牵手是一种礼貌 -戏怎么样？
-It's proper to take a gentleman's arm if it's offered. -How was the theater?

472
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,350
有趣吗？
Amusing?

473
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,590
简直棒极了！我完全被那个爱情场景给震撼了
It was wonderful! I was absolutely inspired by the love scene.

474
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,090
你脸红了 亲爱的梅格 戏院很挤吗？
You look flushed, Meg dear. Was the theater overcrowded?

475
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,360
还生闷气呢？
Still sulking?

476
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,040
贝丝 我把手稿放哪儿去了
Beth, where did I put my manuscript?

477
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,350
不！
No!

478
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,330
不是我做的！
I didn't do it!

479
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,310
我要杀了你！
I'm gonna kill you!

480
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,410
我要杀了你！我要杀了你！
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

481
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,940
我要杀了你！你听见没有？
I'm gonna kill you! Do you hear me?

482
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,050
你怎么可以这么对我？
How can you do this to me?

483
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,140
乔 住手 你伤着她了
Jo, stop. You're hurting her.

484
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,850
乔！乔！放开她！怎么回事？
Jo! Jo! Let go of her! What's happened?

485
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,680
我恨你！我恨你！
I hate you! I hate you!

486
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,420
别碰它 让它烧了算了
Don't touch it. Just let it go.

487
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,530
来吧 就让它烧了吧
Come. Just let it go.

488
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,730
你死定了！你什么都不是！
You're dead! You're nothing!

489
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,200
我永远都不要再见到你！
I never want to see you again!

490
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,810
这是很大的损失 而你绝对有权利生气
It is a very great loss, and you have every right to be put out.

491
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,080
但别带着怒气入睡
But don't let the sun go down upon your anger.

492
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,750
原谅彼此
Forgive each other.

493
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,520
明天重新开始 好吗？
Begin again tomorrow, huh?

494
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,420
我永远都不会原谅她
I will never forgive her.

495
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,500
对不起 乔
I'm sorry, Jo.

496
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,720
看来这是我们今年最后一次玩雪了
（乔和罗利前往城郊的瓦尔登湖滑雪）
Looks like the last ice we'll have this year.

497
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,530
喊“出发”
Say "go."

498
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,260
罗利 乔 等我一下！
Laurie, Jo, wait for me!

499
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,530
别理她
Ignore her.

500
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,790
准备...我靠！
Ready... Blast!

501
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,870
乔 拜托！
Jo, please!

502
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,690
艾米！
Amy!

503
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,290
撑住！
Hold on.

504
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,630
我来了！我来了！
I'm coming! I'm coming!

505
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,570
撑住 艾米
Hold on, Amy.

506
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,040
找根横木！
Get a rail!

507
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,240
抓住木棍 艾米
Grab the stick, Amy.

508
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,640
快！
Come on!

509
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,080
撑住！
Hold on!

510
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,160
很好 对了 就这样 很好
There we go. That's it, that's it.

511
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:51,670
乔瑟芬·马屈 你大老远从瓦尔登湖过来...就只穿这件灯笼裤？
Josephine March, you walked all the way from Walden Pond...in only these bloomers?

512
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,710
说的好像她拿这当回事似的 亲爱的艾米
As if she even noticed. Dear Amy.

513
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,750
我怎么可能这么糟糕？
How could I have been so horrible?

514
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,250
感谢上帝罗利在场
Thank God for Laurie.

515
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,950
乔 你爱罗利胜过爱我吗？
Jo, do you love Laurie more than you love me?

516
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,210
哦 别像只可笑的甲虫似的！
Oh, don't be such a beetle!

517
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,980
我不可能像爱我姐妹一样去爱别人
I could never love anyone as I love my sisters.

518
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,610
我不是甲虫
I'm not a beetle.

519
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,720
哦 看来 你漏掉了最精彩的部分
Oh, look out. You're leaving out the best part.

520
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,560
当礼拉夫人屈从公爵的死敌时
When Lady Zara succumbs to the Duke's rival.

521
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,800
哦 是的 对了！是休果公爵
Oh, right, yes! Sir Hugo.

522
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
我个人相当的喜欢他！
I quite prefer him myself.

523
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,100
春天的时候 我们把果园屋弄得乱七八糟
In the spring, we turned Orchard House upside down...

524
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,910
为梅格参加莎莉·莫法特的社交宴会做准备
with preparations for Meg to attend Sally Moffat's coming out.

525
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,280
至于我自己 则宁可被吊死 也不参加化妆舞会
Myself, I'd sooner have been hung by the neck than attend a fancy ball.

526
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,580
等全波士顿人见你这身打扮 梅格
Wait 'til all of Boston sees you in this dress, Meg.

527
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,320
我告诉罗利得好好的炫耀一下你 不要让你像朵要死的靠墙花似的
I told Laurie he has to show you off and keep you from being a wallflower...upon penalty of death.

528
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,830
哦 那悲惨的手套在那儿？
Oh, where is that miserable glove?

529
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,000
阿比盖尔 我对你安排梅格的方式很是摇头
Abigail, I shake my head at the way you're managing Margaret.

530
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,140
她怎么能不露个面就结婚呢?
How is she to be married without a proper debut?

531
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,730
现在 姨妈 以我们的状况...
Now, Auntie, in our present circumstances...

532
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,300
你们的状况 就算你丈夫回来也不会变
Your circumstances will not change with your husband's return.

533
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,200
我外甥对钱的愚蠢程度就和他埋首研究的新哲学一样
My nephew is as foolish with money as he is in his new philosophies.

534
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,850
你家唯一的希望是让梅格嫁个好人家...
The one hope for your family is for Margaret to marry well...

535
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,020
虽然我不知道谁会去娶家庭女教师
though I don't know who marries governesses.

536
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,610
妈咪！
Marmee!

537
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,390
而这一位会彻底毁了她爱看书的性格
And this one has entirely ruined her disposition with books.

538
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,760
哦 是给我的吗 乔瑟芬？
Oh, are those for me, Josephine?

539
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,160
不 梅格要带去莫法特家
No. Meg's taking them to the Moffat's.

540
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,360
妈咪 梅格快疯了 她手套丢了 而她只有一付
Marmee, Meg's frantic. She lost her glove, and she only has one pair.

541
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,770
她不能不戴手套去 莫法特是此地的望族
She cannot go without gloves. The Moffats are society.

542
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,510
你说的完全正确
You're absolutely correct.

543
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,410
告诉梅格她可以借我的用
Tell Meg she may borrow mine.

544
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,710
梅格 你可以拿妈咪的！
Meg, you can take Marmee's!

545
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,770
哦 亲爱的！
Oh, dear!

546
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,580
-再加点茶？ -不，谢谢
- More tea? - No, thank you.

547
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,130
莎莉·莫法特
Sally Moffat,

548
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,000
你撑得都快拉不紧束腹带了
you won't be able to draw your laces.

549
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,410
在我的初次社交派对之前 我几星期都没吃饭
At my coming out party, I didn't eat for weeks beforehand.

550
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,010
哦 梅格 我喜欢你身上的这颜色
Oh, Meg, I do like that color on you.

551
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,710
它就像勿忘我花一样
It's just like forget-me-nots.

552
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,080
这是内战爆发以来我见过的最好的布料
The nicest I've seen that kind of fabric since the war broke out.

553
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,580
但是你把它编得如此平凡
But you had it made up so plain.

554
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,850
这个...我...我自己做的缝纫 而且...
Well, I...I do my own sewing, and...

555
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,290
查尔斯街的芬斯特夫人店有现成的丝绸
Mrs. Finster's on Charles Street carries silk pieces ready-made.

556
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,970
明天我带你过去
Tomorrow I'll take you there.

557
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,970
马屈家几年都没买丝绸了
Marches haven't bought silk in years.

558
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,260
他们对奴隶制度有意见
They have views on slavery.

559
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:47,270
梅格 你父亲的学校不得不关闭 不是吗...当他让一个黑人小女孩进来上学的时候?
Meg, isn't it true your father's school had to close...when he admitted a little dark girl?

560
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:53,270
芬斯特太太家的丝绸不是在南方加工的 就在这里 在林菲尔德
The silk of Mrs. Finster's isn't milled in the South. It's made right here, over in Linfield.

561
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,750
这不会是中国丝吧？
This isn't China silk?

562
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,110
他们用小孩当劳工
They use little children for labor.

563
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,780
所有纺纱厂都这样
All the silk mills do.

564
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,520
穷人总是跟我们在一起
The poor are always with us.

565
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,120
你真好 提醒了我们
You are so good to remind us.

566
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,260
我能告诉你件事吗？
May I tell you something?

567
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,360
这是下午穿的衣服
This is an afternoon dress.

568
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,300
我要你做我腻友
I'm going to make you my pet.

569
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,910
今晚马奇小姐想要多少战利品就有多少战利品
Tonight Miss March shall have as many conquests as she likes.

570
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,280
你没穿束腹
You have no corset.

571
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,180
不 我想下一支是波尔卡舞...能和我一起吗？
No, I believe the next dance is the polka...with me.

572
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,710
我也想你一起 派克先生...
I would dance with you, Mr. Parker...

573
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,910
但我担心我的新鞋
but I fear for my new slippers.

574
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,880
我的信条是 “别踩我”
My credo is, " Don't tread on me."

575
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:12,850
马屈小姐
Miss March.

576
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,450
我还以为你们家都是戒酒的
I thought your family were temperance people.

577
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,120
罗利
Laurie.

578
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,370
哦 别遮 这里只剩一两位男士...还没见识过你的魅力
Oh, don't cover up. There may be one or two gentlemen here...who haven't seen all of your charms.

579
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,040
我答应过乔要炫耀你的
I did promise Jo I would show you off.

580
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,270
这是那些女孩子替我打扮的 我喜欢
The girls dressed me up, and I rather like it.

581
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:37,000
是呀 它展露了一个全新的梅格
Yes, it reveals a whole new Meg.

582
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,400
这你怎么说？
What do you call this?

583
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,950
梅格！
Meg!

584
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,660
对不起
I'm sorry.

585
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,200
请别告诉乔我的行为
Please don't tell Jo how I've behaved.

586
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,170
当然不会
Of course not.

587
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,630
只要你不告诉乔我的行为就好
If you won't tell anyone how I've behaved.

588
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,780
我只是在试着扮演一个角色...
I was only playing a part...

589
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,880
想知道作为贝尔·嘉丁纳的感觉...
to see how it felt to be Belle Gardiner...

590
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,790
被求了四次婚 戴过二十付手套
with four proposals and 20 pairs of gloves.

591
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,320
你比他们强十倍
You're worth ten of those other girls.

592
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,950
你们看见那个马屈家的女孩如何追求罗家的嗣子了吗？
Did you see the way this March girl has gone after the Laurence heir?

593
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,490
这可能是马屈家最幸运的事了
Best thing that could happen to the Marches.

594
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,240
哦！这可笑的衣服！我整晚老被它绊倒
Oh! This ridiculous dress! I've been tripping over it all night.

595
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,840
缠一些在你脖子上 它可以让你好受些
Tie something around your neck where it can do you some good.

596
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,310
我讨厌人们说罗利和梅格的闲话...
I don't like people speculating about Laurie and our Meg...

597
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,250
就好像他们是戏剧里的角色一样
as if they were characters in some play.

598
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,080
没什么比看到一个女人自得其乐更能引起人们的闲话了
Nothing provokes speculation more than the sight of a woman enjoying herself.

599
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:03,490
-为什么罗利可以爱怎么做就怎么做 调情 喝香槟... -而不会有人看不起他是吧?
- Why is it Laurie may do as he likes, flirt and tipple champagne... - And no one thinks the less of him?

600
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,730
这个嘛 我想有个实际的理由
Well, I suppose for one practical reason:

601
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,890
因为罗利是男人 正因如此...
Laurie is a man, and as such...

602
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,840
他可以投票 拥有财产和追求他所爱的职业
he may vote, hold property and pursue any profession he pleases.

603
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,940
所以他不容易被别人看不起
And so he is not so easily demeaned.

604
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,270
为什么会有人在乎别人怎么想？
Why should anyone care what they think?

605
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,410
我就在乎
I do.

606
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,910
能受到表扬和赞美是件好事 我忍不住喜欢它
It's nice to be praised and admired. I couldn't help but like it.

607
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,520
不是这么回事！
Of course not!

608
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,210
我只在乎你自己的想法
I only care what you think of yourself.

609
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,220
如果你觉得你的价值只在于做一个装饰品...
If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative...

610
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:41,460
恐怕有一天你会发现你自己... 真的相信你只是这样
I fear that someday you might find yourself...believing that's all that you really are.

611
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,420
时间会腐蚀所有外表的美
Time erodes all such beauty,

612
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,690
但时间无法消灭...
but what it cannot diminish...

613
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,360
你心灵的美好
is the wonderful workings of your mind.

614
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:54,640
你的幽默 你的友爱...以及你在道德上的勇气
Your humor, your kindness...and your moral courage.

615
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,170
这些是我所珍爱的你心中的东西
These are the things I cherish so in you.

616
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,480
我真希望能给我女孩子们一个更公平的世界
I so wish I could give my girls a more just world.

617
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,570
我知道你们会使它更美好
I know you'll make it a better place.

618
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,090
不 我不现在不需要这些书
No, I don't want them now.

619
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,650
留着曲谱吧 我好久都不会再碰钢琴了
And keep the music. I won't be going near a piano for ages.

620
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,560
你去念大学会需要书的 这是你的《董贝父子》
（《董贝父子》，狄更斯小说）
You need your books in college. Here's your Dombey and Sons.

621
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,460
我可以发誓还有另一卷的
I could've sworn there was another volume.

622
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:56,260
老实说 乔...我不会把狄更斯的书都带到哈佛去
Honestly, Jo...I won't be taking all of Dickens to Harvard with me.

623
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,460
哦 你确实不会 你有更重要的东西要学习
Oh, no. You'll have much more important things to read.

624
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,840
什么都不会改变的 乔
Nothing's going to change, Jo.

625
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,380
我希望我能去大学
I wish I could go.

626
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,780
我也希望你能去
I wish you could too.

627
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,410
你会学到各种我不会的东西 然后我会讨厌你
You'll come back knowing all sorts of things I don't know...and then I'll hate you.

628
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,490
这个嘛 这已经发生了...
Well, as it happens...

629
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,230
我就知道一些你不知道的事
I already know something you don't know.

630
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,660
是关于梅格...
About Meg...

631
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:30,730
和我的某位前任家教的...
and a certain former tutor of mine...

632
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,460
此人很快将受聘于罗伦斯父子公司
soon to be employed at the firm of Laurence and Laurence.

633
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,560
撒谎
Liar.

634
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:42,040
梅格是否曾错放过某件私人物品 像是...
Has Meg mislaid a certain personal article such as...

635
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,100
一只手套？
a glove?

636
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,820
梅格 约翰·布鲁克偷了你的手套！
Meg, John Brooke stole your glove!

637
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,190
什么手套？不...不会是白色的那只吧？
What glove? N-Not my white one?

638
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,590
布鲁克偷走很久了 罗利说他把它放在自己的口袋里
Brooke's had it forever. Laurie says he keeps it in his pocket.

639
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,920
你得要他交回手套 汉娜 你也认为他该还回来不是吗？
You must tell him to return it. Hannah, don't you think he oughta give it back?

640
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,420
我怎么想并不重要
'Tisn't what I think that matters.

641
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,860
乔？梅格？
Jo? Meg?

642
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,070
这是...华盛顿医院来的电报
It's, uh, a telegram ...from Washington Hospital.

643
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,970
你们爸爸受伤了
Your father's been wounded.

644
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,870
快呀 艾米 就这样了
Come on, Amy. That's it.

645
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,050
家庭账本在这里 这该够你们用到月底
The household account is in this ledger. It should see you through the month.

646
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,590
当然 别担心我们
Of course. Don't worry about us.

647
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,490
哦 贝丝 亲爱的 帮我照顾汉默家 好吗？
Oh, Beth, dear. Look in on the Hummels for me, will you?

648

668
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,870
我不能忍受向她要钱
I couldn't bear to ask her.

669

There's no more cornmeal nor coffee. The grocer won't let us have more on account.

我能带什么给汉默家？
What can I bring the Hummels?

We'd have a week's groceries with what he spends on billiards.

699

哦 天啊！
Oh, Jehoshaphat!

700
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,320
梅格！

汉默家的婴儿病了

我觉得好奇怪

她在发高烧 但她说就像受冻一样
She's burning up, but she says that she's freezing.

She has a terrible thirst, but she won't drink.

Sounds like arsenicum, but she looks more like belladonna.

709

You and Miss Jo won't be harmed. You had it when you were babies.

714
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,080
她不会死的
She won't die.

715
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,810
她会死吗 罗利？
Will she, Laurie?

716
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,620
上帝不会让她死的
God wouldn't let her die.

717
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,420
我不要离开

我怕马屈姑婆
I'm afraid of Aunt March.

721
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,370
如果她对你不好...
If she's unkind to you...

722
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,400
我就来带你走

我还没被吻过
I've never even been kissed.

731
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,070
我等被吻等了一辈子
I've waited my whole life to be kissed.

732
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,370
如果我再也没有机会了呢？
And what if I miss it?

733
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,040
我告诉你怎么办
I tell you what.

734
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:47,070
我保证在你死之前吻你

735
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,830
我不知道 我觉得妈咪不应该离开父亲
I don't know. I don't think Marmee should leave Father.

736
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:14,240
贝丝需要妈咪 她依赖她
Beth needs Marmee. She depends on her.

737
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,800
但是如果我们把她叫回来 而父亲的伤情更糟了么？
But what if we send for her and Father gets worse?

738
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,940
看在上帝的份上 我们怎么付的起火车钱?
How in the name of all that's holy would we pay for the train?

739
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,800
“他亵渎的不是我的‘绳所’...”
"That he profane not my 'sancteraries'..."

740

“因此我 上帝 降圣迹给他们”
For I, the Lord, do sanctify them.

743
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,460
而摩西告诉亚伦和他的儿子们...
And Moses told it unto Aaron and to his sons...

744
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,830
and unto all the children of Israel."
以及所有的以色列子民”

746
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,370
“上帝对摩西说...”

乔 罗伦斯先生来了

如果可以的话
If we may,

I wish my personal physician, Dr. Bangs...to examine the little girl.

无能为力了
There's nothing to be done.

751
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:32,550
如果给她放血 会致她死的
If I bleed her, it would finish her.

752
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,410
-最好请她母亲回来 -原谅我
- Best to send for the mother. - Forgive me.

753

760
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,840

761
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,710
得让她的头部退烧
Must draw the fever down from her head.

762
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:24,680
没事 现在没事了

就这样亲爱的贝丝回到了我们的身边...
And so our dear Beth came back to us...

766
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,640
但高烧永远使她心脏衰弱
although the fever had weakened her heart forever.

767
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,340
那时我们并不知道 阴影已经降临
We did not know then that a shadow had fallen.

768
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,430
我们准备着另一个没有爸爸的圣诞节

00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,490
不 别坐那儿！坐在...
No, don't sit there! Sit...

782
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,430
这儿！
Here.

783
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,190
坐这儿孩子
Sit here child.

784
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:58,090
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

785
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,350
我早该把它送给你
I should have given it to you long ago.

786
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,310
这是我小女儿的...
It belonged to my little girl...

787
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:15,440
她很小就去世了
who had to leave us when she was very young.

788
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:19,710
但是现在 它又将弹奏出音乐了
But now, it will make music again.

789
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,930
谢谢你 罗伦斯先生。
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.

790
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,500
圣诞快乐！
Merry Christmas!

791
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,430
弹点什么吧 贝丝
Play something, Beth.

792
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,670

我担心你的婚约还要很久
I fear you would have a long engagement.

803
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,240
三四年吧 约翰得在和你结婚前有个房子...
Three or four years. John must secure a house before you can marry...

804
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:48,570
而且他还得给联邦政府服兵役
and he must do a service to the Union.

805
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,340
约翰？结婚？
John? Marry?

806
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:53,510
你指那无趣的老布鲁克？
You mean that pokey old Mr. Brooke?

807
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,200
他是怎么和这个家扯上关系的？
How did he weasel his way into this family?

808
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:56,770
乔
Joe.

809
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,170
约翰很体贴 每天到医院探望父亲
John has been very kind to go visit father in the hospital every day.

810
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,310
他像香粉般无趣 梅格
He's dull as powder. Meg,

811
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,040
你就不能嫁给有趣点的人吗？
can't you at least marry someone amusing?

812
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,310
我中意布鲁克先生
I'm fond of Mr. Brooke.

813
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,780
他是个好人 善良而严肃…
He's a good man. He's kind and serious...

814
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:10,180
还有 我不怕穷
and I'm not afraid of being poor.

815
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,440
妈咪 你不能让她嫁给他
Marmee, you can't just let her go and marry him.

816
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,570
我不会随便嫁给任何人
I'd hardly just go and marry anyone.

817
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:17,380
我宁愿梅格为爱结婚 成为穷人的妻子...
I would rather Meg marry for love and be a poor man's wife...

818
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,780
也比为了财富而结婚 失去自尊要好
than marry for riches and lose her self-respect.

819
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,780
所以说你不在意约翰穷？
So you don't mind that John is poor?

820
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,050
不 但我希望他有个房子
No, but I would rather he have a house.

821
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,850
为什么一定得结婚？
Why must we marry at all?

822
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,990
为什么就不能维持现状？
Why can't things just stay as they are?

823
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,720
这只是求婚 不必决定什么
It is only a proposal. Nothing need be decided.

824
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,780
听着 女孩们...别糟蹋这一天

圣诞快乐！各位
Merry Christmas, everyone.

831
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,900
多好的圣诞礼物！
What a wonderful Christmas present!

832
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,160
哦 爸爸 你回家了！

833
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,350
噢 你比以前还英俊了！
Oh, you're more handsome than ever!

Beth, my little cookie. Thank God you're well.

835
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,670
给这人一点空间呼吸吧
Give the man room to breathe.

836
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,060
乔!噢 我的野丫头！
Jo! Oh, my wild girl!

837
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:17,180
这个 可能会流行哦
Well, this could become the fashion.

838
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,900
-当心别碰他的胳膊 小心 -我不习惯这样
- Watch his arm. Be careful. - I'm not used to this.

839
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,230
别把我这军人宠坏了
Don't coddle this soldier too much.

840
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,230
哦 爸爸！
Oh, Father!

841
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:30,340
汉娜 上帝祝福你 很高兴见到你
Hannah, God bless you. It's good to see you.

842
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,140
很高兴你回家 马奇先生。
It's good to have you home, Mr. March.

843
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,520
现在 让我瞧瞧我的女儿们
Now, let me look at my girls.

844
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:39,140
拿走 把它们给...
Take them and give them...

845
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:51,750
霍乱夺走的人命比叛军多 我所了解是这样 先生
The cholera took more men than the Rebs, as I understand it, sir.

846
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,680
学校不教农艺 但这应该是必修的
Agriculture isn't taught, and it should be required.

847
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,400
也许这些奴隶成为自由人之后应该在西部获得土地。
Perhaps the freedmen should be given land in the West.

848
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,060
你和约翰怎么了？
What happened between you and John?

849
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,530
你别管
Never you mind.

850
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,310
这不是很好吗 乔？
Isn't it wonderful, Jo?

851
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,370
是的 太好了
Yes, it's wonderful.

852
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:46,620
（四年后）

853
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:56,500
万物之主我们向您致敬
♪ Lord of all to Thee we raise ♪

854
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:01,300
这是我们感恩赞美的颂歌
♪ This our hymn of grateful praise ♪

855
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,370
转变肯定会到来
Change will come as surely

856
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:06,970
犹如四季更迭 而且来得更快
as the seasons and twice as quick.

857
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,980
我们尽力泰然处之...
We make our peace with it as best we can...

858
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:13,390
就像艾米小时候曾说的
or as Amy once said when she was still a little girl:

859
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:17,120
“我们总有一天会长大 我们该想清楚自己要什么”
"We'll all grow up someday. We might as well know what we want. "

860
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,130
万物之主我们向您致敬
♪ Lord of all to Thee we raise ♪

861
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,410
这是我们感恩赞美的颂歌
♪ This our hymn of grateful praise ♪

862
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,340
万物之主我们向您致敬
♪ Lord of all to Thee we raise ♪

863
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:39,820
这是我们感恩赞美的颂歌
♪ This our hymn of grateful praise ♪

864
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,760
所以 你觉得我们的艾米有天份？
So you feel our Amy has talent?

865
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,820
噢 马屈小姐十分擅长绘画...
Oh, Miss March excels at drawing...

866
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:53,230
但 你知道的 她的风景画缺少情感
but, you know, her landscapes lack emotion.

867
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,830
我确信艾米会从进一步的学习中获益...
I definitely feel Amy would benefit from further study...

868
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,500
但她在这里没法更进一层楼
but she won't get it around here.

869
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,980
你建议去哪里？
Where do you suggest?

870
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:06,780
科德角有一个很好的艺术家群体...但欧洲才是最好的地方
(科德角，美国地名)
Cape Cod has a fine artist colony...but Europe is the best place.

871
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:17,730
泰迪 泰迪
Teddy, Teddy.

872
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,800
你的管家说你要等晚上才能回家
Your houseman said you wouldn't be home till night.

873
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:21,990
我等不了很久
I couldn't wait so long.

874
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,000
为毕业生欢呼吧！
Hail the conquering graduate!

875
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:26,260
爷爷感到骄傲吗？
Is Grandfather exceedingly proud?

876
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,400
是的 还一心要把我锁在他的办公室里
Yes, and exceedingly bent on locking me up in one of his offices.

877
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,070
为什么艾米可以给瓷器作画...
Why is it Amy may paint china...

878
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:37,280
而你可以随意写作...而我却必须得果断地把音乐丢在一边？
and you can scribble away...while I must manfully set my music aside?

879
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:39,690
所以为什么你得这样呢？
Why must you?

880
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,420
如果我不这样...就得违抗爷爷
If I don't...I'd have to defy Grandfather.

881
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,360
对 但不是违抗整个社会
Yes, and not the whole of society.

882
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,170
但我不能反对这老人
I can't go against the old man.

883
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:59,370
当我想像自己要过哪种生活时...
When I imagine myself in that life...

884
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:05,440
我只想到一件事...能让我快乐
I can think of only one thing...that would make me happy.

885
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:10,990
哦 不 泰迪
Oh, no, Teddy.

886
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:13,190
泰迪 不要
Teddy, don't.

887
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,130
不 等一下 泰迪
No, wait, Teddy.

888
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:25,340
我们得理智的谈谈
We have to talk about this reasonably.

889
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,540
从我紧紧盯着你的那一刻起...
I have loved you...

890
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:30,010
我就爱上了你
since the moment I clamped eyes on you.

891
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,380
有什么能比跟你结婚更理智？
Would could be more reasonable than to marry you?

892
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,720
我们会杀了彼此的
We'd kill each other.

893
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:36,850
胡说
Nonsense.

894
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,450
你我都无法控制我们的坏脾气
Neither of us can keep our temper.

895
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,180
我能控制...
I can...

896
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:40,510
除非被激怒
unless provoked.

897
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:42,930
我们都固执得愚蠢 尤其是你
We're both stupidly stubborn, especially you.

898
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,790
-我们会吵架的 -我不会！
- We'd only quarrel. - I wouldn't!

899
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,090
你连求婚都做不到不吵架
You can't even propose without quarreling.

900
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:50,500
乔...
Jo...

901
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:53,250
亲爱的乔
Dear Jo,

902
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,500
我发誓我做一个圣人
I swear I'll be a saint.

903
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,840
我会每次争吵都让你赢
I'll let you win every argument.

904
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:05,180
我会照顾你和你的家人
I'll take care of you and your family.

905
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,620
我会给你所有你被拒绝过的奢侈生活
I'll give you every luxury you've ever been denied.

906
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:11,630
你无需靠着写作维生 除非你愿意
You won't have to write unless you want to.

907
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:17,500
爷爷...要我到英国学做生意
Grandfather...wants me to learn the business in England.

908
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,570
你难道不想我们伦敦四处乱逛吗？
Can't you see us bashing around London?

909
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:21,670
伦敦
London.

910
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,680
哦 泰迪 我还不够时髦去伦敦
Oh, Teddy, I'm not fashionable enough for London.

911
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:28,610
你需要的是以一个高贵和优雅的人
You need someone who's elegant and refined.

912
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,950
我要你
I want you.

913
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,830
泰迪 请别逼我
Teddy, please don't ask me.

914
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:49,830
我非常抱歉 我真的很在乎你...
I'm desperately sorry. I do care for you...

915
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,840
在我心里你是我最亲爱的朋友
In my heart you're my dearest friend.

916
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:57,150
但我就是没法做一个妻子
I just can't go be a wife.

917
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:02,040
你说不会 但...你会的
You say you won't, but... you will.

918
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,390
我不会 我不会
I won't. I won't.

919
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,450
有一天...
One day...

920
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,190
你会遇上某个男人
you'll meet some man.

921
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:16,190
一个好男人 而你会非常爱他
A good man. And you will love him tremendously.

922
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:22,200
你会为他而生 为他而死
And you will live and die for him.

923
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,880
泰迪 拜托
Teddy, please.

924
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:27,470
乔 你会的
Joe, you will.

925
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:31,880
我了解你
I know you.

926
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:42,290
我会去上吊的...若我在一边目睹的话
And I'll be hanged...if I stand by and watch.

927
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:05,650
乔 你生病了？
Jo, are you ill?

928
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,390
她拒绝了罗利
She has refused Laurie.

929
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:12,460
这个 我相信她会改变心意的
Well, I'm sure she can take it back.

930
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,130
这只是个误会
It's just a misunderstanding.

931
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,400
不会的
No.

932
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,540
听他说
Listen to him.

933
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,540
我必须离开
I must get away.

934
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:28,610
当然
Of course.

935
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,890
马屈姑婆要去法国
Aunt March is going to France.

936
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,160
法国！
France!

937
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,030
那是理想!只要能去我什么都能忍受!
That's ideal! I'll put up with anything to go!

938
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:41,400
马屈姑婆已经要我去了
Aunt March has asked me to go.

939
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:47,110
去欧洲？我的欧洲？
To Europe? My Europe?

940
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:52,640
什么时候？
When?

941
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:55,780
今天才决定的
It was decided just today.

942
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:06,390
这个 我现在是她的旅伴了
Well, I am her companion now.

943
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,730
她希望我出国学习绘画...
She wishes me to study painting abroad...

944
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,830
并希望我可能找到一个好归宿
in hopes I might make a good match there.

945
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:21,080
但也许她不会介意你留在她家里...
But perhaps she wouldn't mind if you stayed at Plumfield...

946
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,150
在我们离开之后
while we are gone.

947
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,630
当然 马奇姑婆更喜欢艾米而不是我
Of course Aunt March prefers Amy over me.

948
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:38,430
为什么不该她去呢？我又难看又古怪 我还经常说错话
Why shouldn't she? I'm ugly and awkward, and I always say the wrong things.

949
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,100
我莫名其妙地抛弃了完美的求婚
I fly around throwing away perfectly good marriage proposals.

950
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:45,170
我爱我们家 但我的心性如此不定...
I love our home, but I'm just so fitful...

951
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,900
我无法忍受留在这里了!
that I can't stand being here!

952
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:53,040
抱歉 我很抱歉 妈咪
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Marmee.

953
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,150
我一定是哪里有毛病
There's just something really wrong with me.

954
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,990
我想改变 但我做不到...
I want to change, but I can't...

955
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,930
我知道我哪里也适应不了
and I just know I'll never fit in anywhere.

956
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:09,570
乔 你有那么多不凡的才能
Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts.

957
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,930
你怎能期望过平凡的日子？
How can you expect to lead an ordinary life?

958
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:18,550
你已经准备好要走出去了 好好利用你的才能
You're ready to go out and find a good use for your talent.

959
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,550
虽然我不知道没有我的乔该怎么办
Although I don't know what I shall do without my Jo.

960
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,690
去吧...拥抱你的自由吧...
Go...and embrace your liberty...

961
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:34,360
看看能成就什么美事
and see what wonderful things come of it.

962
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,930
罗利避往伦敦并四处游历
Laurie sought his refuge in London and abroad.

963
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,530
妈咪帮我在纽约找到住所...
Marmee helped me find a place in the great city of New York...

964
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:14,070
就此我跨越了童年 抛下了过往的一切
and so I stepped over the divide between childhood and all that lay beyond.

965
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,810
柯克太太？
Mrs. Kirk?

966
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,340
乔瑟芬！
Josephine!

967
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,940
是我 你还好吗？
Yes. How do you do?

968
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:26,890
吉帝 米妮 这是马屈小姐
Kitty, Minnie. This is Miss March.

969
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:29,930
她爸爸是马屈上校 他认识你爸爸
Her father was Colonel March. He knew your papa.

970
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,890
小心走 寇先生
Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.

971
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:35,160
请进 亲爱的
Do come in, my dear.

972
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:43,340
亲爱的贝丝 妈咪的朋友 柯克太太
Dear Beth: Marmee's friend, Mrs. Kirk,

973
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:45,040
让我感觉像在家里一样
has made me feel quite at home.

974
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:48,710
我的小学生 吉帝和米妮 是可爱的女孩子
My little students, Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.

975
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,680
在繁忙的寄宿学校成长真奇特...
How curious to grow up in a busy boarding house...

976
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,250
没父亲 母亲是店主
with no father and your own mother the innkeeper.

977
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:04,100
离开康柯德时我勇气十足...
I felt bold on leaving Concord...

978
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:08,940
但我承认 我觉得纽约既粗糙又奇怪...我觉得我自己也很奇怪了
but I confess I find New York rough and strange... and myself strange in it

979
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,400
请把这些东西从桌子那边传过去 非常感谢您 教授
Please pass these down the table. Thank you kindly, Professor.

980
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:22,890
柯克太太相信我来此是为了...
Mrs. Kirk believes that I am here...

981
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,650
在我屈服于婚姻前...体验过度期的美好
for a brief interlude of sensational experience...before succumbing to a matrimonial fate.

982
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:34,230
虽然我在这样应用尽有的城市...已经不缺乏什么耸人听闻的体验了
And while there is surely no lack of sensational experience...of every kind available in such a city...

983
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,900
虽然我仍未交上好运 但我希望...
I hope, though I've had no luck yet...

984
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:40,840
我在这里获得的任何体验都能转变为文学作品...
that any experience I gain here will be strictly literary...

985
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:47,170
这样我就能把所有浪漫 动人的事凝聚于书页中
and that all events of a romantic or sensational nature...will be entirely confined to the page.

986
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:50,980
小姐 我们的读者对情感故事和神话故事不感兴趣
Our subscribers are not interested in sentiment and fairy stories, miss.

987
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:55,420
这不是神话故事
They're not fairy stories.

988
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,150
你可以试试投一个女士杂志
Try one of the ladies' magazines.

989
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,090
我真抱歉 我真笨拙
I'm so sorry. I'm so clumsy.

990
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:39,470
你知道当我第一次见到你的时候 我想的是…
You know that when first I saw you, I thought...

991
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:44,010
“啊！她是个作家”
"Ah! She is a writer."

992
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:46,810
你为什么这么想？
What made you think so?

993
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,650
是的 我认识许多作家
Yes, I know many writers.

994
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:02,200
在柏林 我是...我是大学教授
In Berlin I was ... I was professor at the university.

995
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:07,670
在这 恐怕只是个卑微的家教
Here I am just a humble tutor, I'm afraid.

996
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,480
不 请坐
No. Please, sit down.

997
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,080
谢谢
Thank you.

998
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,730
你离家很远吗 马奇小姐？
You are far from home, Miss March?

999
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:32,700
你想念家人吗？
Do you miss your family?

1000
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,560
哦 非常想
Oh, very much.

1001
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:38,500
尤其是我的姐妹们 还有罗利
My sisters especially. And Laurie.

1002
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,840
她是你的姐妹？
She is your sister?

1003
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,440
不 他是个朋友
No, he's a friend.

1004
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,510
你喜欢你的咖啡吗？
You like your coffee?

1005
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:53,720
哦 这...只是有点浓 我喜欢
Oh, it's... just very strong. I like it.

1006
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:03,100
你的书房令人印象深刻
You have quite a library.

1007
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:06,580
你是从德国带来这所有的书吗？
Did you bring all these books from Germany?

1008
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:07,410
少数是
A few of them.

1009
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:08,940
我可以看吗？
May I?

1010
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,170
当然
Of course.

1011
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:16,020
大部份我舍不得此便留下
Most...most of these I could not bear to leave behind.

1012
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,980
我卖掉所有家当 换取来此的旅费...
I sold everything that I own to get my passage to come here...

1013
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:23,830
但我的书...绝不卖
but my books...never.

1014
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,570
莎士比亚
Shakespeare.

1015
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:33,040
有些书 好熟悉
Some books are so familiar.

1016
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:36,510
阅读它们就像又回到家了
Reading them is like being home again.

1017
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:44,350
你会回柏林吗 拜尔教授？
Will you be returning to Berlin, Professor Bhaer?

1018
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,890
佛德瑞克 叫我佛德瑞克就行
Friedrich. Call me Friedrich.

1019
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:47,850
佛德瑞克
Friedrich.

1020
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:50,790
不 悲剧的是
No. Sadly,

1021
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:55,860
哥德和席勒的故乡都...不复存在了
the fatherland of Goethe and Schiller...is no more.

1022
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:58,230
我崇拜哥德
I adore Goethe.

1023
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:01,840
小时候 父亲为我念各种德国诗
My father used to read me all the German poets when I was a child.

1024
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,700
真的？真令人惊讶
Really? That is most surprising.

1025
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:10,280
这个 我的父母属于很不寻常的那部分康柯德人
Well, my mother and father were part of...a rather unusual circlein Concord.

1026
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,180
你知道“超越论者”这个词吗？
Do you know the word "transcendentalist"?

1027
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,690
这可是德国浪漫主义哲学
But this is German romantic philosophy.

1028
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:18,920
我们抛开我们所有的束缚
We throw off all our constraints

1029
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:22,490
并且通过洞察力和经验…开始了解自己
and we come to know ourselves...through insight and experience.

1030
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:24,800
现在它已经过时了
It got out of fashion now.

1031
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,130
恐怕 在马屈家还没有
Not in the March family, I'm afraid.

1032
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:37,340
只不过所有的超越论...都在强调让自我完美
It's just that with all of this transcendence ... comes much emphasis on perfecting oneself.

1033
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,810
所以这给你带来了不少麻烦吗？
This gives you a problem?

1034
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,350
我是个无可救药的完美主义者
I'm hopelessly flawed.

1035
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:44,650
要是我们能...
If only we could...

1036
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:48,460
超越自我而不求完美
transcend ourselves without perfection.

1037
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:51,400
像你们的诗人 沃尔特·惠特曼...整天来去于百老汇的街道...
Like your poet, Walt Whitman...who rides up and down the streets of Broadway all day...

1038
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:54,400
对着怒吼的车潮咆哮出诗篇
shouting poetry against the roar of the carts.

1039
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:57,470
“留下你寂静的森林 哦 自然...
" Keep your silent woods, O Nature...

1040
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:00,130
“留下你河流旁寂静的天地” “留下你森林旁寂静的天地”
"And your quiet places by the river” “And your quiet places by the woods”

1041
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,540
“森林旁”
“by the woods.”

1042
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:04,600
“还我宁静的曼哈坦街道”
Give me the streets of Manhattan."

1043
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,930
我想我们都是无可救药的完美主义者
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.

1044
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:28,000
他穷的就像我想像中云游四海的哲学家
He is as poor as one might imagine an itinerant philosopher to be.

1045
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:29,670
然而 几个星期过去
Yet, as the weeks go by,

1046
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:32,800
我发现他对所有住在这里的人都很慷慨
that he is unfailingly generous...to all of us who live in the house.

1047
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:36,380
我感谢能有一个朋友
I am grateful to have a friend.

1048
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,910
这可是我们国家建立的基础
It is the system our nation was founded on.

1049
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:34,780
而看看现在 它除了背叛了我们国家的理想之外还有什么
Come now. It was nothing short of a betrayal of our country's ideals.

1050
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:36,180
我们国家的理想？
Our country's ideals?

1051
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:41,380
一部宪法...一部否认公民基本权利...
A constitution...that denies the basic rights of citizenship...

1052
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,860
否认女人和黑人权利的宪法 还能称之为宪法吗？
（指美国宪法最初规定妇女和黑人不具有投票权）
to women and black people?

1053
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:46,330
他们刚通过第15条修正案 雅各布 他们可以投票了
They just passed the 15th Amendment, Jacob. They can vote.

1054
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:48,250
是黑人男性可投票 查尔斯
Black men can vote, Charles.

1055
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:52,000
如果一个女士有了丈夫 那她就不需要投票了
A lady has no need of suffrage if she has a husband.

1056
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:55,200
-不 不 -你不喝酒吗？
-No, no. -You don't take wine?

1057
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,740
我只喝药酒
Only medicinally.

1058
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,870
那就假装你感冒了
Pretend that you've got a cold.

1059
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:01,910
我同意 但女人既然作为一种道德力量...
I agree, but if women are a moral force...

1060
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,480
难道她们就不该有权行政 布道 以及在法庭作证吗？
shouldn't they have the right to govern and preach and testify in court?

1061
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:08,350
你想说什么 马屈小姐？
What is it, Miss March?

1062
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,950
我觉得这是个很糟糕的逻辑：因为女人善良...
I find it poor logic to say that because women are good...

1063
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:14,360
所以女人应该拥有投票权
women should vote.

1064
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:18,700
男人可不是因为善良才可以投票 他们能投票是因为他们是男性
Men do not vote because they are good. They vote because they are male.

1065
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,330
女人应该拥有投票权 不是因为她们是天使而男人是野兽...
And women should vote not because they are angels and men are animals...

1066
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,430
而是因为我们都是人
but because we are human beings

1067
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:27,100
并且我们都是这个国家的公民
and citizens of this country.

1068
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,370
你该从事律师的 马屈小姐
You should have been a lawyer, Miss March.

1069
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,720
我该从事许多职业的 梅耶先生
I should have been a great many things, Mr. Mayer.

1070

1071
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,470
哦 我很抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

1072
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,400
不 不 请进
No, please. Please, come in.

1073
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,010
我有好消息
I have some good news.

1074
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,340
报纸登了我两篇故事
A newspaper has published two of my stories,

1075
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:57,670
而且希望看见更多作品
and they wish to see more.

1076
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,840
太好了
This is wonderful.

1077
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,680
就在这儿
Right there.

1080
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,550
作者乔瑟芬·马屈
by Joseph March.

1081
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:14,970
疯子 吸血鬼
Lunatics. Vampires.

1082
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,360
你对这感兴趣？
This interests you?

1083
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,940
人们喜欢惊悚小说 佛德瑞克
People like thrilling stories, Friedrich.

1084
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,570
这是报纸所要的
This is what the newspapers want.

1085
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:32,250
是 我想 我想这是事实
Yes. Yes, I suppose. I suppose that is true.

1086
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:36,920
这钱能为贝丝买件新外套 我相信她会很高兴的
It will buy a new coat for Beth, and I'm sure she'll be grateful to have it.

1087
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,320
乔
Joe.

1088
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,150
我...
I...

1089
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,610
我并不是想说教
I do not want to be your teacher.

1090
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:07,220
不 请理解我
No, understand me.

1091
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:11,360
我只是说你应该取悦的是自己
I am saying only that you should please yourself.

1092
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,890
我的意见并不重要
My opinion is of no importance.

1093
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:17,870
原谅我？
Do you forgive me?

1094
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,260
当然
Of course.

1095
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:23,040
我有一个礼物 一个经验
Then I make a gift. An experience.

1096
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:24,900
你喜欢歌剧吗？
Do you like the opera?

1097
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,650
哦 我喜欢！我是说 我想我喜欢
Oh, I do.I mean, I think I do.

1098
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,780
在康科德我们貌似很少听到歌剧
We don't seem to get a lot of opera in Concord.

1099
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,990
我没有看歌剧的衣服
I don't have an opera dress.

1100
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,060
你会很美的
You will be perfect.

1101
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:43,060
我们坐的地方 不必太...正式

她立誓永不陷入爱河

1104
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:19,100
她若违背誓言 她将失去一切
If she breaks her vow, all will be lost.

1105
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,840
哦 看 麻烦来了

1106

会发生什么事？
What's going to happen?

1107
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,780
无可避免的命运
The inevitable.

1108
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:40,530
蕾拉的灵魂觉醒了

1109
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:43,270
她陷入一个念头

1110

“在愉快夜晚的深邃处...”

“你的心明白我的心”

1116
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:13,640
哦 罗利！你这坏蛋！

马奇姑婆 您看来好极了

我无法对你这么说 孩子
I cannot say the same for you, my boy.

1127
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:43,410
亲爱的艾米 还要很久吗？我得睡了

Friedrich, how long would it take strychnine to dissolve in brandy?

1135
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:21,120
哦 大约八分钟？
Oh. About eight minutes?

1136
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:24,990
挂腰上的是短剑 还是军刀？
And is a dagger worn at the waist, or is that a saber?

1137
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:30,850
我想在这些小说里...短剑经常藏在靴里...
I think that in these novels...the dagger is usually concealed in the boot...

1138
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,390
藏在那有黑鬓的男士身上

它本不是这样的 但
It isn't what it should be, but ...

1143
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,530
你将它变美了
you have improved it.

1144
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,270
请别这样
Please don't.

1145
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:38,270

1146
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:42,610
我并没因此得到好处
It did not serve me well.

1147
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,280
我发觉你变了
I find you changed.

1148
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,020
事实上 我瞧不起你

1149
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:55,490
你无所事事 花家里的钱 追求女人

你并不是真心喜爱音乐
You aren't serious about music.

1151
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:02,230
我的作曲就像你的绘画
My compositions are like your paintings:

1152
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:05,430
抄袭别人天赋的二流作品
mediocre copies of another man's genius.

1153
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:10,570
你何不去伦敦找你祖父 做个有用的人
Then why don't you go to Grandfather in London and make yourself useful?

1154
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:15,180
我应该这样的 但你为什么来不纠正我？
I should. Why don't you reform me?

1155
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:21,190
我有个更实际的人
I've someone more practical in mind.

1156
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:23,990
你并不爱弗雷德·沃恩
You do not love Fred Vaughan.

1157
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:27,000
弗雷德·沃恩稳重又有礼...

1158
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:29,400
而且年收入四万
And has 40,000 a year.

1159
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,200
我一直都知道我是不会嫁给穷人的
I've always known I would not marry a pauper.

1160
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,410
我随时期待有人向我求婚
I expect a proposal any day.

1161
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:38,810
你会后悔的
You'll regret it.

1162
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,070
我会后悔的
I'll regret it.

1163
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:46,340
我想起一个承诺
I'm reminded of a promise.

1164
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,160
我是不是说过要在你死前吻你？
Didn't I say I would kiss you before you die?

1165
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,490
你有乔的消息吗？
Do you hear from Jo?

1166
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:58,430
她和一位德国教授做了朋友
She has befriended a German professor.

1167
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:05,640
没错 毫无疑问他正在教她...体验人生
Yes. No doubt he's showing her...the ways of the world.

1168
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:10,910
我不希望一个还爱着我姐姐的人来追求我!
I do not wish to be courted by someone who is still in love with my sister!

1169
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,850
我没有爱上乔
I'm not in love with Jo.

1170
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:16,920
那你怎么解释你的嫉妒呢?
Then how do you explain your jealousy?

1171
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:19,650
我羡慕她的幸福
I envy her happiness.

1172
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,730
我羡慕他的幸福
I envy his happiness.

1173
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,060
我羡慕约翰·布鲁克能娶梅格
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.

1174
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:29,400
我讨厌弗雷德·沃恩
I hate Fred Vaughan.

1175
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:33,060
如果贝丝有爱人 我也会讨厌他的
If Beth had a lover, I would despise him too.

1176
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:36,870
如同你一直知道 你不会嫁穷人...
Just as you have always known you would never marry a pauper...

1177
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:39,610
我则一直知道...
I have always known...

1178
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,680
我一定会成为马屈家的一员
I should be part of the March family.

1179
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:46,820
我不想因为我的家族而被爱
I do not wish to be loved for my family.

1180
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:51,350
就如同弗雷德也不想因为他年收入四万而被爱一样
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes to be loved for his 40,000 a year.

1181
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:09,710
小姐
Mademoiselle.

1182
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,510
谢谢
Mercy.

1183
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:20,400
我亲爱的艾米
My darling Amy.

1184
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:23,860
我要的是你 不是你的家族
It is you I want and not your family.

1185
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,330
我已前往伦敦 好让自己值得你尊敬
I've gone to London to make myself worthy of you.

1186
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:32,140
请别做出我们彼此会后悔的事
Please, do not do anything we shall regret.

1187
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:38,810
法门先生来访 小姐 我可以请他进来吗？
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle. May I show him in?

1188
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,430
佛德瑞克 你读了吗？
Friedrich, did you read it?

1189
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:58,300
读过了 写得很好 乔
Yes. It's well written, Jo.

1190
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:02,840
第一本小说 真是一项伟大的成就
And the first novel. What a great accomplishment.

1191
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:06,370
今天我要拿给你朋友出版商菲尔斯看
I'm going to be showing it to your publisher friend, Mr. Fields, today.

1192
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:08,250
他喜欢“罪人之尸”
He liked "The Sinner's Corpse."

1193
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,120
怎么了？
What is it?

1194
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:16,320
菲尔斯先生人很好 他会给你最忠实的意见
Mr. Fields is a good man. He will give you an honest opinion.

1195
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:19,600
哦 我明白了
Oh, I see.

1196
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,330
那你的忠实意见呢？
What is your honest opinion?

1197
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,930
我是个哲学教授
I'm a professor of philosophy.

1198
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:28,000
不 我想知道你的看法
No, I'd like to know what you think.

1199
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:35,010
你应该写你的生活...
You should be writing from life...

1200
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,340
写出自灵魂深处的东西
from the depths of your soul.

1201
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:41,090
你现在的作品没有那个我有幸了解的女人的任何东西
There is nothing in here of the woman that I am privileged to know.

1202
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,890
佛德瑞克 这就是我写的
Friedrich, this is what I write.

1203
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:51,300
我道歉 如果这无法达到你的高水准
My apologies if it fails to live up to your high standards.

1204
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:54,500
乔 你可以写的比这更好的...
Jo, there is more to you than this...

1205
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,440
如果你有勇气去写
if you have the courage to write it.

1206
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,350
梅格
Meg.

1207
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:47,690
乔
Jo.

1208
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:00,180
你为什么没告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

1209
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:02,510
这种事很难开口嘛
One hardly speaks of such things.

1210
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:04,980
哦 太好了
Oh, how wonderful.

1211
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:10,850
贝丝好吗？
How is Beth?

1212
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,990
你会发现她变了很多
You will find her much altered.

1213
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:32,940
妈咪
Marmee.

1214
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,630
她不让我们早点叫你回来
She wouldn't let us send for you sooner.

1215
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:43,150
医生来过好几次...
The doctor has been here a number of times...

1216
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:46,230
但是我们都无能为力了 我想...
but it's beyond all of us, and I think...

1217
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:53,370
我想她在等着你...
I think she's been waiting for you...

1218
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:14,390
贝丝...你得这些好喝的清汤全喝完
Beth...you're going to drink up all of this good broth.

1219
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:16,260
我很高兴你回家了
I'm glad you're home.

1220
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:18,670
我也是
So am I.

1221
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:37,830
“皮威克先生脸色一变
" Mr. Pickwick changed color.

1222
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:39,420
‘啊’ 瓦妥先生说
'Ah,' said Mr. Wartle.

1223
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:43,760
“嗯 这很重要 我想 那就没什么可疑的了”
'Well, that's important. There's nothing suspicious then, I suppose."'

1224
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:48,430
你在身边让我感觉更健康了
I feel stronger with you close by.

1225
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,370
我会让你好起来的
I'm going to get you better yet.

1226
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:59,250
如果上帝要我跟他走 没人阻挡得了他
If God wants me with Him, there is none who will stop Him.

1227
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:08,060
我不在意
I don't mind.

1228
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,520
我从来不像你们...
I was never like the rest of you...

1229
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:15,800
为重要的事做计划
making plans about the great things I'd do.

1230
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:21,730
我从来没有把自己看成什么了不起的人
I never saw myself as anything much.

1231
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:25,080
没想过要像你一样成为大作家
Not a great writer like you.

1232
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:28,140
贝丝 我不是什么大作家
Beth, I'm not a great writer.

1233
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:29,620
但你将来会是
But you will be.

1234
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,820
哦 乔 我好想念你
Oh, Jo, I've missed you so.

1235
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,170
为什么每个人都想离开？
Why does everyone want to go away?

1236
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,030
我喜欢待在家
I love being home.

1237
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:54,310
可我不喜欢被抛下
But I don't like being left behind.

1238
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,790
现在我是那个先走的人了
Now I am the one going ahead.

1239
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:08,320
我并不害怕
I am not afraid.

1240
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:13,400
我可以像你一样勇敢
I can be brave like you.

1241
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:21,740
但我知道我会为了你得思乡病...即使我在天堂
But I know I shall be homesick for you...even in heaven.

1242
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:26,010
不
No.

1243
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:29,010
我不让你走
I won't let you go.

1244
01:36:31,090 --> 01:36:32,750
哦 我的乔
Oh, my Jo.

1245
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:58,050
马屈姑婆卧病不起 无法承受海上旅行
Aunt March is bedridden and would not survive a sea voyage.

1246
01:38:58,330 --> 01:39:00,990
艾米必须等着 过一段时间才能回来
Amy must bide her time and return later.

1247
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,800
这样也好
It's just as well.

1248
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:11,010
我们会不会永远无法再团聚了？
Will we never all be together again?

1249
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,190
早晨愉快
Lovely morning.

1250
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,600
谢谢你 先生
Thank you, sir.

1251
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:19,150
最亲爱的罗利
Dearest Laurie:

1252
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:22,410
你可能还不知道关于贝丝的坏消息...
You may not have heard our sad news of Beth's...

1253
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:24,550
“梅格已分娩了...
" Meg has entered her confinement...

1254
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:27,690
可怜的艾米必须和马屈姑婆待在米维”
and poor Amy must stay in Vevey with Aunt March."

1255
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:40,840
这是一个人无法承受的巨大悲痛
This is far too great a sorrow to bear alone.

1256
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:43,510
请回来找我们 亲爱的泰迪
Please come home to us, Teddy dear.

1257
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,320
你的 忠实的乔
Your faithful, Jo.

1258
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:07,670
哦 罗利
Oh, Laurie.

1259
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:18,150
我就知道你会来的
I knew you would come.

1260
01:41:54,600 --> 01:42:02,270
贝丝

1261
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:29,840
钢琴的美丽浮现在贝丝快乐的脸庞...
The real charm of it lay in Beth's happy face ...

1262
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:35,240
当她靠在崭新的钢琴上...钟爱地触动美丽的黑白琴键
as she leaned over the new piano and lovingly ouched ... the beautiful black and white keys.

1263
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:42,450
接下来几分钟里 谣言四起...
During the next few minutes, the rumor circulated ...

1264
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,980
说艾米·马屈有24个可口的莱姆果
that Amy March had got 24 delicious limes.

1265
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:51,600
我跟你说过是她们替我打扮的 但我没说她们又是上粉又是束腰
I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they powdered and squeezed

1266
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:53,660
使我看来像是个时髦人物
and made me look a fashion plate.

1267
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:58,200
说完 乔拿下她的帽子
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.

1268
01:43:58,270 --> 01:44:02,940
四周一片大叫声 因为她茂密的秀发被剪短了
A general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.

1269
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:06,740
乔 你怎么可以？你可是个美人
Jo, how could you? You're one beauty.

1270
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,140
什么都不会改变的 乔
Nothing's going to change, Jo.

1271
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:17,960
为了大地的美丽 为了上天的荣耀
For the beauty of the earth，For the glory of the skies

1272
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:26,100
为了我们与生俱来的爱 我们躺在四周
For the love which from our birth. Over and around us lies

1273
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:32,640
万物之主 我们向您致敬
Lord of all to Thee we raise. This our hymn of grateful praise

1274
01:44:57,070 --> 01:44:59,870
“乔·马屈的小说”
"Jo March's novel."

1275
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:49,520
大惊喜！
Surprise!

1276
01:45:51,070 --> 01:45:53,660
约翰 你有女儿了
John, you have a daughter.

1277
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:55,530
还有一个儿子
And a son.

1278
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:02,000
哦 妈咪 我无法相信你生了四次
Oh, Marmee, I can't believe you did this four times.

1279
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:08,550
是这样 但可从没有一次生两个 亲爱的
Yes, but never two at once, my darling.

1280
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:29,980
哦 黛西
Oh, Daisy.

1281
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:34,770
哦 梅格 她真好看
Oh, Meg, she's so beautiful.

1282
01:46:35,190 --> 01:46:36,450
而他
And him.

1283
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:40,660
他很英俊 他长大后会像他爸爸
He is handsome. He's going to look just like his papa when he grows up.

1284
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:42,660
是的 他确实像约翰
Yes, he does look like John.

1285
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,790
你有那位教授的消息吗？
Have you heard from the professor?

1286
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:50,730
没有
No.

1287
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:55,470
我们分手得并不愉快
We did not part well.

1288
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:01,680
约翰和我也不总是意见一致 但我们之后都会解决的
John and I don't always agree, but then we mend it.

1289
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:04,750
那会是谁？
Who could that be?

1290
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,820
乔
Jo.

1291
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,430
哦 泰迪 太神奇了！
Oh, Teddy, this is magic!

1292
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:23,840
你简直是...
You are absolutely...

1293
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:25,040
裹在面粉里！
Covered in flour!

1294
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:27,370
哦 亲爱的！快进来
Oh, dear! Come in.

1295
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:29,500
不 乔 再等一下
No, Jo, not yet.

1296
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,170
我可以单独和你谈一下吗？
May I tell you something without the others?

1297
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:33,110
你是我最亲爱的朋友
You're my dear friend.

1298
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:35,980
我很高兴你第一个知道
I'm glad that you shall be the first to know.

1299
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:37,990
请让我介绍...
May I present...

1300
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:39,990
我妻子
my wife.

1301
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:44,450
乔
Jo.

1302
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:48,470
艾米

1303
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:49,530

Come in!

1306
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:08,090
毛织花边！哦！
Brussels lace! Oh!

1307
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,820
我前往欧洲画主教堂...
I went to Europe to paint the great cathedrals...

1308
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:13,230
但我无法忘怀我们家
but I couldn't get our home out of my mind.

1309
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:16,890
噢 看艾米是怎么捕捉果树园的风景的
Oh, look how Amy has captured Orchard House.

1310
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:17,830
漂亮
Lovely.

1311
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:20,170
哦 真美丽
Oh, it's beautiful.

1312
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:22,170
没有我想的那么漂亮
Not as beautiful as I wanted,

1313
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:23,640
不过我还在学习
but I am still learning.

1314
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:28,980
亲爱的小天使
Dear little angel.

1315
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:35,120
乔 你得告诉我 身为姐妹...
Jo, you must tell me the truth, as a sister...

1316
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:37,390
这关系强过婚姻
which is a relation stronger than marriage.

1317
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:39,990
你一点都不在意吗？
Do you mind at all?

1318
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,060
哦 不！
Oh, no.

1319
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,670
我很惊讶
I was surprised.

1320
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:50,200
要知道 我有可靠证据证明我们的泰迪…永远不会爱上别人
Mind you, I had it on good authority that our Teddy...would never love another.

1321
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,940
而如今他却结婚了
And now he's gone and gotten married.

1322
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:54,740
很高兴再听见你叫我泰迪
It's good to hear you call me Teddy again.

1323
01:48:59,350 --> 01:49:02,690
最后 我们都是一家人 我们应该一直都是这样
At last, we're all family, as we always should have been.

1324
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:07,350
你得答应我会一直住在附近
You must promise me that you will always live close by.

1325
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:09,950
我不能再失去一个妹妹了
I couldn't bear losing another sister.

1326
01:49:26,450 --> 01:49:28,850
乔 天气又阴又冷
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.

1327
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:33,120
光是给这个地方取暖的煤就需要一大笔收入
One would require an income just for the coal to heat this place.

1328
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:36,060
这亲爱的老姑娘到底在想什么呢?
What could the dear old girl have been thinking?

1329
01:49:36,330 --> 01:49:38,520
她很可能是同情我
Most likely she felt sorry for me.

1330
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,730
这无家可归的老处女!
Decrepit homeless spinster!

1331
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:44,930
哦 可怜的姑婆
Oh, poor Aunt.

1332
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:47,660
这些年独自住在这
Living here all those years alone

1333
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,740
无用的老房子里
in this useless old house.

1334
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:54,410
没错 她的福气成为负担了 因为没人能分享
Yes, her blessings became a burden because she couldn't share them.

1335
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,680
这不是一所很棒的学校吗?
Wouldn't this have made a wonderful school?

1336
01:49:57,890 --> 01:49:59,220
一所学校
A school.

1337
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:04,150
这会是多大的挑战啊
What a challenge that would be.

1338
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,710
哈啰 塔比 哈啰
Hello, Tuppy. Hello.

1339
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:31,180
好孩子
Good boy.

1340
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:39,660
佛德瑞克·贝尔教授 威佛利路 11号

1341
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:41,930
“《小妇人》 乔·马屈著”

1342
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:44,200
我的书！
My book!

1343
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:46,940
有人出版了我的书
Someone's publishing my book.

1344
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:51,210
有人出版了我的书！
Someone's publishing my book!

1345
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,610
上帝帮忙！
Heaven help us!

1346
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:54,550
来时没有信 它是怎么送到的？
It came with no letter. How did it arrive?

1347
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:57,610
一个外国绅士拿来的 很奇怪的名字
Foreign gentleman brought it. Strange kind of name.

1348
01:50:57,690 --> 01:51:00,950
想不起来了 哦 他叫 福克斯 还是贝儿什么的
Can't think of it. Oh, Fox, or Bear or such.

1349
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:03,080
是拜尔！ 你有让他等一下吗？
Bhaer! Did you ask him to wait?

1350
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:07,760
我还以为他是某个带着结婚礼物的艾米小姐的欧洲朋友
I thought he was one of Miss Amy's European friends coming with a wedding gift.

1351
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:11,960
我说 “马屈小姐和罗利先生住在隔壁”
I said, " Miss March and Mr. Laurie are living next door."

1352
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:13,030
汉娜 你不会吧！
Hannah, you didn't!

1353
01:51:13,110 --> 01:51:15,770
然后他说他要赶火车
Then he said he had a train to catch.

1354
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:31,990
佛德瑞克！
Friedrich!

1355
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:49,080
哦 佛德瑞克 谢谢你带来我的书
Oh, Friedrich, thank you for my book.

1356
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:54,540
当我没有你消息的时候...
When I didn't hear from you...

1357
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:56,550
我以为你讨厌这本书
I thought you hated it.

1358
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,090
哦 不
Oh, no.

1359
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:03,090
读你的书就像打开一扇进入你心房的窗
Reading your book was like opening a window into your heart.

1360
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:07,360
詹姆斯·菲尔斯从我手中取走 就不愿还给我了
James Fields took it out of my hands, and he would not give it back to me.

1361
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:11,100
我说“这种消息我得亲自告诉她”
I said, "Such news I have to give to her myself."

1362
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:15,770
这个 这是个愚蠢的冲动
Well, it was a silly impulse.

1363
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:18,980
不 不 一点也不愚蠢
No, not silly at all.

1364
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:22,650
很高兴见到你
It's so good to see you.

1365
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:25,120
来见见我的家人
Come and meet my family.

1366
01:52:25,190 --> 01:52:26,320
不 我...
No, I...

1367
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:28,390
谢谢 不过...
Thank you, but...

1368
01:52:29,190 --> 01:52:31,190
我得赶火车了
I have to catch a train.

1369
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:34,660
我要到西部去
I am going to the West.

1370
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:38,060
我的船明早由波士顿启航
My ship leaves from Boston tomorrow morning.

1371
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:43,530
是的 西部的学校都很新
Yes, the schools in the West are young.

1372
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,870
他们需要教授 而且...
They need professors and...

1373
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:50,880
他们不那么在乎口音
they are not so concerned about the accent.

1374
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:55,020
我也不在意
I don't mind it either.

1375
01:52:57,430 --> 01:53:00,880
你知道 我的姑婆把果树园留给我了
See, my aunt left me Plumfield.

1376
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:03,160
它不是个果园 它是栋房子 事实上
It isn't a field. It's a house, actually.

1377
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:04,960
一个相当大的房子
A rather large house.

1378
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:09,230
除了拿来当学校什么也不适合...
And it isn't really good for anything except a school...

1379
01:53:09,310 --> 01:53:10,970
我要一所好学校...
and I want a good school...

1380
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:13,770
一个对任何想学习的人都开放的地方 还有…
one that would be open to anyone who wanted to learn, and, well...

1381
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:19,780
我需要一位懂得教学的人
I'll be needing someone who knows how to teach.

1382
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:23,920
我能说什么让你留在这里吗?
Is there nothing I might say to keep you here?

1383
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:31,520
我承认我期盼有个理由能留下来 但是...
I confess that I was hoping that I might have a reason to stay, but...

1384
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:35,730
恭喜你的结婚庆典
congratulations on the celebration of your marriage.

1385
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:40,800
哦 不！不 那是艾米
Oh, no! No, that's Amy.

请不要离开
Please don't go so far away.

1389
01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:55,890
乔
Jo.

1390
01:53:56,290 --> 01:54:00,630
如此平凡的名字...却配给了这样不平凡的一个人
Such a little name for...for such a person.

1391
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,960
你愿意拥有我吗？
Will you have me?

1392
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:09,440
全心全意！
With all of my heart!

1393
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:17,180
但我没有什么可以给你 我两手空空
But I have nothing to give you. My hands are empty.

1394
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:21,860
现在不空了
Not empty now.
