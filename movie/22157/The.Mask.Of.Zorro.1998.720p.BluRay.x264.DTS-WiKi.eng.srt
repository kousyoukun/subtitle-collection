1
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:44,187
Come on, Alejandro, it is my turn.
Let me see.

2
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,761
Hey! What are you doing
cutting holes in my wagon?

3
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:21,557
Sorry, Señor Lopez.
We were just waiting for Zorro.

4
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:25,061
-Go home, muchachos.
-Do you think he's going to come?

5
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,189
Someone thinks he will.

6
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,404
Joaquin, Alejandro, once I carved
coffins for your mother and father.

7
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,867
I would hate to carve ones for you.
Now, go!

8
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:56,092
Alejandro, Joaquin, this is no place
for you. Get back to the mission.

9
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,648
Don Montero, for the love of God,
why are you still here?

10
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,068
Now, now, Don Luiz. Calm, calm.

11
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,489
Santa Anna's men are three miles
from the town. You have to go now.

12
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:05,161
The government of Spain would like
to thank you for your devoted service.

13
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,505
This land is the property
of the Spanish government.

14
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,884
In two hours it will be the property
of the Mexican government...

15
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,928
...unless I hand them over to you.

16
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,389
I am well acquainted with Santa Anna.
He will realize that the dons...

17
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,851
...will be dutiful taxpayers
and he will respect your claims.

18
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,646
The rest of Alta California
I have divided equally...

19
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:36,525
...among the other dons. Make sure
that all of them receive their grants.

20
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,409
Get the children out of the plaza
immediately.

21
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,582
The children should never have to see
the things we do.

22
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,212
I want to see! Put me down.

23
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,055
Zorro?

24
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:16,607
I saw him. I saw Zorro. Come on.

25
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,165
Who are these men that you would
risk your life to have killed?

26
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,543
Who are they? No idea.

27
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,045
Three peasants pulled at random
from the crowd.

28
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,187
Where is he?

29
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,332
Go.

30
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,877
Come on.

31
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,546
My thanks to you, gentlemen.

32
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:55,182
Now, if you will excuse me,
I'm missing my own party.

33
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,617
Kill him!

34
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,766
You would murder three innocent men
to capture me?

35
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,478
I would murder 100 innocent men
if it meant killing you.

36
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:50,946
Three men, three cuts.
A small memento of Mexico, Rafael.

37
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,240
To remind you not to return.

38
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:40,556
Tornado, my old friend,
you are getting too old for this.

39
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,058
Yes, me too.

40
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,961
Is she warm enough?

41
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,548
I always put on an
extra blanket for you, Señor.

42
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,755
But the good prince was not afraid
of the evil king.

43
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,633
He raced across the drawbridge,
fighting off 100 guards.

44
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,678
And then, looking very handsome
and dashing in the late-afternoon sun...

45
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,349
...he leapt onto the balcony
and thrust his enchanted sword...

46
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,767
...under the king's chin.

47
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,231
"You would kill three innocent men
just to capture me?"

48
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,108
"Yes."

49
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:20,322
Then suddenly lightning flashed
and thunder shocked the wasted land.

50
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,327
The evil king glared
at the good prince and said....

51
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,082
Something very forgettable.

52
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,751
And the good prince,
what did he do?

53
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:38,966
Well, he leapt from the balcony
onto his faithful old steed, Tornado...

54
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,511
...and raced home to his
beautiful wife, Esperanza...

55
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,264
...and to his little child, Elena.

56
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,560
Never to do anything
so foolish or dangerous again.

57
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,771
She loves to hear your stories.

58
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,025
It's only the sound of my voice.

59
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,611
One day she will have
no time for them.

60
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,532
I never tire of them.
Why should she?

61
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,875
Esperanza.

62
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,050
She already has your strength.

63
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:26,013
Today she broke the little clay horse
you made for her.

64
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,098
Diego.

65
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,517
It's just a scratch.

66
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,936
Diego, you promised me.

67
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,982
No more nights waiting up
praying you come home alive.

68
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,571
The Spaniards are going home.
Today is Zorro's last ride.

69
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:47,493
From now on we will grow
old together with our five children.

70
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,914
-Five?
-Yeah. Not enough?

71
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,917
I love you.

72
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,641
Doña de la Vega,
still as beautiful as ever.

73
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:17,147
Don Rafael, what an honor.
The governor in my home.

74
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:22,819
-You'll stay for dinner, of course.
-I have come to apologize, Esperanza.

75
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:27,741
I'm sorry that I could not protect
this country from the peasants.

76
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,953
I'm sorry that I couldn't
make you love me.

77
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,456
And I'm sorry that I have
to leave you without a husband.

78
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,625
Arrest him.

79
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,938
Blood never lies, Zorro.

80
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:04,570
You are a traitor to your country
and your class. Take him away.

81
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,411
Wait.

82
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,700
-No!
-No!

83
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,848
I would never have let
any harm come to her.

84
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,142
She was never yours to protect.

85
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,564
Elena.

86
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,744
I want you to live
with the knowledge...

87
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,288
...that you have lost everything
that you hold dear.

88
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,168
I want you to suffer
as I have suffered...

89
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,587
...knowing that your child
should have been mine.

90
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,276
Elena! Elena!

91
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,336
Let me hold her.

92
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,506
Let me hold her!

93
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,759
Rafael!

94
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,887
She has her mother's eyes.

95
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,776
Rafael! You'll never be rid of me!

96
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,733
Stayed on their track
Bringing them back

97
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:35,071
So pay the bounty now to me
'Cause....

98
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,663
'Cause...?

99
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,333
-Nobody's tough as Jack
-Nobody's tough as Jack

100
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,085
-Nobody's tough as Jack
-Nobody's tough as Jack

101
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,799
Now you're getting there.
Like I done told you...

102
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,968
...singing can lighten
your terrible load.

103
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,324
Hey, hey, hey!

104
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:24,704
Come one, come all,
for the fright of your life.

105
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:31,086
See the notorious Murrieta brothers.
Robbers, horse thieves...

106
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:37,300
...bandits, people of the worst sort.
Hey! Get out here.

107
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,599
Garcia. The Murrieta brothers.

108
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,813
Get over here.

109
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,121
These men are now in the custody
of Corporal Armando Garcia.

110
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,290
We will take them
the rest of the way.

111
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:13,169
-Claim your bounty in Tlaxco.
-When bulls start wearing bloomers.

112
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,964
How much are we worth?

113
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:21,386
All figured, about 200 pesos.

114
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:27,309
Two hundred pesos? That's it?
A lousy 200 pesos apiece?

115
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,646
-We are wasting time.
-That's 200 for the both of you.

116
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,609
What? Are you crazy?
Don't take it, Jack.

117
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,032
Touch my brother again,
and I'll kill you.

118
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,409
Yes, he will.

119
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,080
Hey, I thought you were tied up.

120
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,334
That's because you're stupid.

121
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,008
Drop it. Drop it.

122
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,221
Hey.

123
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:12,312
-They got a strongbox on the wagon.
-We know. That's why we came.

124
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,446
It is a fact that I, the legendary
Three-Fingered Jack...

125
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,699
...ain't even mentioned.
I ain't even mentioned.

126
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:30,038
Ain't I the one that figured to kidnap
the mayor from his own outhouse?

127
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:34,376
I tell you, I am the holy guts
of this gang.

128
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,046
Without me,
the whole dang opera falls apart.

129
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,514
Go. Go.

130
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,725
Come on. Get up, get up.

131
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,689
Go.

132
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,151
Go.

133
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,967
I want you to know
I consider this an honor.

134
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:43,713
Bury the body. Bag the head.

135
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,901
Of course I have feelings for you.

136
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:53,116
Yes, yes, but quick.
Hide in the barn.

137
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,076
He's coming.

138
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,251
What do you want?
Please don't touch me.

139
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,212
What do you want? Who are you?

140
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,430
Don Rafael!

141
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,985
Listen to me.

142
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,822
If any of you is, or ever was...

143
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,993
...that masked man all dressed
in black known as Zorro...

144
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,955
...reveal himself now.

145
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,458
I'm Zorro!

146
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:31,005
-They took my mask, my sword--
-Silence, you old fool!

147
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:36,135
I am Zorro! I am the man you want.
I am the original--

148
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:41,015
Liar! Anyone can see
you are too tall.

149
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:30,648
Get him out of here
before he starts to stink.

150
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,376
Did you find him?

151
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,715
He's dead.

152
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,094
Back to the boat. I need some sleep
before landing tomorrow.

153
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,870
The governor has returned!

154
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,672
Luiz.

155
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,093
Welcome home, Rafael.
It has been too long.

156
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,387
Too long, my friend.

157
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,308
You said once
you favored me above all.

158
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:14,562
Consider this a fool's apology
for ever doubting you.

159
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:25,239
Come. A crowd has
gathered to greet you.

160
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,288
-Don Pedro.
-Don Rafael, welcome.

161
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,165
-You're looking well.
-Thank you.

162
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,917
-Don Hector.
-Welcome back, sir.

163
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,753
Don Julio.

164
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,380
Gentlemen.

165
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,015
Please, please.

166
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,061
I know you are not
really happy to see me...

167
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:58,606
...so let us all stop pretending,
shall we?

168
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,776
You think I don't know
that you have been paid...

169
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:05,571
...even threatened, to come out
in the hot sun and greet me?

170
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,201
I understand exactly how you feel.

171
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:15,122
Why should you care about any
of your leaders, past or present?

172
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,625
What did they ever do for you?

173
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,796
The Spaniards oppressed you,
the Mexicans ignored you.

174
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:25,841
And the dons?
Well, the dons, the dons.

175
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:31,138
The dons seem merely content
to cheat and lie to you.

176
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:38,020
In fact, I put it to you. Who, in your
entire history, has ever helped you?

177
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:42,650
Zorro! Zorro fought for the people.

178
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,366
Yes, Zorro.

179
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:54,829
Where is he now, Padre,
your masked friend?

180
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:58,708
Unless I am mistaken, he hasn't
shown himself in 20 years.

181
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,502
Twenty years!

182
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,505
People of California...

183
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:08,175
...the time has come to take
our destiny into our own hands.

184
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:14,015
Not as Spaniards, not as Mexicans,
but as Californians.

185
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:25,192
I stand here before you today
with no mask.

186
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,324
Only a pledge, a solemn pledge
that I will never abandon you.

187
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,286
And you have my word,
the word of Rafael Montero...

188
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,706
...that I will do everything within
my power to help you fight...

189
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,751
...for a free and independent
California!

190
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,764
Father.

191
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,398
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce my daughter, Elena.

192
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,991
Thank you.

193
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,579
Can anyone tell me what
this flower is? I know this scent.

194
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,499
It's called romneya.

195
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,417
But it only grows in California...

196
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,420
...and I believe this is your first visit
to our shores.

197
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,214
Yes.

198
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,912
Hey, hey, hey. More whiskey.

199
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:05,209
Or whatever you call this. I don't
want to see the bottom of this glass.

200
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,711
Money first.

201
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,754
Money first.

202
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,842
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

203
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,514
-What about this?
-Silver!

204
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,685
Of course, silver. The finest.

205
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,820
-Where did you get that?
-It's none of your business.

206
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,906
Where did you get it?

207
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,162
It was my brother's.

208
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,123
He is dead.

209
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,087
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

210
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,590
Why should you be sorry?

211
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,261
You should not trade it
for a mere glass of whiskey.

212
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,390
Why not?
You think I could get two?

213
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,232
Who is that?

214
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,615
-The man who killed my brother.
-You're drunk and angry...

215
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,076
...in no condition to fight
a professional soldier.

216
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,747
Get out of my way, old man.

217
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,237
Would you care to try again?

218
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,365
You're welcome.

219
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,912
-For what?
-For saving your life.

220
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:13,838
-I would have killed him.
-No, not today. He is trained to kill.

221
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,756
You seem trained to drink.

222
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:19,009
You would have fought very bravely
and died very quickly.

223
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,637
Who then would
avenge your brother?

224
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,307
I would have found a way.

225
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:29,436
-I have never lost a fight.
-Except to a crippled old man just now.

226
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,650
-What is your name?
-Alejandro.

227
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,610
Alejandro.

228
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,365
You know,
there is a very old saying:

229
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,868
"When the pupil is ready,
the master will appear."

230
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,787
If you want to kill this man
I can teach you how.

231
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,874
How to move, how to think,
how to take your revenge with honor.

232
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,128
And live to celebrate it.
It will take dedication and time.

233
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,131
Why are you so eager to help me?

234
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:01,302
Because once, a long time ago...

235
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,306
...you did the same for me.

236
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,402
I can't believe it.

237
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:25,117
I never thought that, one day, I would
be standing in the lair of the fox.

238
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,036
In the lair of Zorro.

239
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,208
This place was devoted
to the training of Zorro.

240
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:39,048
Where were you all these years?
I thought you were dead.

241
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:44,887
I was dead.
And we will leave it at that.

242
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:57,149
I remember the last time I saw you.
You were fighting a hundred men.

243
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,026
-A hundred men?
-I do not forget.

244
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:03,238
You were the greatest swordsman
who ever lived. Yes.

245
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:07,159
Rafael Montero was
the governor of California then.

246
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,703
Do you remember him?

247
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,206
What?

248
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,710
Rafael Montero.
Do you remember him?

249
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:20,881
Yes. His soldiers killed many.

250
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:25,803
And he was the sworn enemy
of Zorro. You.

251
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,724
-Montero has come back.
-Good. Then you can kill him.

252
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:35,312
No, there are too many complications
for me to ignore.

253
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,733
What complications?

254
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,368
I can see we are not gonna
spend much time talking.

255
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,747
Montero has some design
for California...

256
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:57,751
...otherwise he would not have
retained the services of Captain Love.

257
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:02,297
-We must find out what that is.
-And then what?

258
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:07,261
If you are ready,
we will both tempt our fates.

259
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,304
Let's go, then.

260
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,978
Do you know how to use that thing?

261
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:19,189
Yes. The pointy end
goes into the other man.

262
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,113
This is going to take a lot of work.

263
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,910
This is called a training circle.
The master's wheel.

264
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:36,206
This circle will be your world,
your whole life.

265
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,460
Till I tell you otherwise,
there is nothing outside of it.

266
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,964
-Captain Love--
-There is nothing outside of it.

267
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:48,302
Captain Love does not exist
until I say he exists.

268
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:59,271
As your skill improves you will
progress to a smaller circle.

269
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,983
Each new circle brings you
that much closer to your adversary.

270
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,069
That much closer to retribution.

271
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,991
-I like that part.
-Shall we?

272
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:36,850
Slow. Attack slow. Attack.

273
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,937
Slow. Again. Slow.

274
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:44,900
First triangle. Slowly. Good.

275
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,403
-Good. That is good.
-Thank you.

276
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,864
Attack.

277
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,036
Good.

278
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,873
Time for a drink.

279
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,428
Perfect. Do it again.

280
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,657
One, five, three!

281
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,785
Six, four, two!

282
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,371
And lunge.

283
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,331
Over-lunge!

284
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,887
Lesson number one:
Never attack in anger.

285
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,311
Lesson number two:

286
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,605
Come with me.

287
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,317
What?

288
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:27,878
-So, what is lesson number three?
-To get to lesson number four.

289
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,150
Again?

290
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:17,636
-Black Andalusian. Magnificent.
-It looks like your old horse, Tornado.

291
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,719
Quiet, quiet.

292
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:15,402
Damned horse. What are you
doing, huh? What are you doing?

293
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,864
I'll see you tonight.

294
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,556
Zorro, you look better than ever.

295
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:15,796
Be careful, señorita,
there are dangerous men about.

296
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:20,842
Well, if you see any,
be sure to point them out.

297
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,797
Listen. I'm going to give you
the great honor...

298
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,592
...of being my horse.

299
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:04,237
We are like one spirit.

300
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:12,245
Damn it! Stop!

301
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,304
Go, go, go!

302
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:45,213
Get him!

303
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,750
Kill him.

304
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:26,332
Zorro! The legend has returned!

305
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,081
Don't yell.

306
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,378
I need sanctuary, Father.
You don't know me--

307
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,006
Zorro! Of course I know you.

308
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:20,136
Zorro, is it really you? The years
have been kinder to you than to me.

309
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:26,142
I have no time to talk now.
Father, please, hide me.

310
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,560
Come.

311
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,734
It's just like the old days.

312
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,078
Padre, is that you?

313
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,415
Is everything all right? It sounds
like there is a battle going on.

314
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:55,880
Don't worry, my dear. You are safe
in the house of the Lord.

315
00:52:56,048 --> 00:53:00,426
Of course, Padre.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

316
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,679
It has been three days
since my last confession.

317
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,765
How many sins could you
have committed in three days?

318
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,935
Come back when you have
more time, please.

319
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:14,190
-Excuse me?
-Listen, señorita....

320
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:20,363
Please, go on.

321
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:25,827
-I broke the Fourth Commandment.
-You killed somebody?

322
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:31,457
-That's not the Fourth Commandment.
-Of course not.

323
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:38,214
In what way did you break
the most sacred of Commandments?

324
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,301
I dishonored my father.

325
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:45,305
That is not so bad.
Maybe your father deserved it.

326
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:51,895
-What did you say?
-I said, tell me more, my child.

327
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:57,275
Well, I try to behave properly,
the way my father would like me to.

328
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:01,529
-But I'm afraid my heart is too wild.
-Too wild?

329
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:06,492
-Yes.
-Could you be more specific?

330
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,203
I had impure thoughts about a man.

331
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:13,833
I did. I think he was a bandit
or something. He wore a black mask.

332
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:21,799
-He had a deep voice?
-Yes.

333
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:28,806
-Ruggedly handsome?
-His face was half-covered.

334
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,060
But something in his eyes
captured me.

335
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,686
Captured you.

336
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:38,858
I felt warm and feverish.

337
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,735
Lustful?

338
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,240
Yes, lustful.

339
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:50,495
Forgive me.

340
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:57,210
I forgive you.

341
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,967
Look over there, by the altar.

342
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:11,849
Search everything. The chapel,
the loft, the rectory, all of it.

343
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,560
This is a house of God.

344
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:18,356
Don't worry, Padre, we'll be gone
by the time he gets back.

345
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:24,654
Señorita,
you have done nothing wrong.

346
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:29,450
The only sin would be to deny
what your heart truly feels.

347
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,370
Now, go.

348
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,333
Elena.

349
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,383
-What are you doing here?
-I was confessing.

350
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:47,760
-Confessing?
-Yes.

351
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:51,097
To whom? The priest is here.

352
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:58,271
Stand back, Elena. Please.

353
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:22,128
Out of respect for Miss Montero,
I'll deal with you later.

354
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,805
Horse! Come here.

355
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:42,940
Blackie! Thunder! Storm!

356
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,694
Stupido! Get over here now!

357
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:53,534
I warn you. I'll get another horse.

358
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,521
So?

359
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,565
What do you think?

360
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:16,033
Sir, I got the black stallion,
I carved a "Z" in the--

361
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,621
The people will be speaking
the name of Zorro again.

362
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:27,295
You think stealing a horse makes you
worthy enough to wear that mask?

363
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,257
Be careful.

364
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:39,015
You're a thief, Alejandro.
A pitiful clown.

365
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:42,935
Zorro was a servant of the people,
not a seeker of fame like you.

366
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:45,771
A buffoon.

367
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,069
-Zorro did what was needed.
-Now he is needed again.

368
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:57,116
I didn't ask for your help
in the cantina...

369
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:01,662
...but I came here
to learn how to fight like you.

370
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:05,333
To have your strength,
your courage.

371
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,629
Now when I try to use them,
you slap me down?

372
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:15,384
Let me tell you something. I am tired
of all your training, your lecturing.

373
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:20,264
I am tired of waiting for you
to tell me I am ready.

374
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:25,978
I have my own scores to settle,
a new life to find.

375
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:31,984
I thought I could do it here,
but I was wrong.

376
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,488
Alejandro!

377
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:37,657
En garde!

378
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,829
Choose your weapon.

379
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:08,187
Montero has invited every don
in California to a banquet.

380
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:13,025
If you want to be of service,
you can join them as a spy.

381
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:17,571
I think I do not understand, sir.

382
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,325
You have passion, Alejandro,
and your skill is growing.

383
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:25,746
But I must give you something
which is beyond your reach.

384
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:31,168
-Yes? What is that?
-Charm.

385
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,879
And what is that?

386
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,220
Convince Montero that you are
a gentleman of stature...

387
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,140
...and he will let you into his circle.

388
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,312
Me?

389
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,481
A gentleman?

390
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,694
This is gonna take a lot of work.

391
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,531
Yes.

392
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,927
Look at me. I look like a butterfly.

393
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,305
This is the most stupid thing
I've ever done.

394
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:27,099
-I doubt that.
-We'll never get away with this.

395
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,060
Yes, we will.

396
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:34,440
A nobleman is a man who says
one thing and thinks another.

397
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,609
What if Montero realizes who you are?

398
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:39,779
Montero thinks of himself
as a true nobleman.

399
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:44,450
He will never look a servant
in the eye. Listen to me.

400
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,786
Listen to me!

401
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,290
Most important thing of all...

402
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,293
...do not let the dons
leave the table without you.

403
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,128
Yes, sir.

404
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:01,634
-Good luck tonight.
-Thank you.

405
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:06,263
Stand up straight. Charm.

406
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,140
Charm.

407
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:29,537
Don Rafael Montero?
Good evening.

408
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,623
I am Don Alejandro
del Castillo y Garcia.

409
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:37,670
The formal Spanish greeting.
I have not seen that in years.

410
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:42,508
-My father was very strict.
-Who is your father?

411
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,552
Don Bartolo del Castillo.

412
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:48,848
I have heard of him, but never had
the pleasure of meeting him.

413
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:55,020
I arrived last week from Spain by way
of Paris, Lisbon and San Francisco.

414
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,274
I am inspecting
my family's holdings.

415
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:08,200
Queen Isabella of Spain
has been very generous to us.

416
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:12,705
Very impressive.
What brings you here?

417
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:17,418
I heard you were back in California
and knew I must introduce myself.

418
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:20,045
Her Royal Highness
speaks very highly of you.

419
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,550
Really?

420
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:29,847
I thought I fell out of favor with
the court when California was lost.

421
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,981
Only in certain circles.

422
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:43,694
Her Majesty knows those unfortunate
events were clearly no fault of yours.

423
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:49,909
She told me this is still a land
of opportunity for a man of vision.

424
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:56,290
-And you are a man of vision?
-I am a man in search of a vision.

425
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,297
But my timing is unfortunate.
I have interrupted a party.

426
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,424
Perhaps I could call again?

427
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,845
No, it would honor me
for you to join us.

428
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,849
No, it would honor me to do so, sir.

429
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,728
Please allow me to introduce
my daughter, Elena.

430
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,776
Charmed.

431
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,783
I'm afraid I have brought no gift
for the hostess...

432
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:34,245
...but wait a moment.

433
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:49,134
-Thank you.
-A pleasure.

434
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:58,769
Bernardo, pick up your feet.
Señorita. Caballero.

435
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,589
Don Alejandro.

436
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,633
My father and I would like you
to join us at our table.

437
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,679
I would be delighted, señorita.

438
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:49,194
Don Alejandro, I'm so pleased
you could join us.

439
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,990
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.

440
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,659
Recently returned from Spain.

441
01:05:55,869 --> 01:06:02,291
This is Captain Harrison Love.
Not a don, but a kindred spirit.

442
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:08,589
Are you not the man who was
chasing a legendary bandit recently?

443
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:12,259
-He was hardly legendary.
-So you caught him?

444
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:18,223
-It's only a matter of time.
-The bandit may have escaped...

445
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:23,562
...but the rest of us will think twice
before going to confession.

446
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:48,921
Thank you.

447
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,760
With all due respect, Don Hector,
I disagree.

448
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,930
Until these people are free
to govern themselves...

449
01:06:58,098 --> 01:07:01,684
... I think we will see
many more Z's carved into walls.

450
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:07,398
Don Alejandro, what do you think?

451
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:12,361
I think sheep will
always need a shepherd.

452
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:17,783
But certainly not this Zorro creature.

453
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:23,747
He probably wears the mask to hide
his bald head and unsightly features.

454
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:31,463
-Some would call him heroic.
-Heroism, a romantic illusion.

455
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:34,967
-Much like nobility.
-Elena, that is enough.

456
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:38,887
I would think heroism is something
to aspire to, not sneer at.

457
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:43,809
All that playing swords, shooting guns,
racing around on horses...

458
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,644
...gives me a frightful headache.

459
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:49,732
Such sweaty pursuits are hardly
the work of a gentleman.

460
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,901
And what is?
Climbing in and out of carriages?

461
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,862
No, my dear.

462
01:07:55,029 --> 01:08:00,659
But increasing one's holdings so as
to provide lavish comfort for ladies.

463
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,162
Such as yourself.

464
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:12,254
A woman's grasp of politics.
What can I say?

465
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:21,889
We're at a party, aren't we?
May I have the honor of this dance?

466
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,602
I would be glad to.

467
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,653
Yes? Were you looking
for something?

468
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,365
A sense of the miraculous
in everyday life.

469
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:27,788
Oh, really? Look someplace else.
The lady and I were trying to dance.

470
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:33,168
You were trying.
She was succeeding.

471
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:37,798
Forgive me, captain.
A shameless joke at your expense.

472
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:43,929
I hope it will not be the last.
Don Rafael wants you back. Now.

473
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:34,980
Should we try something more robust,
or do you feel unequal to the task?

474
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,649
No, on the contrary.

475
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:42,487
I think only of your distaste
for perspiration.

476
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,114
Maestro.

477
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:14,329
Well, that is the way they are dancing
in Madrid these days.

478
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,499
Excuse me, Don Rafael,
I need to catch my breath.

479
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:20,752
Your daughter is
a very spirited dancer.

480
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,757
"Spirited." Thank you
for putting it so delicately.

481
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:32,139
I apologize if you're offended.

482
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:35,851
No, no, no.
Completely unnecessary, I assure you.

483
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:40,313
She is young and impulsive,
but her beauty is beyond compare.

484
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:43,942
And she has her father's
commanding presence.

485
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,946
Don Rafael.

486
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:55,996
As an advisor to Her Royal Highness
in matters of finance...

487
01:12:56,164 --> 01:13:00,417
...it would be my pleasure
to introduce you both at court.

488
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:14,306
Join us in the courtyard. There is
something I want to share with you.

489
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,099
What is that?

490
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:18,643
A vision.

491
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,822
Fellow dons of California...

492
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:35,827
...all of us can recall the golden years
when we ruled this country.

493
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:40,749
We commanded respect
and amassed a great deal of wealth.

494
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,168
But there was something
that we never achieved.

495
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:46,838
We never determined
our own destiny.

496
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:54,513
Well, the time has come to claim
what always should have been ours.

497
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,557
My friends...

498
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:04,064
... I give you the independent
Republic of California.

499
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:22,415
Don Rafael, every man here
owes you something.

500
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,377
The land you gave us
made us all wealthy men.

501
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:30,132
However, we must question
your motives.

502
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,468
The day you arrived,
you made us look like fools.

503
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,013
That is absurd, Don Pedro.
I was merely playing to the crowd.

504
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:40,642
And what are you doing now
if not playing to the crowd?

505
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:44,938
You're inciting us to raise arms
against Santa Anna.

506
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:48,191
You know perfectly well
we could never defeat his army.

507
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:52,028
I was not suggesting that
we fight him for California.

508
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:55,073
I was suggesting that
we buy it from him.

509
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,785
Santa Anna is waging an expensive
war with the United States...

510
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:00,787
...and is increasingly
short of money.

511
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,999
Even if we all combined
our fortunes...

512
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:07,669
...we could not come up with enough
to buy this country from Santa Anna.

513
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,672
I have already
brokered a deal with him.

514
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:14,259
You are living in a dream.

515
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:20,307
And why don't we all live
in the same dream together?

516
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:37,782
Meet me here tomorrow morning
for a journey...

517
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,620
...that will open your eyes
and lay all your doubts to rest.

518
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:39,761
My friends, I give you El Dorado!

519
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:53,525
Technically, of course,
all this gold belongs to Santa Anna...

520
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:57,821
...but, fortunately for us, he's
completely unaware of its existence.

521
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:00,824
For the deception to work,
these bars have been marked...

522
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:03,952
...with the Spanish seal
so he'll think they're from Spain.

523
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,540
You see now, gentlemen?
Is it becoming clearer to you?

524
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:13,461
Two days from now we will buy
this country from Santa Anna.

525
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,673
We will buy it with gold
dug from his own land.

526
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:32,981
-Where did you find all these people?
-Anywhere we wanted.

527
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,567
Brilliant.

528
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:38,403
Brilliant.

529
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:44,242
It's only part of the mining process.

530
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,746
First we picked it up off the ground,
now we're down to blasting.

531
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:07,098
So this is the future of California?

532
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:11,770
This is my vision, yes.

533
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:19,694
Up here. Well, now,
ain't you a sight for sore eyes!

534
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:25,116
Full-grown vultures
walking around like real folk.

535
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:29,037
Welcome.
Welcome to hell's outhouse.

536
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:35,710
They call us the disappeared ones,
but we ain't exactly disappeared.

537
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:41,299
-We're just hard to find.
-Wait! You. I know you.

538
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,218
You bet you do, peckerwood.

539
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:46,012
I'm the legendary
Three-Fingered Jack.

540
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:49,682
And you are a bunch
of murdering trash...

541
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:54,229
...dressed up in fancy,
sweet-smelling doodads.

542
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:57,357
Ignore him, gentlemen.
He's a common thief.

543
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,984
As common as they come.

544
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:04,155
But I ain't nothing
compared to you gentlemen.

545
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:07,158
I steal gold, I steal money.

546
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:10,995
But you steal people's lives.

547
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:15,250
So damn you!
And damn the horse that brung you.

548
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,355
Peckerwood?

549
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:23,359
Is there something
amusing, captain?

550
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,070
Strange, I'd say.

551
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:30,575
It's the second time I've shot this man
while he was flying through the air.

552
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:43,838
Don Alejandro! I need to speak
with you at the hacienda, alone.

553
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,345
-Some other time, perhaps.
-Today. Alone.

554
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,995
Good afternoon, Bernardo.

555
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,541
Good afternoon, señorita.

556
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,252
Your voice is so calming.

557
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,963
He's high-spirited.
He needs to hear something soothing.

558
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,507
Yes, I understand.

559
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,762
How long have you served
Don Alejandro?

560
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:36,891
Sometimes it seems interminable.
Sorry, I speak out of place.

561
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:41,145
Do not worry, Bernardo.
He will not hear it from me.

562
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:46,192
Don Alejandro confuses me.

563
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:52,073
Sometimes he seems
so arrogant, so superior.

564
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:57,787
And yet the way he looks at me
and the way he dances with me....

565
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:00,665
As if he were
two completely different men.

566
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,250
Yeah.

567
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:13,469
You look so much like your mother.

568
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,348
How would you know that?

569
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:22,895
Well, I don't see
much of Don Rafael in you.

570
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:28,860
I know my father wishes
I acted more like her.

571
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:32,739
She was very proper, my mother.
Always appropriate

572
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,532
Is that how he describes her?

573
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:39,746
-Yes. But I do not believe him.
-She was more like you.

574
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:47,879
Perhaps.
It would be a way of knowing her.

575
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:55,845
My niñera told me that the departed
can see you in the moonlight.

576
01:22:56,013 --> 01:23:02,060
When I was young I sneaked out
at night and rode across Andalusia.

577
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:05,855
I would wave at the skies
so she would know it was me.

578
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:15,531
-How did she die?
-Giving birth to me.

579
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:21,788
My father rarely speaks of her.
I think he finds it too painful.

580
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,749
Yes.

581
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:34,092
I know what it is like
to lose a loved one.

582
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,511
You?

583
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:41,349
Yeah. A daughter. Long ago.

584
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:48,815
When I see you, I remember
what it felt like to be a father.

585
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:58,282
-Your mother would be proud of you.
-Thank you.

586
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:04,914
Bernardo, I have to ask you,
have we ever met before?

587
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,584
No, why would you think that?

588
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:15,049
I do not know. It's strange,
your voice seems so familiar.

589
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:20,596
I haven't been to Spain
since before you were born.

590
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:22,724
Of course.

591
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:27,353
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.

592
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:31,357
Thank you.

593
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:34,694
-Good day, Bernardo.
-Good day...

594
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:42,118
...Elena.

595
01:24:57,384 --> 01:25:00,845
Did you know that
the Compa Indians of central Peru...

596
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:05,725
...used to cannibalize their enemies
in order to absorb their power?

597
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:09,687
The eyes in particular
were most sought after.

598
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:18,488
To be able to see through the eyes
of an enemy is a valuable thing.

599
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:27,371
Where are my manners? Would you
care for something to drink?

600
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:35,671
No?

601
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:39,884
A different vintage perhaps?

602
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:51,479
You're a very sick person,
Captain Love.

603
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:56,150
Heads in water jars,
hands in wine pitchers...

604
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,320
...must strike you as odd, I suppose.

605
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:04,283
Well, for one thing, I think
you ought to fire your housekeeper.

606
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:14,627
-Who is he?
-An enemy.

607
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,257
He has a brother out there
who will share the same fate.

608
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,887
I wish you luck.

609
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:33,312
-To your health.
-Murrieta's brother or not...

610
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,774
...you are more than
you pretend to be.

611
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:41,571
Maybe someday I will see
what I look like through your eyes...

612
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,614
...Captain Love.

613
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:32,663
Oh, it is beautiful.

614
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:51,515
Excuse me. How much does it cost?

615
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:00,691
It is a gift, she says,
in honor of your mother.

616
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,195
My mother?

617
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:09,659
-She loved your mother.
-She must be mistaken.

618
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:13,204
My mother died long ago in Spain.

619
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:26,050
She says there is no mistaking...

620
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:29,512
...the daughter of Esperanza
and Diego de la Vega.

621
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:36,102
She says she was your nanny.
She hung flowers on your crib.

622
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:41,065
I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.

623
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:03,254
Alejandro.

624
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:08,843
Listen to me. Can you find
your way back to the mine?

625
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,096
No.

626
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:17,351
The carriage windows
were all covered.

627
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:21,439
-He didn't even trust his own dons.
-Nor would I.

628
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,733
You must go to
Montero's house tonight.

629
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,027
Break into the chest in his study.

630
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:30,656
-Find out what his plans are.
-People in the mine are dying.

631
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:36,620
And all I can think of
is Captain Love.

632
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:39,457
He will come into your circle
soon enough.

633
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:46,589
-I miss my brother, sir.
-Your brother is dead.

634
01:29:46,757 --> 01:29:49,383
We lose the ones we love.
Put it aside.

635
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,803
How?

636
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:56,640
How can I do what is needed...

637
01:29:56,808 --> 01:30:01,437
...when all I feel is hate?

638
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,648
You hide it.

639
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,652
With this.

640
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:22,958
Santa Anna has agreed to the transfer
at noon the day after tomorrow.

641
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:26,420
He insists we deliver the gold
five miles north of town.

642
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:28,380
Captain Love?

643
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:34,970
It's a safe distance from the mine.
The bars are stamped and ready.

644
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,014
I don't foresee a problem.

645
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:42,561
Tell him we agree.
You have done well, Luiz. Very well.

646
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:49,527
To the independent
Republic of California.

647
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:55,825
Don Rafael!

648
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:22,810
You sent men to the hills?
Doubled the guard at the wall?

649
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,854
Yes, yes, of course.

650
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:36,323
-After all, it's only one man.
-It isn't just one man. It's Zorro.

651
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:42,371
And he knows about the mine.
Otherwise he wouldn't be here tonight.

652
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:45,791
-How could he possibly--?
-It doesn't matter how.

653
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:48,085
You don't seem to grasp
the situation.

654
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:52,840
If Santa Anna finds out about this
he will have us butchered.

655
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,885
Do you understand?

656
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,764
Then we should
destroy the evidence.

657
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,808
Set explosives. Bury the mine.

658
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:08,772
-And the workers?
-We destroy all the evidence.

659
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,900
No witnesses.

660
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:20,534
Make sure
those papers are locked up.

661
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,887
Guards!

662
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:54,318
-The much-debated Zorro.
-No. The legendary Zorro.

663
01:32:57,155 --> 01:33:01,075
Put down your weapons!
Tell them.

664
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:03,535
Do as he says.

665
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,085
Allow me.

666
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,261
Come. Stop.

667
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,847
Face the window.

668
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:29,144
Now, bend down
and touch your toes.

669
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:33,232
Bend over!

670
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:40,072
Excuse me, Captain Love.
Thank you.

671
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,175
Kill him!

672
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,539
Good morning, señor.

673
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:42,379
-Good morning, señorita.
-Give it back.

674
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:45,507
-What?
-Whatever it is you have stolen...

675
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:49,678
...from my father, I want it back.
Give it to me.

676
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:52,097
No.

677
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:00,397
Come on, now.

678
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:17,331
I don't have the time
to give you the proper instruction.

679
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:23,754
I have had the proper instruction
since I was 4.

680
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:19,268
Not bad.

681
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,146
Not bad at all.

682
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:50,173
This will make it more difficult.
Señorita....

683
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,867
Don't move.

684
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:41,850
-Do you surrender?
-Never.

685
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,020
But I may scream.

686
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:48,065
I understand.

687
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:50,901
Sometimes I have that effect.

688
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:22,516
Excuse me.

689
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:27,104
Goodbye, señorita.

690
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:40,075
What are you doing?
What happened?

691
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:45,789
Zorro. Zorro was here.
I fought him and he left. He left.

692
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:52,379
-Did you recognize him?
-No, but he was young and vigorous.

693
01:40:52,714 --> 01:40:56,675
-He was very vigorous, Father.
-Vigorous?

694
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,302
Yes.

695
01:41:38,468 --> 01:41:39,968
Let's go!

696
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:58,421
Go!

697
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,878
Come on!

698
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:17,375
Here. This is the canyon.
That is where the mine is.

699
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:22,797
They have 25, 30 guards at most.

700
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:26,176
-Nothing that Zorro can't overcome.
-I'm not going with you.

701
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:28,178
What?

702
01:44:28,721 --> 01:44:31,598
I'm not going with you.

703
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:36,853
There's something I must do.
It's a personal matter.

704
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:41,858
-What about the prisoners?
-There's nothing more I can do.

705
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,821
-You mean, nothing you will do.
-I gave my life to them.

706
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:51,117
In return, I lose everything. My wife
was murdered before my eyes...

707
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:54,996
...and my child was stolen
to be raised by my mortal enemy.

708
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:58,708
Montero?

709
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:02,921
Elena.

710
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:06,967
She's your daughter.

711
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:10,345
Yeah, she was.

712
01:45:14,475 --> 01:45:16,059
So...

713
01:45:17,186 --> 01:45:18,979
...you will simply take your revenge.

714
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:23,733
No, I will take my daughter. And don't
pretend she means nothing to you.

715
01:45:23,901 --> 01:45:28,905
She does. But you taught me
to see beyond personal feelings.

716
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:33,827
-Was that all a lie?
-You're too young to understand.

717
01:45:33,995 --> 01:45:38,081
To understand what? Betrayal?

718
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:42,252
All the work, all the training,
all the wise words, for what?

719
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:47,757
To smile in the face of my brother's
killer while you make your own plans?

720
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:54,180
Alejandro, I taught you everything
you need to survive.

721
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:57,100
Now I must look to my own heart.

722
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:03,440
Elena is all I have left.
I am not going to lose her again.

723
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:10,405
What about California?
What about the people?

724
01:46:10,573 --> 01:46:13,116
They still have Zorro.

725
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:46,191
I have every inch of the countryside
covered. If he shows himself....

726
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:50,445
-Are you all right?
-Do you have the map?

727
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:54,240
-We'll find it.
-Is your army ready to fight?

728
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:57,744
-No, sir.
-Then of course I'm not all right.

729
01:46:57,912 --> 01:47:01,331
I'm beginning to wonder if you want
this operation to succeed at all.

730
01:47:01,499 --> 01:47:04,000
-What are you saying?
-What I'm saying, captain...

731
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:08,713
...is that I think my horse could
run this army better than you.

732
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:15,136
I said I'll find him.

733
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:18,515
That means I will.

734
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:25,939
Perhaps I can save you the trouble.
Go on, reach for it, captain.

735
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:32,695
-Who are you?
-I warned you long ago, Rafael.

736
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:37,867
-You would never be rid of me.
-De la Vega.

737
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:43,540
Rafael.

738
01:47:43,833 --> 01:47:46,835
You were not the Zorro
I saw last night.

739
01:47:47,002 --> 01:47:51,172
-That was your master, Don Alejandro.
-Yes.

740
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:54,384
But there are many who would
proudly wear the mask of Zorro.

741
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:59,222
Either way, events have been set
in motion that you cannot stop.

742
01:48:00,224 --> 01:48:02,559
I'm not here to stop you.

743
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:05,562
Call for Elena.

744
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:12,068
Call her.

745
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:17,657
Captain, bring my daughter to me.

746
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:22,036
Bring her to me!

747
01:48:30,546 --> 01:48:35,383
You cannot imagine, Rafael,
how I have dreamed of this moment.

748
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:39,596
Night and day, 20 long years.

749
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:44,225
Really? I haven't given you
a second thought.

750
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:51,733
-If I die, the truth dies with me.
-We shall see.

751
01:48:51,901 --> 01:48:54,152
Father!

752
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:58,198
-Bernardo, what are you doing?
-Tell her, Rafael.

753
01:48:59,909 --> 01:49:04,370
-Tell me what? What is going on?
-Tell her who her real father is.

754
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:08,082
Father, what is he saying?

755
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:14,923
This unfortunate man
lost a daughter once...

756
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:18,259
...and now he seeks to claim you
for his own.

757
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:24,265
Tell her how her mother died.

758
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:33,483
Your daughter is lost, de la Vega.
You cannot have mine.

759
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:36,236
De la Vega?

760
01:49:37,613 --> 01:49:40,782
A woman in town, she told me....

761
01:49:42,034 --> 01:49:44,327
Diego de la Vega?

762
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:50,208
Father?

763
01:49:50,376 --> 01:49:53,002
His name is of no consequence.

764
01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:59,759
I was told my niñera used
to hang something on my crib.

765
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:05,306
Yes, she had her hang
fresh flowers.

766
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:06,975
No!

767
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:09,894
No!

768
01:50:15,025 --> 01:50:19,195
Let us finish it, Rafael.
Let us finish what we started...

769
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:22,073
...the night Esperanza died.

770
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:27,036
Drop your sword or I will have
no choice but to have you shot.

771
01:50:27,788 --> 01:50:30,623
Even in the presence
of my daughter.

772
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:35,878
Please.

773
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:54,564
They were flowers. Romneya.

774
01:51:00,612 --> 01:51:03,156
Rafael...

775
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:06,743
...she knows.

776
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,707
Water!

777
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:54,494
Lock them up!

778
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:52,552
The fuses are burning. Hurry it up.

779
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:58,057
Let's go!

780
01:55:20,581 --> 01:55:21,998
Wait here!

781
01:55:31,675 --> 01:55:35,052
Secure the wagon, stay alert.

782
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:07,103
-De la Vega.
-Rafael.

783
01:58:21,344 --> 01:58:24,013
Only one question.

784
01:58:26,933 --> 01:58:29,351
Really? What is that?

785
01:58:33,857 --> 01:58:36,859
How would you like
your remains displayed?

786
02:00:06,616 --> 02:00:11,495
-Now I'm free to kill you.
-No!

787
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:21,130
Drop the sword. Drop it.

788
02:00:30,307 --> 02:00:33,017
You really think
I would have killed my own child?

789
02:00:58,501 --> 02:01:00,628
Did you miss me?

790
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:26,362
Elena! Get them out!

791
02:01:33,078 --> 02:01:39,583
-"M" for Murrieta.
-Two men. One dead.

792
02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:46,358
You're doing well. Your brother
would have shot himself by now.

793
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:43,642
Alejandro.

794
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:01,637
Is it finished?

795
02:06:02,138 --> 02:06:06,642
Yes, Don Diego. It's finished.

796
02:06:08,144 --> 02:06:10,562
Not for Zorro.

797
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:14,566
There will be other days,
other battles to fight.

798
02:06:14,734 --> 02:06:18,487
It is your curse and destiny.

799
02:06:20,365 --> 02:06:22,574
My beautiful Elena.

800
02:06:25,370 --> 02:06:28,247
The world is a strange place.

801
02:06:30,041 --> 02:06:33,001
Too have found you at last
only to lose you again.

802
02:06:33,294 --> 02:06:36,046
You will never lose me...

803
02:06:36,798 --> 02:06:39,049
...Father.

804
02:06:42,178 --> 02:06:43,887
Elena.

805
02:06:46,349 --> 02:06:48,684
You are like your mother.

806
02:06:50,019 --> 02:06:52,354
Same eyes.

807
02:06:52,522 --> 02:06:54,898
Same mouth.

808
02:06:55,066 --> 02:06:57,442
Same spirit.

809
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:04,574
Alejandro...

810
02:07:06,452 --> 02:07:08,495
...Elena.

811
02:07:28,433 --> 02:07:33,312
And so it was.
Lightning split the sky.

812
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:35,814
Thunder shook the air.

813
02:07:35,982 --> 02:07:39,401
And then all was quiet.

814
02:07:40,528 --> 02:07:46,366
The great warrior
known as Zorro was gone.

815
02:07:47,493 --> 02:07:49,745
The people of the land
gave him a hero's funeral.

816
02:07:49,912 --> 02:07:52,414
The largest anyone had ever seen.

817
02:07:53,249 --> 02:07:56,335
They came from far and wide
to say farewell...

818
02:07:56,502 --> 02:07:58,920
...to the brave and noble champion.

819
02:08:02,383 --> 02:08:04,968
But don't worry, little Joaquin.

820
02:08:05,470 --> 02:08:08,305
Whenever great deeds
are remembered...

821
02:08:08,473 --> 02:08:11,391
...your grandfather will live on.

822
02:08:12,268 --> 02:08:16,021
For there must always be a Zorro.

823
02:08:16,189 --> 02:08:21,526
And someday, when he is needed,
we will see him again.

824
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:26,656
On his fearsome steed, Tornado,
riding like the wind.

825
02:08:26,824 --> 02:08:28,950
His sword blazing in the sun.

826
02:08:30,078 --> 02:08:33,372
Leaping, jumping!
Swinging through the air!

827
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:35,916
Fighting like a lion,
fighting like a tiger!

828
02:08:36,084 --> 02:08:38,126
Fighting...

829
02:08:44,967 --> 02:08:46,760
...as safely as possible.

830
02:08:48,679 --> 02:08:51,348
Is this your idea
of putting the baby to sleep?

831
02:08:58,898 --> 02:09:01,316
Sleep tight, my son.

832
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:13,495
When I sleep, I will dream
of this dashing rogue, Zorro.

833
02:09:14,038 --> 02:09:16,998
But what face shall I give him?

834
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:21,044
He has been many different men...

835
02:09:21,212 --> 02:09:24,714
...but he has loved you
as all of them.

836
02:09:28,845 --> 02:09:31,847
How can I refuse such a man?

837
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:35,976
Do you know where
I might find him?

838
02:09:36,144 --> 02:09:41,022
You know Zorro.
He could be anywhere.

839
02:09:57,457 --> 02:10:00,125
There, there, my darling.
