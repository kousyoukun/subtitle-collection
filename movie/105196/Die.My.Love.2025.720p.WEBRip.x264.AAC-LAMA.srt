3
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,500
- Oh man.
- Wow.

4
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,917
I haven't been here
since I was a little kid.

5
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,416
I thought you grew up here.

6
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,208
Like round the corner.

7
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,208
I knocked my tooth out on that step.

8
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,292
Got me brain damaged.

9
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,167
It's not New York but it's ours.

10
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,125
I think it's gonna be pretty sick.

11
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,375
Yeah?

12
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,749
- I could send for my drum kit?
- No way.

13
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,083
No?

14
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,207
My uncle was a hoarder.

15
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,625
I didn't realise how much space
there was in here.

16
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,749
It's peaceful.

17
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,500
I can just record
an album out here so easily.

18
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,291
- Gracie!
- What?

19
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,917
I found an office!

20
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,000
You can write
your Great American Novel up here.

21
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,374
Whoa!

22
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,167
What?

23
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:24,125
It's alright.
It's just a little rat situation.

24
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,082
We should get a cat.

25
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,875
You can write all day, every day.
Nothing but the birds singing.

26
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,542
How did he die?

27
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,625
I don't know.

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,125
Here we are.

29
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,125
We need a broom.

30
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,916
Hey, hey, hey.

31
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,125
Hey!

32
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,500
Hey.

33
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,750
Hey! Where's your mommy?

34
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,250
Pumpkin, where's your mommy?

35
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,208
Oh, no!

36
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,833
Where's Mommy?

37
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,125
Oh, God.

38
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:27,875
Grace.

39
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,000
Mom wanted to stop by.

40
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,208
Oh?

41
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,374
I told her it wasn't a big deal.
It's like a "us" thing.

42
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,583
And it's just for six months,
anyway, so...

43
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,582
I just feel kind of bad,

44
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,958
'cause I think she just wants the company.

45
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,625
I don't mind her coming.

46
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:28,625
It's weird. It's like she doesn't
know how to function any more.

47
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,832
She's still cooking for two people.
Did she tell you that?

48
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,500
It's too sweet.

49
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,167
Yeah? No, it's nice.

50
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:40,957
He liked it.

51
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,667
A real mom would have baked a cake.

52
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,792
Want another one?

53
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,542
Why is it so fuckin' hot?

54
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,583
"Why is it so fuckin' hot?"

55
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,832
"Why is it so fuckin' hot?"

56
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,625
It's always hot.

57
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,417
Boy's asleep.

58
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,917
You wanna look?

59
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,250
How can you not give a shit
about the stars, Grace?

60
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,708
Well, they make me feel like... nothing.

61
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,833
I like that they make me feel like I'm
part of something bigger.

62
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,124
You like to feel like nothing?

63
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,166
No.

64
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,958
You know how many universes
there are out there?

65
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,874
What are we doing in
the different universe? Are we together?

66
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,042
Sure we are.

67
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,208
Am I a rock star?

68
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,000
Can you sing in a different universe?

69
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,708
Hey.

70
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,333
Yeah, I'm sure you're a rock star.

71
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,583
Do we fuck?

72
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,958
All the time?

73
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,625
Hey, what?

74
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,083
Do. We. Fuck?

75
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,417
Like rabbits.

76
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,333
Do you hear him?

77
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,542
No.

78
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,625
He's crying. Listen.

79
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,917
Grace, it's totally silent.

80
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,250
Am I boring you?

81
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,458
Not you. The universe.
Who gives a shit?

82
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,666
<i>...and a wild party mom...</i>

83
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:03,666
<i>I'm very well known as Big Bouncy,
the over-the-hill party girl.</i>

84
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,583
<i>...swap lives for two weeks.</i>

85
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:09,042
- <i>I hope you survive.</i>
- <i>Bye!</i>

86
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,374
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

87
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,082
<i>Loretta's appearance,
I don't think it's appropriate.</i>

88
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,582
<i>We are two worlds apart.</i>

89
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,332
<i>I've never seen anything good
come out of alcohol.</i>

90
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,499
<i>I've never killed an animal before.</i>

91
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,582
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

92
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,041
<i>I'm talking!</i>

93
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:27,333
<i>I've never seen
a more disrespectful child.</i>

94
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,208
<i>Does it feel like a girl?</i>

95
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,167
<i>What does a girl feel like?</i>

96
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,167
<i>If it moves more on the right,
then you're probably having a boy.</i>

97
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,042
<i>You didn't wanna know?</i>

98
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:23,416
Grace, I... didn't find out
what I was having either.

99
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,707
I think that's nice.

100
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,999
You didn't find out
'cause you wanted a girl.

101
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,083
Ha, ha.

102
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,041
Oh, gosh. He forgets to drink.

103
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,707
- Harry, you gotta have a drink.
- He's fine.

104
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,499
No, I wanted a baby.
I wanted whoever was in there.

105
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,207
Yeah? And you got Jackson?

106
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,707
Unlucky.

107
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,167
I heard that, Auntie Jen.

108
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,500
Are you off your food, Grace?

109
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,832
- Leave her alone.
- You didn't eat.

110
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,625
Being pregnant
makes your stomach shrink.

111
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,416
That's bullshit.

112
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:55,707
It's sucking on you
every minute of the day.

113
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,249
Then you'll be famished.
I couldn't get enough in me.

114
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,957
That never went away, did it?

115
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,791
You can talk.
What's your excuse?

116
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:05,958
Never had a baby in there but always
ate as though you just dropped triplets.

117
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,082
You know, Grace,
if you get a screamer...

118
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,999
She's not gonna get a screamer.

119
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,124
- Jackson was a screamer.
- That's a lie.

120
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,666
Jackson was a sweetheart.

121
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,707
The point is, if you do,
let the baby cry.

122
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,082
Just walk away from it.
Don't let yourself get tired, stressed.

123
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,040
That's a horrible thing to say.

124
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,832
Slow fuckin' death.

125
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,457
If you're not at your best, it's no good
for anyone, especially the baby.

126
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,082
And a crying baby
doesn't mean it's in pain.

127
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,832
It's the only way they have
of communicating.

128
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,916
No, it's not.

129
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,833
People only say that so they can walk
away from their kid.

130
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,874
Anyway, all I do is take care of Harry.

131
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,416
- Barely.
- If you need me...

132
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,957
- She doesn't.
- ...we're just a walk away.

133
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,000
What you doing in here, Pop?
Wanna watch the Grizzlies?

134
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,417
Wanna open some of those presents?

135
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,625
- Whose presents?
- For the baby.

136
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,457
No, I gotta sort out these shoes.

137
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,208
- Okay.
- They're the wrong ones.

138
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,249
They look good to me.

139
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,832
- You had enough to eat, Mom?
- Honey, I'm stuffed.

140
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,417
Would you get your dad
something to drink, please?

141
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,792
No more pie.

142
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,083
Well, I'm stuffed.

143
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,666
Can't stop eating.
It's the same every holiday.

144
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,832
Well, you can.
You've always been skinny.

145
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,582
Grace likes me lean.
Don't you, baby?

146
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,833
You can starve in January.

147
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,291
What are y'all doing?
Why are y'all here?

148
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,457
This is Frank's house.

149
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,999
It's his house.

150
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,541
Harry, this is Grace and Jackson's--

151
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,874
No, this is my brother's house.

152
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,416
Sweetheart, Frank's not here.

153
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,917
Get out of my brother's house!

154
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,208
Jackson.

155
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,208
Harry.

156
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:01,875
Harry!

157
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,250
Did you find the right size?

158
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:24,875
Hello.

159
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,375
Hello.

160
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,957
Is it a baby?

161
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,042
- A baby.
- A boy?

162
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,832
I don't know. I think, maybe.

163
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,000
It is.

164
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,082
Oh?

165
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,167
Don't leave him to cry.

166
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,792
I won't.

167
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,042
You know,
when he comes, he's a cat.

168
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,417
He's a bear and a baby.

169
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,667
And he's you, he's all of you.
He's gonna be so funny.

170
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,791
Hi. Find everything you're looking for?

171
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,375
In life?

172
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,124
Any gas for your car?

173
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,041
- No.
- Alrighty.

174
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:27,749
I love this stuff. Whatever they put
in that powder, it's like magic.

175
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,041
It's two for six dollars
if you want another.

176
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,499
- I'm good.
- This one's four.

177
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,374
- And the other one is two.
- I get it.

178
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,374
- No, thanks.
- He's a boy, right?

179
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,874
He's so cute.
Hi there, handsome.

180
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,750
Hi there, sweetie-pie.

181
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,541
- Does he have a name?
- No.

182
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,333
We decided not to name him.

183
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,582
How old are you, sweetie?
Wait. Let me guess.

184
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:54,541
I'm really good at this.
About six months?

185
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,457
Why are you talking?

186
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,291
Do you ever think about
what you're gonna say?

187
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,750
Or do you just open your mouth
and blah, blah, blah, blah?

188
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:07,417
In about 30 seconds, I'll be gone.
We don't need to speak.

189
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,083
Okay.

190
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,875
Alrighty.

191
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,125
Alrighty.

192
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:23,208
Alrighty. Alrighty. Alrighty.

193
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:55,125
- Hey.
- Hey.

194
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,332
What you doing up, little bug?

195
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,457
I was bored.

196
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,542
You got bored,
so you kept the baby up?

197
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,000
I got somethin' for you.

198
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:12,708
What the fuck, Jackson?
You got a dog?

199
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:14,500
Got a dog.

200
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,916
Look at him.

201
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,708
We need a cat.

202
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,457
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

203
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,874
Good dog. Good baby.

204
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,625
You're a good baby. Yes, you are.

205
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:32,917
Hey.

206
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:40,958
Come here.

207
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,000
Come on.
Everyone but me.

208
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,417
Yeah.

209
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,083
Hey.

210
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,417
Wanna see some magic?

211
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,125
Wanna see a magic trick?

212
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,582
Gonna sit nice?

213
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,541
Yeah, sit.

214
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:19,000
That's a good boy.

215
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,083
That's a good boy.

216
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,583
Stir it up.
You stir it up.

217
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,208
Second.

218
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,875
Magic.

219
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,375
Ready?
We're ready to steer. Okay.

220
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,542
Ready to drive?

221
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
To the moon.

222
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,375
And a left to New York.

223
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,792
What is that?
Do you feel that?

224
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,542
<i>Where are you now?</i>

225
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:10,292
<i>In a burger place
outside of Nampa. 84.</i>

226
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:13,375
<i>You're eating?</i>

227
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,583
Mm-hm.

228
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,041
<i>A burger?</i>

229
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,250
<i>Yep.</i>

230
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,917
- Is it good?
<i>- Yeah, it's alright.</i>

231
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,875
Well, what else have you been doing?

232
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,124
<i>Working.</i>

233
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:36,125
Uh-huh. What else?

234
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,291
Is everything alright?

235
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:45,125
<i>I'm asking you about your day.
This is a conversation.</i>

236
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,875
- What have you been up to?
- Nothin'.

237
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,375
<i>Have you been writing?</i>

238
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,624
<i>I'll call you
when I get closer, okay?</i>

239
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,707
Well, are you gonna wanna eat?

240
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:07,625
<i>Yeah, we can have dinner when I get back.
It's gonna be kind of late, though.</i>

241
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:10,333
<i>Anything else for you?</i>

242
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,583
<i>What sounds good for supper?</i>

243
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:16,874
<i>How's the boy?</i>

244
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,666
He's sleeping.

245
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,624
<i>- Hey, darlin'. Here's your check.
- Alright, talk later.</i>

246
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:22,916
<i>Thank you, baby.</i>

247
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,708
Okay. Bye.

248
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,208
Pam?

249
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:48,625
Pam?

250
00:34:58,792 --> 00:34:59,917
Pam?

251
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,125
Pam?

252
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:32,333
Fuck! Oh, goddammit.

253
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,082
Pam, what the hell?

254
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,500
You snuck in.

255
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,625
I didn't sneak.

256
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,499
I brought the baby.

257
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
- You brought the baby.
- He's asleep.

258
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,332
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

259
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,249
As long as you don't blow my brains out.

260
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,874
That thing loaded, Pam?

261
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:52,332
Oh, yeah. It's Harry's.

262
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,667
He used to sleep with it next to him.

263
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,417
Made him feel safe.

264
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,707
I don't know
what to do with it now.

265
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,708
I don't know what to do
with any of it.

266
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,708
I never do my hair.

267
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,667
It's pretty.

268
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,042
Harry likes it loose.

269
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,667
Yeah?

270
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:24,958
You sleeping at all?

271
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,542
Oh... you know.

272
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,917
Jackson says
you've been sleepwalking.

273
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,792
Oh, yeah. That.

274
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,333
You get far?

275
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:43,583
Woke up on Culver Road
screaming my head off.

276
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,042
Never done anything like that before.

277
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:54,208
Nothing seems real since...

278
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,167
since he died.

279
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:03,500
My brain just seems... chopped up.

280
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:25,375
Yeah. I'm your grandma.
Yeah, I am.

281
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:37,250
It's so wonderful the two of you
have taken on the house.

282
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,083
Mm-hm.

283
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:47,500
He was... such a happy little guy, Frank.

284
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,624
He shot himself?

285
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,124
- Uncle Frank?
- Yes.

286
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,167
And you found him?

287
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,457
I did.

288
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:02,292
- That must have been awful.
- Yes, I did. It was.

289
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,333
It was.

290
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,375
In the head?

291
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,875
In the head?

292
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,208
No.

293
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:22,083
- I can't...
- Well, where, then?

294
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,625
The heart? Chest?

295
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:28,500
No.

296
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,624
- Legs, feet, back?
- No.

297
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,541
- Arms? Stomach?
- No, no.

298
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,333
Dick?

299
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,542
- Grace.
- Ass?

300
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:43,833
Oh, my God. He shot himself
in his own ass intentionally?

301
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,917
You know, he looks just like you.

302
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:57,792
- Uncle Frank?
- No. The baby, you goose.

303
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,041
You think?

304
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:03,875
Yeah. Yeah.

305
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,042
Grace, you know, everybody
goes a little loopy the first year.

306
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,250
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

307
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,916
You and Harry have known
each other your whole lives.

308
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,624
Of course you're gonna go
a bit loopy.

309
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,749
No, no. I mean you.

310
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,749
After a baby.

311
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,541
My mother went nuts.
Jen lost it.

312
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:37,625
I didn't feel myself for a while.
But you'll... you'll...

313
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,375
You'll come back.

314
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,250
You know...

315
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:55,583
- if you're having a hard time--
- I feel fine.

316
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,792
We'll come again soon.

317
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:01,625
Thanks for the tea.

318
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:19,917
Who's pushing you?

319
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:23,333
Is that a ghost?

320
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:34,832
<i>Red and yellow</i>

321
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:39,666
<i>And pink and green</i>

322
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:46,125
<i>Purple and orange and blue</i>

323
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,958
<i>I can sing a rainbow</i>

324
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,750
<i>Sing a rainbow</i>

325
00:40:56,583 --> 00:41:03,042
<i>Sing a rainbow too</i>

326
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:18,708
<i>Listen with your eyes</i>

327
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:22,874
<i>Listen with your eyes</i>

328
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:28,125
<i>And sing everything you see</i>

329
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,542
What the fuck do you want?

330
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,333
Cut your lip.

331
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:52,875
Cut it.

332
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:35,208
Woof, woof, woof.
Boop, boop, boop.

333
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:50,625
Just gonna leave it?

334
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,166
He's your girlfriend.
You clean it.

335
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,457
Nice.

336
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,791
He pissed on the floor too.

337
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:59,166
You should make better choices
in who you bring home.

338
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,041
- Fuck's sake, Grace.
- You're mad at me?

339
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:03,166
Why didn't you let him out,
you whack job?

340
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,417
He's not my problem.

341
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,374
Just put him on his leash,
take him out the back

342
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,416
until he gets used to where he is.
