00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,250
天啊
Oh man.

2
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,250
哇哦
Wow.

3
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,870
我打小之后就再没回来过
I haven't been here since I was a little kid.

4
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,000
我还以为你在这长大的
I thought you grew up here.

5
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,870
就前面拐角那一带
Like round the corner.

6
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,750
我就是在那个台阶上把牙磕掉的
I knocked my tooth out on that step.

7
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,750
脑子都磕坏了
Got me brain damaged.

8
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,370
虽然比不上纽约 但这是咱俩的小窝
It's not New York, but... it's ours.

9
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,120
我觉得以后会很快活 对吧?
I think it's gonna be pretty sick, no?

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,250
嗯?
Yeah?

11
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,500
-我把架子鼓运过来成不?-想都别想
- I could send for my drum kit? - No way.

12
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,000
不行?
No?

13
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,870
我叔叔以前爱囤东西 我没想到这儿…
My uncle was a hoarder. I didn't realise how much...

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,620
原来这么宽敞
space there was in here.

15
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,370
挺清净啊
It's peaceful.

16
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,370
在这地方录专辑再舒服不过了
I can just record an album out here so easily.

17
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,750
-格蕾丝 -干嘛?
- Gracie! - What?

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,250
我找到个书房
I found an office!

19
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,120
哦
Oh.

20
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,250
你以后可以在这写你那部伟大的美国小说了
You can write your Great American Novel up here.

21
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,870
哇
Whoa!

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,620
怎么了?
What?

23
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,500
呃…
Um...

24
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,870
没事就几只老鼠
It's alright. It's just a little rat situation.

25
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,000
咱们该养只猫了
We should get a cat.

26
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,500
你可以从早写到晚 安静得只剩鸟叫
You can write all day, every day. Nothing but the birds singing.

27
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,250
他怎么死的?
How did he die?

28
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
呃…
Um...

29
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,500
我不知道
I don't know.

30
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,870
就这了
Here we are.

31
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,870
得先找把扫帚
We need a broom.

32
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,750
嘿嘿嘿
Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,620
嘿
Hey.

34
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,500
来吧 我们再扭一曲
Came on, let's twist again

35
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,250
嘿 你妈妈呢?
Hey! Where's your mommy?

36
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,250
小南瓜 你妈呢?
Pumpkin, where's your mommy?

37
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,120
哦 糟咯
Oh, no!

38
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,750
妈妈去哪了?
Where's Mommy?

39
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,120
天啊
Oh, God.

40
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,750
格蕾丝
Grace.

41
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,870
我妈想顺道过来一趟
Mom wanted to stop by.

42
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,620
哦?
Oh?

43
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,000
我跟她说了没大 就只是咱俩自己的事
I told her it wasn't a big deal. It's like a "us" thing.

44
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,500
反正也就待六个月吧 所以…
And it's just for six months, anyway, so...

45
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,120
嗯
Mm-hmm.

46
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,500
我就是有点过意不去
I just feel kind of bad,

47
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,870
我觉得她只是想有人陪
'cause I think she just wants the company.

48
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,620
我不介意她来
I don't mind her coming.

49
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,870
真怪她好像不知道一个人怎么过了
It's weird. It's like she doesn't know how to function any more.

50
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,750
做饭还按两人份 她跟你说过吗?
She's still cooking for two people. Did she tell you that?

51
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,870
太甜了
It's too sweet.

52
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,250
是吗?我觉得挺好啊
Yeah? No, it's nice.

53
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,870
他喜欢甜的
He liked it.

54
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
真正当妈的会烤个蛋糕
A real mom would have baked a cake.

55
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,750
再来一瓶?
Want another one?

56
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,870
怎么他妈的这么热?
Why is it so fuckin' hot?

57
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,870
“怎么他妈的这么热?”
"Why is it so fuckin' hot?"

58
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,620
这里一直这么热
It's always hot.

59
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,620
孩子睡了
Boy's asleep.

60
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,620
嗯
Mm-hmm.

61
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,120
你要看吗?
You wanna look?

62
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,870
格蕾丝 你怎么能对星星这么无动于衷?
How can you not give a shit about the stars, Grace?

63
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,370
看着它们 我觉得自己啥也不是
Well, they make me feel like nothing.

64
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,000
我倒喜欢这种成为浩瀚宇宙一份子的感觉
I like they make me feel like I'm part of something bigger.

65
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,250
你就喜欢觉得自己啥也不是?
You like to feel like nothing?

66
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,750
不
No.

67
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,500
你知道外面有多少个宇宙吗?
You know how many universes there are out there?

68
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,000
在别的宇宙里我们在干嘛 还会在一起吗?
What are we doing in the different universe? Are we together?

69
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
当然
Sure we are.

70
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,870
那我是不是搖滾女明星?
Am I a rock star?

71
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,870
嗯…
Hmm...

72
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,620
在别的宇宙里你会唱歌吗?
Can you sing in a different universe?

73
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,620
嘿
Hey.

74
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,750
会 我敢肯定你是
Yeah, I'm sure you're a rock star.

75
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,000
那我们会不会做爱?
Do we fuck?

76
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,750
会
Uh-huh.

77
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,500
一直做?
All the time?

78
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,370
你说啥?
Hey, what?

79
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,500
我们 到底 会不会做爱?
Do. We. Fuck?

80
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,120
跟兔子一样频繁
Like rabbits.

81
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,750
你听见孩子声音了吗?
Do you hear him?

82
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,000
没听见
No.

83
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,000
他在哭呢 你听
He's crying. Listen.

84
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,500
格蕾丝 这儿一点声音都没有
Grace, it's totally silent.

85
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,000
我把你说烦了?
Am I boring you?

86
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,250
跟你无关 宇宙的问题
Not you. The universe.

87
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,620
谁在乎啊?
Who gives a shit?

88
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,750
摸起来像女孩吗?
Does it feel like a girl?

89
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,870
女孩摸起来什么感觉?
What does a girl feel like?

90
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,750
要是右边动得多点
If it moves more on the right,

91
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,870
那你多半怀的是男孩
then you're probably having a boy.

92
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,750
你不想提前知道吗?
You didn't wanna know?

93
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
不想
Mm-mm.

94
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,750
格蕾丝 我…
Grace, I...

95
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,750
我当年也没提前去查自己怀的是啥
I didn't find out what I was having either.

96
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,250
我觉得那样挺好的
I think that's nice.

97
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,370
你不去查是因为你想要个女儿
You didn't find out 'cause you wanted a girl.

98
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,250
天啊 他又忘了喝
Oh, gosh. He forgets to drink.

99
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,750
哈利 你得喝一杯
Harry, you gotta have a drink.

100
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,750
不 我没有 我只是想要个孩子 谁在肚子里我都要
No, I didn't, I wanted a baby. I wanted whoever was in there.

101
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,620
是吗 然后你生下了杰克森?
Yeah? And you got Jackson?

102
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,000
真不走运
Unlucky.

103
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,620
我听到了 珍姨
I heard that, Auntie Jen.

104
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,000
格蕾丝 没胃口吗?
Are you off your food, Grace?

105
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,120
-别管她 -你刚才都没吃东西
- Leave her alone. - You didn't eat.

106
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,620
怀孕会让胃口变小
Being pregnant makes your stomach shrink.

107
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,120
那是胡扯
That's bullshit.

108
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,500
那小家伙每天每分钟都在吸你的营养
It's sucking on you every minute of the day.

109
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,370
然后你就会饿坏 我那时候怎么吃都吃不够
Then you'll be famished. I couldn't get enough in me.

110
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,250
你这毛病一直没改 是吧?
That never went away, did it?

111
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,370
你倒会说 你自己又有什么借口?
You can talk. What's your excuse?

112
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,620
自己从没生过 吃起来像刚生了三胞胎似的
Never had a baby but always ate as though you'd just had triplets.

113
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,750
你知道吗 格蕾丝 要是你生的是个爱哭鬼…
You know, Grace, if you get a screamer...

114
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,000
她不会生爱哭鬼的
She's not gonna get a screamer.

115
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,870
杰克森小时候就是个爱哭鬼
Jackson was a screamer.

116
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,370
-胡说 -杰克森小时候可乖了
- That's a lie! - Jackson was a sweetheart.

117
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,250
重点是 真遇上那种 就让孩子自己哭去
The point is, if you do, let the baby cry.

118
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,870
你就暂时离开一下 别把自己弄得又累又紧绷
Just walk away from it. Don't let yourself get tired, stressed.

119
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
这么说太吓人了
That's a horrible thing to say.

120
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,000
简直是慢性折磨
Slow fuckin' death.

121
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,120
你要是状态不好 对谁都不好 尤其是对孩子
If you're not at your best, it's no good for anyone, especially the baby.

122
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,750
而且孩子哭不代表他难受
And a crying baby doesn't mean it's in pain.

123
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,620
那是他们唯一和大人的交流方式
It's the only way they have of communicating.

124
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,500
不 才不是这样
No, it's not.

125
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,370
人家爱说那种屁话 是因为想着能心安理得丢下孩子
People say that shit because they wanna walk away from their kid.

126
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
反正我整天就只是在照顾哈利
Anyway, all I do is take care of Harry.

127
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,250
- 勉强算吧 - 要是你需要我的话…
- Barely. - If you need me...

128
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,750
-她不用 -我们走几步就到
- She doesn't. - ...we're just a walk away.

129
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,000
爸 你在这干嘛 想看灰熊队比赛吗?
What you doing in here, Pop? Wanna watch the Grizzlies?

130
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,870
想拆礼物吗?儿
Wanna open some of those presents?

131
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,750
谁的礼物?
Whose presents?

132
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,870
给宝宝的
For the baby.

133
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,370
不用 我得把这几双鞋先理清楚
No, I gotta sort out these shoes.

134
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,370
-好吧 -这双鞋拿错了
- Okay. - They're the wrong ones.

135
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
我看着挺好
They look good to me.

136
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,620
-妈你吃饱了吗?-宝贝 我吃撑了
- You had enough to eat, Mom? - Honey, I'm stuffed.

137
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,250
帮你爸倒点喝的好吗?
Would you get your dad something to drink, please?

138
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,000
给 老爸
Here you go, Pop.

139
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,870
别再给我吃派了
No more pie.

140
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,000
唉 我也是吃撑了
Well, I'm stuffed.

141
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,620

Oh, yeah. It's Harry's.

283
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,620
他以前睡觉时都把它放在身边
He used to sleep with it next to him.

284
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,370
那样他才觉得踏实
Made him feel safe.

285
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,370
我现在不知道该怎么处理这些东西
I don't know what to do with it now.

286
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,620
我根本不知道这些东西该怎么弄
I don't know what to do with any of it.

287
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,620
我从来不打理头发
I never do my hair.

288
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,000
挺好看的
It's pretty.

289
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,000
哈利喜欢我散着
Harry likes it loose.

290
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,620
是吗?
Yeah?

291
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,120
你最近睡眠好吗?
Are you sleeping at all?

292
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,250
嗯…
Um...

293
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,500
你知道的
You know.

294
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,370
杰克森说你最近老是梦游
Jackson says you've been sleepwalking.

295
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,750
哦对是啊
Oh, yeah. That.

296
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,870
你会走多远?
You get far?

297
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,500
我在卡尔弗路上醒过来 嗓子都喊哑了
Woke up on Culver Road screaming my head off.

298
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,120
以前从没这样过
Never done anything like that before.

299
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,500
从那之后 什么都不像真的了
Nothing seems real since...

300
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,250
自他死了以后
since he died.

301
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,250
我脑子好像…
My brain just seems...

302
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,120
碎成了一块块
chopped up.

303
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,750
嗯
Yeah.

304
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,250
我是你奶奶 对 我是
I'm your grandma. Yeah, I am.

305
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,250
你们俩肯接手这房子真是太好了
It's so wonderful the two of you have taken on the house.

306
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,120
嗯
Mm-hmm.

307
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,370
哦 弗兰克他…
Oh, he was...

308
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,870
小时候可开心了
such a happy little guy, Frank.

309
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,500
他是开枪自杀的?
He shot himself?

310
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,000
-弗兰克叔叔?- 对
- Uncle Frank? - Yes.

311

00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,120
是我
I did.

313
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,370
-那一定很可怕 -是我找到他的很可怕
- That must have been awful. - Yes, I did. It was.

314
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,370
确实很可怕
It was.

315
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,370
打在头上?
In the head?

316
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,870
打头上?
In the head?

317
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,250
不是
No.

318
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,250
-我记不… - 那到底是哪呢?
- I can't... - Well, where, then?

319

-格蕾丝 -屁股?
-Grace. - Ass?

325
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,870
天啊 他故意朝自己屁股开枪?
Oh, my God. He shot himself in his own ass intentionally?

326
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,870
你知道吗 他长得真像你
You know, he looks just like you.

327
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,370
-弗兰克叔叔?-不是

361
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,750
-拜托格蕾丝 -你冲我发火?
Fuck's sake, Grace. You're mad at me?

362
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,500
你怎么不放它出去 你这疯女人
Why didn't you let him out, you whack job?

363

不关我的事

You probably pissed on the floor yourself. Blamed it on the dog.

384

明明是你那条脏狗干的 还有“道貌岸然”的意思是
It was your mangy dog. And "sanctimonious" means

385
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,120
你自以为比别人高尚 懂吗 蠢人?
you think you're morally superior to other people, dummy.

386
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,620

要是我少花点时间把手伸进裤裆里
Maybe if I spend a little less time with my hands down my pants

391
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,000
多花点时间写作

392
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,500
说不定我真能写出点东西来

我手伸在裤裆里

557
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:26,620
不知道 一个月前?
I don't know. Like a month?

558
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,000
再猜 两个半月
Try two and a half.

559
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,120
这阵子情况嘛 你也知道
Well, things have been, you know.

560
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:35,000
而且那次是凌晨四点 你基本上都睡着了
And it was four in the morning and you were essentially asleep.

561
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,250
格蕾丝
Grace.

562
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,000
再往前一次
And the time before that,

563
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,870
我们在看那个荒岛纪录片
we were watching TV about that thing on the island,

564
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,620
我求你半天 然后你铺了条毛巾
and I was begging you, and you put a towel down.

565
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,250
好了好了好了
Alright, alright, alright.

566
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:47,620
以前明明挺好的 对吧?
It used to be good, right?

567
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,750
现在也还是很好 格蕾丝
It's still good, Grace.

568
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:53,000
根本已经不存在了 杰克森 没这回事了
It doesn't exist, Jackson. It's not a thing.

569
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:55,120
好吧 我会多用点心
Alright, I'm gonna put more effort in.

570
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:56,370
今晚吗?
Tonight?

571
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,870
-好 -你还想要我吗?
- Okay. - You want me?

572
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,750
想啊 我想
Yeah, I want you.

573
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,000
再说一遍
Say it again.

574
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,250
我…我想要你 对
I... I want you, yeah.

575
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,120
-晚饭前还是晚饭后?-格蕾丝 你真是的
- Before or after dinner? - Grace, man.

576
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,750
-能不能有点他妈的主见 -天啊 真是受够了
- Just have a fucking opinion. - Jesus fucking Christ!

577
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:23,500
等我们回家以后?
When we get home?

578
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:25,370
行
Yeah.

579
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:27,750
我们一回家就做?
You'll fuck me when we get home?

580
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:28,870
行
Yeah.

581
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:31,000
在车里?
In the car?

582
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,370
如果你想的话
If you like.

583
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:35,750
我们以前总在车里做 记得吗?
We used to fuck in the car all the time, remember?

584
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:37,500
嗯
Uh-huh.

585
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,500
我解开安全带 爬到你这边 然后你就上我?
I'll unbuckle, come over to your seat and you'll fuck me?

586
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,370
对
Yes.

587
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:49,370
对
Yes.

588
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:05,250
别闹了 我妈就在那里呢
Come on. My mom's right there.

589
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:06,870
那你就快点上我
Fuck me quickly, then.

590
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,750
别…

591
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,250
格蕾丝 别这样 我只是有点…
Grace, come on. I'm just kinda...

592
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,120
你这没用的阳痿废物
You impotent piece of shit.

593
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,370
一无是处的死基佬
You useless fucking faggot!

594
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,620
你他妈疯了
You're fucking insane.

595
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,620
疯得一塌糊涂
Fucking insane.

596
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,370
都还好吧?
Everything okay?

597
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,370
-开门 我要上厕所 -去外面尿去
- Open the door. I need to use it. - Piss outside.

598
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,750
我又不是要尿尿
I don't need to piss.

599
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
那就拉到草丛里去 关我屁事
Shit in a bush. I don't care.

600
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,870
天啊 格蕾丝
Oh, God, Grace!

601
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:13,370
格蕾丝
Grace!

602
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:20,120
我不想拉草丛里 我想在马桶上拉
I don't wanna shit in a bush. I wanna shit in the toilet.

603
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:26,370
快点 我要憋不住了
Come on, it's coming out.

604
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,750
快点啊
Come on.

605
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,370
一会儿就要拉得满地都是了
It's gonna be all over the floor.

606
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,500
我已经闻到味儿了
I'm starting to smell it.

607
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,250
快点
Quick.

608
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,370
谢谢
Thank you.

609
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:49,250
我的天
Jesus Christ.

610
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,120
拜托别跑
No running, please.

611
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,370
-嗨 进来吧 -嘿
- Hi. Hey! Come on in. - Hey.

612
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,750
格雷格
Greg!

613
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,250
是啊 格雷格说咱这点吃的够全村人吃了
Yeah. Greg said we have enough food to feed a village.

614
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:24,750
反正我们就准备了这么多 是吧?
Well, that's what we've got, right?

615
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,120
那你们就再把这些算上吧
Well, you can add these, I guess.

616
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,620
在车上给颠翻了 之前好看多了
They fell over in the car. They looked better before.

617
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:31,370
你手指怎么了?
What happened to your fingers?

618
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,370
想给你烤个蛋糕 把手给烫了
I burnt them trying to bake you a cake.

619
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,870
-嘿 兄弟 -你来了 兄弟 欢迎啊
- Hey, man. - There you are. Welcome, buddy.

620
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,870

- Good to see you. - You too, man.

621
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,870
-嗨 -这地方布置得真不错
- Hi. - The place looks great.

622
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,750
你家宝宝真漂亮
He's such a beautiful baby.

623
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,870
-杰克 来 我给你倒杯喝的 -他要不要吃点小零食?
- Jack, let's get you a drink. - Does he want a snack?

624
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,370
-好啊 跟其他小孩吃一样就行 -行他不过敏吧?
-- Sure. Whatever the kids are having. - Okay. No allergies?

625
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,870
不过敏 应该没有
No. I don't think so.

626
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,000
谁是小甜心呀?
Who's a sweetie-pie?

627
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,620
这是杰克的宝贝儿子
Here's Jack's boy.

628
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:04,120
你们看见这个了吗
Did you guys see this?

629
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:15,620
那你们还会再要一个吗?
So, you think you'll have another one?

630
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,750
会啊 现在已经怀上了 一次来俩
Yeah. Pregnant now. Cookin' up twins.

631
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,120
你手怎么了?
What happened to your hands?

632
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,620
哦
Oh.

633
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,750
你该看看那面墙
You should see the wall.

634
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:28,120
是啊 我…
Yeah, I...

635
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,870
我现在有两个孩子 然后…
I have two kids, and...

636
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,500
说实话 两个已经够多了
and two is a lot, if I'm being honest.

637
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,250
看得出来
Seems like it.

638
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:39,120
不过 宝宝是真的很难带
Babies, though, babies are hard.

639
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,870
我觉得没人把这件事讲够
I don't think anybody talks about that enough.

640
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,750
所有人都在说这个
It's all anyone talks about.

641
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:46,250
整个人都会变掉的
It changes you.

642
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:50,620
头六个月我差点疯了
I think I nearly lost my mind for the first six months.

643
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,870
那你觉得什么时候能好?
When do you think you'll be getting it back?

644
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:02,120
你知道吗 产后抑郁比大家以为的
You know, postnatal depression is so much more common

645
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,500
常见多了
than people think.

646
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,870
-格蕾丝你平时做什么工作?- 我不工作
- What do you do for work, Grace? - I don't.

647
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:15,750
我现在就卡在既想做点什么 又完全不想…
I'm stuck between wanting to do something and not wanting to d...

648
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,250
做之间
anything at all.

649
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:22,370
等等 雪莉说过你是个作家
Hang on. Cheryl mentioned that you're a writer.

650
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,870
真不错 那一定挺好的
That's cute. That must be nice.

651
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,870
能围着孩子穿插着做点事
Having something you can squeeze around a baby.

652
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,750
不 我现在已经不写了
Yeah, I don't do that anymore.

653
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,750
怎么不写了?没灵感了?
Why not? Stuck for inspiration?

654
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:32,620
我相信会回来的
I'm sure it'll come back.

655
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:47,500
格蕾丝?
Grace?

656
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,370
格蕾丝
Grace!

657

- Can you breathe? - Somebody get some water.

659
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,000
-杰克森 -我打电话叫人
- Jackson? - Let me call someone.

660
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,870
-怎么了 胸口疼?-嗯
- What, your chest hurts? -- Yeah.

661
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,620
你还能呼吸 跟着我一起呼吸
You can breathe. Breathe with me.

662
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,620
对吧 你看?
Yeah. See?

663
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,870
好 你没事 你没事的
Yeah, you're okay. You're okay.

664
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,620
他没事了
He's okay.

665
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,370
这算是个提醒 你懂吧?
It's just kind of a wake-up call, you know.

666
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,120
格蕾丝 我们得互相照顾
We need to look out for each other, Grace.

667
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
我现在压力真的很大
I am getting really stressed.

668
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,620
什么压力?
About what?

669
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:11,120
没人动我们的点心 你看到了吗?
No one took our pastries. You see that?

670
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,870
有一大堆别的吃的呢
Well, there was a ton of food.

671
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,370
很没礼貌
It's rude.

672
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,870
人家不是没礼貌 别这样
They weren't being rude. Come on.

673
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,370
你知道什么才叫没礼貌吗 格蕾丝?
You know what's rude, Grace?

674
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,620
穿着他妈的内衣跳进一池子小孩中间游泳
Getting into a pool full of kids in your fucking underwear.

675
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,620
那才叫没礼貌
That's what's rude.

676
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,120
你让我很丢脸
You embarrassed me.

677
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,620
你让我们俩都丢脸了
You embarrassed us.

678
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,370
格蕾丝 格蕾丝
Grace.Grace!

679
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,620
我靠
Goddammit!

680
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:50,120
我靠 真他妈的
Fuck me. Jesus fucking Christ.

681
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,370
以后别再这样了
Don't ever do that again.

682
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:59,120
听见没?
Alright?

683
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,870
艾米莉娅还是个小女孩的时候
When Amelia was a little girl,

684
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,870
她喜欢幻想自己能展开翅膀
she liked to imagine she could stretch her wings

685
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,120
像鸟儿一样飞起来
and fly like a bird.

686
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,620
有一天她坐上了飞机
One day she got to ride on an airplane

687
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:18,620
喜欢得再也不愿落地
and liked it so much she didn't wanna ever come down.

688
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,120
世界看起来那么小
The world looked so small,

689
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,120
房子和车子都像玩具一样
the houses and cars were like toys.

690
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:27,500
她们飞了成千上万里路
They flew for thousands of miles.

691
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,000
越过海洋和丛林
Over oceans and jungles.

692
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:35,120
有人说她们疯了
Some people thought they were crazy.

693
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:39,870
可艾米莉娅一点也不怕经历千百次冒险
But Amelia wasn't afraid of having a thousand adventures.

694
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,620
于是她继续像鸟一样 飞得比所有人都要远
So she flew on like a bird, further than anyone had gone before,

695
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,750
再也没有回来
never to return.

696
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,120
什么鬼?
What the fuck?

697
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
你想结婚吗?
You wanna get married?

698
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,620
想
Yeah.

699
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,370
想 他妈的当然想了
Yeah, fuck yeah.

700
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:43,250
她不爱吃溏心蛋
She don't like Her eggs all runny

701
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:46,120
她觉得翘二郎腿很好玩
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny

702
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:49,250
她对金钱不屑一顾
She looks down her nose at money

703
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:52,620
她疯起来像复活节的兔子
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny

704
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:55,500
她是我的宝贝 我是她的甜心
She's my baby, I'm her honey

705
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,870
我永远不会放她走
Never gonna let her go

706
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:03,120
他有很久没碰过女人
He ain't got laid In a month of Sundays

707
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:06,500
有回我撞见他在闻我的内裤
I caught him once And he was sniffin' my undies

708
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:09,870
他脑子不太灵光但却能成事
He ain't too sharp But he gets things done

709
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,120
喝起啤酒来像在呼吸空气
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen

710
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:16,120
他是我的宝贝 我是他的甜心
He's my baby and I'm his honey

711
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,870
我这辈子都不会放他走
I'm never gonna let him go

712
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,250
就算再怎么不成体统
In spite of ourselves

713
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:26,620
最后也会一起坐在彩虹上
We'll end up a-sittin' on a rainbow

714
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,750
哪怕所有人都不看好
Against all odds

715
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:32,500
亲爱的咱俩就是那头奖大奖
Honey, we're the big door prize

716
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:38,750
宁可割掉鼻子也要跟自己较劲到底
We're gonna spite Our noses right off of our faces

717
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:44,000
到头来眼里只剩两颗心在欢跳
There won't be nothing' But big old hearts dancin' in our eyes

718
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,370
天啊 真的假的?
Oh, my God. Really?

719
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:44,750
吻我
Kiss me.

720
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:46,370
-吻我 -格蕾丝
- Kiss me. - Grace.

721
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,870
我不知道杰克森在哪
I don't know where Jackson is.

722
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,370
我们去找找你那没用的老公吧
Let's go find that no-count husband of yours.

723
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:41,620
哇
Wow.

724
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:56,500
你好 我是新娘 在新娘套房
Hello. This is the bride in the bridal suite.

725
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:00,120
想问能不能给我房间送一桶冰上来
I was wondering if I could get a bucket of ice sent up to my room.

726
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:03,370
本楼层有制冰机
We've got an ice machine on your floor

727
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,620
就在走廊尽头
at the end of the corridor there.

728
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,500
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

729
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,250
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

730
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,620
查理
Charlie.

731
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:15,250
查理 能麻烦你帮我弄一桶上来吗?
Charlie, would you mind getting it for me, please?

732
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:18,000
我现在不太方便下楼
I'm a little indisposed.

733
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,370
我们不提供送冰服务 女士
We don't bring up ice, ma'am.

734
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:25,370
好吧
Okay.

735
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,120
你还在听吗?
Are you still there?

736
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:32,000
在的 女士 还有什么能帮您的?
Yes, ma'am. Is there anything else I can help you with?

737
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:38,750
嗯…我老公现在在楼下的宴会上
Well, my husband is at the party downstairs.

738
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,370
我们婚礼的宴会
Our wedding.

739
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:46,120
我在想 要是我们回房时香槟已经冰好了
Um... and I think it would be really nice

740
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:51,250
他一定会很高兴
if the champagne was cold for him when we came up.

741
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:52,620
我明白
I understand.

742
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,250
我只是想做个好太太
I'm just trying to be a good wife.

743
01:24:55,370 --> 01:25:01,370
是 不好意思 这个我帮不了
Yes. Sorry, but I can't help with that.

744
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:06,500
查理 你的声音真好听
You have a really beautiful voice, Charlie.

745
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:07,870
谢谢 女士
Thank you, ma'am.

746
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,620
我心中的野兽
The beast in me

747
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:18,000
已学会与痛苦共存
Has had to learn to live with pain

748
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:26,000
学会躲避风雨
And how to shelter from the rain

749
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:34,370
转眼之间
And in the twinkling of an eye

750
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:38,120
就得被人牢牢拴住
Might have to be restrained

751
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,870
上帝保佑
God help

752
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,370
我心中的野兽
The beast in me

753
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:42,370
那时候我大概…三岁吧?
I must have been about... three?

754
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,000
我跟爸妈一起去了海边
My parents and I went down to the beach.

755
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:51,620
他们大概在看书 也可能睡着了
They must have been reading, or maybe they fell asleep.

756
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:56,250
我把脚伸进水里
And I had my feet in the water,

757
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:58,370
然后有个女孩走过来
and then this girl came up to me.

758
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,750
她大概十岁左右
She must have been about ten,

759
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:05,870
可在我眼里 她就是那种…大人模样
but to me she seemed, you know, like a... like a grown-up.

760
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:12,750
她牵着我的手 我们一起走了一段路
And she took my hand and we walked for a while.

761
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,250
她给我买了根冰棍
She bought me an ice pop.

762
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:21,870
路人…
People would...

763
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,250
说我们俩好可爱
say how cute we were.

764
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,120
那感觉真的很好
It was really nice.

765
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:34,750
后来我爸妈发现我不见了 然后…
And then as my parents realised I was missing and...

766
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:39,750
我妈哭了
my mom was crying and...

767
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:41,620
我爸气疯了
my dad was really angry,

768
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:44,620
我记得当时我脑子里冒出一个念头
and I remember just thinking

769
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,870
“要是你们不是我爸妈就好了
"I wish you weren't mine.

770
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,250
我多希望…
"I wish...

771
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:57,750
我不是你们亲生的”
I didn't belong to you."

772
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:03,370
格蕾丝 你父母现在在哪儿?
Where are your parents now, Grace?

773
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,870
飞机失事去世了
They died in a plane crash.

774
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:12,000
那时你多大?
How old were you?

775
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:13,500
十岁
Ten.

776
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:18,000
那日子一定很不好过吧
It must have been terribly difficult.

777
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:26,000
所以 你可能会有点被抛弃的创伤感
Like, perhaps you have some abandonment issues.

778
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:33,750
让你很难安全地与人建立依存关系
Which makes it hard for you to safely attach to people.

779
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:48,620
比如对你丈夫 对你儿子
Your husband. To your son.

780
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:51,500
我跟我儿子没问题
I don't have a problem attaching to my son.

781
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,120
他很完美
He's perfect.

782
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:58,370
糟糕的是其他所有的一切
It's everything else that's fucked.

783
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:17,000
嗨
Hi!

784
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,750
嗨 宝贝
Hi, baby.

785
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:22,620
哦 妈妈想死你了
Oh, I missed you.

786
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:30,370
怎么了?
What?

787
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,370
你租的车?
You got a rental?

788
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:39,000
不啊 是我们的 从格雷格那里弄的
No, it's ours. I got it off Greg.

789
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,000
你哪来的钱?
With what money?

790
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,870
别操心 他能搞定
Don't worry about it. He's taking care of us.

791
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
你喜欢吗?
You like it?

792
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:52,750
嗯 挺酷的 够大
Yeah, it's cool. Big.

793
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,620
开大点声 我喜欢这歌
Turn this up. I love this song.

794
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:13,870
记得你说过不喜欢吉他的
Thought you didn't like guitars.

795
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,250
我什么时候说过?我可爱死吉他了
When did I ever say that? I love guitars.

796
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:27,500
你愿留在我们的爱情故事里吗?
Will you stay In our lovers' story?

797
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:30,620
若你留下 绝不会后悔
If you stay, you won't be sorry

798
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:34,620
因为我们相信你
'Cause we believe in you

799
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:38,000
你很快就会长大 何不试一试
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance

800
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:43,750
跟这对爱做梦的怪人一起谈情说爱
With a couple of kooks Hung up on romancing

801
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:47,120
你愿留在我们的爱情故事里吗?
Will you stay in our lovers' story?

802
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:50,500
若你留下 绝不会后悔
If you stay, you won't be sorry

803
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:08,750
还好吧 小子 来
Doing alright there, bud? Come on, now.

804
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,870
他好可爱
He's so cute.

805
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,620
我好喜欢他这顶小帽子
I love his little hat.

806
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:24,250
他其实不太爱戴 对吧 小家伙?
He's not really a fan. Are you, buddy?

807
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:28,000
我平常也给一个差不多大的宝宝当保姆 不过你家的更可爱
I babysit a kid just like him. Yours is cuter, though.

808
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,620
他下过水了吗?
Has he been in the water yet?

809
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,120
还没有
No, not yet.

810
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,620
我们可以带他到水边去
We could take him to the edge.

811
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:33,870
你觉得他会跟我们走吗?
Do you think he'll go with us?

812
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:37,000
会的 你很爱交际 对吧?
Yeah. You're very social, aren't you?

813
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,750
要是他想 我们还能帮他堆个城堡
We can make him a castle if he wants.

814
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,120
我们就走到那儿 你看得见的
If we go just there, we'll be in sight.

815
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,000

01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,370
哈利

来吧哈利
Come on, Harry.

820
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,870
那是什么?
What is that?

821
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,750
是啊 他妈的当然是
Yeah, fuck yeah.

822
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:27,250
别这样了
Stop it!

823
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,370
你刚才睡着的时候一直在说对不起
You kept saying sorry when you were sleeping.

824
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:59,500
我进来的时候 你还在说
When I came in, you were saying it.

825
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,500
为什么道歉?
What are you sorry about?

826
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:07,000
我不记得了
I don't remember.

827
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:10,750
你觉得需要为任何事情道歉吗?
Do you think you need to apologise for anything?

828
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:14,620
没有
No.

829
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:19,250
我必须起来吗?
Do I have to get up?

830
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:23,750
不用 格蕾丝 你什么都不用做
No, Grace. You don't need to do anything.

831
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,750
我可以一直躺着?
I can just stay in bed?

832
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,870
如果你想的话
If that's what you want.

833
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:31,500
哦
Oh.

834
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:34,370
是你啊
It's you.

835
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,500
你好吗?
How are you?

836

大家都很想你
Everyone misses you.

837
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,000
宝贝 你要进来吗?
Coming in, babe?

838
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:41,620
嗯
Yeah.

839
01:40:31,370 --> 01:40:33,500
我把这儿稍微收拾了一下
Fixed it up a little bit.

840
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:36,750
看起来不错
Looks nice.

841
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:38,250

甜蜜地爱我
Love me sweet

844
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:52,620
别让我…
Never let me...

845
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:55,000
你真漂亮 格蕾丝
You're so beautiful, Grace.

846
01:41:56,750 --> 01:42:02,500
是你让我的人生如此完整
You have made my life complete

847
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:06,870
我也如此地爱你
And I love you so

848
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:12,620
温柔地爱我
Love me tender

849
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:15,000
真心地爱我
Love me true

850
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:20,500
让我的所有梦想都能实现
All my dreams fulfil

851
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:28,500
因为亲爱的 我爱你
For my darlin', I love you

852
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:33,620
我将永远爱你
And I always will

853
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:38,120
温柔地爱我
Love me tender

854
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:41,370
长久地爱我
Love me long

855
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:46,120
把我放进你心里
Take me to your heart

856
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:53,870
因为那里才是我的归宿
For it's there that I belong

857
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,750
我们将永不…
And we'll never...

858
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:59,370
哦 格蕾丝 你气色真好
Oh, Grace. You look so well.

859
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:03,000
-你能回家真是太好了 -你看上去好多了
- It's so great that you're home. - You look so healthy.

860
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,870
谢谢
Thanks.

861
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,120
有时候人就是需要离开一阵子 对吧?
Sometimes all we need is just a little break, right?

862
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:13,620
说真的 你和杰克森能拥有彼此挺幸运的
You know what? You and Jackson are really lucky to have each other.

863
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:15,000
嗯 是啊
Mm-hmm, yeah.

864
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:45,620
-格蕾丝 见到你真好 -我也是
- Grace, it is so good to see you. - You too.

865
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:48,250
-你看起来精神好多了 -谢谢
- You look so well. - Thank you.

866
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:51,870
我是说真的 你真的好多了
No, but really, you just look so much better.

867
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,370
你也是
You too.

868
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:57,000
你也好太多了
You look a lot better.

869
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,000
-这里都还好吧?-嗯 挺好的
- All good here? - Yeah, doing great.

870
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,120
我们都比以前好多了
We're both doing a lot better than we were.

871
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:03,500
-玩得开心吗?-开心极了
- You having a good time? - The best.

872
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:06,750
- 那就好 - 而且我真的特别感谢你
- That's good. - And I'm just so grateful to you.

873
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,370
把所有东西都顾得这么好
For taking care of everything.

874
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,250
还把房子刷了新漆…
And painting the house...

875
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,870
-还帮忙带孩子 -你真贴心
- Taking care of the baby. - That's sweet.

876
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,500
还把我送进那鬼地方 你真是太好了
Having me fucking committed. You're just the best.

877
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:19,500
-好了 格蕾丝 别闹了 -我说的是实话
- Okay, Grace, come on. - But I mean it.

878
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:20,750
-谢谢你啊 - 求你了 别这样
- Thank you. - Please. Don't do this.

879
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:22,250
别哪样?
Don't do what?

880
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:25,120
我开枪打死了一条狗 它当时很痛苦
I shot a dog! It was in pain.

881
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:27,620
我们来到这世上 为所欲为
We came to be and we ran amok!

882
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:30,370
愿我们长命百岁 然后断子绝孙
May we live long and die out.

883
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:34,620
没错
Yes.

884
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:37,000
愿我们长命百岁
May we live long

885
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,620
然后断子绝孙
and die out.

886
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:48,500
格蕾丝
Grace.

887
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:50,370
潘姆
Pam.

888
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:08,750
格蕾丝
Grace.

889
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:11,000
别管她 杰克森
Leave her be, Jackson.

890
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:22,120
格蕾丝
Grace!

891
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,620
格蕾丝你在哪?
Where are you, Grace?

892
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:32,750
我就在这儿
I'm right here.

893
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:34,620
只是你看不见我
You just can't see me.

894
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:41,120
我回不去了
I can't go back.

895
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,500
我爱你
I love you.

896
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:07,120
我也爱你
I love you.

897
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:08,870
约翰·普林这首歌 简直是开车神曲
Perfect driving tune right here from John Prine.

898
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:21,120
我可以再努力一点
I can try harder.

899
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:32,500
她不爱吃溏心蛋
She don't like Her eggs all runny

900
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:35,370
她觉得翘二郎腿很好玩
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny

901
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:38,620
她对金钱不屑一顾
She looks down her nose at money

902
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:41,620
她疯起来像复活节的兔子
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny

903
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:44,870
她是我的宝贝 我是她的甜心
She's my baby, I'm her honey

904
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,370
我永远不会放她走
I'm never gonna let her go

905
01:46:49,370 --> 01:46:52,500
他有很久没碰过女人
He ain't got laid In a month of Sundays

906
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:55,750
有回我撞见他在闻我的内裤
Caught him once And he was sniffin' my undies

907
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,250
他脑子不太灵光 但却能成事
He ain't too sharp But he gets things done

908
01:46:59,370 --> 01:47:02,370
喝起啤酒来像在呼吸空气
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen

909
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:05,750
他是我的宝贝 我是他的甜心
He's my baby, I'm his honey

910
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:08,370
我这辈子都不会放他走
Never gonna let him go

911
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:11,620
就算再怎么不成体统
In spite of ourselves

912
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:16,000
最后也会一起坐在彩虹上
We'll end up sittin' on a rainbow

913
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:18,120
哪怕所有人都不看好
Against all odds

914
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:22,000
亲爱的 咱俩就是那头奖大奖
Honey, we're the big door prize

915
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:28,120
宁可割掉鼻子也要跟自己较劲到底
We're gonna spite our noses Right off of our faces

916
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:33,500
到头来眼里只剩两颗心在欢跳
There won't be nothin' But big old hearts dancin' in our eyes

917
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:27,750
够了
Enough.

918
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,750
格蕾丝
Grace!

919
01:51:04,370 --> 01:51:06,250
格蕾丝
Grace!

920
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:10,620
格蕾丝
Grace!

921
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:39,370
当乏味日常把人咬得生疼
When routine bites hard

922
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:43,370
当所有志气都已消磨殆尽
And ambitions are low

923
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:47,370
当怨恨逐渐高涨
And resentments ride high

924
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:51,370
情感却不再生长
But emotions won't grow

925
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:55,500
我们改变了方式
And we're changing our ways

926
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:58,750
走上不同的道路
Taking different roads

927
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:01,870
于是爱
Then love

928
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
爱会将我们撕裂
Love will tear us apart

929
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:08,120
一次又一次
Again

930
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:09,870
爱
Love

931
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,120
爱会将我们撕裂
Love will tear us apart

932
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,750
一次又一次
Again

933
01:53:15,870 --> 01:53:19,120
为何卧室如此冰冷
- Why is the bedroom so cold?

934
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:23,250
你背过身去不再面对我
You've turned away on your side

935
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:26,120
是我的时机总不对吗?
Is my timing that flawed?

936
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:31,120
我们彼此的尊重都被磨得干枯
Our respect runs so dry

937
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:35,120
可心里仍有一种莫名的吸引
Yet there's still this appeal

938
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:39,620
一直陪着我们走到如今
That we've kept through our lives

939
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:41,870
但爱
But love

940
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
爱会将我们撕裂
Love will tear us apart

941
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:48,120
一次又一次
Again

942
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:49,870
爱
Love

943
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,870
爱会将我们撕裂
Love will tear us apart

944
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:55,370
一次又一次
Again

945
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,370
你在睡梦中呼喊
You cry out in your sleep

946
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:03,500
把我所有失败都照得通明
All my failings exposed

947
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:07,500
嘴里满是苦涩的味道
There's a taste in my mouth

948
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:11,620
当绝望渐渐将我吞噬
As desperation takes hold

949
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:15,370
原本如此美好的事物
Just that something so good

950
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:18,750
却再也无法运转
Just can't function no more

951
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:21,870
于是爱
And love

952
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
爱会将我们撕裂
Love will tear us apart

953
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:28,120
一次又一次
Again

954
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:29,870
爱
Love

955
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:33,000
爱会将我们撕裂
Love will tear us apart

956
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,620
一次又一次
Again

957
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:01,500
于是爱会将我们撕裂一次又一次
And love

958
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:05,000
爱会将我们撕裂
Love will tear us apart

959
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:08,120
一次又一次
Again
