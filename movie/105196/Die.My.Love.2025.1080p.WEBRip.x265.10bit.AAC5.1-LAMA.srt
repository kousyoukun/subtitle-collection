3
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,500
- Oh man.
- Wow.

4
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,917
I haven't been here
since I was a little kid.

5
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,416
I thought you grew up here.

6
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,208
Like round the corner.

7
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,208
I knocked my tooth out on that step.

8
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,292
Got me brain damaged.

9
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,167
It's not New York but it's ours.

10
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,125
I think it's gonna be pretty sick.

11
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,375
Yeah?

12
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,749
- I could send for my drum kit?
- No way.

13
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,083
No?

14
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,207
My uncle was a hoarder.

15
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,625
I didn't realise how much space
there was in here.

16
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,749
It's peaceful.

17
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,500
I can just record
an album out here so easily.

18
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,291
- Gracie!
- What?

19
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,917
I found an office!

20
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,000
You can write
your Great American Novel up here.

21
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,374
Whoa!

22
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,167
What?

23
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:24,125
It's alright.
It's just a little rat situation.

24
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,082
We should get a cat.

25
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,875
You can write all day, every day.
Nothing but the birds singing.

26
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,542
How did he die?

27
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,625
I don't know.

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,125
Here we are.

29
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,125
We need a broom.

30
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,916
Hey, hey, hey.

31
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,125
Hey!

32
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,500
Hey.

33
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,750
Hey! Where's your mommy?

34
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,250
Pumpkin, where's your mommy?

35
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,208
Oh, no!

36
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,833
Where's Mommy?

37
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,125
Oh, God.

38
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:27,875
Grace.

39
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,000
Mom wanted to stop by.

40
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,208
Oh?

41
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,374
I told her it wasn't a big deal.
It's like a "us" thing.

42
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,583
And it's just for six months,
anyway, so...

43
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,582
I just feel kind of bad,

44
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,958
'cause I think she just wants the company.

45
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,625
I don't mind her coming.

46
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:28,625
It's weird. It's like she doesn't
know how to function any more.

47
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,832
She's still cooking for two people.
Did she tell you that?

48
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,500
It's too sweet.

49
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,167
Yeah? No, it's nice.

50
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:40,957
He liked it.

51
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,667
A real mom would have baked a cake.

52
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,792
Want another one?

53
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,542
Why is it so fuckin' hot?

54
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,583
"Why is it so fuckin' hot?"

55
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,832
"Why is it so fuckin' hot?"

56
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,625
It's always hot.

57
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,417
Boy's asleep.

58
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,917
You wanna look?

59
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,250
How can you not give a shit
about the stars, Grace?

60
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,708
Well, they make me feel like... nothing.

61
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,833
I like that they make me feel like I'm
part of something bigger.

62
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,124
You like to feel like nothing?

63
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,166
No.

64
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,958
You know how many universes
there are out there?

65
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,874
What are we doing in
the different universe? Are we together?

66
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,042
Sure we are.

67
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,208
Am I a rock star?

68
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,000
Can you sing in a different universe?

69
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,708
Hey.

70
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,333
Yeah, I'm sure you're a rock star.

71
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,583
Do we fuck?

72
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,958
All the time?

73
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,625
Hey, what?

74
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,083
Do. We. Fuck?

75
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,417
Like rabbits.

76
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,333
Do you hear him?

77
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,542
No.

78
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,625
He's crying. Listen.

79
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,917
Grace, it's totally silent.

80
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,250
Am I boring you?

81
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,458
Not you. The universe.
Who gives a shit?

82
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,666
<i>...and a wild party mom...</i>

83
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:03,666
<i>I'm very well known as Big Bouncy,
the over-the-hill party girl.</i>

84
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,583
<i>...swap lives for two weeks.</i>

85
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:09,042
- <i>I hope you survive.</i>
- <i>Bye!</i>

86
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,374
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

87
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,082
<i>Loretta's appearance,
I don't think it's appropriate.</i>

88
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,582
<i>We are two worlds apart.</i>

89
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,332
<i>I've never seen anything good
come out of alcohol.</i>

90
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,499
<i>I've never killed an animal before.</i>

91
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,582
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

92
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,041
<i>I'm talking!</i>

93
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:27,333
<i>I've never seen
a more disrespectful child.</i>

94
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,208
<i>Does it feel like a girl?</i>

95
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,167
<i>What does a girl feel like?</i>

96
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,167
<i>If it moves more on the right,
then you're probably having a boy.</i>

97
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,042
<i>You didn't wanna know?</i>

98
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:23,416
Grace, I... didn't find out
what I was having either.

99
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,707
I think that's nice.

100
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,999
You didn't find out
'cause you wanted a girl.

101
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,083
Ha, ha.

102
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,041
Oh, gosh. He forgets to drink.

103
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,707
- Harry, you gotta have a drink.
- He's fine.

104
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,499
No, I wanted a baby.
I wanted whoever was in there.

105
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,207
Yeah? And you got Jackson?

106
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,707
Unlucky.

107
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,167
I heard that, Auntie Jen.

108
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,500
Are you off your food, Grace?

109
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,832
- Leave her alone.
- You didn't eat.

110
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,625
Being pregnant
makes your stomach shrink.

111
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,416
That's bullshit.

112
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:55,707
It's sucking on you
every minute of the day.

113
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,249
Then you'll be famished.
I couldn't get enough in me.

114
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,957
That never went away, did it?

115
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,791
You can talk.
What's your excuse?

116
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:05,958
Never had a baby in there but always
ate as though you just dropped triplets.

117
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,082
You know, Grace,
if you get a screamer...

118
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,999
She's not gonna get a screamer.

119
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,124
- Jackson was a screamer.
- That's a lie.

120
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,666
Jackson was a sweetheart.

121
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,707
The point is, if you do,
let the baby cry.

122
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,082
Just walk away from it.
Don't let yourself get tired, stressed.

123
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,040
That's a horrible thing to say.

124
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,832
Slow fuckin' death.

125
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,457
If you're not at your best, it's no good
for anyone, especially the baby.

126
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,082
And a crying baby
doesn't mean it's in pain.

127
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,832
It's the only way they have
of communicating.

128
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,916
No, it's not.

129
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,833
People only say that so they can walk
away from their kid.

130
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,874
Anyway, all I do is take care of Harry.

131
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,416
- Barely.
- If you need me...

132
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,957
- She doesn't.
- ...we're just a walk away.

133
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,000
What you doing in here, Pop?
Wanna watch the Grizzlies?

134
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,417
Wanna open some of those presents?

135
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,625
- Whose presents?
- For the baby.

136
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,457
No, I gotta sort out these shoes.

137
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,208
- Okay.
- They're the wrong ones.

138
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,249
They look good to me.

139
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,832
- You had enough to eat, Mom?
- Honey, I'm stuffed.

140
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,417
Would you get your dad
something to drink, please?

141
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,792
No more pie.

142
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,083
Well, I'm stuffed.

143
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,666
Can't stop eating.
It's the same every holiday.

144
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,832
Well, you can.
You've always been skinny.

145
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,582
Grace likes me lean.
Don't you, baby?

146
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,833
You can starve in January.

147
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,291
What are y'all doing?
Why are y'all here?

148
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,457
This is Frank's house.

149
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,999
It's his house.

150
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,541
Harry, this is Grace and Jackson's--

151
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,874
No, this is my brother's house.

152
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,416
Sweetheart, Frank's not here.

153
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,917
Get out of my brother's house!

154
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,208
Jackson.

155
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,208
Harry.

156
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:01,875
Harry!

157
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,250
Did you find the right size?

158
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:24,875
Hello.

159
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,375
Hello.

160
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,957
Is it a baby?

161
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,042
- A baby.
- A boy?

162
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,832
I don't know. I think, maybe.

163
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,000
It is.

164
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,082
Oh?

165
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,167
Don't leave him to cry.

166
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,792
I won't.

167
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,042
You know,
when he comes, he's a cat.

168
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,417
He's a bear and a baby.

169
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,667
And he's you, he's all of you.
He's gonna be so funny.

170
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,791
Hi. Find everything you're looking for?

171
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,375
In life?

172
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,124
Any gas for your car?

173
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,041
- No.
- Alrighty.

174
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:27,749
I love this stuff. Whatever they put
in that powder, it's like magic.

175
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,041
It's two for six dollars
if you want another.

176
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,499
- I'm good.
- This one's four.

177
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,374
- And the other one is two.
- I get it.

178
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,374
- No, thanks.
- He's a boy, right?

179
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,874
He's so cute.
Hi there, handsome.

180
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,750
Hi there, sweetie-pie.

181
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,541
- Does he have a name?
- No.

182
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,333
We decided not to name him.

183
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,582
How old are you, sweetie?
Wait. Let me guess.

184
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:54,541
I'm really good at this.
About six months?

185
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,457
Why are you talking?

186
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,291
Do you ever think about
what you're gonna say?

187
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,750
Or do you just open your mouth
and blah, blah, blah, blah?

188
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:07,417
In about 30 seconds, I'll be gone.
We don't need to speak.

189
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,083
Okay.

190
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,875
Alrighty.

191
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,125
Alrighty.

192
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:23,208
Alrighty. Alrighty. Alrighty.

193
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:55,125
- Hey.
- Hey.

194
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,332
What you doing up, little bug?

195
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,457
I was bored.

196
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,542
You got bored,
so you kept the baby up?

197
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,000
I got somethin' for you.

198
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:12,708
What the fuck, Jackson?
You got a dog?

199
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:14,500
Got a dog.

200
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,916
Look at him.

201
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,708
We need a cat.

202
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,457
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

203
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,874
Good dog. Good baby.

204
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,625
You're a good baby. Yes, you are.

205
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:32,917
Hey.

206
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:40,958
Come here.

207
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,000
Come on.
Everyone but me.

208
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,417
Yeah.

209
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,083
Hey.

210
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,417
Wanna see some magic?

211
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,125
Wanna see a magic trick?

212
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,582
Gonna sit nice?

213
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,541
Yeah, sit.

214
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:19,000
That's a good boy.

215
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,083
That's a good boy.

216
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,583
Stir it up.
You stir it up.

217
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,208
Second.

218
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,875
Magic.

219
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,375
Ready?
We're ready to steer. Okay.

220
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,542
Ready to drive?

221
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
To the moon.

222
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,375
And a left to New York.

223
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,792
What is that?
Do you feel that?

224
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,542
<i>Where are you now?</i>

225
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:10,292
<i>In a burger place
outside of Nampa. 84.</i>

226
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:13,375
<i>You're eating?</i>

227
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,583
Mm-hm.

228
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,041
<i>A burger?</i>

229
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,250
<i>Yep.</i>

230
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,917
- Is it good?
<i>- Yeah, it's alright.</i>

231
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,875
Well, what else have you been doing?

232
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,124
<i>Working.</i>

233
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:36,125
Uh-huh. What else?

234
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,291
Is everything alright?

235
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:45,125
<i>I'm asking you about your day.
This is a conversation.</i>

236
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,875
- What have you been up to?
- Nothin'.

237
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,375
<i>Have you been writing?</i>

238
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,624
<i>I'll call you
when I get closer, okay?</i>

239
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,707
Well, are you gonna wanna eat?

240
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:07,625
<i>Yeah, we can have dinner when I get back.
It's gonna be kind of late, though.</i>

241
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:10,333
<i>Anything else for you?</i>

242
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,583
<i>What sounds good for supper?</i>

243
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:16,874
<i>How's the boy?</i>

244
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,666
He's sleeping.

245
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,624
<i>- Hey, darlin'. Here's your check.
- Alright, talk later.</i>

246
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:22,916
<i>Thank you, baby.</i>

247
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,708
Okay. Bye.

248
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,208
Pam?

249
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:48,625
Pam?

250
00:34:58,792 --> 00:34:59,917
Pam?

251
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,125
Pam?

252
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:32,333
Fuck! Oh, goddammit.

253
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,082
Pam, what the hell?

254
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,500
You snuck in.

255
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,625
I didn't sneak.

256
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,499
I brought the baby.

257
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
- You brought the baby.
- He's asleep.

258
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,332
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

259
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,249
As long as you don't blow my brains out.

260
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,874
That thing loaded, Pam?

261
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:52,332
Oh, yeah. It's Harry's.

262
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,667
He used to sleep with it next to him.

263
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,417
Made him feel safe.

264
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,707
I don't know
what to do with it now.

265
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,708
I don't know what to do
with any of it.

266
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,708
I never do my hair.

267
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,667
It's pretty.

268
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,042
Harry likes it loose.

269
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,667
Yeah?

270
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:24,958
You sleeping at all?

271
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,542
Oh... you know.

272
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,917
Jackson says
you've been sleepwalking.

273
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,792
Oh, yeah. That.

274
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,333
You get far?

275
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:43,583
Woke up on Culver Road
screaming my head off.

276
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,042
Never done anything like that before.

277
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:54,208
Nothing seems real since...

278
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,167
since he died.

279
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:03,500
My brain just seems... chopped up.

280
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:25,375
Yeah. I'm your grandma.
Yeah, I am.

281
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:37,250
It's so wonderful the two of you
have taken on the house.

282
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,083
Mm-hm.

283
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:47,500
He was... such a happy little guy, Frank.

284
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,624
He shot himself?

285
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,124
- Uncle Frank?
- Yes.

286
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,167
And you found him?

287
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,457
I did.

288
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:02,292
- That must have been awful.
- Yes, I did. It was.

289
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,333
It was.

290
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,375
In the head?

291
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,875
In the head?

292
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,208
No.

293
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:22,083
- I can't...
- Well, where, then?

294
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,625
The heart? Chest?

295
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:28,500
No.

296
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,624
- Legs, feet, back?
- No.

297
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,541
- Arms? Stomach?
- No, no.

298
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,333
Dick?

299
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,542
- Grace.
- Ass?

300
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:43,833
Oh, my God. He shot himself
in his own ass intentionally?

301
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,917
You know, he looks just like you.

302
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:57,792
- Uncle Frank?
- No. The baby, you goose.

303
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,041
You think?

304
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:03,875
Yeah. Yeah.

305
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,042
Grace, you know, everybody
goes a little loopy the first year.

306
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,250
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

307
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,916
You and Harry have known
each other your whole lives.

308
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,624
Of course you're gonna go
a bit loopy.

309
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,749
No, no. I mean you.

310
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,749
After a baby.

311
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,541
My mother went nuts.
Jen lost it.

312
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:37,625
I didn't feel myself for a while.
But you'll... you'll...

313
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,375
You'll come back.

314
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,250
You know...

315
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:55,583
- if you're having a hard time--
- I feel fine.

316
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,792
We'll come again soon.

317
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:01,625
Thanks for the tea.

318
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:19,917
Who's pushing you?

319
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:23,333
Is that a ghost?

320
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:34,832
<i>Red and yellow</i>

321
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:39,666
<i>And pink and green</i>

322
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:46,125
<i>Purple and orange and blue</i>

323
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,958
<i>I can sing a rainbow</i>

324
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,750
<i>Sing a rainbow</i>

325
00:40:56,583 --> 00:41:03,042
<i>Sing a rainbow too</i>

326
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:18,708
<i>Listen with your eyes</i>

327
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:22,874
<i>Listen with your eyes</i>

328
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:28,125
<i>And sing everything you see</i>

329
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,542
What the fuck do you want?

330
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,333
Cut your lip.

331
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:52,875
Cut it.

332
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:35,208
Woof, woof, woof.
Boop, boop, boop.

333
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:50,625
Just gonna leave it?

334
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,166
He's your girlfriend.
You clean it.

335
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,457
Nice.

336
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,791
He pissed on the floor too.

337
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:59,166
You should make better choices
in who you bring home.

338
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,041
- Fuck's sake, Grace.
- You're mad at me?

339
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:03,166
Why didn't you let him out,
you whack job?

340
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,417
He's not my problem.

341
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,374
Just put him on his leash,
take him out the back

342
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,416
until he gets used to where he is.

343
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,041
Yeah, I'm not gonna train
your fucking dog.

344
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:16,041
- We have a baby.
- No shit.

345
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:19,082
I can't have this...
This place is a fucking hole.

346
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,624
- And you moved us into it.
- I am working.

347
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:24,291
When I come home,
I'm the one cleaning everything up.

348
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:27,707
Yeah, three days a week.
Let me shower you in medals.

349
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:31,082
- Shut up.
- You have an ashtray on the carpet.

350
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:34,541
- You don't think the baby's eating that?
- Shut up.

351
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:37,166
Move us into the house
where your uncle shot himself

352
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,499
up the fucking ass.

353
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,583
- Oh, my God.
- Up the ass. Up the fucking ass.

354
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,208
- Stop.
- I knew it. I knew it.

355
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:48,791
Why are your shorts undone?
Why do you not have your shorts on?

356
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:50,166
- Shut up.
- Jesus Chr--

357
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,041
Fucking sanctimonious dick.

358
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:54,624
You probably pissed on the floor.
Blamed it on the dog.

359
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,082
It was your mangy dog.
And "sanctimonious" means

360
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:59,874
you think you're morally
superior to others, dummy.

361
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:02,291
- How's the book going, by the way?
- Fantastic, thank you!

362
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,874
Your Great American Novel.

363
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:07,249
The main character's about to batter
her husband to death with a hammer.

364
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,416
- Sounds like shit.
- Well, you can't read, so...

365
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:13,832
Maybe if I spend a little less time
with my hands down my pants

366
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,707
and a little more time writing,

367
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:19,082
maybe I'd write something, maybe.

368
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,416
My hands are
down my pants

369
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:23,333
'cause you put your dick everywhere
except there, asshole!

370
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:39,124
- You're gonna wake up the baby.
- Now you're worried about the baby.

371
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,791
I'm always worried
about the fucking baby.

372
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,457
- We're going for a drive.
- No.

373
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,457
- Yes! We are.
- No.

374
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:45,791
- Get in, Grace.
- Fuck off.

375
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:47,707
- We need to talk.
- We can talk here.

376
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:50,250
- Get in the fucking car!
- Fucking no!

377
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,624
Jackson,
I'm not leaving the baby.

378
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:53,999
Stop, stop, stop.

379
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,666
I'm not leaving the baby.
Jackson!

380
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:57,999
- The baby's fine.
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

381
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,625
You're a fucking... fucking asshole!

382
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,958
What is wrong with you?

383
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,457
- Seriously?
- Give me the belt.

384
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:12,958
Oh, my God.

385
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,000
Don't you dare
open the door.

386
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,083
Gracie.

387
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:34,542
I was just...

388
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,583
Hey, bud, don't...

389
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:40,500
Stop. Stop.

390
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,416
Look, okay, I... I just think

391
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,291
we need to have a schedule
or somethin', or just...

392
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:04,708
I just wanna make a plan 'cause I...

393
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:10,541
Grace, I don't want you to think
that I don't appreciate

394
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:13,332
everything that you do, I just...

395
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:18,667
Like, you're the glue,
you're the one, you're the OG, but...

396
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:25,624
If you're not feeling good,
then, I don't know,

397
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:27,667
maybe we should,
like, talk about it.

398
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,042
I just want you to know
that I'm here.

399
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:42,667
Having a baby is like the most
monumental fucking thing and...

400
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:46,957
I get that, I want you to know
how much I get that,

401
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,125
and if you wanna talk about it, then...

402
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:52,250
Can we turn this off?

403
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,832
What?

404
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:57,208
The music.
Can we turn it off?

405
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:00,708
- It's a classic.
- Okay.

406
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,792
I don't care.
I hate it. I hate guitars.

407
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:07,792
- Since when?
- Since forever.

408
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,333
What? That's insane.
Who hates guitars?

409
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:15,375
You don't hate guitars.

410
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:19,291
Grace. I know what you're thinking,
but that's just an old pack.

411
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,082
It's been there forever.
You've seen them before.

412
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:24,457
- I've seen these before?
- Yes.

413
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:27,291
Look, they're just... they're Greg's.

414
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:31,542
Wow, you and Greg are <i>very, very</i> close.

415
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,000
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

416
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,625
Stop it. Grace,
stop being fucking annoying.

417
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:40,375
I'm coming!

418
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,958
I'm here, baby.

419
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:14,250
He's not breathing.

420
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:16,958
Funny.

421
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:17,125
Fuck it.

422
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,583
Harry?

423
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,125
Up.

424
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:19,125
Grace?

425
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:25,250
You have to shoot the dog.

426
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,249
What?

427
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,417
You have to shoot the fucking dog.

428
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:34,542
He's crying.

429
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:39,707
- Where the fuck did you find that?
- A thing you love is suffering.

430
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,916
- Have you lost your mind?
- You can solve it.

431
00:54:41,917 --> 00:54:45,166
- Are you insane?
- He's in pain.

432
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:47,791
- I'll go to the vets tomorrow.
- They'll put him down.

433
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:52,000
Grace, please!
I'm not gonna kill my dog. Okay?

434
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,583
How's your lip?

435
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,250
I'm sorry.

436
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,833
How do you start your days, Grace?

437
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,957
What do you mean?

438
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:14,042
Well, yoga?

439
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:17,583
Running?
Hot water and lemon?

440
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:20,417
Writing?

441
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
What's happened with your writing?

442
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,542
I can't do it any more.

443
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,833
Why not?

444
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:44,499
- You know who's teaching yoga?
- Who?

445
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,291
That neighbour of yours, Melissa?

446
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:51,082
She does it over the internet. She...

447
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,167
Maybe you could take a class with her?

448
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:57,666
I don't think that's yoga, Pam.

449
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,875
I'm pretty sure it is.

450
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:10,792
Well, it might be a relaxing thing
for a young woman to do.

451
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:21,917
You're still so pretty, Grace.

452
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:26,875
Let me help you, sweetie.

453
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:33,124
Just with the baby, with...
with the house, whatever you need.

454
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:36,832
Just give you more time
to do other things.

455
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:40,791
- Alright.
- You found some.

456
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:42,167
It's the good stuff, Mom.

457
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:47,875
I know this brand.
This is the hot one.

458
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,250
- I'm going for a walk. I won't be long.
- Grace?

459
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,749
- Grace! Can you hear us?
- Grace!

460
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:58,917
Grace!

461
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:08,582
She took your baby
and disappeared for hours.

462
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,417
Had you frantic.

463
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:13,625
And now she's not talking to you?

464
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:19,625
She just needs some time to herself.
You know, I get that.

465
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:25,207
No, Jackson.
She is not well.

466
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,958
Well, sometimes people aren't well, Mom.

467
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:33,082
Sometimes people need some time
to adjust when things change.

468
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:36,416
Sometimes everybody just needs
to have some fucking patience

469
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:38,625
and trust that things will get better.

470
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,667
Are you still sleepwalking?

471
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:47,667
I'm just trying to help.

472
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,875
Well, you are helping, Mom.

473
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:59,542
She just needs some space
to... to write.

474
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:02,875
She says she can't.

475
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:07,416
It's just like, you know...

476
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:10,750
It's just writer's block
or whatever, I guess.

477
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:12,750
No. I don't wanna get in.

478
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:18,416
Okay, there we are.
Good job.

479
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:21,166
- Hi.
- Alright, that's a big girl.

480
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:24,082
- That's a big girl.
- I don't wanna go.

481
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:25,707
It's okay.

482
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:28,791
- Sorry to bother you.
- Huh?

483
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:31,249
I think my car might have
a flat tyre.

484
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:34,457
Would you mind
just taking a look at it?

485
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,624
- Breathe.
- No.

486
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:38,416
Look at Mommy.
Hey, look at Mommy.

487
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:41,333
Babe, we don't have any time for this. No.

488
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:45,749
So, could you...

489
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,207
Okay. Yeah, sorry.

490
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:51,292
Put your leg in the car.

491
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,958
Alright?

492
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:11,208
When was the last time we had sex?

493
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,917
Rough guess.

494
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:19,249
I really couldn't say, Gracie.

495
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,167
Go on, take a stab.

496
01:05:25,542 --> 01:05:27,416
I don't know. Like a month?

497
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:29,333
Try two and a half.

498
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,999
Well, things have been, you know.

499
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,582
And it was four in the morning,
you were essentially asleep.

500
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:36,958
Grace.

501
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,499
And the time before that,

502
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,707
we were watching TV
about that island thing,

503
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:44,374
and I was begging you,
and you put a towel down.

504
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,958
Alright, alright, alright.

505
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,333
It used to be good, right?

506
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:51,249
It's still good, Grace.

507
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,457
It doesn't exist, Jackson.
It's not a thing.

508
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,624
Alright, I'm gonna put more
of an effort in.

509
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,167
Tonight?

510
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,707
- Okay.
- You want me?

511
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,500
Yeah, I want you.

512
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,458
Say it again.

513
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:08,792
I... I want you, yeah.

514
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,916
- Before or after dinner?
- Grace, man.

515
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:17,833
- Just have a fucking opinion.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

516
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:24,542
When we get home?

517
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:26,999
Yeah.

518
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,166
You'll fuck me when we get home?

519
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:30,791
Yeah.

520
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:32,375
In the car?

521
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,666
If you like.

522
01:06:34,667 --> 01:06:37,667
We used to fuck in the car
all the time, remember?

523
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:41,542
I'll unbuckle, I'll come over
to your seat and you'll fuck me?

524
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:43,375
Yes.

525
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:50,958
Yes.

526
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:06,374
Come on.
My mom's right there.

527
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:08,292
Fuck me quickly, then.

528
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,583
I don't...

529
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,542
Grace, come on.
I'm just kinda...

530
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:23,291
You impotent piece of shit.

531
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:25,833
You useless fucking faggot!

532
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:31,166
You're fucking insane.
Fucking insane.

533
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:33,083
Is everything okay?

534
01:09:02,082 --> 01:09:04,456
- Open the door. I need to use it.
- Piss outside.

535
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:06,956
I don't need to piss.

536
01:09:06,957 --> 01:09:09,124
Shit in a bush. I don't care.

537
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,750
Oh, God, Grace!

538
01:09:12,707 --> 01:09:14,207
Grace!

539
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:21,375
I don't wanna shit in a bush.
I want... I wanna shit in the toilet.

540
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,207
Come on, it's coming out.

541
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:31,000
Come on.

542
01:09:32,457 --> 01:09:34,125
It's gonna be
all over the floor.

543
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,542
I'm starting to smell it. Quick.

544
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:44,082
Thank you.

545
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,000
Jesus Christ.

546
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:15,082
No running, please.

547
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,625
- Hi. Hey! Come on in.
- Hey.

548
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:19,166
Greg!

549
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:22,624
Yeah. Greg said we have
enough food to feed a village.

550
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,708
Well, that's what we've got, right?

551
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:29,207
Well, you can add these, I guess.
They fell over in the car.

552
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:30,707
They looked better before.

553
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,291
What happened to your fingers?

554
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,582
I burnt them
trying to bake you a cake.

555
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,957
- Hey, man.
- There you are. Welcome, buddy.

556
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:39,416
- Good to see you.
- You too, man.

557
01:10:39,417 --> 01:10:40,957
- Hi.
- The place looks great.

558
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:43,707
He's such a beautiful baby.

559
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:46,291
- Jack, let's get you a drink.
- Does he want a snack?

560
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:49,457
- Sure. Whatever the kids are having.
- Okay. No allergies?

561
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,625
No. I don't think so.

562
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:55,000
Who's a sweetie-pie?
Here's Jack's boy.

563
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:04,375
Did you guys see this?

564
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,541
So do you think
you'll have another one?

565
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:18,249
Yeah. Pregnant now.

566
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,791
Cookin' up twins.

567
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:22,417
What happened to your hands?

568
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:25,750
You should see the wall.

569
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:30,833
Yeah, I have two kids, and...

570
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:35,332
two is a lot,
if I'm being honest.

571
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,082
Seems like it.

572
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:40,124
Babies, though,
babies are hard.

573
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:41,874
Nobody talks about that enough.

574
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:44,083
It's all anyone talks about.

575
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:45,958
It changes you.

576
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:50,542
I think I nearly lost my mind
for the first six months.

577
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,625
When do you think
you'll be getting it back?

578
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:04,125
You know, postnatal depression is so
much more common than people think.

579
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,417
- What do you do for work, Grace?
- I don't.

580
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,666
I'm stuck between
wanting to do something

581
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:19,124
and not wanting to do...
anything at all.

582
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:23,124
Hang on. Cheryl mentioned
that you're a writer.

583
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:24,666
That's cute. That must be nice.

584
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:26,749
Something you can squeeze
around a baby.

585
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:30,667
- Yeah, I don't do that any more.
- Why not? Stuck for inspiration?

586
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:33,417
I'm sure it'll come back.

587
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:49,541
Grace?

588
01:12:49,542 --> 01:12:51,667
Grace!

589
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,625
Oh, my God!

590
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:04,667
Jackson? Jackson?
Look at me, okay? Hey.

591
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:09,374
- Can you breathe?
- Somebody get some water.

592
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,249
- Jackson?
- Let me call someone.

593
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,916
- What, your chest hurts?
- Yeah.

594
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:16,417
- You can breathe. Breathe with me.
- I think it's them at the door.

595
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,167
Yeah. See?

596
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:26,750
Yeah, you're okay. You're okay.

597
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:33,500
He's okay.

598
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:39,707
It's just kind of a wake-up call,
you know.

599
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:42,042
We need to look out
for each other, Grace.

600
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:48,583
I am getting really stressed.

601
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:51,083
About what?

602
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,833
No one took our pastries.
You see that?

603
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:16,417
Well, there was a ton of food.

604
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:20,875
- It's rude.
- They weren't being rude. Come on.

605
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,667
You know what's rude, Grace?

606
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:27,374
Getting into a pool full of kids
in your fucking underwear.

607
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:29,499
That's what's rude.

608
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,749
You embarrassed me.

609
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,958
You embarrassed <i>us</i>.

610
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,417
Grace. Grace!

611
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:45,333
Goddammit!

612
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,917
Fuck me. Jesus fucking Christ.

613
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:54,917
Don't ever do that again.

614
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:59,375
Alright?

615
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:07,749
<i>When Amelia was a little girl,</i>

616
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,541
<i>she liked to imagine
she could stretch her wings</i>

617
01:15:10,542 --> 01:15:12,999
<i>and fly like a bird.</i>

618
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,499
<i>One day she got to ride
on an airplane</i>

619
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:19,207
<i>and liked it so much
she didn't wanna ever come down.</i>

620
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:21,874
<i>The world looked so small,</i>

621
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:24,957
the houses and cars were like toys.

622
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:28,082
They flew for thousands of miles.

623
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:30,500
Over oceans and jungles.

624
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:35,957
Some people thought they were crazy.

625
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:40,250
But Amelia wasn't afraid
of having a thousand adventures.

626
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:45,332
So she flew on like a bird,
further than anyone had gone before,

627
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:47,874
never to return.

628
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:50,042
What the fuck?

629
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,833
You wanna get married?

630
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:26,875
Yeah. Yeah, fuck, yeah.

631
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:52,125
Oh, my God. Really?

632
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:47,249
Kiss me.

633
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,542
Grace.

634
01:22:50,792 --> 01:22:53,000
Kiss me. Kiss me.

635
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:33,916
I don't know where Jackson is.

636
01:23:33,917 --> 01:23:37,125
Let's go find
that no-count husband of yours.

637
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:42,583
Wow.

638
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:57,916
Hello. This is the bride
in the bridal suite.

639
01:23:57,917 --> 01:24:01,541
I was wondering if I could get
a bucket of ice sent up to my room.

640
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:04,749
<i>We've got an ice machine
on your floor</i>

641
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,542
<i>at the end of the corridor there.</i>

642
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:10,332
What's your name?

643
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:11,417
<i>Charlie.</i>

644
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:16,291
Charlie, would you mind
getting it for me, please?

645
01:24:16,292 --> 01:24:19,207
I'm a little indisposed.

646
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:22,125
<i>We don't bring up ice, ma'am.</i>

647
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:25,875
Okay.

648
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:30,249
Are you still there?

649
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:33,207
<i>Yes, ma'am. Is there anything else
I can help you with?</i>

650
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:39,707
Well, my husband
is at the party downstairs.

651
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,417
Our wedding.

652
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:47,457
And I think it would be really nice

653
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:52,082
if the champagne was cold for him
when we came up.

654
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:53,332
<i>I understand.</i>

655
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:56,083
I'm just trying to be a good wife.

656
01:24:56,583 --> 01:25:01,417
<i>Yes. Sorry,
but I can't help with that.</i>

657
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:06,750
You have a really beautiful voice,
Charlie.

658
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:08,916
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

659
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:11,708
<i>The beast in me</i>

660
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:18,917
<i>Has had to learn to live with pain</i>

661
01:25:22,542 --> 01:25:26,875
<i>And how to shelter from the rain</i>

662
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:35,207
<i>And in the twinkling of an eye</i>

663
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:39,000
<i>Might have to be restrained</i>

664
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:48,083
<i>God help the beast in me</i>

665
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:42,625
<i>Must have been about three.</i>

666
01:28:43,542 --> 01:28:45,708
<i>My parents and I
went down to the beach.</i>

667
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:52,250
<i>They must have been reading,
or maybe they fell asleep.</i>

668
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:59,124
And I had my feet in the water,
and then this girl came up to me.

669
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,749
She must have been about ten,

670
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:06,500
but to me she seemed, you know,
like a... like a grown-up.

671
01:29:09,417 --> 01:29:13,250
And she took my hand
and we walked for a while.

672
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:17,833
She bought me an ice pop.

673
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:24,708
People would say how cute we were.

674
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:27,667
It was really nice.

675
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,874
And then as my parents realised
I was missing,

676
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:38,707
and my mom was crying

677
01:29:38,708 --> 01:29:42,207
and my dad was really angry,

678
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:45,000
and I remember just thinking,

679
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,375
"I wish you weren't mine.

680
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:58,083
"I wish I didn't belong to you."

681
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:03,083
Where are your parents now, Grace?

682
01:30:06,417 --> 01:30:08,417
They died in a plane crash.

683
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,458
- How old were you?
- Ten.

684
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,750
It must have been terribly difficult.

685
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:26,833
<i>Like, perhaps you have
some abandonment issues.</i>

686
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:34,500
<i>Which makes it hard for you
to safely attach to people.</i>

687
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:49,666
Your husband. To your son.

688
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:52,250
I don't have a problem
attaching to my son.

689
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:54,958
He's perfect.

690
01:30:56,792 --> 01:30:59,042
It's everything else that's fucked.

691
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,750
Hi.

692
01:32:18,792 --> 01:32:20,625
Hi, baby.

693
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:23,208
I missed you.

694
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:31,208
What?

695
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,374
You got a rental?

696
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:39,666
No, it's ours.
I got it off Greg.

697
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:41,749
With what money?

698
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:44,583
Don't worry about it.
He's taking care of us.

699
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:49,792
You like it?

700
01:32:50,958 --> 01:32:53,333
Yeah, it's cool. Big.

701
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:09,125
Turn this up.
I love this song.

702
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:14,874
Thought you didn't like guitars.

703
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:16,958
When did I ever say that?
I love guitars.

704
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:28,332
<i>Will you stay in our lovers' story?</i>

705
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:31,291
<i>If you stay, you won't be sorry</i>

706
01:33:31,292 --> 01:33:34,250
<i>'Cause we believe in you</i>

707
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,999
<i>Soon you'll grow, so take a chance</i>

708
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,458
<i>With a couple of kooks
hung up on romancing</i>

709
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:47,542
<i>Will you stay in our lovers' story?</i>

710
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:51,249
<i>If you stay, you won't be sorry</i>

711
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,042
<i>'Cause we believe in you</i>

712
01:33:55,042 --> 01:33:57,875
<i>Soon you'll grow, so take a chance</i>

713
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:09,333
Doing alright there, bud?
Come on, now.

714
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:19,666
He's so cute.

715
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:21,333
I love his little hat.

716
01:34:22,417 --> 01:34:24,292
He's not really a fan.
Are you, buddy?

717
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:28,167
I babysit a kid just like him.
Yours is cuter, though.

718
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:31,541
- Has he been in the water yet?
- No, not yet.

719
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:34,666
We could take him to the edge.
Do you think he'll go with us?

720
01:34:34,667 --> 01:34:37,707
Yeah. You're very social, aren't you?

721
01:34:37,708 --> 01:34:39,667
We can make him a castle if he wants.

722
01:34:40,667 --> 01:34:42,667
If we go just there,
we'll be in sight.

723
01:34:43,833 --> 01:34:45,333
Wanna go with 'em, buddy?

724
01:34:46,792 --> 01:34:49,541
Play with me? What's his name?

725
01:34:49,542 --> 01:34:51,958
- Harry.
- Come on, Harry.

726
01:36:47,125 --> 01:36:48,292
What is that?

727
01:37:00,417 --> 01:37:02,042
<i>Yeah, fuck, yeah.</i>

728
01:37:25,125 --> 01:37:26,542
<i>Stop it!</i>

729
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:56,042
<i>You kept saying sorry
when you were sleeping.</i>

730
01:37:57,667 --> 01:38:00,125
<i>When I came in, you were saying it.</i>

731
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:04,208
<i>What are you sorry about?</i>

732
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,707
<i>I don't remember.</i>

733
01:38:07,708 --> 01:38:11,375
<i>Do you think you need
to apologise for anything?</i>

734
01:38:13,917 --> 01:38:15,333
<i>No.</i>

735
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:20,374
<i>Do I have to get up?</i>

736
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:23,875
<i>No, Grace.
You don't need to do anything.</i>

737
01:38:24,708 --> 01:38:26,375
<i>I can just stay in bed?</i>

738
01:38:27,458 --> 01:38:29,458
If that's what you want.

739
01:38:34,167 --> 01:38:35,583
It's you.

740
01:38:38,583 --> 01:38:40,000
How are you?

741
01:38:49,417 --> 01:38:51,333
Everyone misses you.

742
01:39:33,458 --> 01:39:34,875
Coming in, babe?

743
01:39:41,417 --> 01:39:42,417
Yeah.

744
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:34,583
Fixed it up a little bit.

745
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,875
Looks nice.

746
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:38,792
Yeah.

747
01:41:53,667 --> 01:41:55,667
You're so beautiful, Grace.

748
01:42:57,667 --> 01:43:00,207
<i>Oh, Grace. You look so well.</i>

749
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:04,041
- It's so great that you're home.
- You look so healthy.

750
01:43:04,042 --> 01:43:05,542
Thanks.

751
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:10,542
Sometimes all we need
is just a little breath, right?

752
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:14,874
You know what? You and Jackson
are really lucky to have each other.

753
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:16,375
Yeah.

754
01:43:43,833 --> 01:43:46,332
- Grace, it is so good to see you.
- You too.

755
01:43:46,333 --> 01:43:49,207
- You look so well.
- Thank you.

756
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:52,458
No, but, really, like,
you just look so much better.

757
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:57,874
You too.
You look a lot better.

758
01:43:57,875 --> 01:43:59,749
- All good here?
- Yeah, doing great.

759
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:01,916
We're both doing a lot better
than we were.

760
01:44:01,917 --> 01:44:04,624
- You having a good time?
- The best.

761
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:07,624
- That's good.
- And I'm just so grateful to you.

762
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:12,124
For taking care of everything.
And painting the house.

763
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:14,541
- Taking care of the baby.
- That's sweet.

764
01:44:14,542 --> 01:44:18,166
Having me fucking committed.
You're just the best.

765
01:44:18,167 --> 01:44:20,207
- Okay, Grace, come on.
- But I mean it.

766
01:44:20,208 --> 01:44:22,249
- Please. Don't do this.
- Thank you.

767
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:23,832
Don't do what?

768
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:26,582
I shot a dog! It was in pain.

769
01:44:26,583 --> 01:44:29,082
We came to be and we ran amok!

770
01:44:29,083 --> 01:44:31,750
May we live long and die out.

771
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:39,917
Yes. May we live long and die out.

772
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:49,791
Grace.

773
01:44:49,792 --> 01:44:51,083
Pam.

774
01:45:08,333 --> 01:45:09,583
Grace.

775
01:45:10,167 --> 01:45:12,542
Leave her be, Jackson.

776
01:45:21,583 --> 01:45:23,000
Grace!

777
01:45:27,208 --> 01:45:28,833
<i>Where are you, Grace?</i>

778
01:45:32,667 --> 01:45:33,667
<i>I'm right here.</i>

779
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:36,000
You just can't see me.

780
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:42,333
I can't go back.

781
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:05,667
I love you.

782
01:46:06,708 --> 01:46:07,749
I love you.

783
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:10,333
<i>Perfect driving tune right here
from John Prine.</i>

784
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:21,875
I can try harder.

785
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,916
<i>She don't like her eggs all runny</i>

786
01:46:33,917 --> 01:46:36,707
<i>She thinks crossin' her legs is funny</i>

787
01:46:36,708 --> 01:46:39,999
<i>She looks down her nose at money</i>

788
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,041
<i>She gets it on like the Easter Bunny</i>

789
01:46:43,042 --> 01:46:46,166
<i>She's my baby, I'm her honey</i>

790
01:46:46,167 --> 01:46:48,417
<i>I'm never gonna let her go</i>

791
01:46:50,875 --> 01:46:53,999
<i>He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays</i>

792
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,124
<i>Caught him once
And he was sniffin' my undies</i>

793
01:46:57,125 --> 01:47:00,541
<i>He ain't too sharp
But he gets things done</i>

794
01:47:00,542 --> 01:47:03,666
<i>Drinks his beer like it's oxygen</i>

795
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:06,874
<i>He's my baby, I'm his honey</i>

796
01:47:06,875 --> 01:47:09,417
<i>Never gonna let him go</i>

797
01:47:10,833 --> 01:47:12,916
<i>In spite of ourselves</i>

798
01:47:12,917 --> 01:47:16,458
<i>We'll end up sittin' on a rainbow</i>

799
01:47:17,292 --> 01:47:19,416
<i>Against all odds</i>

800
01:47:19,417 --> 01:47:22,542
<i>Honey, we're the big door prize</i>

801
01:47:23,583 --> 01:47:29,167
<i>We're gonna spite our noses
Right off of our faces</i>

802
01:47:29,792 --> 01:47:34,792
<i>There won't be nothin'
But big old hearts dancin' in our eyes</i>

803
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:28,708
Enough.

804
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,625
Grace!
