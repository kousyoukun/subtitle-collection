3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:19,890
Mother was sick for a long time.

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:29,230
I think she got sick right after Father passed away at his work site.

5
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,210
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,860
When I was about five or six years old...

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:45,060
Mother was always laying in bed.

8
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,260
Episode 13

9
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,520
It was after school, I was the only one left.

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,900
I said to myself, "I know I shouldn't be doing this."

11
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:11,800
I have to feed my sister and take care of my mother.

12
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,660
But those were only thoughts, I really didn't want to go home.

13
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:31,210
So that day, I wandered around.
I had nowhere to go and when I got home...

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,010
I came home and found my Mother in pain.

15
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,080
Young-Suk, hurry up!
Call the hospital to send an ambulance here!

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,490
Why are you just standing there?

17
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,280
I ran as fast as I could.

18
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,480
I called the hospital for an ambulance.

19
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,580
This is Lee Sang Hospital...

20
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,280
Hello?

21
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,630
Please talk...

22
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,880
This is Lee Sang Hospital...

23
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,660
Hello?

24
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,090
Hello?

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,640
Please talk. ..

26
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,000
Hello?

27
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,420
Hello?

28
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,300
Please talk...

29
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,170
This is Lee Sang Hospital...

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,500
Hello?

31
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,900
But I didn't call the hospital.

32
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,220
At that time, I don't know how far I walked.

33
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:34,810
That was...the last time I saw my mother.

34
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,740
Grandmother...

35
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,330
Though this may sound weird...

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,420
I still don't regret what I did.

37
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,160
I didn't want to do it.

38
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,910
If I called the hospital, the doctor would probably save my Mother.

39
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,380
Like they always did before.

40
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:11,350
And I would have to steal my friend's money and things at the market again.

41
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,140
I didn't want to do that again.

42
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,460
I really couldn't take it any longer.

43
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,690
If they wanted to punish me, they couldn't do that.

44
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,330
I was only fourteen years old.

45
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,320
At that time, I was only fourteen years old.

46
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:43,320
I feel so sorry to my Mother.

47
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,950
Today, Min-hee is going to take a scan and then have the surgery right away.

48
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,060
Did you get the money?

49
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,450
You have to wake up early for work tomorrow.

50
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,020
Go home...

51
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,160
You said that Min-ho's father trusts you more than Min-ho.

52
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,790
You should ask him.

53
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,220
He will help the surgery fee, wouldn't he?

54
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,410
If it doesn't work out, you could quit work and...

55
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:21,310
Right now our problem doesn't end with the surgery fee.

56
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:39,800
Sang-Yun, just because no one trusts me, I want to believe that no one is on my side.

57
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:49,710
Right now, that thought, it comforts me.

58
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,860
Let's go.

59
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,480
I didn't know Min-hee was in that much pain.

60
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,530
But you were still supposed to be there.

61
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:26,390
Although you want me to say these words, that's not right.

62
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:34,040
You want me to go back to you. Is that right?

63
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,600
I can't do that, Ji-ahn.

64
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:44,650
Do you think I can't understand you?

65
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,110
I understand you completely.

66
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:57,440
But...even if I understand, I can't come back to you.

67
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,560
Sorry, Ji-ahn.

68
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,960
Wow, our Soo-hee picked the right man.

69
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,260
He's good-looking, his family background is good, his personality looks fine too.

70
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,000
You really match well with our Soo-hee.

71
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,560
Thank you.

72
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,270
I should be thankful.

73
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,580
Ever since our Soo-hee got so tall, it isn't easy for her to find men.

74
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,110
Gi-ji-bae, she has good eyes.
(Gi-ji-bae: Slightly rude way of saying daughter)

75
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,240
But, Soo-hee didn't give you the house keys?

76
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,870
Why were you sitting outside?

77
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,760
Just...

78
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,110
Right now, we aren't that far in our relationship.

79
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,680
Seeing you make tea,  you fit well in this house.

80
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,120
You haven't been coming around a lot?

81
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,450
It's okay.

82
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,030
I'm much more nicer than I look.

83
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,390
You came?

84
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,960
When I came to meet you, your boyfriend was outside.

85
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,370
I can meet you, and know your boyfriend, this is great!

86
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,310
I really hate this.

87
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,490
How many times do I have to tell you, mom?

88
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,040
I told you not to come inside when I'm not home.

89
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,640
Why do you always do what you want?

90
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,650
Gi-ji-bae...

91
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,100
Why were you so mad?

92
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,560
Everytime I see my mom, I always get mad.

93
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,070
Don't worry about it.

94
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,690
Seeing you like that, I was embarrassed to see your mother.

95
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:26,760
Did your meeting with Ji-ahn go well?

96
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,930
Yeah.

97
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:37,140
That...is it?

98
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:45,460
"Yeah" is all your going to say?

99
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,290
Would you leave me alone?

100
00:10:53,530 --> 00:11:06,390
You still hurt when something happens to your one time high school crush Min-hee.

101
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:14,040
So, you can understand my pain.

102
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,290
How do I understand?

103
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:27,540
You didn't just meet Ji-ahn, you loved him to death...

104
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,450
You broke up twice then got back together again.

105
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,400
You guys have already been together.

106
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,330
Ah. It must be very hard for you.

107
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:43,100
So, I have to shut up until you get everything settled.

108
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,890
That's how I understand?

109
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,370
Right now, we can't talk with each other.

110
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,770
Just go.

111
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,940
Am I...

112
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,760
Just something that happened?

113
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,000
Tell me.

114
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:24,870
Am I...just someone inbetween you and Ji-ahn?

115
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:32,600
Since long ago, you two have always broke up and got together again.

116
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,050
Did I intrude in your relationship?

117
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,690
So, do you feel uncomfortable?

118
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,360
Tell me what you really want.

119
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:58,850
If you don't tell me, I'm going to misunderstand.

120
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,660
<i>I'm leaving you...</i>

121
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,950
<i>I'm forgetting you...</i>

122
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,720
<i>Because you were drunk...</i>

123
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,670
<i>You forgot me...</i>

124
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,810
<i>How could you...</i>

125
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,090
<i>What right do I have...</i>

126
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,610
<i>To love you...</i>

127
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,570
<i>Now, I can only cry...</i>

128
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:45,880
<i>I am nothing to you...</i>

129
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,530
<i>My heart hurts...</i>

130
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,740
<i>I'm supposed to leave you...</i>

131
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,740
<i>If I leave you...</i>

132
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:09,850
<i>You're truly going to abandon me...</i>

133
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,260
He won't give me money.

134
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,070
If he was poor, I wouldn't say anything about it.

135
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,340
He puts all his money so secretly and securely in the bank.

136
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,240
One month living is 500,000 won,
and saying that he loves me until death.

137
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:40,590
Looking closely, I found out that he saved all the money for himself.

138
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,710
So, you're not with him anymore?

139
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,690
Min-shi wants to live with me again.

140
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,850
You know Min-shi, don't you?

141
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,040
During high school, the person you lived with for two months in the apartment.

142
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,420
Aigoo, you said when I left him, that he was a good man.

143
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,800
And I should never break up with him.

144
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,420
You hated him because you couldn't talk to him.

145
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,920
That time, I didn't have control of my life.

146
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,030
Soo-hee...

147
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,830
Yesterday, I read in the newspaper...

148
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,120
People that already broke up and meet again have a smaller chance of breaking up again.

149
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,740
That man, living my life that way...

150
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,240
I thought that there should be no better man for me.

151
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,760
Stop it.

152
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,020
Do you want to eat this?

153
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,600
It's delicious.

154
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:10,180
You don't want sympathy?
Yet you keep looking for it.

155
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,110
Do you think I can't understand you?

156
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,770
I understand you completely.

157
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,430
Even if you tell me I don't understand, I do.

158
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:33,020
But...even if I understand, I can't come back to you.

159
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,930
Sorry, Ji-ahn.

160
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,560
Having you was such a good fortune for me.

161
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:00,520
Without you, my bad life would have been worse off.

162
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,850
Aigoo, Yoo-gae-jang.
(Yoo-gae-jang: Person of high status)

163
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,990
Prepare the money.

164
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,810
Go tend to your own business.

165
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,910
When the taxi comes, I will go.

166
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,930
I want to send you off.

167
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,660
Soo-hee...

168
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,490
Mom will really try hard to live well this time.

169
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,790
From now on, I won't break your heart.

170
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,440
You don't believe me, do you?

171
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,250
I'm leaving...

172
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,440
Mom...

173
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,580
In case you live with Min-shi and hate it...

174
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,520
This time that won't happen!

175
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,470
Just in case...

176
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,920
You can break up again.

177
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,210
Don't live your life with my standards.

178
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,760
It's your life, mom.

179
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,150
Okay, gi-ji-bae.

180
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,980
Your test results should come out soon and you should walk a lot.

181
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,050
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,760
Let's eat rice later.

183
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,230
Grandmother, sit for a moment.

184
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:15,990
It must have been hard for you to tell me,
but thanks for telling me yesterday.

185
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:22,730
For telling me that I did the best that I can do for  my mother.

186
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,920
I won't forget it.

187
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:33,690
I had always wanted to hear that from someone.

188
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,350
I'm not a bad girl...

189
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:44,320
I was still fourteen years old, there was nothing else I could do.

190
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,710
Grandma who looks like my mom said that to me and it makes me happy.

191
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,580
But, I still feel sorry to my mother.

192
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:03,540
I thought no one could understand me, but I guess not?

193
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,830
<i>I have a daughter like Young-Suk.</i>

194
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,690
You have a daughter...Grandma?

195
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,460
You only know up to there?

196
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,640
Let's put it all in.

197
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,030
He didn't give you the money?

198
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:31,580
Really, we don't have much time left too.

199
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,430
I don't think we can bring in your husband.

200
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,600
What are we going to do?

201
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:57,680
When I saw the girl biting her fingers, she looked at me and laughed.

202
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,750
I felt strangely calm.

203
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,470
Is that girl going to appear again?

204
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,950
Is there any chance this will happen again?

205
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,220
Probably...

206
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,410
Or maybe not.

207
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,230
It's not that common.

208
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,990
But, why would she start appearing?

209
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,440
You'll find out.

210
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,100
Are you really a doctor?

211
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,490
Oh, yeah.

212
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,390
Did the children say they will be coming or not?

213
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,450
They called saying that they will be coming.

214
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,760
But, I told them not to come.

215
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,420
I don't want to be a whiny mother.

216
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,870
As I was talking to Grandmother,

217
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,490
I understood that I could understand others too.

218
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,830
So, then I got a courage.

219
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,870
The children will later understand my pain and forgive me.

220
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,020
So, right now, I don't need to force them to understand me.

221
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,580
I said to them with coolness...

222
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,830
"Come when it's fine with you!"

223
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,080
You're cool!

224
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,420
You didn't know that?

225
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:20,750
But do you know that the whining Oh Young-Suk is cool too?

226
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,270
Are you hitting on me?

227
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,270
If the children said they will be coming, let them.
You want to see them, don't you?

228
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,270
You're always putting in the last word, goodness!

229
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,940
Now, promise not to lie and hide yourself.

230
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,610
Congratulations, your discharged from the hospital!

231
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:50,940
But, Kim Min-jae, how long are you going to stay by Min-hwa's side?

232
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,520
Is my punch too hard for you?

233
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,400
It's not fun for me, I just get one punch a day!

234
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,880
Take it as my goodbye present!

235
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,380
Ah! I'll wash it by myself!

236
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,610
It's all done!

237
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,330
Wait a moment.

238
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,130
Hey!  I have hands too!

239
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,590
I know too. Blow your nose!

240
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,860
Hurry up!

241
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,360
So cute!

242
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,260
Now...I'm doing your hair...

243
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:41,020
Ah, how dirty!
Putting your saliva on my hair.

244
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,790
You're so dirty, aigoo!

245
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,930
Aigoo, it's so hard!

246
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,110
Piggyback me to my bed.

247
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,160
Put me to sleep for only ten minutes.

248
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,260
Aigoo, what kind of girl acts like this?

249
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,760
Taking away a busy man from his work, saying you'll do this and that, wasting my time.

250
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,810
Always playing with me, gosh!

251
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,870
Really, why are you like that?

252
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,580
You're going to be come like a king!

253
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,160
Get on my back!

254
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,880
You know only eat, it must be a good life.

255
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,970
You said that you would sleep, but why are you just opening and closing your eyes?

256
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:35,970
Mister, why would you be sad when it should be the happiest moment? I'm thinking about that.

257
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:46,540
Today I fed you, washed your hair, face, and teeth, put makeup on you and made you happy.

258
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,970
You don't want to be happy?

259
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,340
I have to go out, but you won't let me out.

260
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,550
Not only today, but you always do.

261
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,580
No, when did I ever do that?

262
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,200
Mister, you think that you can't be happy, right?

263
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:20,440
You couldn't save your mother from your father...

264
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:27,400
And you're the bad man that caused Ji-Soo's accident, right?

265
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,980
Would you look at me?

266
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:48,610
Mister's mom and dad were just down on luck, it's not your fault.

267
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:54,810
And Ji-soo's luck is like that.
I feel sorry for her.

268
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:01,060
Just do what she wants.

269
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,530
What does Ji-soo want?

270
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,510
She wants you to live a fun life with me.

271
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,600
Mister, now you can be happy.

272
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:24,470
You've been sad and hurt long enough.

273
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,520
You like me, don't you?

274
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:44,550
You wonder how such a blessing came from the sky when you haven't done anything good.

275
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:52,000
Although others don't know, I do.

276
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,910
Mister, you're nice.

277
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:01,540
Mister, you will be a nice husband to me.

278
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:10,830
I...didn't do anything for you.

279
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:16,800
You gave me love, stupid!

280
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,830
Now, go to Ji-soo...

281
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,840
You said that Ji-soo is going to Jeju-do today.

282
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,170
Really, this man, why are you like this?

283
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,450
All you have to do is send her off!

284
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,310
Why are you acting like it's a big job?

285
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,820
How did you know?

286
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:46,320
It's pretty obvious?
What else would you do?

287
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,390
I'm smart, am I not?

288
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,850
Your laughter hides something, what is the meaning of this?

289
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:05,150
So, now...you should be good to me!

290
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,300
Sassy girl...

291
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,940
What do you think of this house?

292
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,060
Do you think your mother will like it?

293
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,280
The view is quite good, huh?

294
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:34,950
If Min-ho's mom sits here, she won't get bored, so I bought this place.

295
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,600
Father...

296
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,890
I quit my job.

297
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,190
<i>Park Yoo Chul
Kyung Gi Do Province
031-370-99</i>

298
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,880
Mom, go there by yourself.

299
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,450
I want you to go with me.

300
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:21,680
Until today, in my life...I never forgot your father.

301
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:31,240
If you talk to me like that, I think that you are such a strong person.

302
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,430
You think I'm going to say that?

303
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,330
Min-ho...

304
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:44,660
Although people say that forever is good...

305
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:55,230
Mom, I...

306
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:02,350
My feelings toward you can't change,
because you won't change, mom.

307
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,340
Because you only love that man.

308
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,600
Father, myself, and hyung...

309
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,510
What about us?

310
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,210
Ok...

311
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:19,390
You can love that person to death, I understand that.

312
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,860
You even gave birth to a child, you can't forget him easily.

313
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:32,970
But mom, because you couldn't love him...
You can't love at all?

314
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,750
I'm telling you with assurance...

315
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:46,130
I don't want to be like you.

316
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,530
If you love someone and that person left...

317
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,570
I want to say, "Oh she left me."

318
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,570
I just want to leave the past people behind.

319
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:02,680
I don't want to continue pretending when things have already ended.

320
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:08,390
I don't want to live like that.

321
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:21,840
Everlasting love is a burden around people's necks.

322
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:40,880
Living through pain, you still loved that person to death...

323
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:50,040
For sure, that memory can not always last, but why can't we accept that?

324
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,710
Where are you going?

325
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,730
I'm going to work.
Rest here then go home.

326
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,990
Ji-soo...

327
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,990
You know that oppa will...

328
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,890
If you come to Jeju-do, look for me.

329
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,780
I don't have any words to say to you.

330
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,330
Good thing we met before I left.

331
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,480
You can go now.

332
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,170
Okay.

333
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,380
I will go meet Teacher Kim.

334
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:26,000
I'll go.

335
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,860
Take care of yourself.

336
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,910
Oppa!

337
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,780
I love you a lot!

338
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,560
I thought saying this would make me more comfortable.

339
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:59,770
It's not my thoughts, but I just wanted to say that I love you.

340
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,130
You have to know that you are a happy person.

341
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:08,330
Other people have a hard time finding a person that loves them.

342
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:12,020
You're happy, right?

343
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,390
Yeah.

344
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,860
<i>Take care of yourself
From: Mi-ri</i>

345
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:58,110
What are you looking at that makes you laugh?

346
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,310
I left a message for Ji-soo, and she said to live well with Ho-chul.

347
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:08,340
So, you're in and Ji-soo is out?

348
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,280
What are you doing?

349
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,830
Are you feeling sad that you sent Ji-soo away?

350
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,660
What? Sorrow?

351
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,100
I miss you. Come.

352
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,080
Okay. I can't stop missing you too.
I'm going to see you.

353
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,710
Dukbooki again? Ok, I'll buy it.
(Dukbooki: A Korean dish with red pepper sauce)

354
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,570
Why you haven't left?

355
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,750
I didn't want to go.

356
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,790
I'm sorry about yesterday.

357
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,830
I made you feel uneasy, please understand me.

358
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,350
I was wrong.

359
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,290
Soo-hee...

360
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,240
Do you know what words I hate the most?

361
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,930
Fated love.

362
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,480
People say that a lot.

363
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:54,760
Although I don't like that person, it's just fate.

364
00:38:54,790 --> 00:39:03,790
So, I have to meet that person through destiny.

365
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:20,360
I don't know if Ji-ahn or I is your fate, but Jung Soo-hee, don't believe in fate.

366
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,740
Just meet someone that you like.

367
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:29,010
At this moment, the person you like...

368
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,350
If it's not me, but Ji-ahn.

369
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:47,520
It might hurt...

370
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,670
But I will be okay.

371
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:09,350
The person I love is you.

372
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,880
I hate the fate.

373
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,870
But Min-ho...

374
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,990
I understand Ji-ahn.

375
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,030
His heart hurts...

376
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,740
He has secrets...

377
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,560
I'm not comfortable with my relationship with him too.

378
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:46,300
But Soo-hee, let's end it there.

379
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:51,430
Even though you understand, you can't do anything.

380
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,690
You just listen to the bad things about Ji-ahn, but don't do anything.

381
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:01,230
And I am an illegitimate child and stole my friend's girlfriend.

382
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,240
I don't want to hear that.

383
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:09,020
Let's stop those sayings now.

384
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:20,490
And, Soo-hee...

385
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:26,780
Let's go someplace.

386
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:35,680
The place where I told you about, in the Nam Cho Mountains.

387
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:41,440
I've always thought about going there with you.

388
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,500
I think this is the best time.

389
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,580
Ok, let's go.

390
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,250
Let's go there together.

391
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,730
I mean it.
I think it's a good idea.

392
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:21,570
If you're just keeping your promise to me, you don't have to.

393
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:27,540
It's not that, let's just go there.

394
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:35,740
I think that you don't trust me, so it hurts me.

395
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:49,080
If that was a long time ago, I can still do it...

396
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,790
Because I like you.

397
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,830
I love you a lot.

398
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,880
There are a lot of poor children.

399
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,940
They are really cute.

400
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,490
So, you're starting to draw them.

401
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:40,250
While you're drawing them, I'll start looking at you.

402
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,250
Please stay still.

403
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:18,000
When the days are hot, we'll go to swim.

404
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,540
I don't know how to swim.

405
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,200
I'll teach you!

406
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,550
No, shame on me!

407
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,890
<i>For me...Goodbye!</i>

408
00:44:36,836 --> 00:44:40,456
<i>Your face right now...</i>

409
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:43,635
<i>I don't feel anything...</i>

410
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:47,868
<i>As time passes by...</i>

411
00:44:48,463 --> 00:44:50,800
<i>Everything is going to be alright...</i>

412
00:44:51,001 --> 00:44:54,761
<i>To where my heart leads...</i>

413
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,774
<i>I can just forget...</i>

414
00:44:58,261 --> 00:45:02,386
<i>Walk towards my road...</i>

415
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:12,097
<i>Anyways, life doesn't tell you anything...</i>

416
00:45:12,098 --> 00:45:15,199
<i>Although you may be scared...</i>

417
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:22,187
<i>You don't have a reason to run off first...</i>

418
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:33,410
- Let's go cruising.
- Sure.

419
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:35,120
Why didn't you put money in the bank?

420
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:43,550
<i>Eat up.</i>

421
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,480
I don't feel like eating right now.

422
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,320
I told you specifically why I needed the money.

423
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,780
This is it?

424
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,070
Go away!

425
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,330
You're Mi-ja. Right?

426
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:52,510
Don't you remember me?
I lived next door to you.

427
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:59,180
My husband is going to stay in prison for ten years and this is all I got?

428
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,970
Mi-ja, she doesn't have any money.

429
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,990
She gives her money to everyone else poorer than her, what money would she have left?

430
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:11,640
And, when your mom burned down the house, those words your father said were...

431
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:17,290
I've waited for thirty years for something in return.

432
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:20,780
Do you know how hard it was?

433
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,860
And this is all I'm worth?

434
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,770
And you didn't even say sorry!

435
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:34,920
Hey, why do you think she stopped speaking?

436
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,110
Even if you had ten mouths, you have nothing to say.

437
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,420
My mom left me, and shutting up is the end of that?

438
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,220
Aigoo, I'm getting mad.

439
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,750
Give me your leg!

440
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,560
Show it to her.

441
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:54,650
Your father hit her like this, so how could she run away?

442
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,680
Show her your back!

443
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:04,280
Look at what your father did to her.

444
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,410
Why do you keep avoiding this?

445
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,600
You kept this for a secret too long now.

446
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,770
Grandmother!

447
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,610
Mi-ja, I told you to talk with me!

448
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,760
Where are you going?

449
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,380
<i>Resignation letter</i>

450
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,080
Do you have to do this?

451
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,820
Is there anything I can do...

452
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:51,570
My parents are immigrating, and I want to go too.

453
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,550
I am leaving the day after tomorrow.

454
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:01,090
You don't trust people, right?

455
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:07,130
People haven't given you trust.

456
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:22,820
Or is it, people have given you trust, but you don't accept it?

457
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,960
I always lead life without trust.

458
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:35,100
As you get older, you want to have friends.

459
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:40,120
I wanted you to be my friend.

460
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:44,640
No, that's not it.

461
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,910
I can still be friends with you.

462
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:56,130
Go now.

463
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,690
Bad boy.

464
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,500
I'm going to meet Ji-ahn right now.

465
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,300
He says he's bringing the files now.

466
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:34,340
They say not to say a word and just bring the file.

467
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:30,860
I got the file.

468
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,790
Thanks.

469
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:42,870
Min-ho, in life, if there was one person to understand me, I would be happy.

470
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,950
I will be that person to you.

471
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:54,070
I really loved you a lot.

472
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:59,170
You weren't my smart worker...

473
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,980
You weren't a rich boy...

474
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:08,110
...just Yoo Ji-ahn.

475
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:13,600
I lived my life without friends.

476
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:21,370
When you get older, you want to have friends.

477
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:25,230
I wanted you to be my friend.

478
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,530
Take a day off today.

479
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:04,090
You let go of the boy who was like a son to you, just like that.

480
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:09,830
In your room, there is a key.

481
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:14,130
I bought you an apartment.

482
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:29,400
Whether you live alone or with someone, I thought you will need a place to stay.

483
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,920
Are you going to Park Yoo-chul?

484
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,660
I saw your bags.

485
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,510
I am going to him.

486
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:49,640
The forms, I left it in your room.

487
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,130
I'm leaving.

488
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:56,710
Wife...

489
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:07,030
In case, you can't live with Park Yoo-chul.

490
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:23,950
Although it may not even happen, but just in case, would you come to me?

491
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,870
You're not going?

492
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:53,110
Your mom should be waiting for you.

493
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:59,100
Even though you don't want to go, he is your father.

494
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,840
You just have to see his face.

495
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:30,350
Although I never told anyone, I still remember my father.

496
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,750
So clearly...

497
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:49,280
- Who is that?
- Min-ho...

498
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:53,450
- What kind of Min-ho?
- Pretty Min-ho.

499
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:57,480
Don't forget it. You're pretty.

500
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,480
Don't forget that.

501
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,790
Yeah...I won't forget it.

502
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:17,240
Soo-hee...

503
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:30,630
I can live only with just that memory.

504
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:47,810
Grandma I saw those scars that are very deep.

505
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,140
It doesn't hurt now?

506
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,480
<i>It's a past event.</i>

507
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:55,440
I heard your power not that much.

508
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:56,760
Only good at hitting Ho-chul.

509
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,230
Get up, you bastard!

510
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,550
They want us join hands with them and betray you.

511
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,080
Not you...?!

512
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,720
Get off!
Even if you die, I never saw you!

513
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:15,120
Don't even act like you know my situation.

514
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,760
Hey! Yoo Ji-ahn!

515
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,040
It was hard for me too!

516
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,690
But, I came here for you!

517
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,630
Because I was your friend before.

518
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,940
Now...you're not...

519
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,930
