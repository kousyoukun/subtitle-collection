1
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:29,179
Why are you laughing?

2
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:31,517
- I'm not laughing, just...
- No.

3
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:32,817
- But last time I thought...
- No.

4
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,987
You told me it would cost $200.

5
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:40,589
I'll give you a thousand to
take me there on October 20th.

6
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,635
But last time I was talking shit
because I thought you were talking shit.

7
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:45,795
I'm sorry, sir. I
apologize for my language.

8
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:48,170
Sorry about that. I really
never checked out the price.

9
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:49,936
I even forgot...

10
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,806
Yo, what up, player?

11
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:54,176
Yeah, I'm just chillin' here, man.

12
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:55,680
North Side in an hour.

13
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:57,614
I got you.

14
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:00,017
Yo, big dawg, let me
call you back, all right?

15
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:02,453
I'll call you right back. Peace.

16
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:05,457
So you're serious?

17
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,787
It's my birthday today, man.

18
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:12,199
- What?
- It's got to be my birthday.

19
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:13,895
A thousand dollars?
That's a lot of money.

20
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:17,166
I don't give a shit if it's your
birthday. Can you do it or not?

21
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,070
You said Blowing Rock, right?

22
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:20,808
You want me to take you
two hours from here...

23
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:22,503
...on top of some mountain where
you're not meeting nobody...

24
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:23,874
...and you don't want to come back.

25
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:25,879
- That's what you said, right?
- I told you all this before.

26
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:28,940
I don't want to repeat myself to you
and every cabbie in Winston-Salem.

27
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:30,713
Yeah, but, big dawg,
this is kind of strange.

28
00:01:30,787 --> 00:01:32,880
You got to give me that, right?

29
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:33,955
You know?

30
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:35,149
You want to talk about something?

31
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:36,919
Forget it. I'll call
and get another driver.

32
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:38,324
- No, big dawg, no...
- Forget it.

33
00:01:38,394 --> 00:01:40,098
I'm your driver. Come
on. I'm your driver, man.

34
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:41,756
Don't call the other
drivers. They're not good.

35
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:43,561
I'll telling you, they're
not good. Don't call them.

36
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:45,625
You know? Just that...

37
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:47,260
What are you going to do there, anyway?

38
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:48,804
Are you going to go camping?

39
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:52,832
Are you going there to chill
with the trees and the birds?

40
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:54,344
You like birds, big dawg?

41
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:57,812
Are you going to fly away?

42
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,717
You're not going to jump, right?

43
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,657
You're not going to do that.

44
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,253
Tomorrow's going to be
a better day, you know?

45
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:15,596
- You're just going to the movie now...
- How about a hundred-dollar deposit?

46
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:20,368
The rest also in cash on
October 20th when you pick me up.

47
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,975
That's fine. That's cool.

48
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:26,872
Yo, big dawg!

49
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,572
Yo, William!

50
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,850
That's my cell phone, all
right? Call me on this one.

51
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:35,284
Don't call the dispatch anymore.
It's for my preferred client, okay?

52
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:37,015
Have a good night.

53
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:05,509
64-64. Dropped at Marketplace Cinemas.

54
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:10,024
All right. Call me on Bobworth,
off of South Main Street.

55
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,558
All right. 6-4 out.

56
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:31,867
What's up, Ken?

57
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,877
You want a cab?

58
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:41,151
- All right. Thank you, ma'am.
- Morning, Pork Chop.

59
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:43,690
- Good morning, Solo.
- How are you doing?

60
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,123
- Fine. And you?
- I'm chillin'.

61
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,752
Listen. Remember the trip
you gave me yesterday...

62
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:49,423
...from the Crystal Towers
Apartment to the movie?

63
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,626
If this guy calls again, please
give me that trip, all right?

64
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,294
How am I supposed to know who's calling?

65
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,998
His name is William. You know, just ask.

66
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,099
I can't do it, and you know I can't.

67
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,610
- Come on, Cab 1.
- Come on, Pork Chop.

68
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:03,475
You know I'm not supposed
to give out trips like that.

69
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:05,344
A beautiful girl like you,
you can do whatever you want.

70
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:07,315
You're rocking this place, you know?

71
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:09,875
Cab 1, give 1641 B.

72
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:10,953
He's just a friend.

73
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:13,149
- You know what I'm saying?
- 1641 B, Lincoln.

74
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,954
Listen, when are we going to
have our steak at O'Charley's?

75
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,257
- Steak at O'Charley's?
- And a Tom Collins.

76
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,797
- Tom Collins?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,699
Yo, Mamadou, thank you.

78
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:33,074
All right.

79
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:34,772
So you need a ride for the next trip?

80
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:36,405
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- All right.

81
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:56,402
Morning.

82
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,495
Solo, don't get in our bed
until you take a shower.

83
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:00,506
And your breakfast is in the fridge.

84
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:05,143
Bonjour again.

85
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:06,942
Bonjour again, Solo.

86
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:09,609
"Captain Abisha Slade had a slave...

87
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,015
"his name was Stephen...

88
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:14,578
"who produced the first
bright leaf tobacco in 1839

89
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:17,353
...in Caswell County."

90
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:20,020
That's right here.

91
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:24,632
"The farmer needed sandy soil...

92
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,134
...and the Appalachian
Piedmont has it."

93
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:29,068
- That's here.
- Bijou, can I see this, actually?

94
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,606
No. What about my cell phone?

95
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:32,198
You know what your mom said.

96
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,948
- Bye.
- You smell like smoke.

97
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,514
Cab number 7, Cab 7.

98
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:20,356
22922.

99
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:37,575
Hey, William, I thought you
were going to the movies.

100
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:39,477
- I am, and be careful with my stuff.
- With your luggages?

101
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:41,607
- What's going on?
- I sold my apartment.

102
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:43,241
You sold your apartment? What for?

103
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:45,411
Moving into a motel.

104
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,718
I mean, is that all you
have? Where's your stuff?

105
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,348
Don't start your shit with me again.

106
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:51,916
Let's go. I don't want to be late.

107
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:53,690
All right, big dawg.

108
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:00,496
I don't get it, man.

109
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,563
Isn't it better to go to a motel
first, drop off your luggages?

110
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,404
Why am I with you again?

111
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:07,603
How come it's always
you that picks me up?

112
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:09,942
Because I'm your driver now.
You know what I'm saying?

113
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:13,382
And anyway, I have this I
want to give back to you.

114
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,043
- What's this?
- Come on, man.

115
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,145
Last time you were just
upset, so I saved it for you.

116
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,416
Are you stupid?

117
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,321
Or you just don't understand English?

118
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,555
We have a deal. Would you just drive?

119
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,056
All right. Okay. Then you know what?

120
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,033
Could you please call me on
my cell phone from now on?

121
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,729
Because when you call the dispatch,
it's always a problem over there.

122
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,433
I don't really give a shit which
one of you people picks me up.

123
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,409
That's not really
nice. We're friends now.

124
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:41,003
I think I want to know why you
want to go out to that mountain.

125
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,345
Do you ask all your passengers
why they want to go places?

126
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,214
Of course. Sometimes I do.

127
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,651
And when they're fine
ladies, I ask even more, man.

128
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,246
Especially when they have big booties.

129
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,621
You like big booties?

130
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,958
I pick up a lot of big
booties here in this cab.

131
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,463
You like black women?

132
00:09:57,532 --> 00:09:58,760
I know this black woman, right?

133
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,733
She's shaped like a bottle of soda.

134
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:02,702
I can hook you up.

135
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,937
William, you have family here, right?

136
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:10,603
Why don't you move in with them?

137
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,351
Why family don't stay
together in America?

138
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,581
If that was in Senegal...

139
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:20,953
That's where I'm from. In Africa.

140
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:22,787
You know where it is, right?

141
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:24,622
Dakar.

142
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:26,491
Family stay together.

143
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:29,293
We take care of our parents, old people.

144
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,198
Even if they don't have teeth
in their mouths anymore...

145
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:33,429
...we take food and we
put it in their mouths.

146
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:35,131
Then why aren't you there now?

147
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:37,265
I got to make money and send
it back home, that's all.

148
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,639
You know what I mean? I'm going
to go there when I get old.

149
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,373
They're going to take care of me.
Same thing your people can do for you.

150
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:44,938
Who said I want to see my people?

151
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:47,212
Of course you want to see
them. They're your blood.

152
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:49,651
And I'm sure they want to see you.

153
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:11,972
Hi. Can I help you?

154
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,775
No, thank you.

155
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,542
Okay.

156
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,306
Hey! Hey, Solo!

157
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:44,972
Hey, William.

158
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:46,378
What's going on, man?

159
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:49,112
Because of your bullshit we're
late. The movie already started.

160
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,619
You sure you don't want
to see another movie?

161
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,391
I can keep your bags and
come back and get you.

162
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:53,456
That's not a problem.

163
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:55,514
Oh, forget it. Let's find a motel.

164
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:57,355
Okay, but we got to go
pick up someone first.

165
00:11:57,427 --> 00:12:00,191
It's not going to be long. Are you cool?

166
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:01,696
All right.

167
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,972
William, I'm going to
Piedmont Circle Projects.

168
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,737
I mean, I'm talking
about Homicide Circle.

169
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,573
I don't give a shit.

170
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,841
All right, big dawg. Let's go, then.

171
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,409
- Solo. Yo, who this, man?
- Yo, I'm sorry, man.

172
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,960
He's a good friend of mine. Come on in.

173
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:40,700
Look, you can't be having
people riding with you.

174
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:42,537
I'm sorry. It's cool,
though. Come on in.

175
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,941
Old timer, slide over, bro.

176
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:45,979
Chill out, man. That's my homey William.

177
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:48,173
Man got to have somewhere
to sit. Know what I mean?

178
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,740
- Damn.
- William, this is Roc.

179
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:52,251
- What up, player?
- Chillin', man.

180
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:53,547
All right.

181
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:19,146
Solo, turn right on Broad for me.

182
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,844
- I got you, bro.
- Good look.

183
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,287
Don't leave, man.

184
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,690
I got you, man. I'll be around.

185
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,287
- Give me the wait time if you got to.
- All right.

186
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:40,002
He's not going to be long, all right?

187
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:42,039
Just a couple more stops
and back to his place.

188
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:44,734
You know what I'm saying?
One of my preferred clients.

189
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:55,884
Big dawg, I got to go take a pee.

190
00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:57,582
You know what I'm
saying? Are you all right?

191
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:58,885
You okay?

192
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,723
I'll be right back.

193
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:22,705
Cab
6-4. 6-4.

194
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,488
Solo.

195
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:34,821
Come on, Solo, wake up!

196
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:46,739
- Yo, let's go!
- What's going on?

197
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:47,935
Hey, where's Solo at?

198
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,638
- Pissing.
- Aw, sh...

199
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:51,305
Solo, come on. Let's go, dawg!

200
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:52,568
- We got to hurry up!
- Oh, shit.

201
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:53,776
- Come on!
- What's going on?

202
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,183
They tripping, dawg. We
got to get up out of here.

203
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:57,914
Come back here! Get the fuck back here!

204
00:14:57,988 --> 00:14:58,977
- What happened?
- Solo, let's go!

205
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:01,490
Get me the fuck out of
here! Get me out of here!

206
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:03,025
Drive, man, drive!

207
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:04,493
- Damn!
- Shit!

208
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,052
Roc, what's going on? Why they tripping?

209
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:09,259
- I told you I got the wait time on.
- William, you all right?

210
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,307
Hey, Navani! Navani!

211
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,004
Did he tell you why he left Winston?

212
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,013
No. He just said it was 30 years ago.

213
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:23,844
That's it? No friends, no family?

214
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,077
I already told you, he
didn't say anything else.

215
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:28,211
He seems cool. I think he's fine.

216
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,313
Listen. Offer him a round on me, okay?

217
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,948
Okay, babe.

218
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:34,550
Solo, when you finally
going to get that cab fixed?

219
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:35,628
I got you.

220
00:15:35,696 --> 00:15:37,323
I'm just waiting for
this part, you know?

221
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:39,228
Listen, man. I told you.

222
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:41,494
I got a connect in Maryland.

223
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:46,029
This girl done told him she
got a 725 on the credit score.

224
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:48,667
Says she can get us 20
Gs for these cabs now.

225
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:52,372
I need you to put the
drivers in the car for me.

226
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:54,142
We could have this fire
all around the town.

227
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:57,151
Have the whole city smoking good, cuz.

228
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,949
- I got a major supply coming in right now.
- It's from Solo.

229
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:03,687
Cheers, William!

230
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,924
Solo, are you hearing me?

231
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:10,397
Yo, man!

232
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,401
You paying me any attention, cuz?

233
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:15,302
I need you to get that cab fixed
so we can get this deal going on.

234
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,135
I got you, player. I got you.

235
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,401
You know what? Let's keep playing.

236
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,238
I need to get my $20 back anyway.

237
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,074
All right.

238
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,545
Check this out.

239
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,343
That's what I'm talking
about. What you got?

240
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,454
I'm going to hit me another.

241
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:28,509
All right, we'll see.

242
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,282
That's the first one
you done hit all day.

243
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,213
William.

244
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:07,485
Come on, we're here.

245
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,923
Where?

246
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:13,229
At my place.

247
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:15,166
What are we doing here?

248
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:18,637
Big dawg, I couldn't find
a motel on the way here.

249
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:19,934
Why didn't you wake me up?

250
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:22,238
I tried, but you wouldn't wake up.

251
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,777
You drank too much.

252
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,244
Big dawg, it's not a problem.

253
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,443
You got drunk, but we
had a good time, right?

254
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,281
I get drunk all the time.
You know what I'm saying?

255
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:32,342
Plus, we're already here, man.

256
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,615
Come on, let's go. All right?

257
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:35,816
I'll find you a nice
motel tomorrow, I promise.

258
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,085
All right? Let's go, big dawg.

259
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,493
I got you. You know what I'm saying?

260
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:40,621
I'll get you a nice motel tomorrow.

261
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:50,067
No, don't worry about that. Don't worry.

262
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,405
I got it, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

263
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,148
William, this is my wife's place.

264
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:00,548
- All right?
- Navani?

265
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:01,642
No. Navani's my ex.

266
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,311
She doesn't exist here.

267
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:06,357
My wife's name is Quiera, okay?

268
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:08,325
William, my wife's name is Quiera.

269
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:10,384
All right! Keep your dick in your pants.

270
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:14,296
Okay. You know, just
making sure, that's all.

271
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,458
She's pregnant now, and, you know...

272
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,627
...she gets, um... she
gets very sensitive.

273
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:19,035
You know what I mean?

274
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:22,006
This is Machu Picchu.

275
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:25,044
The Inca people, they built
it about 500 years ago.

276
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:26,476
Yeah, I know about it.

277
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:28,173
Really? Wow.

278
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:31,150
I can't believe they did
it with their hands only.

279
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:32,708
You been?

280
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:34,447
No, but I would love to.

281
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:37,013
I hear it's even hard
to breathe over there.

282
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,422
There you go. This is yours.

283
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,393
The bathroom's right here.
You need anything else?

284
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:43,521
Do you want a glass of water, anything?

285
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:45,225
No? Okay.

286
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,824
Have a good night, William.

287
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:48,460
See you tomorrow morning.

288
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,694
Solo, wake up.

289
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:24,941
Solo, wake up.

290
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:26,237
Wake up, Solo.

291
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:29,504
Bonjour, Solo.

292
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,151
Mom wants to talk to you.

293
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:42,750
What's up, baby? You want to talk to me?

294
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,352
- Why you lying to me?
- What's going on?

295
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,159
"Dear Mr. Souléymane Diop...

296
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,894
"your request for a flight attendant
interview with Sun Airlines...

297
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:52,735
...has been processed and
approved for October 15, 2007."

298
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:55,468
- Baby, is this letter you're upset about?
- Solo, this is next week!

299
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,170
Yeah, but this letter is three months
old. I just didn't throw it away.

300
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:02,045
But you promised me to give up
this childish dream, remember?

301
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:03,447
Baby, it's not childish.

302
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:06,315
Why you got to say that all the
time? It's better than driving a taxi.

303
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:08,116
Plus, you know I don't even
want to do that anymore.

304
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:10,020
It doesn't matter what you want to do.

305
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:11,684
We agreed that it was
best for the family...

306
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,727
...if you drive in the day
so you could be with us.

307
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:15,228
Seriously, I did not
study. I gave it up.

308
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,288
Who's going to help me
take care of this baby...

309
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:18,833
...when you're flying
to Florida or New York...

310
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
...for three or four days?

311
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,458
- Baby, I'm here.
- I need you here!

312
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:23,003
That's what I'm saying.
I'm here. I didn't study.

313
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:24,470
And I'm sick of that taxi!

314
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,700
I'm going to call my cousins
to come here and fix it.

315
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,835
No, baby. You know I don't want
your cousins in my business.

316
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:30,811
- Well, fix it!
- I will do it. I'm waiting for...

317
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,508
And who the hell is that old
man sitting in my sofa, huh?

318
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,744
- Tell me!
- That's my friend William.

319
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,218
I don't want your friend
William in my house, okay?

320
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:39,287
Quiera...

321
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:41,505
Quiera, that's not really nice.

322
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,555
I'm sorry, William.

323
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:50,463
Do you want a cup of
coffee? Do you want...

324
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:00,435
Why you don't let my cousins to help?

325
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:02,883
- They want to, Solo.
- I don't want your cousins in my business.

326
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:04,505
- You know that already.
- You don't do anything.

327
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:06,675
All you do is hanging
out with your friends.

328
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:08,242
Baby, calm down. It's okay.

329
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:23,793
I had this one, like, for a month.

330
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,202
A week after, it was
broken. I don't even want it.

331
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:29,538
I don't want to drive a cab. I've
been doing that for three years!

332
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,668
I had given up my
flight attendant thing.

333
00:21:31,745 --> 00:21:34,214
She goes through my stuff, and
she doesn't want to believe me.

334
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:39,176
You have any unsalted
butter and mushrooms?

335
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:40,743
I want to make an omelet.

336
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:42,230
William, did you check in the kitchen?

337
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:43,886
Check in the kitchen.
Take whatever you want.

338
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,620
This is your place here. All right?

339
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:47,491
Take whatever you want.

340
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:52,161
William, do you know about cars?
Can you give me a hand here?

341
00:21:52,234 --> 00:21:53,599
I rode motorcycles.

342
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:56,069
- You mean the big ones?
- Harley.

343
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:57,230
Harley?

344
00:21:57,306 --> 00:21:59,036
You were in a gang and stuff like that?

345
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:04,912
William... Open road,
women, biker's bar.

346
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:06,846
You have a tattoo, right?

347
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:11,046
Oh, my God. That's
what I'm talking about.

348
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,350
Original player.

349
00:22:12,423 --> 00:22:14,789
Wow, William is chillin'!

350
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:08,282
Alex, you want to buy this DVD?

351
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:10,374
- I already saw it.
- It's new.

352
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,078
I already saw it. How
much does this cost?

353
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:13,552
This is under $50.

354
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:14,883
And actually, they look really good.

355
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:17,926
You go to Silas Creek,
you can pay $70 a piece.

356
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:19,483
Look at this.

357
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:22,292
$70? For that money I
can buy a cell phone.

358
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:24,025
Cell phones are
expensive, but look here.

359
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:25,589
These are really good.
Look at the cloth.

360
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:27,761
Hey, Alex, what you doing here?

361
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:29,168
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

362
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:30,706
Hey, Solo. What's up, man?

363
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:32,639
Alex is trying to get a cell phone.

364
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,233
Don't be selling her your crap.

365
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:35,676
- What's up?
- How you doing?

366
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:38,009
- Pretty good.
- What's up, Peter?

367
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:40,276
First time you get the
taxi, and you're still late!

368
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,115
I'm sorry, madame. Sorry about that.

369
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:45,018
If I had a cell phone,
you can just call me.

370
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,421
- Isn't that right, William?
- Yes.

371
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,821
Where are we going?

372
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:52,294
God knows where your dad's taking me.

373
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,265
I'm telling you, this is
the best place right here.

374
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,894
You got restaurants all over the
place, you can walk down to them.

375
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,699
- It takes five minutes.
- Bye, William.

376
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,204
Bye, Alex.

377
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,104
When is the next time
you're going to the movies?

378
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,302
- I don't know.
- You have my cell phone, right?

379
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,470
Okay. You know what,
just give me a call...

380
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,980
...whenever you need
anything, all right?

381
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,948
Okay?

382
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,382
Bye, William.

383
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,098
You think he's okay in there?

384
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,933
If he didn't like it,
he would just leave.

385
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,701
Yeah, I know, but you don't understand.

386
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:35,902
I understand more than you.

387
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:37,535
- Hey, Malaak.
- Hey, Solo.

388
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:38,650
- How you doing?
- Very good.

389
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,806
- How are you?
- I'm good.

390
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:41,437
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

391
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:44,384
Listen, I want to ask you a favor.
Could you keep an eye on my friend?

392
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:46,545
If anybody comes, if a taxi
comes and picks him up...

393
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:48,089
...if anything strange
happens, please let me know.

394
00:24:48,157 --> 00:24:49,157
- I will.
- All right?

395
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:50,214
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

396
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:51,293
- Hey, Solo?
- Yeah.

397
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,328
Can I get a phone card next time?

398
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:54,624
You mean a ten-dollar phone card?

399
00:24:54,697 --> 00:24:55,959
- Yes, sir.
- I got you, big dawg.

400
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:57,032
- Bye.
- Bye.

401
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:59,499
- Have a good night.
- Bye, Alex.

402
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:14,038
Quiera, I'm really sorry,
but it's just not working.

403
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,174
No, no, Quiera, I did...

404
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,184
Whatever you asked me to do, I did it.

405
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:20,051
Whatever... No, no,
no, I never said that.

406
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:21,784
No, listen, listen. No, Quiera, listen!

407
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:23,985
Quiera! Hello? Hello?

408
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:31,065
She doesn't sound good.

409
00:26:31,135 --> 00:26:34,332
I'm glad her aunt and her
niece are moving in, because...

410
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:37,240
What are you doing?

411
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:40,743
Dawg, I don't even know
what I'm doing right now.

412
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:43,837
Who the hell told you to come here?

413
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:46,383
You know I can't go to
Navani. I mean, I just can't.

414
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:48,715
And Roc... Roc is in with some
stuff I'm not interested in...

415
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,846
- So I figured maybe for a couple days...
- No.

416
00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:52,389
- ...I could...
- There's no room.

417
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:54,084
Big dawg, this place is huge!

418
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,218
In Africa ten people can sleep in here.

419
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:57,922
Ten people! And plus, see?

420
00:26:57,997 --> 00:26:59,464
This is all I have. This is all.

421
00:26:59,532 --> 00:27:00,965
I have nothing else. See this bag?

422
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,660
This is the only thing I have here!

423
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:05,602
This sofa is perfect. All I
need is a tiny place to study.

424
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:07,036
I didn't tell you.

425
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:09,370
Check this out.

426
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:10,671
I'm studying for my interview.

427
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:12,507
And this time, I'm going all the way.

428
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:14,513
I'm telling you, all the way.

429
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:17,175
No stopping! Quiera says I can't do it.

430
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,979
Why not? I can do it!

431
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,781
I can do it, because you know what?

432
00:27:20,854 --> 00:27:23,187
I want to do it. That's all.

433
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:25,748
So, big dawg, I'm just going to
chill in here and study, all right?

434
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:27,419
Is that cool with you?

435
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:28,860
See? I'm sitting here, I'm studying.

436
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,261
Can you see me? You can't see me.

437
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:32,561
You're chilling over there,
watching TV. I'm here chilling, man.

438
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:34,567
You know what I'm saying?
This light over here...

439
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:36,797
...if I turn it off and I don't
smile, you're not gonna notice...

440
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,635
Stay out of my stuff!

441
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,675
Keep your shit over
there and leave me alone.

442
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,970
Thank you very much, big dawg.

443
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:43,978
That's what I'm talking about.

444
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:45,479
Thank you. I appreciate that.

445
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:47,105
I appreciate it.

446
00:27:53,523 --> 00:27:56,185
I have my interview on Monday,
and I'm going to ace it.

447
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,853
I really don't give a shit.

448
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,020
I don't want to know.

449
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:03,828
I don't want to know about Quiera
or anything about your life.

450
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:07,370
Sorry about that.

451
00:28:21,987 --> 00:28:24,854
If you like this place, you can
keep it when I leave next week.

452
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:29,754
Their rates are very fair.

453
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,023
6-4, 6-4.
Pork Chop.

454
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:35,622
Come on, Cab 64.

455
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,362
Have you ever heard of this
place called Blowing Rock?

456
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:40,336
Blowing Rock? Well, of course I have.

457
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,736
It's up in the mountains near Boone.

458
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:45,207
Actually, I know where it is, but
do you know if there's anything...

459
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:47,268
...happening there on October 20th?

460
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:48,711
Not to my knowledge.

461
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,441
We used to go there when we were kids.

462
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:53,678
It's the only place in the world
where the snow goes upside down.

463
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:56,414
What? I mean, what do you mean?

464
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:59,515
It's so windy, if you throw a
stick or anything off the rock...

465
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:02,618
...it gets blown back into the sky.

466
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:04,094
Blown back up to the sky?

467
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:06,529
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, Cab 64.

468
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,658
That's why it's called "Blowing Rock."

469
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,798
All right. 6-4 out.

470
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:48,770
Sorry, William. I didn't
mean to wake you up.

471
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,318
I got us some playing cards.

472
00:30:57,287 --> 00:31:02,156
And I know you like DVDs, so
I got you some new releases.

473
00:31:02,225 --> 00:31:04,490
We don't have a DVD player.

474
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,621
- Now would you be quiet?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

475
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,859
Just because I know you
like movies, you know.

476
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,491
Sorry about that.

477
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,609
Man, I miss them.

478
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,041
Alex is getting ready
to go to school now.

479
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:25,083
She's probably having breakfast
with Quiera in the kitchen.

480
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,227
Are you married, William?

481
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:45,069
I was.

482
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:49,202
What happened? You divorced?

483
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:52,336
My wife left me 30 years ago.

484
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:54,847
I'm sorry to hear that.

485
00:31:57,152 --> 00:32:00,019
And do you have any kids?

486
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:02,648
No. None.

487
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:05,192
I'm trying to sleep.

488
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,955
Sorry about that.

489
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:10,396
It's just that I'm going to
have my first kid soon, you know?

490
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:23,439
Goodnight, William.

491
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,858
"First Aid and the Flight Attendant.

492
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:07,689
"Flight attendants
are not responsible...

493
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:11,094
"for diagnosing illness,
but to support life.

494
00:33:11,164 --> 00:33:13,029
"No medicines.

495
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:14,124
"Bleeding.

496
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:15,430
"Burns.

497
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:17,562
Heart attacks."

498
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:51,131
This is just vitamin C, aspirin,
calcium, and antihistamine.

499
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:52,732
Antihistamine? What's that?

500
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,662
That's something that's
used to counter histamines.

501
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:56,111
And what does that mean?

502
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,477
If somebody has allergies.

503
00:33:57,548 --> 00:34:00,016
These are just
over-the-counter drugs.

504
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:01,642
So none of those is
for anything serious?

505
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,719
No.

506
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:04,845
Like when somebody's
about to die or something?

507
00:34:04,922 --> 00:34:06,288
Excuse me?

508
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:08,622
You know, something like
cancer or something like that?

509
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:11,025
No. Sir, if you're not feeling well...

510
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:13,621
I suggest you consult with a physician.

511
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,188
Are you okay?

512
00:34:17,602 --> 00:34:19,628
I'm sorry about that, sir.

513
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:20,865
Thank you. Thank you very much.

514
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,496
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

515
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:23,975
No. I'm good.

516
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:26,534
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Okay.

517
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,202
There we go.

518
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,510
- William and me, we're in room 213...
- You already told me that.

519
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:01,880
I already put it in.

520
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:03,692
How did you even learn
the cell phone that fast?

521
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:05,652
It's not hard.

522
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:08,986
Now whenever you need a taxi,
you can call me, all right?

523
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:16,191
Bijou, it's going to
be all right, you know?

524
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:17,961
Mom says you're going to come back.

525
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,368
Whatever happened between Mom
and me has nothing to do with you.

526
00:35:20,403 --> 00:35:21,427
You understand that, right?

527
00:35:21,504 --> 00:35:22,937
It doesn't matter if I understand.

528
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:26,067
It doesn't change anything in the past.

529
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:27,477
When you grow up, you'll understand.

530
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:30,514
I don't want to grow up
and learn all that bullshit.

531
00:35:30,581 --> 00:35:32,446
Where did you learn this word?

532
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:35,343
You know what?

533
00:35:35,419 --> 00:35:37,888
I bet you can't even use this
phone to take a picture of me.

534
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:39,549
- Can, too.
- You don't know how to do that.

535
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:40,683
I'll prove it.

536
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:43,227
You'll prove it? All right, there we go.

537
00:35:50,103 --> 00:35:52,367
Let me see.

538
00:35:52,438 --> 00:35:55,168
How come this hot dog
looks better than me?

539
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:56,936
That's not fair.

540
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,978
No. You know what? Show me, show me.

541
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:00,410
How do you do that?

542
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:31,937
Thank you. Enjoy the show.

543
00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:33,311
Thank you.

544
00:36:34,884 --> 00:36:36,112
Hey, how can I help you?

545
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:38,050
Yeah, two for Outcast.

546
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,645
All right. That'll be $16, please.

547
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,089
Thank you. Enjoy the show.

548
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:45,423
Thank you.

549
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:48,458
I really liked the movie.

550
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:50,466
- Thanks for recommending it.
- Yeah, no problem.

551
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:51,728
Acting was great.

552
00:36:51,802 --> 00:36:53,030
- I'm a big fan of...
- William!

553
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:00,243
- Good-bye.
- Yep.

554
00:37:00,311 --> 00:37:01,938
Hey, how can I help you?

555
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:06,114
Come in the front, big dawg. Come, come.

556
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:08,346
What did you see? How was your movie?

557
00:37:12,424 --> 00:37:15,257
Why didn't you call me?

558
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:24,294
You've underlined a lot of words.

559
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,894
Yeah, it's because I
don't know the meaning...

560
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:27,906
...or I don't know how to pronounce it.

561
00:37:27,974 --> 00:37:31,910
Big dawg, why don't you
quiz me on a couple of terms?

562
00:37:33,013 --> 00:37:34,776
Okay, we play for this trip.

563
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:37,650
Let me break it down for you.

564
00:37:37,718 --> 00:37:40,846
If I win, it's free.
If you win, it's free.

565
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:44,379
Come on, just a few words till
we get to the motel, player.

566
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:49,529
- "Deadhead."
- All right, big dawg!

567
00:37:49,598 --> 00:37:51,964
All right. So you think you can win?

568
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,762
Okay. All right.

569
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:56,497
So, "deadhead."

570
00:37:56,571 --> 00:37:59,973
"Deadhead" is the transport
of an off-duty crew member...

571
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:03,569
...for the purpose of positioning
for the working of a flight.

572
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:07,005
That's what I'm saying, big dawg.

573
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,051
That's what I'm saying. I'm on it, man.

574
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:11,211
I'm on it. I'm acing it.

575
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:13,102
Wow, you better try harder.
You better try harder.

576
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,148
I'm telling you, or you're
going to pay for this trip.

577
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:20,329
"In the event of a water evacuation...

578
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:23,889
...what are the six steps a
flight attendant must take?"

579
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,799
Water evacuation.

580
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,804
Okay. One, form a barrier.

581
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:32,366
Two, check conditions and
"rhetoric" if exits are blocked.

582
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:36,072
Three, open exits and inflate slide.

583
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,173
Four, when opening a door exit...

584
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,548
...to evacuate an aircraft...

585
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,086
That's strange.

586
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,059
Yo.

587
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:51,597
This is cool.

588
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:53,599
You got to check this
out. Alex sent me that.

589
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,828
I didn't know you could do that.

590
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:01,001
That's cool, right?

591
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,735
Wow.

592
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:08,982
How do you do that?

593
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,745
How do I do that?

594
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:12,979
How do you take a picture
and send it on a phone?

595
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:16,455
I don't know. That's why
I'm kind of surprised.

596
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:19,323
She took my picture, but I didn't know
you could send it through the phone.

597
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:21,555
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

598
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,997
- "Redirect."
- "Redirect."

599
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:27,160
Okay. I got you, big dawg.

600
00:39:27,236 --> 00:39:31,139
"Rhetoric" is... it means
a whole different thing.

601
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:32,299
- Okay.
- "Redirect."

602
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,113
Yo, William, what's up? How you doing?

603
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,477
Where the hell are my clothes?

604
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:42,311
I'm just going to wash them, big dawg.

605
00:40:42,383 --> 00:40:45,216
The place is a little
smelly right now, that's all.

606
00:40:45,286 --> 00:40:47,653
I hope you're not going
to take a nap right now.

607
00:40:47,723 --> 00:40:49,748
I just want to go to the Laundromat.

608
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:52,385
I'll be right back, okay?

609
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:54,885
I'll see you in a second, eh?

610
00:40:54,964 --> 00:40:56,124
Bye.

611
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:18,215
Malaak. Aw, man.

612
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:19,847
Hey, Solo.

613
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:21,482
You got it?

614
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:28,830
- See you, dawg.
- Bye, Solo.

615
00:41:57,931 --> 00:41:59,694
Give me a sentence.

616
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,895
ELB... Emergency Locater "Beckon."

617
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,938
"Beacon," not "Beckon."

618
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:06,473
"Beacon." It's a signal light.

619
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,236
"Beacon."

620
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:10,004
Alex?

621
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:14,010
- Get me some napkins.
- Okay.

622
00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:17,074
Another word is "floo..."

623
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:19,849
"fl-flooter."

624
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:21,583
"Flooter"?

625
00:42:21,657 --> 00:42:23,784
"Flutter"?

626
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:27,818
To move quickly, like a butterfly.

627
00:42:27,897 --> 00:42:30,798
That's kind of cool.

628
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:32,892
Take that to Solo.

629
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:37,133
Thanks, Alex.

630
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:40,040
Big dawg, thank you very much.

631
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,338
That's cool.

632
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:45,705
Thank you. Bon appétit.

633
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:53,053
Good sandwich, William.

634
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:55,149
Thank you.

635
00:42:55,226 --> 00:42:58,196
I'm used to talking to all kinds
of people and I get along with them.

636
00:42:58,263 --> 00:43:00,026
People are happy in my cab...

637
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:03,068
...and I also know how to handle
the ones that aren't so friendly.

638
00:43:03,135 --> 00:43:04,534
Says here you speak French.

639
00:43:04,603 --> 00:43:06,264
I speak French.

640
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:07,669
I speak English, as you can see.

641
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:09,707
I speak Wolof. I speak Spanish.

642
00:43:09,775 --> 00:43:12,267
I mean, I'm getting
better. My wife is Mexican.

643
00:43:12,345 --> 00:43:14,836
I also speak ten other
African languages.

644
00:43:14,914 --> 00:43:16,211
I'm a very curious person.

645
00:43:16,282 --> 00:43:18,045
I like to learn about
people's culture...

646
00:43:18,118 --> 00:43:20,848
...and I think that's very
important for this job.

647
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,287
That's true. Sounds good.

648
00:43:23,357 --> 00:43:25,791
Let's go ahead and
begin the examination.

649
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,385
- I'm ready. Let's do it.
- Okay.

650
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,102
William! William!

651
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:49,679
Well?

652
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,743
I aced it, man! I killed it!

653
00:43:51,821 --> 00:43:53,311
They're going to let
me know in two days.

654
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:55,152
Get your jacket. Let's go, let's go!

655
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:57,158
It's party time
tonight! Get your jacket!

656
00:44:11,074 --> 00:44:14,168
- You like this music right here?
- Yeah, it's okay.

657
00:44:14,244 --> 00:44:16,805
I grew up in the rock and roll era.

658
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:18,007
It's the same, man.

659
00:44:18,082 --> 00:44:20,107
You know, this is reggae, rock and roll.

660
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:21,345
Big dawg, it's the same music.

661
00:44:21,419 --> 00:44:23,717
But I got you. You
want some rock and roll?

662
00:44:23,788 --> 00:44:25,346
If you can find it, yeah.

663
00:44:25,423 --> 00:44:28,222
Here we go. Sure.

664
00:44:28,294 --> 00:44:30,319
I like a little country now and then.

665
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:32,830
All right, no problem.

666
00:44:32,898 --> 00:44:33,898
There we go, big dawg.

667
00:44:36,235 --> 00:44:37,793
I don't know much about
this kind of music...

668
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,701
...but it sounds good to me, too.

669
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:42,640
Well, then you've probably
never heard of Hank Williams.

670
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:44,677
- Hank Williams?
- Yeah.

671
00:44:44,744 --> 00:44:46,473
No, not really.

672
00:44:46,546 --> 00:44:47,843
Not really. Who is that?

673
00:44:47,914 --> 00:44:50,508
The greatest country
writer there ever was.

674
00:44:50,584 --> 00:44:52,711
Wow. Okay. All right.

675
00:44:52,786 --> 00:44:54,550
I'll check him out.

676
00:45:08,203 --> 00:45:09,830
Vargrave's that way.

677
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:11,634
Damn, big dawg.

678
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:14,039
Know what? Let me
make a U-turn up there.

679
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:16,441
Good looking out, big dawg.

680
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:18,775
Good looking out.

681
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:21,812
See if you can hit something.

682
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:23,943
Not with your hand, man.

683
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,578
Not with your hand, with the stick.

684
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:27,589
All right. Let's see that.

685
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:29,557
William, another one for you.

686
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,184
Thank you.

687
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:34,288
All right. Thanks, girl.

688
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:36,799
You know, your ex, she's
got a really nice ass.

689
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,028
Yo, big dawg!

690
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:42,470
- Oh, my, my.
- Come on, Roc.

691
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,097
William, what you got?

692
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,144
It's all that shit he's been
smoking. He can't even see the ball.

693
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:51,609
- Oh, big dawg!
- I believe I scored.

694
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:52,809
Give me five, give me five!

695
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:55,250
That's what I'm talking about!

696
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,480
Yo, man, here's your money.

697
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,118
Yo, William, man.

698
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:04,685
I know this place. You want to go?

699
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:06,163
You want another round?

700
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:07,426
Might as well.

701
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,990
All right! That's
what I'm talking about!

702
00:46:09,068 --> 00:46:10,330
That place, the music is dope.

703
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:14,306
And they have girls with big booties.

704
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:17,967
You like the big booties, don't you?

705
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:35,228
- Oh, yeah!
- Hey, hey, hey!

706
00:46:35,296 --> 00:46:36,593
Okay, Solo.

707
00:46:39,134 --> 00:46:40,499
Yeah!

708
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,169
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Way to go, Solo!

709
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:46,600
- And that...
- They're light.

710
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:48,199
- That... Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

711
00:46:48,277 --> 00:46:49,744
I can't believe what they do now.

712
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:51,804
That's kind of, like, just crazy.

713
00:46:51,881 --> 00:46:53,371
I need to get one of those myself.

714
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,315
You know what I'm
saying? Tired of those...

715
00:46:55,385 --> 00:46:57,683
Hello? Hey, William?

716
00:46:57,754 --> 00:46:59,278
William, it's you?

717
00:46:59,356 --> 00:47:01,153
Yeah, I have my taxi.

718
00:47:01,224 --> 00:47:02,350
To the bank? Yeah.

719
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:04,394
No problem. I got you, all right?

720
00:47:04,462 --> 00:47:05,520
- Yo!
- What's up?

721
00:47:05,596 --> 00:47:07,063
Can you take me somewhere?
Just five minutes.

722
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:08,496
I got to go pick up a friend.

723
00:47:08,566 --> 00:47:10,122
After that, you can
drop me off at Willard.

724
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:11,828
- I got a trip right now.
- Come on, man.

725
00:47:11,902 --> 00:47:12,960
I got you. Don't worry.

726
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:15,112
- I got your back, all right?
- All right, I'll take you.

727
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:16,639
- See you guys!
- All right, guys.

728
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,790
Here we are, gentlemen.

729
00:47:31,858 --> 00:47:33,189
No, William. We'll wait for you.

730
00:47:33,259 --> 00:47:34,297
- Seven dollars.
- It's fine.

731
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:35,555
Come on, man. We'll wait for you.

732
00:47:35,628 --> 00:47:37,323
It's okay. You're not going to be long.

733
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,991
- I'm closing my accounts.
- Thank you very much.

734
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,366
William, what do you mean
you're closing your accounts?

735
00:47:48,275 --> 00:47:50,243
So we going back to Willard?

736
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:58,044
You know we will wait for you. I
have to take a nap anyway, all right?

737
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:00,053
- I got stuff to do afterwards.
- That's great!

738
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:01,520
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

739
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:03,022
I'll go get my cab.

740
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:04,581
Wait for me here, okay?

741
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:19,035
Man, I don't know
what's going on here...

742
00:48:19,108 --> 00:48:20,769
...but I got someone waiting on me.

743
00:48:20,843 --> 00:48:23,574
Do you want me to take
you back to Willard or not?

744
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:25,114
Come on, Souléymane.

745
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:27,650
Let's go, man. Let's go.

746
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:10,620
Yo, Solo!

747
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,392
Yo!

748
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:27,677
Solo, you left your jacket
in Oz's cab last night.

749
00:49:27,749 --> 00:49:30,718
That's William's. Thank you.

750
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:32,616
Yes, sir. Thank you.

751
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:08,581
William?

752
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:16,328
William, are you there?

753
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:39,349
William.

754
00:53:42,122 --> 00:53:43,953
William, are you awake?

755
00:53:46,461 --> 00:53:47,951
No.

756
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,592
What's wrong?

757
00:53:50,665 --> 00:53:52,565
Please tell me what's wrong with you.

758
00:53:52,634 --> 00:53:55,762
I can't do this anymore.

759
00:53:55,837 --> 00:53:57,464
I know you don't want me to say that...

760
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:00,202
It's late. I'm sleeping.

761
00:54:05,014 --> 00:54:07,642
I'm sorry. I went through your stuff
and I took your pills to the pharmacy.

762
00:54:07,716 --> 00:54:11,152
There's nothing wrong with
you. It's only vitamins.

763
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,587
I didn't want to, but I had to.

764
00:54:13,657 --> 00:54:16,490
Things are good, and you still
want to go and close your account.

765
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,085
Why do you want to do this?

766
00:54:23,867 --> 00:54:25,893
I went to the cinema tonight.

767
00:54:27,205 --> 00:54:28,866
The boy was there.

768
00:54:30,575 --> 00:54:34,568
William, I saw his photo in your
jacket. You left it in the taxi.

769
00:54:34,645 --> 00:54:37,079
Who is he?

770
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,379
You told me you had no kids.
Why are you lying to me?

771
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:41,112
I'm telling you everything.

772
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,479
Is he your grandson?

773
00:54:54,534 --> 00:54:55,933
William.

774
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,830
William, I want to help you.

775
00:54:59,906 --> 00:55:02,875
Did you talk to him?

776
00:55:02,942 --> 00:55:04,035
William, please.

777
00:55:07,615 --> 00:55:10,584
- Did you fucking talk to him?
- No, I didn't.

778
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:12,133
But he doesn't know
who you are, does he?

779
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:13,186
Why don't you tell him?

780
00:55:13,254 --> 00:55:16,918
I want you to get your shit
and get the fuck out of here.

781
00:55:16,992 --> 00:55:18,926
William, why are you speaking this way?

782
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,998
- William.
- Get the fuck out!

783
00:55:25,066 --> 00:55:27,432
We're friends now, and you want
to leave me and him, the boy?

784
00:55:27,502 --> 00:55:29,561
Who the fuck told you you
could get into my life?

785
00:55:29,638 --> 00:55:31,004
Who the fuck do you think you are...

786
00:55:31,073 --> 00:55:32,631
...that you can touch
anything that belongs to me?

787
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:33,868
I got to tell him.

788
00:55:33,943 --> 00:55:36,070
I got to bring him here
so you're not going to...

789
00:55:38,781 --> 00:55:40,612
You're not going to
tell him a damn thing.

790
00:55:40,683 --> 00:55:42,241
You understand me?

791
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:46,278
I told you from day one,
stay the fuck out of my life!

792
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:52,621
I put the photo back.

793
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:10,847
William, please, don't leave.

794
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:12,645
I want you to stay.

795
00:56:12,718 --> 00:56:15,482
Alex wants you to stay and
the boy wants you to stay...

796
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:17,078
...if you tell him.

797
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:21,721
I got to get some ice.

798
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,922
- No, I'll get it for you.
- Sit down and shut up!

799
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:25,328
Sit down!

800
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:30,464
I want you to get your things,
leave, and don't come back.

801
00:56:30,537 --> 00:56:31,868
- But, William...
- No!

802
00:56:31,938 --> 00:56:34,031
Our deal for the 20th is off.

803
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:36,599
You're no longer my driver.

804
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,963
Shit. Fucker.

805
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:35,700
Slow down, man.

806
00:57:35,774 --> 00:57:38,072
Jesus Christ.

807
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,392
Mom saw the letter. She
doesn't want you to come in.

808
00:58:27,262 --> 00:58:29,127
- Did she open it?
- No.

809
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:31,997
- What happened to your eye?
- I just fell.

810
00:58:32,068 --> 00:58:34,764
It doesn't look like you
fell. Did someone hit you?

811
00:58:36,906 --> 00:58:39,272
- I miss you, Alex.
- I do, too.

812
00:58:39,342 --> 00:58:40,342
I need to start going.

813
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,502
Wait, wait. You don't want to know?

814
00:58:41,578 --> 00:58:43,705
Yeah, you can just text me! Good luck!

815
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,305
Bye, Alex.

816
00:59:20,453 --> 00:59:23,946
Hi, William. It's me, Solo.

817
00:59:24,024 --> 00:59:27,084
I wanted to tell you I got
the results of my interview.

818
00:59:28,228 --> 00:59:30,059
William, I failed.

819
00:59:31,565 --> 00:59:34,193
I thought you'd want to know.

820
00:59:34,268 --> 00:59:37,432
Yeah, you were clear, but
I thought you'd want...

821
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:39,029
Yeah, but...

822
00:59:55,357 --> 00:59:58,815
Come in, Cab 75. 75.

823
01:00:00,796 --> 01:00:02,492
75.

824
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:08,702
75, get 941. 941J.

825
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,603
Holland Avenue.

826
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:13,040
Alex, what are you doing up so late?

827
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,578
What? Right now?

828
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,273
I'm going to be there!
I'll be there right now!

829
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:18,576
Pork Chop.

830
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,549
Please, give me the keys.
Give me the keys for 64.

831
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,449
- What's wrong, Solo?
- Girl, I got to go!

832
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,920
- Please give me the keys, girl!
- I can't do it.

833
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:26,957
No, I'm not going to do it.

834
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:28,617
- You need to calm down.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

835
01:00:28,694 --> 01:00:30,361
Don't be running up in
here, acting like that.

836
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,623
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the keys back.

837
01:00:31,697 --> 01:00:33,858
I told you you couldn't get the keys.

838
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:39,867
Hurry up, Solo. Where were you?

839
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,902
- Hurry up!
- How is she?

840
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:44,637
- She's fine. It's a boy.
- It's a boy?

841
01:00:44,711 --> 01:00:45,711
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

842
01:00:45,778 --> 01:00:46,938
Where is she?

843
01:00:47,013 --> 01:00:49,004
She's over there, but
I need to check in.

844
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:50,453
- Over there?
- This is my step-dad...

845
01:00:50,483 --> 01:00:52,246
Come on, let's go. Is this Quiera Diop?

846
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:54,412
- Yes, that hallway.
- Okay.

847
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:56,080
Wow, how's the baby? You see the baby?

848
01:00:58,259 --> 01:00:59,920
I got a boy.

849
01:01:17,078 --> 01:01:18,340
Quiera, you all right?

850
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:21,383
I told you a hundred
times we are both fine.

851
01:01:25,221 --> 01:01:26,813
I like that you speak Spanish to him.

852
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:28,652
He's going to grow up
speaking four languages.

853
01:01:28,724 --> 01:01:31,215
And how is he supposed to
learn French and Wolof, huh?

854
01:01:31,294 --> 01:01:33,320
Tell me.

855
01:01:33,397 --> 01:01:35,422
I just don't understand.

856
01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:37,524
I saw how happy you
were holding the baby...

857
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:39,626
...in your hands just now.

858
01:01:39,703 --> 01:01:41,261
You know we love you.

859
01:01:41,338 --> 01:01:44,068
And you know that we
want what's best for you.

860
01:01:44,141 --> 01:01:46,269
And I know you love us.

861
01:01:46,344 --> 01:01:48,175
You can't leave.

862
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:01,724
Solo, you have to trust me.

863
01:02:01,794 --> 01:02:05,252
I wish you could trust me,
too. And that's the problem.

864
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:08,494
Quiera, you know I love you, and
I'd do anything for the family.

865
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:10,398
But I've always tried things your way...

866
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:12,700
...and you never gave my way a chance.

867
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:14,467
And I wish you can understand that.

868
01:02:16,509 --> 01:02:18,033
I'm going to come back.

869
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,841
I'm going to call you to see if you
need anything else before I come.

870
01:02:23,016 --> 01:02:24,574
Have a good night.

871
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,353
Hey, can I help you?

872
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:39,027
Sir?

873
01:03:39,098 --> 01:03:41,464
- Hi.
- Hey.

874
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:47,200
You work here, right?

875
01:03:47,274 --> 01:03:48,764
Excuse me?

876
01:03:48,842 --> 01:03:51,276
- You work at night.
- Sometimes.

877
01:03:51,344 --> 01:03:53,539
Would you like to see a movie?

878
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,250
Sir?

879
01:03:57,318 --> 01:04:00,651
Do you know this old man called William?

880
01:04:00,721 --> 01:04:03,019
Excuse me, who are you talking about?

881
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,455
We have some screenings in an hour.

882
01:04:04,525 --> 01:04:06,083
Would you like a ticket?

883
01:04:08,162 --> 01:04:09,162
Sir?

884
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,233
- Sir?
- Sorry.

885
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:15,395
Forget about it. Sorry about that.

886
01:04:15,471 --> 01:04:16,733
Okay.

887
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,332
6-4,
6-4.

888
01:04:45,402 --> 01:04:47,393
Come on, Cab 64.

889
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:50,532
Pork Chop, who's been to the
King's Inn Motel since yesterday?

890
01:04:50,609 --> 01:04:52,668
Come on now, 64.

891
01:04:52,744 --> 01:04:54,905
No, really, girl. You
got to help me out here.

892
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,811
34 picked that trip up.

893
01:04:56,882 --> 01:04:59,214
Mamadou. A half an hour ago.

894
01:04:59,284 --> 01:05:02,186
Mamadou? And where is he at?

895
01:05:02,255 --> 01:05:05,520
Around the Baptist area.

896
01:05:05,591 --> 01:05:06,888
All right, 6-4 out.

897
01:05:11,998 --> 01:05:15,264
3-4, 3-4,
this is 6-4.

898
01:05:15,335 --> 01:05:17,394
3-4,
6-4.

899
01:05:18,906 --> 01:05:20,965
Mamadou, this is Solo.

900
01:05:24,578 --> 01:05:27,946
3-4, 3-4,
this is 6-4.

901
01:05:28,983 --> 01:05:32,043
3-4, 3-4,
this is 6-4.

902
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,555
3-4,
3-4, 6-4.

903
01:05:52,441 --> 01:05:54,137
3-4, Mamadou.

904
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:56,610
This is Solo, 6-4.

905
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:11,319
Mamadou!

906
01:06:11,395 --> 01:06:13,158
Pull over, pull over!

907
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:15,323
Mamadou, unroll your window.

908
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,524
What do you want?

909
01:06:17,602 --> 01:06:19,264
I want to ask you something.

910
01:06:19,338 --> 01:06:20,566
Pull over! Pull over right here.

911
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:22,539
I can't do it. I got
customers in my car.

912
01:06:23,842 --> 01:06:26,402
I got to talk to you.
Mamadou, I got to talk to you.

913
01:06:26,478 --> 01:06:28,742
All right, fine. Follow me.

914
01:06:47,434 --> 01:06:49,766
Hey, man, what's going on? I got a trip.

915
01:06:49,837 --> 01:06:51,464
I want to ask you something real quick.

916
01:06:51,538 --> 01:06:53,438
Listen, did you pick up an
old man 30 minutes ago...

917
01:06:53,507 --> 01:06:55,702
- At the King's Inn Motel?
- Yeah. So what?

918
01:06:55,776 --> 01:06:57,300
Did he offer you a trip
for tomorrow morning?

919
01:06:57,378 --> 01:06:58,903
- No.
- Why are you lying?

920
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,345
What the fuck is going on?

921
01:07:00,415 --> 01:07:02,178
Okay, whatever deal you
guys have is cancelled.

922
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,684
- The deal is not fucking cancelled.
- Mamadou, the deal is cancelled.

923
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:07,916
- The man paid me $200 deposit, man.
- I don't give a shit about his $200.

924
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:09,820
And plus, you see?
You're a fucking liar.

925
01:07:09,891 --> 01:07:11,553
- Are you calling me a fucking liar?
- You're a liar!

926
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,821
Mamadou, I'm talking to you.

927
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,658
- Don't fucking grab me.
- I'm talking to you...

928
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,760
Hey, come on, you guys.

929
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,400
Mamadou, I don't care
about the money, all right?

930
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,065
But you're going to tell
me where you dropped him.

931
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:26,439
Fuck you, man!

932
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,341
I swear you're going to tell
me where you dropped him.

933
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:30,607
- Hey, man. Easy.
- Come on, chill out, man.

934
01:07:30,681 --> 01:07:32,911
- Come on, dawg.
- Mamadou, where did you drop him?

935
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:34,007
Hold on. Hold it, man.

936
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,926
What do you want?

937
01:08:15,996 --> 01:08:17,930
I'm here to take you
where you want to go.

938
01:08:17,998 --> 01:08:20,432
Where's my driver? I didn't ask for you.

939
01:08:20,501 --> 01:08:23,368
William, I'm here to take
you wherever you want to go.

940
01:08:28,209 --> 01:08:29,677
Where to?

941
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,407
The motel.

942
01:08:53,202 --> 01:08:57,162
William, I saw the other driver
and he canceled the trip with you.

943
01:08:57,241 --> 01:08:58,674
I'll take you tomorrow morning.

944
01:08:58,742 --> 01:09:00,437
That was our deal.

945
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,479
What time should I pick you up?

946
01:09:22,802 --> 01:09:24,463
8 a. m.

947
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:49,956
William.

948
01:11:52,262 --> 01:11:53,286
Good morning.

949
01:11:53,363 --> 01:11:55,058
Morning.

950
01:11:55,131 --> 01:11:56,656
Thank you.

951
01:11:56,734 --> 01:11:59,965
You want to wash up?
Then we'll be leaving.

952
01:13:17,988 --> 01:13:22,220
"I made a joke about
how bad a film was...

953
01:13:22,292 --> 01:13:26,889
"and when he laughed, his lip twitched.

954
01:13:26,964 --> 01:13:29,330
He looked just like his mother."

955
01:13:52,992 --> 01:13:55,051
"He's studying hard.

956
01:13:55,128 --> 01:13:57,722
"I'm trying to help him the best I can.

957
01:13:57,797 --> 01:13:59,958
I think he will pass."

958
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:35,166
"I don't think Solo knows
that Alex fixed the curtains.

959
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:37,263
"She is so smart.

960
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,934
I wonder who she will become."

961
01:15:26,259 --> 01:15:27,886
Isn't that nice?

962
01:15:27,961 --> 01:15:29,360
See? Almost new.

963
01:15:29,429 --> 01:15:30,953
You like that?

964
01:15:36,002 --> 01:15:38,062
It's very nice.

965
01:15:38,139 --> 01:15:40,471
Thank you.

966
01:15:55,624 --> 01:15:57,285
William, I have a favor.

967
01:15:57,359 --> 01:15:59,793
- I want Alex to come with us.
- No.

968
01:16:01,763 --> 01:16:04,130
William, I just can't come back alone.

969
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,930
I can't believe you're saying that. No.

970
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:11,938
I need Alex with me.

971
01:16:12,008 --> 01:16:13,771
Please allow me that.

972
01:16:36,034 --> 01:16:37,626
Hi, William. Hi, Solo.

973
01:16:37,702 --> 01:16:40,330
- Hi, Alex.
- You ready?

974
01:18:55,451 --> 01:18:57,078
Come on, hurry up.

975
01:18:59,722 --> 01:19:01,656
Hurry up, slowpokes.

976
01:19:26,451 --> 01:19:28,351
Blowing Rock's this way! Come on!

977
01:19:28,419 --> 01:19:30,046
Hey, Alex, don't you
want some ice cream?

978
01:19:30,121 --> 01:19:31,589
No. I want to go to Blowing Rock.

979
01:19:31,657 --> 01:19:33,361
We will, but let's go
get some ice cream first.

980
01:19:33,392 --> 01:19:34,430
They have cookies and cream.

981
01:19:34,493 --> 01:19:35,790
- They do?
- Yeah.

982
01:19:35,861 --> 01:19:38,796
Wow! Come on, William.
What are you going to get?

983
01:19:38,864 --> 01:19:41,230
Alex, William has to go meet a
friend. He's going to be late.

984
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,769
- So let's go, and we'll meet him later.
- Are you sure?

985
01:19:45,004 --> 01:19:46,004
Yes.

986
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:47,835
Okay. Bye, William.

987
01:19:47,907 --> 01:19:50,307
Bye, Alex.

988
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,061
Hurry up, Solo!

989
01:20:18,406 --> 01:20:20,374
Solo, come on.

990
01:20:29,685 --> 01:20:31,152
Come on.

991
01:20:32,822 --> 01:20:35,519
Isn't this place so pretty?

992
01:20:38,362 --> 01:20:41,126
I'm going to get two
scoops of ice cream.

993
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,427
Pretty cool, huh?

994
01:22:23,508 --> 01:22:25,408
Do you know if you throw
a stick off Blowing Rock...

995
01:22:25,477 --> 01:22:26,535
...it comes right back to you?

996
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:28,943
- For real?
- Yeah.

997
01:22:29,014 --> 01:22:30,014
Cool! Come on, let's go.

998
01:22:30,081 --> 01:22:32,277
- We'll go later.
- No, come on!

999
01:22:32,351 --> 01:22:33,613
Alex.

1000
01:22:33,686 --> 01:22:35,210
Come on.

1001
01:22:35,287 --> 01:22:36,845
Alex, wait.

1002
01:22:38,424 --> 01:22:39,982
Alex, come back.

1003
01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:45,991
Hurry up, Solo.

1004
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:49,035
Watch out, Alex. I don't
want you to fall down.

1005
01:22:54,675 --> 01:22:56,666
Hurry up, Solo. There's Blowing Rock!

1006
01:22:59,681 --> 01:23:01,842
Hold on. Watch out.

1007
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:03,281
Hurry, up!

1008
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:11,582
Hurry up, Solo.

1009
01:23:17,066 --> 01:23:18,693
Look, Solo, look!

1010
01:23:21,704 --> 01:23:23,399
- No.
- But I want to see.

1011
01:23:23,472 --> 01:23:25,771
You're going to fall. It's dangerous.

1012
01:23:25,842 --> 01:23:27,605
Then let me go get another stick.

1013
01:23:27,677 --> 01:23:30,145
Yeah, but be very careful, okay?

1014
01:24:53,702 --> 01:24:56,604
Hey, Alex, be careful!

1015
01:24:56,673 --> 01:24:58,732
No, it's too dangerous. I
don't want you to come here.

1016
01:24:58,809 --> 01:24:59,809
It's too dangerous.

1017
01:24:59,876 --> 01:25:02,208
Then here, Solo. You throw it.

1018
01:25:46,226 --> 01:25:48,195
Is this your textbook?

1019
01:25:48,262 --> 01:25:49,593
Yes.

1020
01:25:49,663 --> 01:25:52,257
Are you going to try again?

1021
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,866
I think so.

1022
01:25:55,936 --> 01:25:58,302
Let me give you a
little quiz right here.

1023
01:26:00,204 --> 01:26:04,000
Let's see. What is "XLV"?

1024
01:26:05,881 --> 01:26:09,476
Aw, come on, Solo. I know you know it.

1025
01:26:09,551 --> 01:26:10,685
"Extra Life Vest."

1026
01:26:10,686 --> 01:26:11,783
You see? You got it right.

1027
01:26:11,854 --> 01:26:13,686
Bravo!

1028
01:26:14,157 --> 01:26:15,384
Let me find another one.

1029
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,718
I'm sure you can get this one.

1030
01:26:19,795 --> 01:26:22,263
"In the event of a water evacuation...

1031
01:26:22,331 --> 01:26:27,133
...what are the six steps a
flight attendant must take?"

1032
01:26:27,204 --> 01:26:30,071
Come on, Solo, I know you.

1033
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:32,540
You can get them.

1034
01:26:32,609 --> 01:26:35,942
One, form a barrier.

1035
01:26:36,013 --> 01:26:39,347
Two, check conditions and redirect...

1036
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:41,408
...when exits are blocked.

1037
01:26:41,486 --> 01:26:46,321
Three, open exits and inflate slides.

1038
01:26:46,391 --> 01:26:48,325
You're doing great right now.

1039
01:26:48,393 --> 01:26:52,854
Four, when opening a door
exit to evacuate an aircraft...

1040
01:26:52,932 --> 01:26:55,730
...rotate the handle in the
direction of the arrow...

1041
01:26:55,801 --> 01:26:57,735
...and open the door
forcefully enough that...

1042
01:26:57,803 --> 01:27:01,102
...it locks against the
side of the fuselage.
