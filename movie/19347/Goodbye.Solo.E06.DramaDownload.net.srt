Episode 6

2
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,360
Are you cold?

3
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:22,610
A little..

4
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:26,196
Where do you want to go and sit for awhile?

5
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:29,146
But we can't even go to the convenience store for something to drink..

6
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:31,019
Because I didn't bring my wallet with me when I ran out urgently.

7
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:34,423
It's alright. Let's just walk around.

8
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:38,605
Wait a minute..

9
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:51,597
Looks like we can still get some coffee at the convenience store.

10
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,371
It seems the change in season isn't that predictable anymore.

11
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:07,058
It's still snowing in spring.

12
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:24,326
I missed you.

13
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:31,159
Me too.

14
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:42,901
I've given it alot of thought..

15
00:01:54,669 --> 00:02:06,930
What I should do to make it up to Ji-ahn; whether I did wrong to him; whether I should give up. I thought along these lines..

16
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:18,124
But even though I'm sorry towards Ji-ahn..

17
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:29,329
Liking you is another matter.

18
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:42,370
I like you...alot

19
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:09,572
The coffee really tastes great

20
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:49,727
Where did you go to at such a late hour?

21
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,021
Oh, my friend came by.

22
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:58,995
There must be a message in your handphone as it kept ringing non-stop.

23
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:09,549
[two unanswered calls, Ryu Ji-ahn]

24
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:38,148
No.. No..

25
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:41,204
Please don't.. Don't..

26
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:20,126
I also have times when I lived and died like that.

27
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:41,412
I'll be delivering the vegetables here from today onwards.

28
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:48,731
These are 50 thousand wons in total.

29
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:52,437
They are a bit more expensive.

30
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:54,582
But aren't you an angel?

31
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:05,042
Put that in credit and I'll collect it later.

32
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:17,519
Right, do you still remember who I am?

33
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:24,048
You still remember.

34
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,695
I'll still be firing in my heart if you don't remember.

35
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,116
Thanks for remembering me.

36
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,914
We'll be meeting often from now on, Ahjuma.

37
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:09,515
Ji-ahn, sorry.

38
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,913
I'm really sorry.

39
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:15,876
Besides these words..

40
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,391
No.. No..

41
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:33,394
No matter what happens, you will still be my closest friend.

42
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:44,670
There are a lot of differences between the displays for this time
compared to the plans last time.

43
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:48,643
But the responses from customers were very good.

44
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,508
Although I was the one who built it, there were a lot of modifications made to it.

45
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:56,265
You seem to have a call. Just answer it.

46
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:57,276
Yes.

47
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,601
[Min-ho]

48
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,347
It wasn't an important call.

49
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:21,133
Hello..

50
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:23,363
Wait a minute..

51
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:28,019
Take it, quickly.

52
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:30,663
It's Min-ho.

53
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:39,908
Yes, it's me.

54
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:41,771
What happened?

55
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:45,036
Min-ho and Soo-hee are together.

56
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:51,240
Have.. you eaten?

57
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:54,849
Yes, just something simple.

58
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,890
I didn't go to Granny's place. I just ate noodles.

59
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,429
I know.. I've eaten..

60
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:08,513
What about you?

61
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,930
I've eaten too.

62
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:15,191
Unni, they will be talking about eating meals the whole day.

63
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:16,913
That's true.

64
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,664
Oh, I'm at Young-suk Unni's place.

65
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,010
Is that so?

66
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,283
Then, I'll be able to see you when I finish my work at the cafe later tonight.

67
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,191
OK, we'll meet at that time.

68
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,548
Is your heart still uneasy because of Ji-ahn?

69
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:01,242
Of course she will be uneasy.

70
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:07,337
How can she feel comfortable after betraying?
Then, wouldn't she be considered a swindler?

71
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,115
Unni, are you only able to say such words?

72
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:14,232
Don't you speak to me in that respective way.
It'll make me angrier if you talk to me in the respective form.

73
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:17,801
Chung Soo-hee..

74
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:21,002
Although betrayal isn't pleasant..

75
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,311
You can't do anything about it either since your heart has already changed.

76
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:26,051
Since you're already left with no way out..

77
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:29,071
You can't say that you didn't have a change of heart,
and then immediately forget about those feelings.

78
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:34,525
If Ji-ahn won't leave you alone,
you'll just have to say to him, "I'm a bad woman"..

79
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:36,270
"So why are you treating me like this?"

80
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:38,226
Don't try to explain about this or that.

81
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,053
Just say that it's all your fault.

82
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,141
And also, when you're together with Min-ho..

83
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:46,856
Don't ever think of Ji-ahn in your heart.

84
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,557
When you are together with Min-ho..

85
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:51,988
You must face him with a smile.

86
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:56,892
Don't, because you feel guilty towards Ji-ahn, become unable to smile nor love.

87
00:11:57,343 --> 00:12:00,671
That's really unfair towards both Min-ho and you.

88
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:07,314
You suddenly became so adorable.

89
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,226
How can such an abnormal woman be so adorable?

90
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:11,390
Who said I'm not?

91
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:14,993
It's like this..

92
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:16,424
You must smile when there are things to be happy about.

93
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:19,528
Don't look like you're attending a funeral. You look much prettier when you smile.

94
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,678
You are really too adorable today.

95
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,952
Why do I feel like you've been scolding me?

96
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:39,663
Where are you going to?

97
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:43,281
We are going to trail and investigate for evidence of Oh Young-suk's husband having an affair.

98
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:45,631
You're speaking like you're a cop.

99
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,584
That was my dream when I was young.

100
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,770
That dream is really glaring to the eyes now.

101
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,011
Boss, please give me some money.

102
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:55,842
What for?

103
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:57,995
There is a girl that he is buying clothes for.

104
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:01,959
Rascal, why must you always date those types of girls?

105
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:06,034
Didn't I warn you before, rascal?
Those girls that will make you buy clothes, gold and diamonds..

106
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,400
Do I allow you to meet such girls or not?

107
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:09,027
You don't allow me to meet them, sir.

108
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:12,115
You are going to turn 30 soon, but why are you still so immature?

109
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:18,077
Didn't I tell you that those princesses who thinks that men earn money easily are worth nothing?

110
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,623
Us men must not bother with those women who can only ask for things.

111
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,302
These types of women will eventually leave those guys who keeps giving them things.

112
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:27,049
Rascal, are your ears deaf or..

113
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:31,041
Why must those women leave if the guy keeps giving them things?

114
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:34,369
Who spends money on others for free?

115
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,928
Would guys buy things for girls if they didn't want something in return?
They must be thinking of taking advantage of the girl.

116
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,183
You, break up with that girl immediately.

117
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:47,619
Rascal. Why don't you have a better eye for girls?

118
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:49,817
Take care, Boss.

119
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:50,405
Take care.

120
00:13:57,987 --> 00:14:00,791
Since when did Boss spend his money on girls?

121
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,406
You think that I don't know that the Sky cafe shop was opened by Boss?

122
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:08,866
He opened the shop for the girl, bought her car and even paid for her hospital bills.

123
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,664
If you don't shut up your dirty mouth..

124
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,898
If you don't shut up your dirty mouth..

125
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:17,139
When did this patient leave the hospital?

126
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,222
She left during the afternoon.

127
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,031
She insisted on leaving even after the doctor said she couldn't.

128
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:25,619
Did she leave behind any messages?

129
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:27,859
I don't know.

130
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,656
<i>I'm begging you to wake up.</i>

131
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:49,412
<i>We only slept together for one night.</i>

132
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:56,632
She's lying.

133
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,019
I came to find you because..

134
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:40,743
We can't carry on living as strangers with no connections.

135
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,961
Why aren't you coming home?

136
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:53,486
Why did a gentle and sensible child suddenly..

137
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,789
From your childhood until now..

138
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:05,671
Because of the profession you chose..

139
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:10,476
The opposition of your marriage to your wife..

140
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,824
Are you still angry till now?

141
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:19,796
No matter what, just talk to me.

142
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,745
Don't just stay silent and not speak.

143
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:36,721
I know about the relationship between Driver Park and mom.

144
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:41,141
I also know how Min-ho was born.

145
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:49,323
Now can you understand why I am so unwilling to see you?

146
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:56,398
I don't feel that I have to say sorry.

147
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:03,286
It's better...to have you live with this guilt.

148
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:10,815
Does Min-ho..

149
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:15,816
Know about that too?

150
00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:19,245
Yes..

151
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,019
You are only worried for Min-ho, right?

152
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:34,652
That's right, it has always been like that.

153

[Manager Ryu Ji-ahn]

155
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,024
That's right, did you look at it closely?

156
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:25,940
I have only made copies of the proposals for the company's developing plans.

157
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:31,942
That's good. Go back first and give me those documents tomorrow.

158
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,914
Next week too, don't forget to do the same thing.

159
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:39,910
Stop in front of the gallery for a while.

160

00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:49,910
What? You want to leave our home?

162
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,120
I want to be independent.

163
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:56,411
Why? Are your parents coming back from Canada?

164
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:58,660
It's not that.

165
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:01,547
Then, have your parents give me a call.

166
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,989
It's ok even if I have to go to Canada to meet them.

167
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:13,834
But your parents went over there to observe and emulate teaching..

168
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,584
Aren't they over there for too long?

169
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:21,134
They've already become professors.

170
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,869
That's really good.

171
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:29,393
Right, didn't you say that you still have a sister in your old hometown?

172
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:31,354
Are you often in contact?

173
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,115
Her husband has been stationed overseas for work.

174
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:37,715
She has already taken my nephew over there with her.

175
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:48,599
There's no one else besides you who can take over the company later.

176
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,593
So don't speak of leaving again.

177
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:54,972
I have no confidence to take over the company.

178
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:57,457
I'm not asking you to take over immediately.

179
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,939
Uncle, why do you trust me so much?

180
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:09,815
Even with suspicions after suspicions, an answer appeared to let me trust you.
What else can I do besides trusting you?

181
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:16,178
You must know you have the abilities.

182
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:23,116
It's not a bad thing for a guy your age to boost about your abilities.

183
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:29,486
Yes, she should be here already.

184
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:30,945
Follow me.

185
00:21:47,324 --> 00:21:49,360
How did you know that Aunty would be here?

186
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:55,986
I got to know about her schedules after trailing her a few times.

187
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:00,422
Why must you follow Aunty?

188
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:06,406
Because I wanted to see her.

189
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:13,841
Although I may get to see her at home, our expressions are always bad.

190
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:16,240
Isn't that funny?

191
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,698
Sometimes, people are just unable to communicate to one another.

192
00:22:26,964 --> 00:22:27,876
Uncle..

193
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:34,822
The girl that I've been with has already got someone else.

194
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:38,444
But I'm unable to let go.

195
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,416
Then try putting in an effort.

196
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:43,486
I don't want to.

197
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:49,510
Then, you can only wait.

198
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:58,811
Just wait and see who will win.

199
00:23:29,002 --> 00:23:30,307
Have you eaten?

200
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,611
I've already said twice that I've eaten.

201
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:39,228
Oh...that's right.

202
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:44,853
Forget about sending me home next time.

203
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,241
It's too tiring for you.

204
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:48,942
I'm fine!

205
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:07,977
Don't try to let go.

206
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:12,925
It took me a lot to work up the courage to do this.

207
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:51,420
<i>Let's meet tomorow. I'll give you a call.</i>

208
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,425
[They should have arrested you. Why are they taking dad away?!]

209
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:02,099
Will you be finishing up your artwork soon?

210
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:05,555
Yes..

211
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:24,678
Why? Don't you like me anymore?

212
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:29,266
Where did I go wrong?

213
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:37,123
Can you tell me why we became like this?

214
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:45,406
I'm sorry, I can't.

215
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:55,075
You are not at fault. It's me who changed.

216
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:59,280
I tried to search for a reason.

217
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:02,900
I just couldn't figure it out either.

218
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:07,778
The problem lies in my heart.

219
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:10,945
There was nothing else wrong between us.

220
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,104
I thought there was something that you knew.

221
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:19,370
But unknown to me.

222
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:23,822
Some mistake that I made.

223
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:34,601
Maybe it's because my feelings aren't sincere enough.

224
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:45,332
Or because you got tired of me.

225
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:51,609
Or because I neglected you, choosing work instead.

226
00:29:54,138 --> 00:29:56,385
I wanted to tell you that I'll change all of that.

227
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:05,219
I'm really...sorry.

228
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:15,431
We have been together for a very long time, right?

229
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:22,245
But, Soo-hee..

230
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:32,758
You and I, it's a start for us.

231
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:42,602
But for Min-ho and you..

232
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:50,703
How do you expect me to face you two?

233
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:21,819
<i>Min-ho, I can't meet with you today.</i>

234
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,594
<i>I'll contact you again later.</i>

235
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:44,939
Hey, these pictures are really too much.

236
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,537
The woman living next door will be fainting for sure.

237
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,138
Boss, go and give these to her.

238
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,297
No, you go.

239
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:56,304
Mu-do, how many packets of noodles did you cook today?

240
00:31:58,538 --> 00:32:02,254
Rascal, you still cooked four packets.

241
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:12,560
Hey, don't finish all of it. Just eat half only.

242
00:32:15,948 --> 00:32:17,616
He's controling even when it comes to food.

243
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:21,589
Boss says it's because he has my interests at heart.

244
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:26,362
Hey, don't tell them I ate it all.

245
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,802
You didn't even clean up after finishing your meal in the morning.

246
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,122
Girl, how can be you like this?

247
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:37,172
Why don't you just finish saying what you were going to say?

248
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:39,239
Is Young-suk Unni's husband really having an affair?

249
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,147
It's not an affair. They have been together for some time.

250
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,069
That's what I said. Really..

251
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:48,261
So just pretend that you didn't know.

252
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:51,429
Where is she meeting Sin-ji?

253
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,735
The cafe beside the bakery.

254
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:59,857
Hey, Little Dot! Little Dot, you!

255
00:33:00,658 --> 00:33:03,177
The apartment is where he has been living with that woman.

256
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:07,851
The reason he went to a lawyer was to file for divorce.

257
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:12,456
He says that you have mental problems.

258
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:14,863
These are the results of our investigation.

259
00:33:24,341 --> 00:33:26,208
You've worked hard.

260
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:43,035
I came here because I'm worried about you.

261
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,849
I've heard about it. Are you alright?

262
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:53,357
What are you going to do about it?

263
00:33:54,818 --> 00:33:56,268
Get a divorce I guess.

264
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:03,277
Anyway, don't think about anything.
Just go to your mother's place and have a good rest there.

265
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:06,512
And also, have your mom make you something nice to eat.

266
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:07,985
And cry all you want.

267
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:09,526
Let out your temper.

268
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:10,548
Ok..

269
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:17,101
You don't have a mom?

270
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:22,134
Unni..

271
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:43,364
Granny, I'm bad right?

272
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,392
I snatched away my best friend's girlfriend.

273
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:55,667
Granny, during high school..

274
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:59,176
Ji-ahn and his friend set up a trap for me.

275
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:00,775
And so, I was forced to leave school.

276
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:03,630
That was when I realized I was being used.

277
00:35:04,524 --> 00:35:07,098
I then went searching for Granny.

278
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:10,344
Crying and saying that I must take revenge.

279
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,878
Do you still remember?

280
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,289
That's not the reason why I'm with Soo-hee though.

281
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:27,532
Because after that incident, I got to know a lot of things about Ji-ahn.

282
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,644
And I was able to understand why he did what he did.

283
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:37,035
I told you before. Do you remember?

284
00:35:56,497 --> 00:36:11,032
If Ji-ahn, Soo-hee, and everyone else in the world misunderstands me later.

285
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:16,081
Granny must still be able to understand my heart.

286
00:36:56,706 --> 00:36:59,570
[He's ashame because of his parents.]

287
00:37:37,362 --> 00:37:38,757
We haven't met in awhile.

288
00:37:41,704 --> 00:37:43,247
What are you doing here?

289
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,500
Who let you come to the school to find me?

290
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:49,633
You're being too loud, you should lower voice a bit.

291
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:52,497
I'll give you 5 minutes to explain to me the matter at hand.

292
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:54,382
What are you talking about?

293
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:15,544
This woman is the assistant professor.

294
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:19,231
Because of the pain I was going through due to all our problems..

295
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,703
It was a mistake I made after drinking too much.

296
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:25,113
Then you could have told her it was a mistake after having awoke from your drunken state.

297
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:27,370
But why have you been with her for some time now?

298
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,881
This wasn't your first time with this woman.

299
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:32,346
Do you think that I'm unaware of this?

300
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:38,178
Go to the woman and tell her that it was also a mistake for you to have met your children's mother.

301
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:41,568
Why must you live like this?

302
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:44,852
Why must you always be living among your mistakes?

303
00:38:51,711 --> 00:38:55,934
I heard that you went to the lawyers saying that I have mental problems.

304
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,225
And so, I wouldn't be able to manage neither the properties nor the children.

305
00:39:00,248 --> 00:39:02,290
And you will be getting everything.

306
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:03,780
Honey..

307
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:11,757
You're a real jerk.

308
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:15,215
When I was slapped by you for lying..

309
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,136
As I was kneeling on the floor begging you..

310
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:23,247
This was also what you said to me when you slapped me.

311
00:39:23,587 --> 00:39:24,916
Do you still remember?

312
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:31,269
The children stays with me.

313
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,262
If you transfer the house at Sam Cheon Dong to my name..

314
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:46,728
This meeting will be the last between us.

315
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,545
It's still better to end it by saying sorry.
No need to ruin one another over this, right?

316
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,805
You've really disappointed me.

317
00:40:13,803 --> 00:40:18,455
Why don't I have any tears, when others in this situation would be crying right now?

318
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,098
Have all my tears dried up?

319
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,830
Just tell me.

320
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:30,831
Are men really like Young-suk Unni's husband?
They are not satisfied with just one woman?

321
00:40:31,426 --> 00:40:32,894
Maybe..

322
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:37,046
Mister, too? Is Mister like that too?

323
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:39,056
How can I say?

324
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:41,059
Maybe I am like that.

325
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:51,977
In Mister's heart.. Do you have me in here?

326
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,757
How can you be here when you are in front of me?

327
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:59,794
There are only internal organs, spleen and liver...those things in here.

328
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,684
Shouldn't you know about these things since you went to a university before?

329
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:05,708
Move to one side if you're not watching the programme.
Stop distracting me from watching.

330
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,445
What are you doing?

331
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:11,050
Do you love me?

332
00:41:11,076 --> 00:41:12,070
What's love?

333
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:16,171
Again... You are starting with this again.

334
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:19,439
You can't live if you don't see me.
You feel really happy when you do get to see me.

335
00:41:19,856 --> 00:41:21,951
There's no one in this world as pretty as me.

336
00:41:22,468 --> 00:41:24,768
You would do anything for me. Isn't that so?

337
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:29,034
Can I speak honestly?

338
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,449
Speak..

339
00:41:34,312 --> 00:41:37,810
Before I met you, I lived 37 years without you.

340
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,025
So, will I be unable to live without you?

341
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:41,688
I'll be able to live as long as someone gives me rice.

342
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:44,857
And also, it's good that I met you.

343
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:48,529
Good is good enough. So, why must it be so good that I must die?

344
00:41:48,676 --> 00:41:50,978
And also, I can't be doing everything just for you.

345
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:53,274
You know about my temper as well.

346
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:56,570
I'm already angry that I have to cook and wash for you.

347
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:05,279
Really, I'm so unfortunate.

348
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,282
I rejected the young ones, the ones that liked me.

349
00:42:08,357 --> 00:42:10,719
And instead, found an old fellow to suffer like this for.

350
00:42:11,754 --> 00:42:13,947
It's not too late now, just leave.

351
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:15,845
Then, leave?

352
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:17,875
Yes, leave.

353
00:42:24,615 --> 00:42:26,011
Kiss me, Mister.

354
00:42:29,688 --> 00:42:30,504
Ok.

355
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:34,760
Oh, fine!

356
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,174
Let's go out and eat this time.

357
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:42,300
How can such a thin and tiny hand be so forceful?

358
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:43,814
So painful.

359
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:59,686
Hey, what are you looking at?

360
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,508
If I were to say let's get married, will you agree?

361
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:09,142
I already said that life is a path to walk on alone.

362
00:43:09,143 --> 00:43:10,786
I don't want to put my stakes on any woman.

363
00:43:10,787 --> 00:43:14,753
We meet when we feel good, we won't when don't.
We've always been like this, right?

364
00:43:20,795 --> 00:43:24,638
I have always wanted to wear a wedding dress since I was young.

365
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,174
If Mister don't like it, I don't like it as well.

366
00:43:30,364 --> 00:43:33,560
Let's not marry, let's go.

367
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:34,776
Hey, Choi Mi-ri..

368
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:36,751
What?

369
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,060
Do you really like me?

370
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:54,829
Just as big as the skies, just as big as the earth.

371
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:56,380
Let's go.

372
00:44:05,637 --> 00:44:08,048
Do you really like me?

373
00:44:10,259 --> 00:44:15,840
Rascal. Isn't it like you to see one guy today..
And then another guy the next day?

374
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:20,454
You fall for a guy when he treats you a little better, then forget about him when he doesn't.


375
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:22,407
Isn't this how you are? What's with you?

376
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:24,401
So why are you making such a fuss?

377
00:44:24,402 --> 00:44:28,911
I'm like this, no matter how good they are.

378
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:31,996
Choi Mi-ri! Choi Mi-ri!

379
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:03,274
I'm sorry, Ji-ahn.

380
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,439
I want to be with Soo-hee.

381
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:16,280
I didn't want it to be like this either.

382
00:45:17,754 --> 00:45:20,528
As a man, to turn back on my orginal words.

383
00:45:20,566 --> 00:45:24,300
I was really unwillingly as well.

384
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:28,671
But it turned out like this.

385
00:45:30,953 --> 00:45:32,784
Please scold me, friend.

386
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:39,381
Be together with Soo-hee.

387
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:46,283
The two people that I love the most..

388
00:45:50,036 --> 00:45:53,824
It's the only way that I won't be losing either of you.

389
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:00,839
But, Min-ho..

390
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:09,007
You told me once,

391
00:46:12,444 --> 00:46:20,775
When I said that if there was one person in the world that would just understand me..

392
00:46:20,972 --> 00:46:22,911
I'll understand you.

393
00:46:25,005 --> 00:46:28,503
I said it like that. I still remember.

394
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:37,365
Then, do you have the confidence to honor your words?

395
00:46:38,444 --> 00:46:39,966
Yes..

396
00:46:48,447 --> 00:46:50,368
Kim Min-ho..

397
00:46:51,964 --> 00:46:54,049
This is your weak point.

398
00:46:56,333 --> 00:47:00,865
You answered a very difficult question too easily.

399
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,182
Will you be alright going back alone?

400
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:33,223
Min-ho, can we be like how we were before?

401
00:47:33,224 --> 00:47:39,090
Can we smile and chat when we meet?

402
00:47:47,773 --> 00:47:49,568
After a period time..

403
00:47:52,087 --> 00:47:56,710
That's right, after a period of time.

404
00:48:02,244 --> 00:48:09,571
There will be no other way if we can't by then, right?

405
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,168
Min-ho!

406
00:48:51,864 --> 00:48:55,289
Mom is going to stay here for the night.

407
00:48:57,915 --> 00:48:59,914
The place is like a pigsty, isn't it?

408
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:03,153
I tidy it daily, but it still ends up like this.

409
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:05,611
So I was quite messy to begin with, right?

410
00:49:05,973 --> 00:49:09,363
Also, I still get to use the whipping cloth every week.

411
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:12,001
I'm a bit more stronger than when I was living with mom.

412
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:13,705
Isn't it so?

413
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:19,354
Are you tired?

414
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:25,922
It'll be uncomfortable if you sleep here

415
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:28,080
Just drink a cup of tea and return home to sleep.

416
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:30,905
I told your dad that I was coming to your place.

417
00:49:31,463 --> 00:49:33,966
I'm going to stay overnight before returning.

418
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,695
Mom is really tired.

419
00:49:37,696 --> 00:49:40,104
Just let me rest here first for a while.

420
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:55,220
If you want to sleep, then you should change your clothes first.
Change your clothes.

421
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:04,800
I'm too embarrasssed. Mom, change it yourself.

422
00:50:06,682 --> 00:50:09,879
Wear this, ok? I'll go out and wait for you.

423
00:53:14,655 --> 00:53:17,103
You like children, just like before.

424
00:53:18,183 --> 00:53:21,464
You are going to con her over, and then give her pain.

425
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,891
Don't ever live like that.

426
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,276
Give me rice.

427
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:49,943
Hyung, you don't seem to be feeling good today.

428
00:53:52,074 --> 00:53:53,144
Why?

429
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:54,713
What why?

430
00:53:54,714 --> 00:53:58,471
It's because I didn't listen to him to eat at home.
I wanted to eat at Granny's. That's why he's angry.

431
00:53:59,118 --> 00:54:06,939
Anyway, these people all know about our relationship.
It's not like we're having an affair. Must two people always stay at home everyday?

432
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:10,551
We have to sneak out every time to go out at night.

433
00:54:10,569 --> 00:54:12,285
Anyway, his behavior is really strange.

434
00:54:12,345 --> 00:54:15,741
Then why do you keep seeing such a person? Just break up.

435
00:54:16,314 --> 00:54:20,302
The only reason why men hide their women, not letting them meet anyone is..

436
00:54:20,616 --> 00:54:25,979
"Anyway, I'm going to break up with that woman." When they are thinking this way.
"Why must I introduce her to people?"

437
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:28,352
Is it really like that?

438
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:30,333
How can it be really like that?

439
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:31,697
I just don't like it.

440
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:37,214
The person on that side.

441
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:40,338
Don't bother about other people's business. That's really too ill-mannered.

442
00:54:41,313 --> 00:54:42,618
We seem to be the same age.

443
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:44,471
How old are you?

444
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:46,138
Year '60.

445
00:54:46,247 --> 00:54:47,588
The same as me.

446
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:50,065
So I can shorten my words.

447
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,240
I don't quarrel with women.

448
00:54:59,241 --> 00:55:01,720
Then are you speaking in the respective form?

449
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:04,767
Then you have to add in "YAO" when you are speaking in the respective form.

450
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,954
"You don't quarrel YAO", like this.

451
00:55:07,193 --> 00:55:10,057
You didn't study too much, did you?

452
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,543
Granny, give me rice quickly. I have to leave fast.

453
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:23,310
I'm leaving.

454
00:55:24,293 --> 00:55:30,547
Hey. We all ate together, yet you are only paying for you and your lover?

455
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,311
Don't be such a cheapskate. Take out another 5000 won.

456
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:35,637
I got it.

457
00:55:36,614 --> 00:55:39,668
Just take it back. I'll be paying for the both of you.

458
00:55:40,435 --> 00:55:42,864
Thanks, Unni.

459
00:55:43,307 --> 00:55:46,805
Kang Ho-chul, your temper is really a lot better.

460
00:55:47,816 --> 00:55:49,248
Hyung!

461
00:55:49,256 --> 00:55:51,159
Really great! Really great!

462
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,267
The pride of the chauvinist being crushed. You don't know how happy I feel.

463
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,535
It's great.

464
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:00,183
Stop laughing. What's so good about Hyung being angry?

465
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:03,347
He's been bullying me daily. Finally today, there's someone who punishes him on my behalf. So..

466
00:56:04,644 --> 00:56:09,882
Unni, you've been in gangs before right?

467
00:56:10,064 --> 00:56:11,638
You're a hooligan, right?

468
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:13,493
I just figure these things.

469
00:56:13,836 --> 00:56:15,014
Don't lie..

470
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:19,282
Where did Unni mix around before? Kang Nam? A Gu Je?

471
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:21,227
That time, we.. at middle road..

472
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:23,717
Although the generation is different.

473
00:56:23,718 --> 00:56:25,120
But you are hooligans for every generations.

474
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,586
This is really funny.

475
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:30,722
I'll eat it well for sure, Granny.

476
00:56:30,723 --> 00:56:32,095
I'm off.

477
00:56:32,553 --> 00:56:34,704
Have a happy time with your mom, ok?

478
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,573
His mom came?

479
00:56:38,588 --> 00:56:41,108
Don't bother about other people's business.

480
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:44,963
Unni, I become dense whenever I see you.

481
00:56:45,018 --> 00:56:47,138
Which exactly is the real you?

482
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:53,853
You have lots of money. Your mind processes very quickly.
And you seem like you'd be really good in your studies.

483
00:56:54,785 --> 00:56:57,277
You didn't study at the University and you refuse to say anything about your family.

484
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,981
Unni, why?

485
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,538
Just eat your rice.

486
00:57:19,317 --> 00:57:22,553
Here you go. The coffee is being delivered this time.

487
00:57:23,095 --> 00:57:26,980
I made it really hot because of how cold it is today. Blow on it while you drink.

488
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,841
It's good.

489
00:57:34,385 --> 00:57:35,763
Min-ho..

490
00:57:36,562 --> 00:57:40,682
Don't speak if you are going to ask me to come home. I won't go back.

491
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,018
Yes, hello..

492
00:57:51,195 --> 00:57:57,396
I'm giving you a call because I was curious why you haven't contacted me.

493
00:57:58,112 --> 00:57:59,653
I'll go over after a while.

494
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,770
It's not convenient to answer the phone right now.

495
00:58:05,336 --> 00:58:11,409
One hour later.. Ok, end of call.

496
00:58:12,605 --> 00:58:13,747
Who is it?

497
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:15,838
The woman that I like.

498
00:58:18,314 --> 00:58:20,761
A woman that you are going to marry?

499
00:58:22,642 --> 00:58:24,744
It's just the woman that I like.

500
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:26,578
I'm not thinking of marriage.

501
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:27,872
Why?

502
00:58:29,603 --> 00:58:32,685
I'm not interested. I want to live my own life.

503
00:58:36,485 --> 00:58:42,449
Are you not interested in marriage after seeing how your mom led her life?

504
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:48,112
Not everyone lives their life like your mom.

505
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:51,387
This is a bit strange. What's wrong?

506
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:56,097
I met your brother.

507
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:03,818
You.. Know about mom and Driver Park's...

508
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:05,549
Don't say it.

509
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:10,090
I don't know what you want to tell me, but I don't want to hear it.

510
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:14,226
I think that it's a good thing as well for you to know everything.

511
00:59:14,523 --> 00:59:17,423
One of these days, I have to bring your real father..

512
00:59:17,424 --> 00:59:18,475
I should be going.

513
00:59:18,476 --> 00:59:21,329
Min-ho, mom at that time..

514
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:22,803
Stop it!

515
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:26,545
Mom, too... Hyung, too...

516
00:59:26,546 --> 00:59:28,516
Why are you so selfish?!

517
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:32,420
Why must you say it when I'm still not prepared to hear it?!

518
00:59:32,537 --> 00:59:34,400
I said that I'm not prepared to listen!

519
00:59:34,594 --> 00:59:35,718
Min-ho..

520
00:59:35,828 --> 00:59:37,641
That's right.. I know..

521
00:59:37,745 --> 00:59:40,119
I'm not dad's son, I know that too!

522
00:59:40,223 --> 00:59:42,065
That's why I told you not to bother about me!

523
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:45,666
I don't want to listen! There's no need to say!

524
00:59:46,677 --> 00:59:48,036
Sorry..

525
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:55,302
Why can't you just stay at home? Why must you go out everyday?!

526
00:59:57,224 --> 00:59:59,490
Are you like this because you can't forget about that man?

527
00:59:59,491 --> 01:00:02,409
How can I forget him? He's your dad.

528
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:06,781
Min-ho, I don't care about the others.

529
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:10,592
But I hope that you don't misunderstand your real father.

530
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:16,401
From now on, don't mention that man in front of me.

531
01:00:17,634 --> 01:00:18,742
Can you do that?

532
01:00:20,147 --> 01:00:21,507
Min-ho..

533
01:00:24,903 --> 01:00:26,662
You can't do it.

534
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:30,987
So that person is more important than me.

535
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:44,583
Hyung, too.. Me, too..
How much longer do we have to be abandoned by mom?

536
01:00:45,325 --> 01:00:48,642
10 years.. 20 years.. 30 years..?!

537
01:00:57,545 --> 01:01:02,548
Mom, you said it in front of your children..

538
01:01:02,971 --> 01:01:05,653
That you love that man more than your children.

539
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,421
That's really unacceptable.

540
01:01:51,904 --> 01:01:53,100
Hello..

541
01:01:55,758 --> 01:01:59,383
Take care and eat more..

542
01:02:55,357 --> 01:02:57,098
Why did you bring flowers?

543
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:02,554
I came out when I thought you would be getting here.

544
01:03:20,598 --> 01:03:24,930
For someone who is abandoned by his dad and mom, I wanted love.

545
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:28,079
I really want it, too.

546
01:03:29,602 --> 01:03:31,306
But, Soo-hee..

547
01:03:33,379 --> 01:03:35,825
Even if I was abandoned at that time..

548
01:03:37,678 --> 01:03:40,886
I want to put in my effort to love you till the day I get abandoned.

549
01:03:43,577 --> 01:03:45,535
Let's go out and play.
