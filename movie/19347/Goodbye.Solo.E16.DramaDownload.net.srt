Final Episode

2
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:56,381
<i>The one thing you can’t be calm about is Ji-ahn?</i>

3
00:00:56,882 --> 00:00:59,046
<i>Then I’ll tell you mine.</i>

4
00:00:59,148 --> 00:01:00,878
<i>Min-ho.</i>

5
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:03,660
<i>Right now, I don’t understand you.</i>

6
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:08,693
<i>I won’t understand Ji-ahn anymore, even though he gets everything.</i>

7
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:09,914
<i>That’s my one thing.</i>

8
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:12,198
<i>Do you know?</i>

9
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:23,351
Hello?

10
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:26,995
I already knew you were amazing, but...

11
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:30,945
now that I think of yesterday, you really are amazing.

12
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:38,639
Even though he’s lying there hurt, you’re not over-reacting, but just taking good care of him.

13
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:40,289
You’re cool.

14
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,701
In my heart, I'm already prepared for a time when he would get hurt like this.

15
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:50,269
Over and over again.

16
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:56,615
Although it’s been some time since I’ve met him, I’m not completely clueless about him.

17
00:01:57,106 --> 00:02:05,787
So I thought that when the time comes, I have to be cool and halt my tears.

18
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,769
But, yesterday, I cried a lot.

19
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:20,380
I’m thankful that you’re here for me, buddy.

20
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:23,902
Mi-ri...

21
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:27,172
This weekend, I’m leaving.

22
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:32,223
Because of Granny’s problem, you don’t like being here?

23
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:34,174
Why are you going so suddenly?

24
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,921
Although Granny’s problem is a sad one,

25
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,329
She chose it herself.

26
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:43,923
If she closes her mouth, her daughter will be free.

27
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:47,356
Since she hasn't talked for over 30 years, you'd think she would talk now?

28
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,112
I wouldn’t either.

29
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:53,929
Who wouldn’t understand Granny?

30
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,159
It’s not because of that.

31
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:58,546
Then, why is that?

32
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:13,666
I'm really really unlucky.

33
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:19,263
I threw away the trash but then I got yelled at.

34
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:23,039
Sorry, unni.

35
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:26,855
Do you really have to do that with Ji-ahn?

36
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,142
I can’t be so cold to him.

37
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,180
Of course, you guys still have friendship and he’s just telling you to do it for a show,

38
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,907
and not for real, it is hard to not accept…

39
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:49,664
I understand because it’s not my problem.

40
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:53,543
But, for Min-ho, it’s not going to be easy for him to understand.

41
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:58,508
Well, I wonder if it’s you who can accept that.

42
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,461
There’s a lot of food.

43
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:09,103
What’s with your face?

44
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:11,238
Did something happen between you and Min-ho?

45
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:15,950
Soo-hee, that girl to that guy, Ji-ahn…

46
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:19,146
It’s okay, I don’t want to talk about it.

47
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:23,351
But, why did you come to the bathroom when you can just do it lying down?

48
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,681
Well, I’ve already shown you my body, do I have to show it again while doing my business?

49
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,899
But, you still wanted to show off your form!

50
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,882
I don’t have parents neither much money.

51
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,705
My hand is hurt too.

52
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:50,304
Other boyfriends would tell their girlfriends, “Go well. Live well with another man.”

53
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:52,387
But, I won’t beg.

54
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:57,415
Although I'm being selfish, I wish you were by my side.

55
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:03,160
It makes me so mad, what am I to do now?

56
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,705
If you have to be mad, you should be mad.

57
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,409
And how is hanging onto your girlfriend selfish?

58
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:12,946
Just putting on a show and saying goodbye,

59
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:19,163
later drinking beer and wondering why they did that, I really hate those kinds of men.

60
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:25,465
When I first met you, I was only going to date you for only three months and end it.

61
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:27,938
Oh.. so you only saw me for three months?

62
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:31,302
Three months are plenty enough time for me, kiddo!

63
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,128
A girl I thought that wouldn’t last for a month, follows me around,

64
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:39,788
at first I thought you were stupid or even a brat.

65
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,774
But since you’ve met me, I’m the best!

66
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:50,755
Now, what do we live off of?

67
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:55,582
Would they really push away an empty mouth?

68
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:58,497
My father’s words.

69
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:09,014
Ah…the spring winds are really good.

70
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:35,249
Say anything at least to me.

71
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,206
You’re scaring me by not saying anything.

72
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:52,578
So with Ji-ahn, when are you doing it?

73
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:57,266
Next Monday.

74
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:01,624
I’m going this weekend.

75
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,829
Min-ho

76
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,181
Just this once.

77
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,635
One more time please understand me.

78
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:12,857
I know your holding a lot in.

79
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:23,126
I know that you’ve always been holding in and understanding me, Ji-ahn and the rest of the people.

80
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,102
But just this once,

81
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,629
One more time understand me.

82
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,760
Soo-hee.

83
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:39,823
I’m using rudeness, disrespect,

84
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,861
I can do it for you but won’t.

85
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,539
Right?

86
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,345
That’s right.

87
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:51,098
I know I’m doing that.

88
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,696
But...

89
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:57,340
I don’t know either.

90
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,115
Why I am doing that?

91
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:05,189
Just thinking about Soo-hee and Kim Min-ho, what would make it hard?

92
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,494
I think that.

93
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:12,690
But, my heart...

94
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,084
Hates it.

95
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:19,681
I want to forget about everything else.

96
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,994
I want to do as I want.

97
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:28,982
Why do I have to be second in Soo-hee’s life?

98
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:36,524
I’m not anyone else, but why do I have to be Soo-hee’s second man?

99
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,048
I don’t understand.

100
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:42,763
It’s not like that, Min-ho.

101
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:45,206
It’s just because of the situation.

102
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:46,909
I love you.

103
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:54,267
You know how happy I was about leaving.

104
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:59,589
But you, how could you do this to me?

105
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,545
Right now, you...

106
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:05,446
Are the one who makes me hurt the most.

107
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:08,882
I know.

108
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:13,671
You can provoke me because I can’t understand you.

109
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,626
I, no matter what, need this.

110
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:18,389
Min-ho...

111
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:19,960
Please.

112
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,112
Just don’t say that it’s the end.

113
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,484
To the end…to the end...

114
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:36,853
You’re not losing to me.

115
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:39,868
Okay, you’re worthy.

116
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,355
I’m sorry.

117
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:45,918
And I beg you...

118
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:51,994
If I can’t leave with you, go to the place we promised.

119
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:53,676
Then, I’ll go find you.

120
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:57,089
I’ll find you, just please go to the place we promised.

121
00:09:57,154 --> 00:10:01,247
That favor is too big, to meet as fate desired.

122
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:07,344
To organize you in my heart,
I haven’t decided where to go yet.

123
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,423
Is it inside or outside?

124
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:11,871
Then just tell me that.

125
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,745
It’s not because we hate each other,

126
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:28,493
But because we have different thoughts that people separate.

127
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:30,577
I’m learning a lot.

128
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:32,313
Min-ho...

129
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:34,710
Don’t talk like that.

130
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:36,948
Don’t say that it’s the end.

131
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,768
I really hate you.

132
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:57,299
Min-ho, don’t be like this!

133
00:10:57,468 --> 00:11:00,023
Don’t be like this!

134
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:17,235
<i>Granny…</i>

135
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:19,863
<i>It’s weird.</i>

136
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:23,525
<i>My mind and heart are different now.</i>

137
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,913
<i>My heart wants to give into Soo-hee, but</i>

138
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:29,166
<i>My body won’t listen.</i>

139
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,238
<i>I can’t stop myself.</i>

140
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,605
<i>It’s like it’s broken.</i>

141
00:13:11,118 --> 00:13:12,981
Granny’s not talking at all.

142
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,123
It’s going to be hard.

143
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:16,696
I told you that she’s stubborn.

144
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:18,339
Prepare your heart.

145
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:19,910
It’s not easy.

146
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,321
Okay then, see you again.

147
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,216
Hyung, you’re already out of the hospital?

148
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:12,021
Yeah, since I was laying in the hospital for so long, my body is tense.

149
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:15,888
I just need mycillin, so why stay in such an expensive hospital?

150
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:19,950
What is mycillin, mycillin? It’s antibiotics.

151
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:21,314
Hey, punk!

152
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,668
Is saying mycillin so wrong?

153
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:26,636
Where do you think you’re looking straight at? HWAK!

154
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:30,563
Since I’m leaving, Mi-ri and I were supposed to go shopping for necessities,

155
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:32,304
but where is she now leaving you alone?

156
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:37,113
Oh, she said for me to go with you to buy your necessities, and she went to war.

157
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:40,428
While talking with the next door neighbor, Young-suk,

158
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:45,415
about Soo-hee and you, she went to go see Ji-ahn.

159
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,545
Oh. She left it here.

160
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,935
Aigoo! That girl always uses the washer for her panties instead of washing them herself!

161
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:12,446
Aigoo! That’s dirty! Dirty punk!

162
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:15,831
How many times do I have to tell her to wash them separately?

163
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,422
Aigoo, really.

164
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,497
Drink up.

165
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:51,112
Why do you disgust me?

166
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:56,051
If you ended it with Soo-hee, why can’t you leave your trail spotless?

167
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:57,904
You can’t do that?

168
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,811
What do you think you're doing, you!

169
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,632
Mi-ri...

170
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:07,837
You never understood, huh?

171
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:13,836
Why do I have to understand you?

172
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:17,246
Why does everyone have to understand you?

173
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,873
I, too, live without the understanding of my mother and father.

174
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:26,598
Isn’t life supposed to be that some understand and others don’t?

175
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:33,852
Stop messing with love and cancel your request to Soo-hee.

176
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,406
If I was going to stop here after your words, I wouldn’t have even come here.

177
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,837
I wanted to do that, but I had repressed the urge.

178
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:55,958
Although it’s only one hit, I had really liked you so my lips hurt talking.

179
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:58,617
Wake up!

180
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:01,514
You’re not the only one having a hard time in life.

181
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,059
How can you just care about yourself, you jerk!

182
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,870
Don’t act like you’re sad alone.

183
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,533
When I see it, you make yourself sad.

184
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:28,117
Unni, why did you do something I didn’t ask for?

185
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:31,211
Who told you to bring Soo-hee?

186
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:33,734
Do you think I’m in the right mind to see her?

187
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,823
I did wrong, I did wrong.

188
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:38,628
Just saying you’re wrong, is it?!

189
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:43,658
If she was thinking of Min-ho, she wouldn’t do this.

190
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:48,326
Ji-ahn, what is he to her that she puts him first above Min-ho?

191
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:53,551
Even though Soo-hee is my friend, I really don’t like this event.

192
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,818
Is it time for her to think of Ji-ahn, she should be thinking of Min-ho.

193
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,738
I think more for Ho-chul than Min-ho.

194
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:00,714
What did you say?

195
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:04,008
I said that I think more for Ho-chul than Min-ho.

196
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,222
What are you saying?

197
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,653
You, silly girl!

198
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:12,443
Of course Soo-hee thinks more of Min-ho, you think you think more of him?

199
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,624
Drink beer.

200
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,536
Breathe again.

201
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:28,875
I’m opening the door.

202
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:41,893
Sit down.

203
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,057
Is the fake situation going well?

204
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,719
Yes.

205
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:52,548
You should breathe big again.

206
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:05,592
Can’t you just live idle? You have to buy all these?

207
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:09,219
There’s nothing to do there so I have to buy everything.

208
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,734
Then why are you going there if there’s nothing to do?

209
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:17,232
The wind, the sun, the people are all good there.

210
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:21,784
I saw it in an ad once and it left an impression in my head.

211
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:22,530
Oh yeah.

212
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:26,054
There’s a lot of "yahsaesulmae" there.
It’s very tasty.

213
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:27,524
Have you tasted it?

214
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:30,419
You would go all the way there to taste it?

215
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,886
There’s really nothing there at all.

216
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:34,856
You shouldn’t go.

217
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:37,394
If I go and there’s nothing to do, I’ll come back.

218
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:39,708
But, I have to go now.

219
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:44,752
I have to confirm with my own eyes that there is nothing there.

220
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:49,922
Leaving your girl here, do those things matter that much?

221
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:54,021
When people give you advice next to you, just listen.

222
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:56,637
It’s obvious you’re going to regret it, but why do it?

223
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:04,960
Of course, you know what you’re doing, that’s youth.

224
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:10,424
Little kid, you don’t know how great it is for this old guy.

225
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:13,500
I don’t have strength to force anything, fight.

226
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:16,723
Everything’s just a mindset of mediocrity.

227
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:22,363
I’m doing everything my little dot is telling me to do: laundry, carefully and arduously.

228
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,630
Let’s go.

229
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:32,377
You're acting kind, makes me mad.

230
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,857
I’m mad at myself too.

231
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:44,957
I don’t like it that you’re not even thinking about your lover and being stubborn by doing it your way.

232
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:47,332
Yeah.

233
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,509
I don’t like myself either.

234
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:52,660
Stop realizing it.

235
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:56,556
It makes me mad even that you are following along with the plan.

236
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:06,958
Even though I talk to you, you’re going to stick by Ji-ahn and leave Min-ho to go alone, huh?

237
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:09,601
She said that she’s going to find him!

238
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,221
You’re giving Min-ho a scar, what if he doesn’t accept you?

239
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,854
If he doesn’t, then he doesn’t.
What is there to do?

240
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:19,776
You do it until you can, and if you can’t you discard it.

241
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:23,181
She’s not a stalker, so she can’t follow him around.

242
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:27,747
Do you have to do it?

243
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:32,182
Sorry.

244
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:35,349
I really don’t like it.

245
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,881
I really really don’t like it.

246
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,205
But...

247
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:46,462
I’m not saying that you aren’t my friend.

248
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,589
Don’t get me wrong.

249
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:05,823
Thanks.

250
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:10,840
Even Min-ho has his fault of not giving in.

251
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:17,459
Later, get on your knees and don’t act so pompous.

252
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:24,380
I’ll do it a 100, a 1000 times.

253
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,911
That’s it then.

254
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,160
Hey!

255
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:38,201
I knew something very important about life today.

256
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,822
So, what again?

257
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:45,769
This wine brand really kills!

258
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:52,398
Really, even when I’m drinking beer, you make me laugh I can’t drink.

259
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:55,001
Aigoo, really. Weird, weird.

260
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,575
Who says I’m not weird?

261
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:57,576
I’m weird.

262
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,900
Everybody in this neighborhood knows I’m weird.

263
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:03,646
Really, I can’t live because of you! I can’t live!

264
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:14,911
<i>There is a lady who wants to keep a friendship with a man.</i>

<i>There’s a lady who’s all in for a man.</i>

00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,007
Friendly, we should share, and you just eat them all, punk?

267
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,911
Are you that mad that your face is red?

268
00:23:30,962 --> 00:23:32,517
Aigoo, punk.

269
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:35,921
Aigoo, aigoo, I’m going too, aigoo.

271
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:46,395
Go with me!

272
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:53,586
<i>There’s a man who knows that he’s going to regret a decision, but can’t stop.</i>

<i>There’s a man who gives all the hurt and receives all the hurt.</i>

274
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:15,121
<i>And there’s that lady.</i>

275
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:18,084
Tell me.

276
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:20,646
If you’re tired, I won’t call.

277
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,400
<i>Also, there’s me that thinks she is a burden to others.</i>

278

<i>In life there are these different people.</i>

279
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:34,282
Good. Then I’ll be short.

280
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:38,193
No matter how much I study, my English won’t get better.

281
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:43,481
When I visit you later, I don’t want to talk to you with an accent.

282
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,906
Tell me. How do I study English?

283
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:50,073
<i>If it’s your level, you don’t have to study.</i>

284
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:54,406
<i>Just come here often, and talk to people here.</i>

285
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:57,135
Telling me to come over?

286
00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:02,110
I see. Sleep well.

287
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:05,687
Okay. I’ll call you.

288
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,094
I think I did well not to make him tired of me.

289
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:16,664
Let’s go on then, but I have to at least start studying.

290
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,262
I can’t call that often.

291
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:32,856
Just think of it as a vacation.

292
00:25:33,924 --> 00:25:37,250
You know I’m careful.

293
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:42,387
Show me your face before going.

294
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,966
I’m just going.

295
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:52,146
If I see you, my heart is just…

296

Min-ho.

297

You know that I love you a lot, right?

298
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:04,013
You’re going knowing that, right?

299
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,457
Of course.

300
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:13,531
I love you a lot too, mom.

301

Don’t forget it.

302
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:24,233
You go first.

303
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,996
Okay.

304
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:31,506
I’m going first.

00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:32,985
You stupid.

322
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:44,347
Let’s split as we are laughing.

323
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,128
And let’s see each other again.

324
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:56,802
When I’m older and your hair gets white.

325
00:31:57,534 --> 00:32:06,533
Like now, me living in the attic, us riding the bicycle and going to the restaurant.

326
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:37,199
Take care of yourself.

327
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:52,064
I will go well. Live strong.

328
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,805
Hey! Why do you keep flipping the meat over?

329
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,926
You should only flip the meat once.

330
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:37,184
If you flip it two or three times it loses its taste. You can't seem to do anything right.

331
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,856
Why do you have so much to say today? I can't concentrate because of you.

332
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,691
Stop!

333
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:49,447
Why do you keep on getting in the way of people's business where you're not wanted?

334
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:52,366
You know what we call you nowadays?

335
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:54,229
What do you call me?

336
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:56,788
Ho-chul ahjuhma!

337
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:00,291
These people...

338
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,985
You, you, you! You thought of that name right?

339
00:34:04,023 --> 00:34:05,379
Of course!

340
00:34:05,408 --> 00:34:09,364
Hyung! Let's drink alcohol.
I want to drink soju. Let's drink!

341
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:11,411
Buddy! Let's do a one-shot together.

342
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:13,664
That would be good. Here.

343
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:19,076
Why? Are you jealous that they have their arms around each other?

344
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,285
Well, you have me.

345
00:34:21,305 --> 00:34:22,173
Let go of me.

346
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:26,785
Punk, you get embarrassed of hugging? Aren't I enough for you?

347
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:29,655
Hey! My eyes look high.

348
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,702
Then, just lower them.

349
00:34:30,723 --> 00:34:32,002
- Let go of me.
- Just stay still.

350
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,538
Wow, you two look good together. You two should live together.

351
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:39,182
Yeah, and you should live with me.

352
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:43,417
Ho-chul, do you really want to go out with me?

353
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:45,844
Just give me a drink.

354
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:47,641
Okay, let's just drink.

355
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:50,005
Cheers!

356
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:01,740
I called Min-ho.

357
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:13,650
I was going to tell him to wait for you and leave with you.

358
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,720
But he didn't pick up the phone, Soo-hee.

359
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:27,200
Don't say anything.

360
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:37,238
Just drink your tea and leave.

361
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,208
I know how you feel.

362
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,655
Yes, this is Oh Young-suk.

363
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:04,861
Wow, you're so stiff. How can you call me just now?

364
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:07,720
Wait a minute.

365
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,426
Your brother.

366
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,644
It's me.

367
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,967
Call me when you get there.

368
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:35,561
So, that means if I call you, you'll act like my brother again?

369
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:36,773
Yeah.

370
00:36:38,514 --> 00:36:43,141
That's good, I will. Okay. Bye.

371
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,379
Kim Min-ho, eat well and poop well.

372
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,379
Okay.

373
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,329
Hey!

374
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:59,079
Why are you crying when you said you wouldn't cry?

375
00:36:59,944 --> 00:37:03,390
I'll send you the stuff you wanted me to send to you tomorrow.

376
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,470
Let's say our farewell with a smile on your face.

377
00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:09,329
You said you won't even contact me there. I don't even want to see your face. Just leave.

378
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:18,171
Ok, then I'm going to take the plane now.

379
00:38:29,694 --> 00:38:34,123
Even if you are putting on a show, you should still make it look real.

380
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:37,070
You did your make-up really bad. Why'd you do it like that?

381
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:25,829
Hey! Look over here! Kimchee.

382
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:27,829
Kimchee.

383
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:35,358
Mom, you hang up first.

384
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:40,120
Okay, I'll hang up first.

385
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:47,744
Stay healthy.

386
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:51,041
Okay.

387
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:10,800
"Libya is not going to be easy."

388
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:13,155
"So stay strong."

389
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:15,105
"Min-ho's dad."

390
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,214
Who is it?

391
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:20,838
Father.

392
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:23,400
Your father?

393
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:28,094
No, my other father.

394
00:41:31,467 --> 00:41:35,082
I'm going to go first, its almost time for the flight.

395
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,308
Don't forget the favor I asked of you.

396
00:41:39,473 --> 00:41:41,273
Okay.

397
00:41:41,308 --> 00:41:43,770
I'll make a rumor that you're looking for me.

398
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:46,740
You can't make a rumor that I already found you.

399
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:50,517
Don't forget the favor I asked of you, too.

400
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:56,817
Okay. Next time I meet someone else, I'll tell them the whole truth from the beginning.

401
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:03,490
If she doesn't like me, then I'll become strong and say to myself that I don't need that kind of a girl in my life.

402
00:42:05,602 --> 00:42:07,617
You matured a lot.

403
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,411
I'm leaving.

404
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:21,744
Excuse me, have you ever seen the man in this picture?

405
00:43:21,764 --> 00:43:23,585
No, sorry.

406
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:38,182
Excuse me, ma'am, have you ever seen the man in this picture?

407
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:21,767
Give me your address. I will send it to you later.

408
00:47:35,882 --> 00:47:37,705
Sir, eat this well.

409
00:47:37,723 --> 00:47:40,420
Hey! Aren't you going to take it back?

410
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,685
You should stop being angry at me by now.

411
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:45,785
I'll be angry forever.

412
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:48,302
I'll come again.

413
00:47:57,585 --> 00:48:00,400
So, he won't look at me forever?

414
00:48:00,435 --> 00:48:02,605
Wow, he's so cruel.

415
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:06,052
That's why, till that age he's still working.

416
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:19,299
How are you driving?!

417
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:28,408
Oh, these kids are dressed so formally in black clothes.

418
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:33,614
Old man, you're really trying too hard to get caught by us.

419
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:37,918
Bow down your heads.

420
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:58,972
Just give me $50 for compensation for the car accident.

421
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:03,085
Okay.

422
00:49:46,935 --> 00:49:49,058
Granny's face is really bright, right?

423
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:51,344
Because she's been always making other people's food.

424
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:57,085
Now other people are making food for her, so I think that makes her feel comfortable.

425
00:49:57,332 --> 00:49:59,700
Anyway, Granny is so peculiar.

426
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:02,361
By the way, are you going to make an appeal again?

427
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:06,352
The appeal's been shortened to six month interval, so I should do it.

428
00:50:06,485 --> 00:50:08,958
The daughter is just like you.

429
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:15,550
Oh, I heard Soo-hee called. What did she say? Did she meet Min-ho?

430
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,500
Not yet.

431
00:50:17,523 --> 00:50:22,100
Oh, no. Min-ho hasn't called yet, right?

432
00:50:22,238 --> 00:50:24,732
Don't even bring up his name to me.

433
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:33,511
Thank you so much.

434
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,497
Thank you.

435
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:35,750
You welcome.

436
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,082
Min-ho.

437
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,318
Min-ho!

438
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:57,764
Min-ho! Kim Min-ho! Min-ho!

439
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:07,301
Min-ho! Kim Min-ho!

440
00:51:08,788 --> 00:51:10,755
Min-ho!

441
00:51:12,205 --> 00:51:17,344
Hey, Kim Min-ho! Min-ho!!

442
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:28,622
Kim Min-ho! Hey, Kim Min-ho!!

443
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:35,255
Min-ho! Min-ho! Hey, Kim Min-ho!!!

444
00:51:36,405 --> 00:51:42,105
Min-ho! Kim Min-ho! Min-ho!

445
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,600
Hey, are you okay?

446
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,902
You must be crazy.

447
00:52:55,547 --> 00:53:00,873
You really came all the way here to find me. I'm shocked.

448
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,144
What would you have done if you didn't find me?

449
00:53:12,955 --> 00:53:16,538
It's already been five months since we haven't seen each other.

450
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:20,194
What if I had found a girl during the period I was away from you?

451
00:53:21,735 --> 00:53:24,997
Tell me, what you would have done?

452
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,011
Say something, you stubborn girl.

453
00:53:33,673 --> 00:53:37,311
I still can't believe it, that I actually found you.

454
00:53:38,352 --> 00:53:40,597
Now you're teasing me.

455
00:53:43,338 --> 00:53:46,385
I regretted not listening to you before.

456
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:50,267
You're an idiot.

457
00:53:50,923 --> 00:53:54,491
You're right. I'm an idiot.

458
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,329
How could you have not found me for that long?

459
00:53:58,844 --> 00:54:05,400
If you ask anyone around here, they all know me as the Korean photographer.

460
00:54:06,032 --> 00:54:08,994
I didn't know you would be a photographer.

461
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:15,867
That's why you're an idiot. You know that I like to take pictures.

462
00:54:16,061 --> 00:54:18,691
But you couldn't even guess what I would do to make a living.

463
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,341
You pretend to be smart, you idiot.

464
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,735
I thought I wouldn't be able to find you.

465
00:55:37,364 --> 00:55:40,623
Did you really regret leaving me behind in Korea?

466
00:55:42,517 --> 00:55:44,952
When did you start regretting it?

467
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:54,450
Right after I arrived at the airport, from that time on until now.

468
00:55:56,276 --> 00:55:58,576
Did you try to look for me?

469
00:56:00,047 --> 00:56:03,452
I went all over the place trying to look for you.

470
00:56:03,908 --> 00:56:07,194
I just stayed in one place in case you came to look for me.

471
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,497
I was afraid we would miss one another.

472
00:56:12,082 --> 00:56:15,035
Well then, you knew that I would come.

473
00:56:15,882 --> 00:56:19,558
Then why didn't you say you would wait for me?

474
00:56:25,764 --> 00:56:31,911
Back then, my heart was feeling like that.

475
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,855
You're so wishy-washy.

476
00:56:38,882 --> 00:56:42,488
What are you going to do now, since you can't go back to Seoul?

477
00:56:43,682 --> 00:56:49,114
Granny, Young-suk and Mi-ri are really mad at you.

478
00:56:49,182 --> 00:56:51,945
They said they wouldn't see you even when you come back.

479
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:56,973
Don't worry because I have a medicine for them.

480
00:56:57,802 --> 00:56:59,617
What kind of medicine?

481
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:06,344
There's just something like this.

482
00:57:12,714 --> 00:57:15,650
This picture looks really good right?

483
00:57:15,702 --> 00:57:16,979
It looks like an actor right?

484
00:57:17,002 --> 00:57:18,444
Yeah, okay.

485
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:23,923
Why are you showing a lack of interest towards me, while I'm telling you how pretty you are?

486
00:57:23,952 --> 00:57:28,014
Think about the past, about all that you've done to me?

487
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:31,300
You're really going all out to get your revenge on me.

488
00:57:32,185 --> 00:57:35,447
Oh, that looks pretty. Let me see it.

489
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:37,505
I want to see it, too.

490
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:40,167
What are you doing? I'm going to look at it.

491
00:57:44,998 --> 00:57:49,708
Whenever you do something wrong, you go and get all lovey-dovey with me. Get away, I don't want to see you.

492
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:50,676
Let's go sleep!

493
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:53,447
No, I want to see the pictures that Min-ho gave me.

494
00:57:53,479 --> 00:57:55,088
No.

495
00:57:57,717 --> 00:57:59,408
Let's sleep.

496
00:58:20,407 --> 00:58:24,308
Okay, next is Granny.

497
00:58:54,917 --> 00:59:05,597
<i>Granny, I pray everyday for all the people in this world who are hurting in their hearts and having a hard time,</i>

498
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:12,714
<i>that they would have someone who can hold their backs, that they can have at least one person like that with them.</i>

499
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:18,261
<i>Granny, I'm happy.</i>

500
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,955
<i>Granny, are you happy too?</i>

501
00:59:33,252 --> 00:59:35,252
Beautiful.

502
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,419
Just Min-ho and Soo-hee?

503
00:59:46,353 --> 00:59:48,522
How about me?

504
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:53,891
Beautiful.

505
01:00:20,614 --> 01:00:22,500
It's from Ji-ahn?

506
01:00:22,591 --> 01:00:24,108
Yeah.

507
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,005
Read it.

508
01:00:26,132 --> 01:00:28,161
Later.

509
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:39,576
You should come home now.

510
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:51,819
Kidding around?
