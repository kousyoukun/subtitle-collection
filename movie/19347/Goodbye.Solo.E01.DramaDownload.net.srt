1
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,110
Choi Mi-ri...

2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,390
What do you think she's doing now?

3
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,010
You understand all the things Jung Soo-hee does, don't you?

4
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,990
It's already been done. It's done.

5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,720
You know I do it too.

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,100
It's fine if it's only 10 or 20 minutes...
but it's been one and a half hours.

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,150
And it's not once or twice, she's always like that, all the time.

8
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,400
"The bus was caught in a jam."
"The train was a little late."

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,060
"My mom came to visit."
"My good friend was sick."

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,460
I don't know how she finds so many excuses just to go see Ji-ahn.

11
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,970
And it is not like that all the time.
It's only when she goes to see Ji-ahn!

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,100
Shut your eyes...

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,200
When men are nice to you,
you should know to be grateful.

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,230
Every time she speaks, she mentions Ji-ahn.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,890
I hate it when you are like this.

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,010
<i>I'm really uncomfortable looking at your face.
Fancy girl is growing so tall!</i>

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,650
<i>In my opinion you must have run out of places to drink and things to do.</i>

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,300
That's enough, you rascal!

19
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,650
That felt good.. huh?

20
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,380
Why are you acting all innocent like that?

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,990
<i>I see you almost every day.
How can my life be so out of luck?</i>

22
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,470
I just feel unjustified for you...that's all.

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
How's this?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,660
Still a little baffling.

25
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,070
I'm doing it on purpose. Is this sexy?

26
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,670
You really look quite pretty.

27
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,860
I can't understand you...

28
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,160
How can you actually like me so much?
Should I feel grateful to you?

29
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,130
Hey...look!

30
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,640
<i>Kim Min-ho...do you really like me that much?</i>

31
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,540
<i>You really don't know?</i>

32
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,320
<i>I love you to death!</i>

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,610
<i>Love me to death?</i>

34
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,970
Kim Min-ho really loves Choi Mi-ri to death?

35
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,860
Do you really not know?

36
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,870
Yes...

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,520
I love you...

38
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,760
You're really acting like it's true.

39
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,080
<i>Min-ho...this fellow is a master at lying.</i>

40
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,580
(EPISODE 1)

41
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,900
What is this?

42
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,550
Apologize to him...

43
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,150
This bunch of fellows...

44
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,650
Are you not satisfied?

45
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,190
Because he snatched your drink…
Do you want to turn him into bloody pulp?

46
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,050
Bloody pulp...he said bloody pulp.

47
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Use this and serve them more good food.

48
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,900
Goodbye...

49
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,880
I'm sorry, sir. I'll fix you a new glass.

50
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,240
Boss...boss...

51
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,810
Did you hear what that man said just now?

52
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,920
Bloody pulp! Bloody pulp!
Wow...he was so cool!

53
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,480
His mouth was all pouted like that.

54
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,890
Oh yes. Did he get rid of his moustache?

55
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,150
Wow really! How could he be so cool?

56
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,900
How could he be so cool?
He's really so suave!

57
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,330
Rascal...rascal...!
He's really a rascal.

58
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,180
That's all for today.
I'm making a move.

59
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,900
I think boss really doesn't fancy him.

60
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,760
He looks so lethargic when he is at work.

61
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,320
<i>How can I help you?</i>

62
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,660
<i>First...that day we should have…</i>

63
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,530
Why? You don't want to take the money?

64
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,670
Take it...

65
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,930
Thank you...

66
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,820
Next time onwards, when you eat, you need money.

67
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,210
You can only get what you need if you take the money.

68
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,500
Do you understand?

69
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,520
I don't need it, big brother.

70
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,680
Not enough?

71
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,100
I really don't need it.

72
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,160
Not enough?

73
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,860
I don't need it.

74
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,180
Still not enough...

75
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,850
All right. Enough, big brother.

76
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,960
Go...

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,850
Yes, big brother.

78
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:37,040
Wh..Wha..What do you think you're doing? C'mon!

79
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,690
I want fried sticky cake.
Let's go to Sindangdong.

80
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,600
Do you want to eat Sindangdong's fried sticky cake or die?

81
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,800
How many times have I told you?

82
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,340
No…no…aren't you afraid when the car is approaching?

83
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,540
Do you have any rationality at all?

84
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,480
For someone who looks so cool, how can you stammer?

85
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm enduring with you so!

86
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,290
Really?

87
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:14,891
<i>Oh you are loveable from your head to your toes</i>

88
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:20,292
<i>Oh it's so nice to say that you're my girl</i>

89
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:25,893
<i>This cold person finds himself smiling all day</i>

90
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:29,994
<i>What did I have to do?</i>

91
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:35,495
<i>Oh even your shadow and appearance from behind is loveable</i>

92
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:40,096
<i>Oh these feelings for you come so naturally</i>

93
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:46,097
<i>Waiting has become easy with the sweetness in the air</i>

94
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:49,698
<i>It is like this, that I love you</i>

95
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,500
Pass me the tissues...

96
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,320
It's just kids fooling around, so much tears!

97
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,120
Romeo and Juliet, you say it's just fooling around?

98
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,770
If that's not fooling around what is that?

99
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,260
That is called love! Understand?

100
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,390
Love? What a joke!

101
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,780
Love it's so cold it's frozen to death.

102
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,860
Do use your brain and think properly.

103
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,560
Falling for a girl the first time you lay eyes on her.

104
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,010
And acting so sneakily too!

105
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,090
And what…moonlight! Fate!

106
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,330
And that girl! Really too much!

107
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,420
It's not "that girl"...it's Juliet.

108
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,500
Is the name important?
What we're doing now is important!

109
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,600
Children whose blood on the head is not dry yet!

110
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,240
And why take the medicine which his wife asked him not to take?

111
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,400
Didn't consider the consequences!
Didn't listen to the wife!  Still went to the girl!

112
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,440
Love? What a joke!

113
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,400
If your loved one dies, you follow and die too? No consideration whatsoever for your parents, siblings?

114
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,650
It could be like that when you love too deeply.

115
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,360
You've gone insane.

116
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,420
If your kids are like that, would you still say that?

117
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,560
If the person they like dies, you let them follow and die as well?

118
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,970
When you followed me to my place,
I knew you had mental problems.

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,290
Be careful...

120
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,540
Even if you break up with me in the future,
that Dumeo...

121
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,780
Not Dumeo, it's Romeo.

122
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,110
Whatever! Just don't find some bad-tempered fellow like that.

123
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:57,580
The kind of scoundrel who just takes a pistol
and shoots randomly at the sofa.

124
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,610
Oh...scoundrels are of that type of character.

125
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,130
People like that, if a customer demands a bit more...

126
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,630
He'll take out a gun and shoot all over the place!

127
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,120
Isn't that so?

128
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,560
You have such a tough mouth, isn't that so?

129
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,540
Take your pig feet away...

130
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,160
So what if I don't?

131
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,260
If I don't, what are you going to do?

132
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,200
What are you going to do, bad egg?

133
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,810
Didn't I tell you not to talk to me like that?

134
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,040
You are a bad egg! Am I wrong to call you that?

135
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,230
Oh I'm enduring you so...

136
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,290
Are you going to return that to me?

137
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,880
You do nothing but eat everyday.

138
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,050
It tastes pretty good!

139
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,860
Mine! Give it back to me!

140
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,380
Come get me! Get me and I'll return it!

141
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,580
You're going to get it when I catch you!

142
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,500
Come get me! Come get me!

143
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,360
Miss Mi-young...

144
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,700
I'll go and return quickly.

145
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,430
I think I'll have to endure some too.

146
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,110
No matter who calls you. Don't go anywhere...

147
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,870
Just say you have a lover already.

148
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,590
Bye...bye...okay?

149
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,490
Don't come out.

150
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,540
I told you not to come out...

151
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,190
Go back in...

152
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,080
You'll call me, won't you?

153
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,330
Are you going to play gangster again?

154
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,770
Your eyeballs are going to fall out!

155
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,520
Too much talking!

156
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm here to deliver something to Mi-ri.

157
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,030
Actually, I really didn't want to come.

158
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,430
Mi-ri's Grandma insisted I send this over.

159
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,500
She said there's nothing left for breakfast.

160
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,520
I really didn't want to come.

161
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,210
Is anybody asking you?

162
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,440
No...

163
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Eat slowly...

164
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,520
I'm hungry.

165
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,080
How can you say you're hungry while eating?

166
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,370
Do you say you're sleepy even in your sleep?

167
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,080
Yup!

168
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,840
Don't choke...

169
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,660
Didn't I tell you no photos!

170
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,810
You think I'm taking your picture?
I'm taking Ji-ahn's photo!

171
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,300
And the bickering starts...

172
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,660
You like Ji-ahn right?

173
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,710
I'm going to say it!

174
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,460
What's up with the two of you?

175
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,850
You just have to bicker when you meet.

176
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,210
That's because you're in a clear position.

177
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,070
Did you say Min-ho and I need to be together?

178
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,370
Is this how you really think?

179
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,340
Yes, don't you know?

180
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,990
If it's not for this, I will not even look at you.

181
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,640
Kim Min-ho is angry again.

182
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,930
You…

183
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,110
Between the two of you, you are the pettier one...

184
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,150
Because you're always the one getting angry, right?

185
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,850
Min-ho!

186
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,240
Tantrums...he's throwing tantrums again...tantrums again.

187
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,850
You just have to argue. Argue!

188
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,640
Hey! Get along well with your lover!

189
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,900
Don't be angry...

190
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,330
Does Soo-hee spend her life with me?
No, she spends it with you.

191
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,650
It doesn't matter if she doesn't get along with me.

192
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,360
But aren't the two of you just getting along fine?

193
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,640
There's only one woman in my life and that's Mi-ri.

194
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,550
She's my girlfriend...my lover...

195
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,470
I don't need other women.

196
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,850
Mi-ri…

197
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,470
…is she still seeing that guy Ho-chul?

198
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,680
I guess so...

199
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,760
I think there's a high school gathering coming up.

200
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,360
Do you want to join?

201
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,510
Mi-ri, you and me. The three of us together makes a gathering...

202
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,690
Who needs a high school gathering?
I'm not going.

203
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Your Mom asks if you're doing fine.

204
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,140
Go home...

205
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,830
You have a home and you stay outside, while I stay at your home.

206
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,120
Don't you find that strange?

207
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,950
What's so strange about that?

208
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:55,080
My father doesn't like this son of his, and he likes you so much he treats you like his son.

209
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,900
Isn't it very natural to stay with people you like?

210
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,360
Minjae seems to think it's unconvenient too.

211
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,910
My brother, he doesn't just find it inconvenient with you but with anybody too.

212
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,250
Shall I buy you a camera?

213
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,230
Hey! If I even accept something like that people will start calling me a cheat! No!

214
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,540
Who would think like that?

215
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,330
Ji-ahn!

216
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,890
Is this your new car?

217
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,710
Go on...

218
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,600
Let's go together. Get in the car..

219
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,010
Ji-ahn! How much does this car cost?

220
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,250
This car is really expensive, right?
It must be at least 200 thousand won right?

221
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,580
Oh…it's so pretty!

222
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,700
Oh really!

223
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,660
Oh what to do?  I've been found out!

224
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,940
I really want to find a secluded place on a rainy day and give you a good beating!

225
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,440
Ji-ahn...he says he wants to beat me up.

226
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,730
Do you have anything to say to your Mom?

227
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,450
Tell her to eat more...

228
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,440
When you're done eating remember to return the box.

229
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,990
Mi-ri's grandma's boxes are all in your house!

230
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,340
I understand!

231
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,960
Ask Mi-ri to drop by the studio next week.
I need to redraw the picture.

232
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,540
Ok, go on!

233
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,270
We're going!

234
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,390
Min-ho's no good?

235
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,210
He's kinda cute. It's fun being with him.

236
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,340
Min-ho owns a lot...

237
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,400
He has a great character and he gets along really well with others.

238
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,450
He is so enviable!

239
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,480
You're not so bad yourself...

240
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,740
Thank you.

241
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,540
Brother!

242
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,710
What? You want me to leave?

243
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,800
It's been along time since we last met.
Let's at least have a meal together! My treat...

244
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,830
Why should I have a meal with you?

245
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,160
Brother!

246
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,810
Didn't I ask you not to call me that?

247
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,000
If I don't call my brother "brother" then what should I call you?

248
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,990
Uncle...? Dad...?

249
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,420
When you talk say something decent.
You tell me...

250
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,390
If I don't call brother, what should I call you?
Should I call you a woodpecker?

251
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,330
That's not too bad.  Woodpecker...

252
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,140
Brother!

253
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,120
Brother! Kim Minjae!

254
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,190
Hey you scoundrel!

255
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,870
Hey slow down!

256
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,910
Slow down!

257
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,450
I can't hear you!

258
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,070
I said to slow down!

259
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,010
Stop!

260
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,550
Stop you rascal!

261
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,330
I ask you to stop the bike, rascal!

262
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,380
Stop the bike!

263
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,310
Watch out!

264
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,080
Patient! Incoming patient!

265
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,010
Patient!

266
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,410
Help! Incoming patient!

267
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,420
Customer!

268
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,330
What are you saying?

269
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,540
Why can't I give blood to my brother?

270
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,840
I'm type B, my brother's type B!

271
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,650
My entire family, Dad, Mom and I are all type B!

272
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,020
Mr. Kim, you are type A...

273
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,700
Miss Oh Yongsuk

274
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,690
You doctors are so amusing.

275
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,070
You call everybody "Miss"...
(Shi: Common way of addressing "Mr." and "Ms." in Korean)

276
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:58,690
Fathers are called "Shi", Mothers are called "Shi", Sisters are called "Shi"...

277
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,810
But when others call you that, you're don't seem to like it.

278
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,940
Are you crazy?
Smiling the moment I talk.

279
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,380
What do you think you're doing?

280
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,650
Flipping over the table...

281
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,920
Oh...your wings are strong now.

282
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,140
I am no longer the old me.

283
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,710
Why are you still talking like that then.
Flipping over...no...

284
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,900
Are you behaving like that because you watched too much TV?

285
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,130
You've become interesting.

286
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:45,500
Brother, I can't give it to you anymore.

287
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,510
Do you think I don't want it just because you won't give it to me?

288
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,450
I need to eat and live too.

289
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,010
Have you gone hungry under me before?

290
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,250
He's taking out his weapon.

291
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,830
Sit down. Don't move.

292
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,180
Why is the chewing gum so tough?

293
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,960
This doctor is well-practiced in sewing.

294
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,140
Can't we call it sewing?

295
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,810
Maybe not...

296
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,210
Please go on.

297
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,110
Is this a cold plaster or a hot plaster?

298
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,340
It's a cold plaster.

299
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,760
Well done...

300
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,710
I find hot plasters too hot. I don't like them.

301
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,640
Did you say Sangteok's mother has lung problems?

302
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,680
It's the younger brother.
His mother is suffering from kidney cancer.

303
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,060
What does the father do?

304
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,550
He passed away a long time ago.

305
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,440
Any woman?

306
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,120
They broke up after he went back to school.

307
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,150
It's been 5 years already.

308
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,330
I'm making a trip to the hospital.

309
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,370
The pain is killing me.

310
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,270
We meet again!

311
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,180
Min-ho...

312
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,150
Looks like he will be able having a meal together with us.

313
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,100
Looks like he grown up..

314
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,720
You should rest. You have a meeting tomorrow morning.

315
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,410
I want to finish the news.

316
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,750
I'm going to rest first.

317
00:30:53,620 --> 00:31:01,310
That person..even when I say nice things she still puts up an attitude.

318
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,680
What a woman...

319
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,260
It's delicious...

320
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,180
Salty, it's salty!

321
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,080
Hey it's me.
The phone call came late huh?

322
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,140
Waiting for a while won't kill you.

323
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,260
Business is so good it's incredible.

324
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,280
The vegetable business generally does well in hot seasons.

325
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,400
Recently those condominiums have been growing their own spinach and lettuce, so they sell badly.

326
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,770
Now you understand why? Yes, now you understand.

327
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,250
The way you talk it seems like you have turned into a businessman.

328
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:54,310
It is like that! I'm just a normal businessman.

329
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:58,110
I'm also a very outstanding businessman.

330
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,980
So, how are the children doing?

331
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,030
They are doing very well.

332
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,630
I understand. You've always been very meticulous.

333
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,730
I miss you...

334
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,100
I miss you, too.

335
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,870
Re…Really!

336
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,690
Do you really miss me?

337
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,010
Yeah! My mood is incredible now!

338
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,490
Jisoo, you said you miss me?

339
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,250
Do you want to buy some clothes?
I'll give you money.

340
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,400
Quick tell me...I'll give you some money to buy new clothes.

341
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,790
No need...

342
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,270
Why not? Don't women all like to buy clothes?

343
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,550
Buy the clothes you like.  I'll give you the money.

344
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,410
That'll do...

345
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,150
You…you…

346
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,360
I'm going out to have a look.

347
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,770
Why is it that whenever I chat with you, you want to hang up?

348
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,430
I understand. You go ahead...

349
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:01,120
But I want to drop by your place some day.

350
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:07,080
I miss the children, and I miss you.

351
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,760
Then come during Spring time. The ocean is beautiful at that time.

352
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:17,870
Spring? Isn't Spring a month from now?

353
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,040
I'll hang up. The children are calling me.

354
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,710
Jisoo, Oppa…

355
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,900
I'm hanging up.

356
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,180
Jisoo! Ji…

357
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:55,040
What is that little nothing doing? Not picking up her call...

358
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,130
Pick up the phone.

359
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,320
Maybe it's Ho-chul. Pick up the phone!

360
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,150
Your eyelids are tearing open!

361
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,000
This temper of yours...

362
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,110
Delicious!

363
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,000
Mi-ri, try some!

364
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,570
Granny, I think she's going crazy...

365
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:26,650
Sorry!  I'm really sorry!

366
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,800
What kind of woman are you...

367
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,560
Whatever...

368
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,670
You came over so quickly?

369
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,050
Yeah...I'm free anyway so I came over.

370
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:46,360
Did you go to see Ho-chul?

371
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,320
I want to break up with him.

372
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,310
She is not picking up her calls?

373
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,550
I'm calling because she's not picking up. If she picked up do you think I'd still be calling?

374
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,750
Do I look crazy to you?

375
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:17,180
My legs hurt, I'll sit for a while.

376
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,300
Why do you keep calling me?

377
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,040
Let's have dinner...

378
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,330
I've eaten.

379
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,370
Is that him?

380
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,060
Some gangster...

381
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,410
I'll hang up. I'm busy.

382
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,270
Come to the pub. I'll wait for you.

383
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,290
Midnight?

384
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,820
Come over quickly. I'll wait for you.

385
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,120
I love you?

386
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,490
Oh, you want me to say "I love you?"

387
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,830
I love you!

388
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,180
How come even your "I love you" doesn't feel real?

389
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,610
Eat...sleep...love...

390
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,190
It's so easy.

391
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,490
Saying "I love you" to me is easier for you, compared to munching your cookies.

392
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,290
What is so difficult about that? I don't have to use English, I can use Korean.

393
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,540
Actually it's not difficult saying it in English too.

394
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,060
I LOVE YOU!

395
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,010
You don't call for such a long time...

396
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,880
And you don't even say a word of apology and "I love you."

397
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,370
Really!

398
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,160
If you only know how to say things like that,
you better hang up.

399
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,850
She hung up the phone?

400
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,270
Why are you so concerned about me?

401
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,520
Look at you, rascal...

402
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,640
Staring at me with such huge eyes.

403
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,090
If you're in a bad mood, do you want to do it another day?

404
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,040
No...continue drawing.

405
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,270
Head tilted to the left?

406
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,430
Yes...

407
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,650
Soo-hee...

408
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,290
I really like the surname Kang.

409
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,380
It seems like it.

410
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,840
Despite everything,
it seems like I still like him.

411
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:48,941
<i>It seems like there is no sadness</i>

412
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:56,942
<i>Even when I'm caught in the rain without an umbrella</i>

413
00:39:57,843 --> 00:40:08,143
<i>I am happy...you are inside my heart</i>

414
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:23,744
<i>The instant when you and I crossed paths, I was reborn</i>

415
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:31,745
<i>When you are gone, I now feel like I never existed</i>

416
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:38,746
<i>Not even memories are left</i>

417
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,510
What are you doing?

418
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,920
Have a chat with me...

419
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,350
I only fight with men. I don't chat with them. Go away!

420
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,380
What are you doing?

421
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,440
Let's have a chat...

422
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,590
Get out!

423
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,950
Mi-ri seems to really like you...

424
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,080
She went against her family,
just so she can be with you.

425
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,120
Please protect her well...

426
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,360
Protect?

427
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,960
Mi-ri is a friend I would like to protect.

428
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,830
I heard Mi-ri and you have been like this since high school...

429
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,970
It seems like the two of you are still at it now.

430
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,800
Well if you're willing,
I can't really interfere much.

431
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,510
But you...stop dreaming!

432
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,110
I'm being very sincere here.

433
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,400
Sincere? Go look for it on the dining table.
(Pronunciation of "sincere" and "rice" is similar)

434
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,000
And I think you are really…

435
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,130
Have you been reading too many cheap novels or something? This is unbecoming!

436
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,370
It's like that on TV too...

437
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,580
Do men generally think they're dogs or cows, all screaming they want to "protect"?

438
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,890
What exactly is "protect"?

439
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,170
If robbers are where Mi-ri is staying,
are you going to station yourself there?

440
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,100
Is that the case?

441
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:37,170
The police will "protect" the area well,
and there's also the volunteer patrol.

442
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,750
I didn't mean it like that...

443
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,680
Then what do you mean?
Then how do you "protect" Mi-ri?

444
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,030
Start at...protection from getting the flu?
Or starting from other aspects?

445
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,360
There could be traffic accidents,
so do we "protect" her from in the car?

446
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,660
Well…

447
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,770
Whether it's the flu or traffic accidents...

448
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:57,370
We have to be more careful ourselves!
This is not for anybody to "protect"!

449
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,200
As men, shouldn't we protect...

450
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,850
Hey Kim Min-ho...

451
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,700
Go tell all the men in this world to just live their lives well!

452
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:12,070
Women can survive very well on their own
as long as men don't hurt them.

453
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,400
Don't read too many of those meaningless love novels!

454
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,360
These days, the men don't seem to understand,
just know how to pay lip service.

455
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,780
This is not the global security.
What's up with all the protecting?

456
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,260
I don't like to repeat myself.  Get out of the car!

457
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:39,460
Hyung, actually…

458
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:02,010
I thought I could persuade him.
This is one tough nut to crack.

459
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,780
This rascal. He's kinda cute.

460
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,050
Ooh good! Good!

461
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,160
I think it's because I keep tilting my head to one side, the pain is killing me!

462
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,590
This feels good...

463
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,570
I massage really well, don't I?

464
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,140
Yes it's good, but it's also tiring, isn't it?

465
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,450
Ok, you should rest too...

466
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,210
I was waiting for you to say this.

467
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,570
I thought you only know design, not sketching.

468
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,230
Your sketch is pretty good!

469
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,810
Thank you...

470
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,690
Thanks to you I've fulfilled a wish!

471
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:47,110
I've really wanted a drawing of myself.

472
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,110
Soo-hee...

473
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,860
Tell me exactly what do you see in Ji-ahn?

474
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:01,520
Because he is capable?

475
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,150
Because he is good to you?

476
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,150
Isn't he cold?

477
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,990
No...

478
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,270
If Min-ho says he likes you, what are you going to do?

479
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,150
Be grateful of course!

480
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:23,040
Get up and think...

481
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,830
Why?

482
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,980
Min-ho really likes you a lot.

483
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,180
Doesn't he like you?

484
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,620
That was a long time ago. Now it's you..

485
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,310
You must be very confused now too, aren't you?

486
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,720
You want to marry someone with a bit more money, don't you?

487
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,040
Consider Kim Min-ho!

488
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,370
Isn't he very rich?  His father is really great, as you know!

489
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,260
Did you draw your eyebrows?

490
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,050
Concentrate and listen to me!

491
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:49,650
I can't concentrate, how do I concentrate?

492
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,500
I understand. My bad.

493
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:57,470
I tried to covince you with Min-ho's family, it's my fault. Sorry...

494
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,490
But Min-ho is really a good person.

495
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,550
Thank you for introducing Min-ho to me.

496
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,610
Kim Min-ho is not interested in me, that is something the whole world knows!

497
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:10,730
If you're talking about his feelings for Ji-ahn,
it makes more sense.  But me?  No way!

498
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,750
That's because he's still young.

499
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:20,560
Isn't that the way boys behave toward women they like when they are young?

500
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,070
Did Min-ho say he likes me?

501
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,080
Will you break up with Ji-ahn?

502
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,130
But why do you dislike Ji-ahn?

503
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,100
It's just a feeling...

504
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,720
He can lie his way past others but not past me.

505
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,940
Ji-ahn is my boyfriend. That guy is someone who liked you before.

506
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,620
Aren't you a bit mean?

507
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,050
I just wanted to convince you.

508
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,880
Is that all you were trying to do?

509
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:53,520
If Min-ho says he likes you, will you consider him?

510
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,860
Can I seduce men that well?

511
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,150
Am I really that pretty in your eyes too?

512
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,980
Are you asking for a beating?

513
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,960
Is this asking for a beating?

514
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,780
Yes, a beating...

515
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,000
A beating...

516
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,880
Choi Mi-ri!

517
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,330
What are you doing?

518
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,890
What?

519
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,950
My car!

520
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,130
We didn't collide!

521
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,750
That's it then.

522
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:59,850
What kind of a person…

523
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,470
Please hold for a while...

524
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,920
Going up.

525
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,430
Don't drop anything. Be careful!

526
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,280
How much more are there?

527
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,140
I think about one third left.

528
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,510
Let's hurry then!

529
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,620
It's getting late. Let's hurry along!

530
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:42,620
What is this?  Moving at night.  It's so noisy...

531
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:50,080
You're a little mean, there.
Have you ever heard of noise killing anybody?

532
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,560
I can't believe there are people like that!

533
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,000
Granny...

534
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,690
<i>Get up!</i>

535
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,700
Granny...I want to sleep...sleep.

536
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,950
I can't keep my eyes open..

537
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:51,260
Granny...I've set up outside, and the windows are cleaned.

538
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,360
<i>Pretty</i>

539
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,970
A kiss then...

540
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,810
Granny and I are really something.

541
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,240
I first knew Granny when I was in high school.

542
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,500
It has been 7, 8 years now.
Why is our relationship still so good?

543
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:36,090
I didn't fool around outside like other men.
You should thank me!

544
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,820
What are you smiling about?

545
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,510
Didn't you say you want to go to the bank to pay your taxes?  Better get prepared!

546
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,420
I'll wash my face and we'll set off.

547
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:01,840
This woman has moved to the unit in front of my house.

548
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:08,110
How unfortunate...looks like your life is going to experience some turmoils.

549
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:12,580
Captain, brother, this woman is a real headache!

550
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:19,110
At first, I saw her looking so serious reading this book, so I got curious and took a peek.

551
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,220
I think she's feeling empty.

552
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,390
So why was she looking so serious?

553
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:31,000
"This is 300 thousand won. That is 200 thousand won.  To buy or not to buy?"

554
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,070
She was playing around with those.

555
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,740
It's really impossible to like this woman.

556
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:45,230
Since there's no customers let's go in for a drink.

557
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:27,570
That person can lie so well. He can even convince himself to believe his lies.

558
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,490
What is this?

559
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,720
Don't look!

560
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,330
You can take pictures very well even with your handphone.

561
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,020
Are you still unhappy over the incident this morning?

562
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,980
Are you crazy? Waste of time...

563
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:16,100
Why is it that you obviously like Soo-hee but never say you like her?

564
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,900
What?

565
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,300
Is it because you feel guilty towards Ji-ahn?

566
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,130
Choi Mi-ri...

567
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,140
Don't play pranks on people.

568
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,040
I'm playing pranks on you?

569
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,440
Aren't you playing pranks on me?

570
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,080
I love you very much. Since high school…

571
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,280
…third year when we met all the way until now, right?

572
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,530
Whether it's raining or snowing?

573
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:45,400
Yes, I fear Ho-chul, so I'm not able to be with you.
But I love you more than him!

574
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:48,230
Don't be afraid of him!
I'll just pretend like I didn't see anything.

575
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,230
Didn't see? Didn't see who?

576
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,660
Ho-chul...

577
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,790
What rubbish are you talking about?

578
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,030
Are you running away?

579
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,600
Are you going to keep pressing on?

580
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,700
Why do you keep pairing people together?

581
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:07,770
Soo-hee and me? If Ji-ahn knows…

582
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:11,960
Choi Mi-ri...why don't you pair me up with granny?

583
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,630
Bad egg. Unbecoming!

584
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:18,190
Since you say you love me so much then you'll sleep with me if I offer you?

585
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,310
I'm a man too...

586
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:26,080
If you want to give it to me, will I reject?

587
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,320
Right, I'll give you then...

588
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:36,220
Once people die their bodies decompose anyway. What have I got to lose?

589
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:41,410
But Kim Min-ho, if I give it to you and you reject me, you're dead meat...

590
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:44,380
I'm going to unveil your lies today no matter what!

591
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,950
You say you love me, eh?
Will I be fooled by your lies?

592
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,770
You irritating fellow...

593
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:53,380
Even jokes should have their limits, insisting you love me even up to the last moment.

594
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,830
I'll really give it to you...

595
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,630
Really give it to you...

596
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:03,430
What? Aren't you stripping?

597
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,080
This is your miscalculation...

598
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:29,320
<i>This guy is really taking his clothes off.</i>

599
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:35,460
Take off your clothes, quick. You've finally caught on today. It's your miscalculation.

600
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,150
You're dead meat! Well?

601
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,060
Aren't you coming out?

602
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,120
Why wouldn't I be coming out?

603
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,830
Do you do it with words?

604
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,900
You use your body!

605
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,410
He actually likes Soohee but doesn't say it because of Jiahn...

606
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,300
And so, he's always saying that he likes me.

607
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,540
You saw me with another man, don't you want to know why?

608
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:06,050
If we dislike the way things are we won't meet.
We'll visit if we miss each other, that's us.

609
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,320
Be more cool.

610
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,940
Don't you feel mom made the right choice this time?

611
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:26,010
You heard me cry yesterday, right?

612
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:28,330
I didn't know this before.

613
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:31,280
I'm a little bothered now.
