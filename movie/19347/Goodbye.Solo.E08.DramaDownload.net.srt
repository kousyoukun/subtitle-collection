1
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,230
Although I'm really gratefully, I'll act as if I didn't hear this.

2
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:01,510
Alright, I won't request much of Manager Ryu.

3
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,840
Where exactly will Saelim Contruction's next project be located?

4
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,270
You will only need to tell me this, the construction site.

5
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,520
I won't know untill the public annoucements are made.

6
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,910
Why are you like this?

7
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,370
We have lots of fundings on our side.

8
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,530
If you can give us the information, then Manager Ryu..

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,420
Saelim will be finished if I were to say anything.

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,520
Then of course, I'll be finished as well.

11
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,120
I won't do such a dangerous thing.

12
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,940
Then..

13
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,010
That person is very unyielding..

14
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,510
<i>Manager Ryu has met Jung Do-young.</i>

15
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,150
For how long?

16
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,970
I got it.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,410
Be careful, don't let Manager Ryu discover you.

18
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,760
I'm sorry, have you waited long?

19
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,420
Just a while..

20
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,000
Why were you late?

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,830
I met Jung Do-young.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,760
Jung Do-young? Why?

23
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,580
What else can someone like him want?

24
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,790
There's no need to think too much about such things.

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,050
Episode 8

26
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,200
Min-ho, go meet with your mom for a while.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,780
I don't want.

28
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,970
Let's leave after I take a look at her.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,990
If my mom knew that I followed her to the Gallery to have a look at her..

30
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,910
she will be looking out the next time she comes to the Gallery..

31
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,050
to see if I am around or not.

32
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,310
She will be disappointed if I'm not around.

33
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,150
Let's go.

34
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,980
She looks pitiful from her back-view, doesn't she?

35
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,060
It'll be better if I let her go, right?

36
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,500
Looks like I'll have to divorce Min-ho's mom.
What do you think?

37
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,700
Things can only go this way.

38
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:46,370
Hide up well, your hair can be seen .....

39
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,970
I found you...

40
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,890
Oh my, Mom is found.

41
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,640
Mi-ja..

42
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,170
You are so cute.

43
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,530
Our Mi-ja, how did you find mom?

44
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,770
You are really smart.

45
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,710
So cute.

46
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,140
Mom, you must live together with Mi-ja forever.

47
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,980
If mom were to go anywhere, don't ever leave Mi-ja behind.

48
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,440
You must bring me along with you.

49
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,650
Ok, I know.

50
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,380
Oh, cute Mi-ja..

51
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,210
Why can't I even contact her?

52
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,650
Is it that Ji-soo, who lives in Jeju Do?

53
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,440
Boss, you don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it.

54
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,190
I'm really curious about the relationship between Boss and that person in Jeju Do.

55
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,330
You rarely meet and you also made a marriage registration.

56
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,890
Boss said that a gangster have to live on his own.

57
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,640
You will be soft hearted once you have a woman, and that's unacceptable.

58
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,410
Didn't you often say these things?

59
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,880
That's right.

60
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,260
But what can I do when I did something that I have to be responsible for?

61
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,430
That night when I slept with her.

62
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,650
An accident occured and her legs were crippled.

63
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,540
I must really be a lunatic.

64
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,810
She came to find me because she was genuinely in love with me.

65
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,420
But I treated it as a game and slept with her for a night.

66
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,220
So how would she feel when she was returning home?

67
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,590
At the cross road..

68
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,760
This is all my fault and I have to be responsible.

69
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,900
She's a younger sister that I know from the orphanage.

70
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,220
I should have sent her away when she started to become attached to me.

71
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,950
That woman, doesn't she have any family?

72
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,670
If she did, would she have been in the orphanage?

73
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,780
Shin-ji..

74
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,660
Yes, Boss..

75
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,090
Do you know Ma Ki No defense line?

76
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,800
I've heard it before.

77
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,370
To me, Ji-soo is Ma Ki No.

78
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,420
Ma is the last.

79
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,780
Ki, actually I have already reached hell.

80
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,330
No, I'm feeling angry.

81
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,160
I just can't abandon her, no matter how bad a person I am.

82
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,850
This is what I'm thinking.

83
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,450
Then, what about Miss Mi-ri?

84
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,950
Yes!

85
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,690
I suddenly wanted to hear your voice in the middle of work.

86
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,600
Stop playing, end of call.

87
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,370
I got it, I won't play anymore.

88
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,260
Hey!  Can't you use more strength?

89
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,910
Make it cleaner.

90
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,270
Rascal, why aren't you doing it seriously?

91
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,830
I'll go cook the noodles.

92
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,310
Flowers!

93
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,440
They are really pretty.

94
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,960
Min-ho, let's buy a few pots of flowers to decorate the front door.

95
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,630
They're not that great from what I see.

96
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,400
Why? Are they not pretty?

97
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
You are even prettier.

98
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,340
I know, but the flowers are pretty as well.

99
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,400
So let's still buy them.

100
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,140
I'm buying this. That one isn't bad either.

101
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,820
It'll sure be pretty if we place them all mixed together.

102
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,390
How about buying two?

103
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,780
That camera looks really great.

104
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,510
Do you want a camera?

105
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,180
Just a little.

106
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,140
Then, I'll buy it for you.

107
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,050
Since when does women buy gifts for men?

108
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,420
I'm not willing to accept gifts from a woman.

109
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,020
Honestly, shouldn't it feel strange when a man accepts gifts from a woman?

110
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,960
It'll seem like he's not very sensiblel.

111
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,360
Don't you know not to say something like that so directly?

112
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,990
Yes.

113
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,830
Noona will buy it for you.

114
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,140
I'm helping out my Senior with his work this time.
Wait untill I get my paid, understood?

115
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,760
Noona?

116
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,400
Soo-hee..

117
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,900
You.. Hey.. Come here..

118
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:54,410
Got it... Got it...

119
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,480
It's like drinking herb medicine when you use this to drink coffee.

120
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,770
I didn't scrub the bowl.

121
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,240
Really pretty.

122
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,400
Soo-hee..

123
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,810
We.. Let's go to a warm southern island and live there.

124
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,040
Let's decorate our house beautifully just like now.

125
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,050
I'll take pictures of the natives there for the children.

126
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,770
And you can do your art work.

127
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,780
Then when do we earn money?

128
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,810
Am I not hardworking?

129
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,620
We can plough the land together. We can go out at night to do some work.

130
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,560
If that's the case, meals aren't going to be any problems.

131
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,710
Your dream is too small.

132
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,730
Your's isn't anything special either.

133
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:07,050
People all think that dreams of earning big money are the right dreams.
The ones that will show your ambition. But I don't think that way.

134
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,450
And it's a small dream to be living life with the person you love in a simple and happy way.

135
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,160
I can never understand that.

136
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:19,460
Kim Min-ho, that warm southern island..

137
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,640
let's go there together.

138
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,200
We don't have to think of earning lots of money over there.

139
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,060
We only have to think of living our beautiful and simple lives.

140
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,560
Until now how many women have you seduced?

141
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,460
Two other women besides you.

142
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,950
But their answers were all "No".

143
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,280
If your anwer is "No" as well, I won't mention about living on a southern island again.

144
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,790
If that's the case.

145
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,260
My answer is OK.

146
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:58,000
Now, I think that you aren't that bad at all.

147
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,810
Please don't change.

148
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,890
You will die at my hands if you change.

149
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,410
Chung Soo-hee..

150
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,240
You are now saying "OK" to my proposal, do you know?

151
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,750
Yes, I know.

152
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,230
You asked me to come here saying that you have something to say.

153
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,730
I feel uncomfortable just sitting like this.

154
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,420
Just wait a while.

155
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,380
To satisfy your request, let's divorce.

156
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,820
But you must give me a month's time.

157
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,640
The problem about the company's share of power isn't that easy to solve.

158
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,580
It'll take some time to organize a shareholders' meeting.

159
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,890
Leave.

160
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,150
Thank you.

161
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,140
It's my first time hearing thanks from you.

162
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,600
But why is your vioce like that?
It's like you have no strength.

163
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,930
Are you so relieved?

164
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,230
Leave..

165
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,350
You are not comfortable being with me either.

166
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,920
Driver Lee, let's go to the construction site.

167
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,710
I have always wished to do this.

168
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,910
Supervisor Kim, you will be responsible for it.

169
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,050
So please pay more attention.

170
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,810
Yes, I know.

171
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,160
That.. 318 building, why is it taking so long to set up the electrical power there?

172
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,680
Yes.. because of extensions to the building, we are now redesigning it.

173
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,790
There's one part that needs to be extended.

174
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,000
I'll be responsible for it.

175
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,040
You must make sure that it tallies with the standard set.

176
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,040
Yes..

177
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,780
Let's go look at the 303 Building

178
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:40,810
I decided to divorce your dad.

179
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,000
When I think about the divorce..

180
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,200
the first person that I felt sorry towards was you.

181
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,680
Always.

182
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,950
You are always saying that you are sorry towards me.

183
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,450
I have already grown warts in my ears from hearing mom saying sorry to me.

184
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,900
So there's no need to say that again.

185
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,590
Min-jae..

186
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:21,030
That's your selfishness to want understanding from everyone.

187
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,970
Mom, just live your own life the way you want.

188
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,070
And I'll live mines. Let's just go on with our lives like this.

189
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,490
I'll come again.

190
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,660
I've finished, you can come down now.

191
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,890
Have I completed all the tests?

192
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,290
Yes..

193
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,100
When will the results be out?

194
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,710
Just come again three days from now.

195
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,020
You've worked hard.

196
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,200
It was hard on you too.

197
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,160
It's still not painful yet.

198
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,850
But there maybe pain later.

199
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,920
It's still not the conditions to be worrying about yet.

200
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,240
Eun-mi, if... if Mom get sick..

201
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,170
will you come to Seoul to visit me?

202
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,560
Daughters are still best.

203
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,400
You said " Of course" right away, eventhough you're so far away.

204
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:26,560
I'm sorry for not discussing about the divorce from your dad with you guys.

205
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,520
So you said it's alright.

206
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,590
You must be living well in America, you are so cool.

207
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,350
So it's like that, ok.

208
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,350
Go to sleep, ok.

209
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,520
Mom loves you too.

210
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,520
Yes.. Yes..

211
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,540
Mr. Kim Min-jae!

212
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,390
I might have gotten ill.

213
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,820
Let's meet again next time.

214
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,700
That kid..

215
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,170
She's walking everywhere again looking so dirty.

216
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,640
Who's her mom anyway?

217
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,900
No.. I won't give.

218
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,310
So as to say, these buildings are all built by me?

219
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,670
The market seller's son..

220
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:13,440
has become the nation's best contruction company chairman.

221
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,270
I'm considered successful, aren't I?

222
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:27,850
My dad was in the dairy business, and my mother sold soup rice in the market place.

223
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,130
My two younger sisters never even set foot beyond the school's gates.

224
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,000
They helped my mother deliver the soup rice.

225
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:42,870
But because I am a son, they allowed me to graduate from middle school.

226
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,670
And later, I started to earn money, fighting with my life.

227
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,610
I was lucky to be promoted to a manager.

228
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,560
And even became the son in-law of a good family.

229
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:00,550
I built sea water buildings and sold them at high prices.

230
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,500
I bought houses from the poor at low prices, demolished them and built high rise buildings.

231
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,650
I have suffered lots of scoldings but I never bothered about them either.

232
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:16,240
The younger brothers are suffering hunger.

233
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,270
The aged parents are still going around to earn a living.

234
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:31,170
The feelings of guilt, what a joke.

235
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,070
Let's go somewhere for a drink.

236
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,540
Drink it slowly.

237
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,250
It's alright.

238
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,420
Uncle, how did you and Aunty meet?

239
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:15,750
Because my company was developing very fast, and that became a threat to my in-law's company..

240
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,040
my in-law suggested that we merge together.

241
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:27,390
He didn't want any betrayal between us, so he married Min-ho's mom to me.

242
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,260
I, who never received a good education, married a woman both beautiful and university educated.

243
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,860
I never thought I was a success until that point in my life.

244
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,660
My wife was crying every night because she didn't love me.

245
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,120
But I felt that it was better that way.

246
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,480
I should have treated her better.

247
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,450
Perhaps it was my pride.

248
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,540
I get angry when I see her.

249
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,160
That's why we get angry everyday and fight.

250
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,840
I scream loudly because I thought I was great.

251
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,200
I told Min-ho's mom that we are going to end it.

252
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,470
I have never done anything for her after living together for so long.

253
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,410
She wants a separation.

254
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,570
I should at least give in to that request.

255
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,970
Bring more wine over here.

256
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,000
I suddenly miss Min-ho... that fellow.

257
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,970
You are already tired from painting the house. Aren't you too tired to still come to work?

258
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,200
I have nothing, but my physical strength is still conisidered pretty good, right?

259
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,030
Wait..

260
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,500
Hello..

261
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,660
Ji-ahn, it's you.

262
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,180
My dad?

263
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,980
Why?

264
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,670
I'm not going.

265
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,580
He is very drunk?

266
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,730
I got it, I'll go.

267
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,490
Yes..

268
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,710
My dad said that he wants to see me after he got drunk.

269
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,660
I'll come back after a while.

270
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,000
Just go inside and I'll see you later.

271
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,230
Ok, just go.

272
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,250
[Ba Ju City.. Ju Ahn Ri.. No.118]

273
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,410
Dad, I'm leaving.

274
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,510
Dad, I'm leaving now.

275
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:48,780
Please stay healthy, and please tell mom I will contact her.

276
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,750
Crazy fellow.

277
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,250
He asked for a busy person to come over just so he can leave like that?

278
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,410
He always does as he pleases. He hasn't changed that habit at all.

279
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,970
Uncle..., he really misses you.

280
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,240
Then, why did he leave?

281
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,350
He doesn't have the courage.

282
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,250
He hates me and is not willing to see me.

283
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:46,150
You may not know it, but Uncle really loves you a lot.

284
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:55,780
He's been mentioning about you lately, and he has said he's sorry.

285
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,400
There's nothing to be sorry about.

286
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,250
He's has been very good towards someone else's son.

287
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,160
You've already learned the truth, right?

288
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,470
I'm not my dad's son.

289
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,710
I'm not saying as it's difficult for me to explain.

290
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,430
But, Min-ho..

291
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,100
You are not someone else's son to Uncle.

292
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,730
I'm grateful to you for saying these things.

293
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,370
I understand my own dad.

294
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,230
He can't be bothered about anyone besides himself.

295
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:58,880
Sorry, I shouldn't have thrown my temper at you.

296
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,930
Let's go to the roadside stalls for a drink.

297
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,800
Until now, I still don't feel comfortable around you.

298
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:19,250
Do you really feel bad?

299
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:31,320
Isn't Soo-hee a really good woman?

300
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,960
I'm leaving.

301
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:27,720
How many pairs of fathers and sons are able to get along well in this world?

302
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,790
I think that there are lots of sons who also love their dads.

303
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,080
But there aren't too many sons who can get along well with their dads.

304
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:38,080
Ever since I was a child, I've only heard three words come out of my dad..

305
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:43,700
idiot, crazy, and no prospects.

306
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,250
I'm an idiot because I'm not good at studying.

307
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,750
I'm quite good in worthless things like sports, so I'm crazy.

308
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:58,710
I have no prospects because I can only smile with embarrassment when I'm scolded.

309
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,060
And so..

310
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:07,190
whenever my dad wasn't home, I would be so happy like it was my birthday.

311
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,250
Even so, didn't he say that he wanted to see you today?

312
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,710
I don't believe those words.

313
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,200
Wouldn't it still be the same after he wakes up from his drunkeness?

314
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,250
You've become really jaded.

315
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,130
Why? Are you disappointed because I'm a little jaded?

316
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,070
You didn't have a good relationship with your dad for a long time.

317
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,590
Then one day, he suddenly says that he wanted to see you.

318
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,300
Don't you think that in his heart he doesn't really hate you?

319
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,260
Me, too.. Even if my mom comes to visit me smilingly.

320
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,220
I'll get really nervous, thinking that something must have happened.

321
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,990
But you never really know, right?

322
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,170
I think I'm fighting out a battle with someone here.  Are you wanting to fight?

323
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,230
You are like a bad child.

324
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:08,370
But because you are a little jaded, I feel much better.

325
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:13,680
I'll be by your side to correct you whenever you get jaded like this.

326
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,350
I don't want to be like when I was young, fighting everyday in the house.

327
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,010
So, let's not fight when we are together.

328
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,300
It won't be the end even if we fight.

329
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,730
Just tell each other the truth.

330
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,120
We'll understand one another after we've talked about it.

331
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,380
Why aren't you replying?

332
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,290
Are we going to be able to keep all the promises we made?

333
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:59,180
I suddenly feel that we've made too many promises.

334
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,230
Is it because of me that you can't sleep well?

335
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,590
Sorry..

336
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:26,450
I can't sleep because I proposed to Soo-hee yesterday.

337
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:38,040
The answer was "Yes".  I'm even more sleepless because of that.

338
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,950
But Granny, I still feel really bad.

339
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:50,650
No one has ever kept all their promises to me.

340
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:56,800
I thought that it will ease the hearts of my father and brother when I left home.
But it hasn't worked out that way.

341
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:02,500
And my mother who says it's enough just to be with me, still feels lonely when she's around me.

342
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,560
My first love, Mi-ri too.

343
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,170
She said that she would come to me after leaving Ji-ahn, but she went to Ho-chul instead. 

344
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,560
I'm afraid that Soo-hee will be like that too.

345
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,660
My proposal to Soo-hee is already accepted.

346
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,070
Really... can she really come with me to live in a warm southern island?

347
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,860
I wanted to ask her 10 times.. 20 times.. without stopping.

348
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,320
But I didn't do it because I was scared that she might regret her answer.

349
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,290
Did I do well?

350
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,370
It's not good?

351
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,350
That's right, it doesn't seem good either.

352
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:51,050
I shouldn't have asked.  I should have gone home to think whether or not it was true, right?

353
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,630
I can only do things that way, right?

354
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,820
But I have no other way to be with her.

355
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,770
It's putting off my own determination.

356
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:08,340
You think that I'm a coward, right?

357
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,110
Granny..

358
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:29,840
It's enough for you to know that I'm a coward, understand?

359
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,760
We often slept together like this when I first left home.

360
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,880
We haven't slept like this for a very long time.

361
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:50,320
Granny, if Soo-hee isn't going to go with me..

362
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:55,120
Granny, let's go there together.

363
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:14,890
I'm tired now, I'll sleep if you keep patting me.

364
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,120
When can we start working?
It will be better for me if we can start sooner.

365
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:27,930
I still need more time as I still have other work at hand.

366
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,010
Over at the Cafe too.
I have other things that I need some time to settle as well.

367
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,390
I have no problem waiting either 3 or 4 days for.

368
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,710
Here is the money for your hardwork.

369
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,950
Thanks.

370
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,950
Right, where is that cafe located?

371
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,550
At Ba Ju's side.

372
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,700
You are saying Ba Ju, right?

373
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,040
[Ba Ju City.. Ju Ahn Ri.. No.118]

374
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,250
Yes..

375
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,990
You sound really well from your voice.

376
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,590
You must be feeling really good.

377
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,590
Have you been living well?

378
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:24,100
Quite good, besides thinking of you sometimes and some heartaches.

379
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,990
I transferred some money to you.

380
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,030
Isn't today the day to pay your rent?

381
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,650
Ji-ahn, please don't be like this.
It'll burden me to you.

382
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,250
Don't feel burdened. I did it willingly.

383
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,180
Even if you say that, I will still feel burdened to you.

384
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,350
I won't accept it.

385
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:49,930
Soo-hee, why are you so cold towards me?

386
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,330
Sorry..

387
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,380
Just accept it if you feel sorry. I'm hanging up now.

388
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,620
Ji-ahn..

389
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,670
[Soo-hee, he is very good at lying. Sometimes, the lies that he spoke..]

390
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,490
[He can even believe them to be truths.]

391
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,470
[Soo-hee, he's going to let out the truth right now.]

392
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,080
[Soo-hee, why must he start to tell lies?]

393
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,310
[Soo-hee, he doesn't want to end it here.]

394
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,100
[Ba Ju City.. Ju Ahn Ri.. No.118]

395
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,850
Thank you.

396
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,350
You are really pretty.

397
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,760
Isn't this that little girl?

398
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:35,490
Hey, don't speak any more nonsense and teach this girl a lesson!

399
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,560
Hey, girl! You really have no upbringings?

400
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,130
How dare you play around with us?!

401
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,120
You are looking to die, right?!

402
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,330
Hey, thief! Just speak if you have a mouth!

403
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:51,570
I'm asking you to speak!

404
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,940
Are you thinking of not speaking till the end?!

405
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,990
Why are you falling down?!

406
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,260
Those students..

407
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,710
What are you doing?

408
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,930
Ahjuma, what are you doing?

409
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,520
You just wait a while, Girl. I'll deal with you after I've dealt with her.

410
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,740
You will all die if you dare to touch her again.

411
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,660
Where do you live? Are you a gangster?

412
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,540
Girl, you are a student so you should behave like one.

413
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,440
How can you be hitting your friend at the roadside in broad daylight?

414
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:22,170
Where are your parents?! Where?!

415
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,370
You, Ahjuma!

416
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,090
Where do you think you're going?!

417
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,450
That girl, she stole our money.

418
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,880
Because she's from a poor family and none of us really wanted to play with her!

419
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:34,470
We took her out to play, but she still betrayed us and stole our money!

420
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,180
What?

421
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,980
Tell me, is she telling the truth?

422
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,850
You, nasty girl.

423
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:51,340
And you all... no matter what the reason, how can you be hitting your friend?

424
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,360
If my friend doesn't have any money, I'll give it to her immediately.

425
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,980
So why must you hit her? Bad children..

426
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,330
Violence, regardless of any reason, is a bad thing.

427
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,160
How much has she stolen from you?

428
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,730
It's 8000 won from me and my friends.

429
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,360
It's only because of 8000 won.

430
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,410
You are really shameless.

431
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,110
Here..

432
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:25,930
8000 won I'm returning for her. Use the rest of the money to buy rice cakes for yourselves.

433
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,870
You, too.. return home quickly.

434
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,440
Why are you still crying?

435
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,050
Oh my, why are kids these days like this?

436
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,720
Unni! Where did you say the Kimchi was?!

437
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,030
It's in the white container on the bottom right side of the fridge.

438
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,730
There are a few white containers here!

439
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,970
You really like to make my head hurt don't you?

440
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,070
Isn't it there on the right? The white container.

441
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,900
There are two of them.

442
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,200
I said it, right? It's the one below.

443
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,610
Come out..

444
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,990
Isn't it here?

445
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,370
Oh, below..

446
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,130
Sorry.

447
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,390
Unni, what's this?

448
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,860
My wedding dress..

449
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,950
I brought it over when I moved house.

450
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,660
I was just thinking of throwing it away or..

451
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,410
Unni, throw it to me if you want to throw it away.

452
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,490
Really..

453
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,320
The real wedding is already so troublesome, so why must you think of going through with a fake one?

454
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:41,450
Stop thinking of those nonsense and get out quickly.
I couldn't get anything out because I wasted my attentions on you.

455
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,570
Quickly, why aren't you leaving?

456
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,590
It's my dream. Didn't you say that you will fulfill any of my dreams?

457
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,610
After a gentleman says something, there's nothing he can do to take it back.

458
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,100
Stop it..

459
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,550
Nothing he can do to take it back.

460
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,450
You are using that look again. Your eye balls are coming out.

461
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,510
Carry on doing your business!

462
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,140
Aren't you buying too much?

463
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:13,020
Although it's a small wedding ceremony, I have to get these.

464
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:17,000
What do you mean by ceremony?

465
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,040
There's such a thing.

466
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,780
You like this, right?

467
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,810
Oh, what's that?

468
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:32,080
Why does that look like Ji-ahn's back view?

469
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,640
Let's go.

470
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,190
Are you still contacting Ji-ahn sometimes?

471
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,720
Sometimes..

472
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,180
Are you now in love with Min-ho and Ji-ahn, both of them?

473
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,930
You are thinking of holding on to two rabbits with both hands, right?

474
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,270
But you can't think that way. You must cut away completely from Ji-ahn.

475
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,930
Don't pretend to be kind, you will make people confused that way.

476
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:23,800
Choi Mi-ri, I know that you are very smart.

477
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,550
But don't pretend to be kind, friendships are supposed to be like that.

478
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,640
I have already given Ji-ahn a really big, painful blow.

479
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,590
So do you want me to give him another?

480
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,740
Will I be able to endure it if that's the case?

481
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,940
I have no confident.

482
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,570
We met because of fate.

483
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,680
And we broke up because I had a change of heart.

484
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,850
From Min-ho's point of view, I was like a married woman.

485
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,960
But Mi-ri, because you're my friend, I felt a bit wronged right now.

486
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:05,000
Don't you think that I still need some time? Can't you understand me?

487
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:17,710
I'm always so thickheaded. I really should die.

488
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:26,470
You are really pretty, and the dress really suits you too.

489
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,450
I'm finally realizing my dream.

490
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,160
I have always wanted to wear a wedding dress since I was young.

491
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,740
And so, aren't you wearing it now?

492
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,160
I want to be good to Mister.

493
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:47,560
My mom once asked me,
"Will a gangster like him be able to let you wear the wedding dress like you've always wanted?"

494
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,250
"It's alright, even if I don't get to wear it."

495
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,880
"And so.. don't bother about me, ok.."

496
00:48:55,910 --> 00:49:00,700
At that time, I thought that it didn't matter.

497
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:10,400
But I feel really happy wearing this right now.

498
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:21,130
Yes, Min-ho.

499
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,410
I see.

500
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,770
Ok, I'm hanging up now.

501
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:35,330
That gangster isn't coming?

502
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,300
Yes..

503
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,110
Let's drink some wine.

504
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:01,270
Why are you following me?
Why are you staring at me?

505
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,580
Is there something you want to hear from me?

506
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:08,240
What are you going to do about Mi-ri?

507
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,440
Ahjuma, bring me another bowl.

508
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:18,950
Although I'm the type of person who can't be bothered with other people's business,
I have to stick my nose in this this time.

509
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,080
If you've only been playing around with Mi-ri, this is your chance to break up with her.

510
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,340
Your current girlfriend now is called Soo-hee.

511
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,380
I heard that you've already liked her long before.

512
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,150
Why? Is it funny?

513
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,940
For me to be a single hearted man?

514
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,710
Rascal, why must you be so rash when you haven't heard all I wanted to say yet?

515
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,530
You want to fight?

516
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:49,020
You should finish listening to my good words. I wanted to say that I envy you.

517
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,910
Rascal, you are a real man.

518
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:55,900
It's not the actions of a real man to be playing around. That's really improper.

519
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,340
Don't learn to be like me, got it?

520
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,360
Stay loyal to one woman. You're alright in my point of view.

521
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,260
Hyung, then you must also treat Mi-ri..

522
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,140
Ahjuma!

523
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,340
Yes!

524
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,580
I'm cancelling the Wu Dong.

525
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:20,180
I'm a bad person. I'm bad from the core.
So I just can't do it, understand?

526
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,690
Why can't you?

527
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,450
How can you say that you can't when you haven't tried it?

528
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:38,160
A guy like him is as cute as a girl.

529
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,010
Ahjuma, I want some Soju over here.

530
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:45,770
Min-ho doesn't want to see me like this, so he made an excuse to go to the cafe.

531
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,290
That's right, my looks are still not bad.

532
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,330
He has always been pitying me.

533
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,120
Speaking of friendship, he's really great.

534
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,590
There's something that I really want to ask.

535
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:05,550
I know that you really want to have kids and a wedding.

536
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:11,200
But that Mister doesn't take any of it to heart.

537
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,690
I'm really angry about it as a friend.

538
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,480
But why are you so tolerant to Mister?

539
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,930
You think that I'm really pitiful, right?

540
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,770
Seeing me stick to a gangster who doesn't even have a good temper..

541
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,450
makes you really unhappy, right?

542
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:33,300
Really, even if you give him away people wouldn't take him. So why are you like this, Girl?

543
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,620
What you don't know is..

544
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:43,740
if that gangster is the monkey king, then I'll be the palm of the Ru Lai Buddha.

545
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,520
Does it look like I'm really afraid that he will leave me?

546
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,450
Does he have anywhere else to go if he leaves me?

547
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,340
To be honest, no one else in this world will like that gangster besides me.

548
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:08,280
I, too.. have been seeing this and that guy.

549
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,730
But who can understand it, if it's not him?

550
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,030
I really want to have children.

551
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:19,220
I really want to be married, too.

552
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:24,880
But, my friend and Unni..

553
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:29,640
it's not love to be doing only things I like.

554
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,820
To be doing things that he likes, that's love.

555
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,410
Isn't that so?

556
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,390
Yes, that's right.

557
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,010
Hey, don't talk about those useless things.

558
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,520
I did everything that the man in my house liked, but we still ended up divorcing.

559
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,710
Unni's ex husband wanted nothing esle but a divorce.

560
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,180
This kid is still rather smart.

561
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,110
Right, how are you getting along with Min-ho?

562
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,130
You don't think of Ji-ahn or anything esle, right?

563
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,360
I still think.. Sometimes..

564
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,390
When?

565
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:18,930
It's only sometimes, when I'm together with Min-ho.

566
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,390
That I had good times like this with Ji-ahn, that's all.

567
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,950
He doesn't have many friends either.

568
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:32,420
And I'm also a little worried about how has he been doing lately.

569
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:37,150
I can't do anything either since things are already this way.

570
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,700
Ji-ahn is a strong person.

571
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,620
Your concern is unnecessary.

572
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:45,250
I know all about Ji-ahn and what an evil person he really is.

573
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:50,060
That's why I said, not to worry about him.
Chung Soo-hee, it's enough for you to live well yourself.

574
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,620
I really want it to be like that.

575
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,160
That's really good.

576
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:01,870
Red wine.. Candles.. It's really like the American movies.

577
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,840
It makes me remember the past.

578
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:10,300
You also had times that you lit up candles like this in the past?

579
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:17,070
Yes, during the newly married period, when my husband and I loved each other more than anything else.

580
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:21,900
The room... Everywhere... We had more candles lit up than even in this room.

581
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,710
Even more then here?

582
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,220
It must have been really romantic.

583
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,570
It was still alright after an hour.

584
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:32,800
But I thought we would die when we ran out of oxygen.

585
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,450
Hey, You!

586
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,190
It's so funny! It's really funny!

587
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:41,270
Unni, that's really funny!

588
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,990
Nasty girl, you!

589
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,150
These things haven't been eaten yet, what are we to do?

590
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:58,280
Take your heavy arms away.

591
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,230
Hey, what are you doing?

592
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,710
Why are you so bad when you sleep?

593
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:19,450
<i>Mister, there's a picture of me wearing the wedding dress in my handphone.</i>

594
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,970
<i>It's really pretty. Please take a look for once.</i>

595
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:22,940
<i>And also..</i>

596
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:28,010
<i>I'll promise to not do things that Mister doesn't like me to do.</i>

597
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:32,030
<i>Because I love you, very much.</i>

598
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,660
Is there a princess that is so beautiful?

599
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,210
Like a fairy, right?

600
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,220
And an angel, too.

601
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,510
I'm so embarrassed.

602
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:02,520
Why must you always finish what I have to say for me?

603
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,390
That's so true.

604
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,550
Just sleep, sleep..

605
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:23,260
Teacher Kim?

606
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,460
Hello, Mister is not here at the moment..

607
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:31,290
Where are you calling from?

608
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:37,030
Je Ju Do? What's the matter?

609
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,160
You're saying Ji-soo is ill?

610
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:45,320
Hello.. Hello..

611
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,920
Why is she so anxious?

612
00:57:56,350 --> 00:58:00,570
Je Ju Do.. Ji-soo..

613
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:05,650
It seems like it's time for us to finally fight it out for once.

614
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,980
Why do you live like this?

615
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:17,330
Pretending to be a deaf and dumb person.

616
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,730
You even changed your name from Bok-hee to Lee Mi-young.

617
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:36,210
The people around you and at the market all call you by this new name.

618
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,250
You are scared that I'll let out the truth, right?

619
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,330
Although we are a pair of mother and daughter without any blood relations,
but aren't we as bound to one another as life and death?

620
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:48,710
You seem so scared of me now.

621
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:54,570
Just talk, New Mother..

622
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:58,700
Just answer my questions.

623
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:16,080
I heard the people around here saying that you are quite rich.

624
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,610
Is it really a lot?

625
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,030
I need money.

626
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,700
Give me money.

627
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,760
You are still not going to speak?

628
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:46,660
But, it doesn't mean that I won't take it if you won't give it to me.

629
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:51,930
I became tough and poisonous after you left.

630
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,500
I became like this all because of you.

631
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:02,550
You are even worse than dad, you are even worse.

632
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:07,560
Right, did you know?

633
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:11,530
Dad died after you left.

634
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,690
Although I hated dad.

635
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,860
But as his child, I feel that I should take revenge.

636
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:22,350
Isn't that so?

637
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:40,230
<i>I'm sorry, Ji-ahn. I didn't think of contacting you orginally.</i>

638
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,400
<i>But the situation is too urgent..</i>

639
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,170
<i>Seong-yi's kid is in danger, please come over quickly.</i>

640
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:56,120
I just got off the bus, so just tell me.

641
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:59,430
I bought everything needed from the hardware shop this morning.

642
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,710
So where are you now?

643
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,700
What? Messages?

644
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:09,310
I think that it's a joke as well, but I just can't stop thinking about it.

645
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,860
And this is the address in the messages.

646
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:16,200
So I decided to take a look, to confirm everything.

647
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:22,570
There's no need to come. I can handle things here myself.

648
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:27,640
I know, I'll contact you if I find anything fishy.

649
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:32,340
I'll go back immediately. I'm hanging up now.

650
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,280
[Ba Ju City.. Ju Ahn Ri.. No.118]

651
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:55,140
Excuse me, can you tell me where No.118 is?

652
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:59,750
Chung Soo-hee, this kid really doesn't listen.

653
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:04,620
But why is she thinking of it?

654
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,750
