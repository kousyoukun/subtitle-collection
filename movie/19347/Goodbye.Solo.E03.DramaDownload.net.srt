1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:03,394
Yeah, he treats me like that.

2
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,147
You really don’t want to go together

3
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:02,747
The subway is very fast.
I’ll take the subway

4
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:05,248
You must be tired too. Go on now

5
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:08,170
Oh yes

6
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:14,843
It’s my mother’s birthday next
week. Please pass this on to her for me

7
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,184
Why don’t you give it to her yourself?

8
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:25,028
Go on now, quickly

9
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:27,828
7pm at Susi Hotel. Come
over if you change your mind

10
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:29,110
Go on

11
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,147
Let’s go

12
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:35,219
Ok, see you

13
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:38,341
Looks like it’s going to
rain soon. Better get going

14
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:39,529
Ok

15
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,218
Looks like you’ve
become closer with Min-ho

16
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:56,940
Huh?

17
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:59,932
How fortunate. The two of
you are getting along better

18
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:43,013
All right. Why don’t I say it first

19
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:48,532
About yesterday, it’s ok with me

20
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,362
Anybody, when stuck with a man…

21
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:56,350
…in a house overnight and
not in her usual frame of mind

22
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,157
That is my slippage

23
00:02:59,241 --> 00:02:59,866
Soo-hee

24
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:02,859
In that kind of a situation, it
is still best to not say anything

25
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:08,185
I’m sorry. It’s a mistake.
It won’t happen again

26
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:11,085
Other than these there’s
really nothing else to say

27
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,344
Just take it as an emotion
of the fleeting moment

28
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:20,450
What else can we do?
Things are already like that

29
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:27,217
Let’s not tell Ji-ahn about this

30
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:32,702
Sometimes being too honest can be
hurtful. He doesn’t need to know about this

31
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:40,807
What are your thoughts?

32
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:48,724
You’re not the only one
feeling awkward. I am too

33
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:17,869
Rascal. If I weren’t there then,
you would have been dead, rascal!

34
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,926
How frightened you were
when you saw those gangsters

35
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:24,605
Frightened? Who was frightened?
It was you who was frightened

36
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:26,271
Me? “You said me? Brother…we are…”

37
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:30,776
You were frightened first…who was that?

38
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:32,353
You saw?

39
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,687
Weren’t you like that?

40
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:38,011
So sorry. So sorry

41
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,550
Why are they blocking others’ path?

42
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,526
Kim Min-ho. It was your fault

43
00:04:54,735 --> 00:04:58,184
Sorry. Please hold on for a while. Sorry

44
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:06,069
An apology would have sufficed. Why
did you buy the toothpicks as well?

45
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:11,753
Just leave them around. Leave
them around. I’ll use them anyway

46
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:52,623
<i>I can’t even pass him
a word of my pining</i>

47
00:06:52,984 --> 00:07:01,657
<i>The years have pass, but no matter
how I try, I simply cannot forget</i>

48
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:10,006
<i>Holding the liquor glass,
I dedicate this song to love</i>

49
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:18,779
<i>Men, men, I hate the
tears I leave for the men</i>

50
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,946
What is this?! In the middle of
the night! This is really too much

51
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,359
Hello? Hello!

52
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,336
Open the door now! This is too much!

53
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,076
Mi-ri, what’s going on?

54
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:38,408
Are you deaf? Can’t you hear?

55
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:46,746
<i>I want to leave with you, yet I cannot</i>

56
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,580
<i>No matter how long it takes,
I will find you, right?</i>

57
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,900
<i>Over the mountains, pass the ocean</i>

58
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:01,893
It’s the middle of the night! Why is
she not sleeping? What is this? Really!

59
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:05,420
Why is she not coming out?
What is she trying to do?

60
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:09,893
Oh…it stopped. She’s
not singing anymore

61
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:16,383
It’s quiet now. Go away

62
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,949
I can’t believe this!

63
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:22,546
Is this woman crazy?

64
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,465
I can’t believe this! This is really!

65
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,491
She started singing at 4am.

66
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,857
At first I thought it would stop soon

67
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:36,008
But she continued on for two
hours plus. She wouldn't stop!

68
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:38,801
After the entire building was at her
doorsteps, her voice finally became tired

69
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:40,418
There were no songs she didn’t know

70
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,851
Fast songs; dance numbers; pop songs

71
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:47,318
She’s driving everybody crazy.
You heard what she said just now

72
00:08:48,338 --> 00:08:49,791
“It’s quiet now. Go away”.

73
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,126
A complete scoundrel. Scoundrel!

74
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:55,083
All my life I’ve seen
all kinds of crazy women

75
00:08:56,528 --> 00:09:00,503
Hey, your house is just ahead.
Why are you showering here instead?

76
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:03,197
There’s no warm water at my place

77
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:08,061
This belongs to the uncle.
Why are you using it?

78
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,842
Can’t I even borrow it?

79
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:10,702
No

80
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:22,595
Want some coffee?

81
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,601
Nope

82
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:29,053
Right, how was the trip to Jeju island
with Soo-hee? I haven’t asked yet.

83
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:30,302
Was it good?

84
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:34,906
Not good?

85
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:38,488
It wasn’t much?

86
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,221
You’re just going to give me
all these vague answers huh?

87
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:46,414
Do you think I don’t know you?

88
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:49,207
Didn’t you fall for her the first
time you laid eyes on Soo-hee?

89
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:54,989
Dare you deny it? Why is your
drawer full of her photos?

90
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,660
I peeped. You can report
me to the police if you want

91
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:06,232
Your heart will collapse if
you keep cooping it all up

92
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,578
That’s my business

93
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:09,123
That’s my friend’s business

94
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:13,033
If you’re miserable,
I will be miserable too

95
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,897
When my father was cleaning up,
when he was knocked down by the truck

96
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,492
I helped you, so you’re very grateful

97
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:26,571
You said you liked Ho-chul,
and you want to break up with me

98
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:33,716
You didn’t two-time me, but told me
honestly. I’m very grateful for that

99
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,329
I said to continue as friends

100
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,217
You agreed. I’m also very grateful

101
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:46,971
About Soo-hee, you knew but didn’t
say a thing. I’m also very grateful

102
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:54,625
So, help me one more time, Mi-ri

103
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:00,310
Just ignore me now

104
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,285
The coffee is really good. Have a cup?

105
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:24,495
Ok. Oh yes. Can I borrow your car today?

106
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:25,847
For what?

107
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:31,237
Don’t ask? Ok, got it

108
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:38,385
Who’s that? Who’s there?

109
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:48,015
Tell me which is a good
restaurant around here

110
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,546
Not operating? Anybody around?

111
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,759
This is really good.

112
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,175
Do you do delivery?

113
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:08,796
I said, do you do delivery?

114
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:16,614
[No]

115
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:22,500
You can’t talk?

116
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:27,724
Can you hear?

117
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,343
Then how do you know what I’m saying?

118
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,820
Oh, you read people’s lips

119
00:14:58,369 --> 00:14:59,946
You’ve dyed them with peach water

120
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,797
How pretty

121
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:23,840
Ah. You store the peaches in the
freezer so you can dye even in winter

122
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:25,548
I didn’t know

123
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,131
My mother loved peach water too

124
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:46,508
Granny

125
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:49,466
This is really infuriating

126
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:51,406
Granny, we’re hungry

127
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:58,372
The two over there. What’re your names?

128
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:00,966
Neighbours should
know each others’ names

129
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:04,192
I’m Kim Min-ho.
She’s Choi Mi-ri

130
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:08,660
Hey, who allowed you to tell
my name to strangers, now?

131
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:10,173
Are the two of you friends?

132
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:12,572
I don’t feel like talking to you

133
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:15,989
Come over to my place tonight for a
house-warming party! Come, both of you

134
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:19,440
I’m preparing to order Chinese food

135
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:23,310
“Miracle” is the most
well-known in Korea

136
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,211
They do it the authentic way. The best

137
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:27,104
Auntie

138
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:29,009
I prefer “sister” better

139
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,820
Forget it.

140
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:33,943
You have such an outstanding professor
as a husband and you have your children

141
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:35,783
Just ask your family over to eat instead

142
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:42,162
Also, please. I really don’t
want to talk to you, Auntie.

143
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:44,464
So please don’t talk to me

144
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:48,506
You talk so much. Just
say you don’t want to come

145
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:03,587
Completely defeated by her

146
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:05,459
Agree

147
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:34,495
Continue your surgical studies

148
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:37,650
I can’t

149
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:43,497
You’ve got such a good
mind, why can’t you continue?

150
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:46,790
I’ll pay for everything

151
00:17:54,995 --> 00:18:02,018
Rascal. I was so happy when he
said he wants to become a doctor

152
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:07,979
Behind my back, specialise
in animal nerves. Crazy

153
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:15,272
One didn’t complete his high school.
One went to a third-grade university

154
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:18,920
The other becomes a useless doctor

155
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,647
Only dad thinks that animal nerves
study is useless. Others don’t think so

156
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:28,844
Are you looking down on me now?

157
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:34,605
Ji-ahn, the food here
is pretty good. Have more

158
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,384
Little rascal

159
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,051
Uncle

160
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:06,546
So-hee’s handphone may be out of
battery. I called but she won’t pick up

161
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,610
Can you go over to Soo-hee’s
place and have a look?

162
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:13,127
I can’t because I can’t
leave uncle here alone

163
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,116
I can’t go over now

164
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,625
Please. We agreed to
meet at 9pm. Please go now

165
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:26,879
All right. I’ll go. Hanging up

166
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,373
Was it me being stubborn
today again, losing my temper?

167
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:58,620
I especially hated it when my
father flared at the dining table

168
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:01,348
But I’m completely like him now

169
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:10,317
I’m getting old. I should
control my temper a little

170
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,339
Hello

171
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:02,494
When did you start following?

172
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:06,181
You got me

173
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:08,120
From the hotel?

174
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,869
Let me have a look at you

175
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:15,283
Pull over

176
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:21,072
Nope. I got caught. Going
off. It’s no fun anymore

177
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:27,447
The brooch. It’s very pretty

178
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:30,350
Haven’t I got the eyes?

179
00:21:33,073 --> 00:21:34,446
Let me have a look at you

180
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:39,752
Let’s have another surprise
meeting like that next month

181
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:41,661
Hanging up

182
00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:48,832
Why are you here?

183
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:55,078
Didn’t you arrange to meet Ji-ahn at the café?
Why are you here instead of waiting there?

184
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:58,195
It’s past the agreed time.
I thought he’s not turning up

185
00:22:58,656 --> 00:22:59,675
Why didn’t you pick up your calls?

186
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:02,245
I don’t know. It got shut off on its own

187
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:08,750
Ji-ahn was worrying for nothing.
You’re having fun on your own here

188
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:11,810
My job is done. I’m off

189
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:15,726
I have to go over to Mi-ri’s place

190
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,932
Mi-ri’s drawing is done.
I have to show it to her

191
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,447
Follow me. My car is at the parking lot

192
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:39,018
Gone anywhere?

193
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:41,748
I went to see my mum

194
00:23:43,062 --> 00:23:43,752
Your mum?

195
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:46,084
Meet?

196
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,684
I heard from Ji-ahn you
don’t meet each other

197
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:54,936
Loud-mouth

198
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,233
It’s hot in the car

199
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,127
Soo-hee! It’s so beautiful!
This drawing is so beautiful

200
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,610
Draw for our café customers too!

201
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:42,404
If you do, it’ll definitely
draw a lot of customers there!

202
00:24:43,258 --> 00:24:44,411
I’m not a professional at sketching

203
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,642
What professional. As long as
you get the drawing out it’ll do

204
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:48,056
Do it!

205
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:54,888
I’ll pay you. I’ll pay you

206
00:24:56,368 --> 00:24:57,287
I’ll consider

207
00:24:58,602 --> 00:24:59,358
It’s a deal

208
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:02,283
Uncle! This is me!

209
00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:04,555
What?

210
00:25:05,115 --> 00:25:06,529
I said it’s me in the drawing

211
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:08,301
What did she say?

212
00:25:14,707 --> 00:25:18,651
Really! Is this woman crazy? What is
she doing in the middle of the night?

213
00:25:19,526 --> 00:25:20,553
Having a birthday party I suppose

214
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:22,722
I really can’t take it anymore

215
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:25,417
Don’t interfere

216
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,190
What don’t interfere?

217
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:31,101
Weren’t you the one who asked the woman
to call her family over and have fun?

218
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:33,238
So people are having fun now.
Why are you looking for trouble?

219
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:35,639
I asked them to have fun. Who
asked them to make so much noise?

220
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,382
You’re even louder now, damn it!

221
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,012
Why are you always doing as you please?

222
00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:43,428
Today as well. If you’ve invited
your friend, why did you ask me over?

223
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:45,599
Are you that unwilling
to meet my friends?

224
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,551
Yes. Unwilling

225
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:48,162
Am I dating a shadow?

226
00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:52,040
Can’t I show my lover off to
my friends, is that so wrong?

227
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:53,651
Is it me who is
unwilling now, you rascal?

228
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:54,769
Then go

229
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:56,942
Do you think I won’t
go if you ask me to?

230
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:03,182
Hyung! Hyung!

231
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,568
You’re really great

232
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:09,654
Am I the one with a weird
temper? It’s him who is weird

233
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:11,594
Until now. Even till now…

234
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:19,649
Mi-ri, go get uncle back

235
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:23,993
Then apologise. Just say you’re sorry you asked
your friends over without informing him. Sorry

236
00:26:24,546 --> 00:26:27,041
Why should I apologise?
What did I do wrong?

237
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:33,384
What? You’re leaving too?

238
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,642
Give uncle a call and
ask him to come back.

239
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:37,557
I’m off

240
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,791
Really. I’m going crazy

241
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:07,618
Hello! Hello!

242
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,115
Why, the door is opened.

243
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:22,293
“Have more. Congratulations! Thank you!”

244
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:29,159
What? There are so many voices
in there. Why are there no shoes?

245
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:34,350
“So happy you made it!
Is work going well?”

246
00:27:40,597 --> 00:27:41,385
Hello?

247
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,474
“Come, let’s make a toast”

248
00:27:52,257 --> 00:28:07,168
<i>“Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you,
we love our birthday star, happy birthday to you!”</i>

249
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:14,068
“Congratulations, congratulations!”

250
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,696
“Congratulations!”

251
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:29,033
“Thank you”

252
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:34,897
“A toast to health!”

253
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,558
“Let’s sing a song”

254
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:02,534
I’m dying of hunger. Hurry up

255
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:05,394
So. What about last night?

256
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:09,778
What about what? I went
out without saying anything

257
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:13,787
So that auntie doesn’t even
know you were in the house?

258
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,822
No, I said goodbye when I left

259
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:21,789
Be careful. If that auntie sues you for
trespassing, you would have nothing to say

260
00:29:22,643 --> 00:29:26,370
Trespassing? Go ahead. And I’ll
sue her for disturbing the peace

261
00:29:27,028 --> 00:29:27,594
Hello!

262
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:33,804
Going for breakfast?

263
00:29:35,922 --> 00:29:36,446
Yeah

264
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:39,438
Sorry I disturbed you last night

265
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:45,154
Sometimes life will
have moments like that

266
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:47,224
Say something

267
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:54,118
Sorry. We had a small gathering last night. Because
it was quite noisy, so we felt a little disturbed

268
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:55,302
That’s why Mi-ri…

269
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,670
It’s not Mi-ri’s
fault. The fault is mine

270
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:00,960
Will you accept my apology?

271
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:04,442
Certainly

272
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:09,015
Then as an acceptance of my apology, come to
my place tonight for a red wine party, will you?

273
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:11,216
Party?

274
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,180
We’ll be very grateful if
you would take us in as guests

275
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:18,154
Thank you. I really want to make some friends, so I’m
really honoured that you’re accepting my invitation

276
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:19,964
Then, I’ll see you tonight!

277
00:30:25,613 --> 00:30:29,653
Hey! I don’t want to talk to
that woman, don’t want to go!

278
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:35,435
Come on. We’re all neighbours. It’ll be awkward
when you meet. And she goes to the café so often

279
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,671
I don’t want to. I don’t want to!

280
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:38,887
Come along

281
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:40,203
I can’t get along with that woman

282
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:41,847
Let’s go eat

283
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:45,197
Sorry. I also need to use money urgently

284
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:48,516
Last year as well. There were some
uncollected rent too, as you know

285
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,375
Yes. I’ll try my best

286
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,290
Ok, I’ll trouble you to, then

287
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:22,869
Delicious food prepared by granny!

288
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:41,136
Soo-hee…

289
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:45,837
Yesterday, I…

290
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:52,178
…You were so busy and I
still asked you to come over

291
00:31:53,427 --> 00:31:59,046
And I didn’t discuss with you before
asking uncle to come over. And then…

292
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:04,171
So both uncle and your moods were ruined

293
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:08,870
And also the neighbour auntie

294
00:32:10,415 --> 00:32:11,730
That’ll do

295
00:32:12,782 --> 00:32:14,786
I still prefer you thick-skinned.
This is so unfamiliar

296
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:19,559
You just have to put it that way?
Like it’s really your bad luck

297
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:28,627
Mi-ri, can you lend me
some money? 5 million won

298
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:33,095
Do I have to supply a reason?

299
00:32:34,672 --> 00:32:37,074
With our kind of relationship, it will
be a big deal if you still need to do that

300
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:42,253
You cannot do that

301
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,050
Why not? I don’t have a need
to go through treatment anymore

302
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:51,192
I’ll leave it to you
to convince my husband

303
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:58,261
In other words, to write a letter of proof
saying I have no need for further treatments

304
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:00,300
Then I’ll be able to go home.

305
00:33:01,154 --> 00:33:02,140
So please write the letter

306
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:05,492
Stubbornness is your strength, isn’t it?

307
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,366
The same goes for you, I think

308
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:12,558
Recorded, but say you didn’t do
recording. Wasn’t that you, doctor?

309
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:14,791
I recorded?

310
00:33:15,487 --> 00:33:16,146
Denying?

311
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:20,384
To believe all that you understand as the
only truth, that is also a kind of illness

312
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:25,970
Let’s talk about Oh Young-sook’s mother

313
00:33:27,186 --> 00:33:28,673
Don’t we have to treat my illness?

314
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:30,977
Are you avoiding the
subject of your mother?

315
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:32,618
Yes

316
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:42,383
Also, it’s really tiring. There’s no need
to walk all the way to my stall to buy stuff

317
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:46,490
For a change, just buy
somewhere near your place

318
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,512
Did I give you a mission, or…

319
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:56,230
I don’t wish to see
you. This one is free

320
00:34:04,174 --> 00:34:06,442
Granny, go on a date with me today

321
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:36,515
The napkin beside you…

322
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:42,990
…arrange it this way

323
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:53,002
Well done

324
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:59,737
Then, hold the spoon, that is
placed outside, like what I’m doing

325
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:02,983
Dip into the soup from outside to inside

326
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:14,976
Not used to it? Then just
drink in any way as you please

327
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,529
After you have cut your meat

328
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:32,454
Pick it up firmly with your fork

329
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:36,036
And eat it with the sauce, like this

330
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,366
This is only me. You
don’t have to follow me

331
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:21,410
Let’s measure our hands

332
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,150
Put your hand with mine for a while

333
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:37,876
Such big hands

334
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:42,513
Hands which have done so
much work, beautiful hands

335
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:46,261
My short and small hand, ugly hand

336
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:02,297
Are you curious about
what kind of a person I am?

337
00:37:05,185 --> 00:37:08,091
I am a bad woman

338
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:31,920
I’m sorry. Please do not move

339
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:36,459
Why haven’t you been
coming often lately?

340
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:37,673
I’m a little busy at work

341
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,429
But you should still try to
come a little. Kinda miss you

342
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:41,221
Really?

343
00:37:42,174 --> 00:37:44,375
If you’re so nervous, it will
be difficult for me to manage

344
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,563
I’m off

345
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,796
Is business good today?

346
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:03,631
What?

347
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:07,541
We’re receiving very good customer feedbacks.
Soo-hee earns money, I get more business

348
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:10,794
You get to see the Soo-hee you miss so much.
Isn’t this killing three birds with one stone?

349
00:38:21,994 --> 00:38:24,432
Today after you’re done with this
customer, could you make some time tonight?

350
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:25,357
Why?

351
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,492
I’m forced to go to a place which I’m
reluctant to go to. Let’s go together

352
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:56,404
New-Comer Cultural Nomination Prize

353
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:00,348
Branded University

354
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:08,199
New York University.
This is so disheartening

355
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,384
Come get it!

356
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,984
I don’t quite understand auntie

357
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:16,515
You’ve gotten many great awards

358
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:20,918
Oh yes. Soo-hee is also
in the arts profession

359
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:26,872
They’re all fake. All the graduation
certificates and trophies over there are all fake

360
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:36,696
I didn’t learn anything.
Just a child with parents

361
00:39:37,814 --> 00:39:41,230
Wanted to marry a well-educated,
kind and good-looking man

362
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:42,714
I didn’t have a choice

363
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,540
My career was developing
smoothly and I had some money

364
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:52,403
The man I love is too
good, and I am too shabby

365
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:53,883
So I lied to my husband

366
00:39:55,197 --> 00:40:02,015
Everything was going quite well,
but I got found out recently

367
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,629
The price is, I’m now
separated from my husband

368
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,773
Under such circumstances, what
do you think we should say?

369
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:15,819
Do you have children?

370
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:23,248
They didn’t know, but recently my
husband told them everything in detail

371
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:27,453
So now, I’m not on speaking terms
with my children either

372
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,489
All of you have this “I don’t know
what to do” expression on your faces

373
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:43,981
Be more casual. Leave if you want to

374
00:40:45,657 --> 00:40:48,697
After this incident, during this period
of time, close neighbours, friends…

375
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,516
…parents of my children’s
classmates, they have all abandoned me

376
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,105
After I got abandoned, I
grew stronger during then

377
00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:01,026
The door is opened. Don’t worry
about me. Leave if you want to

378
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:03,655
Sister, do you think
everybody is like that?

379
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:07,746
Are we children? Leaving
because of something so small?

380
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:09,668
Drink up

381
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:12,527
Cheers!

382
00:41:16,816 --> 00:41:17,901
I’ll pour you another drink

383
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,819
Come! Let us raise our glasses. Cheers!

384
00:41:26,312 --> 00:41:27,034
Bottoms up!

385
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:30,617
Don’t talk so much. Come on. Bottoms up!

386
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:56,576
Soo-hee, so sorry. It’s so late
and I’m asking you to go home

387
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:59,665
If it’s normally, I would
have asked that rascal to leave

388
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:02,755
Today because…there was the
thing yesterday. So sorry

389
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,301
It’s ok, no problem

390
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:07,454
Min-ho, see
Soo-hee back home

391
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:10,675
Otherwise, let her
sleep over at your place

392
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,008
Shut up and close the door

393
00:42:15,176 --> 00:42:15,775
Go on

394
00:42:16,138 --> 00:42:17,059
Ok, keep in contact

395
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:51,520
I’m going

396
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:53,458
Ok

397
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:18,806
About that issue, I’ll settle it

398
00:43:19,593 --> 00:43:21,927
You keep a close eye on
them. Don’t lose track of them

399
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:24,064
That’s it. And yes

400
00:43:24,457 --> 00:43:30,848
Ask Muda to brush his teeth. That smell in his
mouth, it’s impossible to have a dialogue with him

401
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:37,058
Ok, watch the door. Don’t
tell them I’ve come here

402
00:43:37,846 --> 00:43:40,770
Why would gangsters need to
watch the door? It’s no big deal

403
00:43:41,198 --> 00:43:42,776
Ok, that’s it. Hanging up

404
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:56,868
[The season is changing. Watch your health.
Drink more tea or water. Jeju Island]

405
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:01,732
What is he looking at? Smiling like that

406
00:44:24,137 --> 00:44:24,793
You have a woman?

407
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:27,822
You have a family?

408
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:33,374
Mother, elder sister, younger sister?

409
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:34,985
That’s enough

410
00:44:36,201 --> 00:44:38,862
Exactly how old are you?
Born in year 1960, right?

411
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,123
Where is your hometown?

412
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:51,419
Kang Ho-chul, is that your real name?

413
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:02,918
Angry and you’re leaving.
You’ve got such a bad temper

414
00:45:03,378 --> 00:45:07,156
Get angry easily. Give cold shoulders at
the drop of a hat. Leaving without a word

415
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:15,568
Are you all done now?

416
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,396
I’ve been dating you for three years.
What do we know about each other?

417
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:30,316
Is this love? When you’re in the mood,
you drop by. Leave some cash behind

418
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:35,310
Who do you have in your family? Where
have you lived before? Who do you know?

419
00:45:35,771 --> 00:45:37,906
Do you have any friends? I
know nothing about you, uncle

420
00:45:39,122 --> 00:45:42,768
You refuse to meet my father,
mother, brother and friends

421
00:45:44,346 --> 00:45:47,402
And you refuse to let me tell people
about the places we have been to

422
00:45:49,899 --> 00:45:52,528
When I’m tired you won’t let me complain,
and leave me to handle it all by myself

423
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:54,435
I want a shoulder to lean on too

424
00:45:55,911 --> 00:45:57,126
You’ve got it wrong

425
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:01,465
Life is like that. Who do
you think you want to lean on?

426
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:06,130
If you want to lean, lean against a wall. Don’t
even think of leaning on somebody’s shoulders

427
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:11,446
Just because you’re a woman you’re privileged,
leaning onto men as and when you want to?

428
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,504
Men are leading a
tiring life too, rascal

429
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:18,183
If uncle is tired, you
can lean upon my shoulders

430
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:21,568
You complain of being tired even when I lean my
head over when we’re sleeping! Talk about leaning

431
00:46:22,454 --> 00:46:27,614
Don’t think you’re so smart. Don’t just say pretty
words. Lead your life well, and I lead my life well

432
00:46:28,797 --> 00:46:29,453
What a joke

433
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:36,385
I’m asking you again.
Do you have a woman?

434
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:45,162
I have plenty! Will that do?

435
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,099
Ji-sook, looks like I
have to go look for you

[Little nothing (Mi-ri)]

437

Speak

438
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:02,376
Speak up. If you’re calling why
aren’t you talking? I’m hanging up

439
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:04,118
It’s little nothing

440
00:48:05,267 --> 00:48:06,029
I know it’s little nothing

441
00:48:08,236 --> 00:48:10,929
Sorry we quarreled. Come back

442
00:48:14,378 --> 00:48:15,037
Coming back?

443
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:22,330
I’ll be back after I get you your
favourite fried sticky cake at Sindangdong

444
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:31,266
So adorable. I just wanted to have some fun.
Now I’m really starting to like her. What to do?

445
00:48:34,393 --> 00:48:36,101
This will not do

446
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:08,096
Stop looking at me like that, granny.
I know I cannot go on like this

447
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:12,524
Soo-hee is
Ji-ahn’s girlfriend

448
00:49:14,693 --> 00:49:16,373
And it’s not like Soo-hee likes me

449
00:49:19,803 --> 00:49:23,220
As long as I don’t say
anything, everything is aye ok.

450
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:27,886
Granny should know

451
00:49:29,101 --> 00:49:33,865
I’ve got super endurance power. I should
be able to endure it this time too, right?

452
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:40,073
Say something

All right, granny. Let’s eat

00:50:05,114 --> 00:50:06,756
And yes. I need to see Ji-ahn

456
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,932
Then I’ll be able to catch my heart
which has gone to Soo-hee, right?

457
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,209
[But how did he start lying?]

458
00:50:28,265 --> 00:50:33,855
Once I’m about to forget it appears. Once
I’m about to forget it appears. What is it?

459

Children are really so gullible

460
00:50:55,963 --> 00:50:58,166
I deliberately turned the volume up loud

461
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:03,159
And I even left the door open for
her…But they all, all didn’t know

462
00:51:04,243 --> 00:51:07,037
And it was last night. I think
my judgment was very accurate

463
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:13,218
Mi-ri said that Soo-hee is also in the arts
profession, so let’s start the truth rolling here

464
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:17,063
Or else I have to play all by my
lonely self again. This idea popped up

465
00:51:17,523 --> 00:51:20,250
So I told them. It’s all
fake. Told them all the truth

466
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:21,600
Interesting, huh?

467
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:24,982
If there’s no interesting elements,
I think I would have died laughing

468
00:51:30,437 --> 00:51:31,916
Really, the feeling of
being honest is the best

469
00:51:32,737 --> 00:51:35,627
They didn’t think my real
identity would be like that as well

470
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,191
What I finally understood
yesterday is this:

471
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:41,872
There’s really nothing other than
honesty that can move people’s hearts

472
00:51:43,415 --> 00:51:44,074
Miss Oh Young-sook

473
00:51:45,025 --> 00:51:45,519
Yes?

474
00:51:46,866 --> 00:51:48,082
It may be a little abrupt to say this

475
00:51:48,642 --> 00:51:51,736
Miss Oh Young-sook is somebody who doesn’t
know the true meaning of being honest

476
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:55,974
You know how to make use of
other people. And you're very good at it

477
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:01,599
Time’s up. Go on

478
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,724
Woah! Not bad!

479
00:52:17,845 --> 00:52:19,259
Is this your seat?

480
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,380
Come back to the company

481
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:37,195
I don’t want to. Sitting in front of the
desk, just moving my mouth. That doesn’t suit me

482
00:52:42,484 --> 00:52:45,770
I’m making a move first.
Shall we go together?

483
00:52:47,906 --> 00:52:50,566
All right, you stay here a bit
longer on your own. See you later

484
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:30,050
My impressions of Ji-ahn’s parents are very good

485
00:53:31,101 --> 00:53:32,250
Want to grow old just like that

486
00:54:08,763 --> 00:54:09,394
Stop!

487
00:54:31,543 --> 00:54:32,147
Let go!

488
00:54:44,757 --> 00:54:50,081
Dad don’t beg him! Dad don’t beg him!
We’re not in the wrong! Don’t beg him!

489
00:54:50,478 --> 00:54:53,698
Dad don’t beg him! Dad don’t beg him!

490
00:54:58,134 --> 00:54:59,186
Dad

491
00:56:16,377 --> 00:56:18,841
[It’s enough that I saw you.
I’m making a move first, friend]

492
00:56:57,403 --> 00:56:59,178
You’ve had a hard
time! See you tomorrow!

493
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:00,787
Ok, you’ve had a hard time

494
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:06,110
I’m going

495
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:08,153
You’re carrying so much stuff

496
00:57:08,747 --> 00:57:11,243
I bought a lot of
sketch books. I’m going

497
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:14,265
Soo-hee!

498
00:57:16,468 --> 00:57:19,621
Will you see Soo-hee back in my
car? She’s carrying too much stuff

499
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:22,289
I don’t want to. Here you go

500
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:25,344
Listen to me

501
00:57:27,284 --> 00:57:28,302
Said I don’t want to

502
00:57:29,256 --> 00:57:31,489
Don’t know my temper? Don’t
want to live past tonight?

503
00:57:54,862 --> 00:57:56,602
Mi-ri wants me to see you home. Get in!

504
00:57:58,967 --> 00:57:59,624
No need

505
00:58:02,614 --> 00:58:04,979
I won’t leave like that. Get in

506
00:59:46,779 --> 00:59:48,094
Look after your stuff well

507
00:59:50,229 --> 00:59:50,952
Kim Min-ho

508
00:59:56,536 --> 00:59:57,226
What are you?

509
00:59:58,844 --> 00:59:59,501
What does that mean?

510
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:02,855
At Jeju Island, why
did you do that to me?

511
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:08,895
This became our secret,
it’s not what I want too

512
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:12,570
I’m curious. Why did you…

513
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:13,262
Do that?

514
01:00:18,683 --> 01:00:19,240
Yes

515
01:00:21,735 --> 01:00:24,277
Think of it whichever way that
will make you more comfortable

516
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,436
Lunatic? Lecher?

517
01:00:30,115 --> 01:00:33,827
Whichever way you prefer.
One of the two. It’s up to you

518
01:00:34,876 --> 01:00:36,718
It’s none of my concern
which one you choose

519
01:00:38,257 --> 01:00:39,282
What happened at Jeju

520
01:00:52,513 --> 01:00:54,325
You can pretend nothing
has ever happened

521
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:00,509
I thought I can pretend it all
never happened before as well

522
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:03,819
Kim Min-ho

523
01:01:06,015 --> 01:01:08,155
It seems like things are not that way

524
01:01:13,308 --> 01:01:18,733
I’ve fallen. What should I do?

525
01:01:25,158 --> 01:01:27,158
[Preview]

526
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:31,959
I have nothing to say. No, I have
a lot to say, but I can’t say them
*Translator: Rayndrop


527
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:37,360
If we leave it like this for a month,
Soo-hee and I will naturally become friends
*Timer: ltrang


528
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:37,961
Right, Granny

529
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,062
I can endure it

530
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,463
Did you quarrel with Min-ho?

531
01:01:43,164 --> 01:01:43,664
It’s nothing

532
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:46,980
Something happened the last time
you went to Jeju Island, right?
*Editor/QC: Pinklily

533
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:51,266
Min-ho, I’m planning
to propose to Soo-hee
*Coordinator: Mily2

534
01:01:57,267 --> 01:02:01,867
Maybe I’m becoming old. I’m
afraid of beating people up

535
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:10,968
Nobody understands me. I’ve
been wronged. I’ve been wronged
