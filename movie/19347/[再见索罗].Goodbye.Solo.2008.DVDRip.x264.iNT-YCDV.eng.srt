1
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,400
Why are you laughing?

2
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,700
- I'm not laughing, just...
- No.

3
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,000
- But last time I thought...
- No.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,100
You told me it would cost $200.

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,700
I'll give you a thousand
to take me there on October 20th.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
But last time I was talking shit
because I thought you were talking shit.

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,900
I'm sorry, sir.
I apologize for my language.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,300
Sorry about that.
I really never checked out the price.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,100
I even forgot...

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,000
Yo, what up, player?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,300
Yeah, I'm just chillin' here, man.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,800
North Side in an hour.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,800
I got you.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,200
Yo, big dawg,
let me call you back, all right?

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,600
I'll call you right back. Peace.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,600
So you're serious?

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,900
It's my birthday today, man.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,300
- What?
- It's got to be my birthday.

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,900
A thousand dollars?
That's a lot of money.

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,300
I don't give a shit if it's your birthday.
Can you do it or not?

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,200
You said Blowing Rock, right?

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,900
You want me to take you
two hours from here

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,700
on top of some mountain where
you're not meeting nobody,

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,000
and you don't want to come back.

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,000
- That's what you said, right?
- I told you all this before.

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,100
I don't want to repeat myself to you
and every cabbie in Winston-Salem.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,900
Yeah, but, big dawg,
this is kind of strange.

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,000
You got to give me that, right?

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,100
You know?

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,300
You want to talk about something?

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,100
Forget it.
I'll call and get another driver.

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,500
- No, big dawg, no...
- Forget it.

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm your driver. Come on.
I'm your driver, man.

34
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,900
Don't call the other drivers.
They're not good.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,700
I'll telling you, they're not good.
Don't call them.

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
You know? Just that...

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,400
What are you going to do there, anyway?

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,900
Are you going to go camping?

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Are you going there to chill
with the trees and the birds?

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,500
You like birds, big dawg?

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you going to fly away?

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,900
You're not going to jump, right?

43
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,800
You're not going to do that.

44
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,400
Tomorrow's going to be
a better day, you know?

45
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,700
- You're just going to the movie now...
- How about a hundred-dollar deposit?

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,500
The rest also in cash on October 20th
when you pick me up.

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,100
That's fine. That's cool.

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,900
Yo, big dawg!

49
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,700
Yo, William!

50
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,000
That's my cell phone, all right?
Call me on this one.

51
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,400
Don't call the dispatch anymore.
It's for my preferred client, okay?

52
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,200
Have a good night.

53
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,600
64-64. Dropped at
Marketplace Cinemas.

54
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,200
All right. Call me on Bobworth,
off of South Main Street.

55
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,600
All right. 6-4 out.

56
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
What's up, Ken?

57
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
You want a cab?

58
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,200
- All right. Thank you, ma'am.
- Morning, Pork Chop.

59
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,800
- Good morning, Solo.
- How are you doing?

60
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,300
- Fine. And you?
- I'm chillin'.

61
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,900
Listen. Remember the trip
you gave me yesterday

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
from the Crystal Towers Apartment
to the movie?

63
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,800
If this guy calls again,
please give me that trip, all right?

64
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
How am I supposed to know who's calling?

65
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,100
His name is William.
You know, just ask.

66
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I can't do it, and you know I can't.

67
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,700
- Come on, Cab 1.
- Come on, Pork Chop.

68
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
You know I'm not supposed
to give out trips like that.

69
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,500
A beautiful girl like you,
you can do whatever you want.

70
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,400
You're rocking this place, you know?

71
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,000
Cab 1, give 1641 B.

72
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,100
He's just a friend.

73
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,300
- You know what I'm saying?
- 1641 B, Lincoln.

74
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,100
Listen, when are we going to have
our steak at O'Charley's?

75
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,400
- Steak at O'Charley's?
- And a Tom Collins.

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,900
- Tom Collins?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,800
Yo, Mamadou, thank you.

78
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,200
All right.

79
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,900
So you need a ride for the next trip?

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- All right.

81
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Morning.

82
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Solo, don't get in our bed
until you take a shower.

83
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,600
And your breakfast is in the fridge.

84
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,300
<i>Bonjour again.</i>

85
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,100
<i>Bonjour again, Solo.</i>

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,600
"Captain Abisha Slade had a slave...

87
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,000
"his name was Stephen...

88
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,700
"who produced the first
bright leaf tobacco in 1839

89
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,500
in Caswell County."

90
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,100
That's right here.

91
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
"The farmer needed sandy soil,

92
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,300
and the Appalachian Piedmont has it."

93
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,200
<i>- That's here.
- Bijou, can I see this, actually?</i>

94
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,700
No. What about my cell phone?

95
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,300
You know what your mom said.

96
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,100
- Bye.
- You smell like smoke.

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Cab number 7, Cab 7.

98
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,500
22922.

99
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
Hey, William, I thought
you were going to the movies.

100
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,500
- I am, and be careful with my stuff.
- With your luggages?

101
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
- What's going on?
- I sold my apartment.

102
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,400
You sold your apartment?
What for?

103
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,500
Moving into a motel.

104
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,800
I mean, is that all you have?
Where's your stuff?

105
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,500
Don't start your shit with me again.

106
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's go.
I don't want to be late.

107
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,800
All right, big dawg.

108
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,600
I don't get it, man.

109
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Isn't it better to go to a motel first,
drop off your luggages?

110
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,500
Why am I with you again?

111
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,700
How come it's always you
that picks me up?

112
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,100
Because I'm your driver now.
You know what I'm saying?

113
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,500
And anyway, I have this
I want to give back to you.

114
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
- What's this?
- Come on, man.

115
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,300
Last time you were just upset,
so I saved it for you.

116
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,500
Are you stupid?

117
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Or you just don't understand English?

118
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,600
We have a deal.
Would you just drive?

119
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,200
All right. Okay.
Then you know what?

120
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,100
Could you please call me
on my cell phone from now on?

121
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,800
Because when you call the dispatch,
it's always a problem over there.

122
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,500
I don't really give a shit which one
of you people picks me up.

123
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,500
That's not really nice.
We're friends now.

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,100
I think I want to know why you want
to go out to that mountain.

125
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,500
Do you ask all your passengers
why they want to go places?

126
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,300
Of course. Sometimes I do.

127
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,800
And when they're fine ladies,
I ask even more, man.

128
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Especially when they have big booties.

129
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,700
You like big booties?

130
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,100
I pick up a lot of big booties
here in this cab.

131
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,600
You like black women?

132
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,900
I know this black woman, right?

133
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,800
She's shaped like a bottle of soda.

134
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,800
I can hook you up.

135
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,900
William, you have family here, right?

136
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,700
Why don't you move in with them?

137
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,500
Why family don't stay together in America?

138
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,700
If that was in Senegal...

139
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,100
That's where I'm from.
In Africa.

140
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,900
You know where it is, right?

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,700
Dakar.

142
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,600
Family stay together.

143
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,400
We take care of our parents, old people.

144
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,300
Even if they don't have teeth
in their mouths anymore,

145
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,500
we take food and we put it
in their mouths.

146
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
Then why aren't you there now?

147
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,400
I got to make money
and send it back home, that's all.

148
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,700
You know what I mean?
I'm going to go there when I get old.

149
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,500
They're going to take care of me.
Same thing your people can do for you.

150
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Who said I want to see my people?

151
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,300
Of course you want to see them.
They're your blood.

152
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,800
And I'm sure they want to see you.

153
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,100
Hi. Can I help you?

154
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,900
No, thank you.

155
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,600
Okay.

156
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Hey! Hey, Solo!

157
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,100
Hey, William.

158
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,500
What's going on, man?

159
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,200
Because of your bullshit we're late.
The movie already started.

160
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,700
You sure you don't want
to see another movie?

161
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,500
I can keep your bags
and come back and get you.

162
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,500
That's not a problem.

163
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Oh, forget it.
Let's find a motel.

164
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,500
Okay, but we got to go
pick up someone first.

165
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,300
It's not going to be long.
Are you cool?

166
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
All right.

167
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,100
William, I'm going
to Piedmont Circle Projects.

168
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,800
I mean, I'm talking about Homicide Circle.

169
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,700
I don't give a shit.

170
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,900
All right, big dawg.
Let's go, then.

171
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,500
- Solo. Yo, who this, man?
- Yo, I'm sorry, man.

172
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,100
He's a good friend of mine.
Come on in.

173
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,800
Look, you can't be having people
riding with you.

174
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm sorry. It's cool, though.
Come on in.

175
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,000
Old timer, slide over, bro.

176
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Chill out, man.
That's my homey William.

177
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,300
Man got to have somewhere to sit.
Know what I mean?

178
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,800
- Damn.
- William, this is Roc.

179
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,300
- What up, player?
- Chillin', man.

180
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,600
All right.

181
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,200
Solo, turn right on Broad for me.

182
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,900
- I got you, bro.
- Good look.

183
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,400
Don't leave, man.

184
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,800
I got you, man.
I'll be around.

185
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,400
- Give me the wait time if you got to.
- All right.

186
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,100
He's not going to be long, all right?

187
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,100
Just a couple more stops
and back to his place.

188
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,800
You know what I'm saying?
One of my preferred clients.

189
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,000
Big dawg, I got to go take a pee.

190
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,700
You know what I'm saying?
Are you all right?

191
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,000
You okay?

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,800
I'll be right back.

193
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,800
Cab 6-4. 6-4.

194
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,600
Solo.

195
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,800
Come on, Solo, wake up!

196
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,800
- Yo, let's go!
- What's going on?

197
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,000
Hey, where's Solo at?

198
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,700
- Pissing.
- Aw, sh...

199
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,400
Solo, come on.
Let's go, dawg!

200
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,600
- We got to hurry up!
- Oh, shit.

201
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,900
- Come on!
- What's going on?

202
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,300
They tripping, dawg.
We got to get up out of here.

203
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,000
Come back here!
Get the fuck back here!

204
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
- What happened?
- Solo, let's go!

205
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,600
Get me the fuck out of here!
Get me out of here!

206
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,100
Drive, man, drive!

207
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,600
- Damn!
- Shit!

208
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,100
Roc, what's going on?
Why they tripping?

209
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,300
- I told you I got the wait time on.
- William, you all right?

210
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,300
Hey, Navani! Navani!

211
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Did he tell you why he left Winston?

212
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,000
No. He just said it was 30 years ago.

213
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,900
That's it?
No friends, no family?

214
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,200
I already told you,
he didn't say anything else.

215
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,300
He seems cool.
I think he's fine.

216
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Listen. Offer him a round on me, okay?

217
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,000
Okay, babe.

218
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,600
Solo, when you finally
going to get that cab fixed?

219
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
I got you.

220
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm just waiting for this part, you know?

221
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,300
Listen, man. I told you.

222
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,600
I got a connect in Maryland.

223
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,100
This girl done told him she got
a 725 on the credit score.

224
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,700
Says she can get us 20 Gs
for these cabs now.

225
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,500
I need you to put the drivers
in the car for me.

226
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,200
We could have this fire all around the town.

227
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,200
Have the whole city smoking good, cuz.

228
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,000
- I got a major supply coming in right now.
- It's from Solo.

229
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,700
Cheers, William!

230
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,000
Solo, are you hearing me?

231
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,500
Yo, man!

232
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
You paying me any attention, cuz?

233
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,400
I need you to get that cab fixed
so we can get this deal going on.

234
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,200
I got you, player.
I got you.

235
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,500
You know what?
Let's keep playing.

236
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,300
I need to get my $20 back anyway.

237
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,200
All right.

238
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
Check this out.

239
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,400
That's what I'm talking about.
What you got?

240
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm going to hit me another.

241
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
All right, we'll see.

242
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,400
That's the first one you done hit all day.

243
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,300
William.

244
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
Come on, we're here.

245
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,000
Where?

246
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,300
At my place.

247
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,200
What are we doing here?

248
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,700
Big dawg, I couldn't
find a motel on the way here.

249
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,000
Why didn't you wake me up?

250
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,300
I tried, but you wouldn't wake up.

251
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,900
You drank too much.

252
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,300
Big dawg, it's not a problem.

253
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,400
You got drunk, but we had
a good time, right?

254
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,300
I get drunk all the time.
You know what I'm saying?

255
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Plus, we're already here, man.

256
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,600
Come on, let's go. All right?

257
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,800
I'll find you a nice motel tomorrow,
I promise.

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
All right?
Let's go, big dawg.

259
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500
I got you.
You know what I'm saying?

260
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,700
I'll get you a nice motel tomorrow.

261
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,100
No, don't worry about that.
Don't worry.

262
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,500
I got it, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

263
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
William, this is my wife's place.

264
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,600
- All right?
- Navani?

265
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
No. Navani's my ex.

266
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,400
She doesn't exist here.

267
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,400
My wife's name is Quiera, okay?

268
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,400
William, my wife's name is Quiera.

269
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
All right!
Keep your dick in your pants.

270
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,300
Okay. You know,
just making sure, that's all.

271
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,400
She's pregnant now,
and, you know,

272
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,600
she gets, um...
she gets very sensitive.

273
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,000
You know what I mean?

274
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,100
This is Machu Picchu.

275
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,100
The Inca people, they built it
about 500 years ago.

276
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,500
Yeah, I know about it.

277
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,200
Really? Wow.

278
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,200
I can't believe they did it
with their hands only.

279
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,800
You been?

280
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,500
No, but I would love to.

281
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,100
I hear it's even hard
to breathe over there.

282
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,500
There you go.
This is yours.

283
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,500
The bathroom's right here.
You need anything else?

284
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,600
Do you want a glass of water, anything?

285
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,300
No? Okay.

286
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,900
Have a good night, William.

287
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
See you tomorrow morning.

288
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,800
Solo, wake up.

289
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,000
Solo, wake up.

290
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,300
Wake up, Solo.

291
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
<i>Bonjour, Solo.</i>

292
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Mom wants to talk to you.

293
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,700
What's up, baby?
You want to talk to me?

294
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,300
- Why you lying to me?
- What's going on?

295
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,100
"Dear Mr. Souléymane Diop,

296
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,900
"your request for a flight attendant
interview with Sun Airlines

297
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,700
has been processed and approved
for October 15, 2007."

298
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,500
- Baby, is this letter you're upset about?
- Solo, this is next week!

299
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,200
Yeah, but this letter is three months old.
I just didn't throw it away.

300
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,100
But you promised me to give up
this childish dream, remember?

301
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,500
Baby, it's not childish.

302
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,400
Why you got to say that all the time?
It's better than driving a taxi.

303
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,200
Plus, you know I don't
even want to do that anymore.

304
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,100
It doesn't matter what you want to do.

305
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,700
We agreed that it was best for the family

306
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
if you drive in the day
so you could be with us.

307
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,300
Seriously, I did not study.
I gave it up.

308
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,300
Who's going to help me
take care of this baby

309
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,900
when you're flying
to Florida or New York

310
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,900
for three or four days?

311
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,500
- Baby, I'm here.
- I need you here!

312
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,100
That's what I'm saying.
I'm here. I didn't study.

313
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,500
And I'm sick of that taxi!

314
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,700
I'm going to call my cousins
to come here and fix it.

315
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,800
No, baby. You know I don't want
your cousins in my business.

316
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,800
- Well, fix it!
- I will do it. I'm waiting for...

317
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,500
And who the hell is that old man
sitting in my sofa, huh?

318
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,700
- Tell me!
- That's my friend William.

319
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,300
I don't want your friend William
in my house, okay?

320
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Quiera...

321
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,500
Quiera, that's not really nice.

322
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I'm sorry, William.

323
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,500
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Do you want...

324
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
Why you don't let my cousins to help?

325
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,900
- They want to, Solo.
- I don't want your cousins in my business.

326
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,600
- You know that already.
- You don't do anything.

327
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,700
All you do is hanging out
with your friends.

328
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,300
Baby, calm down.
It's okay.

329
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,800
I had this one, like, for a month.

330
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,300
A week after, it was broken.
I don't even want it.

331
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,600
I don't want to drive a cab.
I've been doing that for three years!

332
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
I had given up my flight attendant thing.

333
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,300
She goes through my stuff,
and she doesn't want to believe me.

334
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
You have any unsalted butter
and mushrooms?

335
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,800
I want to make an omelet.

336
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,200
William, did you check in the kitchen?

337
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,900
Check in the kitchen.
Take whatever you want.

338
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,700
This is your place here. All right?

339
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,500
Take whatever you want.

340
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,200
William, do you know about cars?
Can you give me a hand here?

341
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,600
I rode motorcycles.

342
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,000
- You mean the big ones?
- Harley.

343
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,200
Harley?

344
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,000
You were in a gang and stuff like that?

345
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,900
William... Open road,
women, biker's bar.

346
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,900
You have a tattoo, right?

347
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,100
Oh, my God.
That's what I'm talking about.

348
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
Original player.

349
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,800
Wow, William is chillin'!

350
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,300
Alex, you want to buy this DVD?

351
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
- I already saw it.
- It's new.

352
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,100
I already saw it.
How much does this cost?

353
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,600
This is under $50.

354
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,900
And actually, they look really good.

355
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You go to Silas Creek,
you can pay $70 a piece.

356
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,500
Look at this.

357
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,300
$70? For that money
I can buy a cell phone.

358
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,000
Cell phones are expensive,
but look here.

359
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,500
These are really good.
Look at the cloth.

360
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,700
Hey, Alex, what you doing here?

361
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,100
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

362
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,700
Hey, Solo. What's up, man?

363
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,600
Alex is trying to get a cell phone.

364
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,300
Don't be selling her your crap.

365
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,700
- What's up?
- How you doing?

366
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,100
- Pretty good.
- What's up, Peter?

367
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,300
First time you get the taxi,
and you're still late!

368
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,200
<i>I'm sorry, madame.
Sorry about that.</i>

369
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,100
If I had a cell phone,
you can just call me.

370
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,500
- Isn't that right, William?
- Yes.

371
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,900
Where are we going?

372
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,300
God knows where your dad's taking me.

373
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,300
I'm telling you,
this is the best place right here.

374
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,900
You got restaurants all over the place,
you can walk down to them.

375
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,700
- It takes five minutes.
- Bye, William.

376
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,200
Bye, Alex.

377
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,100
When is the next time
you're going to the movies?

378
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,300
- I don't know.
- You have my cell phone, right?

379
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,400
Okay. You know what,
just give me a call

380
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,900
whenever you need anything, all right?

381
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,900
Okay?

382
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,300
Bye, William.

383
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,100
You think he's okay in there?

384
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,000
If he didn't like it, he would just leave.

385
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,700
Yeah, I know, but you don't understand.

386
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,900
I understand more than you.

387
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
- Hey, Malaak.
- Hey, Solo.

388
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,600
- How you doing?
- Very good.

389
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,800
- How are you?
- I'm good.

390
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,400
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

391
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,400
Listen, I want to ask you a favor.
Could you keep an eye on my friend?

392
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,600
If anybody comes,
if a taxi comes and picks him up,

393
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,100
if anything strange happens,
please let me know.

394
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
- I will.
- All right?

395
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

396
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
- Hey, Solo?
- Yeah.

397
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
Can I get a phone card next time?

398
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,600
You mean a ten-dollar phone card?

399
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,900
- Yes, sir.
- I got you, big dawg.

400
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

401
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
- Have a good night.
- Bye, Alex.

402
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,100
Quiera, I'm really sorry,
but it's just not working.

403
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,200
No, no, Quiera, I did...

404
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,200
Whatever you asked me to do, I did it.

405
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,100
Whatever... No, no, no,
I never said that.

406
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,700
No, listen, listen.
No, Quiera, listen!

407
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,900
Quiera! Hello? Hello?

408
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,000
She doesn't sound good.

409
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,300
I'm glad her aunt and her niece
are moving in, because...

410
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,300
What are you doing?

411
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,800
Dawg, I don't even know
what I'm doing right now.

412
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,900
Who the hell told you to come here?

413
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,400
You know I can't go to Navani.
I mean, I just can't.

414
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,700
And Roc... Roc is in with some stuff
I'm not interested in,

415
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,900
- so I figured maybe for a couple days...
- No.

416
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,400
...I could...
- There's no room.

417
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,100
Big dawg, this place is huge!

418
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
In Africa ten people can sleep in here.

419
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,000
Ten people!
And plus, see?

420
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,500
This is all I have.
This is all.

421
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
I have nothing else.
See this bag?

422
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,700
This is the only thing I have here!

423
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,500
This sofa is perfect.
All I need is a tiny place to study.

424
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,000
I didn't tell you.

425
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,300
Check this out.

426
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,600
I'm studying for my interview.

427
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,400
And this time, I'm going all the way.

428
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm telling you, all the way.

429
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,100
No stopping!
Quiera says I can't do it.

430
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,000
Why not? I can do it!

431
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,800
I can do it, because you know what?

432
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,200
I want to do it. That's all.

433
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,800
So, big dawg, I'm just going
to chill in here and study, all right?

434
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,400
Is that cool with you?

435
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,900
See? I'm sitting here, I'm studying.

436
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,300
Can you see me?
You can't see me.

437
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,600
You're chilling over there, watching TV.
I'm here chilling, man.

438
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,600
You know what I'm saying?
This light over here...

439
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,800
if I turn it off and I don't smile,
you're not gonna notice...

440
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,700
Stay out of my stuff!

441
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,700
Keep your shit over there
and leave me alone.

442
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
Thank you very much, big dawg.

443
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,000
That's what I'm talking about.

444
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,500
Thank you. I appreciate that.

445
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,100
I appreciate it.

446
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,100
I have my interview on Monday,
and I'm going to ace it.

447
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,800
I really don't give a shit.

448
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
I don't want to know.

449
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,800
I don't want to know about Quiera
or anything about your life.

450
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,400
Sorry about that.

451
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,900
If you like this place, you can keep it
when I leave next week.

452
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,800
Their rates are very fair.

453
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,000
6-4, 6-4. Pork Chop.

454
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,600
Come on, Cab 64.

455
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,400
Have you ever heard of this place
called Blowing Rock?

456
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,400
Blowing Rock?
Well, of course I have.

457
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,800
It's up in the mountains near Boone.

458
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,200
Actually, I know where it is,
but do you know if there's anything

459
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
happening there on October 20th?

460
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,700
Not to my knowledge.

461
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,500
We used to go there when we were kids.

462
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,700
It's the only place in the world
where the snow goes upside down.

463
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,400
What? I mean, what do you mean?

464
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,500
It's so windy, if you throw a stick
or anything off the rock,

465
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,500
it gets blown back into the sky.

466
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,000
Blown back up to the sky?

467
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,400
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, Cab 64.

468
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,600
That's why it's called "Blowing Rock."

469
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,700
All right. 6-4 out.

470
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,700
Sorry, William.
I didn't mean to wake you up.

471
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,200
I got us some playing cards.

472
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,100
And I know you like DVDs,
so I got you some new releases.

473
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,500
We don't have a DVD player.

474
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
- Now would you be quiet?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

475
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,900
Just because I know
you like movies, you know.

476
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,500
Sorry about that.

477
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,600
Man, I miss them.

478
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,000
Alex is getting ready to go to school now.

479
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,100
She's probably having breakfast
with Quiera in the kitchen.

480
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,100
Are you married, William?

481
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,000
I was.

482
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,200
What happened?
You divorced?

483
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,300
My wife left me 30 years ago.

484
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,900
I'm sorry to hear that.

485
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,000
And do you have any kids?

486
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,700
No. None.

487
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,200
I'm trying to sleep.

488
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,000
Sorry about that.

489
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,400
It's just that I'm going to have
my first kid soon, you know?

490
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,300
Goodnight, William.

491
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,800
"First Aid and the Flight Attendant.

492
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
"Flight attendants are not responsible

493
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,000
"for diagnosing illness,
but to support life.

494
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,900
"No medicines.

495
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
"Bleeding.

496
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,400
"Burns.

497
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,600
Heart attacks."

498
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,000
This is just vitamin C, aspirin,
calcium, and antihistamine.

499
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,600
Antihistamine? What's that?

500
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,500
That's something that's used
to counter histamines.

501
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,000
And what does that mean?

502
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,400
If somebody has allergies.

503
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,900
These are just over-the-counter drugs.

504
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,600
So none of those is for anything serious?

505
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,700
No.

506
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Like when somebody's
about to die or something?

507
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,300
Excuse me?

508
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,600
You know, something like cancer
or something like that?

509
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,000
No. Sir, if you're not feeling well,

510
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,600
I suggest you consult with a physician.

511
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,200
Are you okay?

512
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm sorry about that, sir.

513
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,900
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

514
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,500
Is there anything else I can help you with?

515
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,000
No. I'm good.

516
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,500
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Okay.

517
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,200
There we go.

518
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,500
- William and me, we're in room 213...
- You already told me that.

519
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,900
I already put it in.

520
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,700
How did you even learn
the cell phone that fast?

521
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,600
It's not hard.

522
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,000
Now whenever you need a taxi,
you can call me, all right?

523
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,100
<i>Bijou, it's going
to be all right, you know?</i>

524
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,900
Mom says you're going to come back.

525
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,200
Whatever happened between Mom and me
has nothing to do with you.

526
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
You understand that, right?

527
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,800
It doesn't matter if I understand.

528
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,000
It doesn't change anything in the past.

529
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,400
When you grow up, you'll understand.

530
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,500
I don't want to grow up
and learn all that bullshit.

531
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,400
Where did you learn this word?

532
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,300
You know what?

533
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,900
I bet you can't even use this phone
to take a picture of me.

534
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
- Can, too.
- You don't know how to do that.

535
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,700
I'll prove it.

536
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,200
You'll prove it?
All right, there we go.

537
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,400
Let me see.

538
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,200
How come this hot dog
looks better than me?

539
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,800
That's not fair.

540
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
No. You know what?
Show me, show me.

541
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,300
How do you do that?

542
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
Thank you.
Enjoy the show.

543
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,300
Thank you.

544
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,100
Hey, how can I help you?

545
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,000
<i>Yeah, two for Outcast.</i>

546
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,500
All right.
That'll be $16, please.

547
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,000
Thank you.
Enjoy the show.

548
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,300
Thank you.

549
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,300
I really liked the movie.

550
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,300
- Thanks for recommending it.
- Yeah, no problem.

551
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
Acting was great.

552
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,900
- I'm a big fan of...
- William!

553
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,200
- Good-bye.
- Yep.

554
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,900
Hey, how can I help you?

555
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,100
Come in the front, big dawg.
Come, come.

556
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,300
What did you see?
How was your movie?

557
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,200
Why didn't you call me?

558
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,200
You've underlined a lot of words.

559
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,800
Yeah, it's because
I don't know the meaning

560
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,800
or I don't know how to pronounce it.

561
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,800
Big dawg, why don't you quiz me
on a couple of terms?

562
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,700
Okay, we play for this trip.

563
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,500
Let me break it down for you.

564
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,700
If I win, it's free.
If you win, it's free.

565
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,300
Come on, just a few words
till we get to the motel, player.

566
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,500
- "Deadhead."
- All right, big dawg!

567
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,900
All right.
So you think you can win?

568
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,700
Okay. All right.

569
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,500
So, "deadhead."

570
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,000
"Deadhead" is the transport
of an off-duty crew member

571
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,500
for the purpose of positioning
for the working of a flight.

572
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's what I'm saying, big dawg.

573
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,900
That's what I'm saying.
I'm on it, man.

574
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,100
I'm on it. I'm acing it.

575
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,000
Wow, you better try harder.
You better try harder.

576
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm telling you,
or you're going to pay for this trip.

577
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,200
"In the event of a water evacuation,

578
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,800
what are the six steps
a flight attendant must take?"

579
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,700
Water evacuation.

580
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,700
Okay. One, form a barrier.

581
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,300
Two, check conditions
and "rhetoric" if exits are blocked.

582
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,000
Three, open exits and inflate slide.

583
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,100
Four, when opening a door exit

584
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,500
to evacuate an aircraft...

585
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,100
That's strange.

586
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,000
Yo.

587
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,600
This is cool.

588
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
You got to check this out.
Alex sent me that.

589
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,700
I didn't know you could do that.

590
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,900
That's cool, right?

591
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,600
Wow.

592
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
How do you do that?

593
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,600
How do I do that?

594
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,000
How do you take a picture
and send it on a phone?

595
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,400
I don't know.
That's why I'm kind of surprised.

596
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,300
She took my picture, but I didn't know
you could send it through the phone.

597
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,500
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

598
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,000
- "Redirect."
- "Redirect."

599
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,100
Okay. I got you, big dawg.

600
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,100
"Rhetoric" is... it means
a whole different thing.

601
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,300
- Okay.
- "Redirect."

602
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yo, William, what's up?
How you doing?

603
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,300
Where the hell are my clothes?

604
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,300
I'm just going to wash them, big dawg.

605
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,200
The place is a little smelly
right now, that's all.

606
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,600
I hope you're not going
to take a nap right now.

607
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
I just want to go to the Laundromat.

608
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,300
I'll be right back, okay?

609
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,800
I'll see you in a second, eh?

610
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,100
Bye.

611
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,100
Malaak. Aw, man.

612
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,700
Hey, Solo.

613
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,300
You got it?

614
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,800
- See you, dawg.
- Bye, Solo.

615
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,600
Give me a sentence.

616
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,800
ELB... Emergency Locator "Beckon."

617
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
"Beacon," not "Beckon."

618
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,300
"Beacon." It's a signal light.

619
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,100
"Beacon."

620
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,900
Alex?

621
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,000
- Get me some napkins.
- Okay.

622
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Another word is "floo..."

623
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,800
"fl-flooter."

624
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,500
"Flooter"?

625
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,700
"Flutter"?

626
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,800
To move quickly, like a butterfly.

627
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,800
That's kind of cool.

628
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Take that to Solo.

629
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,000
Thanks, Alex.

630
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,900
Big dawg, thank you very much.

631
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,200
That's cool.

632
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,600
<i>Thank you. Bon appétit.</i>

633
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,900
Good sandwich, William.

634
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Thank you.

635
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,200
I'm used to talking to all kinds of people
and I get along with them.

636
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,000
People are happy in my cab,

637
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,000
and I also know how to handle
the ones that aren't so friendly.

638
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,500
Says here you speak French.

639
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,200
I speak French.

640
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,600
I speak English, as you can see.

641
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
I speak Wolof.
I speak Spanish.

642
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,200
I mean, I'm getting better.
My wife is Mexican.

643
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,800
I also speak ten other African languages.

644
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,200
I'm a very curious person.

645
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,900
I like to learn about people's culture,

646
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,700
and I think that's
very important for this job.

647
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,100
That's true. Sounds good.

648
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,600
Let's go ahead and begin the examination.

649
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,200
- I'm ready. Let's do it.
- Okay.

650
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,100
William! William!

651
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,600
Well?

652
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,700
I aced it, man! I killed it!

653
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,300
They're going to let me know in two days.

654
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,100
Get your jacket.
Let's go, let's go!

655
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,100
It's party time tonight!
Get your jacket!

656
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,000
- You like this music right here?
- Yeah, it's okay.

657
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,700
I grew up in the rock and roll era.

658
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,900
It's the same, man.

659
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,000
You know, this is reggae,
rock and roll.

660
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,200
Big dawg, it's the same music.

661
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,600
But I got you.
You want some rock and roll?

662
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,300
If you can find it, yeah.

663
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,200
Here we go. Sure.

664
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,300
I like a little country now and then.

665
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,800
All right, no problem.

666
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
There we go, big dawg.

667
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,700
I don't know much
about this kind of music,

668
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,600
but it sounds good to me, too.

669
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,600
Well, then you've probably
never heard of Hank Williams.

670
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,600
- Hank Williams?
- Yeah.

671
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,300
No, not really.

672
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,700
Not really. Who is that?

673
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,400
The greatest country writer
there ever was.

674
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,600
Wow. Okay. All right.

675
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,400
I'll check him out.

676
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,700
Vargrave's that way.

677
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,600
Damn, big dawg.

678
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,000
Know what?
Let me make a U-turn up there.

679
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,400
Good looking out, big dawg.

680
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,700
Good looking out.

681
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,800
See if you can hit something.

682
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,900
Not with your hand, man.

683
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,500
Not with your hand, with the stick.

684
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,500
All right.
Let's see that.

685
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,500
William, another one for you.

686
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,000
Thank you.

687
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,100
All right. Thanks, girl.

688
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,600
You know, your ex,
she's got a really nice ass.

689
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,900
Yo, big dawg!

690
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,300
- Oh, my, my.
- Come on, Roc.

691
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,900
William, what you got?

692
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's all that shit he's been smoking.
He can't even see the ball.

693
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,500
- Oh, big dawg!
- I believe I scored.

694
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,700
Give me five, give me five!

695
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,200
That's what I'm talking about!

696
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,400
Yo, man, here's your money.

697
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,100
Yo, William, man.

698
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,600
I know this place.
You want to go?

699
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,100
You want another round?

700
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,400
Might as well.

701
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,900
All right!
That's what I'm talking about!

702
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,300
That place, the music is dope.

703
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,200
And they have girls with big booties.

704
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,800
You like the big booties, don't you?

705
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,100
- Oh, yeah!
- Hey, hey, hey!

706
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,400
Okay, Solo.

707
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,400
Yeah!

708
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,100
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Way to go, Solo!

709
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,500
- And that...
- They're light.

710
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,100
- That... Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

711
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,700
I can't believe what they do now.

712
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,700
That's kind of, like, just crazy.

713
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,300
I need to get one of those myself.

714
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,300
You know what I'm saying?
Tired of those...

715
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,600
Hello? Hey, William?

716
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,100
William, it's you?

717
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,000
Yeah, I have my taxi.

718
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,200
To the bank? Yeah.

719
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,200
No problem.
I got you, all right?

720
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,400
- Yo!
- What's up?

721
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,900
Can you take me somewhere?
Just five minutes.

722
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,300
I got to go pick up a friend.

723
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,900
After that, you can drop me off at Willard.

724
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,700
- I got a trip right now.
- Come on, man.

725
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,800
I got you. Don't worry.

726
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,900
- I got your back, all right?
- All right, I'll take you.

727
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,500
- See you guys!
- All right, guys.

728
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
Here we are, gentlemen.

729
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,100
No, William.
We'll wait for you.

730
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,200
- Seven dollars.
- It's fine.

731
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,500
Come on, man.
We'll wait for you.

732
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,300
It's okay.
You're not going to be long.

733
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,900
- I'm closing my accounts.
- Thank you very much.

734
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,300
William, what do you mean
you're closing your accounts?

735
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,100
So we going back to Willard?

736
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,900
You know we will wait for you.
I have to take a nap anyway, all right?

737
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,900
- I got stuff to do afterwards.
- That's great!

738
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,400
Wait for me.
I'll be right back.

739
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,900
I'll go get my cab.

740
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,400
Wait for me here, okay?

741
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,000
Man, I don't know what's going on here,

742
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,700
but I got someone waiting on me.

743
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,500
Do you want me to take you
back to Willard or not?

744
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,000
Come on, Souléymane.

745
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,600
Let's go, man. Let's go.

746
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Yo, Solo!

747
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,200
Yo!

748
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,500
Solo, you left your jacket
in Oz's cab last night.

749
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,500
That's William's.
Thank you.

750
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,400
Yes, sir. Thank you.

751
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,400
William?

752
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,100
William, are you there?

753
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,200
William.

754
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,800
William, are you awake?

755
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,800
No.

756
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,400
What's wrong?

757
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,400
Please tell me what's wrong with you.

758
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,600
I can't do this anymore.

759
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,300
I know you don't want me to say that...

760
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,000
It's late. I'm sleeping.

761
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,500
I'm sorry. I went through your stuff
and I took your pills to the pharmacy.

762
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,100
There's nothing wrong with you.
It's only vitamins.

763
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,500
I didn't want to, but I had to.

764
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,400
Things are good, and you still want
to go and close your account.

765
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,000
Why do you want to do this?

766
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,700
I went to the cinema tonight.

767
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,700
The boy was there.

768
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,400
William, I saw his photo in your jacket.
You left it in the taxi.

769
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,900
Who is he?

770
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,200
You told me you had no kids.
Why are you lying to me?

771
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,900
I'm telling you everything.

772
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,300
Is he your grandson?

773
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,800
William.

774
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,700
William, I want to help you.

775
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,800
Did you talk to him?

776
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,900
William, please.

777
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,400
- Did you fucking talk to him?
- No, I didn't.

778
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,900
But he doesn't know
who you are, does he?

779
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Why don't you tell him?

780
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,700
I want you to get your shit
and get the fuck out of here.

781
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,700
William, why are you speaking this way?

782
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,800
- William.
- Get the fuck out!

783
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,200
We're friends now, and you want
to leave me and him, the boy?

784
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,400
Who the fuck told you
you could get into my life?

785
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,800
Who the fuck do you think you are

786
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,400
that you can touch anything
that belongs to me?

787
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,700
I got to tell him.

788
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,000
I got to bring him here
so you're not going to...

789
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,500
You're not going to tell him a damn thing.

790
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,100
You understand me?

791
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,200
I told you from day one,
stay the fuck out of my life!

792
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,400
I put the photo back.

793
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,600
William, please, don't leave.

794
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,400
I want you to stay.

795
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,300
Alex wants you to stay
and the boy wants you to stay...

796
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,900
if you tell him.

797
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,600
I got to get some ice.

798
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,800
- No, I'll get it for you.
- Sit down and shut up!

799
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,200
Sit down!

800
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,400
I want you to get your things,
leave, and don't come back.

801
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,800
- But, William...
- No!

802
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,900
Our deal for the 20th is off.

803
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,400
You're no longer my driver.

804
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,800
Shit. Fucker.

805
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,500
Slow down, man.

806
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,900
Jesus Christ.

807
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,200
Mom saw the letter.
She doesn't want you to come in.

808
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,900
- Did she open it?
- No.

809
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,800
- What happened to your eye?
- I just fell.

810
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,500
It doesn't look like you fell.
Did someone hit you?

811
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,200
- I miss you, Alex.
- I do, too.

812
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,200
I need to start going.

813
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,400
Wait, wait.
You don't want to know?

814
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,600
Yeah, you can just text me!
Good luck!

815
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,200
Bye, Alex.

816
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,800
Hi, William.
It's me, Solo.

817
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,000
I wanted to tell you I got
the results of my interview.

818
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,900
William, I failed.

819
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,000
I thought you'd want to know.

820
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,200
Yeah, you were clear,
but I thought you'd want...

821
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,800
Yeah, but...

822
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,600
Come in, Cab 75. 75.

823
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,300
75.

824
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:08,600
75, get 941. 941J.

825
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,500
Holland Avenue.

826
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,900
Alex, what are you doing up so late?

827
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,500
What? Right now?

828
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,000
I'm going to be there!
I'll be there right now!

829
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,400
Pork Chop.

830
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,300
Please, give me the keys.
Give me the keys for 64.

831
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,200
- What's wrong, Solo?
- Girl, I got to go!

832
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,700
- Please give me the keys, girl!
- I can't do it.

833
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,700
No, I'm not going to do it.

834
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,400
- You need to calm down.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

835
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,100
Don't be running up in here,
acting like that.

836
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,400
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the keys back.

837
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,600
I told you you couldn't get the keys.

838
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,600
Hurry up, Solo.
Where were you?

839
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,700
- Hurry up!
- How is she?

840
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,400
- She's fine. It's a boy.
- It's a boy?

841
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,500
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

842
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,700
Where is she?

843
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,900
She's over there,
but I need to check in.

844
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,300
- Over there?
- This is my step-dad...

845
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,100
Come on, let's go.
Is this Quiera Diop?

846
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,300
- Yes, that hallway.
- Okay.

847
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,000
Wow, how's the baby?
You see the baby?

848
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,800
I got a boy.

849
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,100
Quiera, you all right?

850
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,200
I told you a hundred times
we are both fine.

851
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,600
I like that you speak Spanish to him.

852
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,400
He's going to grow up
speaking four languages.

853
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,000
And how is he supposed
to learn French and Wolof, huh?

854
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,200
Tell me.

855
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,300
I just don't understand.

856
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,400
I saw how happy you were
holding the baby

857
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,500
in your hands just now.

858
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,100
You know we love you.

859
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,900
And you know that we want
what's best for you.

860
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,000
And I know you love us.

861
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,900
You can't leave.

862
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,500
Solo, you have to trust me.

863
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,000
I wish you could trust me, too.
And that's the problem.

864
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,300
Quiera, you know I love you,
and I'd do anything for the family.

865
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,200
But I've always tried things your way,

866
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,500
and you never gave my way a chance.

867
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,200
And I wish you can understand that.

868
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,900
I'm going to come back.

869
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,700
I'm going to call you to see if you need
anything else before I come.

870
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,400
Have a good night.

871
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,100
Hey, can I help you?

872
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,800
Sir?

873
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,200
- Hi.
- Hey.

874
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,100
You work here, right?

875
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,600
Excuse me?

876
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,100
- You work at night.
- Sometimes.

877
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,400
Would you like to see a movie?

878
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Sir?

879
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,400
Do you know this old man called William?

880
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,800
Excuse me, who are you talking about?

881
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,200
We have some screenings in an hour.

882
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,800
Would you like a ticket?

883
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:08,900
Sir?

884
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,000
- Sir?
- Sorry.

885
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,200
Forget about it.
Sorry about that.

886
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,500
Okay.

887
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,100
6-4, 6-4.

888
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,100
Come on, Cab 64.

889
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,300
Pork Chop, who's been
to the King's Inn Motel since yesterday?

890
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,400
Come on now, 64.

891
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,700
No, really, girl.
You got to help me out here.

892
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,600
34 picked that trip up.

893
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,000
Mamadou.
A half an hour ago.

894
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,900
Mamadou?
And where is he at?

895
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,300
Around the Baptist area.

896
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,600
All right, 6-4 out.

897
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,000
3-4, 3-4, this is 6-4.

898
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,200
3-4, 6-4.

899
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,800
Mamadou, this is Solo.

900
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,700
3-4, 3-4, this is 6-4.

901
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,800
3-4, 3-4, this is 6-4.

902
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,300
3-4, 3-4, 6-4.

903
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,900
3-4, Mamadou.

904
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,400
This is Solo, 6-4.

905
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,100
Mamadou!

906
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,900
Pull over, pull over!

907
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,100
Mamadou, unroll your window.

908
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,300
What do you want?

909
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,000
I want to ask you something.

910
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,300
Pull over!
Pull over right here.

911
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,300
I can't do it.
I got customers in my car.

912
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,100
I got to talk to you.
Mamadou, I got to talk to you.

913
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,500
All right, fine.
Follow me.

914
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,600
Hey, man, what's going on?
I got a trip.

915
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,300
I want to ask you something real quick.

916
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,300
Listen, did you pick up
an old man 30 minutes ago

917
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,400
- at the King's Inn Motel?
- Yeah. So what?

918
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,000
Did he offer you a trip
for tomorrow morning?

919
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,600
- No.
- Why are you lying?

920
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,100
What the fuck is going on?

921
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,900
Okay, whatever deal
you guys have is cancelled.

922
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,400
- The deal is not fucking cancelled.
- Mamadou, the deal is cancelled.

923
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,700
- The man paid me $200 deposit, man.
- I don't give a shit about his $200.

924
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,600
And plus, you see?
You're a fucking liar.

925
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,300
- Are you calling me a fucking liar?
- You're a liar!

926
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,600
Mamadou, I'm talking to you.

927
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,400
- Don't fucking grab me.
- I'm talking to you...

928
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,500
Hey, come on, you guys.

929
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,100
Mamadou, I don't care
about the money, all right?

930
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,800
But you're going to tell me
where you dropped him.

931
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,200
Fuck you, man!

932
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,100
I swear you're going to tell me
where you dropped him.

933
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,400
- Hey, man. Easy.
- Come on, chill out, man.

934
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,800
- Come on, dawg.
- Mamadou, where did you drop him?

935
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,800
Hold on. Hold it, man.

936
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,800
What do you want?

937
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,800
I'm here to take you
where you want to go.

938
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,300
Where's my driver?
I didn't ask for you.

939
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,200
William, I'm here to take you
wherever you want to go.

940
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,400
Where to?

941
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,100
The motel.

942
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,900
William, I saw the other driver
and he canceled the trip with you.

943
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,400
I'll take you tomorrow morning.

944
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,300
That was our deal.

945
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
What time should I pick you up?

946
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,200
8 a.m.

947
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,700
William.

948
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Good morning.

949
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,800
Morning.

950
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,400
Thank you.

951
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,800
You want to wash up?
Then we'll be leaving.

952
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,900
"I made a joke about
how bad a film was,

953
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,600
"and when he laughed,
his lip twitched.

954
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,100
He looked just like his mother."

955
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,800
"He's studying hard.

956
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,400
"I'm trying to help him the best I can.

957
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,700
I think he will pass."

958
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:34,900
"I don't think Solo knows
that Alex fixed the curtains.

959
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,000
"She is so smart.

960
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,600
I wonder who she will become."

961
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,600
Isn't that nice?

962
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,100
See? Almost new.

963
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,700
You like that?

964
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,800
It's very nice.

965
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,200
Thank you.

966
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,000
William, I have a favor.

967
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,500
- I want Alex to come with us.
- No.

968
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,800
William, I just can't come back alone.

969
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,600
I can't believe you're saying that. No.

970
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,600
I need Alex with me.

971
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,500
Please allow me that.

972
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,300
Hi, William. Hi, Solo.

973
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,000
- Hi, Alex.
- You ready?

974
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,800
Come on, hurry up.

975
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,300
Hurry up, slowpokes.

976
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,000
Blowing Rock's this way!
Come on!

977
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,700
Hey, Alex, don't you want
some ice cream?

978
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,300
No. I want to go to Blowing Rock.

979
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,000
We will, but let's go get
some ice cream first.

980
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,100
They have cookies and cream.

981
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,500
- They do?
- Yeah.

982
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,500
Wow! Come on, William.
What are you going to get?

983
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,900
Alex, William has to go meet a friend.
He's going to be late.

984
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,500
- So let's go, and we'll meet him later.
- Are you sure?

985
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:45,700
Yes.

986
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,500
Okay. Bye, William.

987
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,000
Bye, Alex.

988
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,700
Hurry up, Solo!

989
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,100
Solo, come on.

990
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,800
Come on.

991
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,200
Isn't this place so pretty?

992
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,800
I'm going to get two scoops of ice cream.

993
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,100
Pretty cool, huh?

994
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,100
Do you know if you throw
a stick off Blowing Rock,

995
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,200
it comes right back to you?

996
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,600
- For real?
- Yeah.

997
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:29,700
Cool! Come on, let's go.

998
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,900
- We'll go later.
- No, come on!

999
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,300
Alex.

1000
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,900
Come on.

1001
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,500
Alex, wait.

1002
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,700
Alex, come back.

1003
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,700
Hurry up, Solo.

1004
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,700
Watch out, Alex.
I don't want you to fall down.

1005
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,300
Hurry up, Solo.
There's Blowing Rock!

1006
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,500
Hold on. Watch out.

1007
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,000
Hurry, up!

1008
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,300
Hurry up, Solo.

1009
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,400
Look, Solo, look!

1010
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,100
- No.
- But I want to see.

1011
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,400
You're going to fall.
It's dangerous.

1012
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,300
Then let me go get another stick.

1013
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,800
Yeah, but be very careful, okay?

1014
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,300
Hey, Alex, be careful!

1015
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,400
No, it's too dangerous.
I don't want you to come here.

1016
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,500
It's too dangerous.

1017
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,900
Then here, Solo.
You throw it.

1018
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,900
Is this your textbook?

1019
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,200
Yes.

1020
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,900
Are you going to try again?

1021
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,500
I think so.

1022
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,000
Let me give you a little quiz right here.

1023
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:04,000
Let's see.
What is "XLV"?

1024
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:09,100
Aw, come on, Solo.
I know you know it.

1025
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,600
"Extra Life Vest."

1026
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,900
You see?
You got it right.

1027
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,800
Bravo!

1028
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,500
Let me find another one.

1029
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,400
I'm sure you can get this one.

1030
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,900
"In the event of a water evacuation,

1031
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,800
what are the six steps
a flight attendant must take?"

1032
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:29,700
Come on, Solo, I know you.

1033
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,200
You can get them.

1034
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,600
One, form a barrier.

1035
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:39,000
Two, check conditions and redirect

1036
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:41,100
when exits are blocked.

1037
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:46,000
Three, open exits and inflate slides.

1038
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You're doing great right now.

1039
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,500
Four, when opening a door exit
to evacuate an aircraft,

1040
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,400
rotate the handle
in the direction of the arrow

1041
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,400
and open the door forcefully enough

1042
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,800
that it locks against
the side of the fuselage.
