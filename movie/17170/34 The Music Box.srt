1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,960
Can you believe that Fixies are
Such itty-bitty creatures?

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,259
Even when they’re magnified
It’s hard to see their features.

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,339
They’re tiny, infinitesimal, 
So small it makes you doubt.

4
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:32,880
But if you meet a Fixie, please,
Don’t let their secret out!

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:42,118
The Compass

6
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:43,759
Pipe all hands on the deck!

7
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,600
Ay-ay, maties! Shiver me timbers!

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,600
Simka, Nolik, what are you doing here?

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,799
We’re not Simka and Nolik.

10
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,878
We are courageous pirates!

11
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:54,518
Yeah, pirates!

12
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:57,920
And today we leave home for the sea!
Are you with us?

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,878
- Yes I am!
- Hurrah!

14
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,319
You mean no? No hurrah?

15
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:04,638
Oh, yeah!

16
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:08,078
You can't join us without a test!

17
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:10,400
Go and find a special thing.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,838
Something no sailor should ever sail the sea without!

19
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:16,078
I can do it! But how?

20
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:17,200
With a map!

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,159
And it’s over... there!

22
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,078
I've never seen a map that's this puny!

23
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:27,280
What are you talking about puny?!

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,959
That took us a half hour to make!

25
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,638
From where you're standing now…

26
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:35,799
Uh-huh! From here you mean!

27
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,879
He guessed it right!

28
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,519
First head to the North

29
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,920
until you will find...

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,239
Hold on! But where is the North?

31
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,239
It’s where the North Pole,

32
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,799
ice, and polar bears are!

33
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,599
But how do I know which direction that North Pole is?

34
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,719
By compass, of course!

35
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,759
A compass is a special tool that helps sailors and pilots know in which direction they’re traveling,

36
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,200
whether in the air or on the sea.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,838
Our planet is like a big magnet that has two poles –

38
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:10,079
the North Pole and the South Pole.

39
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,878
These magnetic poles help the needle in the compass find its way.

40
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:20,680
The needle is magnetized so one of its ends will be attracted to the North magnetic pole and point at it,

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,239
while the other end
will always points towards the South.

42
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,400
That I know, but there is no compass around here.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,838
Then let's make one by ourselves!

44
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:32,680
Out of what?

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,239
We can use a needle! We just have to magnetize it.

46
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,280
And how is it supposed to turn around?

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:03:11,878
In a saucer of water.

48
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:13,680
Well, there you go!

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,439
Now one end is pointing in the direction of North
and the other - to the South.

50
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,319
But which points where? Well, there is the window.

51
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,438
So that can't be the right way. Then North is there!

52
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,479
I'm really liking this sharp little fellow we've got here!

53
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,280
You're calling me a little fellow?

54
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,519
No, it's just the way us pirates talk.

55
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,280
Alright then. North we go!

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,519
First head to the north until you see…

57
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,038
… a sleeping monster.

58
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:44,199
Maties, ahoy! Monster on the horizon!

59
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,360
Let him do it himself!

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,878
Now turn to the left and go three hundred paces more.

61
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:56,479
- Three hundred!?
- Exactly! I counted them myself.

62
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,400
OK.  Then that means I'll go…

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,360
One,

64
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,280
two,

65
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,719
three.

66
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:10,719
Now straight ahead until you get
right up to the giant tree.

67
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,959
You call that a tree?

68
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,639
Wow, amazing!

69
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,720
I can't believe my eyes! It's a real ship compass!

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,180
It's also called a marine compass.

71
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,339
The first compass was invented more than
a thousand years ago in ancient China.

72
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,360
With its help, the Chinese were able
to travel across the desert.

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,079
And about two hundred years later
the compass appeared in Europe.

74
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,639
Whether the Europeans came up with the idea
for the compass themselves

75
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,038
or took it from the Chinese isn't clear.

76
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,879
But one thing's for sure - we Fixies remember
how those early compasses were built.

77
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,560
The first compasses were made with a magnetized needle on top of a floater inside a bowl of water.

78
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,459
Later the needle was put on top of a pin
that let it spin freely.

79
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:03,279
And it started to look like the ones we use today.

80
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,279
Since the needle of a compass always
points to the north,

81
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,639
a sailor can easily figure out
which direction he needs to turn his ship.

82
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,399
If he wants to go north, he follows the needle north.

83
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,800
If he wants to go south he goes
in the opposite direction.

84
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,079
Your dad brought it home with him
late last night from his work.

85
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,238
You were asleep.

86
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,639
Hold on!

87
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,279
I want to check something.

88
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:33,639
What's up?

89
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,959
Yeah! They line up together!

90
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,560
Of course, they line up.

91
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,959
If not, how else would you have gotten here?

92
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,119
We're done with the needle. It has to go back.

93
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,279
First head south six hundred paces!

94
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:51,379
Six for you, matie!

95
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,779
I almost caught one yesterday,
I chased him but he fled.

96
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:00,399
But if I told my dad he’d say,
“It’s all inside your head!”

97
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,259
You really cannot catch them,
Or find their whereabouts.

98
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:20,500
But if you meet a Fixie, please,
Don’t let their secret out!

99
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,000
The Washing Machine

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,540
Look at that, Simka!

101
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,740
They're showing Titanic on the television!

102
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,279
Hey, Nolik! That's not a television!

103
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,379
That a machine for washing laundry.

104
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,560
No way!

105
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,660
Yeah, it's just a plain old washing machine,
Nolik, don't you know!?

106
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,600
Nuh-uh! Tell me about it.

107
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,540
You’re such a great explainer!

108
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,699
Inside of a washing machine is a big drum.

109
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,680
People put their dirty laundry in there and add
a special kind of soap called detergent.

110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,839
When they turn the washing machine on,

111
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,759
the drum fills with water and then
the motor starts to spin the drum.

112
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,800
That makes the laundry rub together,

113
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,660
forcing the soapy water in and the dirt out
to make your clothes clean.

114
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,439
After that, all that's left is to get out the water
by spinning the drum really fast

115
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,360
and sending the water down the drain.

116
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,060
Thanks a lot, Simka!

117
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,139
I always wondered why would you want
to put laundry inside a television!

118
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,879
Are you joking with me?

119
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,500
Uh-huh!

120
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,279
I'll show you a funny joke!

121
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,959
Get over here!!

122
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,620
Shh! It’s Tom Thomas’ mother!

123
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,439
She's got headphones on, we're safe.

124
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:48,699
She doesn't hear anything except the music.

125
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,899
Now she'll come back, add the soap,

126
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:54,920
turn on her television
and watch the second part of the movie.

127
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,579
Again with the jokes?!

128
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:04,699
This time I'm really gonna let you have it!

129
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:06,939
Nolik, just do what I say.

130
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,660
I came up with a plan.

131
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,959
What's your plan?

132
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:19,220
To run away!!!

133
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,360
Who is here?

134
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:50,100
Hello!?

135
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,879
There are a lot of things to keep in mind
with a washing machine to use it right.

136
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,139
For example, do you know what can happen
if you wash red and white shirts together?

137
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,419
Well, the white one might just turn pink.

138
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:03,799
No, it's not because it's embarrassed!

139
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:07,879
But because some of the color from the red shirt
happened to get onto the white one.

140
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,500
Another important thing to remember
is to empty your pockets before you wash your clothes.

141
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,059
Things like keys, nails and chewing gum
might not only ruin your clothes,

142
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,500
but they can destroy the washer too!

143
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,600
And this is only about little stuff.

144
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,059
Big things like music players and mobile phones

145
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,840
have managed to find their way
into the washing machine.

146
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,899
Oh sure, these things look nice and clean
after a good washing,

147
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,940
but they certainly don't seem to want to work anymore!

148
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,779
And never ever put a pet inside of a washing machine!

149
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:49,539
That's just no place for a living thing!

150
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:54,000
You know what, Simka,
I've never been laundered in my entire life!

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,620
We better get out of here, Nolik, right now!

152
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:08,120
And the faster, the better.

153
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,919
Come on. Lets get going.

154
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,419
And what about Chewsocka?

155
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,879
What about Chewsocka?

156
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,779
Let her get washed up a little in there.

157
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,200
Maybe it will make her nicer.

158
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:26,700
But she could drown, the poor thing.

159
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,519
I don't think we can do this alone.

160
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,120
We should get help from Tom Thomas’ mother!

161
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,500
One, two… Stop!

162
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,600
What?!

163
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:46,740
She moved out of the way!

164
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,059
And three!

165
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:56,519
Pull it!

166
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,419
Huh? What is that?

167
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:59,419
Oh!

168
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:04,539
Oh, my goodness!

169
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,600
Oh, my sweet little baby!

170
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,059
How did you get in there?

171
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:12,899
You wait right here in the tub
and I'll go get you a towel.

172
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,059
So, you wild little beast!

173
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,159
Looks like we saved your life.

174
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,320
We're friends now?

175
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,120
Nolik, it sure doesn't look like she wants to be our friend!

176
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
So what do we do now?

177
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:33,919
Same old plan! Run!!!

178
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,600
Can you believe that Fixies are
Such itty-bitty creatures?

179
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,799
Even when they’re magnified
It’s hard to see their features.

180
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,919
They’re tiny, infinitesimal,
So small it makes you doubt.

181
00:11:46,919 --> 00:12:02,679
But if you meet a Fixie, please,
Don’t let their secret out!

182
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:16,600
The Music Box

183
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,000
“And when the Pied Piper...

184
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,559
...began to play his magical...

185
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:31,399
...flute, the rats came out of their holes and...

186
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:39,239
...followed him. And they never would be seen
in Hamlin ever again!”

187
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,879
And then what? Huh?

188
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,239
I can’t read any more, my legs got tired.

189
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:50,078
Simka, Nolik! Something's rustling in there!

190
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:51,639
In where?

191
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,759
In Dad’s office, it's on his desk,

192
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,679
it's inside the wooden container!

193
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,759
So maybe there is a mouse inside it?

194
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:06,639
Tom Thomas, sit right here
while Nolik and I go and check.

195
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,679
And if there's a mouse in there for real,
then how are we gonna get it out?

196
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:13,239
Those rodents are really so big!

197
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:17,038
And why was I reading that book to you, huh?

198
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:20,600
Just grab a flute, give it a toot and the mice will scoot!

199
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,399
And where the flutes gonna come from?

200
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,839
We’ll make them!

201
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,000
Too-too-too-too- too-too!

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,119
You got it?

203
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,639
Sure I did!

204
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,119
Wait a second!

205
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:35,519
Let’s get a little closer.

206
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,679
- Too-too-too!
- Too-too-too!

207
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,879
See? It's just like I told you.

208
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,078
No more mice in there!

209
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:46,919
So let’s toot a little more so they won't go back in.

210
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,038
Alright!

211
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:51,879
So you're the ones messing around out here?

212
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,399
Oh, Grandpus, it's you here!

213
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,839
All day I can’t work on what I need to do!

214
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,318
Right from the start someone's opening up the top,
and then you two tooting!

215
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:03,479
It was Simka who came up with the tooting!

216
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:06,720
Just because you're afraid of mice!

217
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,119
Wow! What kind of machine is this?

218
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:11,759
Well, what do you think?

219
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,679
A coffee-grinder?

220
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,519
No.

221
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,078
A hole puncher!

222
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,158
Is it a foot scratcher?

223
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:21,078
- What?!
- What?!

224
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:24,720
Well, a machine for scratching your feet!

225
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,479
You're joking all the time, you!

226
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:31,158
It's a music box and it's just wonderful!

227
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:35,399
Music boxes were invented more than 200 years ago.

228
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,879
Inside there is usually a cylinder
with short pins sticking up from it.

229
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,759
In front of the cylinder there is a comb
with metal teeth of different lengths.

230
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,119
If you pluck one of the teeth,
it will make a pleasant sound.

231
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,600
A short tooth makes a higher sound,

232
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,000
and a long one – lower.

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,119
When the cylinder spins around,

234
00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:02,360
the pins pluck the different teeth and music plays.

235
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,119
Awesome! So what's broken in here?

236
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:07,279
The spring slipped off.

237
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,479
It has to be pushed back into the right place.

238
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:21,399
Will you help?

239
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,799
There we go, that's better!

240
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,799
How come the music's not playing?

241
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,759
First you have to wind up the spring with the key.

242
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,799
Tideesh!

243
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,279
I know who can wind up the spring!

244
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,639
Well, Tom Thomas, can you guess
what kind of machine this is?

245
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,200
- A paper cutter?
- Nah-huh!

246
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,919
How about a hole puncher?

247
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,158
You're such a joker!

248
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:45,360
Now don't go and tell me is a foot-scratcher!

249
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,559
Then I don't know.

250
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:58,399
Then wind it up with the key and you’ll find out!

251
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,000
Do you want to know
how the higher and lower sounds come out?

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,239
Put a regular ruler over the edge of a table,

253
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:09,000
hold down one end of the ruler and pluck on the other.

254
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,720
The shorter you make the end hanging off the table,

255
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,399
the higher the sound will be.

256
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,600
The teeth inside of a music box work the same way.

257
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,720
And bells work the same way too:

258
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,158
the smaller the bell, the higher it rings.

259
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:26,519
The sound of a violin or a guitar
depends on how thick the strings are.

260
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,720
Fat stings make a lower sound
and thin strings - a higher one.

261
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,438
How tight the string is also makes a difference.

262
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:35,839
Take a piece of string or a rubber band.

263
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,799
Tie one end to a doorknob and pull on the other end.

264
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,200
With your free hand pluck the string.

265
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,479
The tighter the string gets stretched out,
the higher the sound.

266
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:49,799
If you want, you can even play a tune!

267
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,078
I think I got it now. It’s an old player for music!

268
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,759
That's close, but not it.

269
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,919
A music box is what they call it!

270
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,360
I just said that.

271
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,559
So, what was in there?

272
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,158
Just a broken spring.

273
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:04,159
That's not the thing I'm dying to know.

274
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:05,959
Who was moving around there?

275
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,239
All I say is, we, Tom Thomas…

276
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:18,559
Won't let this secret out!

277
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,000
Fixies have a special sign
I happened to discover.

278
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,439
They hold three fingers in the air
And flash it to each other.

279
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,400
They send their greetings to you,
They sing them and they shout.

280
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:47,479
But if you meet a  Fixie, please,
Don’t let their secret out!

281
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:57,400
Modeling Clay

282
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,118
All done!

283
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:01,838
Simka!

284
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:03,239
Take a look!

285
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,559
I've got my own pack-o-mat!

286
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:08,759
Now look at that,
a pack-o-mat made out of modeling clay?

287
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,519
But this one's my own! And it looks just like a real one!

288
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,439
OK, you're right. It really does, Nolik.

289
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:17,118
Simka, Nolik! What's up?!

290
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:17,959
Hi there, Fire!

291
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,200
Wanna play some tag with me?

292
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,638
I really wish I could play tag,
but unlike you, I've got tons of work.

293
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:23,559
Yeah, like what?

294
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,959
Well, a bathroom hook fell down,

295
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:28,159
Tom Thomas broke the lamp on his desk,

296
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,400
the aquarium has a tube that's leaking.

297
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,599
So go and play! I have to get a pack-o-mat.

298
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,959
Oh-oh-oh!

299
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,439
"I wish I could play tag."

300
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,400
Hold on!

301
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,000
- Nolik, you’ve got a pack-o-mat!
- Uh-huh.

302
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,078
Although I've got to say it looks a little strange.

303
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:41,959
That's cause it's…

304
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,959
Let’s fix everything before Simka!

305
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,519
With your pack-o-mat and my fixiboard!

306
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:54,878
This will be great!

307
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:58,239
So where is that hook that fell down?

308
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,559
Alright.

309
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,159
Nolik, get out some sticky stuff.

310
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,159
From where?

311
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,318
Obviously! From out of your pack-o-mat.

312
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,799
But it isn't real!

313
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,959
I made it out of modeling clay today.

314
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,759
Out of clay?

315
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:16,838
Well it totally looks real.

316
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:19,159
Long ago, back in the Stone Age,

317
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,920
people learned how to use clay
to make their dishes and sculptures.

318
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,599
But the modeling clay that we use nowadays
was only invented about a hundred years ago.

319
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:34,759
Actually, modeling clay is just plain old clay
with some  ingredients added so it won’t dry out.

320
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:38,239
And dyes are mixed in to make all of the different colors.

321
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:45,400
There is just no end to all of the fun things
you can make out of modeling clay!

322
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,038
I got an idea! Go on, turn around!

323
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:50,118
What are you doing?

324
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:56,479
Grabbing glue out of your pack-o-mat.

325
00:19:56,479 --> 00:20:01,239
Alright, get up here!

326
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:03,200
Will it stick?

327
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,559
Yeah, of course it will!

328
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:14,239
Let’s go and fix the lamp!

329
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:17,279
We can’t fix this without a real pack-o-mat.

330
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:24,118
Yours will work just fine!

331
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:26,000
Tideesh!

332
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,759
So, what else did Simka have to fix?

333
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,159
The aquarium.

334
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:39,279
Hop on!

335
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,400
Well, where's that leaky tube?

336
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,559
Here! It's leaking at the joint.

337
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,720
Yeah, this tube is gonna need a lot of modeling clay.

338
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,439
Give me the rest of your pack-o-mat.

339
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:53,038
Sure!

340
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,118
And here's a souvenir.

341
00:20:58,118 --> 00:20:59,239
There. All done!

342
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,759
What's all done?

343
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,400
We already fixed everything!

344
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,959
And what did you fix it with?

345
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,838
Modeling clay.

346
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:08,159
Modeling clay isn't gonna hold anything.

347
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,599
Well I say it will.

348
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,439
Wanna bet?

349
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:16,680
Alright!

350
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,638
Ahhh! It's exploding!

351
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:22,078
What in the world is happening here?!

352
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:23,878
Flooding water!

353
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:25,759
You just do as I tell you!

354
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,599
Without panicking!

355
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,720
Did you know it's possible
to make modeling clay in your own home?

356
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,000
Just write down this recipe.

357
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,680
You’ll need a cup of flower,

358
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,200
a half a cup of salt

359
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,038
and half a cup of water.

360
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,318
Now mix the salt with the flour
and add the water little by little.

361
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:49,439
Mix it together really well.

362
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,599
What are you saying?

363
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,279
That it looks just like dough?

364
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,439
Well that's exactly what it is!

365
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,759
It's just not for eating – it’s way too salty.

366
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,519
But you certainly can sculpt things out of it.

367
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,078
If you want your modeling clay to be colorful,

368
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:06,479
you can add food coloring or watercolors to it.

369
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,400
That’s it!

370
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,599
Your modeling clay is ready to be sculpted.

371
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,799
When you're finished,
don’t forget to let your figures dry in the sun.

372
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:25,799
That way they'll get nice and hard
and last you a very long time.

373
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,318
Phew!

374
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:29,038
We almost didn't make it.

375
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,759
And did you fix the lamp with that modeling clay?

376
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,559
Uh-huh!

377
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,519
And the hook too.

378
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,118
That was not a good idea.

379
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:36,638
But it was really quick!

380
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:37,439
Hey!

381
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,078
That's true!

382
00:22:39,078 --> 00:22:41,359
That's why I want to give a medal to you.

383
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,519
You're heroes!

384
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,519
- For real?
- Of course you are!

385
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,200
And here it is!

386
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,359
Your medal!

387
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,680
But it’s made out of modeling clay.

388
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,539
Your reward fits your heroic deed!
