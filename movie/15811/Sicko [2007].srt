1
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:32,888
We got issue in America...

2
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,988
Too many good docs
are getting out of business.

3
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:39,881
Too many OB/GYNs
aren't able to practice their

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,487
Their love with women
all across this country.

5
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:52,243
I don't have a job.
I don't want to have more debts.

6
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:54,637
I don't pay off anything else
I already have out there.

7
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,035
This is Adam.

8
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:15,236
He had and accident.

9
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:31,691
He's one of nearly 50 million Americans,
with no health insurance.

10
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:47,108
But this film, isn't about Adam.

11
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:55,080
So this is the table saw.
It was spinning that way...

12
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:56,401
This is Rick.

13
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,110
I was gripping a piece of wood.

14
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:04,066
and I grabbed it here
and it hit a knot...

15
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:06,731
He sawed off the tops
of two of his fingers.

16
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,704
... and it was that quick.

17
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,745
His first thought?

18
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,883
I don't have insurance,
how much will it cost?

19
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:17,473
Am I gonna have to pay cash for this?

20
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,324
2 or 3 thousand dollars or more?

21
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,212
And does it mean
we're not gonna get a car?

22
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:25,922
Rick also doesn't have health coverage.

23
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:28,445
So the hospital gave him a choice.

24
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,460
Reattach the middle finger,

25
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,337
for $60,000,

26
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,020
or do the ring finger,

27
00:02:34,474 --> 00:02:35,912
for $12,000.

28
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:37,467
It's an awful feeling.

29
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:41,021
to just try
to put a value on your body.

30
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,674
Being a hopeless romantic,

31
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:49,875
Rick chose the ring finger,

32
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,652
for the bargain price of twelve grand.

33
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:54,833
The top of his middle finger

34
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:56,786
now enjoys its new home,

35
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:58,950
in an Oregon land fill.

36
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,026
I can do that thing, where, you know

37
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:10,158
the old man used to like
pull the finger off.

38
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,744
But this movie isn't about Rick either.

39
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:24,221
Yes, they are nearly 50 million
Americans with no health insurance.

40
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,637
They pray everyday they don't get sick,

41
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:29,815
because 18 thousand of them
will die this year,

42
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:32,358
simply because, they're uninsured.

43
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,793
But this movie isn't about them.

44
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:40,001
It's about the 250 million of you,

45
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:41,898
who have health insurance.

46
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:44,308
Those of you who are living

47
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,264
the American dream...

48
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:57,958
It's moving day,

49
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,982
for Larry

50
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:01,792
and Donna Smith.

51
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:09,694
They've packed everything they own,
in these two cars.

52
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,261
And are driving to Denver, Colorado,

53
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:17,820
to their new home...

54
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:24,024
... in their daughter's storage room.

55
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:26,645
This is home sweet home.

56
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:31,323
- Look at all that.
- We'll get everything organized.

57
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:33,169
We will...

58
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:36,047
- What do we do with the computer?
- It stays there.

59
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:42,584
So, this is where Heather talked about
we might have to put our bunk beds.

60
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:45,173
I see what she's talking about.

61
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:49,765
It wasn't suppose to end-up like this
for Larry and Donna.

62
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:53,216
They both had good jobs.

63
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,300
She was a newspaper editor

64
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,544
And he was a Union machinist.

65
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:01,886
They raised six kids

66
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:05,345
who all went to fine schools
like the University of Chicago.

67
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,195
But Larry had a heart attack...

68
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:11,773
and then another one...

69
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:14,663
and then another one.

70
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,487
And then Donna got cancer.

71
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,913
And even though
they had health insurance,

72
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:25,964
the co pays and the deductibles
soon ended up.

73
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:30,151
To the point where they could
no longer afford to keep their home.

74
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:33,078
Alright,
if somebody had told me 10 years ago

75
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,345
this was gonna happen to us
because of healthcare,

76
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,757
I would have said you're... :
"it's not possible.

77
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,534
"Not in the US,
we wouldn't let that happen to people."

78
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:41,683
My God...

79
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,430
- Are we gonna quit?
- No.

80
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,183
It's just hard.

81
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,009
They were bankrupt.

82
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:58,618
So they moved in, with their daughter.

83
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:00,847
We've got it all figured out.

84
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:04,167
We emptied the dresser
so you have a spot.

85
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:06,144
Nice, very nice.

86
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,177
Even their son Danny popped-in

87
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:14,103
from across town
to welcome them to Denver.

88
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:16,210
What do we do
about people like you guys.

89
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:18,980
- I don't know, that's a good question.
- Seriously.

90
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:21,978
Who will pay the deductible for 9,000$
is what I'm trying to understand.

91
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,626
that's part of healthcare.

92
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:25,459
What about the people
like Cathy and I

93
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,157
that have to come up there
and move you every 5 years,

94
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:30,788
every 2 years, every year
because you don’t have enough money

95
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,497
- to stay where you are.
- That's what Russell keeps saying too.

96
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:36,951
I'm sorry it's not
what we wanted to have happen in life.

97
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,152
And we're doing all what we can
to make the change.

98
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,587
You don't know
what that feels like inside

99
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,933
at fifty some years old,

100
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,978
to have to reach out
to my twenty-something year old

101
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,150
for help.

102
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:53,822
It's gonna be hard for
4, 5, 6, 7 month, it's gonna be hard.

103
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:56,409
Now I'm having an overwhelming feeling

104
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,361
of you bring your problems with you
no matter where you go.

105
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,054
Yeah.

106
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:04,040
But I don't know what to do about that.

107
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:12,564
By sheer coincidence
their daughter's husband, Paul,

108
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:16,051
was leaving on a job
the very same day they arrived.

109
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:17,430
We gotta go.

110
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,227
Paul was a contractor.

111
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:22,597
But they weren't many job lately.

112
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:24,481
So he found work out of town.

113
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:30,391
I'm sure you'll keep a telephone
on most days, you know.

114
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,351
Weird situation, ain't it?

115
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,585
You can tell me where dad is going?

116
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:52,100
Iraq...

117
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:55,098
Why is daddy going to Iraq?

118
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,354
To do some plumbing.

119
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:10,964
This I do earlier in the morning.
The first thing I do is I clean here.

120
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:18,450
At age 79, Frank Cardeal, should be
kicking back on a beach somewhere.

121
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:21,802
But even though
he's insured by Medicare,

122
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:24,853
it doesn't cover all the cost
of the drugs

123
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,576
that he and his wife need.

124
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:32,468
Being that I'm an employee here

125
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:36,744
my medicine is for free.
So that's why I gotta keep working.

126
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,574
Until I die.

127
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,626
There is nothing wrong with that.

128
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:47,814
I always gotta keep my ears open
because there's always spillage's.

129
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,392
Sometime you get a gallon of milk.

130
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:56,075
Tomato Sauce, oh, you're in trouble,
it'll take half an hour to clean that up

131
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,211
And I look on every aisle
to be sure every thing is clean

132
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:03,718
and if I seen something I pick it up
whether it's paper or garbage

133
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:08,295
One day I had the keys in my hand,

134
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:10,089
and they went in there.

135
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:13,280
And I had to climb in there
to get the keys out.

136
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,219
It's a sad situation.

137
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:24,050
If there are golden years,
I can find them,

138
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,902
I'll tell you that.

139
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,714
She had a painkiller for her hip.

140
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:33,802
The bill's suffering...
This is two hundred and thirteen dollars

141
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,986
- What, for a painkiller?
- I didn't take it.

142
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:39,795
I backed off, I said no,
I gotta come back.

143
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,199
What's in it? What's in theses new drug
that they all prescribe?

144
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,323
That's why I say,

145
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,698
I believe you need the half
of the things they tell you.

146
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:48,388
Because I have never taken medication.

147
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,896
And now, as I'm getting older,

148
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:53,016
I don't even like to take an aspirin.

149
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,955
I do like a little Brandy.

150
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,332
I don't really know how this happened

151
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:06,031
but the trunk kind of came forward
into the back seat.

152
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,723
Laura Burnem was in a 45 miles
an hour head on collision

153
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,166
that knocked her out cold.

154
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,048
Paramedics get her out of the car

155
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,033
and into an ambulance
for a trip to the hospital.

156
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:18,923
I get a bill from my insurance company,

157
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:21,315
telling me that the ambulance ride

158
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:25,137
was not going to be paid for
because it wasn't pre approuved.

159
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:28,733
I don't know exactly when I was supposed
to pre approuve it, you know...

160
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,548
like after I gain consciousness
in the car,

161
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,567
before I got in the ambulance or,

162
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,080
I should I've grab my cell phone
off from the street

163
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,943
and call while I was in the ambulance--
I mean

164
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,404
it's just crazy.

165
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:48,492
I've applied for Healthnet insurance,
for Jason.

166
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:52,983
They rejected him because of
his height and weight.

167
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,265
Jason is six feet tall
and a hundred and thirty pounds.

168
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:03,184
I applied for health care through
BlueCross BlueShield

169
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:07,180
and they answer me that my
body mass index was two high.

170
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,165
I'm five one, I weight
a hundred and seventy five pounds

171
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:17,808
I always thought that health insurance
companies were there to help us.

172
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,321
So I posted a note on the internet,

173
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,471
asking people if
they had had any similar stories

174
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:27,215
about problems
with their insurance company.

175
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:33,597
Within 24 hours,
I had over 3,700 responses,

176
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:35,445
and by the end of the week,

177
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:40,483
over 25.000 people had sent me
their healthcare horror stories.

178
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,505
Some of them decided not to wait for me
to get back to them.

179
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:50,183
Like Dough Noe, who decided
to take matters into his own hands,

180
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:51,999
without my permission.

181
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:57,617
His daughter Annette was 9 months old
when they discovered she as going deaf.

182
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:00,512
His health insurance company, CIGNA,

183
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:03,767
said they'd pay for an implant
in only one of her ears.

184
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:05,996
According to the letter they sent,

185
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,762
it's experimental,
for her to ear in two ears.

186
00:12:10,374 --> 00:12:13,232
If a Cochlear implant
is good for one ear,

187
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,502
it doesn't even make any sense that
it wouldn't be good for the second ear.

188
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:21,417
Especially when a child
is just starting to learn how to talk,

189
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:24,285
she has to learn
from both sides of her head.

190
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:29,919
That's when he sat down
to write CIGNA a letter.

191
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,598
This is to CIGNA.
"Noted filmmaker,

192
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:34,741
"Michael Moore is now in the process

193
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,859
"of gathering information
for his next film.

194
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,688
"I've sent along information concerning

195
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:40,912
CIGNA's lack of caring
for its policy holders.

196
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,803
"Has your C.E.O
ever been in a film before?"

197
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:47,659
Before he knew it,

198
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:51,451
he received a call in his voice mail
from CIGNA headquarters.

199
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:54,441
Tuesday 8:54 am.

200
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:15,921
Obviously all this worked

201
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:19,738
because Annette is going
to get her second implant in July.

202
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,691
- Dear Mike, I work in the industry...
- I work for an HMO...

203
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:27,460
I started to get hundreds of letters
of a different sort

204
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,587
from people who work inside
the health care industry.

205
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,258
- I want to tell you, I hate HMOs.
- They'd seen everything.

206
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,364
- And they were fed up.
- ...  a corrupt system.

207
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,159
Health insurance companies suck.
Flat suck.

208
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,673
Like Becky Melky

209
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:43,058
who was in charge
of keeping sick people away

210
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,819
from one of America’s top
insurance companies.

211
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:48,307
I work in a call center,
so people call in

212
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,428
and their asking for insurance quotes.

213
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,957
They are certain preexisting conditions

214
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:57,147
basically, industry-wide
that will not be covered, diabetes,

215
00:13:57,763 --> 00:14:00,115
heart deceases,
certain forms of cancer,

216
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,968
that if you have these conditions

217
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,708
you almost likely not going
to get your health insurance.

218
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:07,887
How long is this list of conditions
that would make you ineligible?

219
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:10,111
It's a very long list.

220
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,959
A long list...

221
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:15,176
You could wrap around this house...

222
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,899
Sometimes you know ahead of time
that they're gonna be declined

223
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:46,166
at the end of the application,
and you're like

224
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,057
God, you know like one time
I got a couple,

225
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:52,315
and they were so happy to get...

226
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:56,881
They were so happy that they were...
I took them through this application.

227
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,088
And the husband was late for work.

228
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:04,529
And the wife said to him don't worry
baby, it's gonna be okay because...

229
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:06,520
we have health insurance now.

230
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,808
And when I looked at their application,

231
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,818
I could tell they were both
gonna get declined

232
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,465
because of their health conditions.
And they were so happy...

233
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:17,036
I thought God, they're gonna get
that phone call in a couple of weeks

234
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,434
telling them
that they're not eligible for insurance.

235
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,087
And I just felt so bad
because I just really thought

236
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:26,505
and I knew and I couldn't say anything
to them.

237
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:28,951
I just felt like crap.

238
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:32,078
And that's why I'm such a bitch
on the phone

239
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:35,000
to people, because I don't wanna
get to know them, I don't wanna...

240
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:37,173
I don't wanna know
about their lives, I just...

241
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,084
wanna get in, and get out,
and get done with it because I can't...

242
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,845
I can't take the stress I'm...

243
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:46,082
In spite of Becky being
a bit of a pain on the phone,

244
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:48,725
a quarter of billion Americans

245
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:51,268
are still able to get health insurance.

246
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:55,046
Call toll free.

247
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:58,708
Let's meet some of these
happy insured customers,

248
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,105
like Maria, who has Blue Shield,

249
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:03,906
and Diane, who has Horizon Blue Cross.

250
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:06,667
Laura has insurance through BCS,

251
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:09,379
and Amy is fully insured by Megalife.

252
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,543
And it's good thing
that they're all fully covered,

253
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:15,890
I ended out being diagnosed
with rachio-cancer.

254
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,146
Brain tumor.

255
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:18,332
Breast cancer.

256
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,032
Brain tumor on the right temporal lobe.

257
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,432
Because they were insured,

258
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:24,631
they got the red carpet treatment
at the doctor's office.

259
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:26,159
She requested

260
00:16:26,398 --> 00:16:28,663
for me to see a neurologist.

261
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,927
The way they were gonna treat it
was to remove it.

262
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,874
The surgery was scheduled
for December 9th.

263
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:35,924
I was waiting for my first dose
of chemo.

264
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,253
They got their treatment, all right,

265
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:41,163
But not before battling
with their insurance companies.

266
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:42,812
My insurance company

267
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,494
denied all IV drugs for me.

268
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:48,196
And all I was getting was IV drugs.

269
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,805
This was a preexisting condition.

270
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:51,691
It's not medically necessary.

271
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,877
We don't consider that life threatening.

272
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:57,383
Diane died
from her non-threatening tumor.

273
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:00,696
Laura's cancer is now spread
throughout her body.

274
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:03,428
Amy's cancer found its way
through the brain

275
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,256
and killed her a couple of years later.

276
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,133
While vacationing in Japan,

277
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:08,553
Maria became ill

278
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:12,030
and got the MRI
that Blue Shield of California

279
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:13,659
had refused to approve.

280
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:17,274
The doctors in Japan told her
she had a brain tumor.

281
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:20,860
Blue Shield had said repeatedly
she didn't have a  tumor.

282
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:23,314
That's when she said...

283
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:26,429
Well, I'm pretty sure I have a lawyer.

284
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,501
March 13, 2003.

285
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:33,997
Let me direct your attention
to exhibit one.

286
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,759
Please, describe for me what it is.

287
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:41,278
It is a denial for referral

288
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:43,374
to an ophthalmologist.

289
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:46,434
- Is it your signature on the document?
- Yes.

290
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,569
Let me direct your attention
to exhibit 2.

291
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:52,794
This is a denial of...

292
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:58,280
a request for referral for a Magnetic
Resonance Imaging test of the brain.

293
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,297
- It has your signature?
- Yes.

294
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:03,271
I'd like to direct your attention
to exhibit 3.

295
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,596
Please, read this document.

296
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:08,007
This is a denial of a referral to

297
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,350
a neurosurgeon.

298
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:14,781
Can you explain for me
how you came to sign

299
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,507
the denial letter?

300
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:20,087
This is a standard signature
that's put on all denial letters.

301
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:22,114
Is that your signature or is that stamp?

302
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:23,498
That is a stamp.

303
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:25,630
Did you ever see

304
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:28,315
a denial letter

305
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,258
before your signature was stamped on it?

306
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:33,180
No, but the denial letters
are fundamentally

307
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:34,952
the same there.

308
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,453
The denial letters that are sent out...

309
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:39,152
- The answer is no.
- No.

310
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
All right.

311
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,947
The very definition
of a medical director

312
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:46,425
is somebody who can save
the company a lot of money.

313
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:50,056
Doctor Linda Pino
was a medical reviewer for Humana.

314
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:53,669
She left her job
because she didn't like their way

315
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,084
of doing business.

316
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:59,403
You look at a particular case
or a question at hand,

317
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,733
and you start looking for ways
to deny in order to save money.

318
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,993
I mean, that's your goal.
So, you look to the language which says

319
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,148
there's exclusion,
and you say: "Ha, ha...

320
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:10,193
"this is great,
this is a technical denial."

321
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:12,960
I don't have to get to any of the kind
of muddy issue.

322
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,248
I can just deny it.

323
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,964
The doctor with the highest percent
of denials

324
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,873
- was actually gonna get a bonus.
- Really?

325
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:20,901
That was the way
they had set the system out.

326
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:24,563
Any payment for a claim
is referred to as a medical loss.

327
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:27,339
That's the terminology
the industry uses.

328
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,102
I mean, when you don't spend money
on somebody, you deny their care,

329
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:33,813
or you make a decision

330
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:36,036
that brings money in
and you don't have to spend it,

331
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:37,598
it's a savings to the company.

332
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,955
This is Tarsha Harris.

333
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,640
Blue Cross didn't deny her
her treatment,

334
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,106
and actually approved her operation.

335
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:51,316
But then, they discovered

336
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,097
that in a distant past,

337
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,426
she had had...

338
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:56,476
yeast infection.

339
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:01,492
Apparently, it's common.
Men, women can get

340
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:02,697
a yeast infection.

341
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,410
So, I was prescribed the yeast infection
cream, general cream,

342
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,624
and it went away.

343
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:12,277
She later applied for health insurance

344
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,598
and that's what you're supposed
to be disclosing, serious ailments.

345
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:20,167
The yeast infection was independent
and it's not a serious ailment.

346
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:22,112
There was nothing else
she could have done.

347
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:25,304
It wasn't until they were gonna have
to spend money that they looked.

348
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,631
If they'd taken 5 minutes beforehand,

349
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,549
and wanted to clear up
the yeast infection,

350
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:32,507
they could've looked in her medical
records or talked to her doctor.

351
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,154
Because of the undisclosed
yeast infection,

352
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,095
Blue Cross dropped Tarsha Harris.

353
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,333
She thinks she's put this behind her.

354
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,643
And then, Blue Cross changes their mind,

355
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:45,191
tells the doctors
we're taking the money back,

356
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:47,585
go get the money from Tarsha.

357
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:50,234
The fact in the matter is

358
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:52,992
it was a yeast infection.
That's all it was.

359
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:55,238
I'm still a little bitter

360
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:57,845
because I don't trust
insurance companies now.

361
00:20:58,046 --> 00:21:01,712
To me, it seems they're always
gonna be looking for a way out.

362
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,551
You know, what happened
to helping the person that's sick?

363
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:06,707
Don't make their problems worse?

364
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:10,529
This is Lee Inerm.

365
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:14,684
If they weren't able to weed you out
in the application process,

366
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:17,935
or deny you the care
your doctor said you needed,

367
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:21,588
and somehow ended up paying
for the operation,

368
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,382
they send in Lee,

369
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,953
their hitman.

370
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,993
His job is to get
the company's money back

371
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,655
any way he can.

372
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:32,454
All he has to do

373
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:35,084
is find one slip up on your application

374
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:37,231
or a preexisting condition

375
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:39,020
you didn't know you had.

376
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:42,362
We're gonna go after this
like it's a murder case.

377
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:45,801
And I mean my whole unit dedicated

378
00:21:45,992 --> 00:21:49,901
to going through your health history
for the last five years,

379
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:52,705
looking for anything
that would indicated

380
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,504
that you concealed something,
you misrepresented something,

381
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:58,659
so that they can cancel the policy,

382
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:02,731
or chart the rate so high
you can't pay them.

383
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,682
And if we didn't find anything
you didn't disclose

384
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:11,804
on the application, you can still
get hit with a preexisting denial.

385
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:15,512
Because you don't even have
to have sought medical treatment for it.

386
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,106
In some states,
it's legal to have what's called

387
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:20,782
"Prudent Person Preexisting Condition",

388
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:22,864
and that's a mouthful, I know,

389
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,174
but what that says is if prior
to your insurance kicking in,

390
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,379
you had any symptom, which would incline

391
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:35,233
a normally prudent person
to have sought medical care,

392
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:40,280
then, the condition of which
that symptom was a symptom

393
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:42,407
is excluded.

394
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,750
I know!

395
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:51,732
It's labyrinthine, isn't it?
But that's how it works.

396
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,590
They're supposed to be fair
and even-handed,

397
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,530
but with an insurance company,
it's their frigging money!

398
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,617
So, it's not unintentional,

399
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:02,715
it's not a mistake,

400
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:04,341
it's not an oversight,

401
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:06,752
you're not slipping through the cracks,

402
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:10,140
somebody made that crack
and swept you towards it.

403
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:14,367
And the intent is to maximize profits.

404
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,970
Looking back, I don't know
that I killed anybody.

405
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:21,564
Did I do harm in people's life?

406
00:23:22,258 --> 00:23:23,258
Yeah.

407
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:25,057
Hell, yeah.

408
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:30,508
I haven't worked for insurance companies
for a long time,

409
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:34,600
and I don't think
that really serves to atone

410
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,038
for my...

411
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:39,018
participation in that mess.

412
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,616
I am glad I'm out of it, though.

413
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:48,359
Julie Pierce was struggling to get care

414
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:50,031
for her husband Tracy,

415
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,789
who was suffering from kidney cancer.

416
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:57,757
Julie works in the intensive care unit
at Saint Joseph medical center,

417
00:23:58,013 --> 00:23:59,620
in Kansas City, Missouri,

418
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,973
which provided her family
with health insurance.

419
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:06,370
Every month, there was a new drug
that the doctors wanted to try.

420
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,119
My insurance denied it.

421
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:11,831
One letter might say
not a medical necessity,

422
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:16,871
one letter might say it's not
for this particular type of cancer,

423
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:18,844
and they denied it.

424
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,747
Then, we came up with the bone marrow

425
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:24,150
It had showed to stop it,

426
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:26,470
sometimes, completely get rid of it.

427
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:31,493
Tracy's doctors said that this treatment
had been successfully tried

428
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,420
on many other patients.

429
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:37,867
If one of Tracy's brothers turned out
to be a suitable donor,

430
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:40,771
they were promising
bone marrow treatments

431
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,355
forbidding Tracy's cancer.

432
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,258
Two weeks later, the bone marrow
nurse at KU called me and she goes,

433
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,753
we've got the results back. His youngest
brother is a perfect donor match.

434
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:55,237
We were ecstatic.

435
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,461
You know,

436
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,004
I think that's a  the happiest
I had seen him

437
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,990
in a while.

438
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:06,516
So,

439
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:09,385
we submitted it, and they denied it.

440
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,321
Said it was experimental.

441
00:25:13,448 --> 00:25:17,476
So, I found out that there is a board
of trustees over our medical plan

442
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:19,234
that actually work at my hospital.

443
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:23,179
And they are the final decision makers
on what gets approved

444
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:24,531
and what doesn't get approved.

445
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:28,147
Julie and her husband
and their son, Tracy Junior,

446
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,690
demanded a meeting with the health
plan's board of trustees

447
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:35,234
the very people who had the power
to approve their claim.

448
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:38,457
They told Julie
that they were sympathetic

449
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:39,818
to her situation.

450
00:25:40,547 --> 00:25:42,319
I said, your sympathy does me no good

451
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:43,981
when I'm burying him next year.

452
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:48,054
And I told them, I said if I was...

453
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:50,447
Bruce Van Cleef was our CEO, I said,

454
00:25:51,013 --> 00:25:53,068
I bet if it was Bruce Van Cleef's wife,

455
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:54,757
it were to get approved.

456
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,309
No, it's nothing like that!

457
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,747
And I said, or maybe
if my husband was white..."

458
00:26:01,222 --> 00:26:02,865
And I got up and walked out of the room.

459
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:05,853
When we got home,

460
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:08,099
I found him up in the bathroom,

461
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:12,160
and I knocked on the door and said,
"What are you doing in there?"

462
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:15,405
"Nothing". And I opened the door

463
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:18,327
because usually, he'll say:
"What do you think I'm doing in here?"

464
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:21,200
And he was sitting there
and he was crying.

465
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:25,610
And he said: Why me?

466
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:27,711
"I'm a good person".

467
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:30,724
And I said:
But we're not done fighting this.

468
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:33,720
We're strong, yeah.

469
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:35,706
And he said...

470
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,149
You know, he goes:
I can see now that I'm gonna die.

471
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:43,049
He said:
"But I can leave everything in the world

472
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:45,861
"but I don't want to leave you
and Tracy."

473
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:52,993
The doctor told me
he would die in three weeks.

474
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:55,514
And...

475
00:26:57,943 --> 00:27:00,244
On January 13th, which was my birthday,

476
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,119
he went to sleep,

477
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:07,982
and he died five days later,
here at home.

478
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,256
He was my best friend,

479
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:14,521
he was my soul mate,

480
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,858
he was my son's father.

481
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,315
I mean, we were to grow old together.

482
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:26,430
They took away everything that matters.

483
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:32,074
I wanna know why, why my husband.

484
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:36,465
Why wasn't he given the chance to live.

485
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:40,186
You preach these vision and values

486
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,597
that we care for the sick,
the dying, the poor...

487
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:44,286
that we're a healthcare

488
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:46,022
that leaves no one behind.

489
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:50,041
You left him behind!
You didn't even give him a start!

490
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:53,950
It was as if he was nothing.

491
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,123
And I want them
to have a conscious about it.

492
00:27:58,871 --> 00:27:59,894
And I don't think they do!

493
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,954
I don't think it has faced them
one bit...

494
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:06,668
at all.

495
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:12,811
There was one person
in the healthcare industry

496
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,528
who did have a conscience.

497
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:16,610
Dr. Linda Pino,

498
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,724
former medical reviewer at Humana.

499
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,678
My name is Linda Pino,

500
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:26,162
I am here primarily today
to make a public confession.

501
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:29,129
On spring of 1997,

502
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,655
as a physician,

503
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:34,435
I denied a man a necessary operation

504
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:37,396
that would have saved his life
and thus caused his death.

505
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:43,117
No person and no group
has held me accountable for this,

506
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,134
because in fact, what I did was

507
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:48,464
I saved the company
a half a million dollars for this.

508
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:52,544
And, furthermore, this particular act

509
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:55,598
secured my reputation
as a good medical director,

510
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,753
and it insured my continued advancement
in the healthcare field.

511
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:03,022
I went from making
a few hundred dollars a week

512
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:04,410
as a medical reviewer

513
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:08,410
to an escalating six figure income
as a position executive.

514
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:12,382
In all my work, I had one primary duty,

515
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:15,286
and that was to use my medical expertise

516
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:19,021
for the financial benefit
of the organization for which I worked.

517
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:23,487
And I was told repeatedly
that I was not denying care,

518
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,469
I was simply denying payment.

519
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:28,894
I know how manage care maims
and kills patients.

520
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,547
So, I'm here to tell you about
the dirty work of manage care.

521
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,858
And I'm haunted by the thousands
of pieces of paper

522
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:38,459
on which I have written
that deadly word: denied.

523
00:29:39,354 --> 00:29:40,354
Thank you.

524
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,430
How did we get to the point

525
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:48,995
doctors and health insurance companies

526
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:52,939
actually being responsible
for the death of patients?

527
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:57,164
Who invented this system?

528
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:01,526
How did this all begin?

529
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:06,606
Where did the HMO start?

530
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:13,684
Thanks to the wonders of magnetic tape,

531
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:15,176
we know.

532
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,639
I am proposing today
a new national health strategy.

533
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,041
The purpose of this program
is simply this:

534
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,511
I want America to have
the finest health care in the world,

535
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:31,354
and I want every American

536
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,461
to be able to have that care
when he needs it.

537
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,414
The plan hatched between Nixon
and Edgar Kaiser worked.

538
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:44,850
In the ensuing years,
patients were given less and less care.

539
00:31:45,055 --> 00:31:47,476
Bigger logs-in in the nearby
public hospitals

540
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:49,332
and less quality medical care.

541
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:52,436
Been here 'bout 18 hours,
since 7 in the morning.

542
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:56,388
What looks cramped and unsightly
can also be dangerous.

543
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,408
While the health insurance company
became wealthy,

544
00:32:00,015 --> 00:32:01,928
the system was broken.

545
00:32:02,202 --> 00:32:04,514
37 millions Americans
are without protection

546
00:32:04,637 --> 00:32:06,197
against catastrophic illness.

547
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:07,976
The losers are the poor,

548
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:10,718
who may now postpone
urgently needed healthcare

549
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,326
until it's too late.

550
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,621
This went on for years,

551
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,932
until this man road into town,

552
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:21,449
bringing with him his little lady.

553
00:32:28,408 --> 00:32:29,678
Sassy.

554
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,480
Smart.

555
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:38,348
Sexy.

556
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,119
Some men couldn't handle it.

557
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,454
Today I am announcing the formation

558
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:50,684
of the president's task force
on national health reform.

559
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:53,649
chaired by the First Lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

560
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:58,061
Hillary Rodham Clinton
decided to make healthcare for everyone.

561
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,581
her top priority.

562
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:01,895
Universal coverage now!

563
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,999
It will not depend upon where you work,
whether you work

564
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:07,147
or whether you have
a pre-existing condition.

565
00:33:07,312 --> 00:33:09,987
Healthcares,
they can never be taken away.

566
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:12,929
Some republicans complain
Mrs. Clinton is getting a free ride

567
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:14,625
because she's the President's wife.

568
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:16,885
It's fairly risky business, I believe,

569
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,574
what President Clinton did,
to put his wife in charge

570
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:21,629
of some big policy program.

571
00:33:22,027 --> 00:33:23,942
and while I don't share
the chairman's joy

572
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:28,035
at the holding hearings
on a government-run healthcare system.

573
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:31,032
I do share his intention
to make the debate

574
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:33,714
in the legislature process
as exciting as possible.

575
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:36,889
I'm sure you will do that, Mr. Armey.

576
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:40,597
- We'll do the best we can.
- You and Dr. Kevorkian, I think.

577
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:51,046
I have been told about your charm
and wit, and let me say...

578
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:55,038
The reports on your charm
are overstated,

579
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:56,998
the reports on your wit
are understated.

580
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,902
Thank you, thank you very much.

581
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:02,768
She drove Washington insane.

582
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,701
Do you really want the federal
government to control your healthcare?

583
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:07,931
You won’t have the choice
of your own doctors.

584
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:10,160
- Less government...
- More government control.

585
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,702
- More government...
- Less control for you and your family.

586
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:14,235
When your mama gets sick,

587
00:34:14,372 --> 00:34:16,862
she might talk to a bureaucrat
instead of a doctor.

588
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:19,864
This is a total mess,
and it's about to get messier.

589
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,082
Not this big, bureaucratic,
socialistic plan that they have!

590
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:25,559
- Socialist takeover...
- Socialized medicine.

591
00:34:25,716 --> 00:34:28,069
What really amounts
to a giant social experiment.

592
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:38,414
Nothing puts more fear in us
that the thought of that.

593
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:42,516
And the chiefs fear mongers
against socialized medicine

594
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,315
have always been the good doctors

595
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:47,559
of the American Medical Association.

596
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:50,982
This would put the government smack
into your hospital,

597
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:52,776
defining services,

598
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,179
setting standards,

599
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,862
establishing committees,

600
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,504
calling for reports,

601
00:34:57,682 --> 00:35:00,093
deciding who gets in and who gets out.

602
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:02,076
After all, the government has to treat

603
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,094
everyone fair and equal,
don't you know?

604
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:06,343
Take us all the way, down the road

605
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,958
to a new system of medicine
for everybody.

606
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,807
Yes, medicine for everyone,

607
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,206
the AMA didn't want that

608
00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:17,307
And to drive the point home further,

609
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:21,115
they held thousands of coffee clatches
all over the country,

610
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,519
where they invited their neighbors

611
00:35:23,644 --> 00:35:25,587
to come and listen to a record,

612
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,831
made by a well-known actor,

613
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,721
on the evils of socialized medicine.

614
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,687
My name is Ronald Reagan.

615
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,771
One of the traditional methods

616
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:37,603
of imposing statism or socialism
on our people,

617
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:39,964
has been by way of medicine.

618
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:42,338
The doctor begins to lose freedom.

619
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:45,287
It's like telling a lie,
and one leads to another

620
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:48,800
A doctor decides he wants to practice
in one town.

621
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,674
And the government has to say to him :
"You can't live in that town,

622
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:54,944
"they already have enough doctors,
you have to go some place else."

623
00:35:55,601 --> 00:35:57,079
All of us can see what happens,

624
00:35:57,229 --> 00:35:59,080
once you established a precedent,

625
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:01,913
that a government can determine a man's

626
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:04,540
working place and his working methods

627
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:07,570
and behind,
it will come other federal programs

628
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:11,133
that will invade every area of freedom
as we have known it in this country.

629
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,612
Until, on day, we will awake to find...

630
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,803
that we have socialism.

631
00:36:20,418 --> 00:36:23,002
The White House said today it's time
to turn down the rhetoric,

632
00:36:23,136 --> 00:36:25,626
reacting to burning an effigy
of Hillary Rodham Clinton.

633
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:27,456
The times may have changed

634
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,413
but the scare tactics hadn't.

635
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:33,092
The healthcare industries spent
over a hundred millions dollars

636
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:35,549
to defeat Hillary's healthcare plan

637
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,322
and they succeeded.

638
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,136
And I want to introduce to you

639
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:42,794
the president, because he loves

640
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,614
the Easter egg role.

641
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,030
For the next seven years
in the White House,

642
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,284
she was not allowed
to bring it up again.

643
00:36:49,414 --> 00:36:51,374
Is anybody here older than two?

644
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,544
A decade and a half went by,

645
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:57,141
and still America
had no universal health plan.

646
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,580
The United States slipped to number 37
in healthcare around the world,

647
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,982
just slightly ahead of Slovenia.

648
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:11,606
But that's understandable,

649
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,164
because Congress was busy
with other matters.

650
00:37:15,248 --> 00:37:17,901
Mister speaker, today I rise
to offer congratulations

651
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,469
to the confectioners
of Just Born Incorporated,

652
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,049
as they celebrate
the fiftieth anniversary

653
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,073
of one of their most recognized
and celebrated products,

654
00:37:26,216 --> 00:37:29,061
not to mention my daughter's favorite,
Marshmallow Peeps.

655
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,394
And thus the healthcare industry
went unchecked

656
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:34,761
into the early twenty-first century.

657
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:37,112
Humana more than doubled
its 4th quarter profit,

658
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:39,287
lifts its earning outlook
for the year as well...

659
00:37:39,427 --> 00:37:41,795
United Health has tripled
its share's prices.

660
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:43,799
Making obscene profits...

661
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,449
... better than unexpected earnings,
one of them....

662
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:48,978
There's a lot of really wealthy
shareholders, out there.

663
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,356
Are they willing to actually
share some of that wealth?

664
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:54,061
Turning their CEOs into billionaires...

665
00:37:55,627 --> 00:37:58,174
and skirting the law
whenever they wanted.

666
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,349
But their biggest accomplishment

667
00:38:02,526 --> 00:38:04,907
was buying our United States Congress.

668
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:06,829
This is Washington at work.

669
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,869
Lobbying has become so brazen,
the money is being collected...

670
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:12,736
With four time
as many healthcare lobbyists

671
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,024
than they are members of Congress.

672
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:18,286
They even manage to buy off old foes.

673
00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:21,428
For her silence, Hillary was rewarded,

674
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:25,302
and she became the second
largest recipient in the Senate

675
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:27,828
of healthcare industry contributions.

676
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:35,168
We've given
the entire health care system

677
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,399
over to the insurance industry.

678
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,144
And they have total control.

679
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:41,241
Well, not total control.

680
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,247
Drug companies like to buy
their members of Congress too.

681
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:48,715
Here is what it costs to buy these men.

682
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:51,419
And this woman.

683
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:55,223
This guy.

684
00:38:56,122 --> 00:38:57,359
And this guy.

685
00:38:57,764 --> 00:38:59,058
And him too.

686
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:03,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

687
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:07,168
And the biggest check
was saved for last.

688
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,405
Why did they hand out all this cash?

689
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,878
They wanted a bill passed.

690
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,135
A bill to help seniors
with their prescriptions.

691
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,709
Let there be no mistake about it.

692
00:39:20,052 --> 00:39:23,445
Republicans love their mothers and
their fathers and their grand-parents.

693
00:39:23,691 --> 00:39:25,484
as much as anybody else on this Hill

694
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:27,693
And we're gonna take care
of them in this country.

695
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:33,836
Of course, it was really a bill to hand
over 800 billion of our tax dollars

696
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:36,252
to the drug and health
insurance industry.

697
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:38,261
by letting the drug companies charge,

698
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:39,780
whatever they wanted,

699
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,379
and making the private health
insurance companies,

700
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,706
the middle man.

701
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:46,112
Everybody was going to get their cut.

702
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,052
The man they appointed
to get the job done,

703
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,313
was congressman Billy Tauzin.

704
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,913
He was the right man for the job,

705
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,820
because he had a secret weapon.

706
00:39:57,556 --> 00:39:59,536
No one in this house loves their mother

707
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:01,226
more than I love my mother.

708
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:02,738
I'd challenge you on that, sir.

709
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,738
Nobody in this... body,

710
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,971
loves their mother any more or
any less than anyone of us.

711
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,313
I love that woman.

712
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:13,427
Do you think for a second
you love your moms and dads

713
00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:15,439
any more than we love ours?

714
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:18,190
Do you think Republicans and Democrats

715
00:40:18,368 --> 00:40:20,667
will vote for you?
Do you really believe that, Mr. Stark?

716
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:22,784
God bless you.

717
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,452
They all loved their mothers,

718
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:28,843
it's just that they didn't love
our mothers...

719
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:30,354
as much.

720
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,753
Now I'm honored and pleased to sign

721
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,482
this historic piece of legislation,

722
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:40,115
the Medicare Prescription Drug
Improvement and Modernization Act

723
00:40:40,895 --> 00:40:42,769
of 2003.

724
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,381
What they didn't tell us,

725
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,606
was that the elderly could end up
paying more for that prescriptions

726
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:51,479
than they did before.

727
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:54,015
Over two thirds of senior citizens

728
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,677
would still pay
over 2000 dollars a year.

729
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,899
And when it was all over,

730
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,017
14 congressional aids,
who worked on the bill,

731
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:05,056
quit their jobs on the Hill,

732
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:07,985
and went to work
for the healthcare industry.

733
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:11,481
As did one congressman.

734
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:17,833
Billy Tauzin left Congress,

735
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:20,091
to become the CEO of Phrma,

736
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:22,173
a drug industry lobby,

737
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,886
for the salary of 2 millions dollars
a year.

738
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:30,053
Oh, it was a happy day in Washington.

739
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,549
Many Americans knew

740
00:41:33,161 --> 00:41:35,989
they were never going to see
universal healthcare,

741
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,453
and that's why some of them

742
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,413
decided to look elsewhere for help.

743
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,066
We're driving across the Detroit river.

744
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,799
Back there is the Renaissance Center,

745
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:54,494
you can see the Renaissance Center,
General Motors headquarters,

746
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,830
downtown Detroit, the skyline...

747
00:41:57,528 --> 00:42:00,237
You get a really nice view
from driving over the bridge.

748
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,510
This is Adrian Campbell,

749
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,248
a single mother,

750
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,166
who at the age of 22

751
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,818
came down with cancer.

752
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,855
I got cervical cancer and i was denied
through the insurance company.

753
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:16,774
They say "We're not paying for
because you're 22 and you don't have...

754
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:19,256
"You shouldn't be having
cervical cancer."

755
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:20,596
"You're too young."

756
00:42:21,317 --> 00:42:24,176
Forced into debt, but now cancer free,

757
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:27,373
Adrian was fed up
with the American care system.

758
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:29,473
She had a new plan.

759
00:42:29,701 --> 00:42:32,423
I have everything ready,
before I even hit the border.

760
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:36,355
I got my passport ready, I got my money
out for the... You know, the...

761
00:42:36,643 --> 00:42:39,448
3 dollars and 25 cents
to get across one-way.

762
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:44,757
And I got everything just sitting
up here on my visor just ready to go.

763
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:51,694
Now Laura, be very quiet.

764
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:57,538
- Citizenship?
- US.

765
00:42:57,668 --> 00:42:59,399
- Where do you live?
- I live in Michigan.

766
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:01,507
- That's not on, right?
- No.

767
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:04,664
She may live in Michigan

768
00:43:05,868 --> 00:43:07,934
but ten blocks across the border,

769
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,711
Adrian becomes a Canadian.

770
00:43:11,062 --> 00:43:12,687
How long have you been living here?

771
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,577
- 3 months?
- A couple.

772
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:18,211
I haven't applied for the ??? card yet

773
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:20,743
- I still have mine.
- It takes 10 minutes.

774
00:43:20,921 --> 00:43:22,787
That's fine, I don't mind.

775
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:24,227
OK, thank you.

776
00:43:24,456 --> 00:43:27,015
I put down Kyle's address,
at the clinic,

777
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:29,938
and when they ask, you know,
what my relationship is

778
00:43:30,088 --> 00:43:34,016
I put down that I was
his common-law ... partner.

779
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,319
I don't like to lie
and I don't like liars,

780
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,880
it's little white lies, but it's...

781
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:41,425
You know, I'm saving the money.

782
00:43:42,337 --> 00:43:44,786
You don't have to bring a check
when you go to hospital here.

783
00:43:44,943 --> 00:43:47,379
You know, it's provided to us.

784
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:51,046
Something you don't have to worry about,
you don't have to fight to get it.

785
00:43:51,883 --> 00:43:53,188
Stress free.

786
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,750
They're calling the cops.

787
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:01,361
The presence of our camera crew

788
00:44:01,497 --> 00:44:03,550
has alerted the clinic that
something was up.

789
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:05,460
And I don't think
I'm gonna get seen now.

790
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,696
So I have another idea.

791
00:44:08,695 --> 00:44:10,905
I'm gonna go down to the other clinic.

792
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,039
There is...
There is a clinic down...

793
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:15,949
One that we passed.

794
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,515
The police showed up over there?

795
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:19,851
Look.

796
00:44:21,233 --> 00:44:23,716
Yes, what Adrian was doing was illegal.

797
00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:25,322
But we're Americans.

798
00:44:25,683 --> 00:44:27,924
We go into other countries
when we need to.

799
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,247
It's tricky, but it's allowed.

800
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:36,818
It's kind of frustrating I haven't...
I mean...

801
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:39,274
I'd just get married
and that'd solve everything.

802
00:44:39,423 --> 00:44:40,775
She'd be covered automatically

803
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:43,943
Americans marry Canadians
just for the healthcare.

804
00:44:44,744 --> 00:44:45,784
We're used.

805
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,076
Sounds like a good idea.

806
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:49,858
See if it works.

807
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:51,648
Start something... start a trend.

808
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:57,940
In Canada, they give everybody free
healthcare, doesn't it work up there?

809
00:44:59,585 --> 00:45:00,975
We wait months to get treatment

810
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:03,220
you can get in a week
or a few days here.

811
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:06,731
In Canada,
you'd have to wait 9 to 10 months,

812
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,971
for bypass surgery.

813
00:45:08,091 --> 00:45:09,398
Many Canadians believe

814
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,839
it's the health care system itself

815
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,085
that's truly sick.

816
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:15,094
They pay their doctors less.

817
00:45:15,272 --> 00:45:18,565
A surgeon can only do certain
number of operation each year,

818
00:45:18,685 --> 00:45:21,442
with only so many expensive
new pieces of equipment.

819
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:25,581
It's easier for your cat or dog
to receive a MRI here in America.

820
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,026
You die of cancer
waiting for that chemo 'cause

821
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:30,083
like all of Ottawa
has like one chemo machine.

822
00:45:30,205 --> 00:45:33,159
And if you think socialized medicine
is a good idea...

823
00:45:33,385 --> 00:45:34,568
ask a Canadian.

824
00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:39,866
So I thought who better to ask,
than my Canadian relatives:

825
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:41,697
Bob and Estelle.

826
00:45:42,494 --> 00:45:45,029
But they wouldn't cross the border
into America.

827
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,201
They wanted me to meet them
at Sears, in Canada.

828
00:45:50,075 --> 00:45:52,140
Now, what do you guys doing here?

829
00:45:52,928 --> 00:45:55,014
We buy an insurance:
we're going over to the States.

830
00:45:55,182 --> 00:45:56,881
We're going to the States to see you.

831
00:45:57,309 --> 00:45:59,402
Right, you know,
that's just across the river.

832
00:46:00,804 --> 00:46:03,049
You wouldn't even go over
see us over in Michigan

833
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:05,048
for a couple of hours
without this insurance?

834
00:46:05,315 --> 00:46:06,506
No, we wouldn't.

835
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:08,452
We're just adamant about it,

836
00:46:08,572 --> 00:46:09,634
we would not do it.

837
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,559
If somebody punches us in the mouth,

838
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:13,891
if something,
and something like that...

839
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:17,013
You don't want to get caught
in the American health system thing.

840
00:46:17,703 --> 00:46:19,788
We have nothing against Americans,

841
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:22,763
or America,
or anything like that at all.

842
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:24,836
We're nice and simple people.

843
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:26,559
Yes, well, not very simple, but...

844
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:28,475
certainly very nice.

845
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:34,312
I decided to explore
their anti-American views further,

846
00:46:34,566 --> 00:46:36,556
over some fine Canadian cuisine.

847
00:46:37,101 --> 00:46:39,853
We have a friend who went to Hawaii.

848
00:46:40,751 --> 00:46:44,342
And he sustained
head injury while he was there.

849
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:47,464
And before he was
well enough to come home,

850
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:51,483
he had chocked up
a bill of over $600,000.

851
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,537
So what middle-class Canadian

852
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,383
could absorb that?

853
00:46:57,672 --> 00:47:01,171
I guess I feel bad that you would
have to worry about something like that.

854
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:04,447
We're not criticizing your country,
we're just...

855
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:07,635
giving you the facts
that we could not afford

856
00:47:08,181 --> 00:47:09,660
to be without insurance.

857
00:47:10,817 --> 00:47:13,208
- Even for a day?
- Even for a day.

858
00:47:15,657 --> 00:47:19,608
To prove their point even further,
they set me over to a local golf course

859
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:21,256
to talk to Larry Godfrey

860
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:24,861
who had a golfing accident
while on vacation, in Florida.

861
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:27,594
I could hear a noise and...

862
00:47:27,714 --> 00:47:29,620
feel a pain
and the tendon snapped off.

863
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,022
This bone here
that holds the biceps in place...

864
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:37,062
So this biceps muscle was released
like elastic and then...

865
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:39,220
it ended up here on my chest.

866
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,688
The muscle came up your arm
and ended up up in your chest?

867
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:42,902
Ended up right here.

868
00:47:43,437 --> 00:47:46,739
Like all good golfers,
Larry finished his round,

869
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,871
before seeking medical attention.

870
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:52,265
That's when he got the bad news.

871
00:47:52,687 --> 00:47:53,827
I wasn't too worried because

872
00:47:53,947 --> 00:47:55,671
I had out of country insurance but...

873
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:59,267
when he told me
it was 23 or 24,000 then I....

874
00:47:59,387 --> 00:48:00,441
24,000?

875
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,311
Dollars, yes.

876
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:05,445
So if you'd stay in United States,
this would've cost you $24,000?

877
00:48:05,565 --> 00:48:06,743
$24,000, yes.

878
00:48:06,863 --> 00:48:08,738
Instead, you went back to Canada,

879
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:11,865
- and Canada paid your total expenses...
- Everything.

880
00:48:11,985 --> 00:48:13,112
Paid for the operation...

881
00:48:13,253 --> 00:48:14,751
- ...and that cost you...
- Nothing.

882
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,218
- ...zero.
- Zero.

883
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,372
I'm wondering, why do you expect
your fellow Canadians,

884
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:21,887
who don't have your problem,

885
00:48:22,343 --> 00:48:24,230
why should they,
through their tax dollars,

886
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,564
have to pay for a problem you have.

887
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,601
Because we would do the same for them.

888
00:48:31,182 --> 00:48:34,865
It's just the way
it's always been and
it's the way we hope it'll always be.

889
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:37,938
Right, but if you'd just had to pay
for your problem,

890
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:41,801
and don't pay for everybody else's
problem, just take care of yourself.

891
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,586
Well, there are a lot of people
who aren't in the position to...

892
00:48:44,723 --> 00:48:45,762
be able to do that.

893
00:48:45,905 --> 00:48:47,783
And somebody has to look after them.

894
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:50,581
Are you a member of
the socialist party here or....

895
00:48:51,914 --> 00:48:52,970
Green party?

896
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:56,875
No, I-- Well, actually I'm a member
of the conservative party.

897
00:48:58,650 --> 00:48:59,701
Is that bad?

898
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:03,227
Well, it's just a little confusing...

899
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:04,394
Well...

900
00:49:05,312 --> 00:49:07,059
it shouldn't be, I think that...

901
00:49:07,608 --> 00:49:09,861
I think that where medical
matters are concerned,

902
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:12,316
it wouldn't matter in Canada
what party you...

903
00:49:12,509 --> 00:49:14,180
you're affiliated with.

904
00:49:14,527 --> 00:49:15,527
If any...

905
00:49:15,649 --> 00:49:18,287
But, to us,
as we look across the river here,

906
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,755
you know, why don't you think
we don't believe that?

907
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:24,374
- What's wrong on this issue with us?
- Well, I guess...

908
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,601
the powers that be don't...

909
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:29,349
share our beliefs that...

910
00:49:29,993 --> 00:49:32,209
that health care ought to be universal.

911
00:49:32,464 --> 00:49:34,454
I mean, Canadians didn't until...

912
00:49:34,744 --> 00:49:36,681
we met up with a guy
named Tommy Douglas,

913
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:38,931
who pretty much...

914
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:40,791
changed everyone's mind.

915
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:43,801
- One guy?
- One guy, yeah.

916
00:49:44,037 --> 00:49:47,132
- One guy did it, he...
- Can he come over and visit us?

917
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:49,764
He's dead unfortunately,
in fact he was...

918
00:49:50,224 --> 00:49:53,780
He is just more seriously been revered
as Canada's...

919
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,808
singular most important person.

920
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,632
We think so much of...

921
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,855
- You mean in your whole history?
- In our whole history.

922
00:50:01,021 --> 00:50:03,613
- More than your first Prime minister...
- Absolutely, yeah...

923
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:05,393
Even more than Wayne Gretzky.

924
00:50:06,478 --> 00:50:08,084
- No way.
- Absolutely.

925
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:11,213
More than Celine Dion?

926
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:13,267
A great singer, more than Celine Dion.

927
00:50:13,507 --> 00:50:16,162
- More than Rocky and Bullwinkle.
- Maybe...

928
00:50:22,005 --> 00:50:24,831
... as the blade went through,
it cut the glove that I was wearing

929
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:27,511
and it sliced through the entire

930
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:30,709
group of fingers
and completely taking them off.

931
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:07,958
- No money is being exchanged here?
- No, nothing.

932
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:10,146
- There's no money being exchanged.
- I'm over 60.

933
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,966
- We don't pay.
- What's the purpose
of the cash register?

934
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:17,145
I'm just wondering

935
00:55:17,265 --> 00:55:20,714
where's the bread and the milk
and the candy in here?

936
00:55:21,512 --> 00:55:24,611
I can't pick up any laundry
detergent here or....

937
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:29,321
I haven't been trained for that many
years to be selling detergents so... no.

938
00:55:41,894 --> 00:55:44,058
I next went to a state run hospital,

939
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:47,021
operated by the national health service.

940
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:52,927
I'm doing seven weeks
and I get 6 months off, paid.

941
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:55,443
And then I can have 6 months
of unpaid as well.

942
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:56,983
So I'm actually taking a year.

943
00:55:57,473 --> 00:56:00,013
Well, that sounds
like a luxury where I'm from.

944
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:01,926
Oh, really, it's not like that

945
00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:05,180
in U.S., no... not at all, no.

946
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,623
So what do you pay for stay here?

947
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:09,979
No one pays.

948
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,551
They were asking how the people pay.

949
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:17,212
And I said but there isn't---
You don't, you just leave.

950
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,724
- It's national insurance. There's no...
- Yeah.

951
00:56:19,902 --> 00:56:21,676
... bill at the end of the day
as it were.

952
00:56:24,222 --> 00:56:27,799
Even with insurance,
there's bound to be a bill somewhere.

953
00:56:28,568 --> 00:56:31,515
- So where's the billing department?
- There isn't really a billing dept.

954
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:33,542
Right, there's no such thing
as a billing...

955
00:56:34,384 --> 00:56:36,289
What did they charge you for that baby?

956
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:37,642
Sorry?

957
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,689
You gotta pay
before you get outta here, right?

958
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:42,783
- Everything is on...
- This is NHS.

959
00:56:44,117 --> 00:56:45,920
You know, it's not America.

960
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:50,908
Maybe I'd have better luck
in the part of the hospital

961
00:56:51,123 --> 00:56:53,336
where things can get
seriously expensive.

962
00:56:54,586 --> 00:56:56,501
This guy broke his ankle...

963
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:57,797
How much will this cost him?

964
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:58,920
Sorry?

965
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,370
The emergency room visit...

966
00:57:00,603 --> 00:57:02,090
He'll have some huge bill

967
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,546
when he's done, right?

968
00:57:03,828 --> 00:57:04,832
Yeah...

969
00:57:04,983 --> 00:57:06,217
NHS: everything is free.

970
00:57:06,748 --> 00:57:09,754
I'm asking about hospital charges
and you're laughing at me.

971
00:57:09,874 --> 00:57:11,611
'Cause no one ever asks
this question in...

972
00:57:11,756 --> 00:57:13,288
emergency department, that's why.

973
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,434
I was starting to fall
for this everything is free bit.

974
00:57:18,956 --> 00:57:20,749
And then I discovered this.

975
00:57:22,299 --> 00:57:24,213
So this is where people
come to pay their bill

976
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,085
when they're done
staying in the hospital?

977
00:57:26,272 --> 00:57:29,018
No this is the NHS hospital,
so you don't pay the bill.

978
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:31,747
You get to just go home?

979
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:35,570
What does it say "Cashier" here
if people don't have to pay a bill?

980
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:39,248
All we have is an old man here,
who stands behind

981
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:43,455
a counter and he gives people money
if they've had to pay for transport.

982
00:57:43,697 --> 00:57:47,945
Those who have reduced means
get their travel expanses reimbursed.

983
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:49,068
Thank you.

984
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,030
So in British hospitals

985
00:57:51,311 --> 00:57:53,950
instead of money going
into the cashier's window

986
00:57:54,523 --> 00:57:55,828
money comes out.

987
00:57:56,191 --> 00:57:58,107
The criteria for letting up the hospital

988
00:57:58,253 --> 00:58:00,234
are not if you've paid your bill,
the criteria...

989
00:58:00,398 --> 00:58:02,917
are you fit to go,
and are you going somewhere safe.

990
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,520
Clearly, I was just
the butt of a joke here.

991
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:13,961
What I needed
was a good old fashion American

992
00:58:14,168 --> 00:58:16,064
who would have some understanding.

993
00:58:16,824 --> 00:58:18,458
When I first came to London

994
00:58:18,673 --> 00:58:20,322
in 1992.

995
00:58:20,442 --> 00:58:23,224
And we just ended up staying
and we had...

996
00:58:23,364 --> 00:58:24,604
three children here.

997
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,220
Well, I had them all on the...

998
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,168
NHS which is
the national health service.

999
00:58:28,288 --> 00:58:29,923
The British national health service.

1000
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,735
I think like a lot of American assumed

1001
00:58:32,855 --> 00:58:35,652
that a socialized medicine
was just bottom of the rung...

1002
00:58:36,114 --> 00:58:38,294
treatment, that you know
that's the only possible way

1003
00:58:38,422 --> 00:58:40,906
it would be dingy and horrible
and it would be like the USSR.

1004
00:58:41,043 --> 00:58:42,187
I mean, that's kind of how...

1005
00:58:42,307 --> 00:58:45,304
And... that's terrible,
that's what I thought.

1006
00:58:45,682 --> 00:58:47,043
That's what I thought, too.

1007
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:50,825
After having a baby,
it's right back to the wheat fields!

1008
00:59:15,847 --> 00:59:18,871
And then it occurred to me
that back home in America

1009
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,098
we've socialized a lot of things.

1010
00:59:46,615 --> 00:59:49,085
I kinda like having
a police department and...

1011
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,752
a fire department and...

1012
00:59:50,872 --> 00:59:52,286
and the library and...

1013
00:59:52,578 --> 00:59:53,761
And I got to wondering:

1014
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,085
Why don't we have more these free

1015
00:59:56,246 --> 00:59:57,873
socialized things,

1016
00:59:58,518 --> 00:59:59,532
like health care.

1017
01:00:00,135 --> 01:00:03,016
When did this whole idea
that every British citizen

1018
01:00:03,138 --> 01:00:04,936
should have a right to health care?

1019
01:00:05,062 --> 01:00:07,962
Well, if you go back,
it all began with democracy,

1020
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,958
before we had the vote.

1021
01:00:10,779 --> 01:00:13,067
All the power was in the hands
of rich people.

1022
01:00:13,327 --> 01:00:15,973
If you had money,
you could get health care, education,

1023
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,632
look after yourself when you're old,
and what democracy did,

1024
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:22,592
was to give the poor the vote.

1025
01:00:23,062 --> 01:00:25,555
And it moved power from the market-place

1026
01:00:25,853 --> 01:00:27,885
to the police station.
From the...

1027
01:00:28,314 --> 01:00:29,595
wallet to the ballot.

1028
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,815
And what people said was very simple.

1029
01:00:31,998 --> 01:00:35,921
They said, "In the 1930's,
we had mass unemployment.

1030
01:00:36,355 --> 01:00:38,662
"But we don't have any unemployment
during the war.

1031
01:00:38,861 --> 01:00:41,168
"If we could have full employment
by killing Germans,

1032
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:42,994
"why can't we have it
building hospitals,

1033
01:00:43,117 --> 01:00:45,781
"building schools, recruiting nurses,
recruiting teachers?"

1034
01:00:45,996 --> 01:00:51,163
If you can find money to kill people,
you can find money to help people.

1035
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,422
Right.

1036
01:00:52,685 --> 01:00:54,694
This certainly flipped
the pos[ition on the] issue

1037
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:55,951
very straight forward.

1038
01:00:56,136 --> 01:00:58,312
- What year was this?
- This was 1948.

1039
01:00:58,903 --> 01:01:01,936
"Your new national health service
begins on the fifth of July.

1040
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,735
"What is it? How'd you get it?

1041
01:01:04,181 --> 01:01:09,023
"It will provide you with all medical,
dental and nursing care.

1042
01:01:09,154 --> 01:01:14,071
"Everyone, rich or poor, men, women
or child could use it or any part of it.

1043
01:01:14,276 --> 01:01:17,422
"There are no charges
except for a few special item.

1044
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:21,397
"There's no insurance qualification,
but it's not a charity.

1045
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:24,298
"You're paying for it
mainly as tax payers

1046
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:28,159
"and it will relieve your money
worries in times of illness."

1047
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:32,512
Now... Somehow, that--
the few words sum the whole thing up.

1048
01:01:38,412 --> 01:01:39,416
I was amazed

1049
01:01:39,538 --> 01:01:42,892
when he said this all started in 1948.

1050
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:47,733
The British have just come out
of a devastating experience through WW2.

1051
01:01:48,731 --> 01:01:50,021
The country was destroyed,

1052
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:51,840
and nearly bankrupt.

1053
01:01:52,527 --> 01:01:54,486
They had nothing.

1054
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:57,277
In just one eight month period

1055
01:01:57,606 --> 01:02:01,082
over 42,000 civilians lost their lives.

1056
01:02:02,207 --> 01:02:04,929
But we went through
in two hours on 9/11,

1057
01:02:05,523 --> 01:02:08,264
they went through nearly
every single day.

1058
01:02:10,558 --> 01:02:13,054
Remember how we all felt after 9/11?

1059
01:02:13,836 --> 01:02:15,842
All of us, pulling together?

1060
01:02:16,408 --> 01:02:18,197
I guess that's how they felt.

1061
01:02:19,832 --> 01:02:23,194
And the first way that they decided
to pull together after the war,

1062
01:02:23,665 --> 01:02:25,865
was to provide free medical care

1063
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,433
for everyone.

1064
01:02:28,366 --> 01:02:30,127
Even Mrs. Thatcher said,

1065
01:02:30,423 --> 01:02:33,579
"the nation health service
is safe in our hands."

1066
01:02:33,927 --> 01:02:36,442
It's... as non-controversial
as vote for women.

1067
01:02:36,564 --> 01:02:39,594
Nobody could come along and say
why women should[n't] have the vote now

1068
01:02:39,972 --> 01:02:42,064
because people wouldn't have it,
and not in Britain.

1069
01:02:42,214 --> 01:02:43,466
They wouldn't accept

1070
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:46,592
the deterioration or destruction
of the national health care.

1071
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:50,089
If Thatcher or Blair had said "I'm going
to dismantle National Healthcare..."

1072
01:02:50,209 --> 01:02:51,880
That would be the revolution, yeah.

1073
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:02,198
A report

1074
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:06,798
from the American Medical Association
into the health of 55 to 64 year olds

1075
01:03:06,986 --> 01:03:09,792
says Brits are far healthier
than Americans.

1076
01:03:10,132 --> 01:03:12,223
For every illness that we look at,

1077
01:03:12,449 --> 01:03:14,775
Americans have more of it than English.

1078
01:03:14,954 --> 01:03:18,486
Cancer, heart disease, hypertension,
strokes, lung disease,

1079
01:03:18,647 --> 01:03:21,091
all significantly higher for Americans.

1080
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,590
Even the poorest people in England
with all the environmental factors

1081
01:03:24,892 --> 01:03:28,151
that give them the worst health
in the country can expect

1082
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:31,264
to live longer
than the wealthiest people in America.

1083
01:03:39,934 --> 01:03:43,663
I was wondering though, what's it like
for the doctors here in Britain?

1084
01:03:44,109 --> 01:03:46,982
We have to live
under this kind of state control.

1085
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:49,097
And you're a family doctor?

1086
01:03:49,441 --> 01:03:52,370
Yeah, I'd supposed you'd call them
"GPs" or General Practitioners here.

1087
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,649
Right, so you have
like a family practice?

1088
01:03:54,809 --> 01:03:57,943
Yeah, it's a NHS practice. We have
nine doctors within that practice.

1089
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:00,262
- You're paid for by the government?
- Paid for by it.

1090
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:01,779
So you work for the government?

1091
01:04:01,902 --> 01:04:03,478
- Government paid doctor?
- Absolutely.

1092
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,745
A patient comes to see you.
Before you treat them,

1093
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:08,111
do you have to call
the government insurance company

1094
01:04:08,258 --> 01:04:09,518
before you can treat them?

1095
01:04:09,682 --> 01:04:13,280
No, I don't deal with money
at all on an every day basis.

1096
01:04:13,497 --> 01:04:16,612
Have you ever had to say no to someone
who was sick and needed help?

1097
01:04:16,794 --> 01:04:19,694
- No, never.
- Have you heard of anyone,

1098
01:04:19,986 --> 01:04:23,923
being in a hospital and being removed
because he couldn't pay the bill?

1099
01:04:24,074 --> 01:04:26,523
No, never. And I wouldn't want
to work in that system.

1100
01:04:26,672 --> 01:04:27,896
So working for the government,

1101
01:04:28,024 --> 01:04:30,024
you probably have to use
public transportation.

1102
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:33,581
No. So, I have a car
that I use and I drive to work.

1103
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,709
An old beater?

1104
01:04:41,868 --> 01:04:44,062
You live in a kind rough part of town,
or...

1105
01:04:44,232 --> 01:04:47,849
I mean, I live in a terrific part
of town, it's called Greenwich.

1106
01:04:51,856 --> 01:04:53,410
It's a lovely house.

1107
01:04:53,586 --> 01:04:54,592
It's a 3 story house.

1108
01:04:54,712 --> 01:04:57,246
How many other families
have to live in that house with you?

1109
01:04:57,432 --> 01:04:58,713
That's four bedrooms for

1110
01:04:58,986 --> 01:05:01,906
my wife and my son.
It's just the three of us there.

1111
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:03,579
How much you pay for that?

1112
01:05:05,128 --> 01:05:08,952
- £550,000. Yes, almost.
- So, a million dollars.

1113
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:10,945
Your government pays a doctor

1114
01:05:11,237 --> 01:05:14,047
on a national health insurance
health care plan here,

1115
01:05:14,509 --> 01:05:16,468
- Yes.
- and you live in a $1,000,000 home.

1116
01:05:16,911 --> 01:05:17,928
Yes.

1117
01:05:21,936 --> 01:05:24,110
I think probably my friends think
we do quite well.

1118
01:05:24,284 --> 01:05:25,659
Really? How well do you do?

1119
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:28,965
I earn around 85,000
including pension...

1120
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:31,659
- £85,000?
- 85,000 pounds a year.

1121
01:05:31,809 --> 01:05:33,961
And that includes pension
that they will pay to me.

1122
01:05:34,089 --> 01:05:37,518
They probably earn just
over 100,000 pounds within my practice.

1123
01:05:37,669 --> 01:05:41,408
- £100,000?  So, that's almost $200,000?
- Yes, absolutely.

1124
01:05:42,153 --> 01:05:44,542
The money that we earn,
we paid by what we do.

1125
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:48,161
So the better we do for our patients,
then the more we get paid.

1126
01:05:48,566 --> 01:05:49,574
What do you mean?

1127
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:51,317
There's a new system,

1128
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:53,661
and, in that new system,

1129
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,328
if the most number of your patients
have low blood pressures,

1130
01:05:56,507 --> 01:05:58,749
or you got most of your patients
to stop smoking,

1131
01:05:58,984 --> 01:06:00,270
or you got most of your patients

1132
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,857
to have things like mental health
reviews, if they're unwell

1133
01:06:02,978 --> 01:06:04,914
or low cholesterol,
then you get paid more.

1134
01:06:05,323 --> 01:06:08,987
This year, if you get people of
your patients to stop smoking,

1135
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,970
- this year, you'll earn more?
- Absolutely.

1136
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:13,047
- You'll earn more?
- Yeah, absolutely.

1137
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:16,542
So doctors in America
do not have to fear...

1138
01:06:18,256 --> 01:06:19,886
having universal health care.

1139
01:06:20,036 --> 01:06:22,259
No. I think if you want to have

1140
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:26,233
2 or 3 millions dollars homes
and 4 or 5 nice cars

1141
01:06:26,412 --> 01:06:28,221
and 6 or 7 nice televisions,

1142
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:32,063
then maybe yeah, you need to practice
somewhere you can earn that.

1143
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:35,596
But I think we live comfortably here,
and London is an expensive city,

1144
01:06:35,756 --> 01:06:37,263
but I think we live very comfortably.

1145
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:40,151
And you're getting by okay
on the million dollars home, the Audi,

1146
01:06:40,316 --> 01:06:41,737
and the flat screen TV?

1147
01:06:41,906 --> 01:06:43,767
Yeah, we're coping with those.

1148
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:48,577
I think democracy is the most
revolutionary thing in the world.

1149
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:52,193
Far more revolutionary than socialist
ideas, or anybody else's idea.

1150
01:06:52,354 --> 01:06:54,171
But if you have power,

1151
01:06:54,435 --> 01:06:57,798
you use it
to meet the needs of your community.

1152
01:06:58,031 --> 01:07:00,199
And this idea of choice
that Capitol[ism]

1153
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:02,487
talks about all the time,
"you gotta have a choice",

1154
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,748
Choice depends
on the freedom to choose.

1155
01:07:04,951 --> 01:07:07,737
And if you're shackled in debt,
you don't have a freedom to choose.

1156
01:07:07,932 --> 01:07:09,693
It seems that it benefits the system,

1157
01:07:09,966 --> 01:07:12,387
If the average working person
is shackled and is in debt?

1158
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,838
Yes, because people in debt

1159
01:07:13,969 --> 01:07:16,381
become hopeless,
and hopeless people don't vote.

1160
01:07:16,842 --> 01:07:18,792
See, they always say
that everyone should vote

1161
01:07:18,923 --> 01:07:20,854
But I think, if the poor

1162
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:23,612
in Britain or the United States
turned out

1163
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:26,796
and voted for people representing
their interests, it would be

1164
01:07:27,031 --> 01:07:29,980
a real democratic revolution.
So they don't want it to happen.

1165
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,476
So keeping people
hopeless and pessimistic...

1166
01:07:32,786 --> 01:07:36,074
See, I think there are 2 ways
in which people get controlled:

1167
01:07:36,705 --> 01:07:39,945
first of all, frightening people,
and second, you demoralize them.

1168
01:07:40,962 --> 01:07:44,518
An educated, healthy and confident
nation is harder to govern.

1169
01:07:45,121 --> 01:07:46,694
And I think there's an element

1170
01:07:46,892 --> 01:07:49,162
in the thinking of some people.
We don't want

1171
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,176
people to be educated,
healthy and confident

1172
01:07:52,346 --> 01:07:54,125
because they would get out of control.

1173
01:07:54,964 --> 01:07:58,892
The top 1 % of the world's population
own 80 percent of the world's wealth.

1174
01:07:59,043 --> 01:08:00,898
It's incredible,
the people put up with it,

1175
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:05,184
but they're poor, they're demoralized,
they're frightened.

1176
01:08:05,693 --> 01:08:07,021
And therefore, they think,

1177
01:08:07,144 --> 01:08:10,572
"Perhaps the safest thing to do is
to take orders and hope for the best."

1178
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:19,794
And hope for the best is what we do,
right from the moment we're born.

1179
01:08:20,745 --> 01:08:23,750
We've got the worst infant
mortality rate in the western world.

1180
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:27,461
A baby born in El Salvador
has a better chance of surviving

1181
01:08:27,772 --> 01:08:29,496
than a baby born in Detroit.

1182
01:08:30,316 --> 01:08:32,237
But it gets better
when you go to school.

1183
01:08:32,454 --> 01:08:35,355
Classrooms with 40 students.
Schools with no science labs.

1184
01:08:35,996 --> 01:08:39,001
No wonder the majority of our young
adults can't find Britain on a map.

1185
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,847
But that's okay, there's always college.

1186
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:43,946
By the time we graduate,
our asses are so in hot,

1187
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:46,669
we're deep in debt
before we're even having our first job.

1188
01:08:46,847 --> 01:08:50,501
I'm at about...
let's say about 35,000 dollars in debt.

1189
01:08:50,737 --> 01:08:52,183
That's for my three years college.

1190
01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:54,744
That way you'll be the kind of employee
they look for.

1191
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:56,144
One who needs this job.

1192
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:58,668
3,904, 3,905...

1193
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:02,360
What employer wouldn't wanna employ
someone thousands of thousands in debt?

1194
01:09:02,623 --> 01:09:04,385
Because they won't cause any trouble.

1195
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:07,747
In addition to have to pay
their college debt,

1196
01:09:07,907 --> 01:09:10,093
you need a job with health insurance.

1197
01:09:10,403 --> 01:09:12,805
It would be horrible
to loose that kind of job, wouldn't it?

1198
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:14,614
You can always quit, you know?

1199
01:09:15,066 --> 01:09:17,336
There's no law
that says you have to work here.

1200
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:20,482
And if that one job doesn't pay
all the bills, don't worry!

1201
01:09:20,887 --> 01:09:22,102
You can get another one,

1202
01:09:22,234 --> 01:09:23,289
and another one,

1203
01:09:23,684 --> 01:09:24,692
and another one.

1204
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:28,073
I work three jobs,
and I feel like I contribute.

1205
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:30,947
- You work three jobs?
- Three jobs, yes.

1206
01:09:31,173 --> 01:09:32,426
Uniquely American, isn't it?

1207
01:09:32,642 --> 01:09:34,978
I mean that's fantastic
that you're doing that.

1208
01:09:36,618 --> 01:09:37,683
Get any sleep?

1209
01:09:38,145 --> 01:09:40,688
And if you're not getting
enough sleep... take pharmaceuticals.

1210
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:43,278
You're tired all the time.
You may feel sad, hopeless.

1211
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,642
If you suffer from excessive worry...

1212
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,903
You could be suffering
from anxiety disorder...

1213
01:09:48,035 --> 01:09:49,429
It could be adult ADD.

1214
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,719
- Talk to your doctor.
- Ask your doctor.

1215
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:53,188
Ask your doctor.

1216
01:09:53,536 --> 01:09:56,466
Yes, ask your doctor,
and ask him for more drugs.

1217
01:09:56,917 --> 01:09:59,856
That should keep you pretty doped up
until it's time to retire.

1218
01:10:00,059 --> 01:10:01,129
Did I say retire?

1219
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,911
Well if you do make it to 80,
I'm sure pension will still be there.

1220
01:10:06,117 --> 01:10:09,579
Unlike the new employees
who'll never see a pension.

1221
01:10:09,749 --> 01:10:12,114
But don't worry,
I'm sure our kid’s will take care of us,

1222
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,289
considering the great life
we've given them.

1223
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:17,084
And remember,
let's defeat the terrorists over there,

1224
01:10:17,204 --> 01:10:18,689
so we don't have to fight them here.

1225
01:10:20,497 --> 01:10:23,994
KAISER PERMANENTE
is the largest H.M.O. in the country.

1226
01:10:24,431 --> 01:10:26,661
And Dawnell Keys was fortunate enough

1227
01:10:26,857 --> 01:10:28,538
to live fully insured by them.

1228
01:10:29,147 --> 01:10:31,205
It's a good thing, because one night,

1229
01:10:31,363 --> 01:10:36,306
her 18 months old daughter Mychelle,
developed a fever of over a 104°F.

1230
01:10:37,221 --> 01:10:40,039
So like any responsible mom,
she called 911,

1231
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,694
and the ambulance took Mychelle
to the closest hospital.

1232
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,429
The hospital checked with her H.M.O.
and they were told

1233
01:10:47,549 --> 01:10:51,273
that KAISER would not cover the tests
and the antibiotics necessary

1234
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,522
to treat Mychelle.

1235
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:58,441
She would have to take her
to an in-network KAISER home hospital.

1236
01:10:58,818 --> 01:11:01,889
KAISER said that I should bring her
by car

1237
01:11:02,237 --> 01:11:06,927
to the hospital and that she shouldn’t
be treated at Martin Luther King.

1238
01:11:07,882 --> 01:11:12,196
I just continued to ask them
to treat her, and they refused.

1239
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:15,558
My daughter got worse...

1240
01:11:16,509 --> 01:11:18,045
and she had a seizure.

1241
01:11:19,048 --> 01:11:23,691
Dawnell bet the doctors to not listen
to KAISER and to treat her daughter.

1242
01:11:25,152 --> 01:11:29,890
I was escorted out of the hospital
because they felt that I was a threat.

1243
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:35,754
After hours of delay,
she was transported to KAISER,

1244
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:39,776
and got there just in time
to go into cardiac arrest.

1245
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:45,023
They worked on her for about 30 minutes
trying to revive her.

1246
01:11:45,578 --> 01:11:47,424
And the doctors came in,

1247
01:11:47,829 --> 01:11:49,591
and let use know that...

1248
01:11:50,147 --> 01:11:51,852
She had expired.

1249
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:56,288
I was in a daze.

1250
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,442
A real daze, it just...
didn't seem real.

1251
01:12:01,553 --> 01:12:02,862
I just held her.

1252
01:12:03,248 --> 01:12:07,563
I held her and I told her
that mommy tried her best to help her,

1253
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:13,139
to make sure that she was gonna get
the treatment she needed to receive.

1254
01:12:13,485 --> 01:12:14,813
And that I was sorry,

1255
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,810
that I was unable to help her.

1256
01:12:32,496 --> 01:12:34,935
This is Corrina, and her daughter Zoe.

1257
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:38,599
Corrina is a graduate
of Michigan State University,

1258
01:12:38,882 --> 01:12:41,736
and a native of my home town,
of Flint, Michigan.

1259
01:12:42,414 --> 01:12:45,861
Six months ago, Zoe,
like Dawnell's baby Mychelle,

1260
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,196
came down with a high fever.

1261
01:12:48,498 --> 01:12:50,881
What happened is she stops breathing

1262
01:12:51,022 --> 01:12:53,499
for a little while,
turned blue and passed out my arms,

1263
01:12:53,678 --> 01:12:55,025
which was...

1264
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:59,292
It was... the most horrible moment
in my life, I think,

1265
01:12:59,471 --> 01:13:02,551
just because I thought
that she was either dead or dying.

1266
01:13:03,032 --> 01:13:04,795
And I had no clue what to do.

1267
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,900
At the hospital,
they gave her some medicine,

1268
01:13:09,023 --> 01:13:12,451
bring the fever down,
and examined her, took some blood...

1269
01:13:12,574 --> 01:13:14,467
And what they determine
was wrong with her?

1270
01:13:14,655 --> 01:13:19,496
It was a throat infection. But we stayed
at the hospital from Friday to Sunday.

1271
01:13:19,694 --> 01:13:21,256
Just so they can keep an eye on her.

1272
01:13:21,493 --> 01:13:23,452
- And you stayed there that long?
- Yeah.

1273
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:25,873
They just basically kept an eye on her.

1274
01:13:26,165 --> 01:13:27,983
And how much
did all this cost you though?

1275
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,611
- 3+ days in a hospital...
- Nothing.

1276
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:32,155
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1277
01:13:33,229 --> 01:13:35,508
- Nothing at all.
- And that's because...

1278
01:13:36,582 --> 01:13:38,880
- I live in France.
- You live in France?

1279
01:13:39,003 --> 01:13:40,011
Yeah.

1280
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:44,796
Ah, France...

1281
01:13:45,117 --> 01:13:47,424
They enjoy their wine, their cigarettes,

1282
01:13:47,961 --> 01:13:49,497
and their fatty foods.

1283
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:52,511
And yet, just like the Canadians
and the Brits,

1284
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:54,971
they live much longer than we do.

1285
01:13:55,442 --> 01:13:59,058
Something about that
seemed grossly unfair.

1286
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,562
This is Alexy Cromone.

1287
01:14:02,826 --> 01:14:07,460
He spent his entire adult life in the US
without health insurance.

1288
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,056
I lived in America for 13 years.

1289
01:14:12,395 --> 01:14:13,827
I loved my life there.

1290
01:14:14,176 --> 01:14:16,464
But then when I discovered
that I had a tumor,

1291
01:14:16,672 --> 01:14:18,254
and I didn't have health insurance,

1292
01:14:18,527 --> 01:14:20,562
unfortunately I had to come back here.

1293
01:14:21,352 --> 01:14:24,493
And even though I never paid any taxes
in France, 'cause I never worked here.

1294
01:14:24,616 --> 01:14:27,262
I left when I was 18, I didn't even have
a social security number.

1295
01:14:27,409 --> 01:14:28,651
For them I was saying, well...

1296
01:14:28,789 --> 01:14:30,748
he needs treatment,
he has no income, so...

1297
01:14:31,783 --> 01:14:34,082
we're gonna give him,
you know, the treatment he needs.

1298
01:14:35,136 --> 01:14:36,248
How're you doing now?

1299
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:37,642
I'm healthy now,

1300
01:14:38,026 --> 01:14:40,015
but I had 3 months
of intensive chemo therapy.

1301
01:14:40,353 --> 01:14:43,904
So after the 3 months, I saw my doctor
and he said "You wanna go back to work?"

1302
01:14:44,243 --> 01:14:46,033
I said, "No, I don't feel like it.

1303
01:14:46,768 --> 01:14:49,678
"Just right now, I'm not ready."
He said, "How much do you need?"

1304
01:14:49,801 --> 01:14:52,909
I said, "Well, I don't know..."
He said, "Would 3 months be okay?"

1305
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:55,461
I said, "I think 3 months will be fine."

1306
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:59,259
He said, "Okay, so take 3 months off",
so he wrote me a, you know, a note,

1307
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:03,398
that I gave to my employer
so as to make sure that I get paid.

1308
01:15:03,946 --> 01:15:06,674
- So I went to the south of France...
- Wait a minute... you get...

1309
01:15:06,804 --> 01:15:08,702
three months off with pay?

1310
01:15:08,824 --> 01:15:10,626
Yes. Yes.

1311
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:12,498
I get 65%...

1312
01:15:13,534 --> 01:15:15,743
paid by the government,

1313
01:15:15,961 --> 01:15:19,145
and then the other 35% is paid
by my employer.

1314
01:15:19,769 --> 01:15:22,061
To make sure you got a 100%.

1315
01:15:23,548 --> 01:15:25,472
So, it was April. I was free again.

1316
01:15:25,594 --> 01:15:28,323
So I started right away.
Sucking up some sun.

1317
01:15:28,508 --> 01:15:31,971
And that really, you know,
helped me a lot to get allowed of

1318
01:15:32,339 --> 01:15:34,070
recharge my batteries and...

1319
01:15:34,385 --> 01:15:36,065
I mean, it was like...
night and day.

1320
01:15:36,275 --> 01:15:39,896
In 3 months, I went from
a 95 year old man to

1321
01:15:40,263 --> 01:15:42,362
35 year old man, you know, again.

1322
01:15:42,509 --> 01:15:45,976
And that's because I had that time
to take care of myself.

1323
01:15:51,904 --> 01:15:55,253
I'm not really in a position to make
any judgment

1324
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:57,939
concerning the American system.

1325
01:15:58,231 --> 01:16:01,555
I think the United States are
a great, great country

1326
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:04,011
Americans are great people.
I really love them.

1327
01:16:04,431 --> 01:16:07,632
But as a doctor... first,

1328
01:16:08,052 --> 01:16:09,662
as a citizen, second,

1329
01:16:09,784 --> 01:16:12,041
and eventually as a patient, third,

1330
01:16:12,303 --> 01:16:14,665
I'm very glad to be in France.

1331
01:16:15,452 --> 01:16:17,341
It's kind of a luxury here.

1332
01:16:17,498 --> 01:16:20,385
You are sick.
You step into a hospital

1333
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,592
You got the care you need.

1334
01:16:21,906 --> 01:16:25,003
It doesn't depend on your premiums.
It depends on what you need.

1335
01:16:25,866 --> 01:16:28,018
One main principle is solidarity.

1336
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,793
People who are better off
pay for those who are worse off.

1337
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:35,324
You pay according to your means

1338
01:16:35,446 --> 01:16:37,317
and you receive according to your needs.

1339
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:39,354
Do you think that would ever work
in America?

1340
01:16:40,911 --> 01:16:42,066
No.

1341
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:46,553
He could barely contain
his seething anti Americanism.

1342
01:16:47,078 --> 01:16:49,387
And I just didn't want
to listen to anymore of it.

1343
01:16:55,415 --> 01:16:57,366
So I found a group of Americans

1344
01:16:57,523 --> 01:16:59,010
currently living in Paris

1345
01:16:59,368 --> 01:17:01,327
who I know would tell me the truth.

1346
01:17:02,533 --> 01:17:06,102
I was diagnosed, 5 years ago,
with type 1 diabetes.

1347
01:17:06,241 --> 01:17:09,144
I was actually a little bit nervous
to tell them that I had...

1348
01:17:09,266 --> 01:17:11,192
- To tell the French.
- To tell the French.

1349
01:17:11,314 --> 01:17:12,416
There's a place to check off

1350
01:17:12,538 --> 01:17:14,349
whether or not
you have a chronic condition.

1351
01:17:14,506 --> 01:17:17,392
I was nervous that they were going
to charge me more or something.

1352
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,552
And instead, I went into a hospital,

1353
01:17:19,727 --> 01:17:21,494
and had round the clock care

1354
01:17:21,695 --> 01:17:24,301
and they do an amazing amount
of preventative care.

1355
01:17:24,502 --> 01:17:27,493
So they asked you
if you have a pre-existing condition

1356
01:17:27,615 --> 01:17:28,875
- not to punish you...
- Yes.

1357
01:17:28,997 --> 01:17:31,079
- ...but to give you more help?
- Yes.

1358
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:33,126
I was in a hospital for a year

1359
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:35,697
and as soon as I was in,
it was...

1360
01:17:36,099 --> 01:17:38,233
"Well... Don't worry. Just rest."

1361
01:17:38,373 --> 01:17:40,595
- Yes.
- People said "Rest".

1362
01:17:40,717 --> 01:17:42,799
How many sick days you got in a year.
Three, four ?

1363
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:44,452
- I think it's unlimited.
- Yeah.

1364
01:17:44,574 --> 01:17:45,764
- You're sick...
- Unlimited?

1365
01:17:45,886 --> 01:17:48,545
Yes. How can you limit sick days?

1366
01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:49,787
If you're sick, you're sick.

1367
01:17:49,909 --> 01:17:53,066
I've gone to the emergency rooms
numerous times

1368
01:17:53,188 --> 01:17:54,256
with four boys.

1369
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:56,748
And I've never waited more than an hour.
Never.

1370
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:59,652
I can call and have somebody
come to the house within half an hour.

1371
01:17:59,783 --> 01:18:00,785
- No way ?
- Yes.

1372
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:03,168
Making a house call ?
At your place ?

1373
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,582
How many of you have had
a house call from a doctor?

1374
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:07,699
- No!
- Last, 3 AM last Friday.

1375
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:09,780
- And how much does this cost you?
- Nothing.

1376
01:18:09,955 --> 01:18:11,424
What's the service called?

1377
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:17,853
Where are we going?

1378
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:23,930
We are going to see a man
who has abdominal pain.

1379
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:25,925
- Abdominal pain?
- Yeah.

1380
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:29,108
So... If it's just a stomach ache,
why are we going so fast?

1381
01:19:07,893 --> 01:19:09,397
Where do we go next?

1382
01:19:09,555 --> 01:19:11,531
- The next visit?
- Yeah.

1383
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:47,895
One thing that I say to anyone
who'd ask me why I'm in this country

1384
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:49,907
it's that I think it's one
of the familiest,

1385
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,094
friendliest country than I know of.

1386
01:19:52,216 --> 01:19:55,846
And talk about family values.
I mean child care, health care...

1387
01:19:55,968 --> 01:19:57,725
We don't pay for day care,
we don't pay...

1388
01:19:57,847 --> 01:20:00,296
The day care where I set my daughter...
and I was a teacher,

1389
01:20:00,418 --> 01:20:02,255
I mean, the standards are very high.

1390
01:20:05,853 --> 01:20:08,578
So how much does that cost you
to have 2 children here in day care?

1391
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,719
How much per hour?

1392
01:20:16,606 --> 01:20:19,003
Are you happy with
how they're cared for?

1393
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:37,555
Here, my kids, they are sure
that they are going to get

1394
01:20:37,677 --> 01:20:40,721
you know, a certain level of care,
a certain education.

1395
01:20:40,948 --> 01:20:42,619
college I don't have to worry about...

1396
01:20:42,741 --> 01:20:43,743
What do you mean?

1397
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:45,698
- It's free.
- You're kidding?

1398
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:46,914
For nothing?

1399
01:20:47,036 --> 01:20:48,881
You can get college education for free.

1400
01:20:49,003 --> 01:20:50,018
- No way!
- Yes!

1401
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:52,511
There's not a sense of desperation!

1402
01:20:52,633 --> 01:20:53,892
That's the worse part.

1403
01:20:54,189 --> 01:20:55,209
Then they're happy?

1404
01:20:55,336 --> 01:20:58,545
They can spend time with their kids,
they've vacations, family time...

1405
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:00,828
So how many weeks of paid vacations?

1406
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:02,209
Minimum 5 weeks...

1407
01:21:02,331 --> 01:21:04,251
5 weeks ?
Minimum of 5 weeks.

1408
01:21:04,373 --> 01:21:05,408
That's the French law.

1409
01:21:05,572 --> 01:21:08,603
Except if you work for a large company.
Then you get sometimes 8, 10 weeks.

1410
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,561
Remembering that there's a 35 hour week.

1411
01:21:10,701 --> 01:21:12,296
The productivity rate is so high here.

1412
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,406
I read that it was higher
than the United States.

1413
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:15,646
They're relaxed!

1414
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:17,722
If they're working
more than 35 hours a week,

1415
01:21:17,844 --> 01:21:19,139
they get extra days off.

1416
01:21:19,261 --> 01:21:22,200
That is for half time
and full time employees as well.

1417
01:21:22,322 --> 01:21:25,139
You get 5 weeks paid vacations
even if you're a part time employee?

1418
01:21:25,261 --> 01:21:27,203
- Of course, yeah!
- Everybody.

1419
01:21:27,325 --> 01:21:29,442
If you get married,
you get an extra week,

1420
01:21:29,564 --> 01:21:31,418
or extra 7 days for your honey moon.

1421
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:32,949
In addition to your 5 weeks.

1422
01:21:33,071 --> 01:21:34,716
- You're paid on your honey moon?
- Yes.

1423
01:21:34,844 --> 01:21:36,999
- You got 2 days off too...
- Yeah, if you move.

1424
01:21:37,121 --> 01:21:39,308
If you're gonna move
from one apartment to another?

1425
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:40,970
- Yeah.
- One day.

1426
01:21:41,092 --> 01:21:43,103
You've a day to move
and they pay you that day?

1427
01:21:45,342 --> 01:21:47,403
When my daughter was 3 months,
a free service

1428
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:49,303
sent somebody
to your home to give you tips

1429
01:21:49,425 --> 01:21:51,084
on how to put your kid to bed...

1430
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:52,609
every single day, for free.

1431
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:55,797
And they'll come to your house
and do your laundry!

1432
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:59,579
- It will! Sure!
- No!

1433
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,795
Stop! Stop!

1434
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:08,249
What are you doing?

1435
01:22:14,686 --> 01:22:15,945
You from the government?

1436
01:22:19,749 --> 01:22:21,096
Can she do anything else?

1437
01:22:21,411 --> 01:22:22,863
If I want, yes.

1438
01:22:23,143 --> 01:22:25,872
She's, of course, taking care
of the children.

1439
01:22:26,557 --> 01:22:30,297
And I think if I ask her to

1440
01:22:30,498 --> 01:22:32,790
to prepare a meal for tonight,
she can do it.

1441
01:22:39,506 --> 01:22:40,616
No problem.

1442
01:22:41,745 --> 01:22:46,249
She's coming twice a week,
4 hours a day.

1443
01:22:46,424 --> 01:22:48,182
So I can do everything I want

1444
01:22:48,418 --> 01:22:50,464
for me, for the house, for my husband,

1445
01:22:50,587 --> 01:22:51,715
during 4 hours.

1446
01:22:51,907 --> 01:22:53,587
It's very precious for me.

1447
01:22:54,496 --> 01:22:57,356
You don't have any associations?
Nothing to help like that?

1448
01:22:57,478 --> 01:22:58,494
No.

1449
01:22:58,616 --> 01:23:02,237
Nobody from the government
comes to your home in America

1450
01:23:02,499 --> 01:23:05,665
and does your laundry for you,
if you're a new mother.

1451
01:23:06,951 --> 01:23:08,954
- It's difficult.
- Yeah.

1452
01:23:10,328 --> 01:23:14,491
Something that I experience a lot
with my own family is guilt.

1453
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:18,462
Guilt for being here almost and seeing

1454
01:23:18,838 --> 01:23:21,610
the advantages and the benefits I have
at such a young age.

1455
01:23:21,732 --> 01:23:24,645
Things that my parents
work their whole life for

1456
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,190
and haven't even come close to touching.

1457
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:30,417
It's really hard
to know that you're here

1458
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,367
in a very privileged position

1459
01:23:32,489 --> 01:23:33,947
you know, not living the high life,

1460
01:23:34,069 --> 01:23:35,732
but in comparison, definitely.

1461
01:23:35,854 --> 01:23:37,848
And that seems completely...

1462
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:39,890
unfair.

1463
01:23:40,717 --> 01:23:44,110
One of the things that keeps
everything running here is that...

1464
01:23:44,565 --> 01:23:46,288
the government is afraid of the people.

1465
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:48,116
They're afraid of protests.

1466
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:50,425
They're afraid of reactions
from the people.

1467
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:53,432
Whereas in the States,
people are afraid of the government.

1468
01:23:53,589 --> 01:23:56,721
They're afraid of... of...
of acting up.

1469
01:23:56,843 --> 01:23:59,344
They're afraid of protesting.
They're afraid of getting out.

1470
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:01,601
In France, that's what people do.

1471
01:24:42,694 --> 01:24:44,426
Free college education,

1472
01:24:44,548 --> 01:24:45,956
free medical care,

1473
01:24:46,078 --> 01:24:47,968
government employed nannies...

1474
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:51,046
I began to wonder
how do they pay for all this?

1475
01:24:51,506 --> 01:24:54,655
And then I realized...
They're drowning in taxes!

1476
01:24:55,127 --> 01:24:57,471
I wanted to see what effect
this might have

1477
01:24:57,698 --> 01:24:59,745
on a average middle class family.

1478
01:25:00,025 --> 01:25:01,704
So I went to find out.

1479
01:25:06,242 --> 01:25:07,292
- Hello!
- Hello.

1480
01:25:07,414 --> 01:25:08,813
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

1481
01:25:09,722 --> 01:25:11,017
It's really nice.

1482
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:23,450
- It's the news.
- Yes. Thanks.

1483
01:25:26,183 --> 01:25:29,298
What is your combined income
for the 2 of you together

1484
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:30,732
for... say one month?

1485
01:25:36,441 --> 01:25:39,082
And yet you live very nicely
on that income.

1486
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:51,430
And how much do you pay
each month on your mortgage?

1487
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:01,324
How many cars do you own?

1488
01:26:01,464 --> 01:26:02,496
- Two.
- Two.

1489
01:26:02,636 --> 01:26:04,787
Do you owe any money
from medical bills?

1490
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:09,476
Is there any other debts,
loans, anything?

1491
01:26:11,428 --> 01:26:12,723
Only the apartment.

1492
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:16,011
And, what are your other big expenses?

1493
01:26:16,536 --> 01:26:17,620
The fish.

1494
01:26:21,014 --> 01:26:22,492
Vegetables.

1495
01:26:22,614 --> 01:26:24,740
Vegetables are
a big month expense for you.

1496
01:26:24,862 --> 01:26:26,717
Yes. Fruit.

1497
01:26:26,839 --> 01:26:28,850
- Yoghurt.
- Yoghurt.

1498
01:26:29,235 --> 01:26:30,880
What are your other big expenses?

1499
01:26:31,037 --> 01:26:32,157
Holidays.

1500
01:26:32,734 --> 01:26:33,819
Very important.

1501
01:26:49,937 --> 01:26:51,319
- Kenya.
- We like.

1502
01:26:52,736 --> 01:26:53,794
Are you happy?

1503
01:26:53,943 --> 01:26:54,958
Yes.

1504
01:27:14,582 --> 01:27:17,014
After seeing all this,
I began to wonder...

1505
01:27:18,676 --> 01:27:21,370
Was there a reason our government
and our media

1506
01:27:22,077 --> 01:27:24,001
wants us to hate the French?

1507
01:27:30,069 --> 01:27:33,165
Are they worried
we might like the French?

1508
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:40,626
Or like their ways of doing things?

1509
01:27:48,983 --> 01:27:52,306
It was enough to make me
put away my "freedom fries".

1510
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:05,217
Meanwhile, back at home,

1511
01:28:05,637 --> 01:28:08,506
hospitals had found a new way
to deal with patients

1512
01:28:08,628 --> 01:28:10,255
who didn't have health insurance

1513
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:12,632
and couldn't pay their bill.

1514
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:17,260
I was standing up against the wall
and I saw a cab

1515
01:28:17,488 --> 01:28:18,765
do a u-turn,

1516
01:28:19,062 --> 01:28:20,339
pull up to the curb,

1517
01:28:20,496 --> 01:28:22,176
and I watched to see
what was happening

1518
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:24,275
because I had a feeling
what was going to occur,

1519
01:28:24,397 --> 01:28:26,233
'cause it's not a new thing.

1520
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:29,225
They pulled up right here
by this yellow fire hydrant

1521
01:28:29,536 --> 01:28:32,615
and dropped Carol off and
immediately pulled away.

1522
01:28:32,737 --> 01:28:34,047
And as soon as they pulled away,

1523
01:28:34,207 --> 01:28:36,540
she walked out into the street
about out to here.

1524
01:28:36,662 --> 01:28:39,114
She did walk all the way down
to the drive way down here,

1525
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:40,238
completely confused,

1526
01:28:40,365 --> 01:28:42,491
not knowing...
has no shoes on whatsoever

1527
01:28:42,613 --> 01:28:43,915
and just a hospital gown.

1528
01:28:44,043 --> 01:28:46,326
If you've ever been to a hospital,
you know they're thin.

1529
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:48,743
And that's when
one of our staff members went out

1530
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,645
and asked Carol
if she needed any assistance

1531
01:28:50,773 --> 01:28:52,827
and found out that she was confused
and disoriented

1532
01:28:52,978 --> 01:28:54,184
and didn't know where she was.

1533
01:30:09,414 --> 01:30:14,091
Kaiser Permanente in Bellflower hospital
had put her in a cab

1534
01:30:14,382 --> 01:30:18,047
and directed them
to bring her to this drop-off point.

1535
01:30:18,392 --> 01:30:21,755
But the names of the hospitals
had been taken off of both bracelets

1536
01:30:21,877 --> 01:30:22,932
before she arrived here.

1537
01:30:23,054 --> 01:30:26,263
I have seen others here
that have come through our doors,

1538
01:30:26,385 --> 01:30:27,836
who have got IV still on their arms.

1539
01:30:28,294 --> 01:30:30,606
They told me
that at their shelter alone,

1540
01:30:31,061 --> 01:30:34,113
over 50 patients had been dumped there
by hospitals.

1541
01:30:34,646 --> 01:30:35,863
Their options are very few :

1542
01:30:36,001 --> 01:30:37,904
either open the front door
and let them out,

1543
01:30:38,026 --> 01:30:40,659
which isn't the humane thing to do,
something we don't want to do,

1544
01:30:40,823 --> 01:30:43,120
or we try to find some place
for them to go.

1545
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,889
And right now,
Skid Row is the best bet in town.

1546
01:30:48,515 --> 01:30:50,520
In fact, the night before we were there,

1547
01:30:51,005 --> 01:30:54,598
the county hospital run by
the university of Southern California,

1548
01:30:54,973 --> 01:30:57,368
one of the richest private schools
in the country,

1549
01:30:57,558 --> 01:30:59,485
dumped another patient off on the curb.

1550
01:31:01,799 --> 01:31:05,159
A woman unable to pay her hospital bill.

1551
01:31:08,249 --> 01:31:09,413
Do you know how you got here?

1552
01:31:09,535 --> 01:31:11,274
- By the cab.
- The cab?

1553
01:31:11,396 --> 01:31:14,228
From General Hospital,
[they] gave him the cab fare.

1554
01:31:17,338 --> 01:31:21,339
He dropped me off there,
he actually forced me out of the car.

1555
01:31:21,757 --> 01:31:23,550
Ma'am, are you in pain right now?

1556
01:31:24,289 --> 01:31:26,452
- Are you in pain?
- Yes, I am.

1557
01:31:26,574 --> 01:31:27,751
Is there anything we can...

1558
01:31:27,942 --> 01:31:30,947
She, at this time, has broken ribs,
broken collarbone,

1559
01:31:31,297 --> 01:31:34,020
and stitches
that are not completely healed

1560
01:31:34,485 --> 01:31:37,003
across the top of her head
and on the side of her head.

1561
01:31:37,318 --> 01:31:38,467
Now let me ask you, ma'am.

1562
01:31:38,672 --> 01:31:40,235
Before they dropped you off,

1563
01:31:40,506 --> 01:31:43,243
- did they ask you
if you knew where you were going?

1564
01:31:44,454 --> 01:31:47,328
So they didn't ask you any questions
about your orientation,

1565
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:49,809
whether or not you knew
what was going on.

1566
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:53,393
No, they just told me
to take care of myself.

1567
01:31:57,717 --> 01:32:01,343
May I take a minute to ask a question
that has been on my mind?

1568
01:32:03,526 --> 01:32:04,536
Who are we?

1569
01:32:06,921 --> 01:32:08,632
Is this what we've become?

1570
01:32:09,617 --> 01:32:11,724
A nation that dumps its own citizens

1571
01:32:12,192 --> 01:32:14,291
like so much garbage
on the side of the curb,

1572
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:17,077
because they can't pay
their hospital bill?

1573
01:32:19,074 --> 01:32:21,496
I always thought and believe to this day

1574
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,807
that we're good and generous people.

1575
01:32:24,073 --> 01:32:26,099
This is what we do
when somebody's in trouble.

1576
01:32:26,727 --> 01:32:29,874
Anybody gets sick,
we all get together and help.

1577
01:32:30,312 --> 01:32:31,571
People with a good heart...

1578
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:33,809
You feel like you're sacrificing,

1579
01:32:33,946 --> 01:32:35,890
but then you get a blessing
from doing this

1580
01:32:36,012 --> 01:32:37,298
and that's the way we all feel.

1581
01:32:37,736 --> 01:32:38,746
... and a good soul.

1582
01:32:39,049 --> 01:32:40,596
We've got a lot of community support,

1583
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:43,597
and we're gonna all keep working
until we locate this child.

1584
01:32:43,834 --> 01:32:45,737
Neighbors who are quick
to lend a helping hand

1585
01:32:45,859 --> 01:32:47,675
to anyone in their hour of need.

1586
01:32:48,259 --> 01:32:49,860
I deliver meals to them,

1587
01:32:50,462 --> 01:32:54,772
but my life has been so blessed
that it's just the least that I can do.

1588
01:32:55,894 --> 01:32:58,344
They say that you can judge a society

1589
01:32:58,959 --> 01:33:01,627
by how it treats
those who are the worst-off.

1590
01:33:02,913 --> 01:33:04,336
But is the opposite true?

1591
01:33:04,925 --> 01:33:06,539
That you can judge a society

1592
01:33:07,593 --> 01:33:09,358
by how it treats its best?

1593
01:33:11,217 --> 01:33:12,353
Its heroes?

1594
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,800
The firefighters and police,
rescue and recovery workers

1595
01:33:17,142 --> 01:33:19,140
have responded with true heroism.

1596
01:33:20,667 --> 01:33:22,582
It was their initial heroism

1597
01:33:23,034 --> 01:33:25,709
that thwarted
the objectives of the terrorists.

1598
01:33:26,236 --> 01:33:28,332
Without regard, in many instances,

1599
01:33:28,521 --> 01:33:31,286
to their own safety and security...

1600
01:33:31,408 --> 01:33:33,186
They truly are heroes.

1601
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:35,636
We owe them everything!

1602
01:33:37,024 --> 01:33:38,912
Here they are, folks, the men and women

1603
01:33:39,131 --> 01:33:41,349
who have been on the frontlines,
for New York,

1604
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:43,346
and for all of us in America!

1605
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,170
Tonight is dedicated to you!

1606
01:33:53,463 --> 01:33:55,545
Don't forget about the raffles
going on over there,

1607
01:33:55,673 --> 01:33:57,274
we got $1 each.

1608
01:33:58,465 --> 01:34:00,681
I spent two and a half year down there,

1609
01:34:01,147 --> 01:34:04,035
I got upper and lower,
breathing problems.

1610
01:34:04,157 --> 01:34:05,658
I need a double lung transplant

1611
01:34:05,827 --> 01:34:07,715
but I was diagnosed
for pulmonary fibrosis.

1612
01:34:07,837 --> 01:34:11,402
I haven't slept in a bed
in over 5 years, I sleep on a chair...

1613
01:34:11,607 --> 01:34:14,740
with a blanket in the living room,
because if I lay down, I can't breathe.

1614
01:34:15,175 --> 01:34:17,885
There were hundreds of rescue workers
on 9/11

1615
01:34:18,104 --> 01:34:20,060
who were not city employees,

1616
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:24,636
but rather went down to Ground Zero
on their own to help out.

1617
01:34:24,758 --> 01:34:26,851
We need volunteers for Thursday!

1618
01:34:27,043 --> 01:34:30,874
And many developed
serious respiratory illnesses.

1619
01:34:31,709 --> 01:34:33,488
That's when the government said,

1620
01:34:33,665 --> 01:34:38,154
"They are not our responsibility,
because they weren't on our payroll."

1621
01:34:40,456 --> 01:34:44,465
John Graham is an EMT volunteer
from Paramus, New Jersey.

1622
01:34:45,749 --> 01:34:48,783
He was in Lower Manhattan
when he heard the planes hit,

1623
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:50,650
and rushed over to help.

1624
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:54,730
He worked in the rescue effort
for the next few months,

1625
01:34:54,931 --> 01:34:58,407
but then had trouble receiving benefits
for his illness.

1626
01:34:59,875 --> 01:35:02,051
No, they'd just deny it for any reason.

1627
01:35:02,789 --> 01:35:05,252
It's just a terrible waiting game.

1628
01:35:05,389 --> 01:35:07,702
I really feel like
they're waiting for you to die.

1629
01:35:09,481 --> 01:35:10,521
It's terrible.

1630
01:35:10,958 --> 01:35:12,655
I never thought that we would do this.

1631
01:35:14,188 --> 01:35:15,995
That the United States would do this.

1632
01:35:16,117 --> 01:35:20,003
William Maher is a volunteer member
of New Jersey's fire service.

1633
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:23,689
He spent two months
working on the pile at Ground Zero,

1634
01:35:23,894 --> 01:35:28,342
recovering bodies or body parts,
and it deeply affected him.

1635
01:35:28,464 --> 01:35:31,748
I'm experiencing
a lot of disturbing dreams,

1636
01:35:31,886 --> 01:35:33,589
or whatever you'd like to call them,

1637
01:35:33,802 --> 01:35:37,077
and it affected
what I was doing at night,

1638
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:38,432
and you know, unaware of it

1639
01:35:38,554 --> 01:35:41,620
because I was asleep and I just kept
grinding and grinding my teeth.

1640
01:35:41,742 --> 01:35:44,767
The upper fronts are damaged,
practically beyond repair

1641
01:35:44,889 --> 01:35:48,022
because of my constant grinding
over the last three years.

1642
01:35:48,199 --> 01:35:49,970
Before, I was
at workers-comp. board already

1643
01:35:50,092 --> 01:35:54,243
for the 9/11 volunteers fund,
and I've been denied 3 times,

1644
01:35:54,365 --> 01:35:58,690
and hopefully I will go
on my 4th appeal soon,

1645
01:35:58,812 --> 01:36:01,101
if I can get
the necessary documentation.

1646
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:06,876
Of course,
there was a $50 million fund set up

1647
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,352
supposedly to help rescue workers.

1648
01:36:09,694 --> 01:36:12,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
the governor of New York, George Pataki.

1649
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:16,211
But the government,
like the health insurance companies,

1650
01:36:16,731 --> 01:36:19,796
made it very difficult
for people to receive help.

1651
01:36:20,218 --> 01:36:24,241
You have to have spent
a certain amount of time at Ground Zero,

1652
01:36:24,364 --> 01:36:27,389
you have to be able to establish that,

1653
01:36:27,511 --> 01:36:31,602
you do have to file an affidavit
within the next year,

1654
01:36:32,302 --> 01:36:34,903
relating your work experiences
at Ground Zero

1655
01:36:35,025 --> 01:36:37,927
and even with all of that,
it's not automatic.

1656
01:36:38,049 --> 01:36:40,785
There is a presumption,
when certain illnesses occur,

1657
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:45,086
but that presumption can be rebutted
by other medical evidence.

1658
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:49,905
So we think it is a very fair approach
that protects our heroes.

1659
01:36:57,038 --> 01:36:58,043
I'm sorry.

1660
01:36:58,375 --> 01:37:03,233
Reggie Cervantes was a volunteer
emergency medical technician on 9/11.

1661
01:37:03,661 --> 01:37:05,496
Nothing makes it go away sometimes,

1662
01:37:05,618 --> 01:37:09,661
not water, not cough medicine,
not anything,

1663
01:37:09,839 --> 01:37:11,796
It's just...

1664
01:37:12,334 --> 01:37:16,110
burning in my throat and irritated
and it just gets to me coughing.

1665
01:37:16,507 --> 01:37:18,477
Sometimes I have trouble breathing

1666
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:20,393
because I can't catch my breath.

1667
01:37:23,123 --> 01:37:24,959
Reggie spent her days at Ground Zero

1668
01:37:25,558 --> 01:37:28,883
carrying bodies
and treating other rescue workers.

1669
01:37:29,307 --> 01:37:32,550
My airway was totally burnt
that first week,

1670
01:37:32,673 --> 01:37:34,684
and I had trouble breathing by then.

1671
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:37,919
But we wanted to see
if we could dig anybody up alive,

1672
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:39,272
we wanted to see...

1673
01:37:40,408 --> 01:37:43,446
if we had lost anybody,
if we were still missing somebody.

1674
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:47,952
I wanted to help.
I was trained for this.

1675
01:37:48,567 --> 01:37:52,070
You know, you see somebody
who is in need, you help them.

1676
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:56,869
Reggie had difficulty getting treatment.

1677
01:37:57,649 --> 01:38:00,358
Too sick to work, and with no income,

1678
01:38:00,825 --> 01:38:02,576
she was forced to quit her job,

1679
01:38:02,946 --> 01:38:06,818
and used her savings to move her
and her kids out of the city.

1680
01:38:09,664 --> 01:38:12,295
It's hard to figure out
how you're supposed to get help.

1681
01:38:12,892 --> 01:38:15,232
We're trying to go about it
the right way.

1682
01:38:16,929 --> 01:38:17,982
But we're ignored.

1683
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:23,018
But not everyone after 9/11
was ignored by the government.

1684
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,760
We're now approaching the 5-year
anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

1685
01:38:29,772 --> 01:38:32,673
So I'm announcing today
that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed,

1686
01:38:33,665 --> 01:38:36,675
Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi Binalshibh,

1687
01:38:37,106 --> 01:38:39,993
and 11 other terrorists in CIA custody,

1688
01:38:40,211 --> 01:38:43,931
had been transferred to
the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay.

1689
01:38:45,928 --> 01:38:47,174
On that island today

1690
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:51,333
are some of the world's
most ardent enemy combatants.

1691
01:38:51,665 --> 01:38:55,168
These detainees are deadly
and include the 20th hijacker,

1692
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,808
as well as a number
of Osama bin Laden's personal bodyguards

1693
01:38:59,123 --> 01:39:03,054
and others who had a direct role
in the September 11 attacks.

1694
01:39:03,967 --> 01:39:06,320
The kind of people held in Guantanamo

1695
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:09,474
include terrorist trainers,
bomb makers...

1696
01:39:09,697 --> 01:39:11,648
Many of them have
American blood on their hands

1697
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:15,061
and they are certainly
the elite of Al-Quaeda.

1698
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:17,578
It seems to me we have an obligation

1699
01:39:17,897 --> 01:39:21,796
to treat these individuals
as enemy combatants.

1700
01:39:23,028 --> 01:39:26,763
And then I learned
it wasn't all bad news, at Gitmo.

1701
01:39:32,813 --> 01:39:35,905
Detainees representing a threat
to our national security

1702
01:39:36,543 --> 01:39:39,057
are given access
to top-notch medical facilities.

1703
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:42,519
They have acute care, 24 hours a day,

1704
01:39:42,828 --> 01:39:44,665
in which surgical procedures,

1705
01:39:44,803 --> 01:39:48,367
everything can be performed right there,
in the detainee camps.

1706
01:39:48,546 --> 01:39:51,399
This is the dental clinic,
well, the health clinic/dental clinic.

1707
01:39:51,521 --> 01:39:53,314
We have a physical therapy department,

1708
01:39:53,436 --> 01:39:55,885
we have X-ray capabilities
with digital X-rays.

1709
01:39:56,104 --> 01:39:58,074
We have one single operating room.

1710
01:39:58,229 --> 01:40:03,415
Health personal to detainee ratio
is 1 to 4, remarkably high.

1711
01:40:03,538 --> 01:40:05,905
We do sick call on the blocks
3 times per week,

1712
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,577
care for them there if they can.

1713
01:40:07,852 --> 01:40:10,424
We'll bring that detainee
back to the clinic to be seen there.

1714
01:40:10,928 --> 01:40:13,120
Screening for cancer
is taking place there.

1715
01:40:13,243 --> 01:40:14,859
Colonoscopy is a procedure

1716
01:40:14,981 --> 01:40:17,903
which is performed there
on a routine basis.

1717
01:40:18,025 --> 01:40:20,964
We have diabetes, high blood-pressure,
high cholesterol.

1718
01:40:21,299 --> 01:40:24,256
We do periodically monitor of the weight
and nutrition of the detainees,

1719
01:40:24,378 --> 01:40:25,939
so that we can track those detainees

1720
01:40:26,061 --> 01:40:27,754
to make sure
we're seeing them frequently,

1721
01:40:27,929 --> 01:40:30,450
monitoring their labs [test results]
and their overall health.

1722
01:40:30,578 --> 01:40:31,880
Their medical attention...

1723
01:40:32,017 --> 01:40:34,263
They're getting
way better medical treatment than...

1724
01:40:34,414 --> 01:40:35,835
I've ever had.

1725
01:40:37,135 --> 01:40:39,480
So you think it's as good as most HMOs
in the US?

1726
01:40:39,602 --> 01:40:41,422
Certainly very similar and as good, sir.

1727
01:40:41,589 --> 01:40:44,363
I live with an impression
that health care there is...

1728
01:40:44,897 --> 01:40:47,775
clearly better
than they received at home

1729
01:40:48,514 --> 01:40:52,353
and as good as many people
receive in the USA.

1730
01:40:53,973 --> 01:40:56,997
So there is actually one place
on American soil

1731
01:40:57,339 --> 01:40:59,802
that had free universal health care.

1732
01:41:00,811 --> 01:41:02,700
That's all I needed to know.

1733
01:41:04,876 --> 01:41:06,750
I went down to Miami, Florida,

1734
01:41:08,072 --> 01:41:09,444
got myself a boat,

1735
01:41:10,835 --> 01:41:12,400
and loaded up Bill,

1736
01:41:13,166 --> 01:41:14,187
Reggie,

1737
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:15,906
and John...

1738
01:41:16,552 --> 01:41:18,678
- Thanks.
- Welcome, sir.

1739
01:41:18,871 --> 01:41:20,179
... and anyone else I could find

1740
01:41:20,301 --> 01:41:22,871
that needed to see a doctor
and couldn't afford one.

1741
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:26,659
So many people showed up,
I had to get a couple extra boats.

1742
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:29,571
And I called up Danna Smith from Denver,

1743
01:41:29,803 --> 01:41:32,348
who is now on 9 different medications,

1744
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:34,711
and asked her
if she'd like to come along.

1745
01:41:34,963 --> 01:41:38,277
I figured she'd like to get out
of her daughter's basement for a while.

1746
01:41:39,249 --> 01:41:40,350
All right, let's go!

1747
01:41:56,904 --> 01:41:58,933
Which way to Guantanamo Bay?

1748
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,076
Can we go?

1749
01:42:01,617 --> 01:42:04,261
We're not going to Cuba,
we're going to America!

1750
01:42:05,211 --> 01:42:06,641
It's American soil!

1751
01:42:43,748 --> 01:42:44,762
We made it.

1752
01:43:00,629 --> 01:43:02,735
There it is. There's the runway.

1753
01:43:03,525 --> 01:43:06,075
That's the prison over there
where the detainees are.

1754
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:08,772
- We're very close.
- Yes, we're very close.

1755
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,657
The white building is the hospital,
I think.

1756
01:43:17,112 --> 01:43:18,194
Okay, let's go.

1757
01:43:23,527 --> 01:43:25,208
We commandeered a fishing boat,

1758
01:43:26,114 --> 01:43:28,259
and sailed into Guantanamo Bay.

1759
01:43:30,153 --> 01:43:31,886
As we approached the line in the water

1760
01:43:32,008 --> 01:43:34,771
between the American
and Cuban side of the bay,

1761
01:43:35,099 --> 01:43:37,167
we were told to be careful for mines.

1762
01:43:40,652 --> 01:43:41,946
Permission to enter.

1763
01:43:42,352 --> 01:43:44,835
I have three 9/11 rescue workers.

1764
01:43:45,579 --> 01:43:47,434
They need some medical attention.

1765
01:43:52,187 --> 01:43:56,950
These are 9/11 rescue workers,
they just want some medical attention.

1766
01:43:57,153 --> 01:43:59,356
The same kind that Al-Qaeda is getting.

1767
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:04,915
They don't want any more
than you're giving the evil-doers.

1768
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:06,610
Just the same.

1769
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:12,910
No one in the guard tower was responding
and then,

1770
01:44:13,076 --> 01:44:14,950
suddenly we heard a siren

1771
01:44:15,201 --> 01:44:17,269
and we figured
it was time to get out of here.

1772
01:44:18,061 --> 01:44:20,979
But what was I supposed to do
with all these sick people

1773
01:44:21,211 --> 01:44:22,713
and no one to help them.

1774
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:26,755
I mean here, we were stuck
at some God-forsaken Third-World country

1775
01:44:27,238 --> 01:44:28,649
and communists, no less.

1776
01:44:29,054 --> 01:44:31,856
When I was a kid,
these people wanted to kill us.

1777
01:44:32,802 --> 01:44:34,348
What was I supposed to do?

1778
01:44:55,165 --> 01:44:57,652
Excuse me, we're looking for a doctor.

1779
01:44:57,774 --> 01:44:59,238
Is there a doctor here in Cuba?

1780
01:45:14,904 --> 01:45:16,799
All right, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1781
01:45:17,579 --> 01:45:20,143
OK. OK. I know what you're thinking.

1782
01:45:20,651 --> 01:45:22,474
Cuba is where Lucifer lives.

1783
01:45:25,479 --> 01:45:27,373
The worse place on Earth.

1784
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:29,956
The most evil nation ever created.

1785
01:45:30,937 --> 01:45:32,344
How do we know that?

1786
01:45:32,664 --> 01:45:35,372
Cause that's what we've been told
for over 45 years.

1787
01:45:35,585 --> 01:45:38,514
... that a series of offensive
missile sites

1788
01:45:39,027 --> 01:45:42,549
can be none other than to provide
a nuclear strike capability

1789
01:45:43,017 --> 01:45:44,568
against the western hemisphere.

1790
01:45:44,731 --> 01:45:46,760
I'm not gonna yield until Fidel Castro

1791
01:45:47,038 --> 01:45:48,731
allows freedom on the island.

1792
01:45:51,504 --> 01:45:53,216
You can count on it.

1793
01:45:54,276 --> 01:45:55,367
Put it in the bank.

1794
01:45:56,630 --> 01:45:59,128
It seems that what really bugged us
about Castro

1795
01:45:59,559 --> 01:46:03,009
was that he overthrew
the dictator that we liked.

1796
01:46:03,669 --> 01:46:06,683
And replaced him with a dictator
that we didn't like:

1797
01:46:07,466 --> 01:46:09,149
himself.

1798
01:46:10,283 --> 01:46:12,522
And so now, after all these years,

1799
01:46:12,861 --> 01:46:14,794
the one thing the Cubans do have,

1800
01:46:15,004 --> 01:46:17,387
is free universal health care.

1801
01:46:17,966 --> 01:46:19,994
They've become known around the world

1802
01:46:20,248 --> 01:46:23,071
as having not only one
of the best health care systems

1803
01:46:23,448 --> 01:46:26,740
but as being one of the most
generous countries in providing doctors

1804
01:46:26,899 --> 01:46:29,683
and medical equipment
to Third World countries.

1805
01:46:30,002 --> 01:46:34,629
In the US, health care cost
run nearly $6.000 per person.

1806
01:46:34,873 --> 01:46:38,468
But in Cuba, they spend only $251.

1807
01:46:38,727 --> 01:46:40,627
And yet the Cubans are able to have

1808
01:46:40,764 --> 01:46:43,205
a lower infant mortality rate
than the US,

1809
01:46:43,622 --> 01:46:46,636
a longer average live-span than the US.

1810
01:46:47,488 --> 01:46:49,813
They believe in preventative medicine.

1811
01:46:49,973 --> 01:46:52,557
And it seems like there's a doctor
on every block.

1812
01:46:54,134 --> 01:46:56,680
Their only sin,
when it comes to health care,

1813
01:46:56,975 --> 01:47:01,034
seems to be that
they don't do it for profit.

1814
01:47:01,487 --> 01:47:04,257
Anybody got any medication right now
for the pharmacy?

1815
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:12,074
Hello. Are you the pharmacist?

1816
01:47:12,938 --> 01:47:14,278
You have this?

1817
01:47:16,844 --> 01:47:19,218
- Cause this one's similar to yours?
- Yeah.

1818
01:47:19,952 --> 01:47:21,866
It's a $120 in the US.

1819
01:47:21,986 --> 01:47:24,283
- This is a $120 in the US.
- Yes.

1820
01:47:27,572 --> 01:47:29,820
3.20. So how much is that
in American dollars?

1821
01:47:30,144 --> 01:47:32,374
It's like a... 5 cents.

1822
01:47:32,603 --> 01:47:33,603
- 5 cents?
- Yeah.

1823
01:47:47,081 --> 01:47:48,584
Thank you very much.

1824
01:47:48,978 --> 01:47:50,452
Muchas Gracias.

1825
01:47:51,137 --> 01:47:54,518
A $120 is a lot of money
when you're getting

1826
01:47:54,642 --> 01:47:59,107
a $1000 in security disability [checks]
and you need 1 or 2 a month.

1827
01:47:59,294 --> 01:48:02,767
5 cents here,
it's like the biggest insult.

1828
01:48:03,672 --> 01:48:05,786
It just doesn't make any sense.

1829
01:48:09,456 --> 01:48:12,496
I wanna fill a suitcase up
and go back home with it.

1830
01:48:38,463 --> 01:48:41,411
I took my group of sick Americans
to a hospital

1831
01:48:41,693 --> 01:48:43,721
to see if they could get some care.

1832
01:48:45,564 --> 01:48:48,511
They didn't ask for money
or an insurance card.

1833
01:48:51,799 --> 01:48:52,870
Just their name.

1834
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:01,736
That was the entire intake session.

1835
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:24,004
Thank you very much for doing this.

1836
01:49:26,704 --> 01:49:29,278
I asked them
to give us the same exact care

1837
01:49:29,512 --> 01:49:31,972
they give their fellow Cubans citizens.

1838
01:49:32,118 --> 01:49:34,099
No more, no less.

1839
01:49:34,558 --> 01:49:36,385
And that's what they did.

1840
01:49:36,768 --> 01:49:39,787
I'm Dr. Roque. I'm going turn
on my decent specialties.

1841
01:49:39,983 --> 01:49:41,859
- John Graham.
- How are you feeling?

1842
01:49:42,213 --> 01:49:44,414
My lungs hurt. I have pain.

1843
01:49:44,897 --> 01:49:47,931
I get pretty severe
nose bleeds at times.

1844
01:49:48,069 --> 01:49:50,129
I get terrible headaches
in the middle of the night

1845
01:49:50,277 --> 01:49:51,467
but I haven't been evaluated

1846
01:49:51,593 --> 01:49:53,445
for the sleep apnea for 9 years.

1847
01:49:53,567 --> 01:49:57,246
- Yeah, I have...
- Many medications for lungs problems.

1848
01:49:57,590 --> 01:50:00,260
Almost every medication
for lung problems, I've got.

1849
01:50:00,508 --> 01:50:04,365
After 9/11, since the things that have
happened, my teeth sort of falling out.

1850
01:50:04,485 --> 01:50:07,777
Because of certain conditions,
I was grinding.

1851
01:50:07,974 --> 01:50:10,471
There's one test
that they recommended I take,

1852
01:50:10,597 --> 01:50:13,185
that is about 5 to $7.000.

1853
01:50:13,307 --> 01:50:18,440
The dentist that I talked to,
it's like $15.000 or more.

1854
01:50:18,607 --> 01:50:20,969
Now it's 2 years
I have no medical coverage

1855
01:50:21,156 --> 01:50:23,506
so I can't go for the last part
of the test.

1856
01:50:26,191 --> 01:50:28,545
It's okay, everything's gonna be okay.
Right?

1857
01:50:30,162 --> 01:50:31,312
I am so...

1858
01:50:32,401 --> 01:50:36,449
It's so hard for me to digest
somebody saying it's free.

1859
01:50:37,893 --> 01:50:41,989
Because 20 years of our lives
have been spent fighting.

1860
01:50:42,927 --> 01:50:46,544
So I am so grateful. I...

1861
01:50:47,735 --> 01:50:50,098
No, You don't need to say that.

1862
01:50:53,807 --> 01:50:56,296
Come on, don't cry.
Everything's gonna be okay. Right?

1863
01:50:56,721 --> 01:50:59,056
At least what we can do, right?

1864
01:52:21,342 --> 01:52:25,581
Reggie was diagnosed with a series
of pulmonary and bronchial problems.

1865
01:52:26,107 --> 01:52:29,629
The Cubans doctors gave her
a treatment plan to follow back home.

1866
01:52:30,877 --> 01:52:33,949
Along with some
of those 5 cent inhalers.

1867
01:52:35,116 --> 01:52:38,772
William Maher received a number
of treatments on his neck and his back.

1868
01:52:39,091 --> 01:52:41,694
And having ground down his teeth
for 3 years straight

1869
01:52:41,819 --> 01:52:44,213
due to post-traumatic stress disorder

1870
01:52:44,446 --> 01:52:46,862
he left Cuba with a new set of teeth.

1871
01:52:49,304 --> 01:52:53,201
After a series of test on his heart,
lungs, blood and stomach,

1872
01:52:53,492 --> 01:52:55,980
John now knew
what his ailments were.

1873
01:52:56,253 --> 01:52:59,631
He was given a strict plan to follow,
plus a number of treatments

1874
01:53:00,526 --> 01:53:03,263
and was feeling better
than he had in years.

1875
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:08,688
The Cubans doctors were able
to take Donna of 5 of her 9 medications.

1876
01:53:09,093 --> 01:53:10,863
And with a correct diagnosis,

1877
01:53:11,112 --> 01:53:15,281
gave her a treatment plan
to help her live a more normal life.

1878
01:53:21,434 --> 01:53:23,656
When the firefighters and paramedics
in Havana

1879
01:53:23,776 --> 01:53:26,264
heard that the 9/11 rescue workers
were in town,

1880
01:53:26,530 --> 01:53:29,152
they invited them over
to one of their fire houses.

1881
01:53:29,817 --> 01:53:31,832
And so, on our last day there,

1882
01:53:32,173 --> 01:53:34,756
as we arrived, they stood at attention

1883
01:53:34,948 --> 01:53:37,752
because, they said, they wanted to honor

1884
01:53:38,058 --> 01:53:39,694
the heroes of 9/11.

1885
01:54:26,018 --> 01:54:27,022
My brother.

1886
01:54:27,148 --> 01:54:31,206
The brothers we lost on 9/11
was felt around the world.

1887
01:54:37,373 --> 01:54:39,468
Don't hesitate to hug your brother.

1888
01:54:44,973 --> 01:54:47,365
It's very important to them
to wear the SCBA

1889
01:54:47,485 --> 01:54:49,576
so they don't end up like me.

1890
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:51,921
These tanks.

1891
01:54:52,043 --> 01:54:53,964
SCBA :
Self Contained Breathing Aparatus.

1892
01:55:17,442 --> 01:55:20,542
If this is what can happen
between supposed enemies,

1893
01:55:21,202 --> 01:55:24,762
if one enemy can hold out his hand
and offer to heal,

1894
01:55:25,173 --> 01:55:27,594
then what else is possible?

1895
01:55:28,807 --> 01:55:31,241
"Mike, fahrenheit is not
a temperature measurement."

1896
01:55:31,368 --> 01:55:33,851
That's when I heard that the man
who runs the biggest

1897
01:55:33,986 --> 01:55:36,515
anti-Michael Moore website
on the internet

1898
01:55:36,845 --> 01:55:38,988
was going to have to shut it down.

1899
01:55:39,113 --> 01:55:41,893
BAD NEWS
He could no longer afford to keep it up

1900
01:55:42,225 --> 01:55:44,048
because his wife was ill

1901
01:55:44,402 --> 01:55:47,570
and they couldn't afford
to pay for her health insurance.

1902
01:55:48,674 --> 01:55:51,890
He was faced with a choice of
either keep attacking me

1903
01:55:52,564 --> 01:55:54,774
or pay for his wife's health.

1904
01:55:55,817 --> 01:55:58,545
Fortunately, he chose his wife.

1905
01:55:59,657 --> 01:56:03,293
But something seemed wrong about
being forced into such a decision.

1906
01:56:04,016 --> 01:56:05,719
Why in a free country

1907
01:56:05,896 --> 01:56:08,250
shouldn't he be able
to have health insurance

1908
01:56:08,424 --> 01:56:10,711
and exercise his 1st Amendment right

1909
01:56:10,883 --> 01:56:12,979
to run me into the ground?

1910
01:56:14,609 --> 01:56:18,992
So I wrote a check for the $12.000
he needed to keep his wife insured

1911
01:56:19,174 --> 01:56:22,781
and in treatment,
and send it to him anonymously.

1912
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:27,262
His wife got better

1913
01:56:27,717 --> 01:56:30,703
and his website is still going strong.

1914
01:56:36,691 --> 01:56:38,854
It was hard for me to acknowledge that

1915
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:42,444
in the end,
we truly are all in the same boat.

1916
01:56:43,467 --> 01:56:45,908
And that,
no matter what are our differences,

1917
01:56:46,211 --> 01:56:48,508
we sink or swim together.

1918
01:56:49,343 --> 01:56:52,309
That's how it seems to be
everywhere else.

1919
01:56:53,405 --> 01:56:55,377
They take care of each other.

1920
01:56:55,597 --> 01:56:57,482
No matter what their disagreements.

1921
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:01,996
You know, when we see
a good idea from another country,

1922
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:03,907
we grab it.

1923
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:07,605
If they build a better car,
we drive it.

1924
01:57:08,961 --> 01:57:11,870
If they make a better wine,
we drink it.

1925
01:57:13,238 --> 01:57:16,185
So, if they have come up with
a better way to treat the sick,

1926
01:57:16,927 --> 01:57:18,664
to teach their kids,

1927
01:57:19,831 --> 01:57:21,879
to take care of their babies,

1928
01:57:23,286 --> 01:57:25,487
to simply be good to each other,

1929
01:57:25,908 --> 01:57:27,558
then what's our problem?

1930
01:57:28,690 --> 01:57:30,453
Why can't we do that?

1931
01:57:31,490 --> 01:57:33,168
They live in a world of "we",

1932
01:57:33,455 --> 01:57:34,809
not "me".

1933
01:57:35,885 --> 01:57:39,550
We'll never fix anything until
we get that one basic thing right.

1934
01:57:40,584 --> 01:57:43,540
And powerful forces hope
that we never do.

1935
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:48,011
And that we remain the only country
in the western world

1936
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:51,686
without free universal health care.

1937
01:57:52,404 --> 01:57:55,849
You know, if we ever did remove
the chokehold of medical bills,

1938
01:57:56,542 --> 01:57:59,594
college loans, day care,

1939
01:57:59,728 --> 01:58:02,896
and everything else that makes us afraid
to step out of line,

1940
01:58:04,086 --> 01:58:06,107
well, watch out,

1941
01:58:06,890 --> 01:58:09,115
cause it'll be a new day in America.

1942
01:58:10,269 --> 01:58:14,011
In the meantime,
I'm gonna go get the government

1943
01:58:14,915 --> 01:58:16,063
to do my laundry.
