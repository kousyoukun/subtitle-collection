1
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,108
<i>(applause and cheering)</i>

2
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,587
We got issue in America.

3
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,593
Too many good docs
are getting out of business.

4
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:34,258
Too many ob-gyns aren't able to practice
their love with women across this country.

5
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:47,441
I don't have a job. I don't want to have
any more debt out to anybody else.

6
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,607
I'm flushing the wound.

7
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,707
<i>(man) This is Adam.</i>

8
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,389
<i>He had an accident.</i>

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:24,213
<i>He's one of nearly 50 million Americans
with no health insurance.</i>

10
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,223
<i>But this film isn't about Adam.</i>

11
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,928
So this is the table saw.
It was spinning that way...

12
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,997
<i>(man) This is Rick.</i>

13
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,713
I was gripping a piece of wood
and I grabbed it here and it hit a knot...

14
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:00,082
<i>(man) He sawed off the tops
of two of his fingers.</i>

15
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,314
...and it was that quick.

16
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,817
<i>- (man) His first thought?
- I don't have insurance.</i>

17
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,159
Am I gonna have to pay cash for this?
$2,000, $3,000 or more?

18
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,530
Does that mean
we're not gonna get a car?

19
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,262
<i>(man) Rick also doesn't have
health coverage.</i>

20
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,602
<i>So the hospital gave him a choice.</i>

21
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:24,404
<i>Reattach the middle finger for $60,000.</i>

22
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,969
<i>Or do the ring finger for 12,000.</i>

23
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:33,314
It's an awful feeling
to just try to put a value on your body.

24
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:41,921
<i>(man) Being a hopeless romantic,
Rick chose the ring finger.</i>

25
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,930
<i>For the bargain price of 12 grand.</i>

26
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:50,903
<i>The top of his middle finger now enjoys
its new home in an Oregon landfill.</i>

27
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:03,247
I can do that thing where, you know,
the old man used to pull the finger off.

28
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,020
<i>(man) This movie
isn't about Rick either.</i>

29
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:16,221
<i>Yes. There are nearly 50 million Americans
with no health insurance.</i>

30
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,924
<i>They pray every day
they don't get sick.</i>

31
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,990
<i>Because 18,000 of them
will die this year.</i>

32
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,559
<i>Simply because they're uninsured.</i>

33
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,367
<i>But this movie isn't about them.</i>

34
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:34,539
<i>It's about the 250 million of you
who have health insurance.</i>

35
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,846
<i>Those of you who are living
the American Dream.</i>

36
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:53,722
<i>It's moving day
for Larry and Donna Smith.</i>

37
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:02,365
<i>They've packed everything they own
in these two cars.</i>

38
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,473
<i>And are driving to Denver. Colorado.</i>

39
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,779
<i>To their new home...</i>

40
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,841
- Hi.
- Hello.

41
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,014
<i>... in their daughter's storage room.</i>

42
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,284
This is home, sweet home.

43
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:24,027
- Look at all that stuff.
- We'll get everything organized.

44
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,725
- We will.
- What do we do with the computer?

45
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,960
- It stays.
- It stays there.

46
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,604
So this is where Heather talked about
we might have to put bunk beds.

47
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,507
I see what she's talking about.

48
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,904
<i>(man) It wasn't supposed to
end up like this for Larry and Donna.</i>

49
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,348
<i>They both had good jobs.</i>

50
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,150
<i>She was a newspaper editor.</i>

51
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,816
<i>And he was a union machinist.</i>

52
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:59,053
<i>They raised six kids who all went to
fine schools like the University of Chicago.</i>

53
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,794
<i>But Larry had a heart attack.</i>

54
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,234
<i>And then another one.</i>

55
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,631
<i>And then another one.</i>

56
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,532
<i>And then Donna got cancer.</i>

57
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,906
<i>And even though
they had health insurance.</i>

58
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,610
<i>The copays and deductibles
soon added up</i>

59
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,678
<i>to the point where they could no longer
afford to keep their home.</i>

60
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:27,385
If somebody told me ten years ago this was
gonna happen to us because of healthcare,

61
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,860
I would have said, "It's not possible."

62
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:35,458
"Not in the United States.
We wouldn't let that happen to people."

63
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,796
<i>- (Larry) Are we gonna quit?
- No.</i>

64
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,700
It's just hard.

65
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,378
<i>(man) They were bankrupt.</i>

66
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,973
<i>So they moved in
with their daughter.</i>

67
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,450
We'll get it all figured out.

68
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,311
We emptied the dresser
so you have a spot.

69
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,254
Nice, very nice.

70
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,388
<i>(man) Even their son Danny
popped in from across town</i>

71
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,659
<i>to welcome them to Denver.</i>

72
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,362
- What do we do about people like you?
- I don't know, that's a good question.

73
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:15,373
You're supposed to pay a deductible for
$9,000, I understand. That's healthcare.

74
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,410
What about people like Kathy and I
that have to come up there

75
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,572
and move you every five years,
every two years, every year,

76
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,014
- 'cause you don't have enough money?
- That's what Russell says too.

77
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:29,020
I'm sorry. It's not what we wanted
to have happen in life.

78
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,023
And we're doing what we can
to make the change.

79
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:36,960
You don't know what that feels like inside
at 50-some years old,

80
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,590
to have to reach out
to my 20-something-year-old for help.

81
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:45,569
It's gonna be hard for four, five, six,
seven months, it's gonna be hard.

82
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:51,770
I have a feeling of you bring your problems
with you no matter where you go.

83
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,074
Yeah.

84
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,638
But I don't know
what to do about that.

85
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,650
<i>(man) By sheer coincidence.
Their daughter's husband. Paul.</i>

86
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,956
<i>Was leaving on a job
the very same day they arrived.</i>

87
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,597
<i>Paul was a contractor.
But there weren't many jobs lately.</i>

88
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,897
<i>So he found work out of town.</i>

89
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,928
I'm sure you'll keep
a telephone conversation.

90
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,998
Email you.

91
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,179
<i>(Donna) You're gonna be
just fine, lovies.</i>

92
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,778
Weird situation, isn't it?

93
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,389
<i>- (man) Tell me where Daddy's going.
- Iraq.</i>

94
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,462
Why is Daddy going to Iraq?

95
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,694
To do some plumbing.

96
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,539
Oh, boy.

97
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:03,644
This I do early in the morning.
The first thing I do is I clean here.

98
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:10,852
<i>(man) At age 79. Frank Cardile should
be kicking back on a beach somewhere.</i>

99
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,017
<i>But even though
he's insured by Medicare.</i>

100
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:19,622
<i>It doesn't cover all the cost of the drugs
that he and his wife need.</i>

101
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,531
<i>(Frank) Being that I'm an employee here,
my medicine is for free.</i>

102
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:31,942
So that's why I gotta keep working.
Until I die.

103
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,377
There is nothing wrong with that.

104
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,244
OK.

105
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:40,149
I always gotta keep my ears open
because there's always spillages.

106
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,881
Sometimes you get a gallon of milk.

107
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:49,360
Tomato sauce - oh, you're in trouble.
It'll take a half-hour to clean that up.

108
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,090
And I look up on every aisle
so as everything is clean.

109
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:56,931
If I see something I pick it up,
whether it's paper or garbage.

110
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,432
One day I had the keys in my hand
and they went in there.

111
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,841
And I had to climb in there
to get the keys out.

112
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,112
It's a sad situation.

113
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:18,355
If there are golden years,
I can't find 'em, I'll tell you that.

114
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,059
She had a painkiller for her hip.

115
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,862
The girl said, "Frank, this is $ 213."
"What, for a painkiller?"

116
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,961
- I didn't take it.
- I backed off. I said, "I gotta come back."

117
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,735
What's in them? What's in these
new drugs that they distribute?

118
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,572
I don't believe you need
half of the things they tell you.

119
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,842
I have never taken medication now,
as I'm getting older.

120
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,247
I don't even like to take an aspirin.

121
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,479
I do like a little brandy.

122
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:58,358
I don't really know how this happened, but
the trunk came forward into the back seat.

123
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:03,391
<i>(man) Laura Burnham was in a head-on
collision that knocked her out cold.</i>

124
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:08,099
<i>Paramedics got her out of the car and into
an ambulance for a trip to the hospital.</i>

125
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,075
I get a bill from my insurance company

126
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,943
telling me that the ambulance ride
was not going to be paid for,

127
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,482
because it wasn't preapproved.

128
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,145
I don't know exactly when I was supposed
to preapprove it, you know?

129
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,351
Like after I gain consciousness in the car,
before I got in the ambulance?

130
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:31,021
I should have grabbed my cellphone
off the street and called in the ambulance?

131
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,930
I mean, it's just crazy.

132
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,731
<i>(woman) I applied for
HealthNet insurance for Jason.</i>

133
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,742
They rejected him
because of his height and weight.

134
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,041
Jason is six feet tall
and 130 pounds.

135
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,146
I applied for healthcare
through BlueCross BlueShield

136
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,850
and they told me
that my body mass index was too high.

137
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,054
I'm 5' 1 ",
I weigh 175 pounds.

138
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:11,169
<i>(man) I always thought health insurance
companies were there to help us.</i>

139
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,501
<i>So I posted a note on the internet.</i>

140
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,439
<i>Asking people if they had had
any similar stories</i>

141
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,672
<i>about problems
with their insurance company.</i>

142
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,879
<i>Within 24 hours.
I had over 3700 responses.</i>

143
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,318
<i>And by the end of the week.
Over 25.000 people</i>

144

<i>had sent me
their healthcare horror stories.</i>

145
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:38,356
<i>Some of them decided
not to wait for me to get back to them.</i>

146
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:43,994
<i>Like Doug Noe. Who took matters into

CIGNA.</i>

149
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,977
<i>Said they'd pay for an implant
in only one of her ears.</i>

150
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,107
<i>According to the letter they sent.</i>

151
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:02,018
<i>It's experimental
for her to hear in to ears.</i>

152
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,580
If a cochlear implant
is good for one ear,

153
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:09,651
it doesn't even make any sense that
it wouldn't be good for the second ear.

154
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,392
Especially when a child
is just starting to learn how to talk,

155
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,061
she has to learn
from both sides of her head.

156
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,904
<i>(Moore) That's when he sat down
to write CIGNA a letter.</i>

157
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,637
This is to CIGNA.
"Noted filmmaker Michael Moore

159
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:33,217
"I've sent information concerning CIGNA's
lack of caring for its policy holders."

160
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,686
"Has your CEO ever been
in a film before?"

161
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:43,460
<i>(Moore) Before he knew it. He received
a call on his voice mail from CIGNA.</i>

00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:46,322
There are certain pre-existing conditions,
basically industry-wide,

174
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,053
that will not be covered -

175
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:52,188
diabetes, heart disease,
certain forms of cancer.

176
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:56,894
If you have these conditions, you are likely
not going to get your health insurance.

177
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,461
<i>(Moore) How long is this list of conditions
that make you ineligible?</i>

178
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,839
It would be a really long list.
It would be a long list.

179
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,572
It could wrap around this house.

182
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:42,239
and they're like...

184
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:49,748
They were so happy that they were...
I took them through this application.

185
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:53,280
And the husband was late for work.

186
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,988
And the wife said to him,
"Don't worry, baby, it's gonna be OK."

187
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,121
"We have health insurance now."

188
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,326
And when I looked, I could tell
they were gonna get declined

189
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,837
because of their health conditions.
And they were so happy.

190
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,965
I thought, "God, they're gonna get
that call in a couple of weeks

191
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:13,603
telling them
that they're not eligible for insurance."

192
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,045
I just felt so bad
'cause I just really thought

193
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,380
and I knew
and I couldn't say anything to them.

194
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,843
I just felt like crap.

195
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,355
That's why I'm such a bitch
on the phone to people,

because I don't wanna
get to know them,

197
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,390
I don't wanna know about their lives,
I just wanna get in and out,

198
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:35,092
and get done with it
'cause I can't take the stress of it.

<i>And it's a good thing
that they're all fully covered.</i>

207
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,091
I ended up being diagnosed
with retroperitoneal cancer.

208
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,964
- Brain tumor.
- Breast cancer.

209
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,935
Brain tumor on the right temporal lobe.

210
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:16,668
<i>(Moore) As they were insured. They got the
red-carpet treatment at the doctor's office.</i>

211
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,769
She requested for me
to see a neurologist.

212
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,939
The way they would treat it
was to remove it.

213
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,880
Surgery was scheduled
for December 9.

214
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,350
There is a test that you can take

215
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,379
that will show whether or not
you would benefit from chemo.

216
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,861
<i>(Moore) They got their treatment. But not
before battling their insurance companies.</i>

217
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,955
Investigated whether or not
this was a preexisting condition.

218
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,863
"It's not medically necessary."

219
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,959
They claim that it's experimental.

220
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,334
"We don't consider that life-threatening."

221
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,806
<i>(Moore) Diane died
from her non life-threatening tumor.</i>

223
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:57,347
<i>Her "experimental test"
proved that Caroline needed chemo.</i>

224
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,647
<i>While vacationing in Japan.
Maria became ill</i>

225
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:06,248
<i>and got the MRI that BlueShield
of California had refused to approve.</i>

226
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,624
<i>The doctors in Japan
told her she had a brain tumor.</i>

227
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,662
<i>BlueShield had said repeatedly
she didn't have a tumor.</i>

228
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:18,931
<i>That's when she said:
"Well. I'm pretty sure I have a lawyer."</i>

<i>(man #3) March 13, 2003.</i>

Please describe for me what it is.

232
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:35,813
It is a denial for referral

<i>- (man #3) Is it your signature on this?

<i>(man #3) I'd like to direct your attention
to exhibit two.</i>

235
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,731
This is a denial
of a request for referral

236
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,530
for a magnetic resonance imaging test
of the brain.

237
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,627
<i>- (man #3) It has your signature?
- Yes.</i>

238
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:56,800
<i>(man #3) Directing your attention
to exhibit three. Please read this document.</i>

239
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:03,007
This is a denial of a referral
to a neurosurgeon.

240
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:08,987
<i>(man #3) Can you explain for me
how you came to sign the denial letter?</i>

241
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,989
This is a standard signature
put on all denial letters.

242
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,618
<i>- (man #3) Is it your signature or a stamp?
- That is a stamp.</i>

243
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:22,463
<i>(man #3) Did you ever see a denial letter
before your signature was stamped on it?</i>

244
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:27,028
No, but the denial letters
are fundamentally the same.

245
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,700
The denial letters that are sent out...

246
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,938
<i>- (man #3) The answer is no.
- No. All right.</i>

247
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:38,512
The definition of a good director was
somebody who saves the company money.

248
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,884
<i>(Moore) Dr. Linda Peeno
was a medical reviewer for Humana.</i>

249
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,119
<i>She left her job because she didn't like
their way of doing business.</i>

250
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:51,060
<i>(Dr. Peeno) I was told when I started
that I had to keep a 10% denial.</i>

251
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,931
Then they were giving us reports weekly
that would have all the cases we reviewed,

252
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,265
the percent approved
and the percent denied.

253
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,170
And our actual percentage denial rate.

254
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,802
Then there would be another report that
compared me to all the other reviewers.

255
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,439
The doctor with the highest percent
of denials was gonna get a bonus.

256
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,007
<i>(Moore) Really? So you, as a doctor,
working for the HMO,</i>

257
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,452
if you denied more people healthcare,
you got a bonus?

258
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,456
<i>(Dr. Peeno) That was how they set it up.</i>

259
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:22,756
Any payment for a claim
is referred to as a medical loss.

260
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,228
That's the terminology
the industry uses.

261
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,960
I mean, when you don't spend money
on somebody, you deny their care,

262
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:33,368
or you make a decision that brings
money in and you don't have to spend it,

263
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,929
it's a savings to the company.

264
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,311
<i>(Moore) This is Tarsha Harris.</i>

265
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,711
<i>BlueCross didn't deny her
her treatment.</i>

266
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,978
<i>And actually approved her operation.</i>

267
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:51,086
<i>But then they discovered
that in the distant past.</i>

268
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,387
<i>She had had a yeast infection.</i>

269
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:00,664
Apparently it's common.
Men, women can get a yeast infection.

270
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:07,262
So I was prescribed the yeast infection
cream, general cream, and it went away.

271
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,064
She later applied for health insurance

272
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:14,272
and that's what you're supposed
to be disclosing - serious ailments.

273
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:19,807
The yeast infection is not a serious ailment.
There was nothing she could have done.

274
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,480
It wasn't until they were gonna have
to spend money that they looked.

275
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,082
If they'd taken five minutes
and wanted to clear up the yeast infection,

276
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,185
they could've looked at her records
or talked to her doctor.

277
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,459
<i>(Moore) Because of the undisclosed
yeast infection.</i>

278
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,126
<i>BlueCross dropped Tarsha Harris.</i>

279
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:40,797
She thinks she's put this behind her.
And then BlueCross changes their mind,

280
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:45,707
tells the doctors, "We're taking the money
back, go get the money from Tarsha."

281
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:51,738
The fact of the matter is
it was a yeast infection, that's all it was.

282
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,412
I'm still a little bitter because
I don't trust insurance companies now.

283
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:59,753
To me, it seems they're always
gonna be looking for a way out.

284
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,293
What happened to helping
the person that's sick?

285
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,057
Don't make their problems worse.

286
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,930
<i>(Moore) This is Lee Einer.</i>

287
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,903
<i>If they weren't able to weed you out
in the application process.</i>

288
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,372
<i>Or deny you the care
your doctor said you needed.</i>

289
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,933
<i>And somehow ended up
paying for the operation.</i>

290
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,906
<i>They send in Lee. Their hitman.</i>

291
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:28,851
<i>His job is to get the company's money
back any way he can.</i>

292
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,220
<i>All he has to do
is find one slip-up on your application.</i>

293
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,126
<i>Or a preexisting condition
you didn't know you had.</i>

294
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,926
We're gonna go after this
like it's a murder case.

295
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,559
And I mean the whole unit dedicated to

296
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,571
going through your health history
for the last five years,

297
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,369
looking for anything that would indicate

298
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,173
that you concealed something,
you misrepresented something,

299
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,976
so that they can cancel the policy

300
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,485
or jack the rates so high
that you can't pay them.

301
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,817
And if we couldn't find anything
you didn't disclose on the application,

302
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,850
you can still get hit
with a preexisting denial,

303
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,591
because you don't even have to have
sought medical treatment for it.

304
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:18,568
In some states, it's legal to have
a prudent person preexisting condition.

305
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,662
And that's a mouthful, I know,

306
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,937
but what that says is
if prior to your insurance kicking in,

307
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,812
you had any symptom which would incline
a normally prudent person

308
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,851
to have sought medical care,

309
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,085
then the condition of which that symptom
was a symptom is excluded.

310
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,193
I know!

311
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,695
It's labyrinthine, isn't it?
But that's how it works.

312
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,327
They're supposed to be even-handed,

313
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,999
but with an insurance company,
it's their frigging money!

314
00:22:56,074 --> 00:23:00,511
So it's not unintentional,
it's not a mistake,

315
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,481
it's not an oversight,
you're not slipping through the cracks.

316
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:09,179
Somebody made that crack
and swept you towards it.

317
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:12,883
And the intent
is to maximize profits.

318
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,256
Looking back,
I don't know that I killed anybody.

319
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,854
Did I do harm in people's lives?

320
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,593
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

321
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,202
I haven't worked for insurance companies
for a long time,

322
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:32,539
and I don't think
that really serves to atone

323
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:36,775
for my participation in that mess.

324
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,841
I am glad I'm out of it, though.

325
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:48,187
<i>(Moore) Julie Pierce was struggling
to get care for her husband Tracy.</i>

326
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,627
<i>Who was suffering
from kidney cancer.</i>

327
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,530
<i>Julie works in the intensive care unit
at St. Joseph's Medical Center</i>

328
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,864
<i>in Kansas City. Missouri.</i>

329
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,871
<i>Which provided her family
with health insurance.</i>

330
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,500
Every month, there was a new drug
that the doctor wanted to try.

331
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:09,878
My insurance denied it. One letter
might say, "not a medical necessity,"

332
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:15,011
one letter might say, "it's not
for this particular type of cancer,"

333
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,611
and they denied it.

334
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,989
Then we came up with the bone marrow.
It has showed to stop it,

335
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,496
sometimes to completely get rid of it.

336
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:29,261
<i>(Moore) Tracy's doctors said
this treatment had been successfully tried</i>

337
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,666
<i>on many other patients.</i>

338
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,204
<i>If one of Tracy's brothers turned out
to be a suitable donor.</i>

339
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:42,645
<i>There were promising bone marrow
treatments for beating Tracy's cancer.</i>

340
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:46,741
Two weeks later, the bone marrow
nurse at KU called me and she goes:

341
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:51,778
"We've got the results back. His youngest
brother is a perfect donor match."

342
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,984
We were ecstatic.

343
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,291
You know, I think that's the happiest
I had seen him...

344
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,157
in a while.

345
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:07,604
So we submitted it
and they denied it.

346
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,697
Said it was "experimental."

347
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:15,103
So I found out that there is
a board of trustees over our medical plan

348
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,171
that actually work at my hospital.

349
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:22,687
And they are the final decision-makers
on what gets approved and what doesn't.

350
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:26,121
<i>(Moore) Julie and her husband
and their son. Tracy Junior.</i>

351
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,718
<i>Demanded a meeting
with the health plan's board of trustees.</i>

352
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:33,730
<i>The very people
who had the power to approve their claim.</i>

353
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,825
<i>They told Julie that they were
sympathetic to her situation.</i>

354
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,862
I said, "Your sympathy does me no good
when I'm burying him next year."

355
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:47,640
And I told them, I said if I was...
Bruce van Cleve was our CEO.

356
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:53,810
I said, "I bet if it was Bruce van Cleve's
wife, it would get approved."

357
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,012
"No, it's nothing like that."

358
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,749
I said, "Or maybe
if my husband was white."

359
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,223
And I got up
and walked out of the room.

360
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,760
When we got home,
I found him up in the bathroom.

361
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:12,235
And I knocked on the door and said,
"What are you doing in there?" "Nothing."

362
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:16,764
I opened the door 'cause usually he'll say:
"What do you think I'm doing in here?"

363
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:20,538
And he was sitting in there
and he was crying.

364
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:25,241
And he said, "Why me?
I'm a good person."

365
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:29,275
And I said,
"But we're not done fighting this."

366
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:33,814
"We're strong, yeah."
And then he said...

367
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:37,726
You know, he goes,
"I can see now that I'm gonna die."

368
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:43,928
He said, "I can leave everything,
but I don't want to leave you and Tracy."

369
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,935
The doctor told me
he would die in three weeks.

370
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,001
And...

371
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,846
On January 13th,
which was my birthday,

372
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,709
he went to sleep.

373
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:06,315
And he died five days later,
here at home.

374
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,117
He was my best friend.

375
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:14,830
He was my soul mate.
He was my son's father.

376
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,729
I mean, we were to grow old together.

377
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,473
They took away
everything that matters.

378
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:30,008
I wanna know why,
why my husband?

379
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,780
Why wasn't he given
the chance to live?

380
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:40,590
You preach these vision and values that
we care for the sick, the dying, the poor.

381
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,493
That we're a healthcare
that leaves no one behind.

382
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:48,726
You left him behind.
You didn't even give him a start.

383
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,029
It was as if he was nothing.

384
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,201
And I want them
to have a conscience about it.

385
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:01,610
And I don't think they do.
I don't think it has fazed them one bit.

386
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,272
At all.

387
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,514
<i>(Moore) There was one person
in the healthcare industry</i>

388
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,681
<i>who did have a conscience.</i>

389
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:17,854
<i>Dr. Linda Peeno.
A former medical reviewer at Humana.</i>

390
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,419
My name is Linda Peeno.

391
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:24,333
I am here today
to make a public confession.

392
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:28,805
In the spring of 1987,
as a physician,

393
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,104
I denied a man
a necessary operation

394
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:36,705
that would have saved his life,
and thus caused his death.

395
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:41,077
No person and no group
has held me accountable for this,

396
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:47,819
because, in fact, what I did was I saved
the company a half a million dollars for this.

397
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,419
And, furthermore, this particular act
secured my reputation

398
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,964
as a good medical director,

399
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:58,093
and it insured my continued advancement
in the healthcare field.

400
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,162
I went from making a few hundred dollars
a week as a medical reviewer

401
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,371
to an escalating six-figure income
as a physician executive.

402
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:13,213
In all my work, I had one primary duty,
and that was to use my medical expertise

403
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:17,721
for the financial benefit
of the organization for which I worked.

404
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,316
And I was told repeatedly
that I was not denying care,

405
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,758
I was simply denying payment.

406
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,093
I know how managed care
maims and kills patients.

407
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,931
So I'm here to tell you
about the dirty work of managed care.

408
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,596
And I'm haunted by the thousands
of pieces of paper

409
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,902
on which I have written
that deadly word - "denied."

410
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,272
Thank you.

411

I want America to have
the finest healthcare in the world,

420

to have that care when he needs it.

<i>(Moore) Sassy.</i>

436
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,571
<i>Smart.</i>

437
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,576
<i>Sexy.</i>

438
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,957
<i>Some men couldn't handle it.</i>

439
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,158
Today I am announcing the formation

440
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,528
of the President's Task Force
on National Health Reform,

441
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,625
chaired by the First Lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

442
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:56,970
<i>(Moore) Hillary Clinton decided to make
healthcare for everyone her top priority.</i>

443
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,874
Universal coverage now.

444
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,674
It will not depend upon
where you work, whether you work,

445
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,715
or if you have a pre-existing condition.

446
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,717
Healthcare that can never
be taken away.

447
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:12,449
<i>(reporter #3) Some Republicans complain
Mrs. Clinton is getting a free ride.</i>

448
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,788
It's fairly risky business
what President Clinton did,

449
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,455
to put his wife in charge of
some big policy program.

450
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,727
And while I don't share the chairman's joy
at our holding hearings

451
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,327
on a government-run healthcare system,

452
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:30,170
I do share his intention to make the debate
and the legislative process

453
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:35,076
- as exciting as possible.
- I'm sure you will do that, Mr. Armey.

454
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:39,981
- We'll do the best we can.
- You and Dr. Kevorkian, I think.

455
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:49,549
I have been told about your charm
and wit, and let me say...

456
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,721
Reports on your charm are overstated

457
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:57,029
- and reports on your wit are understated.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

458
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,603
<i>(Moore) She drove Washington insane.</i>

459
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,367
Do you want the government
to control your healthcare?

460
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,739
You won't have the choice
of your own doctors.

461
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,710
- Less government.
- More control.

462
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,373
- More government.
- Less control for you and your family.

463
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:14,612
When your mama gets sick, she might talk
to a bureaucrat instead of a doctor.

464
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,779
This is a total mess,
and it's about to get messier.

465
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,790
Not this bureaucratic,
socialistic plan that they have.

466
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,349
- Socialist takeover...
- Socialized medicine.

467
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:27,728
What really amounts to
a giant social experiment.

468
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,397
<i>(Moore) Ooh!
Socialized medicine.</i>

469
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,839
<i>Nothing put more fear in us
than the thought of that.</i>

470
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,400
<i>And the chief fearmongers
against socialized medicine</i>

471
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,140
<i>have always been the good doctors</i>

472
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,205
<i>of the American Medical Association.</i>

473
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,480
<i>(man #4) This would put the government
smack into your hospital,</i>

474
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,852
defining services, setting standards,

475
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,188
establishing committees, calling for reports,

476
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,625
deciding who gets in and who gets out.

477
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,791
After all, the government has to treat
everyone fair and equal, don't you know?

478
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:06,803
Take us all the way down the road to
a new system of medicine for everybody.

479
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,806
<i>(Moore) Yes. Medicine for everyone.</i>

480
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,138
<i>The AMA didn't want that.</i>

481
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,408
<i>And to drive the point home further.</i>

482
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,075
<i>They held thousands of coffeeklatsches
all over the country.</i>

483
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,450
<i>Where they invited their neighbors
to come and listen to a record</i>

484
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:28,618
<i>made by a well-known actor
on the evils of socialized medicine.</i>

485
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,786
<i>My name is Ronald Reagan.</i>

486
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:35,629
<i>One of the traditional methods of imposing
statism or socialism on a people.</i>

487
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,498
<i>Has been by way of medicine.</i>

488
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:43,199
<i>The doctor begins to lose freedoms. It's
like telling a lie. And one leads to another.</i>

489
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,266
<i>A doctor decides he wants
to practice in one town.</i>

490
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,177
<i>The government says to him.
"You can't live in that town.</i>

491
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:53,149
<i>They already have enough doctors.
You have to go someplace else. "</i>

492
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,812
<i>All of us can see what happens
once you establish the precedent</i>

493
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:02,758
<i>that the government can determine
a man's working place and his methods.</i>

494
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,261
<i>And behind it will come
other federal programs</i>

495
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,095
<i>that will invade every area of freedom
as we have known it in this country.</i>

496
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:14,104
<i>Until one day. We will awake
to find that we have socialism.</i>

497
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,806
<i>(reporter #4) The White House
said to tone down the rhetoric.</i>

498
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,278
<i>Reacting to burning an effigy
of Hillary Clinton.</i>

499
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,613
<i>(Moore) The times may have changed.
But the scare tactics hadn't.</i>

500
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,950
<i>The healthcare industries spent
over a hundred million dollars</i>

501
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:35,823
<i>to defeat Hillary's healthcare plan.
And they succeeded.</i>

502
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,192
And I want now
to introduce to you the president,

503
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:42,494
because he loves the Easter egg roll.

504
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,229
<i>(Moore) For the next seven years
in the White House.</i>

505
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,533
<i>She wasn't allowed to bring it up again.</i>

506
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,539
Is anybody here older than two?

507
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,007
<i>(Moore) A decade and a half went by.</i>

508
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,375
<i>And still America
had no universal health plan.</i>

509
00:36:55,947 --> 00:37:00,350
<i>The United States slipped to number 37
in healthcare around the world.</i>

510
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,285
<i>Just slightly ahead of Slovenia.</i>

511
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,345
<i>(men speaking Slovenian)</i>

512
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:13,328
<i>But that's understandable. Because
Congress was busy with other matters.</i>

513
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,991
Mr. Speaker, today I rise
to offer congratulations

514
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,934
to the confectioners
at Just Born Incorporated,

515
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,233
as they celebrate the 50th anniversary

516
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,240
of one of their most recognized
and celebrated products,

517
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,334
not to mention my daughter's favorite,
Marshmallow Peeps.

518
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,982
<i>(Moore) And thus. The healthcare industry
went unchecked into the 21st century.</i>

519
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,612
Humana more than doubles its fourth
quarter profit, lifts its earning for the year...

520
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,883
United Health has tripled
its share prices.

521
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,653
<i>(Moore) Making obscene profits...</i>

522
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,558
...better-than-expected earnings.

523
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,223
There's a lot of
wealthy shareholders out there.

524
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,562
Are they willing to share
some of that wealth?

525
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:53,092
<i>(Moore)... turning their CEOs
into billionaires.</i>

526
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,366
<i>And skirting the law
whenever they wanted.</i>

527
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:03,169
<i>But their biggest accomplishment
was buying our United States Congress.</i>

528
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:07,980
<i>(man #5) This is Washington at work.
Lobbying has become so brazen...</i>

529
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,078
<i>(Moore) With four times
as many healthcare lobbyists</i>

530
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,248
<i>than there are members of Congress.</i>

531
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,293
<i>They even managed to buy off old foes.</i>

532
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,927
<i>For her silence.
Hillary was rewarded.</i>

533
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,558
<i>And she became the second largest
recipient in the Senate</i>

534
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,967
<i>of healthcare industry contributions.</i>

535
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:35,642
We've given the entire healthcare system
over to the insurance industry.

536
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:40,343
<i>- And they have total control.
- (Moore) Well. Not total control.</i>

537
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:44,718
<i>Drug companies like to buy
their members of Congress too.</i>

538
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,156
<i>Here's what it costs
to buy these men.</i>

539
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,216
<i>And this woman.</i>

540
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,156
<i>This guy.</i>

541
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,722
<i>And this guy. And him too.</i>

542
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:03,064
<i>(man #6) Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.</i>

543
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,543
<i>(Moore) And the biggest check
was saved for last.</i>

544
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,273
<i>Why did they hand out all this cash?</i>

545
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:15,809
<i>They wanted a bill passed - a bill
to help seniors with their prescriptions.</i>

546
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,116
Let there be no mistake about it.

547
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,681
Republicans love their mothers,
their fathers and their grandparents

548
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:26,992
as much as anybody else on this hill,
and we're gonna take care of them.

549
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:32,161
<i>(Moore) Of course. It was really a bill
to hand over 800 billion of our tax dollars</i>

550
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,500
<i>to the drug and health insurance industry.</i>

551
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:38,201
<i>By letting the drug companies
charge whatever they wanted.</i>

552
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,506
<i>And making the private health insurance
companies the middleman.</i>

553
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,514
<i>Everybody was going to get their cut.</i>

554
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,244
<i>The man they appointed
to get the job done</i>

555
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,912
<i>was congressman Billy Tauzin.</i>

556
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:55,220
<i>He was the right man for the job
because he had a secret weapon.</i>

557
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:59,456
There's no one in this house loves
their mother more than I love my mother.

558
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,963
I challenge you on that, sir.

559
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:06,162
Nobody in this body that loves their mother
any more or any less than any one of us.

560
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,462
I love that woman.

561
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,633
Do you think for a second
you love your moms and dads

562
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,677
any more than we love ours?

563
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,305
Do you think Republicans
and Democrats who will vote...

564
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:21,078
Do you really believe that, Mr. Stoddard?
God bless you.

565
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,280
<i>(Moore) Oh. They all loved their mothers.</i>

566
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:28,553
<i>It's just that they didn't
love our mothers as much.</i>

567
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:34,929
Now I'm honored and pleased
to sign this historic piece of legislation -

568
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,992
the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act

569
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,060
of 2003.

570
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,837
<i>(Moore) What they didn't tell us was
that the elderly could end up paying more</i>

571
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,778
<i>for their prescriptions than they did before.</i>

572
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:56,275
<i>Over to thirds of senior citizens
could still pay over $2,000 a year.</i>

573
00:40:56,353 --> 00:41:01,313
<i>And when it was over, 14 congressional
aids who worked on the bill</i>

574
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:07,297
<i>quit their jobs on the Hill and went
to work for the healthcare industry.</i>

575
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,662
<i>As did one congressman.</i>

576
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,760
<i># 'Cause I've got a golden ticket...</i>

577
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,275
<i>(Moore) Billy Tauzin left Congress
to become the CEO of PhRMA.</i>

578
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,367
<i>The drug industry lobby.</i>

579
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,072
<i>For a salary of $2 million a year.</i>

580
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,881
<i>Oh. It was a happy day in Washington.</i>

581
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:34,914
<i>Many Americans knew they were never
going to see universal healthcare.</i>

582
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:40,225
<i>And that's why some of them
decided to look elsewhere for help.</i>

583
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,870
<i>(woman #3) We're driving across
the Detroit river.</i>

584
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:51,237
Back there is the Renaissance Center,
you can see it.

585
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:55,642
General Motors' headquarters,
downtown Detroit, the skyline.

586
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:58,944
You get a really nice view
from driving over the bridge.

587
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,383
<i>(Moore) This is Adrian Campbell.
A single mother.</i>

588
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:06,583
<i>Who at the age of 22
came down with cancer.</i>

589
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:11,026
<i>(Adrian) I got cervical cancer and I was
denied through the insurance company.</i>

590
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:15,191
They said, "We're not paying for it
because you're 22 and you don't have..."

591
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,895
"You shouldn't be having cervical cancer.
You're too young."

592
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,427
<i>(Moore) Forced into debt.
But now cancer free.</i>

593
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,669
<i>Adrian was fed up
with the American healthcare system.</i>

594
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,768
<i>She had a new plan.</i>

595
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,609
I have everything ready
before I even hit the border.

596
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,617
I got my passports ready,
I got my money out.

597
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,950
It's three dollars and 25 cents
to get across one way.

598
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:43,756
And I got everything just sitting
up here on my visor just ready to go.

599
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,322
Aurora, be very quiet.

600
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,866
- Citizenships?
- US.

601
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,635
- Where do you live?
- Michigan.

602
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,040
- That's not on, right?
- No.

603
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,412
<i>(Moore) She may live in Michigan.</i>

604
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,146
<i>But ten blocks across the border.
Adrian becomes a Canadian.</i>

605
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,052
How long have you been living here?
Three months?

606
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:16,491
A couple.
I haven't applied for the OHIP card yet.

607
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,051
- I still have mine.
- It takes ten minutes.

608
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,621
That's fine, I don't mind.
OK, thank you.

609
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,260
I put down Kyle's address at the clinic,

610
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,134
and when they ask, you know,
what my relationship is,

611
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:32,301
I put down that I was
his common-law partner.

612
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,435
I don't like to lie and I don't like liars.

613
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:40,416
It's little white lies, but it's...
You know, I'm saving the money.

614
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:45,820
You don't bring a checkbook when you
go to the hospital here. It's provided to us.

615
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:50,053
It's something you don't have to worry
about or go out of your way to get.

616
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,788
Stress free.

617
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,565
<i>- They called the cops.
- (Moore) The presence of our camera</i>

618
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,696
<i>alerted the clinic
that something was up.</i>

619
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,172
And I don't think
I'm gonna get seen now.

620
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,766
So I have another idea.

621
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,870
I'm gonna go down to the other clinic.

622
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:13,678
There is a clinic down...
one that we passed.

623
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,812
The police showed up over there.
Look.

624
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,759
<i>(Moore) Yes. What Adrian was doing
was illegal. But we're Americans.</i>

625
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,489
<i>We go into other countries
when we need to.</i>

626
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,860
<i>It's tricky. But it's allowed.</i>

627
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,733
<i>(Kyle) It's kind of frustrating having...
I mean...</i>

628
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:39,003
Just get married and that'd solve
everything - she'd be covered.

629
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,842
Americans marry Canadians
just for the healthcare!

630
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:46,371
<i>- I'm being used.
- (Moore) Sounds like a good idea.</i>

631
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,477
See if it works.
Start something. Start a trend.

632
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,955
In Canada they give everybody
free healthcare.

633
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,858
- Doesn't it work up there?
- No, unfortunately it doesn't.

634
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:01,523
We wait months to get treatment
you can get in a week or a few days here.

635
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:06,262
<i>(reporter # 5) In Canada you have to wait
nine to ten months for bypass surgery.</i>

636
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:11,364
<i>(reporter #6) Many Canadians believe
it's the healthcare system itself that's sick.</i>

637
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,342
<i>(reporter #7) They pay their doctors less.</i>

638
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,846
<i>(reporter #8) A surgeon can only do
a certain number of operations each year.</i>

639
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,678
<i>With only so many
expensive new pieces of equipment.</i>

640
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,914
It's easier for your cat or dog
to receive an MRI here in America.

641
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:28,447
You die of cancer waiting for chemo 'cause
all of Ottawa has one chemo machine.

642
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:32,985
If you think socialized medicine
is a good idea, ask a Canadian.

643
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:40,526
<i>(Moore) I thought who better to ask than
my Canadian relatives. Bob and Estelle.</i>

644
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:43,903
<i>But they wouldn't cross the border
into America.</i>

645
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:47,705
<i>They wanted me to meet them
at Sears. In Canada.</i>

646
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:51,077
What are you guys doing here?

647
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:55,414
- We're buying insurance.
- We're going to the States to see you.

648
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,477
Right, that's just across the river.

649
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,112
Yeah.

650
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:03,489
You wouldn't go over to see us in Michigan
for a couple of hours without insurance?

651
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,963
No, we wouldn't. We're just adamant
about it. We would not do it.

652
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:12,297
If somebody punches us in the mouth
or something, something like that...

653
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,736
You don't want to get caught
in the American health system thing?

654
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:21,073
We have nothing against Americans
or America, or anything like that at all.

655
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:27,641
<i>- (Moore) We're a nice and simple people.
- Not very simple, but certainly very nice.</i>

656
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,620
<i>(Moore) I decided to explore
their anti-American views further.</i>

657
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,987
<i>Over some fine Canadian cuisine.</i>

658
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:38,789
We have a friend who went to Hawaii.

659
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:43,094
And he sustained a head injury
while he was there.

660
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,931
And before he was
well enough to come home,

661
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:50,030
he had chalked up a bill
of over $600,000.

662
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:55,675
So what middle-class Canadian
could absorb that?

663
00:46:55,746 --> 00:47:00,115
<i>(Moore) I guess I feel bad that you would
have to worry about something like that.</i>

664
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:04,177
We're not criticizing your country,
we're just giving you the facts,

665
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:08,884
that we could not afford
to be without insurance.

666
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:12,520
<i>- (Moore) Even for a day?
- Even for a day.</i>

667
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:17,756
<i>(Moore) To prove their point even further.
They sent me over to a local golf course</i>

668
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:23,899
<i>to talk to Larry Godfrey. Who had a golfing
accident while on vacation in Florida.</i>

669
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:28,877
I could hear a noise and feel a pain,
and the tendon snapped off this bone here

670
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,244
that holds the bicep in place.

671
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,876
So this bicep muscle was released,
like on an elastic,

672
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,386
and it ended up here on my chest.

673
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:40,685
- The muscle ended up in your chest?
- Right. Ended up here.

674
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,891
<i>(Moore) Like all good golfers.
Larry finished his round</i>

675
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,954
<i>before seeking medical attention.</i>

676
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,795
<i>That's when he got the bad news.</i>

677
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,496
I wasn't too worried as I had
out-of-country insurance,

678
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,529
but when he told me
it was 23 or 24,000, then I... .

679
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:01,044
<i>- (Moore) 24,000?
- Dollars, yes.</i>

680
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,877
So if you'd stayed in the United States,
this would have cost you $ 24,000?

681
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:09,442
Instead, you went back to Canada,
and Canada paid your total expenses?

682
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,010
- Everything.
- Paid for the operation. It cost you?

683
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,420
- Nothing.
- Zero.

684
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,958
Zero. Zero.

685
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:20,190
I'm wondering why you expect your fellow
Canadians, who don't have your problem,

686
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:25,361
why should they, through their tax dollars,
have to pay for a problem you have?

687
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:29,064
Because we would
do the same for them.

688
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:33,542
It's just the way it's always been
and it's the way we hope it'll always be.

689
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,340
Right, but if you
just had to pay for your problem,

690
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,144
and don't pay for everybody else's
problem, just take care of yourself?

691
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:43,948
Well, there are a lot of people who aren't
in a position to be able to do that.

692
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,581
And somebody has to look after them.

693
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,750
Are you a member of the Socialist Party?

694
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,293
- No. No.
- Green Party?

695
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:56,731
No. Well, actually, I'm a member
of the Conservative Party.

696
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,961
Is that bad?

697
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:03,328
- Well, it's just a little confusing.
- Well...

698
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,807
It shouldn't be. I think that...

699
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:09,209
Where medical matters are concerned,
it wouldn't matter in Canada

700
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:13,511
what party you were affiliated with, if any.

701
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,575
But, to us,
as we look across the river here,

702
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,247
you know, why don't you think
we don't believe that?

703
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:21,848
What's wrong on this issue with us?

704
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:28,057
I guess the powers that be
don't share our beliefs

705
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,497
that healthcare ought to be universal.

706
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:35,630
I mean, Canadians didn't until we met up
with a guy named Tommy Douglas,

707
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:39,836
who pretty much
changed everyone's mind.

708
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,676
- One guy?
- One guy, yeah. One guy did it, he...

709
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,716
- Can he come over and visit us?
- He's dead, unfortunately.

710
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,774
In fact, he was...

711
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:54,154
He's just most recently been revered as
Canada's singular most important person.

712
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:57,057
- We think so much of...
- You mean in your history?

713
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,061
In our whole history.

714
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,996
- More than your first prime minister?
- Absolutely, yeah.

715
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,556
Even more than Wayne Gretzky.

716
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,569
- No way!
- Absolutely. Yeah.

717
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:11,596
- More than Cline Dion?
- Great singer. More than Cline, yeah.

718
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,508
- More than Rocky and Bullwinkle?
- Maybe.

719
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,117
As the blade went through,
it caught the glove I was wearing

720
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:29,056
and it sliced through the entire group
of fingers, completely taking them off.

721
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:32,459
And I realized
that I needed help immediately.

722
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,694
<i>(man) Obviously, putting on
amputated fingers or arms or limbs</i>

723
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,962
is one of the more dramatic things
we can do.

724
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:43,166
If you're looking at five fingers,
you're looking at a 24-hour operation.

725
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,040
There actually was four surgeons,
as well as all the nurses

726
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:51,638
and two different anesthetists
to carry out an operation of that magnitude.

727
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:56,448
When Brad came in, we didn't have to
worry about whether he could afford it.

728
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,958
He needed help and we could concentrate
on the best way to bring him through it.

729
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:08,126
<i>(Moore) I met this American, he'd cut off
the ends of two of his fingers with a saw.</i>

730
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:13,795
So when he arrived at the hospital, they
told him one finger's gonna cost $60,000,

731
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,634
and the other one was gonna be $12,000.

732
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:20,039
He had to choose
which finger he could afford.

733
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,476
Down. Bend the long finger down.

734
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:26,710
<i>(surgeon) We've never told someone
that they couldn't put a finger back on</i>

735
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,774
because the system wouldn't allow it.

736
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:34,222
I'm very glad I work within a system that
allows me the freedom to look after people,

737
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,782
and not have to
make choices like that.

738
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,591
<i>(Moore) It seems nothing we were told
about the Canadian system was true.</i>

739
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,098
<i>Maybe I was just
in the wrong part of town.</i>

740
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:47,125
<i>So I went across the city
to a crowded hospital waiting room.</i>

741
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,468
How long did you have to wait here
to get help?

742
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,973
- 20 minutes.
- 45 minutes.

743
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,443
- I got helped right away.
- You can see how crowded this is.

744
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,003
They really do an amazing job.

745
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:01,278
<i>(Moore) Did you have to get permission
to come to this hospital?</i>

746
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,909
- No.
- No.

747
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,977
We can go anywhere we want.

748
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:08,991
<i>(Moore) You don't have to get it
preapproved by your insurance company?</i>

749
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,620
<i>- Oh, heavens, no.
- (Moore) Can you choose your doctor?</i>

750
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,994
<i>- Oh, yes.
- (Moore) What's your deductible?</i>

751
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,533
- Nothing.
- I don't think we have any.

752
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:21,264
I don't know.
I don't think there's any, as far as I know.

753
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,363
<i>- (Moore) So what did this cost?
- Nothing.</i>

754
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,136
We know in America
people pay for their healthcare,

755
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:31,010
but I guess we don't understand that,
'cause we don't have to deal with that.

756
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:34,573
And we're dealing with
Parkinson's, stroke, heart attack.

757
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,142
We're very, very lucky.
Really we are.

758
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,553
I mean, we complain.
People complain about everything, right?

759
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:45,357
<i>- (Moore) Right, you're Canadian.
- But on the whole, it's a fabulous system</i>

760
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:51,128
for making sure that the least of us
and the best of us are taken care of.

761
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:56,468
<i>(Moore) It turns out that Canadians
live three years longer than we do.</i>

762
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:02,342
<i>That's not hard to believe
when you meet fellow Americans like Erik.</i>

763
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:06,746
# Oh, England, here we go

764
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:13,455
<i>(Moore) Erik Turnbow of Olympia.
Washington. Saved up his whole life</i>

765
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:18,290
<i>so that he could visit the famed
Abbey Road crosswalk in London.</i>

766
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,695
<i>But it wasn't enough for Erik to just
walk across the road like The Beatles did.</i>

767
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,929
<i>He had to do it his own special way.</i>

768
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:32,205
<i>(man #7) Here's Erik, about to walk
on his hands across Abbey Road.</i>

769
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,134
Ready?

770
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,870
<i>- Ugh!
- (crack)</i>

771
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,474
<i>(man #7) Try it again.</i>

772
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,458
- Are you in pain?
- Yeah.

773
00:53:55,699 --> 00:54:01,365
<i>(Moore) The British hospital
didn't charge Erik anything for his stay.</i>

774
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:06,705
<i>And only about ten bucks
for all the way-cool drugs they gave him.</i>

775
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:10,678
<i>- (man #7) You're all slung up.
- I'm gonna be OK.</i>

776
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:19,687
<i>(Moore) I decided to go to Great Britain to
find out how a hospital stay could be free.</i>

777
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,089
<i>And drugs could cost only ten dollars.</i>

778
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:30,629
If I come in here and I have a prescription
and it requires 30 pills, how much is that?

779
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,498
It's 6.65.
That's the standard charge.

780
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,006
<i>(Moore) 6.65?
So that's what? Ten dollars or so?</i>

781
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,133
- Yes.
- What if I needed 60 pills, how much is it?

782
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,405
- Same charge.
- 120 pills?

783
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,913
- 6.65 still.
- It doesn't matter how many pills?

784
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:48,747
- No.
- What if it's an HIV drug or a cancer drug?

785
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,445
Still 6.65.

786
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:55,981
If they are under 16 or over 60,
they're automatically exempt.

787
00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:01,122
<i>(Moore) So only a working adult
who earns enough money pays the 6.65?</i>

788
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,324
Everybody else gets medication free?

789
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,028
- No money being exchanged here?
- No, nothing.

790
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,629
- There's no money being exchanged?
- I'm over 60. We don't pay.

791
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,970
What's the purpose
of the cash register?

792
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:19,444
I'm just wondering where's the bread
and the milk and the candy in here?

793
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:22,917
I can't pick up
any laundry detergent here?

794
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:27,980
No. I haven't been trained for that many
years to be selling detergents, so no.

795
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:45,806
<i>(Moore) I next went to a state-run hospital.
Operated by the National Health Service.</i>

796
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:51,110
<i>(woman # 4) I'm due in seven weeks
and I get six months off, paid.</i>

797
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:55,584
And then I can have six months off unpaid
as well, so I'm actually taking a year.

798
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,519
<i>(Moore) Well, that sounds
like a luxury where I'm from.</i>

799
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:03,685
Oh, really, it's not like that in the US?
No? Not at all, no?

800
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,526
<i>(Moore) So what do you pay
for a stay here?</i>

801
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,928
No one pays.

802
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,892
They were asking how do people pay.

803
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,403
I said there isn't...
You don't, you just leave.

804
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:19,966
It's national insurance.
There's no bill at the end of it, as it were.

805
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:26,245
<i>(Moore) Even with insurance.
There's bound to be a bill somewhere.</i>

806
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,877
- So where's the billing department?
- There isn't a billing department.

807
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,921
There's no such thing.

808
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,615
<i>(Moore) What did they charge
for that baby?</i>

809
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:37,717
- Sorry?
- You gotta pay before you can get out?

810
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:41,753
- No. This is NHS.
- No, no. Everything is on NHS.

811
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,322
You know, it's not America.

812
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:52,642
<i>(Moore) Maybe I'd have better luck in the
part where things get seriously expensive.</i>

813
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:57,078
This guy broke his ankle.
How much will this cost him?

814
00:56:57,147 --> 00:57:01,709
The emergency room visit. He'll have
some huge bill when he's done, right?

815
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:04,845
Here... NHS, everything is free.

816
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,220
<i>(Moore) I'm asking about hospital charges
and you're laughing.</i>

817
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:12,022
I was never asked this question
in the emergency department, that's why.

818
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:16,993
<i>(Moore) I was starting to fall
for this "everything is free" bit.</i>

819
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,057
<i>And then I discovered this.</i>

820
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:24,339
So this is where people come to pay
their bill when they're done staying here?

821
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,467
No, this is the NHS hospital,
so you don't pay the bill.

822
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,342
You get to just go home?

823
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:35,146
Why does it say "cashier" here
if people don't have to pay a bill?

824
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,812
What we have is a little man
who stands behind a counter

825
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,948
and he gives people money
if they've had to pay for transport.

826
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:46,086
Those who have reduced means
get their travel expenses reimbursed.

827
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:47,254
Thank you.

828
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:52,597
<i>(Moore) So in British hospitals. Instead
of money going into the cashier's window.</i>

829
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:54,227
<i>Money comes out.</i>

830
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,273
The criteria for letting you out
are not if you've paid,

831
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,673
the criteria are, are you fit to go
and are you going somewhere safe?

832
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,974
<i>(Moore) Clearly. I was just
the butt of a joke here.</i>

833
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:12,282
<i>What I needed
was a good old-fashioned American</i>

834
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,880
<i>who would have some understanding.</i>

835
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:18,519
<i>(woman #5) I first came to London in 1992.</i>

836
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:22,895
And we just ended up staying
and we had three children here.

837
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:28,268
Well, I had them all on the NHS, which is
the British National Health Service.

838
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:32,069
I think, like a lot of Americans,
assumed that a socialized medicine

839
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:35,110
was just bottom of the rung treatment,

840
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:39,171
that the only way would be horrible
and it would be like the Soviet Union.

841
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:41,217
I mean, that's kind of how...

842
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:45,778
<i>- And it's terrible that that's what I thought.
- (Moore) That's what I thought too.</i>

843
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,450
<i>After having a baby.
It's right back to the wheat fields.</i>

844
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,461
<i>(singing in Russian)</i>

845
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:17,180
<i>And then it occurred to me
that back home in America.</i>

846
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:20,154
<i>We've socialized a lot of things.</i>

847
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:50,652
<i>I kind of like having a police department
and fire department and the library.</i>

848
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:56,590
<i>And I got to wondering: why don't we
have more of these free, socialized things?</i>

849
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,149
<i>Like healthcare?</i>

850
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:03,130
When did this whole idea that every British
citizen should have a right to healthcare?

851
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,532
Well, if you go back,
it all began with democracy.

852
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:11,370
Before we had the vote all the power
was in the hands of rich people.

853
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,069
If you had money, you could get
healthcare, education,

854
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,043
look after yourself when you were old.

855
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:21,106
And what democracy did
was to give the poor the vote.

856
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:25,314
And it moved power from the marketplace
to the polling station.

857
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,948
From the wallet to the ballot.

858
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,083
And what people said was very simple.

859
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,255
They said, "In the 1930s,
we had mass unemployment."

860
01:00:34,317 --> 01:00:36,877
"But we don't have unemployment
during the war."

861
01:00:36,953 --> 01:00:39,285
"If you can have full employment
by killing Germans,

862
01:00:39,356 --> 01:00:44,055
why can't we have it by building hospitals and
schools, recruiting nurses and teachers?"

863
01:00:44,127 --> 01:00:49,463
If you can find money to kill people,
you can find money to help people.

864
01:00:49,532 --> 01:00:50,362
Right.

865
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:54,164
This leaflet that was issued
was very, very straightforward.

866
01:00:54,237 --> 01:00:56,933
- What year was this?
- This was 1948.

867
01:00:57,007 --> 01:01:00,170
"Your new National Health Service
begins on the 5th of July."

868
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:02,234
"What is it? How do you get it?"

869
01:01:02,312 --> 01:01:07,147
"It will provide you with all
medical, dental and nursing care."

870
01:01:07,217 --> 01:01:12,280
"Everyone, rich or poor, man, woman
or child, can use it or any part of it."

871
01:01:12,355 --> 01:01:15,552
"There are no charges,
except for a few special items."

872
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:19,721
"There is no insurance qualifications,
but it is not a charity."

873
01:01:19,796 --> 01:01:22,458
"You are paying for it
mainly as taxpayers,

874
01:01:22,532 --> 01:01:26,730
and it will relieve your money worries
in times of illness."

875
01:01:26,803 --> 01:01:30,762
Now, somehow,
the few words sum the whole thing up.

876
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:41,414
<i>(Moore) I was amazed
when he said this all started in 1948.</i>

877
01:01:41,918 --> 01:01:46,821
<i>The British had come out of a devastating
experience through World War II.</i>

878
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:50,155
<i>The country was destroyed
and nearly bankrupt.</i>

879
01:01:50,226 --> 01:01:52,751
<i>They had nothing.</i>

880
01:01:52,829 --> 01:01:55,491
<i>In just one eight-month period.</i>

881
01:01:55,565 --> 01:01:59,433
<i>Over 42,000 civilians lost their lives.</i>

882
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:03,501
<i>What we went through
in two hours on 9/11,</i>

883
01:02:03,573 --> 01:02:06,599
<i>they went through
nearly every single day.</i>

884
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:14,611
<i>Remember how we all felt after 9/11 ?
All of us pulling together?</i>

885
01:02:14,684 --> 01:02:17,118
<i>I guess that's how they felt.</i>

886
01:02:18,121 --> 01:02:21,579
<i>And the first way that they decided
to pull together after the war</i>

887
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:26,425
<i>was to provide free medical care
for everyone.</i>

888
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:31,934
Even Mrs. Thatcher said, "The National
Health Service is safe in our hands."

889
01:02:32,001 --> 01:02:34,799
It's as non-controversial
as votes for women.

890
01:02:34,871 --> 01:02:37,396
Nobody could say,
"Why should women have the vote?" now.

891
01:02:37,474 --> 01:02:40,068
People wouldn't have it,
they wouldn't in Britain.

892
01:02:40,143 --> 01:02:44,773
They wouldn't accept the deterioration or
destruction of the National Health Service.

893
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:48,443
If Thatcher or Blair said, "I'm going
to dismantle national healthcare..."

894
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:50,179
There would have been a revolution.

895
01:02:52,055 --> 01:02:56,082
<i>(# "Street Fighting Man"
by The Rolling Stones)</i>

896
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:05,157
<i>(reporter #9) A report from the AMA
into the health of 55- to 64-year-olds</i>

than Americans.</i>

898
01:03:08,171 --> 01:03:12,972
<i>(man #8) For every illness that we looked
at, Americans had more of it than English.</i>

899
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:16,671
<i>(reporter #9) Cancer. Heart disease.
Hypertension. Strokes. Lung disease.</i>

900
01:03:16,746 --> 01:03:19,408
<i>All significantly higher for Americans.</i>

901
01:03:19,482 --> 01:03:21,313
<i>Even the poorest people in England</i>

902
01:03:21,384 --> 01:03:25,650
<i>with all the environmental factors that give
them the worst health in the country</i>

903
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:31,024
can expect to live longer
than the wealthiest people in America.

904
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:42,003
<i>(Moore) I was wondering though:
what's it like for the doctors here in Britain?</i>

905
01:03:42,071 --> 01:03:45,700
<i>Who have to live
under this kind of state control?</i>

906
01:03:45,775 --> 01:03:47,436
And you're a family doctor?

907
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:50,843
Yeah, I suppose we'd call them GPs
or general practitioners here.

908
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:54,315
- Right, so you have a family practice?
- Yeah, it's an NHS practice.

909
01:03:54,384 --> 01:03:56,375
We have nine doctors in that practice.

910
01:03:56,452 --> 01:03:58,443
- Paid for by the government?
- Yeah.

911
01:03:58,521 --> 01:04:01,684
You work for the government?
You're a government-paid doctor.

912
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:04,886
A patient comes to you.
Before you treat them, do you have to call

913
01:04:04,961 --> 01:04:07,759
the government insurance company
before you treat them?

914
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:11,562
No, I don't deal with money at all
on an everyday basis.

915
01:04:11,634 --> 01:04:14,865
Have you ever had to say no to someone
who was sick and needed help?

916
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:18,237
- No, never.
- Have you heard of anyone

917
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:22,108
being in the hospital and being removed
because they couldn't pay their bill?

918
01:04:22,178 --> 01:04:24,738
No, never.
And I wouldn't want to work in that system.

919
01:04:24,814 --> 01:04:28,750
So working for the government,
you probably have to use public transport?

920
01:04:28,818 --> 01:04:31,810
No, I have a car that I use
and I drive to work.

921
01:04:31,888 --> 01:04:33,879
An old beater?

922
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:42,227
You live in a rough part of town?

923
01:04:42,298 --> 01:04:46,291
I live in a terrific part of town.
It's called Greenwich.

924
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:52,601
It's a lovely house.
It's a three-story house.

925
01:04:52,675 --> 01:04:55,405
<i>(Moore) How many other families
have to live with you?</i>

926
01:04:55,478 --> 01:05:00,472
There's four bedrooms for my wife
and my son. It's just the three of us there.

927
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:05,487
<i>- (Moore) How much did you pay for that?
- 550,000. Yes, almost.</i>

928
01:05:05,555 --> 01:05:07,546
<i>(Moore) So, a million dollars?</i>

929
01:05:07,624 --> 01:05:12,721
You're a government-paid doctor on a
national health insurance healthcare plan,

930
01:05:12,795 --> 01:05:15,787
- and you live in a million-dollar home?
- Yes.

931
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:24,363
- I think my friends think we do quite well.
- Really? How well do you do?

932
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,204
I earn around 85,000,
including pension.

933
01:05:27,277 --> 01:05:29,745
- 85,000 pounds?
- 85,000 a year.

934
01:05:29,812 --> 01:05:32,610
And that includes pension
that they would pay in to me.

935
01:05:32,682 --> 01:05:35,651
They probably earn just
over 100,000 within my practice.

936
01:05:35,718 --> 01:05:39,745
- 100,000? So that's almost $200,000?
- Yes, absolutely.

937
01:05:39,822 --> 01:05:42,791
The money that we earn,
we get paid by what we do.

938
01:05:42,859 --> 01:05:46,727
So the better we do for our patients,
then the more we get paid.

939
01:05:46,796 --> 01:05:49,924
- What do you mean?
- There's a new system.

940
01:05:49,999 --> 01:05:54,527
And in that new system, if the most number
of your patients have low blood pressures,

941
01:05:54,604 --> 01:05:57,038
or you get most of your patients
to stop smoking,

942
01:05:57,106 --> 01:06:00,906
or you get your patients to have
mental health reviews if they're unwell,

943
01:06:00,977 --> 01:06:03,445
or low cholesterols,
then you get paid more.

944
01:06:03,513 --> 01:06:07,609
This year, if you get more people
that are your patients to stop smoking,

945
01:06:07,684 --> 01:06:09,845
you'll get more money,
you'll earn more?

946
01:06:09,919 --> 01:06:11,284
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

947
01:06:11,354 --> 01:06:18,055
So doctors in America do not have to fear
having a universal healthcare?

948
01:06:18,127 --> 01:06:22,587
No. I think if you want to have
two or three million-dollar homes

949
01:06:22,665 --> 01:06:26,431
and four or five nice cars
and six or seven nice televisions,

950
01:06:26,502 --> 01:06:30,336
then maybe, yeah, you need to practice
somewhere where you can earn that.

951
01:06:30,406 --> 01:06:32,567
But I think we live comfortably here.

952
01:06:32,642 --> 01:06:35,475
London is expensive,
but I think we live comfortably.

953
01:06:35,545 --> 01:06:39,914
You're getting by OK on the million-dollar
home, the Audi, and the flat-screen TV?

954
01:06:39,983 --> 01:06:42,577
Yeah, we're coping with those.

955
01:06:43,753 --> 01:06:46,813
I think democracy is the most
revolutionary thing in the world.

956
01:06:46,889 --> 01:06:50,347
Far more revolutionary than
socialist ideas, or anybody else's idea.

957
01:06:50,426 --> 01:06:56,092
Because if you have power, you use it
to meet the needs of your community.

958
01:06:56,165 --> 01:07:00,761
And this idea of choice which capital
talks about, "you've got to have a choice,"

959
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:02,964
choice depends
on the freedom to choose.

960
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,202
If you're shackled with debt,
you don't have a freedom to choose.

961
01:07:06,275 --> 01:07:10,974
<i>(Moore) It seems it benefits the system if
the average person is shackled with debt.</i>

962
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:14,915
People in debt become hopeless,
and hopeless people don't vote.

963
01:07:14,984 --> 01:07:16,975
They always say
everyone should vote,

964
01:07:17,053 --> 01:07:21,046
but I think if the poor in Britain
or the United States

965
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:24,025
voted for people
who represented their interests,

966
01:07:24,093 --> 01:07:26,789
it would be a real democratic revolution.

967
01:07:26,863 --> 01:07:30,822
So they don't want it to happen. So keeping
people hopeless and pessimistic...

968
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:34,700
See, I think there are two ways
in which people are controlled.

969
01:07:34,771 --> 01:07:39,003
First of all, frighten people,
and secondly, demoralize them.

970
01:07:39,075 --> 01:07:42,841
An educated, healthy and confident
nation is harder to govern.

971
01:07:42,912 --> 01:07:46,211
And I think there's an element
in the thinking of some people:

972
01:07:46,282 --> 01:07:50,048
"We don't want people to be
educated, healthy and confident,

973
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:52,917
because they would get out of control."

974
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:57,119
The top 1 % of the world's population
own 80% of the world's wealth.

975
01:07:57,193 --> 01:08:01,186
It's incredible that people put up with it,
but they're poor,

976
01:08:01,264 --> 01:08:03,732
they're demoralized, they're frightened.

977
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,667
And therefore, they think
perhaps the safest thing to do

978
01:08:06,736 --> 01:08:09,569
is to take orders and hope for the best.

979
01:08:13,876 --> 01:08:16,208
<i>(Moore) And hope for the best
is what we do.</i>

980
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:18,873
<i>Right from the moment we're born.</i>

981
01:08:18,948 --> 01:08:22,714
<i>We've got the worst infant mortality rate
in the western world.</i>

982
01:08:22,785 --> 01:08:25,777
<i>A baby born in El Salvador
has a better chance of surviving</i>

983
01:08:25,855 --> 01:08:27,880
<i>than a baby born in Detroit.</i>

984
01:08:27,957 --> 01:08:30,551
<i>But it gets better
when we go to school.</i>

985
01:08:30,626 --> 01:08:33,652
<i>(man #9) Classrooms with 40 students.
Schools with no labs.</i>

986
01:08:33,729 --> 01:08:37,221
<i>(Moore) No wonder the majority
of our adults can't find Britain on a map.</i>

987
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,768
<i>But that's OK.
There's always college.</i>

988
01:08:39,836 --> 01:08:42,304
<i>By the time we graduate.
Our ass is so in hock.</i>

989
01:08:42,371 --> 01:08:45,067
<i>We're in debt before our first job.</i>

990
01:08:45,141 --> 01:08:50,443
I'm at about... we'll say about $35,000
in debt. That's for my third year in college.

991
01:08:50,513 --> 01:08:54,449
<i>(Moore) You'll be the employee they're
looking for - one who needs this job.</i>

992
01:08:54,517 --> 01:08:57,350
3,904, 3,905...

993
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:00,787
<i>What employer wouldn't employ someone
thousands of dollars in debt.</i>

994
01:09:00,857 --> 01:09:04,088
<i>Because they won't cause any trouble?</i>

995
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:08,529
<i>In addition to paying off your college debt.
You need a job with health insurance.</i>

996
01:09:08,598 --> 01:09:11,123
<i>It would be horrible
to lose that job. Wouldn't it?</i>

997
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,762
You can always quit, you know. There's
no law that says you have to work here.

998
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:18,932
<i>(Moore) If that one job
doesn't pay all the bills. Don't worry.</i>

999
01:09:19,008 --> 01:09:22,876
<i>You can get another one.
And another one. And another one.</i>

1000
01:09:22,945 --> 01:09:26,540
I work three jobs,
and I feel like I contribute.

1001
01:09:26,616 --> 01:09:29,244
- You work three jobs?
- Three jobs, yes.

1002
01:09:29,318 --> 01:09:33,846
Uniquely American, isn't it? I mean,
that is fantastic that you're doing that.

1003
01:09:34,924 --> 01:09:36,016
Get any sleep?

1004
01:09:36,092 --> 01:09:39,061
<i>(Moore) If you're not sleeping.
Take pharmaceuticals.</i>

1005
01:09:39,128 --> 01:09:41,619
<i>(man #10) You're tired all the time.
You feel sad.</i>

1006

1009
01:09:48,738 --> 01:09:51,502
<i>- (woman #11) Ask your doctor.
- (man #11) Ask your doctor.</i>

1010
01:09:51,574 --> 01:09:55,135
<i>(Moore) Yes. Ask your doctor.
And ask him for more drugs.</i>

1011
01:09:55,211 --> 01:09:58,078
<i>That should keep you doped up
until it's time to retire.</i>

1012
01:09:58,147 --> 01:10:00,479
<i>Did I say retire? (laughs)</i>

1013
01:10:01,384 --> 01:10:04,080
<i>If you make it to 80.
Your pension will still be there.</i>

1014
01:10:04,153 --> 01:10:07,987
<i>Unlike the new employees for these
companies. Who'll never see a pension.</i>

1015
01:10:08,057 --> 01:10:12,994
<i>But I'm sure our kids will take care of us.
Considering the great life we've given 'em.</i>

1016
01:10:13,062 --> 01:10:16,964
<i>Remember. Let's defeat the terrorists over
there so we don't have to fight them here.</i>

1017
01:10:18,601 --> 01:10:22,469
<i>Kaiser Permanente
is the largest HMO in the country.</i>

1018
01:10:22,538 --> 01:10:27,168
<i>And Dawnelle Keyes was fortunate
enough to be fully insured by them.</i>

1019
01:10:27,243 --> 01:10:31,646
<i>It's a good thing. Because one night.
Her 18-month-old daughter. Mychelle.</i>

1020
01:10:31,714 --> 01:10:34,410
<i>Developed a fever of over 104.</i>

1021
01:10:35,384 --> 01:10:38,842
<i>So. Like any responsible mom.
She called 911.</i>

1022
01:10:38,921 --> 01:10:42,789
<i>And the ambulance took Mychelle
to the closest hospital.</i>

1023
01:10:42,858 --> 01:10:44,883
<i>The hospital checked with her HMO</i>

1024
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:48,624
<i>and they were told that Kaiser would not
cover the tests and the antibiotics</i>

1025
01:10:48,698 --> 01:10:51,963
<i>necessary to treat Mychelle.</i>

1026
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:56,835
<i>She would have to take her to
an in-netork. Kaiser-owned hospital.</i>

1027
01:10:56,906 --> 01:11:01,866
Kaiser said that I should
bring her by car to the hospital,

1028
01:11:01,944 --> 01:11:05,311
and that she shouldn't be treated
at Martin Luther King.

1029
01:11:05,381 --> 01:11:10,318
I just continued to ask them
to treat her, and they refused.

1030
01:11:11,887 --> 01:11:16,051
My daughter got worse
and she had a seizure.

1031
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:23,291
<i>(Moore) Dawnelle begged doctors to not
listen to Kaiser and to treat her daughter.</i>

1032
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:29,236
I was escorted out of the hospital
because they felt that I was a threat.

1033
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:34,032
<i>(Moore) After hours of delay.
She was transported to Kaiser.</i>

1034
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:38,740
<i>And got there just in time
to go into cardiac arrest.</i>

1035
01:11:38,814 --> 01:11:43,478
They worked on her for about 30 minutes,
trying to revive her.

1036
01:11:43,552 --> 01:11:49,957
And the doctors came in
and let us know that she had expired.

1037
01:11:53,129 --> 01:11:58,533
I was in a daze, a real daze.
It just didn't seem real.

1038
01:11:59,702 --> 01:12:01,431
I just held her.

1039
01:12:01,504 --> 01:12:05,873
I held her and I told her
that Mommy tried her best to help her,

1040
01:12:05,941 --> 01:12:11,709
to make sure that she was gonna
get the treatment she needed to receive.

1041
01:12:11,781 --> 01:12:15,911
And that I was sorry
that I wasn't able to help her.

1042
01:12:21,557 --> 01:12:23,650
<i>(toy) Simon says: Give the answer.</i>

1043
01:12:23,726 --> 01:12:25,717
<i>(# computerized tune)</i>

1044
01:12:28,097 --> 01:12:29,826
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1045
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:33,300
<i>(Moore) This is Karena
and her daughter Zo?</i>

1046
01:12:33,369 --> 01:12:36,930
<i>Karena is a graduate
of Michigan State University.</i>

1047
01:12:37,006 --> 01:12:40,464
<i>And a native of my hometown
of Flint. Michigan.</i>

1048
01:12:40,543 --> 01:12:44,343
<i>Six months ago. Zo?
Like Dawnelle's baby Mychelle.</i>

1049
01:12:44,413 --> 01:12:46,574
<i>Came down with a high fever.</i>

1050
01:12:46,649 --> 01:12:49,846
What happened
is she stopped breathing for a little while,

1051
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:53,218
turned blue and passed out
in my arms, which was...

1052
01:12:53,289 --> 01:12:57,453
It was the most horrible moment
in my life, I think,

1053
01:12:57,526 --> 01:13:01,018
just because I thought
that she was either dead or dying.

1054
01:13:01,097 --> 01:13:03,292
And I had no clue what to do.

1055
01:13:03,866 --> 01:13:08,269
At the hospital, they gave her
some medicine to bring the fever down,

1056
01:13:08,337 --> 01:13:10,771
and examined her, took some blood.

1057
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,003
<i>- (Moore) What was wrong with her?
- It was a throat infection.</i>

1058
01:13:14,076 --> 01:13:17,739
But we stayed at the hospital
from Friday to Sunday,

1059
01:13:17,813 --> 01:13:20,907
- just so they could keep an eye on her.
- You stayed there that long?

1060
01:13:20,983 --> 01:13:24,111
Yeah. They just basically
kept an eye on her.

1061
01:13:24,186 --> 01:13:27,986
And how much did all this cost you,
the three-plus days in the hospital?

1062
01:13:28,057 --> 01:13:29,388
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1063
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:33,656
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- And that's because?

1064
01:13:34,663 --> 01:13:37,154
- I live in France.
- You live in France?

1065
01:13:37,233 --> 01:13:38,325
Yeah.

1066
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:42,938
<i>(Moore) Ah. France.</i>

1067
01:13:43,005 --> 01:13:47,738
<i>They enjoy their wine.
Their cigarettes and their fatty foods.</i>

1068
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:50,870
<i>And yet.
Just like the Canadians and the Brits.</i>

1069
01:13:50,946 --> 01:13:53,506
<i>They live much longer than we do.</i>

1070
01:13:53,582 --> 01:13:57,484
<i>Something about that
seemed grossly unfair.</i>

1071
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:00,850
<i>This is Alexi Cremieux.</i>

1072
01:14:00,923 --> 01:14:06,452
<i>He spent his entire adult life in the US
without health insurance.</i>

1073
01:14:07,997 --> 01:14:12,161
<i>(Alexi) I lived in America for 13 years.
I loved my life there.</i>

1074
01:14:12,234 --> 01:14:16,534
But then when I discovered that I had
a tumor and I didn't have health insurance,

1075
01:14:16,605 --> 01:14:19,403
unfortunately,
I had to come back here.

1076
01:14:19,475 --> 01:14:22,672
Even though I had never paid taxes
in France 'cause I never worked here -

1077
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:25,339
I left when I was 18,
I had no Social Security number -

1078
01:14:25,414 --> 01:14:28,315
for them it was,
"He needs treatment, he has no income,

1079
01:14:28,384 --> 01:14:32,445
so we're gonna give him,
you know, the treatment he needs."

1080
01:14:33,355 --> 01:14:36,256
<i>- (Moore) How are you doing now?
- I'm healthy now,</i>

1081
01:14:36,325 --> 01:14:38,384
but I had three months
of chemotherapy.

1082
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:42,261
So after three months, I saw my doctor
and he said, "You wanna go back to work?"

1083
01:14:42,331 --> 01:14:44,822
I said, "No, I don't feel like it."

1084
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,869
"Right now, I'm not ready."
He said, "How much do you need?"

1085
01:14:47,937 --> 01:14:51,168
I said, "Well, I don't know."
He said, "Would three months be OK?"

1086
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,902
I said, "I think three months
would be fine."

1087
01:14:53,976 --> 01:14:58,572
He said, "OK, so take three months off."
So he wrote me a note

1088
01:14:58,647 --> 01:15:01,309
that I gave to my employer
to make sure I got paid.

1089
01:15:02,351 --> 01:15:06,879
- So I went to the south of France...
- Wait a minute, three months off with pay?

1090
01:15:06,956 --> 01:15:08,924
Yes. Yes.

1091
01:15:08,991 --> 01:15:13,985
I get 65% paid by the government,

1092
01:15:14,063 --> 01:15:17,794
and then the other 35%
is paid by my employer.

1093
01:15:17,867 --> 01:15:20,893
To make sure you get 100%.

1094
01:15:21,637 --> 01:15:26,631
So it was April, it was spring again. So
I started right away, sucking up some sun.

1095
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:32,477
And that really helped me a lot,
to recharge my batteries.

1096
01:15:32,548 --> 01:15:37,349
I mean, it was like night and day. In three
months, I went from a 95-year-old man

1097
01:15:37,419 --> 01:15:40,547
to a 35-year-old man again.

1098
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:44,389
But that's because I had that time
to take care of myself.

1099
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:56,302
I'm not in a position to make any judgment
concerning the American system.

1100
01:15:56,372 --> 01:15:59,603
I think the United States
is a great, great country.

1101
01:15:59,675 --> 01:16:02,508
Americans are great people.
I really love them.

1102
01:16:02,578 --> 01:16:07,777
But as a doctor first, as a citizen second,

1103
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:10,375
and eventually, as a patient third,

1104
01:16:10,452 --> 01:16:12,886
I'm very glad to be in France.

1105
01:16:13,622 --> 01:16:15,749
It's kind of a luxury here.

1106
01:16:15,824 --> 01:16:20,022
You are sick, you step in a hospital,
you get the care you need.

1107
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:23,360
It doesn't depend on your premiums.
It depends on what you need.

1108
01:16:23,432 --> 01:16:26,401
One of the principles is solidarity.

1109
01:16:26,468 --> 01:16:30,837
People who are better off
pay for those who are worse off.

1110
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:35,405
You pay according to your means
and you receive according to your needs.

1111
01:16:35,477 --> 01:16:39,004
<i>(Moore) Do you think
that will ever work in America?</i>

1112
01:16:39,081 --> 01:16:40,946
No.

1113
01:16:41,016 --> 01:16:45,112
<i>(Moore) He could barely contain
his seething anti-Americanism.</i>

1114
01:16:45,187 --> 01:16:49,214
<i>And I just didn't want
to listen to any more of it.</i>

1115
01:16:53,162 --> 01:16:57,428
<i>So I found a group of Americans
currently living in Paris.</i>

1116
01:16:57,499 --> 01:17:00,627
<i>Who I know would tell me the truth.</i>

1117
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:04,104
I was diagnosed five years ago
with Type I diabetes.

1118
01:17:04,173 --> 01:17:09,338
<i>- I was a bit nervous to tell them I had...
- (Moore) To tell the French?</i>

1119
01:17:09,411 --> 01:17:12,539
There's a place to check off
if you have a chronic condition.

1120
01:17:12,615 --> 01:17:15,607
I was nervous that they
were going to charge me more.

1121
01:17:15,684 --> 01:17:19,484
And instead, I went into a hospital,
and had round-the-clock care.

1122
01:17:19,555 --> 01:17:23,150
And they do an amazing amount
of preventative care.

1123
01:17:23,225 --> 01:17:25,659
They asked if you have
a preexisting condition,

1124
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:28,891
not to punish you,
but to give you more help?

1125
01:17:28,964 --> 01:17:31,125
- Yes.
- I was in the hospital for a year.

1126
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:37,161
As soon as I was in, it was,
"Well, don't worry, just rest."

1127
01:17:37,239 --> 01:17:41,073
- People said "Rest."
- How many sick days do you get a year?

1128
01:17:41,143 --> 01:17:43,839
- I think it's unlimited.
- Unlimited?

1129
01:17:43,912 --> 01:17:48,144
Yes. How can you limit sick days?
If you're sick, you're sick.

1130
01:17:48,217 --> 01:17:52,483
I've gone to emergency rooms
numerous times, with four boys.

1131
01:17:52,554 --> 01:17:54,920
And have never waited
more than an hour. Never.

1132
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:57,788
I can call and somebody comes
to the house in half an hour.

1133
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,352
No way? Making a house call?
At your place?

1134
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:04,126
How many of you have had
a house call from a doctor? No!

1135
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:07,327
- 3:00am last Friday.
- And how much does this cost you?

1136
01:18:07,403 --> 01:18:09,667
- Nothing.
- What's this service called?

1137
01:18:15,144 --> 01:18:16,270
Where are we going?

1138
01:18:19,348 --> 01:18:22,511
We are going to see a man
who has abdominal pain.

1139
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:24,745
- Abdominal pain?
- Yeah.

1140
01:19:06,462 --> 01:19:09,727
- Where do we go next?
- The next visit?

1141
01:19:18,107 --> 01:19:20,667
<i>(# "L'amour est bleu"
by Vicky Leandros)</i>

1142
01:19:43,398 --> 01:19:45,866
I say to anyone who asks me
why I'm in this country

1143
01:19:45,934 --> 01:19:49,927
is that I think it's one of the friendliest
countries that I know of.

1144
01:19:50,005 --> 01:19:54,169
And talk about family values -
I mean, childcare, healthcare...

1145
01:19:54,243 --> 01:19:56,074
We don't pay for day care.

1146
01:19:56,145 --> 01:20:00,548
The day care where I send my daughter -
and I was a teacher - standards are high.

1147
01:20:04,186 --> 01:20:08,247
So how much does it cost you to have
two children here? How much per hour?

1148
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:17,460
<i>(Moore) Are you happy
with how they're cared for?</i>

1149
01:20:33,048 --> 01:20:39,009
Here, my kids are sure that they are going
to get a certain level of care, education,

1150
01:20:39,087 --> 01:20:42,682
<i>- college I don't have to worry about...
- (Moore) What do you mean?</i>

1151
01:20:42,758 --> 01:20:44,783
<i>- It's free.
- (Moore) You're kidding?</i>

1152
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:47,852
<i>- You can get a college education for free.
- (Moore) No way.</i>

1153
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:51,195
- Yes.
- There's not a sense of desperation.

1154
01:20:51,266 --> 01:20:53,325
They rest, they enjoy life.

1155
01:20:53,402 --> 01:20:57,065
They spend time with their kids,
there's vacations, family time.

1156
01:20:57,139 --> 01:21:00,302
- How many weeks of paid vacation?
- Minimum five weeks.

1157
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:03,208
Five weeks?
Minimum of five weeks?

1158
01:21:03,278 --> 01:21:06,645
If you work for a large company,
you get sometimes eight, ten weeks.

1159
01:21:06,715 --> 01:21:10,583
- Remember that there is a 35-hour week.
- The productivity rate is so high here.

1160
01:21:10,652 --> 01:21:13,849
<i>(Moore) I read it was higher
than the United States.</i>

1161
01:21:13,922 --> 01:21:17,881
If they're working more than 35 hours
a week, they'll get extra days off.

1162
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,394
That is for part-time
and full-time employees.

1163
01:21:20,462 --> 01:21:24,023
You get five weeks paid vacation
even if you're a part-time employee?

1164
01:21:24,099 --> 01:21:25,532
- Of course.
- Everybody.

1165
01:21:25,601 --> 01:21:29,594
If you get married, you get an extra week
or seven days for your honeymoon.

1166
01:21:29,671 --> 01:21:33,072
- In addition to your five weeks.
- You're paid to take your honeymoon?

1167
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:34,836
Also if you move.

1168
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:37,606
You mean if you move
from one apartment to another?

1169
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:39,146
You get one day.

1170
01:21:39,214 --> 01:21:43,548
- You get a day to move and they pay you?
- These are the laws here.

1171
01:21:43,619 --> 01:21:46,782
When my daughter was three months old,
they sent somebody to you

1172
01:21:46,855 --> 01:21:51,690
to give you tips on what to do
with your child, every single day, for free.

1173
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,161
And they'll come to your house
and do your laundry!

1174
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:57,755
- They will! Sure!
- No!

1175
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:59,824
Stop! Stop!

1176
01:21:59,902 --> 01:22:02,996
- When you have a baby.
- When you have a baby.

1177
01:22:05,274 --> 01:22:06,673
What are you doing?

1178
01:22:12,814 --> 01:22:14,406
You from the government?

1179
01:22:17,519 --> 01:22:21,182
- Can she do anything else?
- If I want, yes.

1180
01:22:21,256 --> 01:22:24,555
She's, of course,
taking care of the children.

1181
01:22:24,626 --> 01:22:30,087
And I think if I ask her
to prepare a meal for tonight,

1182
01:22:30,165 --> 01:22:32,360
she can do it.

1183
01:22:37,606 --> 01:22:39,767
No problem.

1184
01:22:39,841 --> 01:22:42,469
She's coming twice a week.

1185
01:22:43,412 --> 01:22:45,972
Four hours a day.
So I can do everything I want,

1186
01:22:46,048 --> 01:22:49,916
for me, for the house,
for my husband, during four hours.

1187
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:51,976
It's very precious for me.

1188
01:22:52,587 --> 01:22:55,784
You don't have any associations?
Nothing to help like that?

1189
01:22:55,857 --> 01:23:00,521
No. Nobody from the government
comes to your home in America

1190
01:23:00,595 --> 01:23:05,157
and does your laundry for you,
if you're a new mother.

1191
01:23:05,233 --> 01:23:07,827
- It's difficult.
- Yeah.

1192
01:23:08,403 --> 01:23:12,965
<i>(woman #12) Something that I experience
a lot of with my own family is guilt.</i>

1193
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:15,339
Guilt for being here almost,

1194
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:19,779
and seeing the advantages and
the benefits I have at such a young age.

1195
01:23:19,848 --> 01:23:25,582
Things that my parents worked their whole
life for and haven't come close to touching.

1196
01:23:25,654 --> 01:23:28,521
It's really hard
to know that you're here

1197
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:32,219
in a very privileged position,
you know, not living the highlife,

1198
01:23:32,294 --> 01:23:38,028
but in comparison, definitely.
And that seems completely unfair.

1199
01:23:38,834 --> 01:23:41,803
One of the things
that keeps everything running here

1200
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:44,464
is that the government
is afraid of the people.

1201
01:23:44,539 --> 01:23:49,238
They're afraid of protests,
they're afraid of reactions from the people.

1202
01:23:49,311 --> 01:23:54,874
In the States, people are afraid of the
government. They're afraid of acting up.

1203
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:57,714
They're afraid of protesting,
afraid of getting out.

1204
01:23:57,786 --> 01:23:59,981
In France, that's what people do.

1205
01:24:40,996 --> 01:24:44,488
<i>(Moore) Free college education.
Free medical care.</i>

1206
01:24:44,566 --> 01:24:46,557
<i>Government-issued nannies.</i>

1207
01:24:46,635 --> 01:24:50,162
<i>I began to wonder
how do they pay for all this?</i>

1208
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:53,935
<i>And then I realized
they're drowning in taxes!</i>

1209
01:24:54,009 --> 01:24:58,139
<i>I wanted to see what effect
this would have on a nice French family.</i>

1210
01:24:58,213 --> 01:25:00,408
<i>So I went to find out.</i>

1211
01:25:04,352 --> 01:25:07,150
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello. Thank you.

1212
01:25:07,989 --> 01:25:10,457
It's very nice.

1213
01:25:19,668 --> 01:25:22,501
- It's the news.
- Yes.

1214
01:25:24,306 --> 01:25:29,039
What is your combined income for
the two of you together for, say one month?

1215
01:25:34,483 --> 01:25:37,611
All right. You're an engineer
and she's an assistant? Not bad.

1216
01:25:47,696 --> 01:25:49,687
<i>(Moore) How much is your mortgage?</i>

1217
01:25:57,839 --> 01:26:00,672
<i>- (Moore) How many cars do you own?
- Two.</i>

1218
01:26:00,742 --> 01:26:03,006
<i>(Moore) Do you owe money
from medical bills?</i>

1219
01:26:05,547 --> 01:26:08,015
Is there any other debt? Loans, anything?

1220
01:26:09,451 --> 01:26:14,514
<i>- Only the apartment.
- (Moore) What are your other expenses?</i>

1221
01:26:14,589 --> 01:26:16,580
The fish.

1222
01:26:17,926 --> 01:26:20,360
Fish. Vegetables.

1223
01:26:20,428 --> 01:26:22,988
Vegetables are a big
monthly expense for you.

1224
01:26:23,064 --> 01:26:26,830
- Yes. And fruit. Yogurt.
- Yogurt.

1225
01:26:27,369 --> 01:26:29,166
What are your other big expenses?

1226
01:26:30,839 --> 01:26:33,239
Very important.

1227
01:26:48,056 --> 01:26:50,650
<i>- (Moore) Kenya?
- We liked.</i>

1228

- Yes.</i>

<i>(# "Je t'aime moi non plus"
by Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin)</i>

1230
01:27:12,681 --> 01:27:16,947
<i>(Moore) After seeing all this.
I began to wonder.</i>

1231
01:27:17,018 --> 01:27:20,112
<i>Was there a reason
our government and our media</i>

1232
01:27:20,188 --> 01:27:22,986
<i>wants us to hate the French?</i>

1233
01:27:28,196 --> 01:27:31,757
<i>Are they worried
we might like the French?</i>

1234
01:27:36,338 --> 01:27:38,932
<i>Or like their ways of doing things?</i>

1235
01:27:47,148 --> 01:27:51,312
<i>It was enough to make me
put away my freedom fries.</i>

1236
01:28:01,463 --> 01:28:03,693
<i>Meanwhile. Back at home.</i>

1237
01:28:03,765 --> 01:28:06,598
<i>Hospitals had found a new way
to deal with patients</i>

1238
01:28:06,668 --> 01:28:08,795
<i>who didn't have health insurance</i>

1239
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:11,100
<i>and couldn't pay their bill.</i>

1240
01:28:12,974 --> 01:28:18,640
I was standing against the wall and I saw
a cab do a U-turn and pull up to the curb.

1241
01:28:18,713 --> 01:28:22,444
I watched to see what was happening
'cause I had a feeling what would occur,

1242
01:28:22,517 --> 01:28:24,644
'cause it's not a new thing.

1243
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:27,552
They pulled up right here
by this yellow fire hydrant

1244
01:28:27,622 --> 01:28:30,750
and dropped Carol off
and immediately pulled away.

1245
01:28:30,825 --> 01:28:34,659
And as soon as they pulled away, she
walked out into the street about up to here.

1246
01:28:34,729 --> 01:28:38,790
She then walked all the way down to the
driveway down here, completely confused,

1247
01:28:38,867 --> 01:28:42,303
has no shoes on whatsoever
and just a hospital gown.

1248
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:44,031
And those gowns are thin.

1249
01:28:44,539 --> 01:28:48,839
That's when one of our staff members went
and asked Carol if she needed assistance

1250
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:52,846
and found out that she was disoriented
and didn't know where she was.

1251
01:30:07,555 --> 01:30:12,492
Kaiser Permanente in Bellflower hospital
had put her in a cab

1252
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,496
and directed them
to bring her to this drop-off point.

1253
01:30:16,564 --> 01:30:21,126
But the names of the hospitals had been
taken off both bracelets before she arrived.

1254
01:30:21,202 --> 01:30:26,367
I have seen others that have come through
our doors who have IVs still in their arms.

1255
01:30:26,441 --> 01:30:29,137
<i>(Moore) They told me that.
At their shelter alone.</i>

1256
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:32,805
<i>Over 50 patients
had been dumped there by hospitals.</i>

1257
01:30:32,881 --> 01:30:36,112
The options are few. We either open
the front door and let them out,

1258
01:30:36,184 --> 01:30:38,709
which is not the humane thing to do,

1259
01:30:38,787 --> 01:30:41,722
or we try to find someplace for them to go.

1260
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:45,021
And right now,
skid row is the best bed in town.

1261
01:30:46,661 --> 01:30:48,754
<i>(Moore) The night
before we were there.</i>

1262
01:30:48,830 --> 01:30:53,062
<i>The county hospital run by
the University of Southern California.</i>

1263
01:30:53,134 --> 01:30:55,625
<i>One of the richest private schools
in the country.</i>

1264
01:30:55,703 --> 01:30:59,002
<i>Dumped another patient off on the curb.</i>

1265
01:31:00,008 --> 01:31:03,705
<i>A woman unable to pay her hospital bill.</i>

1266
01:31:06,414 --> 01:31:08,746
- Do you know how you got here?
- In the cab.

1267
01:31:08,817 --> 01:31:11,047
- In the cab?
- From General Hospital.

1268
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:13,280
They gave him the voucher.

1269
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:19,893
He dropped me off there,
he actually forced me out of the car.

1270
01:31:19,961 --> 01:31:23,692
Ma'am, are you in pain right now?
Are you in pain?

1271
01:31:23,765 --> 01:31:26,029
- Yes.
- Is there anything we can do?

1272
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:29,399
She, at this time, has broken ribs,
broken collarbone,

1273
01:31:29,471 --> 01:31:32,702
and stitches that are not completely healed

1274
01:31:32,774 --> 01:31:35,402
across the top of her head
and on the side of her head.

1275
01:31:35,477 --> 01:31:38,605
Now let me ask you, ma'am.
Before they dropped you off,

1276
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,513
did they ask you
if you knew where you were going?

1277
01:31:41,583 --> 01:31:42,641
No.

1278
01:31:42,717 --> 01:31:45,584
They didn't ask you any questions
about your orientation,

1279
01:31:45,653 --> 01:31:48,850
or whether or not
you knew what was going on?

1280
01:31:48,923 --> 01:31:52,518
No, they just told me
to take care of myself.

1281
01:31:55,864 --> 01:32:01,734
<i>(Moore) May I take a minute to ask
a question that's been on my mind?</i>

1282
01:32:01,803 --> 01:32:03,964
<i>Who are we?</i>

1283
01:32:05,106 --> 01:32:07,666
<i>Is this what we've become?</i>

1284
01:32:07,742 --> 01:32:12,577
<i>A nation that dumps its own citizens like
so much garbage on the side of the curb.</i>

1285
01:32:12,647 --> 01:32:16,515
<i>Because they can't pay
their hospital bill?</i>

1286
01:32:17,252 --> 01:32:22,053
<i>I always thought. And believe to this day.
That we're a good and generous people.</i>

1287
01:32:22,123 --> 01:32:24,819
This is what we do
if somebody's in trouble.

1288
01:32:24,893 --> 01:32:28,192
Anybody gets sick,
we all get together and help.

1289
01:32:28,263 --> 01:32:30,458
<i>(Moore) People with a good heart...</i>

1290
01:32:30,532 --> 01:32:35,697
<i>(man #12) You feel like you're sacrificing,
but you get a blessing from doing this.</i>

1291
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:37,362
<i>(Moore)... and a good soul.</i>

1292
01:32:37,438 --> 01:32:41,898
We've got a lot of support and we're gonna
all keep working until we locate this child.

1293
01:32:41,976 --> 01:32:46,413
<i>(Moore) Neighbors quick to lend a helping
hand to anyone in their hour of need.</i>

1294
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:50,349
I deliver meals to them,
but my life has been so blessed

1295
01:32:50,418 --> 01:32:53,979
that this is just the least that I can do.

1296
01:32:54,055 --> 01:32:57,047
<i>(Moore) They say that you
can judge a society</i>

1297
01:32:57,125 --> 01:33:01,186
<i>by how it treats those
who are the worst off.</i>

1298
01:33:01,262 --> 01:33:07,861
<i>But is the opposite true? That you can
judge a society by how it treats its best?</i>

1299
01:33:09,404 --> 01:33:11,463
<i>Its heroes?</i>

1300
01:33:11,839 --> 01:33:15,240
<i>(man #13) The firefighters and police,
rescue and recovery workers</i>

1301
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:17,574
have responded with true heroism.

1302
01:33:18,813 --> 01:33:24,115
It was their initial heroism
that thwarted the objectives of the terrorists.

1303
01:33:24,185 --> 01:33:29,589
Without regard, in many instances,
to their own safety and security.

1304
01:33:29,657 --> 01:33:35,220
<i>- They truly are heroes.
- (man #14) We owe them everything!</i>

1305
01:33:35,296 --> 01:33:39,528
Here they are, the men and women who
have been on the front lines for New York,

1306
01:33:39,567 --> 01:33:45,437
and for all of us in America!
Tonight is dedicated to you!

1307
01:33:52,013 --> 01:33:55,972
Don't forget about the raffles going on
over there - one dollar each.

1308
01:33:56,618 --> 01:33:58,984
I spent two and a half years down there.

1309
01:33:59,053 --> 01:34:02,454
I got upper and lower
breathing problems.

1310
01:34:02,523 --> 01:34:06,084
I need a double lung transplant,
but was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis.

1311
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:10,859
I haven't slept in a bed in over five years,
I sleep on a chair with a blanket,

1312
01:34:10,932 --> 01:34:12,923
because if I lay down I can't breathe.

1313
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:16,164
<i>(Moore) There were hundreds
of rescue workers on 911</i>

1314
01:34:16,237 --> 01:34:18,364
<i>who were not city employees.</i>

1315
01:34:18,439 --> 01:34:22,808
<i>But rather ran down to Ground Zero
on their own to help out.</i>

1316
01:34:22,877 --> 01:34:25,141
We need volunteers for first aid!

1317
01:34:25,213 --> 01:34:29,547
<i>(Moore) And many developed
serious respiratory illnesses.</i>

1318
01:34:29,617 --> 01:34:31,812
<i>That's when the government said:</i>

1319
01:34:31,886 --> 01:34:36,585
<i>"They're not our responsibility
because they weren't on our payroll. "</i>

1320
01:34:38,626 --> 01:34:43,859
<i>John Graham is an EMT volunteer
from Paramus. New Jersey.</i>

1321
01:34:43,931 --> 01:34:47,423
<i>He was in Lower Manhattan
when he heard the planes hit.</i>

1322
01:34:47,502 --> 01:34:49,970
<i>And rushed over to help.</i>

1323
01:34:50,038 --> 01:34:53,235
<i>He worked in the rescue effort
for the next few months.</i>

1324
01:34:53,307 --> 01:34:57,971
<i>But then had trouble
receiving benefits for his illness.</i>

1325
01:34:58,046 --> 01:35:03,484
They just deny you for any reason.
It's just a terrible waiting game.

1326
01:35:03,551 --> 01:35:07,647
I really feel like
they're waiting for you to die.

1327
01:35:07,722 --> 01:35:11,556
It's terrible.
I never thought that we would do this,

1328
01:35:11,626 --> 01:35:14,527
that the United States would do this.

1329
01:35:14,595 --> 01:35:18,895
<i>(Moore) William Maher is a volunteer
member of New Jersey's fire service.</i>

1330
01:35:18,966 --> 01:35:22,333
<i>He spent to months
working near The Pile at Ground Zero.</i>

1331
01:35:22,403 --> 01:35:26,533
<i>Recovering bodies or body parts.
And it deeply affected him.</i>

1332
01:35:26,607 --> 01:35:30,043
I'm experiencing
a lot of disturbing dreams,

1333
01:35:30,111 --> 01:35:32,306
or whatever you'd like to call them,

1334
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:35,281
and it affected
what I was doing at night,

1335
01:35:35,349 --> 01:35:37,476
and unaware of it because I was asleep

1336
01:35:37,552 --> 01:35:40,112
and I just kept
grinding and grinding my teeth.

1337
01:35:40,188 --> 01:35:43,021
The upper fronts are damaged,
practically beyond repair,

1338
01:35:43,091 --> 01:35:46,083
because of my constant grinding
over the last three years.

1339
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:50,654
I've been before a workers' comp board
already for the 9/11 volunteers' fund.

1340
01:35:50,732 --> 01:35:56,796
I've been denied three times, and hopefully
I will go on my fourth appeal soon,

1341
01:35:56,871 --> 01:36:01,171
if I can get the necessary documentation.

1342
01:36:01,809 --> 01:36:05,108
<i>(Moore) Of course.
There was a $50 million fund set up</i>

1343
01:36:05,179 --> 01:36:07,807
<i>supposedly to help rescue workers.</i>

1344
01:36:07,882 --> 01:36:11,215
Ladies and gentlemen,
the governor of New York, George Pataki.

1345
01:36:11,285 --> 01:36:14,846
<i>(Moore) But the government.
Like the health insurance companies.</i>

1346
01:36:14,922 --> 01:36:18,449
<i>Made it very difficult
for people to receive help.</i>

1347
01:36:18,526 --> 01:36:22,462
You have to have spent
a certain amount of time at Ground Zero,

1348
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:25,590
you have to be able to establish that.

1349
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:30,399
You do have to file an affidavit
within the next year,

1350
01:36:30,471 --> 01:36:32,939
relating your work experiences
at Ground Zero.

1351
01:36:33,007 --> 01:36:36,067
And then, even with all of that,
it's not automatic.

1352
01:36:36,144 --> 01:36:39,011
There is a presumption
when certain illnesses occur,

1353
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:43,881
but that presumption can be rebutted
by other medical evidence.

1354
01:36:43,951 --> 01:36:48,149
We think it is a very fair approach
that protects our heroes.

1355
01:36:55,263 --> 01:36:56,457
I'm sorry.

1356
01:36:56,531 --> 01:37:01,696
<i>(Moore) Reggie Cervantes was
a volunteer medical technician on 911.</i>

1357
01:37:01,769 --> 01:37:08,072
Nothing makes it go away sometimes.
Not water, not cough medicine, anything.

1358
01:37:08,142 --> 01:37:14,570
It's just burning in my throat and irritated
and it just gets me to coughing.

1359
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:20,315
Sometimes I have trouble breathing
'cause I can't catch my breath.

1360
01:37:21,255 --> 01:37:24,747
<i>(Moore) Reggie spent her days
at Ground Zero carrying bodies</i>

1361
01:37:24,826 --> 01:37:27,454
<i>and treating other rescue workers.</i>

1362
01:37:27,528 --> 01:37:30,725
My airway was totally burnt
that first week,

1363
01:37:30,798 --> 01:37:33,289
and I had trouble breathing by then.

1364
01:37:33,367 --> 01:37:36,200
But we wanted to see
if we could dig anybody up alive,

1365
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:42,072
we wanted to see if we had lost anybody,
if we were still missing somebody.

1366
01:37:42,643 --> 01:37:46,704
I wanted to help.
I was trained for this.

1367
01:37:46,781 --> 01:37:51,582
You know, you see somebody
who is in need, you help 'em.

1368
01:37:52,787 --> 01:37:56,052
<i>(Moore) Reggie had difficulty
getting treatment.</i>

1369
01:37:56,123 --> 01:37:58,921
<i>Too sick to work and with no income.</i>

1370
01:37:58,993 --> 01:38:01,120
<i>She was forced to quit her job.</i>

1371
01:38:01,195 --> 01:38:06,132
<i>And used her savings
to move her and her kids out of the city.</i>

1372
01:38:07,768 --> 01:38:10,566
It's hard to figure out
how you're supposed to get help.

1373
01:38:10,638 --> 01:38:14,039
We're trying to go about it the right way.

1374
01:38:15,076 --> 01:38:17,442
But we're ignored.

1375
01:38:17,511 --> 01:38:22,642
<i>(Moore) But not everyone after 911
was ignored by the government.</i>

1376
01:38:22,717 --> 01:38:27,848
We're now approaching the five-year
anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

1377
01:38:27,922 --> 01:38:31,756
So I'm announcing today
that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,

1378
01:38:31,826 --> 01:38:35,193
Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi Binalshibh,

1379
01:38:35,263 --> 01:38:38,289
and 11 other terrorists in CIA custody,

1380
01:38:38,366 --> 01:38:42,234
have been transferred to
the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay.

1381
01:38:44,105 --> 01:38:49,372
<i>(man #15) On that island are some of the
world's most hardened enemy combatants.</i>

1382
01:38:49,443 --> 01:38:53,436
<i>(man #16) These detainees are deadly
and include the 20th hijacker,</i>

1383
01:38:53,514 --> 01:38:57,177
as well as a number of Osama bin Laden's
personal bodyguards

1384
01:38:57,251 --> 01:39:01,449
and others who had a direct role
in the September 11 attacks.

1385
01:39:02,123 --> 01:39:07,891
The kind of people held at Guantanamo
include terrorist trainers, bomb-makers...

1386
01:39:07,962 --> 01:39:13,662
Many of them have American blood on
their hands and are the elite of al-Qaida.

1387
01:39:13,734 --> 01:39:16,032
It seems to me we have an obligation

1388
01:39:16,103 --> 01:39:21,063
to treat these individuals
as enemy combatants.

1389
01:39:21,142 --> 01:39:25,636
<i>(Moore) And then I learned
it wasn't all bad news at Gitmo.</i>

1390
01:39:30,985 --> 01:39:34,751
<i>(man #16) Detainees representing a threat
to our national security</i>

1391
01:39:34,822 --> 01:39:37,347
are given access
to top-notch medical facilities.

1392
01:39:37,425 --> 01:39:42,362
They have acute care 24 hours a day,
in which surgical procedures,

1393
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:46,924
everything can be performed right there
in the detainee camps.

1394
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:49,492
This is the dental clinic,
or the health clinic.

1395
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:54,098
We have a physical therapy department,
X-ray capabilities with digital X-rays.

1396
01:39:54,175 --> 01:39:56,302
We have one single operating room.

1397
01:39:56,377 --> 01:40:01,610
Health personnel to detainee ratio
is one to four, remarkably high.

1398
01:40:01,682 --> 01:40:05,982
They do sick call on the blocks three times
per week, care for them there if they can,

1399
01:40:06,053 --> 01:40:09,181
or bring that detainee back to the clinic
to be seen there.

1400
01:40:09,256 --> 01:40:11,315
Screening for cancer has taken place.

1401
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:16,056
Colonoscopy is a procedure which
is performed there on a routine basis.

1402
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:19,395
We have diabetes,
high blood pressure, high cholesterol.

1403
01:40:19,467 --> 01:40:22,402
We monitor the weight
and nutrition of the detainees,

1404
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:26,099
so that we can track those detainees
to make sure we see them frequently,

1405
01:40:26,173 --> 01:40:28,573
monitoring their labs
and their overall health.

1406
01:40:28,642 --> 01:40:35,013
Their medical attention... They get way
better medical treatment than I've ever had.

1407
01:40:35,082 --> 01:40:39,451
- You think it's as good as most US HMOs?
- Certainly very similar and as good, sir.

1408
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:43,616
<i>(man #15) I leave with an impression
that healthcare there is clearly better</i>

1409
01:40:43,691 --> 01:40:45,955
than they received at home,

1410
01:40:46,027 --> 01:40:50,930
and as good as many people receive
in the United States of America.

1411
01:40:50,998 --> 01:40:55,401
<i>(Moore) Wow! So there is actually
one place on American soil</i>

1412
01:40:55,469 --> 01:40:58,563
<i>that had free universal healthcare.</i>

1413
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:01,107
<i>That's all I needed to know.</i>

1414
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:05,240
<i>I went down to Miami. Florida.</i>

1415
01:41:06,247 --> 01:41:08,579
<i>Got myself a boat.</i>

1416
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:11,245
<i>And loaded up Bill.</i>

1417
01:41:11,318 --> 01:41:14,253
<i>And Reggie and John.</i>

1418
01:41:14,755 --> 01:41:16,518
John, welcome, sir.

1419
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:21,391
<i>And anyone else I could find who needed
to see a doctor and couldn't afford one.</i>

1420
01:41:21,462 --> 01:41:25,421
<i>So many people showed up.
I had to get a couple extra boats.</i>

1421
01:41:25,499 --> 01:41:30,368
<i>And I called up Donna Smith from Denver.
Who is now on nine different medications.</i>

1422
01:41:30,438 --> 01:41:33,100
<i>And asked her
if she'd like to come along.</i>

1423
01:41:33,174 --> 01:41:37,235
<i>I figured she'd like to get out
of her daughter's basement for a while.</i>

1424
01:41:37,311 --> 01:41:38,642
All right, let's go.

1425
01:41:55,396 --> 01:41:59,560
Which way to Guantanamo Bay?
Can we go?

1426
01:41:59,633 --> 01:42:02,796
We're not going to Cuba!
We're going to America!

1427
01:42:03,404 --> 01:42:05,929
It's American soil!

1428
01:42:41,942 --> 01:42:43,933
We made it.

1429
01:42:58,826 --> 01:43:01,693
There it is.
There's the runway.

1430
01:43:01,762 --> 01:43:04,492
That's the prison over there
where the detainees are.

1431
01:43:04,565 --> 01:43:09,093
<i>- (Reggie) We're very close.
- Yeah, we're very close.</i>

1432
01:43:11,005 --> 01:43:14,771
The white building is the hospital, I think.

1433
01:43:15,276 --> 01:43:17,267
OK, let's go.

1434
01:43:21,715 --> 01:43:28,245
<i>(Moore) We commandeered a fishing boat
and sailed into Guantanamo Bay.</i>

1435
01:43:28,322 --> 01:43:33,225
<i>As we approached the line in the water
beteen the American and Cuban side.</i>

1436
01:43:33,294 --> 01:43:36,195
<i>We were told to be careful for mines.</i>

1437
01:43:38,832 --> 01:43:43,428
Permission to enter.
I have three 9/11 rescue workers.

1438
01:43:43,504 --> 01:43:46,405
They need some medical attention.

1439
01:43:50,511 --> 01:43:55,244
These are 9/11 rescue workers!
They just want some medical attention!

1440
01:43:55,316 --> 01:43:58,615
The same kind that al-Qaida is getting.

1441
01:44:00,721 --> 01:44:05,385
They don't want any more than
you're giving the evildoers, just the same!

to get out of here.</i>

1445
01:44:16,237 --> 01:44:21,072
<i>But what was I supposed to do with these
sick people and no one to help them?</i>

1446
01:44:21,141 --> 01:44:25,407
<i>I mean. Here we were stuck in some
godforsaken Third World country.</i>

1447
01:44:25,479 --> 01:44:30,940
<i>And communists. No less. When I was
a kid. These people wanted to kill us.</i>

01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:57,609
Excuse me, we're looking for a doctor.
Is there a doctor here in Cuba?

1451
01:44:57,678 --> 01:44:59,475
Any doctors?

1452
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:06,479
All in this one block?

1453
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:15,194
All right, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1454
01:45:15,696 --> 01:45:20,861
<i>(Moore) OK. OK. I know what you're
thinking. Cuba is where Lucifer lives.</i>

1455
01:45:23,771 --> 01:45:29,073
<i>The worse place on Earth.
The most evil nation ever created.</i>

1456

<i>How do we know that? 'Cause that's
what we've been told for over 45 years.</i>

1457
01:45:33,914 --> 01:45:37,816
A series of offensive missile sites
can be none other

1458
01:45:37,885 --> 01:45:42,481
than to provide a nuclear strike capability
against the western hemisphere.

1459
01:45:42,556 --> 01:45:47,755
I'm not gonna yield until Fidel Castro
allows freedom on the island.

1460
01:45:47,828 --> 01:45:50,729
That's a...
You can count on it.

1461
01:45:52,433 --> 01:45:54,765
Put it in the bank.

1462
01:45:55,969 --> 01:45:59,063
<i>(Moore) It seems that
what really bugged us about Castro</i>

1463
01:45:59,139 --> 01:46:02,540
<i>was that he overthrew
the dictator that we liked.</i>

1464
01:46:02,609 --> 01:46:06,841
<i>And replaced him with a guy
we didn't like - himself.</i>

1465
01:46:07,781 --> 01:46:11,979
<i>And so now. After all these years.
One thing is clear -</i>

1466
01:46:12,052 --> 01:46:16,182
<i>the Cuban people
have free universal healthcare.</i>

1467
01:46:16,256 --> 01:46:20,920
<i>They've become known as having not
only one of the best healthcare systems.</i>

1468
01:46:20,994 --> 01:46:24,452
<i>But as being one of the most generous
countries in providing doctors</i>

1469
01:46:24,531 --> 01:46:28,592
<i>and medical equipment
to Third World countries.</i>

1470
01:46:28,669 --> 01:46:33,663
<i>In the US. Healthcare costs
run nearly $ 7.000 per person.</i>

1471
01:46:33,741 --> 01:46:37,802
<i>But in Cuba. They spend only $ 251.</i>

1472
01:46:37,878 --> 01:46:42,838
<i>And yet the Cubans are able to have
a lower infant mortality rate than the US.</i>

1473
01:46:42,916 --> 01:46:46,750
<i>A longer average life span
than the United States.</i>

1474

<i>They believe in preventive medicine.</i>

1475

<i>And it seems like there's a doctor
on every block.</i>

1476
01:46:53,494 --> 01:46:56,258
<i>Their only sin
when it comes to healthcare</i>

1477
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:59,731
<i>seems to be
that they don't do it for a profit.</i>

1478
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:04,328
Anybody need medication right now
from the pharmacy?

1479
01:47:08,575 --> 01:47:11,066
- Are you the pharmacist?
- Yes.

1480
01:47:11,145 --> 01:47:13,170
Do you have this?

1481
01:47:14,882 --> 01:47:19,979
<i>- Is this one similar to yours?
- (Reggie) Yeah. It's $120 in the US.</i>

1482
01:47:20,053 --> 01:47:22,613
- This is $120 in the US?
- Yes.

1483
01:47:26,326 --> 01:47:30,695
- How much is that in American dollars?
- It's like five cents.

1484
01:47:30,764 --> 01:47:32,823
- Five cents?
- Yeah. More or less.

1485
01:47:45,345 --> 01:47:49,213
<i>Thank you very much.
Muchas gracias.</i>

1486
01:47:49,283 --> 01:47:51,274
$120 is a lot of money

1487
01:47:51,351 --> 01:47:57,517
when you get $1,000 in social security
disability and need one or two a month.

1488
01:47:57,591 --> 01:48:01,755
Five cents here?
It's like the biggest insult.

1489
01:48:01,829 --> 01:48:04,389
It just doesn't make any sense.

1490
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:07,531
It doesn't make any sense.

1491
01:48:07,601 --> 01:48:12,038
I wanna fill a suitcase up
and go back home with it.

1492

<i>(Moore) I took my group

1494
01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:46,897
<i>They didn't ask for money

1495
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:51,238
<i>Just their name...</i>

I'm Dr. Roque.
I'm an internal medicine specialist.

- How are you feeling?

1505
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:42,692
My lungs hurt. I have pain.

1506
01:49:42,763 --> 01:49:45,960
I get pretty severe nosebleeds at times.

1507
01:49:46,033 --> 01:49:48,024
I get terrible headaches in the night,

1508
01:49:48,101 --> 01:49:51,593
but I haven't been evaluated
for the sleep apnea for nine years.

1509
01:49:51,672 --> 01:49:55,699
- Yeah, I have...
- Many medications for lung problems.

1510
01:49:55,776 --> 01:49:58,609
Almost every medication
for lung problems, I've got.

1511
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:02,581
After 9/11, things have happened,
my teeth started falling out.

1512
01:50:02,649 --> 01:50:05,880
Because of certain conditions,
I was grinding.

1513
01:50:05,953 --> 01:50:11,118
There's one test that they recommended
I take, it's about $5,000 to $ 7,000.

1514
01:50:11,191 --> 01:50:16,652
The dentist that I talked to,
it's like $15,000 or more.

1515
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:21,793
It's two years I have no medical coverage,
so I can't go for the last part of the test.

1516
01:50:24,071 --> 01:50:26,972
It's OK, everything's gonna be OK.
Right?

1517
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,600
Yes. I am so...

1518
01:50:29,676 --> 01:50:34,875
It's so hard for me to digest
somebody saying it's free.

1519
01:50:36,016 --> 01:50:40,953
Because 20 years of our lives
have been spent fighting.

1520
01:50:41,021 --> 01:50:44,081
So I am so grateful.

1521
01:50:45,959 --> 01:50:48,450
No, you don't need to say that.

1522
01:50:49,496 --> 01:50:51,862
- Thank you. Thank you.
- OK.

1523
01:50:51,932 --> 01:50:54,457
Come on, don't cry.
Everything's gonna be OK, right?

1524

<i>So I wrote a check for the $ 12.000
he needed to keep his wife insured</i>

1571
01:56:17,257 --> 01:56:21,387
<i>and in treatment.
And sent it to him anonymously.</i>

1572
01:56:23,663 --> 01:56:28,965
<i>His wife got better
and his website is still going strong.</i>

1573
01:56:34,808 --> 01:56:38,505
<i>It was hard for me to acknowledge
that in the end.</i>

1574
01:56:38,578 --> 01:56:40,842
<i>We truly are all in the same boat.</i>

1575
01:56:41,581 --> 01:56:44,277
<i>And that. No matter what our differences.</i>

1576
01:56:44,351 --> 01:56:47,377
<i>We sink or swim together.</i>

1577
01:56:47,454 --> 01:56:50,981
<i>That's how it seems to be
everywhere else.</i>

1578
01:56:51,558 --> 01:56:55,858
<i>They take care of each other.
No matter what their disagreements.</i>

1579
01:56:57,364 --> 01:57:02,961
<i>You know. When we see a good idea
from another country. We grab it.</i>

1580
01:57:03,036 --> 01:57:06,733
<i>If they build a better car. We drive it.</i>

1581
01:57:06,806 --> 01:57:10,139
<i>If they make a better wine. We drink it.</i>

1582
01:57:11,277 --> 01:57:14,508
<i>So if they've come up with
a better way to treat the sick.</i>

1583
01:57:14,581 --> 01:57:16,572
<i>To teach their kids.</i>

1584
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:20,141
<i>To take care of their babies.</i>

1585
01:57:21,154 --> 01:57:24,055
<i>To simply be good to each other.</i>

1586
01:57:24,124 --> 01:57:26,752
<i>Then what's our problem?</i>

1587
01:57:26,826 --> 01:57:29,158
<i>Why can't we do that?</i>

1588
01:57:29,229 --> 01:57:32,687
<i>They live in a world of "we."
Not "me."</i>

1589
01:57:33,767 --> 01:57:38,704
<i>We'll never fix anything
until we get that one basic thing right.</i>

1590
01:57:38,772 --> 01:57:41,900
<i>And powerful forces
hope that we never do.</i>

1591
01:57:42,575 --> 01:57:46,306
<i>And that we remain the only country
in the western world</i>

1592
01:57:46,379 --> 01:57:49,371
<i>without free universal healthcare.</i>

1593
01:57:50,150 --> 01:57:54,143
<i>You know. If we ever did remove
the chokehold of medical bills.</i>

1594
01:57:54,754 --> 01:57:57,723
<i>College loans. Day care.</i>

1595
01:57:57,791 --> 01:58:01,955
<i>And everything else
that makes us afraid to step out of line.</i>

1596
01:58:02,028 --> 01:58:04,724
<i>Well. Watch out.</i>

1597
01:58:04,798 --> 01:58:08,325
<i>'Cause it'll be a new day in America.</i>

1598
01:58:08,401 --> 01:58:10,392
<i>In the meantime.</i>

1599
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:14,406
<i>I'm gonna go get the government
to do my laundry.</i>
