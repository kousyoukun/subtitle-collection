1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,640
Corpse herding was popular
in Xiangxi province

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,880
Transportation was not developed back then

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,440
If people died away from their home towns

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,760
they will be sent home
by the corpse herders

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,880
This is a folklore

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,920
Some people claimed they've seen it

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,200
This black magic
can't be explained by modern science

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,760
The corpse herders learnt Zhuyou arts...

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,360
also known as Maoshan Art

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,280
It's a type of black magic

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,280
We're not trying to spread superstitions

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
...in this movie

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,000
Whether or not you find this credible,
it's up to you

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,360
Xiaoyuan, hurry up

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,880
Send the body to No. 9, third street...

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,480
Shaoshan village, Xiangtan Province

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,280
...to the Chen family

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,200
I got it

19
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Boss, burial clothes; medium size

20
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,280
Medium size, and a hat

21
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
Don't cry

22
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,200
Mr. Guo, you should head back

23
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,960
Master Chen Wu will be back soon

24
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,160
He'll have the body sent back to hometown

25
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you

26
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
You're welcome

27
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,600
Let's go

28
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Up

29
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,160
Go

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Calm down...

31
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,800
One at a time

32
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,600
Calm down...

33
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,800
What then?

34
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,120
I don't know where master Chen Wu is

35
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
Not even his apprentice knows

36
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,320
The weather is so hot

37
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,680
The corpses could rot

38
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,040
If something happens

39
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,640
What should we do?

40
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,840
Who'll be responsible?

41
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,280
Fan Zhengyuan

42
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,960
Where's your master?

43
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,520
Thank you. Find him

44
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Master hasn't slept in the inn
for the past 2 nights

45
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,080
I have no idea where he is

46
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,400
What do you mean?

47
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,320
What's going on?

48
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,720
When can we start then?

49
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,120
Yes, when?

50
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,280
You said the body will be delivered
in 20 days

51
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,840
But we don't see the corpse herder

52
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,880
That's right

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,400
What's going on?

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,160
Fine, I'll go look for him

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,440
Wait, where are you going?

56
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,880
What's going on?

57
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,200
Is master Chen staying here?

58
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,760
Yes, in the first room

59
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,840
Let's go find him

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,960
He isn't here... you all

61
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,320
You're such a chicken

62
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,320
What? I'm not

63
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,640
You little cow

64
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
Didn't you see them?

65
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
He's here

66
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,400
Keep quiet

67
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,880
They can hear you

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,160
That's my intention

69
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,560
That's why I yelled

70
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,480
They're looking for my master

71
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,560
But I don't know where he is

72
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,840
Do you want me to tell you

73
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,240
...where he is?

74
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Where?

75
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
He's gambling

76
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,880
That I know

77
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,280
But where?

78
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,000
You must promise you will take me along

79
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,120
The gambling house is not a girl's place

80
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,000
I won't tell if you don't promise me

81
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,360
Fine, I promise. Now where is he?

82
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,280
A small place on the 5th alley

83
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,440
I'll take you

84
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,160
I want to look at all those cash

85
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,600
Wait, not now

86
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,640
You must go outside

87
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
and make a diversion

88
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,040
What are you trying to do?

89
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,560
They're looking for my master

90
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,720
Since they're outside

91
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,880
If they see me

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,480
They won't let me go

93
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,520
I'll see you later then

94
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,760
See you

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,880
Great, I'll show you what I've got

96
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,480
What are you trying to do?

97
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,080
Excuse me

98
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,360
Master

99
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,160
Shut up, take the money

100
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,680
Win

101
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,360
Master, clients are looking for you

102
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,640
They are worried that if we don't leave...

103
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,200
the bodies will rot in this weather

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,640
How many in total?

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,680
Eight

106
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,160
Come...

107
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,080
Master

108
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,640
You know that it has to be an odd number

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,640
And I'm winning here

110
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,000
Buy me some wine

111
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Go

112
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
I'll go

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,600
Leaving so soon?

114
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,240
Of course

115
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,520
Since I've won

116
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,360
Don't you agree?

117
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,360
I don't think so

118
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,520
No

119
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,240
Let's go, Xiaoyuan

120
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,160
Go back in

121
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,680
vampire turns his head back

122
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,880
vampire goes out of the cave

123
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
vampire greets the moon

124
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,640
vampire goes over the hill

125
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,160
vampire goes back to original form

126
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,160
Enough, Xiaoyuan

127
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,120
Yes, master

128
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,160
What now?

129
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,120
Get me the wine

130
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,360
I'm impressed

131
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,280
Wine, boss

132
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,160
Sure

133
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,880
Here you go

134
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,120
How much?

135
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,880
Never mind, it's on the house

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,400
That's very unlike you

137
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,400
Whatever we broke

138
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,880
This should cover it

139
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,920
Another one

140
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,840
Why don't you take this back?

141
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,000
We came from quite afar

142
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,600
And you want us to carry the body back?

143
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,840
Master Chen isn't here

144
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,520
Then what to do?

145
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,960
There's nothing I can do about it

146
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,000
We have to wait for Master Chen

147
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,360
Master Chen

148
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,640
Hey you're back. Everything's fine now

149
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
What's going on?

150
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,880
We've been waiting for you

151
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,800
That's right

152
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
Fine, calm down

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,480
Calm down...

154
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,640
Master
What is it?

155
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,800
You haven't cleaned your hands

156
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,760
Let me burn a hands cleansing charm

157
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,640
Carry him inside

158
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,240
Inside...

159
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,680
Xiaoyuan

160
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,480
It's you?

161
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,720
Have you forgotten what you've promised?

162
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,040
Another dead body

163
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,520
We will leave tonight

164
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,240
And we won't bother you anymore

165
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,720
You promised me

166
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,760
Yes

167
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
We'll go together

168
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,320
No... we can't

169
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,200
Why not?

170
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,880
There're no women in our business

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,400
You see, the yin energy of women is strong

172
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,560
If a woman approaches the vampire

173
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,920
It's going to be trouble

174
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,520
Your mom is a woman, isn't she?

175
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,920
She gave birth to you

176
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,720
So I'm sure you'd have yin energy too

177
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,760
I can promise you anything

178
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,840
...except this!

179
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,120
Dad's arranged me to marry
in the Zhu family

180
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,160
Congratulations

181
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,840
You know their son is an idiot

182
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,840
You save me

183
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,280
I don't have any ideas

184
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,480
Master

185
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,120
Master, that's cash

186
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, sorry

187
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,440
Four corners of the earth

188
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,480
With this spell, the dead rest in peace

189
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,080
This one is bald

190
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
So, does it matter?

191
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,160
How did he die?

192
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,840
Could be food poisoning

193
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,960
He vomited, then he died 2 days after

194
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,360
Don't worry, my friend

195
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,640
No matter where your hometown is

196
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,760
I'll make sure you get home

197
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,800
Xiaoyuan, take him to the morgue

198
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,480
How long do we have to wait, master?

199
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,880
There are nine. When will you leave?

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,320
When?

201
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,560
It's not time yet

202
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,840
If the vampires won't hop,
will you carry them?

203
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,920
Leave now

204
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,400
So that I can work

205
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,680
Please...

206
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,360
Fallen leaves back to roots

207
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,880
Please return to your home town safely

208
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,880
Master, it's ready

209
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,840
Let's go

210
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,240
One, two, three... seven

211
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,400
Master, the bald one seems trouble

212
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,720
Up

213
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,640
Set out

214
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,920
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

215
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,480
There will be disasters
if there's a collision

216
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,360
Go home in pairs

217
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,280
Have a safe trip

218
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,400
Let's go

219
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,840
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

220
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,200
There will be disasters
if there's a collision

221
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,040
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

222
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,760
There will be disasters
if there's a collision

223
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,680
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

224
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,200
Let's speed up, it's clear

225
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,000
Xiaoyuan

226
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,800
Master

227
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,640
Let's have a break
after we cross the bridge

228
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,240
Crossing the bridge

229
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,560
There's something strange about
the bald one

230
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,480
Nonsense

231
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,560
Stay here

232
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,600
Hurry

233
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,240
Yes

234
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,040
Eat up

235
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,800
Yes

236
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,040
What is it, Xiaoyuan?

237
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,720
Master

238
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,320
I heard a sound

239
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Don't be silly

240
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,280
Master, do vampires swallow?

241
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,280
Stop it

242
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,440
Strange

243
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,080
Are you done?

244
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,920
Yes

245
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,880
Then let's get on the road

246
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,880
Sure

247
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,920
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

248
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,920
Master, there seems to be something ahead

249
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,960
Take them to the side

250
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,400
And check it out at front

251
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,360
Yes

252
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,880
The best is if they could stay away

253
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,040
Otherwise we'll have to find another path

254
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,080
Freeze

255
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,120
Password

256
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,360
I'm just a civilian

257
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,760
A civilian?

258
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,600
On the ground

259
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,520
Brother Xiang

260
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,440
Brother Xiang

261
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,280
There's a kid
with a bunch of people outside

262
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,440
Seems there's something wrong

263
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,680
Speak up

264
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,000
There're only two of us

265
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,960
The other nine are vampires

266
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,880
Tell me the truth or I'll shoot

267
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,840
I'm telling the truth

268
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,280
Those are vampires

269
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,040
Corpse herders?

270
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,640
We've walked this path for years

271
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,640
But we've never seen a checkpoint

272
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,200
We're looking for a fugitive

273
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,520
Come here and take a look

274
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,120
Have you seen this guy?

275
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
No

276
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,720
Really?

277
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,040
Officers

278
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,440
I've been with the vampires for a while

279
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,560
When the dead's on the road,
the living keep off

280
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,400
I won't see any one on the road

281
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,360
You better find another path

282
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,720
I worry that there might be a collision

283
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,080
Freeze, I'll go check

284
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,960
Give me back my clothes

285
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,480
Go...

286
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,960
Master, they want to check

287
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
Don't touch him

288
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Stop him

289
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,560
Stop

290
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,440
They are dead, just give them their peace

291
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
You better stay away

292
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,240
If you are aged 22, 24, 27

293
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,560
32 or 40

294
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,840
You better watch out

295
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,000
You'll fall sick or end up dead

296
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,000
Hurry

297
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,840
Go...

298
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,520
Master, look how far they run?

299
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,040
Xiaoyuan, let's go

300
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,480
Hurry

301
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:37,160
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

302
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,080
Stay away

303
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,240
if you are aged 22, 24, 27, 32 or 40

304
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,240
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

305
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,640
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

306
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,200
Master, the bald one dashes off

307
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,240
Please open up, we want to stay here...

308
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,280
Open up, we want to rent a room here

309
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,680
There's just one room

310
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,400
Great. Master, let's go

311
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,840
But you're a large party

312
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,880
You can't all fit in one room

313
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,840
You should find another inn

314
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,040
That's alright, it's just me and my master

315
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,920
The rest don't sleep

316
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,240
vampires

317
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,000
You must be new here.
We're corpse herders

318
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,040
Don't be scared, where's the backyard?

319
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,960
Take a turn over there

320
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,280
Xiaoyuan

321
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,680
Take them to the backyard

322
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,440
Up

323
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,720
The alley's at front, stay in order

324
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,040
Back to position within 100 steps

325
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,320
Get up, take the guest to the room

326
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,040
Please sir

327
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,800
Is there a gambling house nearby?

328
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,200
Yes

329
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,680
There's a big one at the back

330
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,800
If my apprentice looks for me...

331
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,120
Don't tell him that I'm there

332
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,440
Just tell him I'll be back in the morning

333
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,600
Tidy up the room

334
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,600
You scared me!

335
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,800
You scared me too

336
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,000
You really scared me!

337
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,360
You can't look at them

338
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,480
Yes

339
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,200
Leave now. Want me to summon them?

340
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,840
No...

341
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,960
Curious yet scared

342
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,920
Back

343
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,160
I wonder where the master is

344
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,080
The bald one...

345
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
There's definitely something strange

346
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,560
Who is it?

347
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,360
The dead don't cause any trouble

348
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,640
Go back to your place

349
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,680
Where are the spells?

350
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,680
Help...

351
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,680
The dead occupying the bed of living!

352
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,240
Which herd do you belong to?

353
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Don't you recognize me?

354
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,920
Are you Feifei?

355
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,400
That's right

356
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
Why are you dressed up like this?

357
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,720
You've cut your hair short

358
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
Out there I asked who you were

359
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,960
Why didn't you answer me?

360
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,320
I'm a girl. Knocking on your door...

361
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,680
in the middle of night is bad enough

362
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,440
I didn't want to say anything

363
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,280
Then why didn't you open the door?

364
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,080
I was afraid
there could be a ghost outside

365
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,000
And you are a corpse herder?
You're a coward

366
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,360
What do you know?

367
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,440
We have a bald one this time

368
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,880
He's scary. Won't listen to our commands

369
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,080
And my master's not around

370
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,040
I saw a shadow, and then it's gone

371
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,240
And then you showed up here

372
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,120
You've scared me

373
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,400
Why are you here?

374
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,720
I ran away from home

375
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,320
I don't want to get married to that idiot

376
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,520
What do you plan to do?

377
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,320
I hoped that you will...

378
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,880
No way

379
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,960
I've told you before

380
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,160
My master won't agree to it

381
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,040
There are no women

382
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,480
...in our business

383
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,480
But I'm dressed as a guy now

384
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,800
Yes, you dressed up as one

385
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,640
But you're a girl

386
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,240
Fine, let's take a break first

387
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,440
and we'll wait for my master

388
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,560
Go to sleep

389
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,040
I'll sleep on the floor and you on the bed

390
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,120
Hey

391
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,800
Where did my master go last night?

392
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,600
Your master? I've no idea

393
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,440
Fei, if we can't find my master

394
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,480
I worry that the corpses will be a problem

395
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,200
What kind of a problem?

396
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,000
They will rot and become monsters

397
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,240
Really? Your master...

398
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,880
Must be gambling, right?

399
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,640
Yes, he is

400
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,840
Where?

401
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,360
The gambling house at the back

402
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,240
The biggest building

403
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,120
Thanks

404
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,080
Don't follow me

405
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,080
Wait for me here

406
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,080
We'll discuss it when I've found my master

407
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,080
The banker wins

408
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,560
Get the wine

409
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,000
Win...

410
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,640
Here you go, sir

411
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,400
Are you the banker or am I?

412
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,800
You've been here for a long time

413
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,800
You should take a break

414
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,960
It's alright as long as I'm winning

415
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,120
I'll be the banker

416
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,440
Come

417
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,200
Come...

418
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,560
Place your bets

419
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,320
You don't want it?

420
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,280
Stop it

421
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,240
You're too rude

422
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,200
Please join me in the vIP room upstairs

423
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,480
We play seriously there

424
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,040
Alright

425
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,040
That's all for you?

426
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,280
Sure

427
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,280
Let me see

428
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
I've won again

429
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,120
Pay up

430
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,720
You're the banker

431
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,240
Sure

432
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,480
Men

433
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,640
Tie him up

434
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,440
Yes

435
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,960
Master...

436
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,000
Are you alright? Let's go

437
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,880
Go upstairs to get my money

438
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,680
Forget it, let's go

439
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,680
Go get the money

440
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,080
Where's my master's money?

441
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,040
Xiaoyuan, vampire revives

442
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,680
Sure

443
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,680
vampire turns his head back

444
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,440
vampire worships the moon

445
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,800
vampire goes out of the cave

446
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,160
vampire revives

447
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,680
Rebound

448
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,840
Well done. Now the money

449
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,640
Sure

450
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,600
What is it?

451
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,160
They've won lots of money

452
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,800
I've seen them before; quite wellknown

453
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,160
Stop it

454
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,360
I had no idea last night

455
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,840
You two are very good in martial arts

456
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,080
We are corpse herders

457
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,680
We know a little bit of martial arts

458
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,880
As for winning in such an establishment

459
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,760
That's purely luck

460
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,720
You shouldn't take it personally

461
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:55,920
You...

462
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,840
Xu, you are wrong

463
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,200
You shouldn't beat them up
because you lost

464
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,800
Then you won't have any customers left

465
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,320
That's right

466
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,120
Give us back the money

467
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,640
No

468
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,480
You...

469
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,840
The fight's over

470
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,400
Since this old guy's injured

471
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,240
We'll call it even

472
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,680
What? You owe us the money

473
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,280
And you've hurt my master's leg

474
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,680
This is unfair

475
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,560
Xiaoyuan

476
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,960
Please ask the old gentleman
his good name

477
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,400
So that we can report to our boss

478
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,160
My master's called Chen Wu

479
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,320
Chen Wu the Magic Fist?

480
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,200
It's our fault

481
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,840
No big deal

482
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,680
Just like bitten by dogs

483
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,240
Listen up

484
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,040
Get Mr. Chen's money

485
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,080
All of it

486
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,840
Yes

487
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,920
Have a drink, Mr. Chen

488
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,720
This way

489
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,040
How's your leg, master?

490
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
Seems like a fracture; I'm alright though

491
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,720
I'll be fine in ten days

492
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,640
Since you're alright

493
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,040
...you can still walk

494
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,160
Yes

495
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,320
With the hot weather

496
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,840
If we don't get back on the road

497
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,920
The corpses will rot

498
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,760
Xiaoyuan, my leg is hurt

499
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,840
It's fine

500
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,400
My leg's fine

501
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,200
Master, you want me to...

502
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,840
You've worked with me for a long time

503
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,240
I thought that you've already...

504
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,560
learnt everything you need to know

505
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,160
Well, I know most of it

506
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,560
But there's so many spells

507
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,480
With me alone

508
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,080
I can't always remember them

509
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,920
I've been doing this for 20 years

510
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,240
And I'm old now

511
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,440
You can't rely on me for long

512
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
But, master

513
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
I can't do it on my own

514
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,160
Her? I don't think so

515
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,000
Why not? Under these circumstances

516
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,640
She's a girl

517
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,680
What if the corpses won't listen?

518
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,160
We can still fix that

519
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,680
But if the corpses rot...

520
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,640
Then it's all over!

521
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,240
The master's right

522
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,680
Fine... your wish has come true

523
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,360
The corpses

524
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,280
Are you afraid of them?

525
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,680
No, they will listen to the spells

526
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,400
You think that will always work?

527
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,440
What if they don't?

528
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,360
With you here

529
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,440
I don't care

530
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,320
Fine... stop it

531
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,440
Xiaoyuan, get my bag

532
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,400
Although you know how to use the spells

533
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,600
But you're not an expert

534
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,280
Fei, sew several pockets on his top

535
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,040
And put the spells in different pockets

536
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,480
Then you'll be fine

537
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,200
Check out the corpses at the back

538
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,120
See if they're alright?

539
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,800
Yes

540
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,800
Fei, this is the "Chants of vampire Fist"

541
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,120
I've written it all here

542
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,800
Xiaoyuan doesn't have a good memory

543
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,320
He is often forgetful

544
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,560
If you run into any trouble...

545
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,960
You can remind me the style with this

546
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,640
Follow me

547
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,200
No matter where your hometown is

548
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,920
With me, Fan Zhengyuan

549
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,240
I'll make sure
you return home safe and sound

550
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,280
Water

551
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,040
Your turn

552
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,240
Drink

553
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,320
Xiaoyuan...

554
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,200
Master, it's dirty. Can I drink it?

555
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,800
There's nothing to be afraid of

556
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,440
Spit it out

557
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,880
Xiaoyuan

558
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,280
Fei, what's this all about?

559
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,800
The corpses are alright

560
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,920
Him...

561
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,320
The bald one is a bit strange

562
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,440
It must have been an untimely death

563
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,240
Continue

564
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,240
Come

565
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,360
Come here

566
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,160
Up, walk, turn, pause, stop.
Cross the bridge

567
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,080
What are you looking at? Turn away

568
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,080
Fei

569
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,840
Don't run around

570
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,280
Help

571
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,120
Help

572
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,640
Help

573
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,000
Don't come near

574
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,200
Get down

575
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,160
I don't want to

576
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,040
Just get down, it's alright

577
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,960
Xiaoyuan

578
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,760
Get down

579
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,600
I'm afraid

580
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,280
Get down, let go...

581
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,640
Fei, don't move

582
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,880
If you move, they will hop

583
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,040
Why?

584
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,680
You've got the spell on your back,
don't move

585
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,560
Xiaoyuan

586
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,000
What's the matter with you?

587
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,680
It's such a mess!

588
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,400
It's not me, it's her

589
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,640
You

590
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,640
You know she's new in the business

591
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,360
You should teach her properly

592
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,280
It's late, you better hurry

593
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,040
Yes

594
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,600
Speak up

595
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,680
What?

596
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,000
Haven't I taught you?

597
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,200
The dead's on the road

598
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,680
The living stays away...

599
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,960
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

600
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,840
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

601
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,640
Fei

602
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,360
Fei, why are you running?

603
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,440
I'm scared

604
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,400
There's nothing to be afraid of

605
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,000
They are all fine

606
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,680
But them...

607
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,680
What?

608
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,960
They are hopping quite well

609
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,240
You'll get used to this soon

610
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,640
Another thing

611
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,480
They're scared when crossing bridges

612
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,080
You must pay more attention

613
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,640
...when crossing bridges

614
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,280
Right

615
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,160
What is it?

616
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,560
This bald one makes the most trouble

617
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,360
Don't scare me

618
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,240
Don't be afraid, I'm here

619
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,440
Right... hurry up

620
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:20,640
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

621
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,880
Mr. Zhou

622
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,760
No news regarding Zhang Jie these few days

623
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,440
Fear not.
I'm not scared though I'm a robber

624
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,600
And you're an officer!

625
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,000
Stop kidding

626
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,760
We've been working well together
these few years

627
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,720
My boss didn't know anything about it

628
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,040
But the deal last year was such a mess

629
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,200
My deputy Zhang Jie found out about it

630
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,520
I wanted to bribe him, but then...

631
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,680
It's your fault

632
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,400
You couldn't bribe your own deputy

633
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,880
But then you've framed him and...

634
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,240
got him sentenced for life imprisonment

635
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,800
How could he escape from jail?

636
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,920
How could you let that happen?

637
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,120
You're all useless

638
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:14,880
Yes

639
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,600
A safe journey, rest in peace

640
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,720
Live in nirvana, Ouyang Zhenren

641
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,200
Ouyang Zhenren

642
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,320
Fifteen dollars and fifty cents

643
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,720
Why the extra 50 cents?

644
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,400
That's the fee for placing him
in the coffin

645
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,600
What a rip off

646
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,680
You want me to call him up?

647
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,040
So that you can carry him inside?

648
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,680
Fine... 50 cents it is

649
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,320
50 cents

650
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,560
Happy now?

651
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,760
You want me to close it up?

652
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,640
Yes

653
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,760
Another dollar

654
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,440
Another dollar?

655
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,240
A filial son in the family?

656
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,080
No

657
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,000
2 extra if I'll pretend to be
the filial son

658
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:08,800
Two dollars?

659
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,800
50 cents for tears

660
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,400
50 cents?

661
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,240
50 cents for a runny nose

662
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:11,920
Another 50 cents?

663
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,000
50 cents for lowering the head

664
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,440
50 cents

665
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,000
That will cost you four fifty together

666
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,360
Go to hell

667
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,920
What is it, Fei?

668
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,080
You know, the bald one...

669
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,480
What's with the bald one?

670
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,280
What is it?

671
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,560
Follow me

672
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,920
Here, he...

673
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,840
Aren't they all over there?

674
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,680
What's with him?

675
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,000
The urine...

676
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,280
Did you pee?

677
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,080
It was the bald one

678
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,640
What's the matter with you?

679
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,400
Don't be funny. Corpses don't pee

680
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,320
I... he did

681
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,520
I saw him standing here

682
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,200
You

683
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,120
You lied. It was you!

684
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,360
You don't trust me?

685
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:44,040
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

686
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,800
The dead's on the road...

687
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,560
What's wrong?

688
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,560
Nothing, gone

689
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:43,400
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

690
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,680
Stop running

691
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,680
Wang

692
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
Go back, Wang

693
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,000
Hey, give it back

694
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,840
What?

695
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,880
Don't try anything

696
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,960
You stole my chicken

697
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,240
Otherwise Wang wouldn't go after you

698
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:18,800
Bullshit

699
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,400
I didn't steal your chicken

700
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,680
You're very rude, chicken snatcher

701
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,120
Stop it

702
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,040
I'll beat you up good

703
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,840
Stop it, Xiaoyuan. After them

704
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,840
Stop moving

705
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,080
You stole my chicken
and told me not to move?

706
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,320
Stop it

707
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,800
Stop it

708
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,280
Five, four...

709
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,280
Xiaoyuan, the bald one's gone

710
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,720
Catch him

711
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,920
Hurry

712
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,280
Run after him, hurry!

713
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,920
Watch out for fire

714
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,080
vampire

715
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,040
Sorry, I didn't mean to run into you

716
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,560
Please forgive me

717
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,400
I didn't mean to run into you

718
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,400
What is it?

719
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,600
That was quick?

720
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,680
I'm not a vampire, I'm a corpse herder

721
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,840
Then that was...

722
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,040
You saw the bald one?

723
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:39,960
Where is he?

724
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,240
I was heralding the time;
as I walked up...

725
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,280
What?

726
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,560
vampire!

727
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,000
Where have you been?

728
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,640
Crazy

729
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,920
Where're my spells?

730
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,480
What is it?

731
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,840
It's fine

732
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,840
We're close to the Long Family village

733
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,080
We can deliver a corpse there

734
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,600
Master...

735
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,760
What is it?

736
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,640
We've delivered the corpse

737
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,240
There's something wrong

738
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,480
What?

739
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,600
Go take a look yourself

740
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,160
Right, go ahead...

741
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,720
Stop pulling me

742
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,600
Don't go

743
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,440
What about me?

744
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,600
Stay here

745
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,000
Hurry

746
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,320
Hurry

747
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,440
Not this one, over there

748
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,760
Excuse me

749
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,000
I know what to do

750
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,440
Keep quiet

751
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,120
What's wrong?

752
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,080
His father died

753
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,400
Does he look like his father?

754
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,600
I don't know how he looked like

755
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,880
How would I know?

756
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Father and son may not look alike

757
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,920
I think he could be your dad

758
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,680
Could be?

759
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,200
He's not

760
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,320
I don't care

761
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,480
Maybe your mom slept with someone else...

762
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,040
and had you two

763
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,440
You want us to beat you up?

764
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,560
Stop it

765
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,080
Be fair

766
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,080
How old does the corpse look like?

767
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,440
Say, in his twenties

768
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,320
And them?

769
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,320
In their thirties

770
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,000
That's not possible, is it?

771
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,760
Maybe you've got it wrong?

772
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,160
No it isn't possible

773
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,960
I've got a few corpses over there

774
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,480
Come with me

775
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,080
One of them could be your dad?

776
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,920
What about this one?

777
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,760
Keep it,
if none of them over there is right

778
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,040
Keep this as the body

779
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,720
Xiaoyuan

780
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,920
Ghost!

781
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,080
What is it?

782
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,520
Come here

783
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,120
Filial sons

784
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,840
The bald vampire...

785
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,440
The bald vampire

786
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,240
Could be their father!

787
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,640
Come take a look

788
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,000
Look closer

789
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,000
Is he?

790
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,720
No

791
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,680
Another thing

792
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,400
My dad had a moustache

793
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,080
A moustache?

794
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,560
You should have told me earlier

795
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,480
Look over there

796
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,040
Right, this is our late father

797
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,400
This is your lucky day

798
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,080
Had we dropped him off
at the previous stop...

799
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,880
You wouldn't have been able to pick!

800
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,240
Disciple

801
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,160
Up

802
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,120
Fei, I didn't mean to barge in

803
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,080
Really? Why did you rush in?

804
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,240
I thought you couldn't reach

805
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,920
That's why I handed it to you

806
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,040
Oh really?

807
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,440
I didn't mean it

808
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,880
You dressed as a man

809
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,280
Sometimes I forget

810
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,400
Enough...

811
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,240
We can't get on the road during the day

812
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,320
We must go at night

813
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,120
Let's sleep for a while

814
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,040
Just a while

815
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,360
Do we really need this?

816
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,360
Yes unless you want to sleep over there

817
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,280
Mr. Zhou

818
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,760
We've checked every inn in this town

819
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,680
There're no strangers

820
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,800
Zhang Jie has escaped over a month

821
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,880
There's no way I can't find him

822
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,080
Maybe he knows he can't hide

823
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,600
Maybe he's gone to a far off place

824
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,280
Not Zhang Jie

825
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,720
He knows about our deals

826
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,840
They all happened around this town

827
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,600
So I'm sure he'll come here

828
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,440
I've found out that

829
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,160
Zhang Jie has learnt from Master Yan

830
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,120
The style is called...

831
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,680
The Eagle Fists

832
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,240
If he's really on his way here

833
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,800
There're many checkpoints on the way

834
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,760
There's no way that he can make it

835
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,280
I don't believe he's that smart

836
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,920
He couldn't have sneaked in

837
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,760
Unless he's a fairy or a ghost

838
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,640
What did you say?

839
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,440
A fairy or a ghost

840
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,240
Ghost?

841
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,280
Ghost...

842
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:24,080
That's it!

843
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,840
That's the only way he could make it

844
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,240
This inn is for the corpse herders

845
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,760
There's a morgue at the back

846
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,960
Maybe we should start from here

847
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,640
Good

848
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,520
Have you found a girl?

849
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,440
Yes, she's waiting in the room

850
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:09,560
Open them

851
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,440
Yes

852
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,800
Hold on, you can't touch them like this

853
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,440
You must use the incantation

854
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,800
Otherwise they will go berserk

855
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,560
Do you know how?

856
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,080
No

857
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,400
Call the corpse herders here

858
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:33,920
Yes

859
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,280
Get out

860
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,000
Don't be afraid

861
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,800
Hurry

862
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,160
Open up

863
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,200
Who is it?

864
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,040
Are you a corpse herder?

865
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:51,920
Yes

866
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,040
Come with us, the boss wants a word

867
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,240
Who's the boss?

868
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,080
Hurry

869
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,440
What if I don't go?

870
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,520
You can go to jail

871
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,840
And stay there for 30 years

872
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,400
Seriously?

873
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,640
Hurry

874
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,440
I'll be back soon

875
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,360
Go

876
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,320
What are you doing? You can't touch them

877
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,000
Are those yours?

878
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,640
Yes

879
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:30,360
Open

880
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,160
Open them?

881
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,040
Yes

882
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,560
The incantation

883
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,480
Right...

884
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,840
I don't have the spells with me

885
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,840
Why not?

886
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,360
I didn't know what you want from me

887
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,440
Borrow from them

888
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,840
Please help me, Mr. Wang

889
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,440
Sure

890
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,600
Is that all?

891
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,400
There's more

892
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,080
Where?

893
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,040
All buried

894
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,800
Nonsense

895
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,720
Are you done?

896
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,680
There's nothing, boss

897
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,520
What are you doing?

898
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:10,840
Where are you going?

899
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,640
Something's strange at the window

900
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,840
Hey, what are you doing?

901
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,480
Who is it?

902
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,080
Fei, it's me. Open up

903
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,800
What happened?

904
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,960
What did they want?

905
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,560
They called us outside...

906
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,160
to check on the corpses

907
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,640
They suspect that there's a live one

908
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,200
Live man pretending to be a corpse?!

909
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,000
What is it?

910
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,800
Nothing

911
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,000
Hurry then, let's go

912
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,480
You are saying...

913
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,400
He was looking for something
at the window

914
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,920
Then he fell

915
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,560
Just like that?

916
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,240
Yes, could be a stroke

917
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,600
It's black magic more likely

918
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:44,840
Black magic?

919
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,640
Let her go

920
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,800
Keep your mouth shut about this

921
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,920
Or you'll die

922
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,480
I understand

923
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,320
Get out

924
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,040
Zhang Jie did it

925
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,600
Look, Xu wasn't a weak person

926
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,240
and he killed him so easily

927
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,320
And this must be the Eagle fist

928
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:24,680
The dead's on the road,
the living stays away

929
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,480
Fei, the spell for crossing the bridge

930
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,760
The incantation

931
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,480
Or they'll fall into the water

932
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,600
Hurry

933
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,200
vampire...

934
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,160
Xiaoyuan

935
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,840
Here

936
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,440
I can't stand up

937
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,840
Hurry

938
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,240
I can't

939
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,560
Are you alright, Fei?

940
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,240
The vampires?

941
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,520
Over there

942
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,840
We'll catch that one, quick

943
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,000
Stop

944
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,440
Fei, get the spell to stop them, hurry

945
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,880
Where are they?

946
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,920
In the pockets, hurry

947
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,880
Which one? Where?

948
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,920
Thanks

949
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,400
Have some tea

950
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,960
It's alright.
We've to go to the next village

951
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,360
We've got work to do

952
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,680
Xiaoyuan, but we don't have any corpses

953
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,040
We're off now

954
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:57,920
Thanks

955
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,200
20, 25, 30, 35

956
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,520
42 to 46 years old stay away

957
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:08,120
Hurry, the dead's back to
its original position

958
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,160
Hurry

959
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,440
Lie down

960
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,640
My son

961
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,040
You can't look at this, go

962
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,600
Into the coffin

963
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:33,440
The dead's calm and safe, go

964
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,840
Be careful

965
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,240
I want to take a look at him

966
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:48,000
I'm not finished yet

967
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:57,960
The soul enters nirvana, rests in peace

968
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:03,600
All family members pay their last respects

969
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,440
The living energy is too strong. Back off

970
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,440
Back off

971
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,240
Hurry, Fei

972
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,440
Prepare to close the coffin

973
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,640
Please turn your heads

974
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:31,440
Don't take a peek; for your own sake

975
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,200
I'm not done yet

976
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,360
You're alive!

977
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,960
You can't listen to my spells

978
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,400
You will be cursed

979
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,640
Back off

980
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,760
Son, you're leaving me just like this?

981
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,640
He won't be back

982
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,720
He was alright when he left

983
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,400
And now he's dead

984
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,000
No

985
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,840
I want to take a look at him

986
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,840
You can't

987
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,240
If I don't take it off,
I can't look at him

988
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,240
How do I know that's my son?

989
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,840
I'll put a spell first. Back off

990
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,360
Back off

991
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,840
Heaven and earth work their wonders

992
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,640
There's a black cloud in the sunny sky

993
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,040
Your mom wants to see you

994
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,400
Please, master

995
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,200
Think of something

996
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,480
Heaven and earth work their wonders

997
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,840
Alright, it's done. Take a look

998
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,240
I can't tell when he's like this

999
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,840
This is the rule

1000
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,440
Because you're alive

1001
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,840
If something happens to you in the future

1002
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,760
It's not my fault

1003
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,400
My goodness!

1004
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,880
He's gone.
There's nothing we can do about it

1005
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Men, cover the coffin

1006
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:42,560
Don't

1007
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,040
Not yet

1008
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,600
Hurry, master

1009
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,040
She's heartbroken

1010
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,280
Nail it

1011
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,240
Nail... hurry

1012
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,320
It's become a monster!

1013
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:19,920
Hey

1014
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,800
Fei, it wasn't easy

1015
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,400
When they're about to nail the cover

1016
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,480
I was really scared

1017
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,840
You think I'm an idiot?

1018
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,240
I'd have jumped even if you didn't yell

1019
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,240
What about the next delivery?

1020
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:47,600
That's easy. Shave the head

1021
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,120
And repeat what we did

1022
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,640
Then we can go back to the master

1023
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,000
Back?

1024
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,000
Of course

1025
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,080
Fei, if you don't want to get married...

1026
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,160
You should just tell your dad

1027
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,120
I mean, you can't follow me around

1028
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,200
...as if you were my wife

1029
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,320
You...

1030
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,600
You are like a tigress

1031
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,560
Stop it

1032
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,520
Stop running

1033
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,680
Zhou Qiantai

1034
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,360
Who are you?

1035
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,720
Answer me

1036
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,680
This thing

1037
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,720
vampire's dress

1038
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,400
vampire...

1039
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,240
vampire!

1040
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,680
What's going on?

1041
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,080
He's no vampire, he's Zhang Jie!

1042
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,120
If you want to live

1043
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,040
Tell me where Zhou Qiantai is, speak up!

1044
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:50,880
Speak up!

1045
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,160
He's at home

1046
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,200
Zhou Qiantai

1047
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,160
Zhang Jie, you escaped from the prison

1048
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,120
Passed through so many check points

1049
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,720
I'm impressed

1050
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,920
Zhou Qiantai, you and my boss Bi Yingheng

1051
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,400
collaborated in robberies and murders

1052
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,600
And you framed me for those crimes

1053
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,080
You wanted to kill me
by bribing the guards

1054
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,880
I knew that someone would...

1055
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
let you out from the prison

1056
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,840
You can't kill a decent man that easily

1057
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,360
In order to clear my name

1058
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,480
I will arrest you

1059
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,920
Stop it, don't kill him

1060
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,120
I need to find out who set him free

1061
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,320
Tie him up

1062
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,400
Fei, do you know what you're doing?

1063
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,480
Yes, I have done it many times

1064
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,080
I helped my grandpa to shave his beard

1065
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,120
Alright

1066
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,400
Go

1067
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,240
Go

1068
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,040
Come on

1069
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,840
The bald one, Fei

1070
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,040
Bald one?

1071
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,440
Hold on...

1072
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,760
Wait a minute

1073
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,640
Thanks for catching him

1074
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:15,840
Move over

1075
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,720
You can't tie up a vampire

1076
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:19,720
Let me practice the magic arts

1077
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,200
Are you joking, you asshole

1078
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,200
Don't bother me when I work

1079
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,640
You must be his accomplice

1080
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,800
What are you talking about?

1081
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,000
I need to deliver him to his family

1082
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,440
Is he really a vampire?

1083
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,000
Of course he is

1084
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,000
He's a convict.
You helped him pass checkpoints

1085
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,520
Nonsense. He's a corpse
under the Chen Wu band

1086
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,520
I have to take him back

1087
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,720
Who is Chen Wu?

1088
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,880
My master

1089
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,360
Fei

1090
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,320
Fei, the bald one's running away

1091
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,320
Catch him

1092
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,160
Chants of the vampire Fists

1093
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,240
vampire revives

1094
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,760
vampire...

1095
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,440
Xiaoyuan, help me

1096
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,120
They're trying to kill the bald vampire

1097
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,360
Don't hurt him. I need to make a delivery

1098
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,840
Fei, what's next?

1099
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,920
vampire greets the moon

1100
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,360
It's over

1101
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,840
What have you got to say?

1102
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,640
Hurry...

1103
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,040
vampire lifts his leg

1104
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,960
Let's go

1105
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:15,640
Stop running

1106
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,760
vampire turns his head back

1107
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,720
vampire goes out of the cave

1108
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,440
Go

1109
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,560
Let him go

1110
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,560
Revives

1111
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,240
Untie me

1112
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,840
You can talk?

1113
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,360
vampires can't talk

1114
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,960
He's human. Untie him!

1115
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,240
That kid's pretty good

1116
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,960
With Zhang Jie's Eagle Fist, we won't win

1117
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,800
Let's go

1118
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,240
Go

1119
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,000
Zhou Qiantai

1120
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,440
Stop it

1121
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,200
You're mine

1122
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,480
Stay here

1123
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,560
Why are you doing this?

1124
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,520
You're one of my two missing vampires

1125
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,600
I'm no vampire

1126
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,400
I don't care

1127
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,280
I must make the delivery

1128
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,120
Stop it

1129
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,360
Fei, the chants

1130
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,000
They're all gone

1131
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,400
You shouldn't have let them go

1132
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,040
This is Zhou Qiantai's territory

1133
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,040
I think you've got yourself
into big trouble

1134
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,080
There's nothing to worry about

1135
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,840
Zhou Qiantai works
with corrupted officials...

1136
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,360
I haven't done anything illegal, you have

1137
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,400
I haven't either

1138
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,000
I was set up by Zhou Qiantai

1139
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,480
Just like Chen Wu the Magic Fist

1140
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,240
My master?

1141
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,120
Chen Wu was very famous ten years ago

1142
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,920
Zhou Qiantai... a relentless robber

1143
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,760
Once, he committed a crime
close to Wu's...

1144
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,000
martial arts school; and got Chen framed

1145
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,720
Chen Wu was in a deep shit back then

1146
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,800
And he gave up his hopes

1147
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,440
No wonder my master spends his time with

1148
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,000
vampires and gambling though
he's very skilled

1149
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,480
Why did you hit me?

1150
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,920
You were in my way

1151
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,080
and you let Zhou Qiantai go

1152
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,480
That was earlier

1153
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,320
And now you're my vampire

1154
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,400
I must catch you

1155
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:38,760
I'm no vampire

1156
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,360
Then why did you pretend to be one?

1157
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:41,720
To pass through the checkpoints

1158
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,400
I don't care

1159
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:57,840
Stop it

1160
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,440
Forget it...

1161
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,440
Please put on your pants

1162
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,640
Pants

1163
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,640
Hurry...

1164
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,240
Sorry

1165
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,040
Wait for us

1166
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,560
Xiaoyuan, have you found him?

1167
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,840
Not yet. Where's the bald one?

1168
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,200
The bald one...

1169
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,160
Out...

1170
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,640
Bald one...

1171
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,560
Bald one...

1172
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,880
Bald one...

1173
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,080
Have you found him?

1174
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,480
No

1175
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,240
Then why did you show up suddenly?

1176
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,600
You scared me

1177
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,200
I thought
something had happened to you two

1178
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,640
What could have happened?

1179
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,160
We can't find that vampire

1180
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,280
That's why we called you

1181
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,280
...to ask whether you've got him

1182
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,400
Strange! After we crossed the bridge...

1183
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,160
One went east, one went north

1184
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,840
We've found you,
then the one to the east...

1185
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:33,960
must be somewhere close by

1186
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,640
Let's try to find him

1187
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,640
Sure

1188
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,120
You promised me you will...

1189
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,720
let me go when you've found the vampire

1190
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:42,960
We'll see about that

1191
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,600
Do you remember the spells I taught you?

1192
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,240
Yes

1193
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,040
Alright, let's go

1194
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,040
Fallen leaves back to roots, up

1195
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,520
Return to your home town, up

1196
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,520
Return to your home town, up

1197
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:34,920
Got it

1198
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,720
Xiaoyuan, I'm off now

1199
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,760
He's no vampire

1200
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,400
Freeze

1201
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:46,840
Run

1202
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,520
Freeze

1203
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,440
Zhang Jie, though you're smart

1204
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,080
But you can't run this time

1205
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:06,680
Freeze

1206
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,120
Stop it

1207
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,840
Bi Yingheng,
I'll take all the responsibility

1208
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,920
I'm the only one who's involved

1209
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,000
Let them go

1210
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,960
Who are they?

1211
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,280
Corpse herders

1212
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,120
A girl dressed as a man

1213
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,240
Guilty also

1214
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,320
What? It's just that I'm dressed as a lad

1215
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,440
Let's see whether you've done a good job

1216
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,920
Stop it...

1217
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,200
vampire

1218
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,680
Fire

1219
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,280
Don't shoot

1220
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,840
Help me

1221
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:48,040
Hurry! What's with you?

1222
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,600
Help me

1223
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,520
Don't shoot

1224
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,760
Don't shoot!

1225
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,680
Don't run

1226
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:13,880
C'mon, be quick

1227
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,200
Fei, help the bald one

1228
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,000
The chants

1229
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:05,760
vampire chases the cloud

1230
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,160
vampire looks into a mirror

1231
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,240
vampire looks into the moon

1232
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,480
vampire...

1233
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:16,840
vampire...

1234
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:19,640
vampire...

1235
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,160
vampire...

1236
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:45,760
vampire...

1237
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,560
Xiaoyuan

1238
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,320
Ah Fei, where's that useless official?

1239
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,760
vampire's somersault

1240
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,280
vampire closes the door

1241
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,120
vampire lies in the coffin

1242
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,840
That's enough, brother Fan

1243
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,520
I'll take them back

1244
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:48,920
To clear my name

1245
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,920
As well as to absolve your master's

1246
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,000
You're leaving just like this?

1247
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,640
You haven't paid me for my service

1248
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,240
But I'm no vampire

1249
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,240
You want to fool me, eh?

1250
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,680
Help me

1251
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,080
Move over

1252
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:24,880
Master

1253
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:34,920
What's with him?

1254
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,120
Master, we have...

1255
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,720
Placed your bets?

1256
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:51,960
Yes

1257
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:53,360
Let's see

1258
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,840
Banker wins

1259
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:06,320
What on earth?

1260
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,080
Any more pebbles?

1261
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:09,040
No

1262
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,960
We've lost, let's go

1263
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,400
Hey, come back

1264
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,520
Master, why are you gambling for pebbles?

1265
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:21,000
You see, now I've already got back
what I lost
