1
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:34,756
First and 10 on the New York 32.
Malone hands off for a one-yard gain.

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,554
Can't establish their running game
because Washington...

3
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:40,459
- God will help you.
- God owes me a quarter pound.

4
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,430
Mince and mash the garlic into a paste.

5
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:46,571
- I seek...
- Go, Buster, go!

6
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:48,637
- Reputed crime boss Gaitano Cesare...

7
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,867
...once again avoided prison
when a mistrial was declared today...

8
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,273
...in his eight-week long
RICO prosecution.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,142
Allegedly responsible
for over 200 murders...

10
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,114
...Cesare has yet to spend one day
behind bars.

11
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,013
Mr. Eugene Gordlock...

12
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:05,622
...a witness who repeatedly asked
the judge to be recused from the case...

13
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:08,225
...was gunned down
just a few hours earlier.

14
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:12,158
We had the opportunity to speak
with Mr. Gordlock's mother.

15
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:46,557
They shot him right in our front yard.

16
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,489
My dear, sweet little boy.

17
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:51,424
The pained words
of a grieving woman...

18
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,396
...left all alone in a city outraged
by these developments.

19
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:57,592
But with no concrete evidence
of tampering...

20
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,498
...and with Mr. Gordlock
now dead...

21
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:45,948
Do I fix your makeup for you?

22
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,947
- What?
- Here's Billy the Beaut.

23
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,454
The captain should have sent me
out here with 30, 40 men...

24
00:03:57,663 --> 00:04:01,292
...to raze this bloody get-out-of-jail party.
Instead, I'm stuck here with you.

25
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,695
Well, he might come out tonight.

26
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,427
As a matter of fact,
I'm sure he'll show up.

27
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,368
And what are you gonna do?

28
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:11,234
I'm gonna bring him in.

29
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:16,542
You know, you kill me, Soap. Let's just
say if you can make this happen...

30
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:18,841
...why would you?

31
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,211
He does to those bastards...

32
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,546
...what me and you
can only fantasize about.

33
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:25,648
Ink, keep your nose clean.

34
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:27,257
Yeah.

35
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,791
Sure thing, Pops.

36
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,165
Hey.

37
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,335
Look, you know, it's just...

38
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:44,840
- Take it easy in there, okay?
- Nicky, what am I gonna do?

39
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:46,671
Give the old guy a heart attack?

40
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:56,755
- Go on, beat it.
- Give me uno minuto.

41
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:03,951
You handled
the witness situation perfectly.

42
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,957
No sweat, Uncle G.

43
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:12,362
- You look great.
- The hell I do.

44
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:14,334
I shit in a bag, for chrissake.

45
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,270
Hey, saves you a trip to the can, right?

46
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:20,843
You came to discuss a private matter.

47
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,306
Down at the docks!

48
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,038
Right. Yeah. Cristu Bulat.

49
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:27,116
I hear he's a sick fuck.
Fresh off the boat.

50
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,516
Cristu's bringing in a shipment
and he needs a safe port.

51
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:33,692
I've arranged for my customs guy
Simmons to be on that night.

52
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:36,588
The union boys'll be there to unload.
Our cut's 10 mil.

53
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,730
- We won'T break a sweat.
- Ten mil?

54
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,432
- Fuck's Cristu shipping?
- I don'T know.

55
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,134
It's some kind of biological package.

56
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:48,135
A biological package.

57
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,672
I fucking knew it.

58
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:53,401
Probably going up to the ragheads
in Queens.

59
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:57,708
- Cristu guaranteed it's leaving the city.
- We don'T touch that kind of shit.

60
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,510
In case your memory's going
with your bodily functions...

61
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,017
...you might remember
I'm the top earner here.

62
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:05,713
- I'm not stupid.
- Stupid?

63
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:11,419
You're as shithouse crazy
as your brother, Loony Bin Jim.

64
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,497
I should have had the both of you
locked away.

65
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,225
One more word
about my brother, I swear to Christ I'll...

66
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:20,671
You'll what?
You make one move, you greasy fuck.

67
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:23,205
Hey, let's just all calm down here,
okay?

68
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:29,042
I've put out a big spread out here.

69
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:32,445
So come on, boys, eat up.

70
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,222
We're not eating with the old shitbag,
understand?

71
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,085
Pittsy, pour me a drink.

72
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,029
What the fuck?

73
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:35,238
Pittsy!

74
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,353
Let's go.

75
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:00,692
All right, let's split up.

76
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,366
Shouldn'T we wait for backup?

77
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:17,681
Police! Freeze!

78
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:29,316
Listen, Billy Russoti's getting away.

79
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,995
Silver Rover.

80
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,460
You might wanna head down
to the docks first.

81
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:45,705
Shit, that hurts.

82
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:51,108
- What happened to you?
- Your Punisher.

83
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:54,649
He disarmed me, held me at gunpoint
then he stole our damn ride.

84
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:57,083
- Where were you, huh?
- I knew he would come.

85
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,814
Hey, let me get your statement.

86
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,585
Come on, Saffiotti, tell me everything...

87
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,659
How did it go down, huh?

88
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,305
I'm sorry about your family, Billy.

89
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:36,317
- Well, maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
- What?

90
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,580
It was time for me to take over anyway.

91
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,419
Thanks to The Punisher,
I don'T even get my fucking hands dirty.

92
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:46,294
Where's your boss, then?

93
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,764
- What the fuck's he doing here?
- Relax. I asked him to come.

94
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,802
My man. How are you doing?

95
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:57,703
- Who the fuck are these finooks?
- These are couple of my colleagues.

96
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:00,673
They are very, very gifted delivery men.

97
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,179
No mountain too high,
no river too deep.

98
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:08,716
All right, all right, all right, enough.

99
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,548
- Pittsy, get me some money.
- Time to go to work.

100
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:12,951
We're running low, boss.

101
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:15,752
We picked up 200K
from the Lucciano construction site.

102
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:19,522
I had to launder it through the Pussycat
Lounge. Like you told me, remember?

103
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:22,029
Well, bring it back tomorrow.

104
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:24,065
- You got it, boss.
- Here.

105
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:27,466
That's 20 rolls of hundreds,
that's a grand each. All counted.

106
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,299
Head for the port, do your thing...

107
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:31,908
...get over the security fence,
hand out the money.

108
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:35,607
Where are you going?

109
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:39,772
Would it be all right
if I take the roof instead of the door?

110
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:42,715
- Whatever.
- You're a fucking saint.

111
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:15,114
Hey, what's the matter?

112
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:53,480
Oh, fuck.

113
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:55,116
What the fuck was that?

114
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,295
Agent down. Repeat, agent down.
Fuck.

115
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:59,430
I'll check it out, boss.

116
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:14,737
- Pops!
- I'll take care of it. You get the guards.

117
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,238
Pittsy!

118
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:34,898
Fuck, you bastard. Fuck.
Fuck you, Castle!

119
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,026
Come on, Castle!

120
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:44,738
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you, Castle, you fucking...

121
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:50,078
Fuck you, Castle! Fuck!
My fucking face!

122
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:53,217
Pittsy! Pittsy! Pittsy!

123
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:56,249
Fuck, my fucking face!

124
00:14:56,454 --> 00:15:00,857
Fuck! Pittsy! Pittsy! Pittsy!

125
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,925
There he is!

126
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:08,090
Move! Move! Move!

127
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,927
Up there!

128
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:11,725
Move!

129
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:18,675
Up there!

130
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:25,413
Fuck!

131
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,949
Up there!

132
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,104
- FBI. Drop your weapons.
- Oh, shit. Shit.

133
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:58,839
You two, up the stairs.
Team 1, on me.

134
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,406
Don'T move!

135
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:03,281
FBI! Put your weapons down.

136
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:02,964
We got a live one!

137
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:05,404
Take care of those
five yards in every direction.

138
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,068
Billy the Beaut.

139
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:09,246
Yo, you say Billy the Beaut?

140
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:12,478
- Not anymore, huh?
- Bring him down, maybe he'll live.

141
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,953
- Wait a minute.
- Repeat, Nicholas Donatelli Jr.

142
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:22,957
Reach Donatelli's family.
Can you ask Miller if...

143
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:26,563
The Lord is compassion and love.

144
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:30,326
Slow to anger and rich in mercy.

145
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:33,436
He does not treat us
according to our sins...

146
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:36,607
...nor repay us according to our faults.

147
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:39,504
As parents have compassion
on their children...

148
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:42,839
...the Lord has pity on those
who fear him.

149
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:47,575
For he knows of what we are made,
he remembers that we are dust.

150
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,779
As for us, our days are like grass.

151
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,481
We flower like the flower of the field.

152
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:57,225
The wind blows and we are gone.

153
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,626
And our place never sees us again.

154
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:11,772
I'm so sorry for your loss.

155
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,341
Thank you.

156
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:26,755
Who compromised Donatelli?

157
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,222
Calm down, Budiansky,
it wasn'T anybody's fault.

158
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:32,885
None of us could foresee Castle opening
up hunting season on La Cosa Nostra.

159
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:34,121
Come on.

160
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:36,926
All right, look,
Donatelli sent us a message.

161
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,229
Said something big was gonna happen.
He asked for Homeland Security.

162
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:42,167
We ran 24-hour surveillance
on Russoti.

163
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:45,871
Just as we're about to find out
what is happening, Donatelli got shot.

164
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:48,477
Believe me,
no one is more pissed off than I am.

165
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,648
How is it we're not all over
Frank Castle?

166
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:53,283
Because we have
a real national security threat.

167
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:57,854
And the last time I checked, that tops
trying to nab some crazed vigilante.

168
00:19:58,256 --> 00:19:59,382
Go.

169
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:06,355
- Hey.
- Hey.

170
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:09,291
I'm gonna get this guy, Angie.

171
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,393
I promise you.

172
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,132
I heard the bureau
was sending a babysitter.

173
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:52,663
Liaison.

174
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,998
Thirty years on the force,
I still don'T know what that word means.

175
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,939
We have a certain way of doing things
here, Special Agent Budiansky.

176
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,271
Like letting mass murderers run free?

177
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:06,514
Four years
this Punisher's been wreaking havoc.

178
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:08,777
And you haven'T once caught a break.

179
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:12,923
I'm waist deep in shit around here
as you can plainly see.

180
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:14,958
Your buddies from the bureau
told me...

181
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,855
...the city
is under some kind of terror threat.

182
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:21,461
New Yorkers are a bit sensitive
about that, if you know what I mean.

183
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,395
I've got my men trying to find out...

184
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:26,069
...what your colleague came across
when he went under.

185
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:31,365
Maybe if you feds allowed us in on your
undercover operations once in a while...

186
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:35,740
...all of this could have been avoided.
- With all due respect, captain...

187
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:37,346
...that...

188
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:38,738
...is bullshit.

189
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,952
What if it had been your man
lying there?

190
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,314
In a pool of his own blood?

191
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:49,989
You Krispy Kreme motherfuckers would
be beating down every door in this city.

192
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:51,485
Captain.

193
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:53,493
Captain, you know what?

194
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:58,158
The Punisher Task Force
could use an extra man.

195
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:06,106
Room 12.

196
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,107
The basement.

197
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:30,693
Agent Budiansky? Did I get that right?

198
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:33,427
The captain told me
you were coming in.

199
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:36,140
Welcome to The Punisher Task Force.

200
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,705
I'm Detective Martin Soap.

201
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,540
Pleasure.

202
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:42,104
Make yourself at home.

203
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,948
You have a degree
in Behavioral Psychology?

204
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:46,844
Surprised?

205
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,541
That's okay. Most people are.

206
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:53,885
So, what do you actually do here?

207
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:55,825
Here?

208
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:58,393
This is ground zero.

209
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,731
I've shadowed his every step
for the last five years.

210
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:06,870
I've documented every murder
that fit his profile...

211
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,972
...and I've collected intelligence
on all known associates.

212
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:11,632
Take a look at this.

213
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:16,012
Six years ago...

214
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:19,809
...Frank Castle
was a Special Forces instructor.

215
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:24,316
And a simple family man.

216
00:24:24,522 --> 00:24:27,013
One day, he takes his wife and kids
for a picnic...

217
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:30,854
...and by chance or fate,
depending on which you believe in...

218
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:33,922
...they witnessed a mob execution.

219
00:24:34,465 --> 00:24:35,762
When they were discovered...

220
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,428
But Castle survived.

221
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:48,841
Since then, he's been taking down
one crime family after another.

222
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,014
I'm really close, Budiansky.

223
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:58,655
Only thing getting in my way
is some bad luck.

224
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,191
But I have a feeling
that's about to change.

225
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,354
You know, I've been waiting
for someone like you.

226
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:08,560
Take a look at some of the case files.

227
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:09,892
Get a lay of the land.

228
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:12,797
I'll get us a pie from Milano's.
Best pizza in the city.

229
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:14,628
Which drawer?

230
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,899
- What?
- The alleged Punisher murders.

231
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,337
All of them.

232
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,415
What do you want, Micro?

233
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:03,678
You ever heard of jihadi-blogger. Com?

234
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:05,856
I'm posing
as a one-armed Wahhabi warrior...

235
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:08,582
...who took a crap in a cave
next to Bin Laden.

236
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:11,261
I think I can score you
a couple of rocket launchers.

237
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:12,520
What do you want?

238
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:16,423
Haven'T seen you in a while.

239
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:20,365
Brought you some treats.

240
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:24,371
It's gun show season in Virginia.
No background checks, no problems.

241
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:29,737
That's too much, Frank.

242
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:32,208
Call it a retirement package.

243
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:36,849
I know this thing with the fed
is eating you up...

244
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,147
...but that doesn'T mean
you pack up your tent.

245
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:41,154
We all make mistakes, Frank.

246
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,623
You're fighting a war
against the assholes...

247
00:26:43,828 --> 00:26:46,353
...who slip through the raindrops,
who get away with it.

248
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,795
In any war, there's collateral damage.
You know that.

249
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:52,299
Collateral damage?

250
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:58,907
I killed an agent in the field.

251
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,305
One of the good guys.

252
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:03,746
He had a family.

253
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:05,873
You didn'T know.

254
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:10,750
I fucked up, Micro.

255
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:14,515
Now, please...

256
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:16,625
...just leave me alone.

257
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:35,369
Where the fuck's Nicky?

258
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:39,038
He...

259
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,308
...didn'T make it.

260
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:42,076
Nicky was a fucking rat.

261
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,049
For the feds.

262
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,591
What about my money?

263
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,089
We already went to his place
and tore it apart.

264
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,559
No sign of a safety deposit key
or nothing.

265
00:27:53,764 --> 00:27:55,629
Does he got any next of kin?

266
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:59,394
- Somebody to carry on the family name?
- Yeah.

267
00:27:59,603 --> 00:28:01,298
Something about a wife and a girl.

268
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:02,699
Good.

269
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:03,999
Let's look there.

270
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,573
You got it.

271
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:07,271
Hey, doc.

272
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,467
Where you been?

273
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,203
- Am I glad to see you.
- Hi, Billy.

274
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:13,275
Should've seen those fucking brascioles
at the clinic.

275
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:16,612
Must have bought their fucking
medical degrees off the Internet.

276
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,516
How did you end up at a free clinic?

277
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:20,623
Insurance said I missed a payment.

278
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,315
Can you fucking believe that?

279
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,924
Okay. Before we do this...

280
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:28,155
...I need you to understand the severity
of your injuries.

281
00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:30,764
You shouldn'T have been able
to survive this.

282
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:32,993
Well, that's why I'm here, doc.

283
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:36,105
I have the best plastic surgeon
in all of New York.

284
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:40,767
Your facial muscles, tendons,
bone structure, everything...

285
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:42,343
...was destroyed.

286
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:45,447
And there wasn'T a single square inch
of skin left intact.

287
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:47,512
Just take it off already.

288
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,850
Okay.

289
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:51,578
Let's do this.

290
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:55,225
I'm gonna need you
to sit forward a little bit.

291
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:56,682
All right.

292
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:02,225
Okay.

293
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:06,067
Polymers...

294
00:29:11,308 --> 00:29:14,766
...a few strategically placed
alloy plates...

295
00:29:16,947 --> 00:29:20,383
...and just a little bit of horse hide.

296
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:22,610
A little bit of what?

297
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,159
I need to talk to my doctor alone.

298
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:40,269
Yeah. Yeah, of course, Billy.

299
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:47,909
The fuck's the matter with you?
You can'T control yourself?

300
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:49,545
You know how sensitive he is.

301
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:53,478
I'm sorry, Pops, it's just, I've...
Have you ever seen anything so...?

302
00:29:53,684 --> 00:29:54,844
Just shut the fuck up.

303
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,872
You okay, boss?

304
00:30:24,815 --> 00:30:26,282
Much better. Thanks.

305
00:30:40,064 --> 00:30:42,032
I'll be in the car.

306
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,132
No more distractions.

307
00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:54,902
We need to focus on my goals.

308
00:30:55,112 --> 00:30:56,511
One:

309
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,176
We need to get my money back.

310
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:02,147
Two, we're gonna get rid
of Frank Castle.

311
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:04,446
But he took out, like, 30 of us.

312
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,681
I mean, how are we gonna kill him
before he'll kill us?

313
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:09,519
My brother will take care of that.

314
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:11,592
- Loony Bin Jim?
- Shut the fuck up.

315
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:14,863
His name is James.

316
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:18,967
Not Loony Bin Jim, not LBJ. James.

317
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,104
I'm sorry. It's a good idea.

318
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:23,637
Really, it is.

319
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,364
Don'T mind him.

320
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:29,307
He doesn'T think before he talks,
just like his mother.

321
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,775
Sorry about that, Billy.

322
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,673
Billy is dead.

323
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:35,885
From now on...

324
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:38,687
...you call me Jigsaw.

325
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:47,253
He's mine.

326
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,291
Hey, Billy, fuck you!

327
00:32:54,632 --> 00:32:56,725
Daddy!

328
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,969
How are we doing today,
Loony Bin Jim?

329
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,458
Yummy, yummy.

330
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,835
So good.

331
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:37,738
- What?
- Dr. Basner. Open up!

332
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:39,704
Yes, doctor.

333
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:00,653
Billy?

334
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:02,589
Is that you?

335
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:07,600
It is.

336
00:34:07,905 --> 00:34:11,602
You look fantastic, brother.

337
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,849
Ink, cut these off, now.

338
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:23,678
Pittsy, go open the doors
of every other cell...

339
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:27,345
...lead everybody out the front door.
- Sure thing, Billy.

340
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:28,718
Jigsaw.

341
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:31,658
I'll take care of this guy.

342
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,023
Oh, no, brother.

343
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:36,629
Fatso's mine.

344
00:34:37,835 --> 00:34:39,598
Of course.

345
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:45,271
I'm gonna get my applesauce back.

346
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:48,138
Did you know...

347
00:34:48,345 --> 00:34:52,714
...kidneys and applesauce
are a delicacy in Sweden?

348
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:55,983
Did you know that?

349
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,878
Yes.

350
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:05,856
Yummy, yummy, yummy
in my tummy, tummy, tummy.

351
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:09,626
No.

352
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:15,695
What do you say, boss?

353
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,931
- Stuff might come in handy.
- What for?

354
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:23,277
Well, in case he starts,
you know, not feeling so good.

355
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:30,215
I think he's doing just great.

356
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:04,879
You're in my light.

357
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,397
For the next time
someone gets in your light.

358
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,679
Step the fuck away from my little girl.

359
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:33,213
Mom, that's a dad word.

360
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:34,475
Go inside, Grace.

361
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:43,817
You're messing with the wrong family
on the wrong day, asshole.

362
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:49,389
You, you're...

363
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,867
What are you doing here?

364
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:54,196
What makes you think
you could come here?

365
00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:56,463
- You'll scare the girl.
- Shut up.

366
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:57,662
Shut your mouth.

367
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:02,841
- I'm sorry.
- I said shut up.

368
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,013
What's this?

369
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:09,447
Something to help out.

370
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,085
No.

371
00:37:11,288 --> 00:37:13,256
No, you don'T get to do that.

372
00:37:13,457 --> 00:37:17,120
You don'T get to shoot my husband
in cold blood and then stop at the ATM.

373
00:37:17,427 --> 00:37:18,689
It's for your daughter.

374
00:37:20,297 --> 00:37:23,232
This is what you deserve.

375
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:25,094
What you did to Nick.

376
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:31,038
Who punishes you?

377
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:36,571
He taught you how to shoot.

378
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:40,339
A good agent keeps his family safe...

379
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:42,849
...but he couldn'T always be here.

380
00:37:44,922 --> 00:37:47,322
He took you out to the range.

381
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,453
He showed you what to do.

382
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:55,062
This is where you do it.

383
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,698
Squeeze...

384
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,398
...don'T pull.

385
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:15,280
I can'T find my red pen.

386
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:21,683
Mom, I need it.

387
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:29,058
You take it.

388
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,371
Is this it, boss?

389
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:15,704
Yeah.

390
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:17,743
Nice, brother.

391
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:20,143
- Is it yours?
- Not yet.

392
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,376
Old Cesare used to rent it
to screw hookers.

393
00:39:23,587 --> 00:39:26,852
Let's go inside
before I freeze my fucking balls off.

394
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:46,173
What's the matter, Billy?

395
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,207
Just when I think I'm okay...

396
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:52,544
...I see my reflection somewhere...

397
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:56,951
...and I look horrible.

398
00:39:58,955 --> 00:40:01,253
What has he done to me?

399
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,285
No, no, no, don'T.

400
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:05,256
Don'T cry, brother.

401
00:40:05,462 --> 00:40:08,192
Everything is gonna be all right.

402
00:40:08,398 --> 00:40:11,026
I promise you two things:

403
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:13,964
One, I will find Castle...

404
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:19,268
...and I will kill him slowly and painfully.

405
00:40:19,476 --> 00:40:26,143
And two, you will never, ever
have to look at your reflection again...

406
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:29,079
...as long as you're with me.

407
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,179
You're not in Transylvania anymore,
Cristu.

408
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:41,016
We don'T talk vampire.

409
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:43,215
It's Russian.

410
00:41:45,662 --> 00:41:46,993
My man is concerned.

411
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:51,532
If Punisher can do this to your face...

412
00:41:51,735 --> 00:41:53,168
...what might he do to our deal?

413
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:58,002
The tongue stretches further
than most people think.

414
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:01,507
Ask your man
how he's gonna talk that shit...

415
00:42:01,711 --> 00:42:03,235
...when I pull it from his mouth.

416
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:07,713
Enough.

417
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:10,011
The Punisher is not a problem.

418
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,188
The docks are mine.

419
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:15,489
My looks have nothing to do with this.

420
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:17,284
Everybody...

421
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:21,260
...from the local security
to international customs is in my pocket.

422
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:26,500
Quite frankly, this job doesn'T get done
without me.

423
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:09,673
My most sincere apologies.

424
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,372
My father always say
never insult your host.

425
00:43:14,317 --> 00:43:15,750
Sounds like a reasonable man.

426
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,588
You don'T know of my father.

427
00:43:26,763 --> 00:43:28,526
Three days.

428
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:30,566
It has to be 12 million.

429
00:43:33,937 --> 00:43:35,097
We agree on 10.

430
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:36,731
We both know...

431
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,138
...that this biological shit
you're bringing in isn'T leaving the city.

432
00:43:42,145 --> 00:43:45,410
You're selling it
to the ragheads in Queens.

433
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:48,340
The ports have been crawling
with suits from Homeland.

434
00:43:48,551 --> 00:43:51,076
Gonna take a lot of payola
to keep it quiet.

435
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:05,659
Always knew you'd be a good boss,
Billy.

436
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,461
Thanks, brother.

437
00:44:49,946 --> 00:44:51,243
Latin Kings.

438
00:44:52,716 --> 00:44:54,081
Let him go, Frank.

439
00:44:54,284 --> 00:44:55,546
You know this piece of shit?

440
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,385
Ex piece of shit.

441
00:44:57,587 --> 00:44:58,884
Yeah.

442
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:00,920
He's a regular choirboy.

443
00:45:01,124 --> 00:45:03,092
- Fuck you, cracker.
- Language.

444
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:04,823
It's a genius racket.

445
00:45:05,028 --> 00:45:07,656
You know how the cops
always run those gun buy-backs?

446
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:09,559
Except they never work.

447
00:45:09,766 --> 00:45:13,566
Because what banger
is gonna trust a cop, right?

448
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,536
Well, these drive-by wack jobs,
they just love Carlos here.

449
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,271
They get one look at that ink...

450
00:45:20,477 --> 00:45:22,138
...and they know he's for real.

451
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:26,008
We get the guns off the street to you.

452
00:45:26,216 --> 00:45:29,049
Never once seen a banger
that could quit.

453
00:45:29,252 --> 00:45:30,719
Too fucking stupid.

454
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:33,581
He's straight, Frank.

455
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,849
Hey, Mom, Frank's here.

456
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:40,723
He says eat up, huh?

457
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,022
How's she doing?

458
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:44,762
Yeah, well.

459
00:45:46,102 --> 00:45:50,266
As long as she's got her cooking shows,
she's good.

460
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:51,906
It's the only thing she notices.

461
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:54,570
But, hey, that's something, right?

462
00:45:58,348 --> 00:46:00,145
Listen, l...

463
00:46:00,683 --> 00:46:04,084
I just came around to tell you
that I'm going out of town for a while.

464
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,118
Out of town?

465
00:46:10,627 --> 00:46:12,322
I'm sorry.

466
00:46:12,962 --> 00:46:15,726
I never thought of The Punisher
taking a long weekend.

467
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:17,929
I'm not planning on coming back.

468
00:46:19,169 --> 00:46:22,661
So I take it things didn'T go so well
at the Donatelli home?

469
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:27,601
Are you aware
that Billy Russoti survived?

470
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:29,838
I heard.

471
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:33,646
Let the cops take care of him.

472
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,080
You and I know
they got nothing on him.

473
00:46:36,286 --> 00:46:39,119
Their hands are tied.
This is where The Punisher comes in.

474
00:46:39,322 --> 00:46:42,348
This is why I believe in you,
why I supported you all these years.

475
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:45,687
You want me to tell you when
something happens to Mrs. Donatelli?

476
00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:47,328
That's what's gonna happen.

477
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,464
You don'T think
he's gonna go for revenge?

478
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:52,396
It's not a question of if,
it's a matter of when.

479
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,542
- Pull a couple of Berettas.
- For what?

480
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:08,742
Three...

481
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:09,941
...two...

482
00:47:10,153 --> 00:47:11,677
...one.

483
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,286
Russoti is the last one, then I'm done.

484
00:47:17,494 --> 00:47:18,825
From your lips to God's ears.

485
00:47:19,162 --> 00:47:20,527
You know where I can find him?

486
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,527
I don'T have a fix on him.

487
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:25,132
You wiped out his associates
that are known to me.

488
00:47:25,335 --> 00:47:26,825
I saw him with some new guys.

489
00:47:27,036 --> 00:47:29,664
Leader was black, dreadlocks.

490
00:47:29,873 --> 00:47:31,841
Did some acrobatic stuff over the roofs.

491
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:34,134
That's Maginty
and his urban free-flow gang.

492
00:47:34,344 --> 00:47:36,244
He's a mean motherfucker.

493
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:38,971
He's on a constant meth high.

494
00:47:46,256 --> 00:47:47,689
Well, come on.

495
00:47:48,124 --> 00:47:50,592
You wanna find this guy or not?

496
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:54,719
You boys play nice.

497
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:08,700
- I've been looking for you.
- Agent Budiansky, take a load off.

498
00:48:09,045 --> 00:48:11,070
I need to go see Castle.
Where do I find him?

499
00:48:11,548 --> 00:48:14,381
Rats, you know, he just left.

500
00:48:15,652 --> 00:48:17,449
Wait, wait, wait.

501
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,879
You know what I like to do?

502
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,657
I like to sit in my car...

503
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:26,454
...and listen to the CB radio
and follow the crime.

504
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:30,494
We might just run into him.
It's never worked for me in five years...

505
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,965
...but I'm not the luckiest guy
on the planet, y'know?

506
00:48:49,686 --> 00:48:52,018
Let's go through the back door.

507
00:49:08,137 --> 00:49:11,903
Maginty and his boys are planning to hit
a convenience store on 45th and 2nd.

508
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:30,326
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

509
00:49:30,526 --> 00:49:34,155
I repeat,
suspects are armed and dangerous.

510
00:49:34,364 --> 00:49:36,161
Let's do this.

511
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:38,730
Really?

512
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:39,959
Just drive the car.

513
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:44,797
Come on. Come on.

514
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:19,864
Oh, fuck.

515
00:50:33,389 --> 00:50:34,378
Please.

516
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,852
Please.

517
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:39,455
- Don'T kill me.
- Russoti.

518
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,493
- Where is he?
- Your man, Jigsaw.

519
00:50:41,698 --> 00:50:45,031
I was just with him. He was supposed
to give me some dough for a job.

520
00:50:45,234 --> 00:50:46,963
But turns out...

521
00:50:48,071 --> 00:50:50,164
...he don'T have any anymore.

522
00:50:50,373 --> 00:50:54,639
He forgot he gave a whole bunch
to that FBI rat bastard.

523
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:59,611
So he went to go see
Donatelli's wee bitch to get it back.

524
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:03,577
Something for something.

525
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,444
Mr. Punisher, sir.

526
00:51:10,426 --> 00:51:12,826
So when did Donattelli go undercover?

527
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,792
We were partners in narcotics.

528
00:51:14,997 --> 00:51:19,593
Unfortunately, most of the blow
we confiscated ended up in my nose.

529
00:51:20,636 --> 00:51:23,104
Internal Affairs
tried to get Nicky to rat me out.

530
00:51:23,306 --> 00:51:24,295
He wouldn'T.

531
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,634
So they send him undercover.

532
00:51:28,144 --> 00:51:30,271
He's dead because of me.

533
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:35,408
So you still skiing the old alps?

534
00:51:36,986 --> 00:51:38,044
No.

535
00:51:38,254 --> 00:51:40,313
That's in the past.

536
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,491
- Holy shit.
- Shit.

537
00:51:58,174 --> 00:52:00,267
Drive around,
meet me on the other side.

538
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:26,462
Mommy.

539
00:52:30,173 --> 00:52:32,038
Hello, Mrs. Donatelli.

540
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:34,471
Or will you be calling yourself Miss
from now on?

541
00:52:34,677 --> 00:52:35,837
What do you want from us?

542
00:52:36,045 --> 00:52:37,672
I'm looking for my money...

543
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,280
...which your rat of a husband
stole from me.

544
00:52:40,483 --> 00:52:41,973
We don'T have it, I swear to God.

545
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:48,048
How about you, sweetcheeks?

546
00:52:48,257 --> 00:52:51,055
Would you also like to swear
on an imaginary friend?

547
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:55,757
Make sure they don'T move.

548
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,195
- We'll look for the money.
- Hey, kid.

549
00:53:03,206 --> 00:53:04,195
Freeze, asshole!

550
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,571
You're under arrest.

551
00:53:24,894 --> 00:53:26,361
Stay out of my way.

552
00:54:17,246 --> 00:54:18,736
Listen to me.

553
00:54:18,948 --> 00:54:21,781
Russoti is headed
to the Donattelli house.

554
00:54:21,984 --> 00:54:24,452
He's probably already there.

555
00:54:24,787 --> 00:54:26,516
You have to let me go.

556
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:29,316
You have the right to shut the fuck up!

557
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:41,598
Mommy.

558
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,328
Damn it. Cops.

559
00:55:26,882 --> 00:55:29,715
- Evening, officers.
- Is everything okay in there?

560
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,348
No.

561
00:55:32,555 --> 00:55:34,147
Everything is not okay.

562
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,624
Follow me.

563
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,662
Officer.

564
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:49,026
Oh, no, you don'T.

565
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:06,051
Well, well, well.

566
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:09,656
This day was bound to come
sooner or later, wasn'T it?

567
00:56:11,193 --> 00:56:13,855
Have you heard back
from the patrol car?

568
00:56:15,731 --> 00:56:17,028
Soap.

569
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,365
I tried a couple of times.
There was no answer.

570
00:56:30,046 --> 00:56:33,812
Listen, we gotta get out of here
before more pigs arrive.

571
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:36,908
- No!
- Where is my fucking money?

572
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,212
My husband has a safe
upstairs in the bedroom.

573
00:56:39,422 --> 00:56:41,583
I don'T know if it's there
but I can give you the combination.

574
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:43,088
10-12-19-65.

575
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:45,487
Oh, how cute.

576
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:48,425
Is that your dead husband's birthday?

577
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:01,974
Let me help you.

578
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:11,079
- Get him to the station.
- You bet.

579
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:30,194
Let me out.

580
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:33,971
You know, Frank...

581
00:57:34,844 --> 00:57:37,108
...throwing you a tip now and again
is one thing.

582
00:57:37,313 --> 00:57:40,339
Password to the crime database
et cetera, but letting you go?

583
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:42,483
- Soap.
- Fine.

584
00:57:54,864 --> 00:57:56,126
How you doing?

585
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,769
Nineteen.

586
00:58:18,654 --> 00:58:20,178
Fuck!

587
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,354
Fuck that...

588
00:58:34,737 --> 00:58:36,364
What was that?

589
00:58:36,939 --> 00:58:38,668
Go check it out.

590
00:58:41,177 --> 00:58:43,202
What the fuck are you waiting for,
Christmas?

591
00:59:11,073 --> 00:59:12,370
Now.

592
00:59:12,575 --> 00:59:14,406
You, sit down.

593
00:59:22,818 --> 00:59:24,046
I'm calling this in.

594
00:59:24,787 --> 00:59:27,153
Put your hands behind your back.

595
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:32,050
Goddamn it, Castle!

596
00:59:33,929 --> 00:59:35,897
Where do you think you're going?

597
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,965
Castle!

598
00:59:43,439 --> 00:59:46,169
I repeat, request immediate backup.

599
00:59:53,749 --> 00:59:54,875
Don'T worry, I'm here.

600
00:59:55,284 --> 00:59:56,717
Give me your fucking gun.

601
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:00,544
Fuck!

602
01:00:01,924 --> 01:00:03,824
Stay right where you fucking are.

603
01:00:08,264 --> 01:00:10,289
We did it, Budiansky, huh?

604
01:00:10,499 --> 01:00:12,091
Would you mind explaining to me...

605
01:00:12,301 --> 01:00:14,394
...how a handcuffed criminal
escapes custody...

606
01:00:14,603 --> 01:00:17,265
...from the back of your locked car?

607
01:00:17,473 --> 01:00:19,634
That Castle's a slippery one.

608
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,188
You'll be safe here.

609
01:00:35,557 --> 01:00:37,354
We can manage on our own.

610
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:40,221
Just until we know
Russoti's been arrested.

611
01:00:44,633 --> 01:00:45,998
Grace.

612
01:00:46,201 --> 01:00:48,533
Grace, we're leaving soon, honey.

613
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:51,669
She's smart.

614
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,832
Go ahead. Open it.

615
01:01:25,774 --> 01:01:28,868
It belonged to my daughter.

616
01:01:30,379 --> 01:01:31,710
Here.

617
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:55,537
Put that down, honey.

618
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:00,407
It...

619
01:02:00,743 --> 01:02:02,938
...was Lisa's favorite toy.

620
01:02:04,246 --> 01:02:08,080
She got so angry when her little brother
used to hide it from her.

621
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,515
Does she care if I play with it?

622
01:02:12,821 --> 01:02:14,186
No.

623
01:02:32,508 --> 01:02:35,443
You're gonna fry
for killing two of my officers, Billy.

624
01:02:35,644 --> 01:02:39,171
- I want a lawyer.
- Oh, you'll get your fucking lawyer.

625
01:02:39,448 --> 01:02:41,609
But no lawyer's gonna get you
out of this one...

626
01:02:41,817 --> 01:02:43,045
...you ugly piece of shit.

627
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:03,770
Agent Miller, what are you doing here?

628
01:03:04,273 --> 01:03:05,297
Russoti.

629
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:08,840
- What's he got to do with the bureau?
- The case Donatelli was working on.

630
01:03:09,044 --> 01:03:11,979
He says he's got some intel,
he wants to make a deal.

631
01:03:12,281 --> 01:03:13,873
Anyone know where he is right now?

632
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:17,052
- Brought him into the observation room.
- Good.

633
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:20,911
Yeah?

634
01:03:21,123 --> 01:03:22,886
Captain, Agent Miller from the bureau.

635
01:03:23,092 --> 01:03:25,720
I believe you were informed
I'll be taking over this?

636
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:31,362
This perp killed two of my officers...

637
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:35,059
...and terrorized the widow and child
of one of your agents.

638
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,761
You keep that in mind, Miller.

639
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:44,942
You're lucky I came to you with this.

640
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:47,682
That I'm a patriot.

641
01:03:47,883 --> 01:03:49,578
Just like you.

642
01:03:49,852 --> 01:03:51,319
I shit red, white and blue.

643
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,954
The reason you came to me
is because you got caught.

644
01:03:54,156 --> 01:03:55,987
So don'T insult my intelligence, okay?

645
01:03:56,592 --> 01:03:58,059
You tell me what you know.

646
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,591
If it's any good...

647
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:02,161
...l'll recommend life without parole.

648
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:07,094
This deal is going down tonight.

649
01:04:09,505 --> 01:04:12,065
I know when and I know where.

650
01:04:12,941 --> 01:04:16,342
So you're gonna give me
and my brother here the immunity...

651
01:04:16,545 --> 01:04:18,240
...and the money...

652
01:04:19,748 --> 01:04:22,512
...or you're gonna have to explain
to Wolf fucking Blitzer...

653
01:04:22,718 --> 01:04:26,745
...why you had the lead on the thing
that killed half the fucking city...

654
01:04:26,955 --> 01:04:29,924
...and you didn'T do
a goddamn thing about it.

655
01:04:33,762 --> 01:04:35,821
I'll be right back.

656
01:04:36,265 --> 01:04:37,732
Oh, and Miller?

657
01:04:37,933 --> 01:04:40,231
There's just one other little thing.

658
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:47,862
Happy?

659
01:05:56,979 --> 01:05:58,276
Go, go, go.

660
01:05:58,747 --> 01:05:59,771
Get them alive.

661
01:05:59,982 --> 01:06:02,473
Homeland Security, put your weapons
on the ground.

662
01:06:02,684 --> 01:06:04,481
Do it now!

663
01:06:05,721 --> 01:06:07,211
You're a fucking dead man.

664
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:10,050
My father will kill you, you hear me?

665
01:06:10,259 --> 01:06:12,921
My father will serve your head
on a fucking silver platter.

666
01:06:13,362 --> 01:06:15,159
Walk down to your right.

667
01:06:16,398 --> 01:06:18,025
Stand clear.

668
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,461
Agent Miller.

669
01:06:20,302 --> 01:06:21,792
As agreed.

670
01:06:22,537 --> 01:06:24,334
The other condition of our agreement?

671
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:26,802
Clear the area.

672
01:06:29,144 --> 01:06:32,045
I hope to God he finds you
and you get what you deserve.

673
01:06:53,502 --> 01:06:55,629
- How long was l...?
- A long time.

674
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:58,834
- You should eat.
- Grace.

675
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:00,702
- What is it?
- Egg and cheese...

676
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:02,501
...MREs, that's all I have.

677
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:04,110
What's an MRE?

678
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:06,611
Meal ready-to-eat.

679
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:10,182
Military food.
It's great for people who can'T cook.

680
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:13,784
Look, Grace,
this one came with Chuckles.

681
01:07:14,389 --> 01:07:16,584
That's the best one to get.

682
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:18,419
Not exactly a balanced breakfast.

683
01:07:18,627 --> 01:07:20,492
Out of practice.

684
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:25,360
Not one more step.

685
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:34,335
- Where's Micro?
- His mother isn'T feeling well.

686
01:07:34,543 --> 01:07:36,340
- He didn'T want to leave her.
- Damn it.

687
01:07:36,712 --> 01:07:38,009
I need to talk to him.

688
01:07:39,081 --> 01:07:40,548
This is Carlos.

689
01:07:40,749 --> 01:07:42,273
He's...

690
01:07:42,651 --> 01:07:43,675
...a friend of mine.

691
01:07:44,152 --> 01:07:47,383
He's gonna hang
while I take care of some things.

692
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:50,217
- Hi, Carlos. I'm Grace.
- Hey, little girl.

693
01:07:50,425 --> 01:07:51,858
We're gonna be homeys, right?

694
01:07:53,428 --> 01:07:55,589
Yeah, we're gonna be tight.

695
01:07:55,797 --> 01:07:57,765
This will all be over soon.

696
01:07:57,966 --> 01:07:59,763
Then you can go.

697
01:08:06,975 --> 01:08:08,943
Don'T go.

698
01:08:24,259 --> 01:08:26,250
I need you alert.

699
01:08:27,662 --> 01:08:29,926
Don'T make me regret this.

700
01:08:39,174 --> 01:08:41,142
That was fun.

701
01:08:41,443 --> 01:08:45,311
Now, let's go kill Castle
in his miserable hole.

702
01:08:45,514 --> 01:08:47,448
No, not yet.

703
01:08:47,649 --> 01:08:50,243
We're gonna have ourselves
a little bit of fun with this.

704
01:08:50,452 --> 01:08:53,910
Next time he has to face us
and a fucking army.

705
01:08:54,122 --> 01:08:55,646
Where do we get the army from?

706
01:08:55,857 --> 01:08:58,052
Just like Uncle Sam, bro.

707
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,956
We recruit in troubled neighborhoods.

708
01:09:01,163 --> 01:09:03,654
Offer a hundred grand
towards a college education...

709
01:09:03,865 --> 01:09:07,494
...they'll never get and promise
nobody ever has to go to Iraq.

710
01:09:08,703 --> 01:09:11,672
Just as long as I get to kill Castle.

711
01:09:11,873 --> 01:09:13,807
Don'T worry, brother, you will.

712
01:09:14,009 --> 01:09:17,843
Just making damn sure this time
he don'T come back breathing.

713
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:47,303
Here we have garlic, onion...

714
01:09:47,509 --> 01:09:50,603
...a little paprika rub
on a rare roast beef.

715
01:10:06,528 --> 01:10:09,224
Hello, sports fans.

716
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:18,703
And how are you today, my friend?

717
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,837
Run! Get out of here!

718
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:22,509
Hey.

719
01:10:22,711 --> 01:10:24,508
I axed you a question.

720
01:10:24,713 --> 01:10:25,702
Run!

721
01:10:29,217 --> 01:10:30,809
You don'T answer.

722
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:33,988
Guess I'll have to ax it again.

723
01:10:35,891 --> 01:10:37,518
Here I come.

724
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,194
Good.

725
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:23,496
Bring them upstairs
and meet me back down here.

726
01:11:23,705 --> 01:11:27,471
Let's see if we can talk
a few poor bastards into signing up.

727
01:11:36,017 --> 01:11:37,951
Where are they?

728
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:43,580
*

729
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:45,856
I tried. I swear I tried.

730
01:11:46,061 --> 01:11:47,426
Goddamn it.

731
01:11:47,629 --> 01:11:49,153
Don'T die on me.

732
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:51,732
I'm bleeding out.

733
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,423
I've seen this show before.

734
01:11:53,635 --> 01:11:54,727
Shut up, kid.

735
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,130
You're gonna be fine.

736
01:11:56,338 --> 01:11:57,805
It hurts real bad.

737
01:11:58,006 --> 01:12:00,304
Hurts real bad, Frank.

738
01:12:01,309 --> 01:12:03,903
Don'T let me die like this, man.

739
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:05,374
Not like this.

740
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,122
See you in hell.

741
01:12:18,727 --> 01:12:21,093
I see you anywhere near hell...

742
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,558
...l'll kick your ass out.

743
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:49,847
I haven'T seen you in ages, Frank.

744
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:53,794
Whatever it is, it must be pretty bad.

745
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,259
Maybe I'm just here
to see an old friend, Mike.

746
01:12:56,464 --> 01:12:57,897
Yeah, right.

747
01:12:58,099 --> 01:13:00,795
- I haven'T seen you since...
- The funeral.

748
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,435
I know.

749
01:13:02,804 --> 01:13:04,396
I've been reading about you.

750
01:13:04,873 --> 01:13:08,309
You've been a long a way
from the seminary, my friend.

751
01:13:09,444 --> 01:13:12,470
I don'T even remember that
as part of my life.

752
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:14,842
Why do you do this?

753
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,513
Somebody has to punish the corrupt.

754
01:13:19,054 --> 01:13:22,080
For in the same way you judge others,
you will be judged.

755
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:26,256
And with the measure you use,
it will be measured to you.

756
01:13:28,096 --> 01:13:29,495
Matthew...

757
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:31,461
...7:2.

758
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:34,459
I'm okay with that.

759
01:13:35,637 --> 01:13:36,763
God be with you, Frank.

760
01:13:42,577 --> 01:13:45,273
Sometimes I'd like to get
my hands on God.

761
01:14:01,696 --> 01:14:03,561
Interesting choice for a meeting place.

762
01:14:03,765 --> 01:14:06,563
I didn'T take you for a religious man,
Castle.

763
01:14:06,768 --> 01:14:08,429
Yeah, well...

764
01:14:08,703 --> 01:14:10,898
...an eye for an eye.
- Lf I remember right...

765
01:14:11,106 --> 01:14:13,802
...they're not called
the Ten Suggestions.

766
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:16,271
Russoti's got Angela and Grace.

767
01:14:18,012 --> 01:14:19,309
- How?
- Doesn'T matter.

768
01:14:19,514 --> 01:14:22,779
Maybe if you'd put them in protective
custody like you should have...

769
01:14:22,984 --> 01:14:24,576
...we wouldn'T be having
this conversation.

770
01:14:24,786 --> 01:14:26,617
They'd be dead.

771
01:14:27,222 --> 01:14:29,656
The law can'T touch him, Castle.

772
01:14:30,024 --> 01:14:32,117
Total immunity.

773
01:14:32,627 --> 01:14:36,028
Unless you've got a videotape
of Russoti taking them.

774
01:14:36,297 --> 01:14:38,424
We can'T even give him
a parking ticket.

775
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:41,124
It's a fucked-up system
you're sworn to protect.

776
01:14:41,469 --> 01:14:42,834
Never said it was perfect.

777
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:47,266
He wants me in exchange for them.

778
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:50,267
I need you to secure the trade.

779
01:14:51,646 --> 01:14:53,113
Okay...

780
01:14:53,515 --> 01:14:55,346
...but I'm doing this by the book.

781
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:58,178
What book do you think
they're going by, huh?

782
01:14:58,386 --> 01:15:00,752
I took an oath, Castle.

783
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:04,152
- There are laws.
- No official police procedure.

784
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:06,190
You wanna come along?

785
01:15:06,394 --> 01:15:08,487
Leave your badge at home.

786
01:15:12,033 --> 01:15:15,161
- I have to think about it.
- Clock's ticking.

787
01:15:38,593 --> 01:15:39,651
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

788
01:15:39,861 --> 01:15:41,021
Relax.

789
01:15:41,229 --> 01:15:45,427
We're looking for a few good men.

790
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:50,093
And we'd like to offer you
the opportunity to be...

791
01:15:50,305 --> 01:15:51,772
...all that you can be.

792
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:57,773
Now, we've all suffered loss
at the hands of The Punisher.

793
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:01,539
And because we don'T
look like everybody else...

794
01:16:01,749 --> 01:16:04,912
...and because we don'T act
like everybody else...

795
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:08,019
...nobody does a goddamn thing
about it.

796
01:16:09,157 --> 01:16:10,715
Well, I say...

797
01:16:10,925 --> 01:16:15,294
...he ain'T the only one who can take
the law into his own hands.

798
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:20,758
So if you're as sick of this cocksucker
as I am...

799
01:16:20,969 --> 01:16:22,300
...raise your armies.

800
01:16:22,837 --> 01:16:24,737
You'll be well-paid...

801
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:26,600
...you'll be well-armed...

802
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:29,899
...and at the end of it...

803
01:16:30,111 --> 01:16:32,773
...The Punisher will be dead.

804
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:53,659
Agent Budiansky,
just in time for happy hour.

805
01:17:54,996 --> 01:17:56,429
You need to come with me.

806
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:57,620
Where to?

807
01:17:57,832 --> 01:18:01,598
Your partner Frank Castle
needs help.

808
01:18:03,037 --> 01:18:05,938
"Partner" is a little bit
of an exaggeration.

809
01:18:06,374 --> 01:18:07,898
How did you know?

810
01:18:08,276 --> 01:18:10,938
Oh, usually,
unless you've arrested Houdini...

811
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:13,545
...a handcuffed criminal
does not escape that easily.

812
01:18:13,748 --> 01:18:15,943
You know,
you're not as stupid as you...

813
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,139
I didn'T say that.

814
01:18:20,888 --> 01:18:23,482
- Who are we looking for?
- Cristu's father.

815
01:18:25,059 --> 01:18:27,425
I don'T think this is a good idea.

816
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,230
What?

817
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:42,500
We're looking for Tiberiu.
Cristu's father.

818
01:18:46,247 --> 01:18:48,181
- Why?
- Lf I were Tiberiu...

819
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:50,211
...l'd probably wanna find the man...

820
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:54,411
...who was responsible for sending
my son to prison for the rest of his life.

821
01:18:55,123 --> 01:18:58,559
- And how would you do that?
- I'd tell him when and where to find him.

822
01:19:00,094 --> 01:19:01,755
What do you want from it?

823
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:05,560
I don'T like him
and I want him taken care of.

824
01:19:08,736 --> 01:19:11,296
No worries, my friend.

825
01:19:40,134 --> 01:19:41,965
All right, lock and load. Lock and load.

826
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:44,331
- Let's knock him down.
- Get ready.

827
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:09,493
Here they are.

828
01:20:09,864 --> 01:20:11,559
Oh, boy.

829
01:20:44,198 --> 01:20:46,530
Take it easy, James.

830
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:48,295
He'll be here.

831
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:53,967
- You get it.
- Fuck that, man. You get it.

832
01:20:54,175 --> 01:20:55,335
I'll get it.

833
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,572
- What you looking for?
- I'm here to see the Jigsaw.

834
01:21:02,783 --> 01:21:05,581
You're out of luck. No Jigsaw here.

835
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:10,116
I'm here for The Punisher party.

836
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,198
Who's the old man?

837
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:24,361
It's Cristu's father.

838
01:21:24,572 --> 01:21:27,166
Old-country genocidal maniac.

839
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:30,003
Figured he'd stir up a shit storm
for us.

840
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:33,612
Cops will be all over this place
once the fireworks start.

841
01:21:33,814 --> 01:21:35,179
I wouldn'T worry about that.

842
01:21:35,383 --> 01:21:37,613
I called in a explosives permit.

843
01:21:37,818 --> 01:21:41,584
Construction crew.
Said we'd be blasting dynamite all night.

844
01:21:41,789 --> 01:21:43,188
So...

845
01:21:43,491 --> 01:21:45,152
...what's the plan?

846
01:21:45,426 --> 01:21:47,519
I'm going in to get them.

847
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:50,996
You call that a plan?

848
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,326
It's all I need.

849
01:21:54,569 --> 01:21:56,503
Well, I'm going in with you.

850
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,339
Never took the time to think about
where I was headed.

851
01:22:03,411 --> 01:22:05,879
I'm far down that road.

852
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:08,977
You're not going there.

853
01:22:11,919 --> 01:22:13,716
Thanks, Frank.

854
01:22:13,921 --> 01:22:16,890
You know he's gonna take it out on me
when he wakes up.

855
01:22:17,091 --> 01:22:21,255
If you don'T hear gunfire
for longer than five minutes...

856
01:22:21,462 --> 01:22:25,057
...the girls are not here,
set him loose.

857
01:24:59,153 --> 01:25:01,212
Come on, get him. Go, go, go.

858
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,116
Quiet, fool.

859
01:26:01,849 --> 01:26:02,975
It's time.

860
01:26:03,717 --> 01:26:05,810
James, be careful.

861
01:26:54,502 --> 01:26:55,764
Oh, for fuck's sake.

862
01:27:28,936 --> 01:27:32,235
Won'T be replacing
that son of yours any time soon.

863
01:27:33,641 --> 01:27:38,078
Blood in the urine.
Early indicator of kidney failure.

864
01:27:41,749 --> 01:27:44,877
You should be seeing double
right about now.

865
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,946
That would be a torn meniscus.

866
01:28:32,299 --> 01:28:34,927
- James.
- Gun.

867
01:28:40,674 --> 01:28:42,301
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

868
01:28:44,912 --> 01:28:46,277
Mom.

869
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,705
- Please, help us.
- Shut the fuck up.

870
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:50,611
Come on, Castle.

871
01:28:50,818 --> 01:28:52,547
Don'T be shy.

872
01:28:57,091 --> 01:28:59,059
Throw down your gun.

873
01:29:05,332 --> 01:29:07,823
- Die, you bastard.
- No.

874
01:29:08,035 --> 01:29:11,163
James, that's no way
to punish The Punisher.

875
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,757
Nice shooter.

876
01:29:45,205 --> 01:29:46,365
Catch.

877
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,367
Let's play a game, what do you say?

878
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,341
You got one round left in there.

879
01:29:52,813 --> 01:29:54,781
You shoot one of these two.

880
01:29:55,382 --> 01:29:57,077
I'll let the other one go free.

881
01:29:58,752 --> 01:30:00,083
What do you say, Frank?

882
01:30:00,287 --> 01:30:02,881
Who's it to be,
your fat friend right here?

883
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:05,456
Or that nice little piece
of jailbait over there?

884
01:30:05,659 --> 01:30:07,126
Burn in hell.

885
01:30:07,327 --> 01:30:09,295
Okay, then they both die.

886
01:30:09,496 --> 01:30:10,963
Frank.

887
01:30:11,331 --> 01:30:13,299
She's a kid.

888
01:30:14,535 --> 01:30:16,196
Shoot me.

889
01:30:32,186 --> 01:30:33,585
Okay, fuck it. Kill her first.

890
01:30:33,787 --> 01:30:34,947
- No.
- Stop.

891
01:30:38,292 --> 01:30:40,487
He's made a decision.

892
01:30:42,029 --> 01:30:45,157
Not looking too good for you, fatso.

893
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:51,299
After three, Castle.

894
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:53,366
One.

895
01:30:54,308 --> 01:30:55,673
Two.

896
01:30:55,876 --> 01:30:57,673
You won'T feel a thing, Micro.

897
01:30:59,546 --> 01:31:00,604
Three.

898
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:30,534
God...

899
01:31:44,858 --> 01:31:46,120
Frank.

900
01:31:56,203 --> 01:31:57,761
Get out.

901
01:32:22,095 --> 01:32:23,892
Fuck you.

902
01:32:24,097 --> 01:32:26,429
Let me put you out of my misery.

903
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:34,503
This is just the beginning.

904
01:32:58,599 --> 01:32:59,793
You okay?

905
01:33:01,401 --> 01:33:03,369
- Where's Castle?
- Still inside.

906
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:05,231
And Micro?

907
01:33:10,143 --> 01:33:11,132
Frank.

908
01:33:11,345 --> 01:33:13,370
Frank, are you okay?

909
01:33:21,288 --> 01:33:22,915
You better get out of here.

910
01:33:23,123 --> 01:33:25,990
Yeah. Come on, Frank,
I'll buy you a drink.

911
01:33:26,193 --> 01:33:27,217
Wait.

912
01:33:27,427 --> 01:33:28,724
Wait.

913
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:31,229
My husband...

914
01:33:31,431 --> 01:33:32,864
...Nicky.

915
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:34,725
We talked about you.

916
01:33:35,802 --> 01:33:38,327
Argued about you.

917
01:33:41,174 --> 01:33:43,472
He said you were one of the good guys.

918
01:34:28,655 --> 01:34:30,179
You know, buddy.

919
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:32,654
Maybe it's time to quit now, huh?

920
01:34:32,859 --> 01:34:36,556
I mean, you must get tired of this, right?

921
01:34:36,763 --> 01:34:39,095
And I think you got
all the criminals in town.

922
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:40,823
If there are any left...

923
01:34:41,034 --> 01:34:44,128
...they ought to
at least consider rehabilitation.

924
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:47,838
I mean, contrary to popular belief,
people can change.

925
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:49,508
I guess what I'm saying is...

926
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:53,111
...l'm just personally
not a fan of the death penalty.

927
01:34:54,781 --> 01:34:56,248
Frank?

928
01:34:57,117 --> 01:34:58,584
Where did he go?

929
01:34:59,019 --> 01:35:00,509
Hey.

930
01:35:01,421 --> 01:35:04,083
Give me your fucking wallet,
motherfucker.

931
01:35:04,291 --> 01:35:05,349
You're kidding, right?

932
01:35:05,559 --> 01:35:07,220
Do I look like I'm fucking kidding?

933
01:35:07,427 --> 01:35:08,553
Frank.

934
01:35:08,762 --> 01:35:10,491
Give me your wallet.

935
01:35:11,264 --> 01:35:13,858
- Frank.
- Do you wanna die?

936
01:35:15,435 --> 01:35:17,494
For the last time, give me your wallet.

937
01:35:24,144 --> 01:35:28,137
Oh, God.
Now I've got brain splattered all over me.
