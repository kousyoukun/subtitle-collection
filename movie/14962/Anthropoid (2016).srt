1
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,820
装备在哪？
Where's the equipment?

2
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,300
婊子！
Kurva!

3
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,260
发生了什么？
What happened?

4
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,660
在降落的时候 被一个树枝挂到了
Caught on one of the branches on the way down.

5
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
能走吗？
Can you walk?

6
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,780
你需要缝针
You'll need stitches.

7
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,020
喂
Hey.

8
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,980
你们没有把降落伞藏得很好啊
You didn't hide your parachutes very well,

9
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,980
并且你留了一条半公里长的血脚印
and you left a blood trail for half a kilometer.

10
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,380
跟我来
Follow me.

11
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,950
我住在不远的地方
I live not far from here.

12
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,540
迪克（狗）！过来！
Dik! Come!

13
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,620
（人名）
Ignác.

14
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,020
（人名）！
Ignác!

15
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,820
有热汤 來吧
Hot soup. Come.

16
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,740
请进
Come in.

17
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,700
我想你们这是要去布拉格吧
I take it you are heading for Prague.

18
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,900
有多远呢？
How far is it?

19
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,100
30公里
Thirty kilometers.

20
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,660
我的卡车有一个运输许可证（纳粹颁发的）
I have a special delivery permit for my truck.

21
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,230
我可以带你们去
I could take you.

22
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,780
谢谢你
Thank you.

23
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,390
你们今晚就在这里休息吧
You rest here tonight.

24
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,540
我明天一早就带你们过去
I will take you in the morning.

25
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,030
好好享用你们的汤吧
Enjoy your soup.

26
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,020
请坐
Please, sit.

27
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,590
德国佬给你了多少钱?
How much do the Germans pay you?

28
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,540
让你供出同胞们?
For turning in your fellow countrymen, huh?

29
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,620
扔掉枪
Drop the gun.

30
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,300
我说 扔掉枪
I said, drop the gun.

31
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,540
扔了
Drop it.

32
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,660
扔掉枪！
Drop the gun!

33
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,460
枪
Gun.

34
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,100
你干掉他了吗？
You get him?

35
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,380
我们就开那辆卡车吧
We'll take that truck.

36
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,700
来吧
Come on.

37
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,900
他们做了自己的选择 杨
They had made their choice, Jan.

38
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,620
有些时候 人需要选边站
Sometimes you have to pick a side.

39
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,980
你希望他们选择我们这一边吗？
Would you prefer it was us?

40
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,700
应该是前一个路口左拐
Should be the next left.

41
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,500
在这里停吧
Pull over here.

42
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,380
米瑞克 不要站在窗口
Mirek, come away from the window.

43
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,470
安娜 去开门！
Anna, get the door!

44
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,700
有什么是吗？
Yes?

45
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,180
我们找欧德里希·诺瓦克
We are looking for Oldrich Novák.

46
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,860
他们不住在这了
The Novákovi no longer live here.

47
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
谁在门口呢？
Who is it?

48
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,980
就是有人在问路呢
Just somebody looking for directions.

49
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,300
不好意思 但这是我知道的全部了
I am sorry,but that's all I know.

50
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,220
请你等等
Please.

51
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,870
可以给我们帮帮忙吗？
Can you help us?

52
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,140
在街上第二排店铺里有一家兽医诊所
There is a veterinarian in the next row of shops up the street.

53
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,220
我听说他是个好心人
I hear he is a good man.

54
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,580
他也许会帮助你们的
One that may help.

55
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,660
感谢你
Thank you.

56
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,660
他一般只对德国人汪汪
He normally only barks at Germans.

57
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,580
呵呵 除了德国人还有给他做直肠检查的人
Mmm-mmm. Germans and anyone giving him a rectal examination.

58
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,020
谢谢你 爱德华医生
Thank you, Dr. Eduard.

59
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,940
快给我过来 本尼希
Come along, Benés.

60
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,140
好好照顾他 路科索娃太太
Look after him, Mrs. Lukešová.

61
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,060
一般来说 被狗咬了
Normally, for a dog bite,

62
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,180
你应该去一家医院 而不是兽医诊所
you would go to a hospital, not a vet.

63
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,660
你认识欧德里希·诺瓦克吗？
Did you know Oldrich Novák?

64
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
是的
Yes.

65
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
如果我们说欧德里希·诺瓦克
And what if we were to say that Oldrich Novák

66
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,820
是我们在布拉格的联络人呢？
was our contact here in Prague?

67
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,780
那么我就要开始考虑
Then I would have to wonder

68
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,590
你们是不是消息不灵通的捷克愤青
if you are ill-informed Czech patriots

69
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,620
或者是盖世太保的探子
or Gestapo spies

70
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,100
想要渗透进剩余的抵抗组织里
trying to infiltrate what remains of the resistance.

71
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,020
我听不出来你们有德国口音
I don't detect a German accent.

72
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,180
那些在你包里的解密手册
The decoding papers in your bag,

73
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,180
没有德文在上面
they don't have a German font.

74
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,180
然后通过你的这个伤口
And given that this wound

75
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,070
比起狗的咬伤 看起来更像是树的挂伤
has more tree bark than dog bite,

76
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,220
我不禁要猜一猜
I would have to guess

77
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,140
你是跳伞潜入的捷克斯洛伐克
that you were parachuted back into Czechoslovakia

78
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,740
并且掌握的情报已经过时了
with information that was somewhat out of date.

79
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,100
你真是一个聪明人
You're a clever man.

80
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,020
我们也听说你是一个好人
We were also told you were a good man.

81
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,460
你们离开捷克斯洛伐克多久了?
How long have you been away?

82
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,420
有段日子了
It's been a while.

83
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,380
现在悬赏提供反纳粹活动的人
Rewards are given to people who inform on anti-Nazi activity.

84
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,580
海因里希差不多已经把抵抗组织消灭殆尽了
Heydrich has all but crushed the resistance.

85
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,260
他处决了上千人
He has executed thousands.

86
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,580
我可以帮你联系上磨坊（代号）
I can put you in contact with the miller.

87
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,100
也许他可以帮助你
Maybe he can help you.

88
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,750
你们今晚可以呆在这里
You can stay here tonight.

89
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,020
我明天一早就会联系磨坊
I'll contact the miller in the morning.

90
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,950
我朋友刚说
My friend here says

91
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,660
你是一个聪明人
that you are a clever man.

92
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,870
我很赞同
I agree.

93
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,140
千万不要做任何改变我这看法的傻事
Don't do anything that would change our opinion.

94
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,110
少用一点这只脚
Go easy on the foot.

95
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,780
你一周后就能跳探戈舞了
You will be dancing the tango within a week.

96
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,180
喂 喂 喂...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

97
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,230
这是布雷特斯拉夫
This is Břetislav.

98
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,750
代号磨坊
The miller.

99
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,910
爱德华告诉我你们在找欧德里希·诺瓦克
EDUARD told me you were looking for Oldrich Novák.

100
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,900
是的
Yes.

101
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,780
你们能跟我上车走一趟吗？
Would you like to take a drive with me?

102
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,220
别动
Don't move.

103
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,070
请坐
Please sit.

104
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,940
你们在找欧德里希·诺瓦克
You were looking for Oldrich Novák.

105
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,820
谁给你的这个联系人？
Who gave you this contact?

106
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,220
伦敦的人
London.

107
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,460
你为什么告诉我？
And you tell us this because?

108
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,740
你们不给我们留余地
You are not giving us much choice

109
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,460
并且这里看起来也不像盖世太保的总部（所以我们就告诉你咯）
and this doesn't look like Gestapo headquarters.

110
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,860
你 从哪里来？
You, where are you from?

111
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,460
你的口音是波西米亚的吗？
Your accent, Bohemia?

112
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,700
不 Dolní Vilémovice 摩拉维亚
No, Dolní Vilémovice, Moravia.

113
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,060
所以你肯定知道弗拉迪斯拉夫的火车站咯？
So you must know the railway station at Vladislav?

114
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,180
是的
Yes.

115
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,830
那有什么特别的地方吗？
What's so special about it?

116
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,660
我猜你是想说那个由彩色的玫瑰组成的
I presume you are talking about the large bed of colored roses

117
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,420
从上面看起来就像我们国旗形状的巨大花床吗？
that when seen from above is in the shape of our national flag?

118
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,020
它还在那吗？
Is it still there?

119
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,780
看起来德国人还没有从上面观察过它
Seems the Germans have still not looked at it from above.

120
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,870
我是范尼克
I am Vanek.

121
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,780
拉迪斯拉夫·范尼克
Ladislav Vanek.

122
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,660
这是海斯基叔叔
This is Uncle Hajsky.

123
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,620
我们是金德拉组织的领导
We are the head of the Jindra Organization.

124
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,900
捷克抵抗力量
Czech resistance.

125
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,350
我是杨·克比奇
I am Jan Kubiš.

126
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,350
我是约瑟夫·加布切克
I am Josef Gabčík.

127
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,420
斯洛伐克来的
From Slovakia.

128
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,470
你肯定对我们的多疑不感奇怪
You must not be surprised by our lack of trust.

129
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,060
盖世太保很成功的打入了我们组织的内部
The Gestapo have been very successful in infiltrating our network.

130
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,230
欧德里希·诺瓦克
Oldrich Novák.

131
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,420
他已经被抓走了好几个月了
He was taken away several months ago.

132
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,420
伦敦怎么一点消息都没有？
Why wasn't London informed?

133
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,070
我们已经和捷克在伦敦的流亡政府
We lost Contact with the Czech government in exile

134
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,900
失去联系好几个月了
in London some months ago.

135
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,220
我们需要给发报机更换晶体
We need replacement crystals for the transmitter.

136
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,060
我们一直在等他们派人过来
We've been waiting for them to send someone

137
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
重新建立起联络
to re-establish contact.

138
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,340
是你吗？
Is that you?

139
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,580
在飞机上还有其他的人
There were other men on the plane.

140
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,820
他们在别处降落了
They were dropped elsewhere.

141
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,420
他们可能执行重建与伦敦联系的任务
It's possible they have orders

142
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,310
但是
to re-establish contact with London but that...

143
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,820
那不是我们的任务
That is not our mission.

144
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,380
你们的任务是什么呢？
What is your mission?

145
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,460
类人猿行动
Operation Anthropoid.

146
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,350
类人猿？
Anthropoid?

147
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,180
类人猿是什么？
What is Anthropoid?

148
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,630
我们是来刺杀
We are here to assassinate

149
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,980
党卫军参谋总长 盖世太保头子 波西米亚总督莱因哈德·海德里希
SS Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich.

150
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,740
你们完全疯掉了吗？
Are you completely mad?

151
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,140
约瑟夫：我们有命令在身 同志 范尼克：但这是疯狂的行为
We have our orders, comrade. But this is madness.

152
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,830
我们有命令在身 同志
We have our orders, comrade.

153
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,060
海德里希？
Heydrich?

154
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,750
为什么只杀海德里希一个呢？
Why stop with Heydrich?

155
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,180
为什么不连希特勒也一起干掉算了？
Why not have a go at Hitler as well?

156
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,940
他就在只有300公里开外
He is only 300 kilometers down the road

157
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,300
一个叫柏林的一个小村子里
in a small village called Berlin.

158
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,420
这样的话 我们只好联系伦敦
So we inform London

159
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,420
告诉他们你拒绝为我们这次任务提供协助咯？
that you are refusing to cooperate with our mission.

160
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,990
你竟敢质疑我们？
How dare you question us?

161
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,740
你竟敢质疑我们？
How dare you question us?

162
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,100
你知道我们为这里所牺牲的一切吗？
You know what we have sacrificed for the cause here?

163
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,500
你们牺牲了什么？
What you have sacrificed?

164
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,780
捷克斯洛伐克牺牲了什么？
What has Czechoslovakia sacrificed?

165
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,060
你完全不知道我们做出了怎样的牺牲！
You have no idea what we've sacrificed!

166
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,780
请坐下
Sit down. Please.

167
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,460
你杀了海德里希的话
You kill Heydrich

168
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,620
希特勒会把布拉格撕烂
and Hitler will tear Prague apart.

169
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,580
我相信你在捷克斯洛伐克有亲人？
I take it you have family in Czechoslovakia?

170
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,860
爸爸？妈妈？
Father? Mother?

171
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,940
你杀了海德里希的话
You kill Heydrich,

172
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,180
你可以认为你的父母和所有你认识的人都会死去
then you can consider them and everyone that ever knew you dead.

173
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,340
所有的捷克爱国认识
All Czech patriots

174
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,830
都应该做好为国家牺牲的准备
should be ready to die for their country.

175
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,060
这也包括了我的家庭
That includes my family.

176
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,340
行 但是不包括我的家庭
Well, I'm not.

177
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,140
我想要一直战斗下去
I want to carry on fighting.

178
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,950
我们剩下的想要去抗争的人已经不多了
We don't have that many left that are willing to do that.

179
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,420
我们是捷克抵抗组织所剩不多的力量了
We are what's left of the Czech resistance.

180
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,340
我建议刺杀一个级别低一点的目标吧
I suggest a lesser rank should be assassinated.

181
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,620
也许可以刺杀几个这样的目标
Perhaps a few of them.

182
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,940
海德里希是盖世太保的头子
Heydrich is the head of the secret police.

183
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,140
只有希特勒和希姆莱在纳粹党的地位比他高（帝国空军元帅戈林表示不服）
Only Hitler and Himmler are above him in the Nazi hierarchy.

184
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,380
我就是这么考虑的
Exactly my point.

185
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,820
你真以为你会有机会靠近海德里希去刺杀他吗？
You really think you'll ever get close enough to assassinate Heydrich?

186
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,500
我们的命令是直接从伦敦的捷克斯洛伐克政府下达的
Our orders have come direct from the Czech government in London.

187
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,580
所以说这就是伦敦的捷克政府
So this is about the Czech government in London

188
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,340
想要通过这来跪舔盟军咯？
trying to impress the allies?

189
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,300
正是盟军在一开始把我们拱手送给了德国人（慕尼黑协定出卖了捷克）
It was the allies that gave us to the Germans in the first place.

190
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,460
慕尼黑是一个背叛
Munich was a betrayal,

191
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,300
但那已经成为了历史
but it is also now history.

192
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,620
我想在伦敦的流亡政府
I think what the Czech government in London

193
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,310
目的是在于想要明白
is asking is this.

194
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,060
是否捷克斯洛伐克
Is Czechoslovakia

195
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,980
仍然准备并且希望去抵抗纳粹德国？
still ready and willing to resist Nazi Germany?

196
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,180
约瑟夫·加布切克
Josef Gabčík.

197
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,060
和杨·库比奇
And Jan Kubiš.

198
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,180
十分欢迎你们两个
You are both most welcome here.

199
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,980
请叫我莫拉维斯阿姨
And please call me Auntie Moravec.

200
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,860
阿提亚 阿提亚
Ata. Ata.

201
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,100
阿提亚是我儿子
Ata is my son.

202
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,700
他正在学习成为一个小提琴手
He is studying to be a violinist.

203
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,340
阿提亚 这是约瑟夫 这是杨
Ata, this is Josef and this is Jan.

204
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,700
很高兴见到你们两个
Pleased to meet you both.

205
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,460
所以 尽量不要尝试去外面
So, try not to go outside,

206
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,500
但是如果你们必须出去的话 千万不要走一起
but if you do, never walk together.

207
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,620
如果你被拦下的话
If you're stopped,

208
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,620
你需要准备一个为什么你没有在工作的理由
you will need an excuse for why you're not at work.

209
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,220
我们会尽快给你们弄到病假条
We'll try to get you medical certificates as soon as possible.

210
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,260
永远接的我们的接头暗号
Always use our code,

211
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,780
连敲三下 再单敲一下
three knocks, then a single knock.

212
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,100
同时
In the meantime,

213
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,860
保持低调 我会通过阿提亚和你们联系
lay low and I will use Ata to make contact.

214
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,140
祝你们好运
Good luck.

215
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,260
谢谢你
Thank you.

216
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,420
再见
Goodbye.

217
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
请进来吧
Come on through, please.

218
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,660
约瑟夫
Josef

219
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,140
房顶上有路可以下去吗？
There is a way off the roof?

220
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,940
在左侧有一个防火通道
There is a fire escape to the left.

221
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,260
在右侧连着隔壁的房子
To the right it continues to the building next door.

222
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,260
足够好了
It's good enough.

223
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,460
我想你们想要一杯冰爵利口酒
I'm sure you both would like a glass of Becherovka.

224
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
麻烦你了
Thank you.

225
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,460
- It's okay. 没事的
- Mrs. Moravec? 莫拉维斯太太？

226
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,860
Hey.你好
Hey.你好

227
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,940
刚刚在市场人特别的多
There was so much people at the market.

228
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,620
但是我没找到你想要的那一款面包
But I didn't find the bread that you like.

229
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,860
过来吧
Come.

230
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,380
Who is it? 他们是谁？
It's okay, Marie. 没事的 玛利亚

231
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,940
这位是约瑟夫 这位是杨
This is Josef and this is Jan.

232
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,460
他们在找工作的期间
They will be staying with us

233
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,300
会与我们住在一起.
while they are looking for work.

234
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,460
Pleased to meet you. 很高兴见到你
Hello. 你好呀

235
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,940
Hello. 你好
Hello. 你好

236
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,660
约瑟夫和杨还没有去公安局
Josef and Jan are not registered with the police

237
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,740
上布拉格的户口
as being residents here,

238
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,980
所以请你一定要记住 保守好这个秘密
so, remember, please keep it strictly to yourself.

239
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,460
我把买的东西放到厨房去
I'll put the shopping in the kitchen.

240
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,780
欢迎你们
Welcome.

241
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,300
她是库尼科瓦先生的女儿我们雇她过来帮忙
Mrs. Kovárníková's daughter. I pay her for helping out.

242
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,300
晚饭在6点钟好
Dinner will be at 6:00.

243
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,780
请坐
Please sit.

244
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,380
阿提亚 晚饭做好了
Ata, dinner is ready.

245
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,260
终于拉琴的伙计安静了
And finally the fiddler is silent.

246
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,470
他是一名小提琴演奏家 阿洛依斯 演奏家不是拉琴的
He is a violinist, Alois. A violinist.

247
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,020
那你们两个小伙子是在找工作咯？
You two boys looking for work, then?

248
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
是的
Yes.

249
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,030
我们一直在招人清理火车头里的煤渣
We are always looking for men to clean the cinders out of the locomotives.

250
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,380
谢谢你 莫拉维斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Moravec.

251
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,180
我们会记着的
We'll keep that in mind.

252
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,300
所以说 你不在这里帮忙的时候 一般干嘛呢？
So, what do you do when you aren't helping out here?

253
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,220
你没有男朋友吗？
You don't have a boyfriend?

254
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,060
没有
No.

255
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,980
在布拉格沦陷区的生活如何呢 玛利亚？
How's life in occupied Prague, Marie?

256
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,500
我猜没有去警察局上户口
I guess, not being registered with the police as residents

257
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,230
和我平时在干吗有关联咯？
has something to do with this question?

258
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,830
我厌恶德国人
I hate the Germans.

259
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,500
那么告诉我
And tell me,

260
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,300
你有没有一个
do you have a friend

261
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,950
和你同样可爱的朋友呢...
as lovely as you that...

262
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,740
你可以信任的朋友？
That you can trust?

263
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,900
为什么这么问？
Why?

264
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,660
我和杨有女伴出门的话 会看起来比较不那么可疑
It would be less conspicuous if Jan and I were not seen out alone.

265
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,750
盛开在德占区天真烂漫的情侣
Young love flourishes under German occupation.

266
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,540
就要的那种感觉
That sort of thing.

267
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,020
但是你看起来不是那么的年轻
But you're not that young.

268
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,100
我们知道你是可靠的人是一方面 玛利亚
Knowing that you are trustworthy is one thing, Marie.

269
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,310
但是和我们假扮情侣的话 有可能会吃枪子
But doing this could get you shot.

270
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,020
也许你应该考虑一下...
Perhaps you should think about it...

271
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,460
我有个朋友 兰卡
My friend, Lenka.

272
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,300
她有时候替海斯基叔叔传递消息
She sometimes carries messages for Uncle Hajsky.

273
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,620
很好
Good.

274
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,660
我们明晚回去一个新年舞会
We are going to a New Year's Eve dance tomorrow night.

275
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,780
你们想要一起去吗？
Would you like to go?

276
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,020
看看他们
Look at them.

277
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,940
就像...
It's like...

278
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,180
就像某种失去乐趣的过时社交活动
It's like some old ritual that's lost its joy.

279
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,860
也许在虚伪的同胞里还是有希望的
Maybe there's hope in the pretense.

280
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,020
你好
Hello.

281
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,820
看起来你没有被兰卡放鸽子呀
It looks like you've landed on your feet with Lenka.

282
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,380
她们犯了个错误
This was a mistake.

283
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,940
你好
Hello.

284
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,860
兰卡 这是杨和约瑟夫
Lenka, this is Jan and Josef.

285
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,260
You know, it's not very polite... 知道吗 你不站起来很没礼貌...
Please sit down. 请坐下

286
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,460
你是这大厅里最漂亮的女士
You are the most beautiful women in the room.

287
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,300
祝贺你
Congratulations.

288
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,060
但是你完全没有明白
But you fail to understand this is...

289
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,830
今晚不是我们娱乐的时间
This is not a night off for us.

290
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,660
这不是个儿戏
This is not some game.

291
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,500
约瑟夫 也许你有点神经过敏了...
Josef, maybe you're overreacting a little...

292
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,900
杨 看看四周
Jan, take a look around.

293
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,700
我们感谢你们的努力 但今晚重点是不要吸引大多注意力
We appreciate the effort, but the point was not to attract attention.

294
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,300
我们需要你们尽可能的打扮的普通点
We needed you as plain as possible.

295
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,100
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

296
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,620
你知道吗 对于大多数的女生
You know, for most girls,

297
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,310
一个小小的口红是唯一能使我们
a little lipstick is the only way to forget

298
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,340
忘记现实的东西
what's happening here.

299
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,580
即使是仅仅几个小时而已
Even if it's just for a few hours.

300
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,580
是的
Yes.

301
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,390
你的口红让你备受瞩目
Your lipstick gets you noticed,

302
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,020
这也让我们大家被注意到
and that gets us noticed,

303
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,540
然后我们被盯上的话 会让我们都吃枪子儿
and us being noticed gets us all shot.

304
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,260
现在这个局面必须赶紧结束
This little scene needs an ending.

305
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,470
打我一耳光
Slap my face.

306
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,780
打我一耳光
Slap my face.

307
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,340
我不是个婊子
I'm not a whore.

308
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,220
我觉得我们大家相处的真不错
I think that went well.

309
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,990
Nine... Eight... Seven...
9..8..7..

310
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:17,590
Six... Five... Four...Three... Two... One.
6...5...4...3...2...1

311
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,070
英国斯登二型冲锋枪一把
A British Sten Mark II machine gun.

312
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,340
100发子弹
One hundred rounds.

313
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,220
几个延时引信的73型反坦克手雷
And Model 73 anti-tank grenades with pencil fuses.

314
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,780
这是我们能从空投圆筒（片头那个）里拿到的全部东西了
That's everything we could retrieve from the drop canister.

315
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,580
海叔说对于你想要了解的情报
Uncle says he has made some progress

316
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,350
他取得了一些进展
with the information you asked for.

317
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,260
我们会在沃迪科瓦街的摩拉维亚咖啡馆开会
There is a meeting at Café Moravia on Vodičkova Street.

318
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,260
周二 下午两点
Tuesday. 2:00.

319
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,510
我想为我那晚的行为向你道歉
I just wanted to apologize about the other night.

320
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,980
你那晚的行为是完全正确的
You were completely right to do what you did.

321
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,070
玛利亚之前没有告诉我那晚的全部情况
Marie didn't fully inform me about the situation.

322
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,860
她太年轻了
She is very young,

323
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,230
对于战争还是抱有浪漫的幻想
she still has romantic ideas about the war.

324
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,060
那你呢？
And you?

325
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,220
战争可一点都不浪漫
War is not romantic.

326
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,140
我们在这过马路
We cross here.

327
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,990
在上次的约会之后
After our last date,

328
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,710
我觉得你们会穿装土豆的袋子来见我们了
I thought you might both show wearing potato sacks.

329
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,980
我不知道自己做的对不对
I don't know what I'm doing.

330
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,180
你做的可以了
You are doing fine.

331
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,100
在这里坐下 点一杯喝的
Take a seat here. Order a drink.

332
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,940
我们不会太久
We won't be long.

333
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,110
约瑟夫
Josef.

334
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,620
- Jan. 杨
- Opálka. 欧帕卡

335
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,580
瓦切克
Valčík.

336
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,860
我想你们应该都认识
I see you are no strangers to one another,

337
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,620
但是我们时间不多了
but we don't have much time.

338
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,620
我们在特种作战的训练时在一起上课
We all trained special operations together.

339
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,780
瓦切克还是和我们同一批空降的呢
Valčík here was even on the same drop.

340
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,060
是啊 比你们晚了十分钟 结果偏离预定地点了30公里 呵呵
Yes, dropped 10 minutes later and 30 miles off course.

341
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,980
感谢瓦切克和他的银A小组
Thanks to Valčík and his group Silver A,

342
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,950
我们终于重新和伦敦建立起了联系
we have finally re-established communications with London.

343
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,100
我被命令要求收发
I have orders to send and receive any communications

344
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,220
你和伦敦之间的所有通讯
between you and London.

345
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,630
你带了自己的解密手册对吗?
You have your own decoder book, right?

346
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
是的
Yes.

347
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,420
欧帕卡少尉和库达准尉
Second Lieutenant Opálka and Warrant Officer Curda

348
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,180
已经完成了[超距]行动
have completed Operation Out Distance,

349
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,990
所以他们现在都可以协助你们了
so both are now available to assist you.

350
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,900
少尉欧帕卡是这里的高级军官了
Second Lieutenant Opálka is the senior officer here.

351
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
是的 这是事实
Yes, this is true,

352
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,870
但你任务的优先级是凌驾于我的军衔之上的
but your mission objective supersedes my rank.

353
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,020
我们收到了伦敦的回话了 [类人猿]行动
We had word from London. Anthropoid.

354
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,540
有最高优先级
Utmost priority.

355
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,740
我们要竭尽全力的协助你们
We assist with everything possible.

356
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,820
这样的话...
So...

357
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,940
就看你们的表演了,兄弟
This is your show,<i> bratři.</i>

358
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,300
那么 我们目前知道海德里希每天
So, we know that Heydrich returns to his family

359
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,460
回到帕内斯克的家里
every day at Panenské Břežany.

360
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,260
但他家里的庄园和办公的堡垒都处于戒备森严的状态
But, both his chateau and the castle are both heavily guarded.

361
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,860
他们不是可行的目标
They are not feasible targets.

362
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,180
但是每一个月
But once a month,

363
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,460
他都会乘火车去一次柏林
he also travels to Berlin, by train.

364
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,030
我们可以据此预判他的出行
And we can predict this

365
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,940
因为他的乘坐的车厢会提前几天准备好
because his personal carriages are prepared several days in advance.

366
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,260
但还是同样的 火车站和火车厢都会处于戒备森严的状态
But, again, the station and the train are both heavily guarded.

367
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,780
那在布拉格郊外让他的火车脱轨怎么样？
What about derailing the train outside of Prague?

368
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,020
我们可以把他的火车弄脱轨
We can derail the train,

369
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,830
但那并不能保证海德里希一定会被杀死
but that is no guarantee that Heydrich is killed.

370
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,740
我和我之前的学生联系上了
I have made contact with an ex-pupil of mine

371
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,260
他现在堡垒里的做修理工
who works as a repair man inside the castle.

372
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,140
他愿意给我们提供帮助
He's willing to help,

373
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,220
但是他只能知道海德里希早上到达的时间
but he only knows when Heydrich arrives in the morning

374
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,820
和他下班离开的时间
and when he leaves.

375
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,260
这能起到什么作用？
What good is that?

376
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,300
你可以此建立起一张
You can build a picture

377
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,900
他的作息时间表
of his routine.

378
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,110
有时候有辆装甲车护送他 有时候没有
Sometimes he travels with an armed escort and sometimes he does not.

379
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,940
也许这里面有规律可循
Perhaps there is a pattern in this.

380
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,980
我们在堡垒旁边 有一个藏身处
There is a safe house near the castle.

381
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,380
那个修理工每天上班之前都能送海德里希的时间表
The repairman could drop off the timetable every day before work.

382
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,420
兰卡或者玛利亚能去取一下
Lenka or Marie could collect it.

383
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,700
很好
Good.

384
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,540
然后杨和我会盯着他
And Jan and I will follow the route

385
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,900
从庄园到堡垒的路线
from the chateau to the castle.

386
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,220
先生们
Gentlemen,

387
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,100
这个行动
this operation

388
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,500
将会需要我们抵抗组织的每一名成员
will involve almost everyone we have left in the resistance.

389
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,860
已经有太多的同志们被盖世太保逮捕了
So many have been captured by the Gestapo.

390
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,180
如果你被捕的话
If you are arrested,

391
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,380
你将会面临一些残酷的现实
you will face some harsh facts.

392
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,620
你将不可能会逃跑
There will be no escape.

393
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,670
你会被严刑拷打直到吐出你知道的一切
You'll be tortured until you reveal everything you know,

394
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,350
然后你就会被处决
and then you will be executed.

395
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,420
你必须保护其他的同志们
You must protect your fellow comrades

396
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,620
通过切断和他们的一切联系（暗示就算自杀也不能被捕）
by shutting down any links you have to them.

397
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,100
[超距]行动给我们重新补充了这些
Operation Out Distance has re-supplied us with these.

398
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,190
随身携带好这些氰化物胶囊
Carry the cyanide capsules at all times.

399
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,260
我们需要结束这次会议了
We have to end our meeting.

400
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
从窗户走
Use the window.

401
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,740
安全了
Clear.

402
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,140
看起来那里有一整个卫戍兵团
Looks like there's a whole garrison there.

403
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,300
这就是我们的目标
That's our man.

404
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,420
上午9点过五分
Five minutes after 9:00.

405
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,020
他今天一个人开车
He's riding solo today.

406
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,660
等等
Wait.

407
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,870
装甲车
Armed escort.

408
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,660
相距30秒钟
Thirty seconds behind.

409
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,710
30秒
Thirty seconds.

410
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,260
30秒钟呀
Thirty seconds,30 seconds.

411
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,860
如果我们能用跟绳子
If we can use a rope

412
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,910
或者是一根钢索把奔驰停下来
or a steel cable to stop the Mercedes,

413
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,300
然后30秒之内...
then 30 seconds...

414
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,140
然后30秒钟就够了
Then 30 seconds would be all we need.

415
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,340
即使一根绳子可以把车停下来
Even if a rope can stop the car,

416
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,660
我们仍然需要超过30秒钟的时间来逃跑
we still need more than 30 seconds to escape from here.

417
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,940
并且我们不得不在这个开阔地带面对卫戍武装
And we'd have to face the armed guard here in the open.

418
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,180
这并不是我的最好的选择
It would not be my first choice.

419
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,020
但是如果这是我们唯一的选择呢？
And if it's our only choice?

420
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,260
这个行动的目的就是要成功刺杀海德里希 对吗？
The point of the mission is to succeed. Yes?

421
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,340
我更担心的是
I'm more worried that

422
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,940
我们还没准备好在任务成功之后应该怎么逃跑
we haven't planned what to do if we are successful.

423
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,940
之后发生什么 无关痛痒了（要提高自己的思想觉悟）
What happens afterwards is not important.

424
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,820
让我们沿着这条路去堡垒吧
Let's follow the route to the castle.

425
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
怎么样？
Well?

426
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,260
9点15分到达 5点15分离开（这么高军级 劳模啊）
Arrived 9:15, left 5:15,

427
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,420
有一辆装甲车护送
with an armed escort.

428
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,060
装甲车？
Armed escort?

429
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,820
在布拉格只有一个人
There's only one person in Prague

430
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,060
有装甲车护送
that travels with an armed escort.

431
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,140
你们是要去刺杀海德里希吗？
Are you going to assassinate Heydrich?

432
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,540
什么？
What?

433
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,060
目标是海德里希？
Heydrich is the target?

434
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,860
为了你们自身的安全
For your own safety,

435
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,900
你们最好不要问太多的问题了
it's best that you don't ask too many questions.

436
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,380
你说这句话是不是有点晚了
It's a bit too late for that now.

437
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,820
好吧 是你自己同意帮助抵抗组织的
Well, you agreed to help the resistance.

438
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,860
你不应该关心谁是目标
Who the target is should not concern you.

439
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,380
我们马上要帮助你们刺杀莱因哈德·海德里希了
We are about to help you assassinate Reinhard Heydrich.

440
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,580
- Of course it concerns us. 我们当然要关心了
- Okay. 好吧

441
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,780
大家都放松一下
Everyone just relax.

442
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,940
也许是我们的错误没有提醒你们其中的危险
Maybe it was a mistake not to inform you of the danger.

443
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,380
- Murder Heydrich? 谋杀海德里希？
- No, no. 不对 不对

444
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,030
刺杀海德里希
Assassinate Heydrich.

445
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,500
谋杀这个词带有他是无辜的意思
Murder implies he has a life worth living.

446
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,710
所以你认为我们就是两个
So you think we are just two little girls

447
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,820
无条件服从空降兵特工的小女孩咯？
who are here to follow the important parachutists around?

448
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,670
好嘛 兰卡
Whoa. Lenka.

449
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,140
我们已经从一开始就用自己方式在抵抗了
We've been resisting here from the beginning in our own way.

450
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,340
我个人来说的话 对杀掉某个纳粹杂种是没有任何保留的
I personally don't have any reservation to killing a Nazi pig.

451
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,390
但是不要把我们当做
But don't treat us like what you are about to do

452
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,660
你们这件事的后果对我们一点影响都没有
doesn't affect us.

453
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,020
这件事必然也将会对你们造成影响
It does and it will.

454
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,670
你应该保持你武器的清洁 因为它太脏了
And you should keep your weapon clean because it's filthy.

455
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,340
玛利亚？
Marie?

456
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,180
我的那些瓶瓶罐罐呢？
Where are all my pots and pans?

457
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,670
出口在这
This exit here, is this.

458
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,300
你看见了吗？
You see?

459
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,030
这是在这条路线里 最慢的一段
It's the slowest part of the route.

460
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,750
除了这儿 其他的地方都不可能
Anywhere else is impossible.

461
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,620
那么我们在这动手吧
So we do it here.

462
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,300
同意吗？
Agreed?

463
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,030
行
Yes.

464
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,180
也许这不是最完美的 但也是最好的办法了
Perhaps not perfect, but it's the best option.

465
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,700
很好
Good.

466
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,670
9点17分到4点41分
9:17 to 4:41.

467
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,780
没有带装甲车
Without.

468
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,230
你们真的要这样干吗？
Are you really going to go through with this?

469
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,900
我们有命令在身呐
We have our orders.

470
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,700
那么 你杀了海德里希
So, you kill Heydrich.

471
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,390
然后会怎么样？
What then?

472
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,700
你觉得不会有很多和他一样的人吗？
You think there aren't more like him?

473
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,270
他们会被调过来 然后杀戮还将继续
They come and the killing continues

474
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,780
也许比现在还要糟糕
even worse than it did before.

475
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,140
这将何时会停止？
When does it stop?

476
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,980
我希望我能回答你这个问题
I wish I had an answer for you.

477
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,700
你认为我会想得通这些吗？
You think any of this makes sense to me?

478
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,390
那么现在赶紧走吧
Then walk away now.

479
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,820
玛利亚 能走去哪呢
And go where, Marie?

480
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,140
你认为我们能逃得出这里发生的一切吗？
You think we can escape from what is happening here?

481
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,860
装作这疯狂的一切不是真的？
Pretend this madness is not real?

482
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,670
有些时候 我甚至不确定这是真的
Some days I'm not even sure it is real.

483
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,380
海德里希用恐怖织成的毯子 闷死着布拉格的人民
Heydrich chokes the people of this city with a blanket of fear.

484
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,110
人们为什么被枪决？
People are shot for what?

485
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,820
他们的种族？ 他们的信仰？他们抽烟？
Their race? Their religion? Their cigarettes?

486
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,660
你听过波兰那边的故事吗？（集中营 屠杀犹太人）
You hear the stories about Poland.

487
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,620
玛利亚 没事的
Marie, it's okay.

488
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,630
你就告诉我 我们这么做是正确的
Just tell me we are doing the right thing.

489
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,580
我觉得现在应该轮到我为那天早晨的事向你道歉了
I think it is my turn to apologize to you about the other morning.

490
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,190
你的愤怒是正确的
You were right to be angry.

491
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,470
我们应该告诉你有哪些危险
We should have told you what was at risk.

492
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,870
给你选择离开的机会
Given you the choice to walk away.

493
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,420
我爸爸之前是陆军上尉
My father was a captain in the army.

494
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,620
一直想要儿子 却得到了三个女儿
Wanted sons, got three daughters.

495
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,380
当德国控制了捷克斯洛伐克之后
He and many others were arrested in '39

496
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,500
他和许多其他的人在1939年被逮捕了
when Germany took control over Czechoslovakia.

497
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,710
然后当海德里希于去年9月在这里掌权之后
And when Heydrich took over here last September,

498
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,710
他的第一个命令 就是处决所有的犯人
his first order was to execute all the prisoners.

499
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,910
我的爸爸在头一个星期处决的那5000人里
My father was among 5,000 shot in the first week by Heydrich.

500
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,380
对于我来说 已近不存在什么放弃不放弃了
For me there's no walking away.

501
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,340
我值得为刺杀海德里希冒这个险
Heydrich is worth the risk.

502
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,230
我们已近检查过他平时的路线了
We have checked the route.

503
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,700
我们认为我们知道该怎么做了
We think we know how to do it.

504
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,140
我会安排一次会议
I will arrange a meeting.

505
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,460
后天在那家咖啡馆
At the cafe, the day after tomorrow.

506
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,460
下午三点钟
3:00 p.m.

507
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,940
我们最初的联系人
Our original contact,

508
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,820
欧德里希·诺瓦克
Oldrich Novák.

509
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,940
谁是他顶头上司？
Who was his direct handler?

510
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,420
拉迪斯拉夫·范尼克
Ladislav Vanek.

511
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,900
他就是那个最反对我们刺杀任务的人
He is the one who's most opposed to what we have to do.

512
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,790
我就想问一问 他在那么害怕什么？
All I'm asking is what is he so afraid of?

513
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,830
杨？
Jan?

514
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,900
不好意思
Sorry.

515
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,780
所以当他往这儿来
So he approaches here.

516
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,580
在克奇迈尔瓦街和霍勒斯维策尔街的交叉口
Corner of Kirchmayer and Holeschowitzer Street.

517
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,820
这里
Here.

518
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,220
是的 他的车通过那个路口的时候会开的特别慢
Yes, his car will have to really slow down to take that corner.

519
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,060
是的 当他会降到差不多10英里每小时
Yes, he slows to about 10 miles per hour.

520
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,500
我们已经平均计算出了他早上到达的大概时间
We've averaged out his morning arrival times.

521
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,430
我们能预计他在将近上午9点30分到那里
We can expect him at approximately 9:30 a.m.

522
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,580
那么武器是什么呢？
And the weapons?

523
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,380
在那个距离下 斯登冲锋枪应该能射穿车里的一切
At that range the Sten gun should hit everything within the car.

524
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,420
那辆装甲车呢？
And the armed escort?

525
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,820
我们还没找出它的规律
We have found no pattern.

526
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,660
有时候有 有时候没有
Some days, yes. Some days, no.

527
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,980
如果正好有装甲车的话
If there is an armed escort,

528
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,420
我们不要动手 等到下一次再说
we stand down and await the next day.

529
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,140
你知道我从一开始就不同意这个行动
You know I have been against this action from the start.

530
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,020
是的 这是显而易见的
Yes, that's been clear.

531
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,510
我不能在没有要求伦敦三思的情况下
I cannot give the go-ahead

532
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,100
让你们去执行这次任务
without asking London to reconsider.

533
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,700
拉迪斯拉夫 这是一次军事行动你无权下达命令...
Ladislav, this is a military operation. It's not your order to give...

534
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,900
没有抵抗组织的协助 这次任务是不可能完成的
Without the resistance, this mission doesn't exist.

535
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,980
你是想要...
Do you want to put...

536
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,180
我同意拉迪斯拉夫
I am with Ladislav.

537
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,350
我们需要让伦敦根据布拉格的实际情况
We should get London to rethink our position

538
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,420
在考虑一下
here in Prague.

539
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,700
我们有自己的命令 库达 计划照常进行
We have our orders, Curda. And nothing has changed.

540
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,270
伦敦下达命令倒是轻松
It's easy for London to give orders.

541
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,500
我们在这里卖命...
It's our lives on the line...

542
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,180
让我们等着再确认一次吧
Let's wait for re-confirmation.

543
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,540
我们已经等待了4个月了
We waited four months.

544
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,700
4个月啊
Four months.

545
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,150
伦敦需要我们行动了
London needs action.

546
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,580
那么再多等几天也不会有很大的改变
Then a few more days won't make a difference.

547
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,020
瓦切克 你多久能把发报机准备好？
Valčík, how long before you can get to the transmitter?

548
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,620
我能在后天准备好
I can get to the transmitter the day after tomorrow.

549
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:17,540
那么还需要再过几天来收到伦敦的回复
Then a couple of days for London to transmit back the answer.

550
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,580
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

551
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,700
Happy birthday. 生日快乐！
Happy birthday. 生日快乐！

552
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,660
Happy birthday, Ata. 生日快乐 阿提亚！
Thank you. 谢谢你们

553
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,940
Cheers. 干杯
Cheers. 干杯

554
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,100
干杯
Cheers.

555
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,150
干杯
Cheers.

556
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,900
It's beautiful. 这真漂亮
Thank you. 谢谢你

557
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,620
嗯...
Uh...

558
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:03,550
阿提亚 我知道这是你的生日聚会
Ata, I know this is your party,

559
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,500
但是我们有一个小小的通告要宣布
but we have a little announcement to make.

560
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,780
我已经向玛利亚求婚了 而且她答应了我
I have asked Marie to marry me and she has said yes.

561
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,100
恭喜
Congratulations.

562
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,020
- Congratulations. 恭喜你
- Thank you. 谢谢

563
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,020
Thank you. 感谢

564
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,500
Congratulations. 恭喜

565
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,780
Thank you. 谢谢你

566
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,900
我们在这里干嘛的？
Why are we here?

567
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,300
额？
Hmm?

568
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,740
我知道
I know.

569
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,470
我知道
I know.

570
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,100
谁说这不会发生
Who's to say it won't happen?

571
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,180
伦敦取消了这次行动
London calls it off.

572
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,220
你在自欺欺人 朋友
You're lying to yourself, my friend.

573
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,990
因为这要容易些
Because it is easier.

574
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,260
我需要相信这件事情一定有出路
I have to believe there is a way through this.

575
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,020
有一个普通人的生活在等着我们
That there is a normal life waiting for us.

576
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,340
就像过去的时候一样
The way things used to be.

577
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,500
玛利亚让我感到了有希望
Marie makes me feel that there is hope.

578
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,830
我爱她
I love her.

579
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,670
我真的很爱他
I do. I love her.

580
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,470
我有一个用水壶装73号手雷提高
I had the idea to transfer the 73

581
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,180
便携性的改装点子
into a water canteen for better mobility.

582
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,140
用碰撞来引爆它
Rigged for impact detonation.

583
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,390
那就不要把它们掉地上了 啊？
Don't drop them, eh?

584
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,430
这个是空的
That was the empty one.

585
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,660
一点也不好笑 杨
No, not funny, Jan.

586
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,540
一点也不
Not funny.

587
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,620
类人猿行动继续
"Anthropoid proceed.

588
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,740
停止
"Stop.

589
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,750
最重要
"Upmost importance."

590
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,460
没有任何在之后把我们弄出去的内容吗
Nothing about getting us out afterwards.

591
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,660
出了一个问题
There's a problem.

592
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,380
我们其中一个联系人在堡垒里看到了
One of our contacts inside the castle has seen correspondence

593
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,620
命令海德里希回柏林的信件
ordering Heydrich back to Berlin.

594
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,750
然后还有一些关于在巴黎的
And there have been conversations in the household

595
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,110
一个新岗位的对话
about a new posting to Paris.

596
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,540
这意味着他一旦回了柏林
It means that once he goes to Berlin,

597
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,030
他也许将不会回来了
he may not be back.

598
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,300
他什么时候出发离开呢？
When does he leave?

599
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,550
后天
Day after tomorrow.

600
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,660
那么我们别无选择了
Then we have no choice.

601
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,700
我们明天就动手
We do it tomorrow.

602
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,590
我们明天就动手
We do it tomorrow.

603
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,940
怎么了 怎么回事？
What? What is it?

604
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,780
拉迪斯拉夫收到了伦敦的信消息
Ladislav has received a new transmission from London.

605
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,780
然后呢？
And?

606
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,380
他们同意了我取消这次行动的请求
They agreed with my request to stand down the mission.

607
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,020
我相信我们把情况看的很清楚
We believe we see the situation clearly,

608
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,940
所以根据这样的情况
therefore, given the situation,

609
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,020
任何针对第三帝国官员的行动
any actions against officials of the German Reich

610
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,380
都不予以考虑
do not come into consideration.

611
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,260
让金德拉组织知道
Let the Jindra group know.

612
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,500
不可能
No.

613
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,460
拉迪斯拉夫
Ladislav,

614
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,460
我刚解码了一份伦敦来的消息
I've just decoded a message from London.

615
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,340
"继续. 最重要的."
"Proceed. Upmost importance."

616
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,500
但是我这封明确告诉你了要取消任务
But this clearly states you must stand down.

617
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,100
你被骗了 这是给金德拉的
You are deluded. This is for Jindra.

618
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,380
所以我们怎么样才能识别它的真伪？
So how can we recognize this?

619
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,270
那么至少要等着我们来澄清它的真伪
Then at least wait for us to clarify it.

620
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,140
这个消息也许取代了你的命令
It may have superseded your order.

621
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,980
我们没时间了
We have no time.

622
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,180
过了明天 海德里希就要走了
After tomorrow Heydrich will be gone.

623
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,220
我同意约瑟夫的
I agree with Josef.

624
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,260
我不认为这是一个直接的命令
I don't think this is a direct command.

625
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,860
我相信这封消息的目的是要安抚金德拉内部紧张的神经
I believe its purpose is to calm the nerves in Jindra.

626
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,100
我知道你们都不信任我
I know you all doubt me.

627
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,500
No, Ladislav...没有啊 拉迪斯拉夫...
Please stop. 请别解释了

628
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,180
怀疑我通敌卖国
Suspect me of collaboration.

629
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,590
我知道你们派人跟踪我了
I know you've had me followed.

630
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,380
我理解你对我的不信任 但是
I understand you don't trust me, but,

631
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,940
如果我是盖世太保的卧底
if I was an informer for the Gestapo,

632
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,220
你觉得你为什么还能站在这里？
do you think you would still be here?

633
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,380
你觉得呢？
Do you?

634
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,700
那么告诉我 拉迪斯拉夫
Then you tell me, Ladislav.

635
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,390
你在害怕些什么呢？
What are you afraid of?

636
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,860
我害怕的是捷克斯洛伐克将被从地图上永远的抹去
I fear Czechoslovakia will be wiped from the map.

637
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,420
你问我是否害怕呢？
You ask me if I'm afraid?

638
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,070
是的 我害怕
Yes, I'm afraid.

639
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,460
杨 海叔 我们明天动手
Jan, Uncle, we do it tomorrow.

640
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,220
按计划的来
As planned.

641
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,510
希望上帝保佑你
May God be with you.

642
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,180
杨
Jan.

643
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,980
我在阵地上朝人射击过 从没在近距离杀过人
I've shot at men in the field. Never killed one up close.

644
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,340
把枪给我把枪给我
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

645
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,140
-I don't want to die tomorrow. 我明天不想死
-Give me the gun. 把枪给我

646
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,180
深呼吸深呼吸
Breathe. Breathe.

647
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,620
现在...
Now...

648
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,220
谢谢你 莫拉维斯太太谢谢你
Thank you, Mrs. Moravec. Thank you.

649
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,020
好的深呼吸 深呼吸
Okay. Breathe. Breathe.

650
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,700
深呼吸 深呼吸 杨
Breathe. Breathe, Jan.

651
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,860
好的
Good.

652
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,740
现在 就像我们之前训练的一样
Now, as we were trained.

653
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,220
就像我们训练的一样 把注意力集中在细节上
As we were trained. Concentrate on the detail.

654
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,540
很好
Good.

655
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,340
很好
Good.

656
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,220
很好
Good.

657
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,940
我们不害怕
We are not afraid.

658
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,590
杨 我们不害怕
Jan, we are not afraid.

659
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,150
捷克斯洛伐克不害怕
Czechoslovakia is not afraid.

660
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,220
嗯？
Huh?

661
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,380
我会在街上等你
I will wait for you up the street.

662
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,540
海叔告诉我 我们一段时间内都不用过来了
Uncle said we weren't needed for a while.

663
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,300
你们是不是今天动手
Is it today?

664
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,500
向我保证（活着回来）
Promise me.

665
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,900
我们时间足够
We have plenty of time.

666
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,310
8点25分
8:25.

667
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,740
库达在哪里?
Where's Curda?

668
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,670
无所谓了
Never mind.

669
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,060
瓦切克 你去我后面的这条街
Valčík, you take this street behind me.

670
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,660
今天有阳光 所以拿着这个
We have some sun, so take this.

671
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,740
如果他过来的时候 没有装甲车的话
If he approaches without an armed escort,

672
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,900
用这个发信息
then use it to signal.

673
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,980
如果有装甲车呢？
And if he does?

674
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,700
那么点一根烟
Then... Then light a cigarette.

675
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,220
当他的车减速过路口的时候
When the car slows to take the corner,

676
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,420
我会冲出来用斯登枪开火
I will step out and open fire with the Sten gun.

677
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,540
这就是动手的信号
This will signal the attack.

678
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,380
杨 你等在我的后面
Jan, you stand behind the attack point

679
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,580
如果有装甲车的话 你就朝它扔反坦克手雷
so you can throw grenades at the armed escort if there is one.

680
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:47,110
欧帕卡 在他开过来的时候 你尝试着慢慢的过马路
Opálka, you try a slow walk across here.

681
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,180
也许你可以让他在
As he approaches, maybe you can slow him down

682
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,780
到路口之前就减速
before he takes the corner.

683
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,820
都明白吗？
Is that clear?

684
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:54,940
是的
Yeah.

685
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,740
祝大家好运
Good luck.

686
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,700
-All good? 一切都好吗？
-Good. 没问题

687
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,740
就像我们训练的一样
As we were trained.

688
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,220
大家行动吧！
Let's move!

689
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,390
停！
Stop!

690
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,580
你刚才在哪啊 库达？
Where were you, Curda?

691
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:54,020
我之前并不认为你真的会动手
I didn't think that you were really going to do it.

692
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,780
现在广播里到处都是你打中他了吗？
It's all over the radio. You shot him?

693
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,860
广播里说 投入了2万党卫军部队
The radio said 20,000 SS troops

694
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,740
在搜捕我们
have been drafted in to look for us.

695
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,310
我需要把我的家人弄出布拉格
I need to get my family out of Prague.

696
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,380
不行 库达
No, Curda.

697
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,380
任何人都不许动 库达
No one is going anywhere, Curda.

698
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,790
你现在尝试逃跑的话 他们会
You try and run now and they will pick you up

699
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,510
在你逃出城之前把你抓住
before you reach the city limits.

700
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:11,860
你现在回家 保持冷静 把嘴闭紧
You go home to your family, you stay calm, you shut your mouth.

701
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,900
你觉得你可以做到吗？啊？好的
You think you can do that? Huh? Yeah.

702
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,750
-We failed, Curda. 我们行动失败了 库达
-Failed? No. 失败了？不要啊

703
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,180
我们失败了
We failed.

704
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:42,740
杨？
Jan?

705
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:44,820
杨
Jan.

706
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,590
那个斯登冲锋枪...
The Sten...

707
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,660
我真的很对不起
I'm sorry.

708
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:10,700
卡尔·法兰克暂时取代了海德里希的职位
Karl Frank has temporarily taken Heydrich's place,

709
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:14,980
他宣布全国进入紧急状态 并实行宵禁
and has proclaimed a state of emergency and a curfew.

710
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:20,660
<i>任何提供线索 并致使罪犯落网的人</i>
<i>A reward of 10 million crowns will be given for any information</i>

711
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,300
<i>将获得一千万克朗的奖励</i>
<i>that leads to the arrest of the criminals.</i>

712
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,700
<i>任何协助罪犯的人</i>
<i>Anyone caught aiding the criminals</i>

713
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:29,580
<i>全家都会被枪毙</i>
<i>will be shot,along with his entire family.</i>

714
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,180
你们刚才出了什么问题？
What went wrong out there?

715
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:51,780
我们根本就没有杀掉他
We didn't even kill him.

716
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,260
受伤了
Wounded.

717
01:07:58,540 --> 01:07:59,700
有多严重？
How bad?

718
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,940
这很难说
It's hard to say.

719
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,380
党卫军仍然包围着医院
The SS still have the hospital surrounded,

720
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,540
所以我猜他还活着
so presumably, he's still alive.

721
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:15,940
看起来德国人在这里的军队和枪炮
It seems like the Germans have more men and guns up there

722
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,900
比在东线战场都要多
than on the Eastern Front.

723
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,940
他们已经抓了好几千的人质了
They have taken several thousand hostages.

724
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,260
所以 我们该怎么做呢？
So, what do we do now?

725
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:32,300
没有东西现在能进出布拉格了
Nothing is leaving or entering Prague.

726
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,620
他们正挨家挨户的搜查
They are searching door to door.

727
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,220
我们已经没有藏身所了
We have no safe houses left.

728
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,940
那么 我们该去那？
So, where do we go?

729
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,700
我已经请求了神父弗拉基米尔·帕特里克
I've asked Father Vladimir Petrek.

730
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,140
他同意了把所有
He has agreed to hide

731
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,740
仍在布拉格的空降兵们都藏起来
all the parachutists that are still here in Prague

732
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:56,580
直到我们能把你们送回伦敦去
until we can return you to London.

733
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,510
在这里等几个小时
Wait here, a few hours.

734
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,550
我会找到一条去大教堂的安全线路
I will find a safe route to the cathedral.

735
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,020
喂
Hey.

736
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,020
告诉我
Tell me.

737
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,340
告诉我
Tell me.

738
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,140
玛利亚 玛利亚
Marie. Marie. Marie.

739
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,300
玛利亚 玛利亚
Marie. Marie. Marie.

740
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,700
没事的 没事的
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

741
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,460
德国人把人质们在路边集拢起来然后...
The Germans were rounding up hostages off the street and...

742
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,660
她想要逃跑
She tried to escape.

743
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,430
没事的
It's okay.

744
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,540
没事的 没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

745
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,670
-Josef 约瑟夫
-Jan! 杨！

746
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:52,700
住手 住手 约瑟夫 住手
Stop. Stop. Josef, stop.

747
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,700
-Stop! Josef. 住手！约瑟夫
-It's my fault. 都是我的错

748
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,300
-Josef, it's not your fault. 约瑟夫不是你的错
-It's my fault. 都怪我

749
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,660
约瑟夫 你听我说！
Josef, listen to me!

750
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:59,420
-Listen to me. 你听我说
-It's my fault. 都怪我

751
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:02,140
Stop! Listen to me. 住手！听我说
Listen to me. 听我说

752
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,500
你这是在拿所有人的生命在冒险
You're risking the lives of everyone.

753
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,420
为了什么？ 就为了杀几个德国鬼子？
For what? To shoot a few Germans?

754
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,100
她不在了约瑟夫 她不在了
She's gone. Josef, she's gone.

755
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,260
这不是你的错啊？
It's not your fault. Huh?

756
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,420
It's my fault.
It's not your fault.

757
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,460
-It's my fault. 都是我的错
-It's not your fault, Josef. 这不怪你 约瑟夫

758
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,420
这不是你的错 好吗
It's not your fault, okay.

759
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,060
对不起 杨
I am sorry, Jan.

760
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,620
对不起 玛利亚
I'm sorry, Marie.

761
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,420
对不起 莫拉维斯太太
Mrs. Moravec, I'm sorry.

762
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:05,780
喂
Hey.

763
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,500
喂 没事的 没事的
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

764
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,300
会没事的
It's okay.

765
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,540
帕特里克神父会在那见你
Father Petrek will meet you in there.

766
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,020
我会让阿提亚来送方赶紧 赶紧
I'll send food with Ata. Go, go.

767
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,460
感谢你
Thank you.

768
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,580
我毫不后悔
I regret nothing.

769
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,900
你是我见过最勇敢的人
You are the bravest men I have ever met.

770
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:46,190
我是神父帕特里克 欢迎
I'm Father Petrek. Welcome.

771
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,780
请跟我过来
Please, come with me.

772
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,660
这是我们隐藏的地窖你在这里会安全的
This is our hidden crypt. You will be safe there.

773
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,740
感谢你 神父
Thank you, Father.

774
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,500
你做到了
You made it.

775
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:45,820
约瑟夫
Josef.

776
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:47,780
先生们
Gentlemen.

777
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:50,590
这是施瓦茨 布布里克和户卢比
This is Švarc, Bublík and Hrubý.

778
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,780
他们是春天空投的那一批
They are from the airdrop this spring.

779
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,940
无聊也许现在是我们最大的敌人
Boredom may be the biggest enemy we have here.

780
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,590
我建议随时都要有三个人
I'm suggesting three men on guard duty

781
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,380
在中殿的阳台值班
in the nave balcony at all times.

782
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,500
我们每6个小时轮换一班岗
We rotate every six hours.

783
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,420
你们三个人值头班岗
These three take first watch.

784
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,940
很抱歉 这并不是我们当时想到的局面
I'm sorry it wasn't the outcome we all hoped for.

785
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,180
除了我们 其他人也没想到的
None more than us.

786
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,820
莱因哈德·海德里希在医院死掉了
Reinhard Heydrich has died in hospital.

787
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:31,020
由袭击造成的伤害直接导致的死亡
A direct result of the injuries sustained in the attack.

788
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:46,190
昨天 德国人去了一个叫里迪斯的村子
Yesterday, the Germans went to a village, Lidice,

789
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:49,020
杀了每一个超过16岁的男子
and shot every man over the age of 16.

790
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:54,380
妇女和孩子们被送去了集中营
The women and children have been taken to camps,

791
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,540
房子都被夷为了平地
and the buildings were razed to the ground.

792
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:02,020
有传言说那个村子如何的帮助过你们
There has been talk that the village aided you somehow.

793
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,740
我从没去过里迪斯啊
I've never even been to Lidice.

794
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:11,420
现在是恐怖的时期
These are dangerous times.

795
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,980
仅仅是因为某些流言就能将一整个村子从地球上抹去
Mere gossip wipes a whole village from the face of the Earth.

796
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:19,390
今天卡尔·法兰克发表了一个特赦广播
Today Karl Frank issued an amnesty broadcast.

797
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,900
任何透露刺客消息的人
A full pardon for any person and their family

798
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:26,700
和其家人都将被无条件的赦免
in exchange for any information about the assassins,

799
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:29,460
即使是他们之前没有站出来
even if they did not come forward before.

800
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,820
但是这有五天的有效期
But there is a deadline of five days.

801
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:39,300
在那之后 他们计划处决3万捷克人
After that, they plan to execute 30,000 Czechs.

802
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,860
-This must stop.       这必须被阻止
-What do you propose?  你有什么建议吗？

803
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:55,590
我和约瑟夫会到一个公园去
Me and Josef will go to a park,

804
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,100
在我们脖子上挂一个牌子写着我们杀了海德里希
place placards around our necks saying that we killed Heydrich

805
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,580
然后就自杀
and commit suicide.

806
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,660
杨 别犯傻了
Jan. Stupid talk.

807
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,340
这个主意太愚蠢了
This is stupid talk.

808
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,100
作为一个军人
As a soldier,

809
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:07,780
你的责任是活着一直战斗下去
it is your duty to stay alive and continue fighting.

810
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:11,420
你明白吗 库比奇准尉？
Do you understand that, Warrant Officer Kubiš?

811
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:21,020
你死了德国人也不会停手的
The responsibility does not rest with you.

812
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,100
我们都知道这一切是谁的错
We know who is responsible.

813
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:26,940
他们最终一定会付出代价 会有那么一天的
They will have to answer eventually, and they will.

814
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:31,940
如果我没有这样的信念 我也不可能在这里
If I didn't believe that, I would not be here now.

815
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,030
感谢你 神父
Thank you, Father.

816
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:08,340
阿提亚
Ata.

817
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,580
你看到玛利亚了吗？
Have you seen Marie?

818
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,670
她还好吗?
Is she well?

819
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,700
在这些砖和石墙的外面
Beyond this brickwork and masonry,

820
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,940
有一条大的主下水管道通向河流
there is a large main sewer that empties into the river.

821
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,900
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

822
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,820
我在神父帕特里克的办公室里找到了一些草图
I found some plans in Father Petrek's office.

823
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:18,540
现在如果我们能把这里凿穿的话 我们就可以逃出去了
Now, if we can chisel through this, we have a means of escape.

824
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:19,740
往哪里逃呢？
Escape to where?

825
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,420
好吧 直到英国派出援救计划之前
Well, until the British send plans for our rescue,

826
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,700
我们算是困在这里了
we are stuck here.

827
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,740
但是万一我们被发现了 又冲不出去的话
But should we be discovered, there is no way out.

828
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,100
我希望至少我们能有条出路
I would like us at least to have this option.

829
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,740
我们逃出去之后就在街上碰碰运气吧
We would then take our chances in the streets.

830
