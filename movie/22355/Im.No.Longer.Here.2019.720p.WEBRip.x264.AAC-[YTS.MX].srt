00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:41,750
A COUNTERCULTURE MOVEMENT KNOWN
FOR ITS LOVE OF CUMBIA FLOURISHED.

00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:46,004
IT CALLED ITSELF "KOLOMBIA."

00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:54,512
TERKO: SOMEONE STUBBORN, RESISTANT
TO CHANGE REGARDING HIS/HER ATTITUDE

8
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,415
Ulises!

9
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,379
I thought I'd already missed you.

10
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,923
What are you doing here, Chaparra?

11
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,760
For you. So you wouldn't miss us too much.

12
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,929
-How did you do it?
-You know...

13
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,515
Let's go already!

14
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,935
Go on, they're waiting.

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,480
Damn it,Â Chaparra.

16
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,078
Call me, okay?

17
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,668
Terkos forever.

18
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,623
Hey, Mr. Lo?

19
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,459
QUEENS, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES

20
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,684
Dude!

21
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,231
This way.

22
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,442
Just take the trash out.

23
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,654
Not much. Quick job.

24
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,197
And...

25
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,616
Scoop and painting materials.

26
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,577
Maybe...

27
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,664
Hi, honey, hold on a second,
I'm doing some work stuff.

28
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,499
I'll call you right back. Sure.

29
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,833
Love you.

30
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,293
What do you think?

31
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,211
Quick job.

32
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,921
Three weeks for that job.

33
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,172
Come on!

34
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,465
Four days. Don't fuck with me.

35
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,675
Not paying you more.

36
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,635
-No, three weeks.
-No way.

37
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,470
Okay, good luck then.

38
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,140
Hey, dude, let's go! What's wrong?
Are you stupid today or what?

39
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,899
Yes, who's calling?

40
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,485
<i>I want to send a shout-out to my crew.</i>

41
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,154
Sure thing, brother.Â 
Where are you calling us from?

42
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,322
<i>From the other side.</i>

43
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,825
From where, brother?

44
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,412
<i>-From New York.</i>
-Wow, how international!

45
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,789
Who's the shout-out for?

46
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,625
<i>-It's for...</i>
-Brother, they're telling me

47
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,086
that they're about to makeÂ 
an official announcement.

48
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,005
But please, hold on, don't hang up yet.

49
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,673
Let us at least write down your shout-out.

50
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,468
<i>The Federal Government.</i>

51
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,554
<i>My fellow citizens,</i>

52
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,223
<i>Mexico is going through many changes.</i>

53
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,851
<i>Since my first day as President,</i>

54
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,521
<i>security has been the highest priority</i>
<i>for my government.</i>

55
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,734
<i>This is the issue to which we're giving</i>
<i>the most attention,</i>

56
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,320
<i>as we increase manpower</i>
<i>everyday in order...</i>

57
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,363
Let's go!

58
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,907
He can help you.

59
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,952
I came to give you a message
this afternoon,

60
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,456
one for all the people that are suffering,

61
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,624
so they can hear the voice of God.

62
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,586
He's the only one
that can change your life,

63
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,421
just like he changed mine

64
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,841
when I was most desperate,
sad, and lonely.

65
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,269
Okay, dude! Stop it, already, bro!

66
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,188
Quit drooling, dude.

67
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,774
You look like you like black cocks.
Come on!

68
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,193
He's in love with one of those
African American guys.

69
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,944
Come on, dude!

70
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,297
-Hand me the other one.
-Just take one.

71
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,175
-I can take another one.
-Where are the boots I gave you?

72
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,760
They're for your own safety.

73
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,261
Don't be so stubborn, man.

74
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,687
-Let's do it. Let's keep going.
-Come on, buddy.

75
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,897
Well, well, looks like he's
going to be in a magazine.

76
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,815
Which one?

77
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,067
Which one do you think?
<i>Animal Planet,</i> probably.

78
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,863
-For sure, dude!
-He does have a chicken on his head.

79
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,956
A FEW MONTHS EARLIER

80
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,507
<i>All the crew to the dance floor.</i>

81
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,942
Feel the rhythm.

82
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,402
And to everyone from the crew
of the Devils of the 113.

83
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,280
Everyone raise your hands! Let's go!

84
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:53,950
Work it, work it.

85
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,370
And that's how you dance cumbia.

86
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,791
That's how you dance cumbia
here in Monterrey.

87
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,557
And who do we have here?
All the Pelones, your people,

88
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,643
the Esquineros. Everyone dancing cumbia.

89
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,771
Everyone, start getting in gear,

90
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,439
because tonight...

91
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,818
Tonight we're cranking it up.

92
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,283
For all the people tonight,

93
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,619
let's enjoy and follow
to the "Kolombiano" rhythm.

94
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,707
The Kolombian music and cumbia
that we'll experience tonight dancing.

95
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,792
People, start your engines

96
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,837
to the rhythm of this cumbia.
Feel it, feel it.

97
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,382
There. For all the crazies out there.
Move your hands up.

98
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,343
Up, up! Work it, work it!

99
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,637
That's how you dance.

100
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,692
And keep dancing!

101
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,196
Work it, work it!

102
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,664
Work it, work it!

103
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:31,339
Come, enjoy this cumbia.
Feel the cumbia tonight.

104
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,883
<i>Â¡Viva la cumbia!</i>

105
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,552
<i>What song do you want, Nono?</i>

106
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,680
<i>Play "Cumbia Campesina"</i>
<i>from Los Corraleros.</i>

107
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,390
<i>For sure, it's coming up.</i>

108
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,644
<i>-And a shout-out to yourself, you're cool.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

109
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,521
-Ulises!
<i>-And another one to the Payasos...</i>

110
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,065
Ulises, go get some Coke!

111
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,900
<i>...Chiquis, Pow, El Fresa, El Grano...</i>

112
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,528
For fuck's sake! Are you deaf?
Hurry, go get some Coke!

113
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,156
<i>...to everyone, to Chiqui</i>
<i>and the Naughty Ones, okay?</i>

114
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,074
Hey!

115
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,703
<i>...and the ones from Valle del Sol,</i>
<i>and the Scandalous ones,</i>

116
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>and also a shout-out to the Marquis,</i>
<i>the Cres-bians, and the Crazies.</i>

117
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,144
What's up, Terko?
Can I have a little for a beer?

118
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,604
No, dude, I don't have enough.

119
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,398
-Not even a five?
-Nothing, dude.

120
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,482
Damn, buddy.

121
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,445
<i>I think I saw you dancing one day</i>

122
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,906
<i>I think I saw you showing off</i>

123
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,910
<i>At the square of my hometown</i>

124
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,622
<i>Dancing cumbia, dancing cumbia</i>

125
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,625
<i>And I remember that beautiful melody</i>

126
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,628
<i>I remember dancing you told me</i>

127
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,380
<i>How sweet this is</i>

128
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,257
<i>How sweet this is</i>

129
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,302
Hey!

130
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,598
-I'll beat the crap out of you.
-Come down, dudes!

131
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,099
-They're beating up IsaÃ­!
-Who is?

132
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,809
Some assholes from the courts.

133
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,811
What did that idiot do now?

134
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,813
They said he stole some chains.

135
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,943
-Follow him and you'll get it.Â 
-Get off, dude.Â 

136
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,488
Go talk to Leon, dude!

137
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,740
You'll come down eventually, dude.

138
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,201
Go fuck yourselves!

139
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,413
Get down, dude.

140
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:10,831
Hurry.

141
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,795
Hey! Ulises!

142
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,006
This kid wants to hang with us.

143
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,472
-What? Are you a Kolombia?
-For sure.

144
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,974
-What's your name?
-Leo.

145
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,769
-Who do you run with?
-With no one.

146
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,146
Maybe we should just beat
the crap out of this kid.

147
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,774
-Are you sure you're a Kolombia?
-For sure.

148
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,777
I'm wearing this sweatshirt
but my baggy clothes are at home.

149
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,197
"Sweatshirt?" You mean "hoodie,"
dude. Don't be stupid.

150
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,824
-Has he been up there yet?
-Not yet.

151
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,743
Let's go then, Sweatshirt.

152
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,039
So what's up? Are you in school?

153
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,374
No, dude, I got expelled.

154
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,710
-What did you do, kiddo?
-I slapped the principal.

155
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,756
-Oh, please!
-That's a real Terko, man.

156
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,885
This fucking radio is worthless.
It's all shout-outs and no music.

157
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,097
Shut up. You're not Kolombia, dude.
Don't pretend like you are.

158
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,975
I think this bitch was listening
to NorteÃ±as, right?

159
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,812
-NorteÃ±as? Really?
-What a fucking narco.

160
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,189
What's up, guys?
You can't go through here.

161
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,192
But, LeÃ³n, buddy, we don't have a dime.

162
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,944
I'm not charging a toll.

163
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,654
Why would you think that?

164
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,489
I'm an honorary Terko.

165
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,283
So why can't we?

166
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,993
When I went around the corner

167
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,452
I saw two armored trucks.

168
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,746
That street is no good.
I snuck through the alley,

169
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,623
-and outsmarted them.
-Hey!

170
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,877
My cousin just texted me,
he said the street is closed.

171
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,170
-Another gang or what?
-It's the police.

172
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,756
They're probably hunting someone down.

173
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,759
Let's turn around, dude.

174
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,760
Really, man?

175
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,929
What, are you scared, or what?

176
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,599
Don't be stupid, we don't even know
what's going on up there.

177
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,808
Let's turn around.

178
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:55,686
-Let's go.
-Hey kids, give me something for a beer!

179
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,271
Get a job!

180
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,857
I sing in buses, dude!

181
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,401
I'm not lazy like you.

182
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,655
Be careful anyway, kids,
it's ugly up there.

183
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,450
I'm going this way too. I'm not stupid.

184
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:14,413
But be careful, kids.
Bless you anyway. Watch out.

185
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,044
Calm down, dude. He's a friend.

186
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,009
What's up, kids?

187
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,844
What are you up to?

188
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,391
-The cops were blocking our way.
-Oh, shit.

189
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,311
They don't come this way.
They know better.

190
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,105
-Who's that kid?
-That's Sweatshirt, man.

191
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,943
-You looking to get high?
-Cool, but we're out.

192
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,820
-We don't even have money.
-So you're leaving?

193
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,698
-For sure, dude.
-Give them some so they taste it.

194
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,493
No, it's cool, dude. We're leaving.
For real.

195
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,328
-Okay.
-Okay, man.

196
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,038
-Take care.
-Let's go, Terkos.

197
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,810
Hey, Ulises! Just a second, brother.

198
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,314
Come here, man.

199
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:26,944
Hey, dude.

200
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,988
Those are good kids.Â 

201
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,573
Look after them. They're so young.Â 
Especially Sweatshirt.

202
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,075
He looks like a little kid.

203
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:38,539
I wish I had someone like you
to watch out for me when I was a kid.

204
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,500
But it didn't happen.

205
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,294
And how's the family?

206
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,921
-They're fine.
-Cool.

207
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,548
And your siblings?

208
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,967
-They're good.
-They must be so big.

209
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,428
That's nice.

210
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,306
Tell your brother we miss him around here.
Me and him started this gang.

211
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,101
It's too bad that so many brothers
are in jail.

212
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,188
Want a cigarette?

213
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,194
We're here if you need us, brother.
For anything.

214
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,823
Sometimes I envy him.
He's in a nicer place.

215
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,617
I have to hustle here to survive.

216
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,203
I remember when you were a kid.

217
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,165
You couldn't talk,
but you already knew how to dance.

218
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,083
-All right, man.
-We're here.

219
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,177
Hey, Terkos! Pure <i>star</i> symbol, bros.

220
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,012
For sure!

221
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,221
Stay sharp!

222
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,646
But this is too big for me.

223
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,817
Look, bud, this is a trick I learned
from my dad at the penitentiary.

224
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,362
-So they won't fall.
-Hey, your favorite!

225
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,782
-Oh, shit. That's nice. Cool.
-It's cool.

226
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,701
That's baggy as hell, dude. It's great.

227
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,536
This shit is cool.

228
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,665
I just brought it from my house.
It's one of my favorites.

229
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,252
You like the color?
Or do you want another one?

230
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,714
This one looks cool, dude.
It matches her Converse.

231
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,674
-Yeah.
-It's cool as shit.

232
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,802
-You know it.
-Slutty red.

233
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,678
Sure.

234
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,766
You have such pretty eyes, dude,
you should flaunt them.

235
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,187
They ran away as usual, bro.
They're our bitches, like always.

236
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,147
They're just kids in diapers.

237
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,859
They didn't get it at all,
so we chased them back to their hoods.

238
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,153
And that's when the fight stopped, bro.

239
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,404
But it all went back to shit.

240
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,742
And then Jeremy, Pekesillo, and Ulises
jumped in.

241
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,662
So we got into a fist fight
with the kids from Los Padres.

242
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,916
Fuckers. We beat the crap out of them,
but they got a few punches too.

243
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:50,379
But I didn't run away. You know,
I was with IsaÃ­ and his Terkos.

244
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,589
-Right, bro?
-For sure.

245
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,217
"For sure?" Speak up, you bitch!

246
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,636
-Talk like a man.
-For sure.

247
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,264
-Louder, I didn't hear you.
-For sure!

248
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,808
-Louder, I can't hear you, bro.
-Fuck yeah!

249
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,601
You know I don't give a fuck.

250
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,898
We were in the middle of a fight
when the fucking cops showed up.

251
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:20,117
<i>How I miss my lovely savanna</i>
<i>Stuck at the mountain range</i>

252
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:25,581
<i>Waiting for the time</i>
<i>To go back to my homeland</i>

253
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,834
<i>Back in my neighborhood</i>
<i>A doll I used to date</i>

254
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,461
<i>The distance kept me sad</i>

255
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,716
<i>From all the longing</i>
<i>A cumbia blossomed out of my chest</i>

256
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,552
<i>And a tear ran through my cheek</i>

257
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,179
<i>Cumbia from the soul</i>
<i>Cumbia that rises early</i>

258
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,141
<i>Even over imprudence</i>
<i>With persistence</i>

259
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,310
<i>Looking for endurance which I find</i>

260
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,854
<i>It makes me so sad, so sad</i>

261
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,565
<i>The distance, it makes me</i>

262
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,817
<i>So sad, it makes me so sad</i>

263
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,945
<i>Being so far away from my homeland </i>

264
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,656
<i>It makes me so sad, so sad</i>

265
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,409
<i>The distance, it makes me</i>

266
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,997
<i>Being so far away from my homeland </i>

267
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,969
Hurry up, it's late! Let's go!

268
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,317
This kid's trying to find his dickÂ 
to jerk it off but he can't.

269
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,905
The hair! Does he think
he's in <i>Dragon Ball Z</i> or something?

270
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,282
He looks so mad,
I think he's trying to transform!

271
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,331
Hey! He can't come in.

272
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,751
Why not? He looks like a kid,
but he's old enough for it.

273
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,545
Come on, bud, let him in.
You already know him, dude.

274
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,006
And we've been clients here for a while.
What's up with that?

275
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,635
-Come on, dude.
-You know what?

276
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,096
Fine, go.

277
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,986
Want to dance with my friend?
What do you think?

278
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,582
This is my friend.
He just got here from Mexico.

279
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,377
Hey, <i>papi.</i>
Are we gonna wait for the next song?

280
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,716
-Is he a fag or just shy?
-I think he's both.

281
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,177
The song is paid for. Come, let's dance.

282
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,222
-Come on buddy, get up.
-Let's go.

283
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,017
-Go, dude, go dance.
-Let's go.

284
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,064
You don't want to dance?

285
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,774
Not to this shitty music.

286
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,609
Then buy me a beer.

287
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,404
Come.

288
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,536
Give me the money.

289
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,622
I'll get the beerÂ 
because that bitch hates my guts.

290
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,975
For me, it's even better
if you don't want to dance.

291
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,771
-I do dance, but not to that shit.
-What do you like then?

292
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,441
-Kolombias.
-What? Colombia?

293
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,984
That's the music I like.

294
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,944
Colombia isn't a type of music.

295
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,572
Colombia is a country. My country.

296
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,409
-Are you Colombian, for real?
-Me and half of this neighborhood.

297
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,497
What Colombian cumbia do you like?

298
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,417
Are you trying to test me?

299
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,169
How old are you?

300
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,797
Don't even tell me,
it'll make me feel bad.

301
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,306
Do you know what kind of music I like?

302
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,518
Binomio de Oro. Lizandro Mesa.

303
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,479
That's the type of music I like.

304
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,232
You're kidding me!
I have them all here, look.

305
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,740
"Cuando Lo Negro Sea Bello."
It's been ages since I heard that song.

306
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,245
Listen.

307
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,421
This sounds weird.
I think it's running out of battery.

308
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,381
And so am I.

309
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,049
It's on purpose.

310
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,635
If it's slower, it lasts longer.

311
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,304
On purpose? Why? What for?

312
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,475
I believe that when it's slower
you feel it more.

313
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,988
Thank you for the beer.

314
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,574
Change the batteries next time.

315
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,368
Bye.

316
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,380
Take him home.Â 
We're going to keep partying.

317
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,927
Sure. You know how to get home, right?

318
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,388
All right. Let's go, dude.

319
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,348
<i>-Quickly, bro.</i>
<i>-Right away.</i>

320
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,933
Come on, Chaparra!

321
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,476
YOU CAN COUNT ON MY WORD

322
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,980
Let's go. Fuck this.

323
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,608
Let's go.

324
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,219
I like it. It has a thick edge.

325
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,638
Didn't I tell you?
I knew he'd pick that one.

326
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,640
How long will it take you?

327
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,642
Not that long, it'll be quick.

328
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,894
-Right away, then.
-You got it.

329
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,148
<i>With him I have a home</i>

330
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,400
<i>For a long time</i>

331
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,321
<i>You can't give orders to your heart</i>

332
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,156
<i>It falls in love on its own</i>

333
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,327
-Come on!
-You almost hit it!

334
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,288
-You almost hit it.
-Hey, hey.

335
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,374
Hand me that joint.

336
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,641
Let's show off our new banner.
The new Terkos flag.

337
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,402
Take the next oneÂ 
so I can be in the picture.

338
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,491
Flash the gang sign, everyone!

339
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,881
Go on, play it.

340
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,092
Looks good like that.

341
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,221
Kolombiana cumbia!

342
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:24,517
Come on, Terkos, let's go!

343
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,270
Let's go, Terkos!
Dance the Kolombiana cumbia!

344
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,356
Go, Terkos! What's up?

345
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,199
Good job, Peke!

346
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,249
There's Pedro! What's good?

347
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,908
-Dance the cumbia, baby.
-Let's go!

348
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,560
Cool, cool!

349
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,036
-What's up, boss?
-What's up?

350
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,373
Welcome to the Kolombiana
music empire, bros.

351
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:14,753
Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Kolombia.
The best of the best of the neighborhood.

352
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,004
What are you looking for?

353
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,590
I was looking for something cool.
A little bit of everything.

354
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,050
Look, bud. Check this one out.

355
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,554
I have some vallenato tunes.
And some sonideras.

356
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,183
And I have some slowed down ones,
really cool Kolombias.

357
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:32,061
There's some Kolombias from Peru,
and some from Argentina.

358
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,813
And what about this?

359
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,150
-No, that's mine, it's not for sale.
-Why not?

360
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,736
It has everything you see here on it.Â 

361
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,655
-How much for it?
-Come on, bro.

362
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,159
Since it'll stay in the neighborhood,
I'll make an exception.

363
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,952
I guess it's your lucky day.

364
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,996
Give me 2,000 for it.

365
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,499
-That's a lot.
-For sure, yes.

366
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,084
What's the lowest you'll go?
We're family, right?

367
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,879
Come on, bro, it's worth it.

368
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,965
But let's do 1,500.
That's the lowest I'll go.

369
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,594
We can get you the money,
but next week though. Does that work?

370
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,013
Sure, bro.
Only if you're serious about it.

371
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,681
I mean it, for real.

372
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,683
It's for the Terkos, dude.

373
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,269
Fine, make it 1,500 and it's yours.

374
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,938
We got a deal, boss.

375
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,526
God bless you, bro. Stay sharp, kids.

376
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,278
We have to start saving
so we can buy it.

377
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:26,032
We can't spend our money on alcohol
or drugs. Nothing, dude.

378
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,370
Did you hear how many songs it had in it?

379
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,373
Yes, it was a shitload,
and from everywhere, dude.

380
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,380
-Hey, kid, you got five pesos?
-I don't have anything.

381
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,216
-It's for a good cause, brother.
-Come on, don't be a dick.

382
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,259
Come on, give it.

383
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,845
Whatever you have, bro.

384
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,973
-Come on, let's go.
-Come on.

385
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,643
How much did you get?

386
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,896
What the hell, kids?

387
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,190
I saw what you did, you little bitches.

388
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,277
Don't do that shit here.
Get the fuck out of here.

389
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,112
Why not? This is our school.

390
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,948
So what? I'm telling you not to.

391
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,450
What's your beef?
We aren't messing with you, dog.

392
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,537
So what, you bitches? I'm telling you now,

393
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,289
don't do that shit around here.

394
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,336
You got five pesos, friend?

395
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,804
What's that guy's problem?

396
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,390
Let's get the hell out of here.

397
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,394
-Stay chill and let's go.
-Yes, let's get out of here.

398
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:40,148
-Well, whatever.
-At least we got something.

399
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,733
Fucking shit.

400
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,163
What the fuck now?

401
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,884
What's up, bro?

402
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,887
Your homies already told me.

403
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:17,518
We were in school trying to get some cash
and they came to scare us away.

404
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,146
-And did they scare you away?
-No, not really, man.

405
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,316
I came to check what's up.

406
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,735
Are they rivals, or what?

407
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:29,822
They're a bunch of pussies trying
step to us, but it won't happen.

408
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:34,035
-Come, show them.
-Watch this, come.

409
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,373
<i>-My name is Shadow.</i>
<i>-And why are you here?</i>

410
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,958
<i>-They sent me to keep an eye on you.</i>
<i>-Keep an eye on us?</i>

411
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,794
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Do you know who we are?</i>

412
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,713
Holy shit! They chopped off his head.

413
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,468
And they got off easy.

414
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,096
For sure. So what,

415
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,182
I know you're Terkos and all,
but Pelones till death, right?

416
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,392
For sure.

417
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:58,976
Cool.

418
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,813
-Call us if you need us.
-Okay.

419
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,608
-Cool.
-Cool.

420
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,446
Take out your radio, Chaparra.

421
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,365
It ran out of battery.

422
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,550
Come in, make yourselves at home.

423
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,844
-The bathroom?
-Here. Hold on.

424
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,721
Come in, go ahead.

425
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,390
-Put the beers away.
-Where at?

426
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,100
That way. Close the door, bud.

427
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,769
I'll get my laptopÂ 
and get the party started.

428
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,688
We woke up your friend.

429
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,024
Don't worry about him, he doesn't bite.

430
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,734
Hi.

431
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,945
Answer, or they think you're rude
as well as ugly!Â 

432
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,531
Hey, bitch, have a beer.

433
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:58,035
Go sleep in the room if you want.
But don't be jerking off.

434
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,582
Let's keep partying.

435
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,878
What's up, want to dance?

436
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,089
-Come on, bro! Show your moves!
-Dance!

437
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,966
-Come on, dance!
-Dance!

438
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,594
Fine. I'll dance,
but only if I can pick the song.

439
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,101
Let's see what kind of shit
this dude plays.

440
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,363
Hand me the cable.

441
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,492
Here, dude. But don't break it,
or you'll have to pay me back.

442
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,578
This guy.Â 

443
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:11,692
Oh, wow, look at this kid!
Who would've thought?

444
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,389
Why did you stop it? I liked the song.

445
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,642
No, dude, my speakers are going
to get screwed. I better play my music.

446
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,394
There.

447
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:51,065
You should pass your hat around,
maybe you get enough for a taco.

448
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,359
What?

449
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,361
Show us your moves, dude.

450
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,740
What? You didn't like that, or what?

451
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,451
Fuck you, dude. You want to be black,
but you don't have the moves.

452
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,415
-What did you just say, asshole?
-Are you deaf, or what?

453
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:11,502
You better leave before I beat
the crap out of you in front of everyone.

454
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,465
Calm down, dude. We all get
made fun of when we're new.

455
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,013
What a fucking loser.

456
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,849
What, dude?

457
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,937
You're all a bunch of pussies,
go fuck yourselves.

458
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,623
Hey, you bitch!

459
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:55,935
One dollar.

460
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,397
Do you want me to do that job upstairs?

461
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,109
That Chinese guy told me
and my buddy last week

462
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,069
that he needed some work done
on the rooftop.

463
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,957
He's asking something upstairs
about the roof.

464
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,879
Gather the trash and take it down later.

465
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,008
Trash. Downstairs. Okay?

466
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,260
Yes, sir. Sure.

467
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,681
See you later. Do a good work.

468
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,560
-Hey, sir?
-What?

469
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,437
Do you have an electric...

470
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,314
an electric cable?
An electric cable, so I can...

471
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,025
So I can have light.
I'll tell the guy downstairs.

472
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,711
I'm almost done taking the trash down.

473
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,955
ROOMS FOR RENT.
DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY

474
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,884
-Okay.
-Want to go check?

475
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,262
-What?
-What to go check my work upstairs?

476
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,306
No, I can't go up there every day, man.

477
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,891
My back hurts.

478
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,601
What about the paint?

479
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,396
-Painting? Upstairs?
-No, no.

480
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,775
Painting.

481
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,196
Next time. Thanks.

482
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,001
No English speak.

483
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,049
My Spanish... isn't good.

484
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,894
Your hair.

485
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,562
My hair?

486
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,856
It's cool, I guess.

487
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:16,195
I mean, it's not as cool as it could be,
but it's cool, right?

488
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,281
Wait, are you speaking in Spanish?

489
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,618
I just told you, I don't speak English.

490
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,793
I don't understand.

491
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:35,381
Well, we're both in the same boat,
because I don't understand you.

492
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,716
<i>We'll show you the moment</i>

493
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,260
<i>when the teacher starts singing</i>
<i>with the children</i>

494
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,345
<i>despite the violent gunfire</i>
<i>they were hearing outside.</i>

495
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,847
<i>Let's listen to it.</i>

496
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,057
<i>Kids.</i>

497
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,980
<i>It's all right. We're safe in here.</i>

498
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,816
<i>But, please, keep your heads down.</i>

499
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,448
<i>Let's sing a song, okay?</i>

500
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,910
<i>-Yes!</i>
<i>-Let's sing a song... I know!</i>

501
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,912
<i>And the drops...</i>

502
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,293
Answer, fucking Chaparra.

503
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,390
Come on, brother,
you won't get it any cheaper.

504
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,475
I'm telling you.

505
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,101
I'd take it if I were you.

506
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,811
Come on, kid. It's cheap.

507
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,022
And it's even cheaper
by the week. Or the month.

508
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,471
-Who are we?
-Pelones!

509
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:55,807
-Who are we?
-Pelones!

510
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,477
-Who are we?
-Pelones!

511
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,188
-Who are we?
-The Terkos!

512
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:05,025
-Shout-out to the Devils of San Nicolas.
-The Terkos!

513
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:09,488
Shout-out to Ulises, Jeremy, Sweatshirt,
IsaÃ­, Chaparra.

514
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:15,410
To Wendy, Negra, Pekesillo, Chida,
to Prendida, and all the Terkos.

515
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,554
Hey, my friend and I want
to get a picture with you.

516
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,935
Oh, really? The celebrity!

517
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,398
He thinks he's the shit
because he knows how to dance.

518
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,650
-He won't even talk to us anymore.
-Yes, for sure.

519
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,114
With buns like those,
you don't even need the meal.

520
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,703
We only came for the kicks,
and now look.

521
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,873
I knew that fucking lookout
had something going on.

522
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,710
I saw the thing falling out
and I grabbed it right away.

523
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,837
I feel like turning it on.

524
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:52,132
No, don't do that. They're probably
looking for that shit.

525
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,051
No, dude, they can't track you
with that crap.

526
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,636
It's only good for talking.

527
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,264
Fuck it, dude.

528
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,980
It's probably not even charged.

529
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,489
<i>31, on the door.</i>

530
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,423
<i>-...single mom?</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

531
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,550
<i>Come on, honey.</i>
<i>What size pants do you wear?</i>

532
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,428
<i>Just to get an idea, here with</i>
<i>ToÃ±o the Pimp and Seppy Boy.</i>

533
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,514
<i>-Seven.</i>
<i>-Seven, sweetheart?</i>

534
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,350
<i>With all due respect,</i>
<i>you're very hot, honey.</i>

535
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,143
<i>-Thanks.</i>
<i>-For real.</i>

536
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,312
<i>And how many kids do you have?</i>

537
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:51,441
<i>-Just... one.</i>
<i>-One? How old?</i>

538
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,777
You're crazy, dude. Really.

539
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,738
-You're crazy.
-He doesn't give a shit.

540
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,409
Hey? What if we call in
and send a shout-out?

541
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,371
"To the fucking pussy who lost his radio.

542
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,331
A shout-out from all the Terkos

543
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,292
who dedicate this song to you,
and tell you to go fuck yourself."

544
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,921
So aggressive!

545
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,677
My song!

546
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,933
I like the slower version better.

547
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,018
I'll lower your panties if you want.

548
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,104
You wish.

549
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,873
Well, whatever, kid.

550
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,958
Let's get out of the road,
a truck is coming.

551
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,382
Hey, you two. Get in, you pussies. Quick.

552
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,386
Get in. I'm going to count to three,
if not, I'll shoot you.

553
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,805
-Quickly, pussies.
-Get in, you little bitches!

554
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,141
Get in the fucking truck.
Hurry the fuck up, dude!

555
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,935
Hurry the fuck in! Close it!

556
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,854
You, go fuck yourself.

557
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,939
Move it! Hit the gas!

558
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,158
Keep your heads down,
you sons of bitches.

559
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,452
You think you're tough, bitches.
You want some money?

560
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,120
Start working, you bastards.

561
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,831
Start working instead of begging
like fucking pussies.

562
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,250
You want some work, bitches?
There's lots of work here.

563
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,502
If you're pussies,
stay in your goddamn house.

564
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,964
I never want to see you out on the street
again, or I'll kill you.

565
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,467
You think you're the shit?
I'm in charge here.

566
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,760
Answer, you little bitch.

567
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:45,513
And stop dressing like this, you bitches.

568
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,433
Or I'm going to shoot you all. Understood?

569
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,227
Get out now. Move it.

570
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,063
Get the fuck out. Go!

571
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:04,157
<i>-Shut up.</i>
<i>-Say it. "Shut up, Seppy Boy."</i>

572
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,243
-<i>Where are you calling from?</i>
<i>-</i>Ulises, turn that shit off.

573
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,496
<i>From where in San Berna, sweetie?</i>

574
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,040
<i>-In...</i>
<i>-She doesn't know.</i>

575
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,876
I just got your brother to sleep.
Turn it off, please.

576
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,629
<i>Where in San BernabÃ©? Rah, rah, rah.</i>

577
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,674
<i>Where? Rah, rah, rah.</i>

578
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,759
<i>How old are you, sweetie?</i>

579
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,552
<i>-Twenty-eight.</i>
<i>-Twenty-eight years old.</i>

580
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:30,642
<i>-Wow, man. Right?</i>
<i>-So... are you single or married?</i>

581
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,060
For fuck's sake!

582
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,230
I told you you'd wake him up,
but you're so fucking stubborn!

583
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,357
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

584
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,693
<i>So, you were happily married?</i>

585
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:43,321
<i>Well... not happily, but...</i>

586
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,074
<i>You could say you were married, honey.</i>

587
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,712
Let's go, Jeremy!

588
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,929
No dude, stay here.

589
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,556
Let's go, Jeremy!

590
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,144
Jeremy!

591
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,398
Come on, dude!

592
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,344
Hey.

593
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:01,501
-They didn't even wait for you, asshole.
-No, dude, I didn't know about this.

594
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:05,380
-You're fucked now.
-No, bro, I didn't know about this.

595
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:09,259
-You're a dead man, dog.
-But I didn't know. What do I do?

596
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,804
Nothing, bitch.Â 
You and your whole family is dead now.

597
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,764
I didn't know dude, I mean it.

598
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,808
Hurry, Mom.

599
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,227
Watch out, watch out. Oh, man.

600
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,397
Careful with her.

601
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,774
-Careful.
-Go, go!

602
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,080
He says they no longer have that contact.

603
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,249
Now what?

604
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:45,545
There's someone else I know up north,
but I don't know if you'll have enough.

605
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,172
How much money do they want?

606
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,215
Please, help me.

607
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:57,015
See what happens
when you act like a little thug?

608
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,018
You ruined the life of your entire family.

609
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,232
I'm doing this for your mom, not for you.

610
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,526
She's already suffered enough.

611
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,614
You can't talk to anyone!

612
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,995
You haven't told anyone
you're here, right?

613
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,290
-But I didn't know.
-For fuck's sake!

614
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:52,278
Hi. Why are you sleeping here?

615
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,368
Do you... work for her grandpa?

616
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,537
Yes, dude.

617
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,169
Does her grandpa know you sleep here?

618
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,464
So it's okay if we wake him up
and ask him?

619
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,301
If her grandpa gave you permission
to be here,

620
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,011
why did you use the fire escape?

621
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,534
She wants to know why
you came here to sleep.

622
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,954
The fucking pussies I lived with
ganged up on me.

623
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,958
Why did they hit you.

624
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,044
There were a bunch of them, I was alone.

625
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,630
Yes, but why did you get into a fight?

626
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,842
They were making fun of my hair
and the way I speak.

627
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,186
She says she likes your...

628
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:08,896
your style.

629
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,361
I could've beat them one-on-one,
but it was me against four.

630
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,369
She wants to know who did your hair.

631
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,457
I did it myself.

632
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,130
Do you have place to stay?

633
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:35,882
I'll figure it out.

634
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,891
Where are you from?

635
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,519
From Monterrey, dude.
The assholes I lived with...

636
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,105
And where are you from, dude?

637
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,941
I'm from here, but my parents
are from Puebla and Guerrero.

638
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,485
-You know those places?
-No.

639
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,154
I don't know Monterrey either.

640
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,199
-How long you been inÂ New York?
-Not long.

641
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,334
What did she say?

642
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:13,419
She...

643
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,714
She doesn't know if she can trust you.

644
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,634
No worries. I'll get out of here.

645
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,183
Look, man. This girl is super intense.

646
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,519
I told her you want to go
and that I have to go,

647
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:32,146
but she keeps asking more questions.
So just go.

648
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,113
Dude...

649
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:44,450
tell her I know I can't stay,
but she can trust me.

650
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,078
And you too. I don't want any trouble.

651
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,331
What's your name?

652
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,542
Ulises.

653
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,346
Sixteen. How old are you?

654
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,270
Seventeen? Nice to meet you.

655
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,523
Here in the neighborhoods of Monterrey,

656
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,651
the Kolombia cumbia
has found a second home.

657
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:23,197
And here it's danced in a different way,
and people dance from a very young age.

658
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,700
-What's your name, Buddy?
-Ulises.

659
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,785
Very good, Ulises. How old are you?

660
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,831
Four. Very good. Show us your moves.

661
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,675
That's me as a kid.

662
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:54,645
What?

663
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:03,821
You... dance... now?

664
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,657
What? You want me to dance right here?

665
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,035
You crazy or what?

666
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,880
A video...

667
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,759
recent... of you, dancing?

668
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:41,234
-Look.
-Where is that?

669
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,361
In Monterrey.

670
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,867
Where... you?

671
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:55,957
That one there.

672
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,049
My crew is there too.

673
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,887
Pekesillo, IsaÃ­.

674
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,265
Chaparra.

675
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,434
Even Negra is over there.

676
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,938
I don't see Jeremy though.

677
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,566
I think he hooked up with a girl that day.

678
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:31,158
Me, Jeremy, Chaparra, Negra,
and all my crew.

679
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,202
We...

680
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,707
Yes. We are... Terkos.

681
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,543
Terkos.

682
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,296
There are lots of other gangs like us.

683
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:47,341
There's Guachalokos, Babylokos,
the Goblins,

684
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,970
the Bad Dogs, the Relapses,
and a lot of them.

685
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,597
All of them...

686
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:58,060
Everyone. We're all the <i>star</i> symbol.

687
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,189
Star symbol.

688
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,859
And star symbol,

689
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,112
we're more "verga," <i>star</i> symbol...

690
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,449
Yes, it's good. Yes.

691
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,161
And it's a star because

692
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,289
there are five points in the map,

693
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,042
five points in the map,

694
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,379
Yes, the map of Monterrey.

695
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,215
If you join the five points,

696
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,510
they make up a star. Like this.

697
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,267
Yes, they make up a star. Like that.

698
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,439
Like this.

699
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,025
This one with this one.

700
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,866
Like this. See.Â 

701
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,827
Oh, wait.

702
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,686
Please, very late.

703
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:25,064
When you go up... go very late.

704
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:30,444
Watch out... for my grandpa...

705
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:34,615
...or the police... so they don't see you.

706
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,786
Be careful, okay?

707
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,622
Thank you, Lin. Thanks.

708
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,321
FOR ULISES
FROM LIN

709
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,089
Hey, thank you for the things.

710
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,761
I figured out a way how to make money.

711
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,847
-Money, you know? Dancing.
-What?

712
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,182
Dancing. Metro.

713
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,017
Subway.

714
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:11,021
Dancing at the subway. Money.

715
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:13,607
Down, down.

716
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,160
Your hair.

717
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,497
There you go.

718
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,208
That's it.

719
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,850
I also need a hair style change,
but I don't have my tools.

720
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,021
Although I can do something else for you.

721
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:05,993
Hey, don't use the word "verga"
for everything.

722
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:07,536
What?

723
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,623
Don't say "verga" so much.

724
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,501
How can I explain it?

725
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,796
Forget it.

726
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:56,080
Come here, friends, get closer.
Make a line, please.

727
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,207
-Don't be greedy.
-There's groceries for everyone.

728
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,250
-Here.
-From the "F" Cartel. Remember that.

729
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:03,128
Come closer and make a line, please.

730
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,756
The government and the police
do nothing for you guys.

731
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:09,051
We're helping you and giving
groceries to everyone.

732
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,928
Everyone will get groceries. Come.

733
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:30,841
Hey, man, have a seat.

734
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,802
Hey, do you need a hand?

735
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:35,137
No, man.

736
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:38,015
Do you know some place that needs a hand?

737
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,142
Not really, bro, sorry.

738
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:42,769
Thank you.

739
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:25,646
TAKE CARE
WHEREVER YOU ARE, WE MISS YOU.

740
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:28,857
WE WON'T FORGET YOU
COUNTING THE DAYS TO SEE YOU

741
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:33,737
YOU DOG, YOU DON'T TALK ANYMORE!
DID YOU FORGET US?

742
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:06,937
What do you want, Lin?

743
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,818
Dancing? Metro? Money?

744
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,947
Well, to be honest, it didn't work out.

745
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,621
I'm sleepy, Lin.

746
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:33,589
I don't understand you, Lin.

747
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:44,766
What are you looking for?

748
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,233
What is it that you want, Lin?

749
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,261
I...

750
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:23,764
wanted...

751
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,268
to know...

752
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:30,729
day...

753
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:35,150
dancing, metro, and money, you? Good?

754
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:38,028
I told you, I didn't dance.

755
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,197
-No.
-No dancing.

756
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:43,950
You didn't go? No dancing? No money?

757
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:48,664
It's that... I can't do it alone.

758
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,751
Alone? No "vergas?"

759
01:17:58,423 --> 01:18:00,425
Fucking shit. I don't understand it.

760
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:38,338
You... nervous?

761
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:40,507
Yes, that.

762
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,426
Not good!

763
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:44,010
You know what, Lin?

764
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,515
I'm really tired.
We can talk tomorrow, if you want.

765
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,200
Good night.

766
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,661
Good night, Lin.

767
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:48,867
Fiesta... Dancing?

768
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:52,829
I don't understand.

769
01:19:54,664 --> 01:19:55,916
Your hair...

770
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:57,459
Fix.

771
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:01,129
Do you want some food?

772
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:11,867
What are you talking about?

773
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,828
About... school.

774
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,880
That music sucks, right?

775
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,508
The music sucks.

776
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:34,472
I'm going for a walk.

777
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:35,849
A walk.Â 

778
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:09,192
<i>They set up a roadblock</i>
<i>on Alfonso Reyes...</i>

779
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:11,111
-Hello, son?
<i>-...by Plaza de Toros...</i>

780
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:13,822
What's going on? Why the hell
haven't you called me?

781
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:16,574
<i>...buses were used to create a roadblock.</i>

782
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:19,327
<i>According to witnesses,</i>
<i>someone spoke to the drivers...</i>

783
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,912
Are you stupid or what?

784
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,539
<i>...and ordered them to get out</i>
<i>so they could block...</i>

785
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:25,083
Well, the moment you even think about

786
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:28,420
or attempt to get on a busÂ 
and come this way,

787
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,463
forget that you have a mother.

788
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:31,881
Let me tell you why.

789
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:36,052
The moment you step a foot here,
I won't have a son,

790
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,221
because they're going to kill you,Â 
you idiot.

791
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:29,481
Hey, you can't come in.

792
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,569
I came to see a friend.

793
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:36,571
The way you're dressed, you can't come in.

794
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,948
It's Gladys, the Colombian.

795
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:42,535
Call her. It's urgent, dude.

796
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:43,995
That's what everyone says.

797
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,625
Call her! She's my mom.

798
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:18,071
Look, boy. I know you've had
a really hard time here.

799
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:22,075
But in this country,
you're not the first nor the last.

800
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:27,831
Did you think you'd get invited
to the White House on your first day?

801
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:29,457
No, buddy.

802
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:36,923
Look. I already bored you.
You're falling asleep.

803
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,510
No... I just haven't slept well.

804
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,887
Miss, the bill, please.

805
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:02,699
It's here.

806
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,244
You'll spend the night here.

807
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:09,205
Think of this asÂ a mutual favor.

808
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,796
But remember it.

809
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,215
You can stay here.

810
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:27,932
-Are you listening to me?
-Yes.

811
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:30,643
-Put some music on.
-What?

812
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,270
I need some privacy.

813
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,117
I'll turn it off. Lord, this is horrible.

814
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,643
<i>Today that I find myself alone and sad</i>

815
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,521
<i>Today that I find myself alone and sad</i>

816
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,649
<i>Thinking about a beautiful rose</i>

817
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:02,360
<i>Remember what you told me</i>

818
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,280
<i>You're the owner of my heart</i>

819
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:08,241
<i>I remember what you told me</i>

820
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:11,411
<i>You're the owner of my heart</i>

821
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:17,625
Hey, Jeremy! The people from the Terkos!
Hey, Ulises!

822
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:21,838
-Enjoy the cumbia. Enjoy it.
-Let's dance!

823
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:26,551
Let's enjoy it!

824
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,470
-Who are we?
-The Crazy Terkos!

825
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:40,898
<i>How did the angel sleep?</i>

826
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:54,495
Okay, Ulises.

827
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:57,415
You can eat something if you want.
Take a loaf of bread.

828
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,543
-Can I use the bathroom?
-Go ahead.

829
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:08,968
It's okay, boy. You're going to be fine,Â 

830
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:11,888
but please don't come looking for me
at work again.Â Or here.

831
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:17,518
And no steps back,
not even to gain momentum.

832
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:19,395
Thanks.

833
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,474
Who is it?

834
01:29:57,433 --> 01:29:58,726
Who is it?

835
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:01,187
No one.

836
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:11,294
<i>Good morning, Monterrey!</i>

837
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:13,963
<i>What a beautiful morning,Â </i>
<i>a morning for cumbia,</i>

838
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:18,092
<i>get the sleep out of your eyes</i>
<i>and smile at life.</i>

839
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:22,388
<i>Let's see who we have here.</i>
<i>Let's start with the early shout-outs.</i>

840
01:33:22,471 --> 01:33:25,599
For Asa, Jahir, and Crazy,
from the Dynasty.

841
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:28,185
For my buddy, Clever from Zapata,

842
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:31,480
he's always around El Encanto
every Wednesday and Sunday.

843
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:32,982
<i>We also have one forÂ Chuchis...</i>

844
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:33,899
Okay, Mom.

845
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:36,527
<i>...Pilokus and the people</i>
<i>from the Crazies. For Pekis...</i>

846
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:45,911
Sir, before we get to the mall,
can we stop at Bed Bath & Beyond?

847
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,413
No!

848
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:49,665
We're not asking you.
We're going, that's it.

849
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,751
We have to get some Tupperware.

850
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:53,919
Come on, Mom. The sale starts today,

851
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:55,880
by the time we get there,
there'll be nothing left.

852
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:57,882
<i>And to the Dragon Crew,</i>

853
01:33:57,965 --> 01:34:00,426
And for those from the 7th
of November too.

854
01:34:00,509 --> 01:34:03,638
We also have a shout-out
from the Terkos Lokos,

855
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:05,848
they're saying,Â 
"Good trip, you know who."

856
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:08,601
Good luck, this shout-out
is especially for you.

857
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:12,521
Your people showed up
with a large sign just for you,

858
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:16,108
to say goodbye to you
and wish you all the luck.

859
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:21,322
<i>Here's some music for you.</i>
<i>We hope you like it.</i>

860
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:22,657
<i>Let's go!</i>

861
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:59,193
<i>Tomorrow very early</i>

862
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:02,780
<i>I told you sweetheart</i>
<i>Your lover will travel</i>

863
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,409
<i>You kept crying</i>

864
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:10,037
<i>Because you can't come with me</i>

865
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:15,167
<i>But I'll keep you in my heart</i>

866
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,754
<i>I'll keep you in my heart</i>

867
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:23,259
<i>I'll keep you in my song</i>

868
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:26,512
<i>If you can't come</i>

869
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:29,849
<i>I'll keep you in my heart</i>

870
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:33,269
<i>I'll keep you in my heart</i>

871
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:36,647
<i>I'll keep you here in my song</i>

872
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:14,810
Be smart about this. It's a long process.

873
01:36:15,769 --> 01:36:17,563
And here, for some reason,

874
01:36:17,646 --> 01:36:19,482
it's better if they take a long time.

875
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:22,109
You know there's no coming back.

876
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:26,739
If you come back and are arrested

877
01:36:26,822 --> 01:36:28,699
you'll go straight to jail. You know that?

878
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,242
I won't come back.

879
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:47,760
MONTHS LATER

880
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:45,067
<i>Part of the tragedy</i>
<i>that we live as Mexicans</i>

881
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:46,360
<i>is due to the fact</i>

882
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:49,822
<i>that we're located at the border</i>
<i>of the largest drug consumer in the world</i>

883
01:37:49,905 --> 01:37:52,074
<i>and also the largest gun exporter.</i>

884
01:37:52,157 --> 01:37:56,120
<i>They pay billions and billions</i>
<i>of dollars every year</i> <i>to criminals</i>

885
01:37:56,203 --> 01:38:00,165
<i>to provide them</i>
<i>with large quantities of drugs.</i>

886
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:05,254
<i>I've given instructions to reinforce</i>
<i>the presence of the military</i>

887
01:38:05,337 --> 01:38:09,633
<i>in the metropolitan area of Monterrey,</i>
<i>at the northeast part of the country.</i>

888
01:38:09,758 --> 01:38:10,801
<i>Thank you.</i>

889
01:38:12,761 --> 01:38:13,762
<i>The Federal Government.</i>

890
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:16,974
Good morning, people.
A beautiful morning, a morning for cumbia.

891
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:19,268
Let's start right away with a song

892
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:22,771
here at Radio 13, the best for vallenata.

893
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:51,759
<i>How I miss my lovelyÂ savanna</i>

894
01:38:51,842 --> 01:38:54,386
<i>Stuck at the mountain range</i>

895
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,515
<i>Waiting for the time</i>

896
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:01,352
<i>To go back to my homeland</i>

897
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:05,564
<i>To the Pubenza valley I went</i>

898
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:08,901
<i>From all the longing</i>

899
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:12,237
<i>A cumbia blossomed out of my chest</i>

900
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:14,156
Hey, listen, friends! For real!

901
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:18,077
This is not the place to cry.
That man always kept moving on.

902
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:21,205
We also have to move on,
right, my friends?

903
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:26,377
Right? All the friends of IsaÃ­
know what the deal is.

904
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,338
A round of applause for IsaÃ­, shit!

905
01:39:32,883 --> 01:39:34,885
What's up, Chucky?
Play us a song, come on!

906
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:03,831
<i>At three o'clock</i>
<i>I couldn't control my anxiety anymore</i>

907
01:40:03,914 --> 01:40:06,667
<i>By the time I realized</i>
<i>I had to steal to get it</i>

908
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,461
<i>I disappointed everyone</i>
<i>I'd burn the bridges myself</i>

909
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:12,131
<i>My will to move up in the world</i>
<i>Was already dead</i>

910
01:40:12,214 --> 01:40:15,009
<i>I gave my back to God</i>
<i>Because I couldn't find answers</i>

911
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:17,469
<i>But of course, from the bad</i> <i>side</i>
<i>I did have offers</i>

912
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:20,097
<i>It would also say</i>
<i>That it had always been with me</i>

913
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:22,766
<i>That He was always a witness</i>
<i>To all our actions</i>

914
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,227
<i>That if what I want is peace</i>
<i>I could find it in Him</i>

915
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:27,980
<i>That's when I realized</i>
<i>I needed Him as a friend</i>

916
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:32,359
Brother! Look at you, Jeremy!

917
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,529
I know, bro,
but what was I supposed to do?

918
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:38,198
Things are bad here.
The Lord called me, so...

919
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,617
This is something I'll never regret.

920
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:43,996
Whenever you want, this is your home,
you're welcome.

921
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:46,582
No, that's okay. I'm cool.

922
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:55,549
-Are you going to show the money or what?
-I'd do it for free even!

923
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:59,428
-Fucking stop, to hell with it.
-Fuck yes, dude.

924
01:40:59,511 --> 01:41:01,930
It's cool, to hell with it.

925
01:41:43,472 --> 01:41:46,600
<i>People stay quiet because they're afraid.</i>

926
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:49,478
<i>They're the victims because</i>
<i>they just go into anyone's home, right?</i>

927
01:41:49,561 --> 01:41:52,022
<i>Soldiers are mean, they go</i>
<i>in your home, steal your property.</i>

928
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:55,901
<i>-When are they going to leave?</i>
<i>-When these bastards go back.</i>

929
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:35,691
<i>I want to tell you today</i>

930
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:39,570
<i>That I no longer love you</i>

931
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:42,322
<i>That I no longer miss you</i>

932
01:42:44,324 --> 01:42:47,202
