1
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,460
Did You Talk To Anyone?
Look At Me. Talk To Anybody?

2
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,260
Did You See Anybody?
Did You Talk To Anybody, Huh?

3
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,590
Did You Make A Phone Call?

4
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:43,850
Who Did You Talk To?

5
00:01:57,5275 --> 00:01:59,570
You Got Anything Else To Say?

6
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,740
I Didn't Think So.

7
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,870
- How Long Was He Out Of Your Sight?
- Maybe A Couple Of Minutes.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,710
<I>Chico, I'm Disappointed In You!
How Could You Do That?</I>

9
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:16,920
We Can't Go Into That Meeting.
If Anyone Was Ever Made, We Were Made.

10
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:19,633
You Know What I Say? We're Goin'.

11
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:25,180
What Are You? Are You Crazy? Probably
A Hundred People Saw Us Chasing Him.

12
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:31,019
Chico, Since When Did Anybody
Ever Accuse Me Of Being Sane?

13
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:35,065
- We're Goin'. All Right? Come On.
- Jesus Christ!

14
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:43,925
- You See Anything Strange?
- Just The Usual Weirdness.

15
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:51,308
The Deal's Goin' Down, Man.

16
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:56,521
- Keep An Eye Out For Me, Huh?
- Right, Hatcher.

17
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:01,735
- Are You Sure It's Cool?
- It's Very Cool. Relax.

18
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,821
<I>- Good. Then Iet's Go.
- Bueno.</I>

19
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:08,783
And The Next Time, You're Gonna
Introduce Me To Salazar, Aren't You?

20
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,912
Yes, I Promise. You Got It.

21
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,668
<I>No Traigo Dinero. No Tengo Dinero.</I>

22
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:21,463
<I>No Tengo Dinero. No Traigo.</I>

23
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:27,636
<I>Bien. Bien, Primo.</I>

24
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,765
Here We Are, Gentlemen. Right On Time.

25
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,644
You See, I Told You.
This Guy, He's Been A Good Customer.

26
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:41,399
- Did You Bring The Green?
- Of Course. I Got It Right Here.

27
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,572
Half.

28
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:50,367
- Then What Are You Here For?
- To Do Business.

29
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:53,161
If You Don't Like That, Then I'll Take Off.

30
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:56,498
<I>Cįlmate. Cįlmate, Primo.</I>

31
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:59,668
You Know Somethin'?
I Do Business For A Long Time.

32
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:03,755
You Know Why? Cos I'm Careful.
You Can Never Be Too Careful, Right?

33
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:07,884
<I>Careful Is Good With Me, Amigo.
Careful Never Killed Nobody.</I>

34
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:10,804
- Is That Right?
- Stupid.

35
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:14,766
<I>Stupid Kills. Me Entiendes?
Ok, Gringo. I Think We Can Do Business.</I>

36
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:17,269
Good. Then Let's Get It Over With.

37
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:20,021
Hey. How Ya Doin'?

38
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,869
Hey, Colonel!

39
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,638
You Know, In Our Country... We Love Cops.

40
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:58,393
And When We Do A Cop,
It's Like A Tremendous Status Symbol.

41
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:03,565
<I>But An American Cop Is Like A Gift From God.</I>

42
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,526
My Little Friend
Is Gonna Open You Up A Little Bit

43
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:10,572
So You Can Tell Us Where
The Rest Of The Money Is, Huh?

44
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:14,576
- There Is No More Money.
- There's Gotta Be More Money.

45
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:29,799
Hatcher, Let's Get The Hell
Outta Here! Come On!

46
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:33,720
Cover Me!

47
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,806
- It's Clear!
- Let's Go!

48
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:37,766
Ok!

49
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:57,744
<I>Por Favor, No Mįs.</I>

50
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,138
Hatch!

51
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,269
Time To Go, Hatch.

52
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,388
I Knew The Only Justice I Could Get

53
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:02,767
Would Be That That I Made For Myself -
Not Always By Iaw.

54
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:07,105
Father... I Just Killed A Woman.

55
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,361
I've Lied, I've Slept With Informants,

56
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:17,199
I've Taken Drugs, I've Falsified Evidence.

57
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:20,911
I Did Whatever I Had To Do To Get The Bad Guys.

58
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,832
And Then I Realised Somethin'.

59
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:30,879
That I Had Become What I Most Despise.

60
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,550
- Do You Have A Family?
- Yes, Father.

61
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:39,137
Go To Them And Leave These Things.

62
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:44,518
<I>Try To Find The Gentle Self Inside You.
Allow This Person To Come Back.</I>

63
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:54,653
<I>Well, What Are You
Going To Retire To, Hatcher?</I>

64
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:57,614
<I>You're Up To Your Neck In This Life.</I>

65
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:02,661
I Got Bennett Burning Up
The Phone Lines Every Day.

66
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:07,249
I Got The President Going On Television -
Promising Results, For Christ's Sake.

67
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,460
This Is Not The Time For You
To Walk Out On Me. Not Now.

68
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,255
- You Can't!
- I've Had Enough.

69
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:18,510
Look, John...

70
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,473
There Was Nothing
You Could Have Done To Save Chico.

71
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:27,978
These Things Happen When You're In Deep.
You Know That. Take A Leave.

72
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,938
With Pay.

73
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:34,234
Hell, Take A Month. Take Two.
You've Felt Burned Out Before This.

74
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,945
I Need You, John, Ok?

75
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:44,119
Pete, Nothin' We Ever Did
Amounted To Shit, And You Know It.

76
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:41,134
- Who Is It?
- Uncle John.

77
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,433
You're Not My Uncle.
My Uncle John Lives Far Away.

78
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:52,270
<I>I Am Your Uncle.
And You've Grown Up To Be A Big Girl.</I>

79
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:56,191
You Allergic To Cats?

80
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:58,735
- Nope.
- Ok. Then You Can Come In.

81
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,321
Tracey, Come On Back...

82
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:03,657
Johnny?

83
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:07,661
- Johnny! I Can't Believe It.
- How's My Little Sister?

84
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,254
- Boys, Say Hello To Your Uncle John.
- Who's This?

85
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,382
- This Is Ricky.
- Ricky, How Ya Doin'? You Look Great.

86
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:25,262
- You Look Good. Everything's All Right?
- Yeah. Everything's Great.

87
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:28,431
- Hey, How You Doin'?
- All Right. Welcome Home.

88
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:32,227
- Where You Been?
- I've Been Here Waitin' For You.

89
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:38,441
You're Home!

90
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:44,072
Let Me Look At You. Oh, You Look Great.

91
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:47,701
<I>You Look Great.
You Look Like Melissa Now. 20 Years Younger.</I>

92
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:53,165
Thank You. I Accept All Compliments
From Handsome Men. Everything All Right?

93
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:57,335
- You Sounded Strange On The Phone.
- It's All Right. I'm Just A Little Tired.

94
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,046
You've Come To The Right Place To Rest.

95
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:05,172
Head Up!

96
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,812

<I>We Have Lots More
Where Dat Come From, Yuh Know.</I>

98
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:27,527
Don't Worry About It. Be 'Appy!

99
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,780
- Ready?
- Break!

100
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:37,579
Let's Go! Let's Go!

101
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:41,124
Come Up To The Play!

102
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:44,628
Play It Again! One More Time!
Harris, You're A Failure!

103
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:49,132
Tackling 10 Yards Down The Field Ain't Shit!
Pardon My French. Get Back In The Huddle!

104
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:52,928
- Come On! Let's Go!
- Coach! Coach, Put Me In!

105
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:56,306
Put Me In.

106
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:59,684
I'll Be Damned.

107
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,979
- Trouble.
- That's Me.

108
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:10,820
<I>- I Heard You Were Shot Dead In Bangkok.
- Well, I Was In Bangkok. I Was There.</I>

109
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:14,199
But I Didn't Get Shot,
If That's All Right With You.

110
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:16,368
Hell, Yeah!

111
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:24,417
- Coach, We're Ready!
- Be Right Back. Show Him You Can Play Ball!

112
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:28,421
You Know, If You Like Dat,
You Shoulda Try Some O' Dis Ting Right Here.

113
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:32,217
Send You Right To Heaven.
Make Cloud Nine Look Sof'.

114
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:35,887
- Is That Crack?
- Dat It Is, Man. You Know, The Real Deal.

115
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:38,932
- The Shit You Hear About On De News.
- It's Funny

116
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:43,562
How De Man Always Tell Lie About
Certain Tings What Make Us 'Appy.

117
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:47,107
But You Don't Waan' Try Dis. It Too Tough.

118
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:50,277

120
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:55,907
Go On. Put It Right Up To Your Lips. You Ready?

121
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:59,536
- Break!
- Four Laps, Then Hit The Showers!

122
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,790
You Were Gone So Long
You Missed My Marriage.

123
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:06,793
- How Was It?
- Cambodia Was More Fun.

124
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:10,130
I Love Giving Away My Possessions!
It Makes Me Feel Spiritual.

125
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:12,382
- And Probably Poor.
- And Poor.

126
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,191
It's All Right. Let's Go.

127
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:33,987
Get In The Car. Get In The Car.
Get In The Car. Get In The Car.

128
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:27,707
Tito Barco, We're Glad You Come
To Show Some Respect.

129
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:31,044
Walk Up.

130
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:37,425
- Check Him Clean.
- Cool.

131
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:40,011
Do Your Best, Man.

132
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:45,016
<I>Deja.</I>

133
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:51,690
You Very Funny, Man.

134
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:57,529
Wait 'Ere For De Man.

135
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,548
Forward.

136
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,475
<I>You Move Into My Territory.
What Do You Think I'm Going To Do?</I>

137
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:30,812
The Streets Will Be Red With Blood,
And Nobody Makes Money.

138
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:35,650
They Don't Even Notice Us.
We Fit In. We Look Like Them.

139
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:42,657
But You... You Go Marching Into The Suburbs
With Your Rag-Head Soldiers,

140
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,202
<I>And We're Front-Page News.</I>

141
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:49,789
<I>The Dea Will Be Crawling Down Our Throats
Long After You've Gone!</I>

142
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:52,876
Everybody Waan' Go Heaven,

143
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:56,546
But Nobody Want Dead.

144
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,634
Afraid?

145
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,276
Dis Is How It A Go.

146
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:22,155

149
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:33,375
I Supply The Crack And The Powder.

150
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:37,879
- What's The Split?
- 20 Per Cent

151
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:40,298
To You.

152
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:50,767
Give Me Some Time
To Consider Your Proposition.

153
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:54,729
I Will Give You An Answer Very Soon.

154
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:58,066
I'll Wait

155
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:00,110
And Watch.

156
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:03,321
I'll See Everything.

157
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:08,201
I'll Be Everywhere.

158
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:24,593
<I>The Santero Told Me That You Are The One
With The Most Frightening Power,</I>

159
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:27,304
That You Are The One I Must See.

160
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:41,860
<I>This Man Is Not Only Abakua -
The Leopard People -</I>

161
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:44,029
<I>..Pero También Es Maijumbero.</I>

162
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,115
<I>Muy Malo.</I>

163
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,911
This Man Is Using The Power Of The Spirits

164
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:53,497
To Do Very Evil Things.

165
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:57,918
Will You... Will You Help Me?

166
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,672
 Aquk'es El Derecho.

167
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:12,390
I Hope To See You Again.

168
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,227
<I>Adiós.</I>

169
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:50,470
<I>Ven, Gallito. Tranquilo.</I>

170
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:53,265
<I>Te Necesito Para Mi Trabajo.</I>

171
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:55,392
<I>Ven, Gallito.</I>

172
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:38,476
<I>Acepta La Sangre De Este Gallo Que Te Ofrezco</I>

173
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:43,064
<I>Y Ayśdame A Deshacerme
De Este Hombre Malo.</I>

174
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:52,324
<I>Gallo, Te Mato Por Tu Sangre.</I>

175
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:28,902
- Looks Good.
- Mm-Hm.

176
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:31,947
Nice To Be Back. Your Team Looks Great.

177
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:37,702
Well, It Looks Good Now. Last Year
One Of My Best Players Od'd On Cocaine.

178
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:42,332
I Remember When The Worst Problem To Worry
About Was One Of Them Knockin' Up Some Girl.

179
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:45,335
- Not Any More.
- I Think I Remember This Place.

180
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,297
Wasn't This The Place
Where All The Ugly Girls Worked?

181
00:23:56,721 --> 00:24:01,226
- Hey, Nurse! Got An Emergency Here!
- Call A Doctor!

182
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:04,729
Listen, Give Me A Beer,
And Give My Man Here A Double.

183
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:09,317
- I Don't Do Doubles On The First Date.
- Now, That's Not What I Heard!

184
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,572
- This Is My Boy Hatch.
- Hi, Hatch.

185
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,621
<I>- Tiene Miedo?
- No.</I>

186
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,791
<I>Bien. Yo Tampoco.</I>

187
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:30,338
<I>- We're Goin'in.
- Ok.</I>

188
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:50,025
- Some Hormones In Here.
- Oh, Yeah.

189
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:04,039
Looks Like One Of The Locals Is Doin'
Some Dealing. Supplementin' His Income.

190
00:25:04,164 --> 00:25:09,085
- Leave It Alone, Man. Leave It Alone.
- He's Buyin' Dope From The Jamaicans

191
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:12,923
- And Sellin' It To His Friends.
- I've Been All Over The World With This.

192
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:17,552
- It Ain'tjust The Jamaicans. It's Everybody.
- That's The Same Guy I Saw By The School.

193
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:21,765
And Every Time I See Somethin' Goin' Down,
I See Him. There He Is.

194
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:36,947
Last Month, My 13-Year-Old Nephew Died

195
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:40,784
In A Crack House Run By These Guys.
That Cut It For Me.

196
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:43,161
- I'm Sorry.
- Look, I've Had It!

197
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:47,165
And Now It Seems
They're Movin' In Down Here.

198
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,752
- I'm Just Waitin' To Do Somethin'.
- Let Me Tell You Somethin'.

199
00:25:50,877 --> 00:25:55,549
There's Nothin' You Can Do About It
And There Never Was, All Right?

200
00:25:56,216 --> 00:26:01,179
But You Gotta Try To Protect Your Own, Or
Are You So Burnt Out You Can't Relate To That?

201
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:03,181
No. I Can Relate To That.

202
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:15,777
Excuse Me.

203
00:26:32,586 --> 00:26:34,754
Blood And Fire!

204
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:47,601
Go!

205
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:55,525
Move Out! Move Out!

206
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:59,696
Come On! Call An Ambulance!

207
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:10,999
Hey, Bwoy! Somebody About Dead Tonight!

208
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:13,043
Raas, What Do You...?

209
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:17,631
Me No Know You, But I Promise You
You Is A Dead Man Walkin'!

210
00:27:17,756 --> 00:27:19,758
So What Else Is New?

211
00:27:34,356 --> 00:27:37,150
Give Us Some Room Here! Come On, Let's Go.

212
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,906
Let's Clear The Area. Clear That Area.

213
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,875
You're Dead, Bwoy! Yuh Hear? Dead!

214
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:57,712
- Welcome Home.
- Is That The Suspect, Mr Hatcher?

215
00:27:57,838 --> 00:28:00,257
Yeah, The First Guy Up There.

216
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:04,094
All Right. Watch It, People.
Stay Back Behind The Line.

217
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:07,055
Like Los Angeles,
New York, And Washington,

218
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,308
Small-Town America
Now Has Blood In Its Streets,

219
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:14,688
As A Gang Shoot-Out In Lincoln Heights
Tonight Has Left Four Dead.

220
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:18,608
Although Less Than One Per Cent
Of Jamaican Immigrants Are Involved,

221
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:23,488
Jamaican Gangs, Known As Posses, Are
Now Dominating The American Drug Trade,

222
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:27,742
With More Than 10,000 Members
Trafficking Drugs In 20 States.

223
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:33,290
According To Justice Department Officials,
They Are As Disciplined As They Are Violent.

224
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:35,959
Torture And Maiming Are Posse Trademarks,

225
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:40,255
And Posse Gunmen Are Said To Prefer
Shooting Their Victims In Public.

226
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,427
Sources Estimate They Have Committed
1400 Murders In Three And A Half Years.

227
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:49,181
Dale Harimoto, Wxtv, Chicago.

228
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:51,850
- Stay Back. Watch It.
- Sheriff O'dwyer.

229
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:59,316
- I'm Sheriff O'dwyer. Who Might You Be?
- Roselli. Fbl, Oc Task Force.

230
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:01,902
- We're Taking Over Here.
- By What Authority?

231
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:05,197
United States Government Code,
Title 18, Section 111.

232
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:09,701
Go Get Their Statements.
Keep The Looky-Loos Out Of The Crime Scene.

233
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:13,121
- You're Excused, Sheriff.
- Roselli, I Won't Forget This.

234
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:18,919
You And Your Agents So Much As Spit On
The Deck, And I'll Personally Write The Citation.

235
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:24,549
Hatcher! Jesus Christ!
What The Hell Are You Doin' Back Here?

236
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:29,012
Thought I'd Visit My Mother, You Know?
I'm Retired Now.

237
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:32,349
Retired, Huh? Well, That's Cosy.
What The Hell Went Down?

238
00:29:32,474 --> 00:29:36,394
Gee, I Don't Know. What Does It Look Like?
It's A Shoot-Out... Colombians...

239
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,523
- What Do You Want Me To Say?
- Probably Tito Barco's Clan.

240
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:45,445
- What Would Tito Barco Be Doing Up This Far?
- Losing. The Turf Is Spreading Out, Hatcher.

241
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:50,242
The Jamaican Posse's More Organised Than
The Others. They Got More Guns, More Balls.

242
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,744
Jimmy Fingers Is Giving Them Everything.

243
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:56,331
Jimmy Fingers...
Ex-Casino Man Out Of Atlantic City.

244
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:59,417
That's A Piece Of Cake.
You Pop Him, You Got It.

245
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:02,796
- Why Don't You Help Us Out On This One?
- Cos I'm Out.

246
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:07,676
- Come On, Hatcher. It's In The Blood.
- If It's In The Blood, I'll Get A Transfusion.

247
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:12,764
Lieutenant, May I See Yuh For A Moment? The
Professor Has Found Something Interesting.

248
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:16,685
- Charles, How Ya Doin'?
- We'll See You Around, Hatcher.

249
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,313
<I>- The Sign On De Wall Is Abakua.
- More Of This Voodoo Bullshit?</I>

250
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:23,650
Professor, You Call The Markings
On De Wall Voodoo Bullshit?

251
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:27,529
Nope. I've Seen Them In New York,
Los Angeles And Now Here.

252
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:33,243
Sal, Dis Is No Bullshit, Man. Those Markings
Were Put Dere By A Man Named Screwface.

253
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:36,079
Know What It Means
When We Say A Man's Face Is Screwed?

254
00:30:36,204 --> 00:30:40,125
- No.
- Well, I Pray You Never Have To Find That Out.

255
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,460
Who's That?

256
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:47,382
It's John Hatcher. He Was An Undercover
Troubleshooter For The Dea.

257
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:51,720
- We Worked Together A Couple Of Years Ago.
- I Know Him. Him Comin' In Wid Us?

258
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:54,014
No. He Thinks He's Retired.

259
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:57,017
He Still Looks Functional To Me.

260
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:24,503
I Have A Message For You

261
00:31:25,128 --> 00:31:27,130
From Tito!

262
00:31:27,464 --> 00:31:30,967
Him Say Meet Him In Hell!

263
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:23,144
- Dem Let You Out?
- No Jail Can Hold Me

264
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,231
- When Jimmy Fingers Is On My Side.
- Same.

265
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:29,025
Jimmy Fingers.

266
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:33,071
Give T'anks For
Bringin' Out My Bredren. Same?

267
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:37,784
Bondsman Knew He Was Gonna Skip,
So I Figured I'd Throw Him A Little Extra.

268
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:41,413
- Monkey, Time For Business.
- Let's Take Care O' Dis.

269
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:43,582
Come.

270
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:09,024
No, Man. I Just Think
You Have To Take It One Step At A Time.

271
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:18,408
Nobody. Yuh Know What I'm Sayin'?

272
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:21,036

And The Magic Be Everywhere.

278
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:38,929
The Warriors... Conquerors!

279
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:43,517
Respec'. The Almighty
Has Given I'll His Hand.

280
00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:45,852
His Rod Of Correction I Hold.

281
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:52,567
Let No Man Here Fear For His Own Life!

282
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:57,739
Dem Dat Wish I'll

Will Demselves Be Damned!

284
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,748
If A Man Commit A Crime Against You,

285
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:12,963
He Must Be Paid Back A T'ousand Times!

286
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:18,426
Who You Fear?

287
00:34:19,427 --> 00:34:23,181
Him... Or Me?

288
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:36,236
Let No Man Here Steer
From De Path L 'Ave Prepared!

289
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:45,120
Dem De Streets Out Dere

00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:51,668

Take It!

00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:59,217
- Come.
- Yes.

294
00:35:04,764 --> 00:35:09,394
I Still Don't Believe You. If You Don't See
The Shit That's Happening Around Us,

295
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,814
- You're Blind Or You Don't Wanna See.
- Maybe I've Seen Enough.

296
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:17,444
<I>- I Don't Think The World Wants To Change.
- Look, Things Do Change, Man.</I>

297
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:22,240
It's Like You See This Big Dam With A Leak
In It. You Plug It With Your Finger.

298
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:27,370
Soon You See More Holes. You Plug It With
Your Other Fingers, Your Toes, Your Tongue.

299
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:30,540
But The Water Keeps On Gushing Out.
That's The Way It Is.

300
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:32,918
Pretty Soon, You Quit Or Get Killed.

301
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:36,796
Five Days Later, They Got
Some Shitbird Cherry To Take Your Place,

302
00:35:36,922 --> 00:35:39,591
They Give Him Your Shield,
And You're Forgotten.

303
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:43,929
The Way I Look At It, You Come Home, Mind
Your Own Business, Watch Your Own Yard.

304
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:48,141
And Then, If Trouble Finds You,
You Go After It And You Bite Its Head Off

305
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:50,852
Before It Does The Same Thing To You.

306
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:54,898
Look, Hatch,
You Haven't Been Here In A Long Time,

307
00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:59,611
And I'm Telling You, Trouble Is Tapping Us
Both On The Shoulder Right Now,

308
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:04,324
- And You Don't Want To Turn Around.
- Well, I Hope You're Wrong.

309
00:36:07,285 --> 00:36:11,373
- You Look A Little Winded There, Big Guy.
- Gimme A Break. I'm On Vacation.

310
00:36:11,498 --> 00:36:13,458
Tracey Has Something To Show You.
She's Been Waiting.

311
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:39,860
Get Down!

312
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,711
Johnny!

313
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:02,507
They Hurt My Baby!

314
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:22,986
Tracey Is In Serious Condition,
And She's Unstable.

315
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:26,907
There's Pressure On The Brain
That We'll Have To Relieve.

316
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:31,453
- Well, What Does That Mean?
- Surgery. I Can't Give You A Prognosis.

317
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:34,873
She's Fighting For Her Life, And So Are We.

318
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:44,174
Doc, You Treat This Girl Like She's
The President Of The United States.

319
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:48,261
- Money Isn't A Consideration.
- We Treat All Of Our Patients Exactly...

320
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:53,141
Let Me Tell You Somethin'.
Like The President Of The United States, Ok?

321
00:37:57,437 --> 00:38:00,398
Don't Touch Me, John. Don't Touch Me.

322
00:38:00,524 --> 00:38:04,778
This Is Your Fault.
Do You Understand? This Is Your Fault.

323
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:08,156
God Damn You! God Damn You!

324
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:11,743
This Is Your Fault! And My Baby...

325
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:13,912
My Baby...

326
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:35,619
- Jimmy, How Ya Doin'?
- Hatch, What The Fuck Are You Doin' Here?

327
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:40,248
Why Don't You Guys Take A Hike?
Go Find Another Trick, All Right?

328
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:46,004
You Bailed Out A Jamaican, Street Name
Monkey, The Other Day. I Want Him.

329
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:49,341
This Other Piece Of Shit - Screwface -
I Want Him.

330
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:52,135
You're A Scumbag And A Puke.
I Don't Mind That.

331
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,639
Gimme What I Need, I Leave Here A Nice Guy.
You Don't, I Fuck You Up.

332
00:39:55,764 --> 00:39:58,475
You Fuckin' Know Better Than That, Hatcher.

333
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:05,190
Come Here. I Just Wanna Talk To You
For A Minute. Come Here.

334
00:40:06,483 --> 00:40:10,320
The Mob Throws You Out Of Atlantic City.
Now You Sell Guns To The Jamaicans.

335
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:15,283
Fuckin' Sell Anything To Anybody, Except You.
Wouldn't Sell You The Sweat Off My Balls!

336
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:17,160
- Is That Right?
- Yeah.

337
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:22,249
Watch It!

338
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,174
- You're A Fuckin' Dead Man, Hatcher!
- Yeah?

339
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:34,719
I'm Fuckin' Jimmy Fingers!
I'm A Made Fuckin' Man!

340
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:42,227
God Made Men.

341
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:48,316
I Wanna Know Where Screwface Is.

342
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:52,612
- Screwface? Me Don't Know No Screwface.
- Really?

343
00:40:52,737 --> 00:40:54,197
Hm. That's Strange.

344
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:58,952
- Does That Remind You?
- Just Shoot Me Now, Man!

345
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:01,746
I Got A Better Idea. We're Gonna Go For A Ride.

346
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:07,836
Everybody's Gonna See Us, And Screwface
Is Gonna Find Out What Good Buddies We Are.

347
00:41:08,753 --> 00:41:10,463
Come On.

348
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:16,678
- Let's Go! Let's Go!
- All Right, Man! All Right!

349
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:21,892
Just Easy. I Will Take You.

350
00:41:22,017 --> 00:41:24,769

353
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:00,847
Well?

354
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:04,935
One Thought He Was Invincible.
The Other Thought He Could Fly.

355
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,687
- So?
- They Were Both Wrong.

356
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:21,660
I Wanna Know The Second
That Call Comes In, Ok?

357
00:42:21,743 --> 00:42:22,869
So?

358
00:42:22,994 --> 00:42:27,833
Two Dead. Dis One Was Shot In De Forehead.
De Other One Was Forced Out De Window.

359
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:30,001
Did You Find The Hookers?

360
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:33,171
<I>Do You Honestly Believe
Now Is The Time For Findin' Them?</I>

361
00:42:33,255 --> 00:42:35,632
- This Job Was Done By A Pro.
- Is That Right?

362
00:42:35,757 --> 00:42:40,262
That's Right, And I'll Bet My Money
It Was John Hatcher. Find Me Somethin'.

363
00:42:40,387 --> 00:42:44,516
- Sal, I Will Find You Somethin'.
- He Thinks He Can Do Things His Own Way,

364
00:42:44,641 --> 00:42:47,853
But I'll Tell You Something - He Can't.

365
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:51,314
Stay Close To Home, Charles.

366
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:54,818
Do It, Man. Do It.

367
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:15,422
Where Nesta?

368
00:43:20,927 --> 00:43:25,056
Jimmy Fingers And Nesta Are Not Too Good.

369
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:28,643
Nesta Dead? Who Do It?
De White Boy Hatcher?

370
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:49,039
I Want... Hatcher Dead!

371
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:53,502
I Want His Family Dead!

372
00:43:55,462 --> 00:43:58,381
And If You Cannot Kill Him,

00:43:58,507 --> 00:44:01,301
I Go Kill Him!

374
00:44:01,384 --> 00:44:03,887
And Then I Go Kill You.

375
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:58,525
- What About Protection For My Family?
- They're Assigned.

376
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,070
<I>- Good.
- I Should Probably Have Them Tailing You.</I>

377
00:45:03,154 --> 00:45:06,491
- What's That Supposed To Mean?
- Where Were You Last Night?

378
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:08,660
With A Friend.

379
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:11,913
Stay Retired.

380
00:45:37,772 --> 00:45:39,816
Hello?

381
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:46,698
Hi. I'm John Hatcher.
I Saw You The Other Night.

382
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:51,328
- Yes. At The Shamrock.
- I Kind Of Need Some Help.

383
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,331
Hold On. I'll Be Right Down.

384
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,919
It's An African Black Magic Symbol.

385
00:45:59,044 --> 00:46:02,464
It Was Used By The Jamaican
Drug Gang The Other Night.

386
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:07,219
- The Fbl Said I'd Be Getting Photos Today.
- I'm Not With The Fbl, You Know.

387
00:46:09,137 --> 00:46:13,016
Well... The Cow's Tongue Means
You've Talked Or Exposed Them,

388
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:16,561
And Have Been Marked For Death.
Where Did You Get These?

389
00:46:16,728 --> 00:46:21,274
I Got These...
At My Family's House This Morning.

390
00:46:23,735 --> 00:46:26,404
What About This Black Cross?

391
00:46:26,488 --> 00:46:30,825
This May Seem Ridiculous To You,
Hatcher, But These People Are For Real.

392
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:33,411
Your Family Has Been Marked.

393
00:46:37,457 --> 00:46:41,211
- Could I Use Your Phone For A Minute?
- Yeah, Sure.

394
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:56,810
<I>- Hello?
- It's Me. Is Everything All Right?</I>

395
00:46:56,935 --> 00:47:01,064
Yeah, Johnny. I'm Fine.
I Just Got Back Here From The Hospital.

396
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:04,609
Mom's There With Tracey.
She's Better. She's Stable.

397
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:09,823
- I Just Had To Come Home And Get Some Rest.
- Go Look Out The Window. Is The Guard There?

398
00:47:09,948 --> 00:47:12,409
Um, Waitjust A Minute.

399
00:47:18,165 --> 00:47:21,585
Yeah. The Car's There,
But, Uh, I Don't See The Guard.

400
00:47:23,879 --> 00:47:25,672
Johnny?

401
00:47:26,673 --> 00:47:27,591
Johnny!

402
00:47:30,051 --> 00:47:32,095
My God.

403
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:48,904
Somebody Help Me!

404
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:54,367
<I>- What Do You Want?!
- I Want You.</I>

405
00:47:54,492 --> 00:47:58,788
What Do You Want? Just Leave Me Alone.
Somebody's Coming.

406
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:02,042
- You're Making A Big Mistake.
- You're Lying!

407
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:35,283
Stop The Blood Claat Cryin'.

408
00:48:35,408 --> 00:48:37,536
Everybody Must Dead!

409
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:40,163
No! No, No...

410
00:48:41,873 --> 00:48:43,500
It's Your Turn.

411
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:56,513
My Father...

412
00:48:58,056 --> 00:49:01,393
I'll Go Take You To A Place, You See.

413
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:05,564
Far, Far Away.

414
00:49:06,314 --> 00:49:08,984
You Never Been Dere Before.

415
00:49:12,487 --> 00:49:15,282
You A Go Dere Now.

416
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:24,499
It's Not Your Body Me Want, No.

417
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:27,669
It's Your Dreams.

418
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:38,513
No, You Bastard!

419
00:49:40,473 --> 00:49:42,517
I Own You Now.

420
00:49:43,185 --> 00:49:46,438
- No!
- Now I Have Power!

421
00:50:01,328 --> 00:50:05,123
Help Me! Help Me! Johnny, Help Me!

422
00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:20,222
He Said... He Said He'd Be Back.
He Said He'd Kill Us Both.

423
00:50:20,972 --> 00:50:24,851
Somehow, I Don't Think
He's Gonna Get The Chance.

424
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:55,382
I Can't Wait To Nail This Fucker.

425
00:50:55,507 --> 00:50:58,093
This Is Gonna Be Fun.

426
00:50:58,218 --> 00:51:00,262

427
00:51:44,764 --> 00:51:47,684

430
00:52:10,749 --> 00:52:16,213

431
00:52:16,338 --> 00:52:18,507

434
00:55:19,104 --> 00:55:23,066

435
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:29,781

00:56:39,017 --> 00:56:42,562
Raas, Didn't You See It?
Blood Claat, What Run For?

449
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:46,024
A One White Boy And Two Bredda Enough!

450
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:50,987
Let's Kick Dis Little Blood Claat.
Batty-Hole, Yuh See.

451
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,282
- I Ready A Ready.
- Get Him!

452
00:56:56,701 --> 00:56:58,745
Hold On. Hold On, Now.

453
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:11,508
Tear You, Rasta!

454
00:57:32,112 --> 00:57:34,656
You Fuck With My Family And You Die.

455
00:57:43,748 --> 00:57:48,170
- Now We're Talking Serious Fun, Man.
- Abso-Fucking-Lutely.

456
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:02,809
I've Never Met Anyone Quite Like You, Hatcher.

457
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:07,147
Go Down To Any Soup Kitchen,
You're Gonna Find A Lot Of Guys Just Like Me.

458
00:58:07,272 --> 00:58:10,901
- Why A Soup Kitchen?
- I'm Just Another Unemployed Guy.

459
00:58:11,026 --> 00:58:14,446
I Don't Think There Is A Lot Of Guys
Like You Anywhere.

460
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:17,282
What's That Supposed To Mean?

461
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:21,369
I've Met A Guy Who Is Nice, Not Married,
Gay, Or Trying To Find Himself,

462
00:58:21,495 --> 00:58:24,915
And He's Trying Very Hard
To Get Himself Killed.

463
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,502
Well, I Have Some
Unfinished Business, You Know,

464
00:58:28,627 --> 00:58:32,130
And I Was Hoping That You'd Maybe
Give Me Some Of Your Advice.

465
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:36,635
- What Are You Planning To Do?
- I'm Gonna Take Out The Posse.

466
00:58:39,471 --> 00:58:41,431
Then Destroy Their System.

467
00:58:41,556 --> 00:58:45,519
When Screwface Kills He Wants
Everyone To See He Did It, Or Ordered It.

468
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:48,730
That Way He's Both Feared And Worshipped.

469
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,944
You'd Have To Kill Him So The Posse
Thinks You've Taken His Power.

470
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:56,738
That Way They Will Believe
Your Magic Is Bigger.

471
00:58:56,863 --> 00:59:01,743
Otherwise They'll Never Stop
Until You And Your Family Are Dead.

472
01:00:44,596 --> 01:00:46,932
I Want You To Meet My Sister.

473
01:00:50,977 --> 01:00:53,313
Goddess Of Fire.

474
01:01:59,462 --> 01:02:03,717
This Is What You Ordered. Do You Want
Anything Else? Wires? Surveillance?

475
01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:07,012
- No. Just Firearms This Time.
- Ok. You Got It.

476
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:09,181
- For You.
- Thank You.

477
01:02:11,183 --> 01:02:15,687
- You Still Sober?
- Five Years, Man. One Day At A Time.

478
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:17,772
Stay Away From That Dope.

479
01:02:27,157 --> 01:02:29,201
Hang On. Hang On.

480
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:45,467
Max, Meet Charles. Charles, Meet Max.

481
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:55,435
Man, I Been After Screwface
For Five Long Years, Yuh See?

482
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,731
I Have Followed Him
From Kingston To Here. All Around.

483
01:02:59,856 --> 01:03:03,652
- You Break My Heart.
- Your Tactic Is Makin' Him Tougher To Snatch.

484
01:03:03,777 --> 01:03:06,238
Him Jump Already, Yuh Know?

485
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:13,119
An' It's Only I... Who Can Guide You
To What It Is Yuh Seek.

486
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:17,040
I Don't Know If That'd Be
A Wise Career Move For You.

487
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:21,753
Come On! Look Close!
Who You Think Me Work For? The Dea?

488
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:25,048
<I>I'm A Jamaican Cop, Man,
And Screwface Is My Career!</I>

489
01:03:25,423 --> 01:03:30,971
<I>Look, Man. I Don't Really Care Who You Work
For. You Got Your Reasons And I Got Mine.</I>

490
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:39,729
Screwface Has Gone Back To Jamaica.

491
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:48,321
You Know, Charles, Sometimes

492
01:03:48,446 --> 01:03:50,657
Three's Not A Crowd.

493
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:53,493
The Way I Look At It, We Need Each Other.

494
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:56,371
Know What I Mean?

495
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,007
Let's Do It, Man.

496
01:05:02,562 --> 01:05:05,023
How Ya Doin'? Care Package.

497
01:05:11,488 --> 01:05:13,949
Uncle Sam's Contribution?

498
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:17,202
Welfare For Warfare, Yuh Know?

499
01:05:39,224 --> 01:05:41,893
This Is My Silent Partner.

500
01:05:43,061 --> 01:05:46,231
A Whisper In The Ear
From This Girl Goes A Long Way.

501
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:05,542
You Didn't Hear A Thing.
You Heard The Slide Click A Little.

502
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:08,086
Massive Cool.

503
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:10,255
Forward, Jamaica.

504
01:07:05,018 --> 01:07:08,980
These Are The Streets Dat Breed
De Screwfaces O' De World.

505
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:13,527
This Is The First Time I Ever Got The Idea
It's Not All Sunshine And Bikinis.

506
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:18,823
I Owe You An Apology. Until Today I Thought
All Jamaicans Were Dope-Dealing Dreads.

507
01:07:18,949 --> 01:07:23,745
Don't Feel You Have To Apologise For Nothin'.
Man, These Streets Are Hard Out Here.

508
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:28,708
And Some People Make A Bad Choice,
Dat's All. They Say Life Is Hard.

509
01:08:13,753 --> 01:08:15,797
- What, Man?
- Nothin'.

510
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:20,677
What Are You Doin' All De Way Up Here?
Not Enough Trouble In Kingston, Beast-Boy?

511
01:08:20,969 --> 01:08:24,097
Back With Country, Boy. You Do Your Duty?

512
01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:27,767
Pay Him.

513
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:36,526
Dis Gal... She Hang
With Screwface More Time.

514
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:40,864
Dey Always Partying Together.
I Usually Find Her At De Cat Club.

515
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,662
Screwface?

516
01:10:12,497 --> 01:10:14,541
Road To Doom.

517
01:10:15,417 --> 01:10:19,796
- Sounds Like You Know This Guy Pretty Well.
- Yeah, I Know Him.

518
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:22,007
I Partied Wid Him.

519
01:10:22,132 --> 01:10:26,511
I Don't Care Him Sell The Drugs, Sir.
It's Part O' Doin' Business.

520
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:31,474
But My Sister, She Lost A Shipment
And Him Cut Her Dead.

521
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,479
And For Dat, Somehow,
Someday, Him A Go Dust Off.

522
01:10:37,022 --> 01:10:42,277
Why Don't You Just Tell Me What I Gotta Know,
And I'll Go Do What I Gotta Do?

523
01:10:45,614 --> 01:10:49,743
Screwface Have Two Head And Four Eyes,

524
01:10:49,868 --> 01:10:52,787
An' Dat Is De Secret To His Magic.

- ''Business Is Business, Man.''

544
01:21:27,422 --> 01:21:29,674
Ten Dollars.

01:21:29,799 --> 01:21:33,803
<I>- It Ain't Over Yet.

546
01:22:37,617 --> 01:22:39,995
