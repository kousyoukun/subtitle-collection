1
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,500

2
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,578
Did you talk to anyone?
Look at me. Talk to anybody?

3
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,209
Did you see anybody?
Did you talk to anybody, huh?

4
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,450
Did you make a phone call?

5
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,529
Who did you talk to?

6
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,611
You got anything else to say?

7
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,691
l didn't think so.

8
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,495
- How long was he out of your sight?
- Maybe a couple of minutes.

9
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,219
Chico, l'm disappointed in you!
How could you do that?

10
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,259
We can't go into that meeting.
lf anyone was ever made, we were made.

11
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,855
You know what l say? We're goin'.

12
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,172
What are you? Are you crazy? Probably
a hundred people saw us chasing him.

13
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,778
Chico, since when did anybody
ever accuse me of being sane?

14
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,648
- We're goin'. All right? Come on.
- Jesus Christ!

15
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,798
- You see anything strange?
- Just the usual weirdness.

16
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,869
The deal's goin' down, man.

17
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,878
- Keep an eye out for me, huh?
- Right, Hatcher.

18
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,873
- Are you sure it's cool?
- lt's very cool. Relax.

19
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,838
- Good. Then let's go.
- Bueno.

20
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,629
And the next time, you're gonna
introduce me to Salazar, aren't you?

21
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,632
Yes, l promise. You got it.

22
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,110
No traigo dinero. No tengo dinero.
No tengo dinero. No traigo.

23
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,717
Bien. Bien, primo.

24
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,670
Here we are, gentlemen. Right on time.

25
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,389
You see, l told you.
This guy, he's been a good customer.

26
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,910
- Did you bring the green?
- Of course. l got it right here.

27
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,832
Half.

28
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,514
- Then what are you here for?
- To do business.

29
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,194
lf you don't like that, then l'll take off.

30
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,396
Calmate. Calmate, primo.

31
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,439
You know somethin'?
l do business for a long time.

32
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,925
You know why?

33
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,354
Cos l'm careful.
You can never be too careful, right?

34
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,310
Careful is good with me, amigo.
Careful never killed nobody.

35
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,119
- ls that right?
- Stupid.

36
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,909
Stupid kills. :Me entiendes?
OK, gringo. l think we can do business.

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,309
Good. Then let's get it over with.

38
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,956
Hey. How ya doin'?

39
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,231
Hey, Colonel!

40
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,196
You know, in our country... we love cops.

41
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,753
And when we do a cop,
it's like a tremendous status symbol.

42
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,717
But an American cop is like a gift from God.

43
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,553
My little friend
is gonna open you up a little bit...

44
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,428
..so you can tell us where
the rest of the money is, huh?

45
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,274
- There is no more money.
- There's gotta be more money.

46
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,873
Hatcher, let's get the hell
outta here! Come on!

47
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,630
Cover me!

48
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,591
- lt's clear!
- Let's go!

49
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,510
OK!

50
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,171
Por favor, no mas.

51
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,768
Hatch!

52
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,691
Time to go, Hatch.

53
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,331
l knew the only justice l could get...

54
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,538
..would be that that l made for myself -
not always by law.

55
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,690
Father... l just killed a woman.

56
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,696
l've lied, l've slept with informants,...

57
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,375
..l've taken drugs, l've falsified evidence.

58
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,930
l did whatever l had to do to get the bad guys.

59
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,653
And then l realised somethin'.

60
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,498
That l had become what l most despise.

61
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,979
- Do you have a family?
- Yes, Father.

62
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,416
Go to them and leave these things.

63
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,574
Try to find the gentle self inside you.
Allow this person to come back.

64
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,289
Well, what are you
going to retire to, Hatcher?

65
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,133
You're up to your neck in this life.

66
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,973
l got Bennett burning up
the phone lines every day.

67
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,372
l got the president going on television -
promising results, for Christ's sake.

68
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,452
This is not the time for you
to walk out on me. Not now.

69
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,134
- You can't!
- l've had enough.

70
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,169
Look, John...

71
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,938
There was nothing
you could have done to save Chico.

72
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,252
These things happen when you're in deep.
You know that. Take a leave.

73
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,137
With pay.

74
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,259
Hell, take a month. Take two.
You've felt burned out before this.

75
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,854
l need you, John, OK?

76
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,738
Pete, nothin' we ever did
amounted to shit, and you know it.

77
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,912
- Who is it?
- Uncle John.

78
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,917
You're not my uncle.
My Uncle John lives far away.

79
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,597
l am your uncle.
And you've grown up to be a big girl.

80
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,356
You allergic to cats?

81
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,795
- Nope.
- OK. Then you can come in.

82
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,269
(woman) Tracey, come on back...

83
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,518
Johnny?

84
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,354
- Johnny! l can't believe it.
- How's my little sister?

85
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,556
- Boys, say hello to your Uncle John.
- Who's this?

86
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,552
- This is Ricky.
- Ricky, how ya doin'? You look great.

87
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,236
- You look good. Everything's all right?
- Yeah. Everything's great.

88
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,278
- Hey, how you doin'?
- All right. Welcome home.

89
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,909
- Where you been?
- l've been here waitin' for you.

90
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,868
(woman) You're home!

91
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,277
Let me look at you. Oh, you look great.

92
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,750
You look great.
You look like Melissa now. 20 years younger.

93
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,960
Thank you. l accept all compliments
from handsome men. Everything all right?

94
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,999
- You sounded strange on the phone.
- lt's all right. l'm just a little tired.

95
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,589
You've come to the right place to rest.

96
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,591
Head up!

97
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,594
- Cool!
- Make you 'appy?

98
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,877
We have lots more
where dat come from, yuh know.

99
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,034
Don't worry about it. Be 'appy!

100
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,151
- Ready?
- Break!

101
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,671
Let's go! Let's go!

102
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,075
Come up to the play!

103
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,436
Play it again! One more time!
Harris, you're a failure!

104
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,752
Tackling 10 yards down the field ain't shit!
Pardon my French. Get back in the huddle!

105
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,389
- Come on! Let's go!
- Coach! Coach, put me in!

106
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,631
Put me in.

107
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,871
l'll be damned.

108
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,034
- Trouble.
- That's me.

109
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,556
- l heard you were shot dead in Bangkok.
- Well, l was in Bangkok. l was there.

110
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,791
But l didn't get shot,
if that's all right with you.

111
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,871
Hell, yeah!

112
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,609
(player) Coach, we're ready!

113
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,591
Be right back. Show him you can play ball!

You know, if you like dat,

But you don't waan' try dis. lt too tough.

120
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,398
Women, it make dem wan' love

Go on. Put it right up to your lips. You ready?

123
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,270
- (all) Break!
- Four laps, then hit the showers!

124
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,349
You were gone so long
you missed my marriage.

125
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,238
- How was it?
- Cambodia was more fun.

126
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,437
l love giving away my possessions!
lt makes me feel spiritual.

127
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,590

lt's all right. Let's go.

129
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,313
Get in the car. Get in the car.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

130
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,832
Tito Barco, we're glad you come
to show some respect.

131
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,034
Walk up.

132
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,159
- Check him clean.
- Cool.

133
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,629
Do your best, man.

134
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,431
Deja.

135
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,339
You very funny, man.

Wait 'ere for de man.

Forward.

138
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,152
(Tito) You move into my territory.
What do you think l'm going to do?

139
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,357
The streets will be red with blood,
and nobody makes money.

140
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,991
They don't even notice us.
We fit in. We look like them.

141
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,709
But you... you go marching into the suburbs
with your rag-head soldiers,...

142
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,156
..and we're front-page news.

143
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,552
The DEA will be crawling down our throats
long after you've gone!

144
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,514
Everybody waan' go heaven,...

145
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,029
..but nobody want dead.

146
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,951
Afraid?

147
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,369
Dis is how it a go.

148
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,094
You are work for l man now.

149

You... a do the sellin'.

150
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,048
You... a be the mule.

151

l supply the crack and the powder.

152
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,173
- What's the split?
- 20 per cent...

153
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,491
..to you.

154
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,536
Give me some time
to consider your proposition.

155
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,336
l will give you an answer very soon.

156
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,530
l'll wait...

157
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,497
..and watch.

158
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,572
(voice echoes) l an' l see everyting.

159
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,249
l an' l be everywhere.

160
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,478
The santero told me that you are the one
with the most frightening power,...

161
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,074
..that you are the one l must see.

162
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,035
This man is not only Abakua -
the leopard people -

163
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,111
..pero tambien es maijumbero.

164
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,076
Muy malo.

165
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,709
This man is using the power of the spirits...

166
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,189
..to do very evil things.

167
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,434
Will you... will you help me?

168
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,989
Aqui es el derecho.

169
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,314
l hope to see you again.

170
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,031
Adios.

171
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,833
Ven, gallito. Tranquilo.

172
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,480
Te necesito para mi trabajo.

173
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,551
Ven, gallito.

174
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,872
Acepta la sangre

175
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,272
��de este gallo que te ofrezco...
..y ayudame a deshacerme
de este hombre malo.

176
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,155
Gallo, te mato por tu sangre.

177
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,232
- Looks good.
- Mm-hm.

178
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,153
Nice to be back. Your team looks great.

179
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,678
Well, it looks good now. Last year
one of my best players OD'd on cocaine.

180
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,117
l remember when the worst problem to worry
about was one of them knockin' up some girl.

181
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,998
- Not any more.
- l think l remember this place.

182
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,789
Wasn't this the place
where all the ugly girls worked?

183
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,737
- Hey, Nurse! Got an emergency here!
- (barmaid) Call a doctor!

184
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,096
Listen, give me a beer,
and give my man here a double.

185
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,492
- l don't do doubles on the first date.
- Now, that's not what l heard!

186
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,578
- This is my boy Hatch.
- Hi, Hatch.

187
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,884
- : Tiene miedo?
- No.

188
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:23,065
Bien. Yo tampoco.

189
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,636
- (man) We're goin'in.
- OK.

190
00:24:45,678 --> 00:24:48,357
- Some hormones in here.
- Oh, yeah.

191
00:24:57,273 --> 00:25:02,451
Looks like one of the locals is doin'
some dealing. Supplementin' his income.

192
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:07,523
- Leave it alone, man. Leave it alone.
- He's buyin' dope from the Jamaicans...

193
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:11,374
- ..and sellin' it to his friends.
- l've been all over the world with this.

194
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:16,022
- lt ain'tjust the Jamaicans. lt's everybody.
- That's the same guy l saw by the school.

195
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:20,252
And every time l see somethin' goin' down,
l see him. There he is.

196
00:25:32,141 --> 00:25:35,486
Last month, my 13-year-old nephew died...

197
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:39,335
..in a crack house run by these guys.
That cut it for me.

198
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:41,721
- l'm sorry.
- Look, l've had it!

199
00:25:42,815 --> 00:25:45,743
And now it seems
they're movin' in down here.

200
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:49,340
- l'm just waitin' to do somethin'.
- Let me tell you somethin'.

201
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:54,154
There's nothin' you can do about it
and there never was, all right?

202
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:59,799
But you gotta try to protect your own, or
are you so burnt out you can't relate to that?

203
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,809
No. l can relate to that.

204
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:14,448
Excuse me.

205
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:33,501
Blood and fire!

206
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:46,390
Go!

207
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:54,349
Move out! Move out!

208
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,528
Come on! Call an ambulance!

209
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,875
Hey, bwoy! Somebody about dead tonight!

210
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,928
Raas, what do you...?

211
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:16,527
Me no know you, but l promise you
you is a dead man walkin'!

212
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,666
So what else is new?

213
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,124
Give us some room here! Come on, let's go.

214
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:41,895
Let's clear the area. Clear that area.

215
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:52,899
You're dead, bwoy! Yuh hear? Dead!

216
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:56,761
- Welcome home.
- ls that the suspect, Mr Hatcher?

217
00:27:56,845 --> 00:27:59,310
Yeah, the first guy up there.

218
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:03,161
All right. Watch it, people.
Stay back behind the line.

219
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:06,132
Like Los Angeles,
New York, and Washington,...

220
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:09,400
..small-town America
now has blood in its streets,...

221
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:13,796
..as a gang shoot-out in Lincoln Heights
tonight has left four dead.

222
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:17,728
Although less than one per cent
of Jamaican immigrants are involved,...

223
00:28:17,816 --> 00:28:22,626
..Jamaican gangs, known as posses, are
now dominating the American drug trade,...

224
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:26,892
..with more than 10,000 members
trafficking drugs in 20 states.

225
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:32,461
According to Justice Department officials,
they are as disciplined as they are violent.

226
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:35,133
Torture and maiming are posse trademarks,...

227
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,456
..and posse gunmen are said to prefer
shooting their victims in public.

228
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:44,636
Sources estimate they have committed
1400 murders in three and a half years.

229
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,412
Dale Harimoto, WXTV, Chicago.

230
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:51,081
- Stay back. Watch it.
- Sheriff O'Dwyer.

231
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:58,577
- l'm Sheriff O'Dwyer. Who might you be?
- Roselli. FBl, OC task force.

232
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,170
- We're taking over here.
- By what authority?

233
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:04,480
United States Government Code,
Title 18, Section 111.

234
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:09,001
Go get their statements.
Keep the looky-loos out of the crime scene.

235
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:12,439
- You're excused, Sheriff.
- Roselli, l won't forget this.

236
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:18,252
You and your agents so much as spit on
the deck, and l'll personally write the citation.

237
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:23,908
Hatcher! Jesus Christ!
What the hell are you doin' back here?

238
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:28,388
Thought l'd visit my mother, you know?
l'm retired now.

239
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:31,735
Retired, huh? Well, that's cosy.
What the hell went down?

240
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:35,786
Gee, l don't know. What does it look like?
lt's a shoot-out... Colombians...

241
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:38,930
- What do you want me to say?
- Probably Tito Barco's clan.

242
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:44,879
- What would Tito Barco be doing up this far?
- Losing. The turf is spreading out, Hatcher.

243
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:49,692
The Jamaican posse's more organised than
the others. They got more guns, more balls.

244
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,196
Jimmy Fingers is giving them everything.

245
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,803
Jimmy Fingers...
ex-casino man out of Atlantic City.

246
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:58,903
That's a piece of cake.
You pop him, you got it.

247
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:02,286
- Why don't you help us out on this one?
- Cos l'm out.

248
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:07,189
- Come on, Hatcher. lt's in the blood.
- lf it's in the blood, l'll get a transfusion.

249
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:12,289
Lieutenant, may l see yuh for a moment? The
professor has found something interesting.

250
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:16,229
- Charles, how ya doin'?
- We'll see you around, Hatcher.

251
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:19,865
- The sign on de wall is Abakua.
- More of this voodoo bullshit?

252
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,221
Professor, you call the markings
on de wall voodoo bullshit?

253
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:27,106
Nope. l've seen them in New York,
Los Angeles and now here.

254
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:32,845
Sal, dis is no bullshit, man. Those markings
were put dere by a man named Screwface.

255
00:30:32,936 --> 00:30:35,697
Know what it means
when we say a man's face is screwed?

256
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:39,746
- No.
- Well, l pray you never have to find that out.

257
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:42,092
Who's that?

258
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:47,035
lt's John Hatcher. He was an undercover
troubleshooter for the DEA.

259
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:51,388
- We worked together a couple of years ago.
- l know him. Him comin' in wid us?

260
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:53,693
No. He thinks he's retired.

261
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:56,709
He still looks functional to me.

262
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:24,294
l have a message for you...

263
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,929
..from Tito!

264
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:30,974
Him say meet him in hell!

265
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,240
# l work day and night to find my daily needs

266
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,920
# Freedom is suppressed
by another one's greed

267
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,480
# Why should certain ones
control another one's needs?

268
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,840
# lt's rebellion these kind of actions breed

269
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,360
# l can't get no justice

270
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
# Under this system

271
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,520
# l can't get no justice...

272
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:23,138
- Dem let you out?
- No jail can hold me...

273
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,244
- ..when Jimmy Fingers is on my side.
- Same.

274
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,042
Jimmy Fingers.

275
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:33,099
Give t'anks for
bringin' out my bredren. Same?

276
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:37,838
Bondsman knew he was gonna skip,
so l figured l'd throw him a little extra.

277
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:41,473
- Monkey, time for business.
- Let's take care o' dis.

278
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,650
Come.

279
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:49,650
# Why should one be judged
by the colour of their skin?

280
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,650
# lnstead of the quality...

281
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,188
No, man. l just think
you have to take it one step at a time.

282
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:18,604
Nobody. Yuh know what l'm sayin'?
Me notjokin', bwoy.

283
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:21,242
Yes, man. Yes. Hold on. Hold on.

00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:25,677
Listen up, you see?

And the magicl be everywhere.

289
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,202
The warriors... Conquerors!

290
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,802
Respec'. The Almighty
has given l an' l his hand.

00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:46,144
His rod of correction l hold.

292
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:52,883
Let no man here fear for his own life!

293
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,080
Dem dat wish l an' l
to be left in poverty and squalor...

00:33:58,168 --> 00:34:00,465
..will demselves be damned!

295
00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:07,119
lf a man commit a crime against you,...

296
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:13,354
..he must be paid back a t'ousand times!

297
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:18,836
Who you fear?

298
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:23,606
Him... or me?

299
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:36,712
Let no man here steer

00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,886
Take it!

304
00:34:57,691 --> 00:34:59,774
- Come.
- Yes.

305
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:09,987
l still don't believe you. lf you don't see
the shit that's happening around us,...

306
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:13,426
- ..you're blind or you don't wanna see.
- Maybe l've seen enough.

307
00:35:13,513 --> 00:35:18,072
- l don't think the world wants to change.
- Look, things do change, man.

308
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,885
lt's like you see this big dam with a leak
in it. You plug it with your finger.

309
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:28,033
Soon you see more holes. You plug it with
your other fingers, your toes, your tongue.

310
00:35:28,122 --> 00:35:31,217
But the water keeps on gushing out.
That's the way it is.

311
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:33,600
Pretty soon, you quit or get killed.

312
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:37,486
Five days later, they got
some shitbird cherry to take your place,...

313
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:40,296
..they give him your shield,
and you're forgotten.

314
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:44,648
The way l look at it, you come home, mind
your own business, watch your own yard.

315
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:48,882
And then, if trouble finds you,
you go after it and you bite its head off...

316
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:51,598
..before it does the same thing to you.

317
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:55,652
Look, Hatch,
you haven't been here in a long time,...

318
00:35:55,748 --> 00:36:00,391
..and l'm telling you, trouble is tapping us
both on the shoulder right now,...

319
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:05,121
- ..and you don't want to turn around.
- Well, l hope you're wrong.

320
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:08,829
You look a little winded there, big guy.

321
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,198
Gimme a break. l'm on vacation.

322
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:13,282
Tracey has something to show you.
She's been waiting.

323
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:39,787
Get down!

324
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,694
Johnny!

325
00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:02,514
They hurt my baby!

326
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:23,062
Tracey is in serious condition,
and she's unstable.

327
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:26,999
There's pressure on the brain
that we'll have to relieve.

328
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:31,565
- Well, what does that mean?
- Surgery. l can't give you a prognosis.

329
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:34,996
She's fighting for her life, and so are we.

330
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:44,327
Doc, you treat this girl like she's
the president of the United States.

331
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:48,430
- Money isn't a consideration.
- We treat all of our patients exactly...

332
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,329
Let me tell you somethin'.
Like the president of the United States, OK?

333
00:37:57,603 --> 00:38:00,615
Don't touch me, John. Don't touch me.

334
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,010
This is your fault.
Do you understand? This is your fault.

335
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:08,393
God damn you! God damn you!

336
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,998
This is your fault! And my baby...

337
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:14,169
My baby...

338
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:36,170
- Jimmy, how ya doin'?
- Hatch, what the fuck are you doin' here?

339
00:39:36,263 --> 00:39:40,823
Why don't you guys take a hike?
Go find another trick, all right?

340
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:46,595
You bailed out a Jamaican, street name
Monkey, the other day. l want him.

341
00:39:46,686 --> 00:39:49,948
This other piece of shit - Screwface -
l want him.

342
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:52,749
You're a scumbag and a puke.
l don't mind that.

343
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,267
Gimme what l need, l leave here a nice guy.
You don't, l fuck you up.

344
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:59,117
You fuckin' know better than that, Hatcher.

345
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:05,845
Come here. l just wanna talk to you
for a minute. Come here.

346
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,994
The Mob throws you out of Atlantic City.
Now you sell guns to the Jamaicans.

347
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:15,983
Fuckin' sell anything to anybody, except you.
Wouldn't sell you the sweat off my balls!

348
00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:17,868
- ls that right?
- Yeah.

349
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,968
Watch it!

350
00:40:29,382 --> 00:40:31,929
- You're a fuckin' dead man, Hatcher!
- Yeah?

351
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:35,483
l'm fuckin' Jimmy Fingers!
l'm a made fuckin' man!

352
00:40:40,516 --> 00:40:43,016
God made men.

353
00:40:46,837 --> 00:40:49,134
l wanna know where Screwface is.

354
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,445
- Screwface? Me don't know no Screwface.
- Really?

355
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,034
Hm. That's strange.

356
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:59,811
- Does that remind you?
- Just shoot me now, man!

357
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:02,611
l got a better idea. We're gonna go for a ride.

358
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:08,725
Everybody's gonna see us, and Screwface
is gonna find out what good buddies we are.

359
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:11,357
Come on.

360
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:16,599
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, man! All right!

361
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:21,828
Just easy. l will take you.

362
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:24,716
Good. l wanna get there while l'm still young.

363
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,862
Screwface kill me
a t'ousand deaths worse dan you.

364
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:31,410
- Yeah?
- Find him your fuckin' self!

365
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:00,926
Well?

366
00:42:01,014 --> 00:42:05,027
One thought he was invincible.
The other thought he could fly.

367
00:42:05,117 --> 00:42:07,796
- So?
- They were both wrong.

368
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:21,814
l wanna know the second
that call comes in, OK?

369
00:42:21,902 --> 00:42:23,021
So?

370
00:42:23,116 --> 00:42:28,009
Two dead. Dis one was shot in de forehead.
De other one was forced out de window.

371
00:42:28,097 --> 00:42:30,180
Did you find the hookers?

372
00:42:30,274 --> 00:42:33,369
Do you honestly believe
now is the time for findin' them?

373
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:35,835
- This job was done by a pro.
- ls that right?

374
00:42:35,924 --> 00:42:40,484
That's right, and l'll bet my money
it was John Hatcher. Find me somethin'.

375
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:44,749
- Sal, l will find you somethin'.
- He thinks he can do things his own way,...

376
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,102
..but l'll tell you something - he can't.

377
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:51,568
Stay close to home, Charles.

378
00:42:52,584 --> 00:42:55,084
Do it, man. Do it.

379
00:43:13,262 --> 00:43:15,762
Where Nesta?

380
00:43:21,257 --> 00:43:25,436
(whispers) Jimmy Fingers
and Nesta are not too good.

381
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:29,039
Nesta dead? Who do it?
De white boy Hatcher?

382
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,511
l want... Hatcher dead!

383
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:53,989
l want his family dead!

384
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,881
And if you cannot kill him,...

385
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,817
..l go kill him!

386
00:44:01,902 --> 00:44:04,402
And then l go kill you.

387
00:44:04,403 --> 00:44:09,635

388
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:59,242
- What about protection for my family?
- They're assigned.

389
00:44:59,332 --> 00:45:02,795
- Good.
- l should probably have them tailing you.

390
00:45:03,852 --> 00:45:07,233
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Where were you last night?

391
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:09,410
With a friend.

392
00:45:10,173 --> 00:45:12,673
Stay retired.

393
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:39,678
Hello?

394
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:46,591
Hi. l'm John Hatcher.
l saw you the other night.

395
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:51,236
- Yes. At the Shamrock.
- l kind of need some help.

396
00:45:51,492 --> 00:45:54,253
Hold on. l'll be right down.

397
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,855
lt's an African black magic symbol.

398
00:45:58,943 --> 00:46:02,406
lt was used by the Jamaican
drug gang the other night.

399
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:07,179
- The FBl said l'd be getting photos today.
- l'm not with the FBl, you know.

400
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:13,001
Well... the cow's tongue means
you've talked or exposed them,...

401
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:16,555
..and have been marked for death.
Where did you get these?

402
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:21,286
l got these...
at my family's house this morning.

403
00:46:23,723 --> 00:46:26,402
What about this black cross?

404
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:30,879
This may seem ridiculous to you,
Hatcher, but these people are for real.

405
00:46:30,964 --> 00:46:33,464
Your family has been marked.

406
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:41,292
- Could l use your phone for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

407
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:56,947
- Hello?
- lt's me. ls everything all right?

408
00:46:57,042 --> 00:47:01,221
Yeah, Johnny. l'm fine.
l just got back here from the hospital.

409
00:47:01,312 --> 00:47:04,776
Mom's there with Tracey.
She's better. She's stable.

410
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:10,013
- l just had to come home and get some rest.
- Go look out the window. ls the guard there?

411
00:47:10,102 --> 00:47:12,602
Um, waitjust a minute.

412
00:47:18,348 --> 00:47:21,812
Yeah. The car's there,
but, uh, l don't see the guard.

413
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,916
Johnny?

414
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:27,840
Johnny!

415
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:32,361
My God.

416
00:47:46,728 --> 00:47:49,228
Somebody help me!

417
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,717
- What do you want?!
- l want you.

418
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:59,152
What do you want? Just leave me alone.
Somebody's coming.

419
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:02,422
- You're making a big mistake.
- You're lying!

420
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,777
Stop the blood claat cryin'.

Everybody must dead!

422

No! No, no...

423
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:44,024

424
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:57,083

Help me! Help me! Johnny, help me!

435
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:20,095
He said... He said he'd be back.
He said he'd kill us both.

436
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:24,742
Somehow, l don't think
he's gonna get the chance.

437
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,388
l can't wait to nail this fucker.

00:50:58,193 --> 00:51:00,277
Serious fun.

- Back off, bwoy.

455
00:55:56,393 --> 00:55:59,441
Me say back off! You didn't hear me say?
You want her dead?

456
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:03,295
Go ahead, kill her. l don't know her.
l don't care about her.

457
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:06,348
l got you where l want you.
You like a dog wid no teeth.

458
00:56:06,439 --> 00:56:10,499
You wanna kill her, kill her.
l don't mind if you kill her. l don't know her.

459
00:56:12,551 --> 00:56:16,860
You a bad bwoy. Me a carve you now, bwoy.
Me a carve you! Me a carve you!

460
00:56:17,197 --> 00:56:19,744
Me a carve blood!

461
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,294
Run, dread! Run!

462
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:43,815
Raas, didn't you see it?
Blood claat, what run for?

463
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:47,284
A one white boy and two bredda enough!

464
00:56:47,377 --> 00:56:52,270
Let's kick dis little blood claat.
Batty-hole, yuh see.

465
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:55,574
- l ready a ready.
- Get him!

466
00:56:57,967 --> 00:57:00,051
Hold on. Hold on, now.

467
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:11,706
Tear you, Rasta!

468
00:57:32,354 --> 00:57:34,936
You fuck with my family and you die.

469
00:57:44,032 --> 00:57:48,509
- Now we're talking serious fun, man.
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

470
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:03,194
l've never met anyone quite like you, Hatcher.

471
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,544
Go down to any soup kitchen,
you're gonna find a lot of guys just like me.

472
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:11,319
- Why a soup kitchen?
- l'm just another unemployed guy.

473
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:14,872
l don't think there is a lot of guys
like you anywhere.

474
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:17,727
What's that supposed to mean?

475
00:58:17,812 --> 00:58:21,824
l've met a guy who is nice, not married,
gay, or trying to find himself,...

476
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:25,378
..and he's trying very hard
to get himself killed.

477
00:58:25,472 --> 00:58:28,984
Well, l have some
unfinished business, you know,...

478
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:32,620
..and l was hoping that you'd maybe
give me some of your advice.

479
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:37,139
- What are you planning to do?
- l'm gonna take out the posse.

480
00:58:38,955 --> 00:58:40,955
Then destroy their system.

481
00:58:41,048 --> 00:58:45,060
When Screwface kills he wants
everyone to see he did it, or ordered it.

482
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,281
That way he's both feared and worshipped.

483
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:53,521
You'd have to kill him so the posse
thinks you've taken his power.

484
00:58:53,606 --> 00:58:56,320
That way they will believe
your magic is bigger.

485
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:01,339
Otherwise they'll never stop
until you and your family are dead.

486
01:00:44,531 --> 01:00:46,911
l want you to meet my sister.

487
01:00:50,935 --> 01:00:53,316
Goddess of fire.

488
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:03,976
This is what you ordered. Do you want
anything else? Wires? Surveillance?

489
01:02:04,062 --> 01:02:07,277
- No. Just firearms this time.
- OK. You got it.

490
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:09,452
- For you.
- Thank you.

491
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:15,988
- You still sober?
- Five years, man. One day at a time.

492
01:02:16,075 --> 01:02:18,075
Stay away from that dope.

493
01:02:27,461 --> 01:02:29,544
Hang on. Hang on.

494
01:02:42,613 --> 01:02:45,875
Max, meet Charles. Charles, meet Max.

495
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,875
Man, l been after Screwface
for five long years, yuh see?

496
01:02:55,966 --> 01:03:00,193
l have followed him
from Kingston to here. All around.

497
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:04,123
- You break my heart.
- Your tactic is makin' him tougher to snatch.

498
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:06,712
Him jump already, yuh know?

499
01:03:09,528 --> 01:03:13,623
An' it's only l... who can guide you
to what it is yuh seek.

500
01:03:14,844 --> 01:03:17,559
l don't know if that'd be
a wise career move for you.

501
01:03:17,775 --> 01:03:22,287
Come on! Look close!
Who you think me work for? The DEA?

502
01:03:22,379 --> 01:03:25,594
l'm a Jamaican cop, man,
and Screwface is my career!

503
01:03:25,937 --> 01:03:31,544
Look, man. l don't really care who you work
for. You got your reasons and l got mine.

504
01:03:37,364 --> 01:03:40,329
Screwface has gone back to Jamaica.

505
01:03:44,903 --> 01:03:47,951
You know, Charles, sometimes...

506
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:50,293
..three's not a crowd.

507
01:03:50,387 --> 01:03:53,149
The way l look at it, we need each other.

508
01:03:54,322 --> 01:03:56,036
- Hm.
- Know what l mean?

509
01:04:04,744 --> 01:04:06,709
Let's do it, man.

510
01:05:02,425 --> 01:05:04,925
How ya doin'? Care package.

511
01:05:11,383 --> 01:05:13,883
Uncle Sam's contribution?

512
01:05:14,899 --> 01:05:17,149
Welfare for warfare, yuh know?

513
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:41,898
This is my silent partner.

514
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,285
A whisper in the ear
from this girl goes a long way.

515
01:06:01,948 --> 01:06:05,662
You didn't hear a thing.
You heard the slide click a little.

516
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:08,222
Massive cool.

517
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:10,394
Forward, Jamaica.

518
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:30,120
# l work day and night to find my daily needs

519
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,160
# Freedom is suppressed
by another one's greed

520
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:42,920
# Why should certain ones
control another one's needs?

521
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,200
# lt's rebellion this kind of action breeds

522
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,600
# l can't get no justice

523
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,040
# Under this system

524
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,200
# l can't get me no justice

525
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,080
# ln this society

526
01:07:05,322 --> 01:07:09,334
These are the streets dat breed
de Screwfaces o' de world.

527
01:07:09,424 --> 01:07:13,901
This is the first time l ever got the idea
it's not all sunshine and bikinis.

528
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,669
l owe you an apology. Until today l thought

529
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:19,208
all Jamaicans were dope-dealing dreads.

530
01:07:19,303 --> 01:07:24,148
Don't feel you have to apologise for nothin'.
Man, these streets are hard out here.

531
01:07:24,242 --> 01:07:29,135
And some people make a bad choice,
dat's all. They say life is hard.

532
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,000
# l can't get no justice

533
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,240
# Under this system

534
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,680
# l can't get no justice

# l can't get me no justice

537
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,480
# Under this system

538
01:08:14,305 --> 01:08:16,388
- What, man?
- Nothin'.

539
01:08:16,481 --> 01:08:21,291
What are you doin' all de way up here?
Not enough trouble in Kingston, beast-boy?

540
01:08:21,546 --> 01:08:24,724
Back with country, boy. You do your duty?

541
01:08:26,213 --> 01:08:28,297
Pay him.

542
01:08:33,078 --> 01:08:37,090
Dis gal... she hang
with Screwface more time.

543
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:41,442
Dey always partying together.
l usually find her at de Cat Club.

544
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,140
# lf you been a wicked boy,
your time has come

545
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:48,420
# You don't live right,

546
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,460
# John Crow, we're goin'

547
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:55,980
# John Crow, we're goin'

548
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:59,380
# John Crow, l don't need de retribution

549
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,740
# Justice has finally find a way

550
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:09,100
# Screwface, you know
that your time has come

551
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:12,780
# You don't do right,
you're gonna dead tonight

552
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,940
# So now l goin' take you

# Justice has finally find a way

# Are you worried it's just
a wolf in sheep's clothing?

559
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,620
# Tryin' to lead the children astray

560
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:51,180

# Justice has finally find a way

565
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:10,566
Screwface?

566
01:10:12,371 --> 01:10:14,455
Road to doom.

567
01:10:15,301 --> 01:10:19,730
- Sounds like you know this guy pretty well.
- Yeah, l know him.

568
01:10:19,822 --> 01:10:21,952
l partied wid him.

569
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:26,469
l don't care him sell the drugs, sir.
lt's part o' doin' business.

570
01:10:26,561 --> 01:10:31,454
But my sister, she lost a shipment
and him cut her dead.

571
01:10:31,542 --> 01:10:36,471
And for dat, somehow,
someday, him a go dust off.

572
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:42,294
Why don't you just tell me what l gotta know,
and l'll go do what l gotta do?

573
01:10:45,862 --> 01:10:48,875
Screwface have two head and four eyes,...

574
01:10:48,876 --> 01:10:51,841
..an' dat is de secret to his magic.

575
01:11:28,391 --> 01:11:31,319

Fuck you.

You is a dog after a bone!

An' yuh have no teeth.

582
01:18:58,583 --> 01:19:01,048
You was conceived in darkness.

But you is an empty shell inside.

01:20:37,272 --> 01:20:39,486

589
01:20:39,574 --> 01:20:41,740

So, bredds... tell me one more time.
Did you tell them exactly what l told you to?

592
01:21:18,042 --> 01:21:22,351
- And what did they say?
- Exactly what you said they was goin' to say.

593
01:21:22,437 --> 01:21:27,080
- ls that right? And what was that?
- ''Business is business, man.''

594
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:29,464
Ten dollars.

595
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:33,612
- lt ain't over yet.
- Does this guy ever pay you on time?

596
01:22:37,615 --> 01:22:40,031
So who's the boss-man?

597
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:43,091
- l man.
- Thanks for taking this meeting, man.

Hey! Anybody ever see this?

Screwface is dead!
Now, you get the fuck outta town or die!

Yuh must want me and me bumbo-claat

Dead and about to be buried!

604
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,073
The evil is demolished.
