1
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,966
Did you talk to anyone?
Look at me.

2
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,593
Talk to anybody, huh?

3
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,094
Did you see anybody?

4
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,764
Did you talk to anybody, huh?

5
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,141
Did you make a phone call?

6
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,311
Who did you talk to?

7
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,577
Got anything else to say?

8
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,454
I didn't think so.

9
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,503
How long was he
out of your sight?

10
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,754
Maybe a couple of minutes.

11
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,632
Chico, l'm disappointed
in you!
How could you do that?

12
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,717
Look, we can't go
into that meeting.

13
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,011
If anyone
was ever made,
we were made.

14
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,972
You know what l say?
We're going.

15
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,142
What are you?
Are you crazy?

16
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,353
I mean, probably
a hundred people
saw us chasing him.

17
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,687
Chico!

18
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:31,776
Since when did anybody
ever accuse me of being sane?
We're going.

19
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,027
All right?
Come on. Come on.

20
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,320
Jesus Christ.

21
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,804
You see anything strange?

22
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,848
Just the usual weirdness.

23
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,813
The deal's going down, man.

24
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,942
Keep an eye out for me, huh?

25
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,319
Right, Hatcher.

26
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,114
Are you sure it's cool?

27
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,741
It's very cool.
Relax.

28
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,326
Good.
Then let's go.

29
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,955
And next time,
you're going to introduce me
to Salazar, aren't you?

30
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,790
Yes, l promise.
All right. Let's go.

31
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,667
You got it.
All right.

32
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,896
Well, here we are,
gentlemen.
Right on time.

33
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,899
You see? l told you.
This guy, he's been
a good customer.

34
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,319
Did you bring the green?

35
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,529
Of course.
Got it right here.

36
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,703
Half.

37
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,246
Then what are you here for?

38
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm here to do business.
lf you don't like that, then
l'll take off, all right?

39
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,632
You know something?
l do business
for a long time.

40
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,134
You know why?
'Cause l'm careful.

41
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,595
You can never be
too careful, right?

42
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,472
Careful is good
with me, amigo.

43
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,974
Careful never killed nobody.

44
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,225
Is that right?

45
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,812
Stupid.
Stupid kills, me entiendes?

46
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,897
Okay, gringo, l think
we can do business.

47
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,400
Good. Then let's get
it over with, all right?

48
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,610
What's the matter?
Hey, how you doing?

49
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:53,477
You know, in our country,
we love cops.

50
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,274
When we do a cop,
it's like a tremendous
status symbol.

51
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,070
But an American cop
is like a gift from God.

52
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,282
My little friend here
is gonna open you up
a little bit

53
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,660
so you can tell us
where the rest of
the money is, huh?

54
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,745
Huh?

55
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,705
There is no more money.

56
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,373
There's gotta be more money.

57
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,430
Hatcher, let's get
the hell out of here!
Come on!

58
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,976
CHlCO: Cover me!

59
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,604
All right. Clear.
Let's go.

60
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,314
Quickly.
Okay.

61
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,274
Time to go, Hatch.

62
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,519
I knew
that the only justice
that l could get

63
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,690
would be that
that l made for myself,
not always by law.

64
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,403
Father, l just
killed a woman.

65
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,492
L've lied, l've slept
with informants,

66
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,287
l've taken drugs,
l've falsified evidence.

67
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,624
I did whatever
l had to do
to get the bad guys.

68
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,504
Then l realized something.

69
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,385
That l had become
what l most despised.

70
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,053
PRlEST: Do you
have a family?

71
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,680
Yes, Father.

72
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,351
Go to them
and leave these things.

73
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,104
Try to find
the gentle self
inside you.

74
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,857
Allow this person
to come back.

75
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,074
What are you gonna
retire to, Hatcher, huh?

76
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,203
You're up your neck
in this life.

77
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,708
I got Bennett
burning up the phone lines
every day.

78
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,585
I got the President
going on television,

79
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,463
promising results,
for Christ's sake.

80
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,549
This is not the time
for you to walk out on me.
Not now.

81
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,551
You can't...
l've had enough.

82
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,349
Look, John.

83
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,687
There was nothing
you could've done
to save Chico.

84
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,689
These things happen
when you're in deep.
You know that.

85
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,943
Take a leave.
With pay.

86
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,529
Hell, take a month.
Take two.

87
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,448
You've felt burned out
before this.

88
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,992
I need you, John, okay?

89
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:43,332
Pete, nothing we ever did
amounted to shit,
and you know it.

90
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,555
Who is it?

91
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,015
Uncle John.

92
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,895
You're not my uncle.

93
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,731
My uncle John lives far away.

94
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:52,776
I am your uncle,
and you've grown up
to be a big girl.

95
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,988
You allergic to cats?

96
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,114
Nope.

97
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,991
Okay, then you can come in.

98
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,826
MELlSSA:
Tracey, come on back...

99
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,913
Johnny? Johnny!

100
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,498
I can't believe it.
Oh, God!

101
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,042
How's my little sister?

102
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,800
Boys, come and say hello
to your uncle John.
Come on.

103
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,260
Who's this?
This is Ricky.

104
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,387
Ricky, how you doing?
You look great.

105
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,473
You look good.
Everything's all right?

106
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,515
RlCKY: Yeah,
everything's great.

107
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,351
Hey, Uncle John.

108
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,769
Hey, how you doing?

109
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,520
All right.
Welcome home.

110
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,646
Where you been?

111
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,981
L've been here,
waiting for you.

112
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,946
You're home!

113
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,411
Let me look at you.
Oh. You look great.

114
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,872
You look great.
Why, you look like
Melissa now, huh?

115
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,791
- 20 years younger.
- Thank you.

116
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,378
I accept all compliments
from handsome men.

117
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,838
Everything all right?
You sounded strange
on the phone.

118
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,591
No. lt's all right.
I'm just a little tired.

119
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,511
Well, you've come
to the right place
to rest.

120
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,510
Head up!

121
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,143
Head up!

122
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,525
Cool!

123
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,734
Make you happy?

124
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,696
Hey, we have lots more
where that
come from, you know.

125
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,032
Don't worry about it.
Be happy.

126
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,244
- Ready?
- Break!

127
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,917
Let's go!
Let's go!

128
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,881
Come up and play!
Play it again.
One more time.

129
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,508
Harris, you're a failure!

130
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,677
Tackling ten yards
down the field
ain't shit!

131
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,179
Pardon my French.
Get back in the huddle.

132
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,889
Come on. Let's go!

133
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:55,227
Coach?
Coach, put me in.
Put me in.

134
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,816
L'll be damned.
Trouble.

135
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,318
That's me.

136
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,447
And l heard you were
shot dead in
the streets of Bangkok.

137
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,909
Well, l was in Bangkok.
I was there.

138
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,413
But l didn't get shot,
if that's all right with you.

139
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,914
Hell, yeah!

140
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,829
All right, Coach,
we're ready.

141
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,920
L'll be right back.

142
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,673
Hey, come on!
Come on! Show this guy
you can play some ball.

143
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,008
You know, if you like that,

144
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,427
you should try
some of this thing
right here.

145
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,220
Send you right to heaven.

146
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,139
Make cloud nine look soft.

147
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,515
Is that crack?

148
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,851
That it is, man.
You know,
the real deal.

149
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,853
The shit you hear
about on the news.

150
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,104
Hey, it's funny, you know,

151
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,609
how the man always tell lie
about certain things
what make us happy.

152
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,444
But you don't
want to try this.

153
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,404
It too tough.

154
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,240
Women, it make them want
to love all the time,
you know?

155
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,783
L'll try it.
All the time.

156
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:52,909
Sure thing, pretty girl.

157
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,954
Go on, put it
right up to your lips.
You ready?

158
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,289
Break!

159
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,874
Four laps
then hit the showers.

160
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,754
Why, you were gone so long,
you missed
my entire marriage.

161
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,130
How was it?

162
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,965
Cambodia was more fun.

163
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,467
I mean, l love
giving away
all my possessions.

164
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,093
It makes me feel
real spiritual.

165
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,261
And probably poor, huh?

166
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,387
And poor!

167
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,654
It's all right.
Let's go.

168
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,116
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

169
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,879
Tito Barco,
we're glad you come
to show some respect.

170
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,048
Walk up.

171
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,972
Check him clean.
Cool.

172
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,307
Do your best, man.

173
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,777
You very funny, man.

174
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,992
Wait here for the man.

175
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,886
Forward.

176
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,604
TlTO: You move
into my territory.

177
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,814
What do you think
l'm going to do?

178
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,109
The streets will be
red with blood
and nobody makes money.

179
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,195
They don't even notice us.

180
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,281
We fit in.
We look like them.

181
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,991
But you?

182
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:42,996
You go marching into
the suburbs with
your rag-head soldiers

183
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,499
and we're
front-page news.

184
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:50,295
The DEA will be crawling
down our throats
long after you've gone.

185
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,756
Everybody want go heaven

186
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,092
but nobody want dead.

187
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,721
Afraid?

188
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,989
This is how it'll go.

189
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,494
You a work for l man now.

190
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,038
You a do the selling.

191
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,625
You a be the mule.

192
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,922
I supply the crack
and the powder.

193
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,841
What's the split?

194
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,261
20 percent to you.

195
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:51,231
Give me some time
to consider
your proposition.

196
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,901
I will give you
an answer very soon.

197
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:59,281
I a wait and watch.

198
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,534
I and l see everything.

199
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,957
I and l be everywhere.

200
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,596
TlTO: The santero told me
that you are the one

201
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,723
with the most
frightening power,

202
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,309
that you are the one
l must seek.

203
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,198
This man is not only Abakuá,
the leopard people.

204
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,082
This man
is using the power
of the spirits

205
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,793
to do very evil things.

206
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:58,006
Will you...
Will you help me?

207
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,853
I hope to see you again.

208
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,990
Looks good.
Mmm-hmm.

209
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,077
Nice to be back.
Your team looks great.

210
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,245
It looks good now.

211
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,791
Last year
one of my best players
OD'd on cocaine.

212
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,085
I remember
when the worst problem
l had to worry about

213
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,420
was one of them
knocking up some girl.

214
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,005
Not anymore.

215
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,507
I think l remember
this place.

216
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,671
Wasn't this the place
where all
the ugly girls worked?

217
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,521
Hey, Nurse!
Got an emergency here!

218
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,272
BARMAlD: Call a doctor!

219
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,776
Listen, give me a beer,
and give my man here
a double.

220
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,528
You know, l don't
do doubles
on the first date.

221
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,862
Now, that's not what l heard.

222
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,991
This is my boy Hatch.

223
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,535
Hi, Hatch.

224
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,592
They're going in.

225
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:30,760
Okay.

226
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,945
Some hormones in here.

227
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,280
Oh, yeah!

228
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,333
Looks like one of
the locals
is doing some dealing.

229
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,169
Supplementing his income.

230
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,753
Leave it alone, man.

231
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,089
Leave it alone.
Leave it alone?

232
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,507
He's buying dope
from the Jamaicans

233
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,842
and selling it
to his friends.

234
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,094
Look, l've been all over
the world with this stuff
and you know it.

235
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,929
It ain't just
the Jamaicans.
lt's everybody.

236
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,640
But that's the same guy
l saw down
by the school today.

237
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,060
And every time l see
something going down,
l see him. There he is.

238
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,202
Last month,
my 1 3-year-old
nephew died

239
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,370
in a crack house
run by these guys.

240
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,331
That cut it for me.
I'm sorry.

241
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,333
Look, l've had it.

242
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,212
And now it seems
they're moving in
down here.

243
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,088
I'm just waiting
to do something,
you hear?

244
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,091
Let me tell you something.
There's nothing
you can do about it

245
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,802
and there never was,
all right?

246
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,473
Yeah, but you gotta try
to protect your own.

247
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,309
Or are you so burnt out
you can't relate to that?

248
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,186
No, l can relate to that.

249
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,949
Excuse me.

250
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,133
Blood and fire!

251
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,897
Yo!

252
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,822
Move out!
Move out!

253
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,866
Come on!
Call an ambulance!

254
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,837
Hey, boy, somebody
about dead tonight.

255
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:17,802
Me not know you, no.
But l promise you,
you is a dead man walking.

256
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,345
So what else is new?

257
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,446
Give me some room here!

258
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,947
Come on. Let's go.

259
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,285
Let's clear the area.
Clear that area.

260
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,629
You're dead, boy, hear?
Dead!

261
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,382
Welcome home.

262
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,842
Was that the suspect,
Mr. Hatcher?

263
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,011
Yeah, the first guy up there.

264
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,180
OFFlCER: All right,
watch it, people.

265
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,599
Stay back behind the lines.

266
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,226
Like Los Angeles,
New York and Washington,

267
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,480
small-town America
now has blood
in its streets

268
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:15,026
as a gang shootout
in Lincoln Heights tonight
has left four dead.

269
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,736
Although
less than one percent

270
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,696
of Jamaican immigrants
are involved,

271
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,032
Jamaican gangs,
known as posses,

272
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,701
are now dominating
the American drug trade

273
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:28,206
with more than 1 0,000
members trafficking drugs
in 20 states.

274
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,500
According to Justice
Department officials,

275
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,503
they are as disciplined
as they are violent.

276
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,047
Torture and maiming
are posse trademarks,

277
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,216
and posse gunmen
are said to prefer

278
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,301
shooting their victims
in public.

279
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,261
Sources estimate
they have committed

280
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,932
1,400 murders
in three and a half years.

281
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,477
Dale Harimoto, WXTV, Chicago.

282
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,853
OFFlCER: Stay back.
Watch it.

283
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,063
Sheriff O'Dwyer.

284
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,318
I'm Sheriff O'Dwyer.
Who might you be?

285
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,571
Roselli, FBl, OC Task Force.
We're taking over here.

286
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,031
By what authority?

287
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,408
United States
Government Code,

288
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,410
Title 1 8, Section 1 1 1.

289
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,413
Go get their statements.
Keep the looky-loos
out of the crime scene.

290
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,872
Yes, sir.

291
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,249
You're excused, Sheriff.

292
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,292
Roselli, l won't forget this.

293
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,753
You and your agents
so much as spit
on the deck around here

294
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,922
and l'll personally
write the citation.

295
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,676
Hatcher.

296
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,679
Jesus Christ.
What the hell
are you doing back here?

297
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,265
Thought l'd visit
my mother, you know.

298
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,100
I'm retired now.

299
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,144
Retired, huh?
Well, that's cozy.
Yeah.

300
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,437
So what the hell went down?

301
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,313
Gee, l don't know.
What does it look
like, Roselli?

302
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,400
It's a shootout, Colombians,
what do you want me to say?

303
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,819
Yeah, figures.
Probably
Tito Barco's clan.

304
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,280
What would Tito Barco
be doing up this far?

305
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,616
Losing. The turf is
spreading out, Hatcher.

306
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,286
The Jamaican posse
is more organized
than these other players.

307
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,371
They got more guns,
more balls.

308
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,999
Jimmy Fingers is giving
them everything from arms
to legal protection.

309
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,294
Jimmy Fingers, Jimmy Fingers,
ex-casino man
out of Atlantic City.

310
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,462
Right.
It's a piece of cake.

311
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,547
You pop him, you got it.
Hey,

312
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,132
why don't you
help us out on this one?

313
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,800
'Cause l'm out.
You know l'm out.

314
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,636
Hey, come on, Hatcher.
It's in the blood.

315
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,805
If it's in the blood,
l'll get a transfusion,
all right?

316
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,810
Pardon me, Lieutenant.
May l see you
for a moment?

317
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,852
It seems the professor
has found something
very interesting.

318
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,228
Charles, how you doing?

319
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,063
We'll see you
around, Hatcher.

320
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,649
The sign on the wall
is Abakuá.

321
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,443
What, more of this
voodoo bullshit?

322
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,779
Professor,
you call the markings on
the wall voodoo bullshit?

323
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:27,783
Nope. Seen them
in New York, Los Angeles
and now here.

324
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,578
Sal, this is
no bullshit, man.

325
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,664
Those markings
were put there by a man
named Screwface.

326
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,292
You know what it means
when we say
a man face is screwed?

327
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,376
ROSELLl: No.

328
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,171
Well, l pray
you never have to
find that out.

329
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,048
Who's that?

330
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:47,386
ROSELLl: lt's John Hatcher.
He was an undercover
troubleshooter for the DEA.

331
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,231
We worked together on one
a couple years ago.

332
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,974
Yes, l know him.
Him coming in with us?

333
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,227
ROSELLl: No, he thinks
he's retired.

334
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,604
He still looks
functional to me.

335
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,632
I have a message for you

336
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,093
from Tito.

337
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,888
Him say, meet him in hell!

338
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:50,658
I work day and night
to find my daily needs

339
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,331
Freedom is suppressed
by another one's greed

340
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:03,879
Why should certain ones
control another one's needs?

341
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,553
It's rebellion
these kind of action breeds

342
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,222
l can't get no justice

343
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,183
Under this system

344
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,519
What up, dread?

345
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,856
Them let you out?

346
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,441
Yes, man.
No jail can hold me

347
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,318
when Jimmy Fingers
is on my side.

348
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,069
Same.

349
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,113
Jimmy Fingers.

350
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,367
Give thanks
for bringing out
my bredren. Same.

351
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,036
Bondsman knew
he was gonna skip,

352
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,913
so l figured l'd throw him
a little extra.

353
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,124
Hey, Monkey.
Time for business.

354
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,626
Yeah, let's
take care of this.

355
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,877
Come.

356
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,216
Why should one be judged
by the color of their skin?

357
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,928
Instead of the quality...

358
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,652
No, man.
I just think you have

359
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,904
to take it
one step at a time.

360
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,119
No time in here. Nobody.
You know what l'm saying?

361
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,496
Me not joking, boy.

362
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,830
Yes, man, yes.

363
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,500
Hold on, hold on.
Listen up, you see.

364
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,628
Our provider, the man
of science, a come.

365
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,424
Dreadlocks, Monkey
be with us again.
That no good?

366
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,178
And the magic be everywhere.

367
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,139
- The warriors.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,891
Conquerors.

369
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,893
- Respect.
- Respect...

370
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,688
The Almighty
has given l and l
his hand.

371
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,940
His rod of correction l hold.

372
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:52,988
Let no man here
fear for his own life!

373
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:57,868
Them that wish
l and l to be left
in poverty and squalor

374
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,454
will themselves be damned.

375
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,836
If a man commit a crime
against you,

376
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,800
he must be paid
back a thousand times!

377
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,472
Who you fear?

378
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,351
Him or me?

379
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:36,323
Let no man here
steer from the path
l have prepared!

380
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,416
Them the streets out there
belong to you now!

381
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,044
Take it.

382
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,171
Lrie.

383
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,215
Take it!
Take it!

384
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,925
Take it!
Take it!

385
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,343
Yeah!

386
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,554
- Go.
- Yes.

387
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,272
I still don't
believe you, man.
lf you don't see

388
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,523
the shit
that's happening
around us,

389
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,275
you're blind
or you just
don't want to see.

390
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,902
Maybe l've seen enough.

391
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,945
Listen, man, l don't think
the world wants
to change anyway.

392
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,531
But things do change, man.

393
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,783
Let me tell you something.

394
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,618
It's like you see
this big dam
with a leak in it.

395
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,411
You plug it with your finger.

396
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,176
Pretty soon
you see more holes,
bigger ones.

397
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,290
You plug it with
your other fingers,
you plug it with your toes,

398
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,625
you plug it with your tongue.

399
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,210
But the water keeps
on gushing out.

400
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,753
That's the way it is.

401
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,297
Pretty soon,
you quit
or get killed.

402
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,009
Five days later they got
some shit-bird cherry
to take your place.

403
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,678
They give him
your shield and
you're forgotten about.

404
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,597
The way l look at it,
you come home,

405
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,974
mind your own business,
watch your own yard.

406
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,643
And then,
if trouble finds you,

407
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,187
you go after it and
you bite its head off,

408
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,148
before it does
the same thing to you.
Huh?

409
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,985
Look, Hatch,
you haven't been here
in a long time.

410
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,824
And l'm telling you,
trouble is tapping us both
on the shoulder right now.

411
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,450
And you don't want
to turn around.

412
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:02,910
I hope you're wrong.

413
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,166
You look a little
winded there, big guy.

414
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,252
Give me a break.
I'm on vacation.

415
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,543
Tracey has something
to show you.
She's been waiting.

416
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,822
Get down!

417
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,256
Johnny!

418
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:03,095
They hurt my baby! No!

419
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:23,073
Tracey is
in serious condition
and she's unstable.

420
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:27,077
There's pressure
on the brain
that we'll have to relieve.

421
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,079
What does that mean?
Surgery.

422
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,332
I can't give you a prognosis.

423
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,251
She's fighting
for her life,
and so are we.

424
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,009
Let me tell you
something, Doc.
You treat this girl like

425
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,261
she's the President
of the United States,

426
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,472
and money
isn't a consideration.

427
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,265
We treat all of
our patients exactly...

428
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,475
Let me tell you something.

429
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,144
Like the President of
the United States, okay?

430
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,527
Don't touch me, John.
Don't touch me!

431
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,155
This is your fault.
Do you understand?

432
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,032
This is your fault.

433
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,369
God damn you!
God damn you!

434
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,788
This is your fault,
and my baby...

435
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,831
My baby!

436
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,537
Jimmy, how you doing, man?

437
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,748
Hatcher, what the fuck
are you doing here?

438
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,708
Why don't you guys
take a hike?

439
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,585
Go find another trick,
all right?

440
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,920
Let me tell you something.
You bailed out a Jamaican

441
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,216
street named Monkey
the other day.
l want him.

442
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,428
This other piece of shit,
Screwface? l want him.

443
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,264
Now l know you,
you're a scumbag and a puke.
l don't mind that.

444
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,183
You give me what l need,
l'm gonna
leave here a nice guy.

445
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,684
You don't,
l'm gonna fuck you up.

446
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,561
You fucking know
better than that, Hatcher.

447
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,146
You know where the fuck...

448
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,900
Come here. l just want to
talk to you for a minute.

449
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,985
Come here, come here, look.

450
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:07,946
The mob throws you out
of Atlantic City,

451
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,365
you come here,
you're selling guns
to the Jamaicans, huh?

452
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,243
Fucking sell anything
to anybody, Hatcher,
except you, man.

453
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,454
I won't sell you
the fucking sweat
off my balls!

454
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,830
Is that right?
Yeah.

455
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,710
Watch it!

456
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,053
You're a fucking
dead man, Hatcher!
You hear me?

457
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,055
Yeah?
I'm fucking Jimmy Fingers!

458
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,765
I'm a made fucking man!

459
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,313
God made men.

460
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,779
All right, l want to know
where Screwface is.

461
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,323
Screwface?
Me don't know no Screwface.

462
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,076
Really?
That's strange.

463
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,538
Does that remind you?

464
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,123
You just shoot me now, man!

465
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,750
I got a better idea.
You're gonna go
for a ride with me.

466
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,752
And everybody's
gonna see us together

467
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:07,089
and Screwface
is gonna find out
what good buddies we are.

468
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,592
Come on.

469
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,471
Let's go! Let's go!

470
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,557
All right, man. All right!
Come on. Let's go!

471
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:22,396
Just, easy.
I will take you.

472
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,107
Good. l want to get there
while l'm still young.

473
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,943
Screwface give me
a thousand deaths
worse than you do.

474
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,236
Yeah?

475
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,529
Find him your fucking self!

476
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,058
Well?

477
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:04,688
One thought he was
invincible, the other
thought he could fly.

478
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,565
So?

479
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,066
They were both wrong.

480
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,491
OFFlCER: Go home.
Stay behind the line.

481
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,413
ROSELLl: l want to know
the second
that call comes in, okay?

482
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,040
So?

483
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,250
Two men are dead.
This one was shot
one time in the forehead.

484
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,878
The other one
was forced out
the window up there.

485
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,047
Did you find the hookers
who were in there?

486
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:33,508
Sal, do you honestly believe
that now is the time
for finding them hookers?

487
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:34,760
Look, this job
was done by a pro.

488
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:35,886
Oh, is that right?

489
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,805
That's right,
and l'll bet my money
it was John Hatcher.

490
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,474
Now find me something.

491
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,893
Sal, l will find
you something.

492
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,770
Look, he thinks
he can do things
his own way,

493
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,855
but l'll tell you something,
he can't.

494
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:51,318
Stay close to home, Charles.

495
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,404
Do it, man. Do it.

496
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,591
Where Nesta?

497
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,141
Jimmy Fingers
and Nesta
are not too good.

498
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,647
Nesta dead? Who do it?
The white boy Hatcher?

499
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:49,126
I want Hatcher dead!

500
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,630
I want his family dead!

501
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,718
And if you can't kill him,

502
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:02,973
l go kill him,
and then l go kill you.

503
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,401
What about protection
for my family?

504
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:57,944
They're assigned.

505
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,197
Good.

506
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,949
I should probably
have them tailing you.

507
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,160
What's that supposed to mean?

508
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,578
Where were you last night?

509
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,121
With a friend.

510
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,124
Stay retired.

511
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,111
Hello?

512
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,827
Hi. l'm John Hatcher.
I saw you the other night.

513
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,746
Yes, at the Shamrock.

514
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,331
Kind of need some help.

515
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,875
Hold on.
L'll be right down.

516
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,964
The ideogram is an African
black magic symbol.

517
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:02,592
It was used
by the Jamaican drug gang
the other night.

518
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,095
The FBl said l'd be
getting photos today.

519
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,514
I'm not
with the FBl,
you know.

520
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:12,394
Well, the cow's tongue
means you've talked

521
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,272
or exposed them
and have been
marked for death.

522
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,731
Where did you get these?

523
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:21,236
I got these
at my family's house
this morning.

524
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:26,032
What about this black cross?

525
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,285
This may seem
ridiculous
to you, Hatcher,

526
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,454
but these people
are for real.

527
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:33,123
Your family has been marked.

528
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,945
Could l use your phone
for a minute?

529
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,338
Yeah, sure.

530
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:55,562
Hello?

531
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,022
Yeah, it's me.
Is everything all right?

532
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,815
Yeah, Johnny, l'm fine.

533
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,234
I just got back
from the hospital.

534
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,613
Mom's there with Tracey.
She's better. She's stable.

535
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,698
I just had to come home
and get some rest.

536
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,982
Listen. Go look out
the window.
ls the guard still there?

537
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,662
Just a minute.

538
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:21,713
Yeah, the car's there,
but l don't see the guard.

539
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,469
Johnny? Johnny?

540
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,348
Oh, my God.

541
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,405
No! No!
Somebody help me!

542
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,450
- No! No!
- Come on!

543
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,370
What do you want?

544
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,579
I want you.

545
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:55,997
What do you want?

546
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,000
Just leave me alone.
Somebody's coming.

547
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,210
You're making a big mistake.

548
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,419
You're lying!

549
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:35,245
Stop the bloodclot crying.

550
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,581
Everybody must dead.

551
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,082
MELlSSA: No.

552
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,542
No, no.

553
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,503
It's your turn.

554
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:55,890
My father.

555
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,646
I and l go take you
to a place, you see,

556
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:05,525
far, far away.

557
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,361
You never been there before.

558
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,117
You go there now.

559
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,586
It's not your body
me want, no.

560
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,172
It's your dreams.

561
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,099
No, you bastard!

562
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,520
I own you now.

563
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,397
No!

564
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,316
Now l have the power!

565
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,001
Help me! Help me!
Johnny, help me!

566
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:20,225
He said...
He said he'd be back.
He said he'd kill us both.

567
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:24,646
Somehow, l don't think
he's gonna get the chance.

568
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,093
I can't wait
to nail this fucker.

569
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,345
This is gonna be fun.

570
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,681
Serious fun.

571
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,394
Time to have fun.

572
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,539
What's happening, bredda?

573
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:07,916
Lrie, irie.

574
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,709
You want some blow?

575
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:10,960
Yeah, l want some blow.

576
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,128
Put your hands
where l can see them

577
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,453
or l'm gonna blow
your head off.

578
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:16,216
Cool, now.
Keep a cool head, man.

579
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,967
See them here?
Right there. Right there.

580
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,219
Hatch!

581
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,457
Watch out!

582
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:33,645
Shit!

583
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,734
Take the right side!
Take the right side!

584
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,194
I got it! l got it!

585
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,950
Shit!

586
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,083
Say, boy! l'm gonna kill
your little bloodclot!

587
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:43,131
You are a bloodclot!

588
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:45,258
You are a bumbaclot.

589
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,095
You go, raas.

590
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,641
Help me, please!

591
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:54,726
Back off, boy!

592
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,227
Help me.
Me say back off!

593
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,396
You didn't hear me say?
You want her dead?

594
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,731
Go ahead. Kill her.

595
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,233
I don't know her.
I don't care about her.

596
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,693
I got you
where l want you now.

597
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,403
You're just like
a dog with no teeth.

598
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,863
You want to kill her,
kill her.

599
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,031
I don't mind
if you kill her,
you know,

600
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,365
'cause l don't
know her at all.

601
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,037
Yeah, bad boy.
Me a carve you,
now, boy.

602
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,872
Me a carve you.
Me a carve you.

603
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,582
Me a carve blood...

604
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,635
Run, dread, run!

605
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,605
What?
Didn't you see it?

606
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,899
From a bloodclot?
What run for?

607
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:46,235
A one white boy against
two bredda enough!

608
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,740
Let's kick
this little bloodclot
batty-hole, you see?

609
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:52,658
I ready. You ready?

610
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,077
Get him!

611
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,498
Hold on.
Hold on, now.

612
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:10,927
Tear you, raasclot!

613
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,826
You fuck with my family,
you die.

614
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,586
Now we're talking
serious fun.

615
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,296
Abso-fucking-lutely.

616
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,645
L've never met anyone
quite like you, Hatcher.

617
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:05,106
Let me tell you something.
Go down to any soup kitchen

618
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,441
and you're gonna find
a lot of guys
just like me.

619
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,651
Why a soup kitchen?

620
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,987
I'm just another
unemployed guy,
you know.

621
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,407
I don't think
there is a lot of guys
like you anywhere.

622
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,617
What's that supposed to mean?

623
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,037
I finally met a guy
who's nice,
not married, gay,

624
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:24,625
or trying to find himself,
and he's trying very hard
to get himself killed.

625
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:28,379
Well, l have some
unfinished business,
you know?

626
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:32,633
And l was hoping that
you'd maybe give me
some of your advice.

627
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,844
What are you planning to do?

628
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,721
I want to take out the posse.

629
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,559
Then destroy their system.

630
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,643
When Screwface kills,

631
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,688
he wants everyone
to see he did it
or know that he ordered it.

632
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,524
That way he's both
feared and worshiped.

633
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:54,030
You'd have to kill him,
so the posse thinks
you've taken his power.

634
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,866
That way they will believe
your magic is bigger.

635
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,953
Otherwise, they'll
never stop until
you and your family are dead.

636
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,101
I want you to meet my sister.

637
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,107
Goddess of fire.

638
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,997
Come on, God damn it!

639
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,175
Yeah, well, this is
what you ordered.

640
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,928
Do you want
anything else?
Wires, surveillance?

641
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,055
No. Just firearms
this time.

642
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,181
Okay, you got it.

643
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,933
For you.
Thank you.

644
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,353
You still sober?

645
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,688
Yeah, five years, man.
One day at a time.

646
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,817
Stay away from that Nembutal.
You got it.

647
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,619
Hang on. Hang on.

648
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,344
Max, meet Charles.
Charles, meet Max.

649
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:55,688
Man, l've been
after Screwface for
five long years, you see?

650
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,232
I have followed him
from Kingston to here.

651
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,900
All around!

652
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,652
You break my heart, man.

653
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,946
Your tactics
are just making him
tougher to snatch up.

654
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,115
Him jump already, you know.

655
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:13,205
And it's only l
who can guide you
to what it is you seek.

656
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,376
I don't know if that
would be a very wise
career move for you.

657
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,295
Come on!
Look close!

658
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:22,047
Who you think
me work for, the DEA?

659
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,718
I'm a Jamaican cop, man,
and Screwface is my career!

660
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,386
Look, man,
l don't really care
who you work for.

661
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,805
You got your reasons
and l got mine.

662
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,523
Screwface has gone
back to Jamaica.

663
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:49,783
You know, Charles,
sometimes
three's not a crowd.

664
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,579
Way l look at it,
we need each other.

665
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,915
Hmm.
Know what l mean?

666
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,884
Let's do it, man.

667
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:03,816
How you doing?
Okay.

668
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,359
Care package.

669
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,617
Uncle Sam's contribution?

670
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,371
Welfare for warfare,
you know.

671
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,437
This is my silent partner.

672
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:45,608
A whisper in your ear
from this girl
goes a long way,

673
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,151
you know what l'm saying?

674
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,500
You guys didn't
hear a thing, did you?

675
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,669
All right, you heard
the slide
click a little, right?

676
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:07,379
Massive cool.

677
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:10,132
Forward, Jamaica.

678
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:29,902
I work day and night
to find my daily needs

679
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:36,241
Freedom is suppressed
by another one's greed

680
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:43,040
Why should certain ones
control another one's needs?

681
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:49,672
It's rebellion this kind
of action breeds

682
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:55,260
l can't get no justice
under this system

683
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,597
l can't get me no justice

684
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,767
ln this society

685
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:09,108
These are the streets
that breed the Screwfaces
of the world.

686
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,068
This is the first time
l ever got the idea

687
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,946
it's not all sunshine
and bikinis.

688
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,531
I owe you an apology, man,

689
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:18,951
because until today
l thought all Jamaicans
were dope-dealing dreads.

690
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,995
No, man. Don't feel
you have to apologize
for nothing, man.

691
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,914
Man, these streets
are hard out here,

692
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,959
and some people
make a bad choice,
that's all.

693
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:29,169
They say life is hard.

694
01:07:56,114 --> 01:08:00,576
I can't get no justice
in this society

695
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:07,916
l can't get me no justice
under this system

696
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,091
What up, man?
Nothing now.

697
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:17,843
What you doing
all the way up here?

698
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,138
You're not having
enough trouble
in Kingston, peace boy?

699
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,849
Back with country, boy.
You do your duty?

700
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,144
Pay him.

701
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,320
This girl, she hang
with Screwface more time.

702
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,614
They always
partying together.

703
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,574
Can usually find
her at Cat Club.

704
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:44,953
Heebie-jeebie, wicked boy
your time has come

705
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,248
You don't live right
you will have no more fun

706
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:52,711
Jankrow a go nyam

707
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:56,298
Jankrow a go
lead the children astray

708
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,760
Jankrow a go
meet the retribution

709
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:03,347
Justice has
finally find a way

710
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:09,144
Screwface, you know
that your time has come

711
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:12,731
You don't do right,
you gonna dead tonight

712
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:16,360
So now a go take you down
the road to doom

713
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:20,072
And, jankrow, a go nyam

714
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:24,076
Jankrow a go nyam

715
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,496
Jankrow a go
lead the children astray

716
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:31,166
Jankrow a go
meet the retribution

717
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:35,045
Justice has
finally find the way

718
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:41,176
Are you worried
it's just a wolf
in sheep's clothing

719
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:44,638
Trying to lead
the children astray?

720
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:48,350
But don't you know
our 'ope it brighten?

721
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,937
Take my hands,
l will show you the way

722
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,274
Jankrow a go nyam
your supper soon, boy

723
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:59,027
Jankrow a go

724
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:02,406
Jankrow a go

725
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:06,326
Justice has
finally find a way

726
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,913
Screwface?

727
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,668
Road to doom.

728
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:18,213
Sounds like you know
this guy pretty well.

729
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:21,133
Yeah, l know him.
I partied with him.

730
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:24,386
I don't care him
sell the drugs.

731
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,305
It's part of doing business.

732
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,891
But my sister,

733
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,560
she lost a shipment,
and him cut her dead.

734
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:36,148
And for that,
somehow, someday,
him a go dust off.

735
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,735
Yeah, so why don't
you just tell me
what l gotta know,

736
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,486
and l'll go do
what l gotta do?

737
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:49,912
Screwface have
two head and four eyes.

738
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:53,290
And that is the secret
to his magic.

739
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:32,037
Look upon this madman.

740
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:37,709
Him dead and
him don't even know it.

741
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:12,400
Get away from the window!

742
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,265
I got it! l got it!
Don't worry. l got it!

743
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,945
Welcome to l island.

744
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,781
Fuck you.

745
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,493
You a woman?

746
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:30,789
Me know what you is.
You is a dog
after a bone!

747
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,249
And you have no teeth!

748
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,303
Hold him!

749
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:46,805
Tie him down.

750
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:01,444
You was conceived
in darkness.

751
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:07,283
But l going deliver you
into the light.

752
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,131
I got him!
I got him!

753
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,054
Get up!

754
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:10,722
I know you.
You love the killing.

755
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,559
But you is
an empty shell inside.

756
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,125
Fall out.

757
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:42,253
Charles, move out.

758
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:13,243
So, bred, tell me
one more time.

759
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,537
Did you tell them
exactly
what l told you to?

760
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:18,373
I told them exactly
what you told me
to tell them. Yes.

761
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:19,541
And what did they say?

762
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,752
They said exactly
what you said
they was going to say.

763
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,629
Is that right?
And what was that?

764
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,839
"Business
is business, man."

765
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,050
$1 0.

766
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:31,719
It ain't over yet.

767
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,264
Does this guy
ever pay you on time?

768
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:39,621
So, who's the boss-man?

769
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,539
I man.

770
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:44,584
Thanks for taking
this meeting, man.
l got a message for you.

771
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:46,461
Screwface is dead.

772
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:48,171
You raasclot stupid.

773
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,883
Hey, anybody ever see this?

774
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,346
Screwface is dead!

775
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,057
Now you get the fuck
out of town or die!

776
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:02,644
You must want me
and my bumbaclot posse
to shoot you down, boy.

777
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,070
Dead and about to be buried.

778
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,740
The evil is demolished!

779
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:22,038
L'll give you guys
till tomorrow or you die.

780
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,838
Don't even think about it.

781
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:44,227
- Magic man!
- Screwface no dead!

782
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,231
- Screwface no dead!
- Magic man back!
