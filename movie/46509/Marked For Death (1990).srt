1
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,460
Did you talk to anyone?
Look at me. Talk to anybody?

2
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,260
Did you see anybody?
Did you talk to anybody, huh?

3
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,590
Did you make a phone call?

4
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:43,850
Who did you talk to?

5
00:02:02,275 --> 00:01:59,570
You got anything else to say?

6
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,740
l didn't think so.

7
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,870
- How long was he out of your sight?
- Maybe a couple of minutes.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,710
Chico, l'm disappointed in you!
How could you do that?

9
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:16,920
We can't go into that meeting.
lf anyone was ever made, we were made.

10
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:19,633
You know what l say? We're goin'.

11
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:25,180
What are you? Are you crazy? Probably
a hundred people saw us chasing him.

12
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:31,019
Chico, since when did anybody
ever accuse me of being sane?

13
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:35,065
- We're goin'. All right? Come on.
- Jesus Christ!

14
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:43,925
- You see anything strange?
- Just the usual weirdness.

15
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:51,308
The deal's goin' down, man.

16
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:56,521
- Keep an eye out for me, huh?
- Right, Hatcher.

17
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:01,735
- Are you sure it's cool?
- lt's very cool. Relax.

18
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,821
- Good. Then let's go.
- Bueno.

19
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:08,783
And the next time, you're gonna
introduce me to Salazar, aren't you?

20
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,912
Yes, l promise. You got it.

21
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,668
No traigo dinero. No tengo dinero.

22
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:21,463
No tengo dinero. No traigo.

23
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:27,636
Bien. Bien, primo.

24
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,765
Here we are, gentlemen. Right on time.

25
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,644
You see, l told you.
This guy, he's been a good customer.

26
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:41,399
- Did you bring the green?
- Of course. l got it right here.

27
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,572
Half.

28
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:50,367
- Then what are you here for?
- To do business.

29
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:53,161
lf you don't like that, then l'll take off.

30
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:56,498
Cįlmate. Cįlmate, primo.

31
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:59,668
You know somethin'?
l do business for a long time.

32
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:03,755
You know why? Cos l'm careful.
You can never be too careful, right?

33
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:07,884
Careful is good with me, amigo.
Careful never killed nobody.

34
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:10,804
- ls that right?
- Stupid.

35
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:14,766
Stupid kills. Me entiendes?
OK, gringo. l think we can do business.

36
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:17,269
Good. Then let's get it over with.

37
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:20,021
Hey. How ya doin'?

38
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,869
Hey, Colonel!

39
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,638
You know, in our country... we love cops.

40
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:58,393
And when we do a cop,
it's like a tremendous status symbol.

41
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:03,565
But an American cop is like a gift from God.

42
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,526
My little friend
is gonna open you up a little bit

43
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:10,572
so you can tell us where
the rest of the money is, huh?

44
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:14,576
- There is no more money.
- There's gotta be more money.

45
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:29,799
Hatcher, let's get the hell
outta here! Come on!

46
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:33,720
Cover me!

47
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,806
- lt's clear!
- Let's go!

48
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:37,766
OK!

49
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:57,744
Por favor, no mįs.

50
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,138
Hatch!

51
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,269
Time to go, Hatch.

52
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,388
l knew the only justice l could get

53
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:02,767
would be that that l made for myself -
not always by law.

54
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:07,105
Father... l just killed a woman.

55
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,361
l've lied, l've slept with informants,

56
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:17,199
l've taken drugs, l've falsified evidence.

57
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:20,911
l did whatever l had to do to get the bad guys.

58
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,832
And then l realised somethin'.

59
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:30,879
That l had become what l most despise.

60
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,550
- Do you have a family?
- Yes, Father.

61
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:39,137
Go to them and leave these things.

62
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:44,518
Try to find the gentle self inside you.
Allow this person to come back.

63
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:54,653
Well, what are you
going to retire to, Hatcher?

64
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:57,614
You're up to your neck in this life.

65
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:02,661
l got Bennett burning up
the phone lines every day.

66
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:07,249
l got the president going on television -
promising results, for Christ's sake.

67
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,460
This is not the time for you
to walk out on me. Not now.

68
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,255
- You can't!
- l've had enough.

69
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:18,510
Look, John...

70
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,473
There was nothing
you could have done to save Chico.

71
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:27,978
These things happen when you're in deep.
You know that. Take a leave.

72
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,938
With pay.

73
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:34,234
Hell, take a month. Take two.
You've felt burned out before this.

74
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,945
l need you, John, OK?

75
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:44,119
Pete, nothin' we ever did
amounted to shit, and you know it.

76
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:41,134
- Who is it?
- Uncle John.

77
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,433
You're not my uncle.
My Uncle John lives far away.

78
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:52,270
l am your uncle.
And you've grown up to be a big girl.

79
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:56,191
You allergic to cats?

80
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:58,735
- Nope.
- OK. Then you can come in.

81
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,321
Tracey, come on back...

82
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:03,657
Johnny?

83
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:07,661
- Johnny! l can't believe it.
- How's my little sister?

84
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,254
- Boys, say hello to your Uncle John.
- Who's this?

85
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,382
- This is Ricky.
- Ricky, how ya doin'? You look great.

86
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:25,262
- You look good. Everything's all right?
- Yeah. Everything's great.

87
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:28,431
- Hey, how you doin'?
- All right. Welcome home.

88
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:32,227
- Where you been?
- l've been here waitin' for you.

89
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:38,441
You're home!

90
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:44,072
Let me look at you. Oh, you look great.

91
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:47,701
You look great.
You look like Melissa now. 20 years younger.

92
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:53,165
Thank you. l accept all compliments
from handsome men. Everything all right?

93
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:57,335
- You sounded strange on the phone.
- lt's all right. l'm just a little tired.

94
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,046
You've come to the right place to rest.

95
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:05,172
Head up!

96
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,812
- Cool!
- Make you 'appy?

97
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:24,232
We have lots more
where dat come from, yuh know.

98
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:27,527
Don't worry about it. Be 'appy!

99
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,780
- Ready?
- Break!

100
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:37,579
Let's go! Let's go!

101
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:41,124
Come up to the play!

102
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:44,628
Play it again! One more time!
Harris, you're a failure!

103
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:49,132
Tackling 10 yards down the field ain't shit!
Pardon my French. Get back in the huddle!

104
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:52,928
- Come on! Let's go!
- Coach! Coach, put me in!

105
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:56,306
Put me in.

106
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:59,684
l'll be damned.

107
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,979
- Trouble.
- That's me.

108
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:10,820
- l heard you were shot dead in Bangkok.
- Well, l was in Bangkok. l was there.

109
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:14,199
But l didn't get shot,
if that's all right with you.

110
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:16,368
Hell, yeah!

111
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:24,417
- Coach, we're ready!
- Be right back. Show him you can play ball!

112
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:28,421
You know, if you like dat,

But you don't waan' try dis. lt too tough.

118
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:50,277
Women, it make dem wan' love

- l'll try it.
- Sure ting, pretty girl.

120
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:55,907
Go on. Put it right up to your lips. You ready?

121
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:59,536
- Break!
- Four laps, then hit the showers!

122
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,790
You were gone so long
you missed my marriage.

123
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:06,793
- How was it?
- Cambodia was more fun.

124
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:10,130
l love giving away my possessions!
lt makes me feel spiritual.

125
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:12,382

lt's all right. Let's go.

127
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:33,987
Get in the car. Get in the car.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

128
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:27,707
Tito Barco, we're glad you come
to show some respect.

129
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:31,044
Walk up.

130
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:37,425
- Check him clean.
- Cool.

131
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:40,011
Do your best, man.

132
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:45,016
Deja.

133
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:51,690
You very funny, man.

00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:57,529
Wait 'ere for de man.

Forward.

136
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,475
You move into my territory.
What do you think l'm going to do?

137
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:30,812
The streets will be red with blood,
and nobody makes money.

138
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:35,650
They don't even notice us.
We fit in. We look like them.

139
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:42,657
But you... you go marching into the suburbs
with your rag-head soldiers,

140
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,202
and we're front-page news.

141
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:49,789
The DEA will be crawling down our throats
long after you've gone!

142
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:52,876
Everybody waan' go heaven,

143
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:56,546
but nobody want dead.

144
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,634
Afraid?

145
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,276
Dis is how it a go.

146
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:22,155

You... a do the sellin'.

l supply the crack and the powder.

150
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:37,879
- What's the split?
- 20 per cent

151
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:40,298
to you.

152
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:50,767
Give me some time
to consider your proposition.

153
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:54,729
l will give you an answer very soon.

154
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:58,066
l'll wait

155
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:00,110
and watch.

156
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:03,321
l an' l see everyting.

157
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:08,201
l an' l be everywhere.

158
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:24,593
The santero told me that you are the one
with the most frightening power,

159
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:27,304
that you are the one l must see.

160
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:41,860
This man is not only Abakua -
the leopard people -

161
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:44,029
..pero también es maijumbero.

162
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,115
Muy malo.

163
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,911
This man is using the power of the spirits

164
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:53,497
to do very evil things.

165
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:57,918
Will you... will you help me?

166
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,672
Aquķ es el derecho.

167
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:12,390
l hope to see you again.

168
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,227
Adiós.

169
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:50,470
Ven, gallito. Tranquilo.

170
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:53,265
Te necesito para mi trabajo.

171
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:55,392
Ven, gallito.

172
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:38,476
Acepta la sangre de este gallo que te ofrezco

173
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:43,064
y ayśdame a deshacerme
de este hombre malo.

174
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:52,324
Gallo, te mato por tu sangre.

175
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:28,902
- Looks good.
- Mm-hm.

176
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:31,947
Nice to be back. Your team looks great.

177
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:37,702
Well, it looks good now. Last year
one of my best players OD'd on cocaine.

178
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:42,332
l remember when the worst problem to worry
about was one of them knockin' up some girl.

179
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:45,335
- Not any more.
- l think l remember this place.

180
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,297
Wasn't this the place
where all the ugly girls worked?

181
00:23:56,721 --> 00:24:01,226
- Hey, Nurse! Got an emergency here!
- Call a doctor!

182
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:04,729
Listen, give me a beer,
and give my man here a double.

183
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:09,317
- l don't do doubles on the first date.
- Now, that's not what l heard!

184
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,572
- This is my boy Hatch.
- Hi, Hatch.

185
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,621
- Tiene miedo?
- No.

186
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,791
Bien. Yo tampoco.

187
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:30,338
- We're goin'in.
- OK.

188
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:50,025
- Some hormones in here.
- Oh, yeah.

189
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:04,039
Looks like one of the locals is doin'
some dealing. Supplementin' his income.

190
00:25:04,164 --> 00:25:09,085
- Leave it alone, man. Leave it alone.
- He's buyin' dope from the Jamaicans

191
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:12,923
- and sellin' it to his friends.
- l've been all over the world with this.

192
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:17,552
- lt ain'tjust the Jamaicans. lt's everybody.
- That's the same guy l saw by the school.

193
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:21,765
And every time l see somethin' goin' down,
l see him. There he is.

194
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:36,947
Last month, my 13-year-old nephew died

195
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:40,784
in a crack house run by these guys.
That cut it for me.

196
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:43,161
- l'm sorry.
- Look, l've had it!

197
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:47,165
And now it seems
they're movin' in down here.

198
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,752
- l'm just waitin' to do somethin'.
- Let me tell you somethin'.

199
00:25:50,877 --> 00:25:55,549
There's nothin' you can do about it
and there never was, all right?

200
00:25:56,216 --> 00:26:01,179
But you gotta try to protect your own, or
are you so burnt out you can't relate to that?

201
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:03,181
No. l can relate to that.

202
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:15,777
Excuse me.

203
00:26:32,586 --> 00:26:34,754
Blood and fire!

204
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:47,601
Go!

205
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:55,525
Move out! Move out!

206
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:59,696
Come on! Call an ambulance!

207
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:10,999
Hey, bwoy! Somebody about dead tonight!

208
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:13,043
Raas, what do you...?

209
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:17,631
Me no know you, but l promise you
you is a dead man walkin'!

210
00:27:17,756 --> 00:27:19,758
So what else is new?

211
00:27:34,356 --> 00:27:37,150
Give us some room here! Come on, let's go.

212
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,906
Let's clear the area. Clear that area.

213
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,875
You're dead, bwoy! Yuh hear? Dead!

214
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:57,712
- Welcome home.
- ls that the suspect, Mr Hatcher?

215
00:27:57,838 --> 00:28:00,257
Yeah, the first guy up there.

216
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:04,094
All right. Watch it, people.
Stay back behind the line.

217
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:07,055
Like Los Angeles,
New York, and Washington,

218
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,308
small-town America
now has blood in its streets,

219
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:14,688
as a gang shoot-out in Lincoln Heights
tonight has left four dead.

220
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:18,608
Although less than one per cent
of Jamaican immigrants are involved,

221
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:23,488
Jamaican gangs, known as posses, are
now dominating the American drug trade,

222
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:27,742
with more than 10,000 members
trafficking drugs in 20 states.

223
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:33,290
According to Justice Department officials,
they are as disciplined as they are violent.

224
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:35,959
Torture and maiming are posse trademarks,

225
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:40,255
and posse gunmen are said to prefer
shooting their victims in public.

226
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,427
Sources estimate they have committed
1400 murders in three and a half years.

227
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:49,181
Dale Harimoto, WXTV, Chicago.

228
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:51,850
- Stay back. Watch it.
- Sheriff O'Dwyer.

229
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:59,316
- l'm Sheriff O'Dwyer. Who might you be?
- Roselli. FBl, OC task force.

230
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:01,902
- We're taking over here.
- By what authority?

231
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:05,197
United States Government Code,
Title 18, Section 111.

232
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:09,701
Go get their statements.
Keep the looky-loos out of the crime scene.

233
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:13,121
- You're excused, Sheriff.
- Roselli, l won't forget this.

234
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:18,919
You and your agents so much as spit on
the deck, and l'll personally write the citation.

235
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:24,549
Hatcher! Jesus Christ!
What the hell are you doin' back here?

236
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:29,012
Thought l'd visit my mother, you know?
l'm retired now.

237
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:32,349
Retired, huh? Well, that's cosy.
What the hell went down?

238
00:29:32,474 --> 00:29:36,394
Gee, l don't know. What does it look like?
lt's a shoot-out... Colombians...

239
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,523
- What do you want me to say?
- Probably Tito Barco's clan.

240
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:45,445
- What would Tito Barco be doing up this far?
- Losing. The turf is spreading out, Hatcher.

241
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:50,242
The Jamaican posse's more organised than
the others. They got more guns, more balls.

242
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,744
Jimmy Fingers is giving them everything.

243
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:56,331
Jimmy Fingers...
ex-casino man out of Atlantic City.

244
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:59,417
That's a piece of cake.
You pop him, you got it.

245
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:02,796
- Why don't you help us out on this one?
- Cos l'm out.

246
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:07,676
- Come on, Hatcher. lt's in the blood.
- lf it's in the blood, l'll get a transfusion.

247
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:12,764
Lieutenant, may l see yuh for a moment? The
professor has found something interesting.

248
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:16,685
- Charles, how ya doin'?
- We'll see you around, Hatcher.

249
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,313
- The sign on de wall is Abakua.
- More of this voodoo bullshit?

250
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:23,650
Professor, you call the markings
on de wall voodoo bullshit?

251
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:27,529
Nope. l've seen them in New York,
Los Angeles and now here.

252
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:33,243
Sal, dis is no bullshit, man. Those markings
were put dere by a man named Screwface.

253
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:36,079
Know what it means
when we say a man's face is screwed?

254
00:30:36,204 --> 00:30:40,125
- No.
- Well, l pray you never have to find that out.

255
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,460
Who's that?

256
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:47,382
lt's John Hatcher. He was an undercover
troubleshooter for the DEA.

257
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:51,720
- We worked together a couple of years ago.
- l know him. Him comin' in wid us?

258
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:54,014
No. He thinks he's retired.

259
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:57,017
He still looks functional to me.

260
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:24,503
l have a message for you

261
00:31:25,128 --> 00:31:27,130
from Tito!

262
00:31:27,464 --> 00:31:30,967
Him say meet him in hell!

263
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:23,144
- Dem let you out?
- No jail can hold me

264
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,231
- when Jimmy Fingers is on my side.
- Same.

265
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:29,025
Jimmy Fingers.

266
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:33,071
Give t'anks for
bringin' out my bredren. Same?

267
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:37,784
Bondsman knew he was gonna skip,
so l figured l'd throw him a little extra.

268
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:41,413
- Monkey, time for business.
- Let's take care o' dis.

269
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:43,582
Come.

270
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:09,024
No, man. l just think
you have to take it one step at a time.

271
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:18,408
Nobody. Yuh know what l'm sayin'?
Me notjokin', bwoy.

272
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:21,036
Yes, man. Yes. Hold on. Hold on.

273
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:25,457
Listen up, you see?
Our provider, the man of science, a come!

274
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:27,417
All right!

275
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:30,754
Dreadlocks, Monkey be wid us again.
Dat no good?

276
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:31,755
Yeah!

277
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,341
And the magic be everywhere.

278
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:38,929
The warriors... Conquerors!

279
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:43,517
Respec'. The Almighty
has given l an' l his hand.

280
00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:45,852
His rod of correction l hold.

281
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:52,567
Let no man here fear for his own life!

282
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:57,739
Dem dat wish l an' l
to be left in poverty and squalor

283
00:33:57,864 --> 00:34:00,116
will demselves be damned!

284
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,748
lf a man commit a crime against you,

285
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:12,963
he must be paid back a t'ousand times!

286
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:18,426
Who you fear?

287
00:34:19,427 --> 00:34:23,181
Him... or me?

288
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:36,236
Let no man here steer
from de path l 'ave prepared!

289
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:45,120
Dem de streets out dere
belong to you now!

290
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:51,668
- Take it.
- Yeah!

291
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,628
Take it!

292
00:34:54,296 --> 00:34:56,339
Take it!

293
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:59,217
- Come.
- Yes.

294
00:35:04,764 --> 00:35:09,394
l still don't believe you. lf you don't see
the shit that's happening around us,

295
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,814
- you're blind or you don't wanna see.
- Maybe l've seen enough.

296
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:17,444
- l don't think the world wants to change.
- Look, things do change, man.

297
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:22,240
lt's like you see this big dam with a leak
in it. You plug it with your finger.

298
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:27,370
Soon you see more holes. You plug it with
your other fingers, your toes, your tongue.

299
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:30,540
But the water keeps on gushing out.
That's the way it is.

300
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:32,918
Pretty soon, you quit or get killed.

301
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:36,796
Five days later, they got
some shitbird cherry to take your place,

302
00:35:36,922 --> 00:35:39,591
they give him your shield,
and you're forgotten.

303
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:43,929
The way l look at it, you come home, mind
your own business, watch your own yard.

304
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:48,141
And then, if trouble finds you,
you go after it and you bite its head off

305
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:50,852
before it does the same thing to you.

306
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:54,898
Look, Hatch,
you haven't been here in a long time,

307
00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:59,611
and l'm telling you, trouble is tapping us
both on the shoulder right now,

308
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:04,324
- and you don't want to turn around.
- Well, l hope you're wrong.

309
00:36:07,285 --> 00:36:11,373
- You look a little winded there, big guy.
- Gimme a break. l'm on vacation.

310
00:36:11,498 --> 00:36:13,458
Tracey has something to show you.
She's been waiting.

311
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:39,860
Get down!

312
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,711
Johnny!

313
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:02,507
They hurt my baby!

314
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:22,986
Tracey is in serious condition,
and she's unstable.

315
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:26,907
There's pressure on the brain
that we'll have to relieve.

316
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:31,453
- Well, what does that mean?
- Surgery. l can't give you a prognosis.

317
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:34,873
She's fighting for her life, and so are we.

318
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:44,174
Doc, you treat this girl like she's
the president of the United States.

319
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:48,261
- Money isn't a consideration.
- We treat all of our patients exactly...

320
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:53,141
Let me tell you somethin'.
Like the president of the United States, OK?

321
00:37:57,437 --> 00:38:00,398
Don't touch me, John. Don't touch me.

322
00:38:00,524 --> 00:38:04,778
This is your fault.
Do you understand? This is your fault.

323
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:08,156
God damn you! God damn you!

324
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:11,743
This is your fault! And my baby...

325
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:13,912
My baby...

326
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:35,619
- Jimmy, how ya doin'?
- Hatch, what the fuck are you doin' here?

327
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:40,248
Why don't you guys take a hike?
Go find another trick, all right?

328
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:46,004
You bailed out a Jamaican, street name
Monkey, the other day. l want him.

329
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:49,341
This other piece of shit - Screwface -
l want him.

330
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:52,135
You're a scumbag and a puke.
l don't mind that.

331
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,639
Gimme what l need, l leave here a nice guy.
You don't, l fuck you up.

332
00:39:55,764 --> 00:39:58,475
You fuckin' know better than that, Hatcher.

333
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:05,190
Come here. l just wanna talk to you
for a minute. Come here.

334
00:40:06,483 --> 00:40:10,320
The Mob throws you out of Atlantic City.
Now you sell guns to the Jamaicans.

335
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:15,283
Fuckin' sell anything to anybody, except you.
Wouldn't sell you the sweat off my balls!

336
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:17,160
- ls that right?
- Yeah.

337
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:22,249
Watch it!

338
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,174
- You're a fuckin' dead man, Hatcher!
- Yeah?

339
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:34,719
l'm fuckin' Jimmy Fingers!
l'm a made fuckin' man!

340
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:42,227
God made men.

341
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:48,316
l wanna know where Screwface is.

342
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:52,612
- Screwface? Me don't know no Screwface.
- Really?

343
00:40:52,737 --> 00:40:54,197
Hm. That's strange.

344
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:58,952
- Does that remind you?
- Just shoot me now, man!

345
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:01,746
l got a better idea. We're gonna go for a ride.

346
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:07,836
Everybody's gonna see us, and Screwface
is gonna find out what good buddies we are.

347
00:41:08,753 --> 00:41:10,463
Come on.

348
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:16,678
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, man! All right!

349
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:21,892
Just easy. l will take you.

350
00:41:22,017 --> 00:41:24,769
Good. l wanna get there while l'm still young.

351
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:27,898
Screwface kill me
a t'ousand deaths worse dan you.

352
00:41:28,023 --> 00:41:31,443
- Yeah?
- Find him your fuckin' self!

353
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:00,847
Well?

354
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:04,935
One thought he was invincible.
The other thought he could fly.

355
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,687
- So?
- They were both wrong.

356
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:21,660
l wanna know the second
that call comes in, OK?

357
00:42:21,743 --> 00:42:22,869
So?

358
00:42:22,994 --> 00:42:27,833
Two dead. Dis one was shot in de forehead.
De other one was forced out de window.

359
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:30,001
Did you find the hookers?

360
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:33,171
Do you honestly believe
now is the time for findin' them?

361
00:42:33,255 --> 00:42:35,632
- This job was done by a pro.
- ls that right?

362
00:42:35,757 --> 00:42:40,262
That's right, and l'll bet my money
it was John Hatcher. Find me somethin'.

363
00:42:40,387 --> 00:42:44,516
- Sal, l will find you somethin'.
- He thinks he can do things his own way,

364
00:42:44,641 --> 00:42:47,853
but l'll tell you something - he can't.

365
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:51,314
Stay close to home, Charles.

366
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:54,818
Do it, man. Do it.

367
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:15,422
Where Nesta?

368
00:43:20,927 --> 00:43:25,056
Jimmy Fingers and Nesta are not too good.

369
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:28,643
Nesta dead? Who do it?
De white boy Hatcher?

370
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:49,039
l want... Hatcher dead!

371
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:53,502
l want his family dead!

372
00:43:55,462 --> 00:43:58,381
And if you cannot kill him,

373
00:43:58,507 --> 00:44:01,301
l go kill him!

374
00:44:01,384 --> 00:44:03,887
And then l go kill you.

375
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:58,525
- What about protection for my family?
- They're assigned.

376
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,070
- Good.
- l should probably have them tailing you.

377
00:45:03,154 --> 00:45:06,491
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Where were you last night?

378
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:08,660
With a friend.

379
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:11,913
Stay retired.

380
00:45:37,772 --> 00:45:39,816
Hello?

381
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:46,698
Hi. l'm John Hatcher.
l saw you the other night.

382
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:51,328
- Yes. At the Shamrock.
- l kind of need some help.

383
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,331
Hold on. l'll be right down.

384
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,919
lt's an African black magic symbol.

385
00:45:59,044 --> 00:46:02,464
lt was used by the Jamaican
drug gang the other night.

386
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:07,219
- The FBl said l'd be getting photos today.
- l'm not with the FBl, you know.

387
00:46:09,137 --> 00:46:13,016
Well... the cow's tongue means
you've talked or exposed them,

388
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:16,561
and have been marked for death.
Where did you get these?

389
00:46:16,728 --> 00:46:21,274
l got these...
at my family's house this morning.

390
00:46:23,735 --> 00:46:26,404
What about this black cross?

391
00:46:26,488 --> 00:46:30,825
This may seem ridiculous to you,
Hatcher, but these people are for real.

392
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:33,411
Your family has been marked.

393
00:46:37,457 --> 00:46:41,211
- Could l use your phone for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

394
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:56,810
- Hello?
- lt's me. ls everything all right?

395
00:46:56,935 --> 00:47:01,064
Yeah, Johnny. l'm fine.
l just got back here from the hospital.

396
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:04,609
Mom's there with Tracey.
She's better. She's stable.

397
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:09,823
- l just had to come home and get some rest.
- Go look out the window. ls the guard there?

398
00:47:09,948 --> 00:47:12,409
Um, waitjust a minute.

399
00:47:18,165 --> 00:47:21,585
Yeah. The car's there,
but, uh, l don't see the guard.

400
00:47:23,879 --> 00:47:25,672
Johnny?

401
00:47:26,673 --> 00:47:27,591
Johnny!

402
00:47:30,051 --> 00:47:32,095
My God.

403
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:48,904
Somebody help me!

404
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:54,367
- What do you want?!
- l want you.

405
00:47:54,492 --> 00:47:58,788
What do you want? Just leave me alone.
Somebody's coming.

406
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:02,042
- You're making a big mistake.
- You're lying!

407
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:35,283
Stop the blood claat cryin'.

Everybody must dead!

409

00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:20,222
He said... He said he'd be back.
He said he'd kill us both.

423
00:50:20,972 --> 00:50:24,851
Somehow, l don't think
he's gonna get the chance.

424

l can't wait to nail this fucker.

00:57:32,112 --> 00:57:34,656
You fuck with my family and you die.

455
00:57:43,748 --> 00:57:48,170
- Now we're talking serious fun, man.
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

456
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:02,809
l've never met anyone quite like you, Hatcher.

457
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:07,147
Go down to any soup kitchen,
you're gonna find a lot of guys just like me.

458
00:58:07,272 --> 00:58:10,901
- Why a soup kitchen?
- l'm just another unemployed guy.

459
00:58:11,026 --> 00:58:14,446
l don't think there is a lot of guys
like you anywhere.

460
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:17,282
What's that supposed to mean?

461
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:21,369
l've met a guy who is nice, not married,
gay, or trying to find himself,

462
00:58:21,495 --> 00:58:24,915
and he's trying very hard
to get himself killed.

463
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,502
Well, l have some
unfinished business, you know,

464
00:58:28,627 --> 00:58:32,130
and l was hoping that you'd maybe
give me some of your advice.

465
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:36,635
- What are you planning to do?
- l'm gonna take out the posse.

466
00:58:39,471 --> 00:58:41,431
Then destroy their system.

467
00:58:41,556 --> 00:58:45,519
When Screwface kills he wants
everyone to see he did it, or ordered it.

468
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:48,730
That way he's both feared and worshipped.

469
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,944
You'd have to kill him so the posse
thinks you've taken his power.

470
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:56,738
That way they will believe
your magic is bigger.

471
00:58:56,863 --> 00:59:01,743
Otherwise they'll never stop
until you and your family are dead.

472
01:00:44,596 --> 01:00:46,932
l want you to meet my sister.

473
01:00:50,977 --> 01:00:53,313
Goddess of fire.

474
01:01:59,462 --> 01:02:03,717
This is what you ordered. Do you want
anything else? Wires? Surveillance?

475
01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:07,012
- No. Just firearms this time.
- OK. You got it.

476
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:09,181
- For you.
- Thank you.

477
01:02:11,183 --> 01:02:15,687
- You still sober?
- Five years, man. One day at a time.

478
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:17,772
Stay away from that dope.

479
01:02:27,157 --> 01:02:29,201
Hang on. Hang on.

480
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:45,467
Max, meet Charles. Charles, meet Max.

481
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:55,435
Man, l been after Screwface
for five long years, yuh see?

482
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,731
l have followed him
from Kingston to here. All around.

483
01:02:59,856 --> 01:03:03,652
- You break my heart.
- Your tactic is makin' him tougher to snatch.

484
01:03:03,777 --> 01:03:06,238
Him jump already, yuh know?

485
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:13,119
An' it's only l... who can guide you
to what it is yuh seek.

486
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:17,040
l don't know if that'd be
a wise career move for you.

487
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:21,753
Come on! Look close!
Who you think me work for? The DEA?

488
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:25,048
l'm a Jamaican cop, man,
and Screwface is my career!

489
01:03:25,423 --> 01:03:30,971
Look, man. l don't really care who you work
for. You got your reasons and l got mine.

490
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:39,729
Screwface has gone back to Jamaica.

491
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:48,321
You know, Charles, sometimes

492
01:03:48,446 --> 01:03:50,657
three's not a crowd.

493
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:53,493
The way l look at it, we need each other.

494
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:56,371
Know what l mean?

495
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,007
Let's do it, man.

496
01:05:02,562 --> 01:05:05,023
How ya doin'? Care package.

497
01:05:11,488 --> 01:05:13,949
Uncle Sam's contribution?

498
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:17,202
Welfare for warfare, yuh know?

499
01:05:39,224 --> 01:05:41,893
This is my silent partner.

500
01:05:43,061 --> 01:05:46,231
A whisper in the ear
from this girl goes a long way.

501
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:05,542
You didn't hear a thing.
You heard the slide click a little.

502
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:08,086
Massive cool.

503
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:10,255
Forward, Jamaica.

504
01:07:05,018 --> 01:07:08,980
These are the streets dat breed
de Screwfaces o' de world.

505
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:13,527
This is the first time l ever got the idea
it's not all sunshine and bikinis.

506
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:18,823
l owe you an apology. Until today l thought
all Jamaicans were dope-dealing dreads.

507
01:07:18,949 --> 01:07:23,745
Don't feel you have to apologise for nothin'.
Man, these streets are hard out here.

508
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:28,708
And some people make a bad choice,
dat's all. They say life is hard.

509
01:08:13,753 --> 01:08:15,797
- What, man?
- Nothin'.

510
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:20,677
What are you doin' all de way up here?
Not enough trouble in Kingston, beast-boy?

511
01:08:20,969 --> 01:08:24,097
Back with country, boy. You do your duty?

512
01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:27,767
Pay him.

513
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:36,526
Dis gal... she hang
with Screwface more time.

514
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:40,864
Dey always partying together.
l usually find her at de Cat Club.

515
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,662
Screwface?

516
01:10:12,497 --> 01:10:14,541
Road to doom.

517
01:10:15,417 --> 01:10:19,796
- Sounds like you know this guy pretty well.
- Yeah, l know him.

518
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:22,007
l partied wid him.

519
01:10:22,132 --> 01:10:26,511
l don't care him sell the drugs, sir.
lt's part o' doin' business.

520
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:31,474
But my sister, she lost a shipment
and him cut her dead.

521
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,479
And for dat, somehow,
someday, him a go dust off.

522
01:10:37,022 --> 01:10:42,277
Why don't you just tell me what l gotta know,
and l'll go do what l gotta do?

523
01:10:45,614 --> 01:10:49,743
Screwface have two head and four eyes,

524
01:10:49,868 --> 01:10:52,787
an' dat is de secret to his magic.

525
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:32,118
Look 'pon dis madman.

526
01:11:33,745 --> 01:11:37,624
Him dead, and him don't even know it.

527
01:18:18,608 --> 01:18:20,902
Welcome to l island.

528
01:18:21,236 --> 01:18:23,697
Fuck you.

529
01:18:25,073 --> 01:18:27,826
You a woman? Me know what you is.

530
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:30,704
You is a dog after a bone!

531
01:18:31,163 --> 01:18:34,040
An' yuh have no teeth.

532
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,234
You was conceived in darkness.

533
01:19:02,903 --> 01:19:07,073
An' l goin' deliver you into de light.

534
01:19:19,377 --> 01:19:21,922

01:19:26,551 --> 01:19:28,678
Get up!

l know you. You love de killin'.

537
01:20:11,638 --> 01:20:14,474
But you is an empty shell inside.

538
01:20:37,706 --> 01:20:39,875
Fall out.

539
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,127
Charles. Move out.

540
01:21:10,488 --> 01:21:15,327
So, bredds... tell me one more time.
Did you tell them exactly what l told you to?

541
01:21:15,452 --> 01:21:18,205
l told 'em exactly what you told me to tell 'em.

542
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:22,584

- Exactly what you said they was goin' to say.

543
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:27,297
- ls that right? And what was that?
- ''Business is business, man.''

544
01:21:27,422 --> 01:21:29,674
Ten dollars.

545
01:21:29,799 --> 01:21:33,803
- lt ain't over yet.
- Does this guy ever pay you on time?

546
01:22:37,617 --> 01:22:39,995
So who's the boss-man?

547
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:43,039
- l man.
- Thanks for taking this meeting, man.

548
01:22:43,165 --> 01:22:45,834
l got a message for you. Screwface is dead.

549
01:22:46,418 --> 01:22:48,920
You raasclat stupid.

550
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:51,965
Hey! Anybody ever see this?

556

Don't even think about it.

01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:46,561
- Magic power!
- Screwface no dead. Screwface no dead.

558
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:51,600
