1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,391
- Lovely.
- That is for sure.

3
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,873
So this is the country?

4
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,275
Listen to the underprivileged child back there, will you?

5
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,844
- There it is, darling. 17 Shore Road.
- Yeah, I got it.

6
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,045
- Are you all right, Davey?
- I'm fine.

7
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,819
Oh my God!

8
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,392
Is that our house?

9
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,628
No Davey, that's not our house.

10
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,394
It can't be our house.

11
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:53,377
Dracula subtitles, fixed by engvig.

12
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,999
What a waste.

13
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,300
Well, it said "suitable for a large family."

14
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,640
It's so big!

15
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,875
Marian.

16
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:35,374
Will you be sensible, maybe? Now you don't rent a house like this for a reasonable...

17
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,822
I mean there must be a gate house or guest room or something...

18
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,449
No, this is it.

19
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,860
Well there's only one way we can find out, isn't there.

20
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,137
"Onward into the valley of death,
rode the six hundred..."

21
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,443
I hope they're in.

22
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,900
Oh, we're the Rolf's.
We've come about the Summer place.

23
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,951
I know, I know - I've been expecting y'all!

24
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,318
My name's Walker, and I'm the handyman.
I keep everything spick and span.

25
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,586
Y'all come on in. Come on in, ma'am. Come on in!
Come on in, boy!

26
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,004
- How d'ya like it?
- Oh, it's...

27
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:06,002
- Look, is this the place they're talking about renting?
- It sure is!

28
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,974
It's pretty, ain't it? Beautiful, ain't it?
Ya'll come on in the sitting room. Come on in the sittin room, ma'am. 

29
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,282
Just turn around on here, and make yourself at home right here.

30
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,588
Just make yourselves right at home,
while I go and get the Neb's.

31
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,486
Boy, you watch that furniture, ya hear?

32
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,998
- I don't believe it.
- Me neither.

33
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,837
Can I go outside for a while and mess around?

34
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,213
You don't have to come, you know.

35
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,085
- No I don't want to come, but you stay around here, right?
- OK.

36
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,486
- Hey, you hear what I say?
- Yeah, I heard you.

37
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,123
What are you doing?

38
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,325
Such a waste!
It kills me.

39
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,865
- You mustn't take things so personally.
- I can't help it.

40
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,204
- Where's Davey?
- He's outside.

41  
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,085
- Do you mind if I shut the door to keep the stench out?
- No.

42
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,452
Marian, look at this.

43
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,559
- This is extraordinary.
- How beautiful.

44
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,694
Yeah, but they're all the same!

45
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,831
This one must be what, 100 years old?

46
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,431
This one's quite recent.

47
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,205
Yeah, but why?

48
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:55,146
Here they are!

49
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,914
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

50
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,844
It's been quite a morning.

51
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:07,792
If your busy schedule permits, would 
you mind taking the mirror out? It's cracked.

52
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,860
- Ain't the only thing cracked around here.
- Old fool.

53
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,331
Grouchy old bastard.

54
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:26,194
I'm Roz Allardyce. My brother will be down
just as soon as he pulls himself together.

55
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,137
We're the Rolf's.
My name is Ben.

56
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,107
My wife, Marian.

57
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,615
How do you do?

58
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,682
- There's a boy too, isn't there?
- Yes, our son David. He's out in the garden.

59
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:40,283
- Is that all right?
- Oh yes. Children are good for the place.

60
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,594
Well, I suppose we'd better get down to details?

61
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,761
Ah, a practical man. Just like brother.

62
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,095
The ad did say "reasonable".

63
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:57,295
"Very reasonable", as I recall.
And so it is, for the right people.

64
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:04,275
Well, assuming we are the "right people", 
what would your idea of "reasonable" be?

65
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,614
Well, I'd like to ask you
a few questions first.

66
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,952
Would you be taking the house by yourselves?

67
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,219
Well, no. There's Ben's aunt, Elizabeth.

68
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,453
- How old?
- She's 74.

69
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:22,625
An old gal then?
You wouldn't mind having an old gal around?

70
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,930
Oh no.
Elizabeth is a doll.

71
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,034
And you'll take the place from the 1st of July
until Labour Day

72
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,003
and you'll keep the place
and you'll tend it?

73
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,006
By ourselves? I mean, alone?

74
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:37,943
Well, yes.

75
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,244
I don't know,  
with a house this size

76
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,448
and only my wife, I don't know that we'd be...

77
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,459
The house takes care of itself,
Mr. Rolf.

78
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,557
Believe me.

79
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,298
I hate to make an issue
of this but...

80
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,269
...will you love the house as brother and I do?

81
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,869
Oh yes. I think we will.

82
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,212
Then we're talking in the neighbourhood of 900 dollars.

83
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,805
- Look, I don't know that I'm going be able to make that...
- For the whole Summer.

84
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:14,911
Help! Help!

85
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,312
Ah, that's brother.

86
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,413
- Walker, Walker, for Christ's sake!
- Oh dear.

87
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,456
- Hold your horses, I'm coming!
- The damn stairlift is broken again.

88
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,698
- It's moving! It's moving!
- Excuse me.

89
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,492
I want down!

90
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,796
Unbelievable, isn't it?

91
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,664
It's an absolute steal! There's no question, is there darling.
We'll grab it.

92
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,868
- Look, sweetheart, I don't really...
- But darling, we'd be crazy not to!

93
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:41,342
Well if we were we'd be in step with them, wouldn't we.
Look at them all, they're...

94
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:46,000
The man's an absolute idiot, and we've
got to get rid of him! Do you understand? Do you?

95
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,183
This is my brother, Arnold.
As you can see, he's full of beans today.

96
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:55,291
So you are the people who want to 
rent this house, is that right?

97
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,863
Yes, we were just discussing terms
with your, um, lady.

98
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,028
Oh, I like them Roz, I like them.

99
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,298
- There's a boy, too.
- Yes, our son David.

100
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,238
- He's playing in the garden.
- Really? Show me.

101
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,672
Hurry Roz, I want to see.

102
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,941
Ah, there he is!
Isn't he darling.

103
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,355
Oh God, what a charming little boy.
How old is he, eight or nine?

104
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,154
- No, 12.
- 12? Isn't he sweet.

105
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,094
He's full of the Devil too, isn't he?

106
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:42,570
- Oh I'm sorry, maybe he shouldn't be walking around ...
- No no, leave him alone, he's fine. He's just fine!

107
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,305
- Do you rent often?
- It depends.

108
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:54,307
Oh, what my sister's trying to say is that
we have this desperate need of rest and relaxation.

109
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,448
I'm coming apart, as you can see...

110
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,424
- Oh, brother ...
- Oh, brother is right.

111
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,955
Well, do you like it?

112
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,895
- We love it.
- Really?

113
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,299
God, when it comes alive. Tell them, brother.
Tell them what it's like in the Summer.

114
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:20,034
Well, they'd never believe it.
It's beyond anything that you've ever seen in your life.

115
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:25,282
There's centuries in this room, Mrs. Rolf.

116
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,919
- There are years, years in this house.
- Oh yes.

117
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:35,520
And this house will be here long, long after
you have departed, do you believe me.

118
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,855
It's practically immortal.

119
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,429
- I sincerely believe that.
- So do I.

120
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,799
Oh, I know that must seem funny to you.

121
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,474
But when people love a house the way
my brother and I love this one ...

122
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,308
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude,
it's just that...

123
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,510
...well, I was waiting for the catch.

124
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,814
Catch?

125
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,649
Well, you mean it's 900 dollars and...

126
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,885
...and then it's all ours?

127
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,192
Oh, of course there is one other thing.

128
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,030
- But it's hardly a catch.
- No, it's not a catch.

129
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,394
It's our mother.

130
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,398
What about her?

131
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,503
An 85 year old woman who could pass for 60.

132
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,809
Yes now, what she's trying to say is ...

133
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,009
that our mother never, ever leaves the house.

134
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,018
Well she never leaves her room actually, isn't that so?

135
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,292
Oh, she'll be no trouble at all.

136
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:46,824
No, you'll probably never even see her.
She sleeps most of the time.

137
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:52,311
And when she's not sleeping, she's listening to her music
or working on her collection.

138
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:58,269
Yes, her pictures, or old photos.
You see, she has literally thousands of them.

139
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,375
Memories of a lifetime.

140
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,643
She is our darling.

141
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:10,749
And all you'd have to do is prepare a tray, three times a day,
and just leave it on the table. In her sitting room.

142
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:19,691
Look...do you mind very much if we go home,
maybe think about it and let you know...

143
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:22,627
- Ben, no!
- Thank you very much.

144
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,069
- Mom.
- Davey?

145
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:27,971
Davey, what happened?

146
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,601
- I just cut my knee.
- That looks nasty!

147
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,146
- What happened there?
- I fell off a thing out there.

148
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,250
You better wash off his poor little cuts.

149
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,611
Let's go out to the kitchen.

150
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,987
- Come on, I have some band-aids.
- Come on, darling.

151
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,829
Where are you going with that plant?

152
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,544
Josie said it was dead!

153
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,807
Did she?

154
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,206
Well, look again.

155
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,318
Huh! Ain't that somethin'.

156
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,128
I thought you were impossibly rude.

157
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,335
Was I?

158
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,612
Oh come on, sweetheart. Someone should go in
there with a large butterfly net.

159
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,115
They got carried away,
that's all.

160
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,749
Not yet, they didn't.

161
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,658
You do not rent an estate like that for 900 dollars.

162
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,292
Why not?

163
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,764
Maybe they're not interested in money.
Maybe they want someone who'll take care of the place.

164
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,872
Just be there.

165
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,234
Well all right, maybe. But you don't need 
a 90 year old woman just to...

166
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,242
85.

167
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,802
85 or 185, what's the difference.

168
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,510
You don't leave an old lady like that
with two complete strangers.

169
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:25,813
You wouldn't have to worry about her.
She'd be my responsibility.

170
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,427
- Oh yeah, sure. And what if she's to die?
- Oh my God.

171
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,698
Does it really mean that much to you?

172
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,204
You know it does.

173
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,314
I'll survive.

174
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:59,999
The question is...will I be able to survive. 

175
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,036
Allardyce.

176
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,136
Yes, Mr. Rolf.

177
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,038
Marvellous.
Brother will be so pleased!

178
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,999
July 1st.

179
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:31,350
We'll have everything ready.
Thank you. Bye.

180
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,837
- Are you comfortable back there?
- No! Just about everything in me is numb!

181
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,874
Except of course your mouth, auntie.

182
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,456
Oh Benji, I forgot to tell you. I renewed my
learner's permit.

183
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,253
I am determined this time.

184
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,329
Well, I must admit I admire
your persistence, auntie.

185
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,332
Well my persistence is the reason
I've flourished this long.

186
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,860
All you've got to do, auntie, 
is learn to relax at the wheel.

187
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:24,375
I always relax at the wheel.
I get nervous inspectors!

188
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,742
We'll have lots of room.

189
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,811
I can't get over it.

190
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,013
Beautiful, isn't it.

191
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,999
Looks deserted.

192
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,890
Can't be.

193
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,145
What's the matter, something wrong?

194
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,981
They had to leave.

195
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,379
Leave?

196
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:53,791
"Enjoy the house and don't worry about anything.
Arnold and Roz Allardyce. "

197
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,630
- Jesus Christ.
- I know, it's crazy.

198
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,102
What if something goes wrong,
where do we reach them?

199
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,197
They do crazy things sometimes, old people.

200
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:08,075
Yes they do, don't they.
But these two are two steps beyond crazy.

201
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,881
- And what about the old lady?
- I'll look in on her.

202
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,746
You do that. It's your department.
David! Bags.

203
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,043
- Marian, I can't believe it!
- And it's all ours.

204
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,203
Be right there.

205
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,624
Mrs. Allardyce?

206
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,727
It's Marian Rolf.
We're the new tenants.

207
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,995
Are you all right?

208
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,500
Is there anything you need?

209
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,579
Memories of a lifetime.

210
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,983
Marian, where are you?

211
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,801
- What have you been doing up there?
- I've been getting her tray.

212
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,070
- Have you seen her? What's she like?
- She's asleep.

213
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,034
We'll see her later.

214
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,602
Now, listen. Both of you.

215
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,010
These stairs are out of bounds to anyone but me, all right?

216
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,486
Mrs. Allardyce is a very old lady
and she's my responsibility.

217
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,556
I don't want anyone bothering her.

218
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,755
Crushing.

219
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:27,457
- Hey you guys! Come see what I found!
- What are you talking about?

220
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,228
Come on, I'll show you!
It's in the kitchen!

221
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,825
Let's go look.

222
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:38,071
None of the clocks are working.
It's a pity, they're all so lovely.

223
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,370
Probably need winding.
Just wait til I get to work.

224
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,506
You can't wait to get into your  
knee pads and jock strap, can you.

225
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,584
- Benji!
- Oh auntie.

226
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:55,818
Isn't it great?

227
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,226
- Great.
- Aunt Elizabeth, look at this!

228A
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,561
My God, it's got everything!

229
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,367
Benji, here's your first job!
Needs a new bulb.

230
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,836
Right.

231
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,541
So they're crazy are they, darling?
So they're weird, huh?

232
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,617
Yeah well, this is the kind of crazy I can live with.

233
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,385
- God damn it..
- Benji! In front of the child...

234
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,550
I'll go see about Mrs. Allardyce's lunch, OK? 
You guys fix a nice spread of sandwiches...

  
235
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,289
- Marvellous, give it to me!
- I always said he had it down.

236
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,668
Marian: Did you see those antiques?

237
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,467
Hey, I think I see some Ding Dongs!

238
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,441
<i> Marian: Aunt Elizabeth, did you ever see
so many priceless antiques? </ i>

239
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,535
Hey, they are Ding Dongs!

240
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,538
A whole case of them!

241
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,242
<i> Ben: How about a little toast to the house, eh?</ i>

242
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,003
- Hey, slave!
- Hi!

243
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:12,089
This is fantastic,
what have you been doing?

244
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,388
Where did you get this from?

245
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,194
That is the same one that was rolled up
against the wall.

246
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,201
You like it?
It's worth a fortune.

247
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,964
- I'll get that.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

248
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,868
You did all this by yourself since we left?

249
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,033
And there's more upstairs, I'll have you know.
How was town?

250
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,402
Oh, it was great, great...

251
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,638
Capital of nowhere, if you know what I mean.

252
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,549
- Put those sacks in the kitchen.
- Yeah, "put the bags in the kitchen..."

253
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,680
Hey why don't you come and watch us fix the pool,
that should be some kind of a laugh.

254
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,282
Busy, busy, busy!

255
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,116
Aren't you finished with that thing yet?

256
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,619
Listen, if you're so God damn smart why
don't you come up here and fix it yourself?

257
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,123
Davey, go show your father
how to do it.

258
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,118
All right then, I will!

259
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,756
Will you quit trying to undermine
my parental authority, old lady?

260
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,595
Rather that than go down there and shoving out of that old sewer. 

261
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,071
Yeah, which is kind of why I'm trying to get this model work.

262
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,370
- Father.
- Yeah.

263
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,810
Come here. Come on, come here!

264
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,814
See, there's a little object on these machines called a cut off.

265
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,114
There it is.
Go on, try it.

266
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,756
- Do you think it will work?
- I'll bet on it.

267
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,561
- How much will you bet?
- 5 dollars.

268
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,203
Benji, you're a mechanical genius!

269
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,231
Hey look, it's a graveyard!

270
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,986
Hey dad! Hey, come look what I found!
It's an old bike!

271
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:04,766
You know something, Davey? They're all Allardyce's.

272
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,199
And I haven't been able to find one any newer than
the 1890's.

273
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,207
Bit spooky, eh?

274
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,907
Would you like some candy, little boy?

275
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:25,516
- Leave me alone!
- You can't run away from me, little boy! Ha ha ha!

276
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,481
Mrs. Allardyce?

277
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,721
Are you all right?

278
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,730
I am very worried about you.

279
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:10,232
We've been here over a week,
and you've barely eaten anything.

280
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,770
Is it that you don't like what I've been bringing you?
It's what Roz wanted me to give you.

281
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,371
Do you go down to the kitchen at night?
Is that's what you've been doing?

282
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:29,314
Mrs. Allardyce,
if you would at least speak to me.

283
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,563
Where's mom?
She said she was gonna come with us, didn't she?

284
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,767
Yeah well, you know your mother don't you.

285
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,041
How's your wind hanging on?

286
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,479
Not what it used to be.

287
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,246
- You smoke too much, you know that?
- I know.

288
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,583
And I drink too much.

289
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:06,789
And I am a lecherous old lady
and I'll never make 80.

290
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:38,453
Did you put the chlorine in the pool?
I mean, you know that does kill the germs.

291
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:43,425
Yeah well, I'm not too interested in the germs.
You see, it's the sea serpent I'm after, boy.

292
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,218
Well, when can we go swimming?

293
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,996
Why don't you go and ask your mother first.

294
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,572
- Go on, double double double!
- I'm going.

295
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,343
<i> David: Hey mom! </ i>

296
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,012
<i> David: Hey mom, are you up there? </ i>

297
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,683
<i> David: It's time to go swimming with us, mom </ i>

298
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,766
I couldn't find her anywhere.
I searched the whole house!

299
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,603
Don't worry, 
she's probably on the john.

300
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,060
Isn't that great?

301
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,444
That was a great dive, dad!

302
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,985
- Oh Benji, you should be in the Olympics.
- Right, right...

303
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,492
Hey, what is that?

304
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,103
Nothing boy, nothing.

305
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,841
Yeah well, I'm coming out!

306
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,810
All right Benny, you might be a great ball player,
but you float like a rock, got that?

307
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,241
Yeah well, I'm coming out anyhow.

308
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,953
Davey!
That is deep water!

309
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,923
Now stop showing off.

310
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,956
Dad, it's a sea serpent!

311
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,263
No no, help!

312
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,715
- Wanna play then Davey, eh?
- Yeah.

313
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,513
- What is it, witless?
- OK.

314
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,020
You clutch on my shoulders, OK?

315
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,021
Ben, no!

316
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:09,560
- That was fun!
- Yeah, you like that? Wanna do it again?
- OK.

317
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,501
All right now, you two.
It's quite enough.

318
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,372
Benji, you're worse
than a spoiled child.

319
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,415
- That was really hard.
- You like that, Davey?

320
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,508
What are you doing?

321
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,211
Benji, stop it!

322
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:12,155
Ben, my God!
You're hurting him!

323
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,253
Ben, it's after 2:00.

324
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,160
Is it?

325
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,328
Did you sleep?

326
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,733
- Yeah, some.
- Want to come back and try again?

327
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,906
Well, in a while maybe.

328
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,556
- You don't have to smoke in here, do you?
- Why, is it wrong for the room? 

329
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,291
Ben. You didn't mean to hurt Davey.

330
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,530
- The roughhouse just got out of hand.
- Roughhouse...

331
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,105
You weren't there Marian, for Christ sake.

332
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,141
No, I wasn't.

333
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,508
I'm sorry, you see...

334
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:29,450
It's all I can think of.
I can't get it out of my head.

335
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,122
Ben, I know you.

336
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,985
- So I know you didn't mean to do that.
- The hell I did, Marian!

337
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,063
I wanted to hurt him, do you understand that? I wanted to hurt him.

338
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:45,389
You're punishing yourself.
Davey is all right. He's all right!

339
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,436
What if it's more serious than you think it is?

340
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,802
What do you mean?

341
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,614
Those dreams I had about
my mother's...you know...

342
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,118
...they're coming back, Marian.

343
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,724
Darling, that was such a very long time ago.

344
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:20,531
There's nothing wrong with you.
Absolutely nothing.

345
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,451
My God!

346
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:51,000
It's completely changed.
It's all new again.

347
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,431
It's all yours.
You like it?

348
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:09,639
Yeah, it's great.

349
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:15,000
I took away the television, it was wrong for the room anyway.
...you should forgive the expression.

350
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,086
All we've got to do now 
is just find something for me to do.

351
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,093
Oh darling, there's loads for you to do.

352
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:28,796
Now's a good a time as any to start on your doctorate.

353
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:35,234
- Benji. It's all right, isn't it?
- What, the room?

354
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:42,000
No, yesterday.
It's a long time ago.

355
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,607
Let's just forget it
and start over again, OK?

356
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:59,220
Oh, how nice.
David has decided to take up painting.

357
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,061
We're off to search out a view.

358
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,768
Hi, Davey.

359
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:21,274
- How is everything?
- Okay.

360
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:27,017
- Did you take your paints, Davey?
- Yeah.

361
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:35,008
- We're still friends?
- Oh dad!

362
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:41,705
- I never want to go back to that pool.
- No, you won't have to Davey.

363
00:45:42,146 --> 00:45:44,477
I promise you won't have to.

364
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,342
I don't like going to bed without you.

365
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,483
It's been a while since I was down here.

366
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,151
- Hasn't it?
- Yes, I know.

367
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:54,397
- Well, at least the filter seems to be working, doesn't it?
- Yes, a tribute to a genius.

368
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,011
The rest of it, it's all...

369
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,613
It seems to be all...

370
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,481
Smell of lemon oil?

371
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:08,187
I plucked the weeds, I polished the chrome.
I scrubbed the concrete.

372
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,789
What is it, honey?

373
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,893
Do you know I had to come down here to...

374
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,633
...well, to see if I could.

375
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,538
I thought we were going to
forget about all that.

376
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,542
We tried, didn't we.

377
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:43,390
- You seem to have landed yourself with a bit of a kook.
- Well, that makes two of us.

378
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,499
Looks marvellous,
why don't you jump in?

379
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:58,699
- Will you come with me?
- Oh, I don't have my suit.

380
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,508
Well then, why don't you take your clothes off?

381
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,944
What if I go first?

382
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,326
Come on in.
It's great.

383
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:22,660
- Will it aid in the therapy?
- It'll aid the therapy.

384
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,595
Oh, why not.

385
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,636
Everything.

386
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,412
Come here.

387
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,455
It's been a long time between visits.

388
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:58,555
I miss them.

389
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,539
None of that stuff now, honey.

390
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,107
A little water sport.

391
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,506
It's very good for the circulation, you know.

392
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,117
My circulation's fine.

393
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,958
Come back!

394
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,328
- Marian?
- Not on your life.

395
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,784
Look, I'm not saying it's going to be 
dynamite after 13 years.

396
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:53,445
But surely some semblance of excitement...

397
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:07,236
I can't work out what's made me
so repulsive all of a sudden.

398
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,236
Repulsive?

399
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,475
You're incredibly sexy.

400
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,973
Ben, I don't want to!

401
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,081
Not here. Not here, you can't.

402
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,981
Marian, for God's sake.

403
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,515
Please. You don't understand.

404
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,162
You mustn't. Please!

405
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,784
Morning!

406
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,004
- Where did you get that?
- Hall closet.

407
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,532
This house is full of treasures.

408
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,868
You didn't come to bed at all last night, did you?

409
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,736
After the pool...

410
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:09,341
I went up to Mrs. Allardyce's room
to see if she needed anything.

411
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:15,056
And I don't know how it happened, I just fell 
asleep in a wing chair. I guess I was pretty tired.

412
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,530
Where are you going?

413
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:31,301
Oh, I'm going to...trim the drive or something.

414
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,669
Well, what happened to you?
It's nearly lunchtime.

415
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:11,645
Goodness! Can't anyone ever 
oversleep in this family?

416
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,799
I just mean it's not like you, aunt Elizabeth.
You've got more energy than any of us.

417
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:21,245
Had.
I'm afraid this Summer vacation is wearing me out.

418
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:25,192
Too much sun.
Why don't you try painting in the shade?

419
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:29,388
My God!
I need a beauty parlour.

420
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,331
Don't be silly.

421
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,400
I'm not the only one who could use
the beauty parlour.

422
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:43,103
- You're getting quite a bit of grey in your hair, Marian.
- I know.

423
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,999
I think I take after my aunt Mary.

424
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:50,043
You know, she went entirely grey
by the time she was 33.

425
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:55,216
Oh! Davey's been looking for you.
He wants to go hiking.

426
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,427
What's funny?

427
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:02,000
- Oh, me. Do you know what I want to do right now?
- No?

428
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,693
I want to go right back up to bed.

429
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:10,430
- Isn't that awful?
- Certainly not.

430
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,636
Why don't you go up there and take a nap?
It'll be good for you.

431
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,539
Maybe I will.

432
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,578
Damn it, I won't!

433
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,223
Oh for Heaven's sake, Elizabeth,
what is wrong with you?

434
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,889
Mrs. Allardyce?

435
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,058
May I come in?

436
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,228
Marian, I didn't know you were in there.

437
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,128
What happened to your nap?

438
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:22,134
Well I thought it about time I introduced myself
to our benefactor.

439
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:23,903
She's asleep.

440
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,932
Oh, that's too bad.

441
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,608
I thought she might enjoy seeing
my picture.

442
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,909
I'm sure she would dear, when she's awake.

443
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:41,586
- Elizabeth, I'm right in the middle of something.
- Oh I'm sorry dear, I didn't mean to interrupt anything.

444
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:45,822
- You tell her I came to visit.
- I know she'll appreciate it.

445
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,355
- And if she ever wants any company...
- I'll let her know. OK?

446
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:52,859
Well, be careful on the steps.

447
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:57,164
Now you just go back to your work.
I'll be all right.

448
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,670
Davey!

449
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,670
- What is it, what's wrong?
- Gas.

450
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:30,305
- Oh my God! Well is he all right!?
- Yes, he's breathing.

451
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,805
Breathe in, boy.

452
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,353
Here, hold him. I'll be right back.

453
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,004
Breathe the air now.

454
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,462
- Are you all right, Davey?
- I think he's better.

455
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:23,528
What has happened, Benji?

456
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,297
That damn gas heater...

457
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:32,000
I just don't understand how it happened.
How could it have happened?

458
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,077
Have you had any breakfast, dear?

459
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,715
No, I overslept again.
A disgrace.

460
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,388
- How is Davey?
- Oh, everything's fine.

461
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:57,196
Ben called from town.
Davey's all right, thank God.

462
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,462
I can't imagine how frightened I was.

463
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,363
Poor little Davey.

464
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,740
I want you to know
I didn't touch that heater.

465
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,719
- Well of course you didn't, dear.
- If I did, I'd remember.

466
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:25,018
- Nobody said you did.
- I just covered him, that's all.

467
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,928
You covered him?
You mean you were in David's room last night?

468
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:34,400
Yes, I looked in on him.
Sometimes I don't sleep.

469
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,136
Exactly what did you do in his room, Elizabeth?

470
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:43,978
I told you, I just covered him.
It was cold.

471
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,647
This house is getting so cold.

472
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:50,007
You know, David's door
is always open.

473
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,621
Last night it was locked.

474
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,816
Well, I didn't lock it.

475
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,824
The only thing I touched
was the blanket.

476
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,562
Well, that's all I remember doing.

477
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,599
All right, you didn't lock it.
It locked itself!

478
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,801
Now what about the windows?

479
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,005
They were open.

480
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:21,049
They were closed when Ben walked into that room.
Now, make sense, Elizabeth!

481
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,942
How can I?

482
01:05:25,754 --> 01:05:30,817
How can I...when you keep shouting at me..
and accusing me..?

483
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,390
I'm not accusing you.

484
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,431
Where's Ben?

485
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,333
Benji will believe me.

486
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,967
I believe you too.

487
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,267
No, you don't.
It's obvious.

488
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,103
We all forget things, Elizabeth...

489
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,271
...and...at your age...

490
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:59,000
I don't forget things!
I know what I do!

491
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,947
Well, of course you do, dear.

492
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,861
Now, why don't you just let me get you
some breakfast?

493
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:13,228
But what about the old woman...Mrs...

494
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,237
Oh, I am so mixed up... Mrs. ...

495
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:17,771
Allardyce.

496
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,701
- Yes, Allardyce. Maybe she...
- Aunt Elizabeth!

497
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,202
Let's just forget this!

498
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,850
Tell Ben I'm upstairs.

499
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,489
I'll bring your breakfast to your room.

500
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,432
Like you do to her room?

501
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,068
The other old woman?

502
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,066
No, no. Don't bother, Marian.

503
01:07:09,597 --> 01:07:10,787
Elizabeth.

504
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:16,487
- Benji.
- Did I wake you?

505
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,172
Are you all right?

506
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,914
Do you feel up to a few little Martinis
on the terrace?

507
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,313
Do you know what she said to me?

508
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:39,610
Elizabeth, she was upset.
I'm sure she didn't mean what she was saying.

509
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,586
She has no right
to talk to me like that.

510
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,692
I would die ...

511
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,755
I would die
before I did anything to hurt Davey.

512
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,727
Look, you two never had words before.
Why, all of a sudden?

513
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:57,100
Well, ask your wife.

514
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:03,301
- Maybe I am an old woman.
- Elizabeth, you are not old.

515
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:07,545
But that doesn't mean that I've
lost all my marbles.

516
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:14,176
If I had closed those windows or locked that door,
the way she said...

517
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:16,818
I'm sure she didn't say that.

518
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,224
I'd certainly remember...

519
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,162
You don't forget things like that.

520
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,694
I couldn't forget something as important as that, could I?

521
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:34,299
Oh I'm sorry, Benji.
But she's gotten me so upset.

522
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,279
I don't like it here.
I want to leave this house.

523
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:44,214
You feel the same way, 
I know you do.

524
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,225
Look Elizabeth, we're all upset.

525
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:57,061
Now why don't you come downstairs
and have those drinks?

526
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:01,102
Even if it's just a little chance for Marian
to say she's sorry.

527
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,435
All right.

528
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,904
But only for you, Benji.

529
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,309
I love you.

530
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,074
Do you know that? 
I do.

531
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:41,876
Ben, you scared me.

532
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:45,212
Have you any idea just how much you've hurt her?

533
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,618
I'm sorry, but she was 
in his room last night.

534
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,514
Why should she lie, Marian?

535
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:56,849
I didn't say that she lied.
She simply does not remember.

536
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:03,227
And I suppose she's responsible for all
the other things that go on in this house?

537
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:10,563
Well, I don't know what
that's supposed to mean.

538
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,536
Now if you don't mind, I'd like
to go downstairs.

539
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:17,043
Well, shouldn't I meet her first?

540
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,812
- I mean, where is she?
- She's in her bedroom, asleep!

541
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,581
Ben, she doesn't like anyone up here.

542
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,827
Her...collection.

543
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,871
Why don't you just let me lock up, dear?

544
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,610
Why are you so nervous?

545
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,045
I'm not nervous.
I just wouldn't want to upset her.

546
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,344
Why do you keep her door locked?

547
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,251
She likes it that way.
She's an old woman.

548
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,090
- She...
- Gave you the key?

549
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,588
No, the key was in the envelope
the Allardyce's left.

550
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:15,162
And were the keys belonging to all those clocks
in the same envelope?

551
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:20,564
The keys to the clocks were in the clock cases.
Why do you ask?

552
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:25,209
I just wonder whether you wound all those clocks
by yourself.

553
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,145
That's all.

554
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:32,417
Well, of course I did.

555
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:39,156
What is this darling, a third degree?

556
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,721
What's all this?

557
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:46,934
Time to throw Ben a little something?
Keep him happy, out of your way?

558
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:51,169
- Is that what you think?
- To be perfectly frank Marian, I don't know what to think.

559
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,005
Maybe you can tell me.

560
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,207
All right, I'll try.

561
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:04,113
I'm sorry about the way I acted
at the pool the other night.

562
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,220
I don't know why I acted that way.

563
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:13,419
Perhaps you need a little more time
to work that one out.

564
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,238
Davey, be care...

565
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,338
Look what you did!

566
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,706
- Don't you ever touch a thing!
- I didn't mean to do it!

567
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:32,713
Don't you ever touch
a beautiful thing!

568
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,736
- Ben, I...
- Marian, what is happening to you?
- Absolutely nothing.

569
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,403
Then what the hell was that performance
with Davey back in there!

570
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,878
This house just...

571
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,317
...is more than I thought it would be.

572
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:25,550
Marian, this house is not yours, sweetheart.
We do not own it, do you understand that?

573
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,986
But it's my responsibility for
as long as we're here, isn't it?

574
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,629
Please be patient with me.
I need more time.

575
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:42,571
More time for what?
To get more involved with all this?

576
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,471
Marian, the Summer is almost over.

577
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:55,120
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Of course not.

578
01:14:56,458 --> 01:15:00,719
What's more important to you?
The house, all this...

579
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,999
...or us?

580
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,964
What kind of a question is that?

581
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,662
All right, I'll put it another way.

582
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,706
If I was to ask you...

583
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,474
would you give it up?

584
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,845
Give it up?

585
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:22,875
Why?

586
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,990
What if I hadn't reached Davey in time?

587
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:34,353
What does that got to do with this house?
Or with leaving?

588
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:39,863
Ben...I can't believe you're serious!

589
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:41,735
Oh, I'm serious, Marian.

590
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,471
Do you know how ridiculous you're sounding?

591
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:53,577
Are you actually trying to tell me
that this house is responsible?

592
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,212
Would you give it up for me?

593
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:03,283
I mean, even if you thought it was in my head,
in my mind?

594
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,190
Would you?

595
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:12,224
Dad!
Mom!

596
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,266
Dad, it's Elizabeth!

597
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,908
She's up here.

598
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,574
Oh my God.

599
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,416
Marian, get Davey out of here, please.
Get him out now, please!

600
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:45,258
What's the number of that doctor
I used when Davey was ill?

601
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:49,432
- Where is it?
- On the hall table.

602
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:51,633
Stay with her.

603
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,974
Did you get him?

604
01:17:37,016 --> 01:17:38,474
No.

605
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:40,819
It was busy.

606
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:43,517
Well it can't be busy all night.

607
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:45,454
Can't they?

608
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:51,790
They were all busy, Marian.
Every God damn one I tried.

609
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,796
Including the operator.

610
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,836
Surprised?

611
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,503
I don't know what you're talking about.

612
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:05,071
I'll go down and try him myself.

613
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,212
Yes, you do that.

614
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:44,885
- I got it.
- You got him?

615
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:49,152
But all the lines were busy, Marian.
I didn't imagine that.

616
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:51,086
No, I'm sure you didn't.

617
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,288
The important thing is he'll be here.

618
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,777
Isn't there something I can do?

619
01:19:06,469 --> 01:19:09,633
No, no.
You go and check on Davey, OK?

620
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,337
And then wait for the doctor downstairs.

621
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,201
Ashes to ashes, 
and dust to dust.

622
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:36,338
In the sure and certain hope of the ressurection 
of eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord...

623
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,079
And in her courage and faith,
this good woman is now...

624
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,241
joined in eternal peace
with her Maker ...

625
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,619
in His Divine Kingdom...

626
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:49,149
And we who grieve must take solace
in the fact...

627
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:54,355
that we, too, are promised life eternal,
as our reward for our good work.

628
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:05,732
I love eating by candlelight.

629
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:15,647
- Well, life sure as hell goes on, doesn't it Marian.
- And why shouldn't it?

630
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,911
- Aren't you sitting down, dear?
- To be perfectly frank, I...

631
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,715
I do not have an appetite.

632
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:30,361
Look, Elizabeth is dead.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

633
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,025
It means a great deal to me.
Davey!

634
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:39,397
Marian, I'm not sure that anything means a great deal to you
except this bloody house, do you understand that!

635
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:41,438
Well, that isn't true.

636
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:47,475
Then how do you account for your absence
at Elizabeth's funeral?

637
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,609
You know I couldn't leave
Mrs. Allardyce alone.

638
01:24:57,525 --> 01:25:01,154
Oh, I don't think we want that on the table, do we sweetheart?
Not on the pretty mahogany.

639
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,824
Why don't you pour it, and bring 
the bottle back to the kitchen.

640
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,061
- But there aren't any glasses.
- Well, there's a goblet.

641
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,061
Is better than glass.
It's silver.

642
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:14,475
But I don't want a goblet, I want a glass.

643
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:19,574
You heard what your mother said, Davey.
You are messing up her table.

644
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:25,652
- Are you going to sit down?
- I have told you, Marian, I'm not hungry.

645
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,656
Well now, thanks to you, neither am I.

646
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:56,343
Call the old lady.

647
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,782
I want to see her.

648
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:04,925
Ben, stay away from that door!

649
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,686
- Marian, open this door.
- I can't.

650
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,457
She has the only key. 
I don't have that key, it's locked.

651
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:17,777
All right, what is it you know?
What is it you've known all along?

652
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:19,872
Let me go.

653
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:22,969
Please.

654
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:26,944
We're getting out of this house.

655
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:34,818
Did you hear what I said?
I said we are leaving this house!

656
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,182
Well, how can we?

657
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:39,617
How?

658
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,819
We just pack up and go, that's how.

659
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,936
- Ben, will you just let me lock this room up?
- Look Marian, will you stop talking about this room!

660
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:53,337
It's all you ever think of, the room, the house, 
and the old lady.

661
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,068
Well, she depends on me.

662
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:58,274
I'm the only one.

663
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:04,018
There is no one, no one, to take care of her
except me.

664
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,818
Now, you can't expect me to...

665
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:13,493
You're obsessed with it.

666
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:17,189
- All of it.
- I'm not obsessed with it!

667
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,068
Marian, this house is destroying us.

668
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:32,200
Darling, this house is everything
we've always wanted.

669
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:35,205
And it's ours...

670
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:38,599
For as long as...

671
01:27:41,659 --> 01:27:42,999
Marian...

672
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:47,059
Whether you come with us or not...

673
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:49,960
Tomorrow...

674
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:53,058
...we're going back.

675
01:27:53,107 --> 01:27:55,234
Going back? To what?

676
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,999
To what we had.

677
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,331
We had nothing.

678
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,944
And what do you suppose we've got now?

679
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:00,050
- Davey, wake up.
- What?

680
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:02,061
- Wake up, we're leaving.
- What?

681
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:03,891
Somehow the house is...

682
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:05,792
- ...it's changing.
- What?

683
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:09,231
The boards...some of the boards and tiles...

684
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:13,964
...they are being replaced...

685
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:15,994
...by new ones.

686
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:18,204
Now, don't ask me why.
Just get out of here, all right?

687
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:20,246
- But dad, wait a minute.
- Get out!

688
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:49,899
Dad!

689
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:01,148
- Stop it! Stop it!
- You get in there!

690
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:43,527
Oh my God!

691
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:52,598
Stop it, dad! Stop it!

692
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:11,784
Slow down! Wait for mom!

693
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,886
Stop it, please, stop it!

694
01:33:57,431 --> 01:34:01,564
I don't know...
He banged his head or something.

695
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:04,637
He's fine, dear.
I'm going to take you back.

696
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:10,299
You...are accepting this...

697
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:13,337
...because you're part of it!

698
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,623
Are you a part of this?

699
01:34:55,124 --> 01:34:58,523
Dad? Dad, what's wrong? Dad?

700
01:35:17,411 --> 01:35:19,572
Will he be all right, doctor?

701
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:30,388
He's heavily sedated, which means
he'll sleep through the night.

702
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:33,300
But by tomorrow morning I'm afraid 
he's gonna require hospitalisation.

703
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,768
I see.

704
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:39,793
Of course, you understand, we don't have the proper facilities here.
You'll have to take him into the city.

705
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:44,168
But will he be all right, doctor?

706
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:48,537
Well, I'm not a specialist in these matters Mrs. Rolf,
but with the proper care he'll...

707
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:50,633
I'm sure I can give it to him.

708
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,339
If you need me tomorrow
I'll be at my office.

709
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:56,143
- Thank you, doctor.
- I'll see myself out.

710
01:36:08,283 --> 01:36:09,550
Mom?

711
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:12,963
Is dad OK?

712
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,836
Yes, sweetheart. The doctor just said
he needs some more rest.

713
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:23,639
- Feel all right?
- Yeah, I guess.

714
01:36:24,879 --> 01:36:26,813
Can we go home tomorrow?

715
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:33,215
Oh, I don't think so sweetheart.
Daddy will be better off here.

716
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:37,446
- Now, why don't you go to sleep?
- Good night.

717
01:37:08,389 --> 01:37:10,584
Davey, come on out while I fix lunch.

718
01:37:10,771 --> 01:37:13,069
Oh come on mom, I won't
go in the deep end.

719
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:15,524
No, you've been in long enough.
Now, where's your robe?

720
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:18,024
Oh, I think I left it in my room.

721
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:20,965
Well, that's all right. Stay with your father, and I'll
bring it with me.

722
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:52,473
Hey, dad?
Are you OK?

723
01:37:59,139 --> 01:38:01,073
Hey, you wanna see me swim?

724
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:04,972
Look, I'm pretty good now, 
I've been practising all day.

725
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:07,946
You wanna see me go in the deep end?

726
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:10,539
I can swim down there now, you know.

727
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:12,649
Okay? Okay, watch.

728
01:38:12,753 --> 01:38:15,620
I've been practising for you.
Watch this!

729
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,593
Davey! 
Stay away from that end!

730
01:39:11,804 --> 01:39:14,000
Dad? Dad!

731
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,198
Help me!

732
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:53,935
Are you OK..are you all right, honey? OK, darling?

733
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:12,518
I tried ...

734
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,571
Dad! He's talking.

735
01:42:34,615 --> 01:42:40,980
I was afraid I'd have to watch.
...I couldn't...

736
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:47,056
Yes, darling. Of course you couldn't.

737
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:52,290
I hate this place.
I wanna get out of here. I hate it!

738
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:55,494
Davey, we are.

739
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:01,733
We are leaving this place.
Today.

740
01:43:16,957 --> 01:43:18,822
Hey, I thought you said we were gonna go.

741
01:43:18,926 --> 01:43:21,486
- We are, sweetheart. Right now.
- OK.

742
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:33,170
Are you OK?
You're sure?

743
01:43:52,392 --> 01:43:55,623
I forgot to tell Mrs. Allardyce
that we're leaving.

744
01:43:58,134 --> 01:44:02,094
Marian ... please.

745
01:44:03,303 --> 01:44:05,770
I don't want you to go back into that house.

746
01:44:07,307 --> 01:44:08,774
Ben, don't be silly.

747
01:44:09,342 --> 01:44:14,800
We can't just drive off and leave that poor old lady sitting
up there without even telling her we're driving off.

748
01:44:18,151 --> 01:44:22,676
- Come on mom, let's just get out of here, OK?
- Please, I don't want you to go back in.

749
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:25,699
Hey come on fellas, I'll just leave her our number  

750
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:29,217
so she knows where to reach us in case
she needs us, OK?

751
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:31,258
It will just take a moment.

752
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:03,381
Mrs Allardyce?
It's me.

753
01:46:04,925 --> 01:46:06,690
It's Marian.

754
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:30,669
I got to go and get your mother.

755
01:50:02,829 --> 01:50:04,790
Marian, are you in there?

756
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:25,581
Mrs. Allardyce?

757
01:50:52,512 --> 01:50:55,545
I'm sorry, I didn't wish to disturb you,
but I was looking for Marian

758
01:50:55,648 --> 01:51:00,447
She said she was going to come up here
and tell you that we were leaving.

759
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,923
Mrs. Allardyce.

760
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:11,999
Look, I do know that she came up here.

761
01:51:14,467 --> 01:51:18,096
You must have spoken to her.
Would you tell me where she is, please?

762
01:51:22,008 --> 01:51:25,473
Mrs. Allardyce, I am talking to you.
Will you answer me, please.

763
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,475
Will you answer me.
