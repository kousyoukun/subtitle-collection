1
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:45,298
多美呀
风景如画
- Lovely.
- That is for sure.

2
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,273
那么说这里就是乡下喽？
So this is the country?

3
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,675
瞧瞧后座这没见过世面的小孩
Listen to the underprivileged
child back there, will you?

4
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,244
是的，宝贝，第17滨海大道
嗯，我明白了
- There it is, darling. 17 Shore Road.
- Yeah, I got it.

5
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:28,443
还好吗，达维？
很好
- Are you all right, Davey?
- I'm fine.

6
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:30,217
噢，老天！
Oh my God!

7
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:35,789
那里是我们的家吗？
Is that our house?

8
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:39,025
不是，达维，不是的
No Davey, that's not our house.

9
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,791
不可能是我们的房子
It can't be our house.

10
00:01:56,778 --> 00:01:58,395
真是浪费
What a waste.

10
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:06,395

11
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:21,695
看吧，早就说“适宜一大家人居住”
Well, it said "suitable
for a large family".

12
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,035
真的好大！
It's so big!

13
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:28,269
玛丽安
Marian.

14
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:35,768
你不觉得有点蹊跷吗？
这种房子怎么能那么轻易租到...
Will you be sensible, maybe? Now you don't
rent a house like this for a reasonable...

15
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:39,216
我想肯定是另有门房或客房留给我们住...
I mean there must be a gate house
or guest room or something...

16
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,843
不，就是它了
No, this is it.

17
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:46,253
好吧，那就让我们自己动手搞清楚吧
Well there's only one way we
can find out, isn't there.

18
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:51,530
“冲进死亡之谷，六百骠骑向前”
"Onward into the valley of death,
rode the six hundred..."

19
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:04,835
但愿屋里有人
I hope they're in.

20
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:38,290
喔，我们是洛夫一家，是来租避暑房子的
Oh, we're the Rolf's.
We've come about the summer place.

21
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,341
知道，知道，等你们好些日子了！
I know, I know，I've been expecting y'all!

22
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:43,708
我叫沃克，干杂活的，屋里拾掇得跟新的一样样
My name's Walker, and I'm the handyman.
I keep everything spick and span.

23
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:46,976
请进来吧，进来吧太太，进来，快进来吧，小帅哥
Y'all come on in. Come on in, ma'am.
Come on in! Come on in, boy!

24
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,393
感觉怎么样？
喔，真的...
- How d'ya like it?
- Oh, it's...

25
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:05,321
我说，这就是待租的那个房子吗？
Look, is this the place
they're talking about renting?

26
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:06,390
当然了
It sure is!

27
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,109
又可爱，又漂亮，对吧？那么我们去客厅
It's pretty, ain't it? Beautiful, ain't it?
Ya'll come on

28
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:11,362
快来看看客厅，太太
in the sitting room. Come on
in the sittin room, ma'am.

29
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,670
随便逛逛，不要拘束
Just turn around on here, and
make yourself at home right here.

30
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,976
请随意，我去叫内布过来
Just make yourselves right at home,
while I go and get the Neb's.

31
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:24,873
小子，看好家具，知道吗？
Boy, you watch that furniture, ya hear?

32
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:35,385
难以置信
我也是
- I don't believe it.
- Me neither.

33
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:39,224
我能出去浪一会吗？
Can I go outside for a
while and mess around?

34
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:48,599
你就不用来了，你懂的
You don't have to come, you know.

35
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:50,768
我也不想来，你记得不要乱跑，知道了吧？
No I don't want to come, but
you stay around here, right?

36
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:51,571
嗯
OK.

37
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:53,872
- 嘿，听到我说什么了吗？
- 当然听到了
- Hey, you hear what I say?
- Yeah, I heard you.

38
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:04,505
侬拉组撒？
What are you doing?

39
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,706
真是浪费啊！心疼死我了
Such a waste!It kills me.

40
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:19,246
不要咸吃豆腐淡操心了
我忍不住
- You musn't take things so personally.
- I can't help it.

41
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,584
- 达维呢？
- 在外头玩
- Where's Davey?
- He's outside.

42
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:26,594
介意我关门避避味吗？
Do you mind if I shut the
door to keep the stench out?

43
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:27,465
不介意
No.

44
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,832
玛丽安，你瞧这个
Marian, look at this.

45
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,939
- 真是如梦似幻
- 好美
- This is extraordinary.
- How beautiful.

46
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:37,074
对，但都是同一副画！
Yeah, but they're all the same!

47
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:40,210
这副大概是，100年前的？
This one must be what, 100 years old?

48
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:42,810
这个可能是近些年的
This one's quite recent.

49
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:52,584
嗯，但是为啥呢？
Yeah, but why?

50
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,524
他们来了
Here they are!

51
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:59,292
很抱歉让你们久等了
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

52
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:02,222
真是无事不起早
It's been quite a morning.

53
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:08,170
你百忙之中能把镜子搬了吗？都开裂了
If your busy schedule permits, would you
mind taking the mirror out? It's cracked.

54
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,237
- 又不止镜子开裂
- 老傻逼
- Ain't the only thing cracked around here.
- Old fool.

55
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:16,708
死老娘们
Grouchy old bastard.

56
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:26,571
我叫萝丝・阿拉戴斯，我哥哥一会自己过来
I'm Roz Allardyce. My brother will be down
just as soon as he pulls himself together.

57
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,514
吾等是洛夫一家，我叫本
We're the Rolf's.My name is Ben.

58
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:30,483
这是内人玛丽安
My wife, Marian.

59
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:31,991
您好
How do you do.

60
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:33,823
还有个小帅哥，跑哪去了？
There's a boy too, isn't there?

61
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:36,058
嗯，那是犬子达维，在外面花园里玩呢
Yes, our son, David.
He's out in the garden.

62
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:40,659
- 没关系吧？
- 没事儿，小孩子就适合在花园里玩
- Is that all right?
- Oh yes. Children are good for the place.

63
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:47,969
唔，我想可以谈谈细节了吧？
Well, I suppose we'd better
get down to details?

64
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,136
啊，实干的男人，就像我哥一样
Ah, a practical man. Just like brother.

65
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:53,470
广告上说“价格合理”
The ad did say "reasonable".

66
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:57,670
我记得是“非常合理”，对有缘人来说再合适不过了
"Very reasonable", as I recall.
And so it is, for the right people.

67
00:08:00,554 --> 00:08:04,649
唔，假设我们是“有缘人”，您的“合理”大概是指？
Well, assuming we are the "right people",
what would your idea of "reasonable" be?

68
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:09,988
等下，我要先问你们几个问题
Well, I'd like to ask you a few questions first.

69
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:12,326
就你们三个人租吗？
Would you be taking the house by yourselves?

70
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:14,593
唔，不，还有本的姑妈，伊丽莎白
Well, no. There's Ben's aunt, Elizabeth.

71
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:17,827
- 多大了？
- 74了
- How old?
- She's 74.

72
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:22,998
意思是一个老姑娘？身边有个老姑娘你不嫌弃？
An old gal then? You wouldn't mind having an old gal around?

73
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:25,303
噢，当然不，伊丽莎白可优雅了
Oh no.Elizabeth is a doll.

74
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:30,407
你打算从七一建党节租到五一劳动节
And you'll take the place from
the 1st of July until Labour Day

75
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:33,376
这段时间你会打扫好房子吗？
and you'll keep the place and you'll tend it?

76
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:36,379
就我们自己？我是说，自己打扫？
By ourselves? I mean, alone?

77
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:38,315
唔，当然
Well, yes.

78
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,616
我不确定，这屋子太大了
I don't know,
with a house this size

79
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:44,820
只有我妻子一个人，我不知道能不能...
and only my wife, I don't
know that we'd be...

80
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:48,831
房子自己会照顾自己，洛夫先生
The house takes care of itself,Mr. Rolf.

81
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:50,929
相信我
Believe me.

82
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:54,669
我不想就此展开话题但是...
I hate to make an issue of this but...

83
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:58,640
...你会如我和哥哥一般爱这座房子吗？
...will you love the house
as brother and I do?

84
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:02,240
噢，会的，我想会的
Oh yes. I think we will.

85
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:07,583
那么这一块地收你们900块钱
Then we're talking in the
neighbourhood of 900 dollars.

86
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:10,166
我不知道要那么...
Look, I don't know that I'm
going be able to make that...

87
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,175
整个夏天都归你
For the whole Summer.

88
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:15,281
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

89
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:16,682
啊，我哥哥来了
Ah, that's brother.

90
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,783
- 沃克，沃克，看在上帝的份上！
- 哦，亲爱的
- Walker, Walker, for Christ's sake!
- Oh dear.

91
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:23,826
- 稳住稳住，我过来了！
- 该死的电梯又坏了
- Hold your horses, I'm coming!
- The damn stairlift is broken again.

92
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,068
- 它在动，在动！
- 失陪一下
- It's moving! It's moving!
- Excuse me.

93
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:28,861
我要下去！
I want down!

94
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,165
难以置信，对吧？
Unbelievable, isn't it?

95
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:35,033
得来全不费功夫，没问题宝贝，就这样定了吧
It's an absolute steal! There's no
question, is there darling. We'll grab it.

96
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:38,237
- 听着，宝贝，我真的不...
- 但是亲爱的，不要白不要
- Look, sweetheart, I don't really...
- But darling, we'd be crazy not to!

97
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:41,711
如果要了就和他们在一起了，你看看他们，简直...
Well if we were we'd be in step with them,
wouldn't we. Look at them all, they're...

98
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,205
这男的就是个活傻逼，让他滚蛋！
The man's an absolute
idiot, and we've got to

99
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,368
明白吗？明白吗？
get rid of him! Do you understand?
Do you?

100
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:51,551
这是我哥哥阿诺德，如你们所见，精力旺盛
This is my brother, Arnold.
As you can see, he's full of beans today.

101
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:55,659
你们就是要租房子的是吧？
So you are the people who want to
rent this house, is that right?

102
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,231
对，我们刚和令妹谈了价钱
Yes, we were just discussing terms
with your, um, lady.

103
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,395
噢，我喜欢他们，萝丝，我喜欢他们
Oh, I like them Roz, I like them.

104
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,665
- 还有个小男孩
- 是的，是犬子达维
- There's a boy, too.
- Yes, our son, David.

105
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,605
- 他在花园里玩耍呢
- 真的吗？带我瞧瞧
- He's playing in the garden.
- Really? Show me.

106
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,039
快点，萝丝，我想瞧瞧
Hurry, Roz, I want to see.

107
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,307
啊哈，看到了！真是可爱啊
Ah, there he is!Isn't he darling.

108
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,721
噢，上帝，多可爱的小男孩，多大了，八九岁？
Oh God, what a charming little boy.
How old is he, eight or nine?

109
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:28,520
- 都十二了
- 十二了，多萌啊
- No, 12.
- 12? Isn't he sweet.

110
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,460
也是个顽皮鬼，不是吗？
He's full of the Devil too, isn't he?

111
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:40,643
噢很抱歉，也许他不该到处乱跑...
Oh I'm sorry, maybe he
shouldn't be walking around...

112
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:42,935
没事没事，让他玩吧，没关系！
No no, leave him alone, he's fine.
He's just fine!

113
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,670
- 你经常租房子吗？
- 看情况了
- Do you rent often?
- It depends.

114
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:51,155
哦，我妹妹想表达的是
Oh, what my sister's
trying to say is that we

115
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:54,671
我们对休息与闲暇极度渴望
have this desperate need
of rest and relaxation.

116
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:58,812
我都成这样了，你也能看出来...
I'm coming apart, as you can see...

117
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:01,788
- 噢，哥哥...
- 哦吼，哥哥没事
- Oh, brother...
- Oh, brother is right.

118
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:05,319
你喜欢吗？
Well, do you like it?

119
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:08,259
- 我们喜欢
- 真的吗？
- We love it.
- Really?

120
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,697
上帝，告诉他们，哥哥，告诉他们这房子有多么生机勃勃
God, when it comes alive.Tell them, brother.

121
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,662
告诉他们夏天的时候的情况
Tell them what it's like in the Summer.

122
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:17,849
唔，他们不会信的
Well, they'd never believe it.
It's beyond

123
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:20,397
这超出了你们人生的认知范围
anything that you've
ever seen in your life.

124
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:25,644
洛夫太太，这房子有几个世纪了
There's centuries in this room, Mrs. Rolf.

125
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,281
- 到处是岁月的痕迹
- 嗯
- There are years, years in this house.
- Oh yes.

126
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:33,735
当然房子依然还会存在很久
And this house will be
here long, long after

127
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:35,882
即便到你死了还在，相信吗
you have departed,do you believe me.

128
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,217
实际上它是不朽的
It's practically immortal.

129
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:43,790
- 我非常诚挚地相信
- 我也是
- I sincerely believe that.
- So do I.

130
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,160
噢，我想对你们来说可能太搞笑了
Oh, I know that must seem funny to you.

131
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:55,835
但当人们像我和哥哥一样爱这栋房子的时候...
But when people love a house the way
my brother and I love this one...

132
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:59,668
噢，抱歉，我不是故意冒犯，我只是...
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude,
it's just that...

133
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,870
...我在等签协议
...well, I was waiting for the catch.

134
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:04,174
签协议？
Catch?

135
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:08,009
嗯，你要价900块...
Well, you mean it's 900 dollars and...

136
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,245
...这房子就是我们的了？
...and then it's all ours?

137
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:13,552
噢，当然还有一件事
Oh, of course there is one other thing.

138
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,389
- 但不能算入协议之内了
- 当然不是
- But it's hardly a catch.
- No, it's not a catch.

139
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:19,753
我要说的是我的妈妈
It's our mother.

140
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,757
她又怎样？
What about her?

141
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:27,862
一个看着像60的85岁老太太
An 85 year old woman who could pass for 60.

142
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:31,168
眼下她想说的是...
Yes now, what she's trying to say is...

143
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:34,367
我们的妈妈从没有离开过这个房子
that our mother never,
ever leaves the house.

144
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:38,376
实际上她自己房间都没出过，不是吗？
Well she never leaves her
room actually, isn't that so?

145
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:40,650
噢，她不会带来麻烦的
Oh, she'll be no trouble at all.

146
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:47,182
你们都不可能看见她的身影，她一直在睡觉
No, you'll probably never even see her.
She sleeps most of the time.

147
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:50,371
每当她不睡觉的时候
And when she's not
sleeping, she's listening

148
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:52,668
她就听自己的音乐，研究收藏品
to her music or working
on her collection.

149
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:58,626
对，她的图画，照片，收集了几千张
Yes, her pictures, or old photos. You
see, she has literally thousands of them.

150
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,732
都是一生的记忆
Memories of a lifetime.

151
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:04,000
她是我们最亲爱的人
She is our darling.

152
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:07,894
你们要做的只是准备一个托盘，每天三次
And all you'd have to do is
prepare a tray, three times a

153
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:11,105
把它放在她客厅的桌子上即可
day, and just leave it on the table.
In her sitting room.

154
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:14,247
这个...
Look...

155
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:20,248
如果我们回家商榷一下再定，您介意吗...
Do you mind very much if we go home,
maybe think about it and let you know...

156
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,983
- 本，别这样！
- 非常感谢
- Ben, no!
- Thank you very much.

157
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:25,424
- 妈妈
- 达维？
- Mom.
- Davey?

158
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,326
达维，怎么回事？
Davey, what happened?

159
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:31,956
- 我弄破了膝盖
- 看起来好脏
- I just cut my knee.
- That looks nasty!

160
00:13:32,065 --> 00:13:35,501
- 怎么回事？
- 我从上面摔下来了
- What happened there?
- I fell off a thing out there.

161
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:38,605
你最好冲洗一下他的伤口
You better wash off his poor little cuts.

162
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:41,965
我们去厨房去
Let's go out to the kitchen.

163
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,341
- 来吧，我有一些绷带和药品
- 走吧亲爱的
- Come on, I have some band-aids.
- Come on, darling.

164
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:02,182
你拿着植物到哪去？
Where are you going with that plant?

165
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:05,897
胡西说它已经死了！
Josie said it was dead!

166
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:08,160
是吗？
Did she?

167
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,559
看仔细了
Well look again.

168
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,670
哈！还没死透
Huh! Ain't that somethin'.

169
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:34,479
我想你太过粗鲁了
I thought you were impossibly rude.

170
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:37,686
是吗？
Was I?

171
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,963
噢得了宝贝，里面都大的能捉蝴蝶了
Oh come on, sweetheart. Someone should
go in there with a large butterfly net.

172
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:45,466
他们得意忘形了，就这些
They got carried away,
that's all.

173
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:49,099
不是，不是
Not yet, they didn't.

174
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:59,008
你不可能900块就租得到
You do not rent an estate
like that for 900 dollars.

175
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:00,642
为什么？
Why not?

176
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:03,792
他们醉翁之意不在钱
Maybe they're not
interested in money. Maybe

177
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:06,113
可能只是想找人料理房子
they want someone who'll
take care of the place.

178
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:07,221
租吧
Just be there.

179
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:10,583
好吧，但是你不会想和一个90岁的老女人...
Well all right, maybe. But you don't need
a 90 year old woman just to...

180
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,591
85岁
85.

181
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:16,151
85和185岁有区别吗？
85 or 185, what's the difference.

182
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:19,859
你不会把一个老人留给两个陌生人的
You don't leave an old lady like that
with two complete strangers.

183
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:26,161
你不用担心她，我来照顾她
You wouldn't have to worry about her.
She'd be my responsibility.

184
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:30,775
- 哦，对，那她要快死了呢？
- 噢上帝
- Oh yeah, sure. And what if she's to die?
- Oh my God.

185
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:44,045
这房子对你真那么有意义吗？
Does it really mean that much to you?

186
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:47,551
你自己知道
You know it does.

187
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:50,661
我会坚强的
I'll survive.

188
00:15:55,733 --> 00:16:00,345
问题是...我也会坚强的
The question is... will
I be able to survive.

189
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,381
我是阿拉戴斯
Allardyce.

190
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:19,481
你好，洛夫先生
Yes, Mr. Rolf.

191
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:24,383
干的漂亮，我哥哥会很开森的
Marvellous.
Brother will be so pleased!

192
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:27,344
七一建党节
July 1st.

193
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:31,694
我们会准备好一切的，谢谢，再见
We'll have everything ready.
Thank you. Bye.

194
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:56,180
- 回来这里感觉好吗？
- 不！这一切让我很麻木
- Are you comfortable back there?
- No! Just about everything in me is numb!

195
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:00,217
除了你的嘴，姑妈
Except of course your mouth, auntie.

196
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,798
噢，小本，我忘了说了，我更新了驾照许可证
Oh Benji, I forgot to tell you.
I renewed my learner's permit.

197
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,595
我下了决心了
I am determined this time.

198
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:11,671
好吧，我必须承认我很欣赏您的坚持，姑妈
Well, I must admit I admire
your persistence, auntie.

199
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:15,674
当然我的坚持正是我依然貌美如花的原因
Well my persistence is the reason
I have flourished this long.

200
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,201
你要做的就是，姑妈，开车时学会放松
All you've got to do, auntie,
is learn to relax at the wheel.

201
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:24,716
我一直都很放松，倒是考官太紧张了！
I always relax at the wheel.
I get nervous inspectors!

202
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:58,081
我们有很多房间
We'll have lots of room.

203
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:05,150
我不会落下它的
I can't get over it.

204
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:07,352
很美，是不是
Beautiful, isn't it.

205
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:15,337
看起来荒废了
Looks deserted.

206
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:18,228
不可能吧
Can't be.

207
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:35,482
怎么了，什么事？
What's the matter, something wrong?

208
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,318
他们已经走了
They had to leave.

209
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:41,716
走了？
Leave?

210
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:54,127
“安心的住下来，什么也不用操心。阿诺德和萝丝・阿拉戴斯”
"Enjoy the house and don't worry about
anything. Arnold and Roz Allardyce. "

211
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,966
- 我勒了个去
- 勒的对，这太扯了
- Jesus Christ.
- I know, it's crazy.

212
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,438
万一出了什么事，我们怎么联系他们呢？
What if something goes wrong,
where do we reach them?

213
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,532
老人家向来做一些疯狂的事情
They do crazy things sometimes, old people.

214
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,410
是的，但是这两个是疯狂界的翘楚了
Yes they do, don't they.
But these two are two steps beyond crazy.

215
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,216
- 那老太太怎么办？
- 我会照顾她
- And what about the old lady?
- I'll look in on her.

216
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,080
你说的，这是你的责任，达维！提包过来
You do that. It's your department.
David! Bags.

217
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:40,376
- 玛丽安，我不敢相信了！
- 都是我们的
- Marian, I can't believe it!
- And it's all ours.

218
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:43,536
稍等一下
Be right there.

219
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:00,952
阿拉戴斯女士？
Mrs. Allardyce?

220
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:07,055
我是玛丽安・洛夫，我们是新来的租客
It's Marian Rolf.
We're the new tenants.

221
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:11,323
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

222
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:17,827
你需要点什么吗？
Is there anything you need?

223
00:22:26,968 --> 00:22:28,902
一辈子的记忆都在这儿了
Memories of a lifetime.

224
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:42,302
玛丽安，你在哪？
Marian, where are you?

225
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:57,119
- 你上去干嘛？
- 我端走她的盘子
- What have you been doing up there?
- I've been getting her tray.

226
00:23:57,453 --> 00:24:00,388
- 你看到她了？长啥样子？
- 她在睡觉
- Have you seen her? What's she like?
- She's asleep.

227
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:02,352
我们晚点上来看她
We'll see her later.

228
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:08,919
听着，包括你
Now, listen. Both of you.

229
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:12,327
楼上除了我谁也别上去，知道了吗？
These stairs are out of bounds
to anyone but me, all right?

230
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:16,803
阿拉戴斯女士已经非常老了，照顾她是我的责任
Mrs. Allardyce is a very old lady
and she's my responsibility.

231
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,873
我不想任何人打搅她
I don't want anyone bothering her.

232
00:24:22,843 --> 00:24:24,071
遵命
Crushing.

233
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:27,773
- 大家伙过来看看我发现了什么！
- 瞎吵吵什么玩意儿？
- Hey you guys! Come see what I found!
- What are you talking about?

234
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:30,544
来，我带你们去！在厨房里！
Come on, I'll show you!
It's in the kitchen!

235
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,141
我们去看看
Let's go look.

236
00:24:33,654 --> 00:24:38,387
这些钟没一个可以工作，真可惜，它们都相当可爱
None of the clocks are working.
It's a pity, they're all so lovely.

237
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:41,685
也许需要上发条，等下我来弄好
Probably need winding.
Just wait til I get to work.

238
00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:44,821
你迫不及待想穿上你的护膝和护裆，是不是
You can't wait to get into your
knee pads and jock straps, can you.

239
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,899
- 小本！
- 噢，姑妈
- Benji!
- Oh auntie.

240
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,132
很棒吧？
Isn't it great?

241
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:59,540
- 绝赞
- 伊丽莎白姑妈，看这个！
- Great.
- Aunt Elizabeth, look at this!

242
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:05,875
瓦屋，啥都有！
My God, it's got everything!

243
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:11,681
小本，给你交代个任务，这儿需要新灯泡
Benji, here's your first job!
Needs a new bulb.

244
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,149
好的
Right.

245
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:16,854
他们是不是很疯狂啊宝贝?
他们真怪，嗯？
So they're crazy are they, darling?
So they're weird, huh?

246
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:19,930
是的，这是种我可以与之共舞的疯狂
Yeah well, this is the kind
of crazy I can live with.

247
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,698
- 该死..
- 小本!在孩子面前...
- God damn it..
- Benji! In front of the child...

248
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:26,927
我去给阿拉戴斯夫人送午餐，好吗？
I'll go see about Mrs.
Allardyce's lunch, OK? You

249
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,863
你们尽情吃三明治...
guys just fix a nice
spread of sandwiches...

250
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:32,601
- 好极了，把它给我！
- 我总是说他慷他人之慨
- Marvellous, give it to me!
- I always said he had it down.

251
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:40,980
你们看见这些古董了吗？
Did you see those antiques?

252
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:42,779
我想我看见一些叮当了！
Hey, I think I see some Ding Dongs!

253
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:45,753
伊丽莎白姑妈，你以前见过这么多贵重古董吗？
<i>Aunt Elizabeth, did you ever see
so many priceless antiques?</i>

254
00:25:45,956 --> 00:25:47,846
真的是叮当！
Hey, they are Ding Dongs!

255
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,849
整整一箱！
A whole case of them!

256
00:25:50,993 --> 00:25:53,553
敬这房子一杯，怎么样？
<i>How about a little
toast to the house, eh?</i>

257
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:07,310
- 嘿，奴隶！
- 嗨！
- Hey, slave!
- Hi!

258
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:12,395
太奇妙了，你做了啥？
This is fantastic,
what have you been doing?

259
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,694
你从哪里找到这些地毯的？
Where did you get this from?

260
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:16,500
就是和卷着靠墙的是同一张
That is the same one that was rolled up
against the wall.

261
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:18,507
你喜欢吗？这可贵重了
You like it?
It's worth a fortune.

262
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:20,270
- 我来拿
- 谢谢宝贝
- I'll get that.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

263
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,174
我们离开后你独自做了这么多？
You did all this by yourself since we left?

264
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:25,339
楼上还有更多呢，你们去镇上怎么样？
And there's more upstairs, I'll
have you know. How was town?

265
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:27,707
棒极了...
Oh, it was great, great...

266
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:30,943
乌有之都，如果你懂我说的
Capital of nowhere, if
you know what I mean.

267
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:34,854
- 把这些袋子放厨房里
- 遵命“把这些袋子放厨房里”
- Put those sacks in the kitchen.
- Yeah, "put the bags in the kitchen"

268
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:38,985
你怎么不来看我们的游泳池？应该是非常开心的事情
Hey why don't you come and watch us fix the
pool, that should be some kind of a laugh.

269
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:40,587
忙着呢！
Busy, busy, busy!

270
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,419
你还没搞好吗？
Aren't you finished with that thing yet?

271
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:11,922
听着，既然你辣么聪明，为什么不自己上来修？
Listen, if you're so God damn smart why
don't you come up here and fix it yourself?

272
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:14,426
达维,示范给你老爸怎么弄
Davey, go show your father
how to do it.

273
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,421
好吧，我来！
All right then, I will!

274
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:21,058
你别私下破坏我作为父亲伟岸的形象好吗，老熟女？
Will you quit trying to undermine
my parental authority, old lady?

275
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,897
总好过在下面铲污垢
Rather that than go down there and
shoving it up of that old sewer.

276
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,373
所以我想让它可以工作起来
Yeah, which is kind of why I'm
trying to get this model work.

277
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,672
- 老爸
- 嗯
- Father.
- Yeah.

278
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,111
过来，加油！
Come here. Come on, come here!

279
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:43,115
机器上有个小玩意叫隔断器
See, there's a little object on
this machines called a cut off.

280
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,415
在这里，试试看
There it is.
Go on, try it.

281
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,057
- 你觉得它还可以工作？
- 我打赌一定可以
- Do you think it will work?
- I'll bet on it.

282
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,861
- 赌什么？
- 5美金
- How much will you bet?
- 5 dollars.

283
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,503
小本,你就是个机械天才！
Benji, you're a mechanical genius!

284
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:30,529
快看，是墓地！
Hey look, it's a graveyard!

285
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:57,283
老爸！嘿，看看我发现了什么！一部旧单车！
Hey dad! Hey, come look what I found!
It's an old bike!

286
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:05,062
你知道吗，达维?这些都是阿拉戴斯家的
You know something, Davey?
They're all Allardyce's.

287
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:09,495
我找不到一个比1890年更晚的墓碑了
And I haven't been able to find
one any newer than the 1890's.

288
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:11,503
有点阴森是吗？
Bit spooky, eh?

289
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:18,202
你想吃糖吗，小家伙？
Would you like some candy, little boy?

290
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:22,702
别缠着我！
Leave me alone!

291
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:25,811
你跑不掉的，小男孩！哈哈！
You can't run away from
me, little boy! Ha ha ha!

292
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,774
阿拉戴斯夫人？
Mrs. Allardyce?

293
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:04,014
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

294
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:07,022
我很担心你
I am very worried about you.

295
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:10,524
我们已经过来一周了，而你什么都也没吃
We've been here over a week,
and you've barely eaten anything.

296
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:15,087
是不是你不喜欢我做的菜呢？
Is it that you don't like
what I've been bringing

297
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,062
是萝丝夫人叫我给您送饭的
you? It's what Roz
wanted me to give you.

298
00:31:21,704 --> 00:31:25,662
您晚上自己下来厨房吃了？您一直这么做吗？
Do you go down to the kitchen at night?
Is that's what you've been doing?

299
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:29,605
阿拉戴斯夫人，至少您也得说句话
Mrs. Allardyce,
if you would at least speak to me.

300
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:49,853
妈妈呢？她不是说跟我们一起来吗？
Where's mom? She said she was
gonna come with us, didn't she?

301
00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:52,057
额，你知道你妈妈不会来的
Yeah well, you know your mother don't you.

302
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:54,331
还在坚持抽烟？
How's your wind hanging on?

303
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,769
比不了从前了
Not what it used to be.

304
00:31:57,305 --> 00:32:00,535
- 你抽太多烟了，知道吗？
- 我知道
- You smoke too much, you know that?
- I know.

305
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:02,872
并且我还酗酒
And I drink too much.

306
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:07,078
我是一个淫荡的老女人，肯定活不到80了
And I am a lecherous old lady
and I'll never make 80.

307
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:38,740
你在游泳池里加了消毒剂了吗？我是说，你知道它可以除菌的
Did you put the chlorine in the pool?
I mean, you know that does kill the germs.

308
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:41,317
嗯嗯，我对细菌不太感兴趣
Yeah well, I'm not too
interested in the germs.

309
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,712
小屁孩你看，我在跟着一条奸诈的海蛇
You see, it's the sea
serpent I'm after, boy.

310
00:32:45,537 --> 00:32:47,505
那么我们啥时候可以游泳啊？
Well, when can we go swimming?

311
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:52,282
为啥不先去问问你老母
Why don't you go and ask your mother first.

312
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,858
去吧，快去快去快去！
我在走呢
- Go on, double double double!
- I'm going.

313
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:38,627
妈妈！
<i>Hey mom!</i>

314
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,295
嘿妈妈，你在上面吗？
<i>Hey mom, are you up there?</i>

315
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:46,966
我们该去游泳了，妈妈
<i>It's time to go swimming with us, mom.</i>

316
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:02,048
我哪也找不到她，我翻遍整个屋子了！
I couldn't find her anywhere.
I searched the whole house!

317
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:04,885
别急，她可能在厕所
Don't worry,
she's probably on the john.

318
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:24,341
很腻害吧？
Isn't that great?

319
00:34:42,893 --> 00:34:44,724
这个跳水动作我给满分，爸爸！
That was a great dive, dad!

320
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:48,264
- 噢小本，你应该去参加奥运会
- 就是，就是。。
- Oh Benji, you should be in the Olympics.
- Right, right...

321
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:04,770
嘿，那是啥？
Hey, what is that?

322
00:35:07,516 --> 00:35:09,381
啥也没有啊，啥也没有
Nothing boy, nothing.

323
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:12,119
别急我马上过来！
Yeah well, I'm coming out!

324
00:35:12,221 --> 00:35:14,587
小伙子，你也许是个优秀的球手
All right Benny, you
might be a great ball

325
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,088
但是你划得像块石头，明白吗？
player, but you float
like a rock, got that?

326
00:35:17,426 --> 00:35:19,519
知道啦，我会把握好的
Yeah well, I'm coming out anyhow.

327
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:25,230
达维！那是深水区！
Davey!
That is deep water!

328
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:27,200
别再卖弄了
Now stop showing off.

329
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,233
爸爸，我是海蛇！
Dad, it's a sea serpent!

330
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:40,539
不，不，救命！
No no, help!

331
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:53,990
- 想玩玩吗达维？
- 好哇
- Wanna play then Davey, eh?
- Yeah.

332
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:55,788
- 玩啥，傻老爸？
- 看好了
- What is it, witless?
- OK.

333
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:58,295
你就抓住我的肩膀，好吗？
You clutch on my shoulders, OK?

334
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:04,296
本，不要！
Ben, no!

335
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:07,087
真好玩！
That was fun!

336
00:36:07,088 --> 00:36:10,000
- 你喜欢这样？想再来一次吗？
- 好
- You like that? Wanna do it again?
- OK.

337
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,775
好了，你们俩，玩够了
All right now, you two.
It's quite enough.

338
00:36:19,984 --> 00:36:22,646
小本，你比被宠坏的孩子还要糟糕
Benji, you're worse
than a spoiled child.

339
00:36:22,754 --> 00:36:25,689
- 确实有点难度
- 你喜欢吗，达维？
- That was really hard.
- You like that, Davey?

340
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:56,780
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

341
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:04,482
小本，停下！
Benji, stop it!

342
00:37:08,597 --> 00:37:12,426
本，天啊！你在伤害他！
Ben, my God!
You're hurting him!

343
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:33,512
本，现在是凌晨两点
Ben, it's after 2:00.

344
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:37,419
是嘛？
Is it?

345
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:42,586
你睡着了吗？
Did you sleep?

346
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,991
- 嗯，睡了会
- 回去继续睡吧？
- Yeah, some.
- Want to come back and try again?

347
00:40:48,503 --> 00:40:50,164
额，也许过一会儿吧
Well, in a while maybe.

348
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:00,813
- 你不能在这抽烟，好吗？
- 为啥！这房子不允许？
- You don't have to smoke in here, do you?
- Why, is it wrong for the room?

349
00:41:06,353 --> 00:41:08,548
本，你不是故意伤害达维的
Ben. You didn't mean to hurt Davey.

350
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,787
- 只是玩得有点过头了
- 玩过头了。。。
- The roughhouse just got out of hand.
- Roughhouse...

351
00:41:13,928 --> 00:41:16,361
你当时不在，玛丽安，佛祖啊
You weren't there Marian, for Christ sake.

352
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:19,397
是，我不在
No, I wasn't.

353
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:23,764
对不起，你知道吗
I'm sorry, you see...

354
00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:29,706
我脑子里净想这事，没办法忘记
It's all I can think of.
I can't get it out of my head.

355
00:41:31,478 --> 00:41:33,377
本，我懂你
Ben, I know you.

356
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:37,240
- 所以我知道你不是故意的
- 我特么肯定不是故意的，玛丽安！
- So I know you didn't mean to do that.
- The hell I didn't, Marian!

357
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:40,318
我有那个念头想伤害他，你懂吗？有那念头
I wanted to hurt him, do you
understand that? I wanted to hurt him.

358
00:41:40,419 --> 00:41:45,644
你在自责，达维没事了，他很好！
You're punishing yourself.
Davey is all right. He's all right!

359
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:51,690
如果这事比你想的严重得多呢？
What if it's more serious
than you think it is?

360
00:41:53,464 --> 00:41:55,056
你啥意思？
What do you mean?

361
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:02,868
我做过的关于我妈妈的梦。。你懂得。。
Those dreams I had about
my mother's... you know...

362
00:42:05,642 --> 00:42:07,371
他们又回来了，玛丽安
...they're coming back, Marian.

363
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,977
亲爱的，那是多久前了啊
Darling, that was such
a very long time ago.

364
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:20,784
你没做错什么，完全没错
There's nothing wrong with you.
Absolutely nothing.

365
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:44,699
天啊！
My God!

366
00:43:45,737 --> 00:43:51,247
这全变了，又变成崭新的了
It's completely changed.
It's all new again.

367
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:05,677
这都是你的，喜欢吗？
It's all yours.
You like it?

368
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:09,885
嗯，绝赞
Yeah, it's great.

369
00:44:09,993 --> 00:44:12,938
我拿走了电视，它不适合这里
I took away the television, it
was wrong for the room anyway.

370
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:15,246
你应该原谅情绪
You should
forgive the expression.

371
00:44:19,602 --> 00:44:22,331
我们现在要做的就是找点事给我做
All we've got to do now
is just find something for me to do.

372
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:25,338
哦亲爱的，有好多事可以做呢
Oh darling, there's loads for you to do.

373
00:44:25,674 --> 00:44:29,041
现在是合适的时间开始攻读你的博士学位
Now's a good a time as any
to start on your doctorate.

374
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,479
- 本，没事的，是吧
- 什么，那个房间？
- Benji. It's all right, isn't it?
- What, the room?

375
00:44:37,652 --> 00:44:42,244
不，昨天，过了很久了
No, yesterday.
It's a long time ago.

376
00:44:42,757 --> 00:44:45,851
我们忘掉它从头再来吧，嗯？
Let's just forget it
and start over again, OK?

377
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:59,463
噢，多好啊，达维决定开始作画
Oh, how nice.
David has decided to take up painting.

378
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:02,304
我们要去找一处景色
We're off to search out a view.

379
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,010
嗨，达维
Hi, Davey.

380
00:45:16,855 --> 00:45:21,516
- 你还好吧？
- 挺好的
- How is everything?
- Okay.

381
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:27,259
- 你带你的画了吗，Davey？
- 带了
- Did you take your paints, Davey?
- Yeah.

382
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:35,249
- 我们还是朋友吧？
- 哦爸爸！
- We're still friends?
- Oh dad!

383
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:41,946
- 我再也不想去那游泳池了
- 不，你不必去，达维
- I never want to go back to that pool.
- No, you won't have to Davey.

384
00:45:42,387 --> 00:45:44,718
我保证你不会去
I promise you won't have to.

385
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:26,580
没有你抱着我我睡不着
I don't like going to bed without you.

386
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:32,721
我在这下面呆了一段时间了
It's been a while since I was down here.

387
00:46:34,195 --> 00:46:36,388
- 不是吗？
- 是的，我知道
- Hasn't it?
- Yes, I know.

388
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:52,558
至少过滤机看上去有用，不是吗？
Well, at least the filter seems
to be working, doesn't it?

389
00:46:52,571 --> 00:46:54,633
对，归因于一个天才
Yes, attribute to a genius.

390
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,247
剩下的，都是。。
The rest of it, it's all...

391
00:47:00,086 --> 00:47:01,849
看上去都是。。
It seems to be all...

392
00:47:01,954 --> 00:47:03,717
柠檬油的味道？
Smell of lemon oil?

393
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:08,423
我拔杂草，我抛光镀铬，我擦洗水泥地
I plucked the weeds, I polished the chrome.
I scrubbed the concrete.

394
00:47:11,363 --> 00:47:13,024
那是啥，宝贝？
What is it, honey?

395
00:47:15,534 --> 00:47:18,128
你知道我不得不下来这。。
Do you know I had to come down here to...

396
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:20,868
来看你是否胜任
...well, to see if I could.

397
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,772
我觉得我们会把这一切都忘掉
I thought we were going to
forget about all that.

398
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:30,776
我们试过了，不是吗？
We tried, didn't we.

399
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:41,990
你似乎有点神经不正常
You seem to have landed
yourself with a bit of a kook.

400
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:43,623
额，那就是我俩的区别
Well, that makes two of us.

401
00:47:49,899 --> 00:47:52,732
看起来不可思议，你为啥不跳进去？
Looks marvellous,
why don't you jump in?

402
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:58,932
- 你会跟我一起吗？
- 噢，我没穿我的大衣
- Will you come with me?
- Oh, I don't have my suit.

403
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:02,740
那你为什么不把你的衣服脱了？
Well then, why don't you
take your clothes off?

404
00:48:05,447 --> 00:48:07,176
如果我先走呢？
What if I go first?

405
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:18,557
下来吧，这很棒
Come on in.
It's great.

406
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,891
- 这算在治疗吗？
- 是的，算
- Will it aid in the therapy?
- It'll aid the therapy.

407
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:25,826
噢，为何不呢
Oh, why not.

408
00:48:28,102 --> 00:48:29,867
来吧
Everything.

409
00:48:44,584 --> 00:48:45,642
过来
Come here.

410
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,684
很久没有访客了
It's been a long time between visits.

411
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,784
我怀念他们
I miss them.

412
00:49:05,538 --> 00:49:07,767
现在不适合干那事吧，亲爱的
None of that stuff now, honey.

413
00:49:08,606 --> 00:49:10,335
一点水上运动
A little water sport.

414
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:13,734
对新陈代谢很有好处，亲爱的
It's very good for the
circulation, you know.

415
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,345
我的代谢很正常
My circulation's fine.

416
00:49:23,855 --> 00:49:25,185
回来！
Come back!

417
00:49:26,223 --> 00:49:28,555
- 玛丽安
- 我跟不上你的生活节奏
- Marian?
- Not on your life.

418
00:49:45,308 --> 00:49:49,010
听着，我没说过这在13年后会爆炸
Look, I'm not saying it's going to be
dynamite after 13 years.

419
00:49:50,179 --> 00:49:53,671
但是肯定的是一些兴奋的表象。。
But surely some semblance of excitement...

420
00:50:03,024 --> 00:50:07,461
我不明白什么突然使我变得令人憎恶
I can't work out what's made me
so repulsive all of a sudden.

421
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,461
令人憎恶？
Repulsive?

422
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,700
你很性感
You're incredibly sexy.

423
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:51,195
本，我并不想这样！
Ben, I don't want to!

424
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:56,303
别在这，别在这，不要
Not here. Not here, you can't.

425
00:50:59,111 --> 00:51:01,203
玛丽安，佛祖啊
Marian, for God's sake.

426
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:03,737
拜托，你不明白
Please. You don't understand.

427
00:51:04,449 --> 00:51:07,383
你一定没明白，求你了！
You mustn't. Please!

428
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,000
早上好！
Morning!

429
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:50,219
- 你在哪找到它的？
- 大厅壁橱里
- Where did you get that?
- Hall closet.

430
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:52,747
这所房子充满宝藏
This house is full of treasures.

431
00:52:54,886 --> 00:52:58,083
你整晚没上床，对吗？
You didn't come to bed at
all last night, did you?

432
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,950
在游泳池那的事之后
After the pool...

433
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:09,555
我去了阿拉戴斯女士的房间看看她是否需要什么
I went up to Mrs. Allardyce's room
to see if she needed anything.

434
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:12,656
我不知道怎么的
And I don't know how it
happened, I just fell

435
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:15,270
就在一把椅子里睡着了，我猜可能太累了
asleep in a wing chair. I
guess I was pretty tired.

436
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,743
你要去哪？
Where are you going?

437
00:53:27,817 --> 00:53:31,514
噢，我要去。。修理发动机什么的
Oh, I'm going to... trim
the drive or something.

438
00:54:05,286 --> 00:54:07,880
你咋了？都快吃午饭了
Well what happened to you?
It's nearly lunchtime.

439
00:54:07,988 --> 00:54:11,855
我去！就不能允许别人睡个懒觉吗？
Goodness! Can't anyone ever
oversleep in this family?

440
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:15,009
我只是觉得这并不像你，姑妈
I just mean it's not like
you, aunt Elizabeth.

441
00:54:15,022 --> 00:54:17,009
你比我们都有活力
You've got more energy
than any of us.

442
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:21,455
曾经有，我恐怕这个暑假把我榨干了
Had. I'm afraid this Summer
vacation is wearing me out.

443
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:25,402
太多阳光，你为何不在树荫下面作画？
Too much sun.
Why don't you try painting in the shade?

444
00:54:26,406 --> 00:54:29,597
天啊！我需要去美容院
My God!I need a beauty parlour.

445
00:54:32,611 --> 00:54:34,540
别傻了
Don't be silly.

446
00:54:37,049 --> 00:54:39,609
我不是唯一一个可以用美容院的人
I'm not the only one who could use
the beauty parlour.

447
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,427
你的头发白了不少，玛丽安
You're getting quite a bit
of grey in your hair, Marian.

448
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,312
我知道
I know.

449
00:54:43,856 --> 00:54:46,207
我估计我要变成第二个玛丽阿姨了
I think I take after my aunt Mary.

450
00:54:46,724 --> 00:54:50,251
你知道吗，她33岁就头发全白了
You know, she went entirely grey
by the time she was 33.

451
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:55,424
噢！达维一直在找你，他想去野炊
Oh! Davey's been looking for you.
He wants to go hiking.

452
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,635
笑神马？
What's funny?

453
00:54:59,036 --> 00:55:01,402
噢，好吧，你知道我现在想干嘛吗？
Oh, me. Do you know what
I want to do right now?

454
00:55:01,415 --> 00:55:02,207
不知道
No?

455
00:55:03,306 --> 00:55:05,900
我只想回去睡觉
I want to go right back up to bed.

456
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,637
- 那难道不糟糕吗？
- 当然不会
- Isn't that awful?
- Certainly not.

457
00:55:11,214 --> 00:55:14,843
为啥你不上那去打个盹？那样对你好些
Why don't you go up there and take a nap?
It'll be good for you.

458
00:55:19,255 --> 00:55:20,745
也许我会的
Maybe I will.

459
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,782
玛德，我不会！
Damn it, I won't!

460
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,425
哦我的耶稣佛祖啊，伊丽莎白，你咋回事啊？
Oh for Heaven's sake, Elizabeth,
what is wrong with you?

461
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:08,089
阿拉戴斯夫人？
Mrs. Allardyce?

462
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,258
我能进来吗？
May I come in?

463
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,428
玛丽安，我不知道你在这
Marian, I didn't know you were in there.

464
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,327
你咋不睡了？
What happened to your nap?

465
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:22,333
我想是时候介绍我自己给我们的恩人了
Well I thought it about time I
introduced myself to our benefactor.

466
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:24,102
她在睡觉
She's asleep.

467
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:27,131
噢，糟糕
Oh, that's too bad.

468
00:57:27,609 --> 00:57:31,807
我觉得她会喜欢我的画的
I thought she might enjoy seeing
my picture.

469
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,107
当然会的，等她醒过来之后
I'm sure she would dear, when she's awake.

470
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,827
伊丽莎白,我现在进退维谷
Elizabeth, I'm right in
the middle of something.

471
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,784
噢对不起亲爱的，我无意打断你们
Oh I'm sorry dear, I didn't
mean to interrupt anything.

472
00:57:42,923 --> 00:57:46,020
- 你告诉她我来拜访过
- 我知道她会高兴的
- You tell her I came to visit.
- I know she'll appreciate it.

473
00:57:46,227 --> 00:57:49,553
- 如果她想有人陪的话。。
- 我会让她知道的，好吗？
- And if she ever wants any company...
- I'll let her know. OK?

474
00:57:51,464 --> 00:57:53,056
小心台阶
Well, be careful on the steps.

475
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:57,361
现在回去工作吧，我会没事的
Now you just go back to your work.
I'll be all right.

476
01:01:49,483 --> 01:01:50,853
达维！
Davey!

477
01:02:23,587 --> 01:02:25,851
- 咋的了？咋回事？
- 煤气中毒
- What is it, what's wrong?
- Gas.

478
01:02:26,823 --> 01:02:30,486
- 老天爷啊！他还好吗？
- 还好，还有呼吸
- Oh my God! Well is he all right!?
- Yes, he's breathing.

479
01:02:31,428 --> 01:02:32,986
吸气，儿子
Breathe in, boy.

480
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:42,533
来，扶着他，我去去就回
Here, hold him. I'll be right back.

481
01:02:45,074 --> 01:02:46,184
快呼吸空气
Breathe the air now.

482
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:20,640
- 你还好吗，达维？
- 我觉得他好些了
- Are you all right, Davey?
- I think he's better.

483
01:03:21,909 --> 01:03:23,706
发生什么了，小本？
What has happened, Benji?

484
01:03:24,712 --> 01:03:26,475
那个该死的煤气暖炉。。
That damn gas heater...

485
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:32,177
我不明白，这是怎么搞的？怎么会这样？
I just don't understand how it happened.
How could it have happened?

486
01:03:44,263 --> 01:03:46,253
吃过早饭了吗姑妈？
Have you had any breakfast, dear?

487
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:49,891
不，我又睡过头了，羞耻啊。。
No, I overslept again.
A disgrace.

488
01:03:50,936 --> 01:03:53,564
- 达维怎么样了？
- 噢，一切都好
- How is Davey?
- Oh, everything's fine.

489
01:03:53,672 --> 01:03:57,372
本从镇里打电话过来，达维没事了，佛祖保佑
Ben called from town.
Davey's all right, thank God.

490
01:03:57,976 --> 01:04:00,638
我难以想象他会有多害怕
I can't imagine how frightened I was.

491
01:04:01,947 --> 01:04:03,538
可怜的小达维
Poor little Davey.

492
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,915
我想对你说的是我没碰过那个暖炉
I want you to know
I didn't touch that heater.

493
01:04:15,493 --> 01:04:18,893
- 你当然没有，姑妈
- 如果我做了，我会记得的
- Well of course you didn't, dear.
- If I did, I'd remember.

494
01:04:20,563 --> 01:04:25,192
- 没人说是你啊
- 我只是给他盖了被子，就这样
- Nobody said you did.
- I just covered him, that's all.

495
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:29,102
你给它盖了被子？你是说你昨晚在他房里？
You covered him? You mean you
were in David's room last night?

496
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,574
是的，我去看了看他，有时我睡不着
Yes, I looked in on him.
Sometimes I don't sleep.

497
01:04:36,545 --> 01:04:39,309
你到底在他房里干啥了？伊丽莎白
Exactly what did you do
in his room, Elizabeth?

498
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:44,151
我说了，我给他盖了被子，昨晚很冷
I told you, I just covered him.
It was cold.

499
01:04:44,386 --> 01:04:46,820
这个房子变得非常冷
This house is getting so cold.

500
01:04:47,689 --> 01:04:50,180
你知道的，达维的门总是开着的
You know, David's door
is always open.

501
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:52,793
但是昨晚门锁了
Last night it was locked.

502
01:04:55,396 --> 01:04:56,988
嗯，我可没锁
Well, I didn't lock it.

503
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:00,996
我除了毯子其他什么都没碰过
The only thing I touched
was the blanket.

504
01:05:05,573 --> 01:05:07,734
那是我唯一记得的事
Well, that's all I remember doing.

505
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:11,770
好吧，你没有锁上门，是门自己把自己锁起来的！
All right, you didn't lock it.
It locked itself!

506
01:05:12,879 --> 01:05:14,972
那窗户呢？
Now what about the windows?

507
01:05:15,982 --> 01:05:17,176
窗户是开着的
They were open.

508
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:21,220
本进去之后窗户可是关着的，你搞搞清楚，伊丽莎白！
They were closed when Ben walked into
that room. Now make sense, Elizabeth!

509
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:24,113
我怎么搞？
How can I?

510
01:05:25,925 --> 01:05:31,287
你不停的吼我，骂我，我怎么搞得清楚？
How can I... when you keep
shouting at me and accusing me?

511
01:05:31,797 --> 01:05:34,305
我没有骂你
I'm not accusing you.

512
01:05:37,236 --> 01:05:38,601
本去哪儿了？
Where's Ben?

513
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:41,503
小本会相信我的
Benji will believe me.

514
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:45,136
我也相信你
I believe you too.

515
01:05:45,343 --> 01:05:47,436
不，你才没有，很明显没有
No, you don't.It's obvious.

516
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,446
我们都会忘事儿，伊丽莎白
We all forget things, Elizabeth...

517
01:05:52,051 --> 01:05:54,440
再说……以你这个年龄……
and... at your age...

518
01:05:54,552 --> 01:05:59,169
我没忘！我知道我干了什么！
I don't forget things!
I know what I do!

519
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:03,115
当然，亲爱的姑妈
Well, of course you do, dear.

520
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:08,029
那么，我给你做早餐吧，好么？
Now, why don't you just let me get you
some breakfast?

521
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:13,396
那个老女人叫什么太太来着……
But what about the old woman Mrs...

522
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,405
噢，我脑子太乱了，她叫……
Oh, I am so mixed up. Mrs. ...

523
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,938
阿拉戴斯太太
Allardyce.

524
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,868
- 是的，阿拉戴斯，也许是她……
- 伊丽莎白姑妈！
- Yes, Allardyce. Maybe she...
- Aunt Elizabeth!

525
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,369
咱们还是姑且忘了这回事儿吧！
Let's just forget this!

526
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,017
告诉本我上楼了
Tell Ben I'm upstairs.

527
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:40,655
我会把早餐带到你房间里
I'll bring your breakfast to your room.

528
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:44,598
就像你去她房间那样？
Like you do to her room?

529
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:48,234
另一个老女人？
The other old woman?

530
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:53,231
不不，玛丽安，别纠结了
No, no. Don't bother, Marian.

531
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:10,951
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth.

532
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:16,651
- 小本
- 我把你吵醒了？
- Benji.
- Did I wake you?

533
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:26,335
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

534
01:07:29,641 --> 01:07:33,077
想去阳台上喝几杯马提尼吗？
Do you feel up to a few little Martinis
on the terrace?

535
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:35,476
你知道她跟我说了啥吗？
Do you know what she said to me?

536
01:07:36,381 --> 01:07:39,773
伊丽莎白，她很沮丧，我保证她不是故意要说出那番话的
Elizabeth, she was upset. I'm sure
she didn't mean what she was saying.

537
01:07:39,985 --> 01:07:42,748
她不能这么跟我说话
She has no right
to talk to me like that.

538
01:07:43,387 --> 01:07:44,854
我宁可死……
I would die...

539
01:07:46,891 --> 01:07:49,917
如果我做了什么伤害大卫的事，我宁可去死
I would die
before I did anything to hurt Davey.

540
01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:54,889
你看，你们俩之前都没讲过话
怎么回事，忽然之间就这样了？
Look, you two never had words before.
Why, all of a sudden?

541
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:57,262
问问你老婆吧
Well, ask your wife.

542
01:07:58,336 --> 01:08:03,462
- 也许我是个老女人
- 伊丽莎白，你不老
- Maybe I am an old woman.
- Elizabeth, you are not old.

543
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:07,706
但这可不意味着我已经痴呆了
But that doesn't mean that I've
lost all my marbles.

544
01:08:08,645 --> 01:08:14,337
如果我真的像她说的那样关上窗锁上门……
If I had closed those windows or
locked that door, the way she said...

545
01:08:14,784 --> 01:08:16,978
我敢保证她没那么说
I'm sure she didn't say that.

546
01:08:17,519 --> 01:08:19,384
我可是明确的记得……
I'd certainly remember...

547
01:08:19,922 --> 01:08:22,322
你不会忘记像这样的事
You don't forget things like that.

548
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:26,854
我可不会忘记这么重要的事，是吧？
I couldn't forget something as
important as that, could I?

549
01:08:29,598 --> 01:08:34,458
噢，我很抱歉，小本，只是她让我太难受了
Oh I'm sorry, Benji.
But she's gotten me so upset.

550
01:08:36,638 --> 01:08:40,438
我不喜欢这儿，我想离开这房子
I don't like it here.
I want to leave this house.

551
01:08:41,142 --> 01:08:44,373
你也是这么想的，我知道你是
You feel the same way,
I know you do.

552
01:08:50,017 --> 01:08:52,383
听着，伊丽莎白，我们都很难受
Look Elizabeth, we're all upset.

553
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:57,219
为什么你不下楼来喝几杯呢？
Now why don't you come downstairs
and have those drinks?

554
01:08:57,324 --> 01:09:01,260
权当是给玛丽安道歉的一个小机会
Even if it's just a little chance
for Marian to say she's sorry.

555
01:09:02,296 --> 01:09:03,593
好吧
All right.

556
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:07,061
但我这么做全是因为你，小本
But only for you, Benji.

557
01:09:09,135 --> 01:09:10,466
我爱你
I love you.

558
01:09:11,637 --> 01:09:13,231
你知道吗？
当然
Do you know that?
I do.

559
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:42,031
本，你吓到我了
Ben, you scared me.

560
01:09:42,466 --> 01:09:45,367
你知道你伤她有多重吗？
Have you any idea just how
much you've hurt her?

561
01:09:46,804 --> 01:09:49,773
对不起，但她昨晚在达维房里
I'm sorry, but she was
in his room last night.

562
01:09:50,974 --> 01:09:52,669
玛丽安，她干嘛要撒谎呢？
Why should she lie, Marian?

563
01:09:53,477 --> 01:09:57,003
我可没说她在撒谎，她只是不记得了
I didn't say that she lied.
She simply does not remember.

564
01:09:59,115 --> 01:10:03,381
那么我是否可以认为她应该对所有这一切都负责？
And I suppose she's responsible for all
the other things that go on in this house?

565
01:10:07,657 --> 01:10:10,717
唔，我可不明白这是什么意思
Well, I don't know what
that's supposed to mean.

566
01:10:11,527 --> 01:10:14,689
好，要是你不介意，我想下楼了
Now if you don't mind, I'd like
to go downstairs.

567
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:17,196
难道我不应该先见见她？
Well, shouldn't I meet her first?

568
01:10:17,632 --> 01:10:20,965
- 我的意思是，她在哪儿呢？
- 她就在房间里睡觉！
- I mean, where is she?
- She's in her bedroom, asleep!

569
01:10:21,436 --> 01:10:23,734
本，她并不喜欢有人在这儿
Ben, she doesn't like anyone up here.

570
01:10:37,284 --> 01:10:38,979
她……没错
Her... collection.

571
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:49,022
亲爱的，为什么你不干脆让我把这儿锁起来？
Why don't you just let me lock up, dear?

572
01:10:49,896 --> 01:10:51,761
你干嘛这么紧张？
Why are you so nervous?

573
01:10:51,965 --> 01:10:55,196
我没有紧张，我只是不想让她太过难受
I am not nervous.
I just wouldn't want to upset her.

574
01:10:55,402 --> 01:10:57,495
你干嘛总是锁着她的门？
Why do you keep her door locked?

575
01:10:57,604 --> 01:11:00,402
她就是喜欢这样，她是个老女人了
She likes it that way.
She's an old woman.

576
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:03,241
- 她……
- 给了你钥匙？
- She...
- Gave you the key?

577
01:11:06,678 --> 01:11:09,738
不是，钥匙在信封里
No, the key was in the envelope
the Allardyce's left.

578
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:15,312
能开门锁的钥匙也在同一个信封里吗？
And were the keys belonging to all
those clocks in the same envelope?

579
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:20,714
那些钥匙在锁盒里，你问这个是什么意思？
The keys to the clocks were in
the clock cases. Why do you ask?

580
01:11:21,592 --> 01:11:25,358
我只是好奇你是否把所有的时钟都拧了发条
I just wonder whether you wound
all those clocks by yourself.

581
01:11:25,963 --> 01:11:27,294
就这样
That's all.

582
01:11:30,735 --> 01:11:32,566
我当然拧了
Well, of course I did.

583
01:11:36,407 --> 01:11:39,304
亲爱的，你这算啥，刑讯逼供吗？
What is this darling, a third degree?

584
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,869
这都是些什么？
What's all this?

585
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:47,082
让本花时间做的小事情？
好让他高兴点然后从你眼前消失？
Time to throw Ben a little something?
Keep him happy and out of your way?

586
01:11:47,984 --> 01:11:48,941
你就是这么想的吗？
Is that what you think?

587
01:11:48,954 --> 01:11:51,317
玛丽安，老实说，我不知道该怎么想
To be perfectly frank Marian,
I don't know what to think.

588
01:11:52,322 --> 01:11:54,153
也许你可以告诉我
Maybe you can tell me.

589
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:58,354
好吧，我试试
All right, I'll try.

590
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:04,260
我很抱歉，那晚在泳池我不该那么做
I'm sorry about the way I acted
at the pool the other night.

591
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:07,367
我都不知道自己干嘛要那么做
I don't know why I acted that way.

592
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:13,565
也许你要花点时间才知道
Perhaps you need a little more time
to work that one out.

593
01:12:23,146 --> 01:12:24,384
大卫，小心……
Davey, be care...

594
01:12:25,153 --> 01:12:26,484
看看你做的事！
Look what you did!

595
01:12:27,088 --> 01:12:29,851
- 你什么也别碰！
- 我不是故意的！
- Don't you ever touch a thing!
- I didn't mean to do it!

596
01:12:29,957 --> 01:12:32,858
你别想再碰什么好看的东西！
Don't you ever touch
a beautiful thing!

597
01:14:03,645 --> 01:14:05,489
- 本，我……
- 玛丽安，你到底出什么事了？
- Ben, I...
- Marian, what is happening to you?

598
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:07,398
没事
Absolutely nothing.

599
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:10,542
那他妈到底是为什么你要那样对达维！
Then what the hell was that performance
with Davey back in there!

600
01:14:14,322 --> 01:14:16,017
这个房子……
This house just...

601
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:19,456
……比我想象的还要复杂
...is more than I thought it would be.

602
01:14:20,061 --> 01:14:22,960
玛丽安，亲爱的，这房子不属于你
Marian, this house is
not yours, sweetheart.

603
01:14:22,973 --> 01:14:25,689
我们并不拥有它，你懂吗？
We do not own it, do
you understand that?

604
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:30,124
但看着房子是我的责任，只要我们还住在里面，不是吗？
But it's my responsibility for
as long as we're here, isn't it?

605
01:14:36,276 --> 01:14:38,767
请有点耐心，我需要多一点时间
Please be patient with me.
I need more time.

606
01:14:39,012 --> 01:14:42,709
多点时间干嘛？
让更多人牵扯进来？
More time for what?
To get more involved with all this?

607
01:14:43,515 --> 01:14:45,608
玛丽安，这个夏天快结束了
Marian, the Summer is almost over.

608
01:14:51,924 --> 01:14:55,257
- 我能问你个问题吗？
- 当然可以
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Of course not.

609
01:14:56,595 --> 01:15:00,855
哪个对你而言更重要？这房子，所有这些……
What's more important to you?
The house, all this...

610
01:15:01,866 --> 01:15:03,135
……还是我们？
...or us?

611
01:15:04,802 --> 01:15:07,100
这算是什么问题？
What kind of a question is that?

612
01:15:09,307 --> 01:15:11,798
好吧，那我换种方式
All right, I'll put it another way.

613
01:15:13,011 --> 01:15:14,842
如果我求你……
If I was to ask you...

614
01:15:15,847 --> 01:15:17,609
你会放弃这一切吗？
would you give it up?

615
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:19,980
放弃？
Give it up?

616
01:15:21,952 --> 01:15:23,010
为什么？
Why?

617
01:15:26,657 --> 01:15:29,125
要是我没能及时抓住达维呢？
What if I hadn't reached Davey in time?

618
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:34,487
那跟这房子又有什么关系？为什么要离开？
What does that got to do with this house?
Or with leaving?

619
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:39,997
本……我真不敢相信你竟然是认真的！
Ben...
I can't believe you're serious!

620
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:41,869
噢，我认真的，玛丽安
Oh, I'm serious, Marian.

621
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:47,605
你知道你讲的东西听起来有多荒谬吗？
Do you know how ridiculous you're sounding?

622
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:53,710
难道你真的是想跟我说这个房子才是罪魁祸首？
Are you actually trying to tell me
that this house is responsible?

623
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,345
你能为了我放下这一切吗？
Would you give it up for me?

624
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:03,416
我是说，哪怕你认为这些都是我的臆想？
I mean, even if you thought it
was in my head, in my mind?

625
01:16:05,026 --> 01:16:06,323
你能吗？
Would you?

626
01:16:10,197 --> 01:16:12,356
爸爸！
妈妈！
Dad!
Mom!

627
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:17,398
爸爸，是伊丽莎白姑婆！
Dad, it's Elizabeth!

628
01:16:19,573 --> 01:16:21,040
她在这儿
She's up here.

629
01:16:25,545 --> 01:16:26,705
噢，老天啊
Oh my God.

630
01:16:28,047 --> 01:16:31,547
玛丽安，带着达维离开这儿
快带他离开，快！
Marian, get Davey out of here, please.
Get him out now, please!

631
01:16:41,793 --> 01:16:45,388
达维的专职医生电话是多少来着？
What's the number of that doctor
I used when Davey was ill?

632
01:16:46,798 --> 01:16:49,562
- 在哪儿呢？
- 放在客厅桌上
- Where is it?
- On the hall table.

633
01:16:50,535 --> 01:16:51,763
看着她
Stay with her.

634
01:17:34,543 --> 01:17:36,101
打通了吗？
Did you get him?

635
01:17:37,143 --> 01:17:38,601
没有
No.

636
01:17:39,581 --> 01:17:40,946
忙音
It was busy.

637
01:17:41,483 --> 01:17:43,644
总不可能忙一晚上吧
Well it can't be busy all night.

638
01:17:44,353 --> 01:17:45,581
对吧？
Can't they?

639
01:17:46,922 --> 01:17:51,916
他们都很忙，玛丽安
彻底乱成了一锅粥
They were all busy, Marian.
Every God damn one I tried.

640
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:55,922
就连接线员都无暇他顾
Including the operator.

641
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:58,962
很意外吗？
Surprised?

642
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,629
我不知道你什么意思
I don't know what you're talking about.

643
01:18:03,104 --> 01:18:05,197
我要下楼自己试试
I'll go down and try him myself.

644
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,337
好吧，你去吧
Yes, you do that.

645
01:18:43,074 --> 01:18:45,008
- 打通了
- 你打通了？
- I got it.
- You got him?

646
01:18:46,044 --> 01:18:49,275
玛丽安，所有的线路都是忙碌状态，我说的是真的
But all the lines were busy, Marian.
I didn't imagine that.

647
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,209
不，我很确定没有忙音
No, I'm sure you didn't.

648
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:55,411
重要的是医生会赶来
The important thing is he'll be here.

649
01:19:03,927 --> 01:19:05,899
就没有什么事是我能做的吗？
Isn't there something I can do?

650
01:19:06,591 --> 01:19:09,755
不，你去瞧瞧达维，好吗？
No, no.
You go and check on Davey, OK?

651
01:19:10,968 --> 01:19:13,459
然后在楼下等医生过来
And then wait for the doctor downstairs.

652
01:23:26,941 --> 01:23:29,307
尘归尘，土归土
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.

653
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:33,351
让往生者安宁
In the sure and certain
hope of the ressurection

654
01:23:33,364 --> 01:23:36,444
让在世者重获解脱……
of eternal life through
Jesus Christ, our Lord...

655
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:41,185
基于她的勇气和信念，这位良善之人……
And in her courage and faith,
this good woman is now...

656
01:23:41,187 --> 01:23:43,478
现已与吾主在k的天国中……
joined in eternal peace
with her Maker ...

657
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,724
同享安祥……
in His Divine Kingdom...

658
01:23:46,126 --> 01:23:49,254
哀恸之人必得安慰
And we who grieve must take solace
in the fact...

659
01:23:49,662 --> 01:23:54,460
一如吾等必因辛劳而得褒奖
that we, too, are promised life eternal,
as our reward for our good work.

660
01:24:03,709 --> 01:24:05,836
我很喜欢烛光晚餐
I love eating by candlelight.

661
01:24:11,683 --> 01:24:14,487
玛丽安，生活有时就这么让人恶心，不是吗？
Well, life sure as hell
goes on, doesn't it Marian.

662
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,751
确实如此
And why shouldn't it?

663
01:24:18,422 --> 01:24:22,014
- 你不坐下来吗，亲爱的？
- 实不相瞒，我……
- Aren't you sitting down, dear?
- To be perfectly frank, I...

664
01:24:22,827 --> 01:24:24,818
我没什么胃口
I do not have an appetite.

665
01:24:27,131 --> 01:24:30,464
我说，伊丽莎白都已经死了
难道你一点也不在意？
Look, Elizabeth is dead.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

666
01:24:31,035 --> 01:24:33,128
我相当在意，达维！
It means a great deal to me.
Davey!

667
01:24:34,337 --> 01:24:36,952
玛丽安，我不确定除了这栋破房子
Marian, I'm not sure that
anything means a great deal to

668
01:24:36,965 --> 01:24:39,499
还有什么是你真正在意的，你明白吗？！
you except this bloody house,
do you understand that?!

669
01:24:39,709 --> 01:24:41,540
噢，这可不对
Well, that isn't true.

670
01:24:43,914 --> 01:24:47,577
那你怎么解释自己缺席了伊丽莎白的葬礼？
Then how do you account for your absence
at Elizabeth's funeral?

671
01:24:48,685 --> 01:24:51,710
你知道我不能留下阿拉戴斯太太一人
You know I couldn't leave
Mrs. Allardyce alone.

672
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:59,409
呵，我觉得咱们都不想讨论这事儿是吧？
Oh, I don't think we
want that on the table,

673
01:24:59,422 --> 01:25:01,255
至少不想在这张餐桌上
do we sweetheart? Not
on the pretty mahogany.

674
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:04,925
你为什么不把它倒出来，然后把瓶子带回厨房呢
Why don't you pour it, and bring
the bottle back to the kitchen.

675
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:08,161
- 这儿没有多余的杯子
- 唔，这儿有个高脚酒杯
- But there aren't any glasses.
- Well, there's a goblet.

676
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,161
比玻璃杯强，还是银质的
Is better than glass.
It's silver.

677
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:14,575
但我不想用高脚酒杯，我就想要个玻璃杯
But I don't want a goblet, I want a glass.

678
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:19,674
达维，你听见妈妈的话了
你把她的桌子弄乱了
You heard what your mother said, Davey.
You are messing up her table.

679
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:25,751
- 你现在要坐下了吗？
- 我跟你讲，玛丽安，我不饿
- Are you going to sit down?
- I have told you, Marian, I'm not hungry.

680
01:25:29,389 --> 01:25:31,755
好，多亏了你，现在我也不饿了
Well now, thanks to you, neither am I.

681
01:25:54,814 --> 01:25:56,441
打电话给那老女人
Call the old lady.

682
01:26:00,252 --> 01:26:01,879
我想见她
I want to see her.

683
01:26:03,054 --> 01:26:05,022
本，离那扇门远点！
Ben, stay away from that door!

684
01:26:06,258 --> 01:26:08,783
- 玛丽安，开门
- 我没法开
- Marian, open this door.
- I can't.

685
01:26:09,027 --> 01:26:12,554
唯一的钥匙在她那儿，我没有，这是锁住的
She has the only key.
I don't have that key, it's locked.

686
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:17,873
好吧，那你还知道什么？
还有什么是你一直都知道的？
All right, what is it you know?
What is it you've known all along?

687
01:26:18,569 --> 01:26:19,968
放开我
Let me go.

688
01:26:21,905 --> 01:26:23,065
拜托
Please.

689
01:26:24,742 --> 01:26:27,040
咱们要离开这房子
We're getting out of this house.

690
01:26:31,749 --> 01:26:34,913
你听到我的话了吗？我说咱们要离开这房子！
Did you hear what I said?
I said we are leaving this house!

691
01:26:35,685 --> 01:26:37,277
我们怎么离开呢?
Well, how can we?

692
01:26:38,688 --> 01:26:39,712
怎么做呢？
How?

693
01:26:40,423 --> 01:26:42,914
咱们就打包走人，就这么简单
We just pack up and go, that's how.

694
01:26:46,095 --> 01:26:47,914
本，你能让我先把这房间锁了吗？
Ben, will you just let
me lock this room up?

695
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:50,030
玛丽安，你就不能别再说这房间了吗！
Look Marian, will you stop
talking about this room!

696
01:26:50,132 --> 01:26:53,431
这全都是你的一厢情愿，这房间，这屋子，还有那个老女人
It's all you ever think of, the
room, the house, and the old lady.

697
01:26:53,535 --> 01:26:55,162
我是真正在乎她的人
Well, she depends on me.

698
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:58,368
只有我是
I am the only one.

699
01:26:59,675 --> 01:27:04,112
没人，从来没人像我这样关心她
There is no one, no one, to
take care of her except me.

700
01:27:06,647 --> 01:27:08,911
现在，你不能指望我……
Now, you can't expect me to...

701
01:27:11,652 --> 01:27:13,586
你中毒了
You're obsessed with it.

702
01:27:14,722 --> 01:27:17,282
- 中了剧毒
- 我没中毒！
- All of it.
- I'm not obsessed with it!

703
01:27:18,693 --> 01:27:21,161
玛丽安，这房子要毁掉我们
Marian, this house is destroying us.

704
01:27:22,596 --> 01:27:32,292
亲爱的，这房子是我们梦寐以求的
Darling, this house is everything
we've always wanted.

705
01:27:32,906 --> 01:27:35,297
它是我们的。。。
And it's ours...

706
01:27:35,975 --> 01:27:38,691
只要。。。
For as long as...

707
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:43,090
玛丽安。。。
Marian...

708
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:47,150
不管你是不是和我们一起。。。
Whether you come with us or not...

709
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,051
明天。。。
Tomorrow...

710
01:27:52,057 --> 01:27:53,149
。。。我们打道回府
...we're going back.

711
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:55,325
回去？回哪去？
Going back? To what?

712
01:27:56,195 --> 01:27:58,089
回去我们的老地方
To what we had.

713
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:01,421
我们无处栖身
We had nothing.

714
01:28:03,634 --> 01:28:06,034
那你觉得我们在这里能得到什么？
And what do you suppose we've got now?

715
01:29:58,142 --> 01:30:00,133
- 达维，醒醒
- 嗯？
- Davey, wake up.
- What?

716
01:30:00,244 --> 01:30:02,144
- 醒醒，我们要走了
- 什么？
- Wake up, we're leaving.
- What?

717
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:03,974
房子在莫名地。。。
Somehow the house is...

718
01:30:04,248 --> 01:30:05,875
- 。。。莫名的变动
- 什么？
- ...it's changing.
- What?

719
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:09,314
木板。。。一些木板和瓷砖。。。
The boards... some of the
boards and tiles...

720
01:30:12,055 --> 01:30:14,046
。。。它们在被。。。
...they are being replaced...

721
01:30:14,724 --> 01:30:16,076
。。。新的代替
...by new ones.

722
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:18,286
你别说话，我们走，OK？
Now, don't ask me why.
Just get out of here, all right?

723
01:30:18,394 --> 01:30:20,328
- 等等，爸
- 快走！
- But dad, wait a minute.
- Get out!

724
01:30:48,489 --> 01:30:49,979
爸!
Dad!

725
01:30:59,033 --> 01:31:01,228
- 停！停！
- 你进去那里！
- Stop it! Stop it!
- You get in there!

726
01:31:42,173 --> 01:31:43,604
我的神！
Oh my God!

727
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:52,671
停，爸！停下！
Stop it, dad! Stop it!

728
01:33:09,422 --> 01:33:11,856
慢点！等等妈妈！
Slow down! Wait for mom!

729
01:33:19,665 --> 01:33:21,957
停下，求你了，停下！
Stop it, please, stop it!

730
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:01,633
我不知道。。。
他撞了头好像
I don't know...
He banged his head or something.

731
01:34:01,805 --> 01:34:04,706
他很好，宝贝，我要接你们回去
He's fine, dear.
I'm going to take you back.

732
01:34:05,842 --> 01:34:10,367
你。。。接受这一切。。。
You... are accepting this...

733
01:34:11,346 --> 01:34:13,405
。。。因为你是它的一部分！
...because you're part of it!

734
01:34:25,927 --> 01:34:27,690
你是一部分吗？
Are you a part of this?

735
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:58,589
爸？爸，你怎么了？爸？
Dad? Dad, what's wrong? Dad?

736
01:35:17,475 --> 01:35:19,636
他会好吗，医生？
Will he be all right, doctor?

737
01:35:27,051 --> 01:35:30,452
他打了镇静剂，会睡一晚上
He's heavily sedated, which means
he'll sleep through the night.

738
01:35:30,555 --> 01:35:33,363
我恐怕到了明早他要去住院治疗
But by tomorrow morning I'm afraid
he's gonna require hospitalisation.

739
01:35:33,463 --> 01:35:34,831
晓得了
I see.

740
01:35:34,892 --> 01:35:37,270
你懂的，我们这里没有合适的设备
Of course, you understand,
we don't have the proper

741
01:35:37,283 --> 01:35:39,856
你要带他去城里
facilities here. You'll have
to take him into the city.

742
01:35:41,899 --> 01:35:44,231
他会没事吧，医生？
But will he be all right, doctor?

743
01:35:44,334 --> 01:35:46,431
我不是这方面的专家
Well, I'm not a specialist
in these matters

744
01:35:46,444 --> 01:35:48,600
洛夫女士，好好照顾他会。。。
Mrs. Rolf, but with the
proper care he'll...

745
01:35:48,705 --> 01:35:50,695
我一定会的
I'm sure I can give it to him.

746
01:35:50,807 --> 01:35:53,401
如果明天要见我，我就在办公室
If you need me tomorrow
I'll be at my office.

747
01:35:53,509 --> 01:35:56,205
- 谢谢你，医生
- 请留步
- Thank you, doctor.
- I'll see myself out.

748
01:36:08,344 --> 01:36:09,611
妈？
Mom?

749
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:13,024
爸还好吗？
Is dad OK?

750
01:36:13,461 --> 01:36:16,897
很好，甜心，医生刚刚说他需要多休息
Yes, sweetheart. The doctor just said
he needs some more rest.

751
01:36:21,436 --> 01:36:23,699

753
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:33,275
噢，我不这么想，爸爸在这里会更好

噢，我想是落在我房间里了
Oh, I think I left it in my room.
