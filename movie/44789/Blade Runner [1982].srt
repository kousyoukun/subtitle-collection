1
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:24,455
Next subject: Kowalski, Leon.

2
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:26,682
Engineer, waste disposal.

3
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:30,091
File section: New employee, six days.

4
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,273
Calling Mr. Webber...

5
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,182
Come in....
please report to Zone A Sector 9.

6
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:42,864
Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B-1 security alert.

7
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,500
Stand by for ID check, please.

8
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,091
Sit down.

9
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:50,773
Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B-1 security alert.

10
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:51,909
Stand by for...

11
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,273
Care if I talk?

12
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,545
I am kind of nervous when I take tests.

13
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,500
Just please don't move.

14
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,136
Oh, sorry.

15
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:06,318
I already had an IQ test this year.
I don't think I have had one of these.

16
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:08,636
Reaction time is a factor, 
so pay attention.

17
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:11,273
Now answer as quickly as you can.

18
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,136
Sure.

19
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:15,682
1187 at Hunterwasser.

20
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,818
That's the hotel.

21
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:19,045
- What?
- Where I live.

22
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,818
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

23
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:22,591
Is that part of the test?

24
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,318
No. Just warming you up. 
That's all.

25
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:28,364
It's not fancy or anything.

26
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,909
You're in a desert, walking
along in the sand, when...

27
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:33,091
Is this the test, now?

28
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:35,682
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...

29
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,500
...when you look down...
What one?

30
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,364
- What?
- What desert?

31
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:42,227
Doesn't make any difference.
It's completely hypothetical.

32
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:44,591
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up.

33
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:47,045
Maybe you want to be by yourself. 
Who knows?

34
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,227
You look down and see a tortoise.

35
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:52,864
- It's crawling towards you...
- Tortoise? What's that?

36
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:58,091
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

37
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,727
Same thing.

38
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,455
I have never seen a turtle.

39
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,409
But I understand what you mean.

40
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:08,182
You reach down, you flip the
tortoise over on its back.

41
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:10,636
Do you make up these questions, 
Mr. Holden?

42
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,864
Or do they write them down for you?

43
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:15,818
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the sun...

44
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:18,909
...beating its legs, trying to
turn itself over, but it can't...

45
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:20,545
...not without your help.

46
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,864
- You're not helping.
- What do you mean I am not?

47
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:24,318
I mean, you're not helping.

48
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:25,818
Why is that, Leon?

49
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:36,500
They're just questions, Leon.

50
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:39,909
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

51
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:44,182
It's a test designed to
provoke an emotional response.

52
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,545
Shall we continue?

53
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:53,318
Describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...

54
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,591
...about your mother.

55
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:58,182
- My mother?
- Yeah.

56
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:01,818
Let me tell you about my mother.

57
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,773
A new life awaits you in
the Off-world colonies.

58
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,955
The chance to begin again...

59
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:27,000
...in a golden land of
opportunity and adventure.

60
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:55,864
A new life awaits you in
the Off-world colonies.

61
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,955
The chance to begin again...

62
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:01,545
...in a golden land of
opportunity and adventure.

63
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,500
The custom-tailored, genetically
engineered humanoid Replicant...

64
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,773
...designed especially for your needs.

65
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:15,636
So come on, America. Let's put out...

66
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:18,818
Give me four.

67
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:22,500
No, four. Two, two. Four.

68
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:27,227
And noodles.

69
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,500
Hey.

70
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:52,000
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

71
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,273
Got the wrong guy, pal.

72
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:01,091
He say you Blade Runner.

73
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:02,682
Tell him I am eating.

74
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:04,000
Captain Bryant...

75
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:08,955
Bryant, huh?

76
00:09:23,682 --> 00:09:25,682
Yellow 3.

77
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:28,409
Climb and maintain 4000.

78
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:30,318
Final descent.

79
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:33,318
Now on glide path. Mark course.

80
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:35,455
Over the landing threshold.

81
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:54,364
Hiya, Deck.

82
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:55,727
Bryant.

83
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:59,045
You wouldn't have come if I
just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

84
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:04,636
come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard. I 
have got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

85
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:23,273
They jumped a shuttle Off-world,
killed the crew and passengers.

86
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:26,318
They found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

87
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,318
...so we know they're around.

88
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:30,727
Embarrassing.

89
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:34,318
No, sir, not embarrassing. No one's
ever going to find out they're down here.

90
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,909
Because you're going to spot
them and air them out.

91
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,318
I don't work here anymore.

92
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:40,636
Give it to Holden.

93
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:43,045
- He's good.
- I did.

94
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,591
He can breathe okay as
long as nobody unplugs him.

95
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,545
He's not good enough. 
Not good as you.

96
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,182
I need you, Deck.

97
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:53,636
Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.

98
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,273
I need the old Blade Runner.

99
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:58,000
I need your magic.

100
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:02,000
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

101
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:04,636
I am twice as quit now.

102
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:07,545
Stop right where you are.
You know the score, pal?

103
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:10,318
If you're not cop, 
you're little people.

104
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:23,364
No choice, huh?

105
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:26,591
No choice, pal.

106
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,955
I already had an IQ test this year.

107
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:32,091
I don't think 
I have ever had one of these.

108
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:34,636
Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.

109
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:36,818
- Answer as quickly as you can.
- Yeah, sure.

110
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:39,864
1187 at Hunterwasser.

111
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:41,364
Yeah. That's the hotel.

112
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:43,682
- What?
- Where I live.

113
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:46,000
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

114
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,045
There was an escape from the
Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

115
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:51,545
Six Replicants: three male, 
three female.

116
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:54,091
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

117
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:56,455
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

118
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:58,318
No crew, no sight of them.

119
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:01,364
Three nights ago they tried to
break into Tyrell Corporation.

120
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,955
Two of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

121
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,955
We lost the others.

122
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:10,409
On the possibility they might
try to infiltrate as employees...

123
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:14,591
...I had Holden go over and run Voight
Kampff tests on the new workers.

124
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,500
Looks like he got himself one.

125
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,091
So you look down and you see a
tortoise. It's crawling towards you.

126
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,409
- Tortoise?
- That's Leon.

127
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,636
Ammunition loader on intergalactic runs.

128
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,773
He can lift 400-pound atomic
loads all day and night.

129
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,182
The only way you can hurt him 
is to kill him.

130
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,591
I don't get it. What do they risk coming
back to Earth for? That's unusual. Why...?

131
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:36,364
What do they want out of
the Tyrell Corporation?

132
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:39,227
Well, you tell me, pal.
That's what you're here for.

133
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:53,545
- What's this?
- Nexus 6. Roy Batty.

134
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:55,591
Incept date: 2016.

135
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:58,409
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

136
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,545
Probably the leader.

137
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:06,409
This is Zhora.

138
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,955
She's trained for an
Off-world kick murder squad.

139
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,409
Talk about Beauty and the Beast. 
She's both.

140
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,091
The fourth skin-job is
Pris, a basic pleasure model.

141
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:23,955
The standard item for military
clubs in the outer colonies.

142
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:29,727
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

143
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:31,864
The designers reckoned after 
a few years...

144
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:34,409
...they might develop their
own emotional responses.

145
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,909
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

146
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:40,182
So they built in a fail-safe device.

147
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:43,500
- Which is what?
- Four-year lifespan.

148
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:52,818
Now, there's a Nexus 6 over
at the Tyrell Corporation.

149
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:56,955
I want you to go put the machine on it.
And if the machine doesn't work?

150
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:25,864
Do you like our owl?

151
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:30,909
It's artificial?

152
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:33,727
Of course it is.

153
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,318
Must be expensive.

154
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,818
Very. I am Rachael.

155
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,727
Deckard.

156
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:49,000
It seems you feel our work is
not a benefit to the public.

157
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:53,909
Replicants are like any other machine:
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

158
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:56,727
If they're a benefit, 
it's not my problem.

159
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:59,591
May I ask you a personal question?

160
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:02,864
Sure.

161
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,955
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

162
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:12,182
No.

163
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:16,000
- But in your position, that is a risk.
- Is this to be an empathy test?

164
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:20,682
Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response?

165
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,409
Fluctuation of the pupil.

166
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,273
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

167
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,409
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

168
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:34,591
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

169
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,364
Demonstrate it.

170
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:39,409
I want to see it work.

171
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:42,091
- Where's the subject?
- I want to see it work on a person.

172
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:45,045
I want to see a negative before
I provide you with a positive.

173
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,909
What's that going to prove?

174
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:49,727
Indulge me.

175
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:51,364
On you?

176
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:52,773
Try her.

177
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:00,091
It's too bright in here.

178
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,091
Do you mind if I smoke?

179
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,818
It won't affect the test.

180
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:44,955
All right, I am going to ask
you a series of questions.

181
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:48,409
Just relax and answer
them as simply as you can.

182
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:58,682
It's your birthday. Someone
gives you a calfskin wallet.

183
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:00,591
I wouldn't accept it.

184
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:05,045
Also, I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

185
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,227
You have got a little boy. He shows
you his butterfly collection...

186
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:11,136
...plus the killing jar.

187
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,955
I'd take him to the doctor.

188
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:23,045
You're watching television.

189
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,818
Suddenly you realize there's
a wasp crawling on your arm.

190
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:28,091
I'd kill it.

191
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:34,409
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

192
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:37,591
Is this testing whether I am a
Replicant or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

193
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,955
Just answer the questions, please.

194
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:45,818
You show it to your husband.

195
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,364
He likes it so much he hangs
it on your bedroom wall.

196
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:49,955
- bush outside your window?

197
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,364
I wouldn't let him.

198
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,955
- orange body, green legs?

199
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,364
Why not?

200
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:56,591
I should be enough for him.

201
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:02,091
One more question.

202
00:20:02,864 --> 00:20:05,773
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

203
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:09,909
The guests are enjoying an
appetizer of raw oysters.

204
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,045
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

205
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:31,409
Would you step out for
a few moments, Rachael?

206
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:42,273
Thank you.

207
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,773
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

208
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:47,591
I am impressed.

209
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:50,318
How many questions does it
usually take to spot one?

210
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:53,045
- I don't get it, Tyrell.
- How many questions?

211
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,818
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

212
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:58,455
It took more than a hundred
for Rachael, didn't it?

213
00:20:58,455 --> 00:21:00,364
She doesn't know.

214
00:21:00,364 --> 00:21:02,273
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

215
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:04,409
Suspect? 
How can it not know what it is?

216
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,636
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

217
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:09,955
"More human than human" is our motto.

218
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:13,591
Rachael is an experiment, nothing more.

219
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:18,000
We began to recognize in
them a strange obsession.

220
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,409
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced, with only a few years...

221
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:24,909
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

222
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:30,409
If we gift them with a past, we create a
cushion or a pillow for their emotions...

223
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:33,227
...then consequently we
can control them better.

224
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:35,136
Memories.

225
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:37,182
You're talking about memories.

226
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,500
Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.

227
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,545
- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Sure.

228
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:54,227
- 1187 at Hunterwasser.
- Yeah. That's the hotel.

229
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:55,500
- What?
- Where I live.

230
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,227
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

231
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:59,136
- Is that part of the test?
- No.

232
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,545
Kowalski.

233
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:14,067
Time...

234
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:16,864
...enough.

235
00:24:34,227 --> 00:24:37,045
Did you get your precious photos?

236
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,818
Someone was there.

237
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:44,136
Men?

238
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:48,836
Policemen?

239
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:22,455
Fiery the angels fell

240
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,727
Deep thunder rolled around their shores

241
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:29,318
Burning with the fires of Orc

242
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:35,318
You not come here. illegal.

243
00:26:38,136 --> 00:26:39,682
Hey. Hey.

244
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:44,045
Cold. Those are my eyes. Freezing.

245
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:55,773
Yes.

246
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:57,409
Questions.

247
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:06,227
Hey. Hey.

248
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:23,136
Morphology. Longevity. Incept dates.

249
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:24,727
Don't know.

250
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:27,045
I don't know such stuff.

251
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,727
I just do eyes.

252
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:33,591
Just eyes, just genetic design.

253
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:35,500
Just eyes.

254
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,500
You Nexus, huh?

255
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,182
I design your eyes.

256
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,227
Chew...

257
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:49,273
...if only you could see
what I have seen with your eyes.

258
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:49,993
Now...

259
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:53,182
...questions.

260
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:55,364
I don't know answers.

261
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:57,273
Who does?

262
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:01,955
Tyrell.

263
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:03,455
He knows everything.

264
00:28:05,273 --> 00:28:07,545
Tyrell Corporation?

265
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:11,545
He big boss. Big genius. 
He design your mind.

266
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:13,500
Your brain, huh?

267
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:16,273
Smart.

268
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,045
Very cold.

269
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:25,591
Not an easy man to see...

270
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:28,727
Give me coat.

271
00:28:29,864 --> 00:28:31,091
...I guess?

272
00:28:36,227 --> 00:28:38,136
Sebastian.

273
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:41,955
He take you there. 
He take you there.

274
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:44,591
Sebastian who?

275
00:28:46,818 --> 00:28:47,538
J.F...

276
00:28:49,773 --> 00:28:52,591
...Sebast...

277
00:28:54,136 --> 00:28:55,864
Now...

278
00:28:58,273 --> 00:29:00,227
...where...

279
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:03,364
...would we find this...

280
00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:06,773
...J.F. Sebastian?

281
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:09,500
Let's continue, shall we?

282
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,682
Describe in single words...

283
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:15,364
...only the good things that come
into your mind about your mother.

284
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:17,591
- My mother?
- Yeah.

285
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,227
I will tell you about my mother.

286
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:43,409
Voice print identification.
Your floor number, please.

287
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:47,636
- Deckard, 97.
- 97. Thank you. Danke.

288
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:09,773
I wanted to see you.

289
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:16,545
So I waited.

290
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:18,636
Let me help you.

291
00:30:21,545 --> 00:30:23,773
What do I need help for?

292
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,773
I don't know 
why he told you what he did.

293
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:28,955
Talk to him.

294
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,636
He wouldn't see me.

295
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:45,227
You want a drink?

296
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:48,568
No?

297
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:57,591
You think I am a Replicant, don't you?

298
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:04,591
Look.

299
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,000
It's me with my mother.

300
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:10,500
Yeah?

301
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:18,955
Remember when you were 6?

302
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:22,636
You and your brother snuck into an
empty building through a basement window.

303
00:31:22,636 --> 00:31:25,045
You were going to play doctor?

304
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:29,364
He showed you his, and when it got to
be your turn, you chickened and ran.

305
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:31,091
Remember that?

306
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:37,409
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody, huh?

307
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,636
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

308
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:45,636
Orange body, green legs?

309
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:48,455
Watched her build a web all summer?

310
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,909
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

311
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,727
The egg hatched...

312
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:55,318
- The egg hatched...
- And?

313
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:58,545
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.

314
00:31:59,727 --> 00:32:01,000
And they ate her.

315
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:07,318
Implants.

316
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:10,091
Those aren't your memories,
they're somebody else's.

317
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:12,636
They're Tyrell's niece's.

318
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:21,909
Okay.

319
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,636
Bad joke.

320
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:25,273
I made a bad joke.

321
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:27,045
You're not a Replicant.

322
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,182
Go home.

323
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:29,955
Okay?

324
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:35,000
No, really. I am sorry.

325
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,227
Go home.

326
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:50,727
Want a drink?

327
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:54,682
I will get you a drink.

328
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,045
I will get a glass.

329
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,409
Hey.

330
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:40,500
You forgot your bag.

331
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:52,500
I am lost.

332
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:55,636
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

333
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:00,818
What's your name?

334
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,227
- Pris.
- Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

335
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:06,318
- Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Oh, where were you going?

337
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:14,955
Home?

338
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't have one.

339
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,455
We scared each other pretty good, 
didn't we?

340
00:37:23,455 --> 00:37:25,364
We sure did.

341
00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:32,818
I am hungry, J.F.

342
00:37:33,273 --> 00:37:35,545
I got stuff inside.

343
00:37:35,955 --> 00:37:37,364
You want to come in?

344
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:39,727
I was hoping you'd say that.

345
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,591
Do you live in this building 
all by yourself?

346
00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:17,773
Yeah, I live here pretty
much alone right now.

347
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:20,818
No housing shortage around here.

348
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:25,273
Plenty of room for everybody.

349
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:36,136
Watch out for the water.

350
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:40,773
Must get Ionely here, J.F.

351
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:45,318
Not really. I make friends.

352
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:48,727
They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them.

353
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,091
It's a hobby. 
I am a genetic designer.

354
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:53,045
Do you know what that is?

355
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:53,795
No.

356
00:38:56,636 --> 00:38:58,045
Now.

357
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:05,273
Yoo-hoo, home again.

358
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:12,727
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

359
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:15,818
- Good evening, J.F.
- Evening, fellas.

360
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:29,409
They're my friends. I made them.

361
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,318
Where are your folks?

362
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:32,909
I am sort of an orphan.

363
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:35,227
What about your friends?

364
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:37,773
I have some, but I have to find them.

365
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:40,409
I will let them know 
where I am tomorrow.

366
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:48,227
Can I take those things for
you? They're soaked, aren't they?

367
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,818
Enhance 224 to 176.

368
00:41:42,773 --> 00:41:44,136
Enhance.

369
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:45,727
Stop.

370
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:00,591
Move in.

371
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:02,364
Stop.

372
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,682
Pull out, track right.

373
00:42:04,682 --> 00:42:06,545
Stop.

374
00:42:07,773 --> 00:42:10,091
Center and pull back.

375
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:13,955
Stop.

376
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,682
Track 45 right.

377
00:42:18,682 --> 00:42:19,727
Stop.

378
00:42:19,727 --> 00:42:21,636
Center and stop.

379
00:42:27,273 --> 00:42:30,273
Enhance 34 to 36.

380
00:42:39,545 --> 00:42:41,955
Pan right and pull back.

381
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,273
Stop.

382
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,136
Enhance 34 to 46.

383
00:43:02,682 --> 00:43:04,636
Pull back.

384
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,591
Wait a minute. Go right.

385
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:09,545
Stop.

386
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:11,273
Enhance 57-19.

387
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:16,000
Track 45 left.

388
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,364
Stop.

389
00:43:20,955 --> 00:43:23,591
Enhance 15 to 23.

390
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,273
Give me a hard copy right there.

391
00:44:30,773 --> 00:44:32,273
Fish?

392
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:49,864
I think it was manufactured locally.

393
00:44:54,273 --> 00:44:58,727
Finest quality. 
Superior workmanship.

394
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,682
There is the maker's serial number.

395
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:03,242
9906947-XB71.

396
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:10,136
Interesting.

397
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:15,000
Not fish. Snake scale.

398
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,545
Snake.

399
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:21,182
Try Abdul Ben Hassan. 
He make this snake.

400
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:21,955
Abdul Hassan?

401
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,273
I am a police officer. I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

402
00:46:26,273 --> 00:46:29,364
Artificial snake license XB71, 
that's you?

403
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:33,045
This is your work, huh?
Who did you sell it to?

404
00:46:33,045 --> 00:46:35,818
My work? Not too many
could afford such quality.

405
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:37,045
How many?

406
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:39,318
- Very few.
- How few?

407
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:41,045
- Look, my friend...
- Taffey Lewis'.

408
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:44,591
Down in Fourth Sector, Chinatown.

409
00:46:45,591 --> 00:46:49,682
Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.

410
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:54,091
Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.

411
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:57,182
Cross now. Cross now.

412
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,318
Bartender.

413
00:47:24,773 --> 00:47:26,591
Taffey Lewis?

414
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:28,818
Thank you.

415
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,500
- Taffey?
- Yeah?

416
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:36,182
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

417
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:38,091
Blow.

418
00:47:39,682 --> 00:47:41,909
You ever buy snakes from
the Egyptian, Taffey?

419
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:43,500
All the time, pal.

420
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:47,455
You ever see this girl, huh?

421
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,364
Never seen her. Buzz off.

422
00:47:50,364 --> 00:47:52,318
Your licenses in order, pal?

423
00:47:53,045 --> 00:47:54,455
Hey, Louie.

424
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:59,045
The man is dry. Give him
one on the house, okay? See?

425
00:48:39,636 --> 00:48:41,273
Hello?

426
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:46,545
I have had people walk out on
me before, but not when...

427
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:48,864
...I was being so charming.

428
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:52,909
I am in a bar, here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

429
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,318
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

430
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:58,545
Why don't you come on
down here and have a drink?

431
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:01,091
I don't think so, Mr. Deckard.

432
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,636
That's not my kind of place.

433
00:49:04,227 --> 00:49:05,227
Go someplace else?

434
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,955
Ladies and gentlemen...

435
00:49:22,955 --> 00:49:28,182
...Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake.

436
00:49:28,182 --> 00:49:32,500
Watch her take the
pleasure from the serpent...

437
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,273
...that once corrupted man.

438
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:19,409
Excuse me, Miss Salome, can
I talk to you for a minute?

439
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:23,500
I am from the American
Federation of Variety Artists.

440
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,682
Oh, yeah?

441
00:50:24,682 --> 00:50:28,500
I am not here to make you join. No,
ma'am. That's not my department.

442
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,455
Actually...

443
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:36,727
...I am from the confidential
committee on Moral Abuses.

444
00:50:37,636 --> 00:50:39,455
Committee of Moral Abuses?

445
00:50:39,455 --> 00:50:41,682
There's been reports that 
the management...

446
00:50:41,682 --> 00:50:43,909
...has been taking
liberties with the artists.

447
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:45,455
I don't know nothing about it.

448
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:48,500
Have you felt yourself to
be exploited in any way?

449
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,045
How do you mean "exploited"?

450
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:53,636
Well, like to get this job.

451
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:58,500
I mean, did you do, or were you
asked to do, anything that's...

452
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,818
...lewd or unsavory or...

453
00:51:00,818 --> 00:51:04,682
...otherwise repulsive to your 
person, huh?

454
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:10,000
- Are you for real?
- Oh, yeah.

455
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,318
I'd like to check your
dressing room, if I may.

456
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:16,091
- For what?
- For holes.

457
00:51:16,091 --> 00:51:17,227
Holes?

458
00:51:17,227 --> 00:51:20,091
Well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

459
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:22,955
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

460
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,091
No, I wouldn't.

461
00:51:27,091 --> 00:51:29,273
Little...

462
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:34,682
...dirty holes they drill in the
wall so they can watch a lady undress.

463
00:52:06,636 --> 00:52:09,864
- Is this a real snake?
- Of course it's not real.

464
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:14,000
Think I'd be working in a place like
this if I could afford a real snake?

465
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,409
So if somebody does try to exploit
me, who do I go to about it?

466
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:34,545
- Me.
- You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

467
00:52:59,864 --> 00:53:01,591
The only thing they care about...

468
00:53:01,591 --> 00:53:02,909
Hey.

469
00:54:26,136 --> 00:54:28,727
Cross now. Cross now.

470
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:31,864
Cross now. Cross now.

471
00:54:31,864 --> 00:54:34,636
Cross now. Cross now.

472
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:37,591
Cross now. Cross now.

473
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:40,955
Cross now. Cross now.

474
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:43,636
Don't walk. Don't walk.

475
00:54:43,636 --> 00:54:45,864
Don't walk. Don't walk.

476
00:54:45,864 --> 00:54:48,909
Don't walk. Don't walk. Don't walk.

477
00:55:03,045 --> 00:55:06,000
Cross now. Cross now.

478
00:55:06,364 --> 00:55:09,045
Cross now. Cross now.

479
00:55:09,045 --> 00:55:11,318
Cross now. Cross now.

480
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:14,864
Cross now. Cross now.

481
00:55:14,864 --> 00:55:16,545
Cross now. Cross now.

482
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:18,455
Move. Get out of the way.

483
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:01,909
Deckard.

484
00:57:01,909 --> 00:57:03,682
B26354.

485
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:12,500
Move on. Move on.

486
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,864
Move on. Move on.

487
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:18,045
Move on. Move on.

488
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,136
A minute.

489
00:57:27,273 --> 00:57:28,773
Yeah, what do you want?

490
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:30,682
Tsingtao.

491
00:57:37,545 --> 00:57:39,364
This enough?

492
00:57:39,364 --> 00:57:40,955
Yeah.

493
00:57:49,364 --> 00:57:51,091
Bryant.

494
00:58:10,136 --> 00:58:13,955
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

495
00:58:13,955 --> 00:58:15,273
I am going home.

496
00:58:15,273 --> 00:58:17,273
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

497
00:58:17,273 --> 00:58:20,909
He's a goddamn one-man
slaughterhouse, that's what he is.

498
00:58:20,909 --> 00:58:22,591
Four more to go.

499
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,455
- come on, Gaff, let's go.
- Three.

500
00:58:26,682 --> 00:58:27,773
There's three to go.

501
00:58:28,364 --> 00:58:30,545
There's four.

502
00:58:30,545 --> 00:58:33,409
That skin-job you VK'd at
the Tyrell Corporation...

503
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:37,318
...Rachael, disappeared, vanished.
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

504
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:40,227
Something to do with a
brain implant, says Tyrell.

505
00:58:40,227 --> 00:58:43,500
Come on, Gaff. 
Drink some for me, huh, pal?

506
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:27,364
Leon.

507
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:29,136
How old am I?

508
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:34,909
I don't know.

509
00:59:37,091 --> 00:59:40,136
My birthday's April 10,
2017. How long do I live?

510
00:59:40,136 --> 00:59:42,045
Four years.

511
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,000
More than you.

512
00:59:54,773 --> 00:59:57,455
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

513
01:00:02,773 --> 01:00:05,864
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

514
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,136
I agree.

515
01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:20,682
Wake up. Time to die.

516
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:56,182
Shakes?

517
01:00:57,682 --> 01:00:59,227
Me too.

518
01:01:03,045 --> 01:01:04,909
I get them bad.

519
01:01:10,227 --> 01:01:12,318
It's part of the business.

520
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:20,636
I am not in the business.

521
01:01:33,545 --> 01:01:35,682
I am the business.

522
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,045
What if I go north?

523
01:03:09,955 --> 01:03:10,955
Disappear.

524
01:03:16,136 --> 01:03:17,455
Would you come after me?

525
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,091
Hunt me?

526
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:26,432
No.

527
01:03:29,818 --> 01:03:31,727
No, I wouldn't.

528
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:38,318
I owe you one.

529
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,182
But somebody would.

530
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,864
Deckard...

531
01:04:11,182 --> 01:04:13,273
...you know those files on me?

532
01:04:14,545 --> 01:04:18,000
The incept date. The longevity.

533
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Those things.

534
01:04:21,273 --> 01:04:23,045
You saw them?

535
01:04:26,364 --> 01:04:28,045
They're...

536
01:04:28,045 --> 01:04:29,364
...classified.

537
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:31,909
But you're a policeman.

538
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:32,909
I...

539
01:04:34,273 --> 01:04:36,136
...didn't look at them.

540
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:40,273
You know, that Voight-Kampff
test of yours...

541
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:44,091
...did you ever take that test yourself?

542
01:04:55,364 --> 01:04:57,091
Deckard.

543
01:07:21,227 --> 01:07:22,909
I dreamt music.

544
01:07:27,864 --> 01:07:30,364
I didn't know if I could play.

545
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,636
I remember lessons.

546
01:07:35,455 --> 01:07:39,273
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

547
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:45,909
You play beautifully.

548
01:08:53,136 --> 01:08:55,455
Now you kiss me.

549
01:08:56,818 --> 01:08:58,273
I can't rely on my...

550
01:08:58,273 --> 01:09:00,909
Say, "Kiss me."

551
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:05,364
Kiss me.

552
01:09:16,364 --> 01:09:18,182
I want you.

553
01:09:21,136 --> 01:09:22,636
I want you.

554
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:24,318
Again.

555
01:09:24,318 --> 01:09:26,273
I want you.

556
01:09:29,318 --> 01:09:31,636
Put your hands on me.

557
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:53,273
- What you doing?
- I am sorry. Just peeking.

558
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
- How do I look?
- You look better.

559
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,091
- Just better?
- Well...

560
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:04,455
...you look beautiful.

561
01:11:07,955 --> 01:11:09,545
Thanks.

562
01:11:15,682 --> 01:11:17,500
How old are you?

563
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:21,318
Twenty-five.

564
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:24,273
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

565
01:11:24,273 --> 01:11:25,727
What's that?

566
01:11:25,727 --> 01:11:28,773
My glands, they grow old too fast.

567
01:11:29,909 --> 01:11:33,955
- Is that why you're still on Earth?
- Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

568
01:11:36,818 --> 01:11:38,000
Anyway...

569
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,545
...I kind of like it here.

570
01:11:42,091 --> 01:11:44,045
I like you...

571
01:11:44,045 --> 01:11:45,409
...just the way you are.

572
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,227
Hi, Roy.

573
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:50,977
Hi.

574
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:53,500
Gosh, you...

575
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,864
...really got some nice toys here.

576
01:11:55,864 --> 01:11:58,273
This is the friend 
I was telling you about.

577
01:11:58,273 --> 01:12:01,545
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

578
01:12:01,545 --> 01:12:03,136
Sebastian.

579
01:12:03,818 --> 01:12:06,364
I like a man that stays put.

580
01:12:07,864 --> 01:12:11,045
You live here all by yourself, do you?

581
01:12:11,045 --> 01:12:12,227
Yes.

582
01:12:23,318 --> 01:12:25,591
How about some breakfast?

583
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,636
I was just going to make some.

584
01:12:27,636 --> 01:12:28,818
Excuse me.

585
01:12:35,864 --> 01:12:37,409
Well?

586
01:12:39,591 --> 01:12:40,773
Leon...

587
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,864
What's going on?

588
01:12:46,955 --> 01:12:48,636
There's only two of us now.

589
01:12:50,773 --> 01:12:53,727
Then we're stupid and we will die.

590
01:12:57,591 --> 01:12:59,682
No, we won't.

591
01:13:31,818 --> 01:13:32,818
No.

592
01:13:32,818 --> 01:13:35,364
Knight takes queen, see?

593
01:13:35,364 --> 01:13:37,364
Won't do.

594
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:47,455
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

595
01:13:47,455 --> 01:13:48,955
Because...

596
01:13:48,955 --> 01:13:51,182
...you're so different.

597
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:54,636
You're so perfect.

598
01:13:57,045 --> 01:13:58,045
Yes.

599
01:13:59,318 --> 01:14:01,364
What generation are you?

600
01:14:09,182 --> 01:14:10,318
Nexus 6.

601
01:14:11,318 --> 01:14:12,682
I knew it.

602
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:15,909
Because I do genetic design
work for the Tyrell Corporation.

603
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:18,227
There's some of me in you.

604
01:14:19,273 --> 01:14:20,909
Show me something.

605
01:14:20,909 --> 01:14:22,773
Like what?

606
01:14:22,773 --> 01:14:24,818
Like anything.

607
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:31,182
We're no computers,
Sebastian. We're physical.

608
01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:35,045
I think, Sebastian...

609
01:14:35,045 --> 01:14:37,500
...therefore, I am.

610
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,818
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

611
01:15:06,682 --> 01:15:08,364
We have got a lot in common.

612
01:15:08,364 --> 01:15:10,682
- What do you mean?
- Similar problems.

613
01:15:10,682 --> 01:15:13,500
Accelerated decrepitude.

614
01:15:15,318 --> 01:15:17,955
I don't know much about
bio-mechanics, Roy. I wish I did.

615
01:15:19,955 --> 01:15:22,364
If we don't find help soon...

616
01:15:22,364 --> 01:15:25,318
...Pris hasn't got long to live.

617
01:15:25,318 --> 01:15:27,136
We can't allow that.

618
01:15:29,227 --> 01:15:32,318
- Is he good?
- Who?

619
01:15:32,318 --> 01:15:35,727
- Your opponent.
- Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

620
01:15:35,727 --> 01:15:39,182
I have only beaten him once
in chess. He's a genius.

621
01:15:41,364 --> 01:15:42,364
He designed you.

622
01:15:44,727 --> 01:15:47,227
Maybe he could help.

623
01:15:47,227 --> 01:15:49,818
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

624
01:15:51,818 --> 01:15:55,182
Better if I talk to him in person.

625
01:15:58,182 --> 01:16:02,955
But I understand he's a
sort of hard man to get to.

626
01:16:02,955 --> 01:16:03,955
Yes.

627
01:16:05,182 --> 01:16:06,727
Very.

628
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,864
Will you help us?

629
01:16:12,545 --> 01:16:13,818
I can't.

630
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:15,909
We need you, Sebastian.

631
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:18,818
You're our best and only friend.

632
01:16:31,318 --> 01:16:33,727
We're so happy you found us.

633
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,455
I don't think there's another 
human being...

634
01:16:37,455 --> 01:16:39,818
...in the whole world 
who would have helped us.

635
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:30,182
66,000 Prosser & Ankovich.

636
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:32,682
Trade.

637
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:35,455
- Trade at two...
- Blue entry.

638
01:17:36,455 --> 01:17:39,682
A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.

639
01:17:39,682 --> 01:17:40,402
16417.

640
01:17:44,545 --> 01:17:46,227
At this hour?

641
01:17:46,227 --> 01:17:49,455
What can I do for you, Sebastian?

642
01:17:52,455 --> 01:17:53,909
Queen to bishop six. Check.

643
01:17:59,273 --> 01:18:01,364
Nonsense.

644
01:18:01,364 --> 01:18:03,682
Just a moment.

645
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:10,955
Queen to bishop six, ridiculous.

646
01:18:16,364 --> 01:18:18,045
Queen...

647
01:18:19,591 --> 01:18:21,545
...bishop six.

648
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,773
Knight...

649
01:18:28,773 --> 01:18:31,045
...takes queen.

650
01:18:37,636 --> 01:18:39,909
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

651
01:18:39,909 --> 01:18:41,500
What are you thinking about?

652
01:18:43,045 --> 01:18:45,182
Bishop to king seven.

653
01:18:45,182 --> 01:18:47,273
Checkmate.

654
01:18:47,273 --> 01:18:49,364
Bishop to king seven. 
Checkmate, I think.

655
01:18:51,136 --> 01:18:54,273
Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?

656
01:18:54,273 --> 01:18:57,227
Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?

657
01:18:57,227 --> 01:18:59,409
Let's discuss this.

658
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:01,500
You better come up, Sebastian.

659
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,364
Mr. Tyrell?

660
01:19:22,045 --> 01:19:23,682
I...

661
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:25,682
I brought a friend.

662
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:35,500
I am surprised 
you didn't come here sooner.

663
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:44,909
It's not an easy thing to 
meet your maker.

664
01:19:45,636 --> 01:19:48,409
And what can he do for you?

665
01:19:49,182 --> 01:19:52,500
Can the maker repair what he makes?

666
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,909
Would you like to be modified?

667
01:19:55,909 --> 01:19:57,955
Stay here.

668
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,136
Had in mind 
something a little more radical.

669
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:08,636
What...?

670
01:20:08,636 --> 01:20:11,182
What seems to be the problem?

671
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,955
- Death.
- Death.

672
01:20:14,636 --> 01:20:17,591
Well, I am afraid that's a little
out of my jurisdiction. You...

673
01:20:17,591 --> 01:20:20,545
I want more life...

674
01:20:20,545 --> 01:20:21,955
...father.

675
01:20:26,682 --> 01:20:28,773
The facts of life.

676
01:20:30,136 --> 01:20:32,818
To make an alteration in the...

677
01:20:32,818 --> 01:20:35,273
...evolvement of an organic
life system is fatal.

678
01:20:35,273 --> 01:20:38,909
A coding sequence cannot be
revised once it's been established.

679
01:20:38,909 --> 01:20:40,045
Why not?

680
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:42,091
Because by the second day of 
incubation...

681
01:20:42,091 --> 01:20:46,591
...any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations...

682
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:50,818
...give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

683
01:20:50,818 --> 01:20:52,727
Then the ship sinks.

684
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:56,227
What about EMS recombination?

685
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,864
We have already tried it.

686
01:20:57,864 --> 01:21:02,182
Ethyl methane sulfonate is an
alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.

687
01:21:02,182 --> 01:21:06,318
It created a virus so lethal the...

688
01:21:06,318 --> 01:21:08,545
...subject was dead before 
he left the table.

689
01:21:08,545 --> 01:21:11,682
Then a repressor protein that
blocks the operating cells.

690
01:21:11,682 --> 01:21:15,636
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

691
01:21:15,636 --> 01:21:20,318
So that the newly formed DNA
strand carries a mutation...

692
01:21:20,318 --> 01:21:23,227
...and you have got a virus again.

693
01:21:23,227 --> 01:21:27,682
But this, all of this, is...

694
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,364
...academic.

695
01:21:29,364 --> 01:21:31,909
You were made as well as 
we could make you.

696
01:21:31,909 --> 01:21:33,773
But not to last.

697
01:21:34,545 --> 01:21:37,591
The light that burns twice
as bright burns half as long.

698
01:21:37,591 --> 01:21:41,727
And you have burned so
very, very brightly, Roy.

699
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,091
Look at you.

700
01:21:44,091 --> 01:21:46,682
You're the prodigal son.

701
01:21:46,682 --> 01:21:50,273
You're quite a prize.

702
01:21:55,636 --> 01:21:57,136
I have done...

703
01:21:57,136 --> 01:21:58,864
...questionable things.

704
01:21:58,864 --> 01:22:00,864
Also extraordinary things.

705
01:22:01,364 --> 01:22:03,727
Revel in your time.

706
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:11,864
Nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

707
01:23:01,864 --> 01:23:04,591
Sorry, Sebastian.

708
01:23:04,909 --> 01:23:07,727
Come. Come.

709
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:56,909
Body identified with Tyrell is
a 25-year-old male Caucasian.

710
01:23:56,909 --> 01:23:59,773
Name: Sebastian, J.F. Sebastian.

711
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:04,636
Address: Bradbury Apartments,
Ninth Sector, NF46751.

712
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:06,318
I want you to go down there and...

713
01:24:10,273 --> 01:24:13,136
This sector's closed to ground
traffic. What're you doing here?

714
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:16,864
- I am working. What are you doing?
- Arresting you, that's what I am doing.

715
01:24:16,864 --> 01:24:21,500
I am Deckard, Blade Runner.
26354. I am filed and monitored.

716
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,864
Hold on. Checking.

717
01:24:26,864 --> 01:24:30,455
Okay. Checked and cleared. 
Have a better one.

718
01:24:40,545 --> 01:24:42,500
- Hello.
- Hi. Is J.F. there?

719
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,909
- Who is it?
- This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.

720
01:24:49,636 --> 01:24:51,273
That's no way to treat a friend.

721
01:27:42,545 --> 01:27:44,500
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

722
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:48,500
Good evening, J.F.

723
01:27:58,227 --> 01:27:59,955
Tea?

724
01:28:01,227 --> 01:28:02,955
More tea?

725
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Tea?

726
01:28:14,182 --> 01:28:16,273
More tea?

727
01:28:18,136 --> 01:28:19,818
Tea?

728
01:28:21,364 --> 01:28:23,136
More tea?

729
01:28:24,727 --> 01:28:26,636
More tea?

730
01:28:38,455 --> 01:28:40,273
More tea?

731
01:31:38,273 --> 01:31:41,864
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

732
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:46,727
I thought you were supposed to be good.

733
01:31:47,909 --> 01:31:50,500
Aren't you the good man?

734
01:31:55,091 --> 01:31:58,591
Come on, Deckard.

735
01:31:59,773 --> 01:32:01,500
Show me...

736
01:32:02,364 --> 01:32:04,364
...what you're made of.

737
01:32:15,909 --> 01:32:17,682
Proud of yourself, little man?

738
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:27,045
This is for Zhora.

739
01:32:28,591 --> 01:32:29,818
This is for Pris.

740
01:32:36,727 --> 01:32:38,182
Come on, Deckard.

741
01:32:38,682 --> 01:32:41,727
I am right here, but you have
got to shoot straight.

742
01:32:43,045 --> 01:32:45,318
Straight doesn't seem to be good enough.

743
01:32:45,318 --> 01:32:46,455
Now it's my turn.

744
01:32:48,273 --> 01:32:51,864
I am going to give you a few
seconds before I come.

745
01:32:52,545 --> 01:32:53,773
One.

746
01:32:53,773 --> 01:32:54,773
Two.

747
01:33:07,591 --> 01:33:09,364
Three.

748
01:33:09,364 --> 01:33:11,364
Four.

749
01:33:23,182 --> 01:33:24,727
Pris.

750
01:34:32,455 --> 01:34:33,775
I am coming.

751
01:34:36,818 --> 01:34:38,545
Deckard.

752
01:34:40,818 --> 01:34:42,091
Four, five

753
01:34:45,227 --> 01:34:48,227
How to stay alive?

754
01:35:10,182 --> 01:35:11,773
I can see you.

755
01:35:36,409 --> 01:35:38,682
Not yet.

756
01:35:38,682 --> 01:35:39,864
Not...

757
01:36:11,273 --> 01:36:12,955
Five.

758
01:36:16,091 --> 01:36:17,545
Five.

759
01:36:21,545 --> 01:36:22,727
Yes.

760
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:31,773
You better get it up.

761
01:36:32,364 --> 01:36:33,864
Or I am going to have to kill you.

762
01:36:34,864 --> 01:36:37,000
Unless you're alive, you can't play.

763
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,045
And if you don't play...

764
01:36:48,273 --> 01:36:50,409
Six, seven

765
01:36:50,409 --> 01:36:52,364
Go to hell or go to heaven

766
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,182
Good, that's the spirit.

767
01:37:40,773 --> 01:37:42,864
That hurt.

768
01:37:46,091 --> 01:37:48,136
That was irrational of you.

769
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,318
Not to mention...

770
01:37:51,864 --> 01:37:54,182
...unsportsmanlike.

771
01:37:57,909 --> 01:37:59,955
Where are you going?

772
01:40:56,864 --> 01:41:00,591
Quite an experience to
live in fear, isn't it?

773
01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:05,136
That's what it is to be a slave.

774
01:42:01,591 --> 01:42:02,864
I have...

775
01:42:02,864 --> 01:42:07,864
...seen things you people 
wouldn't believe.

776
01:42:09,409 --> 01:42:14,318
Attack ships on fire off
the shoulder of Orion.

777
01:42:16,227 --> 01:42:18,409
I watched C-beams...

778
01:42:18,636 --> 01:42:22,136
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhäuser Gate.

779
01:42:26,136 --> 01:42:28,091
All those...

780
01:42:28,091 --> 01:42:31,182
...moments will be lost...

781
01:42:31,182 --> 01:42:33,500
...in time...

782
01:42:34,955 --> 01:42:37,136
...like...

783
01:42:37,136 --> 01:42:39,000
...tears...

784
01:42:40,364 --> 01:42:42,545
...in rain.

785
01:42:45,955 --> 01:42:48,455
Time to die.

786
01:43:51,682 --> 01:43:54,455
You have done a man's job, sir.

787
01:43:59,864 --> 01:44:02,182
I guess you're through, huh?

788
01:44:04,136 --> 01:44:05,864
Finished.

789
01:44:27,045 --> 01:44:29,909
It's too bad she won't live.

790
01:44:30,818 --> 01:44:33,227
But then again, who does?

791
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,318
Rachael?

792
01:45:14,682 --> 01:45:16,273
Rachael?

793
01:45:29,636 --> 01:45:31,136
Rachael?

794
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,864
Do you love me?

795
01:46:37,955 --> 01:46:39,636
I love you.

796
01:46:40,455 --> 01:46:42,227
Do you trust me?

797
01:46:43,409 --> 01:46:45,273
I trust you.

798
01:46:54,273 --> 01:46:55,909
Rachael?

799
01:47:33,909 --> 01:47:36,682
It's too bad she won't live.

800
01:47:36,682 --> 01:47:39,318
But then again, who does?
