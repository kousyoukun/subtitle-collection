00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,544
<i>Next subject: Kowalski, Leon.</i>

3
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,880
<i>Engineer, waste disposal.</i>

4
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:41,383
<i>File section: New employee, six days.</i>

5
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:43,761
<i>Calling Mr. Webber...</i>

6
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:46,764
Come in.
<i>...please report to Zone A Sector 9.</i>

7
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:54,730
<i>Replication Center Level 9,</i>
<i>we have a B 1 security alert.</i>

8
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:57,524
<i>Stand by for ID check, please.</i>

9
00:04:58,108 --> 00:04:59,193
Sit down.

10
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:02,988
<i>Replication Center Level 9,</i>
<i>we have a B 1 security alert.</i>

11
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:04,198
<i>Stand by for...</i>

12
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:05,616
Care if I talk?

13
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:07,993
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

14
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,995
Just please don't move.

15
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:12,790
Oh, sorry.

16
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:19,171
I already had an IQ test.
I don't think I've had one of these.

17
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:21,590
Reaction time is a factor,
so pay attention.

18
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:24,343
Now answer as quickly as you can.

19
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:26,303
Sure.

20
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:28,972
1187 at Hunterwasser.

21
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,182
That's the hotel.

22
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,476
- What?
- Where I live.

23
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:34,353
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

24
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,188
Is that part of the test?

25
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:39,024
No. Just warming you up. That's all.

26
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:42,236
It's not fancy or anything.

27
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:45,948
You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand, when...

28
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:47,157
Is this the test, now?

29
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:49,827
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...

30
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:51,745
...when you look down...
What one?

31
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:53,664
- What?
- What desert?

32
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:56,625
Doesn't make any difference.
It's completely hypothetical.

33
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:59,128
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up.

34
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:01,630
Maybe you wanna be by yourself.
Who knows?

35
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,924
You look down and see a tortoise.

36
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:07,720
- It's crawling towards you...
- Tortoise? What's that?

37
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:13,183
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

38
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,935
Same thing.

39
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:16,729
I've never seen a turtle.

40
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,858
But I understand what you mean.

41
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:23,736
You reach down,
you flip the tortoise over on its back.

42
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:26,280
Do you make up these questions,
Mr. Holden?

43
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:28,574
Or do they write them down for you?

44
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:31,660
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the sun...

45
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:34,913
...beating its legs,
trying to turn itself over, but it can't...

46
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,582
...not without your help.

47
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:39,001
- You're not helping.
- What do you mean I'm not?

48
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,502
I mean, you're not helping.

49
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:42,087
Why is that, Leon?

50
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:53,265
They're just questions, Leon.

51
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:56,810
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

52
00:06:56,977 --> 00:07:01,273
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

53
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:05,819
Shall we continue?

54
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:10,783
Describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...

55
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:13,160
...about your mother.

56
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,871
- My mother?
- Yeah.

57
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:19,583
Let me tell you about my mother.

58
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:39,436
<i>A new life awaits you</i>
<i>in the Off-world colonies.</i>

59
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:41,689
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

60
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:45,901
<i>... in a golden land of opportunity</i>
<i>and adventure.</i>

61
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,973
<i>A new life awaits you</i>
<i>in the Off-world colonies.</i>

62
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,142
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

63
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,937
<i>... in a golden land of opportunity</i>

64
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:29,194
<i>The custom-tailored, genetically</i>
<i>engineered humanoid Replicant...</i>

65
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,614
<i>... designed especially for your needs.</i>

66
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:36,618
<i>So come on, America.</i>
<i>Let's put out...</i>

67
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:39,955
Give me four.

68
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:43,751
No, four. Two, two. Four.

69
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:48,672
And noodles.

70
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:03,604
Hey.

71
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:14,531
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

72
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:16,950
Got the wrong guy, pal.

73
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:23,999
He say you Blade Runner.

74
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,626
Tell him I'm eating.

75
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:27,002
Captain Bryant...

76
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:32,216
Bryant, huh?

77
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:49,692
<i>Yellow 3.</i>

78
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:52,528
<i>Climb and maintain 4000.</i>

79
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:57,051
<i>Final descent.</i>

80
00:10:57,217 --> 00:11:00,179
<i>Now on glide path. Mark course.</i>

81
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:02,389
<i>Over the landing threshold.</i>

82
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:22,117
Hiya, Deck.

83
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:23,577
Bryant.

84
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:27,039
You wouldn't have come
if I just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

85
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:32,836
Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.
I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

86
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:52,231
They jumped a shuttle Off-world,
killed the crew and passengers.

87
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:55,442
They found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

88
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,528
...so we know they're around.

89
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:00,072
Embarrassing.

90
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:03,784
No, sir, not embarrassing. No one's ever
gonna find out they're down here.

91
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:06,495
Because you're gonna spot them
and air them out.

92
00:12:06,662 --> 00:12:07,955
I don't work here anymore.

93
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:10,374
Give it to Holden.

94
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,876
- He's good.
- I did.

95
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,546
He can breathe okay
as long as nobody unplugs him.

96
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:19,633
He's not good enough.
Not good as you.

97
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,385
I need you, Deck.

98
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:23,929
Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.

99
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:26,682
I need the old Blade Runner.

100
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:28,434
I need your magic.

101
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:32,646
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

102
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,357
I'm twice as quit now.

103
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:38,402
Stop right where you are.
You know the score, pal?

104
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:41,363
If you're not cop, you're little people.

105
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,877
No choice, huh?

106
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:58,297
No choice, pal.

107
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,759
<i>I already had an IQ test this year.</i>

108
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:04,011
<i>I don 't think I've ever</i>
<i>had one of these.</i>

109
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:06,680
<i>Reaction time is a factor,</i>
<i>so please pay attention.</i>

110
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:08,932
<i>- Answer as quickly as you can.</i>
<i>- Yeah, sure.</i>

111
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:12,102
<i>1187 at Hunterwasser.</i>

112
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,687
<i>Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

113
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:16,106
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Where I live.</i>

114
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,525
<i>- Nice place?</i>
<i>- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

115
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:21,695
There was an escape from
the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

116
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:24,323
Six Replicants: Three male, three female.

117
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,992
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

118
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,453
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

119
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,413
No crew, no sight of them.

120
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,500
Three nights ago they tried to break
into Tyrell Corporation.

121
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,252
Two of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

122
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,338
We lost the others.

123
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:43,967
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees...

124
00:13:44,134 --> 00:13:48,347
...I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

125
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:50,307
Looks like he got himself one.

126
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:54,061
<i>So you look down and you see</i>
<i>a tortoise. It's crawling towards you.</i>

127
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,437
<i>- Tortoise?</i>
- That's Leon.

128
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:57,773
Ammunition loader
on intergalactic runs.

129
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,026
He can lift 400-pound atomic loads
all day and night.

130
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,570
The only way you can hurt him
is to kill him.

131
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,158
I don't get it. What do they risk coming
back to Earth for? That's unusual. Why...?

132
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:11,078
What do they want
out of the Tyrell Corporation?

133
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:14,039
Well, you tell me, pal.
That's what you're here for.

134
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,971
- What's this?
- Nexus 6. Roy Batty.

135
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:31,098
Incept date: 2016.

136
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:34,018
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

137
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:37,313
Probably the leader.

138
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,359
This is Zhora.

139
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:44,987
She's trained for
an Off-world kick murder squad.

140
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,658
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.
She's both.

141
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:57,666
The fourth skin-job is Pris,
a basic pleasure model.

142
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,669
The standard item for military clubs
in the outer colonies.

143
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,675
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

144
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:08,927
The designers reckoned
after a few years...

145
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:11,597
...they might develop
their own emotional responses.

146
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:15,184
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

147
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,561
So they built in a fail-safe device.

148
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:21,065
- Which is what?
- Four-year lifespan.

149
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:30,741
Now, there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

150
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:35,120
- I want you to go put the machine on it.
- And if the machine doesn't work?

151
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:07,796
Do you like our owl?

152
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,052
It's artificial?

153
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:16,013
Of course it is.

154
00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:18,682
Must be expensive.

155
00:17:20,893 --> 00:17:23,395
Very. I'm Rachael.

156
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:25,356
Deckard.

157
00:17:27,816 --> 00:17:31,904
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

158
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:37,034
Replicants are like any other machine:
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

159
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,953
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

160
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,956
May I ask you a personal question?

161
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,335
Sure.

162
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,716
Have you ever retired a human
by mistake?

163
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,095
No.

164
00:17:56,261 --> 00:18:00,057
- But in your position, that is a risk.
- Is this to be an empathy test?

165
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:04,937
Capillary dilation
of the so-called blush response?

166
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:08,816
Fluctuation of the pupil.

167
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:12,820
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

168
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,156
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

169
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,451
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

170
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,329
Demonstrate it.

171
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:24,498
I wanna see it work.

172
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:27,292
- Where's the subject?
- I wanna see it work on a person.

173
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:30,379
I wanna see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.

174
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,256
What's that gonna prove?

175
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:35,217
Indulge me.

176
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:36,927
On you?

177
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:38,387
Try her.

178
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,020
It's too bright in here.

179
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,642
Do you mind if I smoke?

180
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,478
It won't affect the test.

181
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:32,816
All right, I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

182
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:36,403
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

183
00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:47,122
It's your birthday.
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

184
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:49,124
I wouldn't accept it.

185
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:53,712
Also, I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

186
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:58,133
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection...

187
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,135
...plus the killing jar.

188
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,182
I'd take him to the doctor.

189
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,564
You're watching television.

190
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:15,442
Suddenly you realize
there's a wasp crawling on your arm.

191
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:17,820
I'd kill it.

192
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:24,368
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

193
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:27,705
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

194
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:30,165
Just answer the questions, please.

195
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:36,255
You show it to your husband.

196
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:38,966
He likes it so much
he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

197
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,592
Bush outside your window?

198
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,094
I wouldn't let him.

199
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:43,721
Orange body, green legs?

200
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:45,222
Why not?

201
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:47,516
I should be enough for him.

202
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,272
One more question.

203
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:57,109
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

204
00:20:57,276 --> 00:21:01,405
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

205
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:04,658
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

206
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:23,844
Would you step out
for a few moments, Rachael?

207
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,147
Thank you.

208
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:38,776
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

209
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:40,694
I'm impressed.

210
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:43,530
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

211
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:46,408
- I don't get it, Tyrell.
- How many questions?

212
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:49,286
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

213
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:51,997
It took more than a hundred for Rachael,
didn't it?

214
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:53,999
She doesn't know.

215
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,959
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

216
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:58,212
Suspect?
How can it not know what it is?

217
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:01,548
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

218
00:22:01,715 --> 00:22:03,968
"More human than human" is our motto.

219
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:07,805
Rachael is an experiment, nothing more.

220
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:12,393
We began to recognize in them
a strange obsession.

221
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,980
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced, with only a few years...

222
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:19,650
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

223
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:25,322
If we gift them with a past, we create
a cushion or a pillow for their emotions...

224
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:28,283
...then consequently
we can control them better.

225
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,285
Memories.

226
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:32,413
You're talking about memories.

227
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:45,217
<i>Reaction time is a factor,</i>
<i>so please pay attention.</i>

228
00:22:45,384 --> 00:22:47,344
<i>- Now answer as quickly as you can.</i>
<i>- Sure.</i>

229
00:22:47,511 --> 00:22:50,139
<i>- 1187 at Hunterwasser.</i>
<i>- Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

230
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:51,515
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Where I live.</i>

231
00:22:51,682 --> 00:22:53,309
<i>- Nice place?</i>
<i>- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

232
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:55,311
<i>- Is that part of the test?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

233
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:28,010
Kowalski.

234
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,536
Time...

235
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:18,912
...enough.

236
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:39,933
Did you get your precious photos?

237
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,938
Someone was there.

238
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:47,358
Men?

239
00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:54,448
Policemen?

240
00:27:26,582 --> 00:27:29,835
<i>Fiery the angels fell</i>

241
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:33,255
<i>Deep thunder rolled around their shores</i>

242
00:27:33,672 --> 00:27:37,009
<i>Burning with the fires of Orc</i>

243
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:43,265
You not come here! Illegal!

244
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:47,811
Hey! Hey!

245
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:52,358
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

246
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:04,620
Yes.

247
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:06,330
Questions.

248
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:15,506
Hey! Hey!

249
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,107
Morphology. Longevity. Incept dates.

250
00:28:33,273 --> 00:28:34,775
Don't know.

251
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:37,236
I don't know such stuff.

252
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:41,073
I just do eyes.

253
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,076
Just eyes, just genetic design.

254
00:28:44,243 --> 00:28:46,078
Just eyes.

255
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:50,207
You Nexus, huh?

256
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:52,960
I design your eyes.

257
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:55,129
Chew...

258
00:28:55,295 --> 00:29:00,384
...if only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

259
00:29:00,551 --> 00:29:02,469
Now...

260
00:29:02,636 --> 00:29:04,471
...questions.

261
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:06,724
I don't know answers.

262
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,726
Who does?

263
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:13,605
Tyrell.

264
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:15,149
He knows everything.

265
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:19,403
Tyrell Corporation?

266
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:23,615
He big boss. Big genius.
He design your mind.

267
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:25,659
Your brain, huh?

268
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:28,537
Smart.

269
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,499
Very cold.

270
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:38,255
Not an easy man to see...

271
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:41,508
Give me coat.

272
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:44,011
...I guess?

273
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,310
Sebastian.

274
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:55,314
He take you there.
He take you there.

275
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:58,025
Sebastian who?

276
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:03,322
J. F...

277
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:06,450
...Sebast...

278
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:09,870
Now...

279
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:14,375
...where...

280
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:17,628
...would we find this...

281
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:21,173
...J.F. Sebastian?

282
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,051
<i>Let's continue, shall we?</i>

283
00:30:24,218 --> 00:30:26,303
<i>Describe in single words...</i>

284
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,140
<i>... only the good things that come</i>
<i>into your mind about your mother.</i>

285
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:32,434
<i>- My mother?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

286
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:34,186
<i>I'll tell you about my mother.</i>

287
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,378
<i>Voice print identification.</i>
<i>Your floor number, please.</i>

288
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:03,799
- Deckard, 97.
<i>- 97. Thank you.</i> Danke.

289
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:26,864
I wanted to see you.

290
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:33,954
So I waited.

291
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:36,123
Let me help you.

292
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:41,462
What do I need help for?

293
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:45,633
I don't know why
he told you what he did.

294
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:46,884
Talk to him.

295
00:31:47,468 --> 00:31:49,678
He wouldn't see me.

296
00:32:01,982 --> 00:32:03,859
You want a drink?

297
00:32:06,528 --> 00:32:07,988
No?

298
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:16,747
You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?

299
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:24,046
Look.

300
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:27,591
It's me with my mother.

301
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:30,219
Yeah?

302
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,019
Remember when you were 6?

303
00:32:39,186 --> 00:32:42,856
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window.

304
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:45,359
You were gonna play doctor?

305
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:49,863
He showed you his, and when it got
to be your turn, you chickened and ran.

306
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,699
Remember that?

307
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:58,288
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody, huh?

308
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:03,669
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

309
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:06,839
Orange body, green legs?

310
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:09,758
Watched her build a web all summer?

311
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:12,344
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

312
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:14,221
The egg hatched...

313
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:16,932
- The egg hatched...
- And?

314
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:20,311
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.

315
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,855
And they ate her.

316
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:29,445
Implants.

317
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:32,364
Those aren't your memories,
they're somebody else's.

318
00:33:32,531 --> 00:33:34,992
They're Tyrell's niece's.

319
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,668
Okay.

320
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:46,420
Bad joke.

321
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:48,172
I made a bad joke.

322
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:50,007
You're not a Replicant.

323
00:33:50,174 --> 00:33:51,216
Go home.

324
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:53,052
Okay?

325
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,307
No, really. I'm sorry.

326
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:00,601
Go home.

327
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:14,698
Want a drink?

328
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:18,827
I'll get you a drink.

329
00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:21,330
I'll get a glass.

330
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:06,930
Hey!

331
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:14,313
You forgot your bag.

332
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:26,784
I'm lost.

333
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,120
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

334
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,501
What's your name?

335
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:39,004
- Pris.
- Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

336
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:41,215
- Hi.
- Hi.

337
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:46,637
Oh, where were you going?

338
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:50,224
Home?

339
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:53,435
I don't have one.

340
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:59,108
We scared each other pretty good,
didn't we?

341
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:01,068
We sure did.

342
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:08,867
I'm hungry, J.F.

343
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:11,704
I got stuff inside.

344
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:13,580
You wanna come in?

345
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:16,083
I was hoping you'd say that.

346
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:52,411
Do you live in this building
all by yourself?

347
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:55,748
Yeah, I live here
pretty much alone right now.

348
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,917
No housing shortage around here.

349
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:03,505
Plenty of room for everybody.

350
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:14,850
Watch out for the water.

351
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:19,688
Must get lonely here, J.F.

352
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:24,443
Not really. I make friends.

353
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,988
They're toys. My friends are toys.
I make them.

354
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:30,491
It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer.

355
00:40:30,658 --> 00:40:32,534
Do you know what that is?

356
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,286
No.

357
00:40:36,246 --> 00:40:37,748
Now.

358
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:45,214
Yoo-hoo, home again.

359
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:53,013
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

360
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,266
- Good evening, J.F.
- Evening, fellas.

361
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:10,447
They're my friends. I made them.

362
00:41:10,614 --> 00:41:12,449
Where are your folks?

363
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:14,118
I'm sort of an orphan.

364
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:16,495
What about your friends?

365
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:19,123
I have some, but I have to find them.

366
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:21,875
I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

367
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:30,009
Can I take those things for you?
They're soaked, aren't they?

368
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:11,819
Enhance 224 to 176.

369
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,879
Enhance.

370
00:43:31,046 --> 00:43:32,506
Stop.

371
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,105
Move in.

372
00:43:48,272 --> 00:43:49,898
Stop.

373
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:52,359
Pull out, track right.

374
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:54,320
Stop.

375
00:43:55,571 --> 00:43:57,990
Center and pull back.

376
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:01,994
Stop.

377
00:44:03,078 --> 00:44:04,872
Track 45 right.

378
00:44:06,915 --> 00:44:08,042
Stop.

379
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,002
Center and stop.

380
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:18,969
Enhance 34 to 36.

381
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:31,190
Pan right and pull back.

382
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:33,609
Stop.

383
00:44:39,073 --> 00:44:40,783
Enhance 34 to 46.

384
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:54,797
Pull back.

385
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:56,840
Wait a minute. Go right.

386
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,927
Stop.

387
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:01,762
Enhance 57-19.

388
00:45:04,223 --> 00:45:06,684
Track 45 left.

389
00:45:08,352 --> 00:45:10,187
Stop.

390
00:45:11,855 --> 00:45:14,608
Enhance 15 to 23.

391
00:45:25,494 --> 00:45:27,871
Give me a hard copy right there.

392
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:26,221
Fish?

393
00:46:41,528 --> 00:46:44,573
I think it was manufactured locally.

394
00:46:49,161 --> 00:46:53,832
Finest quality. Superior workmanship.

395
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:56,919
There is the maker's serial number.

396
00:46:57,086 --> 00:46:59,086
9906947-XB71.

397
00:47:04,385 --> 00:47:05,719
Interesting.

398
00:47:06,845 --> 00:47:10,766
Not fish. Snake scale.

399
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:12,351
Snake.

400
00:47:12,518 --> 00:47:17,189
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.
He make this snake!

401
00:48:18,876 --> 00:48:20,628
Abdul Hassan?

402
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,049
I'm a police officer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

403
00:48:25,215 --> 00:48:28,302
Artificial snake license XB71, that's you?

404
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:32,139
This is your work, huh?
Who did you sell it to?

405
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:35,017
My work? Not too many
could afford such quality.

406
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:36,310
How many?

407
00:48:36,477 --> 00:48:38,687
- Very few.
- How few?

408
00:48:38,854 --> 00:48:40,522
- Look, my friend...
- Taffey Lewis'.

409
00:48:40,689 --> 00:48:44,151
Down in Fourth Sector, Chinatown.

410
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:49,490
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

411
00:48:49,657 --> 00:48:54,119
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

412
00:48:54,286 --> 00:48:57,331
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

413
00:49:20,646 --> 00:49:22,481
Bartender.

414
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:27,987
Taffey Lewis?

415
00:49:28,737 --> 00:49:30,280
Thank you.

416
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:35,160
- Taffey?
- Yeah?

417
00:49:35,786 --> 00:49:38,038
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

418
00:49:38,205 --> 00:49:39,999
Blow.

419
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:44,003
You ever buy snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

420
00:49:44,169 --> 00:49:45,587
All the time, pal.

421
00:49:48,424 --> 00:49:49,758
You ever see this girl, huh?

422
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,761
Never seen her. Buzz off.

423
00:49:52,928 --> 00:49:54,763
Your licenses in order, pal?

424
00:49:55,556 --> 00:49:57,057
Hey, Louie.

425
00:49:57,224 --> 00:50:01,812
The man is dry. Give him one
on the house, okay? See?

426
00:50:44,146 --> 00:50:45,856
Hello?

427
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:51,362
I've had people walk out on me before,
but not when...

428
00:50:51,528 --> 00:50:53,739
...I was being so charming.

429
00:50:53,906 --> 00:50:57,951
I'm in a bar, here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

430
00:50:59,078 --> 00:51:00,496
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

431
00:51:00,663 --> 00:51:03,874
Why don't you come on down here
and have a drink?

432
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,585
<i>I don 't think so, Mr. Deckard.</i>

433
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:09,129
<i>That's not my kind of place.</i>

434
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:10,839
Go someplace else?

435
00:51:26,772 --> 00:51:29,316
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

436
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:34,738
<i>... Taffey Lewis presents</i>
<i>Miss Salome and the snake.</i>

437
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:39,284
<i>Watch her take the pleasure</i>
<i>from the serpent...</i>

438
00:51:39,451 --> 00:51:43,205
<i>... that once corrupted man.</i>

439
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:28,167
Excuse me, Miss Salome,
can I talk to you for a minute?

440
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:32,463
I'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

441
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:33,672
Oh, yeah?

442
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,635
I'm not here to make you join.
No, ma'am. That's not my department.

443
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:39,678
Actually...

444
00:52:41,847 --> 00:52:46,268
...I'm from the Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

445
00:52:47,227 --> 00:52:49,063
Committee of Moral Abuses?

446
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:51,398
There's been reports
that the management...

447
00:52:51,565 --> 00:52:53,734
...has been taking liberties
with the artists.

448
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:55,361
I don't know nothing about it.

449
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:58,530
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

450
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:01,158
How do you mean "exploited"?

451
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:03,869
Well, like to get this job.

452
00:53:04,036 --> 00:53:08,958
I mean, did you do, or were you
asked to do, anything that's...

453
00:53:09,124 --> 00:53:11,335
...lewd or unsavory or...

454
00:53:11,502 --> 00:53:15,381
...otherwise repulsive
to your person, huh?

455
00:53:18,092 --> 00:53:20,970
- Are you for real?
- Oh, yeah.

456
00:53:21,136 --> 00:53:24,390
I'd like to check
your dressing room, if I may.

457
00:53:24,556 --> 00:53:27,267
- For what?
- For holes.

458
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:28,477
Holes?

459
00:53:28,644 --> 00:53:31,438
Well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

460
00:53:31,605 --> 00:53:34,441
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

461
00:53:37,611 --> 00:53:38,737
No, I wouldn't.

462
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:41,031
Little...

463
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:46,662
...dirty holes they drill in the wall
so they can watch a lady undress.

464
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:23,365
- Is this a real snake?
- Of course it's not real.

465
00:54:23,532 --> 00:54:27,661
Think I'd be working in a place like this
if I could afford a real snake?

466
00:54:41,759 --> 00:54:44,762
So if somebody does try to exploit me,
who do I go to about it?

467
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:49,099
- Me.
- You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

468
00:55:15,501 --> 00:55:17,294
The only thing they care about...

469
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:18,629
Hey!

00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:48,093

477

00:57:38,185 --> 00:57:40,020
Move! Get out of the way!

484
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,920
Deckard.

485
00:59:28,087 --> 00:59:29,672
B26354.

486
00:59:36,178 --> 00:59:38,931
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

487
00:59:39,098 --> 00:59:41,350
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

488
00:59:41,517 --> 00:59:44,728
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

489
00:59:50,401 --> 00:59:52,111
A minute.

490
00:59:54,363 --> 00:59:55,906
Yeah, what do you want?

491
00:59:56,073 --> 00:59:57,866
Tsingtao.

492
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,959
This enough?

493
01:00:07,126 --> 01:00:08,627
Yeah.

494
01:00:17,303 --> 01:00:19,138
Bryant.

495
01:00:39,033 --> 01:00:42,995
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

496
01:00:43,162 --> 01:00:44,413
I'm going home.

497
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,498
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

498
01:00:46,665 --> 01:00:49,460
He's a goddamn one-man
slaughterhouse, that's what he is.

499
01:00:50,252 --> 01:00:52,004
Four more to go.

500
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:53,922
- Come on, Gaff, let's go.
- Three.

501
01:00:56,216 --> 01:00:57,384
There's three to go.

502
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:00,262
There's four.

503
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:03,265
That skin-job you VK'd
at the Tyrell Corporation...

504
01:01:03,432 --> 01:01:07,311
...Rachael, disappeared, vanished.
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

505
01:01:07,478 --> 01:01:10,356
Something to do with a brain implant,
says Tyrell.

506
01:01:10,522 --> 01:01:13,859
Come on, Gaff.
Drink some for me, huh, pal?

507
01:01:58,487 --> 01:01:59,530
Leon.

508
01:01:59,697 --> 01:02:01,407
How old am I?

509
01:02:05,536 --> 01:02:07,413
I don't know.

510
01:02:09,665 --> 01:02:12,918
My birthday's April 10, 2017.
How long do I live?

511
01:02:13,085 --> 01:02:14,878
Four years.

512
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:23,137
More than you.

513
01:02:28,142 --> 01:02:30,894
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

514
01:02:36,442 --> 01:02:39,695
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

515
01:02:40,654 --> 01:02:42,072
I agree.

516
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:55,169
Wake up. Time to die.

517
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:32,164
Shakes?

518
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:35,334
Me too.

519
01:03:39,296 --> 01:03:41,215
I get them bad.

520
01:03:46,804 --> 01:03:48,973
It's part of the business.

521
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:57,606
I'm not in the business.

522
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:13,372
I am the business.

523
01:05:46,298 --> 01:05:47,549
What if I go north?

524
01:05:51,637 --> 01:05:52,680
Disappear.

525
01:05:58,102 --> 01:05:59,436
Would you come after me?

526
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:03,273
Hunt me?

527
01:06:08,028 --> 01:06:09,655
No.

528
01:06:12,324 --> 01:06:14,326
No, I wouldn't.

529
01:06:20,082 --> 01:06:21,250
I owe you one.

530
01:06:36,515 --> 01:06:38,767
But somebody would.

531
01:06:51,113 --> 01:06:53,032
Deckard...

532
01:06:55,492 --> 01:06:57,661
...you know those files on me?

533
01:06:58,996 --> 01:07:02,625
The incept date. The longevity.

534
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,710
Those things.

535
01:07:06,045 --> 01:07:07,880
You saw them?

536
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,052
They're...

537
01:07:13,218 --> 01:07:14,428
...classified.

538
01:07:14,595 --> 01:07:17,097
But you're a policeman.

539
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:19,350
I...

540
01:07:19,516 --> 01:07:21,477
...didn't look at them.

541
01:07:23,562 --> 01:07:25,814
You know,
that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

542
01:07:26,899 --> 01:07:29,818
...did you ever take that test yourself?

543
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,374
Deckard.

544
01:10:13,649 --> 01:10:15,401
I dreamt music.

545
01:10:20,572 --> 01:10:23,200
I didn't know if I could play.

546
01:10:24,868 --> 01:10:27,621
I remember lessons.

547
01:10:28,497 --> 01:10:32,459
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

548
01:10:37,089 --> 01:10:39,383
You play beautifully.

549
01:11:49,453 --> 01:11:51,914
Now you kiss me.

550
01:11:53,332 --> 01:11:54,792
I can't rely on my...

551
01:11:54,959 --> 01:11:57,586
Say, "Kiss me."

552
01:12:00,339 --> 01:12:02,216
Kiss me.

553
01:12:13,686 --> 01:12:15,604
I want you.

554
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:20,234
I want you.

555
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:21,986
Again.

556
01:12:22,152 --> 01:12:24,029
I want you.

557
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,618
Put your hands on me.

558
01:13:51,408 --> 01:13:54,745
- What you doing?
- I'm sorry. Just peeking.

559
01:13:58,624 --> 01:14:01,752
- How do I look?
- You look better.

560
01:14:01,919 --> 01:14:04,964
- Just better?
- Well...

561
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,382
...you look beautiful.

562
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:11,679
Thanks.

563
01:14:18,102 --> 01:14:20,020
How old are you?

564
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:23,983
Twenty-five.

565
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:27,069
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

566
01:14:27,236 --> 01:14:28,570
What's that?

567
01:14:28,737 --> 01:14:31,740
My glands, they grow old too fast.

568
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:37,162
- Is that why you're still on Earth?
- Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

569
01:14:40,165 --> 01:14:41,375
Anyway...

570
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:43,002
...I kind of like it here.

571
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:47,631
I like you...

572
01:14:47,798 --> 01:14:49,049
...just the way you are.

573
01:14:52,303 --> 01:14:54,096
Hi, Roy.

574
01:14:54,263 --> 01:14:55,681
Hi.

575
01:14:55,848 --> 01:14:57,558
Gosh, you...

576
01:14:57,725 --> 01:15:00,019
...really got some nice toys here.

577
01:15:00,185 --> 01:15:02,563
This is the friend I was telling you about.

578
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:05,941
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

579
01:15:06,108 --> 01:15:07,609
Sebastian.

580
01:15:08,277 --> 01:15:10,988
I like a man that stays put.

581
01:15:12,531 --> 01:15:15,868
You live here all by yourself, do you?

582
01:15:16,035 --> 01:15:17,077
Yes.

583
01:15:28,631 --> 01:15:31,008
How about some breakfast?

584
01:15:31,175 --> 01:15:33,135
I was just gonna make some.

585
01:15:33,302 --> 01:15:34,345
Excuse me.

586
01:15:41,727 --> 01:15:43,354
Well?

587
01:15:45,606 --> 01:15:46,857
Leon...

588
01:15:47,024 --> 01:15:49,026
What's going on?

589
01:15:53,322 --> 01:15:55,032
There's only two of us now.

590
01:15:57,242 --> 01:16:00,329
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

591
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:06,585
No, we won't.

592
01:16:40,077 --> 01:16:41,120
No.

593
01:16:41,287 --> 01:16:43,789
Knight takes queen, see?

594
01:16:43,956 --> 01:16:45,874
Won't do.

595
01:16:54,216 --> 01:16:56,343
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

596
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:57,886
Because...

597
01:16:58,053 --> 01:17:00,222
...you're so different.

598
01:17:01,765 --> 01:17:03,851
You're so perfect.

599
01:17:06,353 --> 01:17:08,605
Yes.

600
01:17:08,772 --> 01:17:10,899
What generation are you?

601
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:20,242
Nexus 6.

602
01:17:21,285 --> 01:17:22,661
I knew it.

603
01:17:22,828 --> 01:17:26,081
Because I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

604
01:17:26,248 --> 01:17:28,459
There's some of me in you.

605
01:17:29,543 --> 01:17:31,295
Show me something.

606
01:17:31,462 --> 01:17:33,213
Like what?

607
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,299
Like anything.

608
01:17:37,134 --> 01:17:41,930
We're no computers, Sebastian.
We're physical.

609
01:17:43,724 --> 01:17:45,976
I think, Sebastian...

610
01:17:46,143 --> 01:17:48,562
...therefore, I am.

611
01:17:48,729 --> 01:17:52,024
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

612
01:18:18,926 --> 01:18:20,678
We've got a lot in common.

613
01:18:20,844 --> 01:18:23,097
- What do you mean?
- Similar problems.

614
01:18:23,263 --> 01:18:26,058
Accelerated decrepitude.

615
01:18:27,935 --> 01:18:30,729
I don't know much about bio-mechanics,
Roy. I wish I did.

616
01:18:32,815 --> 01:18:35,317
If we don't find help soon...

617
01:18:35,484 --> 01:18:38,404
...Pris hasn't got long to live.

618
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,322
We can't allow that.

619
01:18:42,533 --> 01:18:45,744
- Is he good?
- Who?

620
01:18:45,911 --> 01:18:49,290
- Your opponent.
- Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

621
01:18:49,456 --> 01:18:52,918
I've only beaten him once in chess.
He's a genius.

622
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:56,213
He designed you.

623
01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:01,218
Maybe he could help.

624
01:19:01,385 --> 01:19:03,929
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

625
01:19:06,015 --> 01:19:09,518
Better if I talk to him in person.

626
01:19:12,646 --> 01:19:17,693
But I understand
he's a sort of hard man to get to.

627
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,820
Yes.

628
01:19:19,987 --> 01:19:21,614
Very.

629
01:19:24,533 --> 01:19:26,952
Will you help us?

630
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:28,996
I can't.

631
01:19:29,163 --> 01:19:31,165
We need you, Sebastian.

632
01:19:31,332 --> 01:19:34,209
You're our best and only friend.

633
01:19:47,222 --> 01:19:49,683
We're so happy you found us.

634
01:19:51,518 --> 01:19:53,604
I don't think
there's another human being...

635
01:19:53,771 --> 01:19:56,065
...in the whole world
who would've helped us.

636
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:48,617
66,000 Prosser & Ankovich.

637
01:20:49,785 --> 01:20:51,245
Trade.

638
01:20:51,412 --> 01:20:54,164
- Trade at two...
<i>- Blue entry.</i>

639
01:20:55,165 --> 01:20:58,544
<i>A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.</i>

640
01:20:58,711 --> 01:21:02,798
<i>16417.</i>

641
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,342
<i>At this hour?</i>

642
01:21:05,509 --> 01:21:08,679
<i>What can I do for you, Sebastian?</i>

643
01:21:11,807 --> 01:21:13,309
Queen to bishop six. Check.

644
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:21,108
Nonsense.

645
01:21:21,275 --> 01:21:23,527
Just a moment.

646
01:21:26,447 --> 01:21:31,160
Queen to bishop six, ridiculous.

647
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:38,542
Queen...

648
01:21:40,169 --> 01:21:42,212
...bishop six.

649
01:21:47,301 --> 01:21:49,678
<i>Knight...</i>

650
01:21:49,845 --> 01:21:52,097
<i>... takes queen.</i>

651
01:21:58,937 --> 01:22:01,315
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

652
01:22:01,482 --> 01:22:02,941
What are you thinking about?

653
01:22:04,568 --> 01:22:06,779
Bishop to king seven.

654
01:22:06,946 --> 01:22:08,989
Checkmate.

655
01:22:09,156 --> 01:22:11,200
Bishop to king seven.
Checkmate, I think.

656
01:22:13,035 --> 01:22:16,288
Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?

657
01:22:16,455 --> 01:22:19,375
Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?

658
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:21,710
<i>Let's discuss this.</i>

659
01:22:21,877 --> 01:22:23,879
<i>You better come up, Sebastian.</i>

660
01:22:41,522 --> 01:22:43,482
Mr. Tyrell?

661
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:46,944
I...

662
01:22:47,111 --> 01:22:49,029
I brought a friend.

663
01:22:55,286 --> 01:22:59,290
I'm surprised
you didn't come here sooner.

664
01:23:05,963 --> 01:23:09,091
It's not an easy thing
to meet your maker.

665
01:23:09,842 --> 01:23:12,761
And what can he do for you?

666
01:23:13,512 --> 01:23:17,016
Can the maker repair what he makes?

667
01:23:17,182 --> 01:23:20,519
Would you like to be modified?

668
01:23:20,686 --> 01:23:22,646
Stay here.

669
01:23:27,776 --> 01:23:31,196
Had in mind something
a little more radical.

670
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,782
What...?

671
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:36,452
What seems to be the problem?

672
01:23:36,785 --> 01:23:39,413
- Death.
- Death.

673
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,167
Well, I'm afraid that's
a little out of my jurisdiction. You...

674
01:23:43,334 --> 01:23:46,295
I want more life...

675
01:23:46,462 --> 01:23:47,755
...father.

676
01:23:52,635 --> 01:23:54,803
The facts of life.

677
01:23:56,221 --> 01:23:59,016
To make an alteration in the...

678
01:23:59,183 --> 01:24:01,602
...evolvement of
an organic life system is fatal.

679
01:24:01,769 --> 01:24:05,356
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

680
01:24:05,522 --> 01:24:06,565
Why not?

681
01:24:06,732 --> 01:24:08,734
Because by the second day
of incubation...

682
01:24:08,901 --> 01:24:13,405
...any cells that have undergone
reversion mutations...

683
01:24:13,572 --> 01:24:17,826
...give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

684
01:24:17,993 --> 01:24:19,787
Then the ship sinks.

685
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:23,499
What about EMS recombination?

686
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:25,209
We've already tried it.

687
01:24:25,376 --> 01:24:29,672
Ethyl methane sulfonate is an
alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.

688
01:24:29,838 --> 01:24:33,968
It created a virus so lethal the...

689
01:24:34,134 --> 01:24:36,303
...subject was dead
before he left the table.

690
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:39,556
Then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells.

691
01:24:39,723 --> 01:24:43,686
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

692
01:24:43,852 --> 01:24:48,565
So that the newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

693
01:24:48,732 --> 01:24:51,610
...and you've got a virus again.

694
01:24:51,777 --> 01:24:56,240
But this, all of this, is...

695
01:24:56,407 --> 01:24:57,992
...academic.

696
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:00,661
You were made
as well as we could make you.

697
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:02,579
But not to last.

698
01:25:03,372 --> 01:25:06,583
The light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long.

699
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:10,963
And you have burned
so very, very brightly, Roy.

700
01:25:11,588 --> 01:25:13,340
Look at you.

701
01:25:13,507 --> 01:25:16,051
You're the prodigal son.

702
01:25:16,218 --> 01:25:19,763
You're quite a prize.

703
01:25:25,394 --> 01:25:26,937
I've done...

704
01:25:27,104 --> 01:25:28,731
...questionable things.

705
01:25:28,897 --> 01:25:30,816
Also extraordinary things.

706
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,819
Revel in your time.

707
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:42,286
Nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

708
01:26:34,505 --> 01:26:37,257
Sorry, Sebastian.

709
01:26:37,633 --> 01:26:40,594
Come. Come.

710
01:27:27,057 --> 01:27:31,854
<i>Body identified with Tyrell</i>

<i>This sector's closed to ground traffic.</i>
<i>What're you doing here?</i>

715
01:27:48,912 --> 01:27:52,625

<i>- Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.</i>

716
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:57,504
I'm Deckard, Blade Runner.
26354. I'm filed and monitored.

718

719
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:19,360

- Hi. Is J.F. There?

720
01:28:19,526 --> 01:28:22,947
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.

721
01:28:26,825 --> 01:28:28,535
That's no way to treat a friend.

722
01:31:27,131 --> 01:31:29,174
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

723
01:31:30,342 --> 01:31:33,304
Good evening, J.F.

724
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,316
<i>Tea?</i>

725
01:31:46,609 --> 01:31:48,444

<i>More tea?</i>

732
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,714
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

733
01:35:38,257 --> 01:35:41,677
I thought you were
supposed to be good.

734
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,639
Aren't you the good man?

735
01:35:50,436 --> 01:35:54,106
Come on, Deckard.

736
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:57,192
Show me...

737
01:35:58,027 --> 01:36:00,154
...what you're made of.

738
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:14,043
Proud of yourself, little man?

739
01:36:21,925 --> 01:36:23,761
This is for Zhora.

740
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:26,680
This is for Pris.

741
01:36:33,854 --> 01:36:35,356
Come on, Deckard.

742
01:36:35,898 --> 01:36:39,109
I'm right here,
but you've gotta shoot straight.

743
01:36:40,486 --> 01:36:42,821
Straight doesn't seem
to be good enough!

744
01:36:42,988 --> 01:36:44,073
Now it's my turn.

745
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:49,662
I'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

746
01:36:50,412 --> 01:36:51,664
One.

747
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:53,999
Two.

748
01:37:06,011 --> 01:37:07,888
Three.

749
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:09,974
Four.

750
01:37:22,278 --> 01:37:23,946
Pris.

751
01:38:34,516 --> 01:38:38,896
I'm coming.

752
01:38:39,063 --> 01:38:40,856
Deckard!

753
01:38:43,275 --> 01:38:44,568
<i>Four, five</i>

754
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:50,991
<i>How to stay alive?</i>

755
01:39:13,889 --> 01:39:15,516
I can see you!

756
01:39:41,292 --> 01:39:43,627
Not yet!

757
01:39:43,794 --> 01:39:44,837
Not...

758
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:19,371
Five.

759
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:24,168
Five.

760
01:40:28,339 --> 01:40:29,548
Yes.

761
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:38,932
You better get it up.

762
01:40:39,558 --> 01:40:41,101
Or I'm gonna have to kill you.

763
01:40:42,144 --> 01:40:44,396
Unless you're alive, you can't play.

764
01:40:44,563 --> 01:40:46,523
And if you don't play...

765
01:40:56,158 --> 01:40:58,369
<i>Six, seven</i>

766
01:40:58,535 --> 01:41:00,454
<i>Go to hell or go to heaven</i>

767
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,630
Good, that's the spirit!

768
01:41:50,963 --> 01:41:53,132
That hurt.

769
01:41:56,427 --> 01:41:58,554
That was irrational of you.

770
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:01,849
Not to mention...

771
01:42:02,474 --> 01:42:04,852
...unsportsmanlike.

772
01:42:08,731 --> 01:42:10,899
Where are you going?

773
01:45:15,376 --> 01:45:19,254
Quite an experience to live in fear,
isn't it?

774
01:45:20,965 --> 01:45:24,009
That's what it is to be a slave.

775
01:46:22,901 --> 01:46:24,194
I've...

776
01:46:24,361 --> 01:46:29,408
...seen things
you people wouldn't believe.

777
01:46:30,993 --> 01:46:36,165
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

778
01:46:38,083 --> 01:46:40,419
I watched C-beams...

779
01:46:40,628 --> 01:46:44,298
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhäuser Gate.

780
01:46:48,469 --> 01:46:50,512
All those...

781
01:46:50,679 --> 01:46:53,724
...moments will be lost...

782
01:46:53,891 --> 01:46:56,143
...in time...

783
01:46:57,686 --> 01:46:59,939
...like...

784
01:47:00,105 --> 01:47:01,857
...tears...

785
01:47:03,275 --> 01:47:05,527
...in rain.

786
01:47:09,114 --> 01:47:11,700
Time to die.

787
01:48:17,641 --> 01:48:20,561
You've done a man's job, sir.

788
01:48:26,233 --> 01:48:28,611
I guess you're through, huh?

789
01:48:30,654 --> 01:48:32,448
Finished.

790
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:57,473
It's too bad she won't live.

791
01:48:58,474 --> 01:49:00,976
But then again, who does?

792
01:49:34,593 --> 01:49:36,470
Rachael?

793
01:49:44,186 --> 01:49:45,896
