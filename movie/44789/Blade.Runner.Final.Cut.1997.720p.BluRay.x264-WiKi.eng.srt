1
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,612
Next subject: Kowalski, Leon,

2
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,986
Engineer, waste disposal,

3
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,429
File section: New employee, six days,

4
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,878
Calling Mr, Webber...

5
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,836
- Come in.
- ... please report to Zone A Sector 9,

6
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,738
Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B 1 security alert,

7
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,600
Stand by for ID check, please,

8
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,333
Sit down.

9
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,038
Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B 1 security alert,

10
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,334
Stand by for...,

11
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,748
Care if I talk?

12
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,103
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

13
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,102
Just please don't move.

14
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,903
Oh, sorry.

15
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,236
I already had an IQ test.
I don't think l've had one of these.

16
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,677
Reaction time is a factor,
so pay attention.

17
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,414
Now answer as quickly as you can.

18
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,432
Sure.

19
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,086
1187 at Hunterwasser.

20
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,318
That's the hotel.

21
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,574
- What?
- Where I live.

22
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,470
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

23
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,301
Is that part of the test?

24
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,104
No. Just warming you up. That's all.

25
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,326
It's not fancy or anything.

26
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,019
You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand, when...

27
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,293
Is this the test, now?

28
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,903
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...

29
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,855
...when you look down...
- What one?

30
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,774
- What?
- What desert?

31
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,693
Doesn't make any difference.
It's completely hypothetical.

32
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,211
- But how come l'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up.

33
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,714
Maybe you wanna be by yourself.
Who knows?

34
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,045
You look down and see a tortoise.

35
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,750
- It's crawling towards you...
- Tortoise? What's that?

36
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,270
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

37
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,053
Same thing.

38
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,849
L've never seen a turtle.

39
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,979
But I understand what you mean.

40
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,808
You reach down,
you flip the tortoise over on its back.

41
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,367
Do you make up these questions,
Mr. Holden?

42
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,672
Or do they write them down for you?

43
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,728
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the sun...

44
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,975
...beating its legs,
trying to turn itself over, but it can't...

45
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,703
...not without your help.

46
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,088
- You're not helping.
- What do you mean l'm not?

47
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,631
I mean, you're not helping.

48
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,223
Why is that, Leon?

49
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,341
They're just questions, Leon.

50
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,878
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

51
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,285
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

52
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,921
Shall we continue?

53
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,806
Describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...

54
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,273
...about your mother.

55
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,950
- My mother?
- Yeah.

56
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,659
Let me tell you about my mother.

57
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,456
A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies,

58
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,798
The chance to begin again...

59
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,924
... in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure,

60
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,989
A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies,

61
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,240
The chance to begin again...

62
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,968
... in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure,

63
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,229
The custom-tailored, genetically
engineered humanoid Replicant...

64
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,668
... designed especially for your needs,

65
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,646
So come on, America,
Let's put out...,

66
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,073
Give me four.

67
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,852
No, four. Two, two. Four.

68
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,801
And noodles.

69
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,728
Hey.

70
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,611
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

71
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,079
Got the wrong guy, pal.

72
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,128
He say you Blade Runner.

73
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,755
Tell him l'm eating.

74
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,131
Captain Bryant...

75
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,344
Bryant, huh?

76
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,787
Yellow 3,

77
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,608
Climb and maintain 4000,

78
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,149
Final descent,

79
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,240
Now on glide path, Mark course,

80
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,491
Over the landing threshold,

81
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,253
Hiya, Deck.

82
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,702
Bryant.

83
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,084
You wouldn't have come
if I just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

84
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,844
Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.
L've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

85
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,292
They jumped a shuttle Off-world,
killed the crew and passengers.

86
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,499
They found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

87
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,630
...so we know they're around.

88
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,209
Embarrassing.

89
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,818
No, sir, not embarrassing. No one's ever
gonna find out they're down here.

90
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,574
Because you're gonna spot them
and air them out.

91
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,079
I don't work here anymore.

92
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,510
Give it to Holden.

93
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,983
- He's good.
- I did.

94
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,622
He can breathe okay
as long as nobody unplugs him.

95
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,683
He's not good enough.
Not good as you.

96
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,502
I need you, Deck.

97
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,016
Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.

98
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,788
I need the old Blade Runner.

99
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,551
I need your magic.

100
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,714
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

101
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,459
L'm twice as quit now.

102
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,467
Stop right where you are.
You know the score, pal?

103
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,454
If you're not cop, you're little people.

104
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,001
No choice, huh?

105
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,399
No choice, pal.

106
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,812
I already had an IQ test this year,

107
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,106
I don 't think I've ever
had one of these,

108
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,756
Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention,

109
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,028
- Answer as quickly as you can,
- Yeah, sure,

110
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,167
1187 at Hunterwasser,

111
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,812
Yeah, That's the hotel,

112
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,194
- What?
- Where I live,

113
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,613
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess,

114
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,760
There was an escape from
the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

115
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,407
Six Replicants: Three male, three female.

116
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,068
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

117
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,544
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

118
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,527
No crew, no sight of them.

119
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,568
Three nights ago they tried to break
into Tyrell Corporation.

120
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,324
Two of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

121
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,440
We lost the others.

122
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,002
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees...

123
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,363
...I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

124
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,421
Looks like he got himself one.

125
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,100
So you look down and you see
a tortoise, It's crawling towards you,

126
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,566
- Tortoise?
- That's Leon.

127
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,864
Ammunition loader
on intergalactic runs.

128
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,087
He can lift 400-pound atomic loads
all day and night.

129
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,658
The only way you can hurt him
is to kill him.

130
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:08,166
I don't get it. What do they risk coming
back to Earth for? That's unusual. Why...?

131
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,154
What do they want
out of the Tyrell Corporation?

132
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,107
Well, you tell me, pal.
That's what you're here for.

133
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,005
- What's this?
- Nexus 6. Roy Batty.

134
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,204
Incept date: 2016.

135
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,093
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

136
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,414
Probably the leader.

137
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,480
This is Zhora.

138
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,071
She's trained for
an Off-world kick murder squad.

139
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,678
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.
She's both.

140
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,689
The fourth skin-job is Pris,
a basic pleasure model.

141
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,742
The standard item for military clubs
in the outer colonies.

142
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,698
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

143
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,023
The designers reckoned
after a few years...

144
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,673
...they might develop
their own emotional responses.

145
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,255
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

146
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,656
So they built in a fail-safe device.

147
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,114
- Which is what?
- Four-year lifespan.

148
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,780
Now, there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

149
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,136
- I want you to go put the machine on it.
- And if the machine doesn't work?

150
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,932
Do you like our owl?

151
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,161
It's artificial?

152
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,119
Of course it is.

153
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,807
Must be expensive.

154
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,471
Very. L'm Rachael.

155
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,491
Deckard.

156
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,919
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

157
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:37,050
Replicants are like any other machine:
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

158
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,029
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

159
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,029
May I ask you a personal question?

160
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,452
Sure.

161
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,800
Have you ever retired a human
by mistake?

162
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,230
No.

163
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:00,080
- But in your position, that is a risk.
- Is this to be an empathy test?

164
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,971
Capillary dilation
of the so-called blush response?

165
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,869
Fluctuation of the pupil.

166
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,876
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

167
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,266
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

168
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,546
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

169
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,431
Demonstrate it.

170
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,627
I wanna see it work.

171
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,368
- Where's the subject?
- I wanna see it work on a person.

172
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,447
I wanna see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.

173
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,373
What's that gonna prove?

174
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,319
Indulge me.

175
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,052
On you?

176
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,511
Try her.

177
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,115
It's too bright in here.

178
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,774
Do you mind if I smoke?

179
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,602
It won't affect the test.

180
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,873
All right, l'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

181
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,449
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

182
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,172
It's your birthday.
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

183
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,231
I wouldn't accept it.

184
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:53,713
Also, l'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

185
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,183
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection...

186
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,242
...plus the killing jar.

187
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,307
L'd take him to the doctor.

188
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,693
You're watching television.

189
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,515
Suddenly you realize
there's a wasp crawling on your arm.

190
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,915
L'd kill it.

191
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,402
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

192
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,761
Is this testing whether l'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

193
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,256
Just answer the questions, please.

194
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,376
You show it to your husband.

195
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,045
He likes it so much
he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

196
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,721
- Bush outside your window?

197
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,223
I wouldn't let him.

198
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,849
- Orange body, green legs?

199
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,351
Why not?

200
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,614
I should be enough for him.

201
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,370
One more question.

202
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,166
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

203
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:01,424
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

204
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,719
The entree consists of boiled dog.

205
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,920
Would you step out
for a few moments, Rachael?

206
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,260
Thank you.

207
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,863
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

208
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,804
L'm impressed.

209
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,611
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

210
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,481
- I don't get it, Tyrell.
- How many questions?

211
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,359
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

212
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,081
It took more than a hundred for Rachael,
didn't it?

213
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,106
She doesn't know.

214
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,074
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

215
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,307
Suspect?
How can it not know what it is?

216
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,613
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

217
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,055
'More human than human' is our motto.

218
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,839
Rachael is an experiment, nothing more.

219
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:12,393
We began to recognize in them
a strange obsession.

220
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:16,025
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced, with only a few years...

221
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,692
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

222
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:25,285
If we gift them with a past, we create
a cushion or a pillow for their emotions...

223
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,352
...then consequently
we can control them better.

224
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,392
Memories.

225
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,519
You're talking about memories.

226
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,293
Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention,

227
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,450
- Now answer as quickly as you can,
- Sure,

228
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,215
- 1187 at Hunterwasser,
- Yeah, That's the hotel,

229
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,644
- What?
- Where I live,

230
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,429
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess,

231
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,417
- Is that part of the test?
- No,

232
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,108
Kowalski.

233
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,623
Time...

234
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,041
...enough.

235
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,995
Did you get your precious photos?

236
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,029
Someone was there.

237
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,472
Men?

238
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:54,486
Policemen?

239
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:29,888
Fiery the angels fell

240
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:33,308
Deep thunder rolled around their shores

241
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:37,059
Burning with the fires of Orc

242
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:43,307
You not come here! Illegal!

243
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:47,932
Hey! Hey!

244
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,411
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

245
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,741
Yes.

246
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,455
Questions.

247
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:15,593
Hey! Hey!

248
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,107
Morphology. Longevity. Incept dates.

249
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:34,896
Don't know.

250
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,326
I don't know such stuff.

251
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,179
I just do eyes.

252
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:44,148
Just eyes, just genetic design.

253
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,184
Just eyes.

254
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,294
You Nexus, huh?

255
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,031
I design your eyes.

256
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:55,227
Chew...

257
00:28:55,485 --> 00:29:00,354
...if only you could see
what l've seen with your eyes.

258
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,571
Now...

259
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,578
...questions.

260
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,819
I don't know answers.

261
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,832
Who does?

262
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,730
Tyrell.

263
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,281
He knows everything.

264
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,490
Tyrell Corporation?

265
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,638
He big boss. Big genius.
He design your mind.

266
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,769
Your brain, huh?

267
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,655
Smart.

268
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,598
Very cold.

269
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:38,286
Not an easy man to see...

270
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,588
Give me coat.

271
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,140
...I guess?

272
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,416
Sebastian.

273
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,356
He take you there.
He take you there.

274
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,104
Sebastian who?

275
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:03,390
J. F...

276
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:06,511
...Sebast...

277
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,976
Now...

278
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,476
...where...

279
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,689
...would we find this...

280
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:21,215
...J.F. Sebastian?

281
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,146
Let's continue, shall we?

282
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,398
Describe in single words...

283
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,175
... only the good things that come
into your mind about your mother,

284
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,533
- My mother?
- Yeah,

285
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,304
I'll tell you about my mother,

286
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,431
Voice print identification,
Your floor number, please,

287
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:03,807
- Deckard, 97.
- 97, Thank you, Danke.

288
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,951
I wanted to see you.

289
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,072
So I waited.

290
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,221
Let me help you.

291
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,552
What do I need help for?

292
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,716
I don't know why
he told you what he did.

293
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,024
Talk to him.

294
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,773
He wouldn't see me.

295
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,969
You want a drink?

296
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,117
No?

297
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,819
You think l'm a Replicant, don't you?

298
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,163
Look.

299
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,667
It's me with my mother.

300
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,340
Yeah?

301
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,099
Remember when you were 6?

302
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:42,891
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window.

303
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,443
You were gonna play doctor?

304
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,894
He showed you his, and when it got
to be your turn, you chickened and ran.

305
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,812
Remember that?

306
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:58,297
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody, huh?

307
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:03,719
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

308
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,926
Orange body, green legs?

309
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,834
Watched her build a web all summer?

310
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,424
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

311
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,339
The egg hatched...

312
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:17,011
- The egg hatched...
- And?

313
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,372
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.

314
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,984
And they ate her.

315
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,551
Implants.

316
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,440
Those aren't your memories,
they're somebody else's.

317
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:35,076
They're Tyrell's niece's.

318
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,786
Okay.

319
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,538
Bad joke.

320
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,289
I made a bad joke.

321
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,120
You're not a Replicant.

322
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:51,352
Go home.

323
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,165
Okay?

324
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,368
No, really. L'm sorry.

325
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,711
Go home.

326
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:14,838
Want a drink?

327
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,922
L'II get you a drink.

328
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,414
L'II get a glass.

329
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,051
Hey!

330
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,408
You forgot your bag.

331
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,890
L'm lost.

332
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,227
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

333
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:35,630
What's your name?

334
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:39,054
- Pris.
- Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

335
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:41,317
- Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,732
Oh, where were you going?

337
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,349
Home?

338
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:53,545
I don't have one.

339
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:59,203
We scared each other pretty good,
didn't we?

340
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,182
We sure did.

341
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:08,958
L'm hungry, J.F.

342
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,791
I got stuff inside.

343
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,709
You wanna come in?

344
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:16,167
I was hoping you'd say that.

345
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:52,502
Do you live in this building
all by yourself?

346
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,804
Yeah, I live here
pretty much alone right now.

347
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,993
No housing shortage around here.

348
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,585
Plenty of room for everybody.

349
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,934
Watch out for the water.

350
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:19,756
Must get Ionely here, J.F.

351
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,515
Not really. I make friends.

352
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:28,030
They're toys. My friends are toys.
I make them.

353
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,575
It's a hobby. L'm a genetic designer.

354
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:32,644
Do you know what that is?

355
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:34,404
No.

356
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:37,869
Now.

357
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,282
Yoo-hoo, home again.

358
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:53,081
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

359
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,328
- Good evening, J.F.
- Evening, fellas.

360
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:10,527
They're my friends. I made them.

361
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,556
Where are your folks?

362
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:14,239
L'm sort of an orphan.

363
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:16,620
What about your friends?

364
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:19,206
I have some, but I have to find them.

365
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:21,947
L'II let them know where I am tomorrow.

366
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:30,017
Can I take those things for you?
They're soaked, aren't they?

367
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,899
Enhance 224 to 176.

368
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:31,008
Enhance.

369
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,635
Stop.

370
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,211
Move in.

371
00:43:48,461 --> 00:43:50,019
Stop.

372
00:43:50,755 --> 00:43:52,473
Pull out, track right.

373
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:54,434
Stop.

374
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,069
Center and pull back.

375
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:02,103
Stop.

376
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:04,986
Track 45 right.

377
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:08,174
Stop.

378
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:10,116
Center and stop.

379
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:19,030
Enhance 34 to 36.

380
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:31,269
Pan right and pull back.

381
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:33,726
Stop.

382
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:40,900
Enhance 34 to 46.

383
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:54,895
Pull back.

384
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:56,954
Wait a minute. Go right.

385
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,048
Stop.

386
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:01,886
Enhance 57-19.

387
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:06,767
Track 45 left.

388
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,293
Stop.

389
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:14,684
Enhance 15 to 23.

390
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,959
Give me a hard copy right there.

391
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:26,339
Fish?

392
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:44,630
I think it was manufactured locally.

393
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:53,822
Finest quality. Superior workmanship.

394
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:57,006
There is the maker's serial number.

395
00:46:57,275 --> 00:47:03,544
9906947-XB71.

396
00:47:04,574 --> 00:47:05,848
Interesting.

397
00:47:07,035 --> 00:47:10,789
Not fish. Snake scale.

398
00:47:11,122 --> 00:47:12,475
Snake.

399
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:17,178
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.
He make this snake!

400
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:20,737
Abdul Hassan?

401
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,091
L'm a police officer.
L'd like to ask you a few questions.

402
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:28,363
Artificial snake license XB71, that's you?

403
00:48:29,492 --> 00:48:32,211
This is your work, huh?
Who did you sell it to?

404
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:35,089
My work? Not too many
could afford such quality.

405
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:36,442
How many?

406
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,782
- Very few.
- How few?

407
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:40,636
- Look, my friend...
- Taffey Lewis'.

408
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:44,189
Down in Fourth Sector, Chinatown.

409
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:49,501
Cross now, Cross now, Cross now,

410
00:48:49,846 --> 00:48:54,124
Cross now, Cross now, Cross now,

411
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:57,388
Cross now, Cross now,

412
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:22,587
Bartender.

413
00:49:26,257 --> 00:49:28,088
Taffey Lewis?

414
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:30,406
Thank you.

415
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,270
- Taffey?
- Yeah?

416
00:49:35,975 --> 00:49:38,125
L'd like to ask you a few questions.

417
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:40,113
Blow.

418
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:44,086
You ever buy snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

419
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:45,712
All the time, pal.

420
00:49:48,613 --> 00:49:49,887
You ever see this girl, huh?

421
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:52,882
Never seen her. Buzz off.

422
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:54,870
Your licenses in order, pal?

423
00:49:55,745 --> 00:49:57,178
Hey, Louie.

424
00:49:57,414 --> 00:50:01,805
The man is dry. Give him one
on the house, okay? See?

425
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:45,974
Hello?

426
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:51,392
L've had people walk out on me before,
but not when...

427
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:53,834
...I was being so charming.

428
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:57,974
L'm in a bar, here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

429
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:00,620
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

430
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:03,924
Why don't you come on down here
and have a drink?

431
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,664
I don 't think so, Mr, Deckard,

432
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:09,258
That's not my kind of place,

433
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:10,975
Go someplace else?

434
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:29,395
Ladies and gentlemen...

435
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:34,701
... Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake,

436
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:39,293
Watch her take the pleasure
from the serpent...

437
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:43,236
... that once corrupted man,

438
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:28,239
Excuse me, Miss Salome,
can I talk to you for a minute?

439
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:32,482
L'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

440
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:33,808
Oh, yeah?

441
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:37,658
L'm not here to make you join.
No, ma'am. That's not my department.

442
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,788
Actually...

443
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:46,269
...l'm from the Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

444
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:49,169
Committee of Moral Abuses?

445
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,489
There's been reports
that the management...

446
00:52:51,755 --> 00:52:53,825
...has been taking liberties
with the artists.

447
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,489
I don't know nothing about it.

448
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:58,595
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

449
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:01,242
How do you mean 'exploited'?

450
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:03,948
Well, like to get this job.

451
00:53:04,225 --> 00:53:08,935
I mean, did you do, or were you
asked to do, anything that's...

452
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:11,430
...lewd or unsavory or...

453
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:15,400
...otherwise repulsive
to your person, huh?

454
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:21,034
- Are you for real?
- Oh, yeah.

455
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:24,443
L'd like to check
your dressing room, if I may.

456
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:27,340
- For what?
- For holes.

457
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:28,613
Holes?

458
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:31,506
Well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

459
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:34,514
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

460
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:38,870
No, I wouldn't.

461
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:41,130
Little...

462
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:46,621
...dirty holes they drill in the wall
so they can watch a lady undress.

463
00:54:20,218 --> 00:54:23,415
- Is this a real snake?
- Of course it's not real.

464
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:27,681
Think l'd be working in a place like this
if I could afford a real snake?

465
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:44,826
So if somebody does try to exploit me,
who do I go to about it?

466
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:49,111
- Me.
- You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

467
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,408
The only thing they care about...

468
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:18,766
Hey!

469
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:48,166
Cross now, Cross now,

470
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,487
Cross now, Cross now,

471
00:56:51,786 --> 00:56:54,380
Cross now, Cross now,

472
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:57,462
Cross now, Cross now,

473
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:00,948
Cross now, Cross now,

474
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:03,783
Don 't walk, Don 't walk,

475
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:06,085
Don 't walk, Don 't walk,

476
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:09,255
Don 't walk, Don 't walk, Don 't walk,

477
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:27,022
Cross now, Cross now,

478
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:30,203
Cross now, Cross now,

479
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:32,642
Cross now, Cross now,

480
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:36,331
Cross now, Cross now,

481
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,136
Cross now, Cross now,

482
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,127
Move! Get out of the way!

483
00:59:26,524 --> 00:59:28,037
Deckard.

484
00:59:28,276 --> 00:59:29,789
B26354.

485
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:39,007
Move on, Move on,

486
00:59:39,287 --> 00:59:41,437
Move on, Move on,

487
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:44,778
Move on, Move on,

488
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,228
A minute.

489
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:56,031
Yeah, what do you want?

490
00:59:56,262 --> 00:59:57,980
Tsingtao.

491
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,061
This enough?

492
01:00:07,315 --> 01:00:08,748
Yeah.

493
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:19,244
Bryant.

494
01:00:39,222 --> 01:00:43,010
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

495
01:00:43,351 --> 01:00:44,545
L'm going home.

496
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:46,600
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

497
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:49,528
He's a goddamn one-man
slaughterhouse, that's what he is.

498
01:00:50,442 --> 01:00:52,114
Four more to go.

499
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,032
- Come on, Gaff, let's go.
- Three.

500
01:00:56,406 --> 01:00:57,521
There's three to go.

501
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:00,349
There's four.

502
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:03,337
That skin-job you VK'd
at the Tyrell Corporation...

503
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:07,330
...Rachael, disappeared, vanished.
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

504
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:10,420
Something to do with a brain implant,
says Tyrell.

505
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:13,909
Come on, Gaff.
Drink some for me, huh, pal?

506
01:01:58,677 --> 01:01:59,666
Leon.

507
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:01,524
How old am I?

508
01:02:05,725 --> 01:02:07,522
I don't know.

509
01:02:09,854 --> 01:02:12,971
My birthday's April 10, 2017.
How long do I live?

510
01:02:13,274 --> 01:02:14,992
Four years.

511
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,269
More than you.

512
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:30,970
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

513
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:39,748
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

514
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,197
I agree.

515
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:55,275
Wake up. Time to die.

516
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:32,274
Shakes?

517
01:03:33,938 --> 01:03:35,451
Me too.

518
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,317
I get them bad.

519
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:49,063
It's part of the business.

520
01:03:56,419 --> 01:03:57,738
L'm not in the business.

521
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:13,467
I am the business.

522
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:47,682
What if I go north?

523
01:05:51,826 --> 01:05:52,815
Disappear.

524
01:05:58,291 --> 01:05:59,565
Would you come after me?

525
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:03,391
Hunt me?

526
01:06:08,218 --> 01:06:09,776
No.

527
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:14,425
No, I wouldn't.

528
01:06:20,271 --> 01:06:21,386
I owe you one.

529
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:38,855
But somebody would.

530
01:06:51,302 --> 01:06:53,133
Deckard...

531
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:57,752
...you know those files on me?

532
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:02,655
The incept date. The longevity.

533
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,812
Those things.

534
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:07,986
You saw them?

535
01:07:11,489 --> 01:07:13,161
They're...

536
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:14,557
...classified.

537
01:07:14,784 --> 01:07:17,173
But you're a policeman.

538
01:07:17,454 --> 01:07:19,445
I...

539
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:21,583
...didn't look at them.

540
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:25,902
You know,
that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

541
01:07:27,088 --> 01:07:29,886
...did you ever take that test yourself?

542
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,488
Deckard.

543
01:10:13,838 --> 01:10:15,510
I dreamt music.

544
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:23,276
I didn't know if I could play.

545
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:27,697
I remember lessons.

546
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:32,475
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

547
01:10:37,278 --> 01:10:39,473
You play beautifully.

548
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:51,998
Now you kiss me.

549
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:54,920
I can't rely on my...

550
01:11:55,148 --> 01:11:57,662
Say, 'Kiss me.'

551
01:12:00,528 --> 01:12:02,325
Kiss me.

552
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,706
I want you.

553
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,359
I want you.

554
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:22,103
Again.

555
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:24,139
I want you.

556
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:29,698
Put your hands on me.

557
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:54,795
- What you doing?
- L'm sorry. Just peeking.

558
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:01,805
- How do I look?
- You look better.

559
01:14:02,108 --> 01:14:05,020
- Just better?
- Well...

560
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,514
...you look beautiful.

561
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,792
Thanks.

562
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,122
How old are you?

563
01:14:22,128 --> 01:14:24,084
Twenty-five.

564
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:27,137
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

565
01:14:27,425 --> 01:14:28,699
What's that?

566
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:31,805
My glands, they grow old too fast.

567
01:14:33,139 --> 01:14:37,178
- Is that why you're still on Earth?
- Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

568
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:41,504
Anyway...

569
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:43,130
...I kind of like it here.

570
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,737
I like you...

571
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:49,182
...just the way you are.

572
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:54,210
Hi, Roy.

573
01:14:54,452 --> 01:14:55,805
Hi.

574
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:57,675
Gosh, you...

575
01:14:57,914 --> 01:15:00,109
...really got some nice toys here.

576
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,650
This is the friend I was telling you about.

577
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:05,991
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

578
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:07,730
Sebastian.

579
01:15:08,466 --> 01:15:11,060
I like a man that stays put.

580
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:15,918
You live here all by yourself, do you?

581
01:15:16,224 --> 01:15:17,213
Yes.

582
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,095
How about some breakfast?

583
01:15:31,364 --> 01:15:33,241
I was just gonna make some.

584
01:15:33,491 --> 01:15:34,480
Excuse me.

585
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:43,474
Well?

586
01:15:45,795 --> 01:15:46,989
Leon...

587
01:15:47,213 --> 01:15:49,124
What's going on?

588
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:55,149
There's only two of us now.

589
01:15:57,432 --> 01:16:00,390
Then we're stupid and we'II die.

590
01:16:04,564 --> 01:16:06,680
No, we won't.

591
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:41,255
No.

592
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:43,865
Knight takes queen, see?

593
01:16:44,145 --> 01:16:45,976
Won't do.

594
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:56,442
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

595
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,019
Because...

596
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:00,313
...you're so different.

597
01:17:01,955 --> 01:17:03,946
You're so perfect.

598
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:08,693
Yes.

599
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:10,998
What generation are you?

600
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:20,371
Nexus 6.

601
01:17:21,474 --> 01:17:22,793
I knew it.

602
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:26,135
Because I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

603
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,554
There's some of me in you.

604
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:31,405
Show me something.

605
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:33,323
Like what?

606
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,401
Like anything.

607
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:41,920
We're no computers, Sebastian.
We're physical.

608
01:17:43,913 --> 01:17:46,063
I think, Sebastian...

609
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:48,642
...therefore, I am.

610
01:17:48,918 --> 01:17:52,069
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

611
01:18:19,115 --> 01:18:20,787
We've got a lot in common.

612
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:23,184
- What do you mean?
- Similar problems.

613
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:26,126
Accelerated decrepitude.

614
01:18:28,124 --> 01:18:30,797
I don't know much about bio-mechanics,
Roy. I wish I did.

615
01:18:33,004 --> 01:18:35,393
If we don't find help soon...

616
01:18:35,674 --> 01:18:38,472
...Pris hasn't got long to live.

617
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,432
We can't allow that.

618
01:18:42,722 --> 01:18:45,794
- Is he good?
- Who?

619
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:49,332
- Your opponent.
- Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

620
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:52,956
L've only beaten him once in chess.
He's a genius.

621
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,349
He designed you.

622
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:01,290
Maybe he could help.

623
01:19:01,574 --> 01:19:04,008
L'd be happy to mention it to him.

624
01:19:06,204 --> 01:19:09,560
Better if I talk to him in person.

625
01:19:12,836 --> 01:19:17,671
But I understand
he's a sort of hard man to get to.

626
01:19:18,049 --> 01:19:19,926
Yes.

627
01:19:20,176 --> 01:19:21,734
Very.

628
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:27,032
Will you help us?

629
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:29,125
I can't.

630
01:19:29,352 --> 01:19:31,263
We need you, Sebastian.

631
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:34,274
You're our best and only friend.

632
01:19:47,412 --> 01:19:49,767
We're so happy you found us.

633
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,699
I don't think
there's another human being...

634
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,155
...in the whole world
who would've helped us.

635
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:48,656
66,000 Prosser & Ankovich.

636
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:51,374
Trade.

637
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:54,240
- Trade at two...
- Blue entry,

638
01:20:55,355 --> 01:20:58,586
A Mr, J, F, Sebastian,

639
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:02,813
16417,

640
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:05,452
At this hour?

641
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:08,736
What can I do for you, Sebastian?

642
01:21:11,997 --> 01:21:13,430
Queen to bishop six. Check.

643
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:21,199
Nonsense.

644
01:21:21,464 --> 01:21:23,614
Just a moment.

645
01:21:26,636 --> 01:21:31,152
Queen to bishop six, ridiculous.

646
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:38,652
Queen...

647
01:21:40,358 --> 01:21:42,314
...bishop six.

648
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:49,765
Knight...

649
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:52,185
... takes queen,

650
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:01,402
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

651
01:22:01,671 --> 01:22:03,070
What are you thinking about?

652
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:06,874
Bishop to king seven.

653
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:09,091
Checkmate.

654
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:11,302
Bishop to king seven.
Checkmate, I think.

655
01:22:13,224 --> 01:22:16,341
Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?

656
01:22:16,645 --> 01:22:19,443
Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?

657
01:22:19,731 --> 01:22:21,801
Let's discuss this,

658
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:23,978
You better come up, Sebastian,

659
01:22:41,711 --> 01:22:43,588
Mr. Tyrell?

660
01:22:45,423 --> 01:22:47,061
I...

661
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,131
I brought a friend.

662
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:59,309
L'm surprised
you didn't come here sooner.

663
01:23:06,152 --> 01:23:09,144
It's not an easy thing
to meet your maker.

664
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:12,829
And what can he do for you?

665
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:17,058
Can the maker repair what he makes?

666
01:23:17,372 --> 01:23:20,569
Would you like to be modified?

667
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,752
Stay here.

668
01:23:27,966 --> 01:23:31,242
Had in mind something
a little more radical.

669
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:33,881
What...?

670
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:36,528
What seems to be the problem?

671
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,489
- Death.
- Death.

672
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:43,228
Well, l'm afraid that's
a little out of my jurisdiction. You...

673
01:23:43,523 --> 01:23:46,356
I want more life...

674
01:23:46,651 --> 01:23:47,879
...father.

675
01:23:52,824 --> 01:23:54,894
The facts of life.

676
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:59,084
To make an alteration in the...

677
01:23:59,372 --> 01:24:01,681
...evolvement of
an organic life system is fatal.

678
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:05,394
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

679
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:06,701
Why not?

680
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:08,832
Because by the second day
of incubation...

681
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:13,402
...any cells that have undergone
reversion mutations...

682
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:17,835
...give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

683
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:19,901
Then the ship sinks.

684
01:24:20,143 --> 01:24:23,533
What about EMS recombination?

685
01:24:23,855 --> 01:24:25,334
We've already tried it.

686
01:24:25,565 --> 01:24:29,683
Ethyl methane sulfonate is an
alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.

687
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:33,987
It created a virus so lethal the...

688
01:24:34,324 --> 01:24:36,394
...subject was dead
before he left the table.

689
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:39,618
Then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells.

690
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:43,701
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

691
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:48,558
So that the newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

692
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:51,675
...and you've got a virus again.

693
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:56,245
But this, all of this, is...

694
01:24:56,596 --> 01:24:58,109
...academic.

695
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:00,737
You were made
as well as we could make you.

696
01:25:01,017 --> 01:25:02,689
But not to last.

697
01:25:03,561 --> 01:25:06,633
The light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long.

698
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,979
And you have burned
so very, very brightly, Roy.

699
01:25:11,778 --> 01:25:13,450
Look at you.

700
01:25:13,697 --> 01:25:16,131
You're the prodigal son.

701
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:19,798
You're quite a prize.

702
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:27,062
L've done...

703
01:25:27,293 --> 01:25:28,851
...questionable things.

704
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:30,918
Also extraordinary things.

705
01:25:31,589 --> 01:25:33,898
Revel in your time.

706
01:25:37,929 --> 01:25:42,286
Nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

707
01:26:34,694 --> 01:26:37,333
Sorry, Sebastian.

708
01:26:37,822 --> 01:26:40,655
Come. Come.

709
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:31,843
Body identified with Tyrell
is a 25-year-old male Caucasian,

710
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:34,929
Name: Sebastian, J, F, Sebastian,

711
01:27:35,213 --> 01:27:39,889
Address: Bradbury Apartments,
Ninth Sector, NF46751,

712
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,818
I want you to go down there and...

713
01:27:45,932 --> 01:27:48,810
This sector's closed to ground traffic,
What're you doing here?

714
01:27:49,102 --> 01:27:52,651
- L'm working. What are you doing?
- Arresting you, that's what I'm doing,

715
01:27:52,981 --> 01:27:57,497
l'm Deckard, Blade Runner.
26354. l'm filed and monitored.

716
01:27:57,861 --> 01:27:59,055
Hold on, Checking,

717
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:06,832
Okay, Checked and cleared,
Have a better one,

718
01:28:17,547 --> 01:28:19,458
- Hello,
- Hi. Is J.F. There?

719
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:22,992
- Who is it?
- This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.

720
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:28,653
That's no way to treat a friend.

721
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,276
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

722
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:33,365
Good evening, J.F.

723
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:45,422
Tea?

724
01:31:46,798 --> 01:31:48,550
More tea?

725
01:31:49,718 --> 01:31:50,707
Tea?

726
01:32:00,312 --> 01:32:02,382
More tea?

727
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:06,113
Tea?

728
01:32:07,777 --> 01:32:09,574
More tea?

729
01:32:11,281 --> 01:32:13,158
More tea?

730
01:32:25,629 --> 01:32:27,426
More tea?

731
01:35:33,149 --> 01:35:36,744
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

732
01:35:38,446 --> 01:35:41,722
I thought you were
supposed to be good.

733
01:35:43,159 --> 01:35:45,719
Aren't you the good man?

734
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:54,140
Come on, Deckard.

735
01:35:55,505 --> 01:35:57,302
Show me...

736
01:35:58,216 --> 01:36:00,252
...what you're made of.

737
01:36:12,355 --> 01:36:14,152
Proud of yourself, little man?

738
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:23,867
This is for Zhora.

739
01:36:25,535 --> 01:36:26,809
This is for Pris.

740
01:36:34,044 --> 01:36:35,477
Come on, Deckard.

741
01:36:36,087 --> 01:36:39,159
L'm right here,
but you've gotta shoot straight.

742
01:36:40,675 --> 01:36:42,905
Straight doesn't seem
to be good enough!

743
01:36:43,178 --> 01:36:44,213
Now it's my turn.

744
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:49,688
L'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

745
01:36:50,602 --> 01:36:51,796
One.

746
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,090
Two.

747
01:37:06,201 --> 01:37:07,998
Three.

748
01:37:08,244 --> 01:37:10,075
Four.

749
01:37:22,467 --> 01:37:24,059
Pris.

750
01:38:34,706 --> 01:38:38,904
L'm coming.

751
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:40,970
Deckard!

752
01:38:43,465 --> 01:38:44,693
Four, five

753
01:38:48,011 --> 01:38:51,048
How to stay alive?

754
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:15,637
I can see you!

755
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:43,711
Not yet!

756
01:39:43,984 --> 01:39:44,973
Not...

757
01:40:17,809 --> 01:40:19,481
Five.

758
01:40:22,814 --> 01:40:24,293
Five.

759
01:40:28,528 --> 01:40:29,677
Yes.

760
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,053
You better get it up.

761
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:41,227
Or l'm gonna have to kill you.

762
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:44,484
Unless you're alive, you can't play.

763
01:40:44,753 --> 01:40:46,630
And if you don't play...

764
01:40:56,348 --> 01:40:58,464
Six, seven

765
01:40:58,725 --> 01:41:00,556
Go to hell or go to heaven

766
01:41:08,109 --> 01:41:09,747
Good, that's the spirit!

767
01:41:51,152 --> 01:41:53,222
That hurt.

768
01:41:56,616 --> 01:41:58,652
That was irrational of you.

769
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,978
Not to mention...

770
01:42:02,664 --> 01:42:04,939
...unsportsmanlike.

771
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,990
Where are you going?

772
01:45:15,565 --> 01:45:19,274
Quite an experience to live in fear,
isn't it?

773
01:45:21,154 --> 01:45:24,066
That's what it is to be a slave.

774
01:46:23,091 --> 01:46:24,319
L've...

775
01:46:24,551 --> 01:46:29,386
...seen things
you people wouldn't believe.

776
01:46:31,182 --> 01:46:36,131
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

777
01:46:38,273 --> 01:46:40,503
I watched C-beams...

778
01:46:40,817 --> 01:46:44,332
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhauser Gate.

779
01:46:48,658 --> 01:46:50,614
All those...

780
01:46:50,869 --> 01:46:53,781
...moments will be lost...

781
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,230
...in time...

782
01:46:57,876 --> 01:47:00,026
...like...

783
01:47:00,295 --> 01:47:01,967
...tears...

784
01:47:03,465 --> 01:47:05,615
...in rain.

785
01:47:09,304 --> 01:47:11,772
Time to die.

786
01:48:17,831 --> 01:48:20,629
You've done a man's job, sir.

787
01:48:26,423 --> 01:48:28,698
I guess you're through, huh?

788
01:48:30,844 --> 01:48:32,562
Finished.

789
01:48:54,659 --> 01:48:57,537
It's too bad she won't live.

790
01:48:58,663 --> 01:49:01,052
But then again, who does?

791
01:49:34,783 --> 01:49:36,580
Rachael?

792
01:49:44,376 --> 01:49:46,014
Rachael?

793
01:49:59,975 --> 01:50:01,488
Rachael?

794
01:51:08,293 --> 01:51:10,011
Do you love me?

795
01:51:11,212 --> 01:51:12,884
I love you.

796
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,637
Do you trust me?

797
01:51:16,926 --> 01:51:18,803
I trust you.

798
01:51:28,229 --> 01:51:29,901
Rachael?

799
01:52:09,562 --> 01:52:12,315
It's too bad she won 't live,

800
01:52:12,607 --> 01:52:15,121
But then again, who does?
