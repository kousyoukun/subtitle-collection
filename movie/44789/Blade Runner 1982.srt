45

這是測試的一部份嗎？
Is that part of the test?

46

不，只是讓你熱身，就這樣

- 什麼？　- 哪一個沙漠？
-What?　-What desert?

53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,990
是哪個沙漠並無分別，這完全是假設

61
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,080
但我明白你的意思
But I understand what you mean.

62
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,200
你伸手下去，你把烏龜背朝下翻過來，里昂
You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back. Leon.

63
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,330

64
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,810
還是他們寫下來給你的？
Or do they write them down for you?

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,950
烏龜背朝下躺著，腹部在太陽下烤著
The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the sun...

66
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,920
拍打四肢，想把自己翻過來，但辦不到...
...beating its legs, trying to turn itself over, but it can't...

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,040
除非有你幫忙，但是你沒幫忙
...not without your help. But you're not helping.

68
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,670
你什麼意思，我沒幫忙？
What do you mean I'm not helping?

69
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,470
我的意思是你沒幫忙
I mean, you're not helping.

70
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,220
為什麼會這樣，里昂？
Why is that, Leon?

71
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,190
這些只是問題，里昂
They're just questions, Leon.

72
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,900
回答你的詢問，是他們寫給我的
In answer to your query, they're written down for me.

73
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,570
這是個測試，設計來激發情緒反應
It's a test designed to provoke an emotional response.

74
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,580
我們可以繼續嗎？

75
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,250
用一個詞來描述

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,750
只說你心裏想到的好處

77
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,010
關於你的母親

105
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,230
如果我只是叫你，你不會來的
You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to.

106
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,820
坐下，夥計

107
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,300

Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.

108
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,240
有四個皮子貨在街上閒晃
I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks ago...

111
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
所以我們知道他們在附近

113
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,940
永遠不會有人發現他們在這裏
No one's ever gonna find out they're down here.

114
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,440
因為你要找到他們，把他們排除掉
Because you're gonna spot them and air them out.

115
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,570
我不在這裏上班了

116
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,700
交給霍爾登吧，他不錯

我給了

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,200
他還可以呼吸，只要沒人拔他管子
He can breathe okay as long as nobody unplugs him.

119
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,080
他不夠好，沒你行
He's not good enough. Not good as you.

120
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,630
我需要你，戴克，這次很糟，最糟的
I need you, Deck. Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.

121
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,420
我需要老的銀翼殺手
I need the old Blade Runner.

122
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,110
我需要你的魔力

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,430
我進來之前就辭職了，布萊恩特
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

124
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,300
我現在更加要辭職
I'm twice as quit now.

125
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,920
原地站住！

你知道實情的，夥計
You know the score, pal?

127

你要不是警察的話，就只是個小人物
If you're not cop, you're little people.

128
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,950
沒得選，嗯？
No choice, huh?

129
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,120
沒得選，夥計

我今年已經做過智力測驗

我覺得沒做過這種
I don 't think I've ever had one of these.

138
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,780
兩周前有人從地外殖民地逃走
There was an escape from the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

139
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,300
六個複製人，三男三女
Six Replicants: three male, three female.

140
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,230
他們屠殺了23人，偷襲了一艘穿梭船
They slaughtered 23 people and jumped a shuttle.

141
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,560
空中巡邏隊在海岸發現了那艘船
An aerial patrol spotted the ship off the coast.

142
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,630
沒有船員，沒有他們的蹤跡
No crew, no sight of them.

143
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,030
三天前，夜裏他們想闖入泰瑞爾公司
Three nights ago they tried to break into Tyrell Corporation.

144
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,550
其中兩人穿過一個電場時給燒死
Two of them got fried running through an electrical field.

145
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,330
我們跟丟了其他人
We lost the others.

146
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,000
有可能，他們也許會試圖作為僱員潛入
On the possibility they might try to infiltrate as employees...

147
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,460
我叫霍爾登去對新工人做沃伊特-坎普測試
...I had Holden go over and run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

148
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,380
看起來他找到了一個
Looks like he got himself one.

149
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,260
你往下看，看見一隻烏龜，對你爬過來
So you look down and you see a tortoise. It's crawling towards you.

150
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,600
那是里昂
That's Leon.

151
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,940
星際彈藥運輸者
Ammunition loader on intergalactic runs.

152
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,190
他能整日整夜扛著400磅原子負載
He can lift 400-pound atomic loads all day and night.

153
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,730
唯一能傷到他的辦法就是殺了他
The only way you can hurt him is to kill him.

154
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,340
我沒搞懂，他們冒險回地球來幹嘛？
I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to Earth for?

155
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,290
這不尋常，為什麼...
...That's unusual. Why...?

156
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,070
他們想從泰瑞爾公司得到什麼?
What do they want out of the Tyrell Corporation?

157
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,150
這得你告訴我，夥計，所以才找你來
Well, you tell me, pal. That's what you're here for.

158
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,420
- 這是什麼？　- Nexus 6 型
-What's this?　-Nexus 6.

159
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,960
羅伊·貝迪　啟動日期：2016年
Roy Batty.  Incept date: 2016.

160
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,170
戰鬥型號，最優自給
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

161
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,180
可能是帶頭的
Probably the leader.

162
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,350
這是佐拉
This is Zhora.

163
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,600
她被訓練成為地外世界的刺殺組
She's trained for an Off-world kick murder squad.

164
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,770
說到美女與野獸
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.

165
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,230
她兩者都是
She's both.

166
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,800
第四個皮子貨是普莉絲，基本娛樂型號
The fourth skin-job is Pris, a basic pleasure modeI.

167
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,320
外部殖民地軍人俱樂部的標準項目
The standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies.

168
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,620
他們的設計各方面都是複製人類，除了他們的感情
They were designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions.

169
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,700
但設計者估算經過幾年...
The designers reckoned after a few years...

170
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,130
他們可能會發展出自己的情緒反應
...they might develop their own emotional responses.

171
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,420
仇恨、愛、恐懼、憤怒、羨慕
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

172
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,280
所以他們造了失效保護裝置
So they built in a fail-safe device.

173
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,880
那是什麼呢？
Which is what?

174
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,680
四年的預期壽命
Four-year lifespan.

175
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,940
現在，泰瑞爾公司那邊有一個Nexus 6 型
Now, there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation.

176
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,680
我要你過去用機器測測它
I want you to go put the machine on it.

177
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,100
要是機器不管用呢？
And if the machine doesn't work?

178
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,700
你喜歡我們的貓頭鷹嗎？
Do you like our owl?

179
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,040
它是人造的？
It's artificial?

180
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,730
它當然是
Of course it is.

181
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,330
一定很貴
Must be expensive.

182
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,500
非常貴，我是瑞秋
Very. I'm Rachael.

183
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,040
戴卡德
Deckard.

184
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,630
看起來你感覺我們的工作對大眾無益
It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.

185
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,260
複製人像其它的機器一樣，要麼有益要麼有害
Replicants are like any other machine: They're either a benefit or a hazard.

186
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,880
如果它們有益，就不是我的問題了
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

187
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,730
我可以問你一個私人問題嗎？
May I ask you a personal question?

188
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,070
當然
Sure.

189
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,450
你曾經錯誤除役過一個人類嗎？
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

190
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,240
沒有
No.

191
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,120
但是以你的位置，那是一個風險
But in your position, that is a risk.

192
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,450
這是一個移情測試嗎?
Is this to be an empathy test?

193
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,460
毛細血管擴張，俗稱臉紅？
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?

194
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,210
瞳孔的波動
Fluctuation of the pupil.

195
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,300
虹膜無意識擴大
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

196
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,220
我們簡稱它為沃伊特-坎普
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

197
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,180
戴卡德先生，埃爾登·泰瑞爾博士
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

198
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,140
示範一下
Demonstrate it.

199
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,850
我要看看它的運作
I wanna see it work.

200
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,990
對像在哪？
Where's the subject?

201
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,220
我想看它用在一個人上
I wanna see it work on a person.

202
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,530
我要看看否定反饋，再給你提供一個肯定反饋
I wanna see a negative before I provide you with a positive.

203
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,490
那是要證明什麼？
What's that gonna prove?

204
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,860
滿足我一下
Indulge me.

205
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,990
在你身上？
On you?

206
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,660
試試她
Try her.

207
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,000
這裏太亮了
It's too bright in here.

208
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,400
你介意我抽煙嗎？
Do you mind if I smoke?

209
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,200
不會影響測試的
It won't affect the test.

210
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,050
好了，我會問你一連串的問題
AII right, I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.

211
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,380
只要放鬆，盡量簡單回答
Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.

212
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,680
你的生日
It's your birthday.

213
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,450
- 有人送給你一個小牛皮錢包　- 我不會接受
-Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.  -I wouldn't accept it.

214
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,280
同時，我會向警方舉報送給我的人
Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.

215
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
你有一個小男孩，他給你看他的蝴蝶標本
You've got a little boy.　He shows you his butterfly collection...

216
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,160
加上殺昆蟲的瓶子
...plus the killing jar.

217
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,080
我會帶他看醫生
I'd take him to the doctor.

218
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,840
你在看電視
You're watching television.

219
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,380
忽然發覺有一隻黃蜂爬在你手臂上
Suddenly you realize there's a wasp crawling on your arm.

220
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,840
我會殺了它
I'd kill it.

221
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,600
你在讀雜誌，你碰到一整頁女孩裸體照
You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

222
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,090
這是在測試我是複製人還是女同嗎，戴卡德先生？
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

223
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,560
請直接回答問題
Just answer the questions, please.

224
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,440
你把它拿給丈夫看
You show it to your husband.

225
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,990
他很喜歡，把它掛在你們臥室牆上
He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

226
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,620
我不會讓他掛
I wouldn't let him.

227
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,700
- 為什麼？　- 他有我應該就夠了
Why not?  -I should be enough for him.

228
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,130
再問一題
One more question.

229
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,300
你在看一齣舞台劇，一場宴會正在進行
You're watching a stage play, a banquet is in progress.

230
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,680
賓客正享用生蠔開胃菜
The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters.

231
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,260
主菜包括燉狗肉
The entree consists of boiled dog.

232
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,490
你可否出去一會兒，瑞秋？
Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael?

233
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,000
謝謝
Thank you.

234
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,170
- 她是複製人，對吧？　- 我很佩服
She's a Replicant, isn't she?  -I'm impressed.

235
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,930
通常要問多少問題才會認出一個來？
How many questions does it usually take to spot one?

236
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,640
- 我沒明白，泰瑞爾　- 多少個問題？
-I don't get it, Tyrell.　-How many questions?

237
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,850
20到30個，互相對照
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

238
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,020
對瑞秋來說超過100個了，不是嗎？
It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?

239
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,690
她不知道？
She doesn't know.

240
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,200
她開始懷疑了，我想
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

241
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,900
懷疑？它怎會不知道自己是什麼？
Suspect? How can it not know what it is?

242
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,720
在泰瑞爾這兒，商業是我們的目標
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

243
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,820
「比人類更人類」是我們的座右銘
''More human than human'' is our motto.

244
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,030
瑞秋是一個實驗，如此而已
Rachael is an experiment, nothing more.

245
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,620
我們開始賞識他們
We began to recognize in them

246
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,820
一種奇怪的沉迷
a strange obsession.

247
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,040
畢竟他們缺乏情感經驗
After all, they are emotionally inexperienced

248
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,210
只有幾年的時間來存儲經驗
with only a few years in which to store up the experiences

249
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,860
這經驗卻是你我坦然接受的
which you and I take for granted.

250
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,760
如果我們賜予他們一段過去
If we gift them with a past,

251
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,860
我們就給他們創造了情感依靠和安慰
we create a cushion or a pillow for their emotions...

252
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,220
從而讓我們能更好地控制他們
...then consequently we can control them better.

253
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,610
記憶
Memories.

254
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,950
你說的是記憶
You're talking about memories.

255
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,410
反應時間是一個因素，所以請專心
Reaction time is a factor, so please pay attention.

256
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,370
- 現在，你回答的越快越好　- 好的
-Now answer as quickly as you can.　-Sure.

257
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,580
杭特華沙1187號
1187 at Hunterwasser.

258
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,950
- 是那家旅館　- 什麼？
-Yeah. That's the hotel.   -What?

259
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,490
- 我住的地方　- 地方不錯？
-Where I live.   -Nice place?

260
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,460
對，當然，應該吧　這是測試的一部份？
-Yeah, sure, I guess.     -Is that part of the test?

261
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,580
不是
No.

262
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,170
科瓦爾斯基
Kowalski.

263
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,520
時間
Time...

264
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,980
夠了
...enough.

265
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,710
你拿到你寶貴的照片了嗎？
Did you get your precious photos?

266
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,670
有人在那裏
Someone was there.

267
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,840
人？
Men?

268
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,540
警察？
Policemen?

269
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,500
天使火墜
Fiery the angels fell

我想這是由本地製造的

我是警察，我想問你幾個問題
I'm a police officer. I'd like to ask you a few questions.

Artificial snake license XB71, that's you?

427
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,980

This is your work, huh? Who did you sell it to?

428
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,160
我的作品？沒多少人付得起這樣的品質
My work? Not too many could afford such quality.

429
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,210

430

445
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,470
嘿，路易，這人口渴了
Hey, Louie. The man is dry.

446
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,930
給他一杯免費的，好嗎？ 再見
Give him one on the house, okay? See?

447
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,350
喂?
Hello?

448
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:51,110
以前是有人從我身邊走開過，但不是...
I've had people walk out on me before, but not when...

449
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,690
在我那麼迷人的時候
...I was being so charming.

450
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:57,200
我在一家酒吧，此時此刻，在第四區
I'm in a bar, here now, down in the Fourth Sector.

451
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,730

Why don't you come on down here and have a drink?

453
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,210
我覺得不好，戴卡德先生
I don 't think so, Mr. Deckard.

454
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,260
那不是我去的地方
That's not my kind of place.

455
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,210
去別的地方？
Go someplace eIse?

456
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,980
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen...

457
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,190
塔菲·路易斯獻上，莎樂美小姐與蛇
... Taffey Lewis presents Miss Salome and the snake.

458
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:39,070
看她與大蛇同歡
Watch her take the pleasure from the serpent...

459
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,320
這曾經敗壞過男人哦
... that once corrupted man.

460
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,330
打擾了，莎樂美小姐，我可以跟你談一下嗎?
Excuse me, Miss Salome, can I talk to you for a minute?

461
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:31,290
我是美國聯邦綜藝藝人協會的
I'm from the American Federation of Variety Artists.

462
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,790
是嗎？
Oh, yeah?

463
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,410
我不是來這裏讓你入會的
I'm not here to make you join.

464
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,710
不，女士，那不是我的部門
No, ma'am. That's not my department.

465
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,050
事實上
Actually...

466
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:45,260
我來自機密的道德凌虐委員會
...I'm from the Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses.

467
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,920
道德凌虐委員會？
Committee of Moral Abuses?

468
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,900
對，女士，有報告說這兒的管理層
Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management...

469
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:54,480
曾經在這地方猥褻藝人
...has been taking liberties with the artists in this place.

470
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,720
這事我一無所知
I don't know nothing about it.

471
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:58,610
你有沒有感覺自己在任何方面被剝削？
Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?

472
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,200
你的「剝削」是什麼意思？
How do you mean ''exploited''?

473
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,570
比如為了得到這份工作...
Well, like to get this job.

474
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,620
我是說，你是否做過，或被要求做過任何...
I mean, did you do, or were you asked to do, anything that's...

475
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,540
下流或難堪的事
...lewd or unsavory or...

476
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,000
否則就排斥你
...otherwise repulsive to your person, huh?

477
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:20,510
- 你是當真的？　- 是的
-Are you for real?　-Oh, yeah.

478
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,620
我想...想檢查你的化妝室，可以的話
I'd like to check your dressing room, if I may.

479
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,350
- 查什麼？　- 查...查孔洞
-For what?　-For holes.

480
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,510
孔洞？
Holes?

481
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,430
你會驚訝於一個人可以通過它...
Well, you'd be surprised what a guy would go through to...

482
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,520
偷窺美麗的身體
...get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

483
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,900
不，我不會
No, I wouldn't.

484
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,400
嗯，小的...
Little...

485
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,850
...骯髒的孔洞，他們在牆上鑽孔
...dirty holes they drill in the wall

486
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,240
以觀看女士脫衣服
so they can watch a lady undress.

487
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,340
- 這是條真蛇嗎？　- 當然不是真的
-Is this a real snake?　-Of course it's not real.

488
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:27,300
你覺得我會在這種地方工作嗎，要是我買得起真蛇？
Think I'd be working in a place like this if I could afford a real snake?

489
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:44,840
那麼，要是有人真的想剝削我，我該找誰？
So if somebody does try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?

490
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,970
我
Me.

491
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,300
你是個敬業的人，給我擦乾
You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,770
等一下
A minute.

511
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:56,820
- 你要什麼？　- 青島
-Yeah, what do you want? -Tsingtao.

512
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,700
- 這夠嗎？　- 夠

513
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,520
布萊恩特
Bryant.

514
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,400
老天，戴卡德
Christ, Deckard

515
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:43,140
你看來和你扔在人行道上那個皮子貨差不多一樣糟
you look almost as bad as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

516
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,700
我要回家了
I'm going home.

517
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:46,740
可以跟他學學，蓋夫
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

518
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:50,160
他根本就是單人屠宰場，他就是這樣
He's a goddamn one-man slaughterhouse, that's what he is.

519
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:51,790
還有四個要辦
Four more to go.

520
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,290
來，蓋夫，我們走
Come on, Gaff, let's go.

521
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,580
三個
Three.

522
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:58,920
- 還有三個要辦　- 是四個
-There's three to go.  -There's four.

523
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:03,800
那個皮子貨，你在泰瑞爾公司測試的
That skin-job you VK'd at the Tyrell Corporation...

524
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,590
瑞秋，消失了，無影無蹤
...Rachael, disappeared, vanished.

525
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,300
都不知道自己是個複製人
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

526
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:10,220
跟大腦植入什麼的有關，泰瑞爾說的
Something to do with a brain implant, says Tyrell.

527
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:12,130
走吧，蓋夫
Come on, Gaff.

528
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,730
替我喝一點，老兄？
Drink some for me, huh, pal?

529
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:59,700
里昂
Leon.

530
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:00,940
我多大了？
How old am I?

531
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,990
我不知道
I don't know.

532
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:13,080
我的生日是2017年4月10日，我能活多久?
My birthday's April 10, 2017.　How long do I live?

533
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:14,660
四年
Four years.

534
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,510
比你多
More than you.

535
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,350
活在恐懼中很痛苦，不是嗎？
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

536
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,770
沒什麼比有癢處但你永遠搔不到更糟了
Nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch.

537
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:42,190
我同意
I agree.

538
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,660
醒醒，是時候死了
Wake up. Time to die.

539
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,530
發抖？
Shakes?

540
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:34,830
我也是
Me too.

541
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,000
我抖得厲害
I get them bad.

542
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,630
是這行業的一部份
It's part of the business.

543
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,100
我不是做這行的
I'm not in the business.

544
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,950
我就是這行業
I am the business.

545
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,000
要是我往北走呢？
What if I go north?

546
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,130
消失
Disappear.

547
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,260
你會不會來追我？
Would you come after me?

548
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,810
獵殺我？
Hunt me?

549
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:09,310
不
No.

550
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:13,780
不，我不會
No, I wouldn't.

551
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:21,490
我欠你一次
I owe you one.

552
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:38,300
但有人會
But somebody would.

553
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,520
戴卡德
Deckard...

554
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,530
你知道我的那些檔案？
...you know those files on me?

555
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,780
啟動日期
The incept date.

556
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:03,700
壽命，那些事
The longevity. Those things.

557
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,710
你看過？
You saw them?

558
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:14,090
那些是...機密
They're......classified.

559
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:16,470
但你是個警察
But you're a policeman.

560
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,430
我……沒有看過
I......didn't look at them.

561
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,390
你知道，你那個沃伊特-坎普測試
You know, that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

562
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:29,560
你曾經測試過自己嗎?
...did you ever take that test yourself?

563
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:42,910
戴卡德？
Deckard.

564
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,100
我夢到音樂
I dreamt music.

565
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,860
我不知道自己會不會彈
I didn't know if I could play.

566
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:26,700
我記得上過課
I remember lessons.

567
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:31,450
我不知道那是我...還是泰瑞爾的侄女
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

568
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,920
你彈得很美
You play beautifully.

569
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,030
現在，你吻我
Now you kiss me.

570
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:56,500
- 我不能依靠我的...　- 說，"吻我"
-I can't rely on my...     -Say, ''Kiss me. ''

571
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:01,700
吻我
Kiss me.

572
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,100
我要你
I want you.

573
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,350
我要你
I want you.

574
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,730
再說
Again.

575
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:23,610
我要你
I want you.

576
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:28,900
擁抱我
Put your hands on me.

577
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,710
- 你做什麼？　- 對不起，看看而已
-What you doing?　-I'm sorry. Just peeking.

578
01:13:58,710 --> 01:13:59,830
我看來如何？
How do I look?

579
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:01,440
你看來好點了
You look better.

580
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:05,920
- 只是好點？　- 你看來很漂亮
-Just better?　-Well......you look beautiful.

581
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,210
謝謝
Thanks.

582
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,720
你多大了？
How oId are you?

583
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,480
二十五
Twenty-five.

584
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:26,900
-你有什麼問題?　- 瑪士撒拉綜合癥
-What's your problem?　-Methuselah syndrome.

585
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,610
那是什麼?
What's that?

586
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:31,110
我的腺體，變老得太快
My glands, they grow old too fast.

587
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,740
這是你還留在地球的原因？
Is that why you're still on Earth?

588
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,240
對，我沒法通過體檢
Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

589
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,910
反正，我有點喜歡待在這裏
Anyway......I kind of like it here.

590
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:49,160
我喜歡你，就你這個樣子
I like you......just the way you are.

591
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,550
嗨，羅伊
Hi, Roy.

592
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,690
老天，你這兒的玩具真不錯
Hi. Gosh, you......really got some nice toys here.

593
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:03,110
這就是我對你說過的朋友
This is the friend I was telling you about.

594
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,740
這是我的救星，J.F.賽巴斯汀
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

595
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,340
賽巴斯汀
Sebastian.

596
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,400
我喜歡留在原地的人
I like a man that stays put.

597
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,110
你完全一個人住在這裏，是嗎？
You live here all by yourself, do you?

598
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,240
是的
Yes.

599
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,790
來點早餐怎麼樣？
How about some breakfast?

600
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:34,130
我正要去做，失陪
I was just gonna make some. Excuse me.

601
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:42,890
怎樣？
Well?

602
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:48,140
- 里昂...　- 怎麼了?
-Leon...    -What's going on?

603
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:50,270
我...
I...

604
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,440
現在只有我們倆了
There's only two of us now.

605
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,660
我們太笨了，我們會死的
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

606
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:05,950
不，我們不會
No, we won't.

607
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:43,030
不，騎士吃掉皇后，看？
No. Knight takes queen, see?

608
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,160
我不會這樣下
Won't do.

609
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:56,340
你為何盯著我們看，賽巴斯汀？
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

610
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:59,260
因為...你們這麼不一樣
Because......you're so different.

611
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,510
你們是這麼的完美
You're so perfect.

612
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:07,350
是的
Yes.

613
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,430
你是哪一代的？
What generation are you?

614
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:20,560
Nexus 6型
Nexus 6.

615
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,230
啊，我就知道!
Ah, I knew it.

616
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:25,990
因為我為泰瑞爾公司做基因設計工作
Because I do genetic design work for the Tyrell Corporation.

617
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:28,120
你們有我的一部份
There's some of me in you.

618
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,250
給我展示一下
Show me something.

619
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:32,920
比如什麼？
Like what?

620
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,420
什麼都行
Like anything.

621
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:40,270
我們不是電腦，賽巴斯汀，我們有形有質
We're no computers, Sebastian. We're physical.

622
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,390
我思考，賽巴斯汀……故我在
I think, Sebastian......therefore, I am.

623
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,230
非常好，普莉絲，現在給他看看為什麼
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

624
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,620
我們有許多共通點
We've got a lot in common.

625
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,960
你是什麼意思？
What do you mean?

626
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:23,440
相似的問題
Similar problems.

627
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:25,340
加速衰老
Accelerated decrepitude.

628
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:31,600
我對生化機械所知不多，羅伊，我希望我知道
I don't know much about bio-mechanics, Roy. I wish I did.

629
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:34,980
要是我們不盡快找人幫忙
If we don't find help soon...

630
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,040
普莉絲就活不久了
...Pris hasn't got long to live.

631
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,320
我們不能容許這樣
We can't allow that.

632
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:44,990
- 他厲害嗎？　- 誰？
-Is he good?　-Who?

633
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:48,280
- 你的對手　- 哦...泰瑞爾博士？
-Your opponent.　-Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

634
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,200
我下棋只擊敗過他一次，他是個天才
I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a genius.

635
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,920
他設計了你們
He designed you.

636
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,340
也許他能幫忙
Maybe he could help.

637
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,300
我很樂意向他提出
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

638
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:08,640
最好是我能親自和他談
Better if I talk to him in person.

639
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:16,640
不過我瞭解到，他是那類不易見到的人
But I understand he's a sort of hard man to get to.

640
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,690
是的，很難
Yes. Very.

641
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,320
你會幫我們嗎？
Will you help us?

642
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:28,990
我不能
I can't.

643
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,980
我們需要你，賽巴斯汀
We need you, Sebastian.

644
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,140
你是我們最好的也是唯一的朋友
You're our best and only friend.

645
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:49,380
我們很高興你找到我們
We're so happy you found us.

646
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:56,180
我認為世上沒有別的人類會幫助我們
I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who would've helped us.

在這個鐘點？
At this hour?

652
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,260
我能為你做什麼，賽巴斯汀？
What can I do for you, Sebastian?

653
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:13,530
皇后進主教六，將軍
Queen to bishop six. Check.

654
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,430
胡說
Nonsense.

655
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,100
等一下
Just a moment.

656
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:30,150
皇后進主教六？ 荒謬
Queen to bishop six, ridiculous.

657
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:37,950
皇后
Queen...

658
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,580
主教六
...bishop six.

659
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,630
騎士
Knight...

660
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,260
吃掉皇后
... takes queen.

661
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:00,580
你打什麼主意，賽巴斯汀？
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

662
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,980
你在想什麼？
What are you thinking about?

663
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:08,230
主教移到國王七，將死
Bishop to king seven. Checkmate.

664
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:12,280
主教移到國王七，將死，我認為
Bishop to king seven. Checkmate, I think.

665
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,910
頭腦風暴了，賽巴斯汀？
Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?

666
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:19,120
牛奶和餅乾讓你睡不著?
Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?

667
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:21,370
我們來討論一下
Let's discuss this.

668
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,910
你還是上來吧，賽巴斯汀
You better come up, Sebastian.

669
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,060
泰瑞爾先生？
Mr. Tyrell?

670
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:46,440
我...
I... .

671
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:48,980
我帶了個朋友
I brought a friend.

672
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,410
我很驚訝你沒有早點來
I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.

673
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,880
要見你的製造者並不容易
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.

674
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,170
他能為你做什麼呢？
And what can he do for you?

675
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:16,050
製造者能修補他的造物嗎？
Can the maker repair what he makes?

676
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:20,100
你想要...被修改嗎？
Would you like to be modified?

677
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,010
留在這裏
Stay here.

678
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:30,770
我想的是更根本一些的事
Had in mind something a little more radical.

679
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,070
什麼...
What...?

680
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:35,550
看起來是什麼問題？
What seems to be the problem?

681
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:37,900
死亡
Death.

682
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,400
死亡
Death.

683
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:43,610
恐怕這有點超出我的管轄範圍，你...
Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my jurisdiction. You--

684
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,500
我想要更多的生命...
I want more life...

685
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:47,660
父親

686
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,170
生命的實情
The facts of life.

687
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:58,600
要做出改變，在...
To make an alteration in the...

688
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,770
...有機生物系統進化上，是毀滅性的
...evolvement of an organic life system is fatal.

689
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,860
編碼序列一旦建立就不能修改
A coding sequence cannot be revised once it's been established.

690
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:06,730
為什麼不行?
Why not?

691
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:08,980
因為，在孕育的第二天
Because by the second day of incubation...

692
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,980
任何經歷逆轉突變的細胞...
...any cells that have undergone reversion mutations...

693
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:16,150
會導致回復體株遷移
...give rise to revertant colonies

694
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,690
就像老鼠離開下沉中的船
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

695
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:19,840
然後船...會沉沒
Then the ship sinks.

696
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,370
EMS甲基磺酸乙酯重組呢?
What about EMS recombination?

697
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:25,410
我們已經試過了
We've already tried it.

698
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:28,710
甲基磺酸乙酯是烷化劑
Ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent...

699
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,060
也是有效的誘變劑，它創造出一種...
and a potent mutagen. It created a

700
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,160
非常致命的病毒
virus so lethal the...

701
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,460
對像在離開實驗台前就死了
...subject was dead before he left the table.

702
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,840
那麼某種阻遏蛋白呢，能阻擋運作細胞
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.

703
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:44,050
不會阻礙複製，但它確實會導致一個複製錯誤
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication.

704
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:48,680
因此...新形成的DNA串帶有一個變異
So that...the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation...

705
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:50,980
你會再次得到病毒
...and you've got a virus again.

706
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:54,700
但這，所有這些，只是...
But this, all of this, is...

707
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,780
學術上的
...academic.

708
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,860
你是我們盡可能做到最好的
You were made as well as we could make you.

709
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:02,530
但不能持久
But not to last.

710
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,830
兩倍明亮一半持久的光芒
The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.

711
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,160
而你已燃燒得非常非常明亮，羅伊
And you have burned so very, very brightly, Roy.

712
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:12,640
看看你
Look at you.

713
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:15,040
你是天之驕子
You're the prodigal son.

714
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,760
你是個了不得的獎勵
You're quite a prize.

715
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,660
我做過...可議之事
I've done......questionable things.

716
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,890
同樣也是非凡之事
Also extraordinary things.

717
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,230
縱情於你的時間吧
Revel in your time.

718
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:41,780
天堂裏沒什麼是生物機械之神不讓你做的
Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

719
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:37,420
抱歉，賽巴斯汀
Sorry, Sebastian.

720
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,760
來吧，來吧
Come. Come.

721
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:31,890
經辨識，和泰瑞爾一起的屍體是25歲的白種男性
Body identified with Tyrell is a 25-year-old male Caucasian.

722
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,680
姓名：賽巴斯汀，J.F.賽巴斯汀
Name: Sebastian, J.F. Sebastian.

723
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:39,980
地址：布拉德伯利公寓大廈，第九區，N.F. 46751.
Address: Bradbury Apartments, Ninth Sector, NF4675 1.

724
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,190
我要你過去那裏...
I want you to go down there and--

725
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:49,070
本區地面交通封閉，你在這裏做什麼？
This sector's closed to ground traffic. What're you doing here?

726
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,070
我在工作，你在做什麼？
I'm working. What are you doing?

727
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:52,940
逮捕你，我正在做這事
Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.

728
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:55,970
我是戴卡德，銀翼殺手，26354
I'm Deckard, Blade Runner. 26354.

729
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,330
我已備案並接受監督
I'm filed and monitored.

730
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:59,420
等等，正在查
Hold on. Checking.

731
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:06,260
好，確認無誤，祝好運
Okay. Checked and cleared. Have a better one.

732
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,230
- 喂？　- 嗨！J.F.在嗎？
-Hello.　-Hi. Is J.F. there?

733
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:22,230
- 你是哪位？　- 艾迪，J.F.的老朋友
-Who is it?　-This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.

734
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:28,950
這不是待友之道
That's no way to treat a friend.

735
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,060
（布拉德伯利）

736
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:29,440
又回家了又回家了.....
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

737
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,420
晚安，J.F.
Good evening, J.F.

738
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,280
茶？
Tea?

739
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,610
加茶嗎？
More tea?

740
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,730
茶？
Tea?

741
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:02,450
加茶嗎？
More tea?

742
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,170
茶？
Tea?

743
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:09,630
加茶嗎？
More tea?

744
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:13,220
加茶嗎？
More tea?

745
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,480
加茶嗎？
More tea?

746
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,270
向手無寸鐵的對手開槍可不太公平
Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent.

747
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,300
我以為你應該是好的
I thought you were supposed to be good.

748
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:45,520
你不是好人嗎？
Aren't you the good man?

749
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:53,410
來吧，戴卡德
Come on, Deckard.

750
01:35:55,410 --> 01:35:56,910
讓我看看
Show me...

751
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,790
你是什麼做的
...what you're made of.

752
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,550
為自己驕傲嗎，小個子？
Proud of yourself, little man?

753
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,650
這是為了佐拉!
This is for Zhora.

754
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,150
這是為普莉絲
This is for Pris.

755
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:35,620
來吧，戴卡德
Come on, Deckard.

756
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:38,620
我就在這裏　但你得射直一點
I'm right here, but you've gotta shoot straight.

757
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:42,230
射直似乎還不夠好！
Straight doesn't seem to be good enough!

758
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:44,430
現在輪到我了
Now it's my turn.

759
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:49,420
我來之前會給你幾秒鐘時間
I'm gonna give you a few seconds before I come.

760
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:52,840
一...二...
One. Two.

761
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,230
三
Three.

762
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:09,530
四
Four.

763
01:37:22,290 --> 01:37:23,370
普莉絲
Pris.

764
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:37,950
我來了!
I'm coming.

765
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,320
戴卡德!
Deckard!

766
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:44,890
四...五...
Four, five

767
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,170
怎樣活下來？
How to stay alive?

768
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:15,390
我能看見你
I can see you!

769
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,450
還不要!
Not yet!

770
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:45,390
不...
Not... .

771
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,680
對了
Yes.

772
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,390
你最好振作一點
You better get it up.

773
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:41,930
不然我要殺了你
Or I'm gonna have to kill you.

774
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:46,150
除非你活著，你就沒法玩了，如果你不玩...
Unless you're alive, you can't play.  And if you don't play... .

775
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,950
六，七!
Six, seven

776
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:00,870
下地獄或上天堂
Go to hell or go to heaven

777
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:10,130
很好! 就是這種精神!
Good, that's the spirit!

778
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:52,420
好痛
That hurt.

779
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,510
你那樣不理性
That was irrational of you.

780
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:04,100
更不用說...沒有運動精神
Not to mention......unsportsmanlike.

781
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:10,650
你要去哪？
Where are you going?

782
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:18,440
活在恐懼中的體驗還不錯，對吧？
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

783
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:23,190
這就是做奴隸的體會
That's what it is to be a slave.

784
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:29,160
我曾...見過你們人類不會相信之事
I've......seen things you people wouldn't believe.

785
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:35,760
戰艦在獵戶星座的肩旁燃燒
Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.

786
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:40,450
我觀看過C射線...
I watched C-beams...

787
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,310
...在唐懷瑟之門的黑暗裏閃耀
...glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate.

788
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:53,360
...所有那些...瞬間都將消逝...
All those......moments will be lost...

789
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:55,980
...在時光裏...
...in time...

790
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:01,490
...如同...眼淚
...like......tears...

791
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:05,580
...消失在雨中
...in rain.

792
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:12,180
是時候...死了
Time to die.

793
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,950
你完成了人的工作，先生
You've done a man's job, sir.

794
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:28,530
我猜你不幹了，嗯？
I guess you're through, huh?

795
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,100
完成了
Finished.

796
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:56,700
真糟糕她不能活下去
It's too bad she won't live.

797
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,560
可話說回來，誰能呢？
But then again, who does?

798
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:35,930
瑞秋？
Rachael?

799
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:45,350
瑞秋？
Rachael?

800
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:01,000
瑞秋？
Rachael?

801
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:09,860
你愛我嗎？
Do you love me?

802
01:51:10,980 --> 01:51:12,400
我愛你
I love you.

803
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,110
你信任我嗎？
Do you trust me?

804
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,280
我信任你
I trust you.

805
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:29,250
瑞秋？
Rachael?

806
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:11,630
真糟糕她不能活下去
It's too bad she won 't live.

807
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:14,550
可話說回來，誰能呢？
But then again, who does?

808
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:53,550
