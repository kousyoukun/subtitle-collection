1
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,168
Manuel.

2
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,295
Manuel!

3
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,227
Manuel.

4
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,527
l think. . . .

5
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,910
l think l found you one.

6
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,496
Look, l called you, right?

7
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,880
Soon as l couldn't pull it out myself,
l called you, John.

8
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:32,893
lt's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

9
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,947
lt's okay.

10
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,832
This is Constantine.

11
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:36,130
John Constantine, asshole.

12
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,635
Sure.

13
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,827
What the hell?

14
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:28,807
l need a mirror.

15
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,100
Now. At least 3 feet high.

16
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:34,944
Move! Go, now!

17
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,832
This is Kramer.

18
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,373
Chas Kramer, asshole.

19
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,255
Asshole.

20
00:06:56,424 --> 00:07:01,631
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

21
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,927
-Chas!
-What?

22
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,850
-Move the car.
-Why?

23
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,808
Move the damn car!

24
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,232
''Chas, move the car. ''

25
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:17,772
There, car's moved.

26
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,907
Lift it up over the bed.

27
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:36,999
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

28
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:43,680
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

29
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,726
No!

30
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:06,113
Show yourself.

31
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,246
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

32
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,125
For your boss.

33
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,220
Pull it!

34
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,615
Ma? Ma?

35
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:33,991
Like l said, l found you something,
didn't l, John? Didn't l?

36
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,831
What happened in there?

37
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,506
Going to a lot of meetings, l see.

38
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:47,799
Keeps the voices out so l can sleep.

39
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,428
l have to sleep, John.

40
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,638
l need some help, Father.

41
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,937
You do?

42
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,855
From me?

43
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,731
What kind of--?

44
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:07,149
-Hey, listen, l--
-That exorcism wasn't right.

45
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,986
Listen to the ether.

46
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,578
Anything unusual, you let me know.

47
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:22,119
Come on, you don't need its protection.
lt'll be like back in the day.

48
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,501
A few days.

49
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,005
Okay.

50
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:32,594
Okay. For you, John.

51
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,553
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

52
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,310
-l told you to move it.
-You did tell me to move it. . .

53
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:45,983
. . .but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon. . .

54
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:47,981
. . .l would've moved it further, John.

55
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:51,816
-Take Alvarado.
-Yeah, thank you. l know what to take.

56
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:56,861
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe l could help out?

57
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,368
-No?
-Nope.

58
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,869
Nope?

59
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,119
Of course it's a nope.

60
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,790
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.

61
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,045
It's been...

62
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:50,257
... two weeks since my last confession.

63
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,801
l killed a man today.

64
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,593
Another one.

65
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:08,017
l didn't even see his face, l just. . .

66
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,436
. . .pulled the trigger, and he went away.

67
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:18,826
Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.

68
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:24,079
Why do I always know
where these guys are?

69
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:27,585
Where to aim, when to fire.

70
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,169
I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?

71
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:35,004
Something damned?

72
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:40,518
God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.

73
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:45,099
You mustn 't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.

74
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:47,312
Yeah, I'm trying.

75
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:50,558
I'm trying real hard.

76
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:53,483
Isabel.

77
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:46,705
Isabel.

78
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:45,633
Things l've beaten.

79
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,518
Things most people never even heard of.

80
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:53,100
And now l'm gonna be done in by this.

81
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,560
Wouldn't be the first, John.

82
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,487
Come on, Les.

83
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,983
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

84
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:06,031
This is aggressive.

85
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:10,286
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

86
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:13,457
Now you don't wanna leave.

87
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,288
Yeah, that's a good idea.

88
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,253
John, you really need to prepare.

89
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:28,806
-Make arrangements.
-No need.

90
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,140
l already know exactly where l'm going.

91
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,109
-Morning.
-Good morning.

92
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,235
-Good morning.
-Detective.

93
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,234
-No, no, no.
-Angela, wait.

94
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,079
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

95
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:48,747
Give us the room, please.

96
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,022
lsabel.

97
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:31,035
She fell from the roof?

98
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,034
She jumped.

99
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,795
-No.
-Look. . .

100
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:41,126
. . .l know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

101
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:53,177
-lsabel wouldn't kill herself.
-Angie.

102
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,889
-She wouldn't kill herself.
-Detective.

103
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,394
-Period.
-Detective.

104
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,191
Period!

105
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,936
Angie, there were security cameras.

106
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,749
-Hold the door. You going down?
-Not if l can help it.

107
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,048
A new case?

108
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:14,976
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

109
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,182
-Humor me.
-Don't l always?

110
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,771
Oh, yeah, that's--
Much obliged. Thank you.

111
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,485
How you feeling, John?

112
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,321
So, what's new?

113
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:40,373
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope. . .

114
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:44,163
. . .holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan. . .

115
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,251
. . .and-- Oh, you'll love this.
--screech beetle from Amityville.

116
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,512
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the
fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

117
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:58,805
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

118
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:01,889
l just like them.

119
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,940
Yeah. Who doesn't?

120
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,152
Yeah, easy there, hero.

121
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:11,905
-That's dragon's breath.
-l thought you couldn't get it anymore.

122
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:16,869
Yeah, well, l know a guy
who knows a guy.

123
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:26,628
So, what's the action?

124
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:30,875
l just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

125
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,139
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

126
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,178
Yeah, l know how it sounds.

127
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:39,640
No, we're finger puppets
to them, John. . .

128
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,188
. . .not doorways.

129
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:45,436
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

130
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,231
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

131
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,313
Sure thing, John.

132
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,067
Anything else?

133
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,279
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a--?

134
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,284
On the house.

135
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,825
All right, question. How much longer
do l have to be your slave, John?

136
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:07,920
You're not my slave, Chas.

137
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,794
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

138
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,128
Like Tonto or Robin.

139
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:17,005
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

140
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:21,050
Right. So then why don't l apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

141
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,648
John? John.

142
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:29,570
l love our little talks, John.

143
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,994
May l take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

144
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,957
No, thanks,
l'm not gonna be staying long.

145
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:52,709
-How about you, ma'am?
-Oh, no, l'm not staying long either.

146
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:55,383
l really need to speak with him.
lt's important.

147
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,260
First come, first served.

148
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:04,514
So you're rude no matter where you are.

149
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,113
-Father.
-Hi.

150
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,409
-You have news. Yes.
-Yes, l spoke with the bishop.

151
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,081
l know what you want, son.

152
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:31,789
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

153
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:35,377
l'm flattered.

154
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,802
Well, l could offer something. . .

155
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:43,220
. . .about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock. . .

156
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,470
. . .but it might sound disingenuous.

157
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:48,398
She has to have a Catholic funeral,
Father. She has to.

158
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:52,778
-Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
-She didn't commit suicide.

159
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,567
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

160
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,816
Oh, rules.

161
00:21:57,992 --> 00:21:59,819
Father.

162
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:01,573
David.

163
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:05,157
This is lsabel.

164
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,081
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

165
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:11,706
Please.

166
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,292
l'm sorry.

167
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:20,629
l've been seeing some unusual
soul traffic lately.

168
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,558
You might consider
giving me an extension.

169
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:26,300
l could do your side some good
these days.

170
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,721
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

171
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:32,644
What about the minions l've sent back?

172
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:36,982
-That alone should guarantee my entry.
-How many times have l told you?

173
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,149
That's not the way this works.

174
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,030
Why, haven't l served him enough?

175
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:45,955
-What does he want from me?
-Only the usual.

176
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:49,208
Self-sacrifice, belief.

177
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:52,580
-Oh, l believe, for chrissake.
-No, no, you know.

178
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,997
And there's a difference. You've seen.

179
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:59,836
l never asked to see.
l was born with this curse.

180
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,089
A gift, John.

181
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:04,756
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

182
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:08,469
l'm pulling demons out of little girls.

183
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,473
Who's that for?

184
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:15,183
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

185
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,603
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

186
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,402
lmpossible rules, endless regulations. . .

187
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:24,703
. . .who goes up, who goes down
and why.

188
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,793
You don't even understand us.

189
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:35,083
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

190
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,809
Why me, Gabriel?

191
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,638
lt's personal, isn't it?

192
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:59,530
l didn't go to church enough,
l didn't pray enough. . .

193
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:04,158
. . .l was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

194
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:08,914
You are going to die young. . .

195
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:12,996
. . .because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 1 5.

196
00:24:13,544 --> 00:24:16,035
And you're going to go to hell. . .

197
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:19,257
. . .because of the life you took.

198
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:26,132
You're fucked.

199
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:40,191
At least it's nice out.

200
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:46,068
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

201
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,291
And his punch lines are killers.

202
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,962
John!

203
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:07,295
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

204
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:23,484
Twenty-two women were found buried
in the assailant's back yard.

205
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:27,357
So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match....

206
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:29,991
Police report she had been
physically penetrated...

207
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,914
...over 1 00 times and buried alive.

208
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:36,831
--found locked in a storage freezer,
his head severed and his organs....

209
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,794
He stuffed Holly's body into....

210
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:42,961
-The bodies ravished by the unknown....
-He used a small handsaw....

211
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:46,585
Had nearly decapitated....
Even his eyes were gouged out.

212
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,423
Isabel.

213
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:14,495
l'm so sorry, lzzy.

214
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,743
Constantine.

215
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:52,742
Dodson.

216
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:54,697
Hello?

217
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:57,158
Hello.

218
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,415
Hello?

219
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:09,862
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

220
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,018
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

221
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,210
l know where you're going, John.
You're going to Midnite's.

222
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:13,044
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

223
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:17,003
lt's a haven for those who rise and fall.
l remember reading about this, John.

224
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:19,933
-You read too much, kid. lt's a bar.
-lt's a bar?

225
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:24,478
lt's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for
good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

226
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:27,269
-John, the man's a legend.
-Yeah.

227
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:29,933
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

228
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,653
l'm begging you, John, please?

229
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,986
-Sure, you can get in.
-l can get in?

230
00:29:35,158 --> 00:29:37,364
lf you can get in.

231
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,825
lf l can get--? lt's a bear, though, right?
Or two ducks in a cloud?

232
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,578
Two frogs on a bench.

233
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,883
Two frogs on a bench.

234
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:56,044
No, no, l'm with the guy you just--

235
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,094
John! John!

236
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:00,257
l'm with him, though.

237
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:03,349
Rat in a dress.

238
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,892
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

239
00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:09,022
l'm just testing. l'm just testing.

240
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,156
Don't get up.

241
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,828
You've been absent some time.

242
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,997
Have you come here with relics to sell?

243
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,583
No, l'm out of that now.
l've been too busy.

244
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:19,634
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

245
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:21,761
Midnite, Jesus. . .

246
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,347
. . .l thought the thing was authentic.

247
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,973
l see now.

248
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:33,481
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

249
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:35,443
A few months, maybe a year.

250
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:38,281
l thought l heard thunder last night.

251
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:41,567
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

252
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,871
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

253
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,364
So l've heard.

254
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,836
Well, l am most certain
you did not come here. . .

255
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:55,170
. . .for a sympathetic shoulder
to cry on.

256
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:01,252
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

257
00:32:01,554 --> 00:32:03,677
They don't like you, John.

258
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:05,722
How many have you
deported back to hell?

259
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:10,435
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

260
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:13,357
Clearly l do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

261
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:15,850
And yesterday l saw a soldier demon. . .

262
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:18,518
. . .trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

263
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:23,442
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven. . .

264
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:26,156
. . .the great detente
of the original superpowers.

265
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:31,246
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

266
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,995
Now. . .

267
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:36,630
. . .l need to use the chair.

268
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,421
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you. . .

269
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:46,305
. . .you know l am neutral.

270
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:50,721
And as long as the balance
is maintained, l take no sides.

271
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:54,514
Before you were a bartender. . .

272
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:59,057
. . .you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

273
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:02,947
-And l--
-You were Constantine.

274
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:06,487
The John Constantine.

275
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:08,946
Once.

276
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,705
This isn't the usual game, l can feel it.

277
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,284
Something's coming.

278
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,087
Spooky.

279
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,090
Balthazar.

280
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:25,339
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

281
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:27,466
l'll make your night.

282
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,341
l'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

283
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:37,848
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

284
00:33:38,026 --> 00:33:39,983
Johnny boy.

285
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:46,658
Word is you're on your way down.

286
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:49,032
Fresh meat.

287
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:54,657
Finger-licking good.

288
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,828
We have a meeting now, John.

289
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:07,128
What? l didn't catch that.

290
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,929
Welcome to my life.

291
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:03,813
Mr. Constantine.

292
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:08,355
-l saw you--
-l remember.

293
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,992
-And then l saw you at the--
-Regular kismet.

294
00:35:13,204 --> 00:35:16,703
l'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

295
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,959
l'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

296
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:22,786
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

297
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:25,083
Please?

298
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:30,886
Always a catch.

299
00:35:45,737 --> 00:35:48,441
My sister was murdered yesterday.

300
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:51,568
-Sorry to hear.
-Thanks.

301
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:56,827
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

302
00:35:57,498 --> 00:35:59,456
Thought you said she was murdered.

303
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,626
Yeah, well, lsabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

304
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:06,460
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

305
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,542
That's just crazy.

306
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:17,422
Look, l've heard your name
around the precinct.

307
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:22,809
l know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

308
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:26,600
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

309
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:31,487
She started talking about demons,
angels.

310
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:34,409
Now, l think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

311
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:38,361
l think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

312
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:43,000
Some kind of legion or cult.

313
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:46,129
Sounds like a theory, detective.

314
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:47,708
Good luck.

315
00:36:50,051 --> 00:36:52,589
l thought with your background,
you could at least. . .

316
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,422
. . .point me in the right direction.

317
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:56,922
Yeah, okay, sure.

318
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:02,262
lt wasn't a suicide.

319
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:04,597
My sister was a devout Catholic.

320
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:07,265
Do you understand that?
lf she took her own life--

321
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:10,230
Her soul would go straight to hell. . .

322
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:15,530
. . .where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony. . .

323
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:18,952
. . .for all eternity. That it?

324
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:21,161
That about right?

325
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:30,254
Goddamn you.

326
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,074
Detective.

327
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:05,083
What if l told you that God
and the devil made a wager. . .

328
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:08,750
. . .a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

329
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:11,412
l'd tell you to stay on your meds.

330
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:15,885
Humor me. No direct contact with
humans. That would be the rule.

331
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,432
-Just influence. See who would win.
-Okay, l'm humoring you.

332
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,676
-Why?
-Who knows.

333
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:25,936
-Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
-Oh, so it's fun.

334
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:31,100
lt's fun when a man beats his wife to
death, when a mother drowns her baby.

335
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:35,026
And you think the devil is responsible?

336
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:37,949
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

337
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:41,569
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

338
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:45,494
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

339
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:49,118
Well, this has been real educational. . .

340
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:51,003
. . .but l don't believe in the devil.

341
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:54,623
You should. He believes in you.

342
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:16,985
lt's a power outage.

343
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:19,114
Not likely.

344
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:25,160
-What?
-We should go. Now.

345
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:32,287
What is that?

346
00:39:33,381 --> 00:39:35,124
Wings.

347
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:38,047
Maybe talons.

348
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:41,091
You're kidding. Of what?

349
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:45,099
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

350
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:51,643
That's really not going to help.

351
00:39:56,237 --> 00:39:58,906
-Close your eyes.
-Why?

352
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:00,402
Suit yourself.

353
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:26,055
Demons stay in hell, huh?

354
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:29,469
Tell them that.

355
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:36,482
Don't worry. Happens to everyone
the first time.

356
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:38,775
lt's the sulfur.

357
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:41,356
Sulfur.

358
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:45,984
What were those things?

359
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:49,038
Demons.

360
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,246
-Scavengers of the damned.
-No, no. lt's impossible.

361
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:59,205
Yeah. And l don't think
they were after me.

362
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:04,380
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

363
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:05,966
lsabel?

364
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,842
Never in a million years.

365
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:11,303
Well, let's be sure.

366
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:14,012
Let's see if she's in hell.

367
00:41:38,423 --> 00:41:40,664
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

368
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:43,292
ln front of the chair.

369
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,007
l can't believe l'm doing this.

370
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:50,804
-These are all lsabel's things?
-Yeah.

371
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,846
-How about the cat?
-Duck?

372
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,640
Yeah, why?

373
00:41:57,692 --> 00:41:59,020
Duck.

374
00:41:59,193 --> 00:42:01,519
Oh, you think that's strange.

375
00:42:01,696 --> 00:42:03,155
Cats are good.

376
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:04,947
Half in, half out anyway.

377
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:26,462
lf this is some kind of spell
or something. . .

378
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:29,804
. . .don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

379
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:32,299
Why, do you have any?

380
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:35,556
-This is crazy.
-Yes.

381
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:41,439
l need you to leave.

382
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:45,113
-l'm sorry?
-Angela, please.

383
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,403
The apartment.

384
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:55,241
Okay.

385
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:04,127
Be careful with that cat.

386
00:43:08,262 --> 00:43:10,967
God, l hate this part.

387
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:16,592
-lsabel.
-Constantine.

388
00:46:02,145 --> 00:46:03,555
Angela.

389
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:08,567
Jesus.

390
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,524
-Constantine, what--?
-Twins.

391
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:16,608
Jesus. What?

392
00:46:17,535 --> 00:46:20,026
-You were twins.
-What did you say?

393
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:22,874
-She killed herself.
-What?

394
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,621
And she's damned for it.

395
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,342
How is this possible?

396
00:46:43,895 --> 00:46:45,722
l need to eat.

397
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:35,954
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

398
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:40,878
Relax, man.

399
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,297
Slow down!

400
00:49:06,537 --> 00:49:09,455
What the hell kind of place is this?

401
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:01,841
John.

402
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:36,157
When l was a kid, l could see things.

403
00:50:36,669 --> 00:50:38,709
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

404
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:43,168
Things you shouldn 't have to see.

405
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:05,071
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

406
00:51:05,281 --> 00:51:07,737
They made it worse.

407
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:12,990
You think you're crazy long enough. . .

408
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:14,784
. . .you find a way out.

409
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:19,040
-You tried to kill yourself.
-I didn 't try anything.

410
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,925
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

411
00:51:26,803 --> 00:51:29,210
But when you cross over. . .

412
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,715
. . .time stops.

413
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:37,014
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

414
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,229
When l came back. . .

415
00:51:43,152 --> 00:51:44,944
. . .l knew. . .

416
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,031
. . .all the things l could see were real.

417
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:54,492
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

418
00:51:54,664 --> 00:51:59,658
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

419
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:03,370
Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

420
00:52:03,548 --> 00:52:06,465
So instead we get
what l call half-breeds.

421
00:52:07,593 --> 00:52:09,835
The influence peddlers.

422
00:52:10,013 --> 00:52:15,469
They can only whisper in our ears, but
a single word can give you courage...

423
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:19,688
...or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.

424
00:52:19,856 --> 00:52:22,892
Those with the demon 's touch...

425
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:28,109
...like those part angel,
living alongside us.

426
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,772
They call it the balance.

427
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,320
l call it hypocritical bullshit.

428
00:52:35,872 --> 00:52:38,445
So when a half-breed breaks the rules. . .

429
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:42,908
. . .l deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

430
00:52:43,546 --> 00:52:46,167
l don't get them all. . .

431
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:50,627
. . .but l've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my. . .

432
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:54,638
-. . .retirement.
-l don't understand.

433
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:58,807
l'm a suicide, Angela.

434
00:52:58,978 --> 00:53:02,513
When l die, the rules say
l've got just one place to go.

435
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,730
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

436
00:53:04,901 --> 00:53:07,439
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison. . .

437
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:09,937
. . .where half the inmates
were put there by you?

438
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:14,863
l guess God has a plan for all of us.

439
00:53:15,286 --> 00:53:18,406
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

440
00:53:18,581 --> 00:53:20,621
He's not planning anything.

441
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,993
When we were little. . .

442
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:26,577
. . .lsabel saw things too.

443
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:33,422
Dodson.

444
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:39,515
Guard spotted him groping the body,
then he ran across the street.

445
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:42,770
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

446
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:46,189
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

447
00:53:46,776 --> 00:53:49,397
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

448
00:53:51,864 --> 00:53:53,822
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

449
00:53:54,117 --> 00:53:55,611
He's okay.

450
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:08,704
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

451
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:45,082
Yes?

452
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,870
What do you mean?

453
00:54:48,796 --> 00:54:50,291
What?

454
00:54:50,465 --> 00:54:52,007
How?

455
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,639
Got it. Bye.

456
00:55:13,154 --> 00:55:16,155
l need to see where lsabel died.

457
00:55:16,324 --> 00:55:19,491
Seances, Ouija boards, channeling.

458
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:23,702
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

459
00:55:23,956 --> 00:55:26,412
She certainly did that.

460
00:55:26,626 --> 00:55:30,125
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

461
00:55:30,296 --> 00:55:33,997
She'd scare my mother half to death.

462
00:55:35,802 --> 00:55:38,471
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

463
00:55:38,638 --> 00:55:40,880
So you had her committed.

464
00:55:41,057 --> 00:55:42,385
Yeah.

465
00:55:42,558 --> 00:55:44,218
How long?

466
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:46,310
Two weeks.

467
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:48,556
This time.

468
00:55:48,731 --> 00:55:53,310
She'd get better, and then she'd
get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

469
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:58,939
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand. . .

470
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:01,405
. . .does it have something to do
with this?

471
00:56:01,744 --> 00:56:03,986
l'm a cop, John, remember?

472
00:56:04,163 --> 00:56:09,121
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

473
00:56:09,293 --> 00:56:14,169
And l showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

474
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,679
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

475
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,007
Something just for you.

476
00:56:24,517 --> 00:56:28,729
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

477
00:56:28,896 --> 00:56:32,230
-l'm not like my sister.
-But you were once.

478
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,606
When you were kids.

479
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:37,696
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

480
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:41,612
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

481
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:43,243
That was a long time ago.

482
00:56:43,411 --> 00:56:45,368
That kind of bond doesn't
just disappear.

483
00:56:45,538 --> 00:56:47,614
There is nothing here.

484
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:51,374
-Hey. Come on.
-She planned her death in this room.

485
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:54,960
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

486
00:56:55,131 --> 00:56:58,381
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw. . .

487
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:01,587
. . .feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

488
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:04,593
-What did she do, Angela?
-How should l know?

489
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:07,173
-What did she do, Angela?
-l don't know.

490
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:11,681
-What would you do?
-l don't know.

491
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:16,601
What did she do, Angela? You know
what she did. What did she do, Angela?

492
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:20,063
You know what she did. What are
you afraid of? What did she do?

493
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:22,565
-What did she do?
-l don't know!

494
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:42,466
When we were girls. . .

495
00:57:45,431 --> 00:57:48,266
. . .we would leave each other messages.

496
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:52,811
ln light.

497
00:57:55,441 --> 00:57:57,233
ln breath.

498
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:03,114
On the windows.

499
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:10,694
John, there is no 1 7th act
in Corinthians.

500
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:16,624
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

501
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:19,963
They have Bibles in hell.

502
00:58:20,508 --> 00:58:22,999
Paints a different view of Revelations.

503
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:25,300
Says the world will not end
by God's hand...

504
00:58:25,471 --> 00:58:28,472
...but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.

505
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:30,135
Though if you ask me...

506
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:32,725
. . .fire's fire.

507
00:58:32,895 --> 00:58:37,142
1 6:29, 1 6:30.

508
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,350
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

509
00:58:41,529 --> 00:58:45,396
''The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son. ''

510
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:49,527
-Whose son?
-But he can't cross over, B.

511
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:52,325
-lmpossible to cross over.
-Whose son? God's son?

512
00:58:52,498 --> 00:58:55,950
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

513
00:58:56,252 --> 00:58:57,830
Here it is.

514
00:58:58,004 --> 00:59:00,043
This is the sign of Mammon. . .

515
00:59:00,214 --> 00:59:04,675
. . .the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here--

516
00:59:05,178 --> 00:59:07,336
-Beeman?
-Yeah.

517
00:59:07,513 --> 00:59:10,514
Sorry, l'm--
l'm sorry, no, l'm right here.

518
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:17,271
lt says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule. . .

519
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,359
. . .and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

520
00:59:28,284 --> 00:59:30,692
Yeah. Mammon would be
the last demon. . .

521
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,741
. . .we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

522
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:37,533
No, wait, wait, wait. l'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

523
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:40,035
Always a catch.

524
00:59:40,463 --> 00:59:46,751
lt says first Mammon would have to
possess a very, very powerful psychic.

525
00:59:46,928 --> 00:59:49,549
-lsabel.
-But that wouldn 't be enough.

526
00:59:50,306 --> 00:59:54,767
To cross over, Mammon would need
divine assistance.

527
00:59:56,187 --> 01:00:00,351
To cross over, Mammon would need
the help of God.

528
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:04,318
-The help of God?
-It says--

529
01:00:11,077 --> 01:00:14,576
-Beeman?
-John, look. . .

530
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:19,243
. . .l know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to. . .

531
01:00:19,419 --> 01:00:23,167
...but that doesn 't mean
that we don 't have faith...

532
01:00:24,048 --> 01:00:25,792
. . .in you.

533
01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:31,597
Beeman? Beeman?

534
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,631
Drive. Fast.

535
01:00:50,783 --> 01:00:52,740
Beeman!

536
01:00:53,161 --> 01:00:54,869
Sulfur.

537
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:57,948
Beeman!

538
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:03,836
Beeman!

539
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:16,108
Wasn't just lsabel.

540
01:02:17,412 --> 01:02:18,954
l used to see things too.

541
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,700
But. . .

542
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:26,743
-. . .you already knew that, didn't you?
-Go home, Angela.

543
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:28,380
l need to understand.

544
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:31,039
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

545
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,293
l'm stronger than lsabel.

546
01:02:33,469 --> 01:02:37,419
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours. Denial is a better idea.

547
01:02:37,598 --> 01:02:42,391
lt's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

548
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,519
l don't need another ghost
following me.

549
01:02:44,689 --> 01:02:47,227
John, they killed my sister.

550
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:53,895
l'd trade places with her if l could.

551
01:02:57,118 --> 01:02:59,739
l used to pretend that l didn't.

552
01:03:00,413 --> 01:03:02,821
That l didn't see things.

553
01:03:03,207 --> 01:03:04,785
And. . .

554
01:03:05,918 --> 01:03:10,248
. . .by the time we were 1 0,
they started forcing her to take. . .

555
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,081
. . .antipsychotics. . .

556
01:03:14,093 --> 01:03:16,465
. . .and have treatments.
They would come for her. . .

557
01:03:16,638 --> 01:03:20,386
. . .and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, ''Tell them.

558
01:03:20,558 --> 01:03:24,390
Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?''

559
01:03:25,563 --> 01:03:26,892
But l lied.

560
01:03:27,774 --> 01:03:29,766
l said:

561
01:03:31,277 --> 01:03:33,602
''l don't see anything. ''

562
01:03:34,572 --> 01:03:36,778
Until one day. . .

563
01:03:37,742 --> 01:03:39,366
. . .l finally stopped seeing.

564
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:44,285
l abandoned her, John.

565
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:47,580
l left her all alone.

566
01:03:54,801 --> 01:03:57,126
l need to see what she saw.

567
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:00,679
Please.

568
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:08,762
You do this, there's no turning back.

569
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:12,642
You see them. . .

570
01:04:13,653 --> 01:04:15,480
. . .they see you.

571
01:04:16,364 --> 01:04:18,357
Understand?

572
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,825
Yeah.

573
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,833
Sure.

574
01:05:07,373 --> 01:05:11,869
So do l have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can l leave them on?

575
01:05:18,301 --> 01:05:19,961
John?

576
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:22,212
l'm thinking.

577
01:05:26,225 --> 01:05:27,850
John?

578
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:30,512
On is fine.

579
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:46,700
-So why water?
-lt's a universal conduit.

580
01:05:47,121 --> 01:05:50,905
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

581
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:55,377
-Now ask me if there's water in hell.
-ls there water in hell?

582
01:05:57,173 --> 01:05:58,632
Sit.

583
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:04,256
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended. . .

584
01:06:06,933 --> 01:06:08,890
. . .but you wanted the crash course.

585
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,765
Yeah, l wanted the crash course.

586
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,019
So. . . .

587
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,480
So, what's gonna happen?

588
01:06:16,651 --> 01:06:18,311
Lie down.

589
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:22,437
-What do you mean lie down?
-You have to be fully submerged.

590
01:06:24,534 --> 01:06:25,945
For how long?

591
01:06:26,661 --> 01:06:28,404
As long as it takes.

592
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:40,624
Take a deep one.

593
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:25,192
Oh, God.

594
01:08:25,863 --> 01:08:28,983
Oh, God, all those people.

595
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:32,032
Oh, lsabel.

596
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:33,823
l've always known.

597
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:38,542
l've always known where they are.
l've always known where to find them. . .

598
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:41,829
. . .where to aim and where to duck. . .

599
01:08:42,005 --> 01:08:43,914
. . .and l've always known
where they were.

600
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,129
l've always known that it wasn't luck.

601
01:08:46,301 --> 01:08:48,922
Always known that it wasn't luck.
l've always known. . . .

602
01:08:49,095 --> 01:08:52,262
l've always known that l could see.

603
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:57,770
l've always known that l could see.

604
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:04,394
Angela.

605
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:10,606
Someone was here.

606
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:38,518
lt was his.

607
01:09:39,812 --> 01:09:41,686
Rolling.

608
01:09:43,775 --> 01:09:45,684
Not a ball.

609
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:49,314
Something smaller.

610
01:09:52,116 --> 01:09:53,741
Shiny.

611
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:28,814
Balthazar.

612
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,685
Sorry.

613
01:11:09,902 --> 01:11:12,061
Can you just kill him?

614
01:11:13,031 --> 01:11:14,359
What about the balance?

615
01:11:14,532 --> 01:11:18,197
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

616
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:20,825
l'm just adding some counterweight.

617
01:11:54,656 --> 01:11:56,778
John, l really want--

618
01:12:02,872 --> 01:12:05,956
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

619
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:15,672
l'm coming with you.

620
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:19,467
You're staying in the car.

621
01:12:43,788 --> 01:12:46,742
Fire? l was born of this.

622
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:51,454
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

623
01:12:55,466 --> 01:12:58,918
That's better. Au naturel.

624
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,267
''Stay in the car. ''

625
01:13:08,438 --> 01:13:10,810
''Wait here. ''

626
01:13:11,524 --> 01:13:12,852
Men.

627
01:13:26,581 --> 01:13:27,992
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

628
01:13:29,584 --> 01:13:31,576
Enjoy it.

629
01:14:05,036 --> 01:14:08,820
We'll see you very soon.

630
01:14:09,248 --> 01:14:11,075
Not really, no.

631
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:16,411
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

632
01:14:16,589 --> 01:14:18,083
True.

633
01:14:18,257 --> 01:14:19,586
But you're not.

634
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:24,048
-What are you doing?
-l'm reading you your last rites.

635
01:14:24,222 --> 01:14:27,887
Spare me your remedial incantations.

636
01:14:28,059 --> 01:14:30,384
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

637
01:14:30,561 --> 01:14:33,099
To be welcomed
into the Kingdom of God.

638
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,683
Demon in heaven.

639
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:39,313
l'd love to be a fly on that wall.

640
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,734
You're not a priest. You have no power.

641
01:14:45,118 --> 01:14:47,110
Just tell me how Mammon
is crossing over. . .

642
01:14:47,286 --> 01:14:50,371
. . .and you can go back
to your shithole.

643
01:14:53,126 --> 01:14:56,577
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

644
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:11,682
''May God have mercy on you
and grant you the pardon of all your sins.

645
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:16,683
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in heaven. ''

646
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,433
-How? How's he doing it?
-No.

647
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:22,941
No, l can't.

648
01:15:24,824 --> 01:15:28,158
Grant your child entry
into thy kingdom. . .

649
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:33,786
. . .in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

650
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:36,000
Amen!

651
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:42,125
The blood of God.

652
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,628
He found it.

653
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:48,055
Whatever killed the son of God. . .

654
01:15:48,222 --> 01:15:53,762
. . .will give birth to the son of the devil.

655
01:15:55,897 --> 01:15:57,724
By the way. . .

656
01:15:59,734 --> 01:16:03,648
. . .you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven. . .

657
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:05,811
. . .asshole.

658
01:16:09,744 --> 01:16:13,195
My work here is done.

659
01:16:14,582 --> 01:16:19,410
-What are you laughing at?
-She was my only mission. . .

660
01:16:19,587 --> 01:16:23,799
. . .and you brought her right to us.

661
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:30,095
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

662
01:16:30,264 --> 01:16:34,558
Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a
cross. He was killed by a soldier's spear.

663
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:36,886
The Spear of Destiny.

664
01:16:37,313 --> 01:16:40,018
l'm a Catholic, John.
l know the Crucifixion story.

665
01:16:48,908 --> 01:16:53,736
l drew out the sister as you asked.

666
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:59,536
She's been made flush and ready.

667
01:16:59,711 --> 01:17:03,459
So much power.

668
01:17:03,756 --> 01:17:08,964
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
l shall serve.

669
01:17:11,556 --> 01:17:15,091
Wait. But l did as we agreed.

670
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:18,886
No. Please. No!

671
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:26,732
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

672
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:31,273
How's the blood of God's only son?

673
01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:33,948
The stains on the spear.

674
01:17:35,246 --> 01:17:38,117
-Yeah.
-So he gets the spear.

675
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:40,449
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

676
01:17:41,627 --> 01:17:43,122
Not really.

677
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:47,544
Twins.

678
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:51,129
Where's the amulet?

679
01:17:52,388 --> 01:17:55,473
l don't know,
l must have left it in the--

680
01:17:57,143 --> 01:17:58,471
What's wrong?

681
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,728
l don't know, l just feel--

682
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:34,303
-Bird on a ladder.
-Sorry.

683
01:18:39,894 --> 01:18:42,053
-Wait here.
-Yeah.

684
01:18:45,274 --> 01:18:48,192
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

685
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:04,657
Have you lost what little mind you have?

686
01:19:04,919 --> 01:19:06,497
Don't.

687
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,132
l need to use the chair.

688
01:19:10,299 --> 01:19:14,344
l offer no aid to one side or the other.

689
01:19:15,346 --> 01:19:18,098
-The balance.
-Screw the balance.

690
01:19:24,188 --> 01:19:26,679
You dare? ln my house?

691
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:32,861
ls this neutral? Bullshit.

692
01:19:33,072 --> 01:19:35,990
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

693
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,907
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

694
01:19:40,413 --> 01:19:44,493
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once too, remember?

695
01:19:45,585 --> 01:19:48,290
l need your help!

696
01:19:50,423 --> 01:19:52,961
Consider it a last request.

697
01:19:56,763 --> 01:19:59,598
You play a dangerous game.

698
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:08,765
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

699
01:20:10,777 --> 01:20:15,439
That little shit has been trying to climb
out of his father's shadow for eons.

700
01:20:15,615 --> 01:20:20,526
l'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

701
01:20:23,623 --> 01:20:25,995
Forgot how big it was.

702
01:20:26,376 --> 01:20:30,788
Two hundred souls passed through
this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

703
01:20:30,963 --> 01:20:32,623
Yeah.

704
01:20:35,843 --> 01:20:38,002
Which way's east?

705
01:20:55,822 --> 01:20:58,491
How many years since you've surfed?

706
01:20:59,742 --> 01:21:01,699
Like riding a bike.

707
01:21:01,869 --> 01:21:03,862
No, not really.

708
01:21:06,582 --> 01:21:09,370
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

709
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:14,917
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

710
01:21:21,306 --> 01:21:22,716
Cold.

711
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:25,013
Little flavor?

712
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:50,409
-Sure about this?
-No.

713
01:22:40,593 --> 01:22:42,253
Midnite!

714
01:22:47,976 --> 01:22:51,095
-Any luck?
-That's a word for it.

715
01:22:51,437 --> 01:22:54,853
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

716
01:23:02,615 --> 01:23:06,992
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

717
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,247
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

718
01:23:12,417 --> 01:23:14,077
Half-breeds are most vulnerable. . .

719
01:23:14,252 --> 01:23:18,202
. . .when their outer skin is breached
by holy water.

720
01:23:18,673 --> 01:23:22,006
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of lsteria. . .

721
01:23:22,176 --> 01:23:24,667
. . .have been used by even
the unordained to bless. . .

722
01:23:24,846 --> 01:23:26,719
. . .commonly occurring waters. . .

723
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:28,633
. . .even rain.

724
01:23:29,183 --> 01:23:30,559
Maybe if. . . .

725
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:38,641
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

726
01:23:38,818 --> 01:23:42,685
You wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet. . .

727
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:44,940
. . .maybe we could take with us?

728
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:49,654
Look, John, no offense, l just don't think
that it's a great idea, you know. . .

729
01:23:49,829 --> 01:23:53,163
. . .you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

730
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:56,002
l don't know what pops thinks,
but that's--

731
01:23:57,337 --> 01:24:00,373
Take him, John. Kill him after.

732
01:24:05,511 --> 01:24:09,805
lf you get back, see me
about membership. Maybe.

733
01:24:09,974 --> 01:24:12,892
Okay. l will.

734
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:19,937
-What are you doing?
-Praying.

735
01:24:20,109 --> 01:24:23,063
Praying. Okay.

736
01:24:23,988 --> 01:24:25,648
Come on.

737
01:25:22,672 --> 01:25:24,214
Half-breeds, right?

738
01:25:27,093 --> 01:25:31,589
A birth like this, they're definitely
gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

739
01:25:32,015 --> 01:25:33,509
Yeah.

740
01:25:36,519 --> 01:25:41,015
We can get through them. l mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

741
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:42,851
Right?

742
01:25:43,192 --> 01:25:46,561
lt's not always like it is in the books.

743
01:26:34,952 --> 01:26:36,696
What is that?

744
01:26:37,205 --> 01:26:39,197
Hellspeak.

745
01:26:41,834 --> 01:26:43,910
You know what to do.

746
01:26:47,173 --> 01:26:48,833
l'm okay.

747
01:26:50,677 --> 01:26:52,420
Sure.

748
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:06,853
One last show.

749
01:27:40,768 --> 01:27:42,393
Hi.

750
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:44,307
My name's John.

751
01:27:46,566 --> 01:27:50,065
You are in violation of the balance.

752
01:27:50,903 --> 01:27:53,276
Leave immediately. . .

753
01:27:53,573 --> 01:27:56,242
. . .or l will deport you.

754
01:27:58,202 --> 01:28:00,029
All of you.

755
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:09,329
Go to hell.

756
01:28:14,969 --> 01:28:16,428
Holy water?

757
01:29:34,132 --> 01:29:36,338
Angela.

758
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:10,291
John?

759
01:30:12,587 --> 01:30:13,915
John.

760
01:30:19,677 --> 01:30:21,219
Shit.

761
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:47,954
Pull!

762
01:31:28,871 --> 01:31:30,200
Angela.

763
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:55,853
Angela, what is it?

764
01:32:02,572 --> 01:32:04,861
Get it out.

765
01:32:18,338 --> 01:32:19,880
Get it out.

766
01:32:20,465 --> 01:32:22,504
Get it--

767
01:33:06,469 --> 01:33:07,797
Oh, my God.

768
01:33:15,061 --> 01:33:16,639
Not bad, kid.

769
01:33:19,649 --> 01:33:21,641
''Not bad. '' You hear that?

770
01:33:21,818 --> 01:33:26,230
You know why that is? lt's because
this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, ass--

771
01:33:34,122 --> 01:33:36,031
Chas.

772
01:33:44,048 --> 01:33:46,622
You're right, John.

773
01:33:47,885 --> 01:33:49,593
lt's not like the books.

774
01:33:50,763 --> 01:33:52,423
No. . .

775
01:33:53,349 --> 01:33:55,176
. . .it isn't.

776
01:34:16,122 --> 01:34:18,909
lnto the light, l command thee.

777
01:34:19,959 --> 01:34:23,411
lnto the light, l command thee.

778
01:34:24,547 --> 01:34:28,675
lnto the light, l command thee.

779
01:34:33,222 --> 01:34:36,841
lnto the light, l command thee.

780
01:34:40,063 --> 01:34:42,933
Your ego is astounding.

781
01:34:43,107 --> 01:34:44,899
Gabriel.

782
01:34:45,068 --> 01:34:46,396
Figures.

783
01:34:47,612 --> 01:34:51,028
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

784
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,606
You judging me now, John?

785
01:34:54,869 --> 01:34:58,867
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

786
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,990
l am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

787
01:35:03,419 --> 01:35:07,084
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

788
01:35:07,799 --> 01:35:09,127
Help me here.

789
01:35:13,179 --> 01:35:17,473
You're handed this precious gift, right?

790
01:35:18,685 --> 01:35:22,729
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

791
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:26,269
Murderers, rapists and molesters. . .

792
01:35:26,442 --> 01:35:28,768
. . .all of you, you just have to repent. . .

793
01:35:28,945 --> 01:35:31,780
. . .and God takes you into his bosom.

794
01:35:34,117 --> 01:35:36,358
ln all the worlds in all the universe. . .

795
01:35:36,536 --> 01:35:39,453
. . .no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

796
01:35:41,916 --> 01:35:43,245
lt's not fair.

797
01:35:47,422 --> 01:35:51,371
lf sweet, sweet God loves you so. . .

798
01:35:51,551 --> 01:35:54,552
. . .then l'll make you worthy of his love.

01:35:56,222 --> 01:35:59,342
l've been watching you for a long time.

800
01:35:59,517 --> 01:36:04,179
lt's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

801
01:36:04,355 --> 01:36:08,187
And you can be so noble.

802
01:36:10,903 --> 01:36:12,481
So. . .

803
01:36:13,156 --> 01:36:15,481
. . .l'll bring you pain.

804
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,531
l'll bring you horror.

805
01:36:20,246 --> 01:36:23,330
So that you may rise above it.

806
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:30,709
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth. . .

807
01:36:30,882 --> 01:36:33,836
. . .will be worthy of God's love.

808
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:35,801
Gabriel. . .

809
01:36:36,262 --> 01:36:38,504
. . .you're insane.

810
01:36:40,433 --> 01:36:43,636
The road to salvation begins tonight.

811
01:36:44,437 --> 01:36:46,145
Right now.

812
01:37:27,814 --> 01:37:30,815
l know l'm not one of your favorites.

813
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,112
l'm not even welcome in your house.

814
01:37:36,698 --> 01:37:39,533
But l could use a little attention.

815
01:37:42,829 --> 01:37:44,537
Please.

816
01:38:30,918 --> 01:38:33,291

Lu.

822
01:40:16,566 --> 01:40:18,642
What took you so long?

823
01:40:18,818 --> 01:40:21,107
Hello, John.

824
01:40:21,821 --> 01:40:25,155
John, hello.

825
01:40:29,996 --> 01:40:32,950
You're the one soul. . .

to collect myself.

827

So l've heard.

828
01:40:43,426 --> 01:40:44,754
You mind?

829
01:40:45,803 --> 01:40:48,176
Oh, go-- Go right ahead. l've got stock.

830
01:40:49,182 --> 01:40:50,593
Coffin nail.

831
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:52,974
Very fitting, John.

832
01:40:55,855 --> 01:40:59,390
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons. . .

833
01:40:59,567 --> 01:41:02,354
. . .finger movement goes
out the window.

834
01:41:02,528 --> 01:41:04,604
Let me help you.

835
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,578
See?

836
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:20,831
Sonny. . .

837
01:41:21,005 --> 01:41:26,130
. . .l've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

838
01:41:26,886 --> 01:41:28,428
Well, aren't you a peach.

839
01:41:30,223 --> 01:41:34,055
l didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

840
01:41:38,898 --> 01:41:40,855
And you didn't. . .

841
01:41:41,609 --> 01:41:43,353
. . .did you?

842
01:41:43,653 --> 01:41:45,277
So how's the family?

843
01:41:45,446 --> 01:41:51,401
Family's doing just fine.
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

844
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:55,244
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

845
01:41:55,415 --> 01:41:58,451
Well, one does what one can.

846
01:41:58,626 --> 01:42:00,251
He's in the other room.

847
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:03,207
Boys will be boys.

848
01:42:04,424 --> 01:42:05,752
With Gabriel.

849
01:42:08,594 --> 01:42:11,382
No accounting for taste, really.

850
01:42:11,764 --> 01:42:14,172
They have the Spear of Destiny.

851
01:42:16,936 --> 01:42:20,637
''They have the Spear of Destiny. ''

852
01:42:28,948 --> 01:42:32,151
Or is it another one of your cons?

853
01:42:34,245 --> 01:42:36,534
Go look for yourself.

854
01:42:39,584 --> 01:42:43,202
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu. . .

855
01:42:43,588 --> 01:42:46,624
. . .what's another 20 seconds?

856
01:43:51,364 --> 01:43:56,571
-Lucifer.
-This world is mine. ln time.

857
01:43:56,744 --> 01:43:59,318
You, best of all of us, Gabriel. . .

858
01:43:59,497 --> 01:44:04,704
. . .should understand ambition.

859
01:44:04,877 --> 01:44:07,368
Son of perdition.

860
01:44:08,256 --> 01:44:09,584
Little horn.

861
01:44:11,718 --> 01:44:13,924
Most unclean.

862
01:44:14,095 --> 01:44:16,716
l do miss the old names.

863
01:44:17,598 --> 01:44:19,805
Time to go home, son.

864
01:44:19,976 --> 01:44:22,431
l will smite thee. . .

865
01:44:22,603 --> 01:44:25,521
. . .in his honor.

866
01:44:30,653 --> 01:44:35,778
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

867
01:44:53,593 --> 01:44:55,420
Father?

868
01:45:18,826 --> 01:45:20,237
So.

869
01:45:27,251 --> 01:45:28,580
So.

870
01:45:28,961 --> 01:45:32,710
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

871
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:39,463
The sister. . .

872
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:41,718
. . .lsabel.

873
01:45:43,643 --> 01:45:45,552
What about her?

874
01:45:47,563 --> 01:45:49,971
Let her go home.

875
01:45:52,694 --> 01:45:57,272
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

876
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:10,119
Fine. lt's done.

877
01:46:12,755 --> 01:46:16,207
Time to go, John.

878
01:46:16,551 --> 01:46:18,175
Yeah.

879
01:47:16,027 --> 01:47:18,020
The sacrifice.

880
01:47:29,624 --> 01:47:35,627
No. This one belongs to me.

881
01:47:45,598 --> 01:47:51,434
No. You will live, John Constantine.

882
01:47:54,524 --> 01:47:55,935
You will live.

883
01:47:58,528 --> 01:48:00,983
So you will have. . .

884
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:05,320
. . .the chance to prove. . .

885
01:48:07,954 --> 01:48:13,328
. . .that your soul truly belongs in hell.

886
01:48:16,379 --> 01:48:19,463
Oh, you will live.

887
01:48:23,803 --> 01:48:27,670
You will live.

888
01:49:41,464 --> 01:49:43,457
Thank you.

889
01:49:45,885 --> 01:49:47,842
No problem.

890
01:50:03,903 --> 01:50:05,647
Human.

891
01:50:07,573 --> 01:50:10,111
You don't deserve to be human.

892
01:50:11,619 --> 01:50:16,328
Do you want revenge?
ls that what you're thinking right now?

893
01:50:18,793 --> 01:50:20,371
Do it.

894
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:23,213
Do it.

895
01:50:24,757 --> 01:50:26,916
Seek revenge.

896
01:50:27,093 --> 01:50:29,382
End my life.

897
01:50:30,096 --> 01:50:31,638
Go on.

898
01:50:33,766 --> 01:50:35,261
Be the hand of God.

899
01:50:35,435 --> 01:50:37,807
lt's your choice.

900
01:50:37,979 --> 01:50:40,221
lt's always been your choice.

901
01:50:45,528 --> 01:50:46,939
Yeah.

902
01:50:52,618 --> 01:50:54,991
That's called pain.

903
01:50:55,163 --> 01:50:56,538
Get used to it.

904
01:51:02,962 --> 01:51:05,121
You could've shot me, John!

905
01:51:07,258 --> 01:51:10,129
You chose a higher path!

906
01:51:11,554 --> 01:51:14,341
Look how well you're doing!

907
01:51:39,874 --> 01:51:41,914
Nice spot.

908
01:51:46,172 --> 01:51:47,666
l have something for you.

909
01:51:50,718 --> 01:51:53,470
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

910
01:51:56,516 --> 01:51:59,054
Oh, how thoughtful.

911
01:52:04,357 --> 01:52:06,184
John. . .

912
01:52:07,652 --> 01:52:09,941
. . .why are you giving me this?

913
01:52:10,113 --> 01:52:11,571
Rules.

914
01:52:11,864 --> 01:52:13,359
Hide it.

915
01:52:13,533 --> 01:52:16,569
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

916
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:19,280
Not even me.

917
01:52:23,459 --> 01:52:25,251
Always a catch.

918
01:52:26,713 --> 01:52:28,290
Yeah.

919
01:52:41,394 --> 01:52:43,221
So.

920
01:52:44,856 --> 01:52:47,892
l've got some cleaning up to do.

921
01:52:51,738 --> 01:52:53,730

l'd like that.

924
01:53:30,610 --> 01:53:33,480
I guess there's a plan for all of us.

925
01:53:33,655 --> 01:53:35,232
I had to die...

926
01:53:35,406 --> 01:53:36,735
... twice...

927
01:53:36,908 --> 01:53:39,114
...just to figure that out.

928
01:53:39,285 --> 01:53:44,280
Like the book says, he works his work
in mysterious ways.

929
01:53:44,457 --> 01:53:46,615
Some people like it...

930
01:53:46,793 --> 01:53:49,331
...some people don 't.

931
01:59:42,732 --> 01:59:44,855
You did good, kid.
