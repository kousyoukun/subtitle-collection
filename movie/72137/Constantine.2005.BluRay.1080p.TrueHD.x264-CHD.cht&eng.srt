“擁有命運之矛的人將掌握世界的命運”

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,506
命運之矛自從二戰之后就下落不明

（墨西哥）

曼紐爾

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,295
曼紐爾！

（洛杉磯）

11
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,527
我想……
l think. . . .

12
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,910
我給你找著了一個
l think l found you one.

13
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,496
這次我可是給你打電話了
Look, l called you, right?

14
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,880
我一發現自己搞不定
就馬上給你打電話了，約翰
Soon as l couldn't pull it out myself,
l called you, John.

15
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:32,893
別擔心，沒事的
我們必須得把她綁上，你明白嗎？
lt's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

16
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,947
沒事的
lt's okay.

17
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,832
我是康斯坦丁
This is Constantine.

18
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:36,130
約翰·康斯坦丁
你這混蛋
John Constantine, asshole.

19
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,635
當然
Sure.

20
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,827
怎么了？
What the hell?

21
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:28,807
我需要一面鏡子
l need a mirror.

22
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,100
快去拿！
至少要3英尺高
Now. At least 3 feet high.

23
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:34,944
愣著干嘛，快去拿啊！
Move! Go, now!

24
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,832
我是克雷默
This is Kramer.

25
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,373
查斯·克雷默
你這混蛋
Chas Kramer, asshole.

26
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,255
混蛋
Asshole.

27
00:06:56,424 --> 00:07:01,631
什么？哦，我是克雷默
查斯·克雷默，混蛋
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

28
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,927
- 查斯！
- 什么事？
-Chas!
-What?

29
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,850
- 把車挪開
- 為什么？
-Move the car.
-Why?

30
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,808
叫你挪你就挪！
Move the damn car!

31
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,232
“查斯，把車挪開”
''Chas, move the car. ''

32
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:17,772
好吧，挪了
There, car's moved.

33
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,907
把鏡子舉起來，對著床
Lift it up over the bed.

34
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:36,999
把那頭系牢
亨內斯，從上面拉過去
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

35
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:43,680
把你們的眼睛閉上
不管發生什么都別睜開
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

36
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,726
不！
No!

37
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:06,113
現身吧
Show yourself.

38
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,246
來笑一個，你這傻X
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

39
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,125
操你媽！
For your boss.

40
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,220
拉！
Pull it!

41
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,615
媽媽？
Ma? Ma?

42
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:33,991
我說得沒錯吧，約翰，給你找著一個
是不是？
Like l said, l found you something,
didn't l, John? Didn't l?

43
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,831
那儿怎么了？
What happened in there?

44
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,506
最近會議很多吧
Going to a lot of meetings, l see.

45
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:47,799
鬧得我都睡不著
Keeps the voices out so l can sleep.

46
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,428
我得睡覺，約翰
l have to sleep, John.

47
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,638
我需要幫助，神父
l need some help, Father.

48
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,937
你？
You do?

49
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,855
要我幫助？
From me?

50
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,731
什么樣的……？
What kind of--?

51
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:07,149
- 听著，我……
- 你那种驅魔術不對
-Hey, listen, l--
-That exorcism wasn't right.

52
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,986
听著廣播
Listen to the ether.

53
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,578
如果有什么异常，一定要告訴我
Anything unusual, you let me know.

54
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:22,119
來吧，你不需要它的保護
它今天可能還會回來
Come on, you don't need its protection.
lt'll be like back in the day.

55
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,501
或許几天
A few days.

56
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,005
好吧
Okay.

57
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:32,594
好吧，為了你，約翰
Okay. For you, John.

58
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,553
約翰，你明知這不是我的車
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

59
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,310
- 我告訴過你讓你挪開的
- 你是告訴過我
-l told you to move it.
-You did tell me to move it. . .

60
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:45,983
可是如果你告訴我
你要扔下來一個裝著魔鬼的300磅的鏡子
. . .but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon. . .

61
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:47,981
我會把車挪得更遠一點
. . .l would've moved it further, John.

62
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:51,816
- 去阿爾瓦拉多大街
- 好的先生，我知道怎么走
-Take Alvarado.
-Yeah, thank you. l know what to take.

63
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:56,861
你有沒有考慮過，如果多告訴我一些事情
說不定我能幫上忙呢？
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe l could help out?

64
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,368
- 沒有？
- 沒有
-No?
-Nope.

65
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,869
沒有？
Nope?

66
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,119
當然是——沒有
Of course it's a nope.

67
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,790
保佑我，神父，我有罪
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.

68
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,045
我已經……
It's been...

69
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:50,257
有兩個禮拜沒來忏悔了
... two weeks since my last confession.

70
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,801
今天我殺了個人
l killed a man today.

71
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,593
又一個
Another one.

72
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:08,017
我甚至連他長什么樣都沒看清
l didn't even see his face, l just. . .

73
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,436
就扣下了扳机
接著他就死了
. . .pulled the trigger, and he went away.

74
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:18,826
大多數警察20年都不開一槍
Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.

75
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:24,079
而我卻總是知道
這些家伙藏在哪儿
Why do I always know
where these guys are?

76
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:27,585
該朝哪儿瞄准，什么時候開槍
Where to aim, when to fire.

77
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,169
神父，我在想
會不會是我有什么問題？
I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?

78
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:35,004
被詛咒了？
Something damned?

79
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:40,518
上帝自有安排
他給我們每個人都安排好了
God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.

80
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:45,099
別讓罪惡吞沒了你的信念
You mustn 't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.

81
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:47,312
是的，我在努力
Yeah, I'm trying.

82
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:50,558
一直都在努力
I'm trying real hard.

83
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:53,483
伊莎貝爾
Isabel.

84
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:46,705
伊莎貝爾
Isabel.

85
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:45,633
我所戰胜的東西
Things l've beaten.

86
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,518
大多數人听都沒听說過
Things most people never even heard of.

87
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:53,100
可是現在呢
我卻要被這玩意儿搞定
And now l'm gonna be done in by this.

88
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,560
你也不是第一個了，約翰
Wouldn't be the first, John.

89
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,487
得了吧，萊絲
Come on, Les.

90
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,983
你救過我一次
這次也可以，對嗎？
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

91
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:06,031
癌細胞已經擴散了
This is aggressive.

92
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:10,286
20年前，你不想來這儿
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

93
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:13,457
現在你又不想离開
Now you don't wanna leave.

94
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,288
你還抽
Yeah, that's a good idea.

95
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,253
約翰，你真的需要准備一下了
John, you really need to prepare.

96
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:28,806
- 安排后事吧
- 沒必要
-Make arrangements.
-No need.

97
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,140
我很清楚自己何去何從
l already know exactly where l'm going.

98
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,109
- 早
- 早上好
-Morning.
-Good morning.

99
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,235
- 早上好
- 探長
-Good morning.
-Detective.

100
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,234
- 不，不不
- 安吉拉，等等
-No, no, no.
-Angela, wait.

101
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,079
你還是別看了，好嗎？別看了
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

102
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:48,747
大家先回避一下
Give us the room, please.

103
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,022
伊莎貝爾
lsabel.

104
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:31,035
她從屋頂上掉下來的？
She fell from the roof?

105
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,034
她跳下來的
She jumped.

106
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,795
- 不可能
- 听著
-No.
-Look. . .

107
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:41,126
我知道這很難接受
可她有病
. . .l know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

108
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:53,177
- 伊莎貝爾不會自殺的
- 安吉
-lsabel wouldn't kill herself.
-Angie.

109
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,889
- 她不會自殺的
- 探長
-She wouldn't kill herself.
-Detective.

110
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,394
- 皮瑞爾德
- 探長
-Period.
-Detective.

111
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,191
皮瑞爾德！
Period!

112
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,936
安吉，監控錄像都拍下來了
Angie, there were security cameras.

113
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,749
- 等一下，是下去么？
- 如果我有辦法，當然不想“下去”
-Hold the door. You going down?
-Not if l can help it.

114
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,048
有新案子？
A new case?

115
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:14,976
什么大案子？
是你期待已久的嗎？
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

116
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,182
- 少奉承我
- 習慣了
-Humor me.
-Don't l always?

117
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,771
哦，這是……
太感激了，謝謝
Oh, yeah, that's--
Much obliged. Thank you.

118
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,485
最近還好嗎，約翰？
How you feeling, John?

119
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,321
看看有什么新的貨色
So, what's new?

120
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:40,373
教皇遇刺時留下的子彈碎屑
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope. . .

121
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:44,163
采自約旦河的圣水針劑
. . .holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan. . .

122
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,251
還有……哦，這個你肯定喜歡
從阿米蒂維勒村找來的尖叫甲虫
（譯者注：參考電影"The Amityville Horror"）
. . .and-- Oh, you'll love this.
--screech beetle from Amityville.

123
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,512
是啊，對你來說很有趣
可對“下面”的東西來說，這就像黑板上釘釘
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the
fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

124
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:58,805
你和虫子，到底是什么關系？
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

125
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:01,889
我只是喜歡它們
l just like them.

126
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,940
是啊，誰不喜歡？
Yeah. Who doesn't?

127
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,152
悠著點，大英雄
Yeah, easy there, hero.

128
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:11,905
- 這是“龍之息”
- 我還以為你再也搞不到了呢
-That's dragon's breath.
-l thought you couldn't get it anymore.

129
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:16,869
是這樣，我朋友的朋友……
Yeah, well, l know a guy
who knows a guy.

130
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:26,628
好吧，這次是什么行動？
So, what's the action?

131
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:30,875
我剛把一個魔兵
從一個小女孩的身体里赶出來
l just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

132
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,139
看起來好像它想要复活
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

133
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,178
我懂你的意思
Yeah, l know how it sounds.

134
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:39,640
可是約翰，我們對他們來說
只不過是掌中的玩偶
No, we're finger puppets
to them, John. . .

135
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,188
而不是某种入口
. . .not doorways.

136
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:45,436
他們可以操縱我們
但不能穿透結界進到我們的世界中
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

137
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,231
還是查一下卷軸吧
看看以前有沒有先例
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

138
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,313
沒問題，約翰
Sure thing, John.

139
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,067
還有什么事嗎？
Anything else?

140
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,279
你那里有沒有什么可以……？
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a--?

141
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,284
免費的
（譯者注：止咳藥）
On the house.

142
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,825
好吧，我有個問題
我還得做你的奴隸到几時？
All right, question. How much longer
do l have to be your slave, John?

143
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:07,920
你不是我的奴隸，查斯
You're not my slave, Chas.

144
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,794
你是我非常賞識的徒弟
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

145
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,128
就像湯托和羅賓一樣
Like Tonto or Robin.

146
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:17,005
還有那個胖哥身邊的小家伙
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

147
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:21,050
好吧，那我除了開車之外
就不能干點別的了么？
Right. So then why don't l apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

148
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,648
約翰？約翰
John? John.

149
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:29,570
很高興和你談話，約翰
l love our little talks, John.

150
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,994
您的外套，康斯坦丁先生
May l take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

151
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,957
不用了，謝謝
我一會儿就走
No, thanks,
l'm not gonna be staying long.

152
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:52,709
- 這位女士，您呢？
- 哦不用了，我也一會儿就走
-How about you, ma'am?
-Oh, no, l'm not staying long either.

153
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:55,383
我真的要和他說話
有重要的事
l really need to speak with him.
lt's important.

154
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,260
先到先得
First come, first served.

155
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:04,514
看來你到哪儿都是這么粗魯
So you're rude no matter where you are.

156
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,113
- 神父
- 你好
-Father.
-Hi.

157
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,409
- 帶來什么新消息了
- 是的，剛和主教談過
-You have news. Yes.
-Yes, l spoke with the bishop.

158
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,081
我知道你要什么，孩子
l know what you want, son.

159
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:31,789
你那雙無所不見的眼睛還盯著我呢
加百列？
（譯者注：替上帝把好消息報告世人的天使）
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

160
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:35,377
承蒙夸獎
l'm flattered.

161
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,802
我可以告訴你一些
Well, l could offer something. . .

162
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:43,220
關于牧羊人是怎樣
帶領他最不听話的羊群的故事
. . .about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock. . .

163
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,470
可這听起來也許不夠真誠
. . .but it might sound disingenuous.

164
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:48,398
她應該得到天主教的葬禮
神父，求你了
She has to have a Catholic funeral,
Father. She has to.

165
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:52,778
- 安杰拉，她犯的是不可饒恕的大罪
- 她不是自殺的
-Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
-She didn't commit suicide.

166
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,567
可主教不這么想
你知道教規的
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

167
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,816
哦，教規
Oh, rules.

168
00:21:57,992 --> 00:21:59,819
神父
Father.

169
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:01,573
戴維
David.

170
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:05,157
她是伊莎貝爾
This is lsabel.

171
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,081
她惟一相信的愛她的人就是上帝
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

172
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:11,706
求你了
Please.

173
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,292
恕我無能為力
l'm sorry.

174
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:20,629
最近我看到一些异常的靈异活動
l've been seeing some unusual
soul traffic lately.

175
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,558
也許你能考慮再給我點時間
You might consider
giving me an extension.

176
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:26,300
我可以為你們這邊幫些忙
l could do your side some good
these days.

177
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,721
你還在為進入天堂積德呢？
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

178
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:32,644
沒見我赶走多少小鬼嗎？
What about the minions l've sent back?

179
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:36,982
- 光憑這個，就應該保證我能進天堂了
- 我跟你說過多少次了？
-That alone should guarantee my entry.
-How many times have l told you?

180
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,149
靠這樣是進不了天堂的
That's not the way this works.

181
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,030
為什么？我為他做的還不夠多嗎？
Why, haven't l served him enough?

182
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:45,955
- 他到底想要我怎么樣？
- 很簡單
-What does he want from me?
-Only the usual.

183
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:49,208
獻身，信仰
Self-sacrifice, belief.

184
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:52,580
- 哦，我信！我對天發誓
- 不，不，你自己心里有數
-Oh, l believe, for chrissake.
-No, no, you know.

185
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,997
其中的區別你也能看見
And there's a difference. You've seen.

186
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:59,836
我并沒有要求看見
我生下來就被詛咒了
l never asked to see.
l was born with this curse.

187
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,089
約翰，這是天賦
A gift, John.

188
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:04,756
而你只是用自私的行動把它浪費了
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

189
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:08,469
我把魔鬼從女孩的身体里赶走
l'm pulling demons out of little girls.

190
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,473
這是為了誰？
Who's that for?

191
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:15,183
你所做的一切都是為了你自己
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

192
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,603
為了積德好進入天堂
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

193
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,402
不可能的規則，無盡的約束
lmpossible rules, endless regulations. . .

194
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:24,703
誰上天，誰入地
為什么
. . .who goes up, who goes down
and why.

195
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,793
你一點都不理解我們
You don't even understand us.

196
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:35,083
你才應該入地獄
你這個雜种
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

197
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,809
為什么是我，加百列？
Why me, Gabriel?

198
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,638
這完全是因為我自己的緣故，是不是？
lt's personal, isn't it?

199
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:59,530
因為去教堂去得太少
也不怎么祈禱
l didn't go to church enough,
l didn't pray enough. . .

200
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:04,158
還舍不得往募捐箱里放上5塊錢
是不是？
. . .l was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

201
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:08,914
你這么年輕就要死
You are going to die young. . .

202
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:12,996
是因為你從15歲起就每天要吸30根煙
. . .because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 1 5.

203
00:24:13,544 --> 00:24:16,035
而你之所以要去地獄
And you're going to go to hell. . .

204
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:19,257
是因為你所過的生活
. . .because of the life you took.

205
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:26,132
你很失敗
You're fucked.

206
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:40,191
至少在外面感覺還不錯
At least it's nice out.

207
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:46,068
他總是一點幽默感都沒有
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

208
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,291
他的笑話一點都不好笑
And his punch lines are killers.

209
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,962
約翰！
John!

210
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:07,295
康斯坦丁，下雨哪！
約翰，嗨！
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

211
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:23,484
凶手的后院里發現埋藏著22具女尸
Twenty-two women were found buried
in the assailant's back yard.

212
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:27,357
尸体受到嚴重的摧殘
警察的辨認工作……
So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match....

213
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:29,991
据警察說
她的身体曾被穿刺超過100次
Police report she had been
physically penetrated...

214
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,914
然后被活埋
...over 1 00 times and buried alive.

215
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:36,831
……被發現鎖在冷藏庫中
頭部嚴重受傷，器官……
--found locked in a storage freezer,
his head severed and his organs....

216
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,794
他把霍莉的身体塞入……
He stuffed Holly's body into....

217
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:42,961
- 受到不明強暴的尸体……
- 他使用了一把小手鋸……
-The bodies ravished by the unknown....
-He used a small handsaw....

218
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:46,585
頭顱几乎被砍下來……
眼珠都被挖了出來
Had nearly decapitated....
Even his eyes were gouged out.

219
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,423
伊莎貝爾
Isabel.

220
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:58,850
（精神病院的自殺事件）

221
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:14,495
我很抱歉，妹妹
l'm so sorry, lzzy.

222
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,743
康斯坦丁
Constantine.

223
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:52,742
道森
Dodson.

224
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:54,697
喂？
Hello?

225
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:57,158
喂
Hello.

226
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,415
喂？
Hello?

227
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:09,862
嗨，老兄
能借個火嗎
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

228
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,018
別多管閒事，驅魔人
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

229
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,210
我知道你要去哪儿，約翰
你要去米耐那儿
l know where you're going, John.
You're going to Midnite's.

230
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:13,044
希望你呆在車里
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

231
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:17,003
那儿是鬼魂的避難所
我記得在書上讀到過，約翰
lt's a haven for those who rise and fall.
l remember reading about this, John.

232
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:19,933
- 你讀書讀得太多了，那是個酒吧
- 酒吧？
-You read too much, kid. lt's a bar.
-lt's a bar?

233
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:24,478
是酒吧，米耐老爹是個樂善好施的人
他曾經發誓堅守中立
lt's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for
good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

234
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:27,269
- 約翰，他可是傳奇人物
- 是的
-John, the man's a legend.
-Yeah.

235
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:29,933
你能帶我進去嗎？
約翰，求求你
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

236
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,653
求你了，約翰，行嗎？
l'm begging you, John, please?

237
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,986
- 好吧，你可以進去
- 我可以進去？
-Sure, you can get in.
-l can get in?

238
00:29:35,158 --> 00:29:37,364
如果你能進去的話
lf you can get in.

239
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,825
如果我能……？
是熊？還是云中的兩只鴨子？
lf l can get--? lt's a bear, though, right?
Or two ducks in a cloud?

240
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,578
長凳上的兩只青蛙
Two frogs on a bench.

241
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,883
長凳上的兩只青蛙
Two frogs on a bench.

242
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:56,044
不，我是和剛才那個人一起的……
No, no, l'm with the guy you just--

243
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,094
約翰！約翰！
John! John!

244
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:00,257
我是和他一起的
l'm with him, though.

245
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:03,349
穿著裙子的老鼠
Rat in a dress.

246
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,892
當然，穿著裙子的老鼠
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

247
00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:09,022
我只是試試，只是試試
l'm just testing. l'm just testing.

248
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,156
不用站起來了
Don't get up.

249
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,828
好久不見了
You've been absent some time.

250
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,997
又有什么圣物要賣嗎？
Have you come here with relics to sell?

251
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,583
沒有，現在不干那個了
太忙了
No, l'm out of that now.
l've been too busy.

252
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:19,634
終于發現造假對你的健康不利了？
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

253
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:21,761
米耐，上帝啊……
Midnite, Jesus. . .

254
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,347
……我想這件事是真的
. . .l thought the thing was authentic.

255
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,973
我知道了
l see now.

256
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:33,481
你的身体不好是因為其他原因
多長時間了？
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

257
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:35,443
几個月吧，可能一年
A few months, maybe a year.

258
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:38,281
我昨晚好像听到雷聲了
l thought l heard thunder last night.

259
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:41,567
肯定是撒旦的胃在咆哮
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

260
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,871
你的魂要他親自出馬來收
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

261
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,364
我也听說了
So l've heard.

262
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,836
好吧，我想你來這儿
Well, l am most certain
you did not come here. . .

263
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:55,170
肯定不是想找個有同情心的人來訴苦的
. . .for a sympathetic shoulder
to cry on.

264
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:01,252
剛才有個魔鬼攻擊了我
就在通往費格羅阿大街的路上
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

265
00:32:01,554 --> 00:32:03,677
他們不喜歡你，約翰
They don't like you, John.

266
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:05,722
你驅赶了多少個魔鬼？
How many have you
deported back to hell?

267
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:10,435
米耐，這次不是那种憤怒的雜种
而是實實在在的魔鬼，就在這儿，在我們的世界里
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

268
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:13,357
我想我不用提醒你
這是不可能的
Clearly l do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

269
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:15,850
還有昨天，我見到一個魔兵
And yesterday l saw a soldier demon. . .

270
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:18,518
試圖從一個小女孩身体里沖破結界
. . .trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

271
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:23,442
听著，約翰，魔鬼只能呆在地獄里
天使只能呆在天堂里
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven. . .

272
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:26,156
從造物之初就是這樣
. . .the great detente
of the original superpowers.

273
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:31,246
謝謝你給我上的歷史課，米耐
你真是幫了我大忙了
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

274
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,995
現在
Now. . .

275
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:36,630
我需要使用那把椅子
. . .l need to use the chair.

276
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,421
約翰，你難道忘了
這么做几乎肯定是要沒命的
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you. . .

277
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:46,305
你知道我是中立者
. . .you know l am neutral.

278
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:50,721
只要平衡沒有發生變化
我就保持中立
And as long as the balance
is maintained, l take no sides.

279
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:54,514
在你當酒吧侍應之前
Before you were a bartender. . .

280
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:59,057
你曾經是個巫醫
. . .you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

281
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:02,947
- 而我……
- 你是康斯坦丁
-And l--
-You were Constantine.

282
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:06,487
約翰·康斯坦丁
The John Constantine.

283
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:08,946
曾經是的
Once.

284
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,705
這次非比尋常，我能感覺得到
This isn't the usual game, l can feel it.

285
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,284
它在逼近
Something's coming.

286
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,087
膽小鬼
Spooky.

287
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,090
巴爾薩澤
Balthazar.

288
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:25,339
光是那种表情就讓我徹夜難眠
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

289
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:27,466
我來教你怎么睡覺
l'll make your night.

290
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,341
我現在就把你打回老家去
你這個雜碎！
l'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

291
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:37,848
你知道我這儿的規矩
在我這儿就要按我的規矩來
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

292
00:33:38,026 --> 00:33:39,983
小約翰
Johnny boy.

293
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:46,658
听說你快要下來了
Word is you're on your way down.

294
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:49,032
新鮮的肉啊
Fresh meat.

295
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:54,657
吮指回味
Finger-licking good.

296
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,828
約翰，我們還有事要談
We have a meeting now, John.

297
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:07,128
你說什么？我沒听清
What? l didn't catch that.

298
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,929
歡迎加入我的生活
Welcome to my life.

299
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:03,813
康斯坦丁先生
Mr. Constantine.

300
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:08,355
- 我們之前……
- 我記得
-l saw you--
-l remember.

301
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,992
- 后來還在……
- 看來咱們還真是有緣
-And then l saw you at the--
-Regular kismet.

302
00:35:13,204 --> 00:35:16,703
能不能容我問几個問題
l'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

303
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,959
現在我不想和任何人說話
l'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

304
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:22,786
好吧，那光听我說可以嗎？
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

305
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:25,083
行嗎？
Please?

306
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:30,886
就知道沒那么簡單
Always a catch.

307
00:35:45,737 --> 00:35:48,441
昨天我妹妹被謀殺了
My sister was murdered yesterday.

308
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:51,568
- 很遺憾
- 謝了
-Sorry to hear.
-Thanks.

309
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:56,827
她是雷文斯卡精神病院的病人
從屋頂跳下去死的
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

310
00:35:57,498 --> 00:35:59,456
剛才好像听你說是謀殺？
Thought you said she was murdered.

311
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,626
是的，伊莎貝爾不可能自殺的
Yeah, well, lsabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

312
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:06,460
也是，什么樣的精神病人會自殺呢？
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

313
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,542
真可怕
That's just crazy.

314
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:17,422
是這樣的，我听說你在這塊很有名
Look, l've heard your name
around the precinct.

315
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:22,809
我知道你活動的圈子
超自然，鬼神學，驅魔……
l know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

316
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:26,600
就在我妹妹被殺之前
她得了嚴重的妄想症
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

317
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:31,487
她開始談論魔鬼，天使
She started talking about demons,
angels.

318
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:34,409
我想她是被什么人影響了
康斯坦丁先生
Now, l think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

319
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:38,361
她肯定是被洗了腦
才會從屋頂上跳下去的
l think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

320
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:43,000
某种邪教組織
Some kind of legion or cult.

321
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:46,129
你分析得很有道理啊
大偵探
Sounds like a theory, detective.

322
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:47,708
祝你好運
Good luck.

323
00:36:50,051 --> 00:36:52,589
我想以你的背景
至少可以……
l thought with your background,
you could at least. . .

324
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,422
給我指明正确的方向
. . .point me in the right direction.

325
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:56,922
可以，當然可以
Yeah, okay, sure.

326
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:02,262
她不是自殺
lt wasn't a suicide.

327
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:04,597
我妹妹是個虔誠的天主教徒
My sister was a devout Catholic.

328
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:07,265
你懂嗎？
如果她自己結束自己的生命
Do you understand that?
lf she took her own life--

329
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:10,230
她的靈魂會直接下地獄
Her soul would go straight to hell. . .

330
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:15,530
在尖叫中一次又一次地被撕裂
飽受折磨，极度痛苦
. . .where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony. . .

331
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:18,952
永世不得翻身，對嗎？
. . .for all eternity. That it?

332
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:21,161
我說得沒錯吧？
That about right?

333
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:30,254
你他媽的
Goddamn you.

334
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,074
偵探
Detective.

335
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:05,083
如果我告訴你
上帝和魔鬼打了個賭……
What if l told you that God
and the devil made a wager. . .

336
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:08,750
他們的賭注就是所有人類的靈魂
你信么？
. . .a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

337
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:11,412
我會告訴你回去找你的醫生
l'd tell you to stay on your meds.

338
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:15,885
別跟我爭
他們的約定是不能直接涉足人間
Humor me. No direct contact with
humans. That would be the rule.

339
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,432
- 只能施加影響，最后看誰能贏
- 好吧，我不跟你爭
-Just influence. See who would win.
-Okay, l'm humoring you.

340
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,676
- 可是為什么呢？
- 誰知道呢
-Why?
-Who knows.

341
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:25,936
- 也許只是為了好玩
- 哦，這可真好玩
-Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
-Oh, so it's fun.

342
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:31,100
丈夫打死妻子好玩么？
母親淹死孩子好玩么？
lt's fun when a man beats his wife to
death, when a mother drowns her baby.

343
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:35,026
你覺得這都歸因于魔鬼？
And you think the devil is responsible?

344
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:37,949
你錯了，康斯坦丁
是人，人才是魔鬼
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

345
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:41,569
你說得很對
人性本惡
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

346
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:45,494
再加上受到其他某种東西的引導……
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

347
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:49,118
好吧，謝謝你給我上了一課
Well, this has been real educational. . .

348
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:51,003
可我不相信有什么魔鬼
. . .but l don't believe in the devil.

349
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:54,623
你應該相信
就如魔鬼相信你的存在
You should. He believes in you.

350
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:16,985
只是停電了
lt's a power outage.

351
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:19,114
不像
Not likely.

352
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:25,160
- 什么？
- 不能呆在這儿了，快走
-What?
-We should go. Now.

353
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:32,287
那是什么？
What is that?

354
00:39:33,381 --> 00:39:35,124
翅膀
Wings.

355
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:38,047
也許是魔爪
Maybe talons.

356
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:41,091
別開玩笑了，你說什么？
You're kidding. Of what?

357
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:45,099
一些不該在這儿的東西
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

358
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:51,643
槍在這儿基本上沒用
That's really not going to help.

359
00:39:56,237 --> 00:39:58,906
- 閉上眼睛
- 為什么？
-Close your eyes.
-Why?

360
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:00,402
為了你自己
Suit yourself.

361
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:26,055
誰說魔鬼只呆在地獄里？
Demons stay in hell, huh?

362
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:29,469
得告訴他們
Tell them that.

363
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:36,482
別擔心
第一次都是這樣
Don't worry. Happens to everyone
the first time.

364
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:38,775
那是硫磺
lt's the sulfur.

365
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:41,356
硫磺
Sulfur.

366
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:45,984
那些東西是什么？
What were those things?

367
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:49,038
魔鬼
Demons.

368
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,246
- 被詛咒的食腐怪
- 不，這不可能
-Scavengers of the damned.
-No, no. lt's impossible.

369
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:59,205
信不信由你
而且我認為它們不是來找我的
Yeah. And l don't think
they were after me.

370
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:04,380
你真的認為她不是自殺的？
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

371
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:05,966
伊莎貝爾？
lsabel?

372
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,842
絕對不信
Never in a million years.

373
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:11,303
好吧，我們來确認一下
Well, let's be sure.

374
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:14,012
看看她是不是在地獄里
Let's see if she's in hell.

375
00:41:38,423 --> 00:41:40,664
哦，應該是冷水還是熱水？
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

376
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:43,292
放在椅子前面
ln front of the chair.

377
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,007
真不敢相信我居然在干這個
l can't believe l'm doing this.

378
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:50,804
- 這些都是伊莎貝爾的東西？
- 對
-These are all lsabel's things?
-Yeah.

379
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,846
- 這貓呢？
- 達珂？
-How about the cat?
-Duck?

380
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,640
是啊，怎么了？
Yeah, why?

381
00:41:57,692 --> 00:41:59,020
達珂
Duck.

382
00:41:59,193 --> 00:42:01,519
哦，覺得奇怪是么
Oh, you think that's strange.

383
00:42:01,696 --> 00:42:03,155
貓是很好的動物
Cats are good.

384
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:04,947
很有靈性
Half in, half out anyway.

385
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:26,462
如果你要施某种法術或什么的話
lf this is some kind of spell
or something. . .

386
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:29,804
難道不需要點蜡燭和畫五角星么？
. . .don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

387
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:32,299
哦？你有嗎？
Why, do you have any?

388
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:35,556
- 簡直是瘋了
- 是的
-This is crazy.
-Yes.

389
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:41,439
你得离開
l need you to leave.

390
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:45,113
- 為什么？
- 安吉拉，拜托
-l'm sorry?
-Angela, please.

391
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,403
我是說离開這屋子
The apartment.

392
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:55,241
好吧
Okay.

393
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:04,127
當心我的貓
Be careful with that cat.

394
00:43:08,262 --> 00:43:10,967
上帝，我恨干這個
God, l hate this part.

395
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:16,592
- 伊莎貝爾
- 康斯坦丁
-lsabel.
-Constantine.

396
00:46:02,145 --> 00:46:03,555
安吉拉
Angela.

397
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:08,567
上帝
Jesus.

398
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,524
- 康斯坦丁，你怎么啦？
- 雙胞胎
-Constantine, what--?
-Twins.

399
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:16,608
上帝，你說什么？
Jesus. What?

400
00:46:17,535 --> 00:46:20,026
- 你們是雙胞胎
- 你說什么？
-You were twins.
-What did you say?

401
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:22,874
- 她是自殺的
- 什么？
-She killed herself.
-What?

402
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,621
因此被罰入地獄
And she's damned for it.

403
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,342
這怎么可能？
How is this possible?

404
00:46:43,895 --> 00:46:45,722
我得吃點東西
l need to eat.

405
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:35,954
嗨，嗨！
你在這儿干什么？
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

406
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:40,878
別激動，哥們儿
Relax, man.

407
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,297
慢點！
Slow down!

408
00:49:06,537 --> 00:49:09,455
這儿他媽的是什么地方？
What the hell kind of place is this?

409
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:01,841
約翰
John.

410
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:36,157
我小的時候
能看到一些東西
When l was a kid, l could see things.

411
00:50:36,669 --> 00:50:38,709
一些人類看不到的東西
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

412
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:43,168
也是不應該看到的東西
Things you shouldn 't have to see.

413
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:05,071
我父母都是正常人
他們像大多數父母一樣
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

414
00:51:05,281 --> 00:51:07,737
讓情況變得更糟
They made it worse.

415
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:12,990
當你覺得再也無法忍受的時候
You think you're crazy long enough. . .

416
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:14,784
你就會尋找出路
. . .you find a way out.

417
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:19,040
- 你嘗試自殺？
- 我什么都沒嘗試
-You tried to kill yourself.
-I didn 't try anything.

418
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,925
准确的說，我死過兩分鐘
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

419
00:51:26,803 --> 00:51:29,210
但是當我跨入另一個世界的時候
But when you cross over. . .

420
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,715
時間就停止了
. . .time stops.

421
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:37,014
我敢說
地獄里的兩分鐘就像一生那么漫長
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

422
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,229
當我重回人世的時候
When l came back. . .

423
00:51:43,152 --> 00:51:44,944
我終于知道
. . .l knew. . .

424
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,031
我能看到的所有的東西都是真實的
. . .all the things l could see were real.

425
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:54,492
天堂和地獄無處不在
每一堵牆，每一扇窗后面
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

426
00:51:54,664 --> 00:51:59,658
這個世界背后還有一個世界
而我們被夾在中間
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

427
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:03,370
天使和魔鬼都不能逾越
進入我們的世界
Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

428
00:52:03,548 --> 00:52:06,465
所以，我們看到的就是所謂的“雜种”
So instead we get
what l call half-breeds.

429
00:52:07,593 --> 00:52:09,835
蠱惑者
The influence peddlers.

430
00:52:10,013 --> 00:52:15,469
它們只能在你耳邊煽風點火
但是它的一句話就能給你勇气
They can only whisper in our ears, but
a single word can give you courage...

431
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:19,688
或者讓你一下子從快樂的巔峰
掉落到痛苦的深淵
...or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.

432
00:52:19,856 --> 00:52:22,892
那些被魔鬼触碰的
Those with the demon 's touch...

433
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:28,109
比如半天使
是和我們生活在一起的
...like those part angel,
living alongside us.

434
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,772
他們稱之為平衡
They call it the balance.

435
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,320
而我稱之為虛偽的狗屁
l call it hypocritical bullshit.

436
00:52:35,872 --> 00:52:38,445
所以當哪個雜种不守規矩
So when a half-breed breaks the rules. . .

437
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:42,908
我會直接讓他滾進地獄
. . .l deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

438
00:52:43,546 --> 00:52:46,167
這樣的雜种太多了
l don't get them all. . .

439
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:50,627
我只希望盡量多的除掉一些
讓自己能夠
. . .but l've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my. . .

440
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:54,638
- 早點退休
- 我不懂
-. . .retirement.
-l don't understand.

441
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:58,807
我就是在自殺，安吉拉
l'm a suicide, Angela.

442
00:52:58,978 --> 00:53:02,513
當我死的時候，按照規則
我只有一個地方可去
When l die, the rules say
l've got just one place to go.

443
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,730
你是在積德，希望能進天堂
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

444
00:53:04,901 --> 00:53:07,439
要是你被關進一個
半數犯人都是你親手抓進去的監獄里
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison. . .

445
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:09,937
你會有什么感覺？
. . .where half the inmates
were put there by you?

446
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:14,863
我想上帝為我們每個人都安排好了一切
l guess God has a plan for all of us.

447
00:53:15,286 --> 00:53:18,406
小姐
上帝只是一個玩螞蟻的小孩
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

448
00:53:18,581 --> 00:53:20,621
他什么都沒安排
He's not planning anything.

449
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,993
在我們小的時候
When we were little. . .

450
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:26,577
伊莎貝爾也能看到東西
. . .lsabel saw things too.

451
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:33,422
道森
Dodson.

452
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:39,515
警衛發現他在摸弄尸体
然后他倉皇跑到街對面
Guard spotted him groping the body,
then he ran across the street.

453
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:42,770
跑進店里來
把貨架上的酒打開喝了個遍
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

454
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:46,189
不到一分鐘
他就溺死在酒里了
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

455
00:53:46,776 --> 00:53:49,397
本可以成為我們教友會的一員的
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

456
00:53:51,864 --> 00:53:53,822
他跑到這儿來干什么？
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

457
00:53:54,117 --> 00:53:55,611
沒關系
He's okay.

458
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:08,704
為什么不給我打電話
狗娘養的
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

459
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:45,082
喂？
Yes?

460
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,870
什么意思？
What do you mean?

461
00:54:48,796 --> 00:54:50,291
什么？
What?

462
00:54:50,465 --> 00:54:52,007
怎么會？
How?

463
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,639
知道了，拜拜
Got it. Bye.

464
00:55:13,154 --> 00:55:16,155
我要看一下伊莎貝爾死亡的現場
l need to see where lsabel died.

465
00:55:16,324 --> 00:55:19,491
請神，占卜，通靈
Seances, Ouija boards, channeling.

466
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:23,702
父親以為她只是想引人注意
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

467
00:55:23,956 --> 00:55:26,412
可事實上不是
She certainly did that.

468
00:55:26,626 --> 00:55:30,125
她把她看到的東西告訴每一個人
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

469
00:55:30,296 --> 00:55:33,997
把母親嚇得半死
She'd scare my mother half to death.

470
00:55:35,802 --> 00:55:38,471
之后几乎一年
她始終一言不發
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

471
00:55:38,638 --> 00:55:40,880
所以你們把她送到這儿來了
So you had her committed.

472
00:55:41,057 --> 00:55:42,385
是的
Yeah.

473
00:55:42,558 --> 00:55:44,218
有多長時間了？
How long?

474
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:46,310
兩個星期
Two weeks.

475
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:48,556
這一次
This time.

476
00:55:48,731 --> 00:55:53,310
她的病情時好時坏
最近又惡化了
She'd get better, and then she'd
get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

477
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:58,939
那個死者手掌上刻的符號
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand. . .

478
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:01,405
會不會和這有關？
. . .does it have something to do
with this?

479
00:56:01,744 --> 00:56:03,986
約翰，別忘了我是警察
l'm a cop, John, remember?

480
00:56:04,163 --> 00:56:09,121
一個人不可能什么都沒留下
就這么跳樓自殺的
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

481
00:56:09,293 --> 00:56:14,169
而我已經把她所有的遺物都給你看過了
不過你盡管找
And l showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

482
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,679
也許她留下了一些
警察找不到的東西
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

483
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,007
一些只有你才能找到的東西
Something just for you.

484
00:56:24,517 --> 00:56:28,729
你們是雙胞胎，安吉拉
雙胞胎的想法是相似的
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

485
00:56:28,896 --> 00:56:32,230
- 我不像我的妹妹
- 但你曾經是的
-l'm not like my sister.
-But you were once.

486
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,606
當你們還是孩子的時候
When you were kids.

487
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:37,696
當你們每時每刻形影不离的時候
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

488
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:41,612
你說一句，她就能接下句
你受傷了，她就會哭
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

489
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:43,243
那是很久以前了
That was a long time ago.

490
00:56:43,411 --> 00:56:45,368
那种聯系不會這么輕易就消失的
That kind of bond doesn't
just disappear.

491
00:56:45,538 --> 00:56:47,614
這儿什么都沒有
There is nothing here.

492
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:51,374
- 得了吧
- 她在這間屋子里籌划了自己的死
-Hey. Come on.
-She planned her death in this room.

493
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:54,960
她是在這儿想出來的
就在你所站的地方
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

494
00:56:55,131 --> 00:56:58,381
她知道你會來
她指望你能見她所見
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw. . .

495
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:01,587
感她所感
知她所知
. . .feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

496
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:04,593
- 安吉拉，她做了什么？
- 我怎么會知道？
-What did she do, Angela?
-How should l know?

497
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:07,173
- 安吉拉，她做了什么？
- 我不知道
-What did she do, Angela?
-l don't know.

498
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:11,681
- 換了你會怎么做？
- 我不知道
-What would you do?
-l don't know.

499
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:16,601
安吉拉，她做了什么？
你知道的，她到底做了什么？
What did she do, Angela? You know
what she did. What did she do, Angela?

500
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:20,063
你知道的！
你為什么不敢說？她做了什么？
You know what she did. What are
you afraid of? What did she do?

501
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:22,565
- 她做了什么？
- 我不知道！
-What did she do?
-l don't know!

502
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:42,466
我們小的時候
When we were girls. . .

503
00:57:45,431 --> 00:57:48,266
喜歡互相給對方留密信
. . .we would leave each other messages.

504
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:52,811
用光
ln light.

505
00:57:55,441 --> 00:57:57,233
或者在窗戶上
ln breath.

506
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:03,114
用嘴哈气
On the windows.

507
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:10,694
約翰，歌林多書中沒有17章啊
John, there is no 1 7th act
in Corinthians.

508
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:16,624
地獄圣經里，歌林多書有21章
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

509
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:19,963
地獄里也有圣經
They have Bibles in hell.

510
00:58:20,508 --> 00:58:22,999
描繪了另一幅“啟示錄”
Paints a different view of Revelations.

511
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:25,300
地獄圣經中說
世界不會在上帝的手中終結
Says the world will not end
by God's hand...

512
00:58:25,471 --> 00:58:28,472
而是會在黑暗中重生
...but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.

513
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:30,135
到那時……
Though if you ask me...

514
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:32,725
就是人間煉獄了
. . .fire's fire.

515
00:58:32,895 --> 00:58:37,142
16章29節，16章30節
1 6:29, 1 6:30.

516
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,350
哦，天哪
果然不妙
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

517
00:58:41,529 --> 00:58:45,396
“子之罪定會超越父之罪”
''The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son. ''

518
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:49,527
- 誰的儿子？
- 但是他不可能逾越結界
-Whose son?
-But he can't cross over, B.

519
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:52,325
- 結界是不可能逾越的
- 誰的儿子？上帝的儿子？
-lmpossible to cross over.
-Whose son? God's son?

520
00:58:52,498 --> 00:58:55,950
不，是另一個
魔鬼也有儿子
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

521
00:58:56,252 --> 00:58:57,830
在這儿
Here it is.

522
00:58:58,004 --> 00:59:00,043
這是魔鬼之子曼蒙的標志
This is the sign of Mammon. . .

523
00:59:00,214 --> 00:59:04,675
哦等一下，這儿說……
. . .the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here--

524
00:59:05,178 --> 00:59:07,336
- 比曼？
- 在
-Beeman?
-Yeah.

525
00:59:07,513 --> 00:59:10,514
抱歉，我……
抱歉，不，我在
Sorry, l'm--
l'm sorry, no, l'm right here.

526
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:17,271
上面說曼蒙對他父親的規矩不耐煩了
lt says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule. . .

527
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,359
渴望建立一個屬于他自己的
火与血的王國
. . .and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

528
00:59:28,284 --> 00:59:30,692
沒錯，曼蒙是我們最不愿意見到
Yeah. Mammon would be
the last demon. . .

529
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,741
出現在我們世界里的魔鬼
. . .we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

530
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:37,533
等等，等等，听我讀下去
可是似乎存在某种漏洞
No, wait, wait, wait. l'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

531
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:40,035
就知道沒那么簡單
Always a catch.

532
00:59:40,463 --> 00:59:46,751
這里說到
曼蒙首先要附身于一個非常強大的通靈者
lt says first Mammon would have to
possess a very, very powerful psychic.

533
00:59:46,928 --> 00:59:49,549
- 伊莎貝爾
- 但這還不夠
-lsabel.
-But that wouldn 't be enough.

534
00:59:50,306 --> 00:59:54,767
要穿越結界
曼蒙還需要神的協助
To cross over, Mammon would need
divine assistance.

535
00:59:56,187 --> 01:00:00,351
也就是說需要上帝的幫助
To cross over, Mammon would need
the help of God.

536
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:04,318
- 上帝的幫助？
- 上面說……
-The help of God?
-It says--

537
01:00:11,077 --> 01:00:14,576
- 比曼？
- 約翰，听著
-Beeman?
-John, look. . .

538
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:19,243
我知道你從來都沒有什么信念
你從來都不愿意……
. . .l know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to. . .

539
01:00:19,419 --> 01:00:23,167
可這并不意味著你的心里
...but that doesn 't mean
that we don 't have faith...

540
01:00:24,048 --> 01:00:25,792
不存在信念
. . .in you.

541
01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:31,597
比曼？比曼？
Beeman? Beeman?

542
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,631
開快點
Drive. Fast.

543
01:00:50,783 --> 01:00:52,740
比曼！
Beeman!

544
01:00:53,161 --> 01:00:54,869
硫磺
Sulfur.

545
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:57,948
比曼！
Beeman!

546
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:03,836
比曼！
Beeman!

547
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:16,108
不只是伊莎貝爾
Wasn't just lsabel.

548
01:02:17,412 --> 01:02:18,954
我以前也能見到東西
l used to see things too.

549
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,700
可是……
But. . .

550
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:26,743
- 你已經知道了，是不是？
- 回家去，安吉拉
-. . .you already knew that, didn't you?
-Go home, Angela.

551
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:28,380
我要把事情搞清楚
l need to understand.

552
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:31,039
這些事情你最好不要知道
相信我
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

553
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,293
我比伊莎貝爾強
l'm stronger than lsabel.

554
01:02:33,469 --> 01:02:37,419
你的妹妹接受了她的天賦
而你拒絕了，還是拒絕比較好
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours. Denial is a better idea.

555
01:02:37,598 --> 01:02:42,391
這也是為什么你還活著的原因
如果你繼續跟著我，就難說了
lt's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

556
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,519
我不想再多個鬼魂跟著我
l don't need another ghost
following me.

557
01:02:44,689 --> 01:02:47,227
約翰，他們殺了我妹妹！
John, they killed my sister.

558
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:53,895
我宁愿死的那個是我
l'd trade places with her if l could.

559
01:02:57,118 --> 01:02:59,739
我過去一直假裝自己沒有這种能力
l used to pretend that l didn't.

560
01:03:00,413 --> 01:03:02,821
什么都看不見
That l didn't see things.

561
01:03:03,207 --> 01:03:04,785
然后
And. . .

562
01:03:05,918 --> 01:03:10,248
到我們10歲的時候
父母開始強迫她吃安定藥
. . .by the time we were 1 0,
they started forcing her to take. . .

563
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,081
并且接受治療
. . .antipsychotics. . .

564
01:03:14,093 --> 01:03:16,465
當那些東西出現的時候
. . .and have treatments.
They would come for her. . .

565
01:03:16,638 --> 01:03:20,386
她總是看著我
對我說：“告訴他們啊”
. . .and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, ''Tell them.

566
01:03:20,558 --> 01:03:24,390
“安吉，為什么你不告訴他們
你也能看見？”
Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?''

567
01:03:25,563 --> 01:03:26,892
可我卻撒了謊
But l lied.

568
01:03:27,774 --> 01:03:29,766
我說：
l said:

569
01:03:31,277 --> 01:03:33,602
“我什么都沒看見”
''l don't see anything. ''

570
01:03:34,572 --> 01:03:36,778
直到有一天
Until one day. . .

571
01:03:37,742 --> 01:03:39,366
我終于真的看不見了
. . .l finally stopped seeing.

572
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:44,285
我拋棄了她，約翰
l abandoned her, John.

573
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:47,580
我讓她孤立無援
l left her all alone.

574
01:03:54,801 --> 01:03:57,126
我必須得看到她所看到的東西
l need to see what she saw.

575
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:00,679
請你幫幫我
Please.

576
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:08,762
這么做，可就沒法回頭了
You do this, there's no turning back.

577
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:12,642
你看見了他們
You see them. . .

578
01:04:13,653 --> 01:04:15,480
他們也看見了你
. . .they see you.

579
01:04:16,364 --> 01:04:18,357
明白嗎？
Understand?

580
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,825
明白
Yeah.

581
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,833
好吧
Sure.

582
01:05:07,373 --> 01:05:11,869
我必須把所有的衣服都脫了么？
還是可以穿著？
So do l have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can l leave them on?

583
01:05:18,301 --> 01:05:19,961
約翰？
John?

584
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:22,212
我在考慮
l'm thinking.

585
01:05:26,225 --> 01:05:27,850
約翰？
John?

586
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:30,512
穿著吧
On is fine.

587
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:46,700
- 為什么用水？
- 水是万能的通道
-So why water?
-lt's a universal conduit.

588
01:05:47,121 --> 01:05:50,905
可以幫助穿越結界
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

589
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:55,377
- 接著問我地獄里有沒有水
- 地獄里有沒有水？
-Now ask me if there's water in hell.
-ls there water in hell?

590
01:05:57,173 --> 01:05:58,632
坐下
Sit.

591
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:04,256
通常只要身体的一部分浸入水中就可以了
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended. . .

592
01:06:06,933 --> 01:06:08,890
但是你想來個速成的
. . .but you wanted the crash course.

593
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,765
是的，我要速成的
Yeah, l wanted the crash course.

594
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,019
那么……
So. . . .

595
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,480
那會怎么樣？
So, what's gonna happen?

596
01:06:16,651 --> 01:06:18,311
躺下
Lie down.

597
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:22,437
- 躺下？什么意思？
- 你必須完全浸入水中
-What do you mean lie down?
-You have to be fully submerged.

598
01:06:24,534 --> 01:06:25,945
要多長時間？
For how long?

599
01:06:26,661 --> 01:06:28,404
能堅持多久就多久
As long as it takes.

600
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:40,624
深吸一口气
Take a deep one.

601
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:25,192
哦，上帝
Oh, God.

602
01:08:25,863 --> 01:08:28,983
哦，上帝，所有這些人
Oh, God, all those people.

603
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:32,032
哦，伊莎貝爾
Oh, lsabel.

604
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:33,823
我總是知道
l've always known.

605
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:38,542
我總是知道它們在哪儿
我總是知道如何找到它們
l've always known where they are.
l've always known where to find them. . .

606
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:41,829
朝哪儿瞄准，在哪儿躲避
. . .where to aim and where to duck. . .

607
01:08:42,005 --> 01:08:43,914
我總是知道它們在哪儿
. . .and l've always known
where they were.

608
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,129
我知道那不是運气
l've always known that it wasn't luck.

609
01:08:46,301 --> 01:08:48,922
我知道那不是運气
我一直都知道……
Always known that it wasn't luck.
l've always known. . . .

610
01:08:49,095 --> 01:08:52,262
我一直都知道我能看見
l've always known that l could see.

611
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:57,770
我一直都知道我能看見
l've always known that l could see.

612
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:04,394
安吉拉
Angela.

613
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:10,606
有人來過
Someone was here.

614
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:38,518
那是他留下的
lt was his.

615
01:09:39,812 --> 01:09:41,686
轉動著
Rolling.

616
01:09:43,775 --> 01:09:45,684
不是球
Not a ball.

617
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:49,314
是某种小一點的東西
Something smaller.

618
01:09:52,116 --> 01:09:53,741
閃著光
Shiny.

619
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:28,814
巴爾薩澤
Balthazar.

620
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,685
對不起
Sorry.

621
01:11:09,902 --> 01:11:12,061
要殺了他嗎？？
Can you just kill him?

622
01:11:13,031 --> 01:11:14,359
那平衡怎么辦？
What about the balance?

623
01:11:14,532 --> 01:11:18,197
當這些雜种開始殺我朋友的時候
平衡就已經被破坏了
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

624
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:20,825
我只是在天平的另一邊加些砝碼而已
l'm just adding some counterweight.

625
01:11:54,656 --> 01:11:56,778
約翰，我真的很想……
John, l really want--

626
01:12:02,872 --> 01:12:05,956
把它當作防彈衣
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

627
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:15,672
我要和你一起去
l'm coming with you.

628
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:19,467
你得呆在車里
You're staying in the car.

629
01:12:43,788 --> 01:12:46,742
火？我就是火里生的
Fire? l was born of this.

630
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:51,454
你這個爛雜种，告訴我
曼蒙到底要怎樣跨越結界？
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

631
01:12:55,466 --> 01:12:58,918
這樣更好，更自然
That's better. Au naturel.

632
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,267
“呆在車里”
''Stay in the car. ''

633
01:13:08,438 --> 01:13:10,810
“在這儿等”
''Wait here. ''

634
01:13:11,524 --> 01:13:12,852
受不了你
Men.

635
01:13:26,581 --> 01:13:27,992
別抗拒，小約翰
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

636
01:13:29,584 --> 01:13:31,576
好好享受
Enjoy it.

637
01:14:05,036 --> 01:14:08,820
我們馬上就能見到你了
We'll see you very soon.

638
01:14:09,248 --> 01:14:11,075
你說錯了
Not really, no.

639
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:16,411
這回你跑不掉的
你會回到地獄里去
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

640
01:14:16,589 --> 01:14:18,083
沒錯
True.

641
01:14:18,257 --> 01:14:19,586
可你卻回不去了
But you're not.

642
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:24,048
- 你要干嘛？
- 我要給你做最后的超度
-What are you doing?
-l'm reading you your last rites.

643
01:14:24,222 --> 01:14:27,887
別對我用治療咒語
Spare me your remedial incantations.

644
01:14:28,059 --> 01:14:30,384
你想知道真正被寬恕以后
會是什么樣嗎？
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

645
01:14:30,561 --> 01:14:33,099
被接納進入神的王國
To be welcomed
into the Kingdom of God.

646
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,683
天堂里的魔鬼
Demon in heaven.

647
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:39,313
真想看看那時的情景
l'd love to be a fly on that wall.

648
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,734
你不是牧師，你沒有法力
You're not a priest. You have no power.

649
01:14:45,118 --> 01:14:47,110
那你告訴我曼蒙打算怎樣沖破結界
Just tell me how Mammon
is crossing over. . .

650
01:14:47,286 --> 01:14:50,371
我就讓你滾回你的狗窩去
. . .and you can go back
to your shithole.

651
01:14:53,126 --> 01:14:56,577
好啊，不說是吧
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

652
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:11,682
“愿主怜憫你，饒恕你所有的罪孽”
''May God have mercy on you
and grant you the pardon of all your sins.

653
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:16,683
“不管犯下什么樣的罪孽
都饒恕你，讓你升入天堂”
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in heaven. ''

654
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,433
- 快說，他要怎樣沖破結界？
- 不
-How? How's he doing it?
-No.

655
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:22,941
不，我不能說
No, l can't.

656
01:15:24,824 --> 01:15:28,158
“讓你的子民找到通往天國的大門……”
Grant your child entry
into thy kingdom. . .

657
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:33,786
“以圣父、圣子和圣靈之名”
. . .in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

658
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:36,000
阿門！
Amen!

659
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:42,125
上帝的血
The blood of God.

660
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,628
他找到了
He found it.

661
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:48,055
只要殺死了上帝之子
Whatever killed the son of God. . .

662
01:15:48,222 --> 01:15:53,762
就能讓魔鬼之子复活
. . .will give birth to the son of the devil.

663
01:15:55,897 --> 01:15:57,724
順便說一句
By the way. . .

664
01:15:59,734 --> 01:16:03,648
只有經過赦免才能得到寬恕
. . .you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven. . .

665
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:05,811
笨蛋
. . .asshole.

666
01:16:09,744 --> 01:16:13,195
我的任務已經完成了
My work here is done.

667
01:16:14,582 --> 01:16:19,410
- 你笑什么？
- 我的任務就是她
-What are you laughing at?
-She was my only mission. . .

668
01:16:19,587 --> 01:16:23,799
而你正好把她帶來了
. . .and you brought her right to us.

669
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:30,095
干嘛走這么快
是不是發現了什么？
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

670
01:16:30,264 --> 01:16:34,558
耶穌不是在十字架上被釘死的
而是被一個戰士的矛刺死的
Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a
cross. He was killed by a soldier's spear.

671
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:36,886
命運之矛
The Spear of Destiny.

672
01:16:37,313 --> 01:16:40,018
我是個天主教徒，約翰
我知道耶穌受難的故事
l'm a Catholic, John.
l know the Crucifixion story.

673
01:16:48,908 --> 01:16:53,736
按您的吩咐，我引出了她的姐姐
l drew out the sister as you asked.

674
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:59,536
她的靈力已經被喚醒
She's been made flush and ready.

675
01:16:59,711 --> 01:17:03,459
好強的能量
So much power.

676
01:17:03,756 --> 01:17:08,964
如果您能讓我复活
我愿意為您效忠
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
l shall serve.

677
01:17:11,556 --> 01:17:15,091
等等，我們說好的
Wait. But l did as we agreed.

678
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:18,886
不，不！
No. Please. No!

679
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:26,732
比曼說過
曼蒙需要神的幫助才能跨越結界
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

680
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:31,273
看來那就是上帝唯一的儿子的血
How's the blood of God's only son?

681
01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:33,948
矛上的血跡
The stains on the spear.

682
01:17:35,246 --> 01:17:38,117
- 是的
- 那么說他找到了矛
-Yeah.
-So he gets the spear.

683
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:40,449
他還要找一個很強的通靈者
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

684
01:17:41,627 --> 01:17:43,122
已經有了
Not really.

685
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:47,544
雙胞胎
Twins.

686
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:51,129
護身符呢？
Where's the amulet?

687
01:17:52,388 --> 01:17:55,473
我不知道
肯定是落在車上了
l don't know,
l must have left it in the--

688
01:17:57,143 --> 01:17:58,471
怎么了？
What's wrong?

689
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,728
我不知道，只是覺得……
l don't know, l just feel--

690
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:34,303
- 梯子上的鳥
- 抱歉
-Bird on a ladder.
-Sorry.

691
01:18:39,894 --> 01:18:42,053
- 在這儿等
- 好的
-Wait here.
-Yeah.

692
01:18:45,274 --> 01:18:48,192
現在誰是穿裙子的老鼠了？啊？
狗娘養的
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

693
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:04,657
你連最后一點理智都沒了么
Have you lost what little mind you have?

694
01:19:04,919 --> 01:19:06,497
別動
Don't.

695
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,132
我需要用那張椅子
l need to use the chair.

696
01:19:10,299 --> 01:19:14,344
我不會幫任何一邊
l offer no aid to one side or the other.

697
01:19:15,346 --> 01:19:18,098
- 平衡
- 去他媽的平衡
-The balance.
-Screw the balance.

698
01:19:24,188 --> 01:19:26,679
你敢？在我這儿？
You dare? ln my house?

699
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:32,861
這也叫中立嗎？狗屁！
ls this neutral? Bullshit.

700
01:19:33,072 --> 01:19:35,990
米耐，你是唯一一個還在按規矩做的人！
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

701
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,907
當你保持中立的時候
人們卻在死去
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

702
01:19:40,413 --> 01:19:44,493
亨尼斯，比曼，他們曾經都是你的朋友
你不記得了么？
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once too, remember?

703
01:19:45,585 --> 01:19:48,290
我需要你的幫助！
l need your help!

704
01:19:50,423 --> 01:19:52,961
就當是最后的請求
Consider it a last request.

705
01:19:56,763 --> 01:19:59,598
你太冒險了
You play a dangerous game.

706
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:08,765
這件襯衫可要200美元
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

707
01:20:10,777 --> 01:20:15,439
那個小畜牲早就想走出
他父親的陰影了
That little shit has been trying to climb
out of his father's shadow for eons.

708
01:20:15,615 --> 01:20:20,526
不敢想象要是他沖破結界的話
世界會變成什么樣
l'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

709
01:20:23,623 --> 01:20:25,995
都忘了它有這么大
Forgot how big it was.

710
01:20:26,376 --> 01:20:30,788
在紐約新新監獄里
這張椅子曾經拷問了200個靈魂
Two hundred souls passed through
this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

711
01:20:30,963 --> 01:20:32,623
是的
Yeah.

712
01:20:35,843 --> 01:20:38,002
哪邊是東？
Which way's east?

713
01:20:55,822 --> 01:20:58,491
多久沒沖浪了？
How many years since you've surfed?

714
01:20:59,742 --> 01:21:01,699
就像騎自行車
Like riding a bike.

715
01:21:01,869 --> 01:21:03,862
沒那么輕松
No, not really.

716
01:21:06,582 --> 01:21:09,370
希望這不是為了那女孩
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

717
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:14,917
絕對主要不是為了那女孩
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

718
01:21:21,306 --> 01:21:22,716
好冷
Cold.

719
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:25,013
來一口？
Little flavor?

720
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:50,409
- 准備好了？
- 不
-Sure about this?
-No.

721
01:22:40,593 --> 01:22:42,253
米耐！
Midnite!

722
01:22:47,976 --> 01:22:51,095
- 找到了么？
- 找到了
-Any luck?
-That's a word for it.

723
01:22:51,437 --> 01:22:54,853
老天，這不是米耐老爹嗎？
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

724
01:23:02,615 --> 01:23:06,992
你到底打算怎么用這些？
要离得很近才行
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

725
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,247
她的周圍肯定有人守衛
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

726
01:23:12,417 --> 01:23:14,077
當雜种的外皮被圣水澆裂之后
Half-breeds are most vulnerable. . .

727
01:23:14,252 --> 01:23:18,202
他們是非常脆弱的
. . .when their outer skin is breached
by holy water.

728
01:23:18,673 --> 01:23:22,006
可以用某些圣物
特別是伊斯塔利亞十字架
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of lsteria. . .

729
01:23:22,176 --> 01:23:24,667
即使是沒有正式受命的牧師
也可以用它來把……
. . .have been used by even
the unordained to bless. . .

730
01:23:24,846 --> 01:23:26,719
普通的水……
. . .commonly occurring waters. . .

731
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:28,633
甚至是雨水，變成圣水
. . .even rain.

732
01:23:29,183 --> 01:23:30,559
也許如果……
Maybe if. . . .

733
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:38,641
如果沒有為比賽做好准備
干坐在候補席上也是沒用的，對嗎？
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

734
01:23:38,818 --> 01:23:42,685
我們為什么不從櫥柜里
拿一支施有魔法的十字架
You wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet. . .

735
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:44,940
帶在身上用呢？
. . .maybe we could take with us?

736
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:49,654
約翰，我無意冒犯
我只是提點建議，我覺得……
Look, John, no offense, l just don't think
that it's a great idea, you know. . .

737
01:23:49,829 --> 01:23:53,163
你這樣單槍匹馬去拯救世界
這么做并不聰明
. . .you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

738
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:56,002
我不知道他怎么想
可是……
l don't know what pops thinks,
but that's--

739
01:23:57,337 --> 01:24:00,373
把他帶上吧，約翰
完事之后再把他殺了
Take him, John. Kill him after.

740
01:24:05,511 --> 01:24:09,805
如果你能回來
來找我，或許我能讓你成為會員
lf you get back, see me
about membership. Maybe.

741
01:24:09,974 --> 01:24:12,892
好的，我會的
Okay. l will.

742
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:19,937
- 你在干嘛？
- 祈禱
-What are you doing?
-Praying.

743
01:24:20,109 --> 01:24:23,063
祈禱，好吧
Praying. Okay.

744
01:24:23,988 --> 01:24:25,648
來吧
Come on.

745
01:25:22,672 --> 01:25:24,214
雜种，對嗎？
Half-breeds, right?

746
01:25:27,093 --> 01:25:31,589
他們肯定守護著她，對嗎？
肯定是的
A birth like this, they're definitely
gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

747
01:25:32,015 --> 01:25:33,509
對
Yeah.

748
01:25:36,519 --> 01:25:41,015
我們能夠解決他們
我是說，十字架會起作用的，對嗎？
We can get through them. l mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

749
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:42,851
對嗎？
Right?

750
01:25:43,192 --> 01:25:46,561
現實和書本不完全一樣
lt's not always like it is in the books.

751
01:26:34,952 --> 01:26:36,696
那是什么？
What is that?

752
01:26:37,205 --> 01:26:39,197
地獄的聲音
Hellspeak.

753
01:26:41,834 --> 01:26:43,910
你知道該怎么做了
You know what to do.

754
01:26:47,173 --> 01:26:48,833
沒問題
l'm okay.

755
01:26:50,677 --> 01:26:52,420
好的
Sure.

756
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:06,853
最后一次演出
One last show.

757
01:27:40,768 --> 01:27:42,393
嗨
Hi.

758
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:44,307
我的名字叫約翰
My name's John.

759
01:27:46,566 --> 01:27:50,065
你們破坏了平衡
You are in violation of the balance.

760
01:27:50,903 --> 01:27:53,276
立刻离開
Leave immediately. . .

761
01:27:53,573 --> 01:27:56,242
否則，我將把你們驅逐
. . .or l will deport you.

762
01:27:58,202 --> 01:28:00,029
你們所有的人
All of you.

763
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:09,329
去死吧
Go to hell.

764
01:28:14,969 --> 01:28:16,428
圣水？
Holy water?

765
01:29:34,132 --> 01:29:36,338
安吉拉
Angela.

766
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:10,291
約翰？
John?

767
01:30:12,587 --> 01:30:13,915
約翰
John.

768
01:30:19,677 --> 01:30:21,219
媽的
Shit.

769
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:47,954
拉住！
Pull!

770
01:31:28,871 --> 01:31:30,200
安吉拉
Angela.

771
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:55,853
安吉拉，怎么了？
Angela, what is it?

772
01:32:02,572 --> 01:32:04,861
把它赶出來
Get it out.

773
01:32:18,338 --> 01:32:19,880
把它赶出來
Get it out.

774
01:32:20,465 --> 01:32:22,504
把它……
Get it--

775
01:33:06,469 --> 01:33:07,797
哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

776
01:33:15,061 --> 01:33:16,639
干得不賴，孩子
Not bad, kid.

777
01:33:19,649 --> 01:33:21,641
“干得不賴”
你听到了嗎？
''Not bad. '' You hear that?

778
01:33:21,818 --> 01:33:26,230
知道為什么嗎？因為我是克萊默
查斯·克萊默，混……
You know why that is? lt's because
this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, ass--

779
01:33:34,122 --> 01:33:36,031
查斯
Chas.

780
01:33:44,048 --> 01:33:46,622
你說得沒錯，約翰
You're right, John.

781
01:33:47,885 --> 01:33:49,593
和書上不一樣
lt's not like the books.

782
01:33:50,763 --> 01:33:52,423
不……
No. . .

783
01:33:53,349 --> 01:33:55,176
不一樣
. . .it isn't.

784
01:34:16,122 --> 01:34:18,909
現身吧，我命令你
lnto the light, l command thee.

785
01:34:19,959 --> 01:34:23,411
現身吧，我命令你
lnto the light, l command thee.

786
01:34:24,547 --> 01:34:28,675
現身吧，我命令你
lnto the light, l command thee.

787
01:34:33,222 --> 01:34:36,841
現身吧，我命令你
lnto the light, l command thee.

788
01:34:40,063 --> 01:34:42,933
你的能量令我吃惊
Your ego is astounding.

789
01:34:43,107 --> 01:34:44,899
加百列
Gabriel.

790
01:34:45,068 --> 01:34:46,396
不出所料
Figures.

791
01:34:47,612 --> 01:34:51,028
邪惡將接管地球
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

792
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,606
你是在審判我嗎？約翰
You judging me now, John?

793
01:34:54,869 --> 01:34:58,867
背叛，謀殺，种族滅絕
卻說我狹隘
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

794
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,990
我只是想喚醒人類
讓他們看到后果
l am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

795
01:35:03,419 --> 01:35:07,084
通過把地球拱手讓給惡魔之子？
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

796
01:35:07,799 --> 01:35:09,127
殺了我吧
Help me here.

797
01:35:13,179 --> 01:35:17,473
你被賦予了這种寶貴的天賦，對嗎？
You're handed this precious gift, right?

798
01:35:18,685 --> 01:35:22,729
造物主允許你們每個人贖罪
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

799
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:26,269
殺人犯，強奸犯，性騷扰……
Murderers, rapists and molesters. . .

800
01:35:26,442 --> 01:35:28,768
你們所有這些人
只要忏悔
. . .all of you, you just have to repent. . .

801
01:35:28,945 --> 01:35:31,780
上帝就會伸出雙手迎接你們
. . .and God takes you into his bosom.

802
01:35:34,117 --> 01:35:36,358
茫茫宇宙，大千世界
ln all the worlds in all the universe. . .

803
01:35:36,536 --> 01:35:39,453
除了人類以外
沒有哪种生物能以此為傲
. . .no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

804
01:35:41,916 --> 01:35:43,245
這不公平
lt's not fair.

805
01:35:47,422 --> 01:35:51,371
如果好心的上帝這么愛你們
lf sweet, sweet God loves you so. . .

806
01:35:51,551 --> 01:35:54,552
那我就要讓你們值得被他愛
. . .then l'll make you worthy of his love.

807
01:35:56,222 --> 01:35:59,342
我盯著你很久了
l've been watching you for a long time.

808
01:35:59,517 --> 01:36:04,179
只有面對恐懼的時候
你才能真正找到你高貴的自我
lt's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

809
01:36:04,355 --> 01:36:08,187
你才能變得那么的高貴
And you can be so noble.

810
01:36:10,903 --> 01:36:12,481
因此
So. . .

811
01:36:13,156 --> 01:36:15,481
我要給你帶來痛苦
. . .l'll bring you pain.

812
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,531
帶來恐懼
l'll bring you horror.

813
01:36:20,246 --> 01:36:23,330
這樣你才能戰胜它們
So that you may rise above it.

814
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:30,709
這樣，那些從人間地獄中存活下來的人
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth. . .

815
01:36:30,882 --> 01:36:33,836
才值得擁有上帝的愛
. . .will be worthy of God's love.

816
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:35,801
加百列
Gabriel. . .

817
01:36:36,262 --> 01:36:38,504
你瘋了
. . .you're insane.

818
01:36:40,433 --> 01:36:43,636
拯救將在今晚展開
The road to salvation begins tonight.

819
01:36:44,437 --> 01:36:46,145
就現在
Right now.

820
01:37:27,814 --> 01:37:30,815
我知道你不喜歡我
l know l'm not one of your favorites.

821
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,112
你甚至不歡迎我進你的家門
l'm not even welcome in your house.

822
01:37:36,698 --> 01:37:39,533
我能引起你些許的注意嗎？
But l could use a little attention.

823
01:37:42,829 --> 01:37:44,537
懇求你
Please.

824
01:38:30,918 --> 01:38:33,291
來吧
Come forth.

825
01:38:53,066 --> 01:38:54,939
快點
Hurry.

826
01:39:12,168 --> 01:39:14,042
曼蒙……
Mammon. . .

827
01:39:14,212 --> 01:39:16,667
撒旦之子
. . .son of Satan. . .

828
01:39:16,839 --> 01:39:21,300
我來把你放入這個世界
. . .l unleash you unto this world.

829
01:40:15,064 --> 01:40:16,393
路
Lu.

830
01:40:16,566 --> 01:40:18,642
為什么這么久才來
What took you so long?

831
01:40:18,818 --> 01:40:21,107
你好，約翰
Hello, John.

832
01:40:21,821 --> 01:40:25,155
你好，約翰
John, hello.

833
01:40:29,996 --> 01:40:32,950
你的靈魂
You're the one soul. . .

834
01:40:33,333 --> 01:40:36,951
我是一定要親自來收的
. . .l would come up here
to collect myself.

835
01:40:40,298 --> 01:40:42,670
我听說了
So l've heard.

836
01:40:43,426 --> 01:40:44,754
不介意吧？
You mind?

837
01:40:45,803 --> 01:40:48,176
哦，可以，隨意
我有時間
Oh, go-- Go right ahead. l've got stock.

838
01:40:49,182 --> 01:40:50,593
香煙
Coffin nail.

839
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:52,974
和你很配，約翰
Very fitting, John.

840
01:40:55,855 --> 01:40:59,390
知道嗎，割得太深會割斷肌腱
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons. . .

841
01:40:59,567 --> 01:41:02,354
手指就不听使喚了
. . .finger movement goes
out the window.

842
01:41:02,528 --> 01:41:04,604
我來幫你
Let me help you.

843
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,578
看到了嗎？
See?

844
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:20,831
小寶貝……
Sonny. . .

845
01:41:21,005 --> 01:41:26,130
我為你准備了一整座主題公園
讓你好好快活
. . .l've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

846
01:41:26,886 --> 01:41:28,428
哦，你真好
Well, aren't you a peach.

847
01:41:30,223 --> 01:41:34,055
我想，你不會再犯同樣的錯誤了吧
l didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

848
01:41:38,898 --> 01:41:40,855
你不會的
And you didn't. . .

849
01:41:41,609 --> 01:41:43,353
是不是？
. . .did you?

850
01:41:43,653 --> 01:41:45,277
你家里都好嗎？
So how's the family?

851
01:41:45,446 --> 01:41:51,401
很好
忙得要命，需要休個假了
Family's doing just fine.
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

852
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:55,244
听說你的孩子和你一個脾气
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

853
01:41:55,415 --> 01:41:58,451
是啊，個頂個的棒
Well, one does what one can.

854
01:41:58,626 --> 01:42:00,251
他就在隔壁
He's in the other room.

855
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:03,207
男孩就是男孩
Boys will be boys.

856
01:42:04,424 --> 01:42:05,752
和加百列在一起
With Gabriel.

857
01:42:08,594 --> 01:42:11,382
有些愛好真的沒法解釋
No accounting for taste, really.

858
01:42:11,764 --> 01:42:14,172
他們拿著命運之矛
They have the Spear of Destiny.

859
01:42:16,936 --> 01:42:20,637
“他們拿著命運之矛”
''They have the Spear of Destiny. ''

860
01:42:28,948 --> 01:42:32,151
又想和我玩什么花樣？
Or is it another one of your cons?

861
01:42:34,245 --> 01:42:36,534
你自己去看
Go look for yourself.

862
01:42:39,584 --> 01:42:43,202
路，你已經等了我20年
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu. . .

863
01:42:43,588 --> 01:42:46,624
再等20秒又何妨？
. . .what's another 20 seconds?

864
01:43:51,364 --> 01:43:56,571
- 路西法
- 這個世界是我的，幸虧及時赶到
-Lucifer.
-This world is mine. ln time.

865
01:43:56,744 --> 01:43:59,318
你，加百列
作為我們之中最棒的
You, best of all of us, Gabriel. . .

866
01:43:59,497 --> 01:44:04,704
居然也這么有野心
. . .should understand ambition.

867
01:44:04,877 --> 01:44:07,368
毀滅之子
Son of perdition.

868
01:44:08,256 --> 01:44:09,584
小喇叭
Little horn.

869
01:44:11,718 --> 01:44:13,924
最邪惡的人
Most unclean.

870
01:44:14,095 --> 01:44:16,716
真怀念這些舊時的稱呼
l do miss the old names.

871
01:44:17,598 --> 01:44:19,805
該回家了，儿子
Time to go home, son.

872
01:44:19,976 --> 01:44:22,431
我要替上帝
l will smite thee. . .

873
01:44:22,603 --> 01:44:25,521
懲罰你
. . .in his honor.

874
01:44:30,653 --> 01:44:35,778
好像某人不再支持你了
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

875
01:44:53,593 --> 01:44:55,420
父親？
Father?

876
01:45:18,826 --> 01:45:20,237
那么
So.

877
01:45:27,251 --> 01:45:28,580
那么什么
So.

878
01:45:28,961 --> 01:45:32,710
好了，你想要什么？
再給你延期？
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

879
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:39,463
她的妹妹
The sister. . .

880
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:41,718
伊莎貝爾
. . .lsabel.

881
01:45:43,643 --> 01:45:45,552
她怎么了？
What about her?

882
01:45:47,563 --> 01:45:49,971
讓她回家
Let her go home.

883
01:45:52,694 --> 01:45:57,272
你愿意放棄你的生命
讓她升入天堂？
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

884
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:10,119
好的，可以
Fine. lt's done.

885
01:46:12,755 --> 01:46:16,207
該走了，約翰

獻身
The sacrifice.

888

不，這個人屬于我
No. This one belongs to me.

889
01:47:45,598 --> 01:47:51,434
不，你要活著，約翰·康斯坦丁
No. You will live, John Constantine.

890
01:47:54,524 --> 01:47:55,935

891
01:47:58,528 --> 01:48:00,983
這樣你才……
So you will have. . .

892
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:05,320
有机會證明
. . .the chance to prove. . .

893
01:48:07,954 --> 01:48:13,328
你的靈魂是屬于地獄的
. . .that your soul truly belongs in hell.

894
01:48:16,379 --> 01:48:19,463
哦，你要活著

謝謝你

沒關系
No problem.

898
01:50:03,903 --> 01:50:05,647
人類
Human.

899
01:50:07,573 --> 01:50:10,111
你不應該成為人類
You don't deserve to be human.

900
01:50:11,619 --> 01:50:16,328
你想報仇嗎？
你現在是這么想的嗎？
Do you want revenge?

901
01:50:18,793 --> 01:50:20,371

替上帝動手吧
Be the hand of God.

907

這是你的選擇

一直都是你的選擇
lt's always been your choice.

909
01:50:45,528 --> 01:50:46,939
好吧
Yeah.

910
01:50:52,618 --> 01:50:54,991
這叫做痛
That's called pain.

911
01:50:55,163 --> 01:50:56,538
學著習慣吧
Get used to it.

912
01:51:02,962 --> 01:51:05,121
你本可以打死我的，約翰！
You could've shot me, John!

913
01:51:07,258 --> 01:51:10,129
你選擇了積德！
You chose a higher path!

914

看你做得多棒！

景色不錯
Nice spot.

我有東西要給你
l have something for you.

917
01:51:50,718 --> 01:51:53,470
這樣東西讓我知道
你不是那种華而不實的人
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

918
01:51:56,516 --> 01:51:59,054
哦，你真聰明
Oh, how thoughtful.

919
01:52:04,357 --> 01:52:06,184
約翰
John. . .

920
01:52:07,652 --> 01:52:09,941
為什么給我這個？
. . .why are you giving me this?

921
01:52:10,113 --> 01:52:11,571
這是規則
Rules.

922
01:52:11,864 --> 01:52:13,359
把它藏起來
Hide it.

923
01:52:13,533 --> 01:52:16,569
藏在一個沒人能找到的地方
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

924
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:19,280
包括我
Not even me.

925
01:52:23,459 --> 01:52:25,251
就知道沒那么簡單
Always a catch.

926
01:52:26,713 --> 01:52:28,290
是啊
Yeah.

927
01:52:41,394 --> 01:52:43,221
那么
So.

928
01:52:44,856 --> 01:52:47,892
我想洗個澡
l've got some cleaning up to do.

929
01:52:51,738 --> 01:52:53,730
我們……
l'll. . .

930
01:52:53,906 --> 01:52:56,195
再見吧
. . .see you around.

931
01:52:58,703 --> 01:53:00,612
好啊
l'd like that.

932
01:53:30,610 --> 01:53:33,480
我想，我們每個人都自有安排
I guess there's a plan for all of us.

933
01:53:33,655 --> 01:53:35,232
我死了兩次
I had to die...

934
01:53:35,406 --> 01:53:36,735
才明白
... twice...

935
01:53:36,908 --> 01:53:39,114
這個道理
...just to figure that out.

936
01:53:39,285 --> 01:53:44,280
就像書上說的，冥冥中自有安排
Like the book says, he works his work
in mysterious ways.

937
01:53:44,457 --> 01:53:46,615
有些人喜歡
Some people like it...

938
01:53:46,793 --> 01:53:49,331
有些人不喜歡
...some people don 't.

939
01:59:42,732 --> 01:59:44,855
你做得很好，孩子
You did good, kid.

940
