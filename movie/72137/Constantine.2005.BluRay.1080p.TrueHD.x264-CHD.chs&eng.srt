00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:36,336
“拥有命运之矛的人将掌握世界的命运”

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,506
命运之矛自从二战之后就下落不明

00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:49,578
（墨西哥）

00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,168
曼纽尔
Manuel.

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,295
曼纽尔！
Manuel!

00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,227
曼纽尔
Manuel.

00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,243
（洛杉矶）

11
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,527
我想……
l think. . . .

12
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,910
我给你找着了一个
l think l found you one.

13
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,496
这次我可是给你打电话了
Look, l called you, right?

14
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,880
我一发现自己搞不定
就马上给你打电话了，约翰
Soon as l couldn't pull it out myself,
l called you, John.

15
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:32,893
别担心，没事的
我们必须得把她绑上，你明白吗？
lt's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

16
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,947
没事的
lt's okay.

17
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,832
我是康斯坦丁
This is Constantine.

18
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:36,130
约翰・康斯坦丁
你这混蛋
John Constantine, asshole.

19
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,635
当然
Sure.

20
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,827
怎么了？
What the hell?

21
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:28,807
我需要一面镜子
l need a mirror.

22
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,100
快去拿！
至少要3英尺高
Now. At least 3 feet high.

23
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:34,944
愣着干嘛，快去拿啊！
Move! Go, now!

24
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,832
我是克雷默
This is Kramer.

25
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,373
查斯・克雷默
你这混蛋
Chas Kramer, asshole.

26
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,255
混蛋
Asshole.

27
00:06:56,424 --> 00:07:01,631
什么？哦，我是克雷默
查斯・克雷默，混蛋
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

28
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,927
- 查斯！
- 什么事？
-Chas!
-What?

29
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,850
- 把车挪开
- 为什么？
-Move the car.
-Why?

30
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,808
叫你挪你就挪！
Move the damn car!

31
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,232
“查斯，把车挪开”
''Chas, move the car. ''

32
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:17,772
好吧，挪了
There, car's moved.

33
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,907
把镜子举起来，对着床
Lift it up over the bed.

34
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:36,999
把那头系牢
亨内斯，从上面拉过去
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

35
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:43,680
把你们的眼睛闭上
不管发生什么都别睁开
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

36
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,726
不！
No!

37
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:06,113
现身吧
Show yourself.

38
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,246
来笑一个，你这傻X
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

39
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,125
操你妈！
For your boss.

40
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,220
拉！
Pull it!

41
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,615
妈妈？
Ma? Ma?

42
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:33,991
我说得没错吧，约翰，给你找着一个
是不是？
Like l said, l found you something,
didn't l, John? Didn't l?

43
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,831
那儿怎么了？
What happened in there?

44
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,506
最近会议很多吧
Going to a lot of meetings, l see.

45
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:47,799
闹得我都睡不着
Keeps the voices out so l can sleep.

46
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,428
我得睡觉，约翰
l have to sleep, John.

47
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,638
我需要帮助，神父
l need some help, Father.

48
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,937
你？
You do?

49
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,855
要我帮助？
From me?

50
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,731
什么样的……？
What kind of--?

51
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:07,149
- 听着，我……
- 你那种驱魔术不对
-Hey, listen, l--
-That exorcism wasn't right.

52
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,986
听着广播
Listen to the ether.

53
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,578
如果有什么异常，一定要告诉我
Anything unusual, you let me know.

54
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:22,119
来吧，你不需要它的保护
它今天可能还会回来
Come on, you don't need its protection.
lt'll be like back in the day.

55
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,501
或许几天
A few days.

56
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,005
好吧
Okay.

57
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:32,594
好吧，为了你，约翰
Okay. For you, John.

58
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,553
约翰，你明知这不是我的车
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

59
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,310
- 我告诉过你让你挪开的
- 你是告诉过我
-l told you to move it.
-You did tell me to move it. . .

60
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:45,983
可是如果你告诉我
你要扔下来一个装着魔鬼的300磅的镜子
. . .but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon. . .

61
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:47,981
我会把车挪得更远一点
. . .l would've moved it further, John.

62
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:51,816
- 去阿尔瓦拉多大街
- 好的先生，我知道怎么走
-Take Alvarado.
-Yeah, thank you. l know what to take.

63
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:56,861
你有没有考虑过，如果多告诉我一些事情
说不定我能帮上忙呢？
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe l could help out?

64
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,368
- 没有？
- 没有
-No?
-Nope.

65
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,869
没有？
Nope?

66
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,119
当然是――没有
Of course it's a nope.

67
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,790
保佑我，神父，我有罪
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.

68
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,045
我已经……
It's been...

69
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:50,257
有两个礼拜没来忏悔了
... two weeks since my last confession.

70
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,801
今天我杀了个人
l killed a man today.

71
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,593
又一个
Another one.

72
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:08,017
我甚至连他长什么样都没看清
l didn't even see his face, l just. . .

73
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,436
就扣下了扳机
接着他就死了
. . .pulled the trigger, and he went away.

74
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:18,826
大多数警察20年都不开一枪
Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.

75
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:24,079
而我却总是知道
这些家伙藏在哪儿
Why do I always know
where these guys are?

76
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:27,585
该朝哪儿瞄准，什么时候开枪
Where to aim, when to fire.

77
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,169
神父，我在想
会不会是我有什么问题？
I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?

78
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:35,004
被诅咒了？
Something damned?

79
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:40,518
上帝自有安排
他给我们每个人都安排好了
God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.

80
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:45,099
别让罪恶吞没了你的信念
You mustn 't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.

81
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:47,312
是的，我在努力
Yeah, I'm trying.

82
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:50,558
一直都在努力
I'm trying real hard.

83
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:53,483
伊莎贝尔
Isabel.

84
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:46,705
伊莎贝尔
Isabel.

85
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:45,633
我所战胜的东西
Things l've beaten.

86
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,518
大多数人听都没听说过
Things most people never even heard of.

87
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:53,100
可是现在呢
我却要被这玩意儿搞定
And now l'm gonna be done in by this.

88
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,560
你也不是第一个了，约翰
Wouldn't be the first, John.

89
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,487
得了吧，莱丝
Come on, Les.

90
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,983
你救过我一次
这次也可以，对吗？
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

91
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:06,031
癌细胞已经扩散了
This is aggressive.

92
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:10,286
20年前，你不想来这儿
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

93
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:13,457
现在你又不想离开
Now you don't wanna leave.

94
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,288
你还抽
Yeah, that's a good idea.

95
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,253
约翰，你真的需要准备一下了
John, you really need to prepare.

96
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:28,806
- 安排后事吧
- 没必要
-Make arrangements.
-No need.

97
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,140
我很清楚自己何去何从
l already know exactly where l'm going.

98
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,109
- 早
- 早上好
-Morning.
-Good morning.

99
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,235
- 早上好
- 探长
-Good morning.
-Detective.

100
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,234
- 不，不不
- 安吉拉，等等
-No, no, no.
-Angela, wait.

101
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,079
你还是别看了，好吗？别看了
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

102
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:48,747
大家先回避一下
Give us the room, please.

103
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,022
伊莎贝尔
lsabel.

104
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:31,035
她从屋顶上掉下来的？
She fell from the roof?

105
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,034
她跳下来的
She jumped.

106
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,795
- 不可能
- 听着
-No.
-Look. . .

107
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:41,126
我知道这很难接受
可她有病
. . .l know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

108
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:53,177
- 伊莎贝尔不会自杀的
- 安吉
-lsabel wouldn't kill herself.
-Angie.

109
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,889
- 她不会自杀的
- 探长
-She wouldn't kill herself.
-Detective.

110
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,394
- 皮瑞尔德
- 探长
-Period.
-Detective.

111
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,191
皮瑞尔德！
Period!

112
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,936
安吉，监控录像都拍下来了
Angie, there were security cameras.

113
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,749
- 等一下，是下去么？
- 如果我有办法，当然不想“下去”
-Hold the door. You going down?
-Not if l can help it.

114
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,048
有新案子？
A new case?

115
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:14,976
什么大案子？
是你期待已久的吗？
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

116
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,182
- 少奉承我
- 习惯了
-Humor me.
-Don't l always?

117
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,771
哦，这是……
太感激了，谢谢
Oh, yeah, that's--
Much obliged. Thank you.

118
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,485
最近还好吗，约翰？
How you feeling, John?

119
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,321
看看有什么新的货色
So, what's new?

120
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:40,373
教皇遇刺时留下的子弹碎屑
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope. . .

121
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:44,163
采自约旦河的圣水针剂
. . .holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan. . .

122
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,251
还有……哦，这个你肯定喜欢
从阿米蒂维勒村找来的尖叫甲虫
（译者注：参考电影"The Amityville Horror"）
. . .and-- Oh, you'll love this.
--screech beetle from Amityville.

123
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,512
是啊，对你来说很有趣
可对“下面”的东西来说，这就像黑板上钉钉
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the
fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

124
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:58,805
你和虫子，到底是什么关系？
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

125
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:01,889
我只是喜欢它们
l just like them.

126
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,940
是啊，谁不喜欢？
Yeah. Who doesn't?

127
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,152
悠着点，大英雄
Yeah, easy there, hero.

128
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:11,905
- 这是“龙之息”
- 我还以为你再也搞不到了呢
-That's dragon's breath.
-l thought you couldn't get it anymore.

129
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:16,869
是这样，我朋友的朋友……
Yeah, well, l know a guy
who knows a guy.

130
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:26,628
好吧，这次是什么行动？
So, what's the action?

131
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:30,875
我刚把一个魔兵
从一个小女孩的身体里赶出来
l just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

132
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,139
看起来好像它想要复活
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

133
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,178
我懂你的意思
Yeah, l know how it sounds.

134
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:39,640
可是约翰，我们对他们来说
只不过是掌中的玩偶
No, we're finger puppets
to them, John. . .

135
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,188
而不是某种入口
. . .not doorways.

136
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:45,436
他们可以操纵我们
但不能穿透结界进到我们的世界中
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

137
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,231
还是查一下卷轴吧
看看以前有没有先例
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

138
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,313
没问题，约翰
Sure thing, John.

139
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,067
还有什么事吗？
Anything else?

140
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,279
你那里有没有什么可以……？
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a--?

141
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,284
免费的
（译者注：止咳药）
On the house.

142
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,825
好吧，我有个问题
我还得做你的奴隶到几时？
All right, question. How much longer
do l have to be your slave, John?

143
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:07,920
你不是我的奴隶，查斯
You're not my slave, Chas.

144
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,794
你是我非常赏识的徒弟
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

145
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,128
就像汤托和罗宾一样
Like Tonto or Robin.

146
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:17,005
还有那个胖哥身边的小家伙
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

147
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:21,050
好吧，那我除了开车之外
就不能干点别的了么？
Right. So then why don't l apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

148
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,648
约翰？约翰
John? John.

149
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:29,570
很高兴和你谈话，约翰
l love our little talks, John.

150
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,994
您的外套，康斯坦丁先生
May l take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

151
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,957
不用了，谢谢
我一会儿就走
No, thanks,
l'm not gonna be staying long.

152
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:52,709
- 这位女士，您呢？
- 哦不用了，我也一会儿就走
-How about you, ma'am?
-Oh, no, l'm not staying long either.

153
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:55,383
我真的要和他说话
有重要的事
l really need to speak with him.
lt's important.

154
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,260
先到先得
First come, first served.

155
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:04,514
看来你到哪儿都是这么粗鲁
So you're rude no matter where you are.

156
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,113
- 神父
- 你好
-Father.
-Hi.

157
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,409
- 带来什么新消息了
- 是的，刚和主教谈过
-You have news. Yes.
-Yes, l spoke with the bishop.

158
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,081
我知道你要什么，孩子
l know what you want, son.

159
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:31,789
你那双无所不见的眼睛还盯着我呢
加百列？
（译者注：替上帝把好消息报告世人的天使）
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

160
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:35,377
承蒙夸奖
l'm flattered.

161
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,802
我可以告诉你一些
Well, l could offer something. . .

162
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:43,220
关于牧羊人是怎样
带领他最不听话的羊群的故事
. . .about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock. . .

163
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,470
可这听起来也许不够真诚
. . .but it might sound disingenuous.

164
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:48,398
她应该得到天主教的葬礼
神父，求你了
She has to have a Catholic funeral,
Father. She has to.

165
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:52,778
- 安杰拉，她犯的是不可饶恕的大罪
- 她不是自杀的
-Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
-She didn't commit suicide.

166
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,567
可主教不这么想
你知道教规的
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

167
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,816
哦，教规
Oh, rules.

168
00:21:57,992 --> 00:21:59,819
神父
Father.

169
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:01,573
戴维
David.

170
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:05,157
她是伊莎贝尔
This is lsabel.

171
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,081
她惟一相信的爱她的人就是上帝
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

172
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:11,706
求你了
Please.

173
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,292
恕我无能为力
l'm sorry.

174
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:20,629
最近我看到一些异常的灵异活动
l've been seeing some unusual
soul traffic lately.

175
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,558
也许你能考虑再给我点时间
You might consider
giving me an extension.

176
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:26,300
我可以为你们这边帮些忙
l could do your side some good
these days.

177
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,721
你还在为进入天堂积德呢？
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

178
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:32,644
没见我赶走多少小鬼吗？
What about the minions l've sent back?

179
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:36,982
- 光凭这个，就应该保证我能进天堂了
- 我跟你说过多少次了？
-That alone should guarantee my entry.
-How many times have l told you?

180
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,149
靠这样是进不了天堂的
That's not the way this works.

181
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,030
为什么？我为他做的还不够多吗？
Why, haven't l served him enough?

182
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:45,955
- 他到底想要我怎么样？
- 很简单
-What does he want from me?
-Only the usual.

183
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:49,208
献身，信仰
Self-sacrifice, belief.

184
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:52,580
- 哦，我信！我对天发誓
- 不，不，你自己心里有数
-Oh, l believe, for chrissake.
-No, no, you know.

185
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,997
其中的区别你也能看见
And there's a difference. You've seen.

186
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:59,836
我并没有要求看见
我生下来就被诅咒了
l never asked to see.
l was born with this curse.

187
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,089
约翰，这是天赋
A gift, John.

188
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:04,756
而你只是用自私的行动把它浪费了
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

189
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:08,469
我把魔鬼从女孩的身体里赶走
l'm pulling demons out of little girls.

190
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,473
这是为了谁？
Who's that for?

191
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:15,183
你所做的一切都是为了你自己
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

192
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,603
为了积德好进入天堂
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

193
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,402
不可能的规则，无尽的约束
lmpossible rules, endless regulations. . .

194
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:24,703
谁上天，谁入地
为什么
. . .who goes up, who goes down
and why.

195
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,793
你一点都不理解我们
You don't even understand us.

196
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:35,083
你才应该入地狱
你这个杂种
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

197
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,809
为什么是我，加百列？
Why me, Gabriel?

198
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,638
这完全是因为我自己的缘故，是不是？
lt's personal, isn't it?

199
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:59,530
因为去教堂去得太少
也不怎么祈祷
l didn't go to church enough,
l didn't pray enough. . .

200
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:04,158
还舍不得往募捐箱里放上5块钱
是不是？
. . .l was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

201
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:08,914
你这么年轻就要死
You are going to die young. . .

202
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:12,996
是因为你从15岁起就每天要吸30根烟
. . .because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 1 5.

203
00:24:13,544 --> 00:24:16,035
而你之所以要去地狱
And you're going to go to hell. . .

204
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:19,257
是因为你所过的生活
. . .because of the life you took.

205
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:26,132
你很失败
You're fucked.

206
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:40,191
至少在外面感觉还不错
At least it's nice out.

207
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:46,068
他总是一点幽默感都没有
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

208
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,291
他的笑话一点都不好笑
And his punch lines are killers.

209
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,962
约翰！
John!

210
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:07,295
康斯坦丁，下雨哪！
约翰，嗨！
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

211
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:23,484
凶手的后院里发现埋藏着22具女尸
Twenty-two women were found buried
in the assailant's back yard.

212
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:27,357
尸体受到严重的摧残
警察的辨认工作……
So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match....

213
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:29,991
据警察说
她的身体曾被穿刺超过100次
Police report she had been
physically penetrated...

214
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,914
然后被活埋
...over 1 00 times and buried alive.

215
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:36,831
……被发现锁在冷藏库中
头部严重受伤，器官……
--found locked in a storage freezer,
his head severed and his organs....

216
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,794
他把霍莉的身体塞入……
He stuffed Holly's body into....

217
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:42,961
- 受到不明强暴的尸体……
- 他使用了一把小手锯……
-The bodies ravished by the unknown....
-He used a small handsaw....

218
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:46,585
头颅几乎被砍下来……
眼珠都被挖了出来
Had nearly decapitated....
Even his eyes were gouged out.

219
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,423
伊莎贝尔
Isabel.

220
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:58,850
（精神病院的自杀事件）

221
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:14,495
我很抱歉，妹妹
l'm so sorry, lzzy.

222
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,743
康斯坦丁
Constantine.

223
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:52,742
道森
Dodson.

224
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:54,697
喂？
Hello?

225
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:57,158
喂
Hello.

226
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,415
喂？
Hello?

227
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:09,862
嗨，老兄
能借个火吗
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

228
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,018
别多管闲事，驱魔人
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

229
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,210
我知道你要去哪儿，约翰
你要去米耐那儿
l know where you're going, John.
You're going to Midnite's.

230
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:13,044
希望你呆在车里
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

231
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:17,003
那儿是鬼魂的避难所
我记得在书上读到过，约翰
lt's a haven for those who rise and fall.
l remember reading about this, John.

232
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:19,933
- 你读书读得太多了，那是个酒吧
- 酒吧？
-You read too much, kid. lt's a bar.
-lt's a bar?

233
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:24,478
是酒吧，米耐老爹是个乐善好施的人
他曾经发誓坚守中立
lt's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for
good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

234
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:27,269
- 约翰，他可是传奇人物
- 是的
-John, the man's a legend.
-Yeah.

235
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:29,933
你能带我进去吗？
约翰，求求你
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

236
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,653
求你了，约翰，行吗？
l'm begging you, John, please?

237
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,986
- 好吧，你可以进去
- 我可以进去？
-Sure, you can get in.
-l can get in?

238
00:29:35,158 --> 00:29:37,364
如果你能进去的话
lf you can get in.

239
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,825
如果我能……？
是熊？还是云中的两只鸭子？
lf l can get--? lt's a bear, though, right?
Or two ducks in a cloud?

240
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,578
长凳上的两只青蛙
Two frogs on a bench.

241
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,883
长凳上的两只青蛙
Two frogs on a bench.

242
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:56,044
不，我是和刚才那个人一起的……
No, no, l'm with the guy you just--

243
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,094
约翰！约翰！
John! John!

244
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:00,257
我是和他一起的
l'm with him, though.

245
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:03,349
穿着裙子的老鼠
Rat in a dress.

246
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,892
当然，穿着裙子的老鼠
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

247
00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:09,022
我只是试试，只是试试
l'm just testing. l'm just testing.

248
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,156
不用站起来了
Don't get up.

249
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,828
好久不见了
You've been absent some time.

250
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,997
又有什么圣物要卖吗？
Have you come here with relics to sell?

251
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,583
没有，现在不干那个了
太忙了
No, l'm out of that now.
l've been too busy.

252
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:19,634
终于发现造假对你的健康不利了？
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

253
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:21,761
米耐，上帝啊……
Midnite, Jesus. . .

254
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,347
……我想这件事是真的
. . .l thought the thing was authentic.

255
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,973
我知道了
l see now.

256
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:33,481
你的身体不好是因为其他原因
多长时间了？
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

257
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:35,443
几个月吧，可能一年
A few months, maybe a year.

258
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:38,281
我昨晚好像听到雷声了
l thought l heard thunder last night.

259
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:41,567
肯定是撒旦的胃在咆哮
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

260
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,871
你的魂要他亲自出马来收
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

261
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,364
我也听说了
So l've heard.

262
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,836
好吧，我想你来这儿
Well, l am most certain
you did not come here. . .

263
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:55,170
肯定不是想找个有同情心的人来诉苦的
. . .for a sympathetic shoulder
to cry on.

264
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:01,252
刚才有个魔鬼攻击了我
就在通往费格罗阿大街的路上
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

265
00:32:01,554 --> 00:32:03,677
他们不喜欢你，约翰
They don't like you, John.

266
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:05,722
你驱赶了多少个魔鬼？
How many have you
deported back to hell?

267
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:10,435
米耐，这次不是那种愤怒的杂种
而是实实在在的魔鬼，就在这儿，在我们的世界里
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

268
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:13,357
我想我不用提醒你
这是不可能的
Clearly l do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

269
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:15,850
还有昨天，我见到一个魔兵
And yesterday l saw a soldier demon. . .

270
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:18,518
试图从一个小女孩身体里冲破结界
. . .trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

271
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:23,442
听着，约翰，魔鬼只能呆在地狱里
天使只能呆在天堂里
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven. . .

272
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:26,156
从造物之初就是这样
. . .the great detente
of the original superpowers.

273
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:31,246
谢谢你给我上的历史课，米耐
你真是帮了我大忙了
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

274
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,995
现在
Now. . .

275
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:36,630
我需要使用那把椅子
. . .l need to use the chair.

276
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,421
约翰，你难道忘了
这么做几乎肯定是要没命的
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you. . .

277
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:46,305
你知道我是中立者
. . .you know l am neutral.

278
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:50,721
只要平衡没有发生变化
我就保持中立
And as long as the balance
is maintained, l take no sides.

279
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:54,514
在你当酒吧侍应之前
Before you were a bartender. . .

280
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:59,057
你曾经是个巫医
. . .you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

281
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:02,947
- 而我……
- 你是康斯坦丁
-And l--
-You were Constantine.

282
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:06,487
约翰・康斯坦丁
The John Constantine.

283
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:08,946
曾经是的
Once.

284
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,705
这次非比寻常，我能感觉得到
This isn't the usual game, l can feel it.

285
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,284
它在逼近
Something's coming.

286
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,087
胆小鬼
Spooky.

287
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,090
巴尔萨泽
Balthazar.

288
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:25,339
光是那种表情就让我彻夜难眠
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

289
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:27,466
我来教你怎么睡觉
l'll make your night.

290
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,341
我现在就把你打回老家去
你这个杂碎！
l'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

291
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:37,848
你知道我这儿的规矩
在我这儿就要按我的规矩来
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

292
00:33:38,026 --> 00:33:39,983
小约翰
Johnny boy.

293
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:46,658
听说你快要下来了
Word is you're on your way down.

294
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:49,032
新鲜的肉啊
Fresh meat.

295
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:54,657
吮指回味
Finger-licking good.

296
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,828
约翰，我们还有事要谈
We have a meeting now, John.

297
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:07,128
你说什么？我没听清
What? l didn't catch that.

298
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,929
欢迎加入我的生活
Welcome to my life.

299
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:03,813
康斯坦丁先生
Mr. Constantine.

300
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:08,355
- 我们之前……
- 我记得
-l saw you--
-l remember.

301
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,992
- 后来还在……
- 看来咱们还真是有缘
-And then l saw you at the--
-Regular kismet.

302
00:35:13,204 --> 00:35:16,703
能不能容我问几个问题
l'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

303
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,959
现在我不想和任何人说话
l'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

304
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:22,786
好吧，那光听我说可以吗？
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

305
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:25,083
行吗？
Please?

306
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:30,886
就知道没那么简单
Always a catch.

307
00:35:45,737 --> 00:35:48,441
昨天我妹妹被谋杀了
My sister was murdered yesterday.

308
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:51,568
- 很遗憾
- 谢了
-Sorry to hear.
-Thanks.

309
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:56,827
她是雷文斯卡精神病院的病人
从屋顶跳下去死的
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

310
00:35:57,498 --> 00:35:59,456
刚才好像听你说是谋杀？
Thought you said she was murdered.

311
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,626
是的，伊莎贝尔不可能自杀的
Yeah, well, lsabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

312
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:06,460
也是，什么样的精神病人会自杀呢？
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

313
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,542
真可怕
That's just crazy.

314
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:17,422
是这样的，我听说你在这块很有名
Look, l've heard your name
around the precinct.

315
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:22,809
我知道你活动的圈子
超自然，鬼神学，驱魔……
l know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

316
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:26,600
就在我妹妹被杀之前
她得了严重的妄想症
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

317
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:31,487
她开始谈论魔鬼，天使
She started talking about demons,
angels.

318
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:34,409
我想她是被什么人影响了
康斯坦丁先生
Now, l think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

319
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:38,361
她肯定是被洗了脑
才会从屋顶上跳下去的
l think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

320
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:43,000
某种邪教组织
Some kind of legion or cult.

321
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:46,129
你分析得很有道理啊
大侦探
Sounds like a theory, detective.

322
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:47,708
祝你好运
Good luck.

323
00:36:50,051 --> 00:36:52,589
我想以你的背景
至少可以……
l thought with your background,
you could at least. . .

324
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,422
给我指明正确的方向
. . .point me in the right direction.

325
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:56,922
可以，当然可以
Yeah, okay, sure.

326
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:02,262
她不是自杀
lt wasn't a suicide.

327
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:04,597
我妹妹是个虔诚的天主教徒
My sister was a devout Catholic.

328
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:07,265
你懂吗？
如果她自己结束自己的生命
Do you understand that?
lf she took her own life--

329
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:10,230
她的灵魂会直接下地狱
Her soul would go straight to hell. . .

330
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:15,530
在尖叫中一次又一次地被撕裂
饱受折磨，极度痛苦
. . .where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony. . .

331
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:18,952
永世不得翻身，对吗？
. . .for all eternity. That it?

332
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:21,161
我说得没错吧？
That about right?

333
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:30,254
你他妈的
Goddamn you.

334
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,074
侦探
Detective.

335
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:05,083
如果我告诉你
上帝和魔鬼打了个赌……
What if l told you that God
and the devil made a wager. . .

336
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:08,750
他们的赌注就是所有人类的灵魂
你信么？
. . .a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

337
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:11,412
我会告诉你回去找你的医生
l'd tell you to stay on your meds.

338
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:15,885
别跟我争
他们的约定是不能直接涉足人间
Humor me. No direct contact with
humans. That would be the rule.

339
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,432
- 只能施加影响，最后看谁能赢
- 好吧，我不跟你争
-Just influence. See who would win.
-Okay, l'm humoring you.

340
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,676
- 可是为什么呢？
- 谁知道呢
-Why?
-Who knows.

341
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:25,936
- 也许只是为了好玩
- 哦，这可真好玩
-Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
-Oh, so it's fun.

342
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:31,100
丈夫打死妻子好玩么？
母亲淹死孩子好玩么？
lt's fun when a man beats his wife to
death, when a mother drowns her baby.

343
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:35,026
你觉得这都归因于魔鬼？
And you think the devil is responsible?

344
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:37,949
你错了，康斯坦丁
是人，人才是魔鬼
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

345
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:41,569
你说得很对
人性本恶
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

346
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:45,494
再加上受到其他某种东西的引导……
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

347
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:49,118
好吧，谢谢你给我上了一课
Well, this has been real educational. . .

348
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:51,003
可我不相信有什么魔鬼
. . .but l don't believe in the devil.

349
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:54,623
你应该相信
就如魔鬼相信你的存在
You should. He believes in you.

350
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:16,985
只是停电了
lt's a power outage.

351
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:19,114
不像
Not likely.

352
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:25,160
- 什么？
- 不能呆在这儿了，快走
-What?
-We should go. Now.

353
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:32,287
那是什么？
What is that?

354
00:39:33,381 --> 00:39:35,124
翅膀
Wings.

355
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:38,047
也许是魔爪
Maybe talons.

356
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:41,091
别开玩笑了，你说什么？
You're kidding. Of what?

357
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:45,099
一些不该在这儿的东西
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

358
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:51,643
枪在这儿基本上没用
That's really not going to help.

359
00:39:56,237 --> 00:39:58,906
- 闭上眼睛
- 为什么？
-Close your eyes.
-Why?

360
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:00,402
为了你自己
Suit yourself.

361
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:26,055
谁说魔鬼只呆在地狱里？
Demons stay in hell, huh?

362
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:29,469
得告诉他们
Tell them that.

363
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:36,482
别担心
第一次都是这样
Don't worry. Happens to everyone
the first time.

364
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:38,775
那是硫磺
lt's the sulfur.

365
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:41,356
硫磺
Sulfur.

366
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:45,984
那些东西是什么？
What were those things?

367
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:49,038
魔鬼
Demons.

368
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,246
- 被诅咒的食腐怪
- 不，这不可能
-Scavengers of the damned.
-No, no. lt's impossible.

369
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:59,205
信不信由你
而且我认为它们不是来找我的
Yeah. And l don't think
they were after me.

370
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:04,380
你真的认为她不是自杀的？
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

371
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:05,966
伊莎贝尔？
lsabel?

372
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,842
绝对不信
Never in a million years.

373
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:11,303
好吧，我们来确认一下
Well, let's be sure.

374
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:14,012
看看她是不是在地狱里
Let's see if she's in hell.

375
00:41:38,423 --> 00:41:40,664
哦，应该是冷水还是热水？
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

376
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:43,292
放在椅子前面
ln front of the chair.

377
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,007
真不敢相信我居然在干这个
l can't believe l'm doing this.

378
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:50,804
- 这些都是伊莎贝尔的东西？
- 对
-These are all lsabel's things?
-Yeah.

379
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,846
- 这猫呢？
- 达珂？
-How about the cat?
-Duck?

380
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,640
是啊，怎么了？
Yeah, why?

381
00:41:57,692 --> 00:41:59,020
达珂
Duck.

382
00:41:59,193 --> 00:42:01,519
哦，觉得奇怪是么
Oh, you think that's strange.

383
00:42:01,696 --> 00:42:03,155
猫是很好的动物
Cats are good.

384
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:04,947
很有灵性
Half in, half out anyway.

385
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:26,462
如果你要施某种法术或什么的话
lf this is some kind of spell
or something. . .

386
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:29,804
难道不需要点蜡烛和画五角星么？
. . .don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

387
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:32,299
哦？你有吗？
Why, do you have any?

388
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:35,556
- 简直是疯了
- 是的
-This is crazy.
-Yes.

389
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:41,439
你得离开
l need you to leave.

390
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:45,113
- 为什么？
- 安吉拉，拜托
-l'm sorry?
-Angela, please.

391
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,403
我是说离开这屋子
The apartment.

392
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:55,241
好吧
Okay.

393
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:04,127
当心我的猫
Be careful with that cat.

394
00:43:08,262 --> 00:43:10,967
上帝，我恨干这个
God, l hate this part.

395
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:16,592
- 伊莎贝尔
- 康斯坦丁
-lsabel.
-Constantine.

396
00:46:02,145 --> 00:46:03,555
安吉拉
Angela.

397
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:08,567
上帝
Jesus.

398
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,524
- 康斯坦丁，你怎么啦？
- 双胞胎
-Constantine, what--?
-Twins.

399
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:16,608
上帝，你说什么？
Jesus. What?

400
00:46:17,535 --> 00:46:20,026
- 你们是双胞胎
- 你说什么？
-You were twins.
-What did you say?

401
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:22,874
- 她是自杀的
- 什么？
-She killed herself.
-What?

402
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,621
因此被罚入地狱
And she's damned for it.

403
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,342
这怎么可能？
How is this possible?

404
00:46:43,895 --> 00:46:45,722
我得吃点东西
l need to eat.

405
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:35,954
嗨，嗨！
你在这儿干什么？
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

406
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:40,878
别激动，哥们儿
Relax, man.

407
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,297
慢点！
Slow down!

408
00:49:06,537 --> 00:49:09,455
这儿他妈的是什么地方？
What the hell kind of place is this?

409
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:01,841
约翰
John.

410
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:36,157
我小的时候
能看到一些东西
When l was a kid, l could see things.

411
00:50:36,669 --> 00:50:38,709
一些人类看不到的东西
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

412
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:43,168
也是不应该看到的东西
Things you shouldn 't have to see.

413
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:05,071
我父母都是正常人
他们像大多数父母一样
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

414
00:51:05,281 --> 00:51:07,737
让情况变得更糟
They made it worse.

415
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:12,990
当你觉得再也无法忍受的时候
You think you're crazy long enough. . .

416
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:14,784
你就会寻找出路
. . .you find a way out.

417
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:19,040
- 你尝试自杀？
- 我什么都没尝试
-You tried to kill yourself.
-I didn 't try anything.

418
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,925
准确的说，我死过两分钟
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

419
00:51:26,803 --> 00:51:29,210
但是当我跨入另一个世界的时候
But when you cross over. . .

420
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,715
时间就停止了
. . .time stops.

421
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:37,014
我敢说
地狱里的两分钟就像一生那么漫长
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

422
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,229
当我重回人世的时候
When l came back. . .

423
00:51:43,152 --> 00:51:44,944
我终于知道
. . .l knew. . .

424
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,031
我能看到的所有的东西都是真实的
. . .all the things l could see were real.

425
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:54,492
天堂和地狱无处不在
每一堵墙，每一扇窗后面
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

426
00:51:54,664 --> 00:51:59,658
这个世界背后还有一个世界
而我们被夹在中间
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

427
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:03,370
天使和魔鬼都不能逾越
进入我们的世界
Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

428
00:52:03,548 --> 00:52:06,465
所以，我们看到的就是所谓的“杂种”
So instead we get
what l call half-breeds.

429
00:52:07,593 --> 00:52:09,835
蛊惑者
The influence peddlers.

430
00:52:10,013 --> 00:52:15,469
它们只能在你耳边煽风点火
但是它的一句话就能给你勇气
They can only whisper in our ears, but
a single word can give you courage...

431
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:19,688
或者让你一下子从快乐的巅峰
掉落到痛苦的深渊
...or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.

432
00:52:19,856 --> 00:52:22,892
那些被魔鬼触碰的
Those with the demon 's touch...

433
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:28,109
比如半天使
是和我们生活在一起的
...like those part angel,
living alongside us.

434
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,772
他们称之为平衡
They call it the balance.

435
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,320
而我称之为虚伪的狗屁
l call it hypocritical bullshit.

436
00:52:35,872 --> 00:52:38,445
所以当哪个杂种不守规矩
So when a half-breed breaks the rules. . .

437
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:42,908
我会直接让他滚进地狱
. . .l deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

438
00:52:43,546 --> 00:52:46,167
这样的杂种太多了
l don't get them all. . .

439
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:50,627
我只希望尽量多的除掉一些
让自己能够
. . .but l've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my. . .

440
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:54,638
- 早点退休
- 我不懂
-. . .retirement.
-l don't understand.

441
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:58,807
我就是在自杀，安吉拉
l'm a suicide, Angela.

442
00:52:58,978 --> 00:53:02,513
当我死的时候，按照规则
我只有一个地方可去
When l die, the rules say
l've got just one place to go.

443
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,730
你是在积德，希望能进天堂
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

444
00:53:04,901 --> 00:53:07,439
要是你被关进一个
半数犯人都是你亲手抓进去的监狱里
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison. . .

445
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:09,937
你会有什么感觉？
. . .where half the inmates
were put there by you?

446
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:14,863
我想上帝为我们每个人都安排好了一切
l guess God has a plan for all of us.

447
00:53:15,286 --> 00:53:18,406
小姐
上帝只是一个玩蚂蚁的小孩
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

448
00:53:18,581 --> 00:53:20,621
他什么都没安排
He's not planning anything.

449
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,993
在我们小的时候
When we were little. . .

450
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:26,577
伊莎贝尔也能看到东西
. . .lsabel saw things too.

451
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:33,422
道森
Dodson.

452
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:39,515
警卫发现他在摸弄尸体
然后他仓皇跑到街对面
Guard spotted him groping the body,
then he ran across the street.

453
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:42,770
跑进店里来
把货架上的酒打开喝了个遍
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

454
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:46,189
不到一分钟
他就溺死在酒里了
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

455
00:53:46,776 --> 00:53:49,397
本可以成为我们教友会的一员的
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

456
00:53:51,864 --> 00:53:53,822
他跑到这儿来干什么？
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

457
00:53:54,117 --> 00:53:55,611
没关系
He's okay.

458
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:08,704
为什么不给我打电话
狗娘养的
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

459
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:45,082
喂？
Yes?

460
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,870
什么意思？
What do you mean?

461
00:54:48,796 --> 00:54:50,291
什么？
What?

462
00:54:50,465 --> 00:54:52,007
怎么会？
How?

463
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,639
知道了，拜拜
Got it. Bye.

464
00:55:13,154 --> 00:55:16,155
我要看一下伊莎贝尔死亡的现场
l need to see where lsabel died.

465
00:55:16,324 --> 00:55:19,491
请神，占卜，通灵
Seances, Ouija boards, channeling.

466
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:23,702
父亲以为她只是想引人注意
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

467
00:55:23,956 --> 00:55:26,412
可事实上不是
She certainly did that.

468
00:55:26,626 --> 00:55:30,125
她把她看到的东西告诉每一个人
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

469
00:55:30,296 --> 00:55:33,997
把母亲吓得半死
She'd scare my mother half to death.

470
00:55:35,802 --> 00:55:38,471
之后几乎一年
她始终一言不发
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

471
00:55:38,638 --> 00:55:40,880
所以你们把她送到这儿来了
So you had her committed.

472
00:55:41,057 --> 00:55:42,385
是的
Yeah.

473
00:55:42,558 --> 00:55:44,218
有多长时间了？
How long?

474
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:46,310
两个星期
Two weeks.

475
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:48,556
这一次
This time.

476
00:55:48,731 --> 00:55:53,310
她的病情时好时坏
最近又恶化了
She'd get better, and then she'd
get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

477
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:58,939
那个死者手掌上刻的符号
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand. . .

478
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:01,405
会不会和这有关？
. . .does it have something to do
with this?

479
00:56:01,744 --> 00:56:03,986
约翰，别忘了我是警察
l'm a cop, John, remember?

480
00:56:04,163 --> 00:56:09,121
一个人不可能什么都没留下
就这么跳楼自杀的
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

481
00:56:09,293 --> 00:56:14,169
而我已经把她所有的遗物都给你看过了
不过你尽管找
And l showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

482
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,679
也许她留下了一些
警察找不到的东西
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

483
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,007
一些只有你才能找到的东西
Something just for you.

484
00:56:24,517 --> 00:56:28,729
你们是双胞胎，安吉拉
双胞胎的想法是相似的
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

485
00:56:28,896 --> 00:56:32,230
- 我不像我的妹妹
- 但你曾经是的
-l'm not like my sister.
-But you were once.

486
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,606
当你们还是孩子的时候
When you were kids.

487
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:37,696
当你们每时每刻形影不离的时候
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

488
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:41,612
你说一句，她就能接下句
你受伤了，她就会哭
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

489
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:43,243
那是很久以前了
That was a long time ago.

490
00:56:43,411 --> 00:56:45,368
那种联系不会这么轻易就消失的
That kind of bond doesn't
just disappear.

491
00:56:45,538 --> 00:56:47,614
这儿什么都没有
There is nothing here.

492
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:51,374
- 得了吧
- 她在这间屋子里筹划了自己的死
-Hey. Come on.
-She planned her death in this room.

493
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:54,960
她是在这儿想出来的
就在你所站的地方
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

494
00:56:55,131 --> 00:56:58,381
她知道你会来
她指望你能见她所见
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw. . .

495
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:01,587
感她所感
知她所知
. . .feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

496
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:04,593
- 安吉拉，她做了什么？
- 我怎么会知道？
-What did she do, Angela?
-How should l know?

497
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:07,173
- 安吉拉，她做了什么？
- 我不知道
-What did she do, Angela?
-l don't know.

498
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:11,681
- 换了你会怎么做？
- 我不知道
-What would you do?
-l don't know.

499
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:16,601
安吉拉，她做了什么？
你知道的，她到底做了什么？
What did she do, Angela? You know
what she did. What did she do, Angela?

500
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:20,063
你知道的！
你为什么不敢说？她做了什么？
You know what she did. What are
you afraid of? What did she do?

501
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:22,565
- 她做了什么？
- 我不知道！
-What did she do?
-l don't know!

502
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:42,466
我们小的时候
When we were girls. . .

503
00:57:45,431 --> 00:57:48,266
喜欢互相给对方留密信
. . .we would leave each other messages.

504
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:52,811
用光
ln light.

505
00:57:55,441 --> 00:57:57,233
或者在窗户上
ln breath.

506
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:03,114
用嘴哈气
On the windows.

507
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:10,694
约翰，歌林多书中没有17章啊
John, there is no 1 7th act
in Corinthians.

508
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:16,624
地狱圣经里，歌林多书有21章
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

509
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:19,963
地狱里也有圣经
They have Bibles in hell.

510
00:58:20,508 --> 00:58:22,999
描绘了另一幅“启示录”
Paints a different view of Revelations.

511
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:25,300
地狱圣经中说
世界不会在上帝的手中终结
Says the world will not end
by God's hand...

512
00:58:25,471 --> 00:58:28,472
而是会在黑暗中重生
...but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.

513
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:30,135
到那时……
Though if you ask me...

514
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:32,725
就是人间炼狱了
. . .fire's fire.

515
00:58:32,895 --> 00:58:37,142
16章29节，16章30节
1 6:29, 1 6:30.

516
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,350
哦，天哪
果然不妙
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

517
00:58:41,529 --> 00:58:45,396
“子之罪定会超越父之罪”
''The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son. ''

518
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:49,527
- 谁的儿子？
- 但是他不可能逾越结界
-Whose son?
-But he can't cross over, B.

519
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:52,325
- 结界是不可能逾越的
- 谁的儿子？上帝的儿子？
-lmpossible to cross over.
-Whose son? God's son?

520
00:58:52,498 --> 00:58:55,950
不，是另一个
魔鬼也有儿子
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

521
00:58:56,252 --> 00:58:57,830
在这儿
Here it is.

522
00:58:58,004 --> 00:59:00,043
这是魔鬼之子曼蒙的标志
This is the sign of Mammon. . .

523
00:59:00,214 --> 00:59:04,675
哦等一下，这儿说……
. . .the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here--

524
00:59:05,178 --> 00:59:07,336
- 比曼？
- 在
-Beeman?
-Yeah.

525
00:59:07,513 --> 00:59:10,514
抱歉，我……
抱歉，不，我在
Sorry, l'm--
l'm sorry, no, l'm right here.

526
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:17,271
上面说曼蒙对他父亲的规矩不耐烦了
lt says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule. . .

527
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,359
渴望建立一个属于他自己的
火与血的王国
. . .and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

528
00:59:28,284 --> 00:59:30,692
没错，曼蒙是我们最不愿意见到
Yeah. Mammon would be
the last demon. . .

529
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,741
出现在我们世界里的魔鬼
. . .we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

530
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:37,533
等等，等等，听我读下去
可是似乎存在某种漏洞
No, wait, wait, wait. l'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

531
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:40,035
就知道没那么简单
Always a catch.

532
00:59:40,463 --> 00:59:46,751
这里说到
曼蒙首先要附身于一个非常强大的通灵者
lt says first Mammon would have to
possess a very, very powerful psychic.

533
00:59:46,928 --> 00:59:49,549
- 伊莎贝尔
- 但这还不够
-lsabel.
-But that wouldn 't be enough.

534
00:59:50,306 --> 00:59:54,767
要穿越结界
曼蒙还需要神的协助
To cross over, Mammon would need
divine assistance.

535
00:59:56,187 --> 01:00:00,351
也就是说需要上帝的帮助
To cross over, Mammon would need
the help of God.

536
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:04,318
- 上帝的帮助？
- 上面说……
-The help of God?
-It says--

537
01:00:11,077 --> 01:00:14,576
- 比曼？
- 约翰，听着
-Beeman?
-John, look. . .

538
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:19,243
我知道你从来都没有什么信念
你从来都不愿意……
. . .l know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to. . .

539
01:00:19,419 --> 01:00:23,167
可这并不意味着你的心里
...but that doesn 't mean
that we don 't have faith...

540
01:00:24,048 --> 01:00:25,792
不存在信念
. . .in you.

541
01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:31,597
比曼？比曼？
Beeman? Beeman?

542
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,631
开快点
Drive. Fast.

543
01:00:50,783 --> 01:00:52,740
比曼！
Beeman!

544
01:00:53,161 --> 01:00:54,869
硫磺
Sulfur.

545
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:57,948
比曼！
Beeman!

546
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:03,836
比曼！
Beeman!

547
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:16,108
不只是伊莎贝尔
Wasn't just lsabel.

548
01:02:17,412 --> 01:02:18,954
我以前也能见到东西
l used to see things too.

549
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,700
可是……
But. . .

550
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:26,743
- 你已经知道了，是不是？
- 回家去，安吉拉
-. . .you already knew that, didn't you?
-Go home, Angela.

551
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:28,380
我要把事情搞清楚
l need to understand.

552
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:31,039
这些事情你最好不要知道
相信我
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

553
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,293
我比伊莎贝尔强
l'm stronger than lsabel.

554
01:02:33,469 --> 01:02:37,419
你的妹妹接受了她的天赋
而你拒绝了，还是拒绝比较好
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours. Denial is a better idea.

555
01:02:37,598 --> 01:02:42,391
这也是为什么你还活着的原因
如果你继续跟着我，就难说了
lt's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

556
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,519
我不想再多个鬼魂跟着我
l don't need another ghost
following me.

557
01:02:44,689 --> 01:02:47,227
约翰，他们杀了我妹妹！
John, they killed my sister.

558
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:53,895
我宁愿死的那个是我
l'd trade places with her if l could.

559
01:02:57,118 --> 01:02:59,739
我过去一直假装自己没有这种能力
l used to pretend that l didn't.

560
01:03:00,413 --> 01:03:02,821
什么都看不见
That l didn't see things.

561
01:03:03,207 --> 01:03:04,785
然后
And. . .

562
01:03:05,918 --> 01:03:10,248
到我们10岁的时候
父母开始强迫她吃安定药
. . .by the time we were 1 0,
they started forcing her to take. . .

563
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,081
并且接受治疗
. . .antipsychotics. . .

564
01:03:14,093 --> 01:03:16,465
当那些东西出现的时候
. . .and have treatments.
They would come for her. . .

565
01:03:16,638 --> 01:03:20,386
她总是看着我
对我说：“告诉他们啊”
. . .and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, ''Tell them.

566
01:03:20,558 --> 01:03:24,390
“安吉，为什么你不告诉他们
你也能看见？”
Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?''

567
01:03:25,563 --> 01:03:26,892
可我却撒了谎
But l lied.

568
01:03:27,774 --> 01:03:29,766
我说：
l said:

569
01:03:31,277 --> 01:03:33,602
“我什么都没看见”
''l don't see anything. ''

570
01:03:34,572 --> 01:03:36,778
直到有一天
Until one day. . .

571
01:03:37,742 --> 01:03:39,366
我终于真的看不见了
. . .l finally stopped seeing.

572
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:44,285
我抛弃了她，约翰
l abandoned her, John.

573
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:47,580
我让她孤立无援
l left her all alone.

574
01:03:54,801 --> 01:03:57,126
我必须得看到她所看到的东西
l need to see what she saw.

575
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:00,679
请你帮帮我
Please.

576
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:08,762
这么做，可就没法回头了
You do this, there's no turning back.

577
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:12,642
你看见了他们
You see them. . .

578
01:04:13,653 --> 01:04:15,480
他们也看见了你
. . .they see you.

579
01:04:16,364 --> 01:04:18,357
明白吗？
Understand?

580
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,825
明白
Yeah.

581
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,833
好吧
Sure.

582
01:05:07,373 --> 01:05:11,869
我必须把所有的衣服都脱了么？
还是可以穿着？
So do l have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can l leave them on?

583
01:05:18,301 --> 01:05:19,961
约翰？
John?

584
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:22,212
我在考虑
l'm thinking.

585
01:05:26,225 --> 01:05:27,850
约翰？
John?

586
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:30,512
穿着吧
On is fine.

587
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:46,700
- 为什么用水？
- 水是万能的通道
-So why water?
-lt's a universal conduit.

588
01:05:47,121 --> 01:05:50,905
可以帮助穿越结界
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

589
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:55,377
- 接着问我地狱里有没有水
- 地狱里有没有水？
-Now ask me if there's water in hell.
-ls there water in hell?

590
01:05:57,173 --> 01:05:58,632
坐下
Sit.

591
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:04,256
通常只要身体的一部分浸入水中就可以了
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended. . .

592
01:06:06,933 --> 01:06:08,890
但是你想来个速成的
. . .but you wanted the crash course.

593
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,765
是的，我要速成的
Yeah, l wanted the crash course.

594
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,019
那么……
So. . . .

595
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,480
那会怎么样？
So, what's gonna happen?

596
01:06:16,651 --> 01:06:18,311
躺下
Lie down.

597
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:22,437
- 躺下？什么意思？
- 你必须完全浸入水中
-What do you mean lie down?
-You have to be fully submerged.

598
01:06:24,534 --> 01:06:25,945
要多长时间？
For how long?

599
01:06:26,661 --> 01:06:28,404
能坚持多久就多久
As long as it takes.

600
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:40,624
深吸一口气
Take a deep one.

601
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:25,192
哦，上帝
Oh, God.

602
01:08:25,863 --> 01:08:28,983
哦，上帝，所有这些人
Oh, God, all those people.

603
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:32,032
哦，伊莎贝尔
Oh, lsabel.

604
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:33,823
我总是知道
l've always known.

605
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:38,542
我总是知道它们在哪儿
我总是知道如何找到它们
l've always known where they are.
l've always known where to find them. . .

606
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:41,829
朝哪儿瞄准，在哪儿躲避
. . .where to aim and where to duck. . .

607
01:08:42,005 --> 01:08:43,914
我总是知道它们在哪儿
. . .and l've always known
where they were.

608
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,129
我知道那不是运气
l've always known that it wasn't luck.

609
01:08:46,301 --> 01:08:48,922
我知道那不是运气
我一直都知道……
Always known that it wasn't luck.
l've always known. . . .

610
01:08:49,095 --> 01:08:52,262
我一直都知道我能看见
l've always known that l could see.

611
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:57,770
我一直都知道我能看见
l've always known that l could see.

612
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:04,394
安吉拉
Angela.

613
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:10,606
有人来过
Someone was here.

614
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:38,518
那是他留下的
lt was his.

615
01:09:39,812 --> 01:09:41,686
转动着
Rolling.

616
01:09:43,775 --> 01:09:45,684
不是球
Not a ball.

617
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:49,314
是某种小一点的东西
Something smaller.

618
01:09:52,116 --> 01:09:53,741
闪着光
Shiny.

619
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:28,814
巴尔萨泽
Balthazar.

620
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,685
对不起
Sorry.

621
01:11:09,902 --> 01:11:12,061
要杀了他吗？？
Can you just kill him?

622
01:11:13,031 --> 01:11:14,359
那平衡怎么办？
What about the balance?

623
01:11:14,532 --> 01:11:18,197
当这些杂种开始杀我朋友的时候
平衡就已经被破坏了
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

624
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:20,825
我只是在天平的另一边加些砝码而已
l'm just adding some counterweight.

625
01:11:54,656 --> 01:11:56,778
约翰，我真的很想……
John, l really want--

626
01:12:02,872 --> 01:12:05,956
把它当作防弹衣
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

627
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:15,672
我要和你一起去
l'm coming with you.

628
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:19,467
你得呆在车里
You're staying in the car.

629
01:12:43,788 --> 01:12:46,742
火？我就是火里生的
Fire? l was born of this.

630
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:51,454
你这个烂杂种，告诉我
曼蒙到底要怎样跨越结界？
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

631
01:12:55,466 --> 01:12:58,918
这样更好，更自然
That's better. Au naturel.

632
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,267
“呆在车里”
''Stay in the car. ''

633
01:13:08,438 --> 01:13:10,810
“在这儿等”
''Wait here. ''

634
01:13:11,524 --> 01:13:12,852
受不了你
Men.

635
01:13:26,581 --> 01:13:27,992
别抗拒，小约翰
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

636
01:13:29,584 --> 01:13:31,576
好好享受
Enjoy it.

637
01:14:05,036 --> 01:14:08,820
我们马上就能见到你了
We'll see you very soon.

638
01:14:09,248 --> 01:14:11,075
你说错了
Not really, no.

639
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:16,411
这回你跑不掉的
你会回到地狱里去
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

640
01:14:16,589 --> 01:14:18,083
没错
True.

641
01:14:18,257 --> 01:14:19,586
可你却回不去了
But you're not.

642
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:24,048
- 你要干嘛？
- 我要给你做最后的超度
-What are you doing?
-l'm reading you your last rites.

643
01:14:24,222 --> 01:14:27,887
别对我用治疗咒语
Spare me your remedial incantations.

644
01:14:28,059 --> 01:14:30,384
你想知道真正被宽恕以后
会是什么样吗？
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

645
01:14:30,561 --> 01:14:33,099
被接纳进入神的王国
To be welcomed
into the Kingdom of God.

646
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,683
天堂里的魔鬼
Demon in heaven.

647
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:39,313
真想看看那时的情景
l'd love to be a fly on that wall.

648
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,734
你不是牧师，你没有法力
You're not a priest. You have no power.

649
01:14:45,118 --> 01:14:47,110
那你告诉我曼蒙打算怎样冲破结界
Just tell me how Mammon
is crossing over. . .

650
01:14:47,286 --> 01:14:50,371
我就让你滚回你的狗窝去
. . .and you can go back
to your shithole.

651
01:14:53,126 --> 01:14:56,577
好啊，不说是吧
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

652
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:11,682
“愿主怜悯你，饶恕你所有的罪孽”
''May God have mercy on you
and grant you the pardon of all your sins.

653
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:16,683
“不管犯下什么样的罪孽
都饶恕你，让你升入天堂”
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in heaven. ''

654
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,433
- 快说，他要怎样冲破结界？
- 不
-How? How's he doing it?
-No.

655
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:22,941
不，我不能说
No, l can't.

656
01:15:24,824 --> 01:15:28,158
“让你的子民找到通往天国的大门……”
Grant your child entry
into thy kingdom. . .

657
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:33,786
“以圣父、圣子和圣灵之名”
. . .in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

658
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:36,000
阿门！
Amen!

659
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:42,125
上帝的血
The blood of God.

660
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,628
他找到了
He found it.

661
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:48,055
只要杀死了上帝之子
Whatever killed the son of God. . .

662
01:15:48,222 --> 01:15:53,762
就能让魔鬼之子复活
. . .will give birth to the son of the devil.

663
01:15:55,897 --> 01:15:57,724
顺便说一句
By the way. . .

664
01:15:59,734 --> 01:16:03,648
只有经过赦免才能得到宽恕
. . .you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven. . .

665
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:05,811
笨蛋
. . .asshole.

666
01:16:09,744 --> 01:16:13,195
我的任务已经完成了
My work here is done.

667
01:16:14,582 --> 01:16:19,410
- 你笑什么？
- 我的任务就是她
-What are you laughing at?
-She was my only mission. . .

668
01:16:19,587 --> 01:16:23,799
而你正好把她带来了
. . .and you brought her right to us.

669
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:30,095
干嘛走这么快
是不是发现了什么？
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

670
01:16:30,264 --> 01:16:34,558
耶稣不是在十字架上被钉死的
而是被一个战士的矛刺死的
Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a
cross. He was killed by a soldier's spear.

671
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:36,886
命运之矛
The Spear of Destiny.

672
01:16:37,313 --> 01:16:40,018
我是个天主教徒，约翰
我知道耶稣受难的故事
l'm a Catholic, John.
l know the Crucifixion story.

673
01:16:48,908 --> 01:16:53,736
按您的吩咐，我引出了她的姐姐
l drew out the sister as you asked.

674
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:59,536
她的灵力已经被唤醒
She's been made flush and ready.

675
01:16:59,711 --> 01:17:03,459
好强的能量
So much power.

676
01:17:03,756 --> 01:17:08,964
如果您能让我复活
我愿意为您效忠
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
l shall serve.

677
01:17:11,556 --> 01:17:15,091
等等，我们说好的
Wait. But l did as we agreed.

678
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:18,886
不，不！
No. Please. No!

679
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:26,732
比曼说过
曼蒙需要神的帮助才能跨越结界
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

680
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:31,273
看来那就是上帝唯一的儿子的血
How's the blood of God's only son?

681
01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:33,948
矛上的血迹
The stains on the spear.

682
01:17:35,246 --> 01:17:38,117
- 是的
- 那么说他找到了矛
-Yeah.
-So he gets the spear.

683
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:40,449
他还要找一个很强的通灵者
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

684
01:17:41,627 --> 01:17:43,122
已经有了
Not really.

685
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:47,544
双胞胎
Twins.

686
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:51,129
护身符呢？
Where's the amulet?

687
01:17:52,388 --> 01:17:55,473
我不知道
肯定是落在车上了
l don't know,
l must have left it in the--

688
01:17:57,143 --> 01:17:58,471
怎么了？
What's wrong?

689
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,728
我不知道，只是觉得……
l don't know, l just feel--

690
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:34,303
- 梯子上的鸟
- 抱歉
-Bird on a ladder.
-Sorry.

691
01:18:39,894 --> 01:18:42,053
- 在这儿等
- 好的
-Wait here.
-Yeah.

692
01:18:45,274 --> 01:18:48,192
现在谁是穿裙子的老鼠了？啊？
狗娘养的
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

693
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:04,657
你连最后一点理智都没了么
Have you lost what little mind you have?

694
01:19:04,919 --> 01:19:06,497
别动
Don't.

695
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,132
我需要用那张椅子
l need to use the chair.

696
01:19:10,299 --> 01:19:14,344
我不会帮任何一边
l offer no aid to one side or the other.

697
01:19:15,346 --> 01:19:18,098
- 平衡
- 去他妈的平衡
-The balance.
-Screw the balance.

698
01:19:24,188 --> 01:19:26,679
你敢？在我这儿？
You dare? ln my house?

699
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:32,861
这也叫中立吗？狗屁！
ls this neutral? Bullshit.

700
01:19:33,072 --> 01:19:35,990
米耐，你是唯一一个还在按规矩做的人！
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

701
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,907
当你保持中立的时候
人们却在死去
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

702
01:19:40,413 --> 01:19:44,493
亨尼斯，比曼，他们曾经都是你的朋友
你不记得了么？
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once too, remember?

703
01:19:45,585 --> 01:19:48,290
我需要你的帮助！
l need your help!

704
01:19:50,423 --> 01:19:52,961
就当是最后的请求
Consider it a last request.

705
01:19:56,763 --> 01:19:59,598
你太冒险了
You play a dangerous game.

706
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:08,765
这件衬衫可要200美元
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

707
01:20:10,777 --> 01:20:15,439
那个小畜牲早就想走出
他父亲的阴影了
That little shit has been trying to climb
out of his father's shadow for eons.

708
01:20:15,615 --> 01:20:20,526
不敢想象要是他冲破结界的话
世界会变成什么样
l'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

709
01:20:23,623 --> 01:20:25,995
都忘了它有这么大
Forgot how big it was.

710
01:20:26,376 --> 01:20:30,788
在纽约新新监狱里
这张椅子曾经拷问了200个灵魂
Two hundred souls passed through
this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

711
01:20:30,963 --> 01:20:32,623
是的
Yeah.

712
01:20:35,843 --> 01:20:38,002
哪边是东？
Which way's east?

713
01:20:55,822 --> 01:20:58,491
多久没冲浪了？
How many years since you've surfed?

714
01:20:59,742 --> 01:21:01,699
就像骑自行车
Like riding a bike.

715
01:21:01,869 --> 01:21:03,862
没那么轻松
No, not really.

716
01:21:06,582 --> 01:21:09,370
希望这不是为了那女孩
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

717
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:14,917
绝对主要不是为了那女孩
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

718
01:21:21,306 --> 01:21:22,716
好冷
Cold.

719
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:25,013
来一口？
Little flavor?

720
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:50,409
- 准备好了？
- 不
-Sure about this?
-No.

721
01:22:40,593 --> 01:22:42,253
米耐！
Midnite!

722
01:22:47,976 --> 01:22:51,095
- 找到了么？
- 找到了
-Any luck?
-That's a word for it.

723
01:22:51,437 --> 01:22:54,853
老天，这不是米耐老爹吗？
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

724
01:23:02,615 --> 01:23:06,992
你到底打算怎么用这些？
要离得很近才行
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

725
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,247
她的周围肯定有人守卫
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

726
01:23:12,417 --> 01:23:14,077
当杂种的外皮被圣水浇裂之后
Half-breeds are most vulnerable. . .

727
01:23:14,252 --> 01:23:18,202
他们是非常脆弱的
. . .when their outer skin is breached
by holy water.

728
01:23:18,673 --> 01:23:22,006
可以用某些圣物
特别是伊斯塔利亚十字架
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of lsteria. . .

729
01:23:22,176 --> 01:23:24,667
即使是没有正式受命的牧师
也可以用它来把……
. . .have been used by even
the unordained to bless. . .

730
01:23:24,846 --> 01:23:26,719
普通的水……
. . .commonly occurring waters. . .

731
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:28,633
甚至是雨水，变成圣水
. . .even rain.

732
01:23:29,183 --> 01:23:30,559
也许如果……
Maybe if. . . .

733
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:38,641
如果没有为比赛做好准备
干坐在候补席上也是没用的，对吗？
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

734
01:23:38,818 --> 01:23:42,685
我们为什么不从橱柜里
拿一支施有魔法的十字架
You wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet. . .

735
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:44,940
带在身上用呢？
. . .maybe we could take with us?

736
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:49,654
约翰，我无意冒犯
我只是提点建议，我觉得……
Look, John, no offense, l just don't think
that it's a great idea, you know. . .

737
01:23:49,829 --> 01:23:53,163
你这样单枪匹马去拯救世界
这么做并不聪明
. . .you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

738
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:56,002
我不知道他怎么想
可是……
l don't know what pops thinks,
but that's--

739
01:23:57,337 --> 01:24:00,373
把他带上吧，约翰
完事之后再把他杀了
Take him, John. Kill him after.

740
01:24:05,511 --> 01:24:09,805
如果你能回来
来找我，或许我能让你成为会员
lf you get back, see me
about membership. Maybe.

741
01:24:09,974 --> 01:24:12,892
好的，我会的
Okay. l will.

742
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:19,937
- 你在干嘛？
- 祈祷
-What are you doing?
-Praying.

743
01:24:20,109 --> 01:24:23,063
祈祷，好吧
Praying. Okay.

744
01:24:23,988 --> 01:24:25,648
来吧
Come on.

745
01:25:22,672 --> 01:25:24,214
杂种，对吗？
Half-breeds, right?

746
01:25:27,093 --> 01:25:31,589
他们肯定守护着她，对吗？
肯定是的
A birth like this, they're definitely
gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

747
01:25:32,015 --> 01:25:33,509
对
Yeah.

748
01:25:36,519 --> 01:25:41,015
我们能够解决他们
我是说，十字架会起作用的，对吗？
We can get through them. l mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

749
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:42,851
对吗？
Right?

750
01:25:43,192 --> 01:25:46,561
现实和书本不完全一样
lt's not always like it is in the books.

751
01:26:34,952 --> 01:26:36,696
那是什么？
What is that?

752
01:26:37,205 --> 01:26:39,197
地狱的声音
Hellspeak.

753
01:26:41,834 --> 01:26:43,910
你知道该怎么做了
You know what to do.

754
01:26:47,173 --> 01:26:48,833
没问题
l'm okay.

755
01:26:50,677 --> 01:26:52,420
好的
Sure.

756
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:06,853
最后一次演出
One last show.

757
01:27:40,768 --> 01:27:42,393
嗨
Hi.

758
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:44,307
我的名字叫约翰
My name's John.

759
01:27:46,566 --> 01:27:50,065
你们破坏了平衡
You are in violation of the balance.

760
01:27:50,903 --> 01:27:53,276
立刻离开
Leave immediately. . .

761
01:27:53,573 --> 01:27:56,242
否则，我将把你们驱逐
. . .or l will deport you.

762
01:27:58,202 --> 01:28:00,029
你们所有的人
All of you.

763
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:09,329
去死吧
Go to hell.

764
01:28:14,969 --> 01:28:16,428
圣水？
Holy water?

765
01:29:34,132 --> 01:29:36,338
安吉拉
Angela.

766
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:10,291
约翰？
John?

767
01:30:12,587 --> 01:30:13,915
约翰
John.

768
01:30:19,677 --> 01:30:21,219
妈的
Shit.

769
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:47,954
拉住！
Pull!

770
01:31:28,871 --> 01:31:30,200
安吉拉
Angela.

771
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:55,853
安吉拉，怎么了？
Angela, what is it?

772
01:32:02,572 --> 01:32:04,861
把它赶出来
Get it out.

773
01:32:18,338 --> 01:32:19,880
把它赶出来
Get it out.

774
01:32:20,465 --> 01:32:22,504
把它……
Get it--

775
01:33:06,469 --> 01:33:07,797
哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

776
01:33:15,061 --> 01:33:16,639
干得不赖，孩子
Not bad, kid.

777
01:33:19,649 --> 01:33:21,641
“干得不赖”
你听到了吗？
''Not bad. '' You hear that?

778
01:33:21,818 --> 01:33:26,230
知道为什么吗？因为我是克莱默
查斯・克莱默，混……
You know why that is? lt's because
this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, ass--

779
01:33:34,122 --> 01:33:36,031
查斯
Chas.

780
01:33:44,048 --> 01:33:46,622
你说得没错，约翰
You're right, John.

781
01:33:47,885 --> 01:33:49,593
和书上不一样
lt's not like the books.

782
01:33:50,763 --> 01:33:52,423
不……
No. . .

783
01:33:53,349 --> 01:33:55,176
不一样
. . .it isn't.

784

现身吧，我命令你

785
01:34:19,959 --> 01:34:23,411
现身吧，我命令你
lnto the light, l command thee.

786
01:34:24,547 --> 01:34:28,675
现身吧，我命令你
lnto the light, l command thee.

787
01:34:33,222 --> 01:34:36,841
现身吧，我命令你
lnto the light, l command thee.

788
01:34:40,063 --> 01:34:42,933
你的能量令我吃惊
Your ego is astounding.

789
01:34:43,107 --> 01:34:44,899
加百列
Gabriel.

790
01:34:45,068 --> 01:34:46,396
不出所料
Figures.

791
01:34:47,612 --> 01:34:51,028
邪恶将接管地球
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

792
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,606
你是在审判我吗？约翰
You judging me now, John?

793
01:34:54,869 --> 01:34:58,867
背叛，谋杀，种族灭绝
却说我狭隘
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

794
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,990
我只是想唤醒人类
让他们看到后果
l am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

795
01:35:03,419 --> 01:35:07,084
通过把地球拱手让给恶魔之子？
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

796
01:35:07,799 --> 01:35:09,127
杀了我吧
Help me here.

797
01:35:13,179 --> 01:35:17,473
你被赋予了这种宝贵的天赋，对吗？
You're handed this precious gift, right?

798
01:35:18,685 --> 01:35:22,729
造物主允许你们每个人赎罪
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

799
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:26,269

Murderers, rapists and molesters. . .

800
01:35:26,442 --> 01:35:28,768

只要忏悔
. . .all of you, you just have to repent. . .

801
01:35:28,945 --> 01:35:31,780
上帝就会伸出双手迎接你们

802
01:35:34,117 --> 01:35:36,358
茫茫宇宙，大千世界
ln all the worlds in all the universe. . .

803

除了人类以外
没有哪种生物能以此为傲
. . .no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

804
01:35:41,916 --> 01:35:43,245
这不公平
lt's not fair.

805
01:35:47,422 --> 01:35:51,371
如果好心的上帝这么爱你们
lf sweet, sweet God loves you so. . .

806
01:35:51,551 --> 01:35:54,552
那我就要让你们值得被他爱
. . .then l'll make you worthy of his love.

807
01:35:56,222 --> 01:35:59,342
我盯着你很久了
l've been watching you for a long time.

808
01:35:59,517 --> 01:36:04,179
只有面对恐惧的时候
你才能真正找到你高贵的自我
lt's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

809
01:36:04,355 --> 01:36:08,187
你才能变得那么的高贵
And you can be so noble.

810
01:36:10,903 --> 01:36:12,481
因此
So. . .

811
01:36:13,156 --> 01:36:15,481
我要给你带来痛苦
. . .l'll bring you pain.

812
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,531
带来恐惧
l'll bring you horror.

813
01:36:20,246 --> 01:36:23,330
这样你才能战胜它们
So that you may rise above it.

814
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:30,709
这样，那些从人间地狱中存活下来的人
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth. . .

815
01:36:30,882 --> 01:36:33,836
才值得拥有上帝的爱

816
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:35,801
加百列
Gabriel. . .

817
01:36:36,262 --> 01:36:38,504
你疯了
. . .you're insane.

818
01:36:40,433 --> 01:36:43,636
拯救将在今晚展开
The road to salvation begins tonight.

819
01:36:44,437 --> 01:36:46,145
就现在
Right now.

820
01:37:27,814 --> 01:37:30,815
我知道你不喜欢我
l know l'm not one of your favorites.

821
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,112
你甚至不欢迎我进你的家门
l'm not even welcome in your house.

822
01:37:36,698 --> 01:37:39,533
我能引起你些许的注意吗？
But l could use a little attention.

823
01:37:42,829 --> 01:37:44,537
恳求你
Please.

824
01:38:30,918 --> 01:38:33,291

快点

826

曼蒙……
Mammon. . .

827
01:39:14,212 --> 01:39:16,667
撒旦之子
. . .son of Satan. . .

828
01:39:16,839 --> 01:39:21,300
我来把你放入这个世界

不介意吧？

837
01:40:45,803 --> 01:40:48,176
哦，可以，随意
我有时间

和你很配，约翰
Very fitting, John.

840
01:40:55,855 --> 01:40:59,390
知道吗，割得太深会割断肌腱
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons. . .

841
01:40:59,567 --> 01:41:02,354
手指就不听使唤了
. . .finger movement goes
out the window.

842

看到了吗？

844
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:20,831
小宝贝……

我为你准备了一整座主题公园
让你好好快活

哦，你真好
Well, aren't you a peach.

847

我想，你不会再犯同样的错误了吧
l didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

848
01:41:38,898 --> 01:41:40,855
你不会的
And you didn't. . .

849
01:41:41,609 --> 01:41:43,353
是不是？
. . .did you?

850
01:41:43,653 --> 01:41:45,277
你家里都好吗？
So how's the family?

有些爱好真的没法解释

又想和我玩什么花样？

该回家了，儿子

好像某人不再支持你了

让她回家

so she can go to heaven?

884
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:10,119

你不应该成为人类

925
01:52:23,459 --> 01:52:25,251
就知道没那么简单
Always a catch.

926
01:52:26,713 --> 01:52:28,290
是啊
Yeah.

927
01:52:41,394 --> 01:52:43,221
那么
So.

928
01:52:44,856 --> 01:52:47,892
我想洗个澡
l've got some cleaning up to do.

929
01:52:51,738 --> 01:52:53,730
我们……
l'll. . .

930
01:52:53,906 --> 01:52:56,195
再见吧
. . .see you around.

931
01:52:58,703 --> 01:53:00,612
好啊
l'd like that.

932
01:53:30,610 --> 01:53:33,480
我想，我们每个人都自有安排
I guess there's a plan for all of us.

933
01:53:33,655 --> 01:53:35,232
我死了两次
I had to die...

934
01:53:35,406 --> 01:53:36,735
才明白
... twice...

935
01:53:36,908 --> 01:53:39,114
这个道理
...just to figure that out.

936
01:53:39,285 --> 01:53:44,280
就像书上说的，冥冥中自有安排
Like the book says, he works his work
in mysterious ways.

937
01:53:44,457 --> 01:53:46,615
有些人喜欢
Some people like it...

938
01:53:46,793 --> 01:53:49,331
有些人不喜欢
...some people don 't.

939
01:59:42,732 --> 01:59:44,855
你做得很好，孩子
You did good, kid.
