[Lori Jo] <i>Talk, talk.</i>

4
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,840
Hello there, everybody.

5
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,383
-That sounds good to me...
-[Lori Jo] <i>Okay.</i>

6
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,427
-...through my earphones...
-[Lori Jo] <i>All right. Good.</i>

7
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,345
[Lori Jo] <i>The boom's a little loud.</i>
<i>I'll turn that down.</i>

8
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,722
<i>Just give me a second.</i>

9
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,931
[dog barking]

10
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:57,849
[Norm] <i>Lori Jo.</i>

11
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,018
Do you like where my hand comes in?

12
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,686
[Lori Jo] <i>I'm not watching the camera.</i>

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,771
Oh. Okay.

14
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,191
-[Lori Jo] <i>Testing, testing.</i>
-[Norm] <i>Testing, testing.</i>

15
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,650
[Norm] <i>We don't know where...</i>

16
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,736
-[Lori Jo] <i>You were talking about...</i>
-[Norm] <i>I know where.</i>

17
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,695
[Norm] <i>Okay.</i>

18
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,865
Hey, everybody.
It's Norm Macdonald.

19
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,785
And this is my comedy special.

20
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,952
That's right.

21
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:21,539
Now, of course I'm looking forward
to getting back out there, you know.

22
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,209
Seeing you folks in person, you know.

23
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,502
I love doing gigs.

24
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,796
And I miss it. My God, I miss it.

25
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,672
Especially casinos.

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,257
Those were my favorite gigs

27
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:36,095
because I'm a degenerate gambler
as it turns out.

28
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,848
I think the casinos know that.

29
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,392
Often they'll pay me in chips.

30
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,854
Which I find... that's not nice, you know?

31
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,441
Sometimes they'll just give me
a real big chip.

32
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,943
They'll go, "Here you go!"

33
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,028
Then they break it in half.
They go, "Have fun!"

34
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,696
I go, "Goddamn, guys."

35
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,698
That's not nice.

36
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,244
But, anyways,

37
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,330
I prefer the Indian casinos.

38
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,581
That's what I like.

39
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,334
You know? Because
I don't want to give my money...

40
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,670
If I'm gonna lose money,
and I'm gonna lose money,

41
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:14,259
I don't want to do it in Las Vegas
to a bunch of corporate businessmen.

42
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,678
I would rather go to an Indian casino

43
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,517
and lose it to the Native Americans.

44
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,685
You know?

45
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:28,064
On account of my forefathers

46
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,403
systematically murdered them
years ago.

47
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,323
Which looking back on it...
way out of line.

48
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,284
Way out of line.

49
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:44,164
Anyways, I look at it
as a form of reparations. You know?

50
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,666
I tell you, I've done my part,
Goddamn it.

51
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,334
Probably done your part too.

52
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,298
Anyways... I love casinos.

53
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,717
I was in Las Vegas,
the last time I was there...

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,053
People go to Vegas sometimes
and they got a system. You know?

55
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,973
They go, "I got a system,
I'm gonna break the bank

56
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,684
'cause I figured out a system."

57
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:10,273
And oftentimes these systems
actually do not work at all.

58
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:15,653
And I think that I saw

59
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,615
the unraveling of a system.

60
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,078
Sometimes all you need to hear
is like a snippet of conversation

61
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:29,709
and you can infer
from that information, more.

62
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,961
You know what I'm saying?
For instance,

63
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:36,174
one time I walked past
these two homeless guys.

64
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,800
One guy said to the other,

65
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,305
"When the fuck were you ever goaltender
for the Montreal Canadians?"

66
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,767
He was tired of the horseshit.
It was the last straw.

67
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,811
But anyways, I think I heard

68
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:53,483
what was the unraveling
of a system.

69
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,027
On account of I got in the elevator,

70
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,946
it was going down,

71
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,574
and then a couple got on,
a man and a woman.

72
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,077
And then tension, you know?

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,787
So it was just the four of us.

74
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,414
And we're going down the elevator.

75
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,417
Out of the blue, out of nowhere,

76
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,586
the man says to the woman,

77
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,089
"I don't give a fuck what I said,
give me the money."

78
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,508
"That's my money."

79
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,929
So I believe, I'm only inferring,

80
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,807
once again, I have no proof that that...

81
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,351
But here's the thing about gambling.

82
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,895
It's irrational, you know?

83
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,691
You gotta-- you can't be rational
to actually gamble,

84
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,985
because it doesn't make no sense,
you know?

85
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:42,198
And I remember I was at the--
one time I got...

86
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,618
I went-- I was walking down

87
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,829
and I saw a roulette table.

88
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,666
Now, I don't know if you know
the game of roulette.

89
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,918
How could you not know
the game of roulette?

90
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:54,961
[laughs]

91
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,337
It's not that hard.

92
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:01,301
But anyways,
I put a hundred dollars on black.

93
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:06,848
You know? And the little silver ball
spun around the wheel and everything,

94
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,559
and then it landed on red.

95
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,227
This is what I said,

96
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,313
"Fuck, I almost picked that!"

97
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,400
But I do miss being out on the road,
you know?

98
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,153
Seeing you folks live, you know?

99
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,823
I mean, I'm all alone looking in the TV.

100
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,366
It doesn't make much sense.

101
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,619
But what-- that's what it is.

102
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,456
You know, I'll tell you one thing
I don't miss is airplanes.

103
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,915
I don't like airplanes.

104
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,876
I finally figured out why.

105
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,963
After years of therapy I figured out
why I don't care for the airplanes.

106
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:43,551
I don't like the crashing and dying
in the airplane.

107
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,262
That's what it is.
You know?

108
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:50,641
Hey, by the way, I got a little tip
for you if you fly on an airplane.

109
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,311
Always pick the exit row.

110
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,021
Choose the exit row.

111
00:05:55,605 --> 00:06:01,110
That way you get the extra two,
three inches of legroom.

112
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:08,034
And all you have to do
to get the exit row is to lie.

113
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,453
That's right.

114
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,497
You just lie.

115
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,500
You know?
The stewardess comes up.

116
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,959
Flight attendant!

117
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,127
[laughs]

118
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,755
Flight attendant.

119
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,967
I apologize. Words are different now.

120
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,554
When I was young,
if you were a flight attendant,

121
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,765
and you were a lady,

122
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,351
we would call you a stewardess.

123
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:37,146
And, if you were a flight attendant
and you were a man,

124
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,023
we would call you a...

125
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,651
Wait, what?

126
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,028
What are you guys thinking?

127
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,363
Good Lord!

128
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,740
What's wrong with you? I'm outraged.

129
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,534
I'm outraged, I tell you.

130
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,745
I'm outraged at what you are thinking

131
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,456
just 'cause I pause for a second.

132
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,291
I was going to say a steward.

133
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,544
If you were a flight attendant
and you were a male,

134
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,838
we used to call you a steward.

135
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,797
You know?

136
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,258
But words have changed, folks.

137
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,093
That's the way things go, man.

138
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,262
They are always gonna be different.

139
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,721
You know, words, they change.

140
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,558
That's why I can't understand
goddamn Shakespeare.

141
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,559
You know?

142
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,520
I remember one time
when I was a little boy,

143
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,649
I went up to my dad.
I said, "Dad, I think I'm a little girl."

144
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,568
And he said,
"I thought you had a cock."

145
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,446
I was like, "Oh, yeah. You got me."

146
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,491
Now, the only reason I tell you that

147
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,454
is to show how hateful we were back then.

148
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,872
You know what I'm saying?

149
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,168
My dad-- now, every person knows
that people are nuanced.

150
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,004
They're not all evil or all good.
You know?

151
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,631
My dad did good stuff, you know?

152
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,884
He was in the Second World War.

153
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,510
You know, he fought Hitler.

154
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,641
I mean, he had help. It wasn't like
he had a fistfight with Hitler.

155
00:07:55,725 --> 00:08:00,646
But I'm saying he liberated us
from what could have been

156
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,025
the icy grip of Nazism.

157
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,318
How about that?

158
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,945
So that was his good side, you know?

159
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,950
His evil side was this crazy idea he had

160
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,287
that having a cock had something to do
with being a boy.

161
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,917
I don't even know where he could come up
with such an idea.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,005
Nowadays, we can't even wrap our heads
around that kind of thinking.

163
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,175
But people used to actually think that.

164
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,551
Isn't that something?

165
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:36,098
Now, in other ways,
my father was very progressive.

166
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,852
For instance,
we had a gender neutral bathroom.

167
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,230
You know? I used it, my brother used it,

168
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,273
my sister used it, my mother used it.

169
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,109
Anybody. It didn't matter
what gender you were.

170
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,987
You know what I was way ahead on?

171
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,364
Slut-shaming.

172
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,867
I was always, always against that.

173
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,078
I remember telling the fellas
in high school, I'd go,

174
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,289
"Guys, I think we're making
a big mistake

175
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,208
by shaming the sluts."

176
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,670
You see, here's what is my concern.

177
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:10,800
I feel if we shame them too much
they might stop becoming sluts.

178
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,884
You know?

179
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:17,056
And further ladies
might not want to be sluts either.

180
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,641
I have a different idea.

181
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:24,480
Other than shaming the sluts,
it's a different, it's a bold idea,

182
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,401
I say we take the sluts
and we put them on our shoulders.

183
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,280
And we go, "Oh, hail the slut!"

184
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,116
<i>♪ For she's a jolly good slut ♪</i>

185
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,867
That kind of thing, you know?

186
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,162
So I was way ahead of it, man,
way ahead of it.

187
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,790
But anyway, that's not what
I was talking about.

188
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,293
What the hell was I talking about?
Oh, yeah, the airplane.

189
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,211
Yes, yes, the airplane.

190
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,590
Man, I don't understand it, you know?

191
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,134
They make all their announcements,
you know?

192
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,635
What are they?

193
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,805
Why do they think we still believe
that horseshit?

194
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,724
You know? I heard one.

195
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,893
I guess I just zone out
because I haven't heard it before.

196
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,689
They say, "If your oxygen masks
happen to fall,

197
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:11,110
make sure to put
your oxygen mask on first

198
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,739
before you put the oxygen mask
of the little boy."

199
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,867
And then, I'd go,
"Yeah, that was my fucking plan.

200
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,202
You didn't have to tell everybody,
blabbermouth."

201
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,041
I don't know why
they think we're going to believe them.

202
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,501
They'll say, "Listen...

203
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,838
I know we're flying over
the Pacific Ocean,

204
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:37,136
but don't worry, on account of if we
happen to crash into the Pacific ocean,

205
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,723
the seat cushions
are not only seat cushions,

206
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,893
they are also boats."

207
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,438
Yep, they're boats.

208
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,609
All the time, you turn on the TV
and the guy goes,

209
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,654
"Well, a plane crashed in the Atlantic,
but it's all right,

210
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:59,950
everybody listened to that lady
so they're all on their boats."

211
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,329
People are going,
"Goddamn, why'd I buy that boat?

212
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,290
I should have just got a fleet
of seat cushions.

213
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,334
I would have saved all kinds of money."

214
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,671
[small chuckle]

215
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,298
Here's the thing. If you crash,

216
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,966
let's be honest for a second.

217
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,220
If you crash in an airplane,
you got zero chance of survival.

218
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,681
They'll take pictures of crash sites,
take videos.

219
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,059
You know? And they don't
even see anything.

220
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:30,731
Because at that point
you become just dematerialized.

221
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,110
You know? You're nothing,
you're stuff, basically.

222
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,781
"Ashes to ashes, stuff to stuff,"
as the Scriptures say.

223
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,200
You know? And, uh...

224
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:46,455
and then the victims, they're called
remains, you know, but stuff.

225
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,292
And the victims' families
always want the remains.

226
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:55,589
They go, "Oh, I can't go to sleep because
I keep thinking of poor Kevin

227
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,217
and his last moments on this Earth.

228
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,304
Spiraling downwards
towards certain death. Oh!

229
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,766
Oh, if only I could see his remains.

230
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,602
Then I'd have a good sleep.

231
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,814
Oh, I'd sleep soundly that night.

232
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,109
Then I get closure
and just forget this whole thing."

233
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,862
I don't understand it,
but that's what they say.

234
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,615
And really, do you think you're going to
get Kevin if you're Kevin's mother?

235
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,826
Do you think they're going to go
on a plane and go,

236
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,995
"Hey, look at that. Look over there.

237
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,415
Doesn't that look like Kevin's hair?

238
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:34,211
That lock of golden blonde--
That looks like Kevin's hair."

239
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,047
"Fred, didn't you see
Kevin's thigh bone earlier?

240
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,257
Let's reconstruct him."

241
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,217
No, that's not what they do.

242
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,343
You know?

243
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,097
Best thing they can do,
maybe they'll find your ID.

244
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,518
"Look, it says Norm Macdonald.

245
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,688
It says he weighs 190 pounds.

246
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,942
Okay, shovel 190 pounds
of stuff into a bag

247
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,279
and write Norm on the side of that one,

248
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,697
and hurry up.

249
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,451
Daylight's burning
and his mother wants it."

250
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,994
Then my mother gets it.

251
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:11,415
"Oh, look at that! That's Norm.
How about that?

252
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,918
I don't remember Norm having three ears.

253
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,629
Oh, well.

254
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:21,133
I guess none of us really knew him
when you get down to it."

255
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:27,848
The only time it seems you ever survive
an airplane crash

256
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,392
is if you crash into the Andes.

257
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,645
You know? That's even worse.

258
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:37,775
Because, you know, you--
then you have to fight

259
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,111
with the moral quandary of cannibalism.

260
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,989
Which I am against, by the way.

261
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,492
If you know anything about my work,

262
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:53,916
you will know my tireless devotion
to the anti-cannibalism cause.

263
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,169
But I'm not going to use this
as a bully pulpit.

264
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:02,049
Most of you are adults and you've cemented
your views on cannibalism.

265
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,468
I like to go for the kids, you know?

266
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,636
The young people.

267
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,014
I go all across this great country,
and I go to the schools

268
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,016
and I talk to the children, you know?

269
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,601
And I tell them, I go, "Listen...

270
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:18,774
you might think it's cool to eat
your buddy in Algebra class.

271
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,987
I'm not going to lie to you, you will be
the talk of the school for a few years,

272
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,698
but what about the future?

273
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,575
What about the future?" I tell them.

274
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,996
Here's the problem with crashing
in the Andes

275
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,876
and having to resort to cannibalism is
they take so long to decide.

276
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,085
You know what I mean?

277
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:42,590
They go, "Oh, I don't want to eat a guy!
Oh, I can't do it." You know?

278
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,841
And, uh...

279
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,261
"I can't eat the copilot, I can't do it."
You know?

280
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:51,390
And then days go by, I go,
"Hey, maybe we should eat the copilot."

281
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,850
You know? And, uh...

282
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:57,605
finally, they are maddened by hunger
and they just attack...

283
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,647
[screams]

284
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,319
And they got copilot blood all over them,
copilot viscera

285
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,031
falling out of their mouth on their
pink shirts, you know?

286
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,532
And...

287
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,826
that's no way to eat.

288
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,371
You can't gorge.

289
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,165
Any dietician will tell you.

290
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,625
You cannot gorge.

291
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,170
The thing to do is graze.
That's the right way to eat.

292
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,171
You know?

293
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:26,550
You wake up, you have a small meal
of copilot.

294
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:32,514
Then, around lunchtime,
you have a small meal of copilot.

295
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,102
Then, around I think about six times
during the whole day,

296
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,273
you have a small portion of copilot.

297
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,320
Any dietician will tell you, I tell you,

298
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,863
not that I'm a dietician.

299
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,240
I don't pretend to be a dietician.

300
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,785
Well, sometimes I do, but...

301
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,245
it's only to get the ladies, you know?

302
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,122
The big fat ladies.

303
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:02,586
I go up, I go, "Hey, you want to go
on a diet? On account of I'm a dietician."

304
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,297
And then they leave with me sometimes.

305
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,593
Sometimes they just get angry, you know?

306
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,761
I don't know.

307
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,225
But, I don't even know
what I was talking about.

308
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,769
Weren't we talking about slut-shaming?

309
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,937
I don't know.

310
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,355
Nobody knows anymore.

311
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,233
Oh, I know, yes, the airplane!

312
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,861
Yes. You know, you... this is the thing.

313
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,573
You gotta be ready for anything
life throws you in this here world.

314
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,867
That's what I've learned as I've aged.

315
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,328
You know? And I'm ready. Like cannibalism?

316
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,707
I know what I would do in the Andes
on account of

317
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,209
I've thought it over.

318
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,211
I've thought over my position.

319
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,629
You see what I mean?

320
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,466
Like I flew in from Vegas,
I remember, one time,

321
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,719
and there was some turbulence.

322
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,763
And I was like,
"I'm eating that fucking fourteen year--"

323
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,559
[dog barking]

324
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,564
The thing is, you got to be ready.

325
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:08,152
You got to be ready for anything this
world throws at you. You know?

326
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,447
And, you know...
and I am, you know?

327
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,909
Like, I remember one time I was flying
from Vegas to LA

328
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,578
and there was a little turbulence,

329
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:22,916
and I remember I said,
"I'm going to eat that fucker in 14-A."

330
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,127
Oh, that guy looked delicious.

331
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,295
[smacks lips]

332
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,421
Big fat guy!

333
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,339
[laughs]

334
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:36,680
But, anyways,
enough of this grim nonsense.

335
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,850
You know what I mean?
We got problems in this country.

336
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,270
For instance, systematic racism.

337
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,231
And here's the problem,
nobody thinks they're racist.

338
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,192
I remember I was in Portland one time.

339
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,777
Portland, Oregon.

340
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:54,823
And the driver picked me up
to take me to the gig.

341
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,076
I got off the airplane,
the driver's driving.

342
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,329
And we're driving through downtown
Portland and he says,

343
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,166
"You know, we got no racists in Portland.
No racism at all."

344
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,961
And I looked around, everyone was white.

345
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,213
You know? [chuckles]

346
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:13,842
So I said to the guy, I said,
"Well, it's pretty easy not be racist

347
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,636
when everybody's white."

348
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,723
And then the guy says to me, he goes,
"We got our share."

349
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,518
I'm like, "Good Lord!"

350
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,228
"We got our share."

351
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,395
That's not right.

352
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:32,653
Why are all-- not all,
but a lot of drivers for some reason,

353
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,405
like taxi drivers and something,

354
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,991
turn out to be racists, you know?

355
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,285
That's what I hear a lot of,
'cause I don't drive,

356
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,079
so I'll get in a cab and the guy'll go,

357
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,039
"You know what's wrong
with this country, don't you?"

358
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,542
And I go, "I got an idea. So what is it?"

359
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:52,256
You ever have it when the guy says it
and you don't even know which race it is?

360
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,757
Like I had a guy once, he goes,

361
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,425
"You know what's the problem
in this country?"

362
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,261
I go, "Tell me."

363
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,389
He goes, "Too many goddamn scuddleheads."

364
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,766
I was like, "Huh?"

365
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,812
So I looked it up in the dictionary,
in Wikipedia.

366
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,021
Everywhere.

367
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,439
I found scuddle.

368
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,732
I found head.

369
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,360
And I tried to put them together.
I couldn't understand it.

370
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,321
I've asked people of every race.

371
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,325
And no one has ever heard
of the term "scuddlehead."

372
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:26,915
By the way, I would be fine if we just
blamed all our problems

373
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,126
on the scuddleheads.

374
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,962
You know what I mean?
Just make them the scapegoats.

375
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,130
Why not?

376
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:37,301
As a matter of fact, why not make
the goats the scapegoats?

377
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,510
Like in the old days.

378
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,138
Yeah, sacrifice a goat.

379
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,598
Make it his problem.

380
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,476
He's-- that's the one that's at fault.

381
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,729
That goat eating a tin can.

382
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,233
But anyways,
I'm not here to talk about goats.

383
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,985
I don't know why I'm here.

384
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,445
[soft chuckle]

385
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,781
You know what I've noticed lately?
Everybody has an opinion.

386
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,408
And I, you know,

387
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,328
when I was young,
it wasn't that way, you know?

388
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,165
People would have maybe, I don't know,
six opinions. You know?

389
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,211
Sometime you'd meet a guy,
he'd have eight opinions.

390
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,713
You'd go, "Goddamn!
That guy's opinionated!"

391
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,718
But about six opinions... and most
of them were about food, you know?

392
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,637
To tell you the truth.

393
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,932
People would go, "Count Chocula?
What the fuck's wrong with you?"

394
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,016
Stuff like that.

395
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,770
You know, I mean, I have opinions...

396
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,481
I mean, I have opinions
that everybody holds.

397
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,983
You know? Like, I don't know.

398
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,861
Yellow's the best color. You know?

399
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,739
I don't know if you'd call that
an opinion. It's just a...

400
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,115
[phone ringing]

401
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,742
Oh, hold on, it's my phone.

402
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,702
[phone continues ringing]

403
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,413
Hello.

404
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,834
I got to phone you back on account of
I'm doing a special.

405
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,296
On the TV. Comedy special.

406
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,798
So I'll call you back, okay?

407
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,841
Okay.

408
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,262
Sorry about that, guys.

409
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:08,267
Anyways, I was saying,
I don't got really no opinions

410
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,979
and I know a lot of people
don't have opinions

411
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,855
on account of I see it on the TV.

412
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,400
Like, I'll watch CNN
and they'll ask a question.

413
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,277
Sometimes it's tough. They'll say,

414
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,865
"What do you think of that
Southeast Asian sea treaty?

415
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:28,704
How do you think that'll affect the gross
national product of Singapore?"

416
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,080
And...

417
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,084
Anyways, at the end
they ask that question.

418
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,837
"Do you think it's good, yes or no?"

419
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,757
And then at the end they show the answer.
I'm a sucker for a poll.

420
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:46,013
So, I always like to-- I take, you know,
I take part in...

421
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,932
at the end you always see the same thing.

422
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:53,603
It'll be like, they'll show the poll and
it's in like a pie chart.

423
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,189
You'll go, "Goddamn!
I wish I had some pie!"

424
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,193
Anyway, they show a pie chart and it will
be like 45 percent yes.

425
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,070
45 percent no.

426
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,157
Ten percent: "I don't know."

427
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,076
So that's fine, you know?

428
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,371
I'm not ashamed of being part
of the ten percent.

429
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,250
You know? Sounds small,
but ten percent of this great country,

430
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:20,714
that's 35 million people that don't know.
That's fine.

431
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,426
And I'm a sucker, man, I always...

432
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,387
anytime I see
one of those polls, I phone up.

433
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,141
I go, "Hello, is this the TV?

434
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,227
Yeah, you asked a question earlier.

435
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,855
I don't know.

436
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,899
I don't know the answer to the question.

437
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,028
Listen, I got a question for you.

438
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,280
What did that second word mean, anyway?

439
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,657
It did?

440
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,784
[chuckles]

441
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:53,872
All right, I better end up in that poll
that looks like a pie, fella.

442
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,249
I'm no sap."

443
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,294
And then I hang up... my phone.

444
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,383
But, I tell you, man, you got to,
especially when elections are around,

445
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,927
you got to have a lot of...

446
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,305
When you're a comedian,
they expect you to know things nowadays.

447
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,349
You know what I mean?
It didn't used to be like that.

448
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,726
During the Vietnam War,
they wouldn't go,

449
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,312
"I wonder what Red Skelton
thinks on this."

450
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,148
But nowadays, I've heard-- they go,

451
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,401
"A comedian is
the modern-day philosopher."

452
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,361
You know?

453
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:31,243
First of all, it always makes me feel sad
for the actual modern-day philosophers

454
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,744
who exist, you know?

455
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:38,542
They're working, trying to come up
with their philosophy and they go,

456
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,751
"Goddamn!

457
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,421
You ever hear of this night club comic?

458
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:48,593
He's doing some very good work on
'totaligism'" or what the hell...

459
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,554
[chuckles] Whatever you say...

460
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:56,226
I'll tell you, when the election cycle
starts, this is what I've noticed.

461
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,644
They're very difficult.

462
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,272
Because they are trying to get the people
that are smart,

463
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,439
that know things.

464
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,234
The people that know, because they are
90 percent, remember?

465
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,361
I don't know people are only ten percent.

466
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:10,949
So, they will try to get you

467
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:15,704
with very hard,
very difficult commercials.

468
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,330
I've seen them, you know?

469
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,915
Like, a guy will come on TV,

470
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,208
or a lady,

471
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:29,593
and say, you know, "If you
want to hear how I will fix healthcare

472
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:34,097
as well as the mass of student debt
problem in this country,

473
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,559
as well as keeping our borders secure,

474
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,228
but still being compassionate,

475
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:45,233
then please go on 'www.myname'

476
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,404
and I have a 45-page position paper."

477
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,448
Then I go, "Oh, no...

478
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,577
I will not be doing that."

479
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,581
I'll tell you why,
it's nothing against you.

480
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,208
You seem like a fine enough fella,

481
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:06,880
It's just that I cannot read
your 45-page position paper

482
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,842
on account of,
earlier today, a guy told me

483
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,137
that I only get the one life.

484
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,138
So...

485
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,016
What are you gonna...

486
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,065
I still got half a box full of <i>Matlock.</i>

487
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,777
<i>Matlock </i>box sets.

488
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:34,157
You only got so much time,
you got to choose. You know?

489
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,327
You got to choose.

490
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,705
But later on, man, when you get closer
to the election,

491
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,874
here's what always happens, I've noticed.

492
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,086
Whenever you get close to an election,
they go,

493
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,255
"There's only three days left
till the election,"

494
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,215
and it's always tied.

495
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,592
You know, and they go,
"You know what we have to get?

496
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,844
Those people that don't know anything."

497
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,932
It's a very odd way of choosing the leader
of the free world,

498
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,892
but that's the best we got.

499
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,103
And they go, "We gotta get those guys
that don't--"

500
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,438
Then the commercials become very tough.

501
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,526
Nothing about the sea of Japan
or anything like that.

502
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,194
There's a guy that'll come on TV and go,

503
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,239
"Hey, listen, let me ask you a question.

504
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,199
Do you like yellow?"

505
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,244
And I go, "Yeah, of course I like yellow."

506
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,496
And he goes,
"Yeah, well so does this guy."

507
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:26,209
And they show a guy waving,
pointing at someone that doesn't exist.

508
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,337
Wearing a yellow shirt, you know?

509
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,133
Then I go, "Ruth, get out here!
Goddamn!

510
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:38,096
Here's a guy on the TV that's speaking
for me finally. Ruth!

511
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,725
You know how I'm always talking
about how cool yellow is?

512
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:46,938
Well, this motherfucker...
finally, a person that's speaking

513
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,607
not at me, but for me."

514
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,777
You know what I read, actually?

515
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,948
They say that the reason you vote
for people

516
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,452
is you vote for the guy
you'd most like to have a beer with.

517
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,787
I know that sounds odd,
but it's true.

518
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:08,043
They vote for presidents by who you would
most enjoy having a beer with.

519
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,587
But what I find even more interesting

520
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,506
is that no one has ever used that
to their political advantage.

521
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,843
If it was me, that would be
my whole campaign.

522
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,386
That would be the spine of it.

523
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,304
Beer!

524
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,516
You know what I mean? Everywhere I went
I'd be holding a glass of beer.

525
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,893
You know what I mean?

526
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,897
My slogan would be... "Ah!"

527
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,441
And I'd hold up my beer.

528
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,193
I'd go, "Ah!"

529
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,819
"You like beer?" [laughs]

530
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,529
"Me, too!

531
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,366
Vote for me and then you can come
to the White House and...

532
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,076
Ah!"

533
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,370
[chuckles]

534
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,789
Goddamn, I'm getting old.

535
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,957
You can tell,
I don't have to tell you that.

536
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,921
I like wearing these
on account of it hides

537
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,423
all my white hair
and everything like that.

538
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,259
I don't want to get my hair colored
no more, you know?

539
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,763
I don't want anybody
painting my hair black.

540
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:06,601
On account of I don't want to die
and then be surprised.

541
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,977
You know what I mean?

542
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,979
Go, "Goddamn, I look good."

543
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,358
And the guy goes,
"Well, I made your hair white.

544
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,151
What do you think that was all about?

545
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:19,531
I was telling you to get your affairs
in order, for God's sake."

546
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,369
But anyway, I tell you how you know
you're growing old

547
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,122
is when you start checking
your left arm status.

548
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,458
You go, "Goddamn, my left arm,
I feel a little odd."

549
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,584
[chuckles]

550
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,753
That's all I know about medicine.

551
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,839
If your left arm feels odd,

552
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,716
you will either have an impending
heart attack,

553
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,593
or nothing at all will happen.

554
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,265
I like doctors.
I like specialists, though, you know?

555
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,183
Like, let's say...
this is what I don't understand.

556
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,477
Your foot hurts, so you want to go
to the foot doctor.

557
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,354
You phone the foot doctor, he goes,
"I can't come,

558
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,731
you got to go to a regular doctor."

559
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,566
Then you go to the regular doctor
and he goes,

560
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,860
"Yeah, you got to go to a foot doctor.

561
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,613
Just pay Agnes 80 bucks on the way out."

562
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,824
What is that scam? You know?

563
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,285
You go, "All right."

564
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,996
He goes, "While you're here,
you want me to take your blood pressure?"

565
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,205
I'm like, "No, that's fine.

566
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,250
I've had my blood pressure taken
about five thousand times."

567
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,671
I don't even know what it means.
They go, "It's 150 over 60."

568
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,006
I go, "Is that good?"

569
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,467
They go, "Ah, I don't know,
it's all a blur.

570
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,260
I'm a doctor.

571
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,597
I'm going to be hitting your knee
with a hammer now."

572
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,268
That's the oddest one to me of all time.

573
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,061
We haven't got past that?

574
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,731
That's like a cartoon from the 1950s.

575
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,984
Guy pulls out a hammer,
hits your knee with it,

576
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,154
you go, "Ah, my knee!
Oh, my God, that hurts!"

577
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:45,617
And the guy writes down:
"Excellent. Very good.

578
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,914
That's exactly how you should react
when your knee is struck by a hammer."

579
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,919
Sometimes doctors just know smart words.

580
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,337
You ever see those guys?

581
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,214
One time, I remember I was real tired.

582
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,007
I had this thing,
I don't know what it was.

583
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,968
I say, "Hey, Doc, I got this thing,
I'm real tired."

584
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,930
He goes, "Sounds like chronic fatigue
syndrome to me."

585
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,223
I said, "Really, what's that?"

586
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:14,646
He says, well, "Chronic means always,
and fatigue means tired.

587
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:19,359
And syndrome,
that means something you got."

588
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,656
Anyway, you can pay Agnes 80 bucks
on the way out.

589
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,788
Who knows what these doctors mean
with their medical gobbledygook.

590
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,581
Guy told me yesterday, the doc, he said,

591
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,668
I'm now more of a virus than a host.

592
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,545
What does that even mean?

593
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,171
Who knows?

594
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,340
Here's the problem.

595
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,758
You go to doctors too much,

596
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,677
they start thinking you're a hypochondriac

597
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,221
and then they don't take
anything seriously, you know?

598
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,182
Word gets around with these guys.

599
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,184
Small community, the doctor community.

600
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:59,858
And I made the mistake of one time...
one time... I had a Pap smear.

601
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,529
Guy smeared my pap, you know?

602
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,281
It turned out good.

603
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:11,286
But then word got out
that I was a hypochondriac.

604
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,746
But I'm not a hypochondriac.

605
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,623
I only think I am.

606
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,628
My friend who does have a medical issue,
it's terrible,

607
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:25,717
he's 586 pounds.

608
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,176
Not a lie.

609
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,515
Now, I've been blessed to have the same
friends since I was in grade four.

610
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,518
Billy, Jimmy, Ricky, me.

611
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,062
Now, we all went our different paths,

612
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:42,567
but Jimmy became fat,
then he became really fat,

613
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,403
then he became obese,
then he became morbidly obese.

614
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:50,491
And now, 586 pounds. It's incredible.

615
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,411
He's one of those guys that can't get out
of his house and stuff.

616
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:59,167
But he's finally decided to change,
thank God.

617
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,880
So he's got a psychiatrist in there,
we got him a dietician,

618
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,632
people are around the clock.

619
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,677
One of the three of us go and visit him

620
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,304
and keep his spirits up.

621
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,056
And it's great.

622
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,725
But he said something that struck me odd
the other day.

623
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:19,646
Last time I saw him,
which was about six months ago.

624
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,855
The other day.

625
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,776
But he said to me, he said,
"Norm, you wouldn't believe it,

626
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:29,697
but at one point in my life
I weighed 135 pounds."

627
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,158
And I said, "Oh, no, I believe that.

628
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:39,415
I think you weighed every weight
up to 586 pounds.

629
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,253
I don't think you just showed up
looking like this."

630
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,215
[sighs]

631
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,635
My other friend was mentally retarded.

632
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,054
Now, I know you're not supposed to say
that anymore.

633
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,641
But that's what we said then.

634
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,518
You know? I understand that term.

635
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,688
It means that you're arrested.

636
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:05,483
You're mental capacity has been retarded
or arrested.

637
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,611
So, anyways, I'll say Down's syndrome,
I don't care.

638
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,989
I didn't say it for a long time
on account of I thought

639
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,740
people would think I was a doctor.

640
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,951
And I'd have to hit their knee
with a hammer or something.

641
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,244
I don't know.

642
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,123
But anyways, I love--

643
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,918
my best friend had
Down's syndrome, you know?

644
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,545
I love people with Down's syndrome.

645
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,714
I wish I had Down's syndrome.

646
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,048
I'll tell you why.

647
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,717
'Cause they're happy.

648
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,719
You know what I mean?
They are happy!

649
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,137
What's wrong with that?

650
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,724
Man, I wish I was happy, you know?

651
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,477
I was happy when I was with my friend,
I'll tell you that.

652
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,438
I would love to have a friend right now.

653
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,523
'Cause how often are you happy?
You ever be happy?

654
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,650
It happens once in a while, you know.

655
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,527
With me, it's usually when I wake up.

656
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,863
I wake up, I go, "Ah! Goddamn.

657
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,658
I'm glad I bought that
Tempur-Pedic pillow. [chuckles]

658
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,869
That was the best purchase I ever made."

659
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,207
But then the light comes under the door,

660
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,293
and bathes over you.

661
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,338
Then your life comes in and gets
all over you like a cobweb.

662
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,800
You're like, "Goddamn. That's not fun."

663
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,763
You ever go in the mirror
and look at yourself?

664
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,431
I'm not talking about physically.

665
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,809
Just eye to eye.

666
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:26,314
And then you go,
"Good God, what's become of me?

667
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,024
[shudders]

668
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,652
I'm going to go back to bed
and cover myself up."

669
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,071
[shudders]

670
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:37,408
That's when I would like to have
a mentally retarded friend next to me.

671
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,702
A guy with Down's syndrome to go,

672
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,828
"I like bananas!"

673
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,123
I go, "Goddamn,
I never looked at it that way.

674
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,666
I like bananas too."

675
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,086
He goes, "They're yellow!"

676
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,297
"Goddamn, you're right,
they are yellow. Ha!

677
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,425
What say you and me
go buy a yellow banana?"

678
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:01,557
See, people get mad at me
and yet they pity them!

679
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,644
I envy people with Down's syndrome.

680
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,770
You know?

681
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,896
They pity them.

682
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,524
Now, who's the bad person
in that scenario?

683
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,985
I tell you right now, man,
if there was some sort of injection

684
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,154
where I could be Down's syndrome,
I'd take it

685
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,574
because I'd love to be happy all the time.

686
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,951
You know?

687
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,205
Some people go, "Oh, mentally retarded
people aren't always happy."

688
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,582
I go, "Well, I never seen..." You know?

689
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,878
You ever see a cynical
Down's syndrome guy? You know?

690
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,296
Ever see a guy go,

691
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,925
"Fuck bananas, they're yellow.
I don't care. Who cares?"

692
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,426
I never seen them.

693
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,597
But, happiness.
The thing we strive the most.

694
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:46,102
People pity these people that have it.

695
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,230
They'll look over at a group of people
with Down's syndrome and go,

696
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:55,278
"Oh, man, look. Breaks my heart
when I see them.

697
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,989
You know why? They're happy, right?

698
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,868
It's on account of they don't understand
life's horrors.

699
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,540
Makes me sad, makes me
shake my head sadly like this here.

700
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,710
And you know the saddest part of all?

701
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,836
There's no cure.

702
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,130
They'll probably die happy."

703
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,803
Anyways,

704
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,264
I hope you guys are all doing well.

705
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,392
I'm glad I got my wife, you know, Ruth.

706
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,561
She's all right, you know?

707
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,730
She's watching a lot of TV.

708
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,024
She's got her guilty pleasures, you know?

709
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:37,862
And her guilty pleasure is watching
<i>Housewives Of Atlanta</i>.

710
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,530
I don't know if you've ever seen that.

711
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:45,077
My guilty pleasure is finding elderly
gentlemen and shooting them in the leg.

712
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,122
No, that's... that's just a joke.

713
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,457
That is a joke!

714
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,252
I felt it was time I tell a joke.

715
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,046
I think it may be in my contract.

716
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,130
Anyways...

717
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,800
my wife, man,
she ain't the brightest girl, Ruth.

718
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,510
We have what's called a hall pass.

719
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,179
You know what that is?
A hall pass?

720
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:08,559
That means you're allowed to have sex
with any two people

721
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,688
that you would like to have sex with
because they're special.

722
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,608
I chose-- and the other partner has
to agree to it.

723
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:22,323
So I chose on my hall pass Angelina Jolie
and Christie Brinkley.

724
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:26,535
And Ruth, my wife, she's so stupid that,
you know who she chose?

725
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,165
The Mexican guy that mows my lawn
and his brother.

726
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,086
Of all the people in the world,
of all the people in the world.

727
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,798
But I love women, you know?

728
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:42,718
I consider women to be superior to men
and I'll tell you why.

729
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,555
They create life. Think about that.
You know what I mean?

730
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,807
What do men do?

731
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,518
Maybe they eat sour cream and onion chips
or something.

732
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,229
Women create life for God's sakes.

733
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,647
It's amazing.

734
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,565
You know what I'm saying?

735
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,527
If I was a woman, that's all I'd do,
just create life.

736
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,905
I'd go to parties and go, "Hey, Fred.

737
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,700
What do you do? I can't remember."

738
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,452
And Fred would go,
"I'll tell you what I do, Loretta."

739
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,954
That's my name

740
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,580
in the story.

741
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,749
He'd go,
"I'll tell you what I do, Loretta.

742
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,211
I think you know I work down at the bank
for Mr. Abernathy.

743
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,296
And...

744
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,965
I, well, what...

745
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,678
my main job is Abernathy will give me
a stack of papers about this big.

746
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:30,016
By the end of the day, if I get them down
to about this big, that's a good--"

747
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,311
I go, "Wait a second there. I'm sorry.

748
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,855
I got to stop you there.

749
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,651
Remember how I was telling you
how I create life?

750
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,819
Human life.

751
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,238
The highest form of life.

752
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,198
I just got to tell you this.

753
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,327
That life just kicked me.

754
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,040
Can you possibly wrap your head
around that?"

755
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:58,127
And he'll go, "Ah! Well, I...

756
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:05,259
Look. Abernathy's never given me
that corner office like he promised.

757
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,804
And there was plenty of lunches
where he brought it up.

758
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,807
Ah! But then Henderson showed up.

759
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,601
That all changed.

760
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,478
Who am I kidding?

761
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,313
I should just quit."

762
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,067
Anyways,

763
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,652
what have we learned
from this little fable?

764
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,196
[chuckles]

765
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,074
It's funny now,
here's what I was thinking of...

766
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,992
You know how everybody's got a name now?

767
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,745
Everybody has an identity, you know?

768
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,498
Like, let's say, your sexuality.

769
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,958
Let's say a guy likes a guy.

770
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,627
That's a homosexual.

771
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:45,591
If you are attracted to a member
of your own gender.

772
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,720
If you're attracted to a member
of the opposite sex

773
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,680
then you're a heterosexual.

774
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,933
But what about a guy like me?
Just whacks off all the time?

775
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:54,934
What am I?

776
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,103
I don't know,
I don't think I've got a word.

777
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,980
This is why I was thinking
about whacking off.

778
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,357
Think about this.

779
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,986
It's kind of like a psychotic break
you got to do.

780
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,531
You know? Like, in your mind,
in your picture,

781
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:12,368
you have to have a picture there of you
with a lady

782
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,413
and you got to believe it so much

783
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,040
that you don't even
believe what's really happening.

784
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,959
You know what I'm getting at?

785
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,089
I don't know, like, a lot of guys...
I don't have a great imagination.

786
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:30,845
A lot of guys will do it
with a... <i>Playboy </i>magazine, say.

787
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:35,933
Or maybe a <i>Victoria's Secret,</i>
or something like that.

788
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,853
But I ain't got the imagination for that,
you know what I mean?

789
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,605
Like, I try, you know, but then I'll go,

790
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:46,026
"Okay, you come over here
with your 'Victoria Secrets.'

791
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,988
Huh? I'll show you your underwear."

792
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,240
I don't know why I'm mean to them, but...

793
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,035
I'll go, "Why don't you come over
and take off your underwear?"

794
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,787
They go, "No, I'm not doing that."

795
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,747
And I go, "No, I... goodbye!

796
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,125
I didn't think you would.

797
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:05,296
Sorry about that crack about asking you
to take your underwear off."

798
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,297
But...

799
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,049
I don't have the imagination for that.

800
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:15,181
However, there is this lady that works
down the street from me at 7-11.

801
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,602
She's not much to look at,
but she likes me.

802
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,020
That's the important thing.

803
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:25,566
In that way, in that certain way
that women like men.

804
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,861
And I know she likes me on account of

805
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,197
one time I was buying
sour cream and onion chips

806
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,450
and Vanilla Swiss Almond ice cream,

807
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,202
and I'm getting it, right,

808
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,038
and she goes,
"I like sour cream and onion chips, too."

809
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,706
I go, "Yeah, that's interesting."

810
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,208
She goes, "No, I really like them."

811
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,667
Now I look up, I'm like...

812
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,422
Because sometimes the shadow of the thing
is bigger than the...

813
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,757
Anyways...

814
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,800
I knew that she liked me.

815
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:56,388
So then, for the next two months
I'm whacking off.

816
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,890
Oh, my God.

817
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,436
Now, in my head is me and the girl...

818
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,106
I don't think any guy could just,
in his head,

819
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,984
have himself whacking off.

820
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,529
That wouldn't work.
I'm only talking about men.

821
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,405
'Cause I've asked women.

822
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,284
I've said, "What do you do when you lie
with yourself

823
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:21,205
and make your finger a blur

824
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,750
like a hummingbird's wing?

825
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,544
What do you think of in your head?"

826
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,296
And then they go, "Oh, a hammock."

827
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,756
And I'm like, "Oh!"

828
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,675
So anyways,
they're a little more advanced.

829
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,219
But we have to think
of a specific scenario.

830
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:38,514
So my scenario is the lady from 7-11,

831
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,599
I go, "Hey! They're giving you a break.

832
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,726
I'll show you a break.
Come on over here."

833
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,687
My jokes don't even make sense.

834
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,188
Anyways, I get 'em...

835
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,942
What I'm interested in is in the moment
when the fever breaks.

836
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:50,901
You know what I mean?

837
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:56,782
When that four seconds of issue
that you spent so much time going after,

838
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,950
it ends.

839
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,743
You know what I mean?

840
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,913
You're thinking of all these things
in your head.

841
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:09,378
You just got a psychotic break going that
would rival a paranoid schizophrenic.

842
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,923
All of a sudden it stops
and you're like, "Ah!"

843
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,551
It's just me.

844
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,179
There are no ladies at all.

845
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,016
It's just me.

846
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,434
[panting]

847
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,019
I got to get a hold of myself.

848
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,062
What'll I do here?

849
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,564
I know.

850
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,857
I'll go downstairs.

851
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,067
I'll get a cheese sandwich.

852
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,819
[chuckles]

853
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:37,072
Yeah. I'll never think about this again.

854
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,907
[chuckles]

855
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,452
That's right. [chuckles]

856
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,872
I'll be honest with you.

857
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:50,544
Sometimes I feel bad about doing that.

858
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,547
Self-abuse, you know,
lying down with myself.

859
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,509
On account of...
because I'm a Christian. You know?

860
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,847
But, I'll tell you this, a lot of people
think Christians are self-righteous.

861
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,725
But we're not, we're sinning all the time.

862
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,435
All the time. For instance...

863
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,771
I eat apples.

864
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,067
Think about that for a second.
It's on page one.

865
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,111
Worst thing you can do in the world.

866
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,697
I'm munching down on an apple. Ah!

867
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,282
You know?

868
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,159
Sure, I love apples, but...

869
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,537
is it worth getting raped by the Devil
for all of time?

870
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,997
I say no!

871
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,458
Anyways...

872
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,377
I know there's a God.

873
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,130
People go, "Well, you're only a Christian
because you grew up in a Christian--"

874
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,592
And I understand that and that's
one of my biggest fears.

875
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,220
That I picked the wrong religion,
you know?

876
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,472
That I believed,
but then I died and I go,

877
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,932
"Ah! It's you!

878
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,519
I thought it was the other fella. Ah!"

879
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:54,066
I should have been slaying apostates
the entire time.

880
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:57,361
Oh well, what are you going to do?

881
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,113
Hey! Did you know this?

882
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,824
They finally figured out
that Jesus Christ,

883
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,742
whether you're religious or not,

884
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,954
that Jesus Christ was actually
a historical figure.

885
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,956
Probably a historical figure.

886
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,999
I don't think that's
that interesting

887
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:15,879
because it's only whether he was
divine or not that matters.

888
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,590
But they also found,
I found this very interesting,

889
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,926
they found a new Dead Sea Scroll.

890
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:27,724
And it was a gospel about Jesus H. Christ.

891
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,894
It turned out that he was a real guy,
you know?

892
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:35,524
He grew up in the town
right next to Jesus Christ.

893
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,527
So, often he was--
he had a bad life

894
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,405
because people would
come up to him and go, "Hey!"

895
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,075
"Master, can we touch your hand?"

896
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,202
And he'd go, "I'm not the guy!

897
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,912
I'm a plumber for God's sake.

898
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,415
You're looking for the cabinet maker. Ah!"

899
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,334
And they'd go, "Please, Master,
let us touch your hand."

900
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,420
And he'd go,
"You can touch it if you want,

901
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,380
but I'm telling you nothing's going
to happen.

902
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,507
I should have just gone with Howard.

903
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,718
I don't like this one bit."

904
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,721
Anyways, I thought that was interesting.

905
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:13,729
But, listen, folks,
I don't want to get depressing, you know?

906
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,150
But you got to get a living will,
I'll tell you that right now.

907
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,068
It's very important, I'll tell you why.

908
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:24,114
Because if you don't--
I'll tell you what a living will is.

909
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,785
It's if you happen to go into a coma,
something like that,

910
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:33,707
the living will
tells the doctor what to do.

911
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,044
And it's usually about a plug.

912
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,880
A plug in the wall.

913
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,591
I hate to bring everybody down,

914
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:46,261
but a lot of you will end up plugged
into the wall.

915
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,804
Sounds odd, but...

916
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,349
And I'm not going to say
which one of you

917
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,934
because I don't think that's fair.

918
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:56,021
But I made out a very simple one.
You know?

919
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,064
All it...

920
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,774
See, here's the thing.

921
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:02,778
If you do not make out a living will,
you know what happens?

922
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,947
You know who decides?
Your family.

923
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,907
And guess what they'll decide?

924
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,244
Maybe what they always decide.

925
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,248
No, they always decide the same thing.
You know?

926
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,666
At first they don't.

927
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,961
Because, you know,
it's kind of fun bringing your friends in.

928
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,839
There's something lying there,
you go, "Look at that, huh?

929
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,884
Used to have dreams.
Now it's just a gray thing.

930
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:26,802
Oh, well.

931
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,846
Used to make apple pies for me."

932
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,223
But anyways,

933
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,643
the novelty runs out of anything
and after a while, you know,

934
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,521
of course the family is going to go--

935
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,940
and I know it's going to be my sister,
she'll go,

936
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,569
"Oh, yeah, Doc, remember when you
were saying, 'Did Norm ever

937
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:47,197
discuss what he'd want
if he was plugged into a wall?'

938
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,991
Well, I don't know if this counts,

939
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,868
but one time I remember
we were having lunch

940
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:56,373
and Norm said to me, 'You know, if I was
ever plugged into a wall

941
00:47:56,456 --> 00:48:00,335
then I think that you should, you know...

942
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,089
kill me.'"

943
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:11,305
And then everybody else in the room goes,
"I remember him saying that too!"

944
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:15,142
And then what if you were in the coma,
you can still hear, you're like,

945
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,227
"Oh, no!"
But you can't even get to them.

946
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:23,275
Anyways, what I was going to say is,
I don't even have a plug.

947
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:30,157
I got a whole Byzantine,
you know, bunch of different plugs.

948
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,284
Surge protectors, all sorts--

949
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:37,247
because I don't want some janitor
with a wide broom hitting my plug.

950
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,332
You know?

951
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:44,212
And then my sister slipping a five to him
out in the hallway.

952
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,715
I know how things work,
I'll tell you that.

953
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:50,636
Also, what happens if they go,
"Okay, let's pull the plug."

954
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,972
Then a guy runs in,
"I got some great news!

955
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,767
Oh... did you guys pull the plug?"

956
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,061
They go, "Yeah, what's the great news?"

957
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:04,399
He goes, "Nothing. No. Nothing at all.

958
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:11,448
It's just LeBron James might go
to the hall of fame, they say.

959
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,699
[laughs]

960
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,327
But anyways,
you better go home and grieve.

961
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,956
You know what one of the best ways
of grieving is, they say.

962
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,459
Don't read the newspaper,

963
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,711
or look at the internet,

964
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,171
or anything.

965
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,340
That's what they say."

966
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,262
I don't know, man.

967
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,848
There's more in this world
than anybody can understand.

968
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:41,186
Psychology. I don't understand
psychology, I'll tell you.

969
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,063
I don't even know if it's real.

970
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,400
They say some people got
recovered memories.

971
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,735
A memory will just come to them, you know?

972
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,445
From 30, 40 years ago.

973
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,197
It's never a good memory.

974
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,827
It's never like they go,
"Goddamn, I used to like peach pie.

975
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,162
I got to get me a piece of peach pie."

976
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:03,208
It's always the most violent, sexual,
horrifying incident.

977
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,626
You know what I mean?

978
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,462
And I don't like it.
I don't like it.

979
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,466
Because, here's the thing
with recovered memory.

980
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,054
You can't be sure anymore
of what happened. You know?

981
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:19,766
I used to be at parties,
and say it with great pride,

982
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,893
people would come up to me and go,
"Hey, Norm,

983
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,146
did your uncle ever
fuck your ass?"

984
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,148
And I'd go, "No."

985
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,733
And I'd be happy.

986
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,944
I took great pride in that, you know?

987
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,740
But now I can't say that anymore,
you know?

988
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,367
Because there's two possibilities.

989
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,747
Either my uncle fucked my ass
and I forgot,

990
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,582
or he didn't fuck my ass.

991
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,084
So, when people come up to me now
and ask me,

992
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,295
"Did your uncle fuck your ass?"

993
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,214
All I can say is, "I don't know.

994
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,175
Fifty-fifty, I guess."

995
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,847
If I understand my advanced math,
it's 50-50.

996
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,892
But I don't even know if I believe
in psychology.

997
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,019
You know what I mean?
And I'll tell you why.

998
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,814
Because my friend, everything to this guy
has two meanings.

999
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,024
You know what I mean?

1000
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,277
He says, "You know how you have your
conscience and your subco--"

1001
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,195
Anyways,

1002
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:16,156
one time I'm with this guy,
we're having dinner,

1003
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,450
and I take a glass of milk.

1004
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,951
I'm drinking the milk.

1005
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,580
The guy says, "Hey! You know why you're
drinking that milk, Norm?"

1006
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,540
I go, "No, why?"

1007
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,042
I know something's coming.

1008
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:31,838
He goes, "That's because you miss sucking
on your mother's breast."

1009
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,715
And I'm like, "Ah!"

1010
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,675
"What did you have to say that for?"

1011
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,678
And I'm stuck, you know?

1012
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,516
What am I gonna guzzle the milk?
There's a delicious cold milk there.

1013
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,184
You know?

1014
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:51,358
And you guys don't know my mother,
but she's 84 years old, for God sakes.

1015
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,694
She's a sweet lady and everything, but...

1016
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,240
You know what?

1017
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,326
I was thinking about my mother
the other day because,

1018
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,663
you know the #MeToo movement
and the Time's Up movement and all that?

1019
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,707
This is a move--
I've never seen--

1020
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,001
I've never been through a revolution
like this.

1021
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:14,381
It's very exciting, you know,
to see women get

1022
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,175
what they've always deserved
in the first place, you know?

1023
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:24,641
But every revolution has its casualties.

1024
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:27,602
And for me, it's people like my mother.

1025
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,689
Or maybe you have a mother
or a grandmother.

1026
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:33,441
It's those people.
I remember growing up with my mother.

1027
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,528
She'd be cooking, she'd be in the kitchen.

1028
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,322
"Do you have enough gravy? Oh!

1029
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:43,493
There's some more turkey.
Oh, the turnips! The turnips!"

1030
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,829
She'd get the turnips out.

1031
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,998
Then I'd go, "Ma, you got enough to eat?"

1032
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,499
She'd go, "Oh, yes."

1033
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,378
But she'd just be eating what
was left from us, you know what I mean?

1034
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,547
And we'd go,
"Can we help with the dishes?"

1035
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,340
"No, no, watch your football games."

1036
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,468
I love my mother, you know.

1037
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,179
She lives right beside me here.

1038
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,182
She's great.

1039
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:13,106
I don't think my mother has ever
spoken a word

1040
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,234
that had any irony in it.

1041
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,903
You know what I mean?

1042
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,738
She's just earnest, she's just happy.

1043
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,948
She knows how to love, she doesn't judge.

1044
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,702
I don't think...

1045
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,748
She'll go sometimes to the grocery store
and come back,

1046
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:30,916
the other day she did this.

1047
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,877
She'd come back, she'd say, "A funny thing
happened at the grocery store."

1048
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,045
I said, "What happened, Mom?"

1049
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:39,674
She said, "A woman came in and bought
a grapefruit and it cost $1.69

1050
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:43,303
and last week it cost $1.19."

1051
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:47,682
And then I said, "That's not a story,
let alone a funny story.

1052
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:51,353
I don't even think
that would be considered a story."

1053
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:56,149
Anyways, my point is that
I would trade my...

1054
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,319
I don't know what my point is, really.

1055
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,281
Oh, yeah! I know!
I don't want to suck her tits!

1056
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,200
That's what my point was.

1057
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,120
Maybe that makes me shallow. I don't know.

1058
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,875
Stay safe, folks. I love you.

1059
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:19,255
I would drop the mic, but I paid for it.

1060
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,426
[laughter]

1061
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,012
That was sweet, man.

1062
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,263
Holy shit.

1063
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,515
Tearjerker ending.

1064
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,516
Oh, God.

1065
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,433
Yup.

1066
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,185
I thought of two things.

1067
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:36,272
The first thing I thought of was,
I might owe Drew Michaels an apology.

1068
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,274
Because he made a special
with no audience

1069
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,192
and I hated it.

1070
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,318
Ah!

1071
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:45,699
Because I looked at it like
a swimming meet with no water.

1072
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,451
Like that's the whole thing.

1073
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:54,874
But this... was very endearing.

1074
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,834
It was amazing.

1075
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,335
This... [grumbles]

1076
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,587
[Letterman] The form is different.

1077
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,549
It's not strictly speaking stand-up.
It's something else.

1078
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:08,680
And the great gift could have been
to be in a room full of people

1079
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,974
when Norm did that for those people.

1080
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,476
Because that would have evaluated,
measured,

1081
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,228
and directed what he's talking about.

1082
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,689
And for us to sit here and look at it

1083
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:21,234
is not a true test of anything really
other than we all love Norm

1084
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,279
and, my God, he is certainly prolific.

1085
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,031
Certainly energetic.

1086
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,951
But we weren't watching stand-up comedy
because it was impossible.

1087
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,787
But there's something there,
for sure.

1088
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,706
-There's no question.
-Yeah.

1089
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,333
[Chappelle]
I also forget how poetic he is.

1090
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,543
Yeah.

1091
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:43,381
With Norm, I didn't know him that well
in the '90s.

1092
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,384
Then when my dad died,
I had to do a movie with Norm,

1093
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,511
and I tried everything to get out
of that movie

1094
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,055
because I was inconsolable.

1095
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,973
I couldn't get out of it.

1096
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:55,727
And working with him was the greatest
thing that ever happened to me.

1097
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:59,230
It was like, he was the right guy
at the right time.

1098
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,899
I was inconsolable.

1099
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,693
Did he talk to you about your dad a lot?
What did he do?

1100
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,361
Never came up.

1101
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,739
He just made me laugh.

1102
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:08,948
[Sandler] Yeah, right, right.

1103
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:14,370
He just, you know, it was wistful,
and amusing.

1104
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,663
You know how Norm is.

1105
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,708
You never knew if he was
setting something up or not.

1106
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,376
We were just hanging out,
all of a sudden

1107
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,921
it'd be like this punchline
out of nowhere, but...

1108
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,131
it started to become like a...

1109
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,550
work was like a church I go to.

1110
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,927
I couldn't wait to get to work

1111
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,012
-and hang around this guy.
-Yeah. Sweet.

1112
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,555
[Chappelle] And I knew he was special.

1113
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,849
-Yeah.
-And...

1114
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:40,105
I've known people for years and years
that didn't make me laugh

1115
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,066
as much as he did in that eight
or ten weeks.

1116
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,901
He's like a real special person to me.

1117
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,278
And the way he's funny,

1118
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,615
I just never seen someone
get at it like that.

1119
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,117
Yeah.

1120
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,495
The element that I always admired

1121
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,580
was the connection to the audience.

1122
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,126
And his asides,
and his looks and his pauses

1123
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:06,589
were interpreted exactly the way he knew
they would be interpreted

1124
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:12,220
and that fueled the ridiculous nature
of some of the presentation.

1125
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:15,473
And without that audience,
you don't get

1126
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,559
-the full measure of Norm.
-Yeah.

1127
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,186
It was like the audience was his partner.

1128
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,605
Everybody was in this together with Norm.

1129
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,816
I agree. I like the way you said it.

1130
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,025
The audience was his partner.

1131
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:32,699
That kind of felt like the gentle Norm
that when you would sit and hang out

1132
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,660
after our shows on the road
or we'd be on the bus with him.

1133
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,120
He'd still be being funny.

1134
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,372
He would kind of perform like that.

1135
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,624
Like, he'd say his material to you,

1136
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,918
he'd kind of commit to it,

1137
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,588
but he just kept going
and going and going.

1138
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:49,424
It looked like he was just like,
"I want to get everything out.

1139
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,719
Everything I've been thinking about."
Anyways...

1140
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:59,017
He had, I think, the best word choice
of maybe any comedian I've ever seen.

1141
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,186
He intentionally mispronounces words.

1142
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,520
-Yeah.
-[Sandler] That's right.

1143
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,646
[O'Brien] When he knows...

1144
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,649
he knows how to say "TV",
he says it's "the TV".

1145
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,110
He came on our show,
I think it was his first appearance,

1146
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,571
he was talking about a Doberman,
and he said it's a "Dober-man".

1147
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,031
And he knows!

1148
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,826
But he's constantly screwing with you
on every level.

1149
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:17,827
[Letterman] Right.

1150
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,831
But his word choice,
he was like Mark Twain.

1151
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,877
He had this folksy,
completely out-of-time...

1152
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,546
I don't know if he was born
300 years too late

1153
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,464
or 300 years too early,

1154
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:32,008
but he's talking in a way...
no one speaks like that.

1155
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:36,429
And you really appreciate
the way he says things.

1156
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,723
-And his timing.
-He talks like a 1930s

1157
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,100
-Canadian dock worker.
-Yeah.

1158
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:45,188
Does it remind you a bit of
<i>Face In The Crowd?</i>

1159
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:49,192
Some of the early stuff where
he's just communicating

1160
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,319
from himself to a radio audience?

1161
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,363
That's what I thought of early on in this.

1162
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,280
[O'Brien] Yeah.

1163
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:58,076
You know, it's funny because the way
I experienced him,

1164
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,914
as you did, Dave,
was really on the talk show format.

1165
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:07,418
And later on, when I would look
at the clips of him on my show,

1166
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,255
I would think--
I don't even know that I needed to--

1167
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,965
I was there just laughing.

1168
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,758
But I was in no way...

1169
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,718
He's totally self-fueled.

1170
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,763
Yes, it's nice when you hear
the audience there, but he's also...

1171
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,517
you know, what he's doing
is so absurd and ridiculous.

1172
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,354
This was an exercise in...
I couldn't do that if you just put

1173
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,147
-a camera there...
-[Letterman] No.

1174
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,817
...and said you've got 50 minutes and go.

1175
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,862
I would become, I would lose
my train of thought, or I would--

1176
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:39,033
I need other people there
for me to find the next thing.

1177
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,202
He's completely...

1178
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:44,330
When I look at his appearances
that he did with me,

1179
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,040
I think, I didn't need to be there.

1180
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,709
I mean, I'm glad I was there.

1181
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,544
I'm selfishly glad I was there.

1182
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,878
[Spade] You need a second to think.

1183
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,839
I don't know if he's got a set list.

1184
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,300
There's no really looking down,
there's no fumbling,

1185
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,761
there's no think--
it was just kind of go, go, go.

1186
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,723
I didn't see where that would be
and to remember all that?

1187
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:05,268
The presentation,
considering the circumstance,

1188
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,812
the presentation was robust
for God's sake.

1189
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,022
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1190
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,232
I like the messiness.
I like the dog.

1191
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,401
The dog and that phone call.

1192
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:16,029
You were saying
the guy without the audience.

1193
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,448
This is just more,
there was no choice.

1194
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,408
It's different when he just has to do it.

1195
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,035
The other guy picked
not to have an audience.

1196
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,411
That's absolutely right.

1197
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,038
I didn't even think it was possible.

1198
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,247
Yeah.

1199
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,750
I feel like he landed the trick.

1200
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,667
Yeah.

1201
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,879
-His timing is like a drummer's.
-[all agreeing]

1202
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,505
It's like a jazz drummer.

1203
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,300
What would the timing have been
with an audience?

1204
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,343
Still perfect?

1205
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,721
I can't tell, you know.

1206
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,807
He's so nice with it,
I feel like

1207
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,436
it looked like
it was supposed to be that.

1208
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,313
-It's hard to explain.
-[Sandler] Right, yeah.

1209
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,940
This is like listening
to a good book on tape.

1210
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,067
[Sandler] Mm-hmm.

1211
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,152
Yeah.

1212
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,946
-It's really...
-Yeah, yeah, that's good.

1213
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,574
It reminds me of what I liked about him.

1214
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,286
He's a soothing person to be around.

1215
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,871
[Sandler] Yeah, gentle, gentle.

1216
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:10,625
My favorite comedy makes--
is kind of intuitive.

1217
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:13,336
It makes people feel safe,
like everything's going to be all right.

1218
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,337
-[Sandler] Right.
-This guy was

1219
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:18,007
-in a weird way reconciling his mortality.
-[Shannon] Yeah.

1220
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,343
Hilariously in front of us.

1221
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:23,596
Ironically, he's no longer with us.

1222
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,639
Oh, yeah.

1223
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,767
We're sitting in the aftermath
of the life of Norm Macdonald,

1224
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,813
watching him be incredibly alive.

1225
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,481
[Letterman] But, he...

1226
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,819
his circumstance,
he nudged into it several times...

1227
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:40,029
-Right.
-...but didn't linger.

1228
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:44,784
And to us, from this perspective,
powerfully meaningful.

1229
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,328
He definitely wanted--
I'm sorry, Molly.

1230
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,038
No, you go, Adam.

1231
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,416
I was just going to say he definitely
wanted to make the point

1232
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,500
he loves his mom.

1233
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,836
That's what I was going to say!

1234
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:58,589
There was a moment where
you just have this glimpse

1235
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:02,009
where he takes a pause and he's like,
"She's great."

1236
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,177
-Yeah.
-[Shannon] Remember?

1237
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,262
Absolutely.

1238
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,930
It was so touching.

1239
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,765
He's talking a lot about mortality.

1240
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,267
He's talking a lot about death.

1241
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,436
Obviously, now that people,

1242
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,731
you know, comics talk
about that all the time, but...

1243
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:16,941
it has this...

1244
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:20,653
How would those have registered in front
of a live audience, do you think?

1245
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,906
"Not wanting to suck his mother's tits"
would kill.

1246
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,324
That was murder!

1247
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,785
He went all the way around the barn
for that one.

1248
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,872
That's right! He went all the way
around the barn.

1249
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:34,917
He had this great way of making you...
he'd plant the seed,

1250
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:38,963
walk all over the hill, around the silo,

1251
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,173
down to the brook.

1252
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,632
You've forgotten about it,

1253
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,302
and then he lands that again
and it's joyous.

1254
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,304
It's just joyous, but I, you know,

1255
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:50,892
this form makes me so appreciate
what I always knew.

1256
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:55,480
His face, his eyes, and his eyebrows.

1257
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,398
There's something almost
like a jack-o'-lantern.

1258
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,025
He's got such a great...

1259
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,153
his expressions
when he's talking about

1260
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:05,615
after someone's completed the act,

1261
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,409
when he becomes,
"What am I going to do now?"

1262
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:09,619
"I'll have a cheese sandwich."

1263
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:13,039
He's such a terrific performer.

1264
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,749
He's really just got this.

1265
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:19,128
And he's telling the whole story like,

1266
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,298
I don't know,
a great 1920s silent film comic.

1267
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:27,053
When he smiled,
I could picture him as a child.

1268
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,012
-Aw.
-Oh, yeah.

1269
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,265
He has a...
you know, he's my senior,

1270
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,726
but he's got a boyish charm.

1271
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,647
-When he laughs at his own jokes.
-Man, him laughing is amazing.

1272
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:41,526
There's something just joyful
about watching it.

1273
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,070
Does anybody know the length of time
it would take him

1274
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,239
to compile an hour of material?

1275
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,282
Would that be six months, a year?

1276
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:49,450
He had more material.

1277
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:54,080
We were on the road one time and he would
swap sets out of nowhere.

1278
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,707
He'd be like, "I'm gonna try something."

1279
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,251
He didn't really talk about it.

1280
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,418
We'd say, "You doing this joke?"

1281
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,088
-He'd be like, "I don't know about that."
-[Spade] He'd flip a whole set.

1282
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,297
He'd flip-- yeah.

1283
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,300
One time, in some conversation, he goes,

1284
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,220
"I got a good eight hours now."
Or something like that.

1285
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,555
Eight hours.

1286
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,974
You remember that <i>Star Search </i>bit
he used to do?

1287
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,351
The scaffolding in the bit
was always the same,

1288
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:18,020
but I've never seen him do it
the same twice.

1289
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,815
He would just make up these crazy
<i>Star Search </i>intros.

1290
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:24,694
<i>-</i>Oh, <i>Star Search.</i>
-[Chappelle] <i>Star Search...</i>

1291
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,989
"This next band has been kicking around
the Miami area for the last 15 years.

1292
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,866
Give it up for 'Overnight Sensation,'"
he'd say.

1293
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:33,786
He would do that.
He had a million of them.

1294
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,080
And I've seen him do the bit
a bunch of times,

1295
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,248
never the same.

1296
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,792
The scaffolding was the same,
the lyrics always change.

1297
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:43,629
He also had an infinite collection
of old stories.

1298
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:50,386
I think probably from rural Canada
or traveling salesman stories.

1299
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,639
And I would be delighted
because he'd come out

1300
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,433
and I'd be laughing,

1301
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,853
only person I could say this about,
I'd be laughing before he did anything.

1302
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:00,980
He'd come out from behind the curtain

1303
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,441
and he's got those cheeks and those eyes.

1304
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:05,651
And I'm... I've looked at the tape,
I'm just laughing.

1305
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:06,861
He hasn't done anything yet.

1306
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,487
Then I... "Norm, how are you?"

1307
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,156
He's like... [mumbles]

1308
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:14,410
"Bought a farm." And I know immediately
this is complete bullshit.

1309
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:21,167
You know, the whole thing is a complete
waste of everyone's time

1310
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,419
-and it's joyous.
-[Letterman] Right.

1311
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:24,962
He's reveling in it.

1312
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,089
He's reveling in every second of it.

1313
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,966
This wife Ruth he was speaking of...

1314
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,010
Nothing's real!

1315
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,386
Yeah. Agnes at the desk.

1316
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,764
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1317
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:40,394
I can remember reading his autobiography
and enjoying it,

1318
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:43,147
but being greatly disappointed
about ten pages in

1319
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,857
when I realized it was all fantasy.

1320
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:49,528
-[all laughing]
-I want to know about Norm's life,

1321
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:52,031
but this was other solar system.

1322
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,952
We were on the road.
It was Adam and Rob Schneider,

1323
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,829
Norm and a bunch of us.

1324
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,581
Some nights he would flip the whole set.

1325
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,667
But some nights he would do
like the bomb set.

1326
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,752
And he would just walk people.

1327
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,381
He would do it almost on purpose.
You know?

1328
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,842
Some nights he would say,
"This is the set you're getting..."

1329
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:18,432
He did-- this is courtesy of Jim Downey
who did "Update" with Norm.

1330
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,727
The thing that stuns me is he used to...

1331
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,355
there's drafts for <i>Saturday Night Live</i>
and then there's air.

1332
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:30,486
And Norm would do his set for "Update"
in front of the dress crowd.

1333
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:33,364
There'd be certain jokes
that got absolutely nothing.

1334
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:37,618
Now, a sketch can maybe do better on air
than it did--

1335
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:42,039
but a joke, if it bombs at dress
in that format,

1336
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,375
it will bomb on air.
It just will.

1337
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:50,172
So he had undisputed proof
that his joke was going to bomb.

1338
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,507
But he liked the joke.

1339
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,969
He'd turn to Downey
and say, "We're doing it."

1340
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,513
And Downey would say,
"That's a great joke."

1341
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:00,099
"Yeah, we're doing it."
Now, that...

1342
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:04,186
I like to do well.

1343
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,940
And if I'm handed absolute proof
that I will fail,

1344
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,316
I will change course.

1345
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,943
I will admit it.

1346
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,903
I'm not-- that guy,

1347
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:16,407
there's something in him
that's unbelievably fearless.

1348
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:20,286
What you're describing there,
when I would watch those segments,

1349
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,912
they were delightful.

1350
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,374
There was something more exciting
and interesting about the silence

1351
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:31,839
-and Norm's joy at having landed the dud.
-Holding his smile.

1352
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,841
It was thrilling.

1353
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,259
It was heroic.

1354
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:41,766
He was telling us, "This is a good joke
and I'm sticking with it."

1355
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,603
His eyes would just light up
when he was getting nothing.

1356
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:48,606
"You've got what I'm serving tonight.

1357
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,566
This is what we're serving
at the restaurant.

1358
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:52,651
This is what you're eating.

1359
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,736
There you go."

1360
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,447
-Yeah.
-That's a perfect way to put it.

1361
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,115
It's like a master chef.

1362
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,160
"What do you know?
Fuck your taste buds."

1363
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,663
The sushi restaurant where they go,
"We don't do California Rolls here."

1364
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:11,545
I just like that that guy is certain...

1365
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,006
in his sensibility.

1366
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,050
It's fun to watch.

1367
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,844
You get more than a joke and a laugh.

1368
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:22,431
You get that tone, you get that attitude.

1369
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:26,185
There is that invisible connection.

1370
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,354
We know what you're up to, Norm.

1371
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:29,480
This is what we love.

1372
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,483
It's like why rock and roll is cool.

1373
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:35,486
The swag of, like, he's just doing it.

1374
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,446
It's '80s hip, bro.

1375
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,656
It was great.

1376
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:40,825
He came on our show one time,

1377
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,995
your old studio, <i>The Late Night Show.</i>
And he--

1378
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,456
I went in just to say hi
before the segment.

1379
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,043
He's in the dressing room right
outside the double doors.

1380
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:55,464
Inconsolable because he had bet
on a big game that had just ended.

1381
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,467
Oh, yeah! He would get mad.

1382
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,262
I'm there to try and make sure
that the guest is in a good mood.

1383
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,639
We're going to have a good ramp up.

1384
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,808
And I remembered him:
"That's a lot of money!"

1385
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,810
Yeah, yeah.

1386
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,563
And I hear the band outside.
[mimics band playing]

1387
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,481
It's going to be good time show business

1388
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,900
with a man that just lost
55 thousand--

1389
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,610
Who knows what he lost, you know?

1390
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,445
Recently destitute Norm Macdonald.

1391
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,865
-[O'Brien] Exactly, yeah.
-Did he give that up, do we know?

1392
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,491
-I don't know.
-I don't--

1393
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,076
I don't know a hundred percent.

1394
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,078
Whenever it was him reading an excerpt
from his book

1395
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,413
or his book on tape,

1396
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:34,003
where he describes his gambling addiction
so poetically.

1397
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,129
Oh, wow.

1398
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,797
He talks about roulette.

1399
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,215
-Roulette.
-Yeah.

1400
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,718
-It's a book on tape.
-How hopeful it is to be...

1401
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,761
He's addicted to the hope of it.

1402
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:46,932
And there's no way you can talk
about Norm and not,

1403
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:51,061
because we all know
that gambling was part of his life.

1404
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,898
And he, you can just--

1405
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,735
in his comedy, he's just always putting
everything on 17 red,

1406
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:58,944
or 35 black.

1407
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,322
That's amazing.

1408
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,158
It's really the same,
whatever, the same thrill.

1409
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,076
You're right, that's interesting.

1410
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:08,037
"I'm not taking that." You know?

1411
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:11,498
I have a funny Norm gambling one.

1412
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:16,629
And this is... everything is true because
some of it doesn't make sense.

1413
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,380
But we lived in the same building.

1414
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:21,675
I went up to visit him in his room.

1415
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,011
We come over to his apartment, that was...

1416
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,306
going into his apartment was bananas
as it is.

1417
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,558
But we're having a nice time and I say,

1418
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:30,684
"You got any soda?"

1419
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:35,439
And I open up his fridge
and, I swear to God,

1420
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:38,317
Twenty-five thousand dollars
worth of chips.

1421
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:42,404
Atlantic City chips are in his fridge.
I go, "What's this?"

1422
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:47,868
And he goes, "I won big.
I won big on Friday."

1423
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,537
I said, "Why didn't you cash it in,
buddy?"

1424
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:55,084
He goes, "I brought it here so I can talk
to Bernie Brillstein

1425
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,461
to see how I don't have
to pay taxes on it."

1426
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,546
So I go, "Oh."

1427
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,591
He goes, "So I bring it back Monday.

1428
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:07,596
He told me no matter what,
I gotta pay taxes so it didn't work out."

1429
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,682
So, whatever, I go, "Oh, that sucks."

1430
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:13,519
Anyways, I see him on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>
on Monday, I go,

1431
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,480
"Did you cash it in?"
He goes, "I lost it all."

1432
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:18,274
[all laugh]

1433
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,278
We'd go down the elevators.

1434
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:25,406
They have limos for us for the <i>SNL</i>
to go to the after-party.

1435
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:29,660
So, we get in them and Max, the guy, goes,

1436
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,830
"Norm sometimes takes us
to Atlantic City."

1437
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:36,792
He skips the party to go right there
and that Monday he comes back,

1438
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,836
he said the same thing,
"He keeps chips in his refrigerator

1439
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:41,880
because no one looks in the fridge
if they're robbing him."

1440
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,883
-Oh, that's funny!
-That's genius.

1441
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,927
-Better than the Bernie.
-That's what I'm doing.

1442
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,179
That's fantastic.

1443
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:50,639
Wow.

1444
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,559
You guys are lucky to get to work with him
that way.

1445
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,102
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1446
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,856
There's a few people in my career...

1447
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:00,816
It's like why I go to the fights

1448
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:02,359
if I know Mayweather is fighting.

1449
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,320
Because I know this guy is great
and he's only got

1450
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,155
so many fights in him.

1451
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:07,364
This guy.

1452
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,576
[Shannon] I was going to say
I really liked him right away.

1453
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,619
I just saw him...

1454
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,455
I felt like I understood him
a different way.

1455
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:17,041
I felt deep down
he was actually very, very shy.

1456
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:17,958
[Sandler] Oh, yeah.

1457
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,418
-[Shannon] Don't you think?
-Very shy.

1458
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,378
-And sweet.
-[Shannon] And so sweet.

1459
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,922
He talked about your parents a lot.

1460
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,675
He loved his dad more than anything.

1461
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,260
He talked about his dad a lot.

1462
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,138
He loved his mom, his brother...

1463
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:33,015
-and his boy.
-Deeply, so sensitive.

1464
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:35,768
When you lost your dad, Dave,
and you were talking about that,

1465
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,771
I'm sure he really wanted
to make you feel so good.

1466
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,482
So sweet and thoughtful,
probably thought deeply

1467
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,567
about that that's how
he would approach it.

1468
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:47,279
It was very, it seemed very thoughtful.

1469
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:52,076
And wildly, disarmingly empathetic.

1470
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:57,790
It's very rare that I'd meet somebody
in a professional situation

1471
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:02,044
that made me put my dukes down like that.

1472
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:05,005
Like, defenseless...

1473
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:08,008
This guy doesn't have an ounce
of judgment in him

1474
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,677
unless it's hilarious.

1475
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,597
-Yeah.
-And Dave, when does that movie come out?

1476
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,182
[laughter]

1477
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,934
I remember when you did that movie.

1478
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:18,227
-Yeah.
-I remember that.

1479
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,562
The irony,
I really did try to get out of it.

1480
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,650
But I couldn't imagine my life
without having done it

1481
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,902
or getting to spend that time with him.

1482
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:31,115
Do we know if he did any of this material
in front of an audience?

1483
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,702
We knew some from that tour. That tour
was right before Corona, I think...

1484
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:41,250
Remember the day before the lockdown,
Norm had some set that went viral.

1485
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:45,754
-He did?
-It was a cookie jar dunk.

1486
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,881
It was, it was...

1487
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:51,844
I remember me and my buddies
in Ohio were all like,

1488
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,096
"Yo, did you see this Norm Macdonald set?"
It was on YouTube.

1489
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,389
Probably still on there.

1490
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,641
He destroyed.

1491
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:01,478
-He even--
-Right. At the Improv.

1492
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:04,523
When he talked about the pandemic.

1493
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,900
-It was incredible.
-It was a cookie jar dunk.

1494
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,569
And you could tell it was off the rip.

1495
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:14,950
It was all the anxiety the day before
the whole world goes into lockdown.

1496
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:17,327
-Yeah.
-And he was just on some...

1497
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,746
"Fuck it."
It felt so good.

1498
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:23,000
Again, it made me feel like everything's
going to be fine.

1499
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:27,129
If he were alive and were doing this show
that we watched tonight

1500
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:29,882
somewhere in front of two, three hundred,
four hundred people...

1501
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,509
killer, standing O?

1502
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:34,178
What would be the impact?

1503
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:38,807
The question to me is he's clearly
touching on some third rail stuff.

1504
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:41,852
And it really depends on its...

1505
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:47,232
Yeah, he didn't have to leave
on a big laugh.

1506
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:51,278
He would go on,
some of his shit would murder.

1507
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,530
Some of his shit would eat it,

1508
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,617
some people would get annoyed,
upset that he said it.

1509
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,369
Then, like most of us, you go,

1510
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,706
"Let me get out of this fucking hole
and come up with a big joke

1511
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:04,291
because I'm about to get off."

1512
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:07,794
He'd go, "All right.
Let's keep going down.

1513
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:09,213
We'll get out on that."

1514
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,674
I'm certain that twenty-five minutes
of this would kill.

1515
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:13,592
-Yeah.
-Right.

1516
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,929
This would probably be about, with laughs,

1517
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:21,600
it would have...
35, 38 minutes. Easy.

1518
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:24,603
You'd have notes...
you'd have people saying--

1519
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:27,022
[Spade]
Yeah, if you tried it, practiced it.

1520
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:29,107
Plus that cannibal stuff.

1521
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,152
When he says, "It gets on red,
I go, 'Fuck, so close!'"

1522
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:36,365
There's some stuff
that's for sure laugh lines.

1523
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:37,950
It would work anywhere.

1524
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,160
Then he pulls you away from it
for a while.

1525
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,329
And they're trickier stuff.

1526
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:43,664
It's trickier to figure it out.

1527
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:45,040
And he would lose some people.

1528
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:48,001
It's hard to separate...
I'd buy it.

1529
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,670
You know what I mean?
I'm in.

1530
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,129
-Yeah.
-[Letterman] That's right.

1531
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,130
Yeah.

1532
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,341
It's like watching a four-hour Mooney set.

1533
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,885
At a certain point it's like,
I'm just invested in this

1534
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,387
as an experience.

1535
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:01,098
And it's really hard to separate
myself from it.

1536
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:05,185
It's fun to watch him acknowledge
what would be the silence.

1537
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,603
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1538
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,730
-I can see.
-And enjoy it.

1539
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:09,815
-Yeah.
-Enjoy it.

1540
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:14,027
I can see the...
In his mind there was a crowd there.

1541
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,613
He was anticipating his crowd.

1542
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:22,286
Which reminds me again, this guy was very
deliberate in how he approached this.

1543
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:24,121
'Cause it does seem like jazz.

1544
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:25,539
It was very methodical.

1545
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:28,292
It's funny because he's... you know.

1546
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:35,007
All I've ever heard about Norm is that he
was the most widely read comedian.

1547
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,717
Very widely read.

1548
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,260
Highly intelligent.

1549
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:44,933
I think a great, you know, mathematician.
Things that you would never think.

1550
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:48,103
He was talented in all these areas

1551
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:52,566
and choosing, "What's my diction,
what's my word going to be?"

1552
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,109
"What's the right word here?

1553
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:55,986
What's it exactly going to be?"

1554
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,404
So you get this...

1555
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:59,656
Because he seems reckless,

1556
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,618
but he's also ruthlessly planned
everything out

1557
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,702
and thought it through.

1558
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,579
They don't seem to go together.

1559
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:06,705
But with him, they do.

1560
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:07,956
Yeah.

1561
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,416
But was his...
I'm sorry, Molly.

1562
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:13,795
I was going to say before...
in the last, whatever, 13, 14 years,

1563
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:18,550
he got, as you say, Conan, he was reading
four or five books at a time.

1564
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,926
Russian literature,

1565
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,220
Mark Twain
was his favorite author.

1566
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,640
He loved <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>.

1567
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:30,228
But he got really into reading
about God and Christianity.

1568
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:34,441
-Oh, yeah.
-Really wanting to understand God.

1569
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,736
-Where he's headed?
-And feeling maybe close to death.

1570
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,780
-Yeah, sure.
-Or thinking about death,

1571
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:42,366
but really, really wanting
to understand God.

1572
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:44,785
I don't know how everyone else felt here,

1573
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:47,871
but Norm got sick for quite a while

1574
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:49,039
and he got sicker

1575
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:50,082
and I didn't know.

1576
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:53,502
I talked to so many people
who I was sure knew.

1577
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:56,004
I thought, maybe I'm the only one
that doesn't know.

1578
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,756
So many...
He didn't want anybody to know.

1579
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:58,799
I didn't know.

1580
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:00,759
And...

1581
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:04,971
so, you know,
being the self-absorbed person I am,

1582
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,100
I think a lot of us, we thought,
"Is he mad at me?"

1583
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,768
"Is there something I did?"

1584
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:12,312
Because we kept trying to get him
to come back on

1585
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:16,108
and we couldn't.
He couldn't do it.

1586
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,526
'Cause I don't think he was up for it.

1587
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:21,071
And he didn't want to answer questions
about maybe his appearance,

1588
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:22,739
-but I remembered...
-Yeah.

1589
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:27,160
...when he went,
everybody in the community was...

1590
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,580
we all thought we were the only one
that didn't know.

1591
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:36,420
We were so upset that we didn't get a
chance to tell him what he meant to us.

1592
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:41,091
I very quickly realized
he would not have tolerated that.

1593
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:43,427
He didn't want any of us to tell him...

1594
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:46,638
-He'd get grossed out.
-He'd get very unhappy.

1595
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,849
Treat him different or laugh at his jokes.

1596
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:51,893
You reflect on experiences
you had with him

1597
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,520
during the time he was ill

1598
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:57,441
and wondered if that had manifest itself
because of the illness.

1599
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:58,400
[Spade] Right.

1600
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:01,570
I'm curious as to what his process was,
if you knew how he wrote.

1601
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:04,489
My experience was so chaotic.

1602
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,075
You know, I thought this guy
is Evel Knievel.

1603
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:10,162
He's going to jump Snake River Canyon,
he doesn't care.

1604
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:13,248
But he put a ton of work
into what he was doing.

1605
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,709
And worked it out a lot of the time.

1606
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,670
So, I don't know what that process was,

1607
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:23,091
but this really impressed me
with how self-contained it is.

1608
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,676
-[Letterman] Yeah.
-And how...

1609
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,388
He scribbled a lot of stuff
down all the time.

1610
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:30,098
He was just like most comedians.

1611
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,934
He was constantly writing his jokes down.

1612
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,352
-[Letterman] It's a lot of work.
-Yeah.

1613
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,856
-No laughs. A lot of work.
-[Sandler] Yeah.

1614
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:41,234
You said something that reminded me of...

1615
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,320
I don't know what story he was telling.

1616
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:46,490
But the story was,
in the beginning of the story

1617
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:49,534
he's telling, he used to go
to this Christian Revival Church.

1618
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:54,122
He goes, "I don't really believe
any of this stuff."

1619
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,749
I go, "Then why'd you go?"

1620
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:59,252
I love what he said, I don't remember what
he was talking about.

1621
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,338
He goes, "Because it made me feel good."

1622
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:05,884
And the last time I saw him was
at The Comedy Store.

1623
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:09,930
And he was uncharacteristically emotional.

1624
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:12,015
-Yeah.
-And like he...

1625
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:15,769
when we parted company, he was.

1626
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:18,438
There's a picture of me and him.

1627
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,732
And the back of Chris Rock's head.

1628
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,858
I put it in my special.

1629
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:25,237
That picture, it's at the end
of <i>The Closer,</i>

1630
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:28,824
was the last time that I saw him.

1631
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,201
-[Shannon] Wow.
-And he stood there.

1632
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:34,246
He came up, he stood behind me,
I looked, hey, looked up.

1633
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:40,502
And I realized he was posing
for the picture, in hindsight.

1634
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,337
-[Sandler] Uh-huh.
-Like a gift.

1635
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,713
That's nice.

1636
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,550
It was a very fitting goodbye.

1637
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,261
-That is so sweet, Dave.
-Yeah.

1638
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:54,808
Hey, man, what about when he was emotional
saying goodbye to you on the show?

1639
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:57,644
At the time, like Conan suggests,

1640
01:20:57,727 --> 01:21:00,355
I didn't know he was ill.
So, surprised.

1641
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:02,190
In thinking about that moment,

1642
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:05,735
he must have known a great deal
about what his future was

1643
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,320
and how long it might have been.

1644
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,908
I always took it
as an enormous compliment

1645
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:15,662
that my emotional situation
had affected him.

1646
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:18,248
-[Sandler] Right.
-But now, to be fair,

1647
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:22,002
this guy knew more
than just I was leaving.

1648
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:24,713
Well, he was crazy about you. I mean...

1649
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:26,047
-Absolutely.
-That's very sweet.

1650
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,466
I saw him on your show once and he said,

1651
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,386
"I've seen more sunsets
than I will ever see."

1652
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:33,847
He said that to you on the show.

1653
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,473
In case you hear different.

1654
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,350
-I'm sorry to interrupt, though.
-[O'Brien] No, that's okay.

1655
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:40,312
I probably cut him off and said,
"We got to get to Al Roker now."

1656
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,772
He probably was about
to say something very profound.

1657
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,566
I'm like, "That's great, Norm.

1658
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:48,111
Al Roker's here. He came up three floors
to be with us tonight.

1659
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,906
And he's got nothing.
Al Roker."

1660
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:54,701
I saw him at the <i>SNL </i>40th.

1661
01:21:54,784 --> 01:21:59,164
I didn't know he had cancer or anything,

1662
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:02,000
but I remember as soon as he told me,
he was like,

1663
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,502
"I love you, Molly."
He blurted it out right away.

1664
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,881
I think I was like...
I just had a sense of like,

1665
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,384
I could feel
that he had this kind of urgency

1666
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:15,555
to say exactly what was on his mind
in the moment.

1667
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,515
Because maybe he'll never
have that moment again.

1668
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:20,769
I was like,
"Something's different with Norm."

1669
01:22:22,228 --> 01:22:25,148
The last time I saw him with any
regularity was

1670
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:27,692
we all went on a tour to do stand-up.

1671
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:28,985
The three of you guys?

1672
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,237
-[Sandler] And a couple of other guys.
-We had a text chain of a bunch of us.

1673
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,114
-We had a text chain.
-We'd all fuck around.

1674
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,951
And then one time he was arguing
with Schneider about something

1675
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,160
about stand-up
and he goes,

1676
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:39,871
"I'm the best comic out of all of us."

1677
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,331
And everyone went...
"Yeah."

1678
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:44,626
-Yeah. That's true.
-No one fought back.

1679
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:46,753
-They go, "Okay."
-You're right.

1680
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:48,505
I think that's fair, honestly.

1681
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:50,340
And we go, "Sure."

1682
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:51,716
But he was...

1683
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:55,762
the nice thing is we were flying around
or on the bus or backstage,

1684
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:58,473
he would come in and do bits.

1685
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:01,059
He wanted to keep--
I like that, you know?

1686
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,311
People are still funny,
and he's a good laugher.

1687
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,647
And that's always nice when a comic
is a good laugher too,

1688
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:08,608
instead of just only going
one way with it.

1689
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,903
They like to crack up with people,
and it was... that was a fucking blast.

1690
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,446
Didn't he wear a cowboy hat
the whole time?

1691
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,908
He bought a cowboy hat.
Norm all of a sudden with a cowboy hat.

1692
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,411
-Walking around.
-It was so weird.

1693
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,037
On stage he would sit sometimes.

1694
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,580
He sometimes would sit.

1695
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,083
Sometimes he'd be late in the morning,

1696
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:29,087
because we're all taking off and I'd go,

1697
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:32,799
"I would just go ahead.
Norm, man, we got to get to this place."

1698
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:34,300
And he'd give me a look.

1699
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,511
Then after he passed away I realized

1700
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:38,179
he was giving me a look like,

1701
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:41,099
"What the fuck do you want from me?
I'm going through some shit."

1702
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:44,310
He'd be like, "Yeah, all right."

1703
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:47,188
But never any deeper knowledge of it?

1704
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:50,650
-Never anything.
-Yeah. Wow.

1705
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:52,986
He did get emotional a lot, though.

1706
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:56,031
On the whole tour,
he would just all of a sudden

1707
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,699
get really teary-eyed and stuff

1708
01:23:57,782 --> 01:24:00,076
and he'd be like, "This is wonderful."

1709
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,912
The tour itself.
And hanging out.

1710
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,330
We'd have dinners and breakfast.

1711
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,373
-[Spade] Yeah.
-And shit.

1712
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,793
And he was more...
He'd just be so fun to see.

1713
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,962
He had so much energy to hang.

1714
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,590
The hard part about not telling people,

1715
01:24:13,673 --> 01:24:16,134
which, it would worry
me a little bit, is...

1716
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:20,180
I got slightly angry
because during the thing,

1717
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:22,807
he would set up dinners with me
and he would keep canceling.

1718
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:26,186
I didn't know if it was a bit or...
but it got frustrating

1719
01:24:26,269 --> 01:24:30,148
because I go, "If you're scared of Corona,
just come over to the house.

1720
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:32,442
It will just be me and you,
we'll sit across or whatever."

1721
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:35,028
"Yeah, that's what I want.

1722
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:36,988
I'd like just a good night with Davey."

1723
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,740
And then he goes...

1724
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,575
That night I go, "Where are you?"
He goes,

1725
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,619
"I can't, it's COVID."

1726
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:45,121
I go, "I know, we just talked about this."

1727
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:47,248
And then a week later:
"Do you want to have dinner?"

1728
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:50,502
And I go... fighting to fuck him up.

1729
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:51,920
But I don't even know if it was--

1730
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:53,713
I think he would maybe think about it

1731
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:56,007
and then he'd go, "I don't feel good,"
or something.

1732
01:24:56,091 --> 01:25:00,261
But later I was getting irritated
because I'm like,

1733
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:02,597
"You can come over."
I didn't know what was going on,

1734
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,849
but if I did, of course,
I'd go, "Whatever you want."

1735
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,393
I'm a little like that
because I would love to have dinner

1736
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:08,895
with each of you
but it will never happen.

1737
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,438
[all laugh]

1738
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:12,190
We've all tried, Dave.

1739
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,734
We've all tried. [laughs]
