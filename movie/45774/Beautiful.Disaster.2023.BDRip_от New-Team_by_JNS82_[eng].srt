because it is relevant.

If equilibrium is achieved,

290
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,731
that means that both players
can't increase payoff

00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,119
I don't need this because I'm
not getting on that thing.

334
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,787
- Yeah, you are.

335
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,164
- Do you know the statistics
of motorcycles in accidents?

336
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,959
No, I'm not putting
on that thing.

337
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,293
- Yeah, you are.

338
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,755
[helmet thudding]

339
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,757
I can do this all night.

340
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:22,761
- [sighs] Fine.

341
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:24,638
[scanner beeps]

342
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,931
- [Travis] Thanks, Miguel.
- Yep.

343
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,768
- You're really not gonna
let me buy you dinner?

344
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,395
- No, this isn't a date.

345
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,272
- Yes, I'm aware.

346
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,815
You've said that twice now.

347
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:35,816
- [Abby] Oh, you noticed.

348
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,401
- Mm-hm.

349
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:38,402
That and your outfit,

350
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,612
which screams "I detest Travis."

351
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:41,905
- I don't detest you.

352
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,158
I just don't like being
a foregone conclusion

353
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,036
for one of the many, many,
many notches on your bedpost.

354
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,580
- Oh, you're smart.

355
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,165
I like that.

356
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,791
- Something you're probably
not used to in a woman.

357
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,294
- Oh, I'm striking out.

358
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,712
I surrender.

359
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,046
We can at least be friends.

360
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,840
- Friends, but with no benefits.

361
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,342
- We're not sleeping together.

362
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,470
I won't even think
about the benefits

363
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,888
unless you want me to.

364
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,807
- No, that can't happen so
that we can stay friends.

365
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:10,976
- Friends.

366
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:12,644
Friends.

367
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,773
I've been coming to
this place for years.

368
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,817
My family home is only
three miles that way.

369
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,152
- Aw.

370
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,488
You couldn't move farther
away from your mommy?

371
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,530
- No, that's not it.

372
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,284
- Her grilled cheese
was just that good?

373
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,702
- Well, she's dead.

374
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:29,870
- [chuckles] Shut up.

375
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,333
Are you serious?

376
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,668
[Travis chuckles]

377
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,087
I'm such an asshole,
I'm so sorry.

378
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,756
I feel horrible.
- It's okay, it's okay.

379
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,216
I was only three.

380
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,717
- Okay, I'm not that sorry.

381
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,676
Get your hand off me.

382
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,638
How's your dad?

383
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,516
- He's still alive, so
you can make fun of him.

384
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,308
[Abby chuckles]

385
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,559
He's a good man.

386
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,810
He raised five boys
all on his own.

387
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,395
- Five Maddox brothers?

388
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,647
- Yeah.

389
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,857
Thomas, Taylor, Tyler,
Trent, and Travis.

390
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,568
If you wanna get
good at fighting,

391
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,861
having four older brothers
beat your ass daily

392
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,029
is a good place to start.

393
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:04,988
- But why do it?

394
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,783
- College ain't cheap.

395
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,284
Fighting is a good
way to make money.

396
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,828
- Just seems
unnecessarily risky.

397
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,955
- Why?

398
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,456
You worried about me?

399
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,250
- Not even in the slightest.

400
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,294
- What's your story?

401
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,548
- Just your average girl
from your ordinary town.

402
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,758
- Oh, mom and dad?

403
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,717
- One of each.

404
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,803
- Wow, you're a
wealth of information.

405
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,138
- Well, I can't give away
all the goods in one night.

406
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,473
- Most do.

407
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:32,766
I actually enjoy it.

408
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,727
Are you seriously leaving?

409
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,271
- Dinner's over.

410
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,564
- We just got started.

411
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,440
- Good night, Travis.

412

[gentle instrumental music]

414
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,244
- Hey, purple sweater.

415
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,870
Little help?
- Yeah.

[frisbee thuds]

417

- [crowd] Ooh!

- Oh, no! [grunting]

- He's, he's fine.

[Parker grunting]

424
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,591
Okay, it's okay.

425
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,717
He's okay.

426
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,759
- I'm fine.

427
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,802
- Okay, are you okay?

428
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,053
- Oh, I'm fine.

429
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,722
- Okay, I'm so sorry.
[Parker grunting]

Oh!

432
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,392
- You're so cute
and you're crying,

433
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,852
I swear.
- I'm not, I'm not crying.

434
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,146
It's, uh, it's the wind.

435
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,565
How long have you been captain
of the Frisbee club? [groans]

436
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,025
- Oh, no, no, no,
I'm not captain

437
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:23,817
of the Frisbee club.
- Oh, it was, uh,

438
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:24,735
it was a joke.

439
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,902
It was a joke, I'll be okay.

440
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:26,862
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

441
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,739
- Hi, I'm Abby.

442
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,531
- I'm gonna go.

443
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,575
I'm, I'm gonna wobble.

444
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,368
- You should put some
ice on your balls.

445
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,787
- You should put
some ice on my balls.

446
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:36,747
- Okay. [chuckles]

447
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,082
- [Parker] Oh,
yeah, I'm gonna go.

448
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,126
- It was really nice
to meet you, Parker.

449

[ball whooshes and thuds]

- Oh!
- [Parker groans]

451
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,838
- Thanks, man.

452
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,756
- [man] Fuck you!

453
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,882
- Be careful!

Ow.

459
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,772
Could someone turn
the water back on?

460
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,065
[bags thudding]

461
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,775
So the RA said we're
gonna be without water

462
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,361
for the next 24 hours, so
it's just for the night.

463
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,780
Are you sure Shepley
is cool with this?

464
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,615
- Hey, Abby's staying over.

465
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,867
- Just stay out of
Travis's room, all right?

466
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:14,660
- What?

467
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,952
You didn't tell me

468
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:16,870
that Travis lives here.
- No, of course I did.

469
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:17,454
No, remember, I told you.

470
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:18,538
No, no, no, no,

471
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,790
no, no, no.
- I'm not staying here.

472
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:20,874
- Abby, Abby!
- No, I'm leaving.

473
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,542
- No, I promise you
will never see him.

474
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,460
He's never even here.

475
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,753
You won't see him, I promise.

476
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:25,796
You have to stay,
It'll be so fun.

477
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,964
Hey, tell her that
Travis will be okay.

478
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:28,965
- [Shepley] Oh, he won't
care, he likes you.

479
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,050
- He doesn't know me.

480
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:30,967
- He likes you.

481
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:31,885
We're gonna have a sleepover.

482
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,845
So much fun, we'll make s'mores.

483

Hey, let's go.

Where'd you go?

489
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,905
Could you return the call
or at least text me back?

- [Abby] Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

497
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:10,298
[gentle music]

498
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,134
[door creaks and clicks]

499
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,677
[footsteps tapping]

500
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,012
- [Carmen] Excuse me.
[speaks in foreign language]

501
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:16,805
- [Abby] Sure.

502
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:17,889
- [Carmen] Okay, merci.

503
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,812
[door thuds]

504
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,273

[floor creaks]

506
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,743
- [Abby] [screams] Jesus.

507
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,660
- Enjoy the show?

508
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,036
- You scared the crap out of me.

509
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,872
- You know that's not
a very attractive idiom

510
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,248
once you stop and
think about it.

511
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,958
- Because in your
sexist universe,

512
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,668
women don't actually defecate?

513
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,087
- Wow, that's a perfect
word for someone like you.

514
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,466
Did you know that the saying
used to be "bejesus out of me?"

515
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,677
- Your friend gave this
to me to give to you.

516
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,596
[paper crumples and thuds]

517
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,930
What?

518
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,223
The woman that you
just had sex with

519
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,476
gives you her number and
you just throw it away?

520
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,144
- That's not her
leaving her number.

521
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,979
That's her marking
her territory.

522
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,898
- Well, then maybe you
shouldn't have sex with her.

523
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,941
- I don't remember
promising her a thing.

524
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,359
- Wow.

525
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,236
You embody everything that
is wrong with your gender.

526
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,237
She's an adult.

527
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,030
I'm an adult.

528
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,740
It was consensual.

529
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,283
Look at this.

530
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,701
- Consent date.

531
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,411
- [Travis] Can never be
too careful nowadays.

532
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,413
- How many women do you
have contracts with?

533
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,916
- [Travis] No idea, I'm a
quality guy over quantity.

534
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,043
- [groans] I'm gonna throw up.

535
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,836
- Well, my bedroom
is down the hall

536
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,963
and the bed is all yours
for when you wanna crash.

537
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,215
- I'm not gonna
sleep in your bed.

538
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,132
- Why?

539
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,092
No one but me sleeps in my bed.

540
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,177
My bed is sacred ground.

541
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,179
- Well, then why would I
be allowed in your bed?

542
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,264
- Are you planning on
having sex with me tonight?

543
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,098
- No.

544
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,309
- Then it's settled.

545
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,148
[door clicks]

546
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,817
Wow, make yourself at home.

547
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,486
- Sorry, I just have a big
10 a.m. Bio test to cram for,

548
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,029
but I can move back
to the kitchen.

549
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,197
- No, you're fine,
stay where you're at.

550
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,573
Don't be silly. [groans]

551
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,950
- Thank you.

552
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,201
- Do you want me to make
you some tea or something?

553
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,453
- No, but, uh, my
highlighter just died.

554
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,746
Can I borrow one?

555
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,164
- Oh, yeah, check
the top drawer.

556
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,334
Wait, um,

557
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,168
no.

558
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,004
- Wow.

559
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,005
That's a lot.

560
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,133
- Is practicing safe
sex a crime? [chuckles]

561
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,053
- What's this?

562
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,471
- It's not a highlighter,
I'll tell you that.

563
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:24,432
[device vibrating]

564
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,477
Um.

565
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,353
- It's a yo-yo?

566
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,105
- No, definitely not.

567
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,022
It's awkward.

568
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,649
I'm gonna go shower.

569
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,825
[disinfectant hissing]

570
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,954

[singers vocalizing]

577
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:46,973
- [giggling] What are you doing?

578
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,186
[cat squeaking]

579
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,271
[Abby laughs]

580
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,315
Bad kitty.
[cat squeaking]

581
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,193
Mouse. [giggles]

582
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,277
Mouse.

583
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,116
[Abby giggling]
- Abby.

584
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,035
Pigeon.
- Really cute.

585
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:07,869
How much?

586
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,121
- Um.

587
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,124
It's not what do
you think it is.

588
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,127
Abby, you're...

589
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,171
- Wait, what are you doing?

590
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,006
[Abby screaming]

591
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,133
[wings whooshing]

592
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,135
[door clicks]

593
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,178
- [Shepley] Abby!

594
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,179
- [America] Abby!

595
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,097
- [Travis] What the heck?

596
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,098
- [Abby] What is wrong with you?

597
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:28,848
- I didn't do anything.

598
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,100
You touched me.

599
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,810
- Oh, says the man with
the raging hard-on.

600
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,019
You should be locked up.

601
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,562
- You're the sleepy
cock toucher.

602
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,231
I didn't put your hand there.

603
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,149
And if you bothered to
read a biology textbook,

604
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,526
you'd find out

605
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,860
that it's called
parasympathetic nerve response

606
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:41,820
and you'd know that
if you knew anything

607
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,363
about biology or men.

608
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,698
- Oh, shit, Bio!

609
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,657
What time is it?

610
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:46,658
- 9:42.

611
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,575
- Oh, my God.

612
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,452
- [both] What are you wearing?

613
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,412
- We were playing.
- We were

614
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,246
playing.

615
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,248
- Let me give you a ride.

616
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,250
- No, this is just a madhouse.

617
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,669
A nurse?

618
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,503
- Yeah, no, I...

619
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,547
- Sorry, excuse me.

620
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,674
[gentle instrumental music]

621
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,758
Sorry.

622
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,759
Oh, my God!

623
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,178
[Abby groans]

624
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,224
[crowd chattering]

625
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,686
[phone beeps]

626
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,564
I slipped.

627
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,274
But I still aced my Bio test.

628
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,776
- [chuckles] Well, I'm glad
you're not drawing attention

629
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:22,569
to yourself.

630
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,279
- [Abby] Hilarious.

631
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,655
- Okay, I have to run to class,

632
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,073
but I want a full play-by-play
of what happened last night.

633
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,158
- Nothing happened last night.

634
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,075
- Yeah?
- I do not like him.

635
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:29,451
- Yeah,

636
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,244
and that's why you're giving
him a good morning handy.

637
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,913
[phone beeps]

638
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,624
Is Mick still bothering you?

639
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,917
- [Abby] Yeah.

640
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,669
- You got to cut him
out of your life.

641
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:40,879
- He is out of my life.

642
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,880
- He is not out of your life

643
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,423
because he is still texting you.

644
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:44,799
I-I gotta go to class.

645
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:45,592
- What?

646
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,430
- Hey.

647
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,098
Parker, we meet again.

648
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,851
- Abby, are you okay?

649
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,312
- Yeah, yeah, it's a
long story. [chuckles]

650
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,731
Hey, um, how are
your, your balls?

651
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,316
- Not good.

652
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,358
- Oh, my God.

653
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,985
- That's okay.

654
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:07,405
I think they said I had a 20%
chance of a normal sex life.

655
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,492
- Are you messing with me?

656
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,409
- Not funny?

657
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,329
- No, it was, it was hilarious.

658
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,414
Well, um, okay, bye.

659
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,333
- Do you have dinner
plans tonight?

660
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,751
- Me?

661
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,044
- Yes.

662
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,463
- No, I-I-I-I do not
have dinner plans.

663
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,423
- I know a great Italian spot.

664
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:28,510
- Um, um...

665
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,220
- Is that a, is that?
- [gasps] No, that is a yes.

666
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,097
Yes, I would love
that very much.

667
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,891
Pick me up at seven, I
live at Tucker dormitory.

668
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,726
- Sure, I'll pick you up then.

669
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:37,602
- Okay.

670
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,436
Bye.

671
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,523
[gentle music]

672
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,357
I see you!

673
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:49,030
[laughs] Oh, Parker.

674
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,406
Really?

675
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,324
Thank you.

676
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,242
Thank you, Parker.

677
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,243
[phone beeps]

678
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,453
Oh, no way, Travis Maddox.

679
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:59,124
You can keep knocking but I
am not gonna answer that door.

680
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,127
No way. [laughs]

681
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,294
I'll see you soon, Parker.

682
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,005
- Thanks again, Sonny.

683
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:06,923
- Anytime, doctor.

684
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,676
- Doctor Hayes.

685
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,636
- He's jumping
the gun, you know.

686
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,471
I just started, that's all.

687
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,682
- Wow, fancy-fancy.

688
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,516
- Yeah.

689
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:19,435
Wow.

690
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,438
- Are you on call?

691
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,358
- No, I-I just got a heads-up
about a show tonight.

692
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,277
- Oh, oh, I can get
my own ride home.

693
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,279
- No, no, no, we-we
should both go.

694
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,865
Unless you've got work
or sick of seeing me.

695
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:32,949
- No.

696
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,492
No, I would love to go.

697
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,202
- This is-this is gonna be fun.

698
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,329
[Abby chuckles]

699
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,540
- You know, I've always wanted
to see Titus Andronicus.

700
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,960
It's considered to be
Shakespeare's most violent play.

701
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,253
- You don't mind violence?

702
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,380
- No, I was something
of a tomboy growing up.

703
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,300
- Well, then you're
in for a treat.

704
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:51,676
- Ooh, I guess it's starting.

705
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,679
- [speaks indistinctly]
...he's a state champ.

706
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,181
He's gonna come out swinging.

707
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,682
He's not gonna be
wasting any sort of time.

708
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,058
Okay, what are you doing?

709
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,895
- Abby hasn't texted
me back today.

710
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:02,812
- Oh, my God.

711
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,272
Would you forget about Abby?

712
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,690
Have you, have
you seen this guy?

713
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,569
He's got a white robe and
a belt that's huge, okay?

714
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,446
I mean, you're acting like
the kissing booth over here.

715
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,156
You need to focus.

716
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,324
[hand slaps]

717
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:15,617
- I am focused.

718
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,536
[hands slapping]

719
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,455
- [scoffs] That's
the Travis we need.

720
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,081
Come on.

721
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:24,334
- I just don't know why
she hasn't texted me back.

722
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,335
I'm gonna go outside and see

723
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,711
if I can get better
cell reception.

724
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:27,503
[upbeat music]

725
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,214
- We're dead.

726
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,883
[crowd cheering and clapping]

727
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,593
- Oh, wow, modern
interpretation.

728
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,636
I love Shakespeare.

729
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,846
[foot thuds]

730
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:39,933
[crowd cheering and clapping]

731
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:40,850
- All right, all right.

732
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:43,478
Next up, we have the main event:

733
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,522
Freddy Heflin versus
Travis "Mad Dog" Maddox!

734
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,444
- This is gonna be great.

735
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,696
Travis is a real animal.

736
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,618
Are you okay?

737
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,746
- Yeah, yeah, it's just
a little hot in here.

738
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,249
I'm gonna go find a bathroom.

739
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,124
[door clicks]

740
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,292
- What the fuck, Abby?

741
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,254
You don't respond
to any of my texts,

742
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,381
and now you're here
dressed like that

743
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,298
with your titties hanging out.

744
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,967
- They are not hanging out.

745
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,969
This is a tasteful
amount of cleavage.

746
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,886
- Yeah?

747
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:17,804
Well, they're distracting me.

748
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,013
- Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

749
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,432
It's all about
you, you egomaniac.

750
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:22,892
- I must break you.

751
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,602
- Go for it.

752
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,730
- That's who you're fighting?

753
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:28,648
- Yes.

754
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,275
- That guy could kill you.

755
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,069
- Is this your weird little
way of admitting you like me?

756
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,487
- I don't like you.

757
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:35,571
But I do worry about you.

758
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:36,781
I worry about the planet.

759
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,491
They're two very
different things.

760
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,994
- Okay, well, if it
puts your mind at ease,

761
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,412
he's not even gonna hit me.

762
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:43,454
- Hilarious.

763
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,289
- Are you doubting me?

764
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,123
- Yeah.

765
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,292
- Care to make it interesting?

766
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,584
- Make it interesting?

767
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,502
Like a bet?

768
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:50,295
- [Travis] Yeah.

769
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,421
- I don't bet.

770
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,422
[door clicks]

771
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,423
- Come on, Travis,
they need you.

772
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,966
- Yeah, just a minute.

773
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,551
How's this?

774
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,720
If he manages to
lay a hand on me,

775
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,847
I'll go without sex for a week.

776
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,348
- Ooh.

777
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,182
- A month.

778
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,934
Three months.

779
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,436
- Three months?

780
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,646
That's impossible
for someone like you.

781
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:12,984
- Okay, and if I win, you have
to stay with me for a month.

782
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,110
- You're on.

783
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,486
But get it through your head,

784
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,990
I am never having sex with you.

785
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,536
- I don't wanna have
sex with you, pidge.

786
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:25,288
I wanna be around you.

787
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,123
You're good for me.

788
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,503
[crowd cheering]

789
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:34,964
You are handsome.

790
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:35,757
- You're dead.

791
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,383

00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:42,388
- Hah.

794
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,557
You are handsome as hell.

795
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,850
No wonder you're the champ.

796
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:47,894
Champ of my heart.

00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,396
[punches whooshing]

798
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,647
- Come on, hit him!

799
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,066
- You ever hiked
Brokeback Mountain?

800
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,526
Do you wanna?

801
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,028
- I'll be gentle, you know.

802
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,281
- How are you gonna
kill me, big boy?

803
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,284
[punches whooshing]

804
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:04,118
Giddy up.

805
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,544
- [woman]
- [indistinctly] ...kill you!

806

[Freddy growling]

808
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,591
- What are you doing?

809
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:19,675
- Shut up.

810
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:20,760
[Freddy grunting]
[fists whooshing]

811
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,095
- Hit him!

[cage clanks]

814
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:25,765
Just once!

[Freddy grunting]

[body thuds]

817
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,105
- Oh-oh, baby fell down.

818
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,107
Get back in your
crib, little baby.

819

Oh-ho-ho.

823
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,449
Now, that one had to hurt.

824
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,910
So I'm saving the upper
left sock drawer for you.

825
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,328

[hand claps]

993
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,354
We got company.

994
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:06,939
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, my.

995
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:09,442
Baby bro is bringing
home a girl.

996
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,068
- Guys, this is Abby.

997
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,404
Abby, these are the moron
twins, Tyler and Taylor.

998
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,363
- Hi.

999
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:15,906
- Fraternal, obviously.

1000
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,783
- And we're not morons.

1001
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:18,868
Travis is the moron.

1002
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,036
- Can you guys not act
like assholes just yet?

1003
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,329
- [both] Oh.

1004
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,248
- Brother's mouthing off
in front of his woman.

1005
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,583
You're a big guy, aren't you?

1006
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,334
- Yeah, you're the big
man on campus, right?

1007
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,294
- Doesn't make any sense.

1008
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,879
- Well, this makes sense.

1009
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,671
[Travis groans]

1010
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:31,464

1013
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:35,426
- [Travis] Get back, Taylor.

1014
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,094
- So immature.

1015
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,263
Oh, you're Abigail, right?

1016
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,055
- Mm-hm.

1017
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,849
- I'm, uh, Trenton.

1018
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,851
The most attractive
Maddox brother.

1019
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:44,935
- [Abby] Hey.

1020
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,103
- Has anyone ever told
you you have the most...

1021
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:46,896
- No!

1022
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:48,022
No.

1023
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,108
- Ladies, not in
front of my bike.

1024
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,401
Take it in the ring.

1025
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:53,819
- [boys] Yes, sir.

1026
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,237
- Put my tools back
where you found them.

1027
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,155
- [boys] Yes, sir.

1028
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,033
- Hey, I'm Jeff.

1029

1032
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:04,955

1033
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:08,083
[boys grunting]

1034
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,168
- So, uh, Abby,

1035
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,339
have you ever experienced
the deliciousness

1036
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,216
of fried chicken from Kentucky?

1037
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,510
- [Tyler] Moron, not every
chicken is from Kentucky.

1038
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,844
- Yeah, it is.

1039
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:19,762
That's why they call it
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1040
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:20,721
- What's going on here?

1041
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:21,514
Are you serious?

1042
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:22,807
You're back.

1043
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:23,766
- What's up, boys?
- [Trenton] Yo.

1044
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:24,683
- Hey.

1045
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:25,559
- Dude, hey, you made it.

1046
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,477
- What's going on?

1047
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,937
- Hey, sorry, uh, work ran late.

1048
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,730
All right, you must
be, um, is it Abby?

1049
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,649
- Yeah, and you're
Thomas, right?

1050
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,900
You're the oldest.

1051
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,568
- I see Travis warned
you about us, huh?

1052
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,278
- [Taylor] Riveting
conversation, let's dig in.

1053
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,071
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1054
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,155
- Grace.

1055
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:41,242
Travis.

1056
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,997
- [sighs] Oh, Heavenly Father.

1057
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,084
Thank you for the food,
for we remember the hungry.

1058
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,169
Please look after our
dear mother, Diane.

1059
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,879
May she rest in peace.

1060
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:54,672
- [all] Amen.

1061
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,631
- Give me.

1062
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:56,549
- Can we?
- Okay.

1063
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,716
- Is this all drumsticks, Dad?

1064
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,009
- I want breasts,

1065
00:36:59,051 --> 00:36:59,969
I want breasts.
- I want breasts.

1066
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,136
- Guys, guys, there's
a lady present.

1067
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,680
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1068
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,931
- Oh, wow.

1069
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:04,849
- They're being nice today.

1070
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,766
Those are some good pieces.

1071
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:07,393
- Really sweet, thank you, guys.

1072
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,603
- Uh, I don't wanna
rain on Travis's parade,

1073
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:12,106
but my shift starts at 10, so
let's get down to business.

1074
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,858
- [Taylor] 10, God.
- That's like...

1075
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,442
- I'm just saying if you
wanna play, let's play.

1076
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:18,153
- I'm gonna have to
whoop your butt fast.

1077
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,321
- Oh, yeah.

1078
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:21,031
I-I can carry some stuff.

1079

[brothers humming]

1080
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,209

game is Texas hold 'em, Abby,

1081
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,127

1082

- Oh, that's not for me.

1083
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,380
Drinks?

- [boys] Yeah.

1085
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,175
- Beer for me and
there's chips up there

1086
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:41,844
and there's dip and
there's like, you know,

1087
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,220
just whatever you can carry.

1088
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,263
- [Abby] Okay.

1089
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:45,055
- Deal, deal, deal,
deal, deal, deal.

1090
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,223
Let's go.

1091
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,433
- [Thomas] Let me get the chip.

1092
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,726
- [Trenton] Got nothing.

1093
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:50,519
- Eat shit.

1094
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,190
Straight on the river and
he does it again, boys.

1095

[boys chattering]

1096
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,610
- Are you kidding me?

1097
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:58,944
- Abby, you've been
watching a while.

1098
00:37:58,986 --> 00:37:59,987
You wanna join?

1099

- Oh, I'm okay.

1100
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,197
- Don't worry.

1101
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,074
We take it easy on
the ladies over here.

1102
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,117
[Abby chuckles]

1103
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,327
- We can play Go
Fish if you like.

1104
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:07,661
- You know, I
actually don't think

1105
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:08,996
it's a question of you
guys going easy on me.

1106
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:10,372
I actually think
it's a question of me

1107
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,166
going easy on you guys.

1108
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,000
- [boys] Oh.

1109
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:16,003
- Okay, you're being serious.

1110
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:16,795

1111
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:17,588

- Okay.

1113
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,091
- Abby, you might
not wanna do that.

1114
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,676
Taylor may look like an idiot,

1115
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,929
but he happens to be one of
the best poker players in town.

1116
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,181
- Oh, in town.

1117
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,140

1118
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,643
- Oh, wow, the county.

1119
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:31,977
- [Tyler] He's
even played on TV.

1120
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:34,355
- Oh, on TV.

1121
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,315
That's pretty
impressive, I don't know.

[intense music]

1126
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,250
Fold, beginner's luck.

1127
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,252
- This is no beginner's luck.

1128
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,171
- Well, I never said
I was a beginner.

1129
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,507
Call.

1130
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:06,220
- Flush.

1131
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,388
- Pair of aces.

1132
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,764
- [twins] Yes!

1133
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:10,057
- Yes!

1134
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,892
- [twins] Da, da,
da, da, da, da, da.

1135
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,602
- Aces and eights, boys.

1136
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:15,396
- Don't tell me!

1137
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,272
That's a full house.

1138
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,190
- Yes, it is.

1139
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,234
- You just got
hustled, bro. [laughs]

1140
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,320
- Well, no, it's only
hustling if I keep your money.

1141
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,113
- Oh.

1142
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,364
- Oh, no, no, no.

1143
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:28,325
Sweetheart, that money's yours.

1144
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,327
You won it fair and square.

1145
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,370
- Shit.

1146
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,747

1147
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,165
- [Abby] Home.

1148
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,250
- Home?

1149
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,293
Where was that?

1150
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,295
- Vegas.

1151
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,339

00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,573
And, uh, nice work, doc.

1475
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:16,908
- Were you in on this?

1476
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,743
- Uh, only for the
last 10 minutes.

1477
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:20,120
Shepley put out an APB for you.

1478
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,372
- Babe, success, success.

1479
00:51:22,414 --> 00:51:23,832
Take some shots.

1480
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:25,208
Told you this would work out,

1481
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,167
did I not, I said it.
- You did, you really did.

1482
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:27,711
Yeah.

1483
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:29,879
- I'm gonna grab us a
drink and I will take this.

1484
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:31,756
- Oh, thank you.

1485
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,675
- How are you, birthday pal?
- Hi.

1486
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:34,551
Thank you.

1487
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,760
- Isn't this great?

1488
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,721
- Yeah, yeah.

1489
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:38,972
Who are all these people?

1490
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,640
- Mm, no idea.

1491
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:41,933
Travis got it in his head

1492
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:42,934
that this was the only
way to say he was sorry

1493
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:45,812
and then Shepley got
like really excited and,

1494
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:47,439
and I couldn't talk
them off the ledge.

1495
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:49,941
- There he is.

1496
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:51,943
I should probably
go talk to Travis.

1497
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,194
- Yeah.

1498
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:54,070
Bye, little bird.

- Hey, it's the
almost birthday girl.

1502
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:04,622
Surprised?

1503
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:06,541
- Yeah, surprised is
an understatement.

1504
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,543
You even recruited Parker.

1505
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:10,003
- Well, he found you.

1506
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:13,840
I should have known that you
guys would be hanging out.

00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,096

Um, well, I'm gonna...

I need to get fucked up.

- Why are you so good at this?

1534
00:53:06,643 --> 00:53:08,061
- I'll be over
there on the sofa.

mean you don't want kids?

and see this thing
through with Travis.

- He's not good for me.

1609

- You keep telling
yourself that.

1610
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:54,310
- Hello, hello.

1611

Okay, thank you.

fuck are you doing?

You heard of alcohol poisoning?

00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,111
You hit double
digits an hour ago.

- Yeah, actually.

You've had enough for tonight.

- No.

- Have you had
anything to eat today?

1620
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:11,202
- Yes, soup.

1621
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:12,662
- Soup?
- Soup.

1622

- Okay, well, that's
gonna end badly for you.

1623

Stop drinking.

- No.

beyond stubborn.

- Oh, I'm so sorry

1627
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,922
I'm not one of your
subservient little wenches.

1628
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:24,340
- Do you know how hard
this was to put together?

1629
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,675
I did all this for you.

1630
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:28,261
- I didn't ask you
to do any of this.

1631
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,139
- I-I know, that's the point.

1632
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,307
I did it because
I care about you.

1633
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,184
- Well, Travis, you're too late.

1634
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:38,646
Tomorrow the bet's over, and
you never have to see me again.

1635
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:42,108

Abby, wait.

1637
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:44,527
- [Abby] Go away!

1638
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:45,611
- Stand still.

1639
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:47,071
I, you're a mess.

1640
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:47,864
Why are you running?

1641
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,032
- You're a mess.

1642
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:49,782
- I'm faster than you.
- No, no, no.

1643
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,284
- Abby!

1644
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:52,618
- Get off, no!

1645
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,911
- Okay, okay, okay.

1646
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:56,080
- You know, you
are such a coward.

1647
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:57,790
You're such a coward.
- You're not making any sense.

1648
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:59,250
- No, you're not.

1649
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:01,085
You just run away from me.

1650
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:03,671
Rather than ask me who Mick was.

1651
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:06,799
You just-you just run away
and then you just throw me

1652
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:11,095
this really big surprise
birthday party for my birthday.

1653
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,555
And you think it's
all gonna be okay

1654
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:14,057
where I don't even know anybody.

1655
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,726
And then you just
ignore me all night.

1656
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:19,312
And you think I'm just
gonna forgive you?

1657
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:23,441
Because you throw me this really
big surprise birthday party

1658
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:26,402
for my birthday where
I don't know anybody.

1659
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,945
- You said that already.

1660
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:29,322
- Stop telling me what to do!

1661
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,990
- Okay, okay.

1662
00:57:31,032 --> 00:57:34,202
First off, I did
apologize to you

1663
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:36,162
and I tried to have a
conversation with you too.

1664
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:37,955
But you ran off to
the fucking library

1665
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:39,999
only to show up
later with Parker

1666
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:42,210
and then proceed to
get beyond fucked up.

1667
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:45,088
So, pidge, you're gonna
have to walk away from me

1668
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,798
because I can't
walk away from you.

Well, I sure hope you're done.

1680
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:19,330
I'm not sure if you have anything
left in there to throw up.

- Not really, no.

I don't.

You know what the best
part about this is, pigeon?

- Hm.

1688
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,014
- You're not gonna
remember any of this.

1689

- I'm not?

- No.

1691
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:43,354
So when I tell you that
I'm madly in love with you.

1692
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,314
- I won't remember.

1693

I love pancakes.

I'll be back.

put your shirt on.

if you were gonna call.

Then the next night, I'm drunk.

that maybe we do
something special.

any fucking money.

2302

I can't play as good

And I need money, I
need money to live.

like a normal person.

look good, okay?

I get it.

2308

This does not look good.

I'll be on the first

Hey, just a thought,

2431
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:10,768
but maybe you wanna check
into the Mirage or the Luxor.

I-I hear they have deals.

Benny's not gonna do anything.

His scam didn't work out
and no one owes him a dime.

Mer, you just have to trust me.

- Hm?
- Why do you call me pigeon?

2441
01:27:30,329 --> 01:27:32,582
- You don't know
what a pigeon is?

2442
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:35,585
- Yeah, it's an annoying bird
that craps on people's heads.

2447
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:44,051
You're my pigeon.

2448
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:47,096
- I'm an exhausted pigeon.

2449
01:27:47,138 --> 01:27:48,097
- I bet.

2450
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,181
- You?

2451
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,851
- I'm gonna stay up
for a little while.

2452
01:27:51,893 --> 01:27:53,394
- Oh.

2453
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:56,480
Are you scared I'm gonna disappear
again if you go to sleep?

2454
01:27:56,522 --> 01:27:57,607
- It crossed my mind.

2455
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:00,610
- I love you.

2456
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:05,865
I love you, Travis Maddox.

2457
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,118
- You love me?

2458
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,620
- It's the tattoos.

2459
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:12,872
- They're pretty cool.

2460
01:28:12,914 --> 01:28:15,416
[Abby giggles]

2461
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,214
Sure you wanna do this?

2462
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:25,343
- [scoffs] Dude, I
was born to ride.

2463
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:27,178
- I think you got some brain
damage back there.

2464
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:29,180
- [scoffs] I love you, Mommy.

2465
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,057
Hey, I'll see you
back at the ranch.

2466
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:32,224
- What?

2467
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:33,517
- Corn.

2472
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:41,150
- [Shepley] Yee-ha!

2473
01:28:41,192 --> 01:28:42,193
- No.

2474
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,695
- [Shepley] I need to
get me one of these.

2475
01:28:44,737 --> 01:28:45,613
Whoo!

2476
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:46,280
- [Travis] Whose bag is this?

2477
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:47,490
- Jesse's.

2478
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,116
- Who's Jesse?
- I love this thing.

2479
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:50,618
- Doesn't matter.
[objects clanking]

2480
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,078
- Does Jesse have a shirt?

2481
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:53,287
- He might.

2482
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:58,250
- He does have a shirt.

2483
01:28:58,292 --> 01:28:59,168
- Hey.

2484
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:00,962
- It's not my favorite style.

2485
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,338
A little loud but...

2486
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:12,765
He also has a ton
of money in here.

2487
01:29:14,058 --> 01:29:16,894
- Actually, no, that's my money.

2488
01:29:16,936 --> 01:29:18,646
- You won this?

2489
01:29:18,688 --> 01:29:19,772
- Yeah.

2490
01:29:19,814 --> 01:29:21,232
Told you I'm good.
- Yeah.

2491
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:24,402
So then, this is yours too?

2492
01:29:24,443 --> 01:29:25,194
- Mm-hm.

2493
01:29:25,236 --> 01:29:26,237

Ow.

- Ooh.

2500
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:44,672
You look better already.

2501
01:29:44,714 --> 01:29:45,965
Vegas for another night?

2502
01:29:46,966 --> 01:29:48,175
- That would be a disaster.

2503
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:49,260
Let's do it.
