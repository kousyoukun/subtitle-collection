What are you doing?

148
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,529
听着 艾比
Listen, Abby,

149
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,406
需要支付学费
tuition payments need to be issued

150
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,575
通过银行账户或信用卡
through a bank account or a credit card.

151
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,410
要考虑问责制
There is accountability to be considered,

152
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,412
更不用说税收了
not to mention the taxes.

153
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,289
我正在办一个
I'm in the process of setting one up.

154
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,541
你父母不能帮帮你吗
Can't your parents help you out?

155
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,711
它是复杂的
It's complicated.

156
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,796
我妈妈 我已经很多年没联系了
My mom, I haven't spoken to in years,

157
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:29,259
我爸爸也不是最好的人
and my dad is not the best guy.

158
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,511
这学期我同意
I'll allow it for this semester,

159
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,472
但你得给自己开个银行账户
but sort yourself out a bank account

160
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,933
因为这种事不会再发生了
because this will not be happening again.

161
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:36,850
谢谢你
Thank you.

162
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,310
谢谢 谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

163
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,145
所以我今早跟会计谈过了
So I talked to the bursar this morning

164
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,438
最后她拿走了钱
and she ended up taking the cash.

165
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,191
我是说 至少我这学期有保险
I mean, at least I'm covered for the semester.

166
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,318
哦 如果钱用光了怎么办
Oh, what happens when the money runs out?

167
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,486
我不知道
I don't know.

168
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,321
我要么找份工作 要么拿奖学金
I'll find a job or I'll get a scholarship.

169
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,697
我会想办法的
I'll figure something out.

170
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,490
传入的
Incoming.

171
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,909
嘿 南瓜
Hey, pumpkin.

172
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,577
我给你倒了杯咖啡
I got you a coffee here.

173
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,495
谢谢你 哦
Thank you. - Aw.

174
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,955
这是给你的
That's for you.

175
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:58,705
谢谢
Thanks.

176
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,165
昨晚怎么样
How was last night?

177
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,083
你玩得开心吗
Did you have fun?

178
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,459
是啊 很难忘
Yeah, it was memorable.

179
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,961
那一个人到底是怎么回事
So what was the deal with the one guy,

180
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,837
那个浑身是纹身的人
the guy that was covered in tattoos?

181
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,630
哦 那是他的表弟
Oh, that's his cousin.

182
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,215
他是大二学生
He's a sophomore.

183
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,592
哦 那家伙上过大学
Oh, that guy goes to college?

184
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,510
嗯嗯
Mm-hm.

185
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,011
哇 真让人吃惊
Wow, that is surprising.

186
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,012
令人惊讶的是什么
What's surprising?

187
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,515
你去上大学
That you go to college.

188
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,517
为什么我不能上大学
Why can't I go to college?

189
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,351
不是我说的 兄弟 是她说的
I didn't say it, bro, she said it.

190
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,143
怎么啦
What?

191
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,061
不 我没那么说
No, I didn't say that.

192
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,354
对不起 我们见过面吗
Sorry, have we met?

193
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,605
你不记得了 崔维斯
Oh, you don't remember, Travis?

194
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:24,940
你 你毁了她的毛衣
You, you ruined her sweater.

195
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,525
我毁了很多毛衣
I ruin a lot of sweaters.

196
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,777
我很确定他们用了不好的双关语
I'm pretty sure they retired bad double entendres.

197
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,028
鸽子
Pigeon.

198
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,821
艾比
Abby.

199
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,614
我叫艾比
My name is Abby.

200
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,448
特拉维斯
Travis.

201
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,616
特拉维斯马多克斯
Travis Maddox.

202
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,494
这个动作真的有效吗
Does that move really work?

203
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,413
不 一次都没有
No, not a single time,

204
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,414
但它是真诚的
but it is sincere.

205
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,041
你不是我喜欢的类型
You're not my type.

206
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,626
每个人都喜欢我
I'm everybody's type.

207
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,545
看 我抓到你了
See, I got you.

208
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,462
我得到了你的微笑
I got a smile out of you.

209
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,506
不 不 那不是笑
No, no, that was not a smile.

210
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,508
那其实是一种居高临下的窃笑
That was actually a condescending chuckle.

211
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,342
是的
Yeah.

212
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,596
嘿 我要过去了 好吗
Hey, I'm gonna come over, all right?

213
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,557
再见 鸽子
See you later, pigeon.

214
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,600
艾比 我叫艾比
Abby, my name is Abby.

215
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,768
现在是鸽子了
Well, it's pigeon now.

216
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,228
你能相信那个家伙吗
Can you believe that guy?

217
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,897
这就是带给我们的
And that is what brings us

218
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,525
对博弈论的发现
to the discovery of game theory.

219
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:13,572
博弈论是20世纪50年代首创的一个术语
Now, game theory is a term that was pioneered in the 1950s

220
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,824
由数学家约翰·纳什提出
by mathematician John Nash.

221
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,785
游戏一词被定义为任何互动
The term game is defined as any interaction

222
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,537
每个人的收益在哪里
where each person's payoff

223
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,831
受到决策的影响 毫米
is affected by the decisions. - Mm.

224
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:26,752
哇
Wow.

225
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
这么热
So hot.

226
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,556
那是我的最爱
That one's my favorite.

227
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,268
现在关闭已经太晚了
It's too late to close it now.

228
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,938
有没有人告诉过你 这是不礼貌的
Has anyone ever told you that it's not very polite...

229
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,106
年轻的女士吗
Young lady?

230
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,151
你叫什么名字
What is your name?

231
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,444
艾比
Abby.

232
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,280
艾比女士 你能教我们一下吗
Ms. Abby, would you care to educate us

233
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,617
为什么纳什均衡与博弈论无关
as to why Nash's equilibrium is irrelevant to game theory?

234
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,160
无关紧要的
Irrelevant?

235
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,495
我不能
I can't.

236
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,288
好吧 那也许你应该多关注一下
Well, then perhaps you should focus a little more on...

237
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,041
但那是因为它是相关的
Well, but that's because it is relevant.

238
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,584
如果达到平衡
If equilibrium is achieved,

239
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,795
这意味着双方玩家都无法提高收益
that means that both players can't increase payoff

240
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,089
通过单方面改变决定
by changing decisions unilaterally.

241
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,715
它也可以被称为无悔
It can also be known as no regrets

242
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,509
从某种意义上说 一旦玩家做出决定
in the sense that once a player does make a decision,

243
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,553
考虑到后果 他们不会后悔
they'll have no regrets thinking about the consequences.

244
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,765
你有提前阅读吗
Have you been reading ahead?

245
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:22,599
一点
A bit.

246
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,727
就像我说的
As I was saying.

247
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,479
哇 鸽子 太辣了
Wow, pigeon, that was so hot.

248
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,438
你有脑子
You got brains.

249
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,482
你为什么在这里
Why are you here?

250
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,150
你为什么要给我一个模棱两可的信号
Why are you sending me a mixed signal?

251
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,777
我的信号并没有混淆
There's nothing mixed about my signals.

252
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,737
我刚发现你在ins上跟踪我
I just caught you Insta stalking me.

253
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,323
我没有在ins上跟踪
I was not Insta stalking.

254
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,784
听着 我可以帮你省下不少时间
Look, I'm going to save you a lot of wasted time.

255
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,369
你别再胡闹了 好吗
You can stop the antics, okay?

256
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,662
我不会和你上床的
I'm not sleeping with you.

257
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,540
我不是想和你上床 也不是想装你
I'm not trying to sleep with you or bag you.

258
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,833
我只是想请你吃饭
I'm just trying to take you to dinner.

259
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,042
包我
Bag me?

260
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,710
我是什么 杂货吗
What am I, groceries?

261
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,088
你在过去的四年里没看过报纸吗
Have you not read a newspaper in the last four years?

262
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,714
男人不再那样说话了
Men don't talk like that anymore.

263
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:55,757
哪个男人
Which men?

264
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,761
地球上进化的人类
The evolved men of planet Earth.

265
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,472
那些真正了解自己感受的人
The ones who are actually in touch with their feelings.

266
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,725
我不喜欢你
I don't like you.

267
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,729
别烦我
Leave me alone.

268
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,026
你不会就此罢休的 对吧
You're not going to let this go, aren't you?

269
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,570
我八点钟来接你
I'll pick you up at eight.

270
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,489
等等 你没有我的号码
But wait, you don't have my number.

271
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,908
兴趣发挥他的作用
Interest to play his part.

272
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,006
你为我盛装打扮
You dress up for me?

273
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,593
不 我没必要 因为这不是约会
No, I didn't have to because this is not a date.

274
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,595
我希望你饿了
Well, I hope you're hungry.

275
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,722
不 不 不
No, no, no.

276
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,183
我不需要这个 因为我不上那个东西
I don't need this because I'm not getting on that thing.

277
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,851
是的 你是
Yeah, you are.

278
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,228
你知道摩托车事故的统计数字吗
Do you know the statistics of motorcycles in accidents?

279
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,023
不 我才不穿那玩意
No, I'm not putting on that thing.

280
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,357
是的 你是
Yeah, you are.

281
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,821
我可以整晚都这样
I can do this all night.

282
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:03,825
很好
Fine.

283
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,995
谢谢 米格尔 是的
Thanks, Miguel. - Yep.

284
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,832
你真的不让我请你吃饭吗
You're really not gonna let me buy you dinner?

285
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,459
不 这不是约会
No, this isn't a date.

286
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,336
是的 我知道
Yes, I'm aware.

287
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,879
你已经说了两次了
You've said that twice now.

288
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:16,880
哦 你注意到了
Oh, you noticed.

289
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,465
嗯嗯
Mm-hm.

290
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,466
还有你的衣服
That and your outfit,

291
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,676
上面写着"我讨厌特拉维斯"
which screams "I detest Travis."

292
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,969
我不讨厌你
I don't detest you.

293
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,222
我只是不喜欢定局
I just don't like being a foregone conclusion

294
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:29,100
你床柱上无数无数的凹痕中的一个
for one of the many, many, many notches on your bedpost.

295
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,644
哦 你真聪明
Oh, you're smart.

296
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,229
我喜欢这样
I like that.

297
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,855
这可能是你不习惯在女人身上看到的
Something you're probably not used to in a woman.

298
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,358
哦 我三振出局了
Oh, I'm striking out.

299
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,776
我投降
I surrender.

300
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,110
我们至少可以做朋友
We can at least be friends.

301

朋友 但没有好处
Friends, but with no benefits.

302

我们没有睡在一起
We're not sleeping together.

303
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,534
我都不会去想什么好处
I won't even think about the benefits

304
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,952
除非你希望我这么做
unless you want me to.

305
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,871
不 这样我们才能继续做朋友
No, that can't happen so that we can stay friends.

306
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,040
朋友
Friends.

307
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,708
朋友
Friends.

308

我来这里好几年了
I've been coming to this place for years.

309
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,881
我家离那儿只有三英里
My family home is only three miles that way.

310
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,216
哦
Aw.

311
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,552
你就不能离你妈妈远一点吗
You couldn't move farther away from your mommy?

312
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,594
不 不是这样的
No, that's not it.

313
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,348
她的烤奶酪就这么好吃
Her grilled cheese was just that good?

314
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,766
好吧 她死了
Well, she's dead.

315
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:10,934
闭嘴
Shut up.

316
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,397
你是认真的吗
Are you serious?

317
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,151
我真是个混蛋 我很抱歉
I'm such an asshole, I'm so sorry.

318
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,820
我感觉糟透了 -没事的 没事的
I feel horrible. - It's okay, it's okay.

319
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,280
那时我只有三岁
I was only three.

320
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,781
好吧 我没那么抱歉
Okay, I'm not that sorry.

321
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:25,740
别碰我
Get your hand off me.

322
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,702
你爸爸怎么样了
How's your dad?

323
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,580
他还活着 所以你可以取笑他
He's still alive, so you can make fun of him.

324
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,623
他是个好人
He's a good man.

325
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,874
他一个人养大了五个儿子
He raised five boys all on his own.

326
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,459
马多克斯五兄弟
Five Maddox brothers?

327
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,711
是的
Yeah.

托马斯 泰勒 泰勒 特伦特和特拉维斯
Thomas, Taylor, Tyler, Trent, and Travis.

329
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,632
如果你想擅长打架
If you wanna get good at fighting,

330
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,925
四个哥哥每天都打你的屁股
having four older brothers beat your ass daily

331
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,093
是一个很好的开始
is a good place to start.

332
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,052
但为什么要这么做呢
But why do it?

333
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,847
上大学可不便宜
College ain't cheap.

334
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,348
打架是赚钱的好方法
Fighting is a good way to make money.

335
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,892
似乎没有必要冒险
Just seems unnecessarily risky.

336
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,019
为什么
Why?

337
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,520
你担心我
You worried about me?

338
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,314
一点也不
Not even in the slightest.

339
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,358
你的故事是什么
What's your story?

340
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,612
只是一个普通小镇里的普通女孩
Just your average girl from your ordinary town.

341

我不可能一夜之间把所有的东西都送出去
Well, I can't give away all the goods in one night.

345
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,537
大多数人都喜欢这么做
Most do.

346
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,830
我其实很喜欢
I actually enjoy it.

347
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,791
你真的要走吗
Are you seriously leaving?

348
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,335
晚餐结束
Dinner's over.

你知道这不是一个很有吸引力的习语

426
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,312
一旦你停下来好好想想
once you stop and think about it.

427
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,022
因为在你的性别歧视世界里

女人实际上不排便

这词对你这种人来说再合适不过了

你朋友让我把这个给你
Your friend gave this to me to give to you.

432

怎么啦
What?

00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,287
就是刚刚跟你上床的那个女人
The woman that you just had sex with

434
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,540
给了你她的电话号码 你就这么扔掉了
gives you her number and you just throw it away?

435
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,208
那不是她留下的号码
That's not her leaving her number.

436
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,043
这是她在标记自己的领地
That's her marking her territory.

437
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,962
那也许你不该和她上床
Well, then maybe you shouldn't have sex with her.

438
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,005
我不记得答应过她什么
I don't remember promising her a thing.

439
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,423
哇
Wow.

440
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,300
你体现了你们性别的所有错误
You embody everything that is wrong with your gender.

441
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,301
她是个成年人了
She's an adult.

442
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,094
我是个成年人了
I'm an adult.

443
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,804
这是双方自愿的
It was consensual.

444
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,347
看看这个
Look at this.

445
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,765
同意的日期
Consent date.

446
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,475
现在再小心也不为过
Can never be too careful nowadays.

447
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,477
你和多少女人签了合同
How many women do you have contracts with?

448
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,980
不知道 我重质量轻数量
No idea, I'm a quality guy over quantity.

449
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,107
我要吐了
I'm gonna throw up.

450
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,900
我的卧室在走廊尽头
Well, my bedroom is down the hall

451
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,027
当你想睡觉的时候 床是你的
and the bed is all yours for when you wanna crash.

452
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,279
我才不要睡你的床
I'm not gonna sleep in your bed.

453
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,196
为什么
Why?

454
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,156
只有我睡在我的床上
No one but me sleeps in my bed.

455
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,241
我的床是圣地
My bed is sacred ground.

456
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,243
那我为什么还能睡你的床
Well, then why would I be allowed in your bed?

457
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,328
你今晚打算和我做爱吗
Are you planning on having sex with me tonight?

458
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,162
不
No.

459
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,373
那就这么定了
Then it's settled.

460
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,881
哇 别客气
Wow, make yourself at home.

461
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,550
抱歉 我上午10点有要紧事 死记硬背的生物考试
Sorry, I just have a big 10 a.m. Bio test to cram for,

462
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,093
但我可以搬回厨房
but I can move back to the kitchen.

463
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,261
不 你很好 待在原地
No, you're fine, stay where you're at.

464
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,637
别傻了
Don't be silly.

465
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,014
谢谢你
Thank you.

466
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,265
要我给你泡点茶什么的吗
Do you want me to make you some tea or something?

467
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,517
没有 但是我的荧光笔坏了
No, but, uh, my highlighter just died.

468
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,810
我能借一个吗
Can I borrow one?

469
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,228
对了 看看最上面的抽屉
Oh, yeah, check the top drawer.

470
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,398
等一下 嗯
Wait, um,

471
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,232
不
no.

472
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,068
哇
Wow.

473
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,069
这是很多
That's a lot.

474
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,197
实行安全性行为是犯罪吗
Is practicing safe sex a crime?

475
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,117
这是什么
What's this?

476
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,535
我告诉你 这不是荧光笔
It's not a highlighter, I'll tell you that.

477
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,541
嗯
Um.

478
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,417
是溜溜球
It's a yo-yo?

479
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,169
不 绝对不是
No, definitely not.

480
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,086
这是尴尬的
It's awkward.

481
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,713
我要去洗澡了
I'm gonna go shower.

482
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:28,037
你在干什么
What are you doing?

483
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,379
坏猫
Bad kitty.

484
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,257
鼠标
Mouse.

485
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,341
鼠标
Mouse.

486
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,180
艾比
Abby.

487
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,099
鸽子 -真的很可爱
Pigeon. - Really cute.

488
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:48,933
多少钱
How much?

489
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,185
嗯
Um.

490
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,188
不是你想的那样
It's not what do you think it is.

491
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,191
艾比 你
Abby, you're...

492
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,235
等等 你在干什么
Wait, what are you doing?

493
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,242
艾比
Abby!

494
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,243
艾比
Abby!

495
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,161
搞什么鬼
What the heck?

496
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,162
你怎么了
What is wrong with you?

497
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:09,912
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

498
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,164
你触动了我
You touched me.

499
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,874
这句话出自一个愤怒的男人之口
Oh, says the man with the raging hard-on.

500
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,083
你应该被关起来
You should be locked up.

501
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,626
你就是那个摸小鸡鸡的人
You're the sleepy cock toucher.

502
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,295
我没有把你的手放在那里
I didn't put your hand there.

503
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,213
如果你费心去读一本生物教科书
And if you bothered to read a biology textbook,

504
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,590
你会发现
you'd find out

505
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,924
这被称为副交感神经反应
that it's called parasympathetic nerve response

506
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:22,884
如果你知道什么 你就会知道
and you'd know that if you knew anything

507
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,427
关于生物学或男人
about biology or men.

508
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,762
哦 该死 生物
Oh, shit, Bio!

511
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:28,639

00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,516
你穿的是什么
What are you wearing?

513
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,476
我们在玩 -我们是
We were playing. - We were

515
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,312
让我载你一程
Let me give you a ride.

516
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,314
不 这只是个疯人院
No, this is just a madhouse.

517
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,733
一个护士吗
A nurse?

518
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,567
是的 不 我
Yeah, no, I...

519
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,611
对不起 打扰一下
Sorry, excuse me.

520
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,822
对不起
Sorry.

521
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:45,823
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

522
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,628
我滑倒了
I slipped.

523
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,338
但我的生物考试还是考得很好
But I still aced my Bio test.

524
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,840
我很高兴你没引人注意
Well, I'm glad you're not drawing attention

525
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:03,633
对自己
to yourself.

526
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,343
搞笑
Hilarious.

527
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,719
好了 我得去上课了
Okay, I have to run to class,

528
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,137
但我想知道昨晚发生了什么
but I want a full play-by-play of what happened last night.

529
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,222
昨晚什么事也没发生
Nothing happened last night.

530
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,139
是吗 -我不喜欢他
Yeah? - I do not like him.

531
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:10,515
是的
Yeah,

532
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,308
所以你才要跟他说声早安
and that's why you're giving him a good morning handy.

533
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,688
米克还在烦你吗
Is Mick still bothering you?

534
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,981
是的
Yeah.

535
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,733
你得把他赶出你的生活
You got to cut him out of your life.

536
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:21,943
他从我的生活中消失了
He is out of my life.

537
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:22,944
他并没有从你的生活中消失
He is not out of your life

538
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,487

00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,049
没关系
That's okay.

549
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,469
我记得他们说我有20%的机会过正常的性生活
I think they said I had a 20% chance of a normal sex life.

550
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,556

Are you messing with me?

551
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,473

580
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,746
哇 fancy -fancy
Wow, fancy-fancy.

581
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,580
是的
Yeah.

582
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:00,499
哇
Wow.

583
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,502
你随叫随到吗
Are you on call?

584
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,422
不 我只是收到今晚一场演出的通知
No, I-I just got a heads-up about a show tonight.

585
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,341
哦 哦 我可以自己搭车回家
Oh, oh, I can get my own ride home.

586
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,343
不不不 我们应该一起去
No, no, no, we-we should both go.

587
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,929
除非你有工作或者不想见到我
Unless you've got work or sick of seeing me.

588
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,013
不
No.

589
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,556
不 我很想去
No, I would love to go.

590
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,266
这会很有趣的
This is-this is gonna be fun.

591
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,604
知道吗 我一直想见提图斯·安多尼克斯
You know, I've always wanted to see Titus Andronicus.

592
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:25,024
它被认为是莎士比亚最暴力的戏剧
It's considered to be Shakespeare's most violent play.

593
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,317
你不介意暴力吗
You don't mind violence?

594
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,444
不 我从小就是个假小子
No, I was something of a tomboy growing up.

595
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,364
那你就有机会了
Well, then you're in for a treat.

596
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,740
哦 我想开始了
Ooh, I guess it's starting.

597
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,743
他是州冠军
...he's a state champ.

598
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,245
他会挺身而出的
He's gonna come out swinging.

599
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,746
他不会浪费任何时间的
He's not gonna be wasting any sort of time.

600
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,122
好吧 你在干什么
Okay, what are you doing?

601
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,959
艾比今天还没回我短信
Abby hasn't texted me back today.

602
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,876
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

603
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,336
你能忘了艾比吗
Would you forget about Abby?

604
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,754
你见过这个人吗
Have you, have you seen this guy?

605
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:50,633
他穿着白色长袍 系着一条很大的腰带
He's got a white robe and a belt that's huge, okay?

606
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,510
我是说 你表现得像个接吻亭
I mean, you're acting like the kissing booth over here.

607
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,220
你需要集中注意力
You need to focus.

608
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,681
我很专注
I am focused.

609
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,519
这才是我们需要的特拉维斯
That's the Travis we need.

610
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,145
来吧
Come on.

611
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,398
我只是不知道她为什么不回我短信
I just don't know why she hasn't texted me back.

612
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,399
我要出去看看
I'm gonna go outside and see

613
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,775
如果我的手机信号好点
if I can get better cell reception.

614
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,278
我们死了
We're dead.

615
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,657
哦 哇 现代的诠释
Oh, wow, modern interpretation.

616
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:15,700
我喜欢莎士比亚
I love Shakespeare.

617
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:21,914
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

618
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,542
接下来是主要节目:
Next up, we have the main event:

619
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,586
弗雷迪·海弗林对阵特拉维斯·"疯狗"·马多克斯
Freddy Heflin versus Travis "Mad Dog" Maddox!

620
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,508
这会很棒的
This is gonna be great.

621
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,760
特拉维斯是个十足的动物
Travis is a real animal.

622
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,682
你还好吗
Are you okay?

623
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:42,810
没事 没事 只是这里有点热
Yeah, yeah, it's just a little hot in here.

624
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,313
我去找个洗手间
I'm gonna go find a bathroom.

625
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,356
怎么回事 艾比
What the fuck, Abby?

626
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,318
你不回我一条短信
You don't respond to any of my texts,

627
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,445
现在你穿成这样来了
and now you're here dressed like that

628
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,362
你的咪咪露在外面
with your titties hanging out.

629
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,031
他们没有出去玩
They are not hanging out.

630
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,033
这是有品位的乳沟
This is a tasteful amount of cleavage.

631
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:57,950
是吗
Yeah?

632
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:58,868
他们让我分心了
Well, they're distracting me.

633
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,077
哦 对不起 我忘了
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

634
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,496
都是为了你 你这个自大狂
It's all about you, you egomaniac.

635
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,956
我必须打败你
I must break you.

636
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:05,666
大胆去做吧
Go for it.

637
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,794
这就是你的对手
That's who you're fighting?

638
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:09,712
是的
Yes.

639
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,339
那家伙会杀了你的
That guy could kill you.

640
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,133
这是你承认你喜欢我的奇怪方式吗
Is this your weird little way of admitting you like me?

641
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,551
我不喜欢你
I don't like you.

642
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,635
但我确实担心你
But I do worry about you.

643
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,845
我担心地球
I worry about the planet.

644
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,555
这是两种完全不同的东西
They're two very different things.

645
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,058
好吧 如果这样能让你放心
Okay, well, if it puts your mind at ease,

646
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,476
他甚至不会打我
he's not even gonna hit me.

647
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,518
搞笑
Hilarious.

648
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,353
你在怀疑我吗
Are you doubting me?

649
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,187
是的
Yeah.

650
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,356
想让它有趣点吗
Care to make it interesting?

651
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,648
让它变得有趣
Make it interesting?

652
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,566
比如打赌
Like a bet?

653
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,359
是的
Yeah.

654
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,485
我不敢打赌
I don't bet.

655
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,487
快点 崔维斯 他们需要你
Come on, Travis, they need you.

656
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,030
好的 等一下
Yeah, just a minute.

657
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,615
这是如何
How's this?

658
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,784
如果他敢碰我一下
If he manages to lay a hand on me,

659
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,911
我一个星期不做爱
I'll go without sex for a week.

660
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,412
哦
Ooh.

661
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,246
一个月
A month.

662
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:45,998
三个月
Three months.

663
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,500
三个月吗
Three months?

664
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,710
这对你这样的人来说是不可能的
That's impossible for someone like you.

665
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:54,048
好吧 如果我赢了 你得跟我住一个月
Okay, and if I win, you have to stay with me for a month.

666
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,174
你在
You're on.

667
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,550
但如果你想清楚
But get it through your head,

668
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,054
我永远不会和你做爱
I am never having sex with you.

669
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,600
我不想和你做爱 小猪猪
I don't wanna have sex with you, pidge.

670
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,352
我想在你身边
I wanna be around you.

671
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,187
你对我有好处
You're good for me.

672
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,028
你很帅
You are handsome.

673
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,821
你死了
You're dead.

674
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,452
哈
Hah.

675
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,621
你帅得要命
You are handsome as hell.

676
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:26,914
难怪你是冠军
No wonder you're the champ.

677
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:28,958
我心中的冠军
Champ of my heart.

678
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,711
来吧 打他
Come on, hit him!

679
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,130
你去过断背山吗
You ever hiked Brokeback Mountain?

680
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,590
你想要吗
Do you wanna?

681
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,092
我会很温柔的 你知道的
I'll be gentle, you know.

682
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,345
你要怎么杀了我 大男孩
How are you gonna kill me, big boy?

683
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,182
头晕了
Giddy up.

684
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,608
杀了你
...kill you!

685
00:28:58,654 --> 00:28:59,655
你在干什么
What are you doing?

686
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:00,739
闭嘴
Shut up.

687
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,159
揍他
Hit him!

688
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:06,829
只有一次
Just once!

689
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,169
哦哦 宝贝摔倒了
Oh-oh, baby fell down.

690
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,171
回到你的婴儿床里去 小宝贝
Get back in your crib, little baby.

691
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,094
Oh -ho -ho
Oh-ho-ho.

692
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,513
现在 这个一定很疼
Now, that one had to hurt.

693
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,974
所以我把左上角放袜子的抽屉留给你
So I'm saving the upper left sock drawer for you.

694
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,392
跟我打吧 贱人
Fight me, bitch.

695
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,437
然后把它们盖起来
And cover those up.

696
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,063
你婊子
You bitch.

697
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,398
原谅我
Excuse me.

698
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,365
就一次 打他
Just once, hit him!

699
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:47,953
我们开始吧
Here we go!

700
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,558
女士们先生们 有请特拉维斯·马多克斯
Ladies and gentlemen, Travis Maddox!

701
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,188
收拾你的行李 鸽子
Pack your bags, pigeon.

702
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,565
你和我一起回家
You're coming home with me.

703
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:20,778
这是怎么发生的
How did this happen?

704
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,828
嘿 我给你拿了杯水
Hey, I got you a water.

705
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,666
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

706
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,338
我只是需要消化一下
I just need to process this.

707
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,714
我知道
I know.

708
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,716
我们出去吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐
We go out for a great dinner.

709
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,260
相处得很好
Get on really well.

710
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,011
我带你去看表演
I take you to a show.

711
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,847
我离开你五分钟
I leave you for five minutes.

712
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,391
在那段时间里
And during that time,

713
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:54,103
你决定搬去和特拉维斯·马多克斯住了
you've decided to move in with Travis Maddox.

714
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,604
我打赌输了
I lost a bet.

715
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:56,689
正确的
Right.

716
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,690
我们只是朋友
We're just friends.

717
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,857
我是说 我们连朋友都算不上
I mean, we're not even friends.

718
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,192
我们什么都没有
We're nothing.

719
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,319
今晚和你在一起很开心
I had a really nice time with you tonight

720
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,821
我很乐意再来一次
and I would love to do it again.

721
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,785
你觉得我能得到一个晚安吻吗
Do you think I can, I can get a good-night kiss?

722
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,292
哦 上帝
Oh, God!

723
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,293
不

你尝过它的美味吗

肯塔基州的炸鸡

878
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,574
白痴 不是所有的鸡都是肯塔基产的
Moron, not every chicken is from Kentucky.

879
00:35:58,615 --> 00:35:59,908
是的 是的
Yeah, it is.

880
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,826
这就是为什么他们叫它肯德基
That's why they call it Kentucky Fried Chicken.

881
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:01,785

I'm just saying if you wanna play, let's play.

917
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,217

918
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,385
哦 是的
Oh, yeah.

919
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,095
我能拿点东西
I-I can carry some stuff.

920
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,273
好吧这个游戏叫德州扑克艾比
All right, the name of the game is Texas hold 'em, Abby,

921
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,191
你在吗

924
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,071

Yeah.

925
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,239
我要啤酒 那里有薯片
Beer for me and there's chips up there

926
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,908

Let's go.

931
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:28,497
我来拿芯片
Let me get the chip.

932
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,790
什么也没得到
Got nothing.

933
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:31,583
吃屎
Eat shit.

934
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,254
直上河 他又来了 伙计们
Straight on the river and he does it again, boys.

935
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,674
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

936
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,008
艾比 你已经看了很久了
Abby, you've been watching a while.

937
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,051
你想加入吗
You wanna join?

938
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,260
哦 我没事
Oh, I'm okay.

939
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,261
别担心
Don't worry.

940
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,138
我们对这里的女士们放轻松点
We take it easy on the ladies over here.

941
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:47,391
如果你喜欢 我们可以玩钓鱼游戏
We can play Go Fish if you like.

942
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,725
其实我不觉得
You know, I actually don't think

943
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,060
问题是你们要对我宽容一点
it's a question of you guys going easy on me.

944
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,436
其实我觉得这是我的问题
I actually think it's a question of me

945
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,230
对你们好点
going easy on you guys.

946
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,064

Okay.

950
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,486
好吧
Okay.

951
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,155
艾比 你最好别这么做
Abby, you might not wanna do that.

952
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,740
泰勒可能看起来像个白痴
Taylor may look like an idiot,

953
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,993
但他碰巧是镇上最好的扑克玩家之一
but he happens to be one of the best poker players in town.

954
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,245
哦 在城里
Oh, in town.

955
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,204
在县里
In the county.

956
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,707
哦 哇 县里
Oh, wow, the county.

957
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,041
他甚至在电视上表演过
He's even played on TV.

958
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,419
哦 在电视上
Oh, on TV.

959
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,379
真了不起 我不知道
That's pretty impressive, I don't know.

960
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:24,845
我们走吧
Let's go.

961
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:25,679
好吧
Okay.

962
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,314
折叠 初学者的运气
Fold, beginner's luck.

963
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,316
这不是初学者的运气
This is no beginner's luck.

964
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,235
我可没说过我是初学者
Well, I never said I was a beginner.

965
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:42,571
调用
Call.

966
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:47,284

973
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,336
座无虚席啊
That's a full house.

974
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,254
是的 它是
Yes, it is.

975
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,298
你只是被骗了 兄弟
You just got hustled, bro.

976
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,384
不 只有我留着你的钱才算卖命
Well, no, it's only hustling if I keep your money.

977
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,177
哦
Oh.

978
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,428
哦 不 不 不
Oh, no, no, no.

979
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,389
亲爱的 那笔钱是你的
Sweetheart, that money's yours.

980
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,391
你光明正大地赢了
You won it fair and square.

981
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,434
大便
Shit.

982
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,811
你在哪里学的
Where did you learn to play?

983
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,229
首页
Home.

984
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,314
回家吗
Home?

985
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,357
在哪里
Where was that?

986
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,359
拉斯维加斯
Vegas.

987
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,403
我爸爸教我的
My dad taught me.

988
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,824
曾经是一个叫艾伯纳西的高赌注扑克玩家
Used to be a high-stakes poker player named Abernathy.

989
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,953
我记得在维加斯听过他的故事
I remember hearing stories about him in Vegas.

990
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:32,871
发生了什么事
What happened?

991
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,290
他有个女儿
Uh, he had this daughter.

992
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,625
到哪儿都跟着他
Went with him everywhere.

993
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:39,169
我觉得他妈妈抛弃了他
I think the mom walked out on him

994
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,796
所以他是独自抚养她长大的
so he was raising her on his own.

995
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,381
你的眼睛 即使你在走路
...your eyes even when you're shuffling.

996
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,382
当时她还太小 不能合法地玩
While she was way too young to play legally

997
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:48,345
但是 她可是个扑克天才
but man, she was a poker prodigy.

998
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,430
她愈演愈烈 他却愈演愈烈
As she got better, he got worse.

999
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:54,684
所以她只能保释他 即使他还是个孩子
So she was left bailing him out, even as a kid.

1000
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,603
看着你对手的眼睛
Look your opponent in the eyes.

1001
00:39:58,355 --> 00:39:59,731
我记得这个
I remember this.

1002
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,566
他们叫她幸运符
They called her Lucky Charms.

1003
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,068
幸运的13
Lucky 13.

1004
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,612
艾比 你一定听说过她吧
Abby, you must have heard of her, right?

1005
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,322
她一定和你差不多大
She must be about your age.

1006
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:14,788
毕竟 文章里出现的是你 不是吗
After all, this is you in the article, isn't it?

1007
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,712
你是幸运13
You're Lucky 13?

1008
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,174
我们被幸运13骗了吗
We just got hustled by Lucky 13?

1009
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,259
不可能
No fucking way.

1010
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,844
各位 我很抱歉
Guys, I'm sorry.

1011
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,054
我发誓 我不是想骗你们什么的 我
I wasn't trying to hustle you guys or anything, I swear. I'm...

1012
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,765
幸运13人在这房子里

这是一个完全正常的姿势
This is a totally normal position

1158
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,347

1159

她只是有点紧张
She's just nervous,

1165
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,943
但我可以帮你克服紧张
but I can help you through your nervousness.

1166
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,403
别这么说她
Don't read her like this.

1167
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,197
太老套了
It's too corny.

1168
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,532
你没有毒 你是个很酷的人
You're not toxic, you're a cool guy.

1169
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,409
你真的很酷很强壮

1173
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:54,562
特拉维斯

1177
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,550
你到底去哪了
Where the hell have you been?

1178
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:24,842
出去了
Out.

1179
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,344
天啊 你浑身酒气
Jesus, you reek of alcohol.

1180
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:27,804
我养了一只猫
I got a cat.

1181
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,765
我给它起名叫虎斑猫 它是只流浪狗
I named him Tabby, he's a stray.

1182
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,727
我会为他杀人 他也会为我杀人
And I would kill for him, and he would kill for me,

1183
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,771
不像我在这里认识的一些人
unlike some people I know in this house.

1184
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,192
那是邻居的猫 朗普提泽
That's the neighbor's cat, Rumpleteazer.

1185
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,735
不 不是 这是塔比
No it isn't this is Tabby?

1186
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,405
我是说 兄弟 这里有个项圈
I mean, brah, it's got a collar right there.

1187
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:49,075
大便
Shit.

1188
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:49,909
好
Well.

1189
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:51,869
嘿 芽
Hey, bud.

1190
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,123
你还在这里干什么
The hell are you still doing here?

1191
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,168
我整晚都在担心你
I was up all night worried about you.

1192
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,170
这是丰富的
That's rich.

1193
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,881
你不应该担心你男朋友什么的吗
Shouldn't you be worried about your boyfriend or something?

1194
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,425
我的男朋友吗
My boyfriend?

1195
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,552
是的 米克
Yeah, Mick.

1196
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:10,763
没错 我看到你电脑上的短信了
That's right, I saw the text on your computer.

1197
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,056
非常好 非常好
Very nice, very nice.

1198
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,017
他给你发短信 你却待在这里
Staying here while he's texting you

1199
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,352
"我爱你 我想你"
"I love you, I miss you."

1200
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,854
真是个笑话
What a joke.

1201
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,481
特拉维斯 米克是我爸爸
Travis, Mick is my dad.

1202
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,193
你多久看一次我的短信
And how often are you going through my text messages?

1203
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:29,240
"我能来看你吗"
"Can I come see you?" would make sense.

1204
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,034
所以是你爸爸干的
So it was your dad?

1205
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:34,787
不可能
No way.

1206
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,080
我太糟糕了
That's terrible of me.

1207
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,791
好吧 我误解了
Well, I misinterpreted that.

1208
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:40,835
这是个好消息
That's great news.

1209
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,421
这是好消息吗
Is it great news?

1210
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:45,131
崔维斯 你侵犯了我的隐私
Travis, you invaded my privacy

1211
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,884
然后你就转身离开了我
and then you turned around and ghosted me.

1212
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:48,801
再见
Goodbye.

1213
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:49,719
艾比 等等 等等
Abby, wait, wait.

1214
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,512
对不起 对不起 对不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1215
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,848
我很嫉妒 我搞砸了
I-I was jealous, I messed up.

1216
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,892
不 特拉维斯 你没有搞砸
No, Travis, you didn't mess up.

1217
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,770
你只是向我展示了真实的你
If anything, you just showed me who you really are.

1218
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,606
艾比 等等 我们能谈谈吗
Abby, wait, can we talk?

1219
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:02,607
再见
Bye.

1220
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:04,233
嘿
Hey.

1221
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,468
有人告诉过你吗
Did anyone ever tell you

1222
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,096
你是一个非常可爱的睡眠者

嗨 帕克

嗨
Hi.

1225
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,184
特拉维斯在附近吗
Is Travis nearby?

1226
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:39,310
我需要担心吗
Do I need to be worried?

1227
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:40,895
嗯 不
Ugh, no.

1228
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,605
好久不见了
It's been a while.

1229
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,399
你过得怎么样
How-how have you been?

1230
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,316

1235
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,038
所以我和医生们很熟
So I got to know the doctors pretty well,

1236
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,707
意识到这就是我想做的
and realized that's what I wanted to do

1237
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,333
用我的余生
with the rest of my life.

1238

你长大后想做什么

我还在想办法

特拉维斯记在脑子里了
Travis got it in his head

1281

00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:04,505
因为你给我办了个惊喜生日派对
Because you throw me this really big surprise birthday party

1442
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:07,466
在我一个人都不认识的地方过生日
for my birthday where I don't know anybody.

1443
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,009
你已经说过了
You said that already.

1444
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,386
别再告诉我该怎么做了
Stop telling me what to do!

1445
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,054
好吧 好吧
Okay, okay.

1446
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,266
首先 我确实向你道歉了
First off, I did apologize to you

1447
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,226
我也想跟你谈谈
and I tried to have a conversation with you too.

1448
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:19,019
但你却跑去图书馆了
But you ran off to the fucking library

1449
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,063
后来又带着帕克出现了
only to show up later with Parker

1450
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,274
然后继续把事情搞得一团糟
and then proceed to get beyond fucked up.

1451
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,152
所以 小猪猪 你得离我远点
So, pidge, you're gonna have to walk away from me

1452
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,862
因为我不能离开你
because I can't walk away from you.

1453
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,458
美丽
Beautiful.

1454
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,710
我什么时候吃过面条
When did I have noodles?

1455
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:49,175
我想我受够了
I think I'm done.

1456
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,512
好吧
Okay.

1457
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:54,305
哦 对不起
Oh, sorry.

1458
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,931
哦 你没事的
Oh, you're all right.

1459
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,225
好吧 我真的希望你做完了
Well, I sure hope you're done.

1460
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:00,394
我不确定你里面还有什么要吐的
I'm not sure if you have anything left in there to throw up.

1461
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:05,649
嘿 你想亲热吗
Hey, you wanna make out?

1462
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,569
不完全是
Not really, no.

1463
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:10,988
我不喜欢
I don't.

1464
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,201
你知道这最好的是什么吗 鸽子
You know what the best part about this is, pigeon?

1465
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,452
嗯
Hm.

1466
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,078
你不会记得这一切的
You're not gonna remember any of this.

1467
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,913
我不是吗
I'm not?

1468
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,497
不
No.

1469
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:24,418
所以当我告诉你我疯狂地爱着你
So when I tell you that I'm madly in love with you.

1470
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:26,378
我不会记得的
I won't remember.

1471
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:28,839
但我是认真的
But I really mean it.

1472
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:30,591
嗯
Hm.

1473
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,471
你想去国际煎饼屋吗
Do you wanna go to International House of Pancakes

1474
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,555
还有煎饼

1475
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,307

I'm gonna get you up. - Do you wanna go?

1479
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:43,354
我要放你鸽子 -我想去吃煎饼
I'm gonna stand you up. - Oh, I wanna go to pancakes.

1480
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,688
好吧 我要煎饼
Okay, I want pancakes.

1481

我给你买了件干净的衬衫

1484
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:54,156
我是个怪物
I'm a monster.

1485
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:55,824
好吧 我来帮你

1488
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,828

转身
Turn around.

1490
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,707
我看上去还是很体面的
I'm decent.

1491
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:04,750
只是开玩笑
Just kidding.

1492
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,585
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

Okay, it's on.

1498
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:13,384
我的天啊

1499
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:14,468
哦 我不能相信
Oh, I can't trust.

1500

但你应该把衣服穿上

1504
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,392
今晚我是个小恶作剧者

1520
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:02,641

1534

我强行灌了一升水

1535
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,511
和两片布洛芬一起咽下喉咙
down your throat along with two ibuprofens

1536
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,472
在你睡觉之前

1537
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:43,349
怎么啦
What?

1538
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,809

我们就像个灾难
We're like a disaster.

1542

你知道的
You know,

也是我们作为室友在一起的最后一晚

我的小腿有点疼
My calf's kind of hurting.

1568
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,610

01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,285
这可能听起来很奇怪
Uh, this might sound weird,

1609
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,370
但我需要你跟我一起去

1610
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,915
是啊 不 那是不可能的
Yeah, no, that's not going to happen.

1611

如果我客气地问呢
What if I asked nicely?

1612

他怎么样了
What about him?

1617
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:36,391
他下错了赌注 还欠我老板人情
He's placing bad bets and owes my boss.

1618
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,227
如果你不跟我来 他们会打断他的腿
They're gonna break his legs if you don't come with me.

1619

现在帮我找找线索什么的

Second of all, there's a lot about Abby that you don't know.

她要去拉斯维加斯了
She's headed to Vegas.

1632
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:46,503
拉斯维加斯吗
Vegas?

1633
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:47,921

你在开玩笑吗 爸爸

这些都是我做的 我发誓

1658
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:32,424
阿比盖尔 匿名大学生
Oh, Abigail, anonymous college student.

1659
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:36,553
看在你父亲的份上
Well, uh, for your father's sake,

1660
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:40,390
我希望时间不会太长 因为他欠我十万
I hope it's a short time because he owes me 100 grand

你爸连钱都不肯借给他

1664
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:46,730
你知道他有问题

不像我父亲 愿他安息
Unlike my father, may he rest in peace,

1666
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,818
我不是在开日托所 我是在做生意
I'm not running a daycare, I'm running a business.

1667

你以为你在跟谁说话

我是未成年

我们一定有别的办法处理这件事
There has to be another way that we can handle this.

1677
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,091
就是这样 但你不会喜欢的
There it is, but you're not gonna like it.

1678

你确定要留在这里吗
Are you sure you wanna stay here?

1692
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,444
贝拉吉奥有更大的鲸鱼

我想低调点
I'm trying to stay under the radar.

1695
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:20,740
还有什么事吗 陛下
Anything else, Your Majesty?

开始往我的饮料里加水
to start watering down my drinks

1698
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:26,079
去外面等我叫你

1699
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:27,247
你说对了

帮你自己个忙 去一楼吧
Do yourself a favor and go to the main floor

1708
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:52,147
然后挑一个闪亮的老虎机

1709

我不能回主楼了

who hates me because Lyle finger-banged me on Halloween,

1713
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,327
我要为自己辩护 我以为他们是分开的
which in my defense I thought that they were separated.

1714
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:06,620
我的振动棒呢

1717
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,175
你为什么不说话
What's up with the silent treatment?

1718
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:34,189
克里夫 我喜欢你的老虎衬衫

你能安静点吗
Can you be quiet?

1723
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:40,737
我像老鼠一样安静
