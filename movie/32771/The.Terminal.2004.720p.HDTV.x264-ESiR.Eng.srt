United Airlines announcing

Customer service representative,

All visitors to the US should
line up at booths one through 15.

Please have your I-94 forms filled out.

00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,760
What is the purpose of your visit?
Business or pleasure?

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,280
Just visiting. Shopping?

8
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,280
Au plaisir.

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
- Pleasure.
- Business.

10
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,160
How long will you be staying?

11
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,200
Could I see your return ticket?

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,680
- What's the purpose of your visit?
- Business or pleasure?

13
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,600
Enjoy your stay. Next.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,240
Please have your passports,
immigration forms, I-94,

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,880
and customs declarations
ready to hand to the inspector.

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,640
- Stand by. He's fishing.
- Copy that.

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,520
See this bunch
of Mickey Mouse sweatshirts?

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,360
That's the tour from China,
connecting to Orlando.

19
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,040
When was the last time
you saw Chinese tourists

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,720
on their way to Disney World
without any cameras?

21
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,600
Possible forged documents
on 10 and 11.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,360
Sir. Sir. Passport.

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,840
Thank you.

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,160
Welcome, Mr. Navorski.

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,120
Purpose of your visit?

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,040
Business or pleasure?

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,720
Sir, I have an IBIS hit on six.

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,160
No!

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,520
Mr. Navorski, please follow me.

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,240
...flight number 746 from Montreal

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,880
must proceed to US Immigration
before claiming their luggage.

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,080
All right, Mr. Navorski,
we'd like you to wait here, please.

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
Next, please.

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you doing
in the United States, Mr. Navorski?

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,720
Yellow taxicab, please.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,040
Take me to Ramada Inn,

37
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,600
161 Lexington.

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,520
Staying at the Ramada Inn?

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,960
Keep the change.

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,320
Do you know anyone in New York?

41
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,840
Yes.

42
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,600
- Who?
- Yes.

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,360
- Who?
- Yes.

44
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,600
- No, do you know anyone in New York?
- Yes.

45
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,560
- Who?
- Yes.

46
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,960
161 Lexington.

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,560
OK, Mr. Navorski, I need to see
your return ticket, please.

48
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,320
No, your return ticket. Your...

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
- Oh... Yes.
- Ah.

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,720
This is just a standard procedure.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm going to need the passport also.

52
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,840
Oh... OK.

53
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
- No, no.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
Mr. Navorski.

55
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,040
That. Passport.

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,680
That.

57
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs
and Border Protection here at JFK.

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,520
I help people
with their immigration problems.

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
We're looking for
an interpreter for you.

61
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,080
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,080
But I understand
that you speak a little English.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,800
- Yes.
- You do?

64
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,160
I hope you don't mind if I eat
while we talk. I've a bit of bad news.

65
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,160
Your country has suspended
all traveling privileges

66
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,800
on passports issued
by your government.

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,800
And our State Department
has revoked the visa

68
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,240
that was going to allow you
to enter the US.

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,000
That's it in a nutshell, basically.

70
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,360
While you were in the air there
was a military coup in your country.

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,400
Most of the dead were members
of the Presidential Guard.

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,960
They were attacked
in the middle of the night.

73
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,240
They got it all on GHN, I think.

74
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,720
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.

75
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,520
Mr. Navorski, your country
was annexed from the inside.

76
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,200
The Republic of Krakozhia
is under new leadership.

77
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,120
Krakozhia. Krakozhia

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,200
- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.

79
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,400
Er... Let me... OK. Look.

80
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,840
Imagine that these potato chips
are Krakozhia.

81
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,240
Kra-kozhia.

82
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,760
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.

83
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,760
- Krakozhia.
- OK.

84
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,640
Er... So the potato chips are Krakozhia.

85
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,280
- And this apple...
- Big Apple. Big Apple.

86
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,040
...Big Apple represents
the Liberty Rebels.

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,720
OK?

88
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,680
No more Krakozhia! OK?

89
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,320
New government.
Revolution. You understand?

90
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,600
All the flights in and out
of your country have been suspended.

91
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,600
The new government has sealed all
borders, so your visa's no longer valid.

92
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,200
So, currently
you are a citizen of nowhere.

93
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,160
Now, we can't process you new papers

94
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,000
until the US recognizes your country's
new diplomatic reclassification.

95
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,640
You don't qualify for asylum,
refugee status,

96
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,480
temporary protective status,
humanitarian parole,

97
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,480
or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.

98
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,440
You are at this time simply...

99
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,240
...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

100
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,560
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

101
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,200
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge,
Empire State, Broadway show Cats.

102
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,400
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.

103
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,280
OK. OK.

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,320
Now I go New York City. Thank you.

105
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,360
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you
to enter the United States at this time.

106
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,840
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.

107
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,560
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.

108
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,880
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?

109
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,160
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.

110
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,520
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.

111
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,520
Really? It's not important.

112
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,880
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,440
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.

114
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,680
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.

115
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,440
You have no right to enter the US
and I have no right to detain you.

116
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,960
You have fallen through
a crack in the system.

117
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,760
- I am crack.
- Yes. Until we get this sorted out,

118
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,920
I will allow you to enter
the International Transit Lounge.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,440
I'm going to sign a release form
that is going to make you a free man.

120
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,680
- Free?
- Free. Free.

121
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,560
Free to go anywhere you like
in the International Transit Lounge.

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,520
- OK?
- OK.

123
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,920
- OK.
- OK.

124
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
OK.

125
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,720
Uncle Sam will have this
sorted out by tomorrow,

126
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,200
and welcome
to the United States. Almost.

127
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,640
- Thank you.
- OK. All right.

128
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,640
Thanks, Judge.

129
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Announcing the arrival
of flight 76 from Singapore Airlines.

130
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Now, Mr. Navorski.

131
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,800
Mr. Navorski. Mr. Navorski.

132
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,360
This is the International
Transit Lounge.

133
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,400
You are free to wait here.
These are food vouchers.

134
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,560
You can use them in the Food Court.
Your Krakozhian money is no good here.

135
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,440
This is a 15-minute,
prepaid calling card.

136
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,800
You may call home, if you like.

137
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,800
This, in case we need to contact you,
is a pager.

138
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,080
You must keep this
with you at all times.

139
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,520
Here is an ID badge for you
to get into CBP. Beyond those doors...

140
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Mr. Navorski.
I'm going to need you to look at me.

141
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,960
Beyond those doors is American soil.

142
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,560
Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear

143
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,280
that you are not
to enter through those doors.

144
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,600
You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.

145
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
America closed.

146
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,600
What I do?

147
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,320
There's only one thing
you can do here, Mr. Navorski.

148
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Shop.

149
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,920
Passengers of flight 854
New York/Warsaw...

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,920
brass band plays]

151
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,880
...the international community
tries to secure a peaceful resolution.

152
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,160
The populace has to wonder if
they will ever find political stability,

153
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,400
or find the leadership to secure
their place on the world stage.

154
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,080
And next this hour,
looking to buy a 90-foot yacht?

155
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
...taken hostage. We're hearing
that the Vice President has been killed

156
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,360
along with four cabinet members,
13 inijured soldiers and 20 civilians.

157
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
By dawn, rebel leaders
had surrounded the state houses.

158
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,360
In a symbolic gesture, the national flag
of Krakozhia was torn down

159
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,480
from the Presidential Palace
and the parliament building.

160
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,160
Please. Please.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,440
Television.

162
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
Passenger Chen Wan-Shiu
and Liu Tao-Jing,

163
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,440
please come to podium
to pick up your boarding passes.

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This ijust in. Last night a military coup
overthrew the government of Krakozhia.

165
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,760
Bombing and gunfire
were heard through the night.

166
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,920
Although details are unclear,

167
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,200
we are told that President Vagobagin
and his aides have been taken hostage.

168
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,120
Bonijour, monsieur.
You are a Red Carpet Club member?

169
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,520
I need to see
your boarding pass and club card, sir.

170
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,600
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private lounge.

171
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,920
The public lounge is downstairs.

172
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,960
The tiniest nation in the region
has been shaken by another uprising.

173
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,680
Krakozhia has been involved in civil war
throughout the late '80s and '90s

174
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,600
as it has tried
to transition from Communist rule.

175
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,520
- Watch it!
- Please.

176
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
Please, telephone?
Telephone?

177
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,760
Telephone?

178
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,080
Please. Please.

179
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,560
For security reasons, please
keep your luggage with you at all times.

180
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,480
Unattended luggage will be removed
for inspection and may be destroyed.

181
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,040
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you broke my bag!

182
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,680
I got this in Paris.
This is my favorite bag.

183
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I can't believe you just broke my bag!
Mom, Dad! He broke my bag!

184
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,320
- Food document.
- Excuse me. Stop it. Stop it.

185
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,800
Do you have an appointment?

186
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,560
I don't let anyone to look
at my trash without an appointment.

187
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,520
I have an opening next Tuesday.

188
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Tuesday. Tuesday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Tuesday.

189
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,080
It will be good time for you
to come back and get lost.

190
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,400
OK, goodbye. Sorry.

191
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,080
Tuesday.

192
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,960
Don't shoot!

193
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,880
She sleeps 12, Frank. Has a
120-volt generator, wet bar, gas range.

194
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,840
She looks amazing.

195
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,440
She's my pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

196
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,240
She's a beautiful boat
and I hope you get her soon.

197
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,320
- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.

198
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,040
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.

199
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,000
Come on. Congratulations!

200
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,560
I'm nominating you to take my place.

201
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,760
You will assume the duties
of acting Field Commissioner

202
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,520
until you get approval from Washington.

203
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,960
Really? I don't know what to say.

204
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,360
- Jesus. Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.

205
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,760
Don't pretend to be surprised.

206
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,120
You've been waiting for me to retire
or drop dead for years now.

207
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,840
No, I haven't been
waiting for you to retire.

208
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,360
That's all right, Frank.

209
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,960
My retirement will become official
the day you get sworn in.

210
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,840
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.

211
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,440
Just be careful
about the inspection process.

212
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,400
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...

213
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,600
We're talking about
the Field Commissioner position.

214
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,800
People are going to look to you
for leadership, to set an example.

215
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,080
What are you saying?

216
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.

217
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,680
Ship the Colombians
off to asylum hearings,

218
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,400
and call the parents
of those kids from Long Island.

219
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,280
Tell them it was a bad idea
to let them go to Jamaica.

220
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,560
Come on, let's go. South America
and Madrid are on the tarmac.

221
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
I want them out of here in half an hour.

222
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,680
Mr. Thurman.

223
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,880
There's a man walking around
the terminal in a bathrobe.

224
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,360
I know, sir. You put him there.

225
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Welcome to the United States.

226
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,920
Next!

227
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,120
I need visa.

228
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,560
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.

229
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,520
Go to the wall.

230
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,000
Next!

231
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,960
Sir.

232
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,400
The light green form.

233
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,880
I love New York...

234
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,360
- I love it!
- New York

235
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,640
I love New York

236
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,040
I love New York...

237
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,120
Light green.

238
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,480
Mr. Navorski, you cannot
get into New York without a visa.

239
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,640
You cannot get a visa
without a passport,

240
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,440
and you cannot get
a new passport without a country.

241
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
There's nothing
we can do for you here.

242
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,960
I give you light green.

243
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm sorry,
but you've wasted an entire day.

244
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,160
At this time you are simply...

245
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,240
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.

246
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,240
Unacceptable.

247
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,080
Why is he still here?

248
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,240
You released him, sir.
You put him there.

249
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,080
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?

250
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,920
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.

251
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,240
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?

252
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,560
No news from the State Department,
but we can deport him in a few days.

253
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,240
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.

254
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,960
Who knows what this guy is thinking,
what gulag he escaped from.

255
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,920
Next!

256
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,320
Everything he does comes back to me.

257
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,080
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.

258
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,600
Hello.

259
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,520
Hello.

260
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,760
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.

261
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,960
Food document, trash. Tuesday.

262
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,320
Tuesday. I hate the Tuesday.

263
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,880
Excuse me.

264
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,160
Airports are tricky places,
Mr. Navorski.

265
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,880
I'm about to tell you something.

266
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,520
Something you can
never repeat to anyone.

267
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,200
Do you understand? It's a secret.

268
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,840
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.

269
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,120
At 12 o'clock today, the guards
at those doors will leave their posts

270
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,640
and their replacements
are going to be five minutes late.

271
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,760
Late five minutes.

272
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,800
Yes. Late five minutes. At 12 o'clock.
Just today. Just this once.

273
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,080
No one is going
to be watching those doors.

274
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,640
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.

275
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,840
No.

276
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,920
America, for five minutes, is open.

277
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,040
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.

278
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,760
Catch and release. It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.

279
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,800
You unhook him
and place him back in the water.

280
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,480
You set him free so that somebody else
can have the pleasure of catching him.

281
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,680
All right, here we go.

282
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,960
OK. Call them off.

283
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
Johnson, clear the doors.

284
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,200
All right. Go.

285
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,400
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.

286
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,120
All right.

287
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,880
Here we go.
Now where is he?

288
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,760
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.

289
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,720
There he is.

290
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,240
All right, Viktor.

291
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,480
Here we go.

292
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,560
What's so complicated? Exit, Viktor.

293
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,960
Come on. In a few minutes,
you'll be somebody else's problem.

294
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,160
He wants to make sure
nobody's watching.

295
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,640
I told him nobody would be watching.

296
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,000
Come on. All right, here we go.

297
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,440
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.

298
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,120
Excuse me.

299
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,280
You got it. There we go.

300
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,520
He's got to get a running start,
I guess.

301
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,000
Just leave. Just leave.

302
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Leave. Leave.

303
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,600
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling? Is he praying?

304
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,120
No. He's tying his shoelace.

305
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,640
Come on, leave.

306
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,600
Get the cameras.

307
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,680
Where is he? Where is he?

308
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,840
- To the left of here.
- No. He was at the door.

309
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,760
- Just go a little left.
- All right. All right.

310
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,800
I wait.

311
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,760
What are you looking at?
Go back to work. Thank you.

312
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,040
Oh, God. Oh, shit.

313
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,000
- This belong you?
- Thank you.

314
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,920
Oh, shit.

315
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,440
See? Wet floor.

316
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,040
That you.

317
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,600
I'm so late.

318
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,280
Buenos Aires.
I can't remember the gate.

319
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,440
Gate 24.

320
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,840
- You sure?
- Yes.

321
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,040
Thanks.

322
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,880
Ladies and gentlemen...

323
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,960
Wait.

324
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,640
For you. Payless Shoes.

325
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,240
Second floor.
Sensible heels.

326
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.

327
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,360
I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.

328
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,160
You don't know what you're talking
about. He doesn't speak English.

329
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,600
If he could learn to speak, this guy.

330
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,560
He can't speak English, how could he
have a meeting with a beautiful woman?

331
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,880
A flight attendant.

332
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,360
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.

333
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,920
She look like a Russian.
KGB. She gave him heel of her shoes.

334
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,880
And he gave her a piece of the paper.

335
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,320
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.

336
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,760
Must be some kind of the code.

337
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,520
You been spending too much time
inhaling them cleaning products.

338
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.

339
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,400
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

340
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,920
Excuse me, buddy.

341
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,360
What's going on?

342
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,560
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.

343
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,360
Good afternoon. Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your order?

344
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,240
Keep the change.

345
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,400
Excuse me.

346
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,080
OK, go. Go.

347
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,920
Good boy. Thank you.

348
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,000
Bye-bye.

349
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,680
Welcome to Burger King.

353
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Now that heavy fighting has subsided

354
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,040
and both sides have dug in
for the long winter ahead,

355
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,280
it's clear that the future of Krakozhia
may be in doubt for some time to come.

356
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,000
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia
suffer the consequences.

00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,200
Next.

372
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,880
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Navorski.

373
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,400
Why do you wait here every day
when there's nothing I can do for you?

374
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,240
Your new visa will not arrive until
your country is recognized by the US.

375
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,280
You have two stamp.

376
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,200
One red, one green.

377
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,560
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.

378
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,960
Yes. That's a beautiful way to look at
it, but America doesn't work that way.

379
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,160
As acting Field Commissioner,
I've created a new position here at JFK.

380
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,360
Transportation Liaison
for Passenger Assistance.

381
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,400
Sir, what will that person do?

382
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,920
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

383
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,720
I'm Transportation Liaison
in charge of Passenger Assistance.

384
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,400
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.

385
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,800
It'll be days before he goes through
the doors in violation of section 2.14

386
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,800
Then he's somebody else's problem.

387
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Why don't we tag him
in violation of section 2.14 now?

388
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,360
Then ship him to detention.

389
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,520
He has to break the law by leaving.

390
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,840
I won't lie, particularly to get rid
of somebody like him.

391
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,920
- Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!

392
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,200
Put it down. Put it down.

393
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,440
Put it down.

394
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,960
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.

395
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,280
It's my job. Stay off my floor.
Stay away from my mop.

396
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,920
- Food.
- If you touch it again, I kill you.

397
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,800
Hey. I'm Enrique Cruz.

398
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,000
We need to talk.

399
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,600
- I want to make a deal with you.
- What deal?

400
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,920
I need information
on CBP Officer Torres.

401
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,920
You feed me information about her
and I'll feed you.

402
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,280
- What do you want know?
- You see her every day.

403
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,840
I want to know
what makes her knees weak.

404
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,920
What makes her blood boil
and her body tingle.

405
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,120
She's a wild stallion
and you'll help me break her.

406
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,640
I'm...

407
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,840
I'm her man of mystery.

408
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,640
- Officer Torres is wild stallion?
- Her name is Delores.

409
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,520
You help me to win her heart
and you'll never go hungry again.

410
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,360
- I do this.
- Really? Promise?

411
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,520
- Yes.
- OK. Thank you.

412
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,560
What mean, "wild stallion"?

413
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,840
Officer Torres.
My friend say you are stallion.

414
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,840

415
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,760

432
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,960
- The Rockettes?
- Can't afford it.

433
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,360

to ask me these things?

473
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,560
It's a man of misery.

474
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,080
Misery?

475
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,240
- Mystery?
- No, no. Misery. Man of misery.

476
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,960
He's so sick. He's so in love.

477
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,680
But what did she say?

478
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,840
She did say, "Next! Next!"

479
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,560
And now she say,
"Please. Please come. "

480
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,560
That's... Wait.

481
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,400
- I coming now.
- No, wait. Viktor.

482
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,200
Viktor, just tell me more.

483
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,200
I coming. I coming.

484
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,160
Please, please.

485
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,160
Beeper went off.
Started beeping. So, I grab. I come.

486
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,880
We have an idea.

487
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,040
Would you like something to eat?

488
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,600
No. No food. I stuffed.

489
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,560
OK. All right.

490
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,840
Thank you.

491
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,520
So, Mr. Navorski,
I have some very good news for you.

492
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,320
What?

493
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,760
I've figured out a way
to get you out of this airport.

494
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,400
How?

495
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens

496
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,040
who have a credible fear
of returning to their own country.

497
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,520
If we can establish this fear with you,

498
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,920
then the CBP will be forced
to begin Expedited Removal Procedures,

499
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,600
to bring you to an immigration judge
and let you plead your case for asylum.

500
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,760
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.

501
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,680
Unfortunately, the courts
are so backed up with asylum cases

502
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,440
that the soonest you'd get before
a judge would be six months from now.

503
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,080
Yes, and we would have no choice

504
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:58,160
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.

505
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,280
You would be free to wait
in New York until your court date.

506
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,480
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.

507
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,280
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.

508
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,640
You can go to New York City tonight.

509
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,560
But, you only get to go
if we can establish a credible fear.

510
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,240
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.

511
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,760
- Fear.
- Fear.

512
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,960
From what?

513
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,800
That's the best part.

514
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,160
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

515
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,640
So I'm going to ask you one question,

516
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,840
if you give me the correct answer, I can
get you out of this airport tonight.

517
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,040
So, I answer one question.

518
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,720
Go to New York City. Tonight.

519
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,800
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

520
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,040
- OK.
- OK.

521
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,240
All right.

522
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,800
Do you, at this time, have any fear
of returning to your own country?

523
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,760
No.

524
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,680
OK. Let me try it again.

525
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,520
- Your country's at war.
- Yes. War.

526
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,920
There are men in the streets
with guns. Political persecution.

527
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,280
- Yes. It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.

528
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,480
And God only knows
what could happen.

529
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,040
Innocent people
are torn from their beds.

530
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,920
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.

531
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,000
So you're afraid.

532
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,120
- From what?
- Krakozhia.

533
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,920
You're afraid of Krakozhia.

534
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,920
Krakozhia?

535
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,240
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.

536
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,880
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.

537
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,920
Human rights.

538
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,640
Viktor, please don't be afraid
to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

539
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,920
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.

540
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,640
So? I go to New York City now?

541
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,080
- No.
- No?

542
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,680
OK.

543
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,680
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.

544
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,720
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.

545
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,120
I'm afraid from Wolfmens,
afraid from sharks.

546
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,480
Thanks a lot.

547
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,560
Damn.

548
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,080
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.

549
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,680
This is the only fun I have.

550
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,800
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?

551
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,200
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.

552
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,440
I take four back-to-back flights,

553
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,440
fly 27 hours straight
literally around the world,

554
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,200
and now you tell me you're going
to spend July 4th with your wife?

555
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,160
The woman hates fireworks.

556
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,520
Don't lie to me, OK?

557
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,920
I know for a fact
you took her to Rome last weekend.

558
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,400
Because you flew United, Max.

559
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,560
South African Airlines
passenger Sharif Al-Calala,

560
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
please come to the main ticket counter.

561
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,480
You make a habit out of listening
to other people's conversations?

562
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,520
No, I try to call home.

563
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,040
So then...

564
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,960
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.

565
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,760
Because they're all liars.

566
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,200
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

567
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,280
Wet floor.

568
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,960
Please. Don't be hurt.

569
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,640
How can I not be? He's married.

570
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,680
One man. Two womens. Crowded.

571
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,720
You want to know
what the worst part is?

572
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,840
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.

573
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,640
What kind of sick person am I?

574
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,120
I'm rooting for the home team.

575
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,840
I just wish the sex
wasn't so amazing.

576
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,480
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.

577
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,160
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,

578
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,440
I just stare at him over room service.

579
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,720
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.

580
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,920
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.

581
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,960
That we belong together.

582
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,960
This... man... has you.

583
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,280
Why he need... puzzle?

584
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,120
This is my problem.

585
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,520
I always see men
the way I want to see them.

586
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,640
Do I know you from someplace?

587
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,520
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes. Second floor.

588
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,680
Oh...

589
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,640
You headed for home?

590
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,400
Er... No, no. I am...

591
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,560
I am delayed a long time.

592
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,520
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?

593
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:42,840
I go from one building
to another building.

594
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,960
I have beeper.

595
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,400
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.

596
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,640
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.

597
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,920
What's "BH"?

598
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,880
In English...

599
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,960
Viktor Navorski.

600
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,320
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?

601
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,400
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

602
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,400
Nice to see you again.

603
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,440
You like Italian food?

604
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,360
I know, it's late
and you've probably got other plans,

605
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,920
but if you'd like to grab some dinner,
we can run right out and catch a cab.

606
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,320
I know a place
that has the greatest cannelloni.

607
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,880
Erm...

608
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,320
No, I... I can't.

609
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,160
- You married?
- No.

610
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,040
- Girlfriend?
- No.

611
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,400
I... I can't go out... with you.

612
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,080
God. I am so... I'm so sorry.

613
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,360
I am so sorry.

614
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,160
I must come off
like a complete nut job or something.

615
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,360
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.

616
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,360
Wet floor. Wet floor.

617
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,560
- I...
- You don't have to explain.

618
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,520
No, I... Please, I...

619
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,640
Wheelchair to gate A-five.

620
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,920
Nadia.

621
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,160
In New York restaurant,
what cost is cantaloni?

622
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,280
I don't know. Maybe 15 bucks.

623
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,480
- Dollars?
- 20.

624
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,680
Two people, 40.

625
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,680
Two people, 40 dollars.

626
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,440
Two people, 40 dollars.

627
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,400
I... I... help you?

628
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,880
I'm so sorry, sir.
The position has already been filled.

629
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,960
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes. Gate 67.

630
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,120
Because we are very particular
about punctual... Did you say Gate 67?

631
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,960
Gate 67.

632
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,680
You got to be kidding.

633
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,280
You got to help me help you.
I don't see a Social Security number...

634
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,920
...mailing address,
even a phone number.

635
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,600
Telephone? You need? I get.
I get. I get phone.

636
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,560
I get... I get phone.

637
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,080
451-1226.

638
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,120
All right.
When's the best time to reach you?

639
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,040
Now?

640
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,080
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Navorski.

641
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,440
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?

642
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,880
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.

643
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,160
Cliff. Hello.

644
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,720
- How's it going?
- Good.

645
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,400
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.

646
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,960
Well, I got to tell you
that the position's been filled.

647
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,520
Yeah, so could you please
go sit someplace else?

648
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,400
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.

649
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,760
- All right.
- Thank you.

650
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,160
OK.

651
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,240
Who is this?

652
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,640
- Who are you?
- It's no one.

653
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,200
There's no one here for
two weeks. This isn't one of my guys.

654
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,000
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.

655
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,800
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?

656
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,920
Does Harry think
he's running this job?

657
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,120
- I go now.
- Go? Go where?

658
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,640
- Gate 67.
- 67?

659
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,760
We're ten months away from 67.

660
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,200
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...

661
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,600
Harry's trying to make me look bad.

662
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,080
I've got to slow him down
before he gets to 67.

663
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,840
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.

664
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,080
Pull him off Harry's crew,
put him on mine.

665
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,120
You start 6.30 Monday morning.

666
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,800
You give me job?

667
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,520
6.30, yes... Boss.

668
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,160
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.

669
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,760
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.

670
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,280
OK. Just bring it.

671
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,000
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.

672
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,280
Look. The man without a country.

673
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,240
Come on in. Welcome.

674
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,120
- I see this.
- You did well.

675
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,680
Have a seat.

676
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,880
- Here?
- Here.

677
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,320
Come on, sit down.

678
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,640
- Who invited him?
- I did. We needed a fourth, right?

679
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,760
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?

680
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,720
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?

681
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,280
He could be recording
everything we say. A wire in his shirt.

682
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,640
A microphone up in his ass.

683
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,520
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.

684
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,240
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.

685
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,920
Close your eyes.

686
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,200
- OK. So you are clean.
- Good. Let's play cards.

687
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,720
I will have money.
But... Friday.

688
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,600
Don't worry about it. We play for
unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.

689
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,000
You'll be amazed
at what people leave at airports. Come.

690
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,280
I have two nines and two nines.

691
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,240
Four nines. Thank you.

692
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,680
- Careful.
- Watch out.

693
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,640
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.

694
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,480
What is in the can?

695
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,080
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.

696
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,200
We know there's no nuts in there.

697
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,040
What is in there?

698
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,080
This is jazz.

699
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,600
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.

700
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,120
- Jazz?
- Yes.

701
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,280
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.

702
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,680
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.

703
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,440
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys. OK.

704
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,800
For tonight's grand prize, we have...

705
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,520
Show them, Gupta.

706
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,440
I found this upstairs.

707
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,080
Virgin Air, first class lounge.

708
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,080
There you go.

709
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,520
And... they belong to?

710
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,200
Cher.

711
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,760
Cher?

712
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,280
As in... Cher?

713
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,600
Yeah. Cher.

714
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,880
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.

715
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,160
Those are Cher's panties.

716
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,880
- Ready?
- Hurry up.

717
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,520
So, will we share the panties?

718
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,000
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.

719
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,560
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

720
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:06,880
United Airlines
flight number 801 to Narita

721
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,920
United Airlines
flight number 801 to Narita

722
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,040
is now announcing final boarding.

723
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,520
"You can't.
That is mine. "

724
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,760
"You can get so confused. "

725
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,000
"You can get so confused. "

726
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,520
Viktor?

727
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,920
Well, hi.

728
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,160
Please.

729
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,200
- How are you?
- Good.

730
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,000
Man.

731
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:34,680
I am so sorry about what happened
last time, asking you out like that.

732
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,560
I'm so used to guys
trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet

733
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,800
that when I meet somebody that doesn't,
I don't know how to react.

734
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,040
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.

735
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,600
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know. Both.

736
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,600
Tell me about it.

737
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,280
Napoleon?

738
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:56,080
Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.

739
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,160
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.

740
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,680
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah. He's one of my favorites.

741
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,080
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.

742
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,480
- His ego.
- Ego?

743
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,560
Yes.

744
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,880
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,

745
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,920
Napoleon isolates himself
on the tiny island of Saint Helena.

746
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,440
No one knows exactly
what happens next,

747
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,720
but the version I like goes like this:

748
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,040
He's very depressed
and decides to take his own life.

749
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,680
But Napoleon believes himself
to be of such superhuman strength

750
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,520
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job.

751
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:37,000
His stomach is so full up with poison
that his body rejects it,

752
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,920
and he doesn't die.

753
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,120
See? Ego. Saved his life.

754
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,360
Maybe he need glasses.

755
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,160
- Glasses?
- Yes. To read words on bottle.

756
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,160
Poison.

757
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,160
It's funny you should say that.

758
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,840
Rumor has it
that Napoleon was farsighted.

759
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,480
- There you go.
- There you go.

760
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,200
- There you go.
- And there you go.

761
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,120
I think we're rewriting history
right here.

762
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,120
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?

763
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,040
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.

764
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,080
I just did it again.

765
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,240
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?

766
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,040
I'm sick. I don't have the ability
to be alone for five seconds.

767
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,040
OK.

768
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,640
- OK, what?
- OK.

769
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,680
Lunch... with you.

770
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,920
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.

771
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,560
You're not running for a flight or...?

772
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,000
I wait.

773
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,720
- It's me.
- You. Yes.

774
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,160
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.

775
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,760
You work?

776
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,600
- No.
- Ah.

777
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,360
Three of you. Crowded.

778
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,680
Stay away from me, Viktor.

779
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,440
I'm... I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.

780
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,640
I just keep ingesting these poisonous
men until I make myself sick.

781
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,480
- You're not sick, Amelia. No.
- No?

782
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,760
No. You're a little... farsighted.

783
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,640
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.

784
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,760
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.

785
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,880
Your CBP inspection's in three days.

786
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,800
The FBI and Homeland Security
will tour the airport,

787
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,680
spend two hours observing these offices
before your interview process begins.

788
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,280
How much does Navorski make?

789
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,800
Sir?

790
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,440
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?

791
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,360
They're paying him cash under the table.

792
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,600
I know that. How much?

793
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,600
$19 an hour.

794
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,640
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?

795
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,720
That's New York City construction.

796
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,400
One of my own men
came up to me the other day.

797
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,120
Asked me
if I wanted to join the big pool.

798
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,600
Look at him.

799
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,880
Place a bet on when Navorski's
going to leave this airport.

800
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,840
Have you heard about this?

801
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,600
I have January 3rd.

802
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,880
Bring him in.

803
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,480
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK? No country.

804
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,280
He's a national security risk, according
to my interpretation of Section 2.12.

805
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,160
I want you to put him in a detention
center and run a clearance on him.

806
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,120
That's all I want.

807
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,600
What about a federal prison?

808
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,640
What about another airport?

809
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,080
Hello? Hello?

810
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,720
We're detaining so many people,
there's no room anywhere.

811
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,600
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody. Nobody'll take him.

812
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,080
You want me to bring him back
to the terminal?

813
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,560
No. From now on, Navorski lives here.

814
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,600
The people who are coming here today
will be observing me, inspecting me.

815
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,080
But most of all they will be looking
at the way that this airport is run.

816
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,120
So let's show them why this is the
number-one airport in the United States.

817
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,520
We process about 600 planes a day,

818
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,160
with a processing time
of 37 minutes per plane,

819
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,120
about 60 seconds per passenger...

820
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,640
...to be brought into the country.

821
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,040
We keep it as clean as possible.

822
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,280
- What do you import?
- Computer software.

823
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,840
That's a lot of walnuts.

824
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,880
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.

825
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,560
Every time I go to Brazil,
I bring her back a bag.

826
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,280
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.

827
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,240
Mind if I try one?

828
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,280
How did you know
those weren't for his mother-in-law?

829
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,160
If he's married,
where's his ring?

830
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,400
And if he's divorced,
who still talks to their mother-in-law?

831
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,600
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...

832
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,400
- Sir.
- Yeah.

833
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,160
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.

834
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,600
- It'll have to wait.
- No. This won't wait.

835
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:35,000
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they
found four prescriptions without an MPL.

836
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,640
They tried to take the pills away
and he went nuts.

837
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,280
There he is.
We think they're for his father.

838
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,080
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.

839
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:47,040
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right. We're here to help you.

840
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,160
We're here to help you, sir.
All right. Give me the knife.

841
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,840
- Where's he from?
- Russia.

842
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,440
The only interpreter
we got is in Newark.

843
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:58,080
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.

844
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,440
Viktor.

845
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,080
Viktor.

846
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,640
Oh...

847
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,640
I need your help.

848
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,560
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.

849
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,320
He may not speak your dialect,

850
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,720
but I need you to translate
and help me out.

851
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,520
- I help you? Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.

852
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,920
This guy's very upset.

853
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,040
Just calm him down
and I'll let you back in the terminal.

854
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,480
No. New York.
No red stamp. Green. I green.

855
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,720
- New York.
- OK, yes.

856
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,720
- You say yes?
- Yes.

857
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,320
- OK. OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!

858
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,360
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you. Go ahead.

859
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,680
Stay out!

860
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,640
So?

861
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,080
OK, tell him in order to export
medicines from this country,

862
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:10,360
he needs to have the proper form,
a Medicinal Purchase License.

863
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,320
OK? You understand me, Viktor?

864
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,960
He say he bring
the medicine for his father.

865
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,320
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.

866
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,640
It doesn't matter.

867
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:53,480
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.

868
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,120
He did not know
he need this document.

869
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,280
No one say to him
he need document form.

870
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,600
I'm saying it to him.

871
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,920
He needs to have the form signed by
the hospital who is treating his father.

872
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,960
These medicines
have to stay in the United States.

873
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,320
They have to stay here.

874
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,960
He... He's begging you.

875
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,360
I know. I can see that he's begging.

876
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,840
I'm sorry, sir.

877
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,880
You'll have to take a flight in the
morning. The medicine stays here.

878
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,880
I'm sorry.

879
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,080
Send him down!

880
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,920
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job. Let's go.

881
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,000
Whoa.

882
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,200
Goat.

883
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:23,960
- What?
- Goat. It medicine is for goat.

884
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,760
- Goat?
- Yes. Medicine is for goat. Goat.

885
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,680
- He said that?
- Yes.

886
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,640
He say...

887
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,520
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".

888
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,240
Why? What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?

889
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,440
- It's not for his dying father?
- No. No.

890
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:52,000
The... Krakozhia...
The name for "father"...

891
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,440
sound like "goat".

892
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,440
I make mistake.

893
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,360
Why are you doing this, Viktor?

894
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,520
Medicine is for... goat.

895
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,760
- No, it's not.
- Yes.

896
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,640
- No.
- Yes.

897
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,840
You read the blue immigration form.

898
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,920
- Blue?
- Yes. Blue.

899
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,840
- Blue?
- Blue. The blue form.

900
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,440
The one that says if it's an animal,
he doesn't need the license.

901
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,520
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor. That's very good.

902
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,800
Why are you doing this? Huh?

903
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,720
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.

904
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,040
Look at me.

905
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,040
I was going to help you.

906
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,480
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.

907
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,400
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.

908
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,360
I want to hear him say
who the medicine is for.

909
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,280
Please. Who the medicine is for.

910
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,840
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?

911
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,480
OK. The pills stay. He goes. That's it.

912
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,360
Goat.

913
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,640
Please. For goat.

914
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:33,360
Medicine for goat.

915
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,560
Give him the pills.

916
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,080
Medicine for goat.

917
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,320
Medicine...

918
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,000
Come on now, it's all over.

919
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,000
He love that goat.

920
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,320
Do you think I need an excuse
to put you back in that cell

921
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,320
to keep you there for five years?

922
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,640
You go to war with me, and you go to war
with the United States.

923
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:12,480
Then you'll know why Krakozhians
wait in line for cheap toilet paper

924
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,720
while Uncle Sam wipes his ass
with Charmin two-ply.

925
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,720
There was a 20 man.

926
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,520
Immigration gun was drawn.

927
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,440
The Dixon was ready to fire.

928
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,080
To kill the little man with the pills.

929
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:41,360
But then someone walks into the room
and stand in front of this little man.

930
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,520
"Put the guns away," the man say.

931
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,960
"Nobody will die today. "

932
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,720
Who?

933
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,520
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us. Who was it?

934
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,520
Who was this man?

935
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:04,120
Navorski. Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.

936
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,520
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.

937
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,240
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules
and concentrate on the people.

938
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,440
The people, I know.

939
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,920
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.

940
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,720
You could learn
something from Navorski.

941
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,800
Cheer up. It's not over yet.

942
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,960
- Is that for me?
- Yes. Yes.

943
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,720
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.

944
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,920
For you.

945
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,360
For wall.

946
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,080
Fish for wall.

947
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,160
Why do you want to go to New York?

948
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,160
And what's in the can of peanuts?

949
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,120
Promise.

950
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,400
- A promise in the can?
- Yes. A promise.

951
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,480
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.

952
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,960
And this is a promise
that comes from a man who is stuck here.

953
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,520
A man who may be stuck here
for the next ten years.

954
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,720
From now on, you and I are partners.

955
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,680
If I stay, you stay.

956
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,680
You will not set one foot
in New York City.

957
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,520
Not a single toe
in the United States of America.

958
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,200
Do you understand
what I am saying to you?

959
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,680
Yes.

960
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,200
You don't like fish.

961
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,280
Do you ever feel
like you're just living in an airport?

962
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,680
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.

963
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,760
I can mail you
anywhere in the US.

964
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,200
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.

965
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:20,240
- No. I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.

966
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,360
- I do.
- What's her name?

967
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,680
Amelia Warren.

968
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,480
I thought we were looking
for a way out, not a way in.

969
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,000
Be careful. Those flight attendants
ain't like regular women.

970
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:34,240
Flying back and forth between time zones
messes with their biological clock.

971
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,280
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.

972
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:42,280
I am leaving.
They will come for us.

973
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,760
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.

974
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,680
You go in jail. Not me.

975
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,600
For... You know what? Forget it.

976
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,400
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?

977
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,160
- Yes. Yes.
- Warren.

978
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,880
Amelia Jane Warren?

979
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,840
- Jane?
- Yeah.

980
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,800
Way to go, Viktor. First class.

981
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,440
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.

982
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:47,360
Amelia,
would you like to get eat to bite?

983
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,640
Bite to eat? Cantaloni?

984
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,760
Bite to eat?

985
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,960
Bite to eat?

986
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,120
Eat to bite? Eat to bite.

987
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:20,520
Bite to eat.

988
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,640
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

989
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,760
Bite to eat. Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

990
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,400
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

991
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,120
Bite to eat. Bite to eat. Bite to eat...

992
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,600
Gupta, you been ever married?

993
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,560
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?

994
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:48,240
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.

995
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,640
Why?

996
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:54,760
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.

997
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,960
Made just enough money to survive.

998
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:02,040
One day this policeman comes in
and tells me I owe him some tax.

999
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:06,360
I said OK.
This is common. So I pay him.

1000
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:11,080
The next day, the same policeman
come and keep coming and keep coming.

1001
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:15,000
And I am paying and I'm paying him
and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.

1002
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:20,360
And finally, on the fifth day, I take
a knife and I stab him in his chest.

1003
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:25,800
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.

1004
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,080
When they tried to arrest me,
I run away.

1005
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:31,200
So you never go home?

1006
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,760
If I go home,
I go in the jail for seven years.

1007
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:42,720
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.

1008
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,120
As long as I keep
my floor clean, keep my head down,

1009
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,040
they have no reason to deport me.

1010
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,240
They have no reason
to notice a man like me.

1011
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:02,040
United Airlines Flight 2703
from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.

1012
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,440
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1013
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,960
No, no, no. It's wet.

1014
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,200
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.

1015
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,160
Watch out!

1016
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,640
- Amelia.
- Viktor.

1017
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,560
- Hello.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1018
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,200
He nearly killed me.

1019
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,160
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

1020
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,320
I love the suit.

1021
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,080
Hugo Boss.

1022
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,320
On sale, $149.99.

1023
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,240
That's a bargain.

1024
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,200
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.

1025
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,040
And Josephine.

1026
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,400
Do you know what Napoleon
gave Josephine on their wedding day?

1027
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,960
Amelia?

1028
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,640
Would you like to have eat to bite?

1029
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,200
Food. Tonight?

1030
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,760
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.

1031
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,600
Yeah. Sure.

1032
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,040
- What time?
- Dinnertime.

1033
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,040
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.

1034
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,320
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.

1035
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,000
This way, please.

1036
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,480
Thank you.

1037
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,360
I didn't know they had a patio up here.

1038
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,400
It's very nice.

1039
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,120
Good night.

1040
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,200
Please. Please. Please. Please.

1041
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,640
Sorry. So, tonight we have
cannellonis or chicken.

1042
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,400
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.

1043
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,360
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

1044
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,240
For you, sir?

1045
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,280
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.

1046
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,280
I'll be back.

1047
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,160
Let me see. Enjoy.

1048
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,440
Did you know the croissant
was invented in Romania?

1049
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,080
- Tell me.
- OK.

1050
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,720
It's 1742
and the Turks invade Bucharest,

1051
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,800
making a surprise attack
under the cover of night.

1052
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,320
But the town bakers...

1053
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,040
Sorry.

1054
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,440
So, the bakers?

1055
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,920
- No, never mind. It's a dumb story.
- No, please.

1056
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,240
I'm sorry, Viktor.

1057
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:39,120
Nobody really cares
where the croissant was invented.

1058
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,640
I'll bet the Romanians themselves
don't give a shit.

1059
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,000
I care.

1060
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,760
Is histories. Is truth.

1061
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,360
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.

1062
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,680
- Yeah.
- No.

1063
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,640
- That's the truth.
- You are not.

1064
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:01,040
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of
the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.

1065
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,400
I'm 39.

1066
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,880
So? I was 39 once.

1067
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,600
I was 18 years old
when I started working for the airlines.

1068
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,120
I've been doing this over 20 years.

1069
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,640
And now there's no more pretending.

1070
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,600
This is it.

1071
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:22,640
It's why my address book is by city
and my pager goes off during dinner.

1072
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,160
You can switch off pager.

1073
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,800
I wish I could.

1074
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,320
I've been waiting for a phone call
for seven years.

1075
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:39,560
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.

1076
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,880
That's why I live out of hotels and have
my little suitcase packed, ready to go,

1077
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,320
just in case
he wants to meet me for the weekend.

1078
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,360
Yeah.

1079
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,840
I've been waiting my whole life.

1080
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:00,040
Just don't know what the hell for.

1081
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,080
I'm so sorry.

1082
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,720
I live here.

1083
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,840
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.

1084
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,800
Gate 67.

1085
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,680
- You live at the airport?
- Yes. Day and night.

1086
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,160
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.

1087
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,960
So I wait.

1088
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,760
All frequent fliers
feel the same way you do, Viktor.

1089
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,040
Everybody's waiting. Everybody.

1090
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:46,600
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.

1091
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:49,040
Then what are you waiting for?

1092
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,000
Is OK. I understand.

1093
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,280
I have an idea.

1094
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,000
- Come here.
- What you do?

1095
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,480
You sure?

1096
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,000
More than anything, I'm sure of this.

1097
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,960
Ready?

1098
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,440
So, when do you come back?

1099
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,360
So, when do you come back?

1100
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,640
13 days. How about you?

1101
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,320
I will be here.

1102
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,720
But what if your schedule changes?

1103
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,240
Maybe we should
exchange phone numbers.

1104
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,160
No. I will be here.

1105
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:48,400
You know what Napoleon give
to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1106
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,040
Tell me.

1107
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,080
Come on. Tell me.

1108
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,440
I will show you. 13 days from now.

1109
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,960
What's he doing?

1110
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,560
I can't ask him. I'm supposed
to tell him what he's doing.

1111
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,440
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.

1112
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:31,520
I'm sorry. Sorry.
You got to do this for me.

1113
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,840
You'll get really fat
with all the food I'm going to give you.

1114
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,320
But, please, do this for me. It will be
the last thing I ask you to do.

1115
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:01,000
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.

1116
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:09,960
- I have to work.
- He will wait.

1117
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,240
- How was your flight?
- Good.

1118
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,440
Thanks.

1119
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,800
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.

1120
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,120
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.

1121
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,080
Please follow me.

1122
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,040
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.

1123
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,520
In my line of work,
there are three things that matter.

1124
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:01,400
The person, the document and the story.

1125
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,200
Find the truth of one
and you find the truth of all three.

1126
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,520
I need your help finding the truth.

1127
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:14,360
Do you know a man
named Viktor Navorski?

1128
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,920
Yes.

1129
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:19,480
Do you know why he's here
and where he's from?

1130
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,280
No. We're just friends.

1131
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:28,200
Have you noticed that he hides a can
of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?

1132
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,600
So?

1133
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,600
What do you make of that?

1134
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,440
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.

1135
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:41,280
We know that he's planning to go
to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.

1136
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,520
Has he told you why he's in New York?

1137
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,800
No.

1138
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:48,600
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No. We just met at the airport.

1139
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:52,400
All I know is that he's a building
contractor, living out of a suitcase.

1140
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,760
That's it.

1141
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,160
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.

1142
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,160
That's what he said?

1143
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,880
Amelia. I'm just curious.

1144
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,920
You are the kind of woman
who can get any guy she wants.

1145
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,600
Why Viktor Navorski?

1146
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,840
That's something a guy like you
could never understand.

1147
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:46,720
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.

1148
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,920
Please. Sit.

1149
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,880
It's OK, Viktor. All men lie.

1150
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,360
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.

1151
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:59,000
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.

1152
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,120
Maybe you see the man
the way you want see the man.

1153
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:07,240
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?

1154
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,080
- I...
- Unacceptable?

1155
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,320
Yes. Yes.

1156
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,320
You want to hear the funny part?

1157
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,760
I broke up with him.

1158
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,320
I was coming here to tell you
he's out of my life.

1159
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:23,160
I'm free. I got tired of waiting.

1160
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,160
At least we have that in common.

1161
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:35,360
Amelia, you know what Napoleon
give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1162
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,560
No.

1163
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,680
I show you.

1164
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,880
Please. Please.

1165
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,560
Sit. Please.

1166
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:08,160
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.

1167
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,680
One thousand fountains.

1168
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:13,880
You built this for me?

1169
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,680
Please. Sit. Don't get wet.

1170
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,920
Come on.

1171
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,320
Oh...

1172
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,480
It no work.

1173
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:39,280
It should shoot,
big water up to ceiling.

1174
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:45,520
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?

1175
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,160
Are you a criminal?

1176
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:55,840
You're living here, Viktor.

1177
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:59,800
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.

1178
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,760
Here. I show you.

1179
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,480
My father.

1180
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,720
Viktor, please tell me
your father isn't in that peanut can.

1181
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,760
This is jazz.

1182
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,720
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,

1183
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:40,480
see this photograph
in Hungarian newspaper 1958.

1184
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,240
He say he look at photograph
for seven days.

1185
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,200
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...

1186
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,600
Who are they?

1187
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:52,240
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie,
Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,

1188
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,200
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.

1189
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,680
57 of them all together.

1190
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,120
After looking at photograph
for seven days, my father has idea.

1191
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:06,040
He begin to write letters to club,
Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.

1192
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:11,200
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.

1193
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,160
And then he wait.

1194
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:17,760
He wait month, week, year.

1195
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,720
My father wait 40 year.

1196
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,320
And they all sign names.

1197
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,280
One by one.

1198
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:51,800
They all write their name
and send it to my father.

1199
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,880
All but not one.

1200
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,520
Benny Golson.

1201
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,880
Saxophone.

1202
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:14,040
My father die before Benny Golson
write his name and send to my father.

1203
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,800
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.

1204
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:26,840
I promise I will go New York,
find Benny Golson,

1205
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,680
have him write name to put in can.

1206
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,240
And you've been living here
so you could do this for your father?

1207
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,800
Maybe I think he do it for me.

1208
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:46,360
You say you are waiting for something.

1209
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:51,360
And I say to you,
"Yes, yes. We all wait".

1210
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,640
What are you waiting for?

1211
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:02,720
You. I wait for you.

1212
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,720
What?

1213
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,120
The war is over.

1214
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:08,760
...the right-wing military coup
that ousted President Vagobagin...

1215
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,240
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.

1216
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:41,040
Let's have a toast to my friend,
Viktor "The Goat".

1217
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,240
May he never lose his country again.

1218
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,360
Krakozhia!

1219
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:51,200
Amelia! You here early!

1220
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,440
Hello. Amelia, look.

1221
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,000
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace. Come.

1222
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,920
See, the war,
the war Krakozhia is over.

1223
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,560
Peace. The war is over.

1224
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,480
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.

1225
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:11,200
He has a lot of connections. Here.

1226
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,880
It's a pass, Viktor.

1227
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,760
A one-day travel emergency visa
with your name on it.

1228
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,520
- Wha... Visa?
- Yes.

1229
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,680
- From your friend?
- Yeah.

1230
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,600
Just go to New York, find that last name
and put it in the can.

1231
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,440
- I go New York?
- Yes.

1232
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,000
I go New York!

1233
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,160
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.

1234
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:45,760
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?

1235
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,600
He did it for me.

1236
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,440
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.

1237
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:59,200
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.

1238
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,800
I not confused... Not this. Not this.

1239
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,560
I'm sorry. I'm running late.

1240
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:10,560
Amelia. Why you go? Why you go?

1241
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,320
You know what Napoleon
gave Josephine as a wedding present?

1242
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,400
It was a gold locket.

1243
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,640
And on the inside,
he made an inscription.

1244
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,240
"Destiny".

1245
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,800
Destiny.

1246
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,080
...reijoice in the streets
as well as in their local taverns.

1247
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:41,760
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye
from high atop the parliament buildings.

1248
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,800
It is a clear sign of the power...

1249
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,520
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

1250
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,560
I missed you.

1251
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,480
Come on.

1252
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,240
Next.

1253
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,880
Viktor.

1254
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:17,080
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?

1255
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,920
What do you have here?

1256
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,800
What do you have here?

1257
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,200
Oh, no. It's not signed.

1258
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,520
What?

1259
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:43,280
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.

1260
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:47,720
To validate authenticity, it needs
to be signed by the supervising officer.

1261
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,200
Dixon?

1262
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,520
Yes.

1263
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,200
Dixon.

1264
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,280
The war in my country is over.

1265
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:07,120
Yeah. I know. Congratulations.

1266
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:09,080
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?

1267
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,480
When you wait so long for one thing?

1268
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:15,760
One tiny moment.

1269
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,360
I had that moment today, too.

1270
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,600
You see this badge?

1271
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:24,360
This badge means that I was made
CBP Field Commissioner.

1272
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:29,240
It means that my authority over the
security of this airport is absolute.

1273
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,880
Your ticket and your passport.

1274
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,720
It's time for you to go home.

1275
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:45,000
Officer Waylin, please show
Mr. Navorski into the terminal

1276
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,880
and make sure
he does not miss his flight.

1277
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,880
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.

1278
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,000
I think I want go New York City.

1279
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,360
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.

1280
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:09,280
I no more "unacceptable".

1281
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:12,680
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.

1282
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:17,160
Are you sure you want to do that?

1283
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,840
I go New York City now.

1284
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,840
Part of my job is to get rid of
undesirables, and there are quite a few.

1285
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,480
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.

1286
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,520
He's been here for 20 years, but he's
been running an after-hour poker game.

1287
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,600
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.

1288
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:44,560
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.

1289
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,680
Yep.

1290
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:50,440
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.

1291
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:55,320
Enrique has been letting people
into the food preparation area.

1292
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,280
That's a major security breach.

1293
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,360
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.

1294
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,440
But I'm going to have to let him go.

1295
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:06,040
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.

1296
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:10,400
But he's wanted for assaulting
a police officer back in India in 1979.

1297
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,920
I'll have to deport him.

1298
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,920
I will go home.

1299
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,360
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- I will go home.

1300
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:22,360
Leave them alone. I will go.

1301
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:24,720
- Today.
- Yes.

1302
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,720
If you don't get on that plane,
they're all gone.

1303
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,560
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1304
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,280
OK. Good.

1305
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,520
Your attention please.

1306
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:40,240
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for
flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.

1307
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,840
I don't believe you.

1308
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,400
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.

1309
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:52,320
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on. I owe you so much.

1310
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:55,280
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.

1311
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:58,240
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.

1312
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:03,640
Gupta.

1313
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:05,240
Goodbye.

1314
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:08,120
You try to fool us.

1315
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:12,600
You make us to think you would walk out,
that you will fight with them.

1316
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:14,320
Why don't you fight?

1317
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:18,920
- The war is over.
- Then go. Get lost.

1318
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,360
Get lost. Go home
and tell them you never made it.

1319
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:27,320
You come this close to America,

1320
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:31,440
but you don't have the courage
to go from here to here.

1321
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:34,560
You are a coward.

1322
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:37,320
The plane is on time.

1323
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,600
You are a coward.

1324
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,640
You are a coward!

1325
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,280
You make me sick!

1326
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:47,640
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.

1327
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:51,480
Got people looking all around,
looking at me like I'm...

1328
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,080
Look at me.

1329
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:57,800
Come on, look at me.

1330
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,400
There's something you should know.

1331
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:11,160
Ladies and gentlemen,
United Airlines Flight 865

1332
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:14,640
from Krakozhia has landed
and is now taxiing to the gate.

1333
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:18,280
For those passengers holding tickets
for Flight 866 to Krakozhia,

1334
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,760
we expect departure
to be on schedule.

1335
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,920
Get back, please.

1336
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:48,600
Gupta.

1337
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,240
Gupta!

1338
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,720
I am going home.

1339
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,000
Get lost.

1340
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,480
Your attention, please.

1341
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:58,440
Flight 866 to Krakozhia
will be delayed until further notice.

1342
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,080
Do you have an appointment?

1343
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:14,040
Somebody tell me
what the hell is going on down there!

1344
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,800
We're right behind you.

1345
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,280
Viktor's leaving.

1346
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:41,960
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know. He's going home.

1347
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:44,440
He's going for the front door,
out to the city.

1348
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:45,960
What?

1349
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,080
Viktor. Remember us.

1350
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:59,680
From the Discovery Store,
I want to give you this.

1351
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:00,880
It's good luck.

1352
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,840
A digital camera for cousin Katia.

1353
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:06,520
I don't know where you're going,
but these will keep your feet warm.

1354
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:17,760
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.

1355
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,280
Secure the door.

1356
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,800
Sorry, Viktor.

1357
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,200
Take him, Judge.

1358
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:41,760
Hold it, Viktor. Take it easy.

1359
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,400
You see those doors?

1360
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,920
Those are the entry doors
to New York City.

1361
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,320
To the United States of America.
Turn around.

1362
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:04,120
It's snowing in the city
and you're going to need that.

1363
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:08,920
Good luck.

1364
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,640
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1365
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,280
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no.

1366
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:15,680
I'm going to miss you.

1367
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:17,960
Try not to get stuck
wherever you're going.

1368
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:19,920
Arrest him! Arrest him!

1369
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,760
Goddammit!

1370
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,200
Taxi!

1371
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:20,840
Thank you.

1372
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,440
Where you go?

1373
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:06,400
161 Lexington. Please take Van Wyck
Expressway to Queensboro Bridge.

1374
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,960
It's faster than BQE.

1375
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:11,320
- Where you from?
- Krakozhia. Viktor Navorski.

1376
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:13,600
I'm Goran. Albania.

1377
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:17,760
- When do you come to New York?
- Thursday.

1378
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:31,600
You want us to block the south exit
and have AP sweep every vehicle?

1379
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:34,480
Sir?

1380
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,600
5.30 from Tokyo just landed.

1381
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:44,640
Got two planes on the tarmac.
Barcelona on approach.

1382
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:48,040
The night is young
and 1500 people are headed our way.

1383
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:53,400
Everybody inside.
Everybody inside.

1384
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,880
Come on, let's go.

1385
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:56,320
Let's go.

1386
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:29,120
- Are you checking in, sir?
- No, no. I don't check in.

1387
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:30,960
I want to go to this place, please.

1388
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,080
The lobby lounge
is around the corner.

1389
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:37,080
They have happy hour specials
and live music. Do you like jazz?

1390
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:39,040
The monitor's off.

1391
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:48,000
The piano's OK. A little more
bass. More bass from the monitor.

1392
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:55,520
Let's do Killer Joe.
It worked all right last night.

1393
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:58,400
- Yes?
- You are Benny Golson?

1394
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,760
Yeah. Yes, I am.

1395
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:06,040
Benny Golson, I am Viktor Navorski.
I am from Krakozhia.

1396
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:11,480
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,
was great, great fan of your music.

1397
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:14,960
A jazz fan. Fantastic.

1398
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:18,240
Would you sign your name, please?

1399
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:22,200
Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.

1400
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:24,000
- Just a minute.
- I will wait.

1401
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,000
OK.

1402
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,800
Taxi! Taxi!

1403
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,640
Where you want to go?

1404
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:58,160
I am going home.

1405
02:56:32,161 --> 02:56:40,161
