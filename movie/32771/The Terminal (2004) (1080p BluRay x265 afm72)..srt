纳沃斯基先生 我有很好的消息要告诉你 So Mr Navorski I have some very good news for you.

505
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,030
什么 What?

506
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,610
我找到了能让你离开机场的办法 I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.

507
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,320
怎么办 How?

508
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,620
我们有些保护外国人的法律 Well we have laws here that protect aliens...

509
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,290
保护那些惧怕返回自己国家的外国人 who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.

510
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,920
如果我们能确定你有这种恐惧 If we can establish this fear with you

511
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,510
海关边境保护局必须使用转移程序 then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures

512
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:27,470
把你的转移到移民法庭 为你的案子申请庇护 to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.

513
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,670
-庇护 -对 庇护 - Asylum? - Mm- hm asylum.

514
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:34,800
不幸的是 法院这类案子已经堆积如山 Unfortunately the courts are so backed up with asylum cases

515
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,810
最快也要六个月才能开庭 that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.

516
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,560
是的 我们别无选择 Yes and we would have no choice...

517
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,010
只能让你这六个月获得自由 but to let you go for those six months.

518
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,860
这是法律 你就自由了 It's the law. You'd be released.

519
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,150
你可以自由待在纽约等待开庭 You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.

520
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,530
不过 信不信由你 很多人再没有出现过 But believe it or not most people never show up before the judge.

521
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,750
我可以去纽约市了 So I go New York City?

522
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,960
你今晚就可以进入纽约 You can go to New York City tonight.

523
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:09,090
不过我们必须确定你有"可靠的恐惧" But you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.

524
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,840
-恐惧 -恐惧 - Fear? - Mm- hm fear.

525
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,420
-恐惧 -恐惧 - Fear. - Fear.

526
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,720
恐惧什么 From what?

527
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,640
你问到点子上了 That's the best part.

528
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,180
你惧怕什么对"山姆大叔"并不重要 It doesn't matter what you're afraid of. It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

529
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,810
所以我要问你一个问题 So I'm going to ask you one question

530
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,220
如果你能给我正确的答案 if you give me the correct answer

531
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,190
我今晚就能让你离开机场 I can get you out of this airport tonight.

你现在是否惧怕返回您的国家 Do you at this time have any fear of returning to your own country?

539
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,620
不 No.

540
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,390
我们重新来一次 OK. Let me try it again.

543
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,400
-是的 很可怕 -是啊 很恐怖 - Yes. It's terrible. - Yeah it's horrible.

544
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,650
天晓得以后会这么样 And God only knows what could happen.

545
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,360
无辜的人们背井离乡 Innocent people are torn from their beds.

546
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,320
在星期二 我讨厌星期二 On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.

547
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,490

00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:54,530

722
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:57,030

是的 谢尔 Yeah. Cher.

734
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,350
我调查过了 有目击者的 I checked it out. There were witnesses.

735
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,770
是谢尔的内裤 Those are Cher's panties.

736
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,560

739
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,440
-来吧 -等等 - Come on. - Wait a second.

740
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:40,030
联合航空公司飞往 成田机场的801航班 United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita

741
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:42,250
马上就要起飞了 is now announcing final boarding.

742
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:45,880
"不行 这是我的" "You can't. That is mine."

743
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,540
"你会很烦恼的" "You can get so confused."

744
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,050
维克多 Viktor?

745
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,510
嗨 Well hi.

746
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:55,850

-最近怎么样 -很好 - How are you? - Good.

748
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,900
伙计 Man.

749
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:04,730
上次那样约你出去 我真的很抱歉 I am so sorry about what happened last time asking you out like that.

750
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,740
所有男人就算在3000尺的高空 都会设法摸我的屁股 I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30000 feet

751
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,070
当我真正遇到一个没这种想法的人时 that when I meet somebody that doesn't

752
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,160
我却不知道该如何面对了 I don't know how to react.

753
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,490
-让我们先不聊这个了 -好的 - Let's just start over. - Yes OK.

754
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,200
-你是离开还是回来 -我也不知道 都是吧 - Are you coming or going? - I don't know. Both.

755
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,250
那是什么意思 和我说说吧 Tell me about it.

756
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,000
拿破仑 Napoleon?

757
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,610
是啊 我读过很多历史小说 Yeah. I read a lot of history books.

758
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,050
都是价廉物美的书 不过内容都是杀来杀去 They're long and cheap.

759
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,260
像这1200页只要9.99美元 这个价钱太诱惑人了 Like 1200 pages for $9.99. You can't beat that.

760
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:33,930
-但是这个 拿破仑 -是啊 关于他的书是我的最爱 - But Napoleon? - Yeah. He's one of my favourites.

761
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:37,470
-你知道是什么拯救了拿破仑的命吗 -不知道 - You know what saved Napoleon's life? - No.

762
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,930
-他的自负 -自负 - His ego. - Ego?

763
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,060
是的 Yes.

764
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,480
在他经历了滑铁卢惨败之后 After he loses the Battle of Waterloo

765
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,690
拿破仑把自己单独留在一个小小的圣海伦娜岛上 Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.

766
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,320
确切的来说没有人知道后来发生了什么 No one knows exactly what happens next

767
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,700
不过我比较喜欢的一个版本是这样说的 but the version I like goes like this:

768
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:56,240
他十分沮丧 并且准备结束自己的生命 He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.

769
01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:01,040
但是拿破仑相信他自己 具有超于常人的体质 But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength

770
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:05,050
所以他服用了6倍于常人剂量的毒药 that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.

771
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:09,720
他的胃里塞满了毒药 他的身体产生排斥作用 His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it

772
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,730
他于是死里逃生 and he doesn't die.

773
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:15,110
明白吗 自负 救了他的命 See? Ego. Saved his life.

774
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,440
或许他需要一副眼镜 Maybe he need glasses.

775
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,320
-眼镜 -是的 这样就可以看清药瓶上写的字 - Glasses? - Yes. To read words on bottle.

776
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,400
毒药 Poison.

777
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,580
你这个说法真的很有趣 It's funny you should say that.

778
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,370
有谣传说拿破仑的确是远视眼 Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.

779
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:31,120
-你说得不错 -说得不错 - There you go. - There you go.

780
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,960
-说得不错 -你说得不错 - There you go. - And there you go.

781
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
维克多我认为我们正在这里改写历史 I think we're rewriting history right here.

782
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,050
为什么我们不边吃午餐边谈这个 Why don't we talk about it over lunch?

783
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:43,120
上帝 不敢相信我又这样随便约你了 Oh my God I can't believe it. I just asked you out again.

784
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,250
我又这样做了 I just did it again.

785
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,630
看来我 最好离我远点 维克多 好吗 I'm so... Just stay away from me Viktor OK?

786
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,550
我有病 我简直无法 单独活着超过5秒钟 I'm sick. I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.

787
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,630
好的 OK.

788
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,350
-什么好的 -好的 - OK what? - OK.

789
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:00,470
和你共进午餐 Lunch... with you.

790
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,850
-你会和我一起吃午餐 -是的 - You'll have lunch with me? - Yes.

791
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,650
你不用搭飞机吗或者... You're not running for a flight or...?

792
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,110
我可以等 I wait.

793
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,070
-是我的 -你的 是的 - It's me. - You. Yes.

794
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:16,620
我很抱歉 我刚刚收到信息 I'm sorry. I just got paged.

795
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,330
你要去工作 You work?

796
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,250
不是的 - No. - Ah.

797
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,170
就是你们3个人 互相挤在一起 Three of you. Crowded.

798
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,550
最好离我远点 维克多 Stay away from me Viktor.

799
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,130
我 我有个很严重的问题 I'm... I have a serious problem.

800
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:31,560
我和拿破仑一样不太健康 I'm as bad as Napoleon.

801
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,350
我不停的在吸取那些"有毒"的男人 I just keep ingesting these poisonous men...

802
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,890
直到让我自己不可救药 until I make myself sick.

803
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,860
-你没病 阿米莉亚 没有 -没有 - You're not sick Amelia. No. - No?

804
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,280
没有 你只是有点"远视"而已 No. You're a little... farsighted.

805
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,410
-我得走了 -我得留下 - I have to go. - I have to stay.

806
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:51,700
-这就是我的生活 -我也一样 - Story of my life. - Me too.

807
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:10,600
边境保护局视察员 将在3天以内到达 Your CBP inspection's in three days.

808
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,600
FBI和国家安全局将会巡视机场 The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport

809
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,690
在和你谈话以前 他们将花2小时视察这些办公室 spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.

810
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,400
纳沃斯基到底挣多少 How much does Navorski make?

811
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,030
先生 Sir?

812
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,780
他到底挣多少 他们到底付多少钱给他 How much does he make? How much are they paying him?

813
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,870
他们偷偷地付给他现金 They're paying him cash under the table.

814
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,200
这我知道 到底有多少 I know that. How much?

815
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,330
每小时19美元 $19 an hour.

816
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:40,540
难以置信 你知道吗 他比我挣的还要多 Unbelievable. Do you know that's more than I make?

817
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,760
那就是纽约城市建设公司的薪酬 That's New York City construction.

818
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:46,600
几天前 我的一个手下来找我 One of my own men came up to me the other day.

819
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,390
问我要不要也去赌一把 Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.

820
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,940
你看看他 Look at him.

821
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:54,360
赌在什么时候纳沃斯基会离开这个机场 Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.

822
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,440
你听说了这事没有 Have you heard about this?

823
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,320
我赌他留到一月三日 I have January 3rd.

824
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,910
把他带进来 Bring him in.

825
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:10,620
杰克 他没有国籍 懂吗 没有国家 Jake he has no nationality. OK? No country.

826
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:15,630
从我们章程的第2章12节的解释 他对国家是个安全隐患 He's a national security risk according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.

827
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:19,670
我想要你把他关进拘留中心 对他进行一次全面审察 I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.

828
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,720
我只要这样就够了 That's all I want.

829
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:25,390
那么联邦监狱可以吗 What about a federal prison?

830
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,560
要么另外一个机场也行 What about another airport?

831
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,100
喂 喂 Hello? Hello?

832
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:39,030
我们已经拘留了太多的人 到处都是人满为患 We're detaining so many people there's no room anywhere.

833
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,130
你试过联系FBI了吗 Did you try the FBI?

834
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:44,110
谁我都试了 没人想要接手他 I tried everybody. Nobody'll take him.

835
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,690
你想要我把他带回候机室吗 You want me to bring him back to the terminal?

836
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:50,320
不用了 从现在起 纳沃斯基就住在这里 No. From now on Navorski lives here.

837
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:06,010
今天来这里的这些人 是来观察我 审查我的 The people who are coming here today will be observing me inspecting me.

838
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:10,680
但是他们大部分人都会 留心这个机场各个运行环节 But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.

839
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:15,980
所以 让我们展示给他们 什么是全美第一的机场 So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.

840
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:19,480
我们每天大约要处理600次航班 We process about 600 planes a day

841
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:22,240
平均每37分钟一班飞机 with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane

842
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,280
每60秒运送一位乘客 about 60 seconds per passenger...

843
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,950
进入这个国家 to be brought into the country.

844
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:30,450
我们尽力保证完善的检查 We keep it as clean as possible.

845
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:32,830
-你带什么入关 -电脑软件 - What do you import? - Computer software.

846
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,420
真是很多胡桃啊 That's a lot of walnuts.

847
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,630
是啊 我的岳母十分 喜欢这些东西 Yeah. My mother-in-law loves these things.

848
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:40,380
每次我去巴西以后 都要给她带一袋回来 Every time I go to Brazil I bring her back a bag.

849
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:43,220

852
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,770
如果他结了婚的话 为什么他没戴结婚戒指 If he's married where's his ring?

853
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:03,190
如果他是离了婚的人 谁还会理会他的岳母呢 And if he's divorced who still talks to their mother-in-law?

854
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,530
很抱歉 但是真的 我无意冒犯别人的岳母 不过 I'm sorry but really. No offence to mother-in-law but...

858
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,210
从多伦多来的912航班降落后 When the 9.12 from Toronto landed

859
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,500
他们发现了4瓶没有检验过的药物 They found four prescriptions without an MPL.

860
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,220
他们准备把这些药扣留 这个人就发了狂 They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.

861
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,980

876
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,440
这家伙现在十分生气 This guy's very upset.

他说这些药是为他父亲买的 He say he bring the medicine for his father.

没有人告诉他需要什么文书 No one say to him he need document form.

我不是在告诉他吗 I'm saying it to him.

01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:08,280
他需要当地给他父亲进行治疗的医院所签署的申请表 He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.

897

它们必须扣留在这里 They have to stay here.

915
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:51,000

949
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:07,490
把你关上5年 to keep you there for five years?

950
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:10,950
你和我作对就是和美国为敌 You go to war with me and you go to war with the United States.

951
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,960

我只是按规矩办事罢了 I was just following the rules.

966
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:46,470
有时候你必须把规矩放到一边 人才是最重要的 Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.

967
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:47,720

1151
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:54,160

人 文件 还有故事 The person the document and the story.

1166
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:58,520
只要找到其中一样的真相 你就找到了所有三样的真相 Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.

1167
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,910
我需要你的帮助来找出真相 I need your help finding the truth.

01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,890
那又怎么样 So?

1174
01:34:21,930 --> 01:34:23,930
你认为那是什么 What do you make of that?

1175
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:27,940
我猜那是花生酱 I'd make peanut butter I guess.

1176
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:34,030

为什么选维克多·纳沃斯基 Why Viktor Navorski?

1188
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:14,240
你这种人是永远理解不了的 That's something a guy like you could never understand.

1189
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:42,270
我猜你又错过你的航班了 或者你选的旅行社太差 I guess you missed your flight again. Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
