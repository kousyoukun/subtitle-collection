1
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:43,110
Head cocked to the left..
Partial deafness in ear.

2
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,210
First point of attack.

3
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:50,213
Two. Throat. Paralyze vocal cords.
Stop screaming.

4
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:53,713
Three. Got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.

5
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:58,063
Four. Finally, drag the
left leg. Fist the patella.

6
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,424
Summary prognosis:
Conscious in 90 seconds.

7
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:02,402
Martial efficacy: quarter of an hour at best.

8
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:05,477
Full faculty of recovery: unlikely.

9
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:21,586
I like the hat.
- Oh...I just picked it up.

10
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,334
Did you remember your revolver?

11
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:25,349
Knew I forgot something.

12
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:29,019
Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

13
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:32,627
I think that's quite enough.

14
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:35,022
You're a doctor, after all.

15
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,603
Always nice to see you,
Watson.

16
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:46,684
Where's the inspector?

17
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:49,124
Getting his troops lined up.

18
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:51,281
That could be all day.

19
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,154
Sherlock Holmes.

20
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
And his loyal dog.

21
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,931
Tell me, doctor.

22
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:59,307
As a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

23
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:02,171
Let me show you how much I've enjoyed it.

24
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:04,271
Watson. Don't.

25
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:10,115
Observe.

26
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,773
How did you see that?

27
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:17,502
Because I was looking for it.

28
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,254
Lord Blackwood.

29
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,968
You seem surprised.

30
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:30,032
I'd say the girl deserves your
attention more than he.

31
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:32,132
Indeed.

32
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,343
Oh, I'd leave that alone if I were you, boyo.

33
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,443
Good lad.

34
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:44,772
Impeccable timing,
Lestrade.

35
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:49,307
We've one for the doctor...
and one for the rope.

36
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:50,898
Clarky.
- Sir?

37
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:53,054
This woman needs a hospital immediately.

38
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:56,362
Put her in the back of the Maria.
- Right, lads. That's it.

39
00:05:56,462 --> 00:06:00,681
Pick him up lads.

40
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,434
If you don't mind.

41
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:08,021
Get him out of my sight.

42
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,718
And you were supposed
to wait for my orders.

43
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:18,601
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse.

44
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,352
and chasing a rumor.

45
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:23,463
Besides, the girl's parents
hired me, not the Yard.

46
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:26,539
Why they thought you would
require any assistance is beyond me.

47
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,407
Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.
- Indeed.

48
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,917
Congratulations, Lestrade.
- Bravo, Inspector.

49
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,543
Have a cigar.

50
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:35,977
Gentlemen...

51
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:38,077
Cheese.

52
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:15,591
156 over 80.

53
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,176
Very good.

54
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:20,754
Me nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

55
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:22,429
Tell me something:

56
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,977
Your new premises...
when are you moving in?

57
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,060
I should be in within the week.

58
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Cavendish Place.

59
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:31,871
And there will be a woman's touch too.

60
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:34,606
Well, that's marvelous, indeed.

61
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:36,984
Good God.

62
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,285
That was gunfire.
- No no.

63
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,133
Hammer on nail, wasn't it?

64
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,575
My colleague, probably just...
putting up a painting.

65
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,675
I'll go and check.

66
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:50,984
Your colleague?
- Yes.

67
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,760
He won't be moving with you, will he?

68
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,860
No, he won't.

69
00:07:58,643 --> 00:07:59,888
Mrs. Hudson...

70
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:02,952
I won't go in there by myself.
Not while he's got a gun in his hand.

71
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:05,298
You don't have to go in there at all.
Give me the paper.

72
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:06,833
What will I do when you leave, Doctor?

73
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,179
He'll have the whole house down.

74
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,111
He just needs another case,
that's all.

75
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:12,484
Could you have a longer engagement?

76
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,358
I smell gunpowder. This
is not right you know.

77
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,249
Not in a domestic environment.

78
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:19,393
Thank you, Captain Phillip.

79
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:21,476
Perhaps a nice cup of tea...

80
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,576
Same time next week.

81
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,737
Come along, Captain.
It's quiet downstairs.

82
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:29,577
Mrs. Hudson?
Bring something to cheer him up.

83
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:41,086
Permission to enter the armory.

84
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,310
Granted.

85
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:48,022
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device...

86
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:51,862
...that supresses the sound, of a gunshot.

87
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:55,604
It's not working.

88
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,902
Can I see that?

89
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:09,901
You know it's been three months
since your last case?

90
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:16,684
Gently. Gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...Argh !

91
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:21,994
Don't you think it's time you found another one.

92
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:24,338
I can't but agree.

93
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:28,155
My mind embellishes, technician,
giving me problems, giving me work.

94
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:30,255
The sooner the better.

95
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:32,281
Paper.

96
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:36,692
Let's see then.
There's a letter here from...

97
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:38,101
Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.

98
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:40,280
Her husband's disappeared.

99
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,964
He's in Belgium, with the scullery maid.

100
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:44,933
Is it November?

101
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,033
Yes, Holmes.
Alright..

102
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:49,454
Lady Radford reports...

103
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,889
...oh, her emerald
bracelet has disappeared.

104
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:54,188
Insurance swindle..

105
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:58,113
Lord Radford likes fast women
and slow ponies.

106
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,094
Ahh, I see you're the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging.

107
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:02,249
Yes.

108
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:03,402
It was our last case together...

109
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,327
...and I wanted to see it through to the end.

110
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,065
A Mr. Louis is seeking the ad...

111
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:17,480
There's only one case
that intrigues me at present.

112
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,419
The curious case of Mrs Hudson.

113
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,519
The absentee landlady.

114
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,701
I've been studying her comings and goings.

115
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:27,841
they appear most...sinister.
- Tea, Mr. Holmes?

116
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:29,719
Is it poisoned, 'nanny'?

117
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,763
There's enough of that in you already.

118
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:34,505
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place.

119
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:36,802
As per usual, 'nanny'.

120
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,735
Oop. He's killed the dog...
again.

121
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:43,048
What have you done to Gladstone,
now?

122
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:45,190
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.

123
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,290
He doesn't mind.

124
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,081
Holmes...

125
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,349
...as your doctor...

126
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:53,847
He'll be straight as a trivet in no time.

127
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:54,947
As your friend.

128
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,219
You've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

129
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,950
There is nothing of interest,
for me, out there on Earth.

130
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,309
At all.

131
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,498
So, you're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

132
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:09,912
Dinner?
- Wonderful.

133
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,646
The Royale?
- My favorite.

134
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:13,746
Mary's coming.

135
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:17,949
Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes.

136
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,812
Have you proposed yet?

137
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,354
No, I haven't found the right ring.

138
00:11:22,454 --> 00:11:24,180
Oh well then it's not official.

139
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,619
It's happening, whether you like it or not.

140
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,887
8:30, the Royale...wear a jacket...

141
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,987
You wear a jacket.

142
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:55,393
Straighten your tie.

143
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:08,036
Holmes.
- Hmm?

144
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:10,871
You're early.

145
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:13,280
Fashionably.

146
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,236
Miss Mary Morsten.

147
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:18,226
Ahh, my goodness. What a pleasure.

148
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,251
For the life of me I don't
know why it has taken him so long

149
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,878
to intoduce us properly.

150
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,978
The pleasure is mine.

151
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:31,401
It's really is quite a thrill to
meet you, Mr. Holmes.

152
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,966
I've heard so much about you.

153
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:37,317
I have a pile of detective novels
at home: of Collins, Poe...

154
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:38,716
It's true.

155
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:40,400
It can seem a little farfetched
though at some times...

156
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,978
...making these grand assumptions
out of such tiny details.

157
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,255
That's not quite right, is it?

158
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:51,200
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

159
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,695
Take Watson...
- I intend to.

160
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,698
See his walking stick of rare
African snakewood?

161
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:03,943
Hiding a blade of high tensile steel.

162
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,854
A few were rewarded to veterans
of the Afghan War.

163
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,335
so I can assume he is a decorated soldier.

164
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:12,809
Strong, brave, brave
born to be a man of action.

165
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,781
and neat,
like all military men.

166
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,082
Now, I check his pockets.

167
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,162
Ahh. A stub from a boxing match.

168
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:23,878
Now, I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.

169
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:25,804
I 'd keep an eye on that dowry if I were you.

170
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,314
Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

171
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:30,688
It's cost us the rent more than once.

172
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:34,202
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
You know John very well.

173
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:36,937
What about a complete stranger?

174
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:38,858
What can you tell about me?

175
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,253
You?
- I don't think that's...

176
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,738
I don't know that that's...
- Not at dinner.

177
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:43,258
Perhaps another time.
- I insist.

178
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:44,754
You insist?
- Do you remember we discussed this>.

179
00:13:44,854 --> 00:13:46,854
The lady insists.

180
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:54,961
You are a governess.
- Well done.

181
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,318
Yes, well done.
Should we... Waiter.

182
00:13:57,418 --> 00:14:00,393
Your student...
It's a boy of eight.

183
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:03,166
Charlie is seven, actually.

184
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:07,417
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

185
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:10,803
Is there ink on my face?
- There is nothing wrong with your face.

186
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:12,888
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.

187
00:14:12,988 --> 00:14:15,272
India blue is nearly impossible to wash off.

188
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:17,262
Anyway, a very impetuous act by the boy,

189
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,664
but you are too experienced to act rashly,
which is why...

190
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:22,522
...the lady for whom you work
lent you that necklace.

191
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:25,555
Pearls, diamonds, flawless ruby, hardly...

192
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,950
...the gems of a governess.

193
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,761
However, that jewels you are not wearing
tells us rather more...

194
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:35,071
Holmes.
- You were engaged.

195
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,623
The ring has gone, but the lighter
skin where it once sat, suggests...

196
00:14:38,723 --> 00:14:40,780
...you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly...

197
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,169
...that is, until you were informed
of its true and rather modest worth,

198
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:45,168
at which point you broke off the
engagement and returned to England...

199
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:48,164
for better prospects...

200
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:50,264
A doctor, perhaps?

201
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,315
Right on all counts
Mr. Holmes, apart from one.

202
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,733
I didn't leave him.

203
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:06,982
He died.

204
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,550
Well done, old boy.

205
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:47,090
Stand up and fight.

206
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,542
Come on.

207
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:54,506
Get up.

208
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,718
That's it, big man.
We're done.

209
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:08,198
You've won. Congratulations.

210
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:10,641
Oi. We ain't done yet.

211
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:12,955
(spits)

212
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,149
This mustn't register on an emotional level.

213
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:21,394
First, distract target.

214
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:24,557
Then block his blind jab.

215
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,171
Counter with cross to left cheek.

216
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:29,435
Discombobulate.

217
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:34,723
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.
Employ elbow block and body shot.

218
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:38,176
Block feral left.

219
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:40,276
Weaken right jaw.

220
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,055
Now fracture.

221
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,463
Break cracked ribs.

222
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:48,691
Traumamatize solar plexus.

223
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,767
Dislocate jaw entirely.

224
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,644
Heel kick to diaphragm.

225
00:17:57,238 --> 00:17:58,911
In summary: ears ringing,

226
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,678
jaw fractured, three ribs
cracked, four broken,

227
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,827
diaphragm hemorrhaging.

228
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:05,139
Physical recovery: 6 weeks.

229
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,651
Full psychological recovery: 6 months.

230
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:09,386
Capacity to spit at back of head...

231
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:11,486
Neutralized.

232
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:42,059
Where did that come from?

233
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:23,237
What the hell is going on here, Charley?

234
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:25,534
Lord Blackwood put him under
some kind of spell, sir.

235
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:29,374
It's like he's burning from the inside out.

236
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:34,382
Shut up.

237
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:36,376
Charley. Charley.

238
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:39,451
Take this man to the infirmary.
Now.

239
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:54,189
What's this all about then, Blackwood?

240
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:59,993
There's someone I want to see.

241
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:22,265
Watson?
- Right.

242
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:24,642
Let's go.

243
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:26,756
What started merely as an experiment...

244
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:29,893
...has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

245
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:32,968
Now, If I play a chromatic scale...

246
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:35,386
...there's no measurable response.

247
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:38,395
You do know what you're drinking
is meant for eye surgery?

248
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:40,022
But... now,

249
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,427
and this is remarkable...

250
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:44,417
...if I change to atonal clusters.

251
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:47,458
Voila.

252
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:49,044
They fly in counter-clockwise...

253
00:20:49,144 --> 00:20:50,759
...synchronized concentric circles.

254
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:52,870
As though a regimented flock.

255
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,983
Watson, this is exceptional.

256
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:58,673
I, using musical theory,
have created order from chaos.

257
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,312
How do you lure them in?

258
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:03,811
Excellent question.

259
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:07,566
Individually.
I've been at it for six hours.

260
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:10,166
And what happens if I do this?

261
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:14,938
Right.
- Clean yourself up.

262
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:17,843
You are Blackwood's last request.

263
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,191
Look at those towering structures.

264
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,900
It's the first combination of Bascule's
suspension bridge ever attempted.

265
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Most innovative.

266
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:42,880
What an industrious empire.

267
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,465
Oh, I have your winnings from last night.

268
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:52,632
You weren't there,
so I made your customary bet.

269
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:55,013
You're right.
I'll keep it with your checkbook,

270
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,833
locked safely away in my drawer.

271
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:02,071
Did you know that the opera house
is featuring 'Don Giovanni'?

272
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:03,997
I could easily have procured
a couple of tickets.

273
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:08,347
If you have any cultural
inclinations this evening.

274
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:11,926
You have a grand gift of silence, Watson.

275
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:15,936
It makes you quite
invaluable as a companion.

276
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,909
I knew she'd been engaged.

277
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:21,636
She told me.

278
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:24,456
So that's no to the opera, then.

279
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:30,798
That was my waistcoat.

280
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:32,876
I thought we agreed that
it's too small for you.

281
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,661
I would like it back.
- I thought we agreed.

282
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:36,761
I want it back.

283
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:11,293
This way, Mr. Holmes.

284
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:16,232
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd in something of a fear frenzy.

285
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:19,853
Well, I'm certain it will disperse
once his feet have stopped twitching.

286
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:21,492
Care to come along?

287
00:23:21,592 --> 00:23:22,885
No, you are on your own, old cock.

288
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,919
I've no business with him
whilst he's alive.

289
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:27,399
Suit yourself, 'mother hen'.

290
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:42,576
It seems that you have lots of rooms to let.

291
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:44,465
We had to move the prisoners,
sir.

292
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:46,389
Otherwise we would
have a riot on our hands.

293
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:50,824
He has a peculiar effect
on the inmates as though...

294
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:55,574
...he can get inside their heads.

295
00:23:58,024 --> 00:24:01,518
I'm sure I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

296
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:04,423
Much obliged, sir.
Thank you, sir.

297
00:24:05,021 --> 00:24:12,684
And I stood upon the sand of the sea,
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea,...

298
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,302
...having seven heads and ten horns,
and upon his horns ten crowns,

299
00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:17,239
and upon his heads
the name of blasphemy,

300
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:18,708
and they worshipped the dragon
which gave power unto the beast...

301
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:19,989
...and they worshipped the beast, saying,

302
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:21,429
Who is like unto the beast?...

303
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,133
...the beast which I just saw
had the body of a leopard,...

304
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:26,173
...but had feet of a bear
and the mouth was the mouth of a lion.

305
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:30,146
and dragon gave him his power
and his seat and great authority.

306
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:33,561
I love what you've done with the place.

307
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:36,884
So glad you could accept my invitation.

308
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:40,129
I have just a small point of concern.

309
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:41,401
How can I help?

310
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:43,350
I've already followed the murders
with some interest.

311
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,747
And while my heart went out
primarily to the families of the victims.

312
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:48,040
I can not but notice the criminal mastery...

313
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,529
...in the stroke of your brush.

314
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:51,713
You are too kind.

315
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:54,041
However, by comparison,
your work in the crypt...

316
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:57,371
...was more akin to a finger painting.

317
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:03,042
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a logicum afoot?

318
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:05,142
Either that or...

319
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,406
Shortly my friend will
pronounce you dead...

320
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,669
...and I'm thought I may keep him company.

321
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,563
Your mistake is to imagine...

322
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:14,574
...that anything earthly
led us to this moment.

323
00:25:14,674 --> 00:25:16,846
Your error in judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

324
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:19,489
I'm merely the channel.

325
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:22,047
well my only wish was that
I could have caught you sooner.

326
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:25,037
You see, five lives might have been spared.

327
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:29,010
Those lives were a necessity.

328
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:31,602
Sacrifice.

329
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:34,883
Five otherwise meaningless creatures
called to serve a higher purpose.

330
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:37,611
I wonder if they'd let Watson
and me dissect your brain?

331
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,921
After you hang, of course.

332
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:44,850
I'd wager there's some deformity
that would be scientifically significant.

333
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,520
Then you too could serve
a greater purpose.

334
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:52,113
Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

335
00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:57,655
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

336
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,850
You and I are bound together
on a journey that...

337
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,538
...will twist together
the very fabric of nature.

338
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:07,949
But beneath your mask of logic
I sense a fragility...

339
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:10,049
...that worries me.

340
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:12,808
Steel your mind, Holmes.

341
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:15,478
I need you.

342
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:18,231
I say, you've come a long way
down from the House of Lords.

343
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:19,702
I will rise again.
- 'Bon voyage'.

344
00:26:19,802 --> 00:26:21,241
Pay attention.

345
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:24,852
Three more will die and there is nothing
you can do to save them.

346
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:28,057
You must accept that this
is beyond your control.

347
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:31,807
For by the time you realize
you made all of this possible...

348
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:36,072
...it'll be the last
sane thought in your head.

349
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:44,497
What did he want?

350
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:46,092
Not sure.

351
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:50,867
But I dont think you're needed
Father. Not for this one.

352
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:55,285
Lord Henry Blackwood,
you are sentenced to death...

353
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:57,751
...for the practice of black magic,

354
00:26:57,851 --> 00:27:00,162
the unholy murder of
five innocent young women,

355
00:27:00,262 --> 00:27:03,772
and attempted murder of a sixth.

356
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:06,778
Do you have any final words?

357
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:11,509
Death... is only the beginning.

358
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,740
Forever and ever.....Amen.

359
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:50,061
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

360
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:14,779
London is so bleak this time of year.

361
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:18,111
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

362
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:21,174
Much prefer to travel in the winter.

363
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:26,723
Here, I brought you these.
All the way from Syria.

364
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:29,565
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

365
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:31,665
...and your favorite...

366
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:34,308
...olives from the Cyclades.

367
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:36,679
I thought we might have a little tea party...

368
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,518
...and while I was setting the table,
I found this.

369
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,828
a file with my name on it.

370
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:46,957
'The theft of Velasquez'
portrait of the King of Spain.

371
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:48,387
'and missing naval documents...

372
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:50,707
...lead to the resignation of
Bulgarian Prime Minister...

373
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,679
Scandalous affair ends engagement of...'

374
00:28:56,934 --> 00:29:02,873
'perhaps book prints to
Romanov princess.'

375
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:05,801
I'm simply studying your methods.

376
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,513
Should the authorities should
ask me to hunt you down.

377
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:11,980
But I don't see my name in
any of these articles.

378
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,545
But your signature was clear.

379
00:29:15,544 --> 00:29:18,859
Is that the Maharaja's missing diamond?

380
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:21,022
Or just another souvenir?

381
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:23,753
Let's not dwell on the past.

382
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:26,831
Shall we?

383
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,186
Now, by the look of things,
I'd say you were between jobs.

384
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:33,011
And you between husbands.

385
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:34,299
How much did you give for the ring?

386
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,544
He was boring, jealous,
and he snored.

387
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:42,879
I'm Irene Adler again.

388
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:45,231
...fart...

389
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,719
...(dog grunts).

390
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:52,568
Thank you.

391
00:29:58,342 --> 00:30:00,342
I need your help.

392
00:30:00,616 --> 00:30:02,911
I need you to find someone.

393
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:06,581
Why are you always so suspicious?

394
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:09,595
Should i answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

395
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:14,030
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

396
00:30:16,696 --> 00:30:20,320
I think you will find all the
information you need inside.

397
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,460
Who are you working for?

398
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:27,174
So, I'll have to find out the hard way.

399
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,901
Keep your money,
I didn't say that I'd take the case.

400
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:32,316
Well consider it a wager that you will.

401
00:30:33,045 --> 00:30:34,875
Do you remember the Grand?

402
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:37,185
They gave me our old room.

403
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:53,641
Hold the door.
Thanks, doctor.

404
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:18,944
Ma'am.

405
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:25,137
He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

406
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:29,062
That's precisely why I hired you.

407
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,236
I'll wager he will have our man
within the next 24 hours.

408
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:33,898
He'd better.

409
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:37,112
Riordan is the key to what
Blackwood was doing.

410
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:39,422
He's essential to my plan.

411
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:44,771
What's she doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

412
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:46,348
Get off out of here.

413
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:50,393
A little rye for Ray
should go a long way, sir.

414
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:53,978
Rubbing me callouses off this German back.

415
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,527
God save the queen.

416
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:57,459
God save the Queen, sir.

417
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,559
Get off out of here.

418
00:32:03,644 --> 00:32:05,644
Look at you.

419
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:07,063
The only woman you ever cared about...

420
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:08,497
...a world class criminal.

421
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:09,573
Are you a masochist?

422
00:32:09,673 --> 00:32:10,854
Allow me to explain...

423
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:11,876
Allow me.

424
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:15,852
She is the only adversary who
ever outsmarted you... twice.

425
00:32:15,952 --> 00:32:17,617
Made a proper idiot out of you.

426
00:32:17,717 --> 00:32:18,856
Right. You've had your fun.

427
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:21,400
What's she after, anyway?
- Time to press on.

428
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,369
What could she possibly need?

429
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:24,736
It doesn't matter.
Alibi...?

430
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:27,442
A beard.
A human canoe.

431
00:32:27,848 --> 00:32:30,685
She could sit on her back
and paddle you up the Thames.

432
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:33,656
Well, that's no consequence to you really
is it Watson?

433
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:35,233
We've done our last case together.

434
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,333
I've already read it.

435
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:39,498
Missing person.

436
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:40,779
Luke Riordan.

437
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:44,437
4 foot ten, red hair, no front teeth.
Case solved.

438
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:46,268
You're obviously not her type.

439
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:47,656
She likes ginger dwarfs.

440
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:48,706
Midgets.

441
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:50,930
So, you agree.
- No, I don't agree.

442
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,580
It's more than a technicality.

443
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:56,868
You are misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

444
00:32:56,968 --> 00:32:58,552
I've said too much.
I can tell. I've upset you.

445
00:32:58,652 --> 00:33:00,426
No, I'm just stating that one has...

446
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:02,113
What were you doing?

447
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:06,293
Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

448
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:31,146
Holmes? What are you doing?
- Nothing.

449
00:33:31,246 --> 00:33:33,118
Are you wearing a false.....
- A false nose? No.

450
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:36,204
Tell me, that that wasn't.... what.

451
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:39,795
Holmes. Where you going?

452
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:46,515
Watson?

453
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,891
Help. Watson.

454
00:34:08,488 --> 00:34:10,349
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.

455
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,509
Cut you a deal cos you're so pretty.

456
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:16,113
Oh, my lucky day.

457
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:20,473
'Ello gorgeous, you got somethin for me?

458
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:25,606
Don't move.

459
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:31,139
Now what have we got here?
ohh!

460
00:34:35,828 --> 00:34:37,828
Thank you.

461
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:40,317
That's the Irene I knew.

462
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:35,030
This plan intrigues me me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

463
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,470
Which is no mean feat.

464
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,999
She's intimidated she's scared of him.

465
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,900
Yet she works for him.

466
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,200
Right.

467
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,987
It's nothing to do with me, but I'd advise
you to leave the case alone.

468
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:49,406
Well, I may not have a choice. Hmm?

469
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:52,056
After all, I may be paying
the rent on my own...

470
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:53,190
...soon, thanks to you.

471
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,380
Get that out of my face.

472
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,972
It's not in your face.
It's in my hand.

473
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,220
Get what is in your hand out of my face.

474
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,448
Mr. Holmes.
- Clarky.

475
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,993
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that you
come with me at once.

476
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,931
What's he done now?
Lost his way to Scotland Yard?

477
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:07,245
Watson, grab a compass.
You means us.

478
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:08,815
No, you means you.

479
00:36:08,915 --> 00:36:11,348
It's about Lord Blackwood,
sir. He...

480
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:15,471
It appears he's come
back from the grave, sir.

481
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:27,164
Most engaging.
- Very clever.

482
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,069
I pronounced the man dead myself.

483
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,484
What are the facts?

484
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:34,429
Groundskeeper claims he saw him walking...

485
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:36,510
...through the graveyard
just this morning, sir.

486
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,418
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

487
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:41,165
I have an appointment with Mary.

488
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,266
It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

489
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:45,603
Don't try that.

490
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,462
Have the newspapers got wind of it yet?
Well, that's what we're trying to avoid, sir.

491
00:36:48,562 --> 00:36:50,562
Certainly.

492
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:51,459
What's the major concern?

493
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,583
Panic. Sheer, bloody panic, sir.

494
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,093
Indeed.

495
00:36:56,193 --> 00:36:57,782
You're not taking this seriously,
are you Holmes?

496
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,958
Yes.
As you should.

497
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:03,440
It's a matter of professional integrity.

498
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:09,490
No girl wants to marry a doctor who
can't tell if a man is dead or not.

499
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,050
Who do you think won the match,
Clarky?

500
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,150
Sir?
- The rugby match.

501
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:33,174
Your boys have done a magnificent job
of obliterating any potential evidence.

502
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:35,675
Yes, but at least they never
miss an opportunity...

503
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,985
...to miss an opportunity.

504
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:41,655
You took your time, Holmes.

505
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:44,327
And on the third day...

506
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,499
These slabs were sandstone,
half a ton each, if they're a pound,

507
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,587
and they're smashed open from the inside.

508
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,152
Lestrade. What of the coffin?

509
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,228
We are in the process of bringing it up now.

510
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,419
I see. Hmpf.

511
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,556
Right.

512
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:05,311
At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

513
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:08,359
Anyhow, where is our witness?

514
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:09,835
He's over there.

515
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:13,578
And apparently he's cata..
cat...

516
00:38:13,678 --> 00:38:15,678
Catatonic, sir.

517
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,640
He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.

518
00:38:20,252 --> 00:38:21,813
Now if you lot don't stop
behaving like a bunch...

519
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:23,345
...of quivering milkmaids
you're on double time.

520
00:38:24,246 --> 00:38:29,045
Now you get down there and
you bring that coffin up, now... sorry sir.

521
00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:29,458
Now.

522
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,598
Good day, sir.
- hello...

523
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,757
It's all right.

524
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,870
I'm a doctor.

525
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:49,306
The man's in shock.

526
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:51,835
He may need a few moments.

527
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:55,190
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

528
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,290
Well?
- Well?

529
00:38:57,557 --> 00:38:59,597
You pronounced him dead.

530
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:02,199
He had no pulse.

531
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,316
Hmm.
- Good lord.

532
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:28,466
That's not Blackwood.

533
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:33,997
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

534
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:39,922
Time of death?

535
00:39:41,658 --> 00:39:43,953
Diptera is approximately...

536
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:48,219
...2/3 of an inch...

537
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,752
...which would put the time of death
between ten and twleve hours ago.

538
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:54,852
May I borrow your pen?

539
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,504
Headless dwarf.
- Midget.

540
00:40:11,718 --> 00:40:13,718
I know what I saw.

541
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,792
It was Blackwood.

542
00:40:17,634 --> 00:40:19,634
As clear as I see you.

543
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:23,938
And when the dead walk...

544
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:28,418
...the living will fill these coffins.

545
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:32,483
Well...Um...

546
00:40:35,575 --> 00:40:39,101
Right. Put the lid on it and clean this lot up.

547
00:40:39,201 --> 00:40:41,101
You really believe he was resurrected?

548
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:44,475
The question is not 'if' but 'how.'
The game's afoot.

549
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,979
'follow your spirit and upon this charge...

550
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:50,904
...cry God for Harry, England
and St. George.'

551
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:58,519
Why that certain fish and chips store,
I don't understand.

552
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:01,783
That particular beer they use.
A northern stout to be exact.

553
00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:03,263
You know, Holmes.

554
00:41:03,363 --> 00:41:05,491
I've seen things in war I don't understand.

555
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:08,022
In India, I once met a man
who predicted his own death...

556
00:41:08,122 --> 00:41:13,035
...right down to the number and placement
of the bullets that killed him.

557
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:14,606
You have to admit, Holmes,

558
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:20,741
that a supernatural explanation
to this case, is theoretically possible.

559
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:21,660
No, agreed, but...

560
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,257
...it is a huge mistake to theorize
before one has data.

561
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,526
Inevitably, one begins to twist facts
to suit theory...

562
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:30,298
...instead of theories to suit facts.

563
00:41:30,398 --> 00:41:34,648
That said, I believe our midget
is the key to this.

564
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,207
Right. Scratches around the
keyhole where the watch is wound.

565
00:41:39,307 --> 00:41:40,257
What does that tell you?

566
00:41:40,357 --> 00:41:42,069
The man was likely a drunk.

567
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:45,006
Every time he wound the watch,
his hand would slip and hence the scratch.

568
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:46,695
Yes.
- Very good, Watson.

569
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,181
You have developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.

570
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:53,633
Let's see now. There are several
sets of initials scored..

571
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:55,191
Pawn brokers mark.
- Excellent.

572
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:59,179
The mostb recent of which are
'M.H. M.H. M.H.....

573
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:02,169
...is for...
- 'Maddison and Haig.'

574
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:09,725
They should be able to give us an address.

575
00:42:12,502 --> 00:42:14,502
What a coincidence.

576
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,792
There is one thing you've failed to deduce
from the watch, Holmes.

577
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:19,516
Really? I think not.

578
00:42:19,616 --> 00:42:20,472
The time.

579
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,867
I have to get back, Holmes.

580
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:25,236
Taking tea with the in-laws.

581
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:27,590
Predicting your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

582
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,766
No thank you, ma'am.

583
00:42:28,866 --> 00:42:30,108
You need to hear what I have to tell you.

584
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,443
We have no need of your
lucky hela, gypsy woman.

585
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:35,008
Even if it's to do with Mary?

586
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:43,405
I see two men.

587
00:42:43,505 --> 00:42:46,569
Brothers. Not in blood, but in bond.

588
00:42:50,663 --> 00:42:51,728
What of Mary?

589
00:42:51,828 --> 00:42:55,993
M for Mary.
For marriage. Oh, you will be married.

590
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,407
Go on.
- Ohh

591
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:02,647
I see patterned table cloths and...ohh

592
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,787
china figurines and...ohhh
lace doilies...

593
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:07,031
-Hmf, Doilies

594
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:09,315
Lace Doilies.

595
00:43:09,415 --> 00:43:11,415
Holmes.

596
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:15,541
Does your depravity know no bounds?
- No.

597
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,574
Oh, she turns to fat and she has a beard
and...

598
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,030
What of the warts?

599
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,863
She is covered in warts.
- Enough.

600
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:22,553
Are they extensive?

601
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,123
- Please, enough.

602
00:43:28,492 --> 00:43:30,605
It's a most apt prediction Flora has made.

603
00:43:30,705 --> 00:43:33,593
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

604
00:43:33,693 --> 00:43:34,625
Do you have my money?

605
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:37,018
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

606
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:38,173
Do you have my money?

607
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:39,801
Admit it. Admit it.
- Give me my money.

608
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:41,901
Holmes.

609
00:43:44,629 --> 00:43:46,629
I see.

610
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:53,509
Thank you.

611
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:58,705
You've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.

612
00:43:58,805 --> 00:43:59,735
Should be just there.

613
00:43:59,835 --> 00:44:03,316
I think she'll really like this.

614
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:06,627
And I have some change in my pocket.

615
00:44:10,132 --> 00:44:13,362
Shall I look after it for you?
- No no.

616
00:44:13,937 --> 00:44:16,187
Don't give it away here.
- No.

617
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,287
I have to go see Mary.

618
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:20,311
Give her my best.

619
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,075
And the family as well.

620
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,332
It does make a considerable difference
to me having...

621
00:45:05,432 --> 00:45:08,559
...someone with me on whom
I can thoroughly rely.

622
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:12,654
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

623
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,520
He clearly felt something
would come after him.

624
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,620
Something did.

625
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:21,085
Irene Adler was here.

626
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:26,156
Either that, or the ginger midget
wore the same Parisian perfume.

627
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:30,403
Ahhh, putrefaction.

628
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:38,539
Ammonium sulphate,
among other aromas.

629
00:45:42,977 --> 00:45:44,977
Phosphorus.

630
00:45:45,947 --> 00:45:47,947
Formaldehyde.

631
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,957
It looks like...
he was attempting to combine...

632
00:46:04,754 --> 00:46:08,749
...some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

633
00:46:16,016 --> 00:46:18,016
More impotantly...

634
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:22,105
...let's see what he was trying to dispose of.

635
00:46:22,205 --> 00:46:23,531
Potassium, magnesium.

636
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:24,919
Sultafitic acid.

637
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:30,459
Try to take the ion out of the ink
As long as it's not too burnt.

638
00:46:43,863 --> 00:46:45,863
Peculiar.

639
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:49,637
Hydrated rhododendron.

640
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:18,370
Holmes.
Look at the crest.

641
00:47:20,073 --> 00:47:22,022
Riordan was working with Blackwood.

642
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:23,768
Of course he was.

643
00:47:23,868 --> 00:47:26,418
The question is...
to what end?

644
00:47:30,149 --> 00:47:33,539
Whatever he was working on...
He clearly succeeded.

645
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:35,002
How so?

646
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,410
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

647
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,168
Which is why Miss Adler
is so desperate to find him.

648
00:47:40,268 --> 00:47:41,801
Yes.

649
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:44,993
There's one odor I can't
quite put my finger on.

650
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:47,388
Is it candy floss?
Molasses?

651
00:47:47,577 --> 00:47:49,577
Maple syrup.
Ahh, Barley sugar

652
00:47:49,636 --> 00:47:51,931
- Toffee apple.

653
00:47:57,831 --> 00:47:59,226
Let me guess.

654
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:01,996
Judging by your arsenous tool kit.

655
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:05,899
You're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

656
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:07,999
Just one minute, boys.

657
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:10,312
Oh, Dredger.

658
00:48:25,515 --> 00:48:27,515
There a problem?

659
00:48:29,995 --> 00:48:31,289
Meat...

660
00:48:31,389 --> 00:48:33,389
...or potatoes?

661
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:35,524
My ten minutes are up.

662
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:30,786
You all right?

663
00:50:45,783 --> 00:50:47,783
Holmes.
What is that?

664
00:54:17,409 --> 00:54:19,409
Holmes.

665
00:55:12,516 --> 00:55:14,256
Watson...

666
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,356
What have you done?

667
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:29,729
I haven't slept all night.

668
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:31,829
Not a wink.

669
00:55:33,049 --> 00:55:35,049
Why I ever believed...

670
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:39,609
That I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents...

671
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:42,467
...is beyond me, having been talked
into going with you.

672
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:43,768
We were set upon man,
it was self-defense.

673
00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:48,432
I've been reviewing my notes,
our exploits over tha last seven months.

674
00:55:48,532 --> 00:55:50,227
Would you like to know my conclusion?

675
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:52,962
I am psychologically disturbed.

676
00:55:52,994 --> 00:55:53,800
How so?

677
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,184
Why else would I continually
be led into situations...

678
00:55:58,284 --> 00:56:01,800
...where you deliberately
withhold your plans for me?

679
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,508
Why else?

680
00:56:03,608 --> 00:56:07,039
You never complained about
my methods before.

681
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:08,801
I'm not complaining.
- You're not?

682
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:09,933
What do you call this?

683
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,822
How am I complaining?
I never complain.

684
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:14,567
When do I complain about yout practicing
the violin at 3 in the morning?

685
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:17,072
Or your mess, or your
general lack of hygiene...

686
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:18,726
...or the fact that you steal my clothes?

687
00:56:18,826 --> 00:56:19,944
We have a barter system.

688
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,681
When do I complain about you
setting fire to my rooms?

689
00:56:22,781 --> 00:56:23,917
Our rooms.

690
00:56:24,017 --> 00:56:26,697
The rooms. When do I complain that
you experiment on my dog?

691
00:56:26,797 --> 00:56:27,953
Our dog.
- On the the dog.

692
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:28,569
It's our dog.

693
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:35,299
Where I do take issue, is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary..

694
00:56:35,368 --> 00:56:37,368
with Mary.

695
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:44,026
I understand.

696
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:46,126
Do you?
- I do.

697
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,809
I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

698
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,840
Yes
- You're feeling a bit sensitive.

699
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,191
I'm not sensitive.

700
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,331
What you need is a rest.

701
00:56:55,471 --> 00:56:58,182
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

702
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:01,138
Beautiful grounds.
There's a falls...

703
00:57:01,238 --> 00:57:02,985
We could throw a lamb on the spit.

704
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:06,510
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the
country it would be with my future wife.

705
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:07,880
Well, certainly, if we must...

706
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,049
Not you, Mary and I.

707
00:57:10,149 --> 00:57:12,175
You are not...
- What? Invited?

708
00:57:12,275 --> 00:57:15,268
Why would I not be invited to my
own brother's country home, Watson?

709
00:57:15,368 --> 00:57:17,717
You are not making any sense.
- You're not human.

710
00:57:17,817 --> 00:57:20,974
John Watson?
- Yes.

711
00:57:21,947 --> 00:57:24,157
Your bail has been posted.

712
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:31,728
Mary.

713
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,625
Just Watson.

714
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:49,649
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because boys are getting hungry.

715
00:57:58,335 --> 00:58:00,194
Back off. Back off.

716
00:58:00,294 --> 00:58:04,714
To which the barman says:
'May I push in your stool?'.

717
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:08,609
Right you. You're out.

718
00:58:09,046 --> 00:58:13,126
Until next time.
- Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

719
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,771
Thank heaven you're here, Lestrade
I'd almost ran out of jokes.

720
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:18,844
You know, in another life,
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

721
00:58:18,944 --> 00:58:20,395
Yes, and you, sir,
an excellent policeman.

722
00:58:20,495 --> 00:58:22,495
Tomsky. Thank you.

723
00:58:23,924 --> 00:58:26,402
Please tell me you have answers.

724
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:28,813
All in good time, Lestrade.

725
00:58:28,913 --> 00:58:30,609
All in good time? What is
this, some parlor game...

726
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:32,200
...where we have to guess
what your're thinking?

727
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,000
I've got a public in frenzy out there...

728
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,219
...now if you don't fill me in
I'll have you in there...

729
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,404
...playing Victoria and Albert
quicker than a bookie's runner.

730
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:42,625
Now, clean up and make
yourself presentable.

731
00:58:42,725 --> 00:58:43,986
For whom?

732
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:45,493
I have friends in high places.

733
00:58:45,593 --> 00:58:49,333
They're the ones
who bailed you out of there.

734
00:58:58,638 --> 00:59:01,861
I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, sir.

735
00:59:01,961 --> 00:59:05,446
But I'm going to have to put this on you.

736
00:59:08,106 --> 00:59:12,271
Mr. Holmes, apologies
for summoning you like this.

737
00:59:12,892 --> 00:59:16,803
I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to
where you are and who I am.

738
00:59:16,903 --> 00:59:18,679
As to where I am...

739
00:59:18,779 --> 00:59:22,244
I was admittedly lost for a moment,
between Charing Cross and Holborn,

740
00:59:22,344 --> 00:59:25,773
but I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill.

741
00:59:25,873 --> 00:59:29,874
the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves.

742
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:30,993
a Brittany sage.

743
00:59:31,093 --> 00:59:32,795
After that the carriage fork left and right...

744
00:59:32,895 --> 00:59:35,497
...a telltale bump at the fleet conduit.

745
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:37,597
As to who you are...

746
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,078
...it took every ounce of my not
inconsiderabile experience.

747
00:59:40,178 --> 00:59:43,361
The letters on your desk are
addressed to Sir Thomas Rodrum.

748
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:45,045
You are Chief Justice, that
would be your official title.

749
00:59:45,145 --> 00:59:50,330
Who you really are...
is of course is another matter entirely.

750
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,419
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...

751
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:54,672
...you are the secret head
of the Temple of the Four Orders...

752
00:59:54,772 --> 00:59:56,904
...into whose headquarters we now sit...

753
00:59:57,004 --> 01:00:00,372
...on the northwest corner
of St. James Square, I think.

754
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:06,592
The only mystery that remains is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

755
01:00:07,122 --> 01:00:10,630
Yes...
Well, standard procedure I suppose.

756
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,991
I dare say we have the
right man, gentlemen.

757
01:00:16,091 --> 01:00:16,894
Sherlock Holmes.

758
01:00:16,994 --> 01:00:21,065
Ambassador Standish from America,
and Lord Coward, the Home Sewcretary.

759
01:00:21,165 --> 01:00:25,568
I suppose you already have some notion
as to the practices of our Order?

760
01:00:25,668 --> 01:00:26,734
Yes.

761
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:29,600
Yes... they are practically interesting.

762
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,296
Be as skeptical as you like,
but our secret systems...

763
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,674
...have steered the world for
the greater good for centuries.

764
01:00:34,774 --> 01:00:38,578
The danger is they can also be used
for more nefarious purposes.

765
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:42,493
What some call the dark arts
or practical magic.

766
01:00:42,593 --> 01:00:46,054
We know you don't believe in magic,
Mr. Holmes.

767
01:00:46,154 --> 01:00:48,836
We don't expect you to share our faith,
merely...

768
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,250
...our fears.

769
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,201
Fear is the more infectious condition...

770
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:55,301
...in this instance.

771
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,583
Fear of your own child.

772
01:01:02,654 --> 01:01:04,463
Blackwood is your son.

773
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:07,660
You have the same irises,
a rare dark green.

774
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,998
The diamond-shaped hazel flanks.

775
01:01:10,098 --> 01:01:12,706
Together with identical arterias
which are only passed down...

776
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:13,904
...through direct blood lines...

777
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,642
...which makes you by necessity brothers...

778
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:20,907
...or in this case,
more likely... father and son.

779
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:27,895
Very few people are privy
to that information.

780
01:01:27,995 --> 01:01:31,130
And we want to keep it that way.

781
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:37,243
He was conceived during one of our rituals.

782
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:38,281
His mother wasn't my wife.

783
01:01:38,381 --> 01:01:43,168
But she shared our beliefs.
She was a powerful practitioner.

784
01:01:43,268 --> 01:01:47,348
Though not enough to
survive giving birth to him.

785
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:50,062
Death followed him wherever he went.

786
01:01:50,162 --> 01:01:52,524
Those five girls were not the first
to be butchered.

787
01:01:52,624 --> 01:01:56,377
He killed many more using them
to enhance his powers.

788
01:01:56,477 --> 01:02:00,689
No one could prove anything, of course,
but we all knew.

789
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:02,836
The boy was a curse.

790
01:02:02,936 --> 01:02:05,378
We'd done our best to stop him
ourselves, but it was not enough.

791
01:02:05,478 --> 01:02:07,854
His power grows daily.

792
01:02:07,954 --> 01:02:09,886
His resurrection is evidence of that.

793
01:02:09,986 --> 01:02:12,275
But what he does next will
be far more dangerous.

794
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:17,193
His secret lies in the book of spells.
This is the source of his power.

795
01:02:17,293 --> 01:02:20,340
He's going to raise a force that will
alter the very course of the world.

796
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,851
I want you to find him and stop him
before he does.

797
01:02:23,951 --> 01:02:27,521
We'll give you any assistance that we can.

798
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:31,903
As Home Secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

799
01:02:32,003 --> 01:02:35,440
So...

800
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,233
Name your price.

801
01:02:39,378 --> 01:02:40,712
Well a great benefit to being a consulting
detective,

802
01:02:40,812 --> 01:02:41,643
can pick and choose my clients.

803
01:02:41,743 --> 01:02:44,215
is that I can pick and choose my clients.

804
01:02:44,315 --> 01:02:46,950
Consider it done.
I'll stop him.

805
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:48,734
But not for you.

806
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:51,384
And certainly not for a price.

807
01:02:54,995 --> 01:02:57,750
I do have a parting query,
Sir Thomas.

808
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:58,911
What is that?

809
01:02:59,011 --> 01:03:00,890
If the rest of his family is dead...

810
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:03,362
How long do you expect to survive?

811
01:03:03,462 --> 01:03:05,462
Food for thought.

812
01:03:31,148 --> 01:03:34,738
Well, perhaps you'll have
better luck opening that.

813
01:03:34,838 --> 01:03:37,586
Margaux. 58.
A commet vintage.

814
01:03:38,588 --> 01:03:42,457
How fascinating that an astronomical
event can affect the quality...

815
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:45,542
How is it going with our
case you refuse to take?

816
01:03:45,642 --> 01:03:47,642
...wine.

817
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:50,084
Oh, I've hit a dead end...
literally.

818
01:03:50,184 --> 01:03:55,600
I found your man.
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

819
01:03:57,215 --> 01:03:59,215
If you still need him.

820
01:04:00,615 --> 01:04:02,615
Oh dear...

821
01:04:03,608 --> 01:04:07,688
Hope my client doesn't come
looking for a refund.

822
01:04:07,971 --> 01:04:09,651
He's a professor, isn't he?

823
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:12,619
I couldn't see his face, but I
spotted a bit of chalk on his apparel.

824
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:19,009
I've never known a teacher to carry a gun
and on such a clever contraption.

825
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:23,079
Eyepatch.
Nice touch.

826
01:04:24,033 --> 01:04:26,311
So... case closed.

827
01:04:26,411 --> 01:04:29,205
Which makes this a social visit.

828
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:33,092
No. It's a you're in over you're
head Irene visit.

829
01:04:33,192 --> 01:04:35,695
Whoever killed Riordon
was covering their tracks.

830
01:04:35,795 --> 01:04:39,875
which makes you the
next loose end to be snipped.

831
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:42,068
Let it breathe.

832
01:04:42,848 --> 01:04:44,830
I've never been in over my head.

833
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:48,415
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

834
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:52,456
Or stay. And volunteer for
protective custody.

835
01:04:56,007 --> 01:04:58,822
If I am in danger,
so are you.

836
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:04,804
Come with me.

837
01:05:07,229 --> 01:05:09,779
What if we trusted each other?

838
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:13,588
You're not listening.
I'm taking you to either the railway station,

839
01:05:13,688 --> 01:05:14,818
either to the railway staion...

840
01:05:14,918 --> 01:05:17,128
...or the police station..

841
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:30,605
So...

842
01:05:33,891 --> 01:05:35,891
What is it to be?

843
01:05:37,052 --> 01:05:38,853
You decide.
Which will it be?

844
01:05:38,953 --> 01:05:43,375
I told you to let it breathe.

845
01:05:44,828 --> 01:05:46,868
Can you taste the comet?

846
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:56,215
Why couldn't you just come away with me?

847
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:01,099
neverrrr.....-.

848
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:46,842
Madam, I need you to remain calm.

849
01:07:47,093 --> 01:07:50,117
And trust me, I'm a professional.
Beneath this pillow...

850
01:07:50,217 --> 01:07:52,767
...lies the key to my release.

851
01:07:52,872 --> 01:07:56,309
Of course, she misinterpreted
my intention entirely.

852
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:57,409
Naturally, sir.

853
01:07:57,509 --> 01:07:59,206
That's why I find this modern
religious further so troubling.

854
01:07:59,306 --> 01:08:00,525
religious fanaticism so troubling.

855
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:01,472
There's no latitude for misunderstandings.

856
01:08:01,572 --> 01:08:02,700
That's right. Rhyme over reason.

857
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,650
And chambermaids were
once such a liberal breed.

858
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,790
My wife's a chambermaid.

859
01:08:10,117 --> 01:08:14,208
Anyhow. It's a good thing she was offended
or we might never have found you.

860
01:08:14,308 --> 01:08:20,003
The inspector's been over to
Baker Street himself this morning, sir.

861
01:08:21,785 --> 01:08:25,100
Just joking about the wife, sir.
- Ohh -.

862
01:08:28,568 --> 01:08:31,932
We've checked everything sir,
no sign of a break-in...

863
01:08:32,032 --> 01:08:34,896
...and the butler didn't hear a thing.

864
01:08:34,996 --> 01:08:37,469
So, our body in the bathtub.
His eyes are wide open...

865
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:40,629
...and the only thing missing was...

866
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:42,725
...his ring, sir.

867
01:08:58,948 --> 01:09:00,579
Why did you drain the water?

868
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:02,076
Out of common decency.

869
01:09:02,176 --> 01:09:04,412
Crime is common.
Logic is rare.

870
01:09:04,512 --> 01:09:11,567
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer
not to provide comfort for the corpse.

871
01:09:23,389 --> 01:09:25,389
What is that?

872
01:09:28,288 --> 01:09:29,489
Jasmine bath salt, sir.

873
01:09:29,589 --> 01:09:32,375
Superb. Probably comes from a
larger container.

874
01:09:32,475 --> 01:09:34,501
It will either be in the pantry...

875
01:09:34,601 --> 01:09:37,628
...high up, where it is warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

876
01:09:37,728 --> 01:09:39,866
And constable, you could do worse than...

877
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:42,263
...to check the ground
under the rear window...

878
01:09:42,363 --> 01:09:43,953
...for any signs of footprints
that are not your own.

879
01:09:44,053 --> 01:09:48,388
Data, data, data. I cannot make
bricks without clay.

880
01:10:46,448 --> 01:10:48,448
Mr Holmes?

881
01:10:56,321 --> 01:10:58,687
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

882
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,997
It was in the pantry, sir.

883
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,955
I don't know what to make of this.

884
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:05,055
Excellent work.

885
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:07,167
Adieu.

886
01:11:45,142 --> 01:11:47,280
What is the meaning of this, Coward?

887
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,198
Why have you called this meeting?

888
01:11:49,298 --> 01:11:51,298
Sir Thomas is dead.

889
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:56,677
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the Order.

890
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:00,778
Have you lost your mind?

891
01:12:01,111 --> 01:12:03,437
You know damned well
what he is capable of.

892
01:12:03,537 --> 01:12:05,537
Of course he does.

893
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:09,021
That's why we are here.

894
01:12:10,303 --> 01:12:12,598
That's why we are all here.

895
01:12:18,025 --> 01:12:21,939
My powers and my assets were
given to me for one purpose.

896
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:25,711
Magnificent... but simple purpose.

897
01:12:27,214 --> 01:12:29,214
To create a new future.

898
01:12:29,992 --> 01:12:34,244
A future... ruled... by us.

899
01:12:37,462 --> 01:12:43,832
Tomorrow, at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

900
01:12:43,932 --> 01:12:45,771
Magic will lead the way.

901
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:47,789
Once the people of England
see our newfound power...

902
01:12:47,889 --> 01:12:50,439
...they will bow down in fear.

903
01:12:54,968 --> 01:12:58,898
Across the Atlantic lies
a colony that was once ours.

904
01:12:58,998 --> 01:13:00,998
It will be again.

905
01:13:01,232 --> 01:13:03,524
The Civil War has made them weak.

906
01:13:03,624 --> 01:13:08,469
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours.

907
01:13:08,909 --> 01:13:10,909
So we'll take it back.

908
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:14,784
We will remake the world.

909
01:13:16,674 --> 01:13:18,674
Create the future.

910
01:13:19,973 --> 01:13:22,608
These men are with me,
Standish.

911
01:13:23,595 --> 01:13:26,023
But... are you?

912
01:13:27,412 --> 01:13:29,939
No, sir.
I am not.

913
01:13:31,285 --> 01:13:34,113
These powers that you are playing with...

914
01:13:34,213 --> 01:13:36,552
...no man can control.

915
01:13:38,504 --> 01:13:42,928
Well gentlemen,
someone has to stop them.

916
01:13:43,401 --> 01:13:47,990
Even if you won't.

917
01:13:48,343 --> 01:13:51,148
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

918
01:14:12,784 --> 01:14:15,573
Gentlemen...
don't be afraid.

919
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:21,597
As you can see,
we are protected.

920
01:14:23,936 --> 01:14:27,081
Come... drink to your alligence here.

921
01:14:32,829 --> 01:14:35,889
You control the police,
now use them.

922
01:14:48,328 --> 01:14:49,686
I didn't know you were here.

923
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:53,941
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I... utilize it?

924
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:56,041
Be my guest.

925
01:14:57,196 --> 01:14:59,877
In here, chaps.
- Where do you want me to put him sir?

926
01:14:59,977 --> 01:15:01,977
Anywhere's fine.

927
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,408
Who is he?

928
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:15,705
He's the man who tried to kill
you at Riordan's lodgings.

929
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:19,038
I suppose his neck didn't survive the
impact of Dredger landing on him.

930
01:15:19,138 --> 01:15:22,241
Yes... Thanks for that, by the way.

931
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:29,130
But there is some consolation
in the knowledge...

932
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:33,511
...that he can still be of
service to his fellow man.

933
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:35,378
Elbow is long stained with blood.

934
01:15:35,478 --> 01:15:38,623
But it's ultimately his own injuries.

935
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:49,307
I don't know if it's human.
It's not a butcher. Let me see...

936
01:15:58,885 --> 01:16:01,095
Yellow Flame. Green burst.

937
01:16:01,634 --> 01:16:03,634
An industrial worker.

938
01:16:07,512 --> 01:16:09,805
Coal. River silt.

939
01:16:10,553 --> 01:16:13,193
And the stripe on his trousers
should put him squarely in...

940
01:16:13,293 --> 01:16:14,799
Nine Elms.

941
01:16:14,899 --> 01:16:15,881
Sorry. What?

942
01:16:15,981 --> 01:16:19,466
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.

943
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:23,692
Do you remember where I put the
Lord's registry of embassy interests?

944
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:25,792
It's on the stepladder.

945
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:38,982
Blackwood has had his hand
in just about everything...

946
01:16:39,082 --> 01:16:40,697
...that is corrosive to the spirit.

947
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:42,429
Woolidge Arsenal.

948
01:16:42,529 --> 01:16:43,979
Limehouse Chemical Works.

949
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,184
Probably be a factory by the river.

950
01:16:46,284 --> 01:16:48,085
What's that?

951
01:16:48,185 --> 01:16:50,185
Never mind.

952
01:16:51,595 --> 01:16:53,835
You don't know where my
rugby ball went, do you?

953
01:16:53,935 --> 01:16:55,525
No, not a clue.

954
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:58,260
Queen's Heights slaughterhouse.

955
01:16:58,563 --> 01:17:00,248
Nine Elms.

956
01:17:00,348 --> 01:17:02,348
A factory by the river.

957
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:04,810
Well done, Watson. That should
lead us right to Blackwood.

958
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:06,075
Dead or alive.

959
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,175
Not us.

960
01:17:09,127 --> 01:17:11,127
You.

961
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:13,331
Yes.

962
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:16,981
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

963
01:17:25,506 --> 01:17:28,056
He's left it there on purpose.

964
01:17:58,847 --> 01:18:01,193
Glad to see that you two
are working hard, then.

965
01:18:01,293 --> 01:18:03,728
And I thought we were trying to be discreet.

966
01:18:03,828 --> 01:18:07,143
You would not last one day in the navy.

967
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:11,979
Holmes, are you sure there
is no other alternative means...

968
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:13,829
...of water transportation than that?

969
01:18:13,929 --> 01:18:17,751
I guarantee you no one knows
London's waterways better.

970
01:18:17,851 --> 01:18:20,133
Tim is practically a fish himself.

971
01:18:20,233 --> 01:18:21,482
Certainly drinks like one.

972
01:18:21,582 --> 01:18:23,750
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.

973
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:25,850
If only just a sense.

974
01:18:26,487 --> 01:18:30,142
Better take over here.
Bit tricky down here.

975
01:18:51,687 --> 01:18:53,687
Come on.

976
01:19:08,898 --> 01:19:10,527
Look familiar?
- Yes.

977
01:19:10,627 --> 01:19:13,857
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

978
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:27,018
They cleared something away from here.

979
01:19:27,118 --> 01:19:28,322
Not minutes ago.

980
01:19:28,422 --> 01:19:30,001
Like what?

981
01:19:30,101 --> 01:19:32,991
I'm not sure.
Something mechanical.

982
01:19:33,308 --> 01:19:35,308
Holmes.

983
01:19:35,308 --> 01:19:37,308
Look at this.

984
01:20:01,322 --> 01:20:03,119
1:18
- Chapter and verse.

985
01:20:03,219 --> 01:20:06,150
Revelations. 1:18.
I am he that liveth, and was dead.

986
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:09,605
And Behold I am alive, forevermore.

987
01:20:11,902 --> 01:20:13,776
I warned you, Holmes, to accept...

988
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:15,505
...that this was beyond your control.

989
01:20:15,605 --> 01:20:19,600
Beyond what your rational
mind could comprehend.

990
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:22,587
What a busy afterlife you're having.

991
01:20:22,687 --> 01:20:24,399
I want you to bare witness.

992
01:20:24,499 --> 01:20:28,647
Tomorrow, at midday,
the world as you know it...will end...

993
01:20:28,747 --> 01:20:29,322
...will end.

994
01:20:29,422 --> 01:20:31,964
Show me your face and it will be
the end of your world right now.

995
01:20:32,064 --> 01:20:33,699
Save your bullet, Watson.

996
01:20:33,799 --> 01:20:35,799
A gift for you.

997
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,055
What was that about saving bullets?

998
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:52,418
She followed you here, Holmes.

999
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:56,451
You led your lamb to slaughter.

1000
01:20:59,723 --> 01:21:01,723
Holmes.

1001
01:21:02,519 --> 01:21:05,069
This game is designed to hurt.

1002
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:18,071
Watson.

1003
01:21:21,685 --> 01:21:23,895
It's warm in here, Watson.

1004
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:32,978
In over your head yet, darling?

1005
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,525
Hold on there.
- I can't.

1006
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:43,752
Let me take your weight.

1007
01:21:44,326 --> 01:21:46,536
Give us a leg up, old boy.

1008
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:52,185
These German locks
always give me trouble.

1009
01:21:56,046 --> 01:21:58,046
It's a bandsaw.

1010
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:04,106
No matter. We have plenty of time.

1011
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:07,036
Holmes...

1012
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:16,703
It's not working.
- Keep calm.

1013
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:26,906
Holmes.
Hurry up.

1014
01:22:33,607 --> 01:22:35,607
Don't get excited.

1015
01:22:36,186 --> 01:22:38,186
Turn off that valve.

1016
01:23:01,692 --> 01:23:03,372
And we bounce in three...

1017
01:23:03,472 --> 01:23:04,125
...two,

1018
01:23:04,225 --> 01:23:06,225
...one.

1019
01:23:16,853 --> 01:23:18,853
Thank you.

1020
01:23:19,122 --> 01:23:21,672
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

1021
01:23:30,571 --> 01:23:32,346
Thank you.

1022
01:23:32,446 --> 01:23:34,826
We should...help the doctor.

1023
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:48,950
Holmes.

1024
01:25:49,076 --> 01:25:53,424
Lord Coward has issued a
warrant for your arrest, sir.

1025
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:57,859
Watson is alive.
Just get out of here. Go, sir, now.

1026
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:16,104
Will the train be departing on time?

1027
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:18,741
The train's been delayed, madam.

1028
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:21,306
Shouldn't be long now though.

1029
01:26:37,367 --> 01:26:40,767
The train will depart when I tell it to.

1030
01:26:42,347 --> 01:26:46,767
And you will leave my employment
when I allow you to.

1031
01:26:49,978 --> 01:26:52,018
I fulfilled my contract.

1032
01:26:52,592 --> 01:26:54,087
I found Riordan.

1033
01:26:54,187 --> 01:26:56,304
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

1034
01:26:56,404 --> 01:26:58,116
So that's me finished.

1035
01:26:58,216 --> 01:27:02,087
Your job was to manipulate
Holmes' feelings for you...

1036
01:27:02,187 --> 01:27:04,187
...not succumb to them.

1037
01:27:06,717 --> 01:27:08,653
You have fulfilled nothing.

1038
01:27:08,753 --> 01:27:11,828
I want what Riordon
was making for Blackwood.

1039
01:27:11,928 --> 01:27:17,368
Finish the job, other the next dead
body will be Sherlock Holmes.

1040
01:27:45,155 --> 01:27:48,215
The surgeon should be along shortly.

1041
01:27:51,944 --> 01:27:54,579
You should be able to rest now.

1042
01:27:57,193 --> 01:27:59,193
Excuse me.

1043
01:28:02,723 --> 01:28:04,716
Is that the best you can do?

1044
01:28:04,816 --> 01:28:06,816
Yes, for now.

1045
01:28:06,974 --> 01:28:09,949
I must attend to my other patients.

1046
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,469
Doctor...

1047
01:28:12,569 --> 01:28:14,054
Doctor.

1048
01:28:14,154 --> 01:28:16,154
Please.

1049
01:28:20,498 --> 01:28:23,783
I know that you care for
him as much as I do.

1050
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:28,133
This is not your responsibility.
It was his choice.

1051
01:28:28,242 --> 01:28:31,557
He'd say that it was worse than wounds.

1052
01:28:37,535 --> 01:28:39,535
Solve this.

1053
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:42,161
Whatever it takes.

1054
01:28:56,787 --> 01:28:58,462
'It's Lord Blackwood, sir.'..

1055
01:28:58,562 --> 01:29:00,477
'I've never been in over my head.'

1056
01:29:00,577 --> 01:29:03,014
'leave the case alone'...

1057
01:29:03,114 --> 01:29:04,901
...'you're not taking it seriously, Holmes'...

1058
01:29:05,001 --> 01:29:07,415
...'beyond your control'...

1059
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:10,835
...'tomorrow at midday, the world will end'
'public in frenzy'

1060
01:29:10,935 --> 01:29:12,935
Holmes....

1061
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:42,384
' You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.'

1062
01:29:42,484 --> 01:29:44,779
' steel your mind, Holmes.'

1063
01:29:45,696 --> 01:29:47,472
'... force that will alter the
very course of the world '

1064
01:29:47,572 --> 01:29:48,779
'increases in power.'

1065
01:29:48,879 --> 01:29:50,136
'... is the source of his power'

1066
01:29:50,236 --> 01:29:51,214
'I need you.'

1067
01:29:51,314 --> 01:29:54,714
'the secret lies in the book of spells.'

1068
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:23,369
'Three more will die...'

1069
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:27,893
'and there is nothing you
can do to save them'

1070
01:30:27,993 --> 01:30:30,900
'we know you don't believe in magic.'

1071
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,060
'Riordon was working with Blackwood'

1072
01:30:35,724 --> 01:30:38,529
'something was coming to get him'

1073
01:30:40,181 --> 01:30:43,326
'the only thing missing was his ring'

1074
01:30:49,730 --> 01:30:51,730
'Give up, Holmes'

1075
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:56,391
'is a riddle that you cannot solve'.

1076
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:04,359
Good morning.

1077
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:10,016
Now...you need to work.

1078
01:31:11,702 --> 01:31:13,702
Familiar artwork.

1079
01:31:15,358 --> 01:31:17,358
You look gorgeous.

1080
01:31:19,908 --> 01:31:22,798
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1081
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:32,173
You made the front page.

1082
01:31:32,273 --> 01:31:34,568
Only a name and no picture?

1083
01:31:35,038 --> 01:31:39,001
So... it looks like you will be needing
to work outside the law now...

1084
01:31:39,101 --> 01:31:42,396
...and that's my area of expertise.

1085
01:31:42,496 --> 01:31:44,496
I feel safer already.

1086
01:31:45,855 --> 01:31:49,170
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1087
01:31:49,241 --> 01:31:51,102
Yes...

1088
01:31:51,202 --> 01:31:53,667
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1089
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:56,399
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1090
01:32:02,024 --> 01:32:05,327
Well then...um... I'm just so very glad...

1091
01:32:05,427 --> 01:32:09,587
...that...you're um...
well...with us.

1092
01:32:15,024 --> 01:32:19,189
Now that you're sitting
comfortably I shall begin.

1093
01:32:19,558 --> 01:32:22,695
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1094
01:32:22,795 --> 01:32:24,807
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville prison...

1095
01:32:24,907 --> 01:32:26,668
...he suggested I widen my gaze...

1096
01:32:26,768 --> 01:32:28,802
...and at minimum I have done just that.

1097
01:32:28,902 --> 01:32:32,531
In fact, I may well have
reconciled thousands...

1098
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:35,264
...of years of theological dfisparity.

1099
01:32:35,364 --> 01:32:37,744
But that's for another time.

1100
01:32:37,959 --> 01:32:40,323
Blackwood's method is based
on a ritualistic mystical system...

1101
01:32:40,423 --> 01:32:44,122
...that's been employed by the Temple
of the Four Orders for centuries.

1102
01:32:44,222 --> 01:32:48,692
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it.

1103
01:32:48,792 --> 01:32:51,261
I re-enacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt.

1104
01:32:51,361 --> 01:32:54,251
with a few enhancements of my own.

1105
01:32:54,595 --> 01:32:57,886
My journey took me so much farther down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

1106
01:32:57,986 --> 01:33:00,785
...and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail.

1107
01:33:00,885 --> 01:33:03,401
I have emerged...enlightened.

1108
01:33:04,439 --> 01:33:07,225
A fraternity who silently
controlled the Empire...

1109
01:33:07,325 --> 01:33:10,424
...shared the belief with the kings,
Pharaohs, and emperors of old...

1110
01:33:10,524 --> 01:33:13,436
...that the Sphinx was a door
to another dimension.

1111
01:33:13,536 --> 01:33:15,628
A gateway to an immeasurable power.

1112
01:33:15,728 --> 01:33:17,241
It's made up of four parts.

1113
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:20,935
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox,
the wings of an eagle...

1114
01:33:21,035 --> 01:33:22,686
...and the head of a man.

1115
01:33:22,786 --> 01:33:26,004
In Sir Thomas' secret chamber
I found the bone of an ox...

1116
01:33:26,104 --> 01:33:28,218
...the tooth of a lion,
the feather of an eagle,

1117
01:33:28,318 --> 01:33:29,375
and the hair of a man.

1118
01:33:29,475 --> 01:33:31,475
Map.

1119
01:33:34,506 --> 01:33:37,284
The points of the star represent
the five murdered girls.

1120
01:33:37,384 --> 01:33:40,412
But the cross is what
we are now interested in.

1121
01:33:40,512 --> 01:33:45,303
It's a widely held belief that within
the architecture of the great cities...

1122
01:33:45,403 --> 01:33:48,378
...a coded reference system exists.

1123
01:33:48,481 --> 01:33:51,016
Since he arose from the grave
Blackwood has killed three men.

1124
01:33:51,116 --> 01:33:52,946
Each murder was committed at a location...

1125
01:33:53,046 --> 01:33:55,010
...that has a direct
connection with the temple.

1126
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:57,150
Therefore... the system.

1127
01:33:57,784 --> 01:34:00,680
Reardon, the ginger midget,
represents man.

1128
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,990
We found his body... here.

1129
01:34:03,607 --> 01:34:07,602
Sir Thomas... master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1130
01:34:07,702 --> 01:34:09,702
He died here.

1131
01:34:09,985 --> 01:34:14,086
Standish, ambassador to America,
where the eagle has...

1132
01:34:14,186 --> 01:34:16,419
...been the national emblem
for over a hundred years.

1133
01:34:16,519 --> 01:34:19,325
Headquarters for the Temple
of the Four Orders, where he died...

1134
01:34:19,425 --> 01:34:21,425
...is here.

1135
01:34:22,485 --> 01:34:25,952
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1136
01:34:26,052 --> 01:34:30,982
So, we have man, the ox, eagle,...
only the lion remaining.

1137
01:34:31,641 --> 01:34:33,641
Right here.

1138
01:34:34,692 --> 01:34:36,692
Parliament.

1139
01:34:40,678 --> 01:34:45,635
Right. You four stay here,
the rest of you come with me.

1140
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:49,730
Right this way.

1141
01:34:52,514 --> 01:34:54,514
Ladies first.

1142
01:34:56,996 --> 01:35:00,821
Follow these instructions.
- Aren't you going?

1143
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:05,670
Hello hello hello.

1144
01:35:06,398 --> 01:35:08,508
Did the devil turn up?

1145
01:35:09,712 --> 01:35:12,372
Well...Never mind.

1146
01:35:13,736 --> 01:35:16,116
You got the next best thing.

1147
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:43,438
Beg your pardon, my lord.
I know that it's unorthodox.

1148
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:50,211
But Mr. Holmes, here, has been making
some serious accusations about you,

1149
01:35:50,686 --> 01:35:52,686
and the Order.

1150
01:35:54,277 --> 01:35:56,277
I see.

1151
01:35:57,151 --> 01:36:03,781
Well, at least that solves the great mystery
as to how you became an inspector.

1152
01:36:05,188 --> 01:36:07,188
Excuse me, my lord.

1153
01:36:07,622 --> 01:36:10,463
But I've been wanting to
do that for a long time.

1154
01:36:10,563 --> 01:36:14,443
Well, Inspector, I have five minutes
before my next engagement.

1155
01:36:14,543 --> 01:36:19,473
So why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy.

1156
01:36:20,888 --> 01:36:22,888
Thanks you, Lestrade.

1157
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:25,130
My lord.

1158
01:36:30,421 --> 01:36:33,604
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1159
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:36,339
...or just the one I prevented?

1160
01:36:36,942 --> 01:36:40,852
Very distinctive those
handmade shoes of yours.

1161
01:36:41,895 --> 01:36:47,250
But the price of quality is often
the unique imprint they leave.

1162
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:51,433
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1163
01:36:51,533 --> 01:36:55,450
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1164
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:58,307
Fortunately there is nothing
more stimulating than a case...

1165
01:36:58,407 --> 01:37:00,785
...where everything goes against you.

1166
01:37:00,885 --> 01:37:04,548
How many members of Parliament
ido you intend to murder at noon today?

1167
01:37:04,648 --> 01:37:09,238
Man, ox, eagle, lion.
Lion is the Parliament, isn't it?

1168
01:37:11,619 --> 01:37:13,619
Very clever.

1169
01:37:13,961 --> 01:37:16,456
But it's not murder,
Mr. Holmes.

1170
01:37:16,556 --> 01:37:18,386
It's mercy.

1171
01:37:18,486 --> 01:37:21,270
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1172
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:24,770
Don't you see that it's for their own...

1173
01:37:26,775 --> 01:37:29,454
No, but I don't care much what you think.

1174
01:37:29,554 --> 01:37:32,405
I jsimply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's final ceremony.

1175
01:37:32,505 --> 01:37:33,993
And now you've given it to me.

1176
01:37:34,093 --> 01:37:35,631
I've told you nothing.

1177
01:37:35,731 --> 01:37:39,149
But your clothes say infinitely more
than you could ever hope.

1178
01:37:39,249 --> 01:37:42,497
The mud smeared on your boots
from where you've been walking.

1179
01:37:42,597 --> 01:37:46,983
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.

1180
01:37:47,083 --> 01:37:50,398
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you have been vowing.

1181
01:37:50,498 --> 01:37:55,428
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.

1182
01:37:56,833 --> 01:38:00,128
You and Blackwood laid the final
touches to your ceremony in the sewers.

1183
01:38:00,228 --> 01:38:01,556
beneath Parliament...

1184
01:38:01,656 --> 01:38:03,781
...less than an hour ago.

1185
01:38:03,921 --> 01:38:05,921
Both houses meet today.

1186
01:38:06,345 --> 01:38:09,575
The whole government would be present.

1187
01:38:18,067 --> 01:38:21,715
It's a shame you made an
enemy of Blackwood, Holmes.

1188
01:38:21,815 --> 01:38:24,875
You would have made a valuable ally.

1189
01:38:31,194 --> 01:38:33,113
How terrible is wisdom...

1190
01:38:33,213 --> 01:38:36,613
...when it brings no profit to the wise?

1191
01:38:37,464 --> 01:38:39,190
We take power at noon.

1192
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:41,125
There isn't any time to waste then...

1193
01:38:41,225 --> 01:38:43,225
...is there?

1194
01:39:08,698 --> 01:39:09,925
I told you you he'd be coming out the...

1195
01:39:10,025 --> 01:39:11,476
...top window, soldier boy.
There isn't any way...

1196
01:39:11,576 --> 01:39:13,323
...he'd be coming out of that terrace.

1197
01:39:13,423 --> 01:39:16,727
Technically, that isn't the
top window, is it, sailor boy?

1198
01:39:16,827 --> 01:39:19,218
What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1199
01:39:19,318 --> 01:39:23,018
Anyway....You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed his role perfectly,

1200
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:24,510
performed his role perfectly.

1201
01:39:24,610 --> 01:39:26,335
infact, I think he rather enjoyed it.

1202
01:39:26,435 --> 01:39:28,564
I hope you know what
you're doing, Holmes.

1203
01:39:28,664 --> 01:39:30,386
Here's the key.

1204
01:39:30,486 --> 01:39:32,019
You got all you needed from Coward?

1205
01:39:32,119 --> 01:39:35,326
Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.

1206
01:39:35,426 --> 01:39:36,654
Taylor?
- Yes?

1207
01:39:36,754 --> 01:39:39,426
If you would, Captain, take us
under the bridge, port side,

1208
01:39:39,526 --> 01:39:41,932
approximately 100 yards,
beyond that you will...

1209
01:39:42,032 --> 01:39:44,233
...find the tunnel that
leads us to the sewers.

1210
01:39:44,333 --> 01:39:46,333
Right away, sir.

1211
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,844
The end is nigh.

1212
01:39:54,944 --> 01:40:00,299
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1213
01:40:46,105 --> 01:40:48,735
Behold. Blackwood's magic revealed.

1214
01:40:48,835 --> 01:40:49,846
What does it do?

1215
01:40:49,946 --> 01:40:51,611
It is a chemical weapon.

1216
01:40:51,711 --> 01:40:52,953
First of its kind.

1217
01:40:53,053 --> 01:40:54,912
You deduced that how?

1218
01:40:55,012 --> 01:40:56,848
From my pocket.

1219
01:40:56,948 --> 01:41:00,003
I slipped this over rather a cumbersome
rat at the slaughterhouse.

1220
01:41:00,103 --> 01:41:01,486
Notice the blue discoloration.

1221
01:41:01,586 --> 01:41:07,026
The faintest smell of bitter almonds,
telltale traces of cyanide.

1222
01:41:10,483 --> 01:41:12,752
Now we know what the ginger
midget was working on.

1223
01:41:12,853 --> 01:41:14,194
It will revolutionize warfare.

1224
01:41:14,294 --> 01:41:16,614
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1225
01:41:16,714 --> 01:41:21,049
It's now 7 minutes to noon.
What are we going to do?

1226
01:41:21,527 --> 01:41:23,527
Well when...

1227
01:41:26,016 --> 01:41:29,161
...she loves an entrance...for a muse.

1228
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,825
Shoot him.
Now, please.

1229
01:42:15,566 --> 01:42:18,116
Me Lords. Me Lords.
Me Lords...

1230
01:42:21,195 --> 01:42:26,125
The time has come.
Where only those who believe can remain.

1231
01:42:26,915 --> 01:42:29,354
Behold... Lord Blackwood.

1232
01:42:44,011 --> 01:42:46,011
You seem surprised.

1233
01:42:47,425 --> 01:42:52,241
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill England's destiny.

1234
01:42:52,341 --> 01:42:56,251
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1235
01:42:58,315 --> 01:43:00,780
Listen to the rabble outside.

1236
01:43:01,193 --> 01:43:02,856
Listen...

1237
01:43:02,956 --> 01:43:04,621
...to the fear.

1238
01:43:04,721 --> 01:43:08,546
I will use that as a weapon
to control them...

1239
01:43:08,927 --> 01:43:10,927
...and then the world.

1240
01:43:14,691 --> 01:43:18,601
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1241
01:43:20,744 --> 01:43:25,674
It's specifically designed to
prevent us from disarming it.

1242
01:43:26,245 --> 01:43:28,926
These components appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1243
01:43:29,026 --> 01:43:31,026
Electromagnetic waves?

1244
01:43:31,058 --> 01:43:33,303
When triggered the
electrodes will send a charge...

1245
01:43:33,403 --> 01:43:35,189
...converting the chemical into gas...

1246
01:43:35,289 --> 01:43:37,050
...the gas will travel up that shaft...

1247
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:40,562
...and filter through the ventilation
system that leads directly to Parliament.

1248
01:43:40,662 --> 01:43:45,350
Within seconds of its administration, the
most powerful men in the world will...

1249
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:46,711
...be choking on death.

1250
01:43:46,811 --> 01:43:48,075
Blackwood must have some
kind of transmitter...

1251
01:43:48,175 --> 01:43:49,385
...that connects with it remotely.

1252
01:43:49,485 --> 01:43:50,892
Three minutes, ten seconds.

1253
01:43:50,992 --> 01:43:55,582
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia.

1254
01:43:55,704 --> 01:43:58,169
Indestructible...and eternal.

1255
01:43:59,616 --> 01:44:01,835
Move it.

1256
01:44:02,835 --> 01:44:04,962
We don't actually have
to disarm the device.

1257
01:44:05,062 --> 01:44:06,793
We just have to remove the cylinders...

1258
01:44:06,893 --> 01:44:07,911
...remove the cylinders.

1259
01:44:08,011 --> 01:44:09,088
Yes.

1260
01:44:09,188 --> 01:44:15,053
Except that they're welded in.
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1261
01:44:15,377 --> 01:44:22,347
We need a container to direct the blast,
my clay pipe should service that ambition.

1262
01:44:39,461 --> 01:44:43,201
I.. rather wish you hadn't done that, Irene.

1263
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:52,065
On the twelfth chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1264
01:44:53,528 --> 01:44:57,723
All those of you who are with me
shall be protected.

1265
01:44:57,823 --> 01:45:00,404
All others will perish.

1266
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:09,990
I need your pipe.

1267
01:45:12,855 --> 01:45:14,855
Nut him.

1268
01:45:39,048 --> 01:45:42,048
Right....what?
Coat...got it.

1269
01:46:21,552 --> 01:46:25,010
A new order... begins now.

1270
01:46:33,334 --> 01:46:35,459
What are you waiting for?

1271
01:46:37,490 --> 01:46:39,490
That.

1272
01:46:50,775 --> 01:46:53,136
Apprehend Coward.

1273
01:46:55,202 --> 01:46:58,007
Can you manage?
- Of course I can.

1274
01:47:23,612 --> 01:47:25,862
Relax.
I'm a doctor.

1275
01:48:38,142 --> 01:48:41,457
Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?

1276
01:48:42,407 --> 01:48:44,407
We're safe now.

1277
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,800
Interesting assessment.

1278
01:48:48,558 --> 01:48:50,558
Run off.

1279
01:48:53,051 --> 01:48:55,686
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1280
01:48:56,328 --> 01:48:58,328
Fare thee well.

1281
01:49:02,781 --> 01:49:05,161
I don't want to run anymore.

1282
01:49:07,678 --> 01:49:09,803
I'll tell you everything.

1283
01:49:09,866 --> 01:49:11,866
I wish you would.

1284
01:49:34,223 --> 01:49:36,223
No.

1285
01:50:41,736 --> 01:50:43,946
There was never any magic.

1286
01:50:45,268 --> 01:50:47,268
Only conjuring tricks.

1287
01:50:51,407 --> 01:50:53,573
The simplest involve paying people off.

1288
01:50:53,673 --> 01:50:57,040
Like the prison guard who pretended to
be obsessed outside your cell.

1289
01:50:57,140 --> 01:51:00,893
Your reputation and the
inmates' fear did the rest.

1290
01:51:00,993 --> 01:51:03,533
Others required more
elaborate preparations.

1291
01:51:03,633 --> 01:51:07,543
Like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1292
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:09,479
You had it broken before
your burial and then...

1293
01:51:09,579 --> 01:51:13,149
...put back together with a mild adhesive.

1294
01:51:13,315 --> 01:51:15,725
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe.

1295
01:51:15,825 --> 01:51:21,605
A mixture of egg and honey,
besides, it'd be washed away by the rain.

1296
01:51:25,255 --> 01:51:27,344
Holmes.

1297
01:51:27,596 --> 01:51:30,308
Arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub...

1298
01:51:30,408 --> 01:51:32,107
...required more modern science.

1299
01:51:32,207 --> 01:51:34,931
Very clever of Riordan to find a paralytic...

1300
01:51:35,031 --> 01:51:38,031
...that was activated by the
combination of copper and water.

1301
01:51:38,131 --> 01:51:41,846
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1302
01:51:41,946 --> 01:51:44,693
It would have been quite a
challenge for me had he...

1303
01:51:44,793 --> 01:51:49,128
...not also tested it on some
unfortunate amphibian.

1304
01:51:53,315 --> 01:51:55,649
The death of Standish was a real mystery...

1305
01:51:55,749 --> 01:52:00,038
...until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1306
01:52:00,138 --> 01:52:03,793
An odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid...

1307
01:52:03,802 --> 01:52:07,797
...gives it a burn with
an unusual pinkish hue.

1308
01:52:08,031 --> 01:52:12,765
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1309
01:52:12,865 --> 01:52:16,868
All it took was a spark.

1310
01:52:18,644 --> 01:52:21,534
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1311
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,623
Ingenious.

1312
01:52:23,723 --> 01:52:24,708
Like all great performers,

1313
01:52:24,808 --> 01:52:26,629
you saved your Pice de
rsistance for the end.

1314
01:52:26,729 --> 01:52:27,122
for the end.

1315
01:52:27,222 --> 01:52:30,290
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide...

1316
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:32,480
...and refined in the bellies of swine.

1317
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:35,700
Had it worked, your followers
in Parliament would have...

1318
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:39,696
...watched unharmed as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1319
01:52:39,796 --> 01:52:41,800
They didn't know you had
given them the antidote.

1320
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:43,880
Instead they would have believed
it was magic,

1321
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:46,450
and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.

1322
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:48,489
And the world would have followed.

1323
01:52:48,589 --> 01:52:51,113
Fear being the most
powerfull weapon of all.

1324
01:52:51,213 --> 01:52:52,500
powerful weapon of all.

1325
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:56,120
You'd better hope that it's
it's nothing more than superstition...

1326
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:59,404
...and that you performed
all the rituals perfectly.

1327
01:52:59,504 --> 01:53:02,224
The devil's due a soul, I'd say.

1328
01:53:03,472 --> 01:53:06,447
By God's sake, Holmes Cut me loose.

1329
01:53:16,769 --> 01:53:19,624
First,
the world will see you for what you are.

1330
01:53:19,724 --> 01:53:21,609
A fraud.

1331
01:53:21,709 --> 01:53:24,787
Then you will be hanged...
properly this time.

1332
01:53:24,887 --> 01:53:28,457
It's a long journey from here to the rope.

1333
01:54:18,891 --> 01:54:22,291
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.

1334
01:54:22,506 --> 01:54:24,506
I have.

1335
01:54:25,355 --> 01:54:27,355
Naked.

1336
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,040
A storm is coming.

1337
01:54:33,525 --> 01:54:36,330
Well... we've still got a moment.

1338
01:54:40,856 --> 01:54:43,025
Moriarty...
- What?

1339
01:54:44,182 --> 01:54:46,182
That's his name.

1340
01:54:46,563 --> 01:54:48,563
And he is a professor.

1341
01:54:50,526 --> 01:54:52,651
Everyone has a weak spot.

1342
01:54:53,391 --> 01:54:55,391
And he found mine.

1343
01:54:56,962 --> 01:54:59,002
Where was it, precisely?

1344
01:55:09,796 --> 01:55:12,431
Please don't underestimate him.

1345
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:15,729
He's just as brilliant as you are.

1346
01:55:15,829 --> 01:55:18,209
and infinitely more devious.

1347
01:55:18,641 --> 01:55:20,641
We'll see about that.

1348
01:55:36,862 --> 01:55:39,270
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1349
01:55:41,191 --> 01:55:44,167
Sadly... yes.

1350
01:56:12,527 --> 01:56:15,463
Afternoon, sir. I put the
notebooks in this one, sir.

1351
01:56:15,563 --> 01:56:16,198
Thank you.

1352
01:56:16,298 --> 01:56:17,854
What's in these, John?

1353
01:56:17,954 --> 01:56:19,954
Scribbles.
- Scribbles?

1354
01:56:20,105 --> 01:56:22,147
Notes.
- They're your adventures?

1355
01:56:22,247 --> 01:56:24,247
I'd like to read them.

1356
01:56:30,644 --> 01:56:31,667
Hold on. What's wrong?

1357
01:56:31,767 --> 01:56:34,306
Think he's finally come to terms
with you leaving?

1358
01:56:34,406 --> 01:56:37,551
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1359
01:56:38,281 --> 01:56:40,680
Now, five minutes here, and we'll go home.

1360
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:42,403
Our home.

1361
01:56:42,503 --> 01:56:44,503
Get up those stairs.

1362
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:54,130
Don't worry, dear.

1363
01:56:54,252 --> 01:56:58,343
Suicide is not in his repertoire.
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1364
01:56:58,443 --> 01:57:00,443
Holmes.

1365
01:57:02,289 --> 01:57:04,672
Oh.
Good afternoon.

1366
01:57:04,930 --> 01:57:08,543
I was trying to deduce the manner in which
Blackwood survived his execution.

1367
01:57:08,643 --> 01:57:10,980
Clearing our good names as well.

1368
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:13,533
But it had a surprising
supporous effect on me,

1369
01:57:13,633 --> 01:57:15,854
and I was carried off in
the arms of Morpheus.

1370
01:57:15,954 --> 01:57:19,034
Like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.

1371
01:57:19,134 --> 01:57:21,134
Get on with it, Holmes.

1372
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:24,735
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot
was a hook.

1373
01:57:24,835 --> 01:57:28,066
Oh dear, I think my legs have fallen asleep.
I should probably come down.

1374
01:57:28,166 --> 01:57:29,680
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1375
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:32,519
No, no, no, I hate to cut him off midstream.

1376
01:57:32,619 --> 01:57:34,619
Carry on.

1377
01:57:34,732 --> 01:57:37,784
Uh, well, the executioner attached
it to a harness...

1378
01:57:37,884 --> 01:57:40,168
...thus allowing the weight to be distributed
around the waist...

1379
01:57:40,268 --> 01:57:40,792
...and the neck...

1380
01:57:40,892 --> 01:57:42,537
...to remain intact.

1381
01:57:42,637 --> 01:57:44,191
Oh, my lord, I can't feel my cheeks.

1382
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:46,361
Might we continue this at ground level?

1383
01:57:46,461 --> 01:57:48,314
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1384
01:57:48,414 --> 01:57:52,485
I have managed it with braces, belts,
and a coat hook.

1385
01:57:52,585 --> 01:57:55,769
Please, Watson, my tongue is going
I'll be of no use to you at all.

1386
01:57:55,869 --> 01:57:58,674
Worse things could happen.
- John.

1387
01:58:00,838 --> 01:58:02,663
None of this explains.

1388
01:58:02,763 --> 01:58:04,973
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1389
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:07,979
Now, the medical mystery.

1390
01:58:08,079 --> 01:58:10,356
We must restore your reputation,
Watson.

1391
01:58:10,456 --> 01:58:14,397
There is a toxin refined from the
nectar of the rhododendron ponticum.

1392
01:58:14,497 --> 01:58:17,637
It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...

1393
01:58:17,737 --> 01:58:20,492
...for its ability to induce an
apparently mortal paralysis.

1394
01:58:20,592 --> 01:58:24,682
Enough to mislead a medical mind even as
tenacious and well-trained as your own.

1395
01:58:24,782 --> 01:58:26,514
It's known locally as...

1396
01:58:26,614 --> 01:58:28,134
What's wrong with Gladstone?

1397
01:58:28,234 --> 01:58:29,607
Mad honey disease..

1398
01:58:29,707 --> 01:58:33,454
He's demonstrating the very
effect I've just described.

1399
01:58:33,554 --> 01:58:35,554
He's all right.

1400
01:58:37,643 --> 01:58:40,767
Mary, don't worry. He's seen far worse.

1401
01:58:40,867 --> 01:58:42,867
Mr. Holmes?

1402
01:58:44,128 --> 01:58:46,128
Doctor, Miss Mary...

1403
01:58:46,131 --> 01:58:49,738
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that you
come with me right away.

1404
01:58:49,838 --> 01:58:51,457
What is it this time, Clarky?

1405
01:58:51,557 --> 01:58:53,611
It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1406
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:55,599
He went missing in the sewers
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1407
01:58:55,699 --> 01:59:00,187
I'm afraid sewage workers found
his body just this morning, sir.

1408
01:59:00,287 --> 01:59:03,749
We believe the sergeant
was the first man on the scene.

1409
01:59:03,849 --> 01:59:05,889
Can I help you, officer?

1410
01:59:06,007 --> 01:59:08,007
...shot in the head.

1411
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:11,670
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1412
01:59:11,953 --> 01:59:13,953
Yes.

1413
01:59:14,496 --> 01:59:16,582
Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?

1414
01:59:16,682 --> 01:59:18,682
Indeed, sir.

1415
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:22,272
Point blank range.

1416
01:59:22,372 --> 01:59:24,372
Moriarty.

1417
01:59:24,746 --> 01:59:26,746
Professor Moriarty.

1418
01:59:29,728 --> 01:59:31,508
There's a good boy.

1419
01:59:31,608 --> 01:59:34,158
Everything's going to be fine.

1420
01:59:34,507 --> 01:59:35,966
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1421
01:59:36,066 --> 01:59:37,656
Secret Service have it sir, sir.

1422
01:59:37,756 --> 01:59:39,513
They've taken over the case.

1423
01:59:39,613 --> 01:59:42,503
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1424
01:59:43,945 --> 01:59:47,251
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine.

1425
01:59:47,351 --> 01:59:48,477
Not the poison.

1426
01:59:48,577 --> 01:59:51,131
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1427
01:59:51,231 --> 01:59:54,060
The wire free invention
was the game all along.

1428
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,202
And Adler was just a diversion.

1429
01:59:56,302 --> 01:59:57,567
He knew I'd chase after her...

1430
01:59:57,667 --> 01:59:59,763
...thereby leaving the machine accessible.

1431
01:59:59,863 --> 02:00:03,704
The technology of that kind would
be worth an untold fortune.

1432
02:00:03,804 --> 02:00:09,820
Imagine being able to control any device
by sending a command by radio waves.

1433
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:11,960
It's the future, Watson.

1434
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:18,390
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1435
