1
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,527
I can't see

2
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,432
I really can't see

3
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,268
I still can't see

4
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,203
I can't see, I can't see, I can't see

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,108
You're loud

6
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,173
I can see now

7
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,181
What you see?

8
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,622
I see... 10 years later, maybe 8...

9
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,955
I'm with my daughter...

10
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,761
The good, pretty type...

11
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,758
Having tea with rich ladies

12
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,998
The sun is bright and warm

13
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,630
Then

14
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,905
My husband enters...

15
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,276
He's the type...

16
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,181
He's...

17
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,917
He's the type...

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,387
What? What type?

19
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,562
The type...

20
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,664
The type...

21
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,809
Why are you talking during PE class?

22
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,841
Get up, join the class!

23
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,885
Why you ran over there? You crazy?

24
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,655
Don't you want to know who my husband is?

25
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,918
Who?

26
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,153
The one I just jogged around

27
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,565
Who?

28
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,724
The cutest one

29
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,406
Him

30
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,511
What?

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,581
The one in the color shirt

32
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,881
Zhang Shihao, Class 975

33
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,596
Want to bet?

34
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,868
What's the bet?

35
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,769
3-point Shot

36
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,211
Silly

37
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,677
5-point shot

38
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,040
You're too silly

39
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,686
Hey!

40
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,783
Let's bet...

41
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,926
That you'd jerk off at schoolyard

42
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,258
OK, how much?

43
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,161
You're cheap

44
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,897
2,000!

45
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,232
You crazy?

46
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,138
2,000? You go jerk!

47
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,249
Then... you pay my class fee

48
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,744
Fine, how much?

49
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,719
1,200

50
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,055
Hey, young man jerking off!

51
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:13,824
Come look!

52
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,440
I found it

53
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,882
You don't play basketball

54
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,211
I sometimes do

55
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,411
Hello... what you want?

56
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,815
I'm studying English

57
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,278
It's late, where you wanna go?

58
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,685
Don't want to

59
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,788
Don't want to

60
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,990
Dear Diary

61
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,684
I must be the happiest guy in the world

62
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,485
My classmates and I...

63
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:22,033
I'm leaving

64
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,637
I'm putting on my shoes

65
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,397
Where're you?

66
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,540
Walking through the traffic light

67
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,641
Hurry

68
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,380
Let me tell you about

69
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:46,287
The places we visited...

70
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,703
Bring me red bean ice with milk

71
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,272
Hello... Get up, it's dark

72
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,341
Hello, hello, hello...

73
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,350
So you're here

74
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,587
Where you wanna go so late?

75
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,881
Guess

76
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,860
Uhh...

77
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,597
Come look at Zhang Shihao with me

78
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,496
Don't want to

79
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,565
Please

80
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,463
Don't want to

81
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,103
Please

82
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,397
Please?

83
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,664
Beg me

84
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,469
OK, I'm begging you

85
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,872
You have to beg!

86
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,206
Hurry

87
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:41,971
Hurry up!

88
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,274
Don't want to!

89
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,483
Please, come with me

90
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,594
Shihao sneaks in every night to swim

91
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,265
He's in the swim team

92
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,001
Can't see anything!

93
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,572
You can listen to him swim

94
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,377
You really like him

95
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,281
But...

96
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,985
Does he have a girlfriend?

97
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,347
Of course he has

98
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,091
Would he like me?

99
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,193
Of course not!

100
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,224
Then...

101
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,262
- You find out for me
- Don't want to!

102
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,127
- Please
- Don't want to!

103
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,666
- Please
-Don't want to!

104
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,336
- Pretty please
- Don't want to!

105
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,530
Please

106
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,463
Don't want to!

107
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,609
Hey, Zhang Shihao, you have a girlfriend?

108
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,742
Hey, Zhang Shihao

109
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,915
My friend wants to know you

110
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,643
You have a girlfriend?

111
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,043
Zhang Shihao?

112
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,881
Did you hear me?

113
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,213
My friend wants to know you

114
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,415
Zhang Shihao!

115
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,753
You have a girlfriend?

116
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,294
My friend wants to know you

117
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,101
Hey, Zhang Shihao!

118
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,704
- Hey, Zhang Shihao?
- Don't shout!

119
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,031
If the campus guard sees us

120
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,038
We'll be punished

121
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:18,872
You have a girlfriend?

122
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,932
It was you yelling?

123
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,735
My friend wants to know you

124
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,605
Who?

125
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,974
Hey, who wants to know me?

126
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,050
She wants to know if you're interested

127
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,708
Who is she?

128
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,855
You interested?

129
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,386
But who's she?

130
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,115
But are you interested?

131
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,385
I have to know who she is

132
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,361
Who is she?

133
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,320
Yuezhen!

134
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,027
Yuezhen!

135
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,126
Yuezhen!

136
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,528
Yuezhen! Come out!

137
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,626
Yuezhen! Come out!

138
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,502
Lin Yuezhen!

139
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,339
Lin Yuezhen!

140
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,111
There's no Lin Yuezhen, is there?

141
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,348
It's you who wants to know me

142
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:44,885
Yuezhen...

143
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,388
Come out

144
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:47,654
Yuezhen...

145
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,087
Come out

146
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,031
Lin Yuezhen

147
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,028
There's no Lin Yuezhen, is there?

148
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,865
It's you who wants to know me

149
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,447
I'm Zhang Shihao

150
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,551
Scorpio, type O

151
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,345
Swim team, Guitar Society

152
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,714
Come on!

153
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,445
Come on!

154
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,453
Let me see

155
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,324
Come on!

156
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,770
Zhang Shihao's basketball

157
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,134
I took it

158
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,488
His shoes

159
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,118
Big feet

160
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,254
Must be 101

161
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,902
How did you get his diary?

162
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,312
Ugly handwriting

163
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,478
Turning in homework at the office

164
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,310
I saw it and took it

165
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,911
What's this?

166
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:32,946
I made it

167
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,889
You like to draw hearts?

168
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,398
This?

169
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,029
A bottle he drank from

170
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,401
You saved a bottle he drank from?

171
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,634
Don't throw it

172
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,507
His goggles

173
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,524
His pen

174
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,370
I'd liked him for so long

175
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,174
Could only secretly take his photo

176
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,212
Picked up his junk

177
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,111
Am I a wimp?

178
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,294
I'm going home

179
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,954
Don't want you to

180
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:44,747
"Hope to be your friend."

181
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:50,657
"From Meng Kerou."

182
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,502
What?

183
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,949
Help me

184
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,947
Don't want to!

185
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,353
Help me

186
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,503
I won

187
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:20,714
It's for you

188
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,148
What's that?

189
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,078
The prize I win?

190
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:33,794
Hey, I'm Zhang Shihao

191
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:34,796
Scorpio, type O

192
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,362
Swim team, Guitar Society

193
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,776
Hi, Zhang Shihao

194
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,813
We're in the same school

195
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,012
See you at school often

196
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:01,819
Always took a second look

197
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,618
And look forward to...

198
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,663
Seeing you in school everyday

199
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,959
Always feel you're a nice boy

200
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,564
I thought about this a long time

201
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,205
Finally decided to write this...

202
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,008
The dean's office reporting

203
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,806
The dean's office reporting

204
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,948
Class 975, Zhang Shihao

205
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,413
Class 975, Zhang Shihao

206
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,712
Class 968, Meng Kerou

207
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,287
Class 968, Meng Kerou

208
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,118
Report to the office immediately

209
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,006
"Look forward to your reply."

210
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:26,074
"You must reply."

211
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,772
"Gross!"

212
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,942
Sorry

213
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:33,716
I didn't paste the letter

214
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,216
It's Mien

215
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,179
I didn't write the letter

216
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,756
It's Lin Yuezhen

217
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,626
There's no Lin Yuezhen, is there?

218
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,561
It's you who wants to know me

219
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:56,904
I'm Zhang Shihao

220
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,042
Scorpio, type O

221
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,007
Swim team, Guitar Society

222
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,540
I'm not bad

223
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,514
Now, the plural

224
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,517
Housewives

225
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,121
Fine, take a look

226
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,350
The change in plural form

227
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,153
"fe" becomes "ves"

228
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,261
Like "knife"

229
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,398
Why you wrote the letter in my name?

230
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,760
Now, the next word

231
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,926
Ambition

232
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,966
Why you wrote the letter in my name?

233
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,205
Good, we went over
using "ion" to end nouns

234
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,777
What're you doing, Meng Kerou?

235
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,016
Why you wrote the letter in my name?

236
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,046
Pick up the book

237
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,484
What's with you two?

238
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,685
Meng Kerou, want dinner?

239
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,763
Meng Kerou, want dinner?

240
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,137
Meng Kerou

241
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,307
20 dumplings

242
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,614
Our dumplings are big

243
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,341
I think 15 is enough

244
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,178
Oh, OK

245
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,181
Want some soup?

246
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,581
Hot and sour soup? Egg drop?

247
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,125
Bean curd veggie soup

248
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,820
Hot and sour

249
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,529
I think bean curd and veggie is better

250
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,030
You boys don't like veggie

251
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,901
OK, fine

252
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,969
So you go to NTNU High?

253
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,164
Yes

254
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,433
My daughter too, she's Meng Kerou

255
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,438
You heard of her?

256
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,804
Yes, an unusual name

257
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,875
Bad name

258
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,410
Kerou means overcoming softness

259
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,073
Didn't you name her?

260
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,246
No, her grandpa

261
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,311
Oh...

262
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:09,384
(Gross.)

263
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,517
What's today's test on?

264
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,187
What's the test on?

265
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,891
58 to 67

266
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,985
58 to 67

267
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,131
So much?

268
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,733
It's on the chapter teacher taught

269
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,837
Lots of new words

270
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,008
You haven't memorized it

271
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,075
Indeed I haven't

272
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,676
How do you say this?

273
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,312
Deliverable

274
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,849
Deliverable

275
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,247
And this?

276
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,920
Communication

277
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,916
Communication

278
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,984
Memorize, test coming up

279
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,807
What do you want?

280
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,078
I'm swim team and Guitar Society

281
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,307
Not bad looking

282
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,714
What's wrong with me?

283
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,354
What do you want?

284
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,324
I'm courting you

285
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:58,846
Thank you

286
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,990
I'll make some for you sometime

287
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,285
Thank you. Bye

288
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,894
I ate and I'm going home

289
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,493
Hey... Hey!

290
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,479
What do you want?

291
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,489
I'm courting you

292
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,124
I'm trouble

293
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,791
So am I

294
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:57,243
(Oh, oh, oh, party girl)

295
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,950
(Stand in the middle)

296
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,915
(Stand next to me)

297
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:08,016
(I'll give you a love encouragement)

298
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,921
(And sing you a rock n' roll song)

299
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,327
(And we won't cry again)

300
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,140
You like this music?

301
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,745
Ah... me too

302
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,477
Can you hear what they sing?

303
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:35,985
Yes

304
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,845
Oh, I can too

305
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,952
Is it boring going out with me?

306
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,255
I'm usually not this boring

307
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,728
I don't know you, or I'm lots of fun

308
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,312
You want to kiss me?

309
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,914
You... what you said?

310
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,920
Here?

311
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,130
Aren't girls shy?

312
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,465
Uh, I am too

313
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,590
Let's go swimming

314
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,455
OK?

315
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,391
- You know how?
- I don't

316
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,327
- I'll teach you
- Don't want to

317
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,435
- Let's go
- Don't want to

318
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,798
Let's go, let's go

319
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,364
- Don't want to
- Quick

320
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,334
Quick

321
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,203
Quick

322
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,920
Lin Yuezhen please

323
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,024
I...

324
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,461
Jog here every day

325
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,256
Drink a bottle of water and jog back

326
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,693
Here

327
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,424
Teacher...

328
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,890
Does this count as kissing?

329
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,360
What?

330
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,399
Our lips touched the same bottle

331
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,036
How can this be kissing?

332
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,603
Of course it's not kissing

333
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,007
You want to kiss me, Teacher?

334
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,084
You're a child, not grown up...

335
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,618
Stop thinking such nonsense

336
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,788
Well, do you want to kiss me?

337
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,345
Boys and girls can't hold hands in school

338
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,449
Zhang Shihao

339
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,087
I like to speak to Meng Kerou

340
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,858
Weird, what does he want?

341
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,598
What did you want the other day?

342
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,824
Nothing

343
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,932
I know who wrote "gross" on your desk

344
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:42,900
Who?

345
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,742
It's her

346
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,811
I thought you were going to beat her up

347
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,451
Coward

348
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:32,611
You know...

349
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,655
Why she wrote that on your desk?

350
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,122
How'd I know?

351
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,193
She likes Zhang Shihao too

352
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,795
Then she should write "gross" on your desk

353
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,597
How are you with Zhang Shihao?

354
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,326
Nothing between us

355
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,572
So what I heard was rumor?

356
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,196
Yes, rumor

357
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,007
What rumor?

358
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,580
Bye

359
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,808
Bye

360
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,582
Don't ride so fast!

361
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:08,247
I ate and I'm going home

362
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,401
Zhang Shihao

363
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,550
Zhang Shihao

364
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,223
Zhang Shihao

365
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,858
Please don't follow me after school

366
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,231
And don't come to the dumpling store

367
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,526
And don't come to see me, please

368
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,136
What's the meaning of that?

369
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,408
I won't like you

370
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,612
What's wrong with me?

371
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:41,711
Why did you ask me to kiss you?

372
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,078
Don't you understand?

373
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,079
I just won't like you

374
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,809
Then why did you hold my hand?

375
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,449
Why?

376
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,284
Why?

377
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,957
No reason!

378
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,524
What's with you and the PE teacher?

379
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,224
Don't be silly

380
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,995
Then...

381
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,397
Why did you ask me to kiss you?

382
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,706
Give it a rest

383
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,972
Hey, why did you asked me to kiss you?

384
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:23,382
Hello! Hello?

385
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:25,849
Then why did you...

386
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,288
Why did you ask me to kiss you?

387
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,360
Why did you ask me to kiss you?

388
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:52,914
Speak! Why don't you speak?

389
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,311
Hey! Why did you ask me to kiss you?

390
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,452
Tell me a secret

391
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,312
Why?

392
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,288
Tell me a secret

393
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,094
Quick.

394
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,630
Tell me a secret

395
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,096
Secret?

396
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:19,201
You really want to know?

397
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,077
I don't like swimming

398
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,978
I may stay in the pool all day

399
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,217
But it's boring, all by yourself

400
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,886
Any other sport one does by oneself?

401
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,187
Many sports you do by yourself

402
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,223
But swimming is cool

403
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,738
But I want to win in swimming

404
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,769
And I want a college scholarship

405
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,706
What are you talking about?

406
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,140
A secret

407
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,871
Bull

408
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,845
What kind of secret was that?

409
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:00,881
Not a secret?

410
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,609
Not a secret. Think again

411
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:09,992
I'm still a virgin

412
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,425
Many are still virgins

413
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,358
That's not true.

414
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,122
Those who talk big usually are.

415
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,459
Think again

416
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,708
I don't know

417
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,911
What you want me to say?

418
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,047
A secret!

419
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,682
Secret?

420
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,379
Secret...

421
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,387
I'm really goin' to say

422
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,385
My pee splits

423
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:43,824
What?

424
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,693
When I pee, it splits!

425
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,098
Like a showerhead

426
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,029
Never a straight line

427
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,069
Don't know why

428
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,770
May be the opening is too big

429
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,804
Don't tell others

430
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,106
OK, fair

431
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,607
Then I'll tell you a secret

432
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,769
Good

433
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,372
Where you going?

434
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,813
Don't come over

435
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,811
Don't come over

436
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,521
This way I'm less afraid to tell

437
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,485
Don't come over

438
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,528
I'm very good to Yuezhen

439
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,699
There's no Yuezhen, is there?

440
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,271
There is. She likes you

441
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,043
And?

442
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:46,322
I'm really good to Yuezhen

443
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,619
Helped her a lot

444
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,195
Helped her to look you up at the pool

445
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,889
Sent letter for her

446
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,902
And took the rap for her

447
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,500
I was helping her all along

448
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,240
Because...

449
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,771
I really like her

450
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,283
I think, I like girls

451
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,157
That's why I won't like you

452
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,824
You are a good person

453
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,095
I don't want to hurt you

454
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,371
This is the worse excuse I'd heard

455
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,009
What excuse?

456
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,968
Excuse turning people down

457
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,777
Next time I see Yuezhen

458
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,643
I'll tell her I'm gay

459
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,943
You don't have to believe me

460
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,483
I don't believe you.

461
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,159
Then why go out with me?

462
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,791
Why did you hold my hand?

463
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,468
Why asked me to kiss you?

464
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:09,729
I thought...

465
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,306
If I get over kissing boys

466
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,738
Then I'm not

467
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,636
What about the PE teacher?

468
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,979
He was unlucky

469
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,209
I asked him to kiss me too

470
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,057
That's it

471
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:34,486
Maybe...

472
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,532
If you really do kiss a boy

473
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,937
Then you won't feel like a lesbian

474
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,804
You want to kiss me?

475
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,678
You got the feeling?

476
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,364
Want another kiss?

477
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:49,963
Are you still a lesbian?

478
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,703
Does this mean...

479
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,438
We're breaking up?

480
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:16,123
Hey, this mean we're breaking up?

481
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,132
Hey, this mean we're breaking up?

482
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:28,004
Hey, this mean we're breaking up?

483
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:54,265
"Zhang Shihao. Zhang Shihao."

484
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,704
You really didn't go out
with Zhang Shihao?

485
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:06,848
Really didn't

486
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,342
Let me show you something

487
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:22,998
What're you doing?

488
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,461
I'd been writing his name with his pen

489
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,570
When the ink dries

490
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,506
He'll fall in love with me

491
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,307
You're smart

492
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,804
The ink is almost dry

493
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:47,720
You really didn't go out with Shihao?

494
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,453
How many times had I said it?

495
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,556
Introduce me!

496
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,633
Don't want to!

497
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,468
You know him anyway

498
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,560
It won't hurt you introducing me

499
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:03,465
It's nothing introducing me

500
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,538
Please

501
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,168
Don't want to

502
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:10,040
Please, since you know him

503
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,012
Please

504
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,388
What if he dislike me?

505
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:20,921
No he won't

506
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:23,923
Really won't?

507
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,652
Really won't

508
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,313
Zhang Shihao

509
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,281
Zhang Shihao, this is Lin Yuezhen

510
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,489
She wants to know you

511
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,388
You want to go out with her?

512
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,865
Go over, quick

513
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,576
OK, my job is done

514
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:14,903
I'm leaving

515
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,204
Wait, what am I to do?

516
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:20,111
What're you doing? What is this?

517
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,211
OK, I waited

518
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,384
I'll call you

519
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:51,533
This is it

520
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:52,800
Bye

521
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:56,906
Zhang Shihao

522
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,972
Can we... go out?

523
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:03,849
Sorry

524
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:32,204
Meng Kerou!

525
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,147
Who?

526
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,242
You want Meng Kerou?

527
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,424
Hey...

528
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:09,879
Where's Yuezhen?

529
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,018
Where's Yuezhen?

530
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,154
Isn't she cute?

531
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:20,957
What's the meaning of that?

532
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,527
What is it you mean?

533
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,134
You took her home, didn't you?

534
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,337
What's the meaning of that?

535
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,708
It's boy-love-girl...

536
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,978
girl-love-boy with you

537
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,944
What else can that mean?

538
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,211
What's the meaning?

539
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,578
What's the meaning?

540
00:58:56,663 --> 00:58:58,028
What's the meaning?

541
00:59:17,084 --> 00:59:18,574
What's the meaning of that?

542
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:23,815
What's the meaning of that?

543
01:00:28,088 --> 01:00:29,487
Don't you like Yuezhen?

544
01:00:34,294 --> 01:00:36,125
I won't like Yuezhen

545
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,695
I just won't like Yuezhen

546
01:00:47,508 --> 01:00:48,839
I won't like girls

547
01:02:59,972 --> 01:03:03,100
It won't work, we already kissed

548
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:08,407
So...

549
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:10,575
Had you kissed Yuezhen?

550
01:03:11,384 --> 01:03:12,408
No

551
01:03:15,187 --> 01:03:16,518
Does Yuezhen know?

552
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:18,857
Don't know

553
01:03:19,725 --> 01:03:22,091
I'd tell her if it's me

554
01:03:26,399 --> 01:03:27,866
Tell her... Then...

555
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:32,529
Maybe we won't be friends anymore

556
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:39,970
Not everyone can be like you

557
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:46,573
Life is unfair

558
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:00,825
Sorry

559
01:04:02,802 --> 01:04:04,064
For what?

560
01:04:05,004 --> 01:04:07,564
If... you're 17

561
01:04:07,907 --> 01:04:12,401
And you only think about entering college

562
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:13,944
And you're not a virgin

563
01:04:15,247 --> 01:04:17,408
And your pee doesn't split

564
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,245
You'd be such a lucky child

565
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:47,190
"Zhang Shihao. Zhang Shihao."

566
01:06:55,174 --> 01:07:08,144
"Kimura Takuya. Kimura Takuya."

567
01:07:29,942 --> 01:07:32,706
It's a very up-scale restaurant

568
01:07:32,878 --> 01:07:35,005
I'd never been there

569
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:39,249
It was dark, very romantic

570
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:41,312
With live piano

571
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,956
A scent of lavender in the air

572
01:07:45,891 --> 01:07:48,189
Waiters in black tuxedo

573
01:07:48,294 --> 01:07:50,489
Walking around busily

574
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:52,555
We sat there 'till 9:30

575
01:07:52,731 --> 01:07:54,392
Yuezhen?

576
01:07:57,603 --> 01:08:00,367
Zhang Shihao wanted to go to my place

577
01:08:00,606 --> 01:08:02,096
I took him home

578
01:08:02,608 --> 01:08:06,567
He went straight to my bed and sat

579
01:08:06,645 --> 01:08:07,839
Yuezhen?

580
01:08:08,113 --> 01:08:09,774
What?

581
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,451
Then...

582
01:08:17,756 --> 01:08:19,690
My mom... she came home

583
01:08:19,858 --> 01:08:22,053
Yuezhen...

584
01:08:26,966 --> 01:08:29,059
Yuezhen...

585
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:41,235
"I'm a girl, I love boys."

586
01:09:59,858 --> 01:10:01,018
Hi.

587
01:10:01,193 --> 01:10:02,558
Ignore my friends.

588
01:10:02,728 --> 01:10:04,093
They're so bad.

589
01:10:32,257 --> 01:10:34,225
Oh, you haven't told me your name

590
01:10:41,266 --> 01:10:42,858
What kind of boys do you like?

591
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:44,831
It depends on feelings.

592
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:46,830
What about me?

593
01:10:50,642 --> 01:10:52,109
I...

594
01:10:57,783 --> 01:10:58,772
Hello? It's me

595
01:11:03,355 --> 01:11:04,913
It's nothing.

596
01:11:07,826 --> 01:11:09,316
Only...

597
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:12,057
I remember I have a meet Wednesday

598
01:11:12,331 --> 01:11:14,265
Hope you'll come

599
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:16,398
Oh, also...

600
01:11:18,036 --> 01:11:19,799
I want to say...

601
01:11:21,106 --> 01:11:26,305
Are you crying?

602
01:11:31,116 --> 01:11:32,310
Don't cry

603
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:36,312
Let's go.

604
01:11:36,455 --> 01:11:37,922
I'll keep you company, OK?

605
01:11:39,057 --> 01:11:40,524
Come on. Don't cry

606
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,229
Hey, let's go

607
01:11:47,032 --> 01:11:48,192
Let's go, come on.

608
01:13:10,616 --> 01:13:12,811
There you go again, sleeping over here

609
01:13:13,018 --> 01:13:14,815
Let me sleep next to you

610
01:13:16,655 --> 01:13:18,282
What happened?

611
01:13:18,724 --> 01:13:19,816
Nothing

612
01:13:21,393 --> 01:13:22,724
Tell!

613
01:13:27,466 --> 01:13:29,161
When Dad left

614
01:13:30,469 --> 01:13:32,437
How did you survive?

615
01:13:34,906 --> 01:13:39,366
So, you had your heart broken?

616
01:13:40,312 --> 01:13:43,873
The boy who came for dumpling?

617
01:13:46,418 --> 01:13:47,749
It's OK

618
01:13:47,919 --> 01:13:49,853
Whose heart had not been broken?

619
01:13:50,022 --> 01:13:52,490
How did you survive?

620
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:57,350
Don't know, just survived

621
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:00,691
I really don't know

622
01:14:04,836 --> 01:14:07,031
Just survived

623
01:14:09,174 --> 01:14:11,608
I hope I'll see that day soon

624
01:15:18,677 --> 01:15:20,645
Let's go, Zhang Shihao!

625
01:15:20,812 --> 01:15:22,143
Let's go!

626
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:28,114
Zhang Shihao of NTNU High in lane 3

627
01:15:32,591 --> 01:15:35,685
Yau Zhixiang of East High in lane 4

628
01:15:53,245 --> 01:15:54,269
On your mark...

629
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:34,079
One, two, three...

630
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:44,695
Smile, AB...

631
01:16:44,863 --> 01:16:46,296
C!

632
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:48,961
This is funny

633
01:16:54,372 --> 01:16:59,639
Smile, uhhhhh

634
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,096
Hey, why didn't you come?

635
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:25,767
You swam well?

636
01:17:27,806 --> 01:17:31,298
Terrible... good thing you didn't come

637
01:17:39,985 --> 01:17:41,179
I feel bad

638
01:17:41,987 --> 01:17:43,386
Summer is almost over

639
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:45,021
Feels like I haven't done anything

640
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:50,022
Yeah, felt like just running around

641
01:17:50,896 --> 01:17:52,329
Haven't done anything

642
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:57,028
Haven't won a single meat

643
01:17:57,202 --> 01:17:58,794
Haven't done anything

644
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:08,437
What's on your mind?

645
01:18:08,947 --> 01:18:10,278
What is on your mind?

646
01:18:14,986 --> 01:18:17,147
But you must've left something

647
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:19,287
Whatever we left behind...

648
01:18:19,457 --> 01:18:20,947
Whatever grown-up we'd become

649
01:18:22,294 --> 01:18:24,125
Where did you steal that line?

650
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,932
I'm going home

651
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:41,168
I'm going home too

652
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,684
I won

653
01:19:01,066 --> 01:19:02,328
I won again

654
01:19:05,203 --> 01:19:06,431
Won again

655
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:07,729
I won

656
01:19:08,607 --> 01:19:09,801
You won

657
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:18,012
Hey...

658
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,045
That day on the phone...

659
01:19:20,318 --> 01:19:21,808
I wanted to say...

660
01:19:23,688 --> 01:19:25,019
Maybe some day...

661
01:19:26,157 --> 01:19:29,092
A year later, or maybe three

662
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:31,491
If you start liking boys

663
01:19:32,497 --> 01:19:34,124
You must tell me

664
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:38,831
Don't laugh

665
01:19:40,372 --> 01:19:41,634
I'm serious

666
01:20:10,468 --> 01:20:13,596
Shihao, seeing your flying color shirt

667
01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:15,103
I'm thinking...

668
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:18,309
One year, 3 years, 5 years from now...

669
01:20:18,476 --> 01:20:20,467
What would we become?

670
01:20:21,413 --> 01:20:23,973
You're kind and cheerful

671
01:20:24,249 --> 01:20:25,716
You'd be more handsome

672
01:20:26,317 --> 01:20:28,751
And I can see... years from now...

673
01:20:29,054 --> 01:20:31,614
You're in front of a blue gate

674
01:20:31,723 --> 01:20:33,623
The 3 p.m. Sun

675
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,657
You still have a few zits

676
01:20:36,194 --> 01:20:38,822
You're smiling and I run to greet you

677
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:40,328
You nod

678
01:20:41,332 --> 01:20:43,630
3 or 5 years later

679
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:46,396
Or even later, much later

680
01:20:46,938 --> 01:20:49,202
What kind of grown-up would we be?

681
01:20:50,041 --> 01:20:52,908
PE teacher? Or Mom?

682
01:20:53,712 --> 01:20:54,736
Though I can't see myself...

683
01:20:54,979 --> 01:20:58,437
even with eyes closed

684
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:02,247
But I can see you

685
01:21:41,726 --> 01:21:46,993
"I'm a girl, I love boys."

686
01:21:50,268 --> 01:21:56,070
"Zhang Shihao was here."

687
01:21:56,241 --> 01:21:59,677
"I was here."
