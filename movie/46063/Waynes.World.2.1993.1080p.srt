1
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,790
Extreme close-up!

2
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:48,005
Whoa!

3
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,299
Okay. All right.

4
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,594
All right. So, here we are
in our new surroundings,

5
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,682
the abandoned Acme doll factory
in downtown Aurora, lllinois.

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,143
We now have an official babe lair.

7
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,520
l know, man.
This place is gonna be chick central.

8
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,440
l feel sorry for guys who still have to
live with their parents, you know?

9
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:09,110
Okay. You've probably noticed by now
that we're on a little early tonight.

10
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:13,406
Usually at this time on Aurora Cable,
you're watching Plant World.

11
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,783
But they didn't want our 10:30 time slot.

12
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,121
But we were able to talk Plant World
into changing with Cooking World.

13
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,582
Although, they didn't want to
change at first.

14
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,752
But fortunately,
White Supremacy World was canceled,

15
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,420
and all the trades worked out.

16
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,756
And finally, the reason we're on early

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,592
is because we're going
to a concert tonight in Chicago.

18
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,510
-Excellent.
-Yes.

19
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,930
And did l mention that we will be seeing

20
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,057
-Aerosmith?
-Aerosmith.

21
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,769
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

22
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,355
All right, okay. So, until next week,
good night, and party on.

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,524
-Party on, Wayne!
-Party on, Garth.

24
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,818
lt's Wayne's World, Wayne's World

25
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,154
Party time, excellent

26
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,118
And we're out.

27
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,621
-All right, okay!
-All right! Let's move, people!

28
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,874
All right. Garth, to the Mirthmobile.

29
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,042
The Mirthmobile!

30
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,845
-All right.
-All right.

31
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,649
Hi. l'm Wayne Campbell.

32
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,983
Excellent.

33
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,902
Welcome to Wayne's World 2.

34
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,905
Let me bring you up to speed. Come on.

35
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,245
There's a lot to tell you,
so let's take the scenic route.

36
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,752
A year has passed.
l'm a little older. l'm a little wiser.

37
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,506
l'm starting to get hair
in really weird places, man.

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,425
l feel like l'm turning into Sasquatch.

39
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,011
l still go out with
my girlfriend Cassandra.

40
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,888
She's cutting a record demo
right now, man.

41
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,307
Her career's really taking off.

42
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,893
You remember Cassandra, don't you?

43
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,104
Ah.

44
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,022
Cassandra.

45
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,317
Schwing !

46
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,027
What a babe.

47
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,071
She'd give a dog a bone.

48
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,743
But, you know,
even though l live on my own now,

49
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,372
everybody's really hassling me
to do something with my life, you know?

50
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,207
To become an adult.

51
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,336
l feel like l'm in a
John Hughes rite de passage movie.

52
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,549
But what l'd really like to do
is something extraordinary,

53
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,634
something big, something mega,

54
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,221
something copious, something
capacious, something cajunga.

55
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,598
But. . .

56
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,475
l'll probably end up working
at Great America,

57
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,978
mopping up hurl and lung butter.

58
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,354
Yeah.

59
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,444
Huh?

60
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,367
You remember my best friend
Garth Algar, right?

61
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,745
Oh, l almost forgot.

62
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,623
This year, Garth finally got pubes.

63
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,256
You didn't tell them about my pubes,
did you?

64
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,592
No, of course not.

65
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,433
You are listening to WPIG, The Pig,

66
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,186
all rock, all the time.

67
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,815
Hey, Handsome Dan coming at you

68
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,734
at five on the short side
of nine bells here,

69
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,820
from WPIG, America's rock authority

70
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,865
What do you say
we check in with Mr. Scream?

71
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,633
God, Handsome Dan is so cool.
He must get a million chicks.

72
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,302
l bet he's totally studly and buffed.

73
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,931
With a voice like that, man,
he's gotta be a babe magnet.

74
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,694
Welcome to Mikita's.
How may I serve you?

75
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,488
Yes.

76
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,909

and a Mikita. . .cup.

77
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,706
And then l think l would like

78
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,420

-What?
-Oh, l'm sorry.

81
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,927
And. . .peaker. . .oken.

82
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,595
Oh, well, let me try to recap the order.

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,930
A cruller, two Sugar Pucks,

86
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,310

87
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,730
Yeah.

88
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,107
Thank you. Drive around, please.

89
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,743
l'm so psyched for this concert, man.
Aerosmith's gonna kick ass!

90
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,124
But where are we
supposed to meet Cassandra?

91
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,209
Cha-ching ! Cha-ching !

92
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,627
Backstage laminates.

93
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,087
Whoa!

94
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,935
-Encore! Encore! Encore!
-Encore! Encore! Encore!

95
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,086
Let's go.

96
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,385
Garth ! Somebody just grabbed my butt!

97
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,054
All right, we're on !

98
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,014
l feel weird.

99
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,398
lt's like 1 ,000 fingers
urging you to let go.

100
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,984
l'm having fun.

101
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,402
Excellent!

102
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,409
Hold tight.

103
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,088
You guys wail !

104
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,924
-You guys rule, baby!
-Lunch is here!

So do you !

106
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,806
Goat is here.

00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,269
Coming by, man.
Excuse me! Excuse me.

108
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,313
Where is the backstage area?

109
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,659
Excuse us. Excuse me.

110
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,918
Okay. Cool.

111
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,927
Oh, there she is. Hey, Cassandra!

112
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,471
Hey, Campbell !

113
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,645
-Hey, Campbell !
-Hey, there she is.

114
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,022
Sorry we couldn't sit together.

115
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,816
Oh, no troubles, bubbles.
Great concert, huh?

116
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,235
l want you to meet somebody.

117
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,987
Wayne, Garth,
this is Bobby Cahn of Sharpe Records.

118
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,072
Excellent.

119
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,198
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

120
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,616
Bobby's my record producer.

121
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,243
He's been working
with me and the band.

122
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,662
Well, we must drop by the studio.

123
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,040
Of course, l don't have to tell you
how extremely talented Cassandra is.

124
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,875
l mean, you've heard,
you've seen, you know.

125
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,086
Definitely. Scott! Scottie.

126
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,048
l want you to meet someone.
Cassandra, this is Scott.

127
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,800
-Hi.
-Hi.

128
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,843
-Dwayne.
-Actually, Wayne.

129
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:55,928
All right.

130
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,514
Bobby tells me you are very,
very talented.

131
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,266
l was just saying the exact same thing.

132
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,851
Scott, l wanna ask you something.

133
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,482
Don't you hate schmoozing?

134
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,901
Oh, yes. l just despise it.

135
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,156
Stand back, please.

136
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,456
-We're not worthy!
-We're not worthy!

137
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,167
You're worthy, you're worthy. Get up.

138
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,128
You guys were excellent tonight.

139
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,130
Hey, thanks a lot. We'll see you inside.

140
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,382
-We're planning on it.
-Hey, all right. All right.

141
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,550
Whoa.

142
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,264
-Excellent.
-Gotcha. Great.

143
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,099
Hold on.

144
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,518
Excuse me.

145
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:45,853
Wow.

146
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,734
Oh. . . Oh, jeez. Wayne, look.

147
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,695
Garth, it's Heather Locklear.

148
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,573
And she's signaling to us.

149
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,366
There is a god.

150
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,660
Heather be thy name.

151
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,914
-Schwing.
-Schwing.

152
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,043
-Bobby!
-Heather.

153
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,254
-Are you coming?
-Oh, yeah, we're. . .

154
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,548
-This is Cassandra.
-Hello.

155
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,592
We're supposed to be in there.

156
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,427
No, you're not.

157
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,970
My girlfriend's in there.

158
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,182
Hey, a lot of people's girlfriends
are in there.

159
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,476
-Denied.
-Denied.

160
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,041
Hi ! Where are you from?

00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,461
l'm from Cicero.
lsn't it cool to be downtown?

162
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,215
Hey, are you those two guys
who have that TV show in Aurora?

163
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,926
-Wayne's World? Wayne's World.
-Wayne's World. Party time.

164
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,135
No!

165
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,013
Oh. You guys sure look like them.

166
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,058
Look, if Wayne says we're not,
we're not, okay?

167
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,351
Okay.

168
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,270
How long does it take
for you to get here from Aurora?

169
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,564
lt takes me 40 minutes door to door.

170
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,233
My ma gave me a dollar

171
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,402
and dropped me off
at the park-and-ride.

172
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,077
Dogs. Dogs.

173
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,289
And Marilyn.

174
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,083
Marilyn. . .

175
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,378
lt's all a creature.

176
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,255
Let's all look at your. . .

177
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,848
Who are you?

178
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,683
l'm Jim Morrison.

179
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,059
Cool.

180
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,728
Who's he?

181
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,147
A weird naked lndian.

182
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,316
Cool.

183
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,403
Why have you brought me here?

184
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,323
To help you find some answers, Wayne.

185
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,158
Answers to what?

186
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,409
Ask me a question.

187
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,412
Okay. Two trains
are traveling at 60 miles an hour,

188
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,164
one from Chicago,
one from Los Angeles. . .

189
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,000
No, ask me a question about your life.

190
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,587
What am l supposed to do with my life?

191
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,424
You should put on a concert
in Aurora, Wayne.

192
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,302
How am l gonna get the bands to come?

193
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,888
lf you book them, they will come.

194
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,600
But l don't know anything
about putting on a concert.

195
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,895
You must go to England
and find a man named Del Preston.

196
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,355
He's the greatest roadie that ever lived.

197
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,274
He was with us
in the good times and the bad.

198
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,360
He will help you.

199
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,278
Any more questions?

200
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,074
Will Garth ever get
his Sports Illustrated football phone?

201
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,867
lt was sent to the wrong house.

202
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,663
lt will arrive tomorrow, along with
the swimsuit issue and the video,

203
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,082
Stanley Cup, 100 Years of Glory.

204
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,462
Hey, how do l get back?

205
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,131
Follow the weird naked lndian.

206
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,633
Cool.

207
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,261
Wake up, Wayne!

208
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,430
Garth.

209
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,101
l just had the most vivid
and powerful dream of my life.

210
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,312
Last night, Jim Morrison spoke to me.

211
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,191
He told me that the purpose of my life
was to put on a concert.

212
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,818
Yeah.

213
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:07,823
Oh, hey, guess what finally
came in the mail, Wayne?

214
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,576
l guess they sent it to the wrong house.

215
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,328
My Sports Illustrated football phone.

216
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,746
Oh, my God !

217
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,625
Cool. My Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue.

218
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,670
Oh, my God.

219
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,799
And The History of the Stanley Cup,
100 Years of Glory.

220
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,176
Garth, it's a sign.

221
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,014
We will put on a concert.

222
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,640
Oh, yes.

223
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,560
We will put on a concert.

224
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,201
Well, this must be the place.

225
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,413
Maybe we should've called Cassandra
before we dropped by.

226
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,832
Garth, it's us.
No one's gonna hassle us.

227
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,044
Besides, Cassandra needs
the encouragement.

228
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,636
Excuse me, what are you guys
doing here in the middle of the street?

229
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,805
Well, l'm putting these chickens
in crates and stacking them right here.

230
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,600
Jim's job is to make sure
we always have plenty of watermelons.

231
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,644
Oh, so you're selling watermelons.

232
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,270
No, no, sir. We just gotta make sure

233
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,605
there's plenty of them stacked
at all times,

234
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,731
just like the chickens.

235
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,024
What do these guys do?

236
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,942
Well, their job is to walk back and forth

237
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,987
with this big plate-glass window
every couple of minutes.

238
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,531
That's weird.

239
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,285
Yeah. You gotta wonder
if this is gonna pay off later on.

240
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,677
Okay.

241
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,012
Maybe we ought to overdub a track
with Bobby playing.

242
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,847
He can really wail.

243
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,684
Give them a few minutes.
They're working on it.

244
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,227
l spoke with the label today.

245
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,021
They figure you got
at least three singles on this one.

246
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,190
They want you to come out
to the Coast next week.

247
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,483
Excellent.

248
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,444
Not bad for a little girl from Hong Kong.

249
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,077
What brings you here, Wayne?

250
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,621
l had to tell Cassandra something.

251
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,873
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

252
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,377
Last night l had a dream.

253
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,213
We're going to put on
a concert in Aurora.

254
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,631
That's a great idea.

255
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,426
Yeah. lt's. . . lt's a festival.

256
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,845
-A festival?
-A festival. You heard the man.

257
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,097
That's charming. What's it called?

258
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,682
What's it called?

259
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:44,855
lt's called. . .

260
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,941
Waynestock. lt's called Waynestock.

261
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,401
Waynestock.

262
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,195
Who's gonna be at Waynestock?

263
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,325
Aerosmith and Pearl Jam.

264
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,704
Who else?

265
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,458
Me

266
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,168
and Wayne.

267
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,755
-And. . .
-And. . .

268
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,759
Van Halen.

269
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,677
Wow! Van Halen. Who else?

270
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,304
Yeah. Who else?

271
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,350
An old man fashioning a kayak
out of a log?

272
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,728
-What?
-No!

273
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,565
Rip Taylor! Rip Taylor's gonna be there.

274
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,193
Rip Taylor? He's a god in my country.

275
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,903
He can't walk the streets
without getting mobbed.

276
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,405
Well, that's great,
'cause he's gonna be there. So. . .

277
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,116
And l thought maybe
you could play, too.

278
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,576
l would be honored.

279
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,453
l wouldn't commit just yet.

280
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,955
You got some real gigs coming up.
Real gigs.

281
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,373
Real gigs?

282
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,586
Well, ixnay
on the condescension-ay there, Chet.

283
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,171
Yeah.

284
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,883
-Bobby, can l ask you a question?
-What is it, Garth?

285
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,053
A sphincter says what?

286
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:05,060
l said, "A sphincter says what?"

287
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:10,315
You want me to say "what,"
like l don't get it.

288
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,733
ls that it?

289
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,571
That it?

290
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,698
Oh, dear. Last guy didn't get.

291
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,450
-What.
-Okay. Last guy didn't get.

292
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,618
You big. You big.

293
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,956
We small, small.
So, we better go. Yeah.

294
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,165
Where are you going?

295
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,333
-England !
-England !

296
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,462
I can't believe Paramount is spending
the money to fly us to England.

297
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,257
I would have thought
they would just use two doubles.

298
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,093
Here we are at Piccadilly Circus.

299
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,762
Wow! What a shitty circus.

300
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,265
Good call.
There's no animals or clowns.

301
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,516
What a rip-off.

302
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,893
Let's go to Buckingham Palace.

303
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,438
Does Princess Di still live here?

304
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,107
She is such a babe.

305
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,275
Yeah.

306
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,784
So, did Jim Morrison
give you Del Preston's exact address?

307
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,829
Yeah. He said exactly London, England.

308
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:06,997
Okay.

309
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,963
l don't know about this, Wayne.

310
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,724
Del?

311
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,643
Hello?

312
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,812
Del?

313
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,992
Are you Del Preston?

314
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,327
l might be.

315
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,037
Who are you?

316
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,581
-My name is Wayne Campbell.
-l'm Garth Algar.

317
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,833
That's terribly fascinating, mate,

318
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,668
but you woke me up.

319
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,879
How can you sleep like that?

320
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,631
Listen, sonny, Jim,

321
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,760
sleeping like this
will add 1 0 years to your life.

322
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:10,018
l learned it from Keith Richards
when l toured with the Stones.

323
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,275
This may be the reason why

324
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,695
Keith cannot be killed
by conventional weapons.

325
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,824
So, how can l be of assistance?

326
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,494
You're gonna think l'm nuts, right,

327
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:32,123
but someone visited me in a dream
and told me that Del Preston

328
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,043
would help me put on a concert
in Aurora, lllinois.

329
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,461
A concert?

330
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,424
l'm afraid you've been misinformed.

331
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,761
l don't do that anymore.

332
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,683
l'm just an old geezer.

333
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,185
l mean, what do l know
about music today?

334
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,979
When l was working, it was all bands

335
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,065
like Eric Clapton
and the Rolling Stones.

336
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,652
l mean, it's not like the Grateful Dead
are still together and touring, is it?

337
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,446
-Well, actually, they. . .
-Garth.

338
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,076
Wow, look at this scrapbook.

339
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Wow.

340
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,872
-That's you with Led Zeppelin.
-Yeah.

341
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,792
My old lady put that together.

342
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,420
We must've toured every concert hall
and venue in America,

343
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,756
me, my old lady and the road.

344
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,009
-ls that you and Bob Dylan?
-Yeah.

345
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,802
Who's the old lady?

346
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,429
That's my old lady.

347
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,390
Listen, it was fun,

348
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,018
but those days are gone forever.

349
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,688
But we came all the way from America
just to talk to you.

350
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,023
l'm sorry.

351
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,275
l don't do concerts anymore.

352
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,360
Come on, let's go.

353
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,114
Well,

354
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:50,452
l still think you led a really cool life.

355
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,455
lt was nice meeting you.

356
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,415
l guess Jim was wrong.

357
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,502
Hang about.

358
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,049
Was it Jim Morrison?

359
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,759
-Yes!
-Amazing.

360
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,636
Did he have a naked lndian?

361
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,138
-Yes!
-Wow .

362
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,098
l have to ask you. . .

363
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,268
Didn't you think it was
a trifle unnecessary

364
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,812
to see the crack in the lndian's bottom?

365
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,606
Yes, absolutely!

366
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,649
l had the same dream.

367
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,819
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

368
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,531
Del, you're really gonna love Aurora.

369
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,492
Who's Aurora, anyway?

370
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,952
Frank, it's Bobby.

371
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,830
Did you get the tape?

372
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,832
What did you think?

373
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,543
Definitely. She sounds great.

374
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,463
Yeah, the band is terrible.

375
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,006
lt's a garage band.

376
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,592
They can't, l'm sure.

377
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,639
l'm working with them.
l'm still in this studio in Aurora.

378
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,182
What the hell you doing there?

379
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,517
She wants to stay here.

380
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,227
Why would she wanna stay in Aurora?

381
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,062
Same reason
they all wanna stay in Aurora,

382
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,688
she's got a boyfriend.

383
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,525
Don't worry.
l'll get rid of the boyfriend and the band.

384
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,153
Also, l'd like to bring her out to LA,
finish the album.

385
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,781
All right, Bobby.
Let's just get it done, okay?

386
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,998
And there l am in Sri Lanka,
formerly Ceylon, at 3:00 in the morning,

387
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:23,378
looking for 1 ,000 brown M&Ms
to fill a brandy glass,

388
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,381
or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage that night.

389
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,634
So, Jeff Beck pops his head
round the door

390
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,762
and mentions there's a little sweet shop
on the edge of town.

391
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:36,391
So, we go, and it's closed.

392
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,394
So, there's me and Keith Moon
and David Crosby

393
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,397
breaking into this
little sweet shop, right?

394
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,066
Well, instead of a guard dog,

395
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:49,529
they've got this bloody
great big Bengal tiger.

396
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,409
Well, l managed to take out the tiger
with a can of Mace,

397
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,661
but the shop owner and his son,

398
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,247
that's a different story altogether.

399
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:03,877
l had to beat them to death
with their own shoes.

400
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,131
Nasty business, really.

401
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:12,802
But sure enough, l got the M&Ms,
and Ozzy went on stage

402
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,804
and did a great show.

403
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,348
Wow! Wow, that was excellent.

404
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,601
That's great.

405
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,478
Well, to put on a really great rock show

406
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,772
like Knebworth, in England,

407
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,025
or Woodstock,

408
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,736
there is only one place you can do it,

409
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,196
and that's here,

410
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:35,950
at Adlai Stevenson Memorial Park,
in the playing fields.

411
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,912
We better get to Stevenson Park
and check it out.

412
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,293
So, Wayne. . .

413
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,547
l hear you're putting on
some kind of concert.

414
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,049
That's good.

415
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:55,011
People need to be entertained.
They need the distraction.

416
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,804
l wish to God
that somebody would do something

417
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,432
to block out the voices in my head
for five minutes,

418
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,935
voices that scream over and over,

419
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:06,522
"Why do they come to me to die?"

420
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,149
Okay.

421
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,125
What do we do now?

422
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,336
Here. Let me look at it.

423
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,383
Get the flashlight.

424
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,011
Okay.

425
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,347
There's the main gate,

426
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,307
and here we are.

427
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,559
No, no, no, man. We're over here.

428
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:46,562
l don't think so.
We took a left turn at the gate,

429
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,190
-so that would put us. . .
-Garth !

430
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,192
Wait a minute.

431
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,361
l know where we are.

432
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,571
l'm pretty good with maps.

433
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,451
Listen.

434
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,869
What?

435
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,752
Turn it off! Turn it off!

436
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:13,131
-l can't turn it off! l can't turn it off!
-Turn it off! Turn it off!

437
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,973
Waynestock?

438
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,018
You would purposely invite

439
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,812
the rock 'n' roll element
into our community?

440
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,565
Well, what's wrong with
a little entertainment?

441
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,359
Entertainment is fine, but this. . .

442
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,071
You know, we have lots of big acts
that come through here.

443
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,408
lce Capades, Tiny Toons, Kenny G.

444
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:41,909
Kenny G?

445
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,719
So, what, we don't even get
to apply for a permit? Yeah.

446
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,555
We would love to put on a rock concert.

447
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,182
Not!

448
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,436
Yeah.

449
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:13,191
Betty Jo, could we have the permits
for a festival, please?

450
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,234
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

451
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,613
You'll need to fill out
the necessary permit applications.

452
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,492
Permit applications.

453
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,952
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Betty Jo.

454
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,457
Hey.

455
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,795
You're the guy that's on that
Wayne World show.

456
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,838
-Betty Jo?
-Yeah?

457
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,256
Thank you.

458
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,888
All right, then.

459
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:48,393
Naturally, you'll need the
necessary application for authorization,

460
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,145
approval from the guilds and unions.

461
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,773
You'll need some release forms.

462
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,650
The decibel level. . .

463
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,902
What? ls something wrong?

464
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,529
Huh?

465
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,698
What do you mean?

466
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,700
lt's my eye, isn't it?

467
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,286
Why would we want to look at your eye?

468
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,748
ls there something wrong
with that weird eye?

469
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,251
There's nothing wrong with my eye.

470
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,752
This one just has no pigment.

471
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,839
You see, l'm what you call
a partial ocular albino.

472
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:18,965
But l'm fine with it.

473
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,884
l have perfect 20/20 vision
with both eyes.

474
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,430
Mr. Campbell, you're serious about
putting on a rock concert?

475
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,182
Are you kidding? l'd give my right eye.

476
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,685
Yeah.

477
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,478
You both realize

478
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,939
there are certain jurisdictions
you'll need to follow.

479
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,526
Well, l'd like to think
that l have an eye for details.

480
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:47,201
l'm assuming, of course,
you have the $5,000 occupancy permit,

481
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,661
or you wouldn't even be here.

482
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,955
Ex-squeeze me? A baking powder?

483
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,416
$5,000 occupancy permit?

484
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,377
Yes, we have that, actually. Yes.

485
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,004
Piece of cake.

486
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:01,466
Fine, then all forms and applications
must be filled out in triplicate

487
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,758
and returned to this office

488
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:06,095
no later than 1 0 working days
before the event,

489
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:07,805
with the money.

490
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,974
Okay. Well, we'll take these home,

491
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,143
run through them
with a fine-tooth comb,

492
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,437
cross the "t's" and dot the. . .

493
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,692
Lower-case "j's."

494
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,868
Oh, l keep falling over. Oh, no!

495
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,412
-Oh, l seem to be falling over a lot.
-Stop.

496
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,081
Oh, damn, these high heels. Oh !

497
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,084
Cassandra. . .

498
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,048
Why do you go out with me?

499
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,008
l love being with you.

500
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,010
Most guys are jerks.

501
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,304
You're a good person.

502
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,517
Wait. Let me show you
what l got at a garage sale.

503
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,976
What did you get?

504
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,521
lsn't that great? You heard of it?

505
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,689
Ex-squeeze me?
Have l ever seen this one before?

506
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,024
Frampton Comes Alive?

507
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,610
Everybody in the world
has Frampton Comes Alive.

508
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,904
lf you lived in the suburbs,
you were issued it.

509
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,532
lt came in the mail
with samples of Tide.

510
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,368
Look at this old one.
Gerry and the Pacemakers.

511
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,536
Wow! That is old.

512
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,081
You know, l bet those guys
actually have pacemakers by now.

513
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,251
Can you believe
they're not making vinyl anymore?

514
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,294
-lt's weird, isn't it?
-That is weird.

515
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,880
Bobby said my album will never,
ever be on vinyl.

516
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,799
Oh, "Bobby says."

517
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,051
Are you and Bobby having an affair?

518
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,762
No, of course not.
Where did you hear that?

519
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,847
Well, you know how these things start.

520
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,433
One guy tells another guy something,

521
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,519
then he tells two friends,

522
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,396
and they tell two friends,

523
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,106
and they tell their friends,

524
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,233
and so on, and so on,

525
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,609
and so on.

526
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:44,902
You know how these things go.

527
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:48,155
No. Honestly, Campbell,
l am not having an affair.

528
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,616
l'm nice to him
because he's my producer.

529
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:51,993
But if this record deal falls through,

530
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,538
l lose my visa, and then
l have to go back to Hong Kong.

531
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,415
But you have
nothing to worry about, Wayne.

532
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,501
-Okay.
-Hey, my dad's coming to visit.

533
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,919
l'd really love you to meet him.

534
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:05,047
Yeah. Treat.
l'm sure he's just gonna love me.

535
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,340
Yeah.

536
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,052
lf you're anything like my old boyfriend.

537
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,306
l'm nothing like your old boyfriend.

538
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,141
Then we're screwed.

539
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,269
You know, l haven't seen Garth
in a while. What's he up to?

540
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,396
Oh, Garth's doing his laundry.

541
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,940
Too bad he doesn't
have a girlfriend to do his laundry.

542
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:26,402
Oh, yeah. Thanks for doing my laundry.

543
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,903
Hey, Cassandra,

544
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,615
how do you get my clothes
so white and fresh-smelling?

545
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,035
lt's an age-old Cantonese family method
that very few people know about.

546
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,245
Ah. Wait a minute.

547
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,789
Calgon?

548
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,208
Ancient Chinese secret, huh?

549
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,193
Hello.

550
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,570
Hi.

551
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,032
l don't recall ever seeing you in here.

552
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,118
Well, maybe it's because
it's my first time in here.

553
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,829
That's right.
My mom used to do all my laundry,

554
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,164
but l do now.

555
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,917
l'm what you call sans parents.

556
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,502
Oh.

557
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,880
l can go to a movie on a school night,
like that.

558
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,968
Well, welcome to the neighborhood.

559
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,348
Oh.

560
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:38,933
Yeah, dirty. . .

561
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,436
Would you like
some red rope licorice?

562
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,105
Why, sure.

563
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,828
-What's your name?
-Garth. Garth Algar.

564
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,788
What's yours?

565
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,041
l'm Honey Hornee.

566
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,960
Nice to meet you, Miss Horny.

567
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,169
That's Hornee.

568
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,423
-lt's French.
-Oh. Okay,

569
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,800
Miss Hornee.

570
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,261
So, Garth,

571
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,805
would you
like to have dinner some night?

572
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,682
Oh, l like to have dinner every night.

573
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,309
No, l mean us. You and me.

574
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,812
Would you like
to have dinner some night?

575
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,023
A date?

576
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,821
Finally. lt took, like, two hours.

577
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,091
l like them teeny and toasty.

578
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,177
So long.

579
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,388
-Bye.
-Bye.

580
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,433
Maybe we'll see each other around.

581
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,018
Yeah. l'll see you around.

582
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,436
Oh, Garth?

583
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,023
You forgot these.

584
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:22,787
-Good night, Cassandra.
-Night.

585
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,789
-Good work.
-Thanks. See you tomorrow.

586
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,248
Good night.

587
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,252
l have got to get you to LA.

588
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,421
You are buried here.

589
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,883
l like it here. All my friends are here.

590
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,384
What time is it?

591
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,178
1 0:35.

592
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,056
Damn. l missed the start
of Wayne's show.

593
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,517
Okay.

594
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,977
So, we're in a doll factory, right?

595
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,480
lt kind of reminds me of that movie,
the Leprechaun. You remember.

596
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,564
-With that little guy..
-Oh, yeah.

597
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,983
-...that goes, "I'm the leprechaun. "
-Jeez.

598
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,361
Garth, I'm the leprechaun!

599
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,570
Cool it, okay?

600
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,824
-I'm the leprechaun!
-Stop it, all right?

601
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,493
Don't try and steal me pot o' gold.

602
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,495
Why do you hang around
with these guys?

603
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,330
Because they're fun.

604
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,499
lf l wanted a guy
that was all drive and ambition,

605
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,251
l could've stayed in Hong Kong.

606
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,628
Back there,
guys like that are 1 2 for 1 0 cents.

607
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,004
You mean a dime a dozen.

608
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,714
Maybe where you shop.

609
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,843
l think you underestimate them.
They're really sharp.

610
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,386
Stop it, leprechaun man!

611
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,762
-Garth, chill!
-And there they come...

612
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,514
-What did those monsters do to you?
-Heather Locklear...

613
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,058
-I'm not... Stop it.
-Sweetie. Sweetie.

614
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,643
-Stop it.
-Sweetie.

615
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,520
-I'm not listening.
-Come on, sweetie.

616
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,397
Come on. Pixie dust.

617
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,191
Pixie dust. Sweetie, it's me.

618
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:37,236
-It's me the leprechaun!
-No!

619
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,196
I'm the leprechaun.

620
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,615
Oh, yeah. These guys, really sharp.

621
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,909
-I'm scared!
-It's the leprechaun.

622
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,203
-Want to leave, but can't.
-I'm the leprechaun.

623
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,997
-Want to move.
-Where you gonna move?

624
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,499
-Get away, leprechaun man.
-Are you gonna move to Ireland?

625
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,668
-No! Got to go!
-'Cause I'm the leprechaun.

626
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,880
Wayne, we're here!

627
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,384
Here, let me get the gate for you.
Hold on.

628
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,886
All righty.

629
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,971
Come on in.

630
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,391
Come on in. Nice digs, huh?

631
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,478
Hey, Cassandra, you look hot.

632
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,398
Sorry.

633
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:18,903
Wayne, l would like you to
meet my father, Mr. Wong.

634
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,573
Please meet you acquaintance,
Wayne Campbell.

635
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,544
Right.

636
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:13,832
Very well, if that is your custom.

637
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,376
Prepare to die.

638
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:17,920
Come.

639
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,233
l know all seven animal styles,

640
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,484
the crane,

641
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,694
the stag,

642
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,487
the horse, the tiger,

643
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,406
the bat, the rat,

644
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,657
the monkey,

645
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,950
the Beatle.

646
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,494
l will take you, old man.

647
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,175
Your tongue is quick,
but how are you with a sword?

648
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,384
Oh, no!

649
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,802
Wayne!

650
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,592
Hello? Can we talk later?

651
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,885
This is not a good time for me.

652
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,221
Just a moment. l've got call waiting.

653
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,473
Hello. Yes?

654
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,059
Can l call you back?
l am on the other line.

655
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,020
Uh-huh. Yes,

656
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,023
he received his Sports Illustrated
football phone.

657
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,840
Wayne, you've impressed me.

658
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,925
You're worthy of my daughter.

659
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,017
So, here's the deal.
We got a party tomorrow at Komrades.

660
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,603
It's kind of a fund-raiser
for Waynestock.

661
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:25,065
That's right. There's gonna be
a $10 cover charge at the door.

662
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,650
It's gonna be a big party

663
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,154
And because it's at Komrades,
we're gonna call it a communist party

664
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,915
l remember, one time
l was in a place like this.

665
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,752
Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon.

666
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,921
lt was about 3:00 in the morning,

667
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,841
and l was looking for 1 ,000 brown M&Ms

668
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,509
to fill a brandy glass,

669
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:55,304
or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage that night.

670
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,515
So, Jeff Beck pops his head
round the door

671
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,184
and mentions there's a little

672
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,311
-sweet shop on the edge of town.
-Sweet shop on the edge of town.

673
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,854
-Yeah.
-Hey, Wayne. Hey, Garth.

674
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,023
-Hey, Milton.
-Hey, Milton, how's it going, man?

675
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,733
Awesome party!

676
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,944
Good tunes. Good brew. Good buddies.

677
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,696

678
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,031
l feel great!

679
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,616
l don't know, man.

680
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,202
l hate my father. l hate my life.

681
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,078
But l feel great, man !

682
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,663
You guys are great.

683
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:22,956
Yeah.

684
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,626
l'm gonna go pick a fight.

685
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,880
He's gotten a lot better, don't you think?

686
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,798
-Way better.
-Yeah.

687
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,635
Thank you.

688
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,304
We'll be back in a bit.

689
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,894
Hey, how's it going?

690
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,187
-Hi.
-Hey.

691
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,649

-Yeah.

692
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,776
-l'll be at the bar.
-Good.

693
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,069
Hey, l'm so glad you could make it.

694
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,528
You look amazing.

696
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,658
-Yes.
-Oh, wait. l have great news.

697
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,577
Bobby is taking me to LA
to do the final mix on my album.

698
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,287
lsn't that terrific?

699
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,581
Wow, that's great.

700
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,833
l'm ecstatic.

701
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,044
l'm beside myself with joy.

702
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,671
Hooray for Hollywood.

703
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,257
Living on your own
definitely has its perks. Schwing !

704
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,634
You know, because your mom
doesn't tell you to turn down the stereo,

705
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,761
and junk like that,
you know, which is a real drag.

706
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,096
Schwing ! Schwing !

707
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,806
You know, because moms
are genetically programed

708
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,475
to hate music played at the
appropriate level, right? l mean. . .

709
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,270
And my dad, forget about it.
Schwing ! Schwing ! Schwing ! Schwing !

710
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,939
He could ruin a Led Zeppelin reunion
concert. You know what l mean?

711
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:29,982
Schwing ! Schwing !

712
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,234
'Cause he hates any music
played at the appropriate level.

713
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,568
Schwing ! Schwing ! Schwing !

714
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,862
. . .but the shopkeeper and his son

715
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,740
was a different story altogether.

716
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,704
l had to beat them to death
with their own shoes.

717
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,417
-What's the deal with Bobby?
-Wayne?

718
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,044
-Go! Go! Go!
-Go! Go! Go!

719
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:54,006
lt's getting a little out of hand.
l think you'd better say something.

720
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,215
All right. Good call.

721
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,759
Everybody, l'd like to say something !

722
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,261
Excuse me. Coming through !

723
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,806
Everybody, can l get your attention?
l'd like to say something.

724
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,433
Keep it down.

725
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,811
Okay. We're really glad
you could all make it.

726
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,315
We never realized
that we had so many friends

727
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,859
who believed in this concert idea.

728
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,862
When we first had this idea
of putting on this shindig,

729
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,448
we didn't know if anyone would come.

730
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,907
But look,

731
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,577
you're all here, pitching in.

732
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,289
l promised myself l wouldn't cry.

733
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:33,879
Party on !

734
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,844
-Go! Go! Go!
-Go! Go! Go!

735
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,515
Garth, l'm starting
to get a bad feeling, man.

736
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,850
l think something's going on.

737
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,240
Hello. Hello. Yes?

738
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,867
ls this Aerosmith's tour manager?

739
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,119
lt is!

740
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,747
Hello. My name is Wayne Campbell.
You don't know me.

741
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,249
l'm not mental or anything,

742
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,210
but l'm putting on a concert
in Aurora, lllinois.

743
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,671
Yes, l can hold.

744
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,842
Del, look. For years l thought
this was a Mercedes emblem.

745
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,385
Woodstock?

746
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,512
That was quite a show, man.

747
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,180
You were at Woodstock?

748
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,349
Excellent. What was it like?

749
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:14,479
Well, it rained all morning,
and then it cleared up in the afternoon.

750
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,023
And that's it.

751
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,734
l almost remembered
something else then, but it's gone.

752
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,194
You can't remember what it was?

753
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,697
Still holding, yes, l am. l just want. . .

754
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,033
Wayne, look what l made.

755
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,077
Good work, my friend.

756
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:35,041
You guys got the permit applications?

757
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,044
Got the money?

758
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,713
Cha-ching, cha-ching.

759
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,256
Good for you.

760
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,218
Most people just take them
and never come back.

761
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,909
Position one to position two.
Do you copy?

762
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,953
This is position two in position.

763
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,872
Position three, what's your position?

764
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,749
Position three. l read you.

765
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,293
Position four, do you copy? Over.

766
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,753
Four copies.

767
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,338
Back to position one. Over.

768
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,466
l have to go to LA for a couple of days.

769
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,259
lf you need anything,

770
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,763
l'm at this number.

771
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,272
Position one to position two.

772
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,358
Position one to position two.
Did you see that?

773
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,818
This is position two in position !

774
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,446
Sorry, man, l didn't see anything.

775
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,784
What is it?

776
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,666
Abort! Abort! We have been identified !

777
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:04,965
Abandon positions!
Abandon positions! Whoa!

778
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,512
Wayne, let's run away!

779
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,996
Garth, it's locked !

780
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,498
ln here!

781
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,366
Hi.

782
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,125
Come on, let's go!

783
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,318
Do it, Miss Thing ! Do it! Do it!

784
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,517
Get it, girl ! Get it, girl !

785
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,832
What's the matter, Wayne? You look
like you wanna say something to me.

786
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,668
l think we should break up.

787
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:31,755
-What? Why?
-Because

788
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,965
there comes a time

789
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,009
when people should go
their separate ways.

790
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,137
l mean, l've got Waynestock,

791
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,432
you've got your career
and your producer,

792
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:48,104
and l just think it's time
that we should see other people.

793
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,525
l don't want to see other people.

794
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,068
Well, what about Bobby?

795
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,613
-What about him?
-Oh, come on !

796
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,448
Do you think l'm a gulla bull

797
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,325
or even a gulla calf?

798
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,577
l have no idea
what you're talking about, Wayne.

799
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,371
Yeah, right! Come on, now!

800
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,081
What about these?

801
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,633
-Where did these come from?
-l did a little detective work.

802
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,593
You did spy on me.

803
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,053
Yes, l did.

804
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:24,974
Easy.

805
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,229
l think she took that well.

806
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,357
Let's go.

807
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,071
Ladies and gentlemen !

808
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,576
Your roadie training begins today.

809
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,412
lt will not be easy.

810
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,248
You will get tired.

811
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,583
You will get blisters.

812
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,711
You will get aches and pains.

813
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,881
But you will also get good.

814
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:00,844
Are you ready?

815
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:02,178
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

816
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:05,098
Roadies present and accounted for, sir!

817
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:08,268
Well, let's begin.

818
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,230
Go!

819
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,315
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

820
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,442
On the stand, not on the ground !

821
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,611
Come on, let's go!

822
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,781
Go! Not on the ground !

823
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:23,324
Not on the ground.

824
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,118
Jesus! lt's crazy!

825
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,997
They're getting better, Del. Look.

826
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,541
-Not on the ground.
-Ow! Ow!

827
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,960
Go!

828
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,967
Get that microphone!
Get that microphone!

829
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:50,518
You're worthless!
You're less than nothing !

830
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,520
What's keeping you here?

831
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:56,107
You don't belong here!
Why don't you just quit?

832
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,445
'Cause l got no place else to go!

833
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,201
Whoa.

834
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,715
Thanks for coming in with me.

835
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,927
l'm always a little afraid
to come in by myself.

836
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,226
Come.

837
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:34,979
Come on.

838
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,446
Come on. Sit down.

839
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,077
And l'll fix us a little drink, okay?

840
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,731
There you are.

841
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,401
An Old Fashioned.

842
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,614
This Coke's gone bad.

843
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,328
l just love a man with a sense of humor.

844
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,081
-You know what l wish?
-What?

845
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,501
l wish l could climb up
inside of that big old brain of yours

846
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,044
and just walk around.

847
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:41,337
Really?

848
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:44,340
-You know what l love?
-What?

849
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:48,386
l love the way those big, thick glasses
magnify your pupils.

850
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,179
-Oh.
-Look at me.

851
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:56,019
l'll bet you like to be in control. Tell me.

852
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,438
Well, when l was 1 7,

853
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,691
my little sister tried to borrow
my Def Leppard record.

854
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,693
l said, "No way."

855
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,529
Now, that's exactly
what l'm talking about.

856
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,367
Oh, my God. You're so limber.

857
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,828
Don't you just love music?

858
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,587
Do you have any Megadeth?

859
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,642
Come with me.

860
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,728
l'm blind.

861
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,313
Whoa.

862
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,818
Okay.

863
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,494
l'm dancing.

864
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,624
You're real squiggly.

865
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Whoa.

866
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,381
-Did you hurt yourself?
-Yeah.

867
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,967
-Let me see. Oh. There.
-That's it.

868
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,177
Yeah.

869
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,889
Feel naughty. Feel naughty.

870
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,892
l thought l saw a puddy cat. Whoa!

871
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,852
Boldly go
where no man has ever gone before.

872
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,355
There's got to be a way to find. . .

873
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,608
-Take me, Garth.
-Where?

874
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,777
l'm low on gas and you need a jacket.

875
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,487
l'm gonna be frank.

876
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,781
Okay. Can l still be Garth?

877
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,783
Shut up and kiss me.

878
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,192
Can l have some cocoa later?

879
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,328
Good morning, darling.

880
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,330
l trust you slept well.

881
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:24,041
l hope l wasn't too much of an animal.

882
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,962
Come, hold me.

883
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,214
You know l will.

884
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,262
Party on.

885
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,474
Oh, he's bobbing. He's weaving.
He winds up!

886
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,727
Oh, denied !

887
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,271
Yeah !

888
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,026
Are you all right?

889
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,235
Women.

890
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,613
l feel like l've been placed
in the delete bin of life

891
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,573
next to Mahogany Rush.

892
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:57,825
Oh. l'm sorry.

893
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:02,205
Well, relationships aren't for the timid.

894
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:05,291
-Yeah.
-And l should know.

895
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:11,255
For l am no longer a stranger
in the ways of the woman.

896
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:14,217
All right, man, all right.

897
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,843
Good work, my friend.

898
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:18,054
On that note, game on.

899
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,555
Game on !

900
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,017
All right!

901
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,977
He's wheeling, he's dealing.

902
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:28,481
He shoots, he scores!

903
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,858
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

904
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,320
it takes two people to run a concert,

905
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:39,242
one backstage and one out front.

906
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,410
Two.

907
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,747
One man alone cannot do this.

908
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:49,252
Wayne, you will run
the backstage team.

909
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,004
Milton, you are the liaison

910
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:57,510
between Wayne's backstage team
and Garth's front stage team,

911
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,471
which includes myself in the booth.

912
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:05,351
To the left and the right of the stage
are the machine gun nests,

913
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,186
belt-fed M60 Brownings.

914
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:11,565
Now, these babies tend to heat up,
so shoot in three-second bursts.

915
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,609
ln the event of capture,

916
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:17,405
l will personally
distribute cyanide capsules

917
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:20,116
to be placed under the tongue like so.

918
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,994
Any questions?

919
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,996
Yeah. l have a question.

920
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,415
When did you turn into a nut bar?

921
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,463
Thank you, Mr. Scream.

922
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,966
Hey, in a minute I'm gonna
bejoined by Wayne and Garth.

923
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,509
They're gonna give us the lowdown

924
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,220
about the upcoming
Waynestock concert.

925
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,056
Hi. We're here to see Handsome Dan.

926
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,391
My name is Wayne Campbell.

927
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,726
Ja, l know.

928
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,811
We've been expecting you,
Wayne Campbell.

929
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,563
l am Bjergen Kjergen.

930
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,107
Wow, l love your accent.
Where are you from?

931
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,484
-l am from Sweden.
-Oh, really?

932
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:56,610
Whereabouts in Sweden?

933
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,988
Knuergen, near the Bjorgen Fjords.

934
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,365
Well, nice to meet you, Bjergen Kjergen

935
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,784
from Knuergen near the Bjorgen Fjords.

936
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,453
Knuergen.

937
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:08,331
That's in the Klargen province,
near the Biburgen river.

938
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:09,498
Ja.

939
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,125
Now correct me if l'm wrong.

940
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,837
Your annual rainfall varies
from about 40 inches in the winter,

941
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,881
to about 200 inches in the summer,

942
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,884
and your chief export
is modular furniture.

943
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,470
l did a project on Sweden
in the eighth grade.

944
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,806
Well, l am impressed
with your quest for knowledge.

945
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,767
Educated men are rare.

946
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,770
lt was really hard.
l stayed up all night working on it.

947
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,229
Then the next day, in gym class,

948
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:35,274
l was on the mini tramp,
and l got diarrhea.

949
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,446
l really wish l hadn't told you that.

950
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,782
Well, l am sorry to hear of your illness,

951
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,868
but since you have
sacrificed your health

952
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,370
for knowledge of my home country,

953
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:52,625
l find you very attractive, and l hope
to make love to you in the near future.

954
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,252
Well, shnuergen.

955
01:01:56,171 --> 01:02:00,466
Okay. All right.

956
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,385
Dick Van Dyke Show.

957
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,178
Hi.

958
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,808
-Good work, my friend.
-Yeah.

959
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:14,230
Are you wearing Brut?

960
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,524
Yes.

961
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,902
My woman likes me in cologne.

962
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,570
Hey, Wayne, Garth,

963
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:24,198
let me get my headset off,
l'll be right out.

964
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,491
Oh, wow!

965
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,958
Hi, Handsome Dan.
lt's great to meet you.

966
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,168
l'm not Handsome Dan.

967
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,005
Hi.

968
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:41,507
Hey.

969
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:42,925
Hi.

970
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:44,885
Dansome

971
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,095
-Dan.
-Dan.

972
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:54,687
Back with you on WPlG,
maximum grunt.

973
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:57,773
All right. Our special guests right now,

974
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,191
Wayne Campbell, Garth Algar.

975
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,110
Wayne's World, Wayne's World.
All right.

976
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,529
Talking about Waynestock.
Very exciting. Big event.

977
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,780
Everybody's excited, huh?

978
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:08,534
Yeah. lt's gonna be a big concert
at Adlai Stevenson Park.

979
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,411
lt's just gonna be a big party, you know.

980
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,496
We got some great bands coming.

981
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:14,331
Like Aerosmith.

982
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:18,127
l just wanna remind everybody
that there's still plenty of tickets left.

983
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,046
But that's no reason
to wait till the last minute.

984
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:24,967
Because it's just a chance
for the city of Aurora. . .

985
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,261
To do something. . .

986
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:30,473
Fun.

987
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,600
And to put the city on the map.

988
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,436
lt's a lot of work.

989
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:37,897
Oh, well, work is hard.

990
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,649
You're not really listening to me,
are you?

991
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:44,737
l mean, l could say anything right now,
like, "You're a complete tool."

992
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,322
But you wouldn't hear it,

993
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:49,909
'cause you're a freak with a microphone.

994
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:54,663
lt's not even challenging anymore.
lt's like shooting fish in a barrel.

995
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,248
lsn't that true, sphincter boy?

996
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,958
What? Oh !

997
01:03:58,585 --> 01:03:59,835
They're getting closer all the time.

998
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,171
All right. Good information
about Waynestock. Very exciting.

999
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,423
We'll be back with more,
right after Pig sports.

1000
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:06,217
Right now,
it's 1 6 minutes past the big hour.

1001
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,677
ls that not right, Mr. Scream?

1002
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:14,517
Great. Good stuff.

1003
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,519
l think people are getting really cranked.

1004
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:28,280
-Hi. Bobby? lt's Wayne Campbell.
-Wayne.

1005
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,824
How'd you get this number?

1006
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,702
lt was written on the back
of a business card.

1007
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,955
Hey, l'm looking for Cassandra.

1008
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,749
Do you know where she is?
l have to talk to her. lt's really important.

1009
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,668
Cassandra? No, l haven't seen her.

1010
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:44,004
She said she might come to LA.
She wasn't definite.

1011
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,133
lf l hear anything, l'll let you know.

1012
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,677
l have to go.

1013
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,346
l'm with someone.
l'm sorry l couldn't help.

1014
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,140
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

1015
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,687
lmportant call?

1016
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,022
Some small-time promoter.

1017
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,283
Let's get some lunch.

1018
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:48,569
What you're saying
is that Peter Lawford warned Kennedy

1019
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:51,614
not to mess with
the military-industrial complex.

1020
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,532
Yeah. Dig this, man.

1021
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,910
J. Edgar Hoover was one bad cat.

1022
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,497
l mean, he had
a completely different bag from Jack.

1023
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:02,499
l mean, he just couldn't groove.

1024
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,294
And when two cats
can't groove to the same tune,

1025
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,047
one of them
has to visit the man upstairs.

1026
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,507
That's amazing, man.

1027
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:12,718
Excuse me. Hey, Wayne,

1028
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:15,763
l want you to meet a friend of mine,
Sammy Davis Jr.

1029
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:18,307
Wow! Nice to meet you, Mr. Jr.

1030
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,975
Nice to meet you, too, man.

1031
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:23,145
l gotta split, man.
l got some cats l gotta hang with.

1032
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,605
Bye, Sammy.

1033
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:27,024
He's a good man.

1034
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,902
And now, Wayne, what can l do you for?

1035
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,946
Listen, Jim, l'm really confused, okay?

1036
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,491
We haven't sold any tickets yet,
none of the bands have signed,

1037
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,826
Garth is distracted by chicks,

1038
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,662
l broke up with my girlfriend,

1039
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,998
and on top of all that,
Del's gone completely mental.

1040
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,375
To complete your journey,

1041
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:47,336
you're gonna have to help
some people along the way.

1042
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,506
This next little bit,
you're gonna have to go it alone.

1043
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,508
Keep the faith, my friend.

1044
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,927
lf you book them, they will come.

1045
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,013
Hey, Sammy, wait up.

1046
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,518
Hey, Jim, what if nobody shows up?

1047
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:04,144
Jim !

1048
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,155
Oh, wow.

1049
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:17,991
Sand.

1050
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,786
Cool. Yeah.

1051
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:24,790
Right.

1052
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,542
Right, Moe.

1053
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:28,335
l understand.

1054
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,503
Nervous?

1055
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:31,964
A little.

1056
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,966
l've never been
on The Tonight Show before.

1057
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,385
Nothing to worry about.
After the show, l thought we. . .

1058
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,262
After the show,
l have to fly back to Aurora.

1059
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,931
-l'm doing Waynestock, remember?
-Waynestock?

1060
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,683
What's this Waynestock thing?

1061
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,601
lt's nothing.
Just something she has to do.

1062
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,311
Hold on a second, Moe.

1063
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,899
Listen, Bobby's put together
some great musicians.

1064
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,110
You're making a great album.

1065
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,571
Together, it can't miss.

1066
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,157
You're in good hands. He's the best.

1067
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:01,577
You listen to Bobby,
and you're gonna be a big star.

1068
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,203
A big star.

1069
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,080
Moe? Yeah.

1070
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,586
Well, we're almost out of time,
but l'd just like to point out

1071
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:15,716
that there are still plenty of excellent
Waynestock tickets still available.

1072
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:19,011
Actually, there are about 1 0,000

1073
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,014
excellent Waynestock tickets
still available.

1074
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,349
And l'd also like to address a rumor.

1075
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,934
There's this rumor

1076
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:28,228
that none of the bands have signed,

1077
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:30,731
and that probably
no one's gonna show up.

1078
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:34,067
While it's true
that none of the bands have signed,

1079
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,945
Jim Morrison and his
weird naked lndian friend

1080
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:40,532
visited me in the night and assured me
that all the bands are gonna come.

1081
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:41,825
-All right.
-Yeah.

1082
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,786
All right. Well, that's all the time
we have for this week.

1083
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,454
So, until then, good night.

1084
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,456
-Party on, Garth.
-Party on, Wayne.

1085
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,958
It's Wayne's World, Wayne's World

1086
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:52,085
Party time, excellent

1087
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,634
-And we're clear.
-All right!

1088
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,012
Wayne, you know,

1089
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:06,725
l don't know if you should mention
that Jim Morrison thing anymore.

1090
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:10,813
Yeah, yeah.
lt's just that people have started to talk.

1091
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:12,439
You know, they're saying things like,

1092
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:17,694
"Hey, there goes Garth
and his friend Wayne, the psychopath."

1093
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,240
lt's embarrassing.
No offense or nothing.

1094
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,242
Oh, no. No, none taken.

1095
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,288
l believe this knife is yours.

1096
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,082
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1097
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:34,586
lt's just that things
have started to look a little bleak.

1098
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,839
Bleak? What?

1099
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:38,674
Hey, no guff, Chet.

1100
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,260
Until you pointed that out,
it hadn't occurred to me.

1101
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:42,469
Hey, where are you going?

1102
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:43,846
-Mikita's.
-Mikita's. Yeah.

1103
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,181
You know. The usual.
Are you gonna come?

1104
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,183
No, no, no. You guys go and have fun.

1105
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:51,103
l'd probably just end up
embarrassing you anyways.

1106
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:55,315
No, no. l'm just gonna stay here
and lick the cat's butt.

1107
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:57,609
-Okay.
-Okay.

1108
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,238
Just 15 to 20 minutes,

1109
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,781
three times a week,

1110
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,616
can really make a difference in...

1111
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,618
How about all the otherproducts here?
How much for those?

1112
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,329
Joe, you know the price, $29. 95.

1113
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,210
And that song is from your album
that's coming out, right?

1114
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,879
-Oh, man.
-Right.

1115
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,171
She looks great.

1116
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,090
It should be out next month,

1117
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,217
or we hope it will be.

1118
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,136
Now, who's... Now, who's "we"?

1119
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,847
Now, who are you looking at?
Let's see. Let's see the guy

1120
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,932
That's Bobby Cahn, my producer.

1121
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:31,268
Oh, that fine-looking man
is your producer, huh?

1122
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,729
Oh, man, I'm in the wrong business.
See, I should be a record producer,

1123
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:37,065
then I'd have attractive-looking women
waving and smiling at me all the time.

1124
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,483
Hi, Bobby.

1125
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,321
She will be mine again. Oh, yes.

1126
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:45,282
She will be mine again.

1127
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,952
You were terrific. They loved you.

1128
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:50,287
-You think so?
-Are you kidding?

1129
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:53,040
Listen to them. They loved you. Me, too.

1130
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,042
You know, l didn't think l could
do it without my band.

1131
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:57,336
But the guys you put together
were so hot.

1132
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,172
-Damn, l had fun.
-Good. Let's celebrate.

1133
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,465
Okay.

1134
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,343
Did you give any thought to what l said?

1135
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,638
Yeah. l'm still thinking about it.

1136
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,556
Give me a week?

1137
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,350
Okay.

1138
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,563
What's the matter? ls anything wrong?

1139
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,315
Oh, Garth.

1140
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,444
Oh, Garth, l'm so scared.

1141
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,988
What, has someone hurt you?
l mean, l'll take care of it.

1142
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:26,907
l'm a grownup now, you know.

1143
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,201
lt's. . .

1144
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,536
lt's my husband.

1145
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,705
Your what?

1146
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,416
Oh, darling. l meant to tell you,

1147
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,126
but my divorce isn't final.

1148
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:41,880
And he came over here yesterday,
and he was crazy, like an animal.

1149
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,967
Oh, l wish someone would kill him.

1150
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,761
You mean, kill your husband?

1151
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,180
No! No! Don't say it.

1152
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,974
You mustn't even think it.

1153
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:55,477
l mean, l know you love me,
but l won't let you kill my husband.

1154
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:59,856
Although, l know you want to.
We both know you want to.

1155
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,192
And then you could have me
anytime you want.

1156
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,152
And l do mean anytime.

1157
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,656
Get me my cigarettes, would you, lover?

1158
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,658
They're in my purse.

1159
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:15,288
l'm just so. . .

1160
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,457
Whoa.

1161
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:22,087
That's a pretty big gun.

1162
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:24,923
Oh, darling. . .

1163
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,343
All this talk about killing,

1164
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,512
and .45 Magnums
with the clip filed down

1165
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,055
and the safety off. . .

1166
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,641
Oh, it's just all so confusing.

1167
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,768
l won't. l won't.

1168
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:40,105
l won't. l won't.
l won't. l won't. l won't. l won't.

1169
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,191
-l won't let you.
-He is a dead man.

1170
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,119
No way.

1171
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,623
You know what?

1172
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,585
l got myself into this.
l'm gonna get myself out of it.

1173
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:04,379
l'm gonna take it on the chin,
and l'm gonna be a man.

1174
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,214
Keep the faith, my friend.

1175
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:09,092
If you book them, they will come.

1176
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,638
Okay. All right, man.

1177
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,016
You gotta stop doing that, all right?

1178
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,309
Oh, man.

1179
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,102
Hello, is anybody here?

1180
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:20,729
Hello.

1181
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:23,690
Oh, my God ! Rip Taylor! Oh, my God !

1182
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:25,400
How are you?
You must be Wayne Campbell.

1183
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:27,319
-Yes, l am.
-How are you, Wayne?

1184
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,445
Very good.

1185
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:29,946
This must be Waynestock.

1186
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,156
Yes, it is.

1187
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,409
lt's a little rustic, a little bucolic,
but, oh, well, l like it. lt's cute.

1188
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:35,660
Thanks.

1189
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,746
Oh, how are you, pal?
You better get ready for the show.

1190
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,039
Get dressed.

1191
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,500
You can see him?

1192
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,667
Well, of course l can see him.

1193
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:46,088
l mean, how are you gonna miss
a half-naked lndian, for God's sake?

1194
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:48,924
Rip Taylor, Garth Algar.

1195
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,009
Rip, you showed up. Cool.

1196
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:54,096
Yeah. And my people got a call
from you, you know. Thank you.

1197
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,766
And before l could say, "No,"
this guy came to me in a dream.

1198
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,644
l said, "Who are you?"
He said, "Jim Morrison.

1199
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,354
"l'm a dead rock star."

1200
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,439
l said, "l'm not familiar with your work."

1201
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,316
So, he played me
a record from The Doors.

1202
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,777
And l said, "Well, you appear to be
more like a crooner

1203
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,862
"working in the rock milieu, which l like."

1204
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,572
Why is our order taking so long?

1205
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:16,118
So, well, you know, he said,
"You gotta do Waynestock."

1206
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,203
So, l figured, what the hey?

1207
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:20,997
Hey, what's going on?

1208
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:22,833
-Don't you know?
-No.

1209
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,293
-We're here for Waynestock.
-Same here, dude.

1210
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:28,004
-Really looking forward to it, too.
-Later.

1211
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:30,215
Wayne, where did all these people
come from?

1212
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,051
Garth, this is big.
We gotta get back to the playing fields.

1213
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,148
So, have you seen Cassandra?

1214
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:48,441
l know. lt's weird.

1215
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,735
l don't know where she is either.

1216
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:54,990
l know. l mean, she said she'd play,
and she never misses a gig.

1217
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:58,076
All right. Well, if you see her,
can you send her over to Waynestock?

1218
01:14:58,161 --> 01:15:01,037
All right. Thanks a lot, chief.
All right, bye-bye.

1219
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:03,665
Wayne! Wayne!

1220
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,334
Okay, here's what's happening so far.

1221
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,211
A lot of people have started to show up,

1222
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:10,255
but none of the bands are here.

1223
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:12,883
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1224
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:14,843
l'm going to hurl.

1225
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,179
Okay, Garth, ixnay on the url-hay.

1226
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:20,265
l need your help. Think!
Where could Cassandra be?

1227
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:26,646
l think l had too much Jolt cola.

1228
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:31,610
Hello?

1229
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,486
Jeff, Wayne.

1230
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,488
l cannot find your daughter,
and l'm greatly troubled.

1231
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,365
Alas, my young friend.

1232
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,743
l have chosen another for my daughter.

1233
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,203
You are an excellent warrior,

1234
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,455
but l require more in a son-in-law.

1235
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,165
He has money.

1236
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,376
Name the one you have chosen,
and surely he will die by my hand.

1237
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,337
He goes by the name of Bobby.

1238
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:53,798
He has offered security,
a career and a green card.

1239
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,717
l arranged the match myself.

1240
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,011
And though l am sure
this information will be useless to you

1241
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:00,055
so late in the film,
they are to be married

1242
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:03,058
at the First Presbyterian Church
on Gordon Street.

1243
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,686
Sorry l could not invite you
to the wedding, my young friend.

1244
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,315
lt's okay. She's marrying Bobby.

1245
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,113
-What are you doing?
-l'm out!

1246
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:20,408
l have to go find Cassandra
and tell her how l feel.

1247
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,745
But l can't do the concert by myself.
lt takes two men to run the concert!

1248
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,622
You're right. l'm in.

1249
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:28,250
But l love her! l'm freaking out!

1250
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,043
What am l gonna do?

1251
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,004
Go get Cassandra.
Del and l will run the concert.

1252
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,885
Just go get Cassandra
and be back before we start!

1253
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,387
Go, now!

1254
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,182
Yay!

1255
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,439
Now, move it, people!

1256
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:53,525
Go! Go! Go!

1257
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:55,735
Hi !

1258
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,862
l'm kind of busy now.

1259
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:00,824
l just wanted to know

1260
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:03,994
if you needed anything
from the Permit Office.

1261
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,542
That's the UNIX book.

1262
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,420
Yeah.

1263
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:14,587
Cool.

1264
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:25,140
Whoa!

1265
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,193
All right, men. Our work here is done.

1266
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,073
Excellent.

1267
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:45,410
Whoa!

1268
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,580
Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !

1269
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:32,791
Where's the First Presbyterian Church
on Gordon Street?

1270
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:37,337
-Gordon Street! Gordon Street!
-Oh, yeah, Gordon Street.

1271
01:18:38,089 --> 01:18:41,633
l once knew a girl
who lived on Gordon Street,

1272
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:43,968
but that was a long time ago,

1273
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,054
when l was young.

1274
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,972
Do we have to put up with this?

1275
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,350
l mean, can't we get a better actor?

1276
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:54,479
l know it's a small part,
but l think we can do better than this.

1277
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,361
Gordon Street?

1278
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:04,447
Oh, yes, Gordon Street.

1279
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,992
l once knew a girl
who lived on Gordon Street,

1280
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:09,661
a long time ago,

1281
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,371
when l was a young man.

1282
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:15,041
Not a day passes
that l don't think of her,

1283
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,253
and the promise l made which

1284
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,672
l will always keep,

1285
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,883
that one perfect day on Gordon Street.

1286
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:27,887
That's five blocks up, two over.

1287
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:31,975
Thank you.

1288
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:02,505
Welcome to Aurora!

1289
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:04,632
Eat me!

1290
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:10,221
Notjust a place, but a state ofmind.

1291
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:01,189
Jesus! God, no.

1292
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:08,530
Cassandra!

1293
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,659
Oh. Hi. Sorry!

1294
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,244
Sorry, everybody!

1295
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:15,828
Wrong wedding !

1296
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,122
Who's he?

1297
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,649
Oh, Jesus. God, no.

1298
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,324
-Cassandra!
-What an asshole!

1299
01:21:53,867 --> 01:22:18,933
Cassandra!

1300
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,728
Wayne!

1301
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,073
You punk.

1302
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,992
You crazy punk.

1303
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:49,047
Come on. Come on, Cassandra.

1304
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,591
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1305
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,823
Stevenson Park! Step on it!

1306
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:19,577
One. Two.

1307
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:24,082
Check two!

1308
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:27,460
Okay. We have some word

1309
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:30,296
that there is some bad
red rope licorice

1310
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,757
circulating in the crowd.

1311
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:37,303
Repeat, stay away
from the red rope licorice.

1312
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:40,848
Do not bite any off and chew it.

1313
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:44,435
-It could cause a dental emergency.
-Go! Get off the stage!

1314
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,569
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1315
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,287
Hey, huh?

1316
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,706
Huh? Guys, huh?

1317
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,999
Wayne, Cassandra, you made it!

1318
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:08,584
-Yeah !
-Yeah !

1319
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,128
This is great!

1320
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,342
What are we gonna do?
None of the bands have showed up.

1321
01:24:16,427 --> 01:24:20,388
l don't know, man. Jim Morrison said,
"lf you book them, they will come."

1322
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,599
l don't know, Wayne.
lt doesn't look too good.

1323
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:26,269
Jim?

1324
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:32,191
Jim !

1325
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,822
Wow, we really are in the desert.

1326
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:39,824
Yeah, no guff.

1327
01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:45,580
Wow, Jim Morrison.

1328
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:47,206
Told you so, man.

1329
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,750
How can l help you?

1330
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:51,461
Jim, none of the bands have showed up.

1331
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,005
l know, and they're not gonna show up.

1332
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:57,216
Then why were we
supposed to put on the concert?

1333
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,428
Because you had to try
and do something with your life.

1334
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:02,513
But it was a failure.

1335
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,223
Whether you won or lost,

1336
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:07,351
what's important is
that you gave it your best shot.

1337
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:09,437
l'm sorry, man.

1338
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,563
Okay.

1339
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:11,773
All right.

1340
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:15,026
You'll think of something.
lt's your movie.

1341
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:17,945
Well, thanks a pantload, Chet.

1342
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,363
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1343
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,866
Wayne, where are we?

1344
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:25,203
Whoa. How do we get back?

1345
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,723
Wayne, Wayne. . .

1346
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:49,227
We don't wanna end
the movie this way, do we?

1347
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:50,895
Good call, Garth.

1348
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:54,232
lf we're gonna go down,
let's at least go down in glory.

1349
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:57,735
Let's do the Thelma & Louise ending.
Yeah !

1350
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,793
Let's just keep going, Wayne.

1351
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,212
Okay, Garth.

1352
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:36,107
Hey, we don't wanna
end the movie like this.

1353
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:38,901
Yeah. Let's do the happy ending.

1354
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:40,111
Yeah, yeah.

1355
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:47,368
None of the bands
have showed up, Wayne.

1356
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,663
-What are we gonna do?
-What are we gonna do, you guys?

1357
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:51,789
We could do it on the stage.

1358
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:11,142
You made it! Excellent!

1359
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:12,894
Welcome to Waynestock.

1360
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,061
Yeah !

1361
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:17,732
-All right.
-Thanks for coming.

1362
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:23,404
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

1363
01:27:57,397 --> 01:28:01,192
Jim, why was l supposed to
put on this concert?

1364
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:05,613
Because you had to learn
that it doesn't matter what you do,

1365
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,199
Cassandra loves you for who you are,

1366
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:11,327
and that being an adult means

1367
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:16,415
facing responsibility,
yet still taking the time to have fun.

1368
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:20,461
Right. lt's sort of like
coming home on Friday night

1369
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,463
and doing your homework right away,

1370
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:25,716
so that your Saturday night
is free to just party.

1371
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,636
No, l like the way l said it better.

1372
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,515
Okay.

1373
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:42,650
Excuse me.

1374
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:43,734
Yo!

1375
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:46,278
Over here.
Would you open the gate, please?

1376
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:47,488
l have to get in there.

1377
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:48,823
Sorry, you can't come in.

1378
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,074
My girlfriend is in there.

1379
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,910
Hey, a lot of people's girlfriends
are in there.

1380
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:46,208
Hey, don't cry.

1381
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:49,211
Yeah, we're gonna clean it up. Okay?

1382
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:07,062
See?
