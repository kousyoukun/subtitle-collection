It has a little flower garden.

you can hear the buoys in the harbor.

00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,855
making profiles
of bad sleepers.

311
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,093
I'm looking for
a common psychological link.

312
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:12,195
I hope that the work we do here
will someday be able to help
other people like yourselves.

313
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:15,833
God knows I'm all for helping people,
saving the world,

314
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,606
but doesn't everybody have
a problem sleeping these days?

315
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,909
Life's too frantic.

316
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,915
What about you, Nell?

317
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,418
Um, well, it seems that
you all have trouble sleeping,

318
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,480
because your lives
are exciting,

319
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,890
and it's complicated, and you think
about it when you go to sleep.

320
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,452
But, um, I don't know.
Nothing's ever really happened to me,

321
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,464
so I don't have a reason
to sleep badly.

322
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,525
But in your application
you said you had trouble sleeping.

323
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,333
Mm-hmm, yes,
but it's not like them.

324
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:49,842
It's because, uh, there was
always somebody calling me,

325
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,934
there was always
somebody banging.

326
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:57,172
Ever since I was little,
I took care of my mother.

327
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:02,017
And-- And she would wake up
in the middle of the night.

328
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,615
She would bang with her cane
on the wall.

329
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:09,128
And it was just
this relentless--

330
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,323
it was a relentless banging
all through the night.

331
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,227
That's weird, because even though,
uh, she's dead,

332
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,737
I still hear it
and I wake up.

333

Well, that's why we're here,
Eleanor-- to try and help you.

334
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,377
Yeah, Nell. I think what Dr. Marrow's
trying to say is...

335
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:35,649
that you're a basket case,
just like the rest of us.

Thank you, Mary.

00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:54,502
Okay. Okay.
Why are we here?

340
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,633
Really, to answer
the most basic question:

341
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,405
- What is wrong with you people?
- [ Chuckling ]

342
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:02,505
These are standard
cognitive and perception tests.

343
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,415
I'll be giving you a variety of these
during the course of the week.

344
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:10,479
You are not in competition,
so do not worry about being
the head of the class, okay?

345
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,617
Between all these tests,
you'll have each other--

to keep you company.

- No.

349

And as you were told, there's no
telephone service, there's no TV.

350
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,404
And the caretakers tend to lock the gate
when they leave. However,

351
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,910
I do have my trusty cell telephone,
in case of emergencies, okay?

352
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:40,783
And, um, what's the deal with
the Addams Family mansion?
Because, I gotta be honest,

353
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:44,687
- I don't get a real strong
sleep vibe from this place.
- No. Me too.

354
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,884
[ Dr. Morrow ] I wanted to make sure
you didn't sleep too easily.

355
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:50,521
- [ Luke ] Congratulations.
- Seriously, isolation is essential...

356
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:53,031
in the creation
of an experimental model.

357
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:56,259
This house, who built it?
Who lived here?

358
00:28:56,335 --> 00:29:00,136
Well, actually, that makes
for a very good bedtime story.

359
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,202
Once upon a time,
there was a king who built a castle.

360
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,213
His name was Hugh Crain.

361
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,476
A hundred and thirty years ago,

362
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,111
towns like Concord and Manchester
were the center of American industry.

363
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,155
That's where Crain
made a fortune--

364
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,417
on the backs of workers
in his textile mills.

365
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,016
Now, this man could have
anything he wanted,

366
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,426
but what he wanted
more than anything...

367
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,430
was a house filled
with the laughter of children.

368
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,899
That's why there are
all the carvings.

369
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,096
He married the most beautiful
woman in town, called Rene,

370
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,538
and he built her this house,
or at least some of it.

371
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,099
God, it sounds like
a fairy tale or something.

372
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,111
[ Dr. Morrow ]
But that's where the fairy tale ends.

373
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,977
Hugh and Rene
would have no children.

374
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:45,882
They all died at birth.

375
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,511
Then, a few years later,
Rene, she passed away,

376
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,818
and Crain became
a total recluse.

377
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,826
But he kept on building,
adding room upon room.

378
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:59,297
It's as if he was-- he was building a
home for the family he would never have.

379
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,697
No one had seen
Crain for years.

380
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:04,862
But the townspeople said
that sometimes at night...

381
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:08,236
they could hear sounds
coming from the old house.

382
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,675
Sounds of children.

383
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,114

about Hugh Crain
that I didn't say.

- May I ask you not to tell the women?
- Yeah, yeah.

really scary? I just found this out.

Turns out there's a darker chapter
to the Hugh Crain fairy tale.

Remember his lovely wife,
Rene?

Well, Rene, the town beauty,
she didn't just die. She killed herself.

- Really? He just told you that?
- Yes.

422
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,745
And you can't say anything,
'cause he actually swore me to secrecy.

423
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:31,807
- Why did she kill herself?
- Well, there are the stillborn children,

424
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,818
although I like to think
it was more sinister,

425
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,116
like maybe Hugh Crain was
a horrible monster and drove her to it.

426
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,987
Monster? But he built this house
for the woman that he loved,

427
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,992
like the Taj Mahal.

428
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,426
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace.
It was a tomb.

429
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,522
And equally overdone.

430
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:49,591
- Why didn't he tell us?
- Maybe he doesn't trust women.

431
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,502
Yeah.
I think that's probably it.

432
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:56,372
I think he knew that your fragile,
delicate sensibilities--

After dinner and the first bland history
of Hill House successfully relayed,

Miss Vance appears most susceptible
to suggestive history,

440
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:28,465
evincing a strongly sentimental reaction
to the love-story component.

Mr. Sanderson, who tested at the bottom
of the Mogel Reliability Scale,

was given the second part
of the story.

When he passes the story on,
the experimental haunting fiction...
