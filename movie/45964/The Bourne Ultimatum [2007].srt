Sync Fixed (English Subs) ..by iUrop

2
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:23,070
Send him in.

3
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,616
Will you commit to this program?

4
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:40,816
I can't.

5
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,798
Will you commit to this program?

6
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:05,310
Will you commit to this program?

7
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:08,376
I can't.

8
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:14,841
There's no place it
won't catch up to you.

9
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,384
It's how every story ends.

10
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:20,148
It's what you are, Jason, a killer.

11
00:04:21,356 --> 00:04:22,755
You always will be.

12
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:25,384
Go ahead. Go on.
Go on! Do it! Do it!

13
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:30,622
She wouldn't want me to.

14
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:33,166
That's the only reason you're alive.

15
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,701
Who is "she"?

16
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:37,533
Marie Kreutz, his girlfriend.

17
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:39,266
She was killed in India.

18
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,468
Director of Operations
Ward Abbott arranged it.

19
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:49,576
So we have a dirty section
chief who kills Bourne's girl.

20
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,882
Bourne comes back for revenge,
tapes Abbott's confession...

21
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:55,047
And Abbott commits suicide.

22
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:57,284
Now Bourne's gunning for us.

23
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:00,091
You couldn't make this stuff up.

24
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:05,492
Bourne's last confirmed location
was Moscow, six weeks ago.

25
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:06,590
Right.
Sir.

26
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:08,363
He's on the run.
He's dangerous.

27
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:11,667
Well, sir, with respect, I think
something else could be going on here.

28
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:14,071
What? What's he after?

29
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:17,600
The reason Bourne went to Moscow was
to see the daughter of his first target.

30
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,010
What's your point, Pam?

31
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,605
Maybe he was retracing his steps.

32
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:24,447
He's looking for something.
Something in his past.

33
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,682
Maybe he hasn't found it yet
and we need to know what it is.

34
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:30,588
Are you telling me he's
not a threat to this agency?

35
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:33,593
I think if he wanted to hurt us,
he could have sent the tape to CNN.

36
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:35,458
Maybe he still will.

37
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:41,298
My number one rule is hope for
the best, plan for the worst.

38
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:47,934
As far as I'm concerned, Bourne is still
a serious threat until proven otherwise.

39
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:49,533
Let's keep looking.

40
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,475
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

41
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:37,384
This one's three years ago.
They had half of Interpol after him.

42
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:41,155
Turned up in Naples, Berlin, Moscow...

43
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,924
Disappeared again.

44
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,991
The girl that he was on the run with.

45
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:51,367
Marie Kreutz. She was found dead
in a river halfway round the world.

46
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:54,034
She'd been shot in the head.

47
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,810
What connects the dots?

48
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:11,850
Turn off the tape recorder.

49
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:02,336
Where's my sister?

50
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:08,615
Why don't you sit down?

51
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:21,584
Where is she?

52
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,899
She's dead.

53
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:31,629
She was killed.

54
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:35,173
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,488
I knew this could end this way.

56
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:53,558
It was always gonna end this way.

57
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:55,858
I didn't believe that.

58
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:06,136
And how did she die?

59
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,867
She was shot.

60
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,974
We were together in India.

61
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,077
He came for me.

62
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:24,915
You killed him?

63
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,354
Yes.

64
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:31,921
And now what?

65
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:38,397
Someone started all of this
and I'm gonna find them.

66
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:51,913
Hey. It's me.

67
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:55,251
Yeah. He knows the whole story.

68
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:57,849
Bourne's just the tip of the iceberg.

69
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:00,792
Have you heard of an
Operation Black briar?

70
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:02,962
I'm gonna get my head
around this and type it up.

71
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,156
I'll see you first thing.

72
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,391
Okay.

73
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:23,381
Scanning. Go Sat 21.
I have a hit on ECHELON. Black briar.

74
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:24,941
I repeat, Black briar.

75
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,455
Looks like it's coming
from a European signal.

76
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:30,251
NSA, please confirm your receipt.

77
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,890
I'll bring up the frequency
and the coordinates...

78
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,359
Intercept of our principal...

79
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:36,487
Sir!
What you got?

80
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:39,465
We intercepted a call in London.
Keyword, "Black briar."

81
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:40,898
Okay, send it to New York right away.

82
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:01,879
Track the phone?

83
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:03,981
Registered to a London
reporter named Simon Ross.

84
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:05,685
Works at the Guardian newspaper.

85
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,125
You're tracking him?
Sir. Yeah.

86
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:08,218
Thanks, Mike.

87
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:10,729
We have a survey team
covering him at work...

88
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:12,732
And a sneak and peek's on
their way to his apartment.

89
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,825
Well, who talked to him?
How did he find out about Black briar?

90
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,426
I don't know.
We pulled his background...

91
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:18,472
And ran a cross-check
on any known anomalies.

92
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:21,565
We've come up with nothing. But I think
if we follow Ross, we're gonna be able...

93
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:24,372
Ray, Ross is easy.
We want the source.

94
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,523
Have you heard of an
Operation Black briar?

95
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:44,859
You have details?

96
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:46,331
I'm gonna get my head
around this and type it up.

97
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,732
I'll see you first thing.

98
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:50,566
Is that all?
Yeah.

99
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,674
I want rendition protocols and put
the asset on standby, just in case.

100
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:02,342
People, listen up!
This is a full priority situation.

101
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,940
Jimmy, give me Ross' profile on one.

102
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:05,610
Yes, sir.

103
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,320
Our target is a British national, Simon Ross.
A reporter.

104
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:16,125
I want all his phones,
his Blackberry, his apartment, his car...

105
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:18,427
Bank accounts, credit cards,
travel patterns.

106
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:20,592
I want to know what he's
gonna think before he does.

107
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:22,465
Every dirty little secret he has.

108
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:26,870
And most of all, we want the name
and real-time location of his source.

109
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:30,172
This is NSA priority
level four. Any questions?

110
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:33,710
All right, let's get to it.

111
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:07,237
What?

112
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:11,616
Will you commit to this program?

113
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,053
I can't.

114
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,304
Copy that.
Mr. Wills, the subject is entering his office.

115
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:13,744
Give me some eyeballs on the street.

116
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,145
Where's my picture, please?

117
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:16,649
Coming online.

118
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:18,207
Online now.

119
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:21,981
Jimmy, how you doing
with the phone line?

120
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:24,957
Yeah, we have an office line.
We're working on his cell.

121
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:27,016
How long?
An hour, sir.

122
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:28,653
That's too long.

123
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,020
So how do we know he's
not spinning for someone?

124
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:33,225
There was more. He was scared.

125
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,666
Scared about what?
Black briar.

126
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:38,868
Sorry. Call for you.
Who is it?

127
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:40,930
Won't give his name.

128
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:42,339
Excuse me.

129
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:46,036
He's on my line.
Thanks.

130
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:49,975
Simon Ross.

131
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,381
Camera three, screen.

132
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:52,749
Why aren't we hearing this?

133
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,516
Jimmy? That's a hard line, Jimmy.
Why don't we have it?

134
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,888
We have his line, sir, but he's not on it.
He's using a different phone.

135
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,291
I've been reading your stories.

136
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:03,957
Who is this?
This is Jason Bourne.

137
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:08,466
Waterloo Station. South entrance.
Thirty minutes. Come alone.

138
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:14,038
Get me audio as soon as you can, Ted.

139
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:15,598
Street teams Alpha, Bravo.

140
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:17,109
Okay, guys, let's work it. Come on.

141
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:18,940
Where's he going?

142
00:15:19,013 --> 00:15:22,073
Okay, he is on the move.
Give me eyeballs on the street. Let's go.

143
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:36,423
Subject exiting the building.

144
00:15:36,497 --> 00:15:38,897
All right, everyone,
let's find out where he's going.

145
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:45,968
Mobile One, I need audio.

146
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,337
Audio engaged.

147
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:49,137
Mobile One should have him.
Mobile One should have him.

148
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,042
Get Mobile One on it.
Let me know when you hear it.

149
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:54,512
Hi. Waterloo Station,
south entrance.

150
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:55,741
Mr. Wills.
Where's he going?

151
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:57,113
Destination is Waterloo Station.

152
00:15:57,184 --> 00:15:58,208
Okay, Waterloo Station.

153
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:00,753
Give me eyes at Waterloo.
Put everyone in play.

154
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:02,846
Let's activate the asset.
Mobilize Tracker Three.

155
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:24,333
Are we at the bridge yet?
Not yet, sir.

156
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:25,503
Okay, Mobile Three,
tell them to stay back.

157
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,603
Sir.

158
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,874
Please maintain visual contact.

159
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:44,425
Prepaid phone.

160
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,157
Here you go.

161
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:58,909
Mobile One, give me the
subject's current location.

162
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:02,341
Copy that.

163
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,852
Sir, the subject is arriving at the
south entrance of Waterloo Station.

164
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:51,987
Hello?

165
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:53,226
Give me that on five and seven as well.

166
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,392
Jimmy, I need that phone.

167
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:57,803
I want you to listen very carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

168
00:17:57,871 --> 00:17:58,929
What the hell's going on?

169
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:02,237
Ten o'clock, to your left, across the street,
there's a silver Chrysler Voyager.

170
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,573
There's a surveillance team inside.

171
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:06,613
Directly across the
street, twelve noon...

172
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,614
There's a man on the
second story, static post.

173
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:10,377
He's watching you.

174
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:13,216
Now, there's a bus stop
50 meters to your left.

175
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:14,276
I want you to walk towards it.

176
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:16,322
Jimmy, I need that phone!
I need it yesterday.

177
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,483
He's on the move.
He's on the move.

178
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,719
That's not his phone, sir.

179
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:20,817
Say again?

180
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:22,020
That's not his phone, sir.

181
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:23,358
What do you mean that's not his phone?

182
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,159
Where the hell did he get another phone?

183
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,295
Well, no, you just have to...

184
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,800
Grab Team B, stand by.

185
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:30,200
Grab Team B.
We're in position.

186
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,329
All right, there's a man
in a blue hooded sweatshirt.

187
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:35,432
He's talking on a phone.
Walk directly to him and stop.

188
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:38,307
Jimmy, we need the call.
I need that cell phone.

189
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,778
Do not let him get out of sight.

190
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:42,782
All right, turn around.

191
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:49,514
Okay, who's the guy in the blue hood?

192
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,421
Is that his contact?

193
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,585
All right, there's a bus coming.
It'll be there in ten seconds.

194
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:57,960
When it stops, I want you to
walk directly to your left.

195
00:18:58,031 --> 00:19:00,898
There's an overpass. Go up the stairs.
Stop at the newsstand.

196
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:02,435
You'll get further instructions.

197
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:04,130
Okay. Okay.

198
00:19:04,204 --> 00:19:05,296
Get ready to move.

199
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:06,796
Watch that bus.
Watch that bus.

200
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:08,102
What? All right, what's going on?

201
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:09,574
Somebody tell me. We lost the feed.
Grab Team B.

202
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:11,304
Intercept the contact
and stay with Ross.

203
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:16,711
Hey! Stop!

204
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:20,910
Mobile One.
Target's on the move.

205
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:24,514
Okay, he's on the move.
Do not lose Ross.

206
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:26,491
Blue hood! Down! Now!

207
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:31,956
Go! Let's go.

208
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:33,397
Oh, shit.

209
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:38,126
What the hell was that?

210
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:43,534
Sir, we've lost all
communication with Mobile One.

211
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:51,012
To the right! Heading west.
Let us know when you get a visual!

212
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:53,143
What was the last
known position, please?

213
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,656
On the walkway,
heading towards the concourse, sir.

214
00:19:56,723 --> 00:20:00,819
It's a surveillance nightmare.
It's the busiest terminal in London.

215
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:02,623
Give me all of CCTV's eyes.

216
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:03,720
On it, sir.

217
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:05,592
Sir, asset's on scene.

218
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,815
Who's your source?

219
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:34,326
What's his name?
What's your source's name?

220
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:36,760
Look, what's going on?
Why are these people after me?

221
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,127
Because you found something.

222
00:20:38,198 --> 00:20:40,098
You talked to someone
inside Tread stone.

223
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,964
Someone who was there at
the beginning. Who is it?

224
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:43,332
You know I can't tell you that.

225
00:20:43,403 --> 00:20:47,737
You have no idea what you're into here.
These people will kill you, if they have to.

226
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:49,867
Was it Black briar?
Is that what this is?

227
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:51,240
What's Black briar?

228
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:54,747
Tread stone upgrade.
My source told me it all started with you.

229
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:58,080
He said that you were square one,
the dirty little secret.

230
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:00,381
He said he knows who you are.

231
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:06,084
All right, we have to move.

232
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:08,622
Answer your phone.

233
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,932
Coming online.
You got visual?

234
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:16,401
Where the hell is he, people?

235
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:22,973
Do exactly as I say.
I need you to move up to your right.

236
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:25,307
First escalator on the right.

237
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:42,518
Tie your shoe. Tie your shoe
right now. Tie your shoe.

238
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:50,661
Wait.

239
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:52,864
Wait.

240
00:21:57,644 --> 00:22:00,340
I'm gonna walk by you.
I want you to move along the far wall...

241
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:04,407
To your left in four,
three, two, one.

242
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:05,849
Stand up.

243
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,284
That's it.

244
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,819
Where the hell is he?

245
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:13,951
We cannot afford to
lose this guy, people.

246
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:22,033
All right, that line you're on is good.
Stay on that line. Stay on that line.

247
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:24,969
I've gotta go and pick up the kids.
Can you go and get the shopping done?

248
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,166
Oh, the bin man,
I think he's one of them.

249
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:29,970
The garbage man? Negative.

250
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:32,841
Oh, Jesus. Jesus!
He's reaching for something.

251
00:22:32,913 --> 00:22:34,005
Oh, God, he's got a gun.
Stay on the line.

252
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,514
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.

253
00:22:35,582 --> 00:22:37,209
Stay on the line you're on.
Do not deviate.

254
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:41,452
Okay, there he is!
Here he goes.

255
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:42,545
Grab Team A. Go!

256
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:43,782
He's still talking to somebody.

257
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:45,552
He's getting instructions.
Jimmy, get me the conversation.

258
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,956
Mobile Two, I want...
Come on, lock the box.

259
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:48,585
Lock the box.
Move in, Grab Team C.

260
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:52,364
Hurry, Ross. We gotta move.

261
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:54,059
Okay, move through this crowd.
Move through this crowd.

262
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:55,829
Get undercover right now.
Move through this crowd.

263
00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:05,233
Get in the store.

264
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:07,280
There's someone on your tail.
Get in the store.

265
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:08,837
You're gonna proceed out the east exit.

266
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:12,043
That's to your right as
you come into the store.

267
00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:22,055
Head into the liquor
store in front of you.

268
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:24,597
Go into the back and lock the door.

269
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,362
Mobile Four is down.

270
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:31,396
This guy's got help.
Tell me when the asset's in the nest.

271
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:37,710
Get me a feed in there!

272
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:40,975
I want Grab Team C in there.
Tell me what's going on.

273
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:49,882
Team Four is mobile.

274
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:30,453
Jesus Christ.

275
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:33,589
That's Jason Bourne.

276
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:36,761
He's picking us apart.
Do you think he's the source?

277
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:38,461
He's gotta be.

278
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:44,672
Block all the exits.
Give the asset a green light.

279
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:47,742
Take them both out.

280
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:06,923
Stay there.

281
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:11,802
I'm gonna get us out of here.
You gotta do exactly what I say.

282
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:14,935
Listen to me!
This isn't some story in a newspaper.

283
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,102
This is real.
You understand me?

284
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:19,772
Okay.

285
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:31,546
Call all agents back.

286
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:34,116
Give Bourne's location at the
back of the store to the asset.

287
00:25:34,194 --> 00:25:35,183
Yes, sir.

288
00:25:53,713 --> 00:25:55,340
Kill the cameras.

289
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:03,447
Bourne.
Wait. Something's not right.

290
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,558
I can see the entrance from here.
If I go now, I can make it.

291
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:11,823
Bourne?

292
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:13,661
Just stay where you are.

293
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,926
I don't think we should wait!

294
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,238
I think someone's coming.

295
00:26:19,306 --> 00:26:20,364
I'm going for it.

296
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,600
No, no, no, no, no!

297
00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:07,175
We have a situation.

298
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:13,677
Yeah.

299
00:28:13,753 --> 00:28:15,482
Director Kramer would like to see you.

300
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:16,681
We need to get those warrants...

301
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:19,054
He said it's urgent.

302
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:21,417
What the police will tell me is that
they believe the victim is 35-year-old...

303
00:29:21,488 --> 00:29:24,889
Simon Ross, a well-known
journalist based here in London...

304
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,721
With the Guardian newspaper.

305
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:29,387
It appears that he was gunned down...

306
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:32,124
Right in the middle of the
Waterloo Station concourse...

307
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:34,758
Around 3:45 this afternoon...

308
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:37,530
In full view of hundreds of commuters.

309
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:39,162
Over the years,
he's uncovered a lot of...

310
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:42,206
Unsavory stories about terror...

311
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:45,540
That have upset certain
Western governments and...

312
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:10,765
Hi, how are you?
Right over there?

313
00:30:10,837 --> 00:30:12,031
All right.

314
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:14,205
Good morning, sir. Can I take your order?
Yes.

315
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:19,143
I'll have the Heart-healthy omelet
with goat cheese and peppers, please.

316
00:30:19,212 --> 00:30:21,112
Anything for you, ma'am?
Just coffee, please.

317
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:22,341
Are you sure? I'm buying.

318
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:23,507
I'm good.

319
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,377
So, when the Director called and it
was suggested that we bring you on...

320
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:32,424
Suggested? You sure it
was just a suggestion?

321
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:41,591
You know, it's funny how
different things look...

322
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:44,466
Depending on where you sit, right?

323
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:47,102
I look at this as a
favor for you, Pam...

324
00:30:47,173 --> 00:30:50,438
Giving you an opportunity to
complete some unfinished business.

325
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,738
Meaning?

326
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:55,503
Bourne. He's here.
He's a threat.

327
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:57,940
And we both want the same thing.

328
00:30:58,017 --> 00:31:00,577
But we both go about it
in two very different ways.

329
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:03,178
The past is past, Pam.
All right?

330
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:05,621
We were careless in Stockholm.

331
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:07,353
So what was Waterloo?
Just careless again?

332
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:10,794
We had a leak. A serious
national security situation.

333
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:13,731
Bourne showed up on our surveillance
and we had very little time to react.

334
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,098
And a reporter got killed.

335
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:19,104
Bourne saw us coming.
The question is what was he doing there?

336
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,605
No, the real question
is how you managed...

337
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:23,164
To get into a firefight
at a public train station.

338
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:26,337
You know as well as I do decisions
made in real time are never perfect.

339
00:31:26,412 --> 00:31:30,508
Don't second-guess an
operation from an armchair.

340
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:36,748
I'll see you at the office.

341
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:39,023
Enjoy your egg whites.

342
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:00,512
People!

343
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,743
This is Pamela Landy and
her associate, Tom Cronin.

344
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:06,148
She's gonna be quarterbacking
the search effort.

345
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:07,709
Say your names.
State your specs, please.

346
00:32:07,787 --> 00:32:11,848
Well, let's do names later, okay?
What's Bourne's last fixed position?

347
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:13,392
London, 1200 Zulu.

348
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:15,484
Status. What is he?
Armed? Wounded?

349
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,291
Alive, mobile and unknown.

350
00:32:18,364 --> 00:32:19,854
Do we have an ECHELON package?
Yes.

351
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:21,992
Why isn't it on?
We were waiting.

352
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:24,332
Waiting? For what?
What... Listen...

353
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:27,430
People, do you have any
idea who you're dealing with?

354
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:28,667
This is Jason Bourne.

355
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:32,233
You are nine hours behind the
toughest target you have ever tracked.

356
00:32:32,312 --> 00:32:36,715
Now, I want everyone to sit down,
strap in and turn on all you've got.

357
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:39,679
That would mean now!

358
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,185
Thank you.

359
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:42,687
Give me a team deployment plan.

360
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:45,883
I want everything you
got on Ross on screen one.

361
00:33:08,314 --> 00:33:09,872
Sir, I think we have something.

362
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:11,917
We just hacked Ross' e-mail
account at the Guardian.

363
00:33:11,985 --> 00:33:14,579
Found a round-trip ticket
to Turin, Italy, yesterday.

364
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:17,282
0800 arrival, 1205 departure.

365
00:33:17,357 --> 00:33:20,884
I think we can be pretty certain
that Bourne's not your source, then.

366
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,018
How?

367
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:24,620
Ross's call to his editor where
he said he'd just met the source...

368
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:27,723
Took place just after
his Turin flight landed.

369
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,961
He met his source in Turin.
So?

370
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:32,561
What? So, what? Bourne met
Ross in Turin for breakfast...

371
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:35,937
And then at noon the same day Bourne
calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo?

372
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:37,874
Maybe they were even on the same flight.

373
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:39,842
Pull up everything you've got.

374
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:43,177
Cross-check the secure cell phone
usage of everyone with SCI clearance...

375
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:46,377
Against all calls going in and out of Turin, Italy,
the morning Ross was there.

376
00:33:46,452 --> 00:33:49,979
This guy you're after is a CIA operative
with clearance above top secret.

377
00:33:50,056 --> 00:33:52,786
He's committing treason
by talking to Ross.

378
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:53,883
Do you really think while doing that...

379
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,053
He's gonna use a cell phone
that he knows we can track?

380
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:57,824
Zero results on the cross-check.

381
00:33:57,897 --> 00:33:59,626
So, you got any better ideas?

382
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,860
Yeah, look at all the people whose
cell phones were switched off...

383
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,595
The entire period Ross was in Turin.

384
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:05,466
I mean, if your people are on
their phones as much as mine...

385
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:07,904
The list should be pretty small.

386
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:16,175
Three names. Tom Brewster,
Jack Boulin and Neal Daniels.

387
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:19,082
Okay, now check everything in
Ross' apartment against those names.

388
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:20,813
Check for common patterns.

389
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:23,321
Look for anything that
indicates who Ross met.

390
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:25,687
Pull up his socials.
Pull it up.

391
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:27,157
See those documents?

392
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:28,784
Break it.

393
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,555
Over here. What is that?

394
00:34:31,798 --> 00:34:34,494
All right. Right there.
Initials.

395
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:37,297
Pull that up.
Bring that up on main.

396
00:34:41,307 --> 00:34:42,797
Neal Daniels.

397
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,706
He's station chief in Madrid, isn't he?

398
00:34:44,777 --> 00:34:46,005
Yeah.

399
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,781
All right, call the RSO at the embassy.

400
00:34:51,851 --> 00:34:54,217
Have them take Daniels into custody,
if he is there.

401
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,154
Anna, get grab teams to
the Calle Norte safe house.

402
00:34:57,223 --> 00:34:59,748
Send them in heavy.
Tell them we'll assist with the entry.

403
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:01,919
Heavy? Daniels isn't
really that much of a...

404
00:35:01,994 --> 00:35:03,359
I'm worried about Bourne.

405
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:04,919
If he is not the source...

406
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:07,465
Then he is after the source,
the same as we are.

407
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,767
ETA, Team Two.

408
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:44,325
Three minutes to destination, sir.

409
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:12,154
Your mission will save American lives.

410
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:20,164
Really give yourself to this program.

411
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,167
I can't.

412
00:36:22,608 --> 00:36:23,836
You can.

413
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:04,213
Sir, they're at the front door.

414
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:24,602
Five seconds.
Put it up live.

415
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:34,543
We're in.

416
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:39,948
The alarm's down.

417
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:42,076
That's gotta be Bourne.

418
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:57,161
The safe is empty.
Shit.

419
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:59,033
Looks like he left in a hurry.

420
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:00,436
Track Daniels' passports.

421
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:01,768
Stand by.

422
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:35,201
Hammond.

423
00:38:59,832 --> 00:39:01,629
God damn it!
Get a backup team in there!

424
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:16,306
Get me a secure line in there.
Get the second team over there now!

425
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:28,416
What are you doing here?

426
00:39:29,862 --> 00:39:32,194
I was posted here after Berlin.

427
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:37,028
Where's Daniels?

428
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:40,938
Where is he?

429
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,719
Hello?

430
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:06,992
Who is this?

431
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,000
This is Nicky Parsons.

432
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:13,739
She was Tread stone.
Logistics.

433
00:40:13,806 --> 00:40:16,969
She was with us when we
hunted Bourne in Berlin.

434
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:23,377
Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge.

435
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:25,144
Code in, Sparrow.

436
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:36,486
Response, Everest.

437
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:45,731
Nicky, this is Noah Vosen.
How long have you been on-site?

438
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:47,466
I just walked in.

439
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:52,272
We have two officers on-site.
Are you in contact with them?

440
00:40:55,614 --> 00:40:58,913
They're down.
Unconscious but alive.

441
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:04,885
Any sign of Neal Daniels?

442
00:41:04,957 --> 00:41:06,015
No.

443
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:08,819
Nicky, this is Pam Landy.

444
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:11,630
We have reason to believe
there's a connection between...

445
00:41:11,697 --> 00:41:13,995
Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.

446
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:19,661
Bourne? You're still looking for Bourne?
I thought that case was closed.

447
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:22,571
No, some people are
convinced he's still a threat.

448
00:41:22,641 --> 00:41:25,109
I disagree, but to find
out I need to talk to him.

449
00:41:25,177 --> 00:41:26,769
Hold on, Nicky.

450
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:30,607
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to send him a message.

451
00:41:30,683 --> 00:41:33,049
You don't think Bourne is a threat?
He just took out two more of my men.

452
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:34,710
The only way this has
a happy ending, Noah...

453
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:36,015
Is if we bring him in alive.

454
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:38,022
He is going after Daniels.

455
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,819
He wants revenge, Pam,
and the only realistic way...

456
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:41,917
To end this is to eliminate the threat.

457
00:41:41,994 --> 00:41:43,894
How long until backup?

458
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:47,859
Nicky, I need you to stay
put and secure the premises.

459
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:51,835
Backup will be arriving in approximately one hour.
Do you copy?

460
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:56,138
Copy, sir.

461
00:42:01,113 --> 00:42:02,375
How long do I have?

462
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:03,540
Three minutes.

463
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:07,779
My car's outside.

464
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,312
I know where Daniels is.

465
00:42:30,142 --> 00:42:31,609
Come on.

466
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:33,608
Two minutes
to destination, sir.

467
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,805
Grab Teams A and B...

468
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:36,674
Where was Daniels headed?

469
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:41,118
At 8:00 this morning,
he wired $100,000 to a bank account in Tangier.

470
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:45,755
Right, that's 300 miles away.
If we hurry, we can make the morning ferry.

471
00:42:46,892 --> 00:42:47,881
Where are you parked?

472
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,225
To the right, 20 meters,
north side of the street.

473
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:57,961
They're coming.

474
00:42:58,037 --> 00:42:59,129
Keep moving.

475
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:03,034
Two subjects seen exiting safe house.

476
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:16,111
What the hell is this?

477
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:18,948
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no!

478
00:43:25,631 --> 00:43:27,394
What the hell just happened?

479
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:29,127
We've lost visual contact
with the subjects, sir.

480
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:30,190
Christ!

481
00:43:32,771 --> 00:43:36,935
Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne,
effective immediately.

482
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:40,407
Send out a system one alert
to all Spanish contacts.

483
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:44,609
I want all air and ground
border exits locked down.

484
00:44:06,038 --> 00:44:07,665
What's going on?

485
00:44:09,408 --> 00:44:11,239
What's Daniels got?

486
00:44:12,811 --> 00:44:14,972
What's Operation Black briar?

487
00:44:17,016 --> 00:44:20,782
Do you want to tell me,
or should I call Kramer and ask him?

488
00:44:24,523 --> 00:44:26,616
For Christ's sake, Pam,
we're in the middle of an operation.

489
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:27,989
Bullshit.

490
00:44:29,228 --> 00:44:31,219
You want Jason Bourne...

491
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:33,654
Level with me.

492
00:44:41,707 --> 00:44:45,541
Operation Black briar started
as an NEAT surveillance program.

493
00:44:45,611 --> 00:44:46,805
And what is it now?

494
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:50,212
It is now the umbrella
program for all our black ops.

495
00:44:50,282 --> 00:44:54,048
Full envelope intrusion, rendition,
experimental interrogation...

496
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,417
Is all run out of this office.

497
00:44:58,357 --> 00:45:01,485
We are the sharp end
of the stick now, Pam.

498
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,084
Lethal action?

499
00:45:04,063 --> 00:45:05,860
If we have to, sure.

500
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:10,602
That's what makes us special.
No more red tape.

501
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,663
No more getting the bad
guys caught in our sights...

502
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,001
Then watching them escape...

503
00:45:15,074 --> 00:45:17,235
While we wait for someone in
Washington to issue the order.

504
00:45:18,744 --> 00:45:20,177
Oh, come on.

505
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:25,475
You've seen the raw intel, Pam.
You know how real the danger is.

506
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:28,076
We need these programs now.

507
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:30,121
What's the connection to Daniels?

508
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:33,886
He ran all of our operations in
Southern Europe and North Africa...

509
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,392
So he has everything.

510
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:39,158
Names, dates, ghost sites,
who's cooperating with us abroad.

511
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:41,096
Every operation.

512
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,999
You want that stuff in Bourne's hands,
out on the market to the highest bidder?

513
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:45,730
I don't think so.

514
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:51,302
Bourne's not after money.
He's after Daniels for a reason.

515
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:54,705
Well, what does it matter
what Bourne is after?

516
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,181
When we find Daniels, and,
believe me, we'll find him...

517
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,945
If you're right...

518
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:02,519
We get Bourne, too.

519
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:33,083
Why did you come back?

520
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,686
Why are you looking for Daniels?

521
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:49,357
Do you know who that is?

522
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,327
That's Daniels.

523
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,799
I don't know who that is.
Who is he?

524
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:04,745
He was there at the beginning.

525
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:07,876
I remember meeting him.

526
00:47:10,355 --> 00:47:11,947
The first day.

527
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:14,083
Daniels brought me to him.

528
00:47:16,762 --> 00:47:19,094
That's where it all started for me.

529
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:23,700
Something happened to me and
I need to know what it was...

530
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:28,272
Or I'll never be free of this.

531
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:32,042
Daniels said the
training was experimental.

532
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:36,781
Behavior modification.

533
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:41,513
They had to break down the agents
before they became operational.

534
00:47:43,255 --> 00:47:45,587
He said you were the first one.

535
00:47:48,694 --> 00:47:50,685
Why are you helping me?

536
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:03,565
It was difficult for me...

537
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:06,474
With you.

538
00:48:22,327 --> 00:48:24,852
You really don't remember anything.

539
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:29,892
No.

540
00:48:38,577 --> 00:48:40,204
We have to move.

541
00:48:49,855 --> 00:48:53,120
Sir? Mr. Wills?
You're gonna want to look at this.

542
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:05,563
He's in Tangier.

543
00:49:12,511 --> 00:49:13,944
Noah Vosen.

544
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:25,255
We have found Daniels.

545
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:32,661
They've just tracked Daniels'
passport to a hotel in Tangier.

546
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:34,631
They're holding up a bank transfer
he made to keep him in place...

547
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,396
While they bring an
asset up from Casablanca.

548
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:38,959
They're gonna take him out.

549
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:48,268
Yeah.

550
00:49:48,347 --> 00:49:50,372
It's Pam Landy.
She says it's urgent.

551
00:49:52,184 --> 00:49:53,617
Tell her I'm unavailable.

552
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:54,709
Yes, sir.

553
00:50:49,408 --> 00:50:51,740
Sir, asset has arrived at the airport.

554
00:51:13,965 --> 00:51:16,433
Give me the subject's location.

555
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:19,766
Subject is now on foot and
entering Hotel Velasquez.

556
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:21,897
Hotel is 2.2 kilometers from the bank.

557
00:51:23,742 --> 00:51:26,939
All right, get an elevation
and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe.

558
00:51:27,012 --> 00:51:28,138
Locate the room.

559
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:29,646
Give the asset subject location...

560
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:31,648
And the route between the
subject's hotel and the bank.

561
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:49,390
Do we have that room yet?

562
00:51:49,468 --> 00:51:51,698
Yes, sir. It's room 117.

563
00:51:52,304 --> 00:51:54,670
All right, get a hold
of the hotel trunk line.

564
00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:58,334
Run all calls through here
with an ISO on room 117.

565
00:52:11,957 --> 00:52:14,221
His location's being
blocked by the firewall.

566
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:16,726
No, they found Daniels.
They know where he is.

567
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:18,626
They'll get one of the
operatives to terminate him.

568
00:52:18,697 --> 00:52:20,187
Find out who.

569
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:25,195
Desh.

570
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:30,974
Tell him you're gonna meet him
and you have a new phone for him.

571
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:33,203
If you stop Desh,
they'll just get someone else.

572
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:35,269
No, we're not gonna stop him,
we're gonna follow him.

573
00:52:35,347 --> 00:52:36,609
He'll take us right to Daniels.

574
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:17,549
Sir, the asset is deviating off course.

575
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,391
Let it play.

576
00:53:53,758 --> 00:53:55,692
Asset unscheduled stop.

577
00:54:26,358 --> 00:54:29,225
Sir, asset is on the
move en route to subject.

578
00:54:29,294 --> 00:54:31,455
Sir, we have an unauthorized breach.

579
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:34,726
Someone with active system
knowledge penetrated our protocol.

580
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:38,667
Instructions were sent to
the asset at 1411 local time.

581
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:40,432
Trace is confirmed and valid.

582
00:54:40,505 --> 00:54:43,804
It came from a computer
belonging to Nicky Parsons.

583
00:54:47,379 --> 00:54:49,244
Where did the course deviation occur?

584
00:54:49,314 --> 00:54:51,908
South to Rue de Belgique,
stationary Place de France.

585
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:55,143
That's where Parsons is.

586
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,450
When we're finished with Daniels,
send the asset after her.

587
00:54:57,522 --> 00:54:58,511
Yes, sir.

588
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,820
We find Parsons,
we find Bourne.

589
00:55:00,892 --> 00:55:02,917
Noah, what are you doing?

590
00:55:03,295 --> 00:55:04,887
Not now.
I wanna know what's going on.

591
00:55:04,963 --> 00:55:06,328
I said not now!

592
00:55:06,398 --> 00:55:08,696
What basis are you
continuing this operation on?

593
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:11,600
On the basis that Nicky Parsons
has compromised a covert operation.

594
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:12,864
She is up to her neck in this!

595
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:14,598
This is about Daniels, not Nicky!

596
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:15,867
She has betrayed us.

597
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,532
You don't know the circumstances, Noah.

598
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:19,406
She's in league with Jason Bourne,
for Christ's sakes!

599
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:22,344
You do not have the
authority to kill her!

600
00:55:22,414 --> 00:55:25,508
Oh, yes, I do. And you
had better get on board.

601
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,551
Noah, she's one of us.

602
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:30,588
You start down this path,
where does it end?

603
00:55:31,222 --> 00:55:33,190
It ends when we've won.

604
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:49,539
When we're finished with Daniels,
send the asset after them.

605
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:50,767
Yes, sir.

606
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:52,901
Okay, come on.
Stand by...

607
00:56:13,365 --> 00:56:14,798
Two minutes, sir.
Two minutes.

608
00:56:14,866 --> 00:56:17,596
Tell the bank to release the funds.

609
00:56:32,917 --> 00:56:34,077
Hello?

610
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,921
He's on the move.

611
00:57:21,966 --> 00:57:23,058
On it, sir.

612
00:57:23,134 --> 00:57:24,294
Two hundred meters.

613
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:26,166
Okay, come on, I want to lay
in some preliminary tracking.

614
00:57:36,414 --> 00:57:37,608
Stop!

615
01:09:19,668 --> 01:09:22,000
Code it in.
We need to be dead.

616
01:09:29,811 --> 01:09:32,678
Sir? Asset confirms
both targets are down.

617
01:09:43,258 --> 01:09:44,782
I want to be sure about this.

618
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:46,952
Ask the station chief from
Rabat to confirm the deaths...

619
01:09:47,028 --> 01:09:48,757
And do a sub-rosa
collection of the bodies.

620
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,821
I want to tie this thing off completely.

621
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:52,958
And keep an eye on Landy.

622
01:10:03,044 --> 01:10:04,068
Yeah?

623
01:10:04,145 --> 01:10:05,806
Bourne and Nicky Parsons are dead.

624
01:10:06,381 --> 01:10:07,712
You sure about that?

625
01:10:07,782 --> 01:10:10,649
Our station chief in
Rabat is confirming.

626
01:10:12,087 --> 01:10:14,555
I can't afford to have
this come back to me.

627
01:10:15,523 --> 01:10:17,787
Don't worry.
You're protected.

628
01:10:18,193 --> 01:10:20,855
Just remember why we put Landy there.

629
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,921
If Black briar goes south...

630
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,968
We'll roll it up, hang it
around her neck and start over.

631
01:11:35,403 --> 01:11:37,303
I can see their faces.

632
01:11:43,278 --> 01:11:45,337
Everyone I ever killed.

633
01:11:47,849 --> 01:11:50,113
I just don't know their names.

634
01:12:05,834 --> 01:12:07,768
Marie used to try to...

635
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:12,533
Help me remember the names.

636
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:27,249
I've tried to apologize for...

637
01:12:28,256 --> 01:12:30,019
For what I've done.

638
01:12:33,795 --> 01:12:35,319
For what I am.

639
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:40,565
None of it makes it any better.

640
01:12:56,718 --> 01:12:59,152
They're gonna come for you again.

641
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,389
You're gonna have to run now.

642
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:31,801
We should go.

643
01:15:00,675 --> 01:15:02,233
It gets easier.

644
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:06,729
Station chief in Rabat just called.

645
01:16:06,808 --> 01:16:08,503
They found a body.

646
01:16:11,012 --> 01:16:12,570
Bourne?
Desh.

647
01:16:19,887 --> 01:16:21,946
Pam. You need to see this.

648
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:32,397
A passport for Gilberto de
Piento just cleared immigration.

649
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:35,868
It's an early Tread stone identity
registered to Jason Bourne...

650
01:16:35,937 --> 01:16:39,031
But he never used it,
and it never went to the grid.

651
01:16:39,107 --> 01:16:40,665
Bourne's alive.

652
01:16:48,282 --> 01:16:49,306
They don't know?

653
01:16:49,384 --> 01:16:52,376
Well, if they knew,
Vosen wouldn't be in his office right now.

654
01:16:52,453 --> 01:16:53,920
It's a hell of a risk.

655
01:16:55,223 --> 01:16:57,691
Maybe Bourne wants us to know.

656
01:16:57,759 --> 01:17:01,126
Just like Naples.
Maybe he's communicating.

657
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:04,355
Maybe he's trying to
communicate with you.

658
01:17:04,432 --> 01:17:06,798
Then we should communicate back.

659
01:17:07,769 --> 01:17:09,760
I think I know what
Bourne's looking for.

660
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:21,046
Gilberto de Piento.
Gilberto de Piento.

661
01:17:21,115 --> 01:17:23,413
Your party is waiting for you.

662
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:57,267
Pamela Landy.

663
01:18:57,345 --> 01:18:59,279
I hear you're still looking for me.

664
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,910
Bourne?

665
01:19:03,985 --> 01:19:05,646
What do you want?

666
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,214
Yeah?

667
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:12,555
Better get in here.
We got a situation.

668
01:19:13,394 --> 01:19:14,520
I...

669
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,826
I wanted to thank you for the tape.

670
01:19:20,134 --> 01:19:23,194
It's all tied off. It's over.

671
01:19:23,271 --> 01:19:25,501
I guess I owe you an apology.

672
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:28,605
Is that official?

673
01:19:28,676 --> 01:19:31,543
No. Off the record.
You know how it is.

674
01:19:31,612 --> 01:19:32,601
You tracing this?

675
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,170
Fifty seconds to trace.

676
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:36,148
Goodbye.
Wait. Wait.

677
01:19:38,986 --> 01:19:41,420
David Webb.
That's your real name.

678
01:19:43,424 --> 01:19:47,258
You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa, Missouri.

679
01:19:48,029 --> 01:19:51,055
Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it?

680
01:19:51,933 --> 01:19:54,163
Something is very wrong here.

681
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:57,801
Bourne?

682
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:01,308
Get some rest, Pam.

683
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:02,967
You look tired.

684
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:07,338
He's looking right at her.

685
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:11,443
People, listen up!

686
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,419
This is a national security emergency.

687
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:15,455
We have an imminent threat.

688
01:20:15,523 --> 01:20:17,184
I'm going out there.

689
01:20:17,258 --> 01:20:19,624
If I show myself, he'll find me.

690
01:20:19,694 --> 01:20:22,561
Jason Bourne is alive and is
at large in New York City...

691
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:25,030
And, we believe,
within 1,000 yards of this building.

692
01:20:25,099 --> 01:20:27,761
I want an immediate 12-block
lockdown of the area.

693
01:20:27,835 --> 01:20:29,393
Send a flash message to Langley.

694
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:31,802
Prep for local backup assistance.

695
01:20:33,941 --> 01:20:35,374
Landy just left the building!

696
01:20:35,443 --> 01:20:36,876
Stay with her phone.

697
01:20:53,794 --> 01:20:56,922
She's using her cell.
There's an incoming text.

698
01:20:56,998 --> 01:20:58,226
Get it.
Working on it, sir.

699
01:20:58,299 --> 01:20:59,391
How many do we have on Landy?

700
01:20:59,467 --> 01:21:00,627
Six men.
More on the way.

701
01:21:00,701 --> 01:21:03,932
I've got it, sir!
Coming up on the screen now.

702
01:21:07,675 --> 01:21:10,940
Anybody not on Landy goes
directly to Tudor City.

703
01:21:11,012 --> 01:21:13,480
Get the vehicles.
We're going mobile.

704
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:16,545
Team Two. Team Two.
All teams, call in.

705
01:21:52,753 --> 01:21:54,311
178th.

706
01:21:58,759 --> 01:22:00,488
There's only one way out of there.
Why would he do that?

707
01:22:00,561 --> 01:22:01,858
He's trapping himself.

708
01:22:01,929 --> 01:22:03,692
It's a bad place to meet.
It's too exposed.

709
01:22:03,764 --> 01:22:05,698
He wouldn't have chosen it
if he didn't have a reason.

710
01:22:11,706 --> 01:22:13,799
Subject is en route.

711
01:22:13,874 --> 01:22:15,808
Roof 43, let me know
when you have visual.

712
01:22:15,876 --> 01:22:17,673
Roof 43, standing by.

713
01:22:24,385 --> 01:22:25,409
Standing by.

714
01:22:25,486 --> 01:22:28,853
Okay, folks, here we go.
Box 200 meters.

715
01:22:28,923 --> 01:22:30,254
Visual on leader.

716
01:22:30,324 --> 01:22:32,656
43 ground in position.

717
01:22:33,127 --> 01:22:35,857
As soon as you have eyes on Landy,
I wanna know.

718
01:22:50,411 --> 01:22:51,571
Okay, here we go.

719
01:22:51,645 --> 01:22:53,476
Copy that. I see her.

720
01:23:05,559 --> 01:23:07,527
Any sign of Bourne?

721
01:23:07,595 --> 01:23:08,857
Negative.

722
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:11,659
No sign of target.

723
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:24,409
Noah Vosen.

724
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:26,969
This is Jason Bourne.

725
01:23:28,282 --> 01:23:30,978
I was wondering when you
were going to make this call.

726
01:23:31,052 --> 01:23:32,610
How did you get this number?

727
01:23:32,686 --> 01:23:36,588
You didn't actually think I was
coming to Tudor City, did you?

728
01:23:38,559 --> 01:23:40,083
No, I guess not.

729
01:23:40,161 --> 01:23:42,026
But if it's me you want to talk to...

730
01:23:42,096 --> 01:23:44,564
Perhaps we can arrange a meet.

731
01:23:44,632 --> 01:23:46,395
Where are you now?

732
01:23:47,268 --> 01:23:49,327
I'm sitting in my office.

733
01:23:50,704 --> 01:23:52,194
I doubt that.

734
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,571
And why would you doubt that?

735
01:23:54,642 --> 01:23:56,041
If you were in your office right now...

736
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:59,170
We'd be having this
conversation face to face.

737
01:24:06,187 --> 01:24:07,586
Noah Vosen.

738
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,353
This is a code ten abort.

739
01:24:12,426 --> 01:24:14,894
I want everyone back in the vehicles.
This is a code ten abort.

740
01:24:14,962 --> 01:24:16,725
Let's go! Let's go!

741
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,278
Yeah?

742
01:24:40,354 --> 01:24:41,651
Wills, check my office.

743
01:24:46,393 --> 01:24:47,382
Damn it!

744
01:24:47,461 --> 01:24:49,088
What's going on?

745
01:24:52,099 --> 01:24:54,567
We need building security up here.

746
01:24:55,836 --> 01:24:57,701
He's got everything.
God damn it!

747
01:24:57,771 --> 01:24:59,864
All right, set a four-block
perimeter around the building.

748
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,237
Somebody give me a visual.

749
01:25:01,308 --> 01:25:02,707
I want the entire building searched.

750
01:25:02,776 --> 01:25:06,109
Every room, every hallway,
every closet, every goddamn air duct.

751
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,171
You understand?
I want him found!

752
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:13,081
What just happened?

753
01:25:13,154 --> 01:25:16,646
Bourne just broke into CRI.
He got into Vosen's safe.

754
01:25:18,626 --> 01:25:19,820
Where to?

755
01:25:19,894 --> 01:25:22,226
415 East 71st Street.

756
01:25:23,063 --> 01:25:26,089
Four-fifteen-seventy-one?
Jesus, Pam.

757
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:53,320
Target in sight.

758
01:25:58,098 --> 01:25:59,690
North on Eighth.

759
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,230
He's headed east in the Port Authority.

760
01:26:08,309 --> 01:26:10,277
All agents have
shoot-on-sight authorization.

761
01:26:35,035 --> 01:26:36,468
Right there!

762
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,713
Sir, he drove off the roof.
What?

763
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:22,681
He drove off the roof!

764
01:27:24,118 --> 01:27:26,245
He's on foot.
He's running.

765
01:27:36,897 --> 01:27:38,125
Police! Freeze!

766
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:39,961
Put your hands in the air!

767
01:27:49,576 --> 01:27:51,203
Call for backup!

768
01:28:15,736 --> 01:28:18,466
Sir, sir, take a look at this!
Bourne's birthday, sir.

769
01:28:18,539 --> 01:28:19,870
What about it?
Check that out.

770
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:24,309
Sir, Landy told Bourne that
his birthday was 4-15-71.

771
01:28:25,045 --> 01:28:27,013
Oh, my God. It's a code.

772
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:30,276
Everything stops.
Everything stops! Listen up!

773
01:28:30,351 --> 01:28:33,184
4-15-71.
New assignment, numbers.

774
01:28:33,253 --> 01:28:35,118
What does it mean?
Give me encryption codes!

775
01:28:35,189 --> 01:28:37,749
Sir, if you plug them in as
variables of longitude and latitude...

776
01:28:37,825 --> 01:28:39,588
You get Cameroon.

777
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:42,629
41571 is the zip code
for Varney, Kentucky.

778
01:28:45,532 --> 01:28:46,726
What date did she give him?

779
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,428
4/15/71.

780
01:28:49,503 --> 01:28:51,266
I don't believe it.

781
01:28:51,805 --> 01:28:55,468
SRD is at 415 East 71st Street.

782
01:28:55,542 --> 01:28:57,271
She just gave him the training facility.

783
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,470
Oh, Christ.

784
01:28:58,545 --> 01:29:00,979
Bring all the teams in behind us.

785
01:30:59,433 --> 01:31:01,128
Hurry up!
Somebody call 911!

786
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:02,225
Help him!

787
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:39,130
The asset lost Bourne.
We lost him.

788
01:31:47,281 --> 01:31:49,408
Hello?
Albert, it's Vosen.

789
01:31:50,651 --> 01:31:54,348
Bourne knows everything and
he's on his way to you right now.

790
01:31:54,888 --> 01:31:57,118
He's coming home, Noah.

791
01:31:57,190 --> 01:31:59,021
How long do I have?

792
01:31:59,092 --> 01:32:00,320
I don't know.

793
01:32:00,394 --> 01:32:02,726
Just get the hell out of there.

794
01:32:02,829 --> 01:32:04,797
No, I'm gonna stay.

795
01:32:04,865 --> 01:32:08,392
He'll head for the training wing.
That's what he knows.

796
01:32:08,669 --> 01:32:12,503
I'll keep him in play
till you get there.

797
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:05,715
They'll kill you for giving me this.

798
01:33:05,792 --> 01:33:08,693
4-15-71 isn't much of a code.

799
01:33:08,762 --> 01:33:11,526
My guess is Vosen is on his way already.

800
01:33:12,466 --> 01:33:14,297
Why'd you do it?

801
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:16,495
Because this isn't
what I signed up for...

802
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:18,868
What they did to you, Black briar.

803
01:33:19,306 --> 01:33:20,830
This isn't us.

804
01:33:22,843 --> 01:33:26,574
Then do something about it.
Everything you need is in there.

805
01:33:30,817 --> 01:33:32,216
Everything.

806
01:33:33,587 --> 01:33:36,852
David. Why don't you come in with me?

807
01:33:36,923 --> 01:33:38,413
It'll be better if we do this together.

808
01:33:38,492 --> 01:33:39,891
No.

809
01:33:41,795 --> 01:33:44,093
This is where it started for me.

810
01:33:44,464 --> 01:33:46,329
This is where it ends.

811
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:00,969
That's Landy.

812
01:34:07,287 --> 01:34:10,120
Mandy Aaron, dial extension 200, please.

813
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:12,784
Mandy Aaron, dial extension 200.

814
01:34:13,393 --> 01:34:14,860
All right, lock this building down.

815
01:34:14,928 --> 01:34:17,453
Set a secure perimeter of one block.

816
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:27,228
Hello. This is Pamela Landy.
I have to send a classified document.

817
01:34:27,307 --> 01:34:29,138
Get a team to SRD after Bourne.

818
01:34:29,209 --> 01:34:31,006
And put someone in every
public area of this hospital.

819
01:34:31,078 --> 01:34:34,104
Okay. Elevator shafts,
service entrances, go!

820
01:34:39,419 --> 01:34:42,047
Damn it! South bay! Go!

821
01:34:42,556 --> 01:34:44,421
Gentlemen, this is a
priority one situation!

822
01:34:44,491 --> 01:34:45,890
You will give us your full cooperation.

823
01:34:45,959 --> 01:34:48,120
Give me playback for the entire
building for the last three minutes.

824
01:34:48,195 --> 01:34:49,219
Yes, sir.

825
01:35:01,007 --> 01:35:02,440
Move! Move!

826
01:35:08,115 --> 01:35:10,208
This one, here!
Where is this?

827
01:35:10,283 --> 01:35:11,409
First floor.

828
01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:13,578
I'll take Landy on my own.

829
01:35:48,922 --> 01:35:51,618
You better get yourself a good lawyer.

830
01:36:05,505 --> 01:36:08,804
A republic lives on the knife's edge.

831
01:36:16,683 --> 01:36:20,676
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.

832
01:36:23,123 --> 01:36:25,990
You may not even remember who he was.

833
01:36:28,562 --> 01:36:31,588
You know why we're
treating you like this?

834
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,324
Hello, Jason.

835
01:36:37,537 --> 01:36:40,768
I believe you've been
having some problems.

836
01:36:40,841 --> 01:36:42,502
Put the gun down.

837
01:36:43,577 --> 01:36:46,546
I wouldn't be here if
I didn't want to talk.

838
01:36:49,783 --> 01:36:52,115
I've spent three years running.

839
01:36:52,819 --> 01:36:56,016
Three years trying to find out who I am.

840
01:36:56,089 --> 01:36:59,024
You've still not got
it all back, have you?

841
01:36:59,693 --> 01:37:02,025
Still not filled in the pieces.

842
01:37:02,095 --> 01:37:03,756
It was always you.

843
01:37:05,832 --> 01:37:07,629
I'm unarmed, Jason.

844
01:37:08,134 --> 01:37:10,728
Why me? Why did you pick me?

845
01:37:12,038 --> 01:37:14,734
Your really don't remember, do you?

846
01:37:17,043 --> 01:37:20,069
We didn't pick you.
You picked us.

847
01:37:23,183 --> 01:37:24,844
You volunteered.

848
01:37:26,753 --> 01:37:28,152
Right here.

849
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:32,715
Even after you were warned.

850
01:37:42,802 --> 01:37:44,633
Captain Webb.

851
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,001
Good morning, Captain.

852
01:37:51,544 --> 01:37:53,569
You came in here.

853
01:37:55,649 --> 01:37:58,482
You didn't even blink, Jason.

854
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:05,649
You just handed me these.

855
01:38:12,465 --> 01:38:15,025
Has everything been explained to you?

856
01:38:16,803 --> 01:38:18,134
Yes, sir.

857
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:23,038
You said you wanted to serve.

858
01:38:24,744 --> 01:38:27,770
Your missions will save American lives.

859
01:38:27,847 --> 01:38:29,712
I understand, sir.

860
01:38:32,352 --> 01:38:35,014
You said I'd be saving American lives.

861
01:38:35,522 --> 01:38:37,217
You were.

862
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:39,451
I was killing for you.

863
01:38:41,661 --> 01:38:43,094
For them.

864
01:38:43,964 --> 01:38:48,628
You knew exactly what it meant
for you if you chose to stay.

865
01:38:48,902 --> 01:38:53,134
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.

866
01:38:53,206 --> 01:38:55,436
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

867
01:38:57,344 --> 01:38:59,972
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.

868
01:39:00,613 --> 01:39:03,207
You made yourself into who you are.

869
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:07,019
Eventually you're gonna
have to face the fact...

870
01:39:07,087 --> 01:39:11,683
You chose right here
to become Jason Bourne.

871
01:39:18,198 --> 01:39:20,666
You haven't slept for a long time.

872
01:39:26,039 --> 01:39:28,132
Have you made a decision?

873
01:39:32,712 --> 01:39:34,407
This can't go on.

874
01:39:35,148 --> 01:39:36,945
You have to decide.

875
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:41,851
Who is he?

876
01:39:42,255 --> 01:39:43,984
We've been through that.

877
01:39:47,527 --> 01:39:49,119
What did he do?

878
01:39:49,696 --> 01:39:51,527
It doesn't matter.

879
01:40:05,378 --> 01:40:07,369
You came to us.

880
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:12,018
You volunteered.

881
01:40:12,852 --> 01:40:16,015
You said you'd do
anything it takes to...

882
01:40:16,689 --> 01:40:18,850
Save American lives.

883
01:40:19,492 --> 01:40:21,619
You're not a liar, are you?

884
01:40:22,662 --> 01:40:25,153
Or too weak...

885
01:40:26,032 --> 01:40:27,863
To see this through?

886
01:40:29,536 --> 01:40:31,026
This is it.

887
01:40:32,205 --> 01:40:35,003
Let go of David Webb.

888
01:40:40,713 --> 01:40:44,410
Really give yourself to this program.

889
01:41:09,709 --> 01:41:11,540
You're no longer...

890
01:41:12,545 --> 01:41:14,012
David Webb.

891
01:41:15,381 --> 01:41:19,545
From now on, you'll be
known as Jason Bourne.

892
01:41:21,287 --> 01:41:23,448
Welcome to the program.

893
01:41:36,636 --> 01:41:38,467
Do you remember now?

894
01:41:47,247 --> 01:41:48,737
I remember.

895
01:41:50,984 --> 01:41:52,884
I remember everything.

896
01:41:54,454 --> 01:41:56,615
I'm no longer Jason Bourne.

897
01:41:58,291 --> 01:42:00,555
So now you're gonna kill me.

898
01:42:01,828 --> 01:42:02,988
No.

899
01:42:04,731 --> 01:42:08,861
You don't deserve the star they'd
give you on the wall at Langley.

900
01:42:23,283 --> 01:42:25,342
He's headed for the roof!

901
01:43:10,496 --> 01:43:12,726
Why didn't you take the shot?

902
01:43:21,708 --> 01:43:24,836
Do you even know why
you're supposed to kill me?

903
01:43:34,254 --> 01:43:35,653
Look at us.

904
01:43:38,658 --> 01:43:41,024
Look at what they make you give.

905
01:44:32,178 --> 01:44:33,702
Good morning, senators.

906
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:38,774
If I may, I'd like to begin by
making a statement for the record.

907
01:44:41,554 --> 01:44:46,184
The file indicates that Ezra
Kramer authorized six illegal...

908
01:44:46,259 --> 01:44:47,317
The President convened...

909
01:44:47,393 --> 01:44:49,190
An emergency cabinet meeting today...

910
01:44:49,262 --> 01:44:50,661
To discuss the growing scandal...

911
01:44:50,730 --> 01:44:53,494
Over an alleged government
assassination program...

912
01:44:53,566 --> 01:44:55,557
Code-named Black briar.

913
01:44:55,635 --> 01:44:58,695
CIA Director Ezra Kramer is
under criminal investigation...

914
01:44:58,871 --> 01:45:00,736
For authorizing the program...

915
01:45:00,807 --> 01:45:04,743
Which in several cases may
have even targeted US citizens.

916
01:45:08,848 --> 01:45:11,544
Two agency officials have
already been arrested.

917
01:45:11,617 --> 01:45:15,383
Dr. Albert Hirsch, the alleged
mastermind of Black briar program...

918
01:45:15,455 --> 01:45:19,949
And CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen,
the program's operational chief.

919
01:45:23,429 --> 01:45:26,023
Meanwhile, mystery surrounds
the fate of David Webb...

920
01:45:26,099 --> 01:45:27,930
Also known as Jason Bourne,
the source...

921
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,764
Behind the exposure of
the Black briar program.

922
01:45:30,837 --> 01:45:34,273
It's been reported that Webb was shot
and fell from a Manhattan rooftop...

923
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:37,070
Into the East River ten stories below.

924
01:45:37,143 --> 01:45:39,111
However, after a three-day search...

925
01:45:39,178 --> 01:45:41,373
Webb's body has yet to be found.

926
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:51,340
