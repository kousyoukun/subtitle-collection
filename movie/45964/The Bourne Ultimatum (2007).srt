Good morning, Captain.

You came in here.

Yes, sir.

01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:22,842
You said you wanted to serve.

You knew exactly what it meant for you if you chose to stay.

When we are finished with you, you will no longer be David Webb.

I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

You can't outrun what you did, Jason.

984

You made yourself into who you are.

you chose right here to become Jason Bourne.

Have you made a decision?

989

This can't go on.

You volunteered.

997
01:40:12,656 --> 01:40:15,819
You said you'd do anything it takes to

998

save American lives.

You're not a liar, are you?

Or too weak

1001

1002

I'm no longer Jason Bourne.

No.
