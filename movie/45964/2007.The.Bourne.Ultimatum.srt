俄羅斯 莫斯科


2
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,740
隧道追擊的嫌疑犯正從基輔斯基火車站向東逃離


3
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,970
讓他進去
Send him in.

4
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,520
你願意負責這個計畫嗎？
Will you commit to this program?

5
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,720
我做不到
I can't.

6
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,240
把手舉起來


7
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,700
你願意負責這個計畫嗎？
Will you commit to this program?

8
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,680
把手拿出來


9
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,210
你願意負責這個計畫嗎？
Will you commit to this program?

10
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,280
我做不到
I can't.

11
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,150
別開槍


12
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,250
我沒有武器


13
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,320
把無線電給我


14
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,120
別殺我


15
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,820
我跟你並沒有恩怨


16
00:03:52,230 --> 00:04:01,320
諜 影 重 重 3 ： 最 後 通 牒

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,320
六周後

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,420
中央情報局 蘭利 維吉尼亞州


19
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,740
（愛茲拉•克雷莫 局長，CIA）對你來說沒有哪個地方是安全的
There's no place it won't catch up to you.

20
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,280
每個故事的結局都是這樣
It's how every story ends.

21
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,050
傑森...你註定是一個殺手
It's what you are, Jason, a killer.

22
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,650
永遠都是
You always will be.

23
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
開槍啊！快啊！來吧，來吧！
Go ahead. Go on. Go on! Do it! Do it!

24
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,520
她不會讓我這麼做的
She wouldn't want me to.

25
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,070
這是你活下來的唯一理由
That's the only reason you're alive.

26
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,600
“她”是指誰？
Who is "she"?

27
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,430
瑪麗•克魯茲，他的女友
Marie Kreutz, his girlfriend.

28
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,170
在印度被殺了
She was killed in India.

29
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,370
是中情局行動主管沃德•亞伯特下的命令
Director of Operations Ward Abbott arranged it.

30
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,480
也就是說，我們的一位無恥主管殺了他女朋友
So we have a dirty section chief who kills Bourne's girl.

31
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,780
伯恩回來報仇，錄下了亞伯特的供詞
Bourne comes back for revenge, tapes Abbott's confession

32
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,950
然後亞伯特自殺了
and Abbott commits suicide.

33
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,180
而現在他來找我們算帳了
Now Bourne's gunning for us.

34
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,990
這些都是事實
You couldn't make this stuff up.

35
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,390
最近發現伯恩的蹤影是在莫斯科，六個星期前
Bourne's last confirmed location was Moscow, six weeks ago.

36
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,490
是的，長官
Right. Sir.

37
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,260
他在逃亡中，很危險
He's on the run. He's dangerous.

38
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,570
長官，恕我直言，我認為可能還有其他原因
Well, sir, with respect, I think something else could be going on here.

39
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,970
是什麼？他為什麼要逃亡？
What? What's he after?

40
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,500
伯恩去莫斯科是為了找他第一個殺害目標的女兒
The reason Bourne went to Moscow was to see the daughter of his first targ

41
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,910
你的意思是什麼，帕梅？
What's your point, Pam?

42
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,500
可能他在回憶他的過去
Maybe he was retracing his steps.

43
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,350
他在尋找某樣東西，他回憶裡的某樣東西
He's looking for something. Something in his past.

44
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,580
也許他還沒找到，我們需要知道他在找什麼
Maybe he hasn't found it yet and we need to know what it is.

45
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,490
你認為他對我們沒有威脅？
Are you telling me he's not a threat to this agency?

46
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,490
我想如果他真的想害我們，大可以把錄音帶寄到CNN去
I think if he wanted to hurt us, he could have sent the tape to CNN.

47
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
也許他會這麼做的
Maybe he still will.

48
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,200
我的首要原則，就是抱著最大的希望做最壞的打算
My number one rule is hope for the best, plan for the worst.

49
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,830
對我而言，伯恩始終是個很大的威脅，除非你能證明我錯了
As far as I'm concerned, Bourne is still a serious threat u
0e:

50
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,430
繼續尋找他的蹤影
Let's keep looking.

51
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,370
是，長官 是，長官
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

52
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,570
義大利 都靈


53
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,280
這是三年前的照片，那時有一半的國際刑警都在追捕他
This one's three years ago. They had half of Interpol after him.

54
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,050
後來他曾出現在那不勒斯，柏林，莫斯科
Turned up in Naples, Berlin, Moscow...

55
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,820
然後又消失無蹤了
Disappeared again.

56
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,890
與他一起逃亡的女子
The girl that he was on the run with.

57
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,270
瑪麗•克魯茲，屍體在地球另一邊的河裡被找到
Marie Kreutz. She was found dead in a river halfway round the world.

58
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,930
頭部中槍
She'd been shot in the head.

59
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,710
這些都意味著什麼？
What connects the dots?

60
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,750
把答錄機關掉
Turn off the tape recorder.

61
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,420
法國 巴黎


62
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,240
我妹妹呢？
Where's my sister?

63
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,510
何不先坐下來？
Why don't you sit down?

64
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,480
她在哪裡？
Where is she?

65
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
她死了
She's dead.

66
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,530
是被殺的
She was killed.

67
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,070
對不起
I'm sorry.

68
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,390
我就知道會是這個結果
I knew this could end this way.

69
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,460
我早就知道會是這樣
It was always gonna end this way.

70
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,760
我並不這麼認為
I didn't believe that.

71
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,040
她是怎麼死的？
And how did she die?

72
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,770
被槍殺
She was shot.

73
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,870
當時我們在印度
We were together in India.

74
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,980
那個人的目標是我
He came for me.

75
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,810
你殺了他？
You killed him?

76
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,250
是的
Yes.

77
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,820
現在呢？
And now what?

78
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,300
這些事一定有幕後主使，我要把他找出來
Someone started all of this and I'm gonna find them.

79
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,300
希思羅國際機場，英國 倫敦


80
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,810
喂，是我
Hey. It's me.

81
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,150
是的，他什麼都知道
Yeah. He knows the whole story.

82
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,750
伯恩只不過是冰山一角
Bourne's just the tip of the iceberg.

83
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,690
你聽說過“黑荊棘”計畫嗎？
Have you heard of an Operation Blackbriar?

84
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,860
我要好好整理一下並寫成報導
I'm gonna get my head around this and type it up.

85
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,060
我現在去找你
I'll see you first thing.

86
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,290
好的
Okay.

中情局分局，英國 倫敦


88
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,280
埃施朗電子監測網發現關鍵字“黑荊棘”
Scanning. GoSat 21. I have a hit on ECHELON. Blackbriar.

89
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,840
重複一遍，是“黑荊棘”
I repeat, Blackbriar.

90
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,350
信號似乎來自歐洲
Looks like it's coming from a European signal.

91
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,150
國家安全局，請確認
NSA, please confirm your receipt.

92
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,790
（中央情報局 蘭利 維吉尼亞州）我會找到頻率和座標
I'll bring up the frequency and the coordinates

93
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,260
截獲我們首要的...
...intercept of our principal...

94
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,390
- 長官！ - 什麼情況？
- Sir! - What you got?

95
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,360
我們截獲到了在倫敦的一通電話，內容帶有關鍵字“黑荊棘”
We intercepted a call in London. Keyword, "Blackbriar."

96
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,800
好的，馬上發給紐約
Okay, send it to New York right away.

97
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,300
中情局最高機密反恐，紐約分局


98
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,780
跟蹤到電話來源了？
Track the phone?

99
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,880
登記者是一位叫賽門•羅斯的倫敦記者
Registered to a London reporter named Simon Ross.

100
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,580
為《衛報》工作
Works at the Guardian newspaper.

101
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,020
- 你正在跟蹤他嗎？ - 是的，長官！
- You're tracking him? - Sir. Yeah.

102
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,120
謝謝，麥克
Thanks, Mike.

103
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,630
我們有個調查小組正在跟蹤他
We have a survey team covering him at work

104
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,630
另外還派了一組人潛入他的公寓
and a sneak and peek's on their way to his apartment.

105
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,720
他跟誰聯繫過？他怎麼會知道“黑荊棘”計畫？
Well, who talked to him? How did he find out about Blackbriar?

106
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,330
我不知道，我們已經調查過他的背景
I don't know. We pulled his background

107
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,370
並且反復確認了所有的疑點
and ran a cross-check on any known anomalies.

108
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,460
但什麼也沒有發現，不過我認為只要跟蹤羅斯，就能...
We've come up with nothing. But I think if we follow Ross, we're
0:

109
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,270
雷，羅斯不重要，我們要的是消息來源
Ray, Ross is easy. We want the source.

110
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,420
你聽說過“黑荊棘”計畫嗎？
Have you heard of an Operation Blackbriar?

111
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,760
你有細節嗎？
You have details?

112
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,230
我要好好整理一下並寫成報導
I'm gonna get my head around this and type it up.

113
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,630
我現在去找你
I'll see you first thing.

114
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,470
- 就這些？ - 是的
- Is that all? - Yeah.

115
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,570
我要反恐拘留方案準備好，順便通知殺手待命
I want rendition protocols and put the asset on standby, just in case.

116
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,240
大家聽著，這是4級緊急事件
People, listen up! This is a full priority situation.

117
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,840
吉米，把羅斯的檔案投到1號屏上
Jimmy, give me Ross' profile on one.

118
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,510
是，長官
Yes, sir.

119
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,220
我們的目標是一位元英國記者賽門•羅斯
Our target is a British national, Simon Ross. A reporter.

120
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,020
我要監視他所有的電話記錄，黑莓短訊，公寓，車子
I want all his phones, his BlackBerry, his apartment, his car,

121
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,330
銀行帳戶，信用卡帳戶，旅行記錄
bank accounts, credit cards, travel patterns.

122
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,490
我要在他下一步行動之前，知道他的計畫
I want to know what he's gonna think before he does.

123
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,360
我要知道他的一切秘密
Every dirty little secret he has.

124
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,770
最重要的是，我要知道他線人的名字以及即時位置
And most of all, we want the name and real-time location of his source

125
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,070
這是國家安全局4級緊急事件，有什麼疑問嗎？
This is NSA priority level four. Any questions?

126
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,610
好吧，行動
All right, let's get to it.

127
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,210
賽門•羅斯 國際安全事務通訊員


128
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,700
誰是傑森•伯恩? 特別報導之三


129
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,840
德國BND正與南印度警方聯手調查一位德國女性的死亡原因。該名女性疑為伯恩同夥，在其汽車墮橋之後淹死在河裡。

130
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,140
什麼？
What?

131
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,520
你願意負責這個計畫嗎？
Will you commit to this program?

132
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,950
我做不到
I can't.

133
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,200
收到 威爾遜先生，目標正進入辦公室
Copy that. Mr. Wills, the subject is entering his office.

134
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,640
給我派幾個眼線到街上監視
Give me some eyeballs on the street.

135
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,040
我的現場視頻呢？
Where's my picture, please?

136
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,550
快連上了
Coming online.

137

吉米，電話線那裡怎麼樣？
Jimmy, how you doing with the phone line?

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920

太慢了
That's too long.

142
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,920
我們怎麼知道他是不是受人指使？
So how do we know he's not spinning for someone?

143
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,120
還有更多黑幕，他很害怕
There was more. He was scared.

145
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,770

Sorry. Call for you. ROSS: Who is it?

146
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,830
他不肯說
Won't give his name.

147
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,240
抱歉，失陪一下
Excuse me.

為什麼聽不到對話？
Why aren't we hearing this?

152
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,420
吉米，這是座機，為什麼我們監聽不到？
Jimmy? That's a hard line, Jimmy. Why don't we have it?

153
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,790
我們已經監聽了他的線路，但他不在那條線上，他在用別人的電話
We have his line, sir, but he's not on it. He's u

154
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,190

Jimmy, I need that phone! I need it yesterday.

197
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,380
他在行動，他在行動
He's on the move. He's on the move.

198
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,620
那不是他的電話，長官
That's not his phone, sir.

199
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,720
再說一遍？
Say again?

200
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,920
那不是他的電話，長官
That's not his phone, sir.

201
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,260
什麼叫不是他的電話？
What do you mean that's not his phone?

202
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,060
那部電話是從哪來的？
Where the hell did he get another phone?

203
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,190
嗯，不，你只要...

He's talking on a phone. Walk directly to him and stop.

208
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,210
吉米，我們需要通話內容

211
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,410
那個穿藍色連衣帽的傢伙是誰？
Okay, who's the guy in the blue hood?

212
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,320
他的連絡人嗎？
Is that his contact?

213
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,480
有一輛公車正在靠站，大概10秒鐘後會到達
All right, there's a bus coming. It'll be there in ten seconds.

214
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,860

When it stops, I want you to walk directly to your left.

There's an overpass. Go up the stairs. Stop at the newsstand.

你會在那裡得到進一步指示

220
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,000
發生什麼事了？
What? All right, what's going on?

221
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,470
有誰能告訴我狀況，我們失去了一切視頻監控
Somebody tell me. We lost the feed. Grab Team B.

226
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,390
藍帽子！趴下！馬上！
Blue hood! Down! Now!

227
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,860
走，我們走
Go! Let's go.

228
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,300
哦，該死的
Oh, shit.

229
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,030
這是怎麼回事？
What the hell was that?

230
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,430
長官，我們失去了與外勤1號的聯繫
Sir, we've lost all communication with Mobile One.

231
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,910
右邊！往西，發現目標後通知我們
To the right! Heading west. Let us know when you get a visual!

232
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,040
最後的所在位置是哪裡？
What was the last known position, please?

233
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,560
在通往中央廣場的人行道上，長官
On the walkway, heading towards the concourse, sir.

234
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,720
這裡是監控隊的噩夢，倫敦最忙碌的車站
It's a surveillance nightmare. It's the busiest terminal in London.

235
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,520
接入所有閉路監視系統
Give me all of CCTV's eyes.

236
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,620
正在處理中，長官
On it, sir.

237

長官，殺手已到現場
Sir, asset's on scene.

238
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,710
你的消息線人是誰？
Who's your source?

239
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,230
他叫什麼名字？ 你的線人是誰？
What's his name? What's your source's name?

240
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,660
聽著，到底發生什麼事了？ 為什麼有一群人在追捕我？
Look, what's going on? Why are these people after me?

241
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,030
因為你知道得太多了
Because you found something.

242
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,000
你與“絆腳石”行動的內部人士溝通過
You talked to someone inside Treadstone.

243
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,860
一個從一開始就參與在其中的人，那個人是誰？
Someone who was there at the beginning. Who is it?

244
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,230
你知道我不能透露
You know I can't tell you that.

245
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,640
你不知道你惹了多大的禍，如果有必要，那些人是會殺人滅口的
You have no idea what you're into here. These people
0h:y :av, t0 --> 0.:\r:

246
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,770
是因為“黑荊棘”計畫嗎？
Was it Blackbriar? Is that what this is?

247
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,140
什麼“黑荊棘”計畫？
What's Blackbriar?

248
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,650
“絆腳石”計畫的升級版，我的連絡人說一切都是從你開始的
Treadstone upgrade. My source told me it all started wi

249
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,980
他說你是這個骯髒秘密的第一人
He said that you were square one, the dirty little secret.

250
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,280
他說他知道你是誰
He said he knows who you are.

251
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,980
好吧，我們得走了
All right, we have to move.

252
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,520
保持電話聯繫
Answer your phone.

253
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,830
- 就要連上了 - 找到了？
- Coming online. - You got visual?

254
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,300
他到底在哪兒？
Where the hell is he, people?

255
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,870
聽我的指示，現在走向你的右方
Do exactly as I say. I need you to move up to your right.

256
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,210
右手邊第一個電扶梯
First escalator on the right.

257
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,420
馬上系鞋帶，系鞋帶
Tie your shoe. Tie your shoe right now. Tie your shoe.

258
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,560
等著
Wait.

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,760
等著
Wait.

260
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,240
我會從你身邊走過，我要你靠著左手邊的牆走
I'm gonna walk by you. I want you to move along the far wall

261
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,310
4，3，2，1

00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,750
起來
Stand up.

263
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,180
很好
That's it.

264
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,720
他在哪兒？
Where the hell is he?

265
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,850
我們絕對不能把他跟丟
We cannot afford to lose this guy, people.

266
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,930
很好，你現在的方向很好，保持那個方向前進
All right, that line you're on is good. Stay on that line. Stay on that line

267
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,070
天啊，那個大塊頭，我想他是他們的人
Oh, the bin man, I think he's one of them.

268
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,870
那個收垃圾的？不是的
The garbage man? Negative.

269
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,740
天啊，他在拿東西
Oh, Jesus. Jesus! He's reaching for something.

270
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,900
- 上帝，他有槍，他有槍 - 保持那個方向
- Oh, God, he's got a gun. - Stay on the line.

271
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,410
他有槍，他有槍
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.

272
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,110
保持那個方向，不要往別處走
Stay on the line you're on. Do not deviate.

273
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,350
找到他了！ 他在那兒，他在那兒
Okay, there he is! Here he goes.

274
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,440
逮捕隊A組，行動
Grab Team A. Go!

275
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,680
他還在跟某人通話
He's still talking to somebody.

276
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,450
他在接受指令，吉米，給我監聽通話內容
He's getting instructions. Jimmy, get me the conversation.

277
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,860
- 外勤2號，我要... - 快，趕快合圍
- Mobile Two, I want... - Come on, lock the box.

278
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,480
趕快合圍，跟進，逮捕隊C組
Lock the box. Move in, Grab Team C.

279
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,260
快點，羅斯，我們得走快點
Hurry, Ross. We gotta move.

280
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,960
混入人群，馬上混入人群
Okay, move through this crowd. Move through this crowd.

281
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,730
馬上隱蔽，混入人群
Get undercover right now. Move through this crowd.

282
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,130
到店裡去
Get in the store.

283
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,180
有人在跟蹤你，到店裡去
There's someone on your tail. Get in the store.

284
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,740
你要從東邊的門出來
You're gonna proceed out the east exit.

285
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,940
在你進門的右手邊
That's to your right as you come into the store.

286
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,950
進入你前方的酒店
Head into the liquor store in front of you.

287
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,500
然後從後門離開，把門鎖上
Go into the back and lock the door.

288
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,260
外勤4號失去聯繫
Mobile Four is down.

289
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,300
那傢伙有幫手，告訴我殺手什麼時候能夠行動
This guy's got help. Tell me when the asset's in the nest.

290
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,610
我需要裡面的信號
Get me a feed in there!

291
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,870
我要逮捕隊C組到裡面去，告訴我那裡發生什麼事了
I want Grab Team C in there. Tell me what's going on.

292
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,780
4號隊移動
Team Four is mobile.

293
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,350
上帝
Jesus Christ.

294
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,490
是傑森•伯恩
That's Jason Bourne.

295
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,660
他在逐一除掉我們的人，你認為他是線人嗎？
He's picking us apart. Do you think he's the source?

296
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,360
一定是他
He's gotta be.

297
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,570
守住所有出口，讓殺手行動
Block all the exits. Give the asset a green light.

298
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,640
把他們兩個都除掉
Take them both out.

299
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,820
待在那別動
Stay there.

300
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,700
我得想辦法突圍出去，你得依我的指示行動
I'm gonna get us out of here. You gotta do exactly what I say.

301
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,830
聽著，這可不是什麼報紙裡瞎編的報導
Listen to me! This isn't some story in a newspaper.

302
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,000
這可是真的，明白嗎？
This is real. You understand me?

303
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,670
好的
Okay.

304
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,450
讓所有特工撤退
Call all agents back.

305
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,020
告訴殺手伯恩的位置：商店後邊
Give Bourne's location at the back of the store to the asset.

306
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,080
是，長官
Yes, sir.

307
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,240
支開所有監控攝像頭
Kill the cameras.

308
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,350
- 伯恩 - 等一下，好像有點不對勁
- Bourne. - Wait. Something's not right.

309
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,460
我從這裡可以看到入口，如果我現在行動，應該能安全逃脫
I can see the entrance from here. If I go now, I can make 

310
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,720
伯恩
Bourne?

311
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,560
待在那裡別動
Just stay where you are.

312
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,830
我們不能等了
I don't think we should wait!

313
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,140
有人在朝這個方向走來
I think someone's coming.

314
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,260
我要拼一把
I'm going for it.

315
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,500
不，不，不
No, no, no, no, no!

316
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,070
我們這裡出了些狀況
We have a situation.

317
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,580
請進
Yeah.

318
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,380
克雷莫局長要見你
Director Kramer would like to see you.

319
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,580
我們要得到許可證...
We need to get those warrants...

320
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,950
他說是緊急事件
He said it's urgent.

321
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,950
什麼是“黑荊棘”計畫？


322
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,750
傑森•伯恩


323
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,820
馬德里 西班牙


324
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,320
警方已確認，被害者年齡35歲
What the police will tell me is that they believe the victim is 35-year-old

325
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,790
叫賽門•羅斯，是倫敦的一名著名記者
Simon Ross, a well-known journalist based here in London

326
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,620
供職于《衛報》
with the Guardian newspaper.

327
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,290
現場證據表明他是被槍殺的
It appears that he was gunned down

328
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,020
地點為滑鐵盧車站廣場
right in the middle of the Waterloo Station concourse

329
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,660
時間約為午後3時45分
around 3:45 this afternoon

330
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,430
有上百位乘客目睹了事件的發生
in full view of hundreds of commuters.

331
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,110
這些年，他揭露了許多不為人知的恐怖事件
Over the years, he's uncovered a lot of
unsavory stories about terror

332
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,440
為此，得罪了某些西方國家政府...
that have upset certain Western governments and...

333
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,660
- 嘿，你好 - 在那
- Hi, how are you? - Right over there?

334
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,930
好的
All right.

335
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,100
早上好，先生，您想點些什麼？
Good morning, sir. Can I take your order? Yes.

336
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:19,040
來個煎蛋，乳酪加胡椒粉，謝謝
I'll have the Heart-Healthy omelet with goat cheese and peppers, please.

337
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,010
- 您想要些什麼，女士？ - 咖啡，謝謝
- Anything for you, ma'am? - Just coffee, please.

338
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,240
只要咖啡？我買單哦
Are you sure? I'm buying.

339
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,410
咖啡就好
I'm good.

340
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,280
局長打來電話，他建議讓你加入行動
So, when the Director called and it was suggested that we bring you on...

341
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,320
建議？真的只是建議而已嗎？
Suggested? You sure it was just a suggestion?

342
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,490
真有意思
You know, it's funny how different things look

343
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,370
從不同角度看事情會有不同想法
depending on where you sit, right?

344
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,000
在我看來，這對你是個幫助，帕梅
I look at this as a favor for you, Pam,

345
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,340
給你個機會完成你未完成的任務
giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business.

346
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,640
什麼意思？
Meaning?

347
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,400
伯恩，他在這裡，他是個威脅
Bourne. He's here. He's a threat.

348
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,840
而我們，要的是同樣的東西
And we both want the same thing.

349
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,480
可是我們獲得的手段相去甚遠
But we both go about it in two very different ways.

350
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,080
過去的就讓它過去吧，帕梅
The past is past, Pam. All right?

351
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,520
斯德哥爾摩的事，我們太大意了
We were careless in Stockholm.

352
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,250
那麼滑鐵盧站這次，也是大意嗎？
So what was Waterloo? Just careless again?

353
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,690
有人洩密，這是非常嚴重的國家安全問題
We had a leak. A serious national security situation.

354
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,630
伯恩在我們的監視下現身，我們幾乎沒有時間考慮如何應對
Bourne showed up on our surveillance and we had very littl

355
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,000
一個記者被殺
And a reporter got killed.

356
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,000
伯恩知道我們會行動，關鍵是他來這裡做什麼？
Bourne saw us coming. The question is what was he doing there?

357
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,500
不，關鍵是你怎麼可以
No, the real question is how you managed

358
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,060
讓殺手在公共車站射擊？
to get into a firefight at a public train station.

359
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,240
你和我都知道，危急狀態下不得不做出欠周全的決定
You know as well as I do decisions made in real time are never perf

360
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,410
用不著事後諸葛亮，你這是站著說話不腰疼
Don't second-guess an operation from an armchair.

361
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,650
辦公室見
I'll see you at the office.

362
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,920
好好享用你的蛋白
Enjoy your egg whites.

363
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,410
大家注意了
People!

364
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,640
這位是潘蜜拉•蘭蒂和她的助手湯姆•克羅寧
This is Pamela Landy and her associate, Tom Cronin.

365
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,050
她將領導這次的搜尋行動
She's gonna be quarterbacking the search effort.

366
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,610
報上你們的名字和職務
Say your names. State your specs, please.

367
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,750
一會兒再報名字吧，伯恩的上一個現身地點是哪？
Well, let's do names later, okay? What's Bourne's last fixed position?

368
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,290
倫敦，12:00
London, 1200 Zulu.

369
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,380
狀況呢？他有武器或受傷嗎？
Status. What is he? Armed? Wounded?

370
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,190
他活著，還有行動力
Alive, mobile and unknown.

371
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,750
- 申請跨國追蹤了嗎？ - 是的
- Do we have an ECHELON package? - Yes.

372
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,890
為什麼還未啟動？ 我們在等待
Why isn't it on? We were waiting.

373
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,230
等待？還等什麼？ 什麼... 聽著
Waiting? For what? What... Listen,

374
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,330
你們知道自己面對的是什麼人嗎？
people, do you have any idea who you're dealing with?

375
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,570
這是傑森•伯恩
This is Jason Bourne.

376
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,130
他是你們追蹤過的最難對付的人，而你們已經落後了9小時
You are nine hours behind the toughest target you have ever 

377
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:36,610
我現在要求每個人用上所有注意力，投入百分百精神
Now, I want everyone to sit down, strap in and turn on all you've g

378
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,580
現在立即行動！
That would mean now!

379
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,080
多謝
Thank you.

380
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,590
給我一支隊伍負責籌畫
Give me a team deployment plan.

381
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,780
將羅斯的所有資料放到一號螢幕
I want everything you got on Ross on screen one.

382
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,770
長官，找到線索了
Sir, I think we have something.

383
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,820
我們截獲了羅斯在《衛報》的電郵帳號
We just hacked Ross' e-mail account at the Guardian.

384
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,480
發現昨天前往義大利都靈的來回機票
Found a round-trip ticket to Turin, Italy, yesterday.

385
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,180
08:00到達，12:05起飛
08:00 arrival, 12:05 departure.

386
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,780
我們本可以確定伯恩不是他的線人
I think we can be pretty certain that Bourne's not your source, then.

387
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,920
為什麼？
How?

388
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,520
羅斯剛下都靈飛回倫敦的飛機
Ross's call to his editor where he said he'd just met the source

389
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,620
就打電話給他的編輯，說他剛見過他的線人
took place just after his Turin flight landed.

390
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,860
- 說明他在都靈跟線人會了面 - 那麼？
- He met his source in Turin. - So?

391
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,460
什麼？ 難道伯恩和羅斯先在都靈共進早餐
What? So, what? Bourne met Ross in Turin for breakfast

392
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,840
然後又在同一天約在滑鐵盧車站會面？
and then at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo?

393
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,770
說不定他們還乘坐同一班飛機呢
Maybe they were even on the same flight.

394
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,740
看看都有什麼
Pull up everything you've got.

395
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,080
核對所有CIA內部登記的手機使用情況
Cross-check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with SCI clearance

396
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,280
追查羅斯在都靈的時間內所有打入和打出的電話
against all calls going in and out of Turin, Italy, the morning Ross was 

397
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,880
你要找的人是CIA特工，他掌握了高度機密
This guy you're after is a CIA operative with clearance above top secret.

398
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,690
他與羅斯的談話是叛國行為
He's committing treason by talking to Ross.

399
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,780
那麼他既然知道我們
Do you really think while doing that

400
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,950
可以追蹤到他的手機，還會用手機聯絡嗎？
he's gonna use a cell phone that he knows we can track?

401
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,720
未能查到任何記錄
Zero results on the cross-check.

402
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,530
那你有什麼高見？
So, you got any better ideas?

403
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,760
查詢羅斯在都靈整個期間
Yeah, look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off

404
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,490
所有關閉手機的人
the entire period Ross was in Turin.

405
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,370
如果大家都像我一樣經常打電話
I mean, if your people are on their phones as much as mine,

406
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,800
那麼關機的人數應該不多
the list should be pretty small.

407
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,070
三個人：湯姆•布魯斯特，傑克•布林以及尼爾•丹尼爾斯
Three names. Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin and Neal Daniels.

408
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,980
查詢羅斯住處所有與這三個人有關的資料
Okay, now check everything in Ross' apartment against those names.

409
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,710
找共同點
Check for common patterns.

410
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,220
找任何羅斯與人會面的線索
Look for anything that indicates who Ross met.

411
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,590
放大他的單子，放大
Pull up his socials. Pull it up.

412
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,060
看到文件了嗎？
See those documents?

413
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,680
停
Break it.

414
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,450
那是什麼？
Over here. What is that?

415
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,390
就是那裡，名字開頭字母
All right. Right there. Initials.

416
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,200
放大，放到大螢幕上
Pull that up. Bring that up on main.

417
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,700
尼爾•丹尼爾斯
Neal Daniels.

418
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,610
他不是我們在馬德里分站的頭子嗎？
He's station chief in Madrid, isn't he?

419
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,900
是的
Yeah.

420
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,680
通知大使館的安全官
All right, call the RSO at the embassy.

421
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,120
如果丹尼爾斯在那裡，收押他
Have them take Daniels into custody, if he is there.

422
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,050
安娜，派人到卡里諾特街的藏身處
Anna, get grab teams to the Calle Norte safe house.

423
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,650
讓他們全副武裝，告訴他們我們會幫忙封鎖所有入口的
Send them in heavy. Tell them we'll assist with the entry.

424
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,820
全副武裝？丹尼爾斯不是...
Heavy? Daniels isn't really that much of a...

425
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,260
我擔心的是伯恩
I'm worried about Bourne.

426
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,820
如果他不是線人
If he is not the source,

427
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,360
那麼他就是在追蹤這個線人，與我們一樣
then he is after the source, the same as we are.

428
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,670
二隊什麼時候到？
ETA, Team Two.

429
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,220
長官，3分鐘後抵達
Three minutes to destination, sir.

430
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,050
你將拯救美國人民的生命
Your mission will save American lives.

431
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,060
獻身這個計畫
Really give yourself to this program.

432
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,070
我做不到
I can't.

433
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,740
你能做到
You can.

434
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,110
長官，他們已經到達正門
Sir, they're at the front door.

435
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,500
- 5秒鐘 - 即時監控
- Five seconds. - Put it up live.

436
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,440
已經進入
We're in.

437
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,850
警報器被毀壞
The alarm's down.

438
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,980
一定是伯恩
That's gotta be Bourne.

439
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,060
- 保險箱空了 - 靠
- The safe is empty. - Shit.

440
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,930
貌似他匆忙離開的
Looks like he left in a hurry.

441
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,340
監控丹尼爾斯的護照
Track Daniels' passports.

442
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,670
行動
Stand by.

443
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,100
哈蒙德
Hammond.

444
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,530
該死的！派後援部隊！
God damn it! Get a backup team in there!

445
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,210
給我派上後衛隊，立即派上另一隊
Get me a secure line in there. Get the second team over there now!

446
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
你來這兒做什麼？
What are you doing here?

447
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,090
柏林行動之後，我就被派到這裡
I was posted here after Berlin.

448
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,930
丹尼爾斯在哪？
Where's Daniels?

449
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,840
他在哪？
Where is he?

450
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,620
喂？
Hello?

451
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,890
哪位？
Who is this?

452
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,900
我是妮可•帕森
This is Nicky Parsons.

453
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,640
她是“絆腳石”計畫的後勤
She was Treadstone. Logistics.

454
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,870
在柏林追捕伯恩時，她也在
She was with us when we hunted Bourne in Berlin.

455
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,280
妮可，我需要進行身份核對
Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge.

456
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,040
代號是麻雀
Code in, Sparrow.

457
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,340
危險回應：紅寶石


458
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,390
回應是珠穆朗瑪峰
Response, Everest.

459
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,390
正常回應：珠穆朗瑪峰


460
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:45,630
妮可，我是諾亞•沃森，你到現場多久了？
Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How long have you been on-site?

461
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,370
我剛進來
I just walked in.

462
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,170
在現場有我們兩名同伴，你看到他們了嗎？
We have two officers on-site. Are you in contact with them?

463
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,810
他們被放倒了，不省人事，不過還活著
They're down. Unconscious but alive.

464
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,780
見到尼爾•丹尼爾斯嗎？
Any sign of Neal Daniels?

465
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,910
沒有
No.

466
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,720
妮可，我是帕梅•蘭蒂
Nicky, this is Pam Landy.

467
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,530
我們有理由相信
We have reason to believe there's a connection between

468
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,890
尼爾•丹尼爾斯與傑森•伯恩有關聯
Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.

469
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,560
伯恩？你仍在找伯恩？我以為那個行動已經終結了
Bourne? You're still looking for Bourne? I thought that case was close

470
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,470
不，有人堅信他仍然是個威脅
No, some people are convinced he's still a threat.

471
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,010
我不這麼認為，不過我必須與他談談，才能知道真相
I disagree, but to find out I need to talk to him.

472
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,670
等一下，妮可
Hold on, Nicky.

473
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,510
- 你這是在幹什麼？ - 我想給他傳達一個資訊
- What the hell are you doing? - I'm trying to send him a message.

474
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,950
你認為伯恩不是威脅？ 他剛又放倒兩個我的人
You don't think Bourne is a threat? He just took out two more of my men.

475
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,610
唯一妥善解決這件事的方法
The only way this has a happy ending, Noah,

476
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,910
就是把他活捉
is if we bring him in alive.

477
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,920
他在追蹤丹尼爾斯
He is going after Daniels.

478
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,720
他想復仇，帕梅，結束這一切的唯一辦法
He wants revenge, Pam, and the only realistic way

479
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,820
就是解除威脅
to end this is to eliminate the threat.

480
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,790
後援什麼時候能到？
How long until backup?

481
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,760
妮可，請你留在原地，保護現場
Nicky, I need you to stay put and secure the premises.

482
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:51,730
後援將在一小時之後到達，明白嗎？
Backup will be arriving in approximately one hour. Do you copy?

483
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,040
收到，長官
Copy, sir.

484
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,270
我有多長時間？
How long do I have?

485
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,440
3分鐘
Three minutes.

486
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,680
我的車在外面
My car's outside.

487
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,210
我知道丹尼爾斯在哪兒
I know where Daniels is.

488
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,800
這裡是卡里諾特街334號，剛聽到搶響，有人喊叫，應該是美國人


489
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,510
快
Come on.

490
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,510
2分鐘後抵達，長官
Two minutes to destination, sir.

491
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,700
逮捕隊A組和B組...
Grab Teams A and B...

492
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,570
丹尼爾斯在哪兒？
Where was Daniels headed?

493
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,020
今早8點，他電匯了100,000美元到坦吉爾的一個銀行帳戶
At 8:00 this morning, he wired $100,000 to a bank account in Tang

494
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,650
離這裡300英里，如果加快速度 我們能趕得上早班輪船
Right, that's 300 miles away. If we hurry, we can make the morning

495
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:47,780
你的車停在哪？
Where are you parked?

496
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,120
右邊，離北街20米
To the right, 20 meters, north side of the street.

497
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:57,860
他們來了
They're coming.

498
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,030
繼續走
Keep moving.

499
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,930
兩個目標從藏身處出來
Two subjects seen exiting safe house.

500
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,010
這是怎麼回事？
What the hell is this?

501
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,850
不，不，等等
Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!

502
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,290
到底怎麼回事？
What the hell just happened?

503
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,030
目標行蹤丟失，長官
We've lost visual contact with the subjects, sir.

504
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,090
天哪
Christ!

505
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,830
下達指示，對伯恩格殺勿論，即刻生效
Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately.

506
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,310
聯繫西班牙方面
Send out a system one alert to all Spanish contacts.

507
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,510
進行全面封鎖
I want all air and ground border exits locked down.

508
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,560
怎麼回事？
What's going on?

509
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,140
丹尼爾斯手上到底有什麼？
What's Daniels got?

510
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,870
“黑荊棘”計畫又是什麼？
What's Operation Blackbriar?

511
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,680
是你自己告訴我，還是我打電話問克雷莫？
Do you want to tell me, or should I call Kramer and ask him?

512
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,520
老天哪，帕梅，這可是在行動中
For Christ's sake, Pam, we're in the middle of an operation.

513
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,890
胡說八道
Bullshit.

514
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,120
你要傑森•伯恩？
You want Jason Bourne,

515
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,550
跟我說實話
level with me.

516
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:45,440
“黑荊棘”計畫一開始是監視計畫
Operation Blackbriar started as an NEAT surveillance program.

517
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,700
那麼現在是什麼？
And what is it now?

518
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,110
現在它是作為保護傘，掩護我們所有幕後行動
It is now the umbrella program for all our black ops.

519
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,950
包括侵入，押送，試驗性審問
Full envelope intrusion, rendition, experimental interrogation

520
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,320
全部由這個辦公室發出指令
is all run out of this office.

521
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,380
我們是金字塔的頂端，帕梅
We are the sharp end of the stick now, Pam.

522
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,980
包括殺害行動？
Lethal action?

523
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,760
在必要的時候，是的
If we have to, sure.

524
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:10,500
正因如此，我們才特別，無需許可證
That's what makes us special. No more red tape.

525
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:17,130
再不用為了等華盛頓簽署命令，眼睜睜看著壞蛋從眼前逃走
No more getting the bad guys caught in our sights,then wat
0i:e :e ,ai0 --> 0 :or:so,eo0

526
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,080
拜託
Oh, come on.

527
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,370
帕梅，你大場面見過不少，你知道他們有多麼危險
You've seen the raw intel, Pam. You know how real the danger is.

528
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,980
我們需要這樣的行動
We need these programs now.

529
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,020
丹尼爾斯跟這個有什麼關係？
What's the connection to Daniels?

530
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,790
我們在南歐以及北非的所有行動都由他負責
He ran all of our operations in Southern Europe and North Africa,

531
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,290
他掌握著所有資料
so he has everything.

532
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,060
名字，日期，我們在海外的連絡人
Names, dates, ghost sites, who's cooperating with us abroad.

533
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,000
每一個行動
Every operation.

534
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,900
你想讓這些落入伯恩手中，然後流入市場嗎？
You want that stuff in Bourne's hands, out on the market to the highest bidd

535
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,630
應該不會吧
I don't think so.

536
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,200
伯恩不是為了錢，他為了某個原因要找丹尼爾斯
Bourne's not after money. He's after Daniels for a reason.

537
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,600
嗯，管他伯恩想找什麼呢
Well, what does it matter what Bourne is after?

538
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,080
相信我，只要找到丹尼爾斯，我們就能找到他
When we find Daniels, and, believe me, we'll find him,

539
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,840
如果你說得沒錯
if you're right,

540
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,420
伯恩也會在我們手上
we get Bourne, too.

541
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,980
你為什麼要回來？
Why did you come back?

542
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,590
你為什麼要找丹尼爾斯？
Why are you looking for Daniels?

543
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,260
你知道這個是誰嗎？
Do you know who that is?

544
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,230
這個是丹尼爾斯
That's Daniels.

545
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,700
我不知道另外一個是誰，他是誰？
I don't know who that is. Who is he?

546
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,640
他一開始就在場
He was there at the beginning.

547
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,780
我記得自己見過他
I remember meeting him.

548
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,850
第一天
The first day.

549
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,980
丹尼爾斯帶我去見他
Daniels brought me to him.

550
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,990
就是從那裡開始的
That's where it all started for me.

551
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,600
在我身上發生了一些事，我需要知道是什麼
Something happened to me and I need to know what it was

552
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,170
否則我永遠無法擺脫
or I'll never be free of this.

553
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,940
丹尼爾斯說，對你的訓練是試驗性質的
Daniels said the training was experimental.

554
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,680
行為修正
Behavior modification.

555
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,410
必須先讓特工瓦解，然後他們才能負責行動
They had to break down the agents before they became operational.

556
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,490
他說你是第一個
He said you were the first one.

557
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,580
你為什麼要幫我？
Why are you helping me?

558
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:06,700
當時我跟你合作得非常辛苦
It was difficult for me ... with you.

559
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,750
你真的什麼也不記得了？
You really don't remember anything.

560
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,790
不記得
No.

561
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,100
我們得走了
We have to move.

562
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,740
尼爾•丹尼爾斯護照追蹤，鎖定


563
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,020
長官，威爾遜先生 你應該看看這個
Sir? Mr. Wills? You're gonna want to look at this.

564
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,460
他在坦吉爾
He's in Tangier.

565
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,840
諾亞•沃森
Noah Vosen.

566
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,150
我們找到丹尼爾斯了
We have found Daniels.

567
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:32,560
他們查到了他在坦吉爾的一個旅館裡，用了他的護照
They've just tracked Daniels' passport to a hotel in Tangier.

568
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,530
他們藉故拖延丹尼爾斯的銀行轉帳
They're holding up a bank transfer he made to keep him in place

569
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,300
同時從卡薩布蘭卡派出了殺手
while they bring an asset up from Casablanca.

570
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:38,860
他們要幹掉他
They're gonna take him out.

571
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,170
什麼事？
Yeah.

572
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,270
潘蜜拉•蘭蒂，她說有緊急情況
It's Pam Landy. She says it's urgent.

573
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,520
告訴她我沒空
Tell her I'm unavailable.

574
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,610
是，長官
Yes, sir.

575
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,910
摩洛哥 坦吉爾


576
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,640
長官，殺手已經到達機場
Sir, asset has arrived at the airport.

577
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,330
告訴我目標位置
Give me the subject's location.

578
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,670
目標走進莫拉博斯旅館
Subject is now on foot and entering Hotel Velasquez.

579
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,800
旅館距離銀行2.2公里
Hotel is 2.2 kilometers from the bank.

580
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,840
給出旅館正面圖，平面圖，一間間找
All right, get an elevation and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe.

581
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,040
找出房間位置
Locate the room.

582
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,550
告訴殺手房間位置
Give the asset subject location

583
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,550
以及旅館到銀行的路線圖
and the route between the subject's hotel and the bank.

584
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,290
房間位置確定了嗎？
Do we have that room yet?

585
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,600
是的，長官，117號房間
Yes, sir. It's room 117.

586
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,570
掌握旅館匯流排
All right, get a hold of the hotel trunk line.

587
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,230
監控旅館117號房間.
Run all calls through here with an ISO on room 117.

588
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,120
他的位置被防火牆阻擋
His location's being blocked by the firewall.

589
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,630
不，他們已經找到丹尼爾斯了，也知道他在哪兒
No, they found Daniels. They know where he is.

590
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,530
他們派出殺手去解決他
They'll get one of the operatives to terminate him.

591
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,090
把殺手找出來
Find out who.

592
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,090
戴仕
Desh.

593
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,870
告訴他你要見他，說你要給他一部新手機
Tell him you're gonna meet him and you have a new phone for him.

594
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,100
如果你阻止了戴仕，他們也會找別人的
If you stop Desh, they'll just get someone else.

595
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,170
我們不是要阻止他，而是要跟蹤他
No, we're not gonna stop him, we're gonna follow him.

596
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,510
他會帶領我們找到丹尼爾斯
He'll take us right to Daniels.

597
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,450
長官，殺手背離了預定路線
Sir, the asset is deviating off course.

598
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,290
讓他去
Let it play.

599
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,590
殺手意外停止行動
Asset unscheduled stop.

600
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,120
長官，殺手正在向目標移動
Sir, asset is on the move en route to subject.

601
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,350
長官，有人未經授權
Sir, we have an unauthorized breach.

602
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,630
侵入我們的網路
Someone with active system knowledge penetrated our protocol.

603
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,570
在當地時間14:11向殺手發送指令
Instructions were sent to the asset at 1411 local time.

604
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,330
指令是有效的
Trace is confirmed and valid.

605
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,700
是通過妮可•帕森註冊的電腦
It came from a computer belonging to Nicky Parsons.

606
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,140
背離發生在哪個地點？
Where did the course deviation occur?

607
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,810
貝爾基路南面，過了佛郎路
South to Rue de Belgique, stationary Place de France.

608
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,040
帕森就在那
That's where Parsons is.

609
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,350
解決丹尼爾斯之後，讓殺手解決妮可
When we're finished with Daniels, send the asset after her.

610
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,410
是，長官
Yes, sir.

611
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,720
找到帕森，找到伯恩
We find Parsons, we find Bourne.

612
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,820
諾亞，你這是幹什麼？
Noah, what are you doing?

613
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,790
- 現在不是時候 - 我需要知道，到底是怎麼回事
- Not now. - I wanna know what's going on.

614
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,230
我說了現在不是時候
I said not now!

615
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,600
你依據什麼發佈這個指令？
What basis are you continuing this operation on?

616
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,500
我的依據就是妮可已經危及我們的隱蔽行動
On the basis that Nicky Parsons has compromised a covert operation.

617
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:12,760
她把我們置於不利境地
She is up to her neck in this!

618
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,500
這個行動是針對丹尼爾斯的，不是妮可
This is about Daniels, not Nicky!

619
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,770
她背叛了我們
She has betrayed us.

620
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,430
你根本不知道情況，諾亞
You don't know the circumstances, Noah.

621
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,310
天哪，她現在跟伯恩一條戰線
She's in league with Jason Bourne, for Christ's sakes!

622
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,240
你無權殺死她
You do not have the authority to kill her!

623
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:25,410
哦，我有權，你最好識點時務
Oh, yes, I do. And you had better get on board.

624
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,450
諾亞，她是我們的人
Noah, she's one of us.

625
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,490
你一旦走出這一步，將要如何收場？
You start down this path, where does it end?

626
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,090
我們獲勝的時候就是收場的時候
It ends when we've won.

627
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,440
解決丹尼爾斯之後，讓殺手幹掉他倆
When we're finished with Daniels, send the asset after them.

628
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,670
是，長官
Yes, sir.

629
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,800
- 好了，快點 - 行動
- Okay, come on. - Stand by...

630
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,700
2分鐘，長官，2分鐘
Two minutes, sir. Two minutes.

631
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:17,500
告訴銀行解除電匯凍結
Tell the bank to release the funds.

632
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,980
你好
Hello?

633
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,880
錢已經到戶


634
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,820
他正離開
He's on the move.

635
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:22,960
他已經到位
On it, sir.

636
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,190
200米
Two hundred meters.

637
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,070
快點，我應該多準備點跟蹤攝像頭
Okay, come on, I want to lay in some preliminary tracking.

638
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,510
停車
Stop!

639
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,750
發密信，就說我們死了
Code it in. We need to be dead.

640
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,430
先生，殺手證實兩個目標都已經被消滅
Sir? Asset confirms both targets are down.

641
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,530
活要見人，死要見屍
I want to be sure about this.

642
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:46,700
讓拉巴特的站長確認死亡
Ask the station chief from Rabat to confirm the deaths

643
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,510
秘密搜尋屍首
and do a sub-rosa collection of the bodies.

644
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,570
我要求這件事萬無一失
I want to tie this thing off completely.

645
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:52,710
小心監視蘭蒂
And keep an eye on Landy.

646
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:03,820
什麼事？
Yeah?

647
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:05,560
伯恩和妮可•帕森都死了
Bourne and Nicky Parsons are dead.

648
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,460
你確定嗎？
You sure about that?

649
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:10,400
拉巴特的站長正在核實
Our station chief in Rabat is confirming.

650
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,300
絕對不能讓我暴露
I can't afford to have this come back to me.

651
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,540
不用擔心，你不會有事的
Don't worry. You're protected.

652
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,600
一定記住我們派蘭蒂到你那裡的原因
Just remember why we put Landy there.

653
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,670
如果“黑荊棘”計畫洩露
If Blackbriar goes south,

654
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:26,720
我們就把責任推給她，重新開始
we'll roll it up, hang it around her neck and start over.

655
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:37,050
我能看到他們的臉
I can see their faces.

656
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:45,090
我殺過的每一個人
Everyone I ever killed.

657
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,860
只是不知道他們的名字
I just don't know their names.

658
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,520
瑪麗過去常常...
Marie used to try to

659
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,280
...幫助我回憶他們的名字
help me remember the names.

660
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,880
“任務中止”


661
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:22,780
目標：尼瓦納•瓦博斯，國籍：尼日利亞，執行人：傑森•伯恩，“絆腳石計畫”， 結果：失敗


662
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:27,000
我想為我做過的…
I've tried to apologize for...

663
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,770
做過的一切道歉
For what I've done.

664
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,070
為我現在做的事情道歉
For what I am.

665
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,310
但是我的心依然沉重
None of it makes it any better.

666
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,900
他們會繼續追殺你
They're gonna come for you again.

667
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:06,140
你必須從此逃亡
You're gonna have to run now.

668
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,020
“絆腳石”計畫，傑森•伯恩


669
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:34,320
實驗物件表現出反抗跡象


670
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,400
阿爾伯特•赫斯醫生授權…


671
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:44,990
阿爾伯特•赫斯醫生，職位：首席醫務官


672
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:52,080
對象在99年6月1日被送到紐約，東71街415號“絆腳石”特別治療部門


673
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,010
特別研究部指導訓練官，尼爾•丹尼爾斯記錄


674
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,550
我們該出發了
We should go.

675
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:01,980
事情會好起來的
It gets easier.

676
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:20,540
丹尼爾斯先生的東西都在這兒


677
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,410
所有的嗎？


678
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,460
是的


679
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:26,800
打開看看


680
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,480
中央情報局 紐約40街105號


681
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:51,900
紐約


682
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:06,480
情報站站長奧瑪巴剛打電話過來
Station chief in Rabat just called.

683
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,250
他們找到了屍體
They found a body.

684
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,320
- 伯恩？ - 戴仕
- Bourne? - Desh.

685
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,700
帕梅，你應該看看這個
Pam. You need to see this.

686
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,150
一個叫吉爾波特•皮安特的人剛入境
A passport for Gilberto de Piento just cleared immigration.

687
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:35,620
這是“絆腳石”計畫中，傑森•伯恩的化名之一
It's an early Treadstone identity registered to Jason Bourne,

688
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:38,780
他從來沒有使用過這個化名，這個化名也從來沒有出現過
but he never used it, and it never went to the grid.

689
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,410
伯恩還活著
Bourne's alive.

690
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:49,060
他們不知道嗎？
They don't know?

691
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:52,130
如果知道，他們現在就不會呆在這裡
Well, if they knew, Vosen wouldn't be in his office right now.

692
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,670
他真是冒了極大風險
It's a hell of a risk.

693
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:57,440
也許伯恩就是想讓我們知道
Maybe Bourne wants us to know.

694
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:00,880
就像上次在那不勒斯一樣，也許他在和我們聯繫
Just like Naples. Maybe he's communicating.

695
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,100
也許他在聯繫你
Maybe he's trying to communicate with you.

696
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,550
那麼我們應該回復
Then we should communicate back.

697
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,510
我想我知道伯恩在尋找什麼
I think I know what Bourne's looking for.

698
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:20,800
吉爾波特•皮安特 吉爾波特•皮安特
Gilberto de Piento. Gilberto de Piento.

699
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:23,160
你的夥伴在等你
Your party is waiting for you.

700
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:57,020
潘蜜拉•蘭蒂
Pamela Landy.

701
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:59,030
我聽說你還在找我
I hear you're still looking for me.

702
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,660
伯恩？
Bourne?

703
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:05,400
你想怎麼樣？
What do you want?

704
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:09,960
什麼事？
Yeah?

705
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,300
你最好過來，我們發現了新情況
Better get in here. We got a situation.

706
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,270
我…
I...

707
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,580
我想...謝謝你提供的錄音帶
I wanted to thank you for the tape.

708
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,940
事情已經全部解決了
It's all tied off. It's over.

709
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,250
我想我應該對你道歉
I guess I owe you an apology.

710
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,350
是官方的嗎？
Is that official?

711
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,290
不，非官方的，你知道原委的
No. Off the record. You know how it is.

712
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,350
追蹤結果？
You tracing this?

713
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:33,920
還要50秒
Fifty seconds to trace.

714
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,900
- 再見 - 等等
- Goodbye. - Wait. Wait.

715
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,170
大衛•韋伯，是你的真名
David Webb. That's your real name.

716
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:47,010
你生於1971年4月15日，在密蘇里州的涅克薩
You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa, Missouri.

717
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,800
為什麼不過來 我們好好談談？
Why don't you come in and we'll talk about it?

718
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,910
這裡面絕對有問題
Something is very wrong here.

719
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:57,550
伯恩？
Bourne?

720
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:01,060
好好休息一下，帕梅
Get some rest, Pam.

721
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,720
你看起來很疲倦
You look tired.

722
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:07,090
他在看著她
He's looking right at her.

723
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,190
大家聽好
People, listen up!

724
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,170
這是國家安全的緊急情況
This is a national security emergency.

725
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,200
我們即將受到嚴重威脅
We have an imminent threat.

726
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,930
我要出去
I'm going out there.

727
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:19,370
我現身，他就會找到我
If I show myself, he'll find me.

728
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,310
傑森•伯恩還活著，就在紐約
Jason Bourne is alive and is at large in New York City,

729
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,780
相信就在我們周圍方圓1000碼
and, we believe, within 1,000 yards of this building.

730
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:27,510
我要求馬上封閉周圍12個街區
I want an immediate 12-block lockdown of the area.

731
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:29,140
馬上通知蘭利總部
Send a flash message to Langley.

732
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,550
啟動本地後備系統
Prep for local backup assistance.

733
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:35,120
蘭蒂剛離開大樓
Landy just left the building!

734
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:36,630
竊聽她的電話
Stay with her phone.

735
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:56,670
她正在用手機收短信
She's using her cell. There's an incoming text.

736
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:57,980
- 我要短信內容 - 正在獲取，先生
- Get it. - Working on it, sir.

737
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:59,140
我們有幾個人跟蹤蘭蒂？
How many do we have on Landy?

738
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,380
6個，還有後援正在到達
Six men. More on the way.

739
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:03,680
我收到了，先生，現在就顯示到螢幕上
I've got it, sir! Coming up on the screen now.

740
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,140
都鐸城路和42街 10分鐘後，單獨見面


741
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:10,690
跟蹤蘭蒂的所有人，馬上去都鐸城路
Anybody not on Landy goes directly to Tudor City.

742
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,230
準備車輛，我們上車指揮
Get the vehicles. We're going mobile.

743
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:16,290
- 第二組，第二組 - 所有小組集合

744
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,060
178號
178th.

745
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:00,240
那是一個死胡同，他為什麼要這麼做？
There's only one way out of there. Why would he do that?

746
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:01,610
他在困住自己
He's trapping himself.

747
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,440
不是一個會面的好地點，太顯眼了
It's a bad place to meet. It's too exposed.

748
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:05,450
他選這個地方一定有他的理由
He wouldn't have chosen it if he didn't have a reason.

749
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,550
目標還在行進
Subject is en route.

750
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,560
屋頂43，看到目標通知我們
Roof 43, let me know when you have visual.

751
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,420
屋頂43，隨時待命
Roof 43, standing by.

752
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:25,160
待命
Standing by.

753
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,600
好，我們現在行動，覆蓋周圍200米
Okay, folks, here we go. Box 200 meters.

754
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:30,000
已就位
Visual on leader.

755
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,410
地面43號就位
43 ground in position.

756
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,610
你們一看到蘭蒂，馬上通知我
As soon as you have eyes on Landy, I wanna know.

757
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,320
好，她來了
Okay, here we go.

758
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:53,230
收到，我也看到她了
Copy that. I see her.

759
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:07,280
有伯恩的跡象嗎？
Any sign of Bourne?

760
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,610
沒有
Negative.

761
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,410
沒有發現目標
No sign of target.

762
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,160
諾亞•沃森
Noah Vosen.

763
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:26,720
我是傑森•伯恩
This is Jason Bourne.

764
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:30,730
我還在想你什麼時候能給我打電話
I was wondering when you were going to make this call.

765
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,360
你怎麼得到這個號碼的？
How did you get this number?

766
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,340
你不會真以為我去都鐸城路吧
You didn't actually think I was coming to Tudor City, did you?

767
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,830
我沒這麼想
No, I guess not.

768
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:41,780
但是如果你想跟我談
But if it's me you want to talk to,

769
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,310
也許我們可以安排一個會面地點
perhaps we can arrange a meet.

770
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,140
你現在在哪？
Where are you now?

771
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,080
我在我的辦公室
I'm sitting in my office.

772
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:51,940
我不信
I doubt that.

773
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:54,320
你為什麼不信？
And why would you doubt that?

774
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:55,790
如果你現在就在辦公室
If you were in your office right now,

775
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:58,920
那麼我們就是在面對面談話
we'd be having this conversation face to face.

776
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,340
諾亞•沃森
Noah Vosen.

777
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:12,100
密碼10取消行動
This is a code ten abort.

778
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,640
所有人回到車上，密碼10取消行動
I want everyone back in the vehicles. This is a code ten abort.

779
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:16,470
快走！快走！
Let's go! Let's go!

780
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:21,490
絕密：黑荊棘計畫


781
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,200
“絆腳石”計畫升級到“黑荊棘”計畫


782
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:28,790
被清除的美國公民


783
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:40,030
什麼事？
Yeah?

784
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,400
威爾森，馬上檢查我的辦公室
Wills, check my office.

785
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,130
見鬼！
Damn it!

786
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:48,840
怎麼回事？
What's going on?

787
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:54,320
讓保安到這來
We need building security up here.

788
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,450
- 他拿走了全部檔案 - 媽的！
- He's got everything. - God damn it!

789
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,610
封鎖大樓周圍4個街區
All right, set a four-block perimeter around the building.

790
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:00,990
我們要發現目標
Somebody give me a visual.

791
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,460
我要求整座大樓都被搜查
I want the entire building searched.

792
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,860
每個房間，每個走廊，每個壁櫥，每個通風道
Every room, every hallway, every closet, every goddamn air duct.

793
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,920
明白嗎？我要你們找到他！
You understand? I want him found!

794
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:12,830
發生什麼事了？
What just happened?

795
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:16,400
伯恩進入大樓，打開了沃森的保險櫃
Bourne just broke into CRI. He got into Vosen's safe.

796
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,570
去哪兒？
Where to?

797
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,980
東71街415號
415 East 71st Street.

798
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:25,840
71街415號？天啊，帕梅
Four-fifteen-seventy-one? Jesus, Pam.

799
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:53,070
發現目標
Target in sight.

800
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:59,440
目標向北轉入第8大道
North on Eighth.

801
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:07,980
目標進入港務局
He's headed east in the Port Authority.

802
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,030
授權所有特工，可以格殺勿論
All agents have shoot-on-sight authorization.

803
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,220
在那！
Right there!

804
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,460
- 先生，他開下房頂了 - 什麼？
- Sir, he drove off the roof. - What?

805
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:22,430
他開下房頂了！
He drove off the roof!

806
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,990
他下車了，現在在跑
He's on foot. He's running.

807
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:37,870
員警！不許動！
Police! Freeze!

808
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:39,710
舉起手來！
Put your hands in the air!

809
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:50,950
叫後援！
Call for backup!

810
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,220
先生，你看伯恩的生日，先生
Sir, sir, take a look at this! Bourne's birthday, sir.

811
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:19,620
- 有什麼問題？ - 請看，先生
- What about it? - Check that out.

812
01:28:19,690 --> 01:28:24,060
蘭蒂告訴伯恩他的生日是71年4月15號
Sir, Landy told Bourne that his birthday was 4l15l71.

813
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:26,760
她告訴他的是一個密碼
Oh, my God. It's a code.

814
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,030
都停下手頭的工作！聽著！
Everything stops. Everything stops! Listen up!

815
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,930
4/15/71，新的任務
4l15l71. New assignment, numbers.

816
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,870
這組數字是什麼意思？快解碼！
What does it mean? Give me encryption codes!

817
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:37,500
先生，轉換成經緯度
Sir, if you plug them in as variables of longitude and latitude

818
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:39,340
就是喀麥隆
you get Cameroon.

819
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:42,380
41571是肯塔基州瓦爾尼的郵遞區號
41571 is the zip code for Varney, Kentucky.

820
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,480
她給的是什麼數字？
What date did she give him?

821
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:49,180
4/15/71
4/15/71.


822
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,020
我真不敢相信
I don't believe it.

823
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:55,220
這組號碼表示東71街415號
SRD is at 415 East 71st Street.

824
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:57,020
她告訴了他訓練中心的地址
She just gave him the training facility.

825
01:28:57,090 --> 01:28:58,220
哦，天啊
Oh, Christ.

826
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:00,730
所有小組跟著我
Bring all the teams in behind us.

827
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:00,880
快！報警！
Hurry up! Somebody call 911!

828
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:01,970
救救他！
Help him!

829
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,880
先生，特工沒有殺掉伯恩，我們也跟丟了
The asset lost Bourne. We lost him.

830
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:49,160
阿爾伯特，我是沃森
Hello? Albert, it's Vosen.

831
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,100
伯恩知道了一切，他正在去你那兒
Bourne knows everything and he's on his way to you right now.

832
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,870
他要回家了
He's coming home, Noah.

833
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:58,770
我還有多長時間？
How long do I have?

834
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,070
我不知道
I don't know.

835
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,480
你趕快跑吧
Just get the hell out of there.

836
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,550
不，我要留下
No, I'm gonna stay.

837
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:08,140
他會來訓練中心一側，那是他以前待過的地方
He'll head for the training wing. That's what he knows.

838
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:12,250
我會穩住他，直到你趕來
I'll keep him in play till you get there.

839
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,460
你給了我這些，他們會殺了你
They'll kill you for giving me this.

840
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:08,440
4/15/71也不算密碼
4l15l71 isn't much of a code.

841
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:11,280
我猜沃森已經趕過來了
My guess is Vosen is on his way already.

842
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:14,050
你為什麼這麼做？
Why'd you do it?

843
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:16,240
因為那不是我的工作
Because this isn't what I signed up for,

844
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,620
他們對你做了這些，“黑荊棘”計畫
what they did to you, Blackbriar.

845
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:20,580
不是我們
This isn't us.

846
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:26,320
那麼你就做點什麼吧，你需要的都在裡面
Then do something about it. Everything you need is in there.

847
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:31,970
所有一切
Everything.

848
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:36,600
大衛，何不和我一起進去？
David. Why don't you come in with me?

849
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:38,160
我們一起去會更好
It'll be better if we do this together.

850
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,640
不
No.

851
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:43,840
這裡是我開始的地方
This is where it started for me.

852
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,080
也是結束的地方
This is where it ends.

853
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:00,720
是蘭蒂
That's Landy.

854
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,870
Mandy Aaron, dial extension 200, please.


855
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:12,530
Mandy Aaron, dial extension 200.


856
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:14,610
封鎖這座大樓
All right, lock this building down.

857
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:17,200
周圍1個街區警戒
Set a secure perimeter of one block.

858
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,980
你好，我是潘蜜拉•蘭蒂，我要發送機密文件
Hello. This is Pamela Landy. I have to send a classified document.

859
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,890
派一個小組去追伯恩
Get a team to SRD after Bourne.

860
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,760
其他人派到這個醫院的所有公共區域
And put someone in every public area of this hospital.

861
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:33,850
電梯間，員工電梯，快！
Okay. Elevator shafts, service entrances, go!

862
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:41,800
見鬼！南邊的電梯，快！
Damn it! South bay! Go!

863
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:44,170
先生們，這是緊急情況
Gentlemen, this is a priority one situation!

864
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:45,640
要求你們的完全合作
You will give us your full cooperation.

865
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:47,870
給我看過去3分鐘大廈的全部監視錄影
Give me playback for the entire building for the last three minutes.

866
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:48,970
是的，顯示
Yes, sir.

867
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,190
快！快！
Move! Move!

868
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,960
這個！這是哪裡？
This one, here! Where is this?

869
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:11,160
一樓
First floor.

870
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:13,330
我自己去抓蘭蒂
I'll take Landy on my own.

871
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:51,370
你最好找個好律師
You better get yourself a good lawyer.

872
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:08,550
美國處於危險的剃刀邊緣
A republic lives on the knife's edge.

873
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:20,430
我們完成後，你就不再是大衛•韋伯
When we are finished with you, you will no longer be David Webb.

874
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:25,740
你甚至記不得那個名字是誰
You may not even remember who he was.

875
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:31,340
你知道為什麼我們這麼對待你嗎？
You know why we're treating you like this?

876
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:34,070
你好，傑森
Hello, Jason.

877
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:40,520
我相信你是遇到了一些問題
I believe you've been having some problems.

878
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:42,250
把槍放下
Put the gun down.

879
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:46,300
如果我不想談的話就不會到這來了
I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to talk.

880
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:51,860
我過去三年一直在逃亡
I've spent three years running.

881
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:55,770
三年來一直想知道自己是誰
Three years trying to find out who I am.

882
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,770
你還是記不起來，對吧？
You've still not got it all back, have you?

883
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,770
破碎的記憶難以拼湊
Still not filled in the pieces.

884
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,510
一直都是你
It was always you.

885
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:07,380
我沒有武器，傑森
I'm unarmed, Jason.

886
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:10,480
為什麼是我？你為什麼要選我？
Why me? Why did you pick me?

887
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:14,480
你真的記不起來，是不是？
Your really don't remember, do you?

888
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:19,820
不是我們選擇你，而是你選擇了我們
We didn't pick you. You picked us.

889
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:24,590
你是自願的
You volunteered.

890
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:27,900
就在這裡
Right here.

891
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:32,460
即使我們已經警告了你
Even after you were warned.

892
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:44,380
韋伯上尉
Captain Webb.

893
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:45,750
早上好，上尉
Good morning, Captain.

894
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:53,320
你來到這
You came in here.

895
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,230
眼睛都沒眨，傑森
You didn't even blink, Jason.

896
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,400
你把這個遞給了我
You just handed me these.

897
01:38:10,570 --> 01:38:11,990
大衛•韋伯


898
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:14,770
所有的事情都對你解釋了嗎？
Has everything been explained to you?

899
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:17,880
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

900
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:22,790
你說你想報效國家
You said you wanted to serve.

901
01:38:24,490 --> 01:38:27,520
你的任務會拯救美國公民的生命
Your missions will save American lives.

902
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,460
我知道，先生
I understand, sir.

903
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,760
你說過我會拯救美國公民的生命
You said I'd be saving American lives.

904
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:36,970
你確實是這樣
You were.

905
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,200
我是在替你殺人
I was killing for you.

906
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:42,840
替他們殺人
For them.

907
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:48,380
你完全知道你選擇留下，意味著什麼
You knew exactly what it meant for you if you chose to stay.

908
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:52,880
我們完成後，你就不再是大衛•韋伯
When we are finished with you, you will no longer be David Webb.

909
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,190
你讓我成為誰，我就成為誰，先生
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

910
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:59,720
你不能逃避你做過的事，傑森
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.

911
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,960
你讓自己成為了後來的你
You made yourself into who you are.

912
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,770
最終你必須面對現實
Eventually you're gonna have to face the fact

913
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,430
是你在這裡選擇成為了傑森•伯恩
you chose right here to become Jason Bourne.

914
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:20,420
你很久沒有睡覺了
You haven't slept for a long time.

915
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:27,880
你決定了嗎？
Have you made a decision?

916
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,160
這樣沒法繼續
This can't go on.

917
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:36,690
你必須現在決定
You have to decide.

918
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:41,600
他是誰？
Who is he?

919
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,730
我們已經討論過了
We've been through that.

920
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,870
他做了什麼？
What did he do?

921
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,280
那並不重要
It doesn't matter.

922
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:07,120
你找到我們
You came to us.

923
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,770
你是自願的
You volunteered.

924
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,760
你說你會做任何事
You said you'd do anything it takes to

925
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,600
來拯救美國公民的生命
save American lives.

926
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,370
你不是在說謊，對不對？
You're not a liar, are you?

927
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:24,900
或者太軟弱
Or too weak

928
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:27,610
不能勝任？
to see this through?

929
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:30,780
就這樣
This is it.

930
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:34,750
忘掉大衛•韋伯
Let go of David Webb.

931
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:44,160
獻身這個計畫
Really give yourself to this program.

932
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:11,290
你不再是
You're no longer

933
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:13,760
大衛•韋伯
David Webb.

934
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:19,290
從現在起，你就是傑森•伯恩
From now on, you'll be known as Jason Bourne.

935
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,200
歡迎加入這個計畫
Welcome to the program.

936
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:38,220
你現在記起來了？
Do you remember now?

937
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,490
我記起來了
I remember.

938

958
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:04,490
其中幾起涉及到殺害美國公民
