What? What's he after?

49
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,568
The reason Bourne went to Moscow
was to see the daughter of his first target.

What's your point, Pam?

51
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,572
Maybe he was retracing his steps.

52

He's looking for something.
Something in his past.

53
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,661
Maybe he hasn't found it yet
and we need to know what it is.

54

Are you telling me
he's not a threat to this agency?

55
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,584
I think if he wanted to hurt us,
he could have sent the tape to CNN.

56

-Yes.

So, when the Director called
and it was suggested that we bring you on…

349
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,456

You sure it was just a suggestion?

352

some unfinished business.

And we both want the same thing.

356

But we both go about it
in two very different ways.

357
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,195
The past is past, Pam. All right?

358
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,656
We were careless in Stockholm.

359
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,366
So what was Waterloo? Just careless again?

360
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,828
We had a leak.
A serious national security situation.

361
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,748
Bourne showed up on our surveillance
and we had very little time to react.

Bourne saw us coming.
The question is what was he doing there?

364

Bourne met Ross in Turin for breakfast

402
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,973
and then at noon the same day Bourne calls
Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo?
