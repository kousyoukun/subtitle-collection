he´s not a threat to this agency?

-I´m trying to send him a message.

You don´t think Bourne is a threat?
He just took out two more of my men.

The onIy way
this has a happy ending, Noah,

488
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,080
is if we bring him in alive.

He is going after Daniels.

490
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,720
He wants revenge, Pam,
and the onIy realistic way

491
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,710
to end this is to eliminate the threat.
