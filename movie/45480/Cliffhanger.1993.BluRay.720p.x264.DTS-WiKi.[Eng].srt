1
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,085
Rescue 3. Jessie, do you see him yet?

2
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:22,046
Patience, my love, patience,

3
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,224
Wait a minute, I think I have him sighted.

4
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:30,127
Frank, what's the word?

5
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:33,166
The word is we got him over there

6
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,035
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center. Over.

7
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,540
This is 3, Go ahead,

8
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:45,010
Jessie, we're getting general clearance in the southeastern region of the park.

9
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:48,845
You will probably have sufficient cloud base to get into the tower...

10
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,443
but please be advised you'll still encounter strong winds and turbulence.

11
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,455
We would advise against a winch rescue. Over,

12
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,050
Wilco, Center, I'll proceed with wire cross tromp opposite tower,

13
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,492
- Three out
- Center out.

14
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:19,845
Gabe, Hal's signaling he's okay.

15
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:22,508
Gabe?

16
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:25,949
Gabe, where are you?

17
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,045
I'm just hanging out, Jess.

18
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,552
Oh, my God,

19
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:38,432
I don't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar,

20
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:42,196
Hey, be careful, or you'll embarrass old Frank.

21
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,829
It would take a heap more than that, rock-jock,

22
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:46,339
Yeah.

23
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:26,540
Gabe?

24
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:29,011
They're below the top of the tower.

25
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,041
They're on the ledge just above you.

26
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:33,143
You got another few feet.

27
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:42,325
- Glad you could join us,
- Yeah, sure, Hi, Sarah,

28
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,829
Hi, Gabe,

29
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:46,366
So, how's the knee?

30
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:48,959
I think it's out. No big deal,

31
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:52,564
I remember when you twisted it getting out of that hot tub,

32
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:56,169
I thought it was an old war wound from 'Nam,

33
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:58,211
Really? Hmm,

34
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:00,577
Rescue 3.

35
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,147
I've located a stranded climber,

36
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:06,015
Jessie, please send down a transport line,

37
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:18,431
So, tell me, how you feeling?

38
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,831
Fine, considering,

39
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:23,131
What do you say we take off...

40
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,503
and leave this clown behind, huh?

41
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,905
Don't tempt me,

42
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:36,177
Rescue 3,

43
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,514
Please be advised that Ranger Walker...

44
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,884
is making advances toward my girlfriend...

45
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:44,379
That's liable to get his ass kicked right off this mountain.

46
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,790
Be informed Gabe makes advances to me only...

47
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:49,591
or he'll be climbing down 4,000 feet and sleeping outside,

48
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,196
Baby, he lies,

49
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,266
- Is it really 4,000?
- Yeah, just about,

50
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:32,830
Hey, remember, whatever this guy says about me, don't believe it, okay?

51
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:34,135
Thanks,

52
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,252
Okay. Come on over,

53
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:56,194
I know you're nervous, but we've done this a hundred times, okay?

54
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:57,821
Mm-hmm,

55
00:07:01,535 --> 00:07:04,231
Excuse me, Captain Hot Tub?

56
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:08,398
Keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times,

57
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:12,543
That's great, Hal,

58
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:16,140
That really inspires contidence,

59
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:26,256
So, how did this clown talk you into climbing up to the tower?

60
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:28,761
He told me it was better than sex,

61
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,286
Really?

62
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,226
You ready for the best ride in the park?

63
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:38,294
Give me a second, I'll let you know,

64
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:52,242
You look like hell,

65
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,547
He made it,

66
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:55,584
Of course he did,

67
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,882
Really, there's nothing to it,

68
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,585
Okay, I can do this.

69
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,226
Sure you can,

70
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:03,490
I'm sorry tor all the trouble, really,

71
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:06,124
- Oh, Sarah, don't worry about it,
- Thanks,

72
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,997
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

73
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:14,170
- We're still on for dinner tonight?
- Of course we are.

74
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,606
Okay,

75
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:18,902
Okay, You're ready now,

76
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:20,173
That's it,

77
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,850
Now, just sit right down into it,

78
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:30,123
Come on, guys, The wind's picking up,

79
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,089
Sarah, just keep your eyes on me.

80
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,526
No, don't look... Sarah,

81
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:38,231
Sarah, look at me, That's it.

82
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,325
- Right,
- Just start to pull.

83
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:43,302
One hand after another.

84
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:46,864
You're doing great... really, great. Keep going,

85
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:50,776
And just keep looking at me,

86
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:53,312
That's great! You're starting to look like a pro,

87
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,143
Keep going,

88
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,080
That's it. Nice and easy,

89
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,314
Hey, Hal, we're gonna be out ot a job soon,

90
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:01,979
A little more, Sarah,

91
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:03,489
That's it,

92
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,487
One, two,

93
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,164
Oh, God!

94
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,065
Gabe! Gabe!

95
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:17,103
No!

96
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:18,570
Hold on!

97
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:22,799
- I'm going to fall!
- No, you're not!

98
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,741
You're going to be okay!

99
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:29,181
- Can you reach the main line?
- No, I can't! I'm slipping!

100
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:32,481
- Gabe, can you keep the line steady?
- That clip's not gonna hold!

101
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,488
I can't hold on! Help me, please!

102
00:09:35,556 --> 00:09:38,252
- Gabe, you have to go after her.
- No!

103
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:41,226
- Gabe, no!
- I'm coming out to get you!

104
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:45,095
It's not rigged for two, Keep it trom swinging, I'll send out my harness,

105
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:47,133
No time! I'm going tor her!

106
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:50,170
Gabe, shit! No!

107
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:51,966
Sarah, I'm coming tor you!

108
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,007
I can't hold on! I'm slipping!

109
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,839
Hold on just a little bit longer! I'm coming for you!

110
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,107
Gabe, please hurry! I can't hold on!

111
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,478
Don't look down, Keep looking at me,

112
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:05,416
- That's it, Hold it,
- I'm trying!

113
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:09,217
It's breaking. She's losing it.

114
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:13,352
Sarah! He'll have you in a second, baby!

115
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:15,952
Come on, baby! Don't you give up!

116
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:20,163
Hurry, Gabe, You're almost there,

117
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,498
- Keep going.
- I'm here, Sarah,

118
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:24,333
Sarah, I'm here,

119
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:27,239
I don't want to die!

120
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:30,538
Reach up and grab him! Reach up!

121
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:33,205
- Sarah, reach up!
- Come on, honey!

122
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,180
- Use your other hand!
- Reach up!

123
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:43,513
Hold on! Hold on! I got you! I got you,

124
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,525
I can't hold on! I'm going to die!

125
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:49,027
You're not going to die,

126
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:52,525
Don't you lose her, Gabe,

127
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,328
I got her, Reach up.

128
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:56,893
I'm slipping. I'm slipping!

129
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:01,203
- You can do it, Sarah,
- Hold her, Gabe!

130
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,072
Please don't let me fall,

131
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,271
Please, I don't want to die,

132
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,279
- You're not gonna die,
- I'm slipping!

133
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:09,441
Sarah, I got you! Just reach up!

134
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,609
I can't, Gabe!

135
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:14,184
You can do it, Please, baby, just reach up!

136
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:17,087
Hal! Hal! I'm slipping!

137
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:19,284
Gabe, man, don't you lose her!

138
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,919
- Don't you let her go!
- Don't let me fall,

139
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:26,194
I'm slipping!

140
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,824
Sarah, please,

141
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,835
No, I'm slipping! Gabe!

142
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:31,871
Gabe, don't let me fall!

143
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:35,204
- No!
- Help me! I'm falling! Gabe!

144
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:48,481
No! Sarah, no!

145
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:01,096
Jesus Christ.

146
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,983
Treasury Agent Mac Lamoore, please contact D.A.U.

147
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,031
Lock 'em up.

148
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:42,374
Travers, we'll be fueled up and ready to go in ten minutes,

149
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,603
Very good.

150
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:52,474
Mr. Travers,

151
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:56,617
- Hey, Rich,
- Morning, Walt,

152
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:58,882
This is Agent Matheson, F, B, I,

153
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,017
Travers,

154
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:03,290
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver oftice to Frisco.

155
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:07,424
As a protessional courtesy I was asked if he could hitch a ride,

156
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:10,061
Got plenty ot room, Be glad to accommodate you,

157
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,105
- Appreciate it.
- You're the boss,

158
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:14,868
Let's go, Matheson, have you been totally brieted?

159
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:18,173
- I don't know about totally,
- Who the hell ever is?

160
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:21,043
It's the most protected shipment we've got and the most useless,

161
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:23,106
These bills aren't even in circulation,

162
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:26,277
$1,000 bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange,

163
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:28,116
You always transport through the air?

164
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:30,884
Mostly, Armored cars can be hijacked, trains derailed...

165
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,085
but nobody can touch us in tlight,

166
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:35,890
Haven't lost a bill in 12 years, Don't jinx me now,

167
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:39,922
Treasury agents are the most superstitious people in the government.

168
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,468
We should be, Everybody wants what we have,

169
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:03,079
Gabe! Hey, man, Gabe!

170
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:05,318
- It's Gabe, He's back!
- I can see that,

171
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:08,952
Come on, man, Let's go!

172
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,249
How you doing, Gabe?

173
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:33,343
Dude, turn that down,

174
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,048
You guys, How you doing, Brett, Evan?

175
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:39,115
Where you been? You fall ott the planet or something?

176
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:42,458
- No, I've been working up in Denver.
- Work?

177
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:44,054
Don't say that word,

178
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:46,861
I hate work, even when somebody else is doing it.

179
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:51,459
Gabe, we're flying off the tower today, You should come with us,

180
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:54,200
Today's going to be the day for a killer jump,

181
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:58,567
- No, thanks, Can't,
- Come on, man,

182
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:02,145
Don't tell me that job in Denver made you scared ot heights?

183
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:09,447
You guys better watch out 'cause some bad weather's coming in, okay?

184
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:11,923
We like it extreme,

185
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,323
Hey, man, see you later, Gabe. Good to have you back,

186
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:18,421
Yeah, good to see you, Later,

187
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:20,090
Peace,

188
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,951
How you doing, Jess?

189
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:46,381
Hello, Gabriel,

190
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:51,330
Got yourself a new horse?

191
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,367
- Where have you been?
- Just working,

192
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:01,533
After the funeral, I just had to leave,

193
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:03,838
Had to leave?

194
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:07,345
Believe me, a lot of us wanted to leave,

195
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:08,904
But you know what?

196
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:10,916
We stayed.

197
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,310
Jess..

198
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,617
a lot ot things fell apart on that ledge,

199
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:20,258
I know,

200
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:23,262
But I don't think you know how much,

201
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:26,094
Why can't you just believe you did everything you could?

202
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,760
Did I? I don't know,

203
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:30,963
Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.

204
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:35,300
Maybe I panicked, I don't know,

205
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:37,435
I was there, remember?

206
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:39,911
You were the only one who didn't panic,

207
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,507
Why don't you do us a tavor and quit hording all the guilt?

208
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,519
You held on as long as you could, And what about Hal?

209
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:51,421
What was Hal doing on the tower with a girl who could barely climb?

210
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:54,324
I can't blame Hal tor anything, It was me,

211
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:57,086
All me,

212
00:16:57,164 --> 00:16:59,598
Well, give it up, Gabe...

213
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,267
because let me tell you something-- it doesn't get any better,

214
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:05,031
It doesn't get any better?

215
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,207
I really don't think you understand,

216
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:13,610
- What?
- I don't think you understand,

217
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,610
I don't understand?

218
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,984
I think I'm the only one that understands.

219
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:25,252
Believe me, there were times when I didn't know what I wanted to do more--

220
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:28,021
hate you or love you,

221
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:32,188
But one thing I did know and I still do know,.,

222
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:34,460
is I understand you,

223
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:50,011
Did you come back to stay?

224
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,783
You didn't,

225
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,291
I can't,

226
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:05,831
I can't. Not here.

227
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:10,128
Jessie, I came back tor you,

228
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:13,934
And it you like, I want you to come with me,

229
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,345
You come back atter being gone for almost a year and expect me to leave?

230
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:26,749
This is our home.

231
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:29,918
Now it's my home,

232
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,790
And I can't just pick up and go for all the wrong reasons,

233
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:46,503
If you don't mind, I'd better pick up the rest of my stuft,

234
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:49,303
You know where everything is,

235
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:51,503
I'm late for work,

236
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,350
Hey, big boy.

237
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:21,798
Roger, Five-Lima, scattered, broken clouds..,

238
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,070
20,000 feet with a severe storm advisory.

239
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:26,237
Check the storm scope,

240
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,435
Travers says you're being transterred,

241
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,494
Oh, yeah, Moving up in the world,

242
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:10,454
The forecast-- cloudy skies with flurries today.

243
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:13,890
We can expect an inch of snow and a high in the low 30s.

244
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,896
Overnight flurries will increase with a total accumulation of three inches.

245
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:19,829
Tonight's low near 15.

246
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,561
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time tor another masterpiece.

247
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:24,201
Hiya, Jess,

248
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,797
Oh, I think old Frank nailed it with that stroke,

249
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:29,535
What do you think?

250
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,839
I don't know.

251
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:33,902
What do you see?

252
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,242
Surprise me,

253
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,841
What usually eats a banana?

254
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,509
A monkey,

255
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:42,248
This is a picture ot a banana eating a monkey,

256
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:44,916
- Nature in reverse.
- Where?

257
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,490
Right here,

258
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:53,125
Frank, you look like a normal guy, but he's not,,.

259
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:54,928
are you, Frankie?

260
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,628
Hey, I'm an artist,

261
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,908
We're being tracked,

262
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:14,112
- Jetstar, three o'clock,
- Travers!

263
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:17,281
Stay put, Don't anyone jump to conclusions,

264
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:25,291
- He's coming in too slow.
- No, we're going too tast,

265
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:28,459
We're too high, Give me 180 knots, drop to 25,000 feet,

266
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:30,400
You got it.

267
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,304
Christ, We're losing altitude and slowing down, Get your weapons,

268
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:37,207
What the hell are you doing? I have jurisdiction on this jet,

269
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:42,042
Now I have jurisdiction. I said get your weapons!

270
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:44,983
These are highly trained agents, Mr, Matheson,

271
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:49,010
I think you're overreacting, Just calm down and give me the gun,

272
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:51,887
- You're out ot control,
- What the hell are you waiting for?

273
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,188
He's hijacking the shipment.

274
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,339
What the tuck was that?

275
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:31,326
- Move into position,
- Look alive, Kristel.

276
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,831
Crossover transfer, ten seconds and counting,

277
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,800
November 1-2-niner-five Lima...

278
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:38,167
this is Jetstar 6-8-0 Tango-Tango.

279
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:40,934
Is frequency secure? Over.

280
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:43,805
Roger, Tango-Tango, This is Five-Lima, Go ahead.

281
00:22:43,877 --> 00:22:47,813
We have visual contact. What is your heading, speed and level? Over.

282
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:51,180
We're heading 0-8-0 and doing 2-5-0 knots level,..

283
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:53,617
at flight level 2-1-0-niner.

284
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:55,616
Five-Lima, we're opening up.

285
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:57,846
Rise and shine, gentlemen. Let's make history.

286
00:22:57,924 --> 00:23:00,358
Roger, Five-Lima. We'll begin closing.

287
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,451
Bring your speed back to 1-5-0,

288
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:07,364
Commence descent to flight level 1-4-0 and turn right onto 2-6-0, Over.

289
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:13,371
We're level, Flight level 1-4-0 and steady, 2-6-0 degrees,

290
00:23:13,406 --> 00:23:15,374
The weather ahead looks a bit threatening.

291
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:17,399
Roger,

292
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:20,173
- Travers, report your position.
- Ready to disengage tail cone,

293
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:21,907
Stand by,

294
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:31,223
- Tail cone's clear.
- Roger.

295
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:49,233
Phase one complete,

296
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,210
Tango-Tango, prepare to receive cable,

297
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:55,373
Tango-Tango standing by.

298
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:57,383
Tango-Tango, what's the turbulence back there?

299
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:01,910
She's all over the place. This thing's got the response of a 7 47 at this speed,

300
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:05,584
Sounds like fun. We're streaming the drogue down. We'll see you in a minute.

301
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:08,293
Welcoming party's ready, Good luck.

302
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:11,991
We're moving in to pick up the drogue now. Tango-Tango out,

303
00:24:18,404 --> 00:24:20,167
I've got it, Stand by, Kristel.

304
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,174
Standing by.

305
00:24:24,244 --> 00:24:26,405
We're locked on,

306
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:28,538
Into the transfer position,

307
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:29,941
Check,

308
00:24:30,016 --> 00:24:32,348
Moving into transfer position,

309
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:35,046
We're closing to 2-4-0 feet,

310
00:24:35,088 --> 00:24:38,990
We're closing. We'll report when in position,

311
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:44,963
- We're too close to the storm.
- Don't lose your nerve,

312
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:48,000
All they'll tind is a plane that went down in the storm.

313
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:51,059
- Hurry up, Travers.
- On my way,

314
00:24:51,137 --> 00:24:53,332
The cases are hooked up and ready.

315
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:59,207
Charge goes off in five minutes, Stick to the plan and you're rich.

316
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,474
Got it.

317
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:04,209
Tango-Tango in position.

318
00:25:04,284 --> 00:25:06,479
- What's taking so long?
- Patience.

319
00:25:09,522 --> 00:25:12,286
Tango-Tango, dip the plane, I'm coming over,

320
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:15,192
Wilco, Five-Lima. Tango-Tango standing by..,

321
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:17,855
at flight level 1-4-0 and steady 2-6-0 degrees.

322
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:23,094
Five-Lima, I'm out ot here.

323
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:24,501
Roger.

324
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:30,935
What the hell is he doing?

325
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:34,878
Five-Lima, where are the cases?

326
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:45,382
- Kristel, we've got him.
- Roger.

327
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,858
Why didn't you send the money first?

328
00:25:47,927 --> 00:25:51,886
Somehow, I didn't think you'd wait tor me if I sent it first.

329
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:15,917
We're approaching the storm tast, I can't hold this course much longer,

330
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:18,981
- 9-0 seconds,
- What's keeping him?

331
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,186
Let's move your ass up there,

332
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,055
I'm at the cases, Stand by,

333
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:28,100
Tango-Tango standing by.

334
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:29,465
You fuck,

335
00:26:37,477 --> 00:26:39,138
We've lost the pilot.

336
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:41,146
- Who did you leave up there?
- No one.

337
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:50,411
Get underneath the jet, The cases will slide over,

338
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:57,087
Who the fuck is our guest?

339
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:10,205
Just get those cases,

340
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:12,267
He's hurt bad, What should we do with him?

341
00:27:12,345 --> 00:27:15,371
Get him to a hospital, fast,

342
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:22,921
- We're not leveling out,
- 2-0 seconds,

343
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:24,923
I've lost hydraulics!

344
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,907
The cable's blown free,

345
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,341
Don't unhook it, The cases are still there,

346
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:47,869
- Don't lose the money, goddamn it!
- Hold it,

347
00:27:47,914 --> 00:27:50,280
- Pull the cable!
- We gotta pull !

348
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:52,340
- Bypass switch one,
- Check.

349
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:54,477
- Bypass switch two,
- Keep pulling.

350
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:56,579
- Nothing,
- Switch to manual.

351
00:27:56,823 --> 00:27:58,586
Hold the fuckin ' plane steady!

352
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:02,249
- Pull ! Come on!
- Travers, don't fuck it up!

353
00:28:02,295 --> 00:28:04,559
- How's number one engine?
- Oil pressure falling.

354
00:28:04,797 --> 00:28:08,130
- Come on, Don't lose the money,
- They're coming,

355
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,998
Goddamn it! Shit!

356
00:28:11,604 --> 00:28:14,334
- We've lost it,
- Oh, fuck!

357
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:17,565
Release the cable,

358
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:22,344
Close it up,

359
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:28,854
So this is your idea of a foolproof plan?

360
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:32,186
You stupid bastard. Kristel, what's the report?

361
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:35,250
The hydraulics aren't functioning, He shot them out,

362
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:36,920
Fire warning, line four,

363
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:39,191
I'm losing altitude, We're gonna go down !

364
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:42,132
Dump the fuel, You'll have to pick your way through the peaks.

365
00:28:42,168 --> 00:28:44,068
Close the fuel valve and pumps!

366
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:49,831
Don't bother to buckle up. You may not want to survive this,

367
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:52,436
Flaps to 25 degrees before we lose all power,

368
00:28:52,512 --> 00:28:54,503
Flaps, 25 degrees,

369
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,447
Reduce power 60%, Shut down all generators,

370
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,253
Lower flaps, You may have to hand-crank them down.

371
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:15,432
- You want the gear down? 
- Leave the gear up, Shut down all power,

372
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:19,028
Give me a hand with the controls.

373
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:05,851
Wow! Did you catch that thunder?

374
00:30:05,918 --> 00:30:08,386
That was too loud tor thunder, Let's rock and roll,

375
00:30:08,454 --> 00:30:11,981
One, two, three!

376
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:17,419
- I'm free!
- Radical, man,

377
00:30:17,496 --> 00:30:20,465
Man, look at me, Watch this.

378
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,475
Mike?

379
00:30:37,016 --> 00:30:38,506
Shit,

380
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:47,216
You thought ot everything, didn't you?

381
00:30:47,293 --> 00:30:49,227
Everything except what's happening now,

382
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:53,555
Kill the pig! Your fucking plan almost killed us!

383
00:30:54,634 --> 00:30:58,900
Kill the pig, my ass, We're partners in this,

384
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:00,029
Were,

385
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,101
Give me the tracking monitor,

386
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:05,541
What the hell are you gonna do with it?

387
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:07,238
Don't make him ask twice,

388
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:09,975
Give it to him,

389
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:13,280
You want it? Take it,

390
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:15,912
It's only got 50,000 code variations,

391
00:31:15,988 --> 00:31:18,149
I'll break your fucking neck in a minute!

392
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,249
- Go ahead, Break my fucking neck!
- Sit down,

393
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:23,954
In case you slept through the landing...

394
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,931
you'll need all the money you can find to buy your way out of this country,

395
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:29,126
You know it, and I know it,

396
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:32,170
How do we get off the mountain, even if we find it?

397
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,939
Kristel,

398
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:42,012
I think we found a frequency,

399
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:45,541
Somebody help, please.

400
00:31:45,618 --> 00:31:48,280
Is there somebody there? Somebody please help.

401
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:51,221
Rocky Mountain Rescue, Come in,

402
00:31:52,892 --> 00:31:54,382
Oh, thank God!

403
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,920
Ah, we're stranded. We were hiking and lost our bearings,

404
00:31:58,998 --> 00:32:01,193
We didn't expect the weather to come in this fast,

405
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:05,829
Just take it easy. How many people in your party? Over,

406
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:10,872
Five people, I don't know where we are,

407
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:16,574
I--I see only a cylinder-type rock formation, Over.

408
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:18,344
It's got to be Comb Bluff,

409
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:21,909
Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Try to stay calm.

410
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:24,012
We're on our way. You're gonna be all right.

411
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,389
Please hurry, Billy's going into shock,

412
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,519
Please, we need insulin.

413
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:32,120
Please, hurry,

414
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,901
"We need insulin,''

415
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:41,836
Would you have thought ot that?

416
00:32:54,353 --> 00:32:56,287
- Thank God you didn't leave,
- Why?

417
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:59,017
Emergency call. Five climbers are stranded ott Comb Bluff,

418
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:02,219
The weather's pouring in, and Hal's gone up alone,

419
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:04,819
- Hal's a good climber,
- What?

420
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:06,923
What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:09,467
It means he can handle it himselt,

422
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:14,839
If he gets socked in by the weather, they'll never make it down,

423
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:17,876
Gabe, he needs someone who has emergency medical training...

424
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:19,911
and knows every handle to those peaks.

425
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:23,471
I'm the last one he wants help from, and that's not what I came back here for,

426
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:26,279
Our problems are not the issue right now, Those people are

427
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:29,185
What if he can't do it alone?

428
00:33:29,255 --> 00:33:32,224
Look, Jessie, I haven't climbed in months,

429
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:34,122
You just lose the feel,

430
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:36,991
Maybe you mean the nerve,

431
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:45,504
I didn't mean that,

432
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:50,308
It's okay,

433
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:53,573
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore...

434
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:56,805
but I'm talking about somebody that was your best friend,

435
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:58,816
Please, Gabe, he took the west ridge,

436
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:01,910
If you take the north face, you can beat him,

437
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:06,415
What has happened to you? Don't you feel anything anymore?

438
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:10,451
Feel anything? Jessie, I came back for you,

439
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:12,497
I'm not talking about me,

440
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:14,499
I'm talking about you.

441
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:19,163
Go ahead-- leave,

442
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:22,799
But if you don't do it, you'll be stuck on that ledge for the rest of your life,

443
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:50,402
Where the hell is that goddamn plane?

444
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:53,063
Looks like she went down in the storm,

445
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:56,869
That storm front is still building, so even it we could send a search plane...

446
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:59,843
it would be impossible to see anything on the ground.

447
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:03,575
- What about roads?
- There aren't any roads up there,

448
00:35:03,616 --> 00:35:05,584
Mr, Wright,

449
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:08,178
These two F.B.l. agents insist on seeing you,

450
00:35:08,254 --> 00:35:10,950
I'm Agent Hayes, This is Agent Michaels,

451
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:14,288
It you're concerned about your agent who got a ride, I've nothing to tell you,

452
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:19,392
Matheson wasn't along for the ride. He was working surveillance,

453
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,490
Surveillance? Of what?

454
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:24,934
The Bureau have been getting reports Treasury jets were being monitored...

455
00:35:25,004 --> 00:35:26,801
between Denver and San Francisco,

456
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:29,841
We didn't tell you because we thought it might be an inside job,

457
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:33,174
That's impossible, You're suggesting a hijacking?

458
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:36,772
No. Not only did I have my best men on that flight...

459
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:39,215
but each one of those cases were monitored,

460
00:35:39,251 --> 00:35:42,243
And the money is in unexchangeable denominations,

461
00:35:42,288 --> 00:35:45,280
It would be useless for anybody to try to steal it,

462
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:47,120
Except for this man,

463
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:49,524
- Who the hell is this?
- Name is Eric Qualen,

464
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:52,462
We've been tracking him without much success,

465
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:54,499
He's a former member ot military intelligence...

466
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:57,127
who found it more profitable going to the other side,

467
00:35:57,169 --> 00:36:00,570
Industrial espionage, Hijacking diamonds trom South Africa,

468
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:03,604
Theft and disposal of millions in negotiable bearer bonds,

469
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:08,245
You name it, He has the international connections to move this currency...

470
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:12,444
and $200 million offers one hell ot a temptation to this psychotic,

471
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,918
Jesus Christ,

472
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:44,843
What the hell are you doing up here, man?

473
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:47,283
I was talking to Jessie, She filled me in,

474
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:49,082
Did she?

475
00:36:49,154 --> 00:36:51,213
Well, now let me fill you in,

476
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:56,785
You can take your ass down and go back to that hole you've been hiding in,

477
00:36:58,163 --> 00:37:01,189
Once we get these people down, I'm gone, Hal,

478
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:04,030
No, You're out ot here now,

479
00:37:06,338 --> 00:37:10,001
Why the hell did you come up here? To prove something?

480
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:12,441
Look, I know how you feel about me, all right,

481
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:14,411
You don't know anything!

482
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:19,110
You did it your way and she died,

483
00:37:28,394 --> 00:37:31,261
- I did what I thought was right,
- Well, you were wrong.

484
00:37:31,296 --> 00:37:33,787
It was your weight on the line that did it.

485
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:36,334
There wasn't time for anything else,

486
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:38,302
Well, I guess we'll never know.

487
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:40,362
It was a bad time tor everybody,

488
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:43,135
What the hell do you know about bad times, man?

489
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:46,576
You didn't love her, and you didn't have to explain to her family,

490
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:49,838
And you didn't have to look into her eyes when she was falling!

491
00:37:49,882 --> 00:37:52,544
- Now drop it!
- No, buddy!

492
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,948
It was you who dropped it,

493
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:09,300
You want to do it?

494
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,995
Do it,

495
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,176
You live with it,

496
00:38:49,408 --> 00:38:51,535
They're here.

497
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:53,768
Right on time.

498
00:38:53,846 --> 00:38:56,474
How many of them are there?

499
00:38:56,548 --> 00:39:00,507
We got two heroes. We'll greet 'em at the top.

500
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:11,096
- Where's the helicopter?
- What the hell's going on?

501
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:18,535
- Where's the helicopter?
- It can't tly in this weather.

502
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:21,732
- Is either of you a chopper pilot?
- No,

503
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:24,037
What are your names?

504
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:26,100
Tucker and Walker,

505
00:39:26,178 --> 00:39:28,043
We're missing three bags,

506
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:29,774
What's in them?

507
00:39:29,848 --> 00:39:31,179
None ot your fucking business!

508
00:39:31,216 --> 00:39:36,153
Suits, socks, $100 million, the usual stuff.

509
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:39,122
Travers here was smart enough to bring along a tracking device

510
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:41,386
Don't use my name, goddamn it,

511
00:39:50,502 --> 00:39:51,901
Key it.

512
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:57,337
Look at the map, This is where we've lost our belongings.

513
00:39:57,409 --> 00:40:00,207
The red dots on the monitor are the three cases,

514
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:02,941
You recognize these locations?

515
00:40:06,118 --> 00:40:07,813
Let me jar your memory.

516
00:40:07,886 --> 00:40:10,013
It you don't recognize them, you're useless,

517
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:13,023
Useless items are usually discarded,

518
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:16,151
- Right, Travers?
- Get off my back, Qualen,

519
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:18,562
Off?

520
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:22,096
I haven't even got on it yet,

521
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:26,866
Once again, do you recognize these locations?

522
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:34,306
Ryan,

523
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:44,080
Yeah, We do.

524
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:45,919
Then let's go,

525
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:53,262
Wait a minute, asshole!

526
00:40:57,035 --> 00:40:58,161
Where is it?

527
00:41:04,343 --> 00:41:06,004
Up there,

528
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,014
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center. Hal? Come in, Hal.

529
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:14,951
Nice, You're Hal?

530
00:41:16,855 --> 00:41:18,880
You, stay, You!

531
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:23,158
Fetch,

532
00:41:30,502 --> 00:41:32,993
Fetch!

533
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:34,561
Do it,

534
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:42,877
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.

535
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:45,109
Do you copy?

536
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:48,914
Hal, come in, Hal, come in, Over,

537
00:41:58,363 --> 00:42:02,026
Watch yourself under the overhang. It could deliver anytime.

538
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,627
Anytime you feel like saying something, don't,

539
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:08,032
We're waiting, gentlemen,

540
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:10,200
- I need my bolt gun and ice ax,
- No,

541
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:13,302
- Don't give him anything.
- Take his coat tor insurance,

542
00:42:14,313 --> 00:42:16,543
He could freeze to death !

543
00:42:16,615 --> 00:42:19,175
You've got your own problems, Hal.

544
00:42:22,421 --> 00:42:27,222
Ryan, get a rope, I want this dog on a leash too.

545
00:42:30,095 --> 00:42:32,586
Tie it, It better hold,

546
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:44,535
Forget me. It you can, get away,

547
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:46,270
Would you?

548
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:51,416
Go tetch, wonder dog.

549
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:15,839
Move it, Walker,

550
00:43:19,144 --> 00:43:22,341
Keep it taut, Ryan, keep it taut!

551
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:29,080
Hal, come in please, Hal, come in please, Over.

552
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:56,007
I don't trust him,

553
00:44:30,148 --> 00:44:31,809
Damn.

554
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:40,187
I don't think we need two guides,

555
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,894
Retire him when he comes down,

556
00:44:43,962 --> 00:44:47,398
They're going to kill you ! Don't come down !

557
00:44:47,466 --> 00:44:49,525
Pull the rope, Pull the rope!

558
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,798
Pull, goddamn it! Pull !

559
00:45:00,078 --> 00:45:02,546
- Come on! Pull!
- Pull it!

560
00:45:05,951 --> 00:45:07,282
Pull, goddamn it!

561
00:45:07,352 --> 00:45:09,013
Ow!

562
00:45:25,537 --> 00:45:26,868
Watch it!

563
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:30,299
- Get him!
- No!

564
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:32,070
Do it,

565
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:56,257
Your friend just had the most expensive funeral in history,

566
00:46:56,294 --> 00:46:58,455
Now it's only you,

567
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,124
Come in, Rescue Unit. Come in.

568
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,362
Hal, what's going on? Hal?

569
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:06,028
Talk,

570
00:47:06,104 --> 00:47:09,039
No messages, no codes, no tricks,

571
00:47:09,107 --> 00:47:12,201
You haven't found us It was a fake call,

572
00:47:13,278 --> 00:47:15,371
Jessie, I've just reached the top ot the tower,

573
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:17,915
So far, there's no sign of anyone.

574
00:47:17,949 --> 00:47:20,247
Looks like a phony call, Over,

575
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:24,345
You've got to be kidding me, Do you want me to fly up after you? Over,

576
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:26,914
No, Negative, The winds are still too high,

577
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:29,256
I'm going to ride out the storm up here,

578
00:47:29,327 --> 00:47:32,387
We'll take shelter at the old Doug--

579
00:47:32,464 --> 00:47:34,159
Hal, I'm losing you, Come in,

580
00:47:34,232 --> 00:47:36,325
Come in, Hal. Over.

581
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:39,268
Go on to the next case,

582
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,840
He said the tower, but he's on Comb Bluff,

583
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:49,141
Frank, fly me to the west valley, The winds are never too strong there.

584
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:51,512
It's only a half-hour climb to the Douglas Shaft,

585
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:54,040
It's the only shelter around, Hal would have to go there,

586
00:47:54,085 --> 00:47:57,782
- Jessie, that is a bad idea,
- Please, Frank,

587
00:47:57,856 --> 00:48:00,848
If I don't find him, you can come pick me up by nightfall,

588
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:02,950
Hal would have my head,

589
00:48:03,028 --> 00:48:05,929
And it's such a handsome head,

590
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,497
Please, Frank,

591
00:48:10,535 --> 00:48:12,935
I'll buy one of your paintings,

592
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,141
Hold up!

593
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:28,981
Where is it?

594
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:37,190
There, On top ot the peak.

595
00:48:37,262 --> 00:48:39,093
- Come on,
- Hold it,

596
00:48:41,132 --> 00:48:43,259
Looks like a winding route to me,

597
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:48,398
The fastest way is straight up the east face,

598
00:48:48,473 --> 00:48:51,499
Of course, there are only 12 guys in the world who could do it,

599
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:53,271
You want to try it?

600
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:40,912
Gabe, What's happened?

601
00:50:40,985 --> 00:50:43,886
Oh, my God, You're frozen, Come sit down,

602
00:50:43,955 --> 00:50:48,016
Gabe, where's your pack, your sweater? Talk to me, What happened?

603
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:49,491
They got Hal,

604
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:52,189
The distress call was a fake.

605
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:56,122
Fake? What do you mean it was fake?

606
00:50:56,201 --> 00:51:00,035
Before they crashed, they dumped cases of money,

607
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:02,129
- Who's they?
- I don't know,

608
00:51:02,207 --> 00:51:05,506
They're using Hal to find it, When they do, he's dead,

609
00:51:05,577 --> 00:51:08,410
You gotta get on the radio and call Frank...

610
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:12,347
and tell him to call the state police,

611
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:15,352
The cold killed my radio, but Frank's gonna be looking tor me,

612
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,150
- We'll contact them from the chopper,
- The sun goes down in an hour.

613
00:51:18,223 --> 00:51:20,123
What do you want me to do?

614
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:23,525
Let's take everything we need, Let's move,

615
00:51:23,595 --> 00:51:26,063
We got to get to that next case before they do.

616
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:33,093
We're close!

617
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:36,106
- It's just up there!
- It better be,

618
00:51:37,342 --> 00:51:41,176
You know something? I'm getting real fucking tired of your threats,

619
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:42,873
Are you?

620
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:21,912
It's there,

621
00:52:34,365 --> 00:52:37,300
Oh, my God, What do we do now?

622
00:52:37,335 --> 00:52:38,996
You got a pencil?

623
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:23,536
Over here

624
00:53:45,403 --> 00:53:47,064
Goddamn,

625
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,500
The son of a bitch is still alive!

626
00:53:57,582 --> 00:54:00,073
I'm beginning to dislike this Mr Walker.

627
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:05,119
He can't be far. Find him, Go,

628
00:54:27,345 --> 00:54:29,006
Go,

629
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,052
Come on,

630
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:25,959
Give me a flare,

631
00:55:27,472 --> 00:55:29,406
- Meet me at Eagle's Cape,
- I'm not leaving,

632
00:55:29,474 --> 00:55:31,408
Don't worry about me!

633
00:56:51,923 --> 00:56:53,891
Gravity's a bitch, isn't it?

634
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:56,222
Fuck the money, and fuck you!

635
00:56:56,294 --> 00:56:58,888
I wasn't born to die on a mountain.

636
00:56:58,963 --> 00:57:01,193
Where were you born to die? Got a place picked out?

637
00:57:01,265 --> 00:57:03,961
I don't need to hear that shit from you, boy,

638
00:57:04,035 --> 00:57:06,902
Maybe this boy should make this big mouth bigger.

639
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:08,962
Stop this!

640
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,838
The fight's not here, It's out there,

641
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,914
Find us some shelter,

642
00:57:26,424 --> 00:57:28,858
Next time you're, like, watching MTV, you know...

643
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:32,225
take a split second and flip it to the Weather Channel,

644
00:57:32,263 --> 00:57:35,255
I mean, hey, where would you rather be right now?

645
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:38,769
Here in tent city, or at home playing some righteous air hockey?

646
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:40,771
Air hockey's definitely got my vote,

647
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:43,773
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly,

648
00:57:43,841 --> 00:57:45,775
- Cheesehead?
- Cheesehead,

649
00:57:50,948 --> 00:57:53,348
- He was here.
- What was in there?

650
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:55,544
Answer the man,

651
00:57:55,586 --> 00:57:58,987
- Nothing, Just tourist souvenirs.
- Or equipment,

652
00:57:59,056 --> 00:58:01,957
Maybe Walker plans to look after his friend here,

653
00:58:02,026 --> 00:58:03,994
He's not my friend,,,

654
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:07,292
and I don't like him any more than I do you,

655
00:58:07,365 --> 00:58:09,458
Nice try.

656
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:13,333
But I never underestimate the power of loyalty when it comes naturally,

657
00:58:14,472 --> 00:58:17,373
Not like the kind that has to be paid for,

658
00:58:18,943 --> 00:58:20,205
Make a fire,

659
00:58:23,342 --> 00:58:25,936
It costs a fortune to heat this place.

660
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,348
That's bad humor, I know.

661
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:41,389
We better get some sleep. We're gonna need it.

662
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:57,342
Rescue units, come in.

663
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,640
Again, do you read? Come in.

664
00:59:00,713 --> 00:59:03,876
What the hell is going on up there?

665
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,178
Hal.

666
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:08,220
Jessie, do you read?

667
00:59:08,287 --> 00:59:11,950
Jessie. It looks as if we're drawing a crowd.

668
00:59:12,024 --> 00:59:15,016
We're down to a tew hours before the whole fucking world shows up.

669
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:17,028
- Where's the next one?
- On the tower.

670
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:18,620
How far?

671
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:22,699
He asked how far, goddamn it!

672
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:26,932
You know what I think? I think you've been taking the scenic route.

673
00:59:27,006 --> 00:59:29,133
How far is it?

674
00:59:29,175 --> 00:59:31,166
Half a day.

675
00:59:31,243 --> 00:59:34,701
- It's haIf a day.
- Hey, Hal!

676
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,341
Check it out, man. It's Hal. Hey, man, you stuck up here too?

677
00:59:38,584 --> 00:59:41,052
- You missed a great jump yesterday.
- Walk over.

678
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,816
For Christ's sakes, man, they're just kids.

679
00:59:43,889 --> 00:59:46,824
- Why don't you let them go?
- We're not animals.

680
00:59:46,892 --> 00:59:50,020
Don't force us to be. Walk over

681
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:56,134
Me and him were in tent city last night.

682
00:59:57,169 --> 00:59:59,000
- Yeah.
- Hey, Hal.

683
00:59:59,071 --> 01:00:02,097
We're gonna take one last jump and split.

684
01:00:02,174 --> 01:00:03,937
You baby-sitting hikers?

685
01:00:08,714 --> 01:00:10,181
Get the hell out--

686
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:41,341
Son of a bitch. You didn't have to kill him!

687
01:00:41,413 --> 01:00:42,937
Shut up!

688
01:00:44,116 --> 01:00:45,913
Sue me.

689
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:50,644
Fuck.

690
01:01:21,754 --> 01:01:22,812
Shoot him!

691
01:01:24,189 --> 01:01:25,656
Shoot him!

692
01:01:49,214 --> 01:01:51,148
Shit. Ow!

693
01:01:56,021 --> 01:01:57,648
You murdering motherfuck.

694
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,952
Kill a few people, they calI you a murderer.

695
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:05,028
Kill a million, and you're a conqueror.

696
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:06,962
Go tigure.

697
01:02:07,032 --> 01:02:10,160
Move on, Tucker. Time is short.

698
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:58,443
Okay. Just like you said.

699
01:02:58,684 --> 01:03:01,084
He's taking them the long way around.

700
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:04,088
To stay ahead ot them, we're gonna have to go through that crack.

701
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,987
You said there was a way across.

702
01:03:11,363 --> 01:03:13,194
- Where the fuck is it?
- There.

703
01:03:17,436 --> 01:03:20,667
Hell with the money. Radio the chopper.

704
01:03:22,207 --> 01:03:24,607
You just don't get it, do you?

705
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:28,874
We're in bed now, joined at the hip, partners in crime.

706
01:03:30,382 --> 01:03:34,978
You've crossed over, Travers, and there's no crossing back.

707
01:03:57,443 --> 01:03:59,911
All right, that'll keep it dry.

708
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:10,321
Okay, let's do it.

709
01:04:14,426 --> 01:04:16,451
Get a good footing.

710
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,030
Okay.

711
01:04:26,138 --> 01:04:28,072
It's slick, Jess.

712
01:04:31,343 --> 01:04:33,675
Good foothold.

713
01:05:06,678 --> 01:05:09,203
Jessie, don't move.

714
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:13,784
Oh, my God.

715
01:05:16,054 --> 01:05:18,181
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

716
01:05:20,592 --> 01:05:22,355
Jessie, you gotta get down !

717
01:05:22,594 --> 01:05:23,959
Come on !

718
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:27,057
Get down!

719
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:30,127
Stay close to me.

720
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:36,868
All right, get down.

721
01:05:36,942 --> 01:05:38,136
Hold on to me.

722
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,976
It's on my back!

723
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:50,913
Let's get out!

724
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,418
It's off your back. There's nothing on your back.

725
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,026
It's okay.

726
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:04,732
Rocky Mountain Rescue Center, this is Rescue 3. Over.

727
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:08,901
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center. Go ahead.

728
01:06:10,075 --> 01:06:13,044
The vis is good. I've got at least 20 miles in all directions.

729
01:06:13,111 --> 01:06:15,944
If anyone's out here, I'll find them. Over.

730
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,982
Roger, 3. Center out.

731
01:06:29,728 --> 01:06:31,286
Center, this is 3.

732
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:34,890
I've picked up a signal on the thermal imager just north of Comb Bluff.

733
01:06:34,967 --> 01:06:36,935
Landing to investigate.

734
01:07:24,016 --> 01:07:27,008
Get out! Get out ot here!

735
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:31,188
Get the hell out!

736
01:07:40,832 --> 01:07:43,926
Here, I got you. I got you.

737
01:07:44,002 --> 01:07:47,062
I got you, son. I got you.

738
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:49,664
There's the opening.

739
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:52,404
When I get up there, I'll hook up the line...

740
01:07:52,644 --> 01:07:54,271
and you follow me up.

741
01:07:54,346 --> 01:07:56,940
- Okay?
- All right.

742
01:08:05,424 --> 01:08:08,825
- The other one is tollowing.
- I'll move to a high point, flank him.

743
01:08:08,894 --> 01:08:11,226
Don't kill him until you get the money.

744
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,820
Sure.

745
01:08:18,437 --> 01:08:20,701
Mr. Wright, we found the I.D. on the dead pilof.

746
01:08:20,772 --> 01:08:22,899
He was known to fly for Qualen. Over.

747
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,204
What about the Treasury jet? Over.

748
01:08:25,277 --> 01:08:27,302
lts wreckage is scattered over a two-mile area.

749
01:08:27,379 --> 01:08:29,779
No bodies have been found. Over.

750
01:08:29,848 --> 01:08:33,841
Finally. An F.A.A. satellite has located a downed aircraft.

751
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:37,912
Head 110 miles south-southwest of the park entrance.

752
01:08:38,757 --> 01:08:41,248
Treasury Control, get the rescue people on their way.

753
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:43,794
We're headed straight there. One out

754
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:45,160
Center out.

755
01:09:10,422 --> 01:09:12,890
I got it, Jess.

756
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:15,688
We're almost out. I can chop through.

757
01:09:43,889 --> 01:09:45,151
Jessie, come on up!

758
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,747
Okay!

759
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:54,293
Walker.

760
01:09:54,332 --> 01:09:57,130
Small world, ain't it?

761
01:09:57,169 --> 01:09:59,194
Don't even think about it.

762
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:02,807
Your lite's on sale, Walker.

763
01:10:02,874 --> 01:10:04,671
The price is 30 million.

764
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:07,337
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

765
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:11,411
What the fuck are you talking about? Where's the money?

766
01:10:11,616 --> 01:10:14,346
I burned it. Never could save anything.

767
01:10:15,353 --> 01:10:19,255
Not even a dumb mountain boy like you would burn $30 million.

768
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:22,821
I don't make deals, Walker, but I'll make one with you.

769
01:10:22,894 --> 01:10:26,352
Hand over the money, and I'll just kill you and not the girl.

770
01:10:27,866 --> 01:10:29,197
Give me the money!

771
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:35,135
Gabe?

772
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:38,307
All right.

773
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:57,318
Come on. Come on!

774
01:10:57,362 --> 01:10:58,920
- Can you walk
- Yeah.

775
01:10:58,997 --> 01:11:00,988
Kynette, what's going on? Where's the money?

776
01:11:02,734 --> 01:11:05,066
- He said he torched it.
- Where is he now?

777
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:06,797
He dropped down into some cave.

778
01:11:07,839 --> 01:11:09,773
You've had your chance. Move it out now.

779
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:11,672
- Kristel, get the C-4.
- Roger.

780
01:11:11,743 --> 01:11:13,734
Just give me five minutes.

781
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:16,440
I said get the fuck out of there.

782
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:19,712
Good. And blow up that black bastard while you're at it.

783
01:11:19,784 --> 01:11:22,252
Save me the time ot doing it meself.

784
01:11:41,206 --> 01:11:44,937
It you want me, I'll be here!

785
01:11:50,448 --> 01:11:52,416
I'm in here!

786
01:12:04,663 --> 01:12:06,426
I'm in here.

787
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,194
You're making it too easy for me.

788
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:39,262
No bullets, bitch!

789
01:12:48,873 --> 01:12:52,365
Now, I'm gonna ask you just three times: where's the money?

790
01:12:56,147 --> 01:12:57,375
Sissy.

791
01:12:57,449 --> 01:12:59,076
You hit like a sissy.

792
01:13:01,186 --> 01:13:04,644
Wrong answer, motherfucker!

793
01:13:07,058 --> 01:13:09,026
Get up!

794
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,029
Now, I'm gonna ask you for a second time.

795
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:14,657
Where is the money?

796
01:13:15,734 --> 01:13:17,725
Burned it.

797
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:19,669
Wrong answer!

798
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,075
Time to kill a mountain man.

799
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:40,080
It amazes me, in this day and age, when a man...

800
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:42,217
will put money...

801
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,625
before the personal safety...

802
01:13:44,696 --> 01:13:47,893
of himseIf and his bitch.

803
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:54,830
At least you can go to your grave knowing...

804
01:13:54,906 --> 01:13:57,170
that I'm gonna treat the bitch...

805
01:13:58,243 --> 01:13:59,904
right!

806
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:21,894
Are you okay? Oh, God! I thought he killed you!

807
01:14:23,101 --> 01:14:25,968
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

808
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,009
Hal, Jessie, do you read?

809
01:14:32,077 --> 01:14:34,170
Again, do you read? Come in.

810
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:38,411
Hal, Jessie, what the hell's going on up there?

811
01:14:38,616 --> 01:14:40,846
Jessie, find it.

812
01:14:54,232 --> 01:14:55,665
It's ready.

813
01:14:57,268 --> 01:14:59,202
Rescue 1, Rescue 2.

814
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:01,830
- Do you copy? Over.
- Here it is!

815
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,937
I found Evan in the east valley.

816
01:15:05,009 --> 01:15:06,943
He's got a gunshot wound in the back.

817
01:15:07,011 --> 01:15:10,640
He's en route to the medical center in Granby in critical condition.

818
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:14,242
In case you can hear this, I'm resuming my search.

819
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:15,445
Come on !

820
01:15:18,156 --> 01:15:20,920
You'll make somebody a tine wife someday.

821
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,025
You should see me bake a cake.

822
01:15:38,877 --> 01:15:42,210
He's still alive, tor another four minutes.

823
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:45,182
- Where's it set?
- Primed to go oft right over his head.

824
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:48,109
Fuck!

825
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:51,912
Gabe, three minutes! There's a bomb!

826
01:15:51,956 --> 01:15:55,323
Get the hell out of there! There's a bomb over your head!

827
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:00,731
Jessie, get the gear!

828
01:16:07,172 --> 01:16:10,107
Come on, Jessie. This way.

829
01:16:10,175 --> 01:16:13,008
That charge is gonna cause a landslide. We gotta get to the west tace.

830
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:19,041
Why the hell are we wasting time?

831
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:21,984
Making sure he's not going to find that last case.

832
01:16:26,824 --> 01:16:28,792
You want to kill me, don't you, Tucker?

833
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:32,259
Well, take a number and get in line.

834
01:16:37,001 --> 01:16:40,095
The ledge is too far. Take this rope and pull it apart and tie it together.

835
01:16:40,171 --> 01:16:42,332
- We're gonna rappel down.
- This rope is 60 years old.

836
01:16:42,407 --> 01:16:44,272
- Will it hold?
- Don't think so.

837
01:16:44,342 --> 01:16:45,604
Bad answer.

838
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,421
Frank! Frank!

839
01:17:04,295 --> 01:17:07,093
- No, Frank!
- He can't see you.

840
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:09,065
Go!

841
01:17:24,249 --> 01:17:27,582
Here comes our ride. Move.

842
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:31,849
Okay, now, swing as hard as you can. Push !

843
01:18:19,771 --> 01:18:20,863
Jump.

844
01:19:17,662 --> 01:19:20,324
Frank! Frank! Frank!

845
01:19:54,799 --> 01:19:57,666
What's happening here? Where's the rest of the group?

846
01:19:59,203 --> 01:20:00,898
Welcome.

847
01:20:00,972 --> 01:20:02,405
What are you doing?

848
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,267
Now, back off!

849
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:07,610
I came here to help you.

850
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,703
You did.

851
01:20:09,781 --> 01:20:11,373
Don't move.

852
01:20:15,887 --> 01:20:17,946
- Frank! Frank!
- Better hurry, Tucker.

853
01:20:20,091 --> 01:20:21,615
Get out of here!

854
01:20:44,849 --> 01:20:46,441
You stupid maniac!

855
01:20:46,684 --> 01:20:49,983
- No one told you to shoot.
- We've wasted enough time.

856
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,419
Frank?

857
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,996
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

858
01:21:15,146 --> 01:21:17,740
This man never hurt anybody!

859
01:21:19,016 --> 01:21:21,041
Touching.

860
01:21:21,118 --> 01:21:23,609
Kristel, check the chopper. Let's go.

861
01:21:51,816 --> 01:21:53,784
Get back! Get back!

862
01:21:53,818 --> 01:21:56,719
Go! Jessie, run !

863
01:22:15,706 --> 01:22:17,469
That son of a bitch.

864
01:22:19,176 --> 01:22:22,976
All right. We use a chopper to locate the third case.

865
01:22:23,047 --> 01:22:25,914
- Then we get the hell out of here.
- No.

866
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:28,110
There's not enough fuel to search around.

867
01:22:28,185 --> 01:22:30,085
Just enough to get us down.

868
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:32,612
You're not running things, Travers

869
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:36,627
As soon as he finds the money, you're as dead as me.

870
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:41,223
Give me the monitor.

871
01:22:41,299 --> 01:22:42,766
Now.

872
01:22:55,913 --> 01:22:59,747
- What's the code, Travers?
- I told you, Qualen.

873
01:22:59,784 --> 01:23:03,015
Fifty thousand possible key code combinations...

874
01:23:03,087 --> 01:23:05,021
in 15-second intervals.

875
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,324
So, what's the fucking code?

876
01:23:15,433 --> 01:23:17,958
Well, look what Agent Travers found.

877
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:19,900
I guess he is running things after all.

878
01:23:19,971 --> 01:23:21,939
Isn't he?

879
01:23:23,741 --> 01:23:26,767
So what's the plan, Travers? We use the chopper to find the money.

880
01:23:26,844 --> 01:23:27,902
Right?

881
01:23:29,013 --> 01:23:31,743
What a good idea.

882
01:23:31,816 --> 01:23:34,307
But then again...

883
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:37,286
without a pilot...

884
01:23:37,355 --> 01:23:39,846
nobody even gets off this mountain.

885
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:43,092
What are you doing, Eric?

886
01:23:44,328 --> 01:23:47,661
Do you know what real love is, Kristel?

887
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,692
Sacrifice.

888
01:24:04,815 --> 01:24:07,443
Now I'm the only one who can fly us out of here.

889
01:24:07,685 --> 01:24:09,778
We're partners again.

890
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,754
Now, take your toy...

891
01:24:13,824 --> 01:24:16,054
and find our money.

892
01:24:18,329 --> 01:24:19,956
Radio when you find it.

893
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:24,100
I'm waiting here.

894
01:24:33,044 --> 01:24:35,376
All right, the last of the money's at Crockett River.

895
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:37,843
If we take the northern ridge, we can get there first.

896
01:24:37,915 --> 01:24:41,749
There is no "we." I'm gonna go along the north trail to Bitker Ladder.

897
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:43,844
You go on to the station tor help.

898
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:47,322
- Are you crazy?
- It they tind the money, Hal's dead.

899
01:24:47,391 --> 01:24:49,689
- Just get back there fast.
- All right.

900
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,287
Roger, Control. But where the hell are those National Guard choppers?

901
01:24:53,364 --> 01:24:55,696
They had a mechanical, sir. It's being worked on now

902
01:24:55,766 --> 01:24:58,894
- Their E.T.A. is one hour.
- An hour?

903
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,870
You got to do better than that. Now, get a move on. Out.

904
01:26:27,258 --> 01:26:28,657
Stop there.

905
01:26:32,363 --> 01:26:34,388
We're close.

906
01:26:34,632 --> 01:26:37,260
I got it locked in.

907
01:26:37,334 --> 01:26:40,667
So we're finished with him, yeah?

908
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:43,138
Yeah. Do it quietly.

909
01:26:43,207 --> 01:26:45,641
Your insane boss just made enough noise...

910
01:26:45,709 --> 01:26:48,200
tor anyone within ten miles to hear us.

911
01:26:51,215 --> 01:26:53,149
It's been fun.

912
01:26:58,656 --> 01:27:00,624
Hey, Delmar.

913
01:27:01,659 --> 01:27:04,253
From me to you...

914
01:27:04,328 --> 01:27:06,888
you're an asshole.

915
01:27:06,964 --> 01:27:08,363
Yeah?

916
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:11,367
And you're a loudmouth, punk slag...

917
01:27:11,402 --> 01:27:13,996
who's about to die.

918
01:27:14,071 --> 01:27:15,163
Maybe.

919
01:27:16,841 --> 01:27:19,776
But in a minute I'll be dead.

920
01:27:19,844 --> 01:27:21,709
You...

921
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:23,679
will always be an asshole.

922
01:27:23,714 --> 01:27:26,774
So go ahead and shoot.

923
01:27:26,851 --> 01:27:28,648
I'm getting cold.

924
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:34,123
Shoot!

925
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:38,117
Who's shooting?

926
01:27:44,235 --> 01:27:45,862
Tell me...

927
01:27:45,936 --> 01:27:48,166
do you like soccer?

928
01:27:48,205 --> 01:27:49,797
It's a great sport.

929
01:27:49,874 --> 01:27:54,709
I was a fucking good striker. Isn't that something?

930
01:28:05,222 --> 01:28:07,918
Oh, God!

931
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:09,254
Fuck you!

932
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:11,317
Ah, you're swearing now.

933
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:16,330
That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike.

934
01:28:21,605 --> 01:28:22,936
A lovely little chip shot.

935
01:28:25,576 --> 01:28:28,238
He dribbles past one detender...

936
01:28:28,312 --> 01:28:30,746
two detenders...

937
01:28:30,814 --> 01:28:32,179
three defenders.

938
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:42,117
Striker lines up at the penalty spot.

939
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:44,285
He focuses on the ball.

940
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:46,295
The crowd is on its feet.

941
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:48,923
Striker moves to his left.

942
01:28:48,999 --> 01:28:51,160
He draws back his foot.

943
01:28:51,235 --> 01:28:52,668
He comes in.

944
01:29:12,656 --> 01:29:14,715
Season's over, asshole!

945
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:25,091
I said quietly.

946
01:29:57,101 --> 01:29:59,695
What the fuck is going on?

947
01:30:01,772 --> 01:30:03,706
This is not right.

948
01:30:18,222 --> 01:30:19,746
Fuck!

949
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,199
Goddamn.

950
01:30:40,277 --> 01:30:42,745
Fuck you, Walker!

951
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:48,750
Fucker!

952
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,919
Goddamn it!

953
01:31:02,733 --> 01:31:04,701
Come in, goddamn it.

954
01:31:06,904 --> 01:31:08,872
Have you got what we need?

955
01:31:08,939 --> 01:31:12,272
It's Walker. The son of a bitch is still alive, Qualen.

956
01:31:12,309 --> 01:31:14,277
No names. This is an open line.

957
01:31:14,311 --> 01:31:16,905
I don't give a shit, Eric Qualen!

958
01:31:18,482 --> 01:31:20,382
Had to be insane to tie up..

959
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:23,648
with a lowlife piece of shit like you anyway.

960
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:24,778
They beat us.

961
01:31:26,123 --> 01:31:29,923
A couple of fucking mountain rangers beat us.

962
01:31:29,993 --> 01:31:33,895
Jesus Christ, that's Travers. Get a bead on that frequency.

963
01:31:33,964 --> 01:31:37,195
They beat the man no law agency ever could.

964
01:31:37,267 --> 01:31:38,666
Get off the radio.

965
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:41,671
And I'm finding that pretty fucking hilarious, Qualen.

966
01:31:41,738 --> 01:31:43,899
Stop transmitting, you stupid bastard!

967
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:47,000
It's hard to believe I sold out atter 20 years...

968
01:31:47,077 --> 01:31:49,443
and this is my payback?

969
01:31:49,646 --> 01:31:53,082
To run on a mountain with a fucking dirtbag like you!

970
01:31:53,117 --> 01:31:55,244
Travers, you've lost your mind.

971
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,652
Lost it. Have I lost it?

972
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:02,317
Fucking A, I've lost it, Qualen! Pure, fucking section eight!

973
01:32:04,294 --> 01:32:06,353
I gotta go.

974
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:09,194
I'm on my last ofticiaI manhunt.

975
01:32:10,267 --> 01:32:12,235
Adios, mothertucker!

976
01:32:19,977 --> 01:32:22,002
You got a bearing on that frequency yet?

977
01:32:23,213 --> 01:32:25,943
Yes. Eight minutes away.

978
01:32:44,201 --> 01:32:46,169
You're dead, Walker!

979
01:33:41,959 --> 01:33:43,119
Frank!

980
01:35:21,725 --> 01:35:23,124
I won, Walker!

981
01:35:41,378 --> 01:35:42,868
Gabe!

982
01:36:05,268 --> 01:36:07,202
Travers, come in.

983
01:36:12,342 --> 01:36:15,800
Compliments of Delmar. Too late. You missed him.

984
01:36:15,879 --> 01:36:18,370
He decided to take a swim to Arizona.

985
01:36:18,448 --> 01:36:21,246
- Tucker.
- That's right.

986
01:36:22,219 --> 01:36:24,346
Congratulations.

987
01:36:24,588 --> 01:36:25,646
Qualen?

988
01:36:26,923 --> 01:36:28,857
It's all over.

989
01:36:28,925 --> 01:36:32,019
Walker. You resilient bastard.

990
01:36:32,095 --> 01:36:34,825
So you're still alive.

991
01:36:34,898 --> 01:36:36,991
I want that money, and I want it now.

992
01:36:37,067 --> 01:36:39,627
Qualen, the game's over.

993
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:40,761
You lost.

994
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:43,965
Oh, no. The game's just getting interesting.

995
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:46,008
I'm airborne now, you see.

996
01:36:47,744 --> 01:36:50,406
As a matter of fact, I've picked up a passenger...

997
01:36:50,647 --> 01:36:52,239
you might be interested in.

998
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:56,652
Go on, talk.

999
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,915
I said talk, goddamn it!

1000
01:37:00,924 --> 01:37:03,791
Hal, he's got me. I'm sorry. I thought he was Frank.

1001
01:37:03,827 --> 01:37:05,920
You get the picture, Walker?

1002
01:37:05,996 --> 01:37:08,430
Now, I want that money.

1003
01:37:08,665 --> 01:37:11,361
Meet me at the highest point from where you are.

1004
01:37:11,435 --> 01:37:14,165
If you don't, we're going to find out...

1005
01:37:14,237 --> 01:37:17,172
if this little angel of yours can fly.

1006
01:37:18,341 --> 01:37:20,969
Jessie, take him to the highest point near Bitker Ladder.

1007
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:24,138
I'll meet you there. Don 't worry.

1008
01:37:24,214 --> 01:37:26,341
Love's a killer, isn't it?

1009
01:37:41,998 --> 01:37:45,161
- Where are you, Walker?
- You're getting warmer. Keep climbing.

1010
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,331
You're getting closer.

1011
01:37:48,371 --> 01:37:50,362
Look out.

1012
01:38:08,225 --> 01:38:10,887
I must admit, you're a real piece of work.

1013
01:38:10,961 --> 01:38:13,725
Yeah, and I must admit, you're a real piece of shit.

1014
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,808
Throw it up, or I'll kill her.

1015
01:38:25,842 --> 01:38:28,868
You do, and the cash is gone.

1016
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:32,676
- The money.
- I want you to put her down.

1017
01:38:32,716 --> 01:38:34,081
Over there!

1018
01:39:28,138 --> 01:39:29,662
Jessie, run !

1019
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:31,934
- What about you?
- Run!

1020
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:34,700
Run !

1021
01:39:36,613 --> 01:39:37,841
Come on, Qualen.

1022
01:39:37,881 --> 01:39:41,009
I got what you want. Come on.

1023
01:39:48,992 --> 01:39:51,358
Come on. Come and get it.

1024
01:39:56,333 --> 01:39:58,267
Come on. Closer.

1025
01:39:59,336 --> 01:40:01,827
Come on, closer.

1026
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:04,066
- A little closer, Qualen.
- Throw it in.

1027
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:06,040
Bring it closer.

1028
01:40:07,143 --> 01:40:08,201
Oh, my God.

1029
01:40:15,652 --> 01:40:17,142
Throw it in.

1030
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:36,238
Damn you, Walker!

1031
01:40:52,989 --> 01:40:54,115
Run !

1032
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:35,924
Jessie, move!

1033
01:41:46,843 --> 01:41:47,901
Come on.

1034
01:42:27,884 --> 01:42:31,149
It's just us now, you piece of shit.

1035
01:42:46,069 --> 01:42:48,367
Watch out!

1036
01:42:48,404 --> 01:42:50,395
Get out of there, man !

1037
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:56,105
Stick around.

1038
01:42:59,883 --> 01:43:01,180
We had a deal...

1039
01:43:01,251 --> 01:43:03,811
and now we've just got each other.

1040
01:43:04,988 --> 01:43:07,115
You're not afraid to die.

1041
01:43:12,662 --> 01:43:13,959
Come on, get him!

1042
01:43:19,402 --> 01:43:20,198
Get out ot there!

1043
01:43:21,271 --> 01:43:22,829
Remember, shithead.

1044
01:43:22,872 --> 01:43:25,363
Keep your arms and legs in the vehicle...

1045
01:43:25,608 --> 01:43:27,166
at all times!

1046
01:43:47,931 --> 01:43:49,922
Give me the rope!

1047
01:43:53,803 --> 01:43:55,168
Okay.

1048
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:00,439
I'm out ot here.

1049
01:44:23,299 --> 01:44:27,360
Gabe, buddy, you think you could have put a little less eftort in that climb?

1050
01:44:27,604 --> 01:44:30,164
I mean, I thought you were in shape.

1051
01:44:31,674 --> 01:44:33,665
- I guess I'm just falling apart.
- Yeah.

1052
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:35,302
This is Agent Wright. Copy?

1053
01:44:35,378 --> 01:44:39,109
- Yeah, copy.
- Please identify yourselves. Over.

1054
01:44:39,182 --> 01:44:41,844
Yeah, this is Hal Tucker, Rocky Mountain Rescue.

1055
01:44:41,918 --> 01:44:44,614
Hey, we're glad to see you guys.

1056
01:44:44,687 --> 01:44:46,621
If you're looking for Mr. Qualen...

1057
01:44:46,689 --> 01:44:49,749
try about 4,000 feet south of here.

1058
01:44:49,826 --> 01:44:52,386
He'll be the one wearing a helicopfer. Over.

1059
01:44:52,629 --> 01:44:54,028
Good.

1060
01:44:54,097 --> 01:44:56,122
I'll arrange transportation for the three of you...
