2
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:33,010
Cliffhanger (1993)

3
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,431
Rescue 3.
Jessie, do you see him yet?

4
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,351
Patience, my love, patience.

5
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,565
Wait a minute.
I think I have him sighted.

6
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,484
Frank, what's the word?

7
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,529
The word is we got him
over there.

8
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,327
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Over.

9
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,954
This is 3. Go ahead.

10
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,290
Jessie, we're getting general clearance
in the southeastern region of the park.

11
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:49,086
You will probably have sufficient
cloud base to get into the tower...

12
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,840
but please be advised you'll still
encounter strong winds and turbulence.

13
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,801
We would advise
against a winch rescue. Over.

14
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,304
Wilco, Center. I'll proceed
with wire cross trom opposite tower.

15
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,849
- Three out.
- Center out.

16
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,117
Gabe, Hal's signaling he's okay.

17
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,953
Gabe?

18
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,248
Gabe, where are you?

19
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,333
I'm just hanging out, Jess.

20
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,961
Oh, my God.

21
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,802
I don't recognize the face,
but the butt does look vaguely familiar.

22
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,556
Hey, be careful,
or you'll embarrass old Frank.

23
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,058
It would take a heap more
than that, rock-jock.

24
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,685
Yeah.

25
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,975
Gabe?

26
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,311
They're below
the top of the tower.

27
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,396
They're on the ledge
just above you.

28
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,482
You got another few feet.

29
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,699
- Glad you could join us.
- Yeah, sure. Hi, Sarah.

30
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,117
Hi, Gabe.

31
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,745
So, how's the knee?

32
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,248
I think it's out.
No big deal.

33
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,960
I remember when you twisted it
getting out of that hot tub.

34
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,463
I thought it was
an old war wound from 'Nam.

35
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,507
Really? Hmm.

36
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,968
Rescue 3.

37
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,470
I've located a stranded climber.

38
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,306
Jessie, please send down
a transport line.

39
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,777
So, tell me, how you teeling?

40
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,154
Fine, considering.

41
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,490
What do you say we take oft...

42
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,910
and leave this clown behind, huh?

43
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,203
Don't tempt me.

44
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,503
Rescue 3.

45
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,922
Please be advised
that Ranger Walker...

46
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,175
is making advances
toward my girlfriend...

47
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,803
that's liable to get his ass kicked
right off this mountain.

48
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,055
Be informed Gabe makes advances
to me only...

49
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,017
or he'll be climbing down
4,000 teet and sleeping outside.

50
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,561
Baby, he lies.

51
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,639
- Is it really 4,000?
- Yeah, just about.

52
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:33,143
Hey, remember, whatever this guy says
about me, don't believe it, okay?

53
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,478
Thanks.

54
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,575
Okay. Come on over.

55
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,542
I know you're nervous, but
we've done this a hundred times, okay?

56
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,085
Mm-hmm.

57
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,591
Excuse me, Captain Hot Tub?

58
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,762
Keep your arms and legs
inside the vehicle at all times.

59
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,933
That's great, Hal.

60
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,436
That really inspires contidence.

61
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,655
So, how did this clown talk you
into climbing up to the tower?

62
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,032
He told me
it was better than sex.

63
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,701
Really?

64
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,622
You ready for the best ride
in the park?

65
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,709
Give me a second.
I'll let you know.

66
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,598
You look like hell.

67
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,974
He made it.

68
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,976
Ot course he did.

69
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,145
Really, there's nothing to it.

70
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,022
Okay, I can do this.

71
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,565
Sure you can.

72
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,901
I'm sorry
tor all the trouble, really.

73
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,445
- Oh, Sarah, don't worry about it.
- Thanks.

74
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,322
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

75
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,494
- We're still on for dinner tonight?
- Of course we are.

76
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,996
Okay.

77
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,249
Okay. You're ready now.

78
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,584
That's it.

79
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,173
Now, just sit
right down into it.

80
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,511
Come on, guys.
The wind's picking up.

81
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,473
Sarah, just keep
your eyes on me.

82
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,974
No, don't look... Sarah.

83
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,602
Sarah, look at me.
That's it.

84
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,730
- Right.
- Just start to pull.

85
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,690
One hand after another.

86
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,194
You're doing great...
really, great. Keep goin'.

87
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,031
And just keep looking at me.

88
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,659
That's great!
You're starting to look like a pro.

89
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,494
Keep going.

90
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,412
That's it.
Nice and easy.

91
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,707
Hey, Hal, we're gonna
be out ot a job soon.

92
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,292
A little more, Sarah.

93
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,877
That's it.

94
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,880
One, two.

95
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,470
Oh, God!

96
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,389
Gabe! Gabe!

97
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,432
No!

98
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,976
Hold on!

99
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,146
- I'm going to fall!
- No, you're not!

100
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,065
You're going to be okay!

101
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:29,570
- Can you reach the main line?
- No, I can't! I'm slipping!

102
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,906
- Gabe, can you keep the line steady?
- That clip's not gonna hold!

103
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,951
I can't hold on!
Help me, please!

104
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,662
- Gabe, you have to go after her.
- No!

105
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,582
- Gabe, no!
- I'm coming out to get you!

106
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,460
It's not rigged for two. Keep it trom
swinging. I'll send out my harness.

107
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,504
No time!
I'm going tor her!

108
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,549
Gabe, shit! No!

109
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,301
Sarah, I'm coming tor you!

110
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,303
I can't hold on! I'm slipping!

111
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,139
Hold on just a little bit longer!
I'm coming for you!

112
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,434
Gabe, please hurry!
I can't hold on!

113
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,895
Don't look down.
Keep looking at me.

114
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,814
- That's it. Hold it.
- I'm trying!

115
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,568
It's breaking.
She's losing it.

116
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,739
Sarah! He'll have you
in a second, baby!

117
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,283
Come on, baby!
Don't you give up!

118
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,454
Hurry, Gabe.
You're almost there.

119
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,873
- Keep going.
- I'm here, Sarah.

120
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,708
Sarah, I'm here.

121
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,586
I don't want to die!

122
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,923
Reach up and grab him!
Reach up!

123
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,550
- Sarah, reach up!
- Come on, honey!

124
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,469
- Use your other hand!
- Reach up!

125
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,894
Hold on! Hold on!
I got you! I got you.

126
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,897
I can't hold on!
I'm going to die!

127
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,316
You're not going to die.

128
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,903
Don't you lose her, Gabe.

129
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,655
I got her. Reach up.

130
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,157
I'm slipping. I'm slipping!

131
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,495
- You can do it, Sarah.
- Hold her, Gabe!

132
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,330
Please don't let me tall.

133
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,582
Please, I don't want to die.

134
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,543
- You're not gonna die.
- I'm slipping!

135
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,795
Sarah, I got you!
Just reach up!

136
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,005
I can't, Gabe!

137
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,466
You can do it.
Please, baby, just reach up!

138
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,344
Hal! Hal! I'm slipping!

139
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,680
Gabe, man, don't you lose her!

140
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,224
- Don't you let her go!
- Don't let me tall.

141
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm slipping!

142
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,105
Sarah, please.

143
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,107
No, I'm slipping! Gabe!

144
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,109
Gabe, don't let me tall!

145
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,529
- No!
- Help me! I'm talling! Gabe!

146
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,876
No! Sarah, no!

147
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,388
Jesus Christ.

148
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,288
Treasury Agent Mac Lamoore,
please contact D. A. U.

149
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,342
Lock 'em up.

150
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,763
Travers, we'll be fueled up
and ready to go in ten minutes.

151
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,015
Very good.

152
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,856
Mr. Travers.

153
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,027
- Hey, Rich.
- Morning, Walt.

154
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,112
This is Agent Matheson, F. B. I.

155
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,280
Travers.

156
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:03,617
Matheson has been transferred
from the Denver oftice to Frisco.

157
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,788
As a protessional courtesy
I was asked if he could hitch a ride.

158
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,332
Got plenty ot room.
Be glad to accommodate you.

159
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,376
- Appreciate it.
- You're the boss.

160
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,128
Let's go. Matheson,
have you been totally brieted?

161
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,465
- I don't know about totally.
- Who the hell ever is?

162
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:21,343
It's the most protected shipment
we've got and the most useless.

163
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,428
These bills aren't even
in circulation.

164
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,640
$1,000 bills we're transporting are only
used for international banking exchange.

165
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,475
You always transport
through the air?

166
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,144
Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked,
trains derailed...

167
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,397
but nobody can touch us in tlight.

168
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,149
Haven't lost a bill in 12 years.
Don't jinx me now.

169
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:40,237
Treasury agents are the most
superstitious people in the government.

170
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,823
We should be.
Everybody wants what we have.

171
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,343
Gabe! Hey, man, Gabe!

172
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,679
- It's Gabe. He's back!
- I can see that.

173
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,183
Come on, man. Let's go!

174
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,622
How you doing, Gabe?

175
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,707
Dude, turn that down.

176
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,376
You guys.
How you doing, Brett, Evan?

177
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,421
Where you been?
You fall ott the planet or something?

178
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,841
- No, I've been working up in Denver.
- Work?

179
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,384
Don't say that word.

180
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,137
I hate work, even when
somebody else is doing it.

181
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,850
Gabe, we're tlying otf the tower today.
You should come with us.

182
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,561
Today's going to be the day
for a killer jump.

183
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,982
- No, thanks. Can't.
- Come on, man.

184
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,444
Don't tell me that job in Denver
made you scared ot heights?

185
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,826
You guys better watch out 'cause
some bad weather's comin' in, okay?

186
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,162
We like it extreme.

187
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:16,667
Hey, man, see you later, Gabe.
Good to have you back.

188
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,752
Yeah, good to see you. Later.

189
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,420
Peace.

190
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,273
How you doing, Jess?

191
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,738
Hello, Gabriel.

192
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,702
Got yourself a new horse?

193
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,749
- Where have you been?
- Just working.

194
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,962
Atter the tuneral,
I just had to leave.

195
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,131
Had to leave?

196
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,718
Believe me, a lot of us
wanted to leave.

197
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,178
But you know what?

198
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,180
We stayed.

199
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,642
Jess...

200
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,979
a lot ot things fell apart
on that ledge.

201
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,647
I know.

202
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,650
But I don't think
you know how much.

203
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,486
Why can't you just believe
you did everything you could?

204
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,031
Did I? I don't know.

205
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,325
Maybe I shouldn't have
gone out on that line.

206
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,662
Maybe I panicked.
I don't know.

207
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,831
I was there, remember?

208
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,209
You were the only one
who didn't panic.

209
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,921
Why don't you do us a tavor
and quit hording all the guilt?

210
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:47,966
You held on as long as you could.
And what about Hal?

211
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,845
What was Hal doing on the tower
with a girl who could barely climb?

212
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,681
I can't blame Hal tor anything.
It was me.

213
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,392
All me.

214
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,978
Well, give it up, Gabe...

215
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,606
because let me tell you something...
it doesn't get any better.

216
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,359
It doesn't get any better?

217
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,531
I really don't think
you understand.

218
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:14,034
- What?
- I don't think you understand.

219
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,036
I don't understand?

220
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,332
I think I'm the only one
that understands.

221
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,671
Believe me, there were times when I
didn't know what I wanted to do more...

222
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,382
hate you or love you.

223
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,553
But one thing I did know
and I still do know...

224
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,888
is I understand you.

225
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,320
Did you come back to stay?

226
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,036
You didn't.

227
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,666
I can't.

228
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,086
I can't. Not here.

229
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:10,424
Jessie, I came back tor you.

230
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,219
And it you like,
I want you to come with me.

231
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,769
You come back atter being gone for
almost a year and expect me to leave?

232
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,065
This is our home.

233
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,277
Now it's my home.

234
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,114
And I can't just pick up and go
for all the wrong reasons.

235
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,960
If you don't mind, I'd better
pick up the rest of my stuft.

236
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,671
You know where everything is.

237
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,965
I'm late for work.

238
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,732
Hey, big boy.

239
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,120
Roger, Five-Lima,
scattered, broken clouds...

240
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,456
20,000 feet with
a severe storm advisory.

241
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,667
Check the storm scope.

242
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,857
Travers says
you're being transterred.

243
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,942
Oh, yeah.
Moving up in the world.

244
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,878
The forecast... cloudy skies
with flurries today.

245
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,173
We can expect an inch of snow
and a high in the low 30s.

246
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:18,177
Overnight flurries will increase with
a total accumulation of three inches.

247
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,095
Tonight's low near 15.

248
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,973
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time
tor another masterpiece.

249
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,516
Hiya, Jess.

250
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,061
Oh, I think old Frank
nailed it with that stroke.

251
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,938
What do you think?

252
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,107
I don't know.

253
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,193
What do you see?

254
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,569
Surprise me.

255
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,071
What usually eats a banana?

256
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,907
A monkey.

257
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,576
This is a picture
ot a banana eating a monkey.

258
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,162
- Nature in reverse.
- Where?

259
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,831
Right here.

260
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:53,420
Frank, you look like
a normal guy, but he's not...

261
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,172
are you, Frankie?

262
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,007
Hey, I'm an artist.

263
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,105
We're being tracked.

264
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,399
- Jetstar, three o'clock.
- Travers!

265
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,569
Stay put. Don't anyone
jump to conclusions.

266
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,661
- He's coming in too slow.
- No, we're going too tast.

267
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,872
We're too high. Give me 180 knots,
drop to 15,000 feet.

268
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,791
You got it.

269
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:34,628
Christ. We're losing altitude
and slowing down. Get your weapons.

270
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,548
What the hell are you doing?
I have jurisdiction on this jet.

271
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,302
Now I have jurisdiction.
I said get your weapons!

272
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:45,264
These are highly trained agents,
Mr. Matheson.

273
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:49,268
I think you're overreacting.
Just calm down and give me the gun.

274
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:52,145
- You're out ot control.
- What the hell are you waiting for?

275
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,481
He's hijacking the shipment.

276
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,628
What the tuck was that?

277
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,685
- Move into position.
- Look alive, Kristel.

278
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,104
Crossover transfer,
ten seconds and counting.

279
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,023
November 1-2-niner-five Lima...

280
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,483
this is Jetstar
6-8-0 Tango-Tango.

281
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,195
Is frequency secure? Over.

282
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,031
Roger, Tango-Tango.
This is Five-Lima. Go ahead.

283
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:48,035
We have visual contact. What is
your heading, speed and level? Over.

284
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:51,496
We're heading 0-8-0
and doing 2-5-0 knots level...

285
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,041
at flight level 2-1-0-niner.

286
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,043
Five-Lima, we're opening up.

287
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,086
Rise and shine, gentlemen.
Let's make history.

288
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,672
Roger, Five-Lima.
We'll begin closing.

289
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,799
Bring your speed back to 1-5-0.

290
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:07,721
Commence descent to flight level 1-4-0
and turn right onto 2-6-0. Over.

291
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,685
We're level. Flight level 1-4-0
and steady, 2-6-0 degrees.

292
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,687
The weather ahead
looks a bit threatening.

293
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,731
Roger.

294
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,567
- Travers, report your position.
- Ready to disengage tail cone.

295
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,194
Stand by.

296
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,578
- Tail cone's clear.
- Roger.

297
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,596
Phase one complete.

298
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,516
Tango-Tango,
prepare to receive cable.

299
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,727
Tango-Tango standing by.

300
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,729
Tango-Tango,
what's the turbulence back there?

301
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:02,150
She's all over the place. This thing's
got the response of a 747 at this speed.

302
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:05,946
Sounds like fun. We're streaming the
drogue down. We'll see you in a minute.

303
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,574
Welcoming party's ready.
Good luck.

304
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:12,244
We're moving in to pick up
the drogue now. Tango-Tango out.

305
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,544
I've got it.
Stand by, Kristel.

306
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,546
Standing by.

307
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,800
We're locked on.

308
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:28,969
Into the transfer position.

309
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,262
Check.

310
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,723
Moving into transfer position.

311
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,350
We're closing to 1-4-0 feet.

312
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:39,313
We're closing.
We'll report when in position.

313
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,277
- We're too close to the storm.
- Don't lose your nerve.

314
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,322
All they'll tind is a plane
that went down in the storm.

315
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:51,366
- Hurry up, Travers.
- On my way.

316
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,702
The cases are hooked up
and ready.

317
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:59,541
Charge goes off in tive minutes.
Stick to the plan and you're rich.

318
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,835
Got it.

319
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,505
Tango-Tango in position.

320
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,840
- What's taking so long?
- Patience.

321
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,596
Tango-Tango, dip the plane.
I'm coming over.

322
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,516
Wilco, Five-Lima.
Tango-Tango standing by...

323
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:18,101
at flight level 1-4-0
and steady 2-6-0 degrees.

324
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:23,440
Five-Lima, I'm out ot here.

325
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:24,942
Roger.

326
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,240
What the hell is he doing?

327
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:35,202
Five-Lima, where are the cases?

328
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,754
- Kristel, we've got him.
- Roger.

329
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:48,131
Why didn't you send
the money first?

330
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:52,177
Somehow, I didn't think
you'd wait tor me if I sent it first.

331
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,159
We're approaching the storm tast.
I can't hold this course much longer.

332
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,329
- 9-0 seconds.
- What's keeping him?

333
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,583
Let's move your ass up there.

334
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,420
I'm at the cases.
Stand by.

335
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,422
Tango-Tango standing by.

336
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,923
You tuck.

337
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,474
We've lost the pilot.

338
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,476
- Who did you leave up there?
- No one.

339
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:50,819
Get underneath the jet.
The cases will slide over.

340
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,409
Who the fuck is our guest?

341
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,547
Just get those cases.

342
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:12,591
He's hurt bad.
What should we do with him?

343
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,719
Get him to a hospital, tast.

344
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:23,268
- We're not leveling out.
- 1-0 seconds.

345
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:25,270
I've lost hydraulics!

346
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,205
The cable's blown tree.

347
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,707
Don't unhook it.
The cases are still there.

348
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,168
- Don't lose the money, goddamn it!
- Hold it.

349
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,671
- Pull the cable!
- We gotta pull!

350
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,756
- Bypass switch one.
- Check.

351
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,883
- Bypass switch two.
- Keep pulling.

352
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,010
- Nothing.
- Switch to manual.

353
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,012
Hold the fuckin ' plane steady!

354
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:02,599
- Pull! Come on!
- Travers, don't fuck it up!

355
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:04,977
- How's number one engine?
- Oil pressure falling.

356
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:08,438
- Come on. Don't lose the money.
- They're coming.

357
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,315
Goddamn it! Shit!

358
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:14,695
- We've lost it.
- Oh, fuck!

359
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:17,990
Release the cable.

360
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,786
Close it up.

361
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:29,168
So this is your idea
of a foolproot plan?

362
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:32,546
You stupid bastard.
Kristel, what's the report?

363
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,674
The hydraulics aren't functioning.
He shot them out.

364
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,259
Fire warning, line tour.

365
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:39,553
I'm losing altitude.
We're gonna go down!

366
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,472
Dump the tuel. You'll have to pick
your way through the peaks.

367
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,391
Close the tuel valve and pumps!

368
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:50,105
Don't bother to buckle up.
You may not want to survive this.

369
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:52,858
Flaps to 25 degrees
betore we lose all power.

370
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,943
Flaps, 25 degrees.

371
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,863
Reduce power 60%.
Shut down all generators.

372
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,578
Lower tlaps. You may have
to hand-crank them down.

373
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:15,839
-You want the gear down?
-Leave the gear up. Shut down all power.

374
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:19,384
Give me a hand
with the controls.

375
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,139
Wow! Did you catch that thunder?

376
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,767
That was too loud tor thunder.
Let's rock and roll.

377
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:12,312
One, two, three!

378
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,776
- I'm free!
- Radical, man.

379
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,821
Man, look at me. Watch this.

380
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:32,833
Mike?

381
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:38,881
Shit.

382
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,514
You thought ot everything,
didn't you?

383
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:49,516
Everything except
what's happening now.

384
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,937
Kill the pig!
Your tucking plan almost killed us!

385
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:59,151
Kill the pig, my ass.
We're partners in this.

386
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:00,319
Were.

387
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,363
Give me the tracking monitor.

388
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:05,866
What the hell are you
gonna do with it?

389
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,534
Don't make him ask twice.

390
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:10,204
Give it to him.

391
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,582
You want it? Take it.

392
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,126
It's only got
50,000 code variations.

393
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,378
I'll break your tucking neck
in a minute!

394
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:20,589
- Go ahead. Break my tucking neck!
- Sit down.

395
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,259
In case you slept
through the landing...

396
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:27,221
you'll need all the money you can find
to buy your way out of this country.

397
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,473
You know it,
and I know it.

398
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:32,476
How do we get oft the mountain,
even if we tind it?

399
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,230
Kristel.

400
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,277
I think we found a trequency.

401
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,906
Somebody help, please.

402
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,617
Is there somebody there?
Somebody please help.

403
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,537
Rocky Mountain Rescue. Come in.

404
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,706
Oh, thank God!

405
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,169
Ah, we're stranded.
We were hiking and lost our bearings.

406
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,505
We didn't expect
the weather to come in this fast.

407
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:06,051
Just take it easy.
How many people in your party? Over.

408
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:11,056
Five people.
I don't know where we are.

409
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:16,937
I... I see only a cylinder-type
rock formation. Over.

410
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,647
It's got to be Comb Bluft.

411
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:22,234
Winds are too strong to get a chopper
up there. Try to stay calm.

412
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:24,319
We're on our way.
You're gonna be all right.

413
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:27,781
Please hurry.
Billy's going into shock.

414
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,908
Please, we need insulin.

415
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:32,452
Please, hurry.

416
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,165
"We need insulin."

417
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,087
Would you have thought ot that?

418
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,643
- Thank God you didn't leave.
- Why?

419
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:59,271
Emergency call. Five climbers
are stranded ott Comb Blutf.

420
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:02,524
The weather's pouring in,
and Hal's gone up alone.

421
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,027
- Hal's a good climber.
- What?

422
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,154
What's that supposed to mean?

423
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,781
It means he can handle it himselt.

424
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,037
It he gets socked in by the weather,
they'll never make it down.

425
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,123
Gabe, he needs someone
who has emergency medical training...

426
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:20,209
and knows every handle
to those peaks.

427
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,879
I'm the last one he wants help from, and
that's not what I came back here for.

428
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,673
Our problems are not the issue
right now. Those people are.

429
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:29,510
What it he can't do it alone?

430
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:32,596
Look, Jessie,
I haven't climbed in months.

431
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,473
You just lose the teel.

432
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:37,309
Maybe you mean the nerve.

433
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:45,859
I didn't mean that.

434
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,656
It's okay.

435
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,992
I know you don't want to be responsible
for anybody's lite anymore...

436
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:57,037
but I'm talking about somebody
that was your best triend.

437
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,039
Please, Gabe,
he took the west ridge.

438
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:02,167
It you take the north tace,
you can beat him.

439
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,797
What has happened to you?
Don't you feel anything anymore?

440
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,843
Feel anything?
Jessie, I came back for you.

441
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:12,845
I'm not talking about me.

442
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,847
I'm talking about you.

443
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:19,560
Go ahead... leave.

444
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:23,105
But if you don't do it, you'll be stuck
on that ledge tor the rest of your life.

445
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:50,757
Where the hell is that
goddamn plane?

446
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:53,385
Looks like she went down
in the storm.

447
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:57,139
That storm tront is still building, so
even it we could send a search plane...

448
00:34:57,222 --> 00:35:00,100
it would be impossible
to see anything on the ground.

449
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:03,937
- What about roads?
- There aren't any roads up there.

450
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:05,939
Mr. Wright.

451
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:08,483
These two F. B. I. agents
insist on seeing you.

452
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,236
I'm Agent Hayes.
This is Agent Michaels.

453
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,615
It you're concerned about your agent who
got a ride, I've nothing to tell you.

454
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,786
Matheson wasn't along tor the ride.
He was working surveillance.

455
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,914
Surveillance? Ot what?

456
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:25,250
The Bureau have been getting reports
Treasury jets were being monitored...

457
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,127
between Denver
and San Francisco.

458
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:30,130
We didn't tell you because
we thought it might be an inside job.

459
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:33,550
That's impossible.
You're suggesting a hijacking?

460
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:37,054
No. Not only did I have
my best men on that tlight...

461
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,556
but each one of those cases
were monitored.

462
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,601
And the money
is in unexchangeable denominations.

463
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:45,646
It would be useless
tor anybody to try to steal it.

464
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,481
Except for this man.

465
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:49,942
- Who the hell is this?
- Name is Eric Qualen.

466
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:52,861
We've been tracking him
without much success.

467
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:54,863
He's a former member
ot military intelligence...

468
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,449
who found it more protitable
going to the other side.

469
00:35:57,491 --> 00:36:00,953
Industrial espionage.
Hijacking diamonds trom South Africa.

470
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,997
Thett and disposal ot millions
in negotiable bearer bonds.

471
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:08,585
You name it. He has the international
connections to move this currency...

472
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:12,840
and $100 million otfers one hell
ot a temptation to this psychotic.

473
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:15,175
Jesus Christ.

474
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:45,163
What the hell
are you doing up here, man?

475
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,666
I was talking to Jessie.
She filled me in.

476
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,418
Did she?

477
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,587
Well, now let me till you in.

478
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:57,050
You can take your ass down and go back
to that hole you've been hiding in.

479
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:01,513
Once we get these people down,
I'm gone, Hal.

480
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:04,349
No. You're out ot here now.

481
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:10,314
Why the hell did you come up here?
To prove something?

482
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,816
Look, I know how you teel
about me, all right.

483
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,776
You don't know anything!

484
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:19,489
You did it your way
and she died.

485
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,627
- I did what I thought was right.
- Well, you were wrong.

486
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,087
It was your weight on the line
that did it.

487
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:36,715
There wasn't time
tor anything else.

488
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:38,675
Well, I guess we'll never know.

489
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,761
It was a bad time tor everybody.

490
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,472
What the hell do you know
about bad times, man?

491
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:47,017
You didn't love her, and you didn't
have to explain to her tamily.

492
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,103
And you didn't have to look
into her eyes when she was falling!

493
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,940
- Now drop it!
- No, buddy!

494
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:58,237
It was you who dropped it.

495
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,623
You want to do it?

496
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:11,291
Do it.

497
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,465
You live with it.

498
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,957
They're here.

499
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,042
Right on time.

500
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:56,879
How many of them are there?

501
00:38:56,962 --> 00:39:00,924
We got two heroes.
We'll greet 'em at the top.

502
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:11,393
- Where's the helicopter?
- What the hell's going on?

503
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:18,942
- Where's the helicopter?
- It can't tly in this weather.

504
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:22,029
- Is either of you a chopper pilot?
- No.

505
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,406
What are your names?

506
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,491
Tucker and Walker.

507
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:28,410
We're missing three bags.

508
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,078
What's in them?

509
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:31,538
None ot your tucking business!

510
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:36,543
Suits, socks, $100 million,
the usual stutf.

511
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:39,505
Travers here was smart enough
to bring along a tracking device.

512
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,840
Don't use my name, goddamn it.

513
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:52,226
Key it.

514
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,731
Look at the map. This is where
we've lost our belongings.

515
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,567
The red dots on the monitor
are the three cases.

516
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:03,237
You recognize these locations?

517
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:08,075
Let me jar your memory.

518
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,327
It you don't recognize them,
you're useless.

519
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,330
Useless items
are usually discarded.

520
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:16,500
- Right, Travers?
- Get oft my back, Qualen.

521
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:18,961
Oft?

522
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:22,422
I haven't even got on it yet.

523
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:27,135
Once again, do you recognize
these locations?

524
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:34,643
Ryan.

525
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:44,361
Yeah. We do.

526
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,154
Then let's go.

527
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,579
Wait a minute, asshole!

528
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,458
Where is it?

529
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,258
Up there.

530
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:12,264
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.
Hal? Come in, Hal.

531
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:15,142
Nice. You're Hal?

532
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,146
You, stay. You!

533
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:23,483
Fetch.

534
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,327
Fetch!

535
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,953
Do it.

536
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,170
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.

537
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:45,422
Do you copy?

538
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:49,176
Hal, come in.
Hal, come in. Over.

539
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:02,314
Watch yourself under the overhang.
It could deliver anytime.

540
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:05,984
Anytime you teel
like saying something, don't.

541
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:08,278
We're waiting, gentlemen.

542
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,489
- I need my bolt gun and ice ax.
- No.

543
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:13,617
- Don't give him anything.
- Take his coat tor insurance.

544
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:16,870
He could treeze to death!

545
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:19,540
You've got your own problems, Hal.

546
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:27,548
Ryan, get a rope.
I want this dog on a leash too.

547
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:33,011
Tie it. It better hold.

548
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:44,940
Forget me.
It you can, get away.

549
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,608
Would you?

550
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,738
Go tetch, wonder dog.

551
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:16,054
Move it, Walker.

552
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:22,769
Keep it taut.
Ryan, keep it taut!

553
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:29,401
Hal, come in please.
Hal, come in please. Over.

554
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:56,261
I don't trust him.

555
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:32,089
Damn.

556
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,514
I don't think
we need two guides.

557
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:44,184
Retire him when he comes down.

558
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:47,771
They're going to kill you!
Don't come down!

559
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:49,940
Pull the rope. Pull the rope!

560
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:55,028
Pull, goddamn it! Pull!

561
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,911
- Come on! Pull!
- Pull it!

562
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,624
Pull, goddamn it!

563
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:09,293
Ow!

564
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,186
Watch it!

565
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:30,689
- Get him!
- No!

566
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:32,399
Do it.

567
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:56,608
Your triend just had
the most expensive tuneral in history.

568
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,861
Now it's only you.

569
00:46:58,944 --> 00:47:01,446
Come in, Rescue Unit. Come in.

570
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,741
Hal, what's going on? Hal?

571
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:06,326
Talk.

572
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:09,329
No messages, no codes,
no tricks.

573
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:12,541
You haven't tound us.
It was a take call.

574
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,752
Jessie, I've just reached
the top ot the tower.

575
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:18,172
So far,
there's no sign of anyone.

576
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:20,674
Looks like a phony call. Over.

577
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:24,761
You've got to be kidding me. Do you
want me to fly up atter you? Over.

578
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,264
No. Negative.
The winds are still too high.

579
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:29,683
I'm going to ride out
the storm up here.

580
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:32,811
We'll take shelter
at the old Doug...

581
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:34,521
Hal, I'm losing you.
Come in.

582
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,732
Come in, Hal. Over.

583
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:39,651
Go on to the next case.

584
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:46,158
He said the tower,
but he's on Comb Blutf.

585
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,494
Frank, tly me to the west valley.
The winds are never too strong there.

586
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:51,914
It's only a half-hour climb
to the Douglas Shaft.

587
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:54,374
It's the only shelter around.
Hal would have to go there.

588
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:58,045
- Jessie, that is a bad idea.
- Please, Frank.

589
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:01,131
If I don't tind him,
you can come pick me up by nightfall.

590
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:03,258
Hal would have my head.

591
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:06,220
And it's such a handsome head.

592
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:10,891
Please, Frank.

593
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:13,227
I'll buy one ot your paintings.

594
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:24,530
Hold up!

595
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:29,326
Where is it?

596
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:37,584
There. On top ot the peak.

597
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:39,419
- Come on.
- Hold it.

598
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,632
Looks like a winding route to me.

599
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:48,804
The tastest way is
straight up the east tace.

600
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:51,932
Ot course, there are only 12 guys
in the world who could do it.

601
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:53,642
You want to try it?

602
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:41,166
Gabe. What's happened?

603
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,127
Oh, my God. You're trozen.
Come sit down.

604
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:48,298
Gabe, where's your pack, your sweater?
Talk to me. What happened?

605
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:49,842
They got Hal.

606
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:52,511
The distress call was a fake.

607
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:56,390
Fake? What do you mean
it was fake?

608
00:50:56,473 --> 00:51:00,310
Betore they crashed,
they dumped cases of money.

609
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:02,396
- Who's they?
- I don't know.

610
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:05,858
They're using Hal to tind it.
When they do, he's dead.

611
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:08,735
You gotta get on the radio
and call Frank...

612
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:12,656
and tell him to call
the state police.

613
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:15,659
The cold killed my radio,
but Frank's gonna be looking tor me.

614
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,412
- We'll contact them from the chopper.
- The sun goes down in an hour.

615
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:20,414
What do you want me to do?

616
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,917
Let's take everything we need.
Let's move.

617
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:26,378
We got to get to that next case
before they do.

618
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,427
We're close!

619
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:36,430
- It's just up there!
- It better be.

620
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:41,476
You know something? I'm getting
real tucking tired of your threats.

621
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,145
Are you?

622
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:22,226
It's there.

623
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:37,658
Oh, my God.
What do we do now?

624
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,284
You got a pencil?

625
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,996
Over here.

626
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,352
Goddamn.

627
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:51,857
The son of a bitch
is still alive!

628
00:53:57,988 --> 00:54:00,407
I'm beginning to dislike
this Mr. Walker.

629
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:05,412
He can't be tar.
Find him. Go.

630
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:29,311
Go.

631
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:10,310
Come on.

632
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:26,326
Give me a flare.

633
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,830
- Meet me at Eagle's Cape.
- I'm not leaving.

634
00:55:29,872 --> 00:55:31,832
Don't worry about me!

635
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:54,164
Gravity's a bitch, isn't it?

636
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:56,583
Fuck the money, and fuck you!

637
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:59,169
I wasn't born to die
on a mountain.

638
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:01,547
Where were you born to die?
Got a place picked out?

639
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:04,258
I don't need to hear
that shit trom you, boy.

640
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:07,177
Maybe this boy should make
this big mouth bigger.

641
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:09,263
Stop this!

642
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:12,099
The tight's not here.
It's out there.

643
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,188
Find us some shelter.

644
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:29,157
Next time you're, like,
watching MTV, you know...

645
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:32,619
take a split second
and flip it to the Weather Channel.

646
00:57:32,661 --> 00:57:35,664
I mean, hey, where would you
rather be right now?

647
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:39,042
Here in tent city, or at home
playing some righteous air hockey?

648
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:41,044
Air hockey's definitely
got my vote.

649
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:44,047
Exactly, cheesehead,
exactly.

650
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:46,049
- Cheesehead?
- Cheesehead.

651
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:53,724
- He was here.
- What was in there?

652
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:55,934
Answer the man.

653
00:57:56,018 --> 00:57:59,313
- Nothing. Just tourist souvenirs.
- Or equipment.

654
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:02,274
Maybe Walker plans
to look atter his friend here.

655
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:04,318
He's not my triend...

656
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:07,654
and I don't like him
any more than I do you.

657
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:09,865
Nice try.

658
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:13,702
But I never underestimate the power
ot loyalty when it comes naturally.

659
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:17,748
Not like the kind
that has to be paid tor.

660
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:20,626
Make a tire.

661
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:26,465
It costs a fortune
to heat this place.

662
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,969
That's bad humor, I know.

663
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:42,022
We better get some sleep.
We're gonna need it.

664
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,955
Rescue units, come in.

665
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:01,083
Again, do you read? Come in.

666
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:04,378
What the hell
is going on up there?

667
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:05,712
Hal.

668
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:08,757
Jessie, do you read?

669
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:12,469
Jessie. It looks as if
we're drawing a crowd.

670
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:15,514
We're down to a tew hours before
the whole tucking world shows up.

671
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:17,558
- Where's the next one?
- On the tower.

672
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,059
How far?

673
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:23,230
He asked how far, goddamn it!

674
00:59:23,272 --> 00:59:27,484
You know what I think? I think
you've been taking the scenic route.

675
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:29,695
How far is it?

676
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:31,780
Halt a day.

677
00:59:31,864 --> 00:59:35,242
- It's half a day.
- Hey, Hal!

678
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:38,996
Check it out, man. It's Hal.
Hey, man, you stuck up here too?

679
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,623
- You missed a great jump yesterday.
- Walk over.

680
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:44,334
For Christ's sakes, man,
they're just kids.

681
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:47,337
- Why don't you let them go?
- We're not animals.

682
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:50,549
Don't torce us to be.
Walk over.

683
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:54,678
Hey, man, was that storm
a real bummer or what?

684
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:56,680
Me and him were
in tent city last night.

685
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:59,558
- Yeah.
- Hey, Hal.

686
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,644
We're gonna take one last jump
and split.

687
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:04,438
You baby-sitting hikers?

688
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:09,067
- Run, man, run!
- What?

689
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:10,736
Get the hell out...

690
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,892
Son of a bitch.
You didn't have to kill him!

691
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:43,435
Shut up!

692
01:00:44,603 --> 01:00:46,355
Sue me.

693
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,068
Fuck.

694
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:23,308
Shoot him!

695
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:26,103
Shoot him!

696
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:29,022
You're letting him get away!
Shoot him!

697
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,670
Shit. Ow!

698
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,051
You murdering motherfuck.

699
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:01,388
Kill a tew people,
they call you a murderer.

700
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:05,517
Kill a million,
and you're a conqueror.

701
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:07,394
Go tigure.

702
01:02:07,477 --> 01:02:10,647
Move on, Tucker.
Time is short.

703
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:59,029
Okay. Just like you said.

704
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:01,573
He's taking them the long way around.

705
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:04,576
To stay ahead ot them, we're gonna
have to go through that crack.

706
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:10,415
You said there was a way across.

707
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:11,834
There is.

708
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:13,710
- Where the tuck is it?
- There.

709
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,212
You blind?

710
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:21,134
Hell with the money.
Radio the chopper.

711
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:25,055
You just don't get it, do you?

712
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:29,351
We're in bed now, joined at the hip,
partners in crime.

713
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:35,482
You've crossed over, Travers,
and there's no crossing back.

714
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:00,382
All right,
that'll keep it dry.

715
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:10,851
Okay, let's do it.

716
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,982
Get a good tooting.

717
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:20,569
Okay.

718
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,619
It's slick, Jess.

719
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:34,124
Good foothold.

720
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:09,701
Jessie, don't move.

721
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,248
Oh, my God.

722
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:18,710
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

723
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:22,965
Jessie, you gotta get down!

724
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,466
Come on!

725
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:27,594
Get down!

726
01:05:29,513 --> 01:05:30,681
Stay close to me.

727
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:37,396
All right, get down.

728
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:38,689
Hold on to me.

729
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:42,484
It's on my back!

730
01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:51,410
Let's get out!

731
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:55,998
It's otf your back.
There's nothing on your back.

732
01:05:56,081 --> 01:05:57,541
It's okay.

733
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,174
Rocky Mountain Rescue Center,
this is Rescue 3. Over.

734
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:09,386
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Go ahead.

735
01:06:10,554 --> 01:06:13,557
The vis is good. I've got
at least 20 miles in all directions.

736
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,435
If anyone's out here,
I'll find them. Over.

737
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:18,478
Roger, 3. Center out.

738
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:31,909
Center, this is 3.

739
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:35,412
I've picked up a signal on the thermal
imager just north of Comb Bluff.

740
01:06:35,495 --> 01:06:37,456
Landing to investigate.

741
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:27,589
Get out! Get out ot here!

742
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:31,760
Get the hell out!

743
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:37,766
Jesus Christ.

744
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:44,439
Here, I got you.
I got you.

745
01:07:44,523 --> 01:07:47,609
I got you, son. I got you.

746
01:07:47,693 --> 01:07:50,112
There's the opening.

747
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:53,031
When I get up there,
I'll hook up the line...

748
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:54,867
and you tollow me up.

749
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:57,452
- Okay?
- All right.

750
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:09,298
- The other one is tollowing.
- I'll move to a high point, tlank him.

751
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:11,758
Don't kill him
until you get the money.

752
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:13,260
Sure.

753
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:21,226
Mr. Wright, we found the I. D.
on the dead pilot.

754
01:08:21,268 --> 01:08:23,437
He was known to fly for Qualen.
Over.

755
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,814
What about the Treasury jet?
Over.

756
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:27,900
Its wreckage is scattered
over a two-mile area.

757
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:30,277
No bodies have been found.
Over.

758
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:34,364
Finally. An F. A. A. satellite
has located a downed aircraft.

759
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:38,452
Head 110 miles south-southwest
ot the park entrance.

760
01:08:39,244 --> 01:08:41,872
Treasury Control, get
the rescue people on their way.

761
01:08:41,955 --> 01:08:44,291
We're headed straight there.
One out.

762
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:45,751
Center out.

763
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:13,362
I got it, Jess.

764
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:16,114
We're almost out.
I can chop through.

765
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:45,727
Jessie, come on up!

766
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:47,229
Okay!

767
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:54,862
Walker.

768
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:57,656
Small world, ain't it?

769
01:09:57,739 --> 01:09:59,783
Don't even think about it.

770
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:03,287
Your lite's on sale, Walker.

771
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,122
The price is 30 million.

772
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:07,916
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

773
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:12,004
What the tuck are you talking about?
Where's the money?

774
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:14,923
I burned it.
Never could save anything.

775
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:19,803
Not even a dumb mountain boy like you
would burn $30 million.

776
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:23,307
I don't make deals, Walker,
but I'll make one with you.

777
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:26,935
Hand over the money, and I'll
just kill you and not the girl.

778
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:29,730
Give me the money!

779
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:35,652
Gabe?

780
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:38,864
All right.

781
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:57,841
Come on. Come on!

782
01:10:57,925 --> 01:10:59,384
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

783
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,470
Kynette, what's going on?
Where's the money?

784
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:05,557
- He said he torched it.
- Where is he now?

785
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,226
He dropped down into some cave.

786
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:10,187
You've had your chance.
Move it out now.

787
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,064
- Kristel, get the C-4.
- Roger.

788
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:14,107
Just give me five minutes.

789
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:16,944
I said get the fuck out of there.

790
01:11:17,027 --> 01:11:20,197
Good. And blow up that black bastard
while you're at it.

791
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,824
Save me the time
ot doing it meselt.

792
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:45,430
It you want me, I'll be here!

793
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:52,980
I'm in here!

794
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,994
I'm in here.

795
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,667
You're making it too easy tor me.

796
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:39,818
No bullets, bitch!

797
01:12:49,328 --> 01:12:52,956
Now, I'm gonna ask you just three times:
where's the money?

798
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:57,920
Sissy.

799
01:12:58,003 --> 01:12:59,588
You hit like a sissy.

800
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:05,052
Wrong answer, motherfucker!

801
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:09,473
Get up!

802
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:12,518
Now, I'm gonna ask you
tor a second time.

803
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:15,062
Where is the money?

804
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:18,106
Burned it.

805
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,150
Wrong answer!

806
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:31,620
Time to kill a mountain man.

807
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:40,629
It amazes me, in this day and age,
when a man...

808
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:42,756
will put money...

809
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,092
before the personal safety...

810
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:48,387
ot himselt and his bitch.

811
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:55,310
At least you can go
to your grave knowing...

812
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:57,688
that I'm gonna treat the bitch...

813
01:13:58,772 --> 01:14:00,399
right!

814
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:22,421
Are you okay? Oh, God!
I thought he killed you!

815
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,466
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

816
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:32,556
Hal, Jessie, do you read?

817
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:34,766
Again, do you read?
Come in.

818
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:38,979
Hal, Jessie, what the hell's
goin' on up there?

819
01:14:39,062 --> 01:14:41,315
Jessie, find it.

820
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:56,121
It's ready.

821
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:59,750
Rescue 1, Rescue 2.

822
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,294
- Do you copy? Over.
- Here it is!

823
01:15:03,128 --> 01:15:05,422
I found Evan in the east valley.

824
01:15:05,506 --> 01:15:07,424
He's got a gunshot wound
in the back.

825
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:11,053
He's en route to the medical center
in Granby in critical condition.

826
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:14,765
In case you can hear this,
I'm resuming my search.

827
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:16,016
Come on!

828
01:15:18,644 --> 01:15:21,480
You'll make somebody
a tine wite someday.

829
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:25,567
You should see me bake a cake.

830
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:42,751
He's still alive,
tor another four minutes.

831
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:45,712
- Where's it set?
- Primed to go oft right over his head.

832
01:15:46,588 --> 01:15:48,674
Fuck!

833
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:52,386
Gabe, three minutes!
There's a bomb!

834
01:15:52,469 --> 01:15:55,889
Get the hell out of there!
There's a bomb over your head!

835
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:01,186
Jessie, get the gear!

836
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:10,612
Come on, Jessie. This way.

837
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:13,490
That charge is gonna cause a landslide.
We gotta get to the west tace.

838
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:19,621
Why the hell are we wasting time?

839
01:16:19,705 --> 01:16:22,541
Making sure he's not
going to tind that last case.

840
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:29,256
You want to kill me,
don't you, Tucker?

841
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:32,843
Well, take a number
and get in line.

842
01:16:37,556 --> 01:16:40,642
The ledge is too far. Take this rope
and pull it apart and tie it together.

843
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:42,936
- We're gonna rappel down.
- This rope is 60 years old.

844
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,855
- Will it hold?
- Don't think so.

845
01:16:44,938 --> 01:16:46,064
Bad answer.

846
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:02,998
Frank! Frank!

847
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,586
- No, Frank!
- He can't see you.

848
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:09,588
Go!

849
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:28,065
Here comes our ride. Move.

850
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:32,361
Okay, now, swing as hard
as you can. Push!

851
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:21,410
Jump.

852
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:20,969
Frank! Frank! Frank!

853
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:58,131
What's happening here?
Where's the rest of the group?

854
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,426
Welcome.

855
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:03,011
What are you doing?

856
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:04,847
Now, back oft!

857
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:08,058
I came here to help you.

858
01:20:08,141 --> 01:20:10,185
You did.

859
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:11,979
Don't move.

860
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:18,443
- Frank! Frank!
- Better hurry, Tucker.

861
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:22,030
Get out ot here!

862
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:47,014
You stupid maniac!

863
01:20:47,097 --> 01:20:50,475
- No one told you to shoot.
- We've wasted enough time.

864
01:20:50,517 --> 01:20:51,977
Frank?

865
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:08,452
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

866
01:21:15,626 --> 01:21:18,128
This man never hurt anybody!

867
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:21,590
Touching.

868
01:21:21,673 --> 01:21:24,051
Kristel, check the chopper.
Let's go.

869
01:21:52,246 --> 01:21:54,206
Get back! Get back!

870
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:57,125
Go! Jessie, run!

871
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:18,021
That son ot a bitch.

872
01:22:19,731 --> 01:22:23,485
All right. We use a chopper
to locate the third case.

873
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:26,446
- Then we get the hell out of here.
- No.

874
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:28,657
There's not enough fuel
to search around.

875
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,617
Just enough to get us down.

876
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:33,036
You're not running things,
Travers.

877
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:37,040
As soon as he tinds the money,
you're as dead as me.

878
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:41,753
Give me the monitor.

879
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:43,213
Now.

880
01:22:56,351 --> 01:23:00,147
- What's the code, Travers?
- I told you, Qualen.

881
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:03,483
Fitty thousand possible
key code combinations...

882
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:05,485
in 15-second intervals.

883
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,864
So, what's the fucking code?

884
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:18,415
Well, look
what Agent Travers tound.

885
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,417
I guess he is running things
atter all.

886
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:22,461
Isn't he?

887
01:23:24,213 --> 01:23:27,257
So what's the plan, Travers?
We use the chopper to find the money.

888
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:28,425
Right?

889
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:32,221
What a good idea.

890
01:23:32,304 --> 01:23:34,890
But then again...

891
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:37,851
without a pilot...

892
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:40,354
nobody even gets otf
this mountain.

893
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,607
What are you doing, Eric?

894
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,070
Do you know what
real love is, Kristel?

895
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:53,116
Sacritice.

896
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:08,006
Now I'm the only one
who can tly us out of here.

897
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:10,217
We're partners again.

898
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:14,179
Now, take your toy...

899
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:16,557
and tind our money.

900
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:20,519
Radio when you tind it.

901
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:24,648
I'm waiting here.

902
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:35,993
All right, the last of the money's
at Crockett River.

903
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:38,328
If we take the northern ridge,
we can get there tirst.

904
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:42,249
There is no "we." I'm gonna go along
the north trail to Bitker Ladder.

905
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:44,334
You go on to the station
tor help.

906
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:47,880
- Are you crazy?
- It they tind the money, Hal's dead.

907
01:24:47,963 --> 01:24:50,132
- Just get back there tast.
- All right.

908
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:53,886
Roger, Control. But where the hell
are those National Guard choppers?

909
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:56,138
They had a mechanical, sir.
It's being worked on now.

910
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:59,391
- Their E. T. A. is one hour.
- An hour?

911
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:02,352
You got to do better than that.
Now, get a move on. Out.

912
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:29,147
Stop there.

913
01:26:32,985 --> 01:26:34,987
We're close.

914
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,823
I got it locked in.

915
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:41,118
So we're finished
with him, yeah?

916
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:43,662
Yeah. Do it quietly.

917
01:26:43,745 --> 01:26:46,081
Your insane boss
just made enough noise...

918
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:48,792
tor anyone within ten miles
to hear us.

919
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:53,714
It's been fun.

920
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:01,054
Hey, Delmar.

921
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:04,808
From me to you...

922
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:07,352
you're an asshole.

923
01:27:07,436 --> 01:27:08,937
Yeah?

924
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:11,899
And you're a loudmouth,
punk slag...

925
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:14,526
who's about to die.

926
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:15,694
Maybe.

927
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:20,282
But in a minute I'll be dead.

928
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:22,242
You...

929
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:24,161
will always be an asshole.

930
01:27:24,244 --> 01:27:27,289
So go ahead and shoot.

931
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:29,124
I'm getting cold.

932
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:34,713
Shoot!

933
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,717
Who's shooting?

934
01:27:44,806 --> 01:27:46,391
Tell me...

935
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:48,727
do you like soccer?

936
01:27:48,769 --> 01:27:50,312
It's a great sport.

937
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:55,192
I was a tucking good striker.
Isn't that something?

938
01:28:05,786 --> 01:28:08,413
Oh, God!

939
01:28:08,455 --> 01:28:09,790
Fuck you!

940
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:11,917
Ah, you're swearing now.

941
01:28:13,502 --> 01:28:16,922
That's a penalty kick
tor unsportsmanlike.

942
01:28:22,094 --> 01:28:23,470
A lovely little chip shot.

943
01:28:26,056 --> 01:28:28,851
He dribbles past one detender...

944
01:28:28,934 --> 01:28:31,270
two detenders...

945
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:32,771
three detenders.

946
01:28:40,529 --> 01:28:42,698
Striker lines up
at the penalty spot.

947
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:44,908
He focuses on the ball.

948
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:46,910
The crowd is on its teet.

949
01:28:46,994 --> 01:28:49,454
Striker moves to his lett.

950
01:28:49,496 --> 01:28:51,748
He draws back his foot.

951
01:28:51,832 --> 01:28:53,125
He comes in.

952
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:15,147
Season's over, asshole!

953
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:25,657
I said quietly.

954
01:29:57,648 --> 01:30:00,192
What the fuck is going on?

955
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:04,196
This is not right.

956
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,212
Fuck!

957
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,732
Goddamn.

958
01:30:40,816 --> 01:30:43,193
Fuck you, Walker!

959
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:49,157
Fucker!

960
01:30:57,291 --> 01:30:59,376
Goddamn it!

961
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:05,090
Come in, goddamn it.

962
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:09,303
Have you got what we need?

963
01:31:09,344 --> 01:31:12,764
It's Walker. The son of a bitch
is still alive, Qualen.

964
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:14,766
No names.
This is an open line.

965
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:17,352
I don't give a shit,
Eric Qualen!

966
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:20,981
Had to be insane to tie up...

967
01:31:21,023 --> 01:31:24,109
with a lowlife piece of shit
like you anyway.

968
01:31:24,151 --> 01:31:25,277
They beat us.

969
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:30,407
A couple of fucking
mountain rangers beat us.

970
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:34,369
Jesus Christ, that's Travers.
Get a bead on that trequency.

971
01:31:34,453 --> 01:31:37,748
They beat the man
no law agency ever could.

972
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:39,082
Get ott the radio.

973
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:42,085
And I'm finding that
pretty tuckin' hilarious, Qualen.

974
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:44,379
Stop transmitting,
you stupid bastard!

975
01:31:44,463 --> 01:31:47,466
It's hard to believe I sold out
atter 20 years...

976
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:50,010
and this is my payback?

977
01:31:50,052 --> 01:31:53,555
To run on a mountain
with a tuckin' dirtbag like you!

978
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:55,766
Travers, you've lost your mind.

979
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:59,061
Lost it. Have I lost it?

980
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:02,856
Fuckin' A, I've lost it, Qualen!
Pure, fuckin' section eight!

981
01:32:04,816 --> 01:32:06,902
I gotta go.

982
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:09,696
I'm on my last otticial manhunt.

983
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:12,699
Adios, mothertucker!

984
01:32:20,499 --> 01:32:22,543
You got a bearing
on that trequency yet?

985
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:26,463
Yes. Eight minutes away.

986
01:32:44,731 --> 01:32:46,692
You're dead, Walker!

987
01:33:42,456 --> 01:33:43,624
Frank!

988
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:23,682
I won, Walker!

989
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:43,410
Gabe!

990
01:36:05,807 --> 01:36:07,768
Travers, come in.

991
01:36:12,898 --> 01:36:16,276
Compliments of Delmar.
Too late. You missed him.

992
01:36:16,318 --> 01:36:18,904
He decided to take a swim
to Arizona.

993
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:21,865
- Tucker.
- That's right.

994
01:36:22,783 --> 01:36:24,952
Congratulations.

995
01:36:25,035 --> 01:36:26,119
Qualen?

996
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:29,373
It's all over.

997
01:36:29,456 --> 01:36:32,584
Walker. You resilient bastard.

998
01:36:32,626 --> 01:36:35,337
So you're still alive.

999
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:37,548
I want that money,
and I want it now.

1000
01:36:37,631 --> 01:36:40,092
Qualen, the game's over.

1001
01:36:40,133 --> 01:36:41,260
You lost.

1002
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:44,471
Oh, no. The game's
just getting interesting.

1003
01:36:44,555 --> 01:36:46,515
I'm airborne now, you see.

1004
01:36:48,225 --> 01:36:51,019
As a matter of tact,
I've picked up a passenger...

1005
01:36:51,103 --> 01:36:52,813
you might be interested in.

1006
01:36:55,148 --> 01:36:57,109
Go on, talk.

1007
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:59,403
I said talk, goddamn it!

1008
01:37:01,405 --> 01:37:04,241
Hal, he's got me. I'm sorry.
I thought he was Frank.

1009
01:37:04,324 --> 01:37:06,410
You get the picture, Walker?

1010
01:37:06,493 --> 01:37:08,996
Now, I want that money.

1011
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:11,957
Meet me at the highest point
trom where you are.

1012
01:37:11,999 --> 01:37:14,710
It you don't,
we're going to find out...

1013
01:37:14,793 --> 01:37:17,671
it this little angel of yours
can fly.

1014
01:37:18,881 --> 01:37:21,550
Jessie, take him to the highest point
near Bitker Ladder.

1015
01:37:21,633 --> 01:37:24,720
I'll meet you there.
Don't worry.

1016
01:37:24,803 --> 01:37:26,972
Love's a killer, isn't it?

1017
01:37:42,529 --> 01:37:45,741
- Where are you, Walker?
- You're getting warmer. Keep climbing.

1018
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:48,911
You're getting closer.

1019
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:50,954
Look out.

1020
01:38:08,764 --> 01:38:11,350
I must admit,
you're a real piece of work.

1021
01:38:11,433 --> 01:38:14,186
Yeah, and I must admit,
you're a real piece of shit.

1022
01:38:24,363 --> 01:38:26,323
Throw it up, or I'll kill her.

1023
01:38:26,406 --> 01:38:29,409
You do, and the cash is gone.

1024
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:33,163
- The money.
- I want you to put her down.

1025
01:38:33,247 --> 01:38:34,665
Over there!

1026
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:30,179
Jessie, run!

1027
01:39:30,262 --> 01:39:32,472
- What about you?
- Run!

1028
01:39:33,807 --> 01:39:35,225
Run!

1029
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:38,353
Come on, Qualen.

1030
01:39:38,437 --> 01:39:41,607
I got what you want.
Come on.

1031
01:39:49,531 --> 01:39:51,992
Come on. Come and get it.

1032
01:39:56,914 --> 01:39:58,832
Come on. Closer.

1033
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:02,336
Come on, closer.

1034
01:40:02,377 --> 01:40:04,630
- A little closer, Qualen.
- Throw it in.

1035
01:40:04,671 --> 01:40:06,590
Bring it closer.

1036
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:08,800
Oh, my God.

1037
01:40:16,099 --> 01:40:17,684
Throw it in.

1038
01:40:34,826 --> 01:40:36,787
Damn you, Walker!

1039
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:54,638
Run!

1040
01:41:33,844 --> 01:41:36,388
Jessie, move!

1041
01:41:47,274 --> 01:41:48,400
Come on.

1042
01:42:28,357 --> 01:42:31,693
It's just us now,
you piece of shit.

1043
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,919
Watch out!

1044
01:42:49,002 --> 01:42:50,963
Get out of there, man!

1045
01:42:54,967 --> 01:42:56,635
Stick around.

1046
01:43:00,347 --> 01:43:01,682
We had a deal...

1047
01:43:01,765 --> 01:43:04,226
and now we've
just got each other.

1048
01:43:05,435 --> 01:43:07,604
You're not atraid to die.

1049
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:14,403
Come on, get him!

1050
01:43:20,033 --> 01:43:20,784
Get out ot there!

1051
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:23,328
Remember, shithead.

1052
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:25,998
Keep your arms and legs
in the vehicle...

1053
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:27,749
at all times!

1054
01:43:48,395 --> 01:43:50,397
Give me the rope!

1055
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:55,694
Okay.

1056
01:43:59,615 --> 01:44:01,033
I'm out ot here.

1057
01:44:23,889 --> 01:44:27,976
Gabe, buddy, you think you could have
put a little less eftort in that climb?

1058
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:30,729
I mean,
I thought you were in shape.

1059
01:44:32,105 --> 01:44:34,107
- I guess I'm just talling apart.
- Yeah.

1060
01:44:34,191 --> 01:44:35,901
This is Agent Wright. Copy?

1061
01:44:35,943 --> 01:44:39,655
- Yeah, copy.
- Please identify yourselves. Over.

1062
01:44:39,738 --> 01:44:42,324
Yeah, this is Hal Tucker,
Rocky Mountain Rescue.

1063
01:44:42,407 --> 01:44:45,077
Hey, we're glad
to see you guys.

1064
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:47,079
If you're looking
for Mr. Qualen...

1065
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:50,207
try about 4,000 feet
south of here.

1066
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,960
He'll be the one
wearing a helicopter. Over.

1067
01:44:53,043 --> 01:44:54,545
Good.

1068
01:44:54,628 --> 01:44:59,007
I'll arrange transportation for the
three of you. Sit tight for a while.
