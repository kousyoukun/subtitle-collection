1
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,111
In the first world war, and for the
first time, in the history of man,

2
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:15,596
nations combined to fight against nations,
using the crude weapons of those days.

3
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:19,141
The second world war
involved every continent on the globe,

4
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,516
and men turned to science
for new devices of warfare,

5
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:26,474
which reached an unparalleled peak
in their capacity for destruction.

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,444
And now, fought with the terrible
weapons of super science,

7
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:35,321
menacing all mankind and every creature
on earth, comes...

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:41,493
The war of the worlds

9
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,642
No one would have believed
in the middle of the 20th century,

10
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,348
that human affairs
were being watched keenly and closely

11
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,605
by intelligences greater than man's.

12
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,563
Yet., across the Gulf of space,
on the planet, Mars,

13
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,740
intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic

14
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,819
regarded our earth with envious eyes,

15
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,997
slowly and surely,
drawing their plans against us.

16
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:11,082
Mars is more than 140 million miles
from the sun,

17
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:15,041
and for centuries, it has been
in the last stages of exhaustion.

18
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:19,136
At night, temperatures
drop far below zero,

19
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,258
even at its equator.

20
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,466
The inhabitants of this dying planet

21
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,218
looked across space
with instruments and intelligences

22
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,055
of which we have scarcely dreamed,

23
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,233
searching for another world
to which they could migrate.

24
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,362
They could not go to pluto,
outermost of all the planets,

25
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,362
and so cold, that its atmosphere
lies frozen on its surface.

26
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,491
They couldn't go to Neptune or uranus,

27
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:49,492
twin worlds in eternal night
and perpetual cold,

28
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,293
both surrounded by
an unbreathable atmosphere

29
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,963
of methane gas and ammonia vapor.

30
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,550
The martians considered saturn,

31
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:03,677
an attractive world with its many moons
and beautiful rings of cosmic dust,

32
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:09,387
but its temperature is close
to 270 degrees below zero,

33
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:14,100
and ice lies 15,000 miles
deep on its surface.

34
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,651
Their nearest world was giant Jupiter,

35
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,692
where there are Titanic cliffs
of lava and ice,

36
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,445
with hydrogen flaming at the tops,

37
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,993
where the atmospheric pressure
is terrible,

38
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,197
thousands of pounds to the square inch.

39
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,031
They couldn't go there.

40
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,494
Nor could they go to Mercury,
nearest planet to the sun.

41
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,169
It has no air,

42
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,546
and the temperature at its equator
is that of molten lead.

43
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,756
Of all the worlds,

44
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,886
that the intelligences on Mars
could see and study,

45
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,846
only our own warm earth

46
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,722
was green with vegetation,
bright with water,

47
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:57,150
and possessed a cloudy atmosphere
eloquent of fertility.

48
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:03,111
It did not occur to mankind that
a swift fate might be hanging over us,

49
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,159
or that from the blackness of outer space,

50
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,784
we were being scrutinized and studied,

51
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,742
until at the time of our nearest approach

52
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,794
to the orbit of Mars,
during a pleasant summer season...

53
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,144
- Is that a fireball, or something?
- Boy, that's big!

54
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,595
Maybe it's a comet.

55
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,270
Boy, that had me scared.

56
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,476
I wonder where it lit.

57
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,549
- Miles away, I bet you.
- Hey, let's go find it, huh?

58
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,134
That probably dropped halfway to pomona.

59
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,900
- It was nearer than that.
- I'm gonna see. Who's coming?

60
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:51,622
- This is pine summit. I got a smoke.
- 160, 30.

61
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,117
Azimuth reading: 160 degrees, 30 minutes.

62
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:00,506
Big? I'll bet it's as big as anything
that ever lit in California.

63
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,925
You better get something over there.
It's started a Blaze already.

64
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,350
Over here. Hey, let's go this way.

65
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,973
You there, with the shovel!

66
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,658
Let me get in there!

67
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Out of the way! Out of the way!

68
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,452
Bring that hose over here!

69
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,126
We're getting it licked, fellas.
Keep at it.

70
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,999
Hey, grab this.

71
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,372
Joe, Joe, lend a hand over here.

72
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,631
Number three to d.O. Number three to d.O.

73
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,045
D.o. To number three, come in.

74
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,466
We're getting this under control.
We won't need any more help. Over.

75
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,933
Okay. Send the tanker in,

76
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,725
but you can stand by
until that thing cools off. Over.

77
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,102
I think somebody ought
to check on it. Over.

78
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,309
Well, there's some fellows
fishing at pine summit.

79
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,894
I think they're scientists.

80
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:08,073
They probably saw it come down.
I'll let 'em know. What's it look like?

81
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,902
Can't get near enough
to see it very well. It's too hot.

82
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,028
But it's a whale of a size.

83
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,456
I got a message for you.

84
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,208
You're the guys
from pacific tech, ain't you?

85
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,339
Right.

86
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,463
Looks like the fishing was good.

87
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,219
Have some?

88
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,888
It's about that meteor.

89
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,266
They say it's a whopper.

90
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,864
The district officer phoned us
at the lookout up on the summit.

91
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,649
I thought you might be interested.

92
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,243
It's about 10 or 12 miles from here,
over by Linda Rosa.

93
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,946
Are they sure it's a meteor?
It didn't come down like one.

94
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,828
That's right.
Came down in kind of spurts, didn't it?

95
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,087
Well, you fellas will have
to figure it out. You're scientists.

96
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,712
All I know is, they say it's as big
as a house, and practically red-hot.

97
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,418
I'd like to borrow your car
and take a look at it in the morning.

98
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,593
We ought to get back.

99
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,423
- I can fly bilderbeck down in your plane.
- Okay.

100
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,473
The insurance is paid up.

101
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,145
- Light?
- No, I'll smoke it later.

102
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,288
- Did you watch it come down?
- I seen it from my window.

103
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,168
Harold. Harold. Look here a minute.

104
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,167
Step over to your left.
Just a little and hold it.

105
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,338
Smile.

106
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,714
It must've hit way up there,
and then skidded along the gully.

107
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,888
After it stopped, all that loose earth
and stuff shook down over it.

108
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,512
- Excuse me.
- I guess most of it's buried.

109
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,760
That's 12 feet thick, easy. Maybe more.

110
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,560
Meteors always run heavy.

111
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,357
They won't be able to haul this one
away to no museum.

112
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,276
It'll be a real good attraction
for Sunday drivers.

113
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,443
Better than a lion farm, or a snake pit.
We won't have to feed it.

114
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,651
Sure. We can sell the tamales,
and the enchiladas, and the hot dogs, too!

115
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,490
Yeah! Ice cream, cold drinks, souvenirs.

116
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,072
I think we should put up
a few picnic tables.

117
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,828
No, no. Then they'd bring
their own lunches.

118
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,585
What's the idea, buck?

119
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,584
- Gonna dig for gold?
- You think you're kidding?

120
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,917
It's gonna be like having a gold mine
in our own backyard.

121
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,720
I'm gonna get a closer look at it.

122
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,682
Reckon it's solid all through?

123
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,389
Lucky it didn't come down
in the middle of town!

124
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,233
I wonder who owns this property.

125
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,353
That's it, over there.

126
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,861
- What are you gonna do...
- Feels pretty darn hot!

127
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,566
What's the idea of the shovel?

128
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,425
- Be careful, buck.
- Yeah, watch it, buck.

129
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,986
Easy, buck. Come on.

130
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,910
It's pretty hot there.

131
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,624
- Did you see it come down?
- Yes. I was fishing up in the hills.

132
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,776
Well, you must've caught
plenty with all that tackle.

133
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,088
There were three of us.
The others flew back in my plane.

134
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,588
I don't understand why a meteor that size
didn't make a bigger crater.

135
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,719
It hit sideways, and skidded in.

136
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,517
At least that's what I think.
I don't really know.

137
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,142
But the ranger said a scientist
is coming from pacific tech.

138
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,312
He'll tell us.

139
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,433
Clayton forrester. Ever hear of him?

140
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,768
What's that fellow
trying to do over there, dig it out?

141
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,780
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.
He knows all about meteors.

142
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,775
You seem to know all about him.

143
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:43,246
Well, I did a thesis on modern scientists,
working for my master's degree.

144
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,741
- Did it do you any good?
- Why, sure. I got it.

145
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,044
- Say, do you have a match?
- No, I'm sorry. I don't smoke.

146
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,591
Forrester's the man
behind the new atomic engines.

147
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,335
They had him on the cover of time.

148
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,762
You know, you've got to rate to get that.

149
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,180
He isn't that good.

150
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,788
Well, now, how can you
say that when you don't even know him?

151
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,224
I do know him. Slightly.

152
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,898
- What's he like?
- Well, he's like...

153
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,270
Like...

154
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,323
Well, you certainly don't look like
yourself in that getup, Dr. forrester,

155
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,321
but I'm happy to meet you, anyway.

156
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,620
I'm Sylvia Van buren.
I teach library science over at usc.

157
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,410
I didn't know how to stop you.

158
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,708
Well, I might have
recognized you without the beard,

159
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,953
and you didn't wear glasses
on the time cover.

160
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,409
They're really for long distance.

161
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,628
When I want to look at something close,
I take them off.

162
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,066
Boy, you could fry eggs on that thing!

163
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,816
All that sand will keep the heat in
for a long time.

164
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,613
Uncle Matthew,
this is Dr. Clayton forrester.

165
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,693
My uncle, Dr. Matthew Collins,
pastor of the community church.

166
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,530
- Well, I... how do you do, Dr. forrester?
- How do you do, sir?

167
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,615
Hey, you!

168
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,917
What you got in here, fella?
Ticking like a bomb.

169
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,306
This is a geiger counter
for detecting radioactivity.

170
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,973
We did a little bit of surveying
while we were up in the hills.

171
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,650
It's that meteor.

172
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,778
It's radioactive?

173
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:47,029
Yes. Difficult to account
for a reaction like that.

174
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,955
Look at this thing. It's going crazy.

175
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,038
Maybe we ought to keep people
away from it, huh?

176
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,588
Might be a good idea.

177
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,040
I'll post two or three deputies.

178
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,335
They can make sure
it doesn't start any more fires, too.

179
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,129
You know, that meteor's either very light,

180
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,015
which is unheard of,
or else it's hollow somehow.

181
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,970
If it were heavy and solid,

182
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,804
it would have made
a tremendous crater when it landed.

183
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,024
I think I'll wait around
until it cools off.

184
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,277
If you tell me of a place in town,
I'd like to clean up.

185
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,980
I'd be delighted if you'd stay
at my house, Dr. forrester.

186
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,656
Thank you.

187
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,906
Probably won't be cool
for another 24 hours.

188
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,078
What do people do around here
on a Saturday?

189
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,575
They don't do much of anything.

190
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,079
There's a square dance
at the social hall this evening.

191
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,151
Well, let's take another look at it.

192
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,805
Almost cold now, ain't it?

193
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,515
It won't start any more fires.
We might as well go home.

194
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,976
Yeah, no sense staying out here.

195
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,736
Let's go.

196
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,778
Hey! It's moving!

197
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,176
It's a bomb.

198
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,258
It don't go off last night.

199
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,093
Maybe it's gonna go off now, huh?

200
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,094
It's an enemy sneak attack.

201
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,310
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

202
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,236
Bombs don't unscrew.

203
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,360
It's no meteor, that's for sure.

204
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,281
Darnedest thing I ever saw.

205
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,037
The way that's unscrewing.

206
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,291
Thank you, Dr. forrester. You having fun?

207
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,503
Yep. And you want to know
what I was thinking?

208
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,714
If we could gather all the energy
expended in just one square dance,

209
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,050
we could send that meteor
back to where it came from.

210
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,685
- Must be somebody in there.
- Who?

211
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,986
- Where do you think they come from?
- How would I know?

212
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,699
I read someplace
Mars is near the earth right now.

213
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,118
Happens every 18, 20 years, they say.

214
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,912
Men from Mars.

215
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,581
What do you think?

216
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,785
Maybe these are not men, not like us.

217
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,122
Everything human
doesn't have to look like you and me.

218
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,801
If it's men from Mars,
we ought to let them know we're friendly.

219
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,850
Don't fool around with something
when you don't know what it is.

220
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,557
We'd be the first to make
contact with them, see?

221
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,808
We'd be in all the papers.

222
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,185
How about that?

223
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,753
We could show them we're friendly, huh?

224
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,938
Walk out there with a white flag.

225
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,317
Hey, I got an old sugar sack in my car.

226
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,079
What are we going to say to them?

227
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,708
"Welcome to California.”

228
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,664
Come on.

229
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,117
We're friends! Yeah!

230
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,418
Hey, there! Open up!

231
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,168
- How they gonna understand us?
- We'll talk in sign language.

232
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,593
- They'll understand us, all right.
- Sure. Sure!

233
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,887
Everybody understands
when you wave the white flag,

234
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,555
you wanna be friends.

235
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,803
Hey, there! Open up!

236
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,634
Come on out! We're friends!

237
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,436
That's right! We welcome you!

238
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,310
We're friends! Yeah!

239
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,563
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

240
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,787
Where's the fuse box?

241
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,535
No smooching in the dark, folks.

242
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,835
Any candles around?

243
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,914
Hey, look! Look!
All the lights in town have gone out!

244
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,629
Somebody's found some candles.

245
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,260
- Zippy?
- T like it in the dark.

246
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,911
Call the electric company
and see what happened.

247
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,220
Okay.

248
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,698
- Hey! The phone's gone dead!
- That's funny.

249
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,070
The phone's not on the same circuit
as the lights.

250
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,992
What are they saying, honey?
Something's wrong with my hearing aid.

251
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,208
Well, we always play goodnight, ladies
at 12:00, anyway.

252
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,502
It must be nearly that now.

253
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,378
- My watch has stopped.
- I've got the time.

254
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,504
- Mine stopped, too.
- So has mine.

255
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,806
Jeepers, mine ain't working. What is this?

256
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,022
Why, they've all stopped at the same time.

257
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,441
There's only one explanation
for a thing like this.

258
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,519
Do you have a pin?

259
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,536
- Look!
- Look!

260
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:33,245
See that?
My watch is magnetized.

261
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,882
How could it happen
to everybody's watch altogether?

262
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,045
- Do you have a pocket compass?
- Yeah.

263
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,801
Hey, that needle isn't pointing north!

264
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,229
It's pointing to the gully
where that meteor came down.

265
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,023
All right, folks, let me through.
Let me through here.

266
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,028
Sheriff, what's going on?

267
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,865
I don't know any more than you do, Joe.

268
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,740
Look at the fire out there.

269
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,288
Let's go see.

270
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:49,036
The power lines are down.
That explains why the lights went out.

271
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,750
What the... hey, look at the car!

272
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,996
Where are the three men you left out here?

273
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:02,886
Look therel

274
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,158
Jump! Get under cover!

275
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,296
What is that gizmo?

276
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,224
I think that gizmo is a machine
from another planet.

277
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,019
We better get word to the authorities.

278
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,268
Look!

279
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,988
Sheriff, you'd better
get word to the military.

280
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,695
You're going to need them out here.

281
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,092
Get moving, on the double!

282
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,017
Take cover along the riverbed!
Get those .30s over here!

283
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,898
The area is under control
of marines from El toro base,

284
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,225
and the gully is surrounded.

285
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,519
And here's professor mcpherson

286
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,937
of the Canadian
meteorological research council.

287
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,968
Is it true, professor,
you've had reports of landings

288
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,701
- in other places? In Canada?
- Not in Canada yet.

289
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,870
But in Bordeaux, France. Some in Spain.

290
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,666
There's supposed to be
one down near the Gulf of taranto, Italy.

291
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,910
We're trying to locate the second meteor

292
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,667
that landed in this vicinity
just about midnight.

293
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,248
Well, do you think they come from Mars?

294
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,709
What do you think, Dr. forrester?

295
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,757
It's possible. At least it seems certain

296
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,340
they're from some planet
other than our own.

297
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,372
Suppose they are martians, professor.
What would they look like?

298
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,352
Bigger than us? Smaller?

299
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,979
Well, as to martians,

300
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,603
our gravitational pull
would weigh them down.

301
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,355
Our heavier air would oppress them.

302
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,858
Then you think they'd be
breathing creatures like us.

303
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,314
What about the hearts
and blood and all that?

304
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,697
But if they are martians,
and if they do have hearts,

305
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,244
they'd almost certainly
beat at a slower rate.

306
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,197
Their veins might be distended.

307
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,329
Their senses could be quite different
from ours, of course.

308
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,208
They may, for instance,
be able to smell colors.

309
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,123
Precedent in our own evolution

310
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,425
makes it possible
that they have more than one brain.

311
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,675
You mean two? Three?
Just think of that, folks!

312
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,347
It's only speculation.

313
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,471
Now, Dr. forrester,
what about these meteor machines?

314
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,804
They're probably controlled by jets
after they enter our atmosphere,

315
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,608
and navigated by some form
of gyroscopic mechanism.

316
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,939
Thank you, Dr. forrester.

317
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,446
Colonel, can you tell us anything
about this plane that's coming over?

318
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,568
It'll drop a flare.

319
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,262
That's the only way
we dare put light on them.

320
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,322
Then air force cameramen
will get pictures.

321
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,950
That was marine colonel Ralph heffner.

322
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,828
There's been a lot of mysterious activity
around the machine.

323
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,877
Lights and dust,
as if they're digging themselves out.

324
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,079
And there it comes again!

325
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,755
If this keeps up, it'll be a guide
for the plane when it comes over.

326
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,733
- Is that the plane, now?
- Yes. He's signaling.

327
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,654
The pilot has just blipped his motor.
That means he's dropped the flare.

328
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,373
He's flying high, so, it'll take
a few seconds for it to come down.

329
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,422
When it does burst,
we shall be the first men on earth

330
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,188
to get a real look
at these invaders from space.

331
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,309
They're going after the plane
with their ray!

332
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,418
- Take cover!
- Jump for it!

333
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,013
We are...

334
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,688
Hey!

335
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,645
They cut me off! They got my truck!

336
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,818
It looks like they're gonna come out
of that gully pretty soon.

337
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,149
We'll have to rush our defenses
to be ready when they do.

338
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,763
You're going to need
plenty of reinforcements.

339
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,072
We'll get them.

340
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,907
They got the fire road blocked.

341
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,583
A truck turned over.

342
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,165
The troops are certainly moving in here.

343
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,459
I know you sent word
to the sixth army command.

344
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,633
No, I just told them the local situation.
Colonel heffner's in charge.

345
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,659
You never know where
you're going to wind up

346
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,203
when you go to a square dance, do you?

347
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,763
Runner? Where's a runner?

348
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,760
- That's d-24.
- Correct.

349
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,399
Now, locate your
observation post on this hill.

350
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,153
Position your recoilless 75s
back here, carbon canyon.

351
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,943
- Yes, sir.
- I want your battery here.

352
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,752
You may find at daylight,
you're too exposed,

353
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,198
so, keep your prime movers
ready to pull you out fast.

354
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,698
But you'll get first crack at them.

355
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,392
- Suits me. Will that be all, sir?
- Colonel heffner?

356
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,407
Yes. Report when you're setup.

357
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,839
Heffner.

358
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,168
Half-tracks? Okay.

359
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,417
Get in back of hill three.

360
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,753
Repeat, hill three.

361
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,134
If it's a moving target,
follow up from there.

362
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,675
- All right. Over and out.
- Number seven, do you hear me?

363
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,011
Anybody get a look at the martians yet?

364
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,937
They've located that second meteor.

365
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,813
Mark it up.

366
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,109
Weapons truck turned over on the road.
Take action and report.

367
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,532
Company tactical net out of action.
No radio.

368
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,486
Three, one, eight, zero...

369
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:49,415
There's one. There's the other.
And here we are, right between them.

370
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,450
So is the town, I notice.

371
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,481
I warned them to be ready
if they have to evacuate.

372
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,542
I just came to tell you
everyone has been alerted.

373
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,633
As you were.

374
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,380
General mann, I was told
to expect you, sir. I'm colonel heffner.

375
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,710
I'm here to make up a report,

376
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,408
not to interfere
with the operations you've setup.

377
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,797
You're still in command.

378
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,007
Clayton forrester.

379
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,808
- I haven't seen you since oak Ridge.
- Good to see you, general.

380
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,557
- This is pastor Collins.
- How do you do?

381
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,933
- Sheriff bogany, head of local control.
- General.

382
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,335
- Miss Van buren.
- Miss Van buren.

383
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,212
How do you do, general?
Would you care for some coffee?

384
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,442
Thank you.

385
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,521
General mann's in charge
of intelligence for the pacific area.

386
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,857
That's their position.

387
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,243
Well, you've certainly
got them surrounded.

388
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,491
I suppose they neutralized
all communications here.

389
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,449
Not all, sir. Radio's out,
but our field phones are okay so far.

390
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,330
Well, they'll go the minute
there's another heat-ray.

391
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,749
"Cylinder reported down
by huntington beach."

392
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,540
- Well, that's a job for the Navy.
- Any news from abroad?

393
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,173
Washington is in constant touch
with the military of other nations.

394
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,466
Apparently, they're coming down all over.

395
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,842
South America.

396
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,050
Santiago has two cylinders.

397
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,434
They're outside London.

398
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,557
They're in Naples.

399
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:58,359
We've got them between here and Fresno.
Outside Sacramento. Two on long island.

400
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,561
They're just coming down at random.

401
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,237
No.

402
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,906
According to information
from foreign sources,

403
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,234
they're working to some kind of a plan.

404
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,944
Now, what it may be isn't clear yet,

405
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,283
simply because, once they begin to move,
no more news comes out of that area.

406
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,252
We've been getting reports
of destruction, massacre.

407
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,628
Here's an instance,

408
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,678
"town of St. Julien, south of Bordeaux,
wiped out by ray of undetermined nature.

409
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,051
"Local reports say nothing remains.”

410
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,216
Nothing remains. What do you make of that?

411
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,222
All we've seen is the heat-ray they use.

412
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,999
Well, some of
our newest weapons are in here.

413
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,435
- We want to be sure to stop them.
- We will, sir.

414
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,734
Now, from the data

415
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,943
from that picture
the air force took earlier tonight,

416
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,568
what we've got out there,
is the original pilot ship.

417
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:49,159
On the basis of its observations,
the others were guided down.

418
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,613
Pattern-wise, one lands, then two,

419
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,949
making groups of threes,
joined magnetically.

420
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,999
- Is that possible?
- If they do it, it is.

421
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,481
My orders are not to go into action

422
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,400
unless they move
out of the shelter of that gully.

423
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,086
Well, meanwhile,
we'll have a chance to observe them.

424
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,946
This is the only place
we've had time to surround them

425
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,585
with sufficient force to contain them.

426
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,093
What happens here
will be a guide to all other operations.

427
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,217
Now, the minute action begins
and a pattern of defense develops,

428
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,600
I'll get my report to Washington.

429
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,059
- You've deployed your forces well.
- Thank you, sir.

430
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:23,064
If they start anything,
we can blast them right off the earth.

431
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,995
They'll probably move at dawn.

432
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,488
There's something moving in the gully.

433
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,442
Look at it, will you?

434
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,029
Beings from another world.

435
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,335
- Is that some kind of a flying machine?
- No, no.

436
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,132
It's supported from the ground by rays,

437
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,420
probably some form
of magnetic flux, like invisible legs.

438
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,222
This is amazing.

439
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:20,432
They must keep the opposing poles
in balance and lift the machine.

440
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,064
Stand by to fire.

441
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,854
All command posts, stand by to fire.

442
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,531
But, colonel, shooting's no good.

443
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,986
It's always been a good persuader.

444
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,242
Shouldn't you try to
communicate with them first,

445
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,075
and shoot later if you have to?

446
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,233
Target as indicated.
Repeat. Target as indicated.

447
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,121
The 75s report they've got them
under open sights, sir.

448
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,666
I think we should try
to make them understand

449
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,539
we mean them no harm.

450
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,586
There's another machine coming out.

451
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:41,221
- They are living creatures out there.
- But they're not human.

452
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,751
Dr. forrester says they're some kind
of advanced civilization.

453
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,651
They should be nearer the creator
for that reason.

454
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,563
It'll be a moving target.
Prepare to follow-up.

455
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:01,069
No real attempt has been made
to communicate with them, you know?

456
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,784
Let's go back inside, uncle Matthew.

457
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,414
I've done all I can in there. You go back.

458
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:12,373
Sylvia, I like that Dr. forrester.

459
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,921
He's a good man.

460
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,920
Attention, all batteries.
Prepare for volley fire.

461
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,598
Repeat. Prepare for volley fire.

462
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,031
Who's that?

463
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,330
What's he think he's doing?

464
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:56,383
- Uncle! Uncle Matthew! Stop him!
- It's too late now. He's too far away.

465
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,673
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

466
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,254
"t will fear no evil."

467
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,555
Stop him!

468
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,222
It's seen him.

469
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:15,395
"Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

470
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:25,913
"And I will dwell in
the house of the lord forever."

471
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,129
- Let them have it!
- Fire!

472
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,647
Those shells can't get through to them.

473
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,278
They've put out some sort
of electromagnetic covering,

474
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,825
a protective blister.

475
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:18,901
That skeleton beam must be

476
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,631
what they used
to wipe out the French city.

477
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,520
It neutralizes mesons somehow.

478
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,981
They're the atomic glue
holding matter together.

479
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,410
Cut across their lines of magnetic force,
and any object will simply cease to exist.

480
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,112
Take my word for it, general.

481
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,699
This type of defense is useless
against that kind of power.

482
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,043
You'd better let Washington know, fast!

483
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,335
- Hold them as long as you can.
- Right, sir.

484
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,401
Order all command posts.

485
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,109
Everything pull back north
of highway 60 tunnel bunker.

486
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,284
Right.

487
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,892
Everybody, out of here! Everybody, out!

488
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,194
The air force will take care
of these babies now.

489
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:48,607
Dr. forrester, get out of here.
Everybody out of here!

490
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,191
Everybody...

491
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,811
You'll hit something. Can't you go higher?

492
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:25,060
No. The air will be full
of jets in a minute. There they are!

493
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:18,033
All about the martian invasion.
They're in New York and Miami,

494
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,580
invasion killer rays!

495
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,579
Fighting outside Los Angeles.

496
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,911
All about jt!

497
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,890
Hold it right there, general, please.

498
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,546
You're the gentlemen I asked to come here.

499
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,631
- Get Washington.
- General mann,

500
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,112
what do you think of this situation?

501
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,190
Is it your opinion the army can hold them?

502
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,319
Sorry, I've no time.

503
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,180
You had guns and equipment
going out there all night.

504
00:40:56,204 --> 00:41:00,288
- Wasn't that enough to...
- Come on. Break it up.

505
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,790
The way he's hedging,
maybe the army didn't hold them.

506
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:07,462
I've seen news off the pacific cables.
Sydney, Australia. Penang, rangoon, India.

507
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,668
From what's coming through,
nobody's stopped them yet.

508
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,333
I wanna know
if the city must be evacuated...

509
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,090
We're ready. Lots of people
have already moved out.

510
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,638
We've mobilized emergency cars
and buses in the yards.

511
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,215
The red cross is standing by.

512
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,802
Now, for your information, the enemy
is 25 or 30 miles outside Los Angeles.

513
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,637
Not down in full force yet,
but developing.

514
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,142
It can happen any minute.

515
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,380
The crisis will come if they move toward
the metropolitan area. Now, we've got...

516
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,066
Washington's on the line, sir.

517
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
General mann.

518
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:40,570
I'd say our effective losses
were nearly 60% men, 90% material.

519
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,660
Well, the jets went in,
but not one of them came out.

520
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,604
I watched high-level bombers
drop everything they carried.

521
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,773
They were knocked out of the sky,
and their bombs did nothing.

522
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,958
Nothing was effective against them.

523
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,165
Yes. They have some sort
of electronic umbrella.

524
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,545
It's quite impenetrable.

525
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,672
Dr. forrester believes
they generate atomic force

526
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,341
without the heavy screening we use.

527
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:00,139
That's where they get
the power for their rays.

528
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,263
Very well, sir.

529
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,749
Call victorville, tell them I want
the fastest plane they've got.

530
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,085
You'll get all further instructions
from sixth army command.

531
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,545
Now, I'll make a statement
to those reporters.

532
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,604
Right.

533
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,867
All right, fellas.
The general will see you now.

534
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,363
General, we heard

535
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,662
that Dr. Clayton forrester
was out there with you.

536
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,080
What's he think about this?

537
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,374
Ask him. He's back at pacific tech.

538
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,328
No, he's not. We tried to get him there.
He hasn't shown up.

539
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,852
Wake up.

540
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,066
Let's get moving, huh?

541
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,570
Are you all right?

542
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,865
- Is that machine...
- It's gone.

543
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,043
Where are we?
Southwest of corona somewhere.

544
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,010
There must have been
another cylinder down here.

545
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,586
They've been through this whole area
and cleared everybody out.

546
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,674
There's a farmhouse out there.

547
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,762
Let's see if we can
find something to eat, huh?

548
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,103
We're doing all right.
You know, I almost forgot when I ate last.

549
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,947
Hey, that looks good.

550
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,075
You know, mostly, I get my meals
in coffee shops and restaurants.

551
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,494
- Don't you live at home?
- No, on the campus.

552
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:30,824
- I haven't any family.
- I come from a big one.

553
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,795
There's nine of us,
all in Minnesota, except me.

554
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:40,462
I have no close folks.
My parents died when I was a kid.

555
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:43,169
A big family must be fun. I imagine...

556
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,346
I imagine it makes
you feel you belong to something.

557
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,841
It does. Maybe that's why I feel
kind of lost right now.

558
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,804
We'll get out of here safely.
Don't worry.

559
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,433
But they seem to murder
everything that moves.

560
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,774
If they're mortal,
they must have mortal weaknesses.

561
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,239
They'll be stopped. Somehow.

562
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,349
I've been as close to them as anyone,

563
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,864
I feel like I did one time
when I was small.

564
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,661
Awful scared and lonesome.

565
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,497
I'd wandered off. I've forgotten why.

566
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:23,209
But the family and whole crowds
of neighbors were hunting for me.

567
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,713
They found me in a church.

568
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,967
I was afraid to go in anyplace else.

569
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,181
I stayed right by that door,

570
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:37,315
praying for the one who loved me best
to come and find me.

571
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,859
It was uncle Matthew who found me.

572
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,740
I liked him.

573
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,862
He liked you.

574
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,572
I could bawl my head off.

575
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,283
But you're not going to.
You're not the kind.

576
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:58,040
Look, you're tired.
You've been up all night.

577
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,338
You cracked up in a plane,
slept in a ditch.

578
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,790
You want to know something?

579
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,177
It doesn't show on you at all.

580
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,104
Get down!

581
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,147
- How long was I out?
- Hours. I've been so scared.

582
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,730
They're right outside.
Several of them came down together.

583
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,501
There's a machine standing
right alongside of us.

584
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,541
An electronic eye.

585
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,454
Like a television camera.

586
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,509
It's looking for us.

587
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,786
Maybe they're not too sure we're here.

588
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,297
They could be as curious about us
as we are about them.

589
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,500
Maybe.

590
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,587
Maybe they want to take us alive.

591
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,402
It's pulling out.

592
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,210
Can't we get out of here?

593
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,893
Something moved out there.

594
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:27,889
There's nothing there now.

595
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,939
It was one of them.

596
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,232
What was it like?

597
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,899
I couldn't see much in the dark,
but it was one.

598
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,732
We're right in a nest of them.
I've got to get a good look at them.

599
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:52,584
- They've blocked it.
- It's blocked here, too.

600
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:56,213
They've pushed earth or something,
all around, outside.

601
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,837
Here. This way.
The stairway up to the attic.

602
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,860
Look out!

603
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:53,330
Your scarf.

604
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,714
It's wet.

605
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,257
Blood.

606
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,514
No, no.

607
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,058
Nol

608
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,682
- stop it! Stop it!
- It's not blood!

609
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,595
We gotta make a run for it. Come on.

610
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,021
The martians had calculated
their descent upon our earth

611
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,724
with amazing perfection and subtlety.

612
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,778
As more of their cylinders came
from the mysterious depths of space,

613
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:07,074
their war machines,
awesome in their power and complexity,

614
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:11,120
created a wave of fear, which swept
into all corners of the world.

615
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,494
In every country, government officials
met in desperate conclave,

616
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:18,248
seeking ways to coordinate their defenses
with those of other nations.

617
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,082
The government of India,
driven from New Delhi,

618
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,883
met in a railroad coach,

619
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,510
while massive hindu populations streamed

620
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,965
for the imagined safety
of the faraway himalayas.

621
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,846
The redoubtable Finnish
and turkish armies,

622
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:38,397
Chinese battalions and Bolivians
worked and fought furiously.

623
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,187
Every effort against the tremendous power

624
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,987
of their other-world antagonists
ended in the same frantic rout.

625
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:53,241
As the martians burned fields and forests,
and great cities fell before them,

626
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,244
huge populations were
driven from their homes.

627
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,501
The stream of flight
Rose swiftly to a torrent.

628
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:03,797
It became a giant stampede
without order and without goal.

629
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,050
It was the beginning
of the rout of civilization,

630
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,048
of the massacre of humanity.

631
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:20,056
A great silence fell over half of Europe
as all communication was disrupted.

632
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,934
When the last wire photo out of Paris

633
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,771
reached the French cabinet
exiled in strasbourg,

634
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:30,653
they hit upon the idea
of using super-speed jets as couriers.

635
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,656
Stripped of armament
and loaded with extra fuel,

636
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,830
these planes maintained connection
with the Scandinavian countries,

637
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:41,206
north Africa, the United States,
and especially with england.

638
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,420
It was plain the martians appreciated

639
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:47,045
the strategic significance
of the British isles.

640
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,886
The people of britain met
the invaders magnificently.

641
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,629
But it was unavailing.

642
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,098
As the martians swept
northward toward London,

643
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,268
the British cabinet stayed in session,

644
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:02,348
coordinating every item of information
that could be gathered,

645
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,809
passing it on
to the united nations in New York.

646
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,562
From there, the news was
forwarded to Washington

647
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:13,026
because here was the only remaining
unassailed strategic point.

648
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,156
Forty-eight north. Two west.

649
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,362
Thirty-one east.

650
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,162
- Anchored on Cairo.
- Checking.

651
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,366
Dover blanked out.

652
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,666
Brazil checking.

653
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:25,587
Urgent. Major Bentley Dawson,
report to general mann.

654
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,636
Eighty west by 38 north.

655
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,097
Make every effort to contact
the civil authorities,

656
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,516
evacuating declared emergency area.

657
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,639
And this much is certain,

658
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,689
it's vital to prevent
the martian machines from linking up.

659
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,819
Once they do, they adopt
an extraordinary military tactic.

660
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,942
They form a Crescent.

661
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,534
They anchor it at one end and sweep on,

662
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,990
until they've cleared a quadrant.

663
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:07,295
Then they anchor the opposite end
and reverse direction.

664
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,040
They slash across country like scythes,

665
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,467
wiping out everything that's trying
to get away from them.

666
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:16,046
That explains why communication is cut
the moment their machines begin moving.

667
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:19,141
Montreal's blacked out.
Nothing more has come through.

668
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,027
Same thing that happened
on the pacific coast.

669
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,874
- Anything from them yet?
- No, Mr. secretary.

670
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,514
We've had nothing
from San Francisco for over five hours.

671
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,976
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Here's that Los Angeles picture, sir.

672
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:32,279
This is a Sonic radar picture
taken from extreme altitude.

673
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:36,154
It shows full details of the martian nest
outside Los Angeles.

674
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:41,914
Their machines appear as round blobs.
Newly-fallen cylinders are elongated.

675
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,667
We know there are three cylinders
to each group

676
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,790
and three machines to each cylinder.

677
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,177
All right. I've seen enough.

678
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,598
There's only one thing
that'll stop the martians.

679
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:04,053
We've held back because
of the danger of radiation to civilians.

680
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,388
Now, there's no choice.

681
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,524
The white house will confirm an order
to use the atom bomb.

682
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:13,695
Then our first target will be the initial
landing place outside Los Angeles.

683
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,064
First thing you get there,

684
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,512
arrange for the pacific tech scientists
to monitor the drop.

685
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:21,745
I'll send wire orders ahead of you,
and have the area cleared all around.

686
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:27,497
We've still time to hit them before dark.

687
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,462
Then we'll blast them all over the world.

688
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,924
Pacific institute
of science and technology

689
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,992
forrester, everybody's been
looking for you.

690
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:43,100
I know. We've walked halfway from corona.
Finally found an abandoned truck.

691
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,017
This is miss Van buren.

692
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:48,268
Dr. gratzman, Dr. pryor,
James, bilderbeck.

693
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,669
What's this I hear about the a-bomb?

694
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,129
We've been assigned as special detail.

695
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,922
We're going in right afterwards,
study its effect.

696
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,153
We're leaving in half an hour.
What's that?

697
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,448
- King-sized fisheye?
- This is an electronic eye.

698
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,449
The martians modeled it
after their own eye.

699
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,199
They use it the way we use a periscope.

700
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,250
It'll tell us a lot about
their metals and alloys.

701
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,746
If this is actually a lens,
we can find out about their optics.

702
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:13,001
- Interesting. Very interesting.
- And this...

703
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,790
Blood of a martian.

704
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:21,805
I don't remember ever seeing
blood crystals as anemic as these.

705
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,642
They may be mental giants,

706
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,894
but by our standards,

707
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:31,648
physically, they must be very primitive.

708
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:36,145
Isn't it curious how everything
about them seems to be in threes?

709
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,855
Their eyes have three lenses,
three distinct pupils,

710
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,862
- strong light shocks them.
- They're not accustomed to it.

711
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:46,071
Sunlight on Mars is approximately
half as strong as we get it.

712
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:50,785
Add their clouds and dust,
it amounts to no more than our twilight.

713
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:56,044
Now, if you'll step over here, please.

714
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,749
We've rigged the epidiascope

715
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,802
to reflect whatever
the martian lens picks up.

716
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,722
Move in a little. Thank you.

717
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:41,968
There's how the martians see us.

718
01:00:55,402 --> 01:01:00,317
Evidently, there's a shift
in their spectrum.

719
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:03,114
Their color absorption
must be different from ours.

720
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:14,790
Let's see why they were
so curious about you, miss Van buren.

721
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,965
Time to get started, gentlemen.

722
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,588
Let's go.

723
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,800
That martian blood,

724
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,723
let them make a quick analysis of it
to see what we've got.

725
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,179
It might give us something.

726
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:35,764
- Something we could use.
- Let it go.

727
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,295
If you're interested in martian blood,

728
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:41,562
you'll get all you want
right after the plane drops the bomb.

729
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,402
The flying wing is going to carry it.

730
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,668
Hello, tower, this is
air force flying wing ready for takeoff.

731
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:57,870
Over.

732
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,548
Flying wing, this is the tower.
Clear for takeoff. Over.

733
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,418
Wish us luck. Roger.

734
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:35,283
The target for the a-bomb is this nest
of martian machines in the puente hills,

735
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:39,286
where more of these meteor-cylinders
came down early last evening.

736
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,999
A plane will pinpoint the target
for the drop from six miles up.

737
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,593
We've been warned that this bomb
is 10 times more powerful

738
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,716
than anything previously used.

739
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:51,173
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.

740
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:54,180
Nothing like this has ever
been exploded before,

741
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,265
and we're going to be pretty darn close.

742
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,723
But there are observers
down in the valley in a forward bunker,

743
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,934
they'll be a lot nearer than us.

744
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,148
The whole world is waiting,

745
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,733
for this will decide
the fate of civilization and all humanity.

746
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:13,328
Whether we live or die,
may depend on what happens here.

747
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:17,909
Attention, please.
Four minutes to bomb time.

748
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,896
There must be a couple of million people

749
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:24,085
back of us in the shelter
of the San Gabriel hills.

750
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:28,339
Waiting. Waiting to find out
whether they can go home again.

751
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:32,431
Everywhere, all around the world,
people have been driven from their homes.

752
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:36,009
Direct cable communication
is being maintained with Washington,

753
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,140
but there's no radio at all,

754
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,940
not even with the
bombing plane that's coming over.

755
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:45,315
All radio is dead.

756
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,900
Which means that these
tape recordings I'm making

757
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:51,028
are for the sake of future history.

758
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,234
If any.

759
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,789
Future history, he said.

760
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,495
Yes. If any.

761
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:12,549
Bilderbeck has calculated
how long we have got

762
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,926
until martians take over the entire world.

763
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,384
If the a-bomb fails, that is,

764
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:21,430
the martians can conquer the earth
in six days.

765
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,600
The same number of days
it took to create it.

766
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,402
Attention, please.
Two minutes to bomb time.

767
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:37,283
Prepare to take shelter.

768
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,954
If you have no goggles, turn away.

769
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:46,288
Remember, the heat flash
and concussion that follow are dangerous.

770
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,062
Fifty seconds.

771
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,809
- There's the plane.
- Right.

772
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,400
Forty seconds.

773
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,197
- We've spotted the plane, sir.
- Right.

774
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,826
Thirty seconds.

775
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,000
Look. Look!

776
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,371
They're using
those protective blisters again.

777
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,705
Twenty seconds.

778
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,379
Attention. Stand by.

779
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,926
Fifteen seconds.

780
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,010
Ten seconds.

781
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:42,094
Nine, eight, seven,

782
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:46,056
six, five, four,

783
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:49,814
three, two, one.

784
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,971
Hello! Hello, hello, there.
What can you see?

785
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,365
There's something moving.

786
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,833
They haven't even been touched!

787
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:03,474
It didn't stop them.

788
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,644
Guns, tanks, bombs.
They're like toys against them.

789
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,440
It'll end only one way. We're beaten.

790
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,190
No. Not yet.

791
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,198
Washington issued orders.

792
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:22,125
In the event the a-bomb failed,
evacuate all cities in danger of attack.

793
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:24,863
They'll be moving on Los Angeles now.

794
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:29,543
We'll establish a line and fight them
all the way back to the mountains.

795
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:32,083
Our best hope lies in what you people
can develop to help us.

796
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,712
All right, on the double. Get me back
to sixth army hq. Hurry up!

797
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:41,217
Six days, you said. Six days.

798
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,214
They'll stamp the city flat.

799
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,470
We'll take all our instruments

800
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,227
and establish a base laboratory
in the rocky mountains.

801
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,854
It'll give us time to search out
some weakness in the martians.

802
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:56,357
A forlorn hope, but there is a chance.

803
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,938
We may get a lead from that anemic blood.

804
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,399
You mean by some biological approach?

805
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:05,578
We know now,
that we can't beat their machines.

806
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,663
We've got to beat them.

807
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:27,892
Everybody, listen carefully.
The martians are coming this way.

808
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,848
We must evacuate the city.

809
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:33,265
Take food and water
and extra clothing with you.

810
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,267
All major highways have been marked

811
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,479
to lead you to shelter
and welfare centers in the hills.

812
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:52,204
Come on, come on. Keep going.

813
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,870
Keep going.

814
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,510
Keep them rolling, there. Keep going.

815
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,300
Come on.

816
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,350
Come on!

817
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,829
Gratzman, did you get those biotics?

818
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,626
No, I thought you had them!

819
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:20,330
Never mind. I'll get them!
You get in the school bus!

820
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:22,290
Sylvia will drive you!

821
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,830
Let me up.

822
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:47,258
- Get off, buster!
- I'll give you $500 for your place.

823
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,758
- I'll make it $1,000!
- Money's no good anymore, Mac!

824
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,309
Here comes another truck!

825
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:04,021
- Throw that guy off there!
- Get him out of therel

826
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:05,985
stop, you fools!

827
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,152
Get over!

828
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,860
You fools!

829
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,965
Quick! Help me! We've got to stop them!

830
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,871
We can't stop them.
The law's no good here now.

831
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,165
They're thieves, robbers, worse.
They wouldn't leave with the rest.

832
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,475
- It's like this all over.
- They've got to be stopped!

833
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:43,898
Those instruments!

834
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:53,240
Hold it! Hold it a minute!

835
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:58,655
We've got to have those instruments.
They're our only chance!

836
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,603
Did that mob grab the trucks ahead of me?

837
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:29,423
There were a lot of pacific tech people
with those trucks. Did you see them?

838
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,087
I don't know anything about other trucks.

839
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:32,718
There's been fighting on all the streets.

840
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,903
A school bus.
A girl was driving. Did they get that?

841
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,434
If they saw it, they took it.
They'll grab anything on wheels.

842
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:41,038
You can't buy a ride for love or money!

843
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:39,051
School bus

844
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:51,025
Gratzman! Bilderbeck!

845
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,612
Sylvia!

846
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,095
Hey, you, better get out of here.

847
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,680
I'm looking for some
pacific tech professors!

848
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,562
- There's nobody left around here now!
- We had a chance.

849
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,393
We could've stopped them.

850
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:37,901
The mob stole all the trucks,
smashed everything up.

851
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:39,983
Fools! They cut their own throats!

852
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,448
He's nuts. Come on. Jump in.

853
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,917
- Hurry up! Jump in!
- There was a girl with them.

854
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:00,754
- If I can find them...
- Come on. Jump in, will you?

855
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:05,763
- She's kind of lost.
- You look kind of lost yourself.

856
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:08,097
But I think it know where she'll be.

857
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:11,681
Come on, come on.
It's your last chance to get out of here.

858
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:10,907
We humbly beseech
thy divine guidance, o lord.

859
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:15,290
Deliver us from the fear
which has come upon us.

860
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:20,507
From the evil that grows ever nearer.

861
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:27,178
From the terror that soon will knock
upon the very door of this, thy house.

862
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,480
O lord, we pray thee,

863
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:38,856
Grant us the miracle
of thy divine intervention.

864
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,193
Don't go, son. Stay with us.

865
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:52,533
No. I'm looking for someone.
She'll be in a church, near the door.

866
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,107
Forrester!

867
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,017
Duprey, bilderbeck!

868
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:03,477
Are you...

869
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:05,823
Where are the others?

870
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:10,117
A mob attacked us.
We don't know what happened to the rest.

871
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,903
I... I got...

872
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,580
I got knocked under our truck.

873
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,494
Duprey pulled me out.

874
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:22,880
What happened to Sylvia?

875
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,708
We never did see her again.

876
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:07,800
In our peril, we plead,
succor and comfort us in this hour.

877
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,173
Please, god.

878
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,316
Sylvia!

879
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,037
Sylvia!

880
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:49,302
Sylvia!

881
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:56,223
- Here! Here!
- Sylvia!

882
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,736
Let me through, please!

883
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,496
Maybe they've gone another way.

884
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,516
Let's go see.

885
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:25,971
It must be all right.

886
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,132
Something's happening to them.

887
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:57,946
It's dead.

888
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,920
We were all praying for a miracle.

889
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,815
The martians had no resistance
to the bacteria in our atmosphere

890
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,609
to which we have long since become immune.

891
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:40,606
Once they had breathed our air,
germs which no longer affect us

892
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:42,362
began to kill them.

893
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,488
The end came swiftly.

894
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:48,455
All over the world, their machines
began to stop and fall.

895
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:52,201
After all that men could do had failed,

896
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:55,504
the martians were destroyed
and humanity was saved

897
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:57,713
by the littlest things

898
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:01,001
which god, in his wisdom,
had put upon this earth.
