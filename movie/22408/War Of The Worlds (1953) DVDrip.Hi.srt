NARRATOR: <i>In the First World War</i>

2
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:11,374
<i>and for the first time in the history of man,</i>

3
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:13,810
<i>nations combined to fight against nations,</i>

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,729
<i>using the crude weapons of those days.</i>

5
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,931
<i>The Second World War</i>

6
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:20,717
<i>involved every continent on the globe,</i>

7
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:23,686
<i>and men turned to science
for new devices of warfare,</i>

8
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:26,056
<i>which reached an unparalleled peak</i>

9
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,958
<i>in their capacity for destruction.</i>

10
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,259
<i>And now,</i>

11
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:31,295
<i>fought with the terrible
weapons of superscience,</i>

12
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:34,548
<i>menacing all mankind
and every creature on Earth,</i>

13
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:36,283
<i>comes...</i>

14
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:37,668
<i>The War of the Worlds.</i>

15
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,417
<i>No one would have believed</i>

16
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,053
<i>in the middle of the 20th century</i>

17
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:49,222
<i>that human affairs were being
watched keenly and closely</i>

18
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:51,591
<i>by intelligences greater than man's.</i>

19
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:56,329
<i>Yet across the gulf of space,
on the planet Mars,</i>

20
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,067
<i>intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic</i>

21
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:02,535
<i>regarded our Earth with envious eyes,</i>

22
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:07,473
<i>slowly and surely
drawing their plans against us.</i>

23
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:11,044
<i>Mars is more than
140 million miles from the sun,</i>

24
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:12,612
<i>and for centuries</i>

25
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:15,782
<i>it has been in the last stages of exhaustion.</i>

26
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:19,686
<i>At night, temperatures drop far below zero,</i>

27
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:21,287
<i>even at its equator.</i>

28
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:23,857
<i>The inhabitants of this dying planet</i>

29
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:25,074
<i>looked across space</i>

30
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:26,976
<i>with instruments and intelligences</i>

31
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:29,212
<i>of which we have scarcely dreamed,</i>

32
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:33,950
<i>searching for another world
to which they could migrate.</i>

33
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,287
<i>They could not go to Pluto,
outermost of all planets,</i>

34
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:42,925
<i>and so cold that its atmosphere
lies frozen on its surface.</i>

35
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:45,328
<i>They couldn't go to Neptune or Uranus,</i>

36
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:49,399
<i>twin worlds in eternal night
and perpetual cold,</i>

37
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:52,636
<i>both surrounded by an unbreathable atmosphere</i>

38
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:55,139
<i>of methane gas and ammonia vapor.</i>

39
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,143
<i>The Martians considered Saturn,
an attractive world,</i>

40
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:03,813
<i>with its many moons and
beautiful rings of cosmic dust.</i>

41
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:09,052
<i>But its temperature is close
to 270 degrees below zero,</i>

42
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:14,257
<i>and ice lies 15,000 miles deep on its surface.</i>

43
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:16,593
<i>Their nearest world was giant Jupiter,</i>

44
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:19,762
<i>where there are titanic cliffs of lava and ice</i>

45
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:22,065
<i>with hydrogen flaming at the tops,</i>

46
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,118
<i>where the atmospheric pressure is terrible,</i>

47
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:27,687
<i>thousands of pounds to the square-inch.</i>

48
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:29,656
<i>They couldn't go there.</i>

49
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:33,627
<i>Nor could they go to Mercury,
nearest planet to the sun.</i>

50
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:35,028
<i>It has no air,</i>

51
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:37,296
<i>and the temperature at its equator</i>

52
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:40,299
<i>is that of molten lead.</i>

53
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,068
<i>Of all the worlds</i>

54
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,805
<i>that the intelligences on Mars
could see and study,</i>

55
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:48,541
<i>only our own warm Earth</i>

56
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,646
<i>was green with vegetation, bright with water</i>

57
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,915
<i>and possessed a cloudy atmosphere</i>

58
00:03:56,165 --> 00:03:58,518
<i>eloquent of fertility.</i>

59
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,419
<i>It did not occur to mankind</i>

60
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,023
<i>that a swift fate might be hanging over us</i>

61
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:06,359
<i>or that from the blackness of outer space</i>

62
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:09,696
<i>we were being scrutinized and studied,</i>

63
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:14,300
<i>until the time of our nearest
approach to the orbit of Mars</i>

64
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,263
<i>during a pleasant summer season...</i>

65
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:30,833
MAN: Is that a fireball or something?

66
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,101
Boy, that's big!

67
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,624
Maybe it's a comet.

68
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:38,207
Boy, that had me scared.

69
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:39,476
Wonder where it lit.

70
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:40,710
Miles away, I'll bet you.

71
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,844
Hey, let's go find it.

72
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:43,480
That probably dropped halfway to Pomona.

73
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,648
Oh, it was nearer than that.

74
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,949
I'm gonna see. Who's coming?

75
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,753
This is Pine Summit. I got a smoke.

76
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:51,220
One-sixty, 30.

77
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,057
Azimuth reading: 160 degrees, 30 minutes.

78
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:56,793
Big?

79
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:00,630
I'll bet it's as big as anything
that ever lit in California.

80
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,198
You better get something over there.

81
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:04,681
It's started a blaze already.

82
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,107
MAN 1: Over here, man!

83
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:12,309
MAN 2: It's burning this way.

84
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,778
MAN 3: You there, with the shovel!

85
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,345
MAN 4: Quick! Fire over there!

86
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,965
MAN 1: All right. Come over
here and give us a hand!

87
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,168
MAN 2: Anyone have a flashlight?

88
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,926
Quick! Come on over here!

89
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,825
MAN 3: Let me get in there!

90
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,560
Out of the way! Out of the way!

91
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,362
MAN 4: Which way are you going? Left?

92
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,964
MAN 3: Bring that hose over here.

93
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:36,966
MAN 1: We're getting it licked, fellas.

94
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:38,201
Keep at it.

95
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:40,337
MAN 2: Hey, grab this!

96
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,773
MAN 3: Joe! Joe! Lend a hand over here!

97
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:47,277
Number three to D.O. Number three to D.O.

98
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,179
MAN: <i>D.O. to number three. Come in.</i>

99
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:50,713
We're getting this under control.

100
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,349
We won't need any more help. Over.

101
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,784
<i>Okay. Send the tanker in,</i>

102
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:57,720
<i>but you can stand by until
that thing cools off. Over.</i>

103
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,123
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.

104
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,759
<i>Well, there's some fellas
fishing at Pine Summit.</i>

105
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,928
<i>I think they're scientists.
They probably saw it come down.</i>

106
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:08,131
<i>I'll let them know. What's it look like?</i>

107
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:10,633
Can't get near enough to see it very well.

108
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:13,804
It's too hot. But it's a whale of a size.

109
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,314
I got a message for you.

110
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:27,283
You're the guys from Pacific Tech, ain't you?

111
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,686
Right.

112
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:31,388
Looks like the fishing was good.

113
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:33,289
Have some?

114
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,959
Well, I might just do that.

115
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,130
It's about that meteor.

116
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,601
They say it's a whopper.

117
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,370
The district officer phoned us

118
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,071
at the lookout up on the summit.

119
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,440
I thought you might be interested.

120
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,074
It's about ten or 12 miles from here,

121
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:53,342
over by Linda Rosa.

122
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:54,461
Are they sure it's a meteor?

123
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:56,129
It didn't come down like one.

124
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,380
That's right.

125
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,884
Came down in kind of spurts, didn't it?

126
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:02,586
Well, you fellas will have to figure it out.

127
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:03,987
You're scientists.

128
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:05,922
All I know is, they say it's as big as a house

129
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:07,523
and practically red-hot.

130
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:09,024
I'd like to borrow your car

131
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:10,426
and take a look at it in the morning.

132
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:11,527
Well, we ought to get back.

133
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:13,630
I can fly Bilderbeck down in your plane.

134
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,266
Okay. The insurance is paid up.

135
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,100
Light?

136
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,503
No, I'll smoke it later.

137
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,686
Did you watch it come down?

138
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:38,154
I seen it from our window.

139
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:39,622
WOMAN: Not just from the window.

140
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,591
The whole house lit right up.

141
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,760
Harold. Harold. Look here a minute.

142
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,295
And step over to your left,

143
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:47,129
just a little. And hold it.

144
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,364
Smile.

145
00:07:48,614 --> 00:07:50,150
It must've hit way up there

146
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,651
and then skidded along the gully.

147
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:52,953
After it stopped,

148
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,855
all that loose earth
and stuff shook down over it.

149
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:56,022
Excuse me.

150
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:57,724
I guess most of it's buried.

151
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,960
That's 12 feet thick, easy. Maybe more.

152
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,494
Meteors always run heavy.

153
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:05,498
They won't be able to haul
this one away to no museum.

154
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:08,301
It'll be a real good attraction
for Sunday drivers.

155
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:10,987
Better than a lion farm or a snake pit.

156
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:12,422
We won't have to feed it.

157
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,524
Sure. We can sell the tamales

158
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,058
and the enchiladas and the hot dogs too.

159
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:17,794
Yeah! Ice cream, cold drinks, souvenirs.

160
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,046
I think we should put up a few picnic tables.

161
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:22,783
No, no. Then they'd bring their own lunches.

162
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,335
What's the idea, Buck?

163
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,170
Gonna dig for gold?

164
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,771
You think you're kidding?

165
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:32,534
It's gonna be like having a
gold mine in our own backyard.

166
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,111
I'm gonna get a closer look at it.

167
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,647
Yes.

168
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,686
MAN 1: Reckon this is solid all through here?

169
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:46,189
MAN 2: Lucky it didn't come
down in the middle of town.

170
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:48,158
MAN 3: I wonder who owns this property.

171
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:50,226
You might be able to make a dime out of this.

172
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,562
That's it over there.

173
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:54,947
Feels pretty darn hot!

174
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:56,750
MAN: What's the idea of the shovel?

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,852
MAN 2: Be careful, Buck.
MAN 3: Yeah. Watch it, Buck.

176
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,486
MAN 4: Easy, Buck, man.

177
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:01,621
Hey!

178
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:03,089
MAN 5: That's pretty hot there.

179
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:05,191
Boy, you can feel the heat from here.

180
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:06,976
Did you see it come down?

181
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:08,645
Yes, I was fishing up in the hills.

182
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:10,813
Well, you must've caught
plenty with all that tackle.

183
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:12,048
Well, there were three of us.

184
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,371
The others flew back in my plane.

185
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,187
I don't understand why a meteor that size

186
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:18,521
didn't make a bigger crater.

187
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:20,406
Oh, it hit sideways and skidded in.

188
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:23,342
At least that's what I think.
I don't really know.

189
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:26,412
But the ranger said a scientist
is coming from Pacific Tech.

190
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:29,048
He'll tell us. Clayton Forrester.
Ever hear of him?

191
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:31,651
What's that fella trying to do, dig it out?

192
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:34,187
He's top man in astro- and nuclear physics.

193
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,123
He knows all about meteors.

194
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,941
You seem to know all about him.

195
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:41,611
Well, I did a thesis on modern scientists,

196
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:43,112
working for my master's degree.

197
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:44,647
Did it do you any good?

198
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:48,685
Why, sure. I got it.

199
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,320
Say, do you have a match?

200
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,189
No, I'm sorry, I don't smoke.

201
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,391
Forrester's the man
behind the new atomic engines.

202
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:57,293
They had him on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

203
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:59,128
You know, you've got to rate to get that.

204
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:00,896
Yeah. He isn't that good.

205
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:03,700
Well, now, how can you say that
when you don't even know him?

206
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,568
Well, I do know him. Slightly.

207
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,503
Oh, what's he like?

208
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:10,005
Well, he's like, uh...

209
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:13,210
Like, uh...

210
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,911
Oh!

211
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:17,813
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself

212
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:19,248
in that getup, Dr. Forrester.

213
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:20,983
But I'm happy to meet you anyway.

214
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,618
I'm Sylvia Van Buren.

215
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:25,120
I teach Library Science over at USC.

216
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,589
I didn't know how to stop you.

217
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,858
Well, I might've recognized you
without the beard.

218
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:31,160
And you didn't wear glasses on the <i>Time</i> cover.

219
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,828
Well, they're really for long distance.

220
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:36,631
When I want to look at something
close, I take them off.

221
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,020
Come on, get out! Get up out of there!

222
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:54,200
Boy, you could fry eggs on that thing!

223
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,770
All that sand will keep
the heat in for a long time.

224
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,606
Oh, Uncle Matthew,
this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.

225
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:03,209
My uncle, Dr. Matthew Collins,
pastor of the community church.

226
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,478
Well, I... How do you do, Dr. Forrester?

227
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:06,546
How do you do, sir?

228
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:08,916
MAN: Hey, you!

229
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,789
What you got in here, fella?

230
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,859
Ticking like a bomb.

231
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,797
This is a Geiger counter
for detecting radioactivity.

232
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:29,469
We did a little bit of surveying
while we were up in the hills.

233
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,880
It's that meteor.

234
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,731
It's radioactive?

235
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:47,004
Yes. Difficult to account
for a reaction like that.

236
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,093
Look at this thing. It's going crazy.

237
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:56,061
Maybe we ought to keep
people away from it, huh?

238
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:57,196
Might be a good idea.

239
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:58,665
I'll post two or three deputies.

240
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:00,988
They can make sure it doesn't
start any more fires too.

241
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,820
You know, that meteor's either very light,

242
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,187
which is unheard of,

243
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:07,490
or else it's hollow somehow.

244
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,158
If it were heavy and solid,

245
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:13,029
it would have made a tremendous
crater when it landed.

246
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,798
I think I'll wait around until it cools off.

247
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:17,867
If you tell me of a place in town,

248
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:19,568
I... I could clean up.

249
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:22,171
I'd be delighted if you'd stay
at my house, Dr. Forrester.

250
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:23,739
Thank you.

251
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:27,076
Probably won't be cool for another 24 hours.

252
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,345
What do people do around here on a Saturday?

253
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:30,914
They don't do much of anything.

254
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:33,277
There's a square dance
at the social hall this evening.

255
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,220
CALLER: ♫ Allemande left And the ladies star ♫

256
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,854
♫ Gents walk around But not too far ♫

257
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:40,723
♫ Allemande left And the gentlemen star ♫

258
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:42,726
♫ Ladies walk around But not too far ♫

259
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,963
♫ First and third You balance and swing ♫

260
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,764
♫ Promenade the outside ring ♫

261
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:51,400
♫ Three-quarter Round the outside ring ♫

262
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,135
♫ Through that couple And not too far ♫

263
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:54,937
♫ Meet in the center With a right-hand star ♫

264
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:56,739
♫ Swing your corner With the left hand round ♫

265
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:58,982
♫ It's once and a half
On the merry-go-round... ♫

266
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:08,686
Well, let's take another look at it.

267
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,578
Almost cold now, ain't it?

268
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:38,480
It won't start any more fires.

269
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,515
We might as well go home.

270
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:42,184
Yeah, no sense staying out here.

271
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:44,087
Let's go.

272
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:49,742
Hey,

273
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:52,279
it's moving!

274
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,363
It's a bomb.

275
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:13,365
It don't go off last night.

276
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:15,067
Maybe it's gonna go off now, huh?

277
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:18,137
It's an enemy sneak attack.
Let's get out of here.

278
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:19,271
Wait a minute.

279
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:20,474
Wait a minute.

280
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,494
Bombs don't unscrew.

281
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:28,449
It's no meteor, that's for sure.

282
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:33,519
Darnedest thing I ever saw...

283
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,042
the way that's unscrewing.

284
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,615
Thank you, Dr. Forrester. You having fun?

285
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,419
Yup. And you want to know what I was thinking?

286
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,354
If we could gather all the energy expended

287
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:52,821
in just one square dance,

288
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:55,092
we could send that meteor
back to where it came from.

289
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,090
Must be somebody in there.

290
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,459
Who?

291
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:47,893
Where do you think they come from?

292
00:15:48,143 --> 00:15:49,395
How would I know?

293
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:52,665
I read someplace Mars is
near the Earth right now.

294
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:56,602
Happens every 18, 20 years, they say.

295
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:59,004
Men from Mars.

296
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:00,673
What do you think?

297
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:03,743
Maybe these are not men. Not like us.

298
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:07,313
Everything human doesn't have
to look like you and me.

299
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:14,219
If it's men from Mars,

300
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:15,855
we ought to let them know we're friendly.

301
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:19,024
Don't fool around with something
when you don't know what it is.

302
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:21,627
We'd be the first to make
contact with them, see?

303
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:23,796
We'd be in all the papers.

304
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:25,030
How about that?

305
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,766
We could show them we're friendly, huh?

306
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:29,468
Uh, walk out there with a white flag.

307
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:33,106
Here, I-I've got an old sugar sack in my car.

308
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,853
What are we going to say to them?

309
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,838
Welcome to California.

310
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,407
Come on.

311
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:22,721
We're friends!

312
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,157
Yeah!

313
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:27,392
Hey, there. Open up.

314
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:29,144
How they gonna understand us?

315
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:31,214
We'll talk in sign language.

316
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:32,848
They'll understand us, all right.

317
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:35,685
Sure. Sure.

318
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:37,052
Everybody understands

319
00:17:37,302 --> 00:17:39,322
when you wave the white flag,
you want to be friends.

320
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:40,623
Hey, there.

321
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:41,757
Open up.

322
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:44,059
Come on out. We're friends.

323
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,146
That's right. We welcome you.

324
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:49,229
We're friends. Yeah.

325
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,438
Hey! The lights!

326
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,845
Where's the fuse box?

327
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:06,516
No smooching in the dark, folks.

328
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,851
MAN 1: Any candles around?

329
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:12,556
Hey, look, look. All the lights
in town have gone out.

330
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,079
MAN 2: Somebody's found some candles.

331
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:22,815
Zippy, call the electric company
and see what happened.

332
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:23,817
Okay.

333
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,813
ZIPPY: Hey, the phone's gone dead!

334
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:39,782
That's funny. The phone's

335
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,417
not on the same circuit as the lights.

336
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:42,752
What are they saying, honey?

337
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,154
Something's wrong with my hearing aid.

338
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:49,358
Well, we always play "Good
Night, Ladies" at 12:00 anyway.

339
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:51,027
It must be nearly that now.

340
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,796
My watch has stopped.

341
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,733
Oh, I've got the time.

342
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,035
Huh, mine's stopped too.

343
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:01,637
So has mine.

344
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:03,921
Jeepers, mine ain't working. What is this?

345
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,612
Why, they've all stopped at the same time.

346
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:14,150
There's only one explanation
for a thing like this.

347
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,619
Do you have a pin?

348
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,214
WOMAN: Oh, look!

349
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:29,648
MAN: Look!

350
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:31,116
You see that?

351
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:33,185
My watch is magnetized.

352
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:36,539
That's what knocked the phones out too.

353
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,940
How could it happen to
everybody's watch all together?

354
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,176
Do you have a pocket compass?

355
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:41,844
Yeah.

356
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,984
Hey, that needle isn't pointing north.

357
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:51,507
It's pointing to the gully
where that meteor came down.

358
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,191
All right, folks, let me
through. Let me through.

359
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,069
MAN: Sheriff, what's going on?

360
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,838
I don't know any more than you do, Joe.

361
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:12,108
Look at the fire out there!

362
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,764
MAN: Boy, is that something!
SHERIFF: Let's go see!

363
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,442
CLAYTON: The power lines are down.

364
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,645
That explains why the lights went out.

365
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,497
What...?

366
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:54,366
Hey, look at the car.

367
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:58,271
CLAYTON: Where are the three
men you left out here?

368
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,709
OFFICER: Look there!

369
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,767
People in town started to follow us.

370
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:13,870
Don't let them come anywhere near here.

371
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,020
Jump! Get under cover!

372
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:48,286
What is that gizmo?

373
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:52,225
I think that gizmo is
a machine from another planet.

374
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:56,228
We better get word to the authorities.

375
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:58,832
Look!

376
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:06,071
Sheriff, you'd better get word to the military.

377
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:07,673
You're going to need them out here.

378
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,278
OFFICER: Get moving, on the double.

379
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,948
OFFICER 2: Take cover along the riverbed!

380
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,471
Get those 30s over here.

381
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:41,073
The area is under control
of Marines from El Toro Base,

382
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:42,276
and the gully is surrounded.

383
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:43,742
Oh, and here's Professor McPherson

384
00:22:43,992 --> 00:22:45,911
of the Canadian Meteorological
Research Council.

385
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:48,080
Is it true, professor,
you've had reports of landings

386
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,848
in other places? In Canada?

387
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:51,584
Not in Canada yet,

388
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,352
but in Bordeaux, France,

389
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:54,820
some in Spain.

390
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,857
There's supposed to be one down
near the Gulf of Taranto, Italy.

391
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:01,193
We're trying to locate the second meteor

392
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:03,662
that landed in this vicinity
just about midnight.

393
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:06,298
Well, do you think they come from Mars?

394
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:08,501
What do you think, Dr. Forrester?

395
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:09,835
Oh, it's possible.

396
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:11,854
At least it seems certain
they're from some planet

397
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:14,723
other than our own.

398
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:16,291
<i>Suppose they are Martians, professor.</i>

399
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,325
<i>What would they look like?</i>

400
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:19,227
<i>Bigger than us? Smaller?</i>

401
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:21,163
McPHERSON: <i>Well, as to Martians,</i>

402
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:23,198
<i>our gravitational pull would weigh them down.</i>

403
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:25,133
<i>Our heavier air would oppress them.</i>

404
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:27,937
REPORTER: <i>Then you think they'd
be breathing creatures, like us.</i>

405
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:30,472
<i>What about the heart and blood and all that?</i>

406
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:32,107
McPHERSON: <i>Well, if they are Martians,</i>

407
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:33,642
<i>and if they do have hearts,</i>

408
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:36,178
<i>they'd almost certainly beat at a slower rate.</i>

409
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:38,480
<i>Their veins might be distended.</i>

410
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,549
CLAYTON: <i>Their senses could
be quite different from ours.</i>

411
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,687
<i>They may, for instance,
be able to smell colors.</i>

412
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:48,273
<i>Precedent in our own evolution
makes it possible</i>

413
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:50,509
<i>that they have more than one brain.</i>

414
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:52,211
REPORTER: <i>You mean two? Three?</i>

415
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:53,445
<i>Just think of that, folks.</i>

416
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:55,180
CLAYTON: <i>It's only speculation.</i>

417
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,450
REPORTER: <i>Now, Dr. Forrester,
what about these meteor machines?</i>

418
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,285
CLAYTON: <i>They're probably controlled by jets</i>

419
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:02,121
<i>after they enter our atmosphere</i>

420
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:04,923
<i>and navigated by some form
of gyroscopic mechanism.</i>

421
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:07,126
Thank you, Dr. Forrester.

422
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:09,761
Oh, colonel, can you tell us anything

423
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:11,230
about this plane that's coming over?

424
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,564
It will drop a flare.

425
00:24:12,814 --> 00:24:14,333
That's the only way we dare
put a light on them.

426
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,068
Then Air Force cameramen will get pictures.

427
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:19,104
That was Marine Colonel Ralph Heffner.

428
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:21,873
There's been a lot of mysterious
activity around the machine.

429
00:24:22,123 --> 00:24:24,776
Lights and dust, as if they're
digging themselves out.

430
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:26,479
And there it comes again!

431
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:29,531
If this keeps up,

432
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:32,201
it'll be a guide for
the plane when it comes over.

433
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,677
Is that the plane now? Yes. He's signaling.

434
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:43,211
The pilot has just blipped his motor.

435
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:44,880
That means he's dropped the flare.

436
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,182
He's flying high, so it'll
take a few seconds to come down.

437
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:48,283
When it does burst,

438
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:49,852
we shall be the first men on Earth

439
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:52,055
to get a real look
at these invaders from space.

440
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,607
They're after the plane with their ray!

441
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:14,808
Take cover! Jump for it!

442
00:25:21,502 --> 00:25:22,769
Here we are in...

443
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,271
Hey!

444
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:27,439
They cut me off!

445
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:28,908
They got my truck!

446
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,112
It looks like they're gonna come
out of that gully pretty soon.

447
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:37,048
We'll have to rush our defenses
to be ready when they do.

448
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,017
You're going to need plenty of reinforcements.

449
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,019
We'll get them.

450
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,999
OFFICER: They got the fire road blocked.

451
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,300
A truck turned over.

452
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,503
The troops are certainly moving in here.

453
00:26:31,753 --> 00:26:33,722
I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command.

454
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,390
No, I just told them the local situation.

455
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,026
Colonel Heffner's in charge.

456
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,730
Never know where you're going to wind up

457
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,331
when you go to a square dance, do you?

458
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:45,033
OFFICER: Runner? Where's a runner?

459
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:46,251
That's D-24.

460
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:49,187
MAN: Correct.

461
00:26:49,437 --> 00:26:52,024
Now, locate your observation post on this hill.

462
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:54,926
Position your recoilless 75s back here.

463
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:56,161
Carbon Canyon.

464
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:57,162
Yes, sir.

465
00:26:57,412 --> 00:26:58,830
I want your battery here.

466
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,732
You may find, at daylight, you're too exposed,

467
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:03,068
so keep your prime movers
ready to pull you out fast.

468
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:04,702
But you'll get first crack at them.

469
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:06,538
Suits me. Will that be all? Colonel Heffner?

470
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:08,607
Yes, report when you're set up.

471
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:14,012
Heffner.

472
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:15,547
Half-tracks? Okay.

473
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:18,500
Get in back of hill three.

474
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,435
Repeat, hill three.

475
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:23,638
If it's a moving target, follow up from there.

476
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:25,507
MAN 1: Number six, do you hear me? Right.

477
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:28,376
MAN 2: Anybody get a look at the Martians yet?

478
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:31,513
They've located that second meteor.

479
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:33,648
MAN 3: What's your range?

480
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:36,317
Mark it up.

481
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,136
MAN 4: Weapons truck turned over on the road.

482
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:39,137
Take action and report.

483
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:41,339
Company tactical net out of action.

484
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:42,541
No radio.

485
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45,210
MAN 3: Three. One. Eight. Zero.

486
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,212
There's one, there's the other.

487
00:27:47,462 --> 00:27:48,880
Here we are right between them.

488
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,583
So is the town, I notice.

489
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,552
I warned them to be ready
if they have to evacuate.

490
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:54,786
I just came to tell you

491
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:55,954
everyone has been alerted.

492
00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:58,056
Hup! OFFICER: As you were.

493
00:27:58,306 --> 00:27:59,557
General Mann. I was told to expect you, sir.

494
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:00,558
I'm Colonel Heffner.

495
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:01,826
I'm here to make up a report,

496
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:03,828
not to interfere with
the operations you've set up.

497
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:04,829
You're still in command.

498
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,231
Clayton Forrester.

499
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:07,599
I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.

500
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:08,700
Good to see you, general.

501
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,302
Oh, this is Pastor Collins. Hi, sir.

502
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:12,404
Sheriff Bogany, head of local control. Sure.

503
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:13,772
Miss Van Buren.

504
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:15,307
Miss Van Buren. How do you do, general?

505
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:17,008
Would you care for some coffee? Thank you.

506
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:19,511
General Mann is in charge of Intelligence

507
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:21,797
for the Pacific area.

508
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:23,198
That's their position.

509
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,500
Well, you've certainly got them surrounded.

510
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,570
I suppose they've neutralized
all communications here.

511
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,938
Not all, sir.

512
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:31,807
Radio's out but our field
phones are okay so far.

513
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:34,443
Well, they'll go the minute
there's another heat ray.

514
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,545
"Cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach."

515
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:38,046
Well, that's a job for the Navy.

516
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:39,214
Any news from abroad?

517
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:40,549
Washington is in constant touch

518
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,251
with the military of other nations.

519
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,320
Apparently, they're coming down all over.

520
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,123
South America. Santiago has two cylinders.

521
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:51,226
They're outside London.

522
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:53,328
They're in Naples.

523
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:55,630
We've got them between here and Fresno,

524
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,232
outside Sacramento,

525
00:28:57,482 --> 00:28:58,500
two on Long Island.

526
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,185
They're just coming down at random.

527
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:01,787
No.

528
00:29:02,037 --> 00:29:04,389
According to information from foreign sources,

529
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:07,292
they're working to some kind of a plan.

530
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,261
Now, what it may be isn't clear yet,

531
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:11,646
simply because once they begin to move,

532
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:15,351
no more news comes out of that area.

533
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:21,039
GENERAL MANN: We've been getting
reports of destruction, massacre.

534
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:22,707
Here's an instance:

535
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:24,576
"Town of Saint-Julien, south of Bordeaux,

536
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:26,778
"wiped out by ray of undetermined nature.

537
00:29:27,028 --> 00:29:29,481
Local reports say nothing remains."

538
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:31,316
Nothing remains. What do you make of that?

539
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:33,117
All we've seen is the heat ray they use.

540
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,019
Well, some of our newest weapons are in here.

541
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:36,421
We want to be sure to stop them.

542
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:37,656
We will, sir.

543
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,741
Now, from the data from that picture

544
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:41,943
the Air Force took earlier tonight,

545
00:29:42,193 --> 00:29:45,580
what we've got out there
is the original pilot ship.

546
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,282
On the basis of its observations,

547
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:49,384
the others were guided down.

548
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:52,387
Pattern-wise, one lands, then two,

549
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:54,889
making groups of threes, joined magnetically.

550
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:56,958
Is that possible? If they do it, it is.

551
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:58,293
My orders are not to go into action

552
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:00,395
unless they move out of
the shelter of that gully.

553
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:02,731
Meanwhile, we'll have a chance to observe them.

554
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:05,166
Now, this is the only place
we've had time to surround them

555
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:06,901
with sufficient force to contain them.

556
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:10,204
What happens here will be
a guide to all other operations.

557
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:11,473
Now, the minute action begins

558
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,441
and a pattern of defense develops,

559
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,578
I'll get my report to Washington.

560
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,146
You've deployed your forces well.

561
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:19,147
Thank you, sir.

562
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:20,148
If they start anything,

563
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:22,016
we can blast them right off the Earth.

564
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:26,921
OFFICER: Mortar company,
all units set and ready.

565
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:31,326
Seventy-five, all units set and ready.

566
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:34,397
They'll probably move at dawn.

567
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:17,348
There's something moving in the gully.

568
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:53,740
Look at it, will you?

569
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,545
Beings from another world.

570
00:32:05,188 --> 00:32:06,620
Is that some kind of a flying machine?

571
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,189
No, no. It's supported from the ground by rays,

572
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,525
probably some form of magnetic flux,

573
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:13,260
like invisible legs.

574
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,463
This is amazing.

575
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:18,565
They must keep the opposing poles in balance

576
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:20,901
and lift the machine.

577
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:23,071
Stand by to fire.

578
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:27,375
All command posts, stand by to fire.

579
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:36,182
But, colonel, shooting's no good.

580
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,418
It's always been a good persuader.

581
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:40,587
Shouldn't you try to
communicate with them first

582
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:43,358
and shoot later if you have to?

583
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:10,250
OFFICER 1: Target as indicated.

584
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,254
Repeat, target as indicated.

585
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:20,727
OFFICER 2: The 75s report

586
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:22,396
they've got them under open sights, sir.

587
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:24,731
I think we should try to make them understand

588
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:26,333
we mean them no harm.

589
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:29,136
There's another machine coming out.

590
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,630
They are living creatures out there.

591
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,431
But they're not human.

592
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:42,566
Dr. Forrester says

593
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:44,334
they're some kind of advanced civilization.

594
00:33:44,584 --> 00:33:46,770
If they're more advanced than us,

595
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,005
they should be nearer the Creator

596
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:50,874
for that reason.

597
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:52,342
OFFICER 3: It'll be a moving target.

598
00:33:52,592 --> 00:33:54,945
Prepare to follow up.

599
00:33:57,517 --> 00:34:01,652
No real attempt has been made to
communicate with them, you know?

600
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:04,271
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.

601
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:08,492
I've done all I can in there. You go back.

602
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:12,629
Sylvia, I like that Dr. Forrester.

603
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,798
He's a good man.

604
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:16,633
OFFICER 3: Attention, all batteries,

605
00:34:16,883 --> 00:34:18,669
prepare for volley fire.

606
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:22,006
Repeat, prepare for volley fire.

607
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:42,626
COLONEL: Who's that?

608
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:49,918
What does he think he's doing?

609
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,754
Uncle! Uncle Matthew!

610
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:55,255
It's too late now. He's too far away.

611
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:56,857
Stop him!

612
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:58,542
Though I walk through the valley

613
00:34:58,792 --> 00:34:59,643
of the shadow of death,

614
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:01,678
I will fear no evil.

615
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:04,548
Stop him!

616
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:06,584
It's seen him.

617
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,991
Thou anointest my head with oil.

618
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:15,960
My cup runneth over.

619
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:26,353
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

620
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:34,628
Let 'em have it!

621
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:35,463
Fire!

622
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,669
Those shells can't get through to them.

623
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:02,488
They've put out some sort
of electromagnetic covering,

624
00:36:02,738 --> 00:36:04,292
a protective blister.

625
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:19,699
That skeleton beam must be what they used

626
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:20,917
to wipe out the French city.

627
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:22,619
It neutralizes mesons somehow.

628
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:25,104
They're the atomic glue
holding matter together.

629
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:27,157
Cut across their lines of magnetic force,

630
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:29,776
and any object will simply cease to exist.

631
00:37:30,026 --> 00:37:31,678
Take my word for it, general.

632
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:34,781
This type of defense is useless
against that type of power.

633
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:37,384
You'd better let Washington know. Fast!

634
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:41,405
Hold 'em as long as you can. Right, sir.

635
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:56,971
Aarggh!

636
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:06,663
Order all command posts.

637
00:38:06,913 --> 00:38:09,583
Everything pulled back north
of highway 60 tunnel bunker!

638
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:10,951
Right.

639
00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:21,812
Aarrggh!

640
00:38:40,216 --> 00:38:42,815
Everybody out of here! Everybody out!

641
00:38:43,065 --> 00:38:45,452
The Air Force will take care
of these babies now.

642
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,487
Dr. Forrester, get out of here!

643
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:49,940
Everybody, out of here! Everybody...

644
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,942
Aarggh!

645
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:22,022
You'll hit something. Can't you go higher?

646
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,407
No, the air will be full of jets in a minute.

647
00:39:24,657 --> 00:39:25,570
There they are.

648
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:17,377
WOMAN: All about the Martian invasion!

649
00:40:17,627 --> 00:40:19,679
They're in New York and Miama!

650
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:22,899
Fighting outside Los Angeles!

651
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:24,669
All about it!

652
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:46,106
Hold it right there, general, please.

653
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:47,791
You're the gentlemen I asked to come here.

654
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:50,326
Get Washington. What do you think of this?

655
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:51,461
MAN: Clear the way.

656
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:53,129
Is it your opinion the Army can hold them?

657
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:54,631
Sorry, I have no time.

658
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:57,133
You've got guns and equipment
going out there all night.

659
00:40:57,383 --> 00:41:00,604
Come on. Break it up.

660
00:41:00,854 --> 00:41:03,006
The way he's hedging,
maybe the Army didn't hold them.

661
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:04,941
I've seen news off the Pacific cables:

662
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:06,209
Sydney, Australia.

663
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:07,744
Pinang. Rangoon, India.

664
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:10,013
From what's coming through,
nobody's stopped them yet.

665
00:41:10,263 --> 00:41:12,632
I want to know, if the city must be evacuated...

666
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:15,435
We're ready. Lots of people
have already moved out.

667
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:17,771
We've mobilized emergency cars
and buses in the yards.

668
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:19,539
The Red Cross is standing by.

669
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:20,557
Now, for your information,

670
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:22,992
the enemy is 25 or 30 miles
outside Los Angeles.

671
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:25,127
Not down in full force yet, but developing.

672
00:41:25,377 --> 00:41:26,563
It can happen any minute.

673
00:41:26,813 --> 00:41:27,731
The crisis will come

674
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:29,399
if they move toward the metropolitan area.

675
00:41:29,649 --> 00:41:31,934
Now, we've got to...
Washington is on the line, sir.

676
00:41:32,184 --> 00:41:34,271
General Mann.

677
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,139
I'd say our effective losses

678
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:40,243
were nearly 60 percent men,
90 percent materiel.

679
00:41:40,493 --> 00:41:43,246
Well, the jets went in,
but not one of them came out.

680
00:41:43,496 --> 00:41:45,648
High-level bombers dropped
everything they can carry.

681
00:41:45,898 --> 00:41:48,251
They were knocked out
of the sky. Bombs did nothing.

682
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:49,735
Nothing was effective against them.

683
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:52,538
Yes, they have some sort
of electronic umbrella.

684
00:41:52,788 --> 00:41:53,940
It's quite impenetrable.

685
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,009
Dr. Forrester believes
they generate atomic force

686
00:41:56,259 --> 00:41:57,577
without the heavy screening we use.

687
00:41:57,827 --> 00:42:00,348
That's where they get the power for their rays.

688
00:42:02,118 --> 00:42:03,716
Very well, sir. Call Victorville.

689
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:05,618
Tell them I want the fastest plane they've got.

690
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:07,988
You'll get further instructions
from Sixth Army Command.

691
00:42:08,238 --> 00:42:09,722
I'll make a statement to those reporters.

692
00:42:09,972 --> 00:42:11,325
Right.

693
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:19,132
All right, fellas.
The general will see you now.

694
00:42:19,382 --> 00:42:21,634
General, we heard that Dr. Clayton Forrester

695
00:42:21,884 --> 00:42:22,919
was out there with you.

696
00:42:23,169 --> 00:42:24,353
What's he think about this?

697
00:42:24,603 --> 00:42:26,539
Ask him. He's back at Pacific Tech.

698
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:28,708
No, he's not. We tried to get him there.

699
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:29,991
He hasn't shown up.

700
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:32,022
Wake up.

701
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:39,530
Let's get moving, huh?

702
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,150
Are you all right?

703
00:43:47,707 --> 00:43:49,188
Is that machine...? It's gone.

704
00:43:49,438 --> 00:43:52,024
And where are we?
Southwest of Corona somewhere.

705
00:43:52,274 --> 00:43:54,226
There must have been
another cylinder down here.

706
00:43:54,476 --> 00:43:57,897
They've been through this whole
area and cleared everybody out.

707
00:43:58,147 --> 00:43:59,466
There's a farmhouse out there.

708
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:03,003
Let's see if we can find something to eat, huh?

709
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:13,079
We're doing all right.

710
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:15,616
You know, I almost forgot when I ate last.

711
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:19,820
Hey, that looks good.

712
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,388
You know, mostly I get my meals

713
00:44:22,638 --> 00:44:24,124
in coffee shops and restaurants.

714
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:25,558
Don't you live at home?

715
00:44:25,808 --> 00:44:26,726
No, on the campus.

716
00:44:26,976 --> 00:44:28,894
I haven't any family.

717
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:31,131
I come from a big one.

718
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:35,134
There's nine of us.
All in Minnesota... except me.

719
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:37,520
I have no close folks.

720
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,423
My parents died when I was a kid.

721
00:44:40,673 --> 00:44:43,426
A big family must be fun. I imagine...

722
00:44:43,676 --> 00:44:45,928
I imagine it makes you feel
you belong to something.

723
00:44:46,178 --> 00:44:49,082
Oh, it does. Maybe that's why
I feel kind of lost right now.

724
00:44:49,332 --> 00:44:51,785
We'll get out of here safely.

725
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:54,487
Don't worry.

726
00:44:54,737 --> 00:44:57,023
But they seem to murder everything that moves.

727
00:44:57,273 --> 00:45:00,627
If they're mortal, they must
have mortal weaknesses.

728
00:45:00,877 --> 00:45:03,798
They'll be stopped. Somehow.

729
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:06,583
I've been as close to them as anyone,

730
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,585
and never close enough
for any real observation.

731
00:45:08,835 --> 00:45:12,155
I feel like I did one time when I was small,

732
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:15,057
awful scared and lonesome.

733
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:19,028
I'd wandered off. I've forgotten why.

734
00:45:19,278 --> 00:45:21,898
But the family and whole crowds of neighbors

735
00:45:22,148 --> 00:45:23,766
were hunting for me.

736
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:27,036
They found me in a church.

737
00:45:27,286 --> 00:45:29,873
I was afraid to go in anyplace else.

738
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:33,409
I stayed right by that door,

739
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:35,044
praying for the one who loved me best

740
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:37,047
to come and find me.

741
00:45:41,854 --> 00:45:44,121
It was Uncle Matthew who found me.

742
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,107
I liked him.

743
00:45:47,993 --> 00:45:49,927
He liked you.

744
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,962
Oh, I could bawl my head off.

745
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:55,581
But you're not going to. You're not the kind.

746
00:45:55,831 --> 00:45:58,284
Look, you're tired. You've been up all night.

747
00:45:58,534 --> 00:46:00,687
You cracked up in a plane, slept in a ditch.

748
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:03,256
You wanna know something?

749
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,694
It doesn't show on you at all.

750
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:21,525
Get down!

751
00:46:56,795 --> 00:46:58,660
How long was I out? Hours.

752
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,162
Oh, I've been so scared.

753
00:47:00,412 --> 00:47:01,563
They're right outside.

754
00:47:01,813 --> 00:47:04,201
Several of them came down together.

755
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,871
There's a machine standing
right alongside of us.

756
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:45,652
Electronic eye.

757
00:48:45,902 --> 00:48:47,922
Like a television camera.

758
00:48:50,726 --> 00:48:52,993
It's looking for us.

759
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:22,722
Maybe they're not too sure we're here.

760
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:30,663
They could be as curious
about us as we are about them.

761
00:49:30,913 --> 00:49:32,666
Maybe.

762
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:37,104
Maybe they want to take us alive.

763
00:49:50,252 --> 00:49:51,985
It's pulling out.

764
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,136
Can't we get out of here?

765
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:13,139
Shh...

766
00:50:22,867 --> 00:50:25,402
Something moved out there.

767
00:50:26,872 --> 00:50:28,270
There's nothing there now.

768
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,473
It was one of them.

769
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:31,673
What was it like?

770
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:34,326
I couldn't see much in the dark,
but it was one.

771
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:35,528
We're right in a nest of them.

772
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:38,431
I've got to get a good look at them.

773
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,126
They've blocked it.

774
00:50:50,376 --> 00:50:51,961
It's blocked here too.

775
00:50:52,211 --> 00:50:55,965
They've pushed earth or
something all around outside.

776
00:50:56,215 --> 00:50:57,633
Here. This way.

777
00:50:57,883 --> 00:51:00,070
The stairway up to the attic.

778
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,927
Look out!

779
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:54,668
Your scarf.

780
00:52:56,638 --> 00:52:58,738
It's wet.

781
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:04,344
Blood.

782
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:09,247
No! No! No!

783
00:53:09,497 --> 00:53:10,449
Stop it!

784
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:13,153
Stop it! Stop it! No, please! No blood!

785
00:53:43,218 --> 00:53:45,819
We gotta make a run for it. Come on.

786
00:53:53,528 --> 00:53:55,494
NARRATOR: <i>The Martians had

<i>which swept into all corners of the world.</i>

795
00:54:11,193 --> 00:54:12,344
<i>In every country,</i>

796
00:54:12,594 --> 00:54:14,513
<i>government officials met in desperate conclave,</i>

797

800
00:54:23,455 --> 00:54:24,873
<i>met in a railroad coach,</i>

801

<i>Chinese battalions and Bolivians</i>

806
00:54:36,718 --> 00:54:38,854

809
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:45,712
<i>ended in the same frantic rout.</i>

810
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,400
<i>As the Martians burnt fields and forests</i>

811
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,252
<i>and great cities fell before them,</i>

812
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:56,371
<i>huge populations were driven from their homes.</i>

813
00:54:56,621 --> 00:54:59,892
<i>A stream of flight rose swiftly to a torrent.</i>

814
00:55:00,142 --> 00:55:03,596
<i>It became a giant stampede
without order and without goal.</i>

815
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:07,299
<i>It was the beginning
of the rout of civilization,</i>

816
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:09,319
<i>of the massacre of humanity.</i>

817
00:55:15,177 --> 00:55:17,943
<i>A great silence fell over half of Europe</i>

818
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:21,147
<i>as all communication was disrupted.</i>

819
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:24,249
<i>When the last wire photo out of Paris</i>

820
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:26,819
<i>reached the French cabinet,
exiled in Strasbourg,</i>

821
00:55:27,069 --> 00:55:30,723
<i>they hit upon the idea of using
super-speed jets as couriers.</i>

822
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:33,959
<i>Stripped of armament
and loaded with extra fuel,</i>

823
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:35,728
<i>these planes maintained connection</i>

824
00:55:35,978 --> 00:55:37,129
<i>with the Scandinavian countries,</i>

825
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:39,131
<i>North Africa, the United States,</i>

826
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:41,400
<i>and especially with England.</i>

827
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,836
<i>It was plain the Martians appreciated</i>

828
00:55:44,086 --> 00:55:47,873
<i>the strategic significance
of the British Isles.</i>

829
00:55:48,123 --> 00:55:51,177
<i>The people of Britain
met the invaders magnificently,</i>

830
00:55:51,427 --> 00:55:54,180
<i>but it was unavailing.</i>

831
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,432
<i>As Martians swept northward toward London,</i>

832
00:55:56,682 --> 00:55:58,300
<i>the British cabinet stayed in session,</i>

833
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,169
<i>coordinating every item of information</i>

834
00:56:01,419 --> 00:56:02,738
<i>that could be gathered,</i>

835
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:05,908
<i>passing it on to
the United Nations in New York.</i>

836
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:08,511
<i>From there, the news
was forwarded to Washington,</i>

837
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:11,046
<i>because here was the only remaining</i>

838
00:56:11,296 --> 00:56:13,282
<i>unassailed strategic point.</i>

839
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:15,284
MAN 1: Forty-eight north, two west.

840
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:17,686
MAN 2: Thirty-one east. Anchored on Cairo.

841
00:56:17,936 --> 00:56:19,988
MAN 1: Checking. Dover blanked out.

842
00:56:20,238 --> 00:56:22,024
MAN 2: Brazil, checking.

843
00:56:22,274 --> 00:56:25,529
MAN: <i>Urgent.
Major Bentley Dawson, report to General Mann.</i>

844
00:56:29,902 --> 00:56:32,267
MAN 1: Eighty west by 38 north.

845
00:56:32,517 --> 00:56:34,236
MAN 2: Twenty-two south? Okay.

846
00:56:34,486 --> 00:56:37,279
MAN 3: Make every effort to
contact the civil authorities...

847
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,581
Now, this much is certain:

848
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:46,816
It's vital to prevent

849
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:48,784
the Martian machines from linking up.

850
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:52,321
Once they do, they adopt an
extraordinary military tactic.

851
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:54,890
They form a crescent.

852
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,161
They anchor it at one end and sweep on,

853
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:01,263
until they've cleared a quadrant.

854
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:04,149
Then they anchor the opposite end

855
00:57:04,399 --> 00:57:06,785
and reverse direction.

856
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:10,155
They slash across country like scythes,

857
00:57:10,405 --> 00:57:12,458
wiping out everything that's
trying to get away from them.

858
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:14,159
That explains why communication is cut

859
00:57:14,409 --> 00:57:15,761
the moment their machines begin moving.

860
00:57:16,011 --> 00:57:17,996
Montreal's blacked out.

861
00:57:18,246 --> 00:57:19,265
Nothing more's come through.

862
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:21,099
Same thing that happened on the Pacific coast.

863
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:23,135
Anything from them yet? No, Mr. Secretary.

864
00:57:23,385 --> 00:57:25,704
We've had nothing from San
Francisco for over five hours.

865
00:57:25,954 --> 00:57:29,457
Excuse me, gentlemen. Here's
that Los Angeles picture, sir.

866
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:32,127
This is a sonic radar picture
taken from extreme altitude.

867
00:57:32,377 --> 00:57:33,595
It shows full details

868
00:57:33,845 --> 00:57:35,664
of the Martian nest outside Los Angeles.

869
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:39,534
Their machines appear as round blobs.

870
00:57:39,784 --> 00:57:41,970
Newly fallen cylinders are elongated.

871
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,371
Mm-hm.

872
00:57:43,621 --> 00:57:45,808
We know there are three cylinders to each group

873
00:57:46,058 --> 00:57:48,144
and three machines to each cylinder.

874
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:56,519
All right. I've seen enough.

875
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,905
There's only one thing
that'll stop the Martians.

876
00:58:01,155 --> 00:58:02,374
We've held back because of the danger

877
00:58:02,624 --> 00:58:04,009
of radiation to civilians.

878
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:06,278
Now there's no choice.

879
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:09,314
The White House will confirm
an order to use the atom bomb.

880
00:58:09,564 --> 00:58:11,049
Then our first target will be

881
00:58:11,299 --> 00:58:13,585
the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

882
00:58:13,835 --> 00:58:15,053
First thing you get there,

883
00:58:15,303 --> 00:58:17,589
arrange for the Pacific Tech
scientists to monitor the drop.

884
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,057
I'll send wire orders ahead of you

885
00:58:19,307 --> 00:58:21,194
and have the area clear all round.

886
00:58:23,731 --> 00:58:27,065
We've still time to hit them before dark.

887
00:58:27,315 --> 00:58:30,903
Then we'll blast them all over the world.

888
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:39,244
Forrester, everybody's been looking for you.

889
00:58:39,494 --> 00:58:41,113
I know. We've walked halfway from Corona.

890
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:43,248
Finally found an abandoned truck.

891
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:44,950
This is Miss Van Buren.

892
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,320
Dr. Gratzman, Dr. Pryor. James, Bilderbeck.

893
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,721
What's this I hear about the A-bomb?

894
00:58:49,971 --> 00:58:51,256
We've been assigned as special detail.

895
00:58:51,506 --> 00:58:53,258
We're going in right
afterwards, study its effect.

896
00:58:53,508 --> 00:58:54,626
We're leaving in half an hour.

897
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:56,628
What's that? King-size fish eye?

898
00:58:56,878 --> 00:58:58,196
This is an electronic eye.

899
00:58:58,446 --> 00:59:00,766
The Martians modeled it after their own eye.

900
00:59:01,016 --> 00:59:03,201
They use it the way we use a periscope.

901
00:59:03,451 --> 00:59:04,402
It'll tell us a lot

902
00:59:04,652 --> 00:59:05,520
about their metals and alloys.

903
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,155
If this is actually a lens,

904
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:09,057
we can find out about their optics.

905
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:10,759
Interesting. Very interesting.

906
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:12,527
And this...

907
00:59:12,777 --> 00:59:15,298
The blood of a Martian.

908
00:59:16,735 --> 00:59:19,735
WOMAN: I don't remember
ever seeing blood crystals

909
00:59:19,985 --> 00:59:22,270
as anemic as these.

910
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,910
They may be mental giants,
but by our standards,

911
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,147
physically they must be very primitive.

912
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:34,483
Isn't it curious how everything about them

913
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:36,318
seems to be in threes?

914
00:59:36,568 --> 00:59:37,719
Their eyes have three lenses,

915
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:40,589
three distinct pupils.
A strong light shocks them.

916
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:41,890
They're not accustomed to it.

917
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,459
Sunlight on Mars

918
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:45,727
is approximately half as strong as we get it.

919
00:59:45,977 --> 00:59:47,762
Add their clouds and dust,

920
00:59:48,012 --> 00:59:51,368
it amounts to no more than our twilight.

921
00:59:52,738 --> 00:59:55,338
Now, if you'll step over here, please.

922
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:58,007
We've rigged the epidiascope

923
00:59:58,257 --> 01:00:01,044
to reflect whatever the Martian lens picks up.

924
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:07,651
Move in a little. Thank you.

925
01:00:40,718 --> 01:00:42,218
There's how the Martians see us.

926
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:58,535
Evidently there's a shift in their spectrum.

927
01:01:00,672 --> 01:01:03,873
Their color absorption
must be different from ours.

928
01:01:10,515 --> 01:01:12,081
Let's see why they were so curious about you,

929
01:01:12,331 --> 01:01:13,817
Miss Van Buren.

930
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,409
Time to get started, gentlemen.

931
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:26,412
Let's go.

932
01:01:29,017 --> 01:01:30,599
That Martian blood,

933
01:01:30,849 --> 01:01:32,867
let them make a quick analysis
of it to see what we've got.

934
01:01:33,117 --> 01:01:34,203
It might give us something.

935
01:01:34,453 --> 01:01:35,537
Something we could use.

936
01:01:35,787 --> 01:01:36,771
Oh, let it go.

937
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:38,340
If you're interested in Martian blood,

938
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,783
you'll get all you want right
after the plane drops the bomb.

939
01:01:41,879 --> 01:01:44,330
The Flying Wing is gonna carry it.

940
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:55,456
Hello, tower,

941
01:01:55,706 --> 01:01:57,926
this is Air Force Flying Wing,
ready for takeoff, over.

942
01:01:58,176 --> 01:01:59,727
<i>Flying Wing, this is the tower.</i>

943
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:01,229
<i>Clear for take-off, over.</i>

944
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:05,201
Wish us luck, roger.

945
01:02:30,862 --> 01:02:32,494
The target for the A-bomb

946
01:02:32,744 --> 01:02:35,697
is this nest of Martian
machines in the Puente Hills,

947
01:02:35,947 --> 01:02:37,499
where more of these meteor-cylinders

948
01:02:37,749 --> 01:02:39,468
came down early last evening.

949
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:41,769
A plane will pinpoint the target for the drop

950
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:43,472
from six miles up.

951
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:46,741
Now, we've been warned that this
bomb is ten times more powerful

952
01:02:46,991 --> 01:02:48,960
than anything previously used.

953
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,396
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.

954
01:02:51,646 --> 01:02:53,998
Nothing like this
has ever been exploded before,

955
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:56,334
and we're gonna be pretty darn close.

956
01:02:56,584 --> 01:02:59,571
But there are observers down in
the valley in a forward bunker.

957
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,073
Well, they'll be a lot nearer than us.

958
01:03:02,323 --> 01:03:04,142
The whole world is waiting,

959
01:03:04,392 --> 01:03:07,045
for this will decide the fate of civilization

960
01:03:07,295 --> 01:03:09,047
and all humanity.

961
01:03:09,297 --> 01:03:13,518
Whether we live or die may
depend on what happens here.

962
01:03:13,768 --> 01:03:15,287
MAN: <i>Attention, please.</i>

963
01:03:15,537 --> 01:03:18,656
<i>Four minutes to bomb time.</i>

964
01:03:18,906 --> 01:03:21,793
REPORTER: There must be a couple
of million people back of us

965
01:03:22,043 --> 01:03:25,330
in the shelter of the San
Gabriel hills, waiting.

966
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,400
Waiting to find out whether
they can go home again.

967
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,469
Everywhere, all around the world,

968
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:32,504
people have been driven from their homes.

969
01:03:32,754 --> 01:03:34,038
Direct cable communication

970
01:03:34,288 --> 01:03:36,007
is being maintained with Washington,

971
01:03:36,257 --> 01:03:38,143
but there's no radio at all.

972
01:03:38,393 --> 01:03:41,713
Not even with the bombing plane
that's coming over.

973
01:03:41,963 --> 01:03:44,916
All radio is dead.

974
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:48,269
Which means that these
tape recordings I'm making

975
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:52,508
are for the sake of future history... if any.

976
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:56,061
"Future history," he said.

977
01:03:57,999 --> 01:03:59,932
Yes, if any.

978
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:12,577
Bilderbeck has calculated how long we have got

979
01:04:12,827 --> 01:04:15,146
until Martians take over the entire world.

980
01:04:15,396 --> 01:04:17,865
BILDERBECK: If the A-bomb fails, that is.

981
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:22,053
The Martians can conquer the Earth in six days.

982
01:04:22,303 --> 01:04:25,141
The same number of days it took to create it.

983
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:33,231
MAN: <i>Attention, please.</i>

984
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:35,433
<i>Two minutes to bomb time.</i>

985
01:04:35,683 --> 01:04:37,570
<i>Prepare to take shelter.</i>

986
01:04:39,523 --> 01:04:42,223
<i>If you have no goggles, turn away.</i>

987
01:04:42,473 --> 01:04:45,226
<i>Remember, the heat flash
and compression that follow</i>

988
01:04:45,476 --> 01:04:46,662
<i>are dangerous.</i>

989
01:05:02,029 --> 01:05:04,080
<i>Fifty seconds.</i>

990
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:08,284
There's the plane. Right.

991
01:05:09,553 --> 01:05:11,754
<i>Forty seconds.</i>

992
01:05:14,492 --> 01:05:16,993
We've sighted the plane, sir. Right.

993
01:05:19,497 --> 01:05:21,096
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

994
01:05:21,346 --> 01:05:24,599
Look. Look!

995
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:27,736
CLAYTON: They're using those
protective blisters again.

996
01:05:27,986 --> 01:05:29,404
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

997
01:05:29,654 --> 01:05:31,807
<i>Attention. Stand by.</i>

998
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:34,126
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

999
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:38,246
Ten seconds.

1000
01:05:38,496 --> 01:05:45,186
Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five...

1001
01:05:45,436 --> 01:05:50,243
<i>Four... Three... Two... One...</i>

1002
01:06:22,693 --> 01:06:24,208
Hello!

1003
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:26,429
Hello. Hello, there. What can you see?

1004
01:06:36,424 --> 01:06:37,773
There's something moving!

1005
01:06:49,086 --> 01:06:51,070
They haven't even been touched!

1006
01:07:01,332 --> 01:07:02,764
It didn't stop them.

1007
01:07:03,014 --> 01:07:07,085
Guns, tanks, bombs,
they're like toys against them!

1008
01:07:07,335 --> 01:07:10,873
It'll end only one way. We're beaten.

1009
01:07:11,776 --> 01:07:13,875
No.

1010
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:16,011
Not yet.

1011
01:07:17,815 --> 01:07:19,180
Washington issued orders.

1012
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:20,681
In event the A-bomb failed,

1013
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:22,617
evacuate all cities in danger of attack.

1014
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:24,836
They'll be moving on Los Angeles now.

1015
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:26,104
We'll establish a line

1016
01:07:26,354 --> 01:07:29,741
and fight them all the way
back to the mountains.

1017
01:07:29,991 --> 01:07:33,361
Our best hope lies in what you
people can develop to help us.

1018
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:36,464
All right, on the double. Get me back
to Sixth Army headquarters. Hurry up!

1019
01:07:36,714 --> 01:07:39,300
Six days, you said?

1020
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:41,702
Six days.

1021
01:07:41,952 --> 01:07:43,739
They'll stamp the city flat.

1022
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:48,743
We'll take all our instruments

1023
01:07:48,993 --> 01:07:51,412
and establish a base laboratory
in the Rocky Mountains.

1024
01:07:51,662 --> 01:07:52,680
It'll give us time to search out

1025
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,149
some weakness in the Martians.

1026
01:07:54,399 --> 01:07:56,684
Forlorn hope, but there is a chance.

1027
01:07:56,934 --> 01:07:58,887
We may get a lead from that anemic blood.

1028
01:07:59,137 --> 01:08:01,555
You mean by some biological approach?

1029
01:08:01,805 --> 01:08:04,760
We know now that we can't beat their machines.

1030
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:07,763
We've got to beat them.

1031
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:25,330
MAN: <i>Everybody, listen carefully.</i>

1032
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,832
<i>The Martians are coming this way.</i>

1033
01:08:28,082 --> 01:08:30,101
<i>We must evacuate the city.</i>

1034
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:33,572
<i>Take food and water
and extra clothing with you.</i>

1035
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:36,558
<i>All major highways have been marked</i>

1036
01:08:36,808 --> 01:08:38,643
<i>to lead you to shelter and welfare centers</i>

1037
01:08:38,893 --> 01:08:39,745
<i>in the hills.</i>

1038
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,989
Come on. Come on.

1039
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:52,590
Keep going.

1040
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,094
Keep going. Keep moving.

1041
01:09:00,101 --> 01:09:02,684
Keep them rolling, there.

1042
01:09:02,934 --> 01:09:06,572
Keep going. Come on. Come on!

1043
01:10:13,491 --> 01:10:15,923
Gratzman, did you get those biotics?

1044
01:10:16,173 --> 01:10:17,925
No. I thought you had them.

1045
01:10:18,175 --> 01:10:19,294
Never mind, I'll get them.

1046
01:10:19,544 --> 01:10:22,731
You get in the school bus.
Sylvia will drive you.

1047
01:11:41,562 --> 01:11:43,778
Let me up.

1048
01:11:44,028 --> 01:11:45,112
Get off, buster!

1049
01:11:45,362 --> 01:11:46,881
I'll give you $500 for your place.

1050
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:48,817
I'll make it a thousand.

1051
01:11:49,067 --> 01:11:51,003
Money's no good anymore, Mac!

1052
01:11:58,145 --> 01:12:00,811
MAN 1: Here comes another truck!

1053
01:12:01,061 --> 01:12:02,546
MAN 2: Throw that guy off there!

1054
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:04,116
Get him out of there!

1055
01:12:05,152 --> 01:12:06,417
Stop, you fools!

1056
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:08,002
Get over! Butt out!

1057
01:12:08,252 --> 01:12:11,006
Come on. Can't you fools...?

1058
01:12:34,114 --> 01:12:35,746
Quick, help me! We've got to stop them!

1059
01:12:35,996 --> 01:12:37,648
We can't stop them. The law's no good here now.

1060
01:12:37,898 --> 01:12:39,050
They're thieves, robbers, worse.

1061
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,519
Wouldn't leave with the rest.
It's like this all over.

1062
01:12:41,769 --> 01:12:44,640
They've gotta be stopped! Those instruments!

1063
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:53,432
Hold it! Hold it a minute!

1064
01:12:55,052 --> 01:12:57,117
We've gotta get those instruments.

1065
01:12:57,367 --> 01:12:58,738
They're our only chance!

1066
01:13:23,714 --> 01:13:26,480
Did that mob grab the trucks ahead of me?

1067
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:28,516
There were Pacific Tech
people with those trucks.

1068
01:13:28,766 --> 01:13:29,717
Did you see them?

1069
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:31,385
I don't know anything about other trucks.

1070
01:13:31,635 --> 01:13:33,054
There's been fighting on all the streets.

1071
01:13:33,304 --> 01:13:35,190
The school bus. A girl was
driving. Did they get that?

1072
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,675
If they saw it, they took it.
They'll grab anything on wheels.

1073
01:13:37,925 --> 01:13:40,846
You can't buy a ride for love or money.

1074
01:14:47,315 --> 01:14:51,315
Gratzman! Bilderbeck!

1075
01:14:51,565 --> 01:14:55,153
Sylvia!

1076
01:15:25,436 --> 01:15:27,167
Hey, you, better get out of here!

1077
01:15:27,417 --> 01:15:29,771
I'm looking for some Pacific Tech professors!

1078
01:15:30,021 --> 01:15:31,939
There's nobody left around here now!

1079
01:15:32,189 --> 01:15:34,241
We had a chance. We could've stopped them.

1080
01:15:34,491 --> 01:15:38,145
The mob stole all the trucks,
smashed everything up.

1081
01:15:38,395 --> 01:15:40,381
The fools! They cut their own throats!

1082
01:15:40,631 --> 01:15:43,101
He's nuts. Come on. Jump in.

1083
01:15:55,249 --> 01:15:56,881
Hurry up! Jump in!

1084
01:15:57,131 --> 01:15:59,250
There was a girl with them.
If I could find them...

1085
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,018
Come on. Jump in, will you?

1086
01:16:01,268 --> 01:16:02,803
She's kind of lost.

1087
01:16:03,053 --> 01:16:05,506
You look kind of lost yourself.

1088
01:16:05,756 --> 01:16:08,759
But I think I know where she'll be.

1089
01:16:09,009 --> 01:16:09,944
Come on, come on.

1090
01:16:10,194 --> 01:16:12,280
It's your last chance to get out of here.

1091
01:16:57,712 --> 01:17:03,532
CONGREGATION: ♫ Amen ♫

1092
01:17:05,852 --> 01:17:10,022
MINISTER: We humbly beseech
thy divine guidance, O Lord.

1093
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:12,423
Deliver us from the fear

1094
01:17:12,673 --> 01:17:14,826
which has come upon us...

1095
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:19,264
from the evil that grows ever nearer...

1096
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:23,935
from the terror that soon will knock upon

1097
01:17:24,185 --> 01:17:28,006
the very door of this, thy house.

1098
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:34,745
O Lord, we pray thee,

1099
01:17:34,995 --> 01:17:39,284
grant us the miracle
of thy divine intervention.

1100
01:17:44,675 --> 01:17:47,207
Don't go, son. Stay with us.

1101
01:17:47,457 --> 01:17:50,411
No, I... I'm looking for someone.

1102
01:17:50,661 --> 01:17:52,814
She'll be in a church, near the door.

1103
01:18:59,032 --> 01:19:00,631
Forrester!

1104
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:02,233
Duprey, Bilderbeck,

1105
01:19:02,483 --> 01:19:03,835
are you...?

1106
01:19:04,905 --> 01:19:06,203
Where are the others?

1107
01:19:06,453 --> 01:19:08,238
A mob attacked us.

1108
01:19:08,488 --> 01:19:10,507
We don't know what happened to the rest.

1109
01:19:10,757 --> 01:19:12,259
I...

1110
01:19:12,509 --> 01:19:13,144
I got...

1111
01:19:13,394 --> 01:19:16,415
I got knocked under our truck.

1112
01:19:18,419 --> 01:19:20,918
Du... Duprey pulled me out.

1113
01:19:21,168 --> 01:19:23,221
What happened to Sylvia?

1114
01:19:23,471 --> 01:19:26,058
We never did see her again.

1115
01:20:02,946 --> 01:20:05,279
In our peril, we plead,

1116
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:08,616
succor and comfort us in this hour.

1117
01:20:09,986 --> 01:20:11,719
Please, God.

1118
01:20:27,171 --> 01:20:28,937
Sylvia!

1119
01:20:39,650 --> 01:20:41,116
Sylvia!

1120
01:20:48,275 --> 01:20:49,607
Sylvia!

1121
01:20:52,947 --> 01:20:54,962
Here! Here!

1122
01:20:55,212 --> 01:20:57,065
Sylvia!

1123
01:21:06,493 --> 01:21:09,060
Let me through, please!

1124
01:21:48,035 --> 01:21:50,467
MINISTER: Almighty and most merciful Father,

1125
01:21:50,717 --> 01:21:52,603
we have erred and strayed
from thy ways like lost sheep.

1126
01:21:52,853 --> 01:21:55,540
We have followed too much the devices

1127
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:57,608
and desires of our own hearts.

1128
01:21:57,858 --> 01:22:01,111
We have offended against thy holy laws.

1129
01:22:01,361 --> 01:22:05,416
We have left undone those things
which we ought to have done.

1130
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:07,752
And we have done those things
which we ought not to have done.

1131
01:22:08,002 --> 01:22:09,988
CLAYTON: Maybe they've gone another way.

1132
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:21,933
Let's go see.

1133
01:22:22,183 --> 01:22:25,135
WOMAN: Do you see anything outside?

1134
01:22:25,385 --> 01:22:27,378
MAN: It must be all right.

1135
01:23:35,091 --> 01:23:36,558
Something's happening to them.

1136
01:23:56,679 --> 01:23:59,147
It's dead.

1137
01:24:14,731 --> 01:24:18,166
We were all praying for a miracle.

1138
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:32,296
NARRATOR: <i>The Martians had no resistance</i>

1139
01:24:32,546 --> 01:24:34,065
<i>to the bacteria in our atmosphere,</i>

1140
01:24:34,315 --> 01:24:36,466
<i>to which we have long since become immune.</i>

1141
01:24:36,716 --> 01:24:38,669
<i>Once they had breathed our air,</i>

1142
01:24:38,919 --> 01:24:42,239
<i>germs which no longer affect us
began to kill them.</i>

1143
01:24:42,489 --> 01:24:44,742
<i>The end came swiftly.</i>

1144
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:45,943
<i>All over the world,</i>

1145
01:24:46,193 --> 01:24:49,213
<i>their machines began to stop and fall.</i>

1146
01:24:49,463 --> 01:24:52,282
<i>After all that men could do had failed,</i>

1147
01:24:52,532 --> 01:24:55,786
<i>the Martians were destroyed
and humanity was saved</i>

1148
01:24:56,036 --> 01:24:58,122
<i>by the littlest things,</i>

1149
01:24:58,372 --> 01:25:01,125
<i>which God, in his wisdom,
had put upon this Earth.</i>

1150
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:08,298
CONGREGATION: ♫ In this world and the next ♫

1151
01:25:08,548 --> 01:25:12,010
♫ Amen ♫
