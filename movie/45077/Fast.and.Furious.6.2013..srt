Let's track that, see where it leads us.

And secondly, we just got confirmation

They ripped off the database

of every location that houses the final component that they need.
記錄了他們所需最終零件存放點的列表

420
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,785
So where are they at?

421
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,616
There are over two dozen of them around Europe.
遍布歐洲有超過12個存放點

422
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,910
But the list is only good for 96 hours.
但列表只有96小時的時效

423
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,044
Which means, wherever Shaw's crew is going to hit next,
也就意味著 無論肖的下一個目標是哪兒

424
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,046
it's going to happen within the next four days.

So let's break this down.

You met them. What do we know?
你們跟他們交過手 我們知道些什麼?

We know they have to be running custom engines.

You heard that flip car going through those gears.

That was a turbo diesel.

Did you see it take all those hits
你們有沒有注意到它經曆

436
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,603
and still stay flat in the corners?

Yeah, hydraulics.

438

Maybe a handful of shops in London.

一般的改裝店不會染指這玩意兒

443
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,661
We're going to have to dig deeper than that.

Han, Gisele, Roman, you're up.

Man, you really got to loosen up.

You can't just throw a bunch of factory-line Beemers at people and expect...
你不能扔給我們一堆流水線上下來的寶馬車就指望...

But don't worry about that. Watch this.

May I ask why you're looking for Shaw?

He took something of ours.

That might be a bad idea.

Where can we find her?

Tell me where to find Shaw,

If Ivory's dead, he made a mistake.

00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,084
If you make a mistake, you pay the price.

Are you going to give the same speech

for the rest of us when we go out?

I like you, Letty.

I dare say I even feel a certain warmth towards you.

When I found you in the hospital,

"This girl has a gift."

"She's a blank page."

646

If something happened to you, for instance,

I think I might find that slightly harder to bear.

648
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,820

649
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,533
I would hate to see you

I'm going to get some air.

Tej, what have you got? Footage, CCTV? Talk to me.
泰吉 你從監控中發現什麼了? 告訴我

I just went through all of it.
我剛看完所有的監控錄像

657
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,461
Believe it or not, everywhere Shaw's team is, the cameras are down.
只要是肖的手下出現的地方 監控像頭就壞了

658
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,550
That's a hell of a coincidence.
真是巧合啊

659
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,429
All right, we're going to pay CCTV a little visit. Let's roll.

661
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,763
That is a new toy for you.
給你的新玩具

662
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,101
So, what happened?
除了什麼事?

663
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,892
Shaw's goons showed up and started shooting up the place.
肖的手下一來就射穿了那地方

664
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,401
But we got something big.

- What?  - Braga.

What are you talking about?
你說什麼?

668
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,904
It's true. That phone's filled with coded payment transactions

669
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,913
that lead straight to Braga's cartel.

Who the hell is Braga?

And my old boss.

673
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,585
We used codes just like that
以前我們就用密碼

674
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,756
to move money out of the country.
把錢轉移到國外

675
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,007
It all makes sense.
這就很清楚了

676
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,761
Braga was running Letty, now he's working with Shaw.
布拉加過去讓萊蒂運過車 現在他和肖合作

677
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,216
It would explain how the two of them met.
這就說明了他們怎麼會在一起

678
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,513
Okay, so you all know all this information

679
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:19,932
about him, where do we find him?

He's sitting in a prison in Los Angeles.

682
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,473
Brian put him there.
布萊恩把他弄進去的

683
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,437
All right, so this is the break we were looking for.
好吧 這就是我們一直在找的突破口

684
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,853
If the two of them were working together,

Braga will know what Shaw's up to.

686
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,897
I'm going to pay him a visit.

687

Are you serious right now?
你說真的?

688

Think about what you're saying.

You're wanted, Brian.
你被通緝了 布萊恩

691
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,621

This is on me.

I'm the one that served her up to Braga.

He's ready to see you now. Right this way.

in and around Waterloo station.

705
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,346
that requires clearance?

打開今天早晨58到62號的監控錄像

709
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,196
Sorry.
不好意思

is Interpol was attacked recently as well.

Nothing.
什麼都沒有

715
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,208
Now, that means either one of two things.
這說明兩件事情

716
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,759
Either means that your maintenance schedule here
要麼說明你們的維護系統

717
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,970
aligns perfectly with their escape route
跟他們的逃跑路線完全一致

718
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,638
or it means that someone here is working with them.
要麼說明你們這裏有內鬼

719
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:26,600
And that's just ridiculous.
這就太可笑了

720
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:27,725
Because there ain't no way in hell

anybody here would be working for them.

Particularly you, ain't that right?

No, no, that's ridiculous.

Well, well, well.

然後又落到了我手裏的?

You'll feel a lot better once you get the credit for taking down Shaw.
如果抓到肖的功勞算在你頭上 你感覺會好很多

740
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,910
Oh, I'm tempted to settle for you.

if you want the career-changing big fish,
如果你想釣上改變一切的大魚

and sail out to the deep water.

幫你批准了進入勝利穀去做你應該做的

It's a 24-hour hold.
你只有24小時

You need to be out of there by 9:00 a.m.
你必須在上午9點前出來

Again?

Big Brother's about to go live.

00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,673
Damn, you can't flick a booger in London without somebody noticing.
該死 在倫敦挖鼻屎都能被人看見

嘿! 別碰那個 那不是什麼玩具 老兄

765

That's high-tensile titanium cable.

What does that mean?

and added this tank to the back.

Look at me! Look at me.

What is Shaw up to?

雖然你知道我開車的習慣 並不代表你了解我

when I was young, my brother always used to say,

過節的時候有家人還不錯 但它讓你的行動很容易被預料

932
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,453
And in our line of work, predictable means vulnerable.
幹我們這行的 這意味著脆弱

933
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,215
And that means I can reach out and break you whenever I want.
也就是說 只要我想 我就可以找到你並且打敗你

938
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,437

I'm going to give you a chance.

這是保護你家人安全的唯一辦法

942
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,324

你哥哥難道沒有告訴過你 永遠別拿家人去威脅別人嗎?

943
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,411
It's a pretty stupid thing to do.
這非常愚蠢

944
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:08,002
But I'll make it simple for you.

I walk away when she walks away.

946
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:15,090
Well, then,
好吧

947
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:20,144
it appears this inspiring tale has come to an end.
看來這個勵志故事要結束了

948

If that's the way it has to go.
如果一定要這樣的話

949
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:38,946

You can bet on it.

要知道 如果我沒有把跟蹤器放在你車裏

958
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,785
if I didn't put that tracker in your car?

959
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,334
This one?

960

You know, this just got me one step closer to Shaw.

For what it's worth, Toretto,

Tej, talk to me, what have we got?
泰吉 說說看 情況如何了?

976

We were able to track Shaw after he left you and Dom,
肖離開你和唐之後 我們還可以追蹤到他

但這個家夥太聰明了 我們只能追蹤到這裏

978

He seems to know all the city's blind spots.

See, we lost him somewhere in here,

也許我們可以參照通話記錄 租約...

That puts Shaw in a different country.

也就意味著他比我們超前八個小時

Screw it.
好吧

1094
01:32:58,281 --> 01:32:59,908
Yeah!
耶!

1095
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,171
We're dragging a car behind us.
我們後面拖了輛車

1096
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:09,297
Brian, that Mustang would make a nice anchor.
布萊恩 那輛野馬可以當一個很好的錨

1097
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:10,631
Yeah, I'm on it.
號 我知道了

1098
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:36,861
Damn!

1099
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,780
Shaw, we've got to get rid of that car.
肖 我們必須擺脫那車

1100
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:41,496
Letty, go take care of the cable.
萊蒂 去解開纜繩

1101
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,140
Yeah!

01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,228
What's she doing?
她在幹嘛?

1103
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,559
Shit!
該死!

1104
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,898

Letty!

01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:53,605
Jesus Christ.
天啊

1109
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,164
I can't believe they stole a 70-ton tank
我不敢相信他們竟然為了個三盎司的電腦芯片

1110
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,578
for a three-ounce computer chip.
偷一輛70噸重的坦克

1111
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:08,621
That 3-ounce computer chip is more deadly than 1,000 of those tanks.
那三盎司的電腦芯片可比一千輛坦克致命多了

1112
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:13,792
What about her?
她要怎麼處理呢?

1113
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,965
Not her.
別打她的主意

1114
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,595
She was working with Shaw.
她和肖一起做事

1115

but she's always been one of us.

1117
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:28,018
Let's give them a minute.
給他們點時間

1118
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,829
Let's go process Shaw and his crew.
我們來處理肖和他的手下

1119
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:47,162
I've never looked more forward to filling out paperwork in my life.
我從沒像現在這樣這麼期待填文件

1120
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:05,180
Hey.

1121
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:11,858
Look, I don't even know how to say this to you,

1123
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:20,867
I'm the one that put you undercover...
是我讓你去做臥底...

1124
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:22,698
Stop.
別說了

1125
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,368
I may not remember anything,
我也許失憶了

1126
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:29,417
but I know one thing about myself.
但我很了解我自己

1127
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:32,921
Nobody makes me do anything I don't want to.
我不想做的事 沒人能逼我

1128
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:48,512
So, what's our next adventure after this?
這事過後 我們再去哪裏冒險?

1129
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:54,105
How about we stay in one place?

1130
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,231
Where are you thinking?

1131

We always talk about Tokyo.
我們總是談到東京

1133
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,611
Tokyo it is.
那就東京吧

1134
01:37:11,034 --> 01:37:13,753
Can I ask you something?
我能問你些事嗎?

1135
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:26,049
How did you know that there would be a car there to break our fall?
你怎麼知道那有輛車能讓我們減速?

1136
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:28,260
I didn't.
我並不知道

1137
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:35,816
Some things you just have to take on faith.
有些事你必須心存信念

1138
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:38,899
Hey, Toretto! You need to hear this

You guys really think you've won.

This code you live by,
你們所遵從的原則

1141
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:04,299
it's the very reason why you weren't even in the game.
正是你們根本沒勝算的原因

1142
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:10,309
I told you exactly what I was gonna do if you didn't walk away, Toretto.
我清楚地告訴過你礙我事的後果 托雷托

1143
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:12,436
Go!

1144
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:14,809
But you didn't listen.
但你沒聽進去

1145
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,861
I told you I can reach out and break you whenever I want.
我告訴你我隨時都可以出手讓你崩潰

1146
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,065
And I have.

Maybe you should call Mia.

- Mia?  - Brian!

Let me go!

1152
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:07,867
So, this is how it's gonna go down.
所以事情就是這樣

1153
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:10,369
You're gonna cut me loose from these cuffs,
你們會替我解開手銬

1154
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,072
you're gonna hand me the chip,

你在做夢

1157

Look at his face.

1158
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:27,212
Ask him if I'm joking.
問他我是不是在做夢

1159
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:32,100
One hostage does not outweigh the threat to millions.
區區一個人質相比較數萬人的生命來說無足輕重

1160
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:36,931
I'm sorry, but this changes nothing.
對不起 但這改變不了什麼

1161
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:43,361
It changes everything.
這能改變一切

1162
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:47,448
You tell your men to stand down.
讓你的手下把槍放下

1163
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:52,077
Stand down.

I need you to know,

the moment we let him walk out that door with that chip,
一旦我們讓他帶著芯片走出這扇門後

words like "amnesty" and "pardon"

walk out with him.
也跟他一起走了

1169
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:15,935
Those words went out the day we were born.

1170
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,962
Coming, babe?

I wouldn't miss it for the world.

you were never in the game.
你根本沒勝算

1175
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:11,491
If I see you on the horizon, I'll make the call and the girl's dead.
要是我待會看到你們 我會打電話過去 那姑娘就死定了 

1176
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:26,756
So, what about Toretto's sister?

There's no need for her anymore.

1178
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,764
I just jammed every signal up and down the spectrum.

1179
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:42,685
Let's move.

I'm coming with you.
我跟你們一起去

1181
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:20,222
Where the hell does this dude think he's going?
他以為他在什麼地方撒野?

1182
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:22,227
We're on an army base, he's trapped.
我們是在陸軍基地 他被困住了

1183
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:32,981
Wow, you just had to open your mouth.
哇 你非得說個不停

1184
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:35,274
Now we got a big-ass plane to deal with.
現在又來了架大飛機了

1185
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:37,614
That ain't a plane. That's a planet.
那不是飛機 那是個星球

1186
01:42:42,691 --> 01:42:44,200
打開貨艙門

1187
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:58,431
She's as good as dead if Shaw gets away on that plane.
要是肖上了飛機 那她就死定了

1188
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:04,099
Then we don't let him get away.

起飛! 起飛!

01:44:56,912 --> 01:44:58,900

1195
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:05,053
Babe, get me under the wing.
寶貝 送我到機翼下面

If I can hit that flap, we can keep it from taking off.
我要是能打中副翼 飛機就起飛不了

1197
