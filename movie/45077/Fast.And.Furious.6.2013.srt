00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:16,434 
hurry to come. 
Thus, this way. 


3 

00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:18,357 
It's all right 
I have got it


4 

00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:20,625 
It's okay. 
You're right on time. 


5 

00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:23,180 
be a good father, Brian. 


6 

00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:27,516 
- Why are you so sure 
- Because I'll kick your ass if you do not '. 


7 

00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:31,078 
Come with you. 


8 

00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:32,448 
Brian! 


9 

00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:40,141 
Remember that once you go 
those ports that moves everything. 


10 

00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:42,853 
Our old life is over. 


11 

00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,941 
Come for a ride ...

Moscow 


14 

00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:22,547 

- Special Agent Hobbs 

- Agent Riley Hicks. 


15 

00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:25,270 
I read about you 
number 1 in its class. 


16 

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,800 

Cairo, Tunis. 


17 

00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:34,317 

If you're so good, in fact, 

as in the paper, we could probably agree. 


18 

00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,641 

A Russian military convoy was attacked. 


19 

00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,367 

satellite components were stolen. 


20 

00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:43,688 

cars just came out of nowhere. 
Six are 

hospital and a dozen cars were destroyed. 


21 

00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:47,011 

- It's all in less than 90 seconds 

- It is a professional job. 


22 

00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:50,734 

There is only one team in the world, 

that can cause you to succeed. 


23 

00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:54,258 

How the hell ended up there? 


24 

00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:59,305 

- They took one 

- Where is he? 


25 

00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:02,228 

Interpol Headquarters. 


26 

00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:07,300 

- You have five minutes with him 

- I only use two .. 


27 

00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:20,748 

I want your boss 

Where is Shaw? 


28 

00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:29,287 

- I do not say shit 

- I was hoping you'd say that!. 


29 

00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:39,461 

- It's cool 

- No. .. 


30 

00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:42,286 

... 
but you go and tell them? 


31 

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,818 

- I have my rights, idiot 

- Not today!. 


32 

00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:00,423 

No, no! 


33 

00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:10,264 

- Says he say anything 

- No more '. 


34 

00:06:10,264 --> 00:06:14,288 

But the place is bugged 

All you have outside, Interpol now. 


35 

00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:17,811 

- Okay. 
So we keep free morning 

-. 
Let's bring it inside. 


36 

00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,200 

Man is not just Owen Shaw 

which to retrieve items in the supermarket. 


37 

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,727 

You need to catch wolves wolves 

Let's hunt. 


38 

00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:23,349 

That's what 

you can get 100 million? 


39 

00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:26,603 

It was not so difficult 

to find it, Toretto. 


40 

00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:30,703 

saved me. 


41 

00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:37,148 

How is the life of a retiree 

international criminal? 


42 

00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:40,281 

I like being here. 

There is peace and tranquility. 


43 

00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,828 

Good time. 


44 

00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:47,930 

And no extradition treaty 

What are you doing here, officer? 


45 

00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:53,000 

On Tuesday assaulted a team of trained pilots 

a train Russian military. 


46 

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,547 

- I do not work in cold weather 

- I know it was not you. 


47 

00:07:56,858 --> 00:08:00,387 

But you have to help me 

to pick the team that did it. 


48 

00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:02,634 

And you do not need. 


49 

00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:08,265 

- You can not touch it, Hobbs 

- I do not want someone handed. 


50 

00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:11,094 

It follows that voluntarily 

true ... 


51 

00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,093 

he will plead with me about it. 


52 

00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:18,645 

It was taken a week ago. 


53 

00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:23,003 

See you there in front. 


54 

00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:47,828 

- Is she 

- It is impossible '. 


55 

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,000 

If it were my husband ... 


56 

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,514 

If there was a chance ... 


57 

00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:01,514 

I would. 


58 

00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:23,263 

- I need all your information 

- You start with the rest of the team .. 


59 

00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,350 

There will be no team. 


60 

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,469 

- It will be me alone 

- So it is not easy. 


61 

00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:32,342 

team, we are looking for, they hit 

like thunder and disappear like smoke. 


62 

00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:35,180 

You do it yourself, 

you never hit them. 


63 

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,711 

I have to chase him across four continents 

and twelve countries, and believe me - 


64 

00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:42,734 

- The last thing I want to do, 

is to sit on my knees for you. 


65 

00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:46,914 

I need your help, Dom 


66 

00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,305 

Need your team. 


67 

00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:59,852 

I would like to propose a toast ... 

Come on, girls. 


68 

00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:03,961 

I know some of you have 

been to Macau - 


69 

00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:07,292 

- But I have never experienced the city, 

until you have experienced it through my eyes. 


70 

00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,572 

We have a penthouse apartment overlooking the sea 

that will change your life. 


71 

00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:14,203 

150 meters yacht 

with helipad. 


72 

00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:17,614 

I'm really going to get 

best experience of your life. 


73 

00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:19,645 

No you do not. 


74 

00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:39,063 

come here in his Ferrari 

and have pockets full of money. 


75 

00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:42,586 

was once a true Robin Hood, 

he shared everything he owned. 


76 

00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:46,109 

You know exactly what I'm talking 

money changed you. 


77 

00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:49,211 

You're right ... 

money changed me. 


78 

00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:52,836 

I realized 

that money does not grow on trees. 


79 

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,174 

raining from the sky. 


80 

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000 

Thanks, it looks great. 


81 

00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:14,868 

- Yummy 

- It's good world citizen. 


82 

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,375 

Have you thought about settling 

To start a life together? 


83 

00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,344 

Is not that what we do? 


84 

00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:26,899 

If we do this? 


85 

00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:39,331 

Drop your weapons at once! 


86 

00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:52,345 

Hello? 


87 

00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,192 

Dom? 


88 

00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,961 

- I'm going 

- You will have to turn the plane around. 


89 

00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:05,984 

Listen, ladies. 
There is little change 

plans. 
There was something wrong. 


90 

00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:11,719 

the casino, I was talking about? 
I 

have some vouchers for the buffet. 


91 

00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:16,229 

THE ROMAN, bitches 


92 

00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:27,893 

Okay. 


93 

00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:33,266 

Check out ... 

Right! 


94 

00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,266 

That's my boy. 

Let's see if he can fly. 


95 

00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,170 

watching? 


96 

00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:49,287 

There you see 

We Wave? 


97 

00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:51,516 

Hello, Jack. 


98 

00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:54,523 

So Uncle Don 

"Hey, Uncle Don?" 


99 

00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,490 

- Are you happy to see him 

- Enforces already know Japanese cars? 


100 

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,580 

Father foist him nothing. 


101 

00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,250 

- He chose the car 

- We know he is a O'Connor, but ... 


102 

00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,645 

I have something for you, Jack. 


103 

00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:11,766 

- Yes! 
He is also a Toretto 

- He has, thankfully, a few years to choose from. 


104 

00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:14,414 

I think he decided. 


105 

00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,133 

I think it's time for your nap 

Come on, baby. 


106 

00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:27,085 

- It's weird, right 

- What is strange? 


107 

00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:31,055 

We all ... 


108 

00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:33,562 

Even beer and barbecue. 


109 

00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,657 

It's just that ... 


110 

00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:38,964 

just do not feel at home. 


111 

00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:42,466 

Maybe it's because ... 


112 

00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:46,279 

You have no idea how happy you are for something 

before someone takes it from a. 


113 

00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,703 

I do not know. 


114 

00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:53,220 

Your home is probably as much changed 

you do not know more. 


115 

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,970 

... 


116 

00:13:56,844 --> 00:14:01,516 

- Everything has changed 

- So what? 
What is happening? 


117 

00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:11,406 

118 

00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:14,219 

The diplomatic intelligence. 


119 

00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:15,438 

Hobbs. 


120 

00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:24,934 

I was doing something all the time, 

when I was a cop. 


121 

00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:28,171 

That's exactly what they do 

He mess with your head. 


122 

00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:42,413 

- Death of Letty, Dom 

- I have to be sure. 


123 

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,795 

- So I'll go with you 

You said it would be life behind you. 


124 

00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:50,226 

We both said that 

would put the lives behind us. 


125 

00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:53,352 

He's right 

We are a family. 


126 

00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,866 

If you have a problem, 

to deal with it together. 


127 

00:14:57,242 --> 00:15:01,602 

And I'm more at ease if you are away 

So I take care of each other. 


128 

00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:06,553 

Are stronger when they are together 

You always were. 


129 

00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,671 

Take it out and start Letty. 


130 

00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:13,685 

Get your home. 


131 

00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:35,125 

Thank you, God 

Finally some equipment I can use. 


132 

00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,797 

- What is it, friend 

- Much better than the crap in Rio '. 


133 

00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,179 

Much better. 


134 

00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:48,562 

- You trust these people 

- No. '. 


135 

00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:52,321 

Is there anyone who has heard 

Leo or Santos? 


136 

00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:55,766 

They were last seen 

the casinos in Monte Carlo. 


137 

00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:58,584 

I thought it was 

Our latest work, Brian. 


138 

00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,290 

Who pays for all equipment 

taxpayers? 


139 

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,757 

So now we are working on the Hulk 

That's what we do? 


140 

00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,946 

Why do you smell of baby oil? 


141 

00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:10,344 

If you continue to bullshit 

will smell like ass. 


142 

00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:14,540 

Ok, Hobbs. 
You have the 

best team in the world in front of you. 


143 

00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:17,329 

Give them a reason to stay here. 


144 

00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:20,719 

goal is Owen Shaw. 


145 

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,226 

Former Air Force colonel 

Elite Soldier. 


146 

00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,616 

He led mobile Britain 

the Cape and Bosnia. 


147 

00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:32,734 

Curse. 
Your mobile device is the hard 

boys. 
We're talking about mobile warfare. 


148 

00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:36,943 

The world's best 

- Do you have a few pennies? 


149 

00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,195 

They have operated for years in Europe. 


150 

00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:43,281 

The latest work brought 

Them to a whole different level. 


151 

00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,258 

three objectives are carefully selected. 


152 

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,000 

programmed termoenhed 

ICPM a missile. 


153 

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,355 

- A pair of vipers ... 

- You have pennies? 


154 

00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,781 

Are you a millionaire 

and yet you raise money? 


155 

00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,941 

This is how to remain millionaire! 


156 

00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,242 

What does that mean here? 


157 

00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:03,549 

Our best guess is that the team of Shaw 

is the construction of a natskyggeenhed. 


158 

00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:05,118 

What is ...? 


159 

00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:09,453 

pump technology that can shut down a whole 

communication network down for 24 hours. 


160 

00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:13,743 

Diaphragm you a soldier in a second 

on the battlefield, so he dies. 


161 

00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:19,219 

Diaphragm a country for 24 hours, 

victims can reach increasing numbers. 


162 

00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,390 

may be worth billions. 


163 

00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,867 

Billions 

Why not just build shit? 


164 

00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,768 

Hey, man. 


165 

00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:28,750 

Which one is a dollar? 


166 

00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:36,924 

It's on the house. 


167 

00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:42,992 

to help me get Shaw. 


168 

00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:47,743 

He just needs to find more, and 

I'll stop him before he finds. 


169 

00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:50,466 

And I know that you are a family. 


170 

00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:55,708 

So I offer you the chance 

to make the whole family again. 


171 

00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:05,409 

You want to do this whole family again? 


172 

00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,839 

Show us the way to Letty, you get Shaw 

full pardon for all of us .. 


173 

00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,375 

I can not promise you 

- Yes, you can then. 


174 

00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:24,576 

our offer. 


175 

00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:26,469 

It's either. 


176 

00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:33,953 

Get me Shaw ... 


177 

00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:37,640 

why I get their pardons. 


178 

00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:41,648 

Hear what he said 

But this is different. 


179 

00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:44,500 

We have neither the officers 

or drug dealers to do. 


180 

00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:46,634 

It is something completely different. 


181 

00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,464 

get a good enough money for it, right? 


182 

00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:09,048 

Interpol called Shaw's man in Moscow, 

as I have a little talk with him. 


183 

00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,311 

He told us where Shaw hideout. 


184 

00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:14,863 

Why is not there now? 


185 

00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:18,027 

were not invited. 


186 

00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:22,164 

Hobbs 

They send sacrificed now. 


187 

00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:25,936 

He microphone. 
It should identify 

Shaw before moving on. 


188 

00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,594 

Lod police then you walk away? 


189 

00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:45,031 

Worry 

I told them not to shit. 


190 

00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:47,976 

I'm not really worried. 


191 

00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,259 

Okay. 
Start right for me. 


192 

00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:03,356 

That's perfect. 


193 

00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:07,379 

The simplest things 

can create major problems. 


194 

00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:12,868 

But the good news is ... 

Change the bad part out - 


195 

00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:16,897 

- Keep everything running smoothly again. 


196 

00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:20,726 

Shaw. 
Shaw! 


197 

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,680 

It is confirmed that Shaw is 

They are moving now .. 


198 

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,610 

Wait a minute ... 

Wait a minute. 


199 

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,751 

police radio reports an alarm, 

became the headquarters of Interpol. 


200 

00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:53,086 

Shit! 
He brought us here, 

so they could attack Interpol. 


201 

00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,742 

- It's all a trap 

You are the team with Brian. 


202 

00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:58,951 

- What about you 

- Hobbs and I'm waiting for Shaw. 


203 

00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:01,633 

Shaw leads us to Letty. 


204 

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,953 

Come on, you bastard. 


205 

00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:17,726 

What is this? 


206 

00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,513 

part of their latest work. 


207 

00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:27,468 

<i> Performs work 

then you get paid </ I> </ i> 


208 

00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:29,922 

There's a bit more to you. 


209 

00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:35,048 

- Seeing it as a breakthrough 

- For what? 


210 

00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:37,791 

next job, of course. 


211 

00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,668 

That work? 


212 

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,055 

What we are doing now. 


213 

00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:49,532 

- How far are we Interpol 

- Two blocks away. 


214 

00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:51,383 

It's a ghost town. 


215 

00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:56,756 

- Shaw withdrew all police here 

- So let's end it here. 
Let's get them. 


216 

00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,399 

It's been fun working with you. 


217 

00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,202 

Drop the bag! 


218 

00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,735 

- There it is 

- I got him. 


219 

00:22:57,951 --> 00:23:00,751 

He is frank, Toretto 

Tab it out of my sight now. 


220 

00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:02,676 

That will not happen. 


221 

00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:05,939 

Sorry, guys. 


222 

00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,875 

Interpol is simple. 


223 

00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:29,502 

Come on, guys 

We have company. 


224 

00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:47,804 

Come on, guys. 


225 

00:25:00,404 --> 00:25:02,881 

That's it! 


226 

00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:14,313 

- There are three cars behind us, Shaw 

- You know what to do. 


227 

00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,379 

Comes with rifle chip. 


228 

00:25:25,476 --> 00:25:29,215 

- I Rover 

- Okay, I'll ... 


229 

00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:32,759 

what the hell is. 


230 

00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:46,866 

What's that 

A hockey puck? 


231 

00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:52,946 

We are ready! 


232 

00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:03,101 

Chip one is ready! 


233 

00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,281 

Shit! 


234 

00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:35,336 

chip three are ready! 


235 

00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:46,594 

does not work! 


236 

00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:50,219 

We are approaching the site. 


237 

00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:57,188 

Tej and Roman are out of the game, Dom 

Where are you? 


238 

00:26:57,188 --> 00:26:59,181 

I'm right behind you. 


239 

00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:20,867 

take nødruten! 


240 

00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:28,954 

- Left after Shaw, Toretto 

- I'm Vegh! 


241 

00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:39,758 

- I need your help, Vegh 

- That's no problem. 


242 

00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:58,265 

243 

00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:51,954 

Letty! 


244 

00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:11,000 

Take the wheel. 


245 

00:29:42,554 --> 00:29:43,274 

246 

00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:04,782 

It's crazy 

We're not in Brazil! 


247 

00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:10,500 

Now we have cars flying in the air 

How little James Bond-ish? 


248 

00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,337 

- It's not how we work 

- You need to have a control over emotions, man. 


249 

00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:17,024 

His voice was direct 

Shaggy Scooby Doo. 


250 

00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,719 

"It's not like us ..." 


251 

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,641 

When a woman begins to shoot - 


252 

00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:26,156 

- Then it is a clear sign 

you should resign. 


253 

00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:28,852 

We have to get out of here. 


254 

00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:32,204 

It could have been my forehead! 


255 

00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:36,143 

No. .. 
Not as big as your head. 


256 

00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:44,430 

Mia ... 


257 

00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:50,493 

It's definitely Letty, 

but it is complicated. 


258 

00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:54,724 

Letty is alive 

It's the only thing that matters .. 


259 

00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:57,562 

We <i> back, Brian </ I> </ i> 


260 

00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:03,249 

<i> Do me a favor and give 

Jack a kiss goodnight from me. 
</ I> </ i> 


261 

00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:07,003 

<i> - Take care of yourself </ i> 

- I love you, Mia .. </ i> 


262 

00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:22,071 

she knew it was you? 


263 

00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,461 

She looked directly at me, Brian. 


264 

00:31:25,938 --> 00:31:29,263 

Maybe old Letty, 

as we know off, Dom 


265 

00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:33,443 

Although she is alive, 

maybe she is away. 


266 

00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:37,466 

You will not the family back. 


267 

00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:40,218 

Even when they do that. 


268 

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,660 

- Ivory 

- Yes 


269 

00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,175 

- Must be repaired 

- It's just ok. 


270 

00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:10,914 

- Are you okay 

271 

00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,014 

Ok, listen ... 


272 

00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:20,523 

It was something completely different than 

sissy normal Hobbs. 


273 

00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:23,360 

We need to know who they are 

they are made. 


274 

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,153 

Vegh. 


275 

00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:31,453 

O'Connor, Parker, Pearce - 


276 

00:32:31,453 --> 00:32:34,586 

- Toretto and the rest of the gym. 


277 

00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,398 

They are common criminals. 


278 

00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:41,828 

criminals were 

too close to stop us today. 


279 

00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,961 

Show them the respect they deserve, 

otherwise weakens us. 


280 

00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:48,092 

here you will want to see. 


281 

00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,725 

mean anything to you? 


282 

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,750 

283 

00:33:07,524 --> 00:33:10,329 

- It's him, I shot 

- You seem happy .. 


284 

00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:12,969 

- I do not remember it 

- That's a lie! 


285 

00:33:13,268 --> 00:33:14,797 

we have a problem, people ... 


286 

00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:18,016 

We have a picture of her and him 

almost stopped today. 


287 

00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:20,495 

You are not muscle man team, Klaus? 


288 

00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:23,979 

Do not make me 

to make it a team of pussies. 


289 

00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,690 

She can not remember it. 


290 

00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,196 

Names and records are not enough 

I want your personal information. 


291 

00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:34,899 

Everything about their lives and their thoughts. 


292 

00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:37,754 

find your weaknesses, 

can exploit them. 


293 

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,016 

Looks delicious. 


294 

00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:50,211 

- It's crazy, man 

- What are you talking about now? 


295 

00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,649 

I stand here and look at the pictures. 


296 

00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:55,586 

It is as if 

we were chasing our evil twins. 


297 

00:33:55,586 --> 00:34:00,349 

sees it as black here. 
He's great. 

It's obviously me. 


298 

00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,242 

We have a white Hobbs 

this is he. 


299 

00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,915 

Here is Tej. 


300 

00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:10,859 

An African with a hat 

Bit like a mini version of you. 


301 

00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:11,923 

302 

00:34:13,736 --> 00:34:15,907 

When did you take these pictures? 


303 

00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:19,797 

I'm just kidding, man. 
I know 

you are the most beautiful blonde here. 


304 

00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:30,337 

Okay, listen to this here 

We have two things about them. 


305 

00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:33,556 

Firstly, this is the 

worst city to commit crimes within 


306 

00:34:33,556 --> 00:34:39,228 

There are cameras everywhere. 
We draw 

traffic cameras and see what it offers. 


307 

00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:42,719 

And now we know that they went out of their coup. 


308 

00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,992 

emptied a database that shows the locations 

have the part they need. 


309 

00:34:46,992 --> 00:34:49,792 

- Where are they now 

- There are only a few here. 


310 

00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:54,500 

list for only 96 hours, which 

means that wherever attack now - 


311 

00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,539 

- It happens in four days <br /> They have a time limit, and so we have. 


312 

00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:02,313 

Hobbs is right, then we'll think about it 

What we know so far.? 


313 

00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:04,570 

operation 

engines built in house. 


314 

00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,125 

I heard the quick coupling 

slip through the arts. 


315 

00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:12,152 

- It sounded like a normal engine, 

It was a turbodiesel. 


316 

00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,564 

laid on curves, 

he was hit. 


317 

00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:17,126 

- Hydraulic 

- Perhaps a magnetic suspension .. 


318 

00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:21,128 

Who has access to parts 

and to fix it? 


319 

00:35:21,128 --> 00:35:22,953 

Some shops in London, perhaps? 


320 

00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:28,563 

general tuning shops are not enough 

We need to dig deeper than that .. 


321 

00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:31,141 

He, Gisele and Roman, he performs I. 


322 

00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:34,859 

If you find it, which made the car 

so we also find Shaw. 


323 

00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:38,371 

- Let 

- I'll help. 


324 

00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:39,946 

is received. 


325 

00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:43,649 

We need cars without chips, 

to take control of Tej. 


326 

00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:46,141 

sure they are fast. 


327 

00:35:46,371 --> 00:35:48,946 

- This will make 

- I'm already working on it. 


328 

00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,594 

- Contact police office Engine 

Hobbs ... 


329 

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,132 

I said that I have it. 


330 

00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,500 

It will be interesting. 


331 

00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:13,672 

You need to relax a little, dude. 


332 

00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,016 

You can not provide standard BMWs for people 

expecting much ... 


333 

00:36:17,016 --> 00:36:22,516 

Hallo ... 
It was a hell of a car. 

TwinTurbo V8 with 560 horsepower, boy. 


334 

00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:27,547 

Have you read the brochure. 
That's perfect. 

But cars must be custom built. 


335 

00:36:27,547 --> 00:36:31,328 

It's something special between you and the car 

as you build. 
It's a tape. 


336 

00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:33,196 

Looks like a wedding. 


337 

00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:36,697 

Yes, but the cars do not have half 

its shit when you exchange them. 


338 

00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:43,325 

For the price it had better 

be made of gold. 


339 

00:36:46,057 --> 00:36:48,610 

You're not thinking of stealing them, right? 


340 

00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:51,915 

entrance of the kitchen staff 

'S on the back. 


341 

00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,048 

Say it again. 


342 

00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:58,252 

I can not pay 

for cars here. 


343 

00:36:58,252 --> 00:37:01,031 

Clearly missing jewelry 

No companions ... 


344 

00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:04,984 

There is no "girls" 

You're obviously not in the game .. 


345 

00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:08,914 

you ... 

shoes, shirt, pants. 


346 

00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:12,024 

And his attitude is very tough. 


347 

00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:15,589 

In prey. 
You look like a military man. 

$ 50,000 per year. 


348 

00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:19,054 

Dollars 

What is not enough to be here. 


349 

00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:23,320 

So if you are not kitchen staff, 

then you have gone wrong. 


350 

00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,055 

drink your champagne finally ended. 


351 

00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:35,202 

- He should be taught a lesson 

- You steal them, like I said. 


352 

00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:38,103 

I mastered it here. 


353 

00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,694 

as number five on our list. 


354 

00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:53,440 

Hell 

The guy just chasing? 


355 

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,284 

- Moby Dick 

- It must be him. 


356 

00:37:56,284 --> 00:37:58,312 

How should we do this? 


357 

00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:02,483 

He and I have here 

Come hard with it - 


358 

00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:05,820 

- You let me do the talking, 

and then cover me. 


359 

00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,497 

boys miss a thing ... 

He is a man. 


360 

00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:15,366 

- Come 

- "He is a man"? 


361 

00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:18,499 

she often says. 


362 

00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:29,883 

you're holding there is a 

Spitzerkugle 5.45x18. 


363 

00:38:29,883 --> 00:38:32,898 

It fits only into a weapon 

GSM. 


364 

00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:38,596 

When guns are illegal in the UK, has 

very few people have access to such weapons. 


365 

00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:42,024 

So if someone, for example 

would trace where it came from ... 


366 

00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,390 

it would not be difficult. 


367 

00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:48,281 

I was a cop too 

Some habits are hard to get rid of. 


368 

00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:50,373 

A moneylender. 


369 

00:38:57,563 --> 00:39:00,187 

I do not know, man ... 

It was disrespectful. 


370 

00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:03,446 

I do not like the way she said 

"He is a man." 


371 

00:39:03,757 --> 00:39:05,642 

He is a man? 


372 

00:39:06,282 --> 00:39:09,494 

- What are we 

- She is just doing his job. 


373 

00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:12,476 

It just does its job. 


374 

00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,586 

I can see what is happening here. 


375 

00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,664 

- What you see 

- You have a little stardust in your eyes, man. 


376 

00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:24,799 

There is a bit of haddock spring in the air? 


377 

00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:30,086 

You will not rent this model 

You want to buy it. 


378 

00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:35,236 

- You will not be quiet 

- No, you are in love.


Look at you. 


379 

00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,571 

- Stop it 

- Any plans so special.? 
A big day? 


380 

00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:45,462 

We invite you all to come out? 
Get her a big 

stone, because it is certainly not easy to impress. 


381 

00:39:45,462 --> 00:39:51,250 

not a large stone, you better 

be great somewhere else, if you understand. 


382 

00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,266 

That's why your girlfriend 

always have many jewels on? 


383 

00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:00,798 

- We are looking for information 

- Information about what? 


384 

00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,140 

Information about ... 
cars. 


385 

00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:07,984 

- In particular two that just made 

- Ram cars .. 


386 

00:40:07,984 --> 00:40:13,328 

- Tables Low, stable? 
? 
and metal 

- We'd love to find a buyer. 


387 

00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:17,383 

- Why should I help you 

- Why are we asking you well '. 


388 

00:40:17,383 --> 00:40:21,023 

What do you offer that I do not 

can get from the thousands of other girls? 


389 

00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:27,329 

Stop, stop, stop! 


390 

00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:32,361 

Okay! 


391 

00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,477 

You look like someone who is difficult to like. 


392 

00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:44,593 

My friend here can expose you to pain, 

like you've never experienced before. 


393 

00:40:46,258 --> 00:40:51,164 

- We have an agreement 

- Agreement, agreement, business! 


394 

00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:54,352 

I take it back 

I like that! 


395 

00:41:08,526 --> 00:41:11,812 

So that's how you took care of him 

To buy all the cars? 


396 

00:41:11,812 --> 00:41:15,440 

What good is having millions in the bank, 

if you do not use them? 


397 

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,888 

But no matter 

See it here. 


398 

00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:23,868 

Let's take the opportunity to show 

our gratitude for this trade. 


399 

00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:27,711 

- There's always something else I need ... 

- Anything? 


400 

00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,336 

- Yes 

- Now that you mentioned - 


401 

00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:33,997 

- So my friend here swagløse 

really like the shirt you have on. 


402 

00:41:33,997 --> 00:41:37,239 

- This shirt 

- The shirt, yes?. 


403 

00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:40,891 

- I'm not sure it will fit 

- Will fit. 


404 

00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:44,198 

He must ie wear a shirt 

that is a little smaller ... 
functional. 


405 

00:41:44,198 --> 00:41:46,359 

in. .. 
406 

00:41:48,877 --> 00:41:50,904 

Okay. 


407 

00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:56,900 

- I'll keep it 

- Thank you. 


408 

00:41:57,142 --> 00:42:01,033 

- Come on, man. 
Time is money 

- Yes, sir 


409 

00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:05,814 

Hell, you need 

a sideboard for this shit. 


410 

00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:11,562 

- If it was all ... 

- I have pants. 


411 

00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,454 

course. 


412 

00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:25,114 

Now you're at it, give me this watch 

I like the watch .. 


413 

00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:38,117 

- This is for you. 
E is for you 

-. 
Thank you. 


414 

00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:40,133 

Hello, gentlemen 

415 

00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:50,938 

information here. 


416 

00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:06,770 

Why do you look so after Shaw? 


417 

00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:11,657 

He took something that is ours, 

we should talk to him. 


418 

00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:13,820 

Let's see what we have here. 


419 

00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:19,059 

moneylender </? 
p> 


420 

00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:30,153 

What do you want? 


421 

00:43:30,153 --> 00:43:34,241 

It is said that if you're looking for 

one Russian weapon, you have to go with you. 


422 

00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:36,222 

Well, does it? 


423 

00:43:40,093 --> 00:43:41,657 

What are you, mate? 


424 

00:43:48,703 --> 00:43:50,375 

It would probably be a bad idea. 


425 

00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:58,571 

- I'm looking for the owner of this 

- I do not know who is. 


426 

00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:03,915 

- Look at the back 

- For about a week ago - 


427 

00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:07,438 

- A girl came and bought everything they had 

A girl? 


428 

00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:12,523 

- How it looks 

- The tough girl with dark hair ... 


429 

00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:15,977 

- There are rumors that she's running road races 

- Where can we find it? 


430 

00:44:15,977 --> 00:44:19,873 

How would I know 

I look like a race car driver? 


431 

00:44:19,873 --> 00:44:22,391 

No. ... 
You do not. 


432 

00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,318 

Take care, guys. 


433 

00:44:38,615 --> 00:44:39,335 

Shit! 


434 

00:44:55,764 --> 00:44:57,858 

Sorry, girls. 


435 

00:45:02,055 --> 00:45:02,775 

Come on! 


436 

00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,617 

Hang in there. 
Stay with me. 

Stay with me! 


437 

00:45:56,617 --> 00:46:00,897 

Tell me where I can find Shaw 

then he will pay for it here. 


438 

00:46:07,423 --> 00:46:08,383 

Braga ... 


439 

00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:03,719 

Hey, you 

Stay where you are! 


440 

00:48:30,754 --> 00:48:33,239 

Have it 

We have it! 


441 

00:49:45,953 --> 00:49:48,397 

No need to get something 

about it here. 


442 

00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:49,985 

No! 


443 

00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:09,041 

Lost Ivory 

He's gone. 


444 

00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:11,162 

445 

00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,165 

That's all? 


446 

00:50:17,165 --> 00:50:19,547 

Ivory is dead, then he was wrong. 


447 

00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:24,780 

Dummer you, then you pay the fine. 


448 

00:50:27,702 --> 00:50:30,574 

It was a nice compliment, Shaw. 


449 

00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:34,611 

Remains the same speech for us 

when they are taken out of the game? 


450 

00:50:52,468 --> 00:50:56,875 

you are the last person I would have thought 

that would be sentimental. 


451 

00:51:00,412 --> 00:51:02,645 

I like you, Letty. 


452 

00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:06,903 

I would even say that I estimate 

warm feelings for you. 


453 

00:51:06,903 --> 00:51:10,379 

When I met him in the hospital, 

and you could not remember anything ... 


454 

00:51:12,046 --> 00:51:14,650 

I told myself ... 


455 

00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:18,022 

The girl has a gift. 


456 

00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:21,187 

She is a blank canvas. 


457 

00:51:21,976 --> 00:51:25,418 

I did feel 

a certain protectionism for you. 


458 

00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:29,523 

For example, if something happened to you - 


459 

00:51:29,852 --> 00:51:33,504 

- So I think I would have 

it harder on him. 


460 

00:51:36,164 --> 00:51:37,860 

What I'm saying is ... 


461 

00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:44,100 

... 
I would hate 

see you make a mistake. 


462 

00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:54,191 

I need some fresh air. 


463 

00:52:21,478 --> 00:52:23,721 

- What happened 

- We met Kingdoms friend '. 


464 

00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:26,538 

- It is probably good 

- Are you okay? 


465 

00:52:26,538 --> 00:52:26,788 

. 


466 

00:52:28,087 --> 00:52:31,889 

What you got for me? 
The recordings? 

Traffic Cameras? 
Give me something. 


467 

00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:35,227 

Believe it or not. 
Wherever you are, 

the cameras are down. 


468 

00:52:35,227 --> 00:52:37,080 

It's something of a coincidence. 


469 

00:52:37,813 --> 00:52:40,984 

Okay. 
We visited CCTV for a walk. 

Come on. 


470 

00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,024 

What is this? 


471 

00:52:43,024 --> 00:52:45,149 

new toys for you. 


472 

00:52:45,149 --> 00:52:46,766 

...? 


473 

00:52:46,766 --> 00:52:49,298 

Shaws people left there 

and shot it to pieces. 


474 

00:52:49,298 --> 00:52:51,817 

- But at least we have something big 

- What.? 


475 

00:52:51,817 --> 00:52:56,465 

Braga. 
He collaborates with Shaw. 


476 

00:52:57,142 --> 00:52:59,187 

- What are you talking 

- It is true. 


477 

00:52:59,187 --> 00:53:01,763 

phone is loaded with 

encrypted transfers - 


478 

00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:03,688 

- Which leads directly to Braga. 


479 

00:53:03,688 --> 00:53:08,079 

- Who the hell is Braga 

- He took one of the drug cartels in Mexico?. 


480 

00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,626 

And he is my former boss. 


481 

00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:13,517 

The type of codes used for 

to move money out of the country. 


482 

00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:18,664 

Makes sense ... 
Braga controlled and Letty 

Shaw now. 
He explains how they met. 


483 

00:53:18,664 --> 00:53:21,235 

Where can we find it? 


484 

00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:25,148 

- He is in jail in Los Angeles 

How do you know? 


485 

00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:28,407 

Brian put it there. 
486 

00:53:28,407 --> 00:53:32,677 

Was the discovery that we were looking 

If they work together - 


487 

00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:35,820 

- For Braga, which Shaw is out 

I should pay a visit. 


488 

00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,031 

Really? 


489 

00:53:38,031 --> 00:53:42,360 

Think about what you say 

You are wanted, Brian .. 


490 

00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:47,797 

Once you get off the plane 

you get caught. 
You will not come back. 


491 

00:53:47,797 --> 00:53:50,344 

- Yes, I know 

- As you enter the country? 


492 

00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:52,565 

Just let me. 


493 

00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:02,135 

That depends on me. 


494 

00:54:02,758 --> 00:54:05,341 

I was 

allowing it to Braga. 


495 

00:54:06,196 --> 00:54:08,844 

Is that I must make amends. 


496 

00:54:11,546 --> 00:54:13,524 

Let me make amends. 


497 

00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:17,683 

Take care of yourself. 


498 

00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,771 

He can take it now. 

this way. 


499 

00:54:29,414 --> 00:54:31,985 

Thank wanted to meet us. 


500 

00:54:31,985 --> 00:54:34,241 

my people were attacked earlier today. 


501 

00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:37,952 

see all cameras 

in and around Waterloo Station. 


502 

00:54:38,302 --> 00:54:43,004 

Can anyone tell Captain America here 

she requires a license? 


503 

00:54:46,835 --> 00:54:52,242 

Terry. 
Show me the camera 

58-62 earlier today. 


504 

00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:58,078 

They were up all morning 

because of service. 


505 

00:54:58,078 --> 00:55:03,945 

- I'm sorry 

- Ok, but thanks for the help .. 


506 

00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:11,930 

You know what is also interesting 

Interpol was also attacked recently?. 


507 

00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:15,072 

The cameras were also down 

They caught nothing. 


508 

00:55:15,072 --> 00:55:16,790 

No. 


509 

00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:21,040 

This means that your service plan 

fits perfectly with his escape route - 


510 

00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,923 

- Or any work 

Here them. 


511 

00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:26,619 

And this is just ridiculous. 


512 

00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:30,316 

is then no chance 

that there is someone here who work for them. 


513 

00:55:30,316 --> 00:55:31,970 

not allow it? 


514 

00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,266 

I know nothing about it 

This is ridiculous. 


515 

00:55:34,266 --> 00:55:40,063 

This is ridiculous! 
I have direct 

access to your cameras across the city. 


516 

00:55:40,063 --> 00:55:44,321 

And I strongly recommend that you replace 

additional service. 


517 

00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:49,378 

- Yes, of course 

- We are happy to help. 
518 

00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,969 

Looking at him. 


519 

00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:13,570 

Orange really highlights your eyes. 


520 

00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:22,338 

- Thank you, Wilson 

- Tell me something, O'Connor. 


521 

00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:25,126 

As can be 

that even if you run around the world - 


522 

00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:29,031 

- And create problems, so I put 

anyway my job on the line for you? 


523 

00:56:29,031 --> 00:56:32,899 

You feel better when you get 

Credit to stop Shaw. 


524 

00:56:32,899 --> 00:56:35,399 

I'm trying to solve for you. 


525 

00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:37,531 

You know what they say, Stasiak. 


526 

00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:43,029 

If you want to catch big fish, then 

be ready to go into deep water. 


527 

00:56:43,029 --> 00:56:46,050 

You know you're an idiot? 


528 

00:56:50,227 --> 00:56:51,938 

I also missed you, man. 


529 

00:56:53,673 --> 00:56:58,970 

From what I have given to you so that you can make 

what you should do. 
You have 24 hours </ I> 


530 

00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:04,313 

<i> You have until 09:00 There examination 

their fingerprints in the database </ I> </ i> 


531 

00:57:04,313 --> 00:57:09,727 

<i> They then find a match 

When this happens, I can not get it out again .. 
</ I> </ i> 


532 

00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:12,852 

<i> Here we are talking about life in prison </ i> </ i> 


533 

00:57:19,711 --> 00:57:22,138 

Cute young. 


534 

00:57:24,711 --> 00:57:28,868 

Braga found that sitting in block D3. 


535 

00:57:28,868 --> 00:57:33,329 

isolation. 
I only have the power 

for you here in prison. 


536 

00:57:33,827 --> 00:57:36,603 

So you must be doing something 

to get his attention. 


537 

00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:39,989 

Sorry, friend. 


538 

00:57:50,992 --> 00:57:53,143 

again! 


539 

00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:03,399 

send Big Brother live soon. 


540 

00:58:07,382 --> 00:58:11,257 

You can not even pick your nose 

London, without anyone knowing. 


541 

00:58:14,421 --> 00:58:17,383 

Hey, you should not mess with it there 

is not a toy. 


542 

00:58:17,383 --> 00:58:21,390 

- What is the problem 

- It is the titanium wire taut. 


543 

00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:24,524 

- What it means 

- It is to maintain bridges upright with?. 


544 

00:58:24,524 --> 00:58:26,375 

things you know nothing about! 


545 

00:58:26,632 --> 00:58:31,695 

The common text is bold enough 

but my ... 
is a masterpiece. 


546 

00:58:32,452 --> 00:58:35,484 

reverse gear and the engine tuned. 


547 

00:58:35,484 --> 00:58:40,741 

- And then I added this container 

- This makes the course even fatter. 


548 

00:58:40,741 --> 00:58:44,336 

- It is not infallible 

- I've been known to use big guns. 


549 

00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:46,521 

And you are known 

use your big head. 


550 

00:58:46,521 --> 00:58:51,529 

Don, I asked around. 
I 

I have the address of a street race tonight. 


551 

00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:45,173 

Brian O'Connor 

It was an entry. 


552 

00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:53,727 

You have placed many people here. 


553 

00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,133 

I figured not, 

that people would recognize it? 


554 

00:59:59,523 --> 01:00:02,542 

I've been watching you. 
555 

01:00:02,805 --> 01:00:08,349 

You really enough hygget you outside 

Rio de Janeiro - 


556 

01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:14,799 

It's exciting to be criminal, not 

that? 
You could have worked for me. 


557 

01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,845 

As Letty Ortiz. 


558 

01:00:18,336 --> 01:00:22,555 

- I buried 

- Did you know? 


559 

01:00:22,555 --> 01:00:25,055 

I can not tell you. 


560 

01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:32,109 

- I know she works with Owen Shaw 

- You still Leger strip, right? 


561 

01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:37,279 

This is way above your level. 


562 

01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:44,766 

You're still as good as dead, 

so it really can not import. 


563 

01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:50,413 

All controlled for Shaw 

substances, weapons, money, ladies ... 


564 

01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:54,954 

He taught me how to think globally 

He made me a rich man. 


565 

01:00:54,954 --> 01:00:58,821 

He had not only cartels 

in the palm of your hand, but also CIA - 


566 

01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,398 

- And DEA 

and all other under control. 


567 

01:01:02,128 --> 01:01:05,836 

He knew what was going to happen, 

even before they did it. 
He knew it - 


568 

01:01:05,836 --> 01:01:12,891 

- A young police would 

insert a wart on my record. 


569 

01:01:25,294 --> 01:01:29,591 

Letty was dead from the moment 

you pasted it. 


570 

01:02:06,705 --> 01:02:10,672 

- She survived 

- It is hard as hell .. 


571 

01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:14,438 

Shaw went to the hospital two days later 

to complete the work. 


572 

01:02:14,438 --> 01:02:19,586 

- But why ... 

- She could not remember anything '. 


573 

01:02:19,586 --> 01:02:22,405 

The perfect girl. 


574 

01:02:23,398 --> 01:02:26,555 

You are lucky 

that there is a door between us. 


575 

01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:37,133 

What happened to Letty, 

is not your fault. 


576 

01:03:09,529 --> 01:03:12,371 

Look at me! 
Look at me! 


577 

01:03:13,068 --> 01:03:14,068 

there. 


578 

01:03:16,773 --> 01:03:20,932 

- The Shaw doing 

- He always knows what your next step. 


579 

01:03:21,553 --> 01:03:25,554 

He is watching you. 

Think about it. 


580 

01:03:28,952 --> 01:03:33,856 

only comes close to Shaw, 

if he wants. 


581 

01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:21,324 

- You really have some big balls 

- I've been told. 


582 

01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:26,090 

- You're lucky I lost 

- I think you hit it, you would. 


583 

01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:29,623 

Really 

What's with you? 


584 

01:05:29,623 --> 01:05:33,398 

- Do you have a death wish 

- If that's what it takes. 


585 

01:05:33,398 --> 01:05:36,328 

I just want to race. 


586 

01:05:36,835 --> 01:05:39,453 

You can lose your car. 


587 

01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:46,107 

- Let's start 

- It's your funeral. 


588 

01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:49,557 

Run or die 

You remember that? 


589 

01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,112 

Listen! 


590 

01:05:59,112 --> 01:06:04,216 

Out here, get used to our will 

This is London, baby.! 


591 

01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:11,885 

Do not take the bait 

Are you ready? 


592 

01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,190 

- Ready 

- Ready. 


593 

01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:17,606 

Ready? 


594 

01:06:22,281 --> 01:06:23,031 

Go! 


595 

01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:16,843 

Just like old times. 


596 

01:08:04,279 --> 01:08:06,833 

He's crazy! 


597 

01:08:44,837 --> 01:08:47,055 

It's just a lie! 


598 

01:09:17,078 --> 01:09:21,341 

- You change gears still very fast 

- I do it for you decelerate. 


599 

01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:25,305 

You lose grip, so the rear slides out. 


600 

01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:28,222 

I have noticed. 


601 

01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:33,248 

You do not know me, 

just because you know how I run. 


602 

01:09:33,748 --> 01:09:36,391 

You know what they say, 

where we come from? 


603 

01:09:36,914 --> 01:09:40,466 

Show me how you drive, 

and I'll tell you who you are. 


604 

01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:46,260 

V8. 
You have never been able 

resist American muscle strength. 


605 

01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:52,834 

beautiful scars. 


606 

01:09:56,963 --> 01:10:00,112 

keep you out of trouble. 


607 

01:10:03,703 --> 01:10:08,375 

- The more that you know about me 

- About You? 


608 

01:10:10,109 --> 01:10:12,305 

Everything. 


609 

01:10:18,419 --> 01:10:22,932 

This scar that you have the night 

we met. 


610 

01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:27,177 

was 15 years 

and you were the first Criterium. 


611 

01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:33,798 

windbag prove 

and fell right next to you. 


612 

01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:38,718 

- You're lucky you did not lose your arm 

- Let me guess again ... 


613 

01:10:39,211 --> 01:10:42,899 

- You saved me 

- No. 


614 

01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:46,227 

I was stupid bladder. 


615 

01:10:48,443 --> 01:10:49,283 

here ... 


616 

01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:59,050 

Boyle Heights. 


617 

01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:04,043 

fled with Mia, 

my little sister, and was pushed into a corner. 


618 

01:11:04,486 --> 01:11:10,058 

You thought it was a good idea 

Cover Torino break through a wall. 


619 

01:11:13,046 --> 01:11:17,054 

Okay 

How about this? 


620 

01:11:20,763 --> 01:11:23,770 

since the last time we were together. 


621 

01:11:28,274 --> 01:11:31,602 

would take him for an evening swim. 


622 

01:11:31,891 --> 01:11:37,180 

rev it on corals. 

follow him. 


623 

01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:41,701 

I still have a scar like. 


624 

01:11:43,664 --> 01:11:45,844 

I do not know what you're doing here - 


625 

01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,219 

- But I think you're out, 

where its depth. 


626 

01:11:57,336 --> 01:12:00,185 

I'm here because of you. 


627 

01:12:03,469 --> 01:12:05,758 

The girl remembers ... 


628 

01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:09,641 

That's not me. 


629 

01:12:10,557 --> 01:12:13,703 

It was not what I saw. 


630 

01:12:15,468 --> 01:12:17,945 

Whether you like it or not - 


631 

01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:22,461 

- You're still the same girl. 


632 

01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:27,318 

I saw out there - 


633 

01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:30,852 

- And I can see it now. 


634 

01:12:33,406 --> 01:12:36,347 

I have to go. 


635 

01:12:36,347 --> 01:12:37,187 

expected. 


636 

01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:50,111 

belongs to you. 


637 

01:13:24,792 --> 01:13:28,883 

she departs, 

and leave it again. 


638 

01:13:30,055 --> 01:13:32,417 

She is extremely fickle. 


639 

01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:36,141 

If violence is what you want 

We can figure this out. 


640 

01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,469 

A street kid, starting with 

to steal DVD players - 


641 

01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:49,297 

- Just stole 100 million in Rio de Janeiro. 


642 

01:13:49,297 --> 01:13:53,617 

- Not bad, huh 

- It's a good story. 


643 

01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:56,607 

It's almost inspiring. 


644 

01:13:56,607 --> 01:13:59,672 

I just do not understand - 


645 

01:14:00,039 --> 01:14:05,718 

- Because it spreads the 

a beach with his Brazilian herring. 


646 

01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:11,844 

No, he chooses to work with a government 

Hobbs mouse. 


647 

01:14:13,994 --> 01:14:16,807 

But then I realized - 


648 

01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,359 

- He has a sore spot. 


649 

01:14:21,277 --> 01:14:25,680 

- We all 

- You know what? 


650 

01:14:26,637 --> 01:14:30,194 

When I was young, "said my brother always - 


651 

01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:33,398 

- You must have a code. 


652 

01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:38,383 

Mine was accuracy. 


653 

01:14:38,383 --> 01:14:42,782 

The team is nothing more than pieces 

moved until the job is done. 


654 

01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:46,945 

is effective and works. 


655 

01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:50,063 

You, on the other hand ... 


656 

01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:53,266 

are loyal to the wrong choice. 


657 

01:14:53,266 --> 01:14:56,211 

Your code is family. 


658 

01:14:57,057 --> 01:15:00,617 

That's good enough for the holidays, 

but it makes you predictable - 


659 

01:15:00,617 --> 01:15:03,352 

- That in our industry 

means vulnerable. 


660 

01:15:03,352 --> 01:15:07,323 

That means I can break you 

when it should be. 


661 

01:15:07,323 --> 01:15:10,828 

When I die, I know the 

least I died. 


662 

01:15:13,818 --> 01:15:16,396 

You have at least one code. 


663 

01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:21,336 

, Most do not. 


664 

01:15:26,302 --> 01:15:29,315 

I'll give you a chance. 


665 

01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:32,089 

Pull your team out. 


666 

01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:36,384 

It is the only way 

you can keep your family safe. 


667 

01:15:37,147 --> 01:15:41,117 

his brother never told 

that one should not threaten the family of a man? 


668 

01:15:42,063 --> 01:15:44,602 

It is very stupid to do that. 


669 

01:15:45,893 --> 01:15:48,922 

But I'll cut it for you cardboard. 


670 

01:15:49,805 --> 01:15:53,398 

I pull out when she does it. 


671 

01:15:54,354 --> 01:15:56,594 

In that case ... 


672 

01:15:57,982 --> 01:16:00,844 

It seems that the story 

came to an end. 


673 

01:16:08,644 --> 01:16:11,617 

If this is how it should be. 


674 

01:16:17,232 --> 01:16:19,539 

Let me guess ... 


675 

01:16:21,337 --> 01:16:22,057 

Hobbs? 


676 

01:16:25,469 --> 01:16:27,867 

Come on, you son of a bitch. 


677 

01:16:28,841 --> 01:16:31,422 

Government rotten. 


678 

01:16:38,289 --> 01:16:42,648 

- I'll talk to you, Toretto 

- You can be absolutely sure. 


679 

01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:59,307 

Riley? 
Shaw will Battersea 

and runs to the southeast. 


680 

01:16:59,307 --> 01:17:02,354 

Get Tej to track him down. 


681 

01:17:02,354 --> 01:17:07,247 

I wonder what would have happened if I 

had placed the tracking device in your car. 


682 

01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,950 

here? 


683 

01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:23,552 

This has me a step closer 

Shaw. 
You should know - 


684 

01:17:23,552 --> 01:17:27,953 

- I hope you come 

closer to what you want. 


685 

01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:47,468 

- Just to have been worth 

- More than you imagine. 


686 

01:18:33,677 --> 01:18:35,813 

That's perfect. 


687 

01:18:55,109 --> 01:18:57,539 

I want to ask you something, Letty - 


688 

01:18:58,353 --> 01:19:02,350 

- And you should think very carefully about 

before answering. 


689 

01:19:02,857 --> 01:19:07,656 

When I say that you should put 

Toretto out of the game - 


690 

01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:12,686 

- What would your first thought be? 


691 

01:19:13,766 --> 01:19:16,994 

Why are you looking me in the eyes - 


692 

01:19:17,516 --> 01:19:21,305 

- And tell me what you see? 


693 

01:19:30,256 --> 01:19:31,336 

Keep it. 


694 

01:19:41,286 --> 01:19:46,175 

- What we have, Tej 

- Follow him - 


695 

01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:51,136 

- But were only able to locate it to a certain limit 

. 
He knows all the blind spots. 


696 

01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:55,785 

We lost the signal here, 

it is within a radius of 800 meters. 


697 

01:19:55,785 --> 01:19:58,859 

If checked the phone records, 

locations ... 
698 

01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:02,406 

There is typically Shaw 

It guards - 


699 

01:20:02,406 --> 01:20:06,305 

- And several outputs. 
The subway 

highway and sewer. 


700 

01:20:06,305 --> 01:20:09,142 

You know, I lose my job. 


701 

01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:12,984 

Let's get this bastard. 


702 

01:20:35,457 --> 01:20:39,210 

They are gone 

there is nothing here. 


703 

01:20:47,352 --> 01:20:49,960 

There is never nothing. 


704 

01:20:56,712 --> 01:20:59,892 

It's always something. 


705 

01:21:05,172 --> 01:21:07,765 

Come on, guys! 


706 

01:21:08,551 --> 01:21:12,491 

Shaw! 
Animal is in effect. 

Everything is on schedule. 


707 

01:21:15,394 --> 01:21:17,832 

Good. 

send it. 


708 

01:21:24,161 --> 01:21:26,898 

What are you, Parker 

Give me something good '. 


709 

01:21:26,898 --> 01:21:30,630 

It was custom paint, 

Shaw was in the shop. 


710 

01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:33,833 

- Heating and radar reflective paint 

- For military use. 


711 

01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:37,753 

Exactly. 
We have a list of 

bases Europeans using - 


712 

01:21:37,753 --> 01:21:42,297 

- But we can not find the type 

- Cross-check it with military objectives Shaw .. 


713 

01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:45,094 

I guarantee that one of them matches. 


714 

01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:49,534 

Bingo 

The NATO base in Spain. 


715 

01:21:49,534 --> 01:21:53,282 

So Shaw in another country 

It has the advantage of eight hours. 


716 

01:21:53,282 --> 01:21:58,230 

Tej, give me information, 

Riley and I base closes. 


717 

01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:02,906 

We must protect the device 

Get their cars flew there. 


718 

01:22:02,906 --> 01:22:07,602 

Get your Spanish stamped on boys 

See you in Spain .. 


719 

01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:33,031 

You fucking bitch! 

You did it! 


720 

01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:36,953 

- And then? 
Good to see you 

- You too. 
What is happening? 


721 

01:22:37,195 --> 01:22:41,828 

They attack a NATO base in Spain 

Shaws people were seen crossing the border. 


722 

01:22:41,828 --> 01:22:45,057 

Hobbs and Riley are taken 

to close the base. 
They meet us there. 


723 

01:22:45,057 --> 01:22:48,630 

- Where is Don 

- He would not leave without you. 


724 

01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:58,552 

I found out what happened to Letty 

It's all my fault. 


725 

01:22:59,588 --> 01:23:01,437 

Brian ... 


726 

01:23:01,437 --> 01:23:05,041 

Whatever you found, 

is for your own good. 


727 

01:23:05,711 --> 01:23:12,010 

we need to do now 

is because of it. 


728 

01:23:14,288 --> 01:23:19,421 

We have put four teams in each clock 

and snipers on rooftops. 


729 

01:23:19,421 --> 01:23:25,026 

Keep your men away. 
When the truck arrives, 

I crush it like the walls of Jericho. 


730 

01:23:25,716 --> 01:23:29,334 

I just caught him here in 

to turn off the security system off. 


731 

01:23:29,334 --> 01:23:32,172 

- Its base is compromised 

- What do you suggest? 


732 

01:23:32,172 --> 01:23:36,813 

We do nothing. 
We follow the protocol. 

Does he think that is where we want it gone. 


733 

01:23:36,813 --> 01:23:39,500 

should be quick and invisible. 


734 

01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:44,560 

get the egg out of the coop, 

and hoping the fox comes. 


735 

01:23:47,742 --> 01:23:51,855 

They only took one of the men Shaw 

hour. 


736 

01:23:51,855 --> 01:23:55,865 

There is something musty know 

The plan was, we were going to catch the guy. 


737 

01:23:55,865 --> 01:23:59,430 

Think about it. 
Interpol ... 

You came face to face with him. 


738 

01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:02,555 

- What do you suggest 

- Braga said - 


739 

01:24:02,555 --> 01:24:06,797 

- That only comes close to Shaw, 

740 

01:24:06,797 --> 01:24:11,449 

- Where is Tej device 

- Move it to a safe place. 


741 

01:24:15,971 --> 01:24:19,948 

- Shaw does not attack the base 

- It attacks the convoy. 


742 

01:24:54,013 --> 01:24:54,733 

743 

01:25:23,887 --> 01:25:27,934 

- The convoy was attacked 

- Get a helicopter immediately! 


744 

01:25:43,614 --> 01:25:46,893 

I'd better hurry up, guys 

They just took the train. 


745 

01:25:49,827 --> 01:25:53,327 

Sun. .. 

Letty are with them. 


746 

01:25:53,573 --> 01:25:56,031 

stick to the plan. 


747 

01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:06,753 

hear him.



Let's get this over with. 

They should not get away. 


748 

01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,422 

system is ready. 


749 

01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:51,005 

We must have another plan, guys. 


750 

01:26:53,563 --> 01:26:57,906 

- They have a tank 

- Someone just one tank.! 


751 

01:27:03,534 --> 01:27:07,376 

We have company, personal 

Toretto coming your way. 


752 

01:27:07,376 --> 01:27:10,023 

Okay 

Make weapons ready. 


753 

01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:14,516 

Give me satellite images. 


754 

01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:12,091 

- They are straight 

- There you are. 


755 

01:28:26,018 --> 01:28:30,611 

- Who has a plan B 

- Plan B? 
We need Plan C, D and E! 


756 

01:28:30,611 --> 01:28:34,586 

- We need more alphabets 

- We do what we do best! 


757 

01:28:35,194 --> 01:28:38,109 

improvise! 


758 

01:28:52,864 --> 01:28:57,589 

Take us to the other side 

Let's have some fun. 


759 

01:29:13,158 --> 01:29:16,831 

What the hell is wrong with you 

That was not part of the plan. 


760 

01:29:28,437 --> 01:29:31,354 

Get their attention away from the people! 


761 

01:29:43,573 --> 01:29:46,233 

You do not, Shaw! 


762 

01:29:56,533 --> 01:29:59,801 

- We have one right in front of us 

- Who.? 


763 

01:30:01,175 --> 01:30:03,707 

Satan in hell! 


764 

01:30:09,129 --> 01:30:11,521 

lucky! 


765 

01:30:12,185 --> 01:30:14,893 

Hold, Roman! 


766 

01:30:18,868 --> 01:30:23,616 

Do something! 
Someone 

I have a tank in the ass! 


767 

01:30:25,137 --> 01:30:27,842 

There must be an opening somewhere. 


768 

01:30:31,339 --> 01:30:34,677 

Well, look there 

A bridge. 


769 

01:31:04,455 --> 01:31:06,408 

Fuck that. 


770 

01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:44,320 

design a car for us. 


771 

01:31:44,891 --> 01:31:49,242 

- Brian! 
The car is a good anchor 

- I got it! 


772 

01:32:15,375 --> 01:32:19,427 

- Shaw! 
We must get rid of the car 

- Get out of Letty. 


773 

01:32:39,354 --> 01:32:42,144 

- What is she doing 

- Shit! 


774 

01:32:42,552 --> 01:32:44,501 

Ok, Toretto. 


775 

01:32:47,073 --> 01:32:49,409 

Here you have your girl ... 


776 

01:32:50,881 --> 01:32:54,657 

- ... 
And his happy ending 

- Letty! 


777 

01:33:29,378 --> 01:33:31,641 

Hell ... 


778 

01:33:39,163 --> 01:33:42,950 

I can not believe they stole a tank 

to pick up a chip of 85 grams. 


779 

01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:47,289 

The chip is more deadly 

1000 tanks. 


780 

01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:52,583 

What about it? 


781 

01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:55,750 

- There she is 

- She worked with Shaw. 


782 

01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:58,560 

past tense. 


783 

01:33:59,289 --> 01:34:02,430 

But she was always one of us. 


784 

01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:06,615 

Let's give them a moment. 


785 

01:34:19,957 --> 01:34:22,104 

Let's find Shaw and his men. 


786 

01:34:22,104 --> 01:34:25,831 

I never had fun 

so much to write report. 


787 

01:34:47,459 --> 01:34:50,128 

Do not know 

know how to say this, but ... 


788 

01:34:54,625 --> 01:35:00,328 

It's all my fault 

It was I who entered you undercover. 


789 

01:35:01,637 --> 01:35:04,461 

I do not quite remember anything - 


790 

01:35:04,461 --> 01:35:07,805 

- But I know that at least 

something about myself. 


791 

01:35:07,805 --> 01:35:11,727 

You can not make me do anything 

I do not want. 


792 

01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,552 

So what is our next adventure? 


793 

01:35:28,583 --> 01:35:32,203 

What do you mean calm down? 


794 

01:35:33,052 --> 01:35:38,742 

- Where would 

- Tokyo? 
You always spoke. 


795 

01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,414 

So we say Tokyo. 


796 

01:35:49,219 --> 01:35:51,726 

Can I ask you something? 


797 

01:35:59,805 --> 01:36:04,419 

How did you know that there would be 

be a car to break his fall? 


798 

01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:07,323 

I did not. 


799 

01:36:10,418 --> 01:36:14,195 

Sometimes you have to just 

have faith in him. 


800 

01:36:15,521 --> 01:36:19,555 

Toretto 

You gotta hear this. 


801 

01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,890 

I truly believe that I won. 


802 

01:36:36,606 --> 01:36:38,941 

code I live by - 


803 

01:36:38,941 --> 01:36:43,147 

- 

that's why I've never been in the game. 


804 

01:36:44,711 --> 01:36:49,748 

I said that would happen 

is pulled up, Toretto. 


805 

01:36:50,022 --> 01:36:52,782 

- Move 

- But you did not listen. 


806 

01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:59,016 

I said I could break it, 

when it should be. 


807 

01:37:00,521 --> 01:37:01,361 

I made. 


808 

01:37:05,723 --> 01:37:07,690 

Move! 
Now! 


809 

01:37:07,690 --> 01:37:10,997 

Maybe you should call Mia. 


810 

01:37:23,314 --> 01:37:25,667 

- Mia 

- Brian! 


811 

01:37:42,911 --> 01:37:46,149 

This is how it will happen. 


812 

01:37:46,149 --> 01:37:50,146 

take the handcuffs on me 

and then give me the chip - 


813 

01:37:50,146 --> 01:37:54,688 

- And let me go outside to follow 

- He must be kidding. 


814 

01:37:58,523 --> 01:38:00,969 

Look at it again. 


815 

01:38:03,651 --> 01:38:06,881 

- Ask him if it's my joke 

- A hostage - 


816 

01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:10,904 

- For weighing no heavier than 

threat to millions of people. 


817 

01:38:10,904 --> 01:38:14,561 

Sorry 

but nothing changes! 


818 

01:38:19,799 --> 01:38:22,203 

changes everything. 


819 

01:38:22,617 --> 01:38:25,867 

Tell your men to lay down their arms. 


820 

01:38:28,147 --> 01:38:31,241 

Put your weapons. 


821 

01:38:31,859 --> 01:38:35,516 

Toretto, you need to know - 


822 

01:38:35,516 --> 01:38:39,010 

- Until the moment he leaves 

the door with the chip - 


823 

01:38:39,466 --> 01:38:44,586 

- So will words like "amnesty" and "forgiveness" 

with him. 


824 

01:38:49,937 --> 01:38:53,419 

The words disappeared on the day we were born. 


825 

01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:25,823 

Are you coming, baby? 


826 

01:39:30,289 --> 01:39:35,883 

. 
Clear 

I do not miss it. 


827 

01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:41,114 

Like I said - 


828 

01:39:42,027 --> 01:39:44,891 

- So I was never in the game. 


829 

01:39:45,164 --> 01:39:49,799 

If I see on the horizon, the girl is dead. 


830 

01:40:02,517 --> 01:40:09,172 

- What do we do with her sister Torettos 

- We do not need it anymore '. 


831 

01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:12,399 

call failed 


832 

01:40:13,713 --> 01:40:16,851 

I just blocked all signals. 


833 

01:40:18,818 --> 01:40:19,538 

Come on! 


834 

01:40:20,874 --> 01:40:23,174 

I'll go with you. 


835 

01:40:56,082 --> 01:41:01,483 

Where the hell does he think he will 

We are on a military base! 
He's stuck! 


836 

01:41:08,527 --> 01:41:13,117 

You can not keep your mouth shut 

Now there's a plan! 


837 

01:41:13,117 --> 01:41:16,828 

Not a plane. 

It's a plane! 


838 

01:41:20,096 --> 01:41:23,812 

Open the hatch. 


839 

01:41:32,476 --> 01:41:36,534 

She is as good as dead, 

if Shaw escapes. 


840 

01:41:39,965 --> 01:41:42,732 

So we let him get away. 


841 

01:41:49,495 --> 01:41:52,359 

Let's do it. 


842 

01:42:00,052 --> 01:42:04,074 

- Run or die 

- Run or die. 


843 

01:43:29,113 --> 01:43:31,623 

Ask them to light! 


844 

01:43:32,052 --> 01:43:35,230 

- Easy! 
! 
Easy 

- We have a lot of weight on board! 


845 

01:43:35,230 --> 01:43:37,769 

We need more speed! 


846 

01:43:41,142 --> 01:43:46,109 

Hover your mouse over the wing 

I can hit the cap, can not help. 


847 

01:43:50,514 --> 01:43:54,716 

- Take care of yourself 

- This is child's play. 


848 

01:44:07,597 --> 01:44:09,841 

What's happening out there? 


849 

01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,682 

Take the wheel! 


850 

01:45:00,371 --> 01:45:01,371 

No! 


851 

01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:11,065 

Move! 


852 

01:45:27,543 --> 01:45:30,050 

Get in the car with you. 


853 

01:47:16,866 --> 01:47:19,453 

Can ease now 

854 

01:48:30,585 --> 01:48:36,629 

- You knock 

- You better wear your seatbelt. 
855 

01:48:58,082 --> 01:49:00,672 

wrong team, bitch! 


856 

01:49:42,403 --> 01:49:43,123 

Shit! 


857 

01:50:04,557 --> 01:50:04,807 

! 


858 

01:50:21,916 --> 01:50:23,166 

You. 


859 

01:50:49,621 --> 01:50:53,184 

Hit the tab 

They pull us down! 


860 

01:51:22,062 --> 01:51:24,639 

Pull up! 
Up! 


861 

01:51:32,866 --> 01:51:35,901 

Direction Team 

Come on! 
It crashes! 


862 

01:51:35,901 --> 01:51:37,763 

863 

01:51:41,091 --> 01:51:42,091 

Hop! 


864 

01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:55,130 

865 

01:51:59,621 --> 01:52:00,621 

Sun! 


866 

01:55:05,608 --> 01:55:08,327 

Where is Gisele? 


867 

01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:13,725 

868 

01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:45,925 

So all this is worth billions more? 


869 

01:55:49,937 --> 01:55:50,777 

Yes, it is. 


870 

01:55:56,023 --> 01:55:58,876 

Mention your price, Dom 


871 

01:56:02,245 --> 01:56:03,245 


872 

01:56:30,414 --> 01:56:35,094 

- Please do not burn them again 

- I'll never know. 


873 

01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:44,088 

air is polluted, 

and traffic is hell, but ... 


874 

01:56:44,088 --> 01:56:48,503 

- I think you'll like 

-. 
Yes Here you can have your own garage. 


875 

01:56:48,503 --> 01:56:51,648 

- You can build a car with his father 

- We need to build a car? 


876 

01:56:51,648 --> 01:56:54,648 

Your first car should be a charger, Jack. 


877 

01:56:55,500 --> 01:57:00,250 

- Certainly a mean Skyline 

- As I said, it is a Toretto '. 


878 

01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:03,453 

- You confuse 

- If he gets away with it.? 


879 

01:57:03,453 --> 01:57:06,672 

Are you really going to do it 

In Tokyo, exactly? 


880 

01:57:07,570 --> 01:57:10,180 

Yes, there is something I need. 


881 

01:57:10,541 --> 01:57:14,971 

You know we're behind you ... 

anytime. 


882 

01:57:18,055 --> 01:57:20,438 

Mia 

It is better to keep the baby oil! 


883 

01:57:20,438 --> 01:57:23,874 

- It's just gas 

- It's best to save his forehead giant .. 


884 

01:57:26,559 --> 01:57:30,973 

Now it's official 

are all free .. 


885 

01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:36,696 

Not bad for 

you work for me. 


886 

01:57:38,234 --> 01:57:41,385 

We are all well, 

that worked for me. 


887 

01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:44,055 

Let's agree to disagree. 


888 

01:57:44,055 --> 01:57:46,422 

- Thank you 

- Good luck .. 


889 

01:57:48,689 --> 01:57:51,166 

- Elena 

- Letty .. 


890 

01:57:51,422 --> 01:57:53,695 

It will be strange ... 


891 

01:57:53,695 --> 01:57:56,203 

... 
and sexy as hell! 


892 

01:57:56,646 --> 01:58:01,008 

I want to thank you for everything, 

you have done for him and for us. 


893 

01:58:01,906 --> 01:58:04,422 

It requires a great woman. 


894 

01:58:05,918 --> 01:58:10,473 

- He is a great man 

- Yes, he is. 


895 

01:58:10,831 --> 01:58:14,212 

Try to keep it out of trouble. 


896 

01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:19,888 

- You know very well, I can not 

- Yes, I know. 


897 

01:58:22,336 --> 01:58:25,984 

not bad for a cop to be. 


898 

01:58:32,237 --> 01:58:35,711 

I never thought I should trust a criminal. 


899 

01:58:37,331 --> 01:58:41,750 

will talk to you 

- We do. 


900 

01:58:49,328 --> 01:58:51,414 

Elena ... 


901 

01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:02,872 

You will not, 

just so you know. 


902 

01:59:03,471 --> 01:59:07,518 

All this ... 

Is your family. 


903 

01:59:07,984 --> 01:59:13,222 

It's who you are 

This is my family. 


904 

01:59:14,307 --> 01:59:17,193 

It's who I am. 


905 

01:59:34,513 --> 01:59:37,503 

Let's get something to eat! 


906 

01:59:39,969 --> 01:59:42,242 

Let's start. 


907 

01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:48,794 

He was first, then he should say grace 

These are the rules .. 


908 

01:59:51,096 --> 01:59:54,198 

This family? 


909 

01:59:57,493 --> 01:59:58,333 

No. ... 


910 

02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:04,396 

but it looks like a house. 


911 

02:00:04,734 --> 02:00:09,109 

- It's good enough for me 

- Come on. 
912 

02:00:10,344 --> 02:00:12,854 

Ok, Roman ... 


913 

02:00:13,687 --> 02:00:15,913 

bless our table. 


914 

02:00:21,211 --> 02:00:24,579 

Thank you, Father, for we gather 

with our friends. 


915 

02:00:24,579 --> 02:00:30,191 

We thank Thee for the choices we made, 

for they make us who we are. 


916 

02:00:30,191 --> 02:00:34,085 

Let us always remember our loved ones, 

lost. 


917 

02:00:34,085 --> 02:00:39,567 

Thanks for the newest, 

and thank you, because we have back Letty - 


918 

02:00:39,567 --> 02:00:41,351 

- And first ... 


919 

02:00:41,351 --> 02:00:45,766 

Thank you for fast cars!
