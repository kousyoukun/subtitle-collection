00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,881
Great. So, since I
have you for a second,

159
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,521
you told me to remind you
exactly a year ago today

160
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,241
that it's been three years
since my last pay increase.

161
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,845
I don't think that's true.

162
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,570
That doesn't ring...

163
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,290
Does that seem
accurate to you?

164
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,404
That sounds false.

165
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,769
But you crushed
it tonight!

166
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,491
CLAIRE: It's not false, Tito.
It's entirely accurate.

167
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,841
And I wrote
down what you said.

168
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,730
Oh, Claire, I don't know why
you always have to quote.

wildly inappropriate.

I do a great job.

176
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,767
I made myself available
for you 24 hours a day

177
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,366
while being a single mom,
I might add.

178
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
I deserve a raise

179

I'd like
"Executive Assistant."

180
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,082
Now that surprises me, 'cause I did
not know that you had a child.

181
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,491
Was that through...
Was that through intercourse?

182
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,761
Yes.

MICHELLE: You know what?
Good for you.

184
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,247
Michelle, if you can't
give me a raise,

185
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,845
I can't continue
to work here.

186

showed up to my seminar.

I love it.

188
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,003
I didn't know if you were
listening all these years.

189
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,206
What am I always saying?

190
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,446
"Don't go in that room."

191
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,171
MICHELLE: True. I do say that.
But I also say,

192
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,165
"If you want something,
you gotta take it."

193
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,288
Claire, you just took it.

194
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,203
And you grew
a pair in the process.

195

I'm holding your earrings.
(CHUCKLES)

196

You're holding
a pair of earrings

197
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,403
that in 2001,
I paid $62,000 for.

198
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,806
And that's your raise, now.
That's a good raise.

199
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,006
And you earned it.

200

in on my Takoro deal?

215

You know what? A

that Takoro was merging
with Samson International.

217

Ida Marquette.

a terrific relationship.

That's one way
to look at it.

250
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,170
Michelle, I want to
talk about you.

251
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,244
That you were, basically,
abandoned as a child,

252
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,846
bounced around from foster
home to foster home,

253
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,764
and that, really, you were
raised in an orphanage.

254
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,126
No,no,no.

255
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,525
I was lucky enough to attend a
beautiful, lovely elite boarding school,

256
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,206
very much like Hogwarts,
to give you a visual.

257
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,648
And almost as magical.
I feel very lucky.

258

Where'd you get that?

259
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,844
GAYLE: We've got a really
good research team,

260
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,809
and when I look at that
picture, I don't think "elite."

261
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,564
Can we talk about
this for a second?

262
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,808
This interview is over.
Where are you going?

263

I was not trying to
upset you, Michelle.

Why are you leaving? MICHELLE:
You know what, Gayle?

265

Pretty exciting, huh?

311
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,771
Fuck off, Bryce!

312

listen up, everybody.</i>

313
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,326
<i>I'd like you all to join me</i>

314
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,850
in offering a hearty congratulations
to our newest senior VP.

Michelle Darnell!

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,081
Oh, my...

317
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,810
What? (CHUCKLING) Oh, my God.

318

(STAMMERING)

319
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,526
I totally...

320
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,922
Fuck off if you
think that you can take

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,650
my client list and I
wasn't gonna notice.

322
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,767
You bitch.

323
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,605
Oh, thank you!
That's so supportive, Ron.

324
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,444
I couldn't have
done it without you.

325
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,330
Ron! Coffee!

326
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,131
"Ron" is gone.

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,600

MICHELLE:
It's bullshit, Marty.

330
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,080
I take one little
tip from an insider

331
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,447
and I find myself in
an absolute hellhole.

332
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,888
I mean, look at me, fighting
for my life in the yard.

333
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,371
MARTY: Well,
the news gets worse.

334
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,881
All your accounts have been frozen.
MICHELLE: What?

335
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,208
Your shareholders
have all sold off.

336
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,169
Renault is orchestrating
a hostile takeover

337
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,123
of your entire
holding company.

338
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,123
Darnell Enterprises is bankrupt.
No.

339
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,851
Can he do that? Turn
off the machine, Don.

340
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,126
No, he cannot.

341
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,885
Yes, he can. He actually
did it beautifully.

That's my Adam's apple,
you bitch!

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,963
Claire, get me
a new lawyer.

345
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,087
There's not gonna
be another lawyer

346
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,326

any money,

you stupid ginger!

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,165
You know what? I'm a ginger,
but I'm a natural redhead.

349
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,730
Not that you're
ever gonna find out.

350
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,485
Because you will neverbeinvfled
into my basement.

351
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,244
I don't wanna
see your basement!

MICHELLE: Yes, you do!

And by the way,
Claire works for me.

CLAIRE: Actually, Michelle,

355
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,400
I can't work for you anymore.
I got a new job.

356
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,244
I just came to tell
you as a courtesy.

357
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,404
I would think
a courtesy would be

358
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,767
you sticking with me through
my tough times, Claire.

359
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,922
I would. You know I have a
kid to think about, so...

360
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,365
You have a kid?

361
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,161
Ican1teHif you're joking
because I did tell you

362
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,208
that I do have a kid.
And I... lam.

363
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,287
Remember?
Yes.

364
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,767
You do? lam. I'm joking.
I gotcha.

00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,080
Okay.
Zinger.

366

MICHELLE: Hello, gal. I wasn't
into you but I was flattered.

367
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,768
Okay, here we go. Tom, do you
mind grabbing that bag for me?

368
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,204
Kimberly, I thought
you had today off.

369
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,327
Yeah, I knew
you were leaving.

370
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,606
You're sweet, Kimberly.
(CHUCKLES)

371
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,364
Now, you're gonna remember
what I told you?

372
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,407
Yes.
Okay?

373

go up and down.

Thank you so
much, Michelle.

Thank you, Tom.
You're so sweet.

We're actually gonna miss
you around here. (snons)

Well, I would hope so!
It sounds right to me.

my freedom.

Did you set up a ride?

383
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,490
No, I was assuming
that a town car

384
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,085
or something
would be provided.

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,770
Well, could you
call a cab?

389
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,006
I'll get one myself.

Can you please stop
ringing the door?

Hi. Does Claire Rawlings
live here?

I don't know.

398
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,282
You don't know because you're
not very bright, or...

I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

Claire's daughter?

I thought you were in jail.

402
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,730
Aren't you charming for yelling
that out on the street like that.

403
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,766
May I?

404
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,921
No way.

405
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,600
MICHELLE; Why not?

406
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,604
Because Mom's at work and
you're fresh out of prison.

407

Okay, white-collar
crime doesn't count!

Yes, it does!

No, it does not.
It does not.

Hi, Dana.

My goodness,
you are so late.

416
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,561
I am?

417
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,886
You're right. You're
absolutely right, Dana.

418
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,689
I'm three minutes late.

419
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,491
Hey, do you work at
the excuse factory?

420
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,646
I wasn't making an excuse. I was
just agreeing that I was a little...

421
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,085
Well, I think that
you're saying

422
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,242
this is an
excuse factory, right?

423
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,771
Hey! Yo, Dana!
Hey, hey, hey.

424
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,410
MIKE: So, hey,
I wanted to tell you.

425
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,369
There is a bunch of people
gathered in the break room...

426
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,407
What, why?

427
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,244
...just raving about
your fourth-quarter review.

428
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,526
Who is? What?

429
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,926
That's why I was late.

430
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,806
Because we were all up there, you know,
trading our favorite Dana stories.

431
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,689
So it was...
It's positive...

432
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,171
It's good buzz? There's
a lot of good buzz?

433
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,924
Buzzworthy. Absolutely, yeah.
I mean, they're raving.

434
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,168
I have to go get coffee. Yeah, you do.
(CHUCKLING)

435
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,324
She's a nightmare. She's a tool.
(sncsns)

436
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,811
She's so many things.

437
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,848
She is definitely
a lot of things.

438
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,126
Uh... (CHUCKLING)

439
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,761
Look at this, look at this! We have
so much in common, me and you.

440
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,171
We have a good
banter here, right?

441
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,241
A little back and forth.

442
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,765
I think maybe we should

443
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,763
try and keep this little
banter wagon going, right?

444
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,966
Maybe we can go hang out...

445
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,567
We can dish about the boss,
and gossip about stuff and...

446
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,923
You know, probably do it
over dinner or something,

447
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,002
'cause all that dishing
can be exhausting.

448
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,570
Work up an appetite.

449
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,530
Yeah, well, I'm...
First of all, I'm flattered.

450
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,206
It's a little
complicated for me.

451
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,284
I'm a single mom and I
really try to, you know,

452
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,328
devote a ton of
energy to my kid,

453
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,526
and see her as
much as possible.

454
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,604
I just don't think
that it's a good time.

455
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,250
Yeah, cool.

456
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,845
I was hoping
you would say that

457
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,048
because I love rejection,
so... (CHUCKLING)

458
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,646
Cool.
Cool.

459
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,767
Sorry.

460
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,889

MICHELLE: Hello.
Hi!

463
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,244
Hi. Hello, Claire.

464
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,721
Surprise!

465
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,404
What are you
doing here?

466
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,530
Oh, well, I had stopped
at our old office

467
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,242

pick up my things.

terrific, was a Dorito.

I think it was
the cheese.

I mean not a cheese found in
nature, but cheese-adjacent.

it was wonderful.

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,043
No! I don't who
the fuck you three are.

625
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,161
But I'll guess this.

626
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,288
I bet you got here
climbing on my back somehow.

627
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,328
Carl, I gave you
that Landis account.

628
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,610
I handed you your career and I'm
the one that made Pam a sales rep!

629
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,806
Pam is dead.

630
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,331
Pam was a whore!

631
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,006
She fucked her way through
the whole IT department.

632
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,208
And Terri knows it, 'cause
you were in on it, too!

633
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,010
MICHELLE: Yeah!
CARL: The tech guys?

634
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,570
You think Pam did
all the tech guys?

635
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,287
The lowest, weirdest,
saddestguys!

636
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,691
That's who Pam fucked!

637
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,250
Go to hell, Michelle!
Go to hell!

638
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,130
When I get to hell, I'll tell
Pam that you said hello,

639
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,282
'cause she's probably down
there fucking IT guys.

640
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,644
Weird little guys, carrying
wires around in weird hats.

641
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,290
That's who she's
fucking in hell.

642
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,361
Yeah.

643
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,761
I don't need you.

644
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,491
I don't need you and
you're gonna be sorry.

645
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,005
'Cause I got
a sweet deal for you

646
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,605
and you're
letting it walk out.

647
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,160
You know, you want to be dumbasses?
Be my guest.

648
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,402
I'll tell you what,
you're gonna regret this.

649
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,086
Yow!

650
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,531
(GROANING)

651
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,928
Yow! Son of a bitch!

652
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,530
Holy shit!
Son of a bitch!

653
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,045
How'd she survive that?

654
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,804
BRYCE: 'Cause she's horrible.

655
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,961
Let's go.

656
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,565
MICHELLE: Mother of shite!

657
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,530
I dinged my pelvis again.

658
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,681
Ah.

659
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,327
(EXHALES)

660
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,811
Tell me everything.
Okay.

661
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,169
So, right off the top, Bryce
ordered a Nicoise salad

662
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,641
but he asked for the tuna
to be really well done.

663
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,041
But if it's a quality piece of
tuna, you don't wanna have it...

664
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,088
Not relevant.
Okay, right.

665
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,601
Bryce did everything
you asked him to do.

666
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,841
Michelle came in.
She was like,

667
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,001
"I wanna be in a business."

668
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,650
And he was like,
"No dice."

669
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,366
And then, she fell
down a flight of stairs.

670
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,488
(GASPS) Did she hurt
her wonderful body?

671
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,449
I have a video of it.
Do you wanna see?

672
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,761
MICHELLE: I'll <i>fell</i> you <i>what.</i>

673
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,321
Oh, look at her.
STEPHAN: Mmm-hmm.

674
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,286
On. (LAUGHING)

675
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,206
(BOTH LAUGHING)

676
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,525
Oh.

677
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,250
<i>DR. OZ: So you see
the normal intestine.</i>

678
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,683
<i>Now, notice the difference between
that intestine and this intestine.</i>

679
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,843
I'm getting light-headed. ls
there any of that brownie left?

680
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,849
Yeah. I feel like my
blood sugar's dropping.

681
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,924
I should probably pop
it with a little sugar.

682
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,928
Holy shit!
That is a good brownie.

683
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,001
Language.

684
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,923
Well, I'm sorry, you give
me a holy-shit brownie.

685
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,206
I'm gonna say,
"Holy shit!"

686
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,205
'Cause holy shit,
this is a good brownie.

687
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,601
I can't believe... Your
mom makes these, right?

688
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,603
Yeah, it's a family recipe.

689
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,041
Hi!

690
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,730
I'm pretty sure Michelle
has diverticulitis.

691
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,131
What?
MICHELLE: I got it.

692
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,769
I think it's
pretty advanced, Claire.

693
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,080
CLAIRE: Who said that?

694
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,241
Doctor Oz.

695
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,481
MICHELLE: Look.

696
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,726
Oh, my God!

697
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,404
There's my colon again.

698
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,290
Okay, you need
to get off the couch

699
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,727
because you've been laying
down for about three weeks.

700
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,246
And, also, you have to start
pulling your weight around here.

701
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,446
We can start tonight.

702
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,602
You can take Rachel
to her Dandelions meeting.

703
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,643
What? Why aren't you taking me?

704
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,767
Sweetie, I can't.

705
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,084
My boss, who is a massive
fan of yours, by the way,

706
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,401
has decided I need to go
back in for the evening.

707
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,481
CLAIRE: Okay?
(CLAPS HANDS)

708
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,525
Let's go! The most important part of
the plan being "get off the couch."

709
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,686
I don't think I
like sassy Claire.

710
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,605
MICHELLE: All right. I want you to
give me the lowdown on this meeting.

711
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,762
What are my opportunities?
What are my pitfalls?

712
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,171
RACHEL: What do you mean?

713
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,447
MICHELLE: Well, I want to
know what I'm walking into.

714
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,568
RACHEL: Oh,
everyone's pretty nice.

715
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,442
I forgot how many people ride
the It's kind of fascinating.

716
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,445
Some people depend on this.
Like, they don't have a car.

717
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,167
Well, I know that.

718
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,528
MICHELLE: Roller-skating
or roller-blading?

719
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,487
Roller-blading.

720
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,289
Honey or agave nectar?

721
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,044
Agave.
No, they're both terrible.

722
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,329
Cell phone, landline?

723
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,641
What?
Oh, God.

724
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,809
Do you not know
what that means?

725
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,848
No.
(SIGHS) Oh, Jesus.

726
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,721
MICHELLE: Okay, this
should be interesting.

727
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,442
Ladies, big news.
Great news.

728
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,450
Marsha Swan's tabby cat,
Spaghetti, is on the mend

729
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,683
and expected to
make a full recovery.

730
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,046
YaY, Spaghetti!

731
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,726
Yay!

732
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,004
My daughter, Beth, was so
worried about Spaghetti.

733
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,003
Thank goodness she's
back on her feet.

734
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,084
Funny fact about Spaghetti,
she hates spaghetti.

735
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,409
You seem fucking
crazy to me.

736
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,447
Excuse me?

737
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,170
Cute <i>as</i> a daisy to me.
(GIGGLING)

738
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,162
SANDY: Okay, now,
not to sound too kookie,

739
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,084
but let's talk
"cookie" sales, that is.

740
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,480
(ALL LAUGHING)

741
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,684
Okay, so this year,
we came in with $21,000.

742
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,729
Pretty good job, big bucks.

743
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,603
But Detroit is still in the lead
for the year with $189,000.

744
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,730
Can I just ask you,
are these numbers

745
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,524
you're talking about
just cookie sales?

746
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,570
And, if so, how many troupes
are we talking about here?

747
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,251
There are 3.2 million
Dandelions all over the world

748
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,369
blown across the earth,
making a difference.

749
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,646
Is this global?

750
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,368
Wait, I recognize you.
You're Michelle Darnell.

751
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,209
Please, don't make a fuss.

752
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,770
Oh, I'm gonna
make a fuss.

753
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,684
You're a convicted felon sitting
in a room full of children.

754
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,966
You're a criminal.

755
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,405
It was white-collar crime.

756
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,084
Okay, you don't
have to defend me.

757
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,491
You're such
alosen

758
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,570
I'm sorry,
what did he say?

759
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,921
What?

760
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,240
SANDY: Well, I would...
(WHISPERING) Yeah.

761
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,890
Excuse me. Hi.

762
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,086
MICHELLE: I gotta ask you.

763
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,926
Now are we talking part-time
or full-time employees here?

764
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,924
Nope, just happy volunteers.

765
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,001
What?

766
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,923
For your information,
jailbird...

767
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,765
She seems great.

768
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,127
The Dandelions helps girls
build leadership skills.

769
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,043
It looks good on their
high-school transcript

770
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,690
and they are bettering
their community,

771
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,290
which is more than
I can say for you.

772
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,408
A-ha. What is your name?

773
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,760
Helen Kreagan.

774
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,491
Oh, you know what? I think you
dropped something right here.

775
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,164
You go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself.

776
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,806
(WHISPERING)
Go fuck yourself.

777
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,810
I don't think you know
who you're talking to.

778
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,451
I think I do. And I think
I want you to fuck off.

9h, my gosh!

782
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,202
Can we just take a minute and
give congrats to Sarah, here?

783
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,770
Thank you. It's Sandy.
It's Sandy.

784
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,484
Or Sandy.
I like Sarah.

785
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,971
Whatever, either one.

786
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,203
I gotta know how much are you
selling these boxes for?

787
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,961
SANDY: Girls.
GROUP: $7.

788
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,201
MICHELLE: $7?

789
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,960
Ka-ching, right?

790
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,045
I got a guy in Shanghai who can make
this same box of cookies, 19 cents.

791
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,487
This is an official meeting
and you're interrupting it.

792
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,164
Let's take a poll,
show of hands.

793
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,930
Who finds Helen
to be a bummer?

794
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,888

I object to parolees
attending our meetings

799

and I'd like to put
that in the minutes.

May I?

801
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,810
Let me just handle this.

802
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,928
Another great point
by Helen.

If you don't get
off my fucking back,

MICHELLE: Sandy,
I love that kerchief.

811
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,881
(SOFTLY) Was that necessary?

812
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,485

Hi!
What are you doing?

817
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,726
What is all this?

818
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,370
This is my way
back, m'kay?

You are looking
at Darnell 2.0.

820
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,570
I wondered when
you were getting up.

821
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,444
Have you not
gone to bed yet?

822
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,284
No, I have been
up and percolating

since 11:00 p.m.
last night.

824
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,203
Just great stuff, Claire! Okay.

825
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,406
You're having a breakdown.

826
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,007
No,no,no! I'm having a
breakthrough, because of you.

827
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,889
Sit down,
I gotta show you this.

828
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,488
Let me introduce you
to my new golden goose...

Darnell's Darlings.

830
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,881
Rough sketches.

831
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,530
So, I know.
Those will be perfected.

832
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,171
But, really, tell me,
what's your initial thoughts?

833
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,404
Stalin.
Okay.

834

Communist youth.
All right!

835
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,325
Japanese-y black power?

836
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,971
My takeaway from
that is "powerful."

837
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,971
Powerful imagery and I'll take
that any day of the week.

838
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,207
Why are you up?

839
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,607
Sit down, sleepyhead.
Let's wake it up.

840
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,082
Claire, we're gonna
start a brownie company.

841
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,925
No, we're gonna
start a brownie empire.

842
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,571
Okay? And we're gonna call it
Darnell's Darlings.

843
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,049
Illinois alone has
25,000 Dandelions.

844
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:42,001
They're pulling in,
in one year, $32,500,000.

845
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,249
This is a global company.

846
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,846
The Dandelions are making
a billion dollars a year.

847
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,369
Is that going in your pocket?
Helen's probably pocketing it.

848
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,283
I mean, that horrible
bitch would take teeth

849
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,289
right out of a kid.
Am I wrong?

850
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,842
If she could sell teeth,
she'd rip kids' teeth out.

851
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,966
I'm gonna let it go,
but Helen's horrible.

852
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,929
The Dandelions are
a non-profit, Michelle.

853
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,128
That money goes back into
great programs for the girls.

854
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,043
MICHELLE: Oh, great programs?
That's interesting.

855
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,168
Rachel, do me a favor.

856
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,767
Tell your mom what was the last
"great program" you completed.

857
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,564
Go ahead, go ahead.

858
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,689
Scout leader Sandy gave me a
"Social Butterfly" badge.

859
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,966
That's great!

860
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,487
Tell her what a "Social
Butterfly" badgeis.

861
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,043
I had to hold a conversation with
a new person for 30 minutes...

862
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,681
Okay.
...and demonstrate

863
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,330
how to be
a good hostess.

864
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,930
Next week, I'm thinking maybe
they'll arrange marriages.

865
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,208
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna design

866
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,288
a special new badge
for the Dandelions.

867
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,204
It's gonna be a real big one,
so no one misses it.

868
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,044
And I'm gonna make it
a picture of a woman.

869
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,091
A real sad woman with apron strings
on, bent over in front of an oven.

870
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,241
And it's gonna say,
"You know why

871
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,482
"we like vaginas
better than your mouth?

872
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,767
"Because they don't have
teeth and they don't talk."

873
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,321
And you could turn that badge
over and you're gonna realize

874
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,846
that there's a man in the oven
and she's giving him a blowjob.

875
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,327
Good luck earning that!

876
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,601
Michelle!

877
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,569
I heard everything anyways.

878
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,968
These girls are gonna
earn some real money

879
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,883
that can go
towards a college fund,

880
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,887
give them empowerment, give
them a good sense of self.

881
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,883
I find that exciting, Claire.

882
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,283
It's a nice idea, Michelle,

883
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,250
but it's also a crazy one.

884
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,288
Claire, I want you
to listen to me.

885
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,841
You have an amazing product.

886
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,691
You make a mind-blowing brownie.
Okay.

887
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,930
And I can sell anything I believe
in, and I believe in your product.

888
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,682
We can be partners. Not my assistant.
Fifty-fifty.

889
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,651
That's how much I believe in this.
What do you say?

890
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,084
I have to keep
my job, Michelle.

891
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,964

It's just too risky.

like your job, Mom.

and start making pan after
pan after pan of brownies,

Right now! All right?

914

I may have tried to
preheat that oven,

915
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,242
so I think there's
a little bit of a gas leak.

about it, it may be

Another little tip.

Look for girls that are named

Opal, Amber.

934

They're all gonna
spiral down.

935

We want to get 'em when they're
angry and fresh going in.

936
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,607
Why don't you check out
Chrystal's availability?

937
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,961
Got it.

938
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,248
My mom never lets
me drink coffee.

939
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,322
Really, why?

940
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,325
She says it'll
stunt your growth.

941
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,129
That's not true.
That's crazy.

942
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,522
What, do you wanna
be freakishly tall?

943

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

944
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,366
All right. Get in there,
drum up some good recruits.

945
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,082
(GASPS) I feel kind of
sweaty and scared.

946
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,003
That's just the coffee kickin' in.
It's good for...

947
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,924
Oh, you know what? VVait a
minute, let me see something.

948
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,045
Oh, I may have
switched them.

949
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,600
This one's yours. I put a little
splash of bourbon in mine.

950
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,841
That's okay.

951
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,920
It's kind of
a secret weapon.

952
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,130
It's what makes
the Irish so mean.

953
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,810
And I can say that
'cause I'm Scottish!

954
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,761
Go get 'em!

955
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,881
SANDY: And so, due to some
unforeseen complications,

956
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,803
andjust, um...

957
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,446

away last night.

Listen up,
motherfuckers!

960
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,367
Michelle, language!

961
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,885
Who here wants
to hear about

962
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,042
an un-freaking-believably
exciting opportunity?

963
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,281
Huh?

964
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,609
All right! Woo!
Look at this group!

965
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,363
All right. What's with
all the long faces?

966
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,726
Did somebody die?
(CHUCKLING)

967
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,644
Yeah. Spaghetti
died last night.

968
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,960
Who is Spaghetti?

969
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,246
The cat.

970
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,322
The cat? Oh.
Can I be honest?

971
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,561
That cat probably
killed himself

972
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,841
because his name
was "Spaghetti."

973
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,927
Right? Hey-oh!

974
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,161
Michelle.
MICHELLE: Oh...

975
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,406
All right, okay. Why don't
you take off, Sandy?

976
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,686
It's my meeting
and I'm...

977
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,086
Okay-

978
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,650
Go catch it. Go catch it.

979
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,051
Really sorry
about your loss.

980
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,761
MICHELLE: As you already know,
my name is Michelle Darnell

981
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,841
and this is my partner.

982
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,123
And by "partner," I don't mean
like girl-on-girl kind of stuff.

983
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,481
Whoa!
What's "girl-on-girl stuff"?

984
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,367
Uh, well, great question.
I love an inquisitive mind.

985
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,522
Girl-on-girl stuff is
really just referring to

986
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,126
something you're probably
gonna dabble with in college,

987
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,247
but not stick
with, you know?

988
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,401
Let's not...
Don't tell her that.

989
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,561
Unless you're Hannah.

990
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,971
Hannah,youTe gonna stick with it.
(GIGGLING)

991
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,041
Don't... You know
what? Let's...

992
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,646
And I got a hunch that your
mom should've stuck with it.

993
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,370
She wouldn't be so
pent-up and angry.

994
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,681
MICHELLE: That's my hunch.

995
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,841
CLAIRE: Let's change
the subject.

996
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,811
We brought you guys some delicious
homemade brownie treats.

997
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,850
Ooh. Look at this! We brought
treats, everybody! Treats!

998
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,610
Let me ask you
one question.

999
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,081
When you sell a box of
cookies, what do you get?

1000
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,004
You get points that can
apply to your canoe trip.

1001
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,560
Wrong, you get
a big plate of bullshit!

1002
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,924
That is 100% right,
you beautiful giant!

1003
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,480
Now, at Darnell's Darlings,
we don't think that's right.

1004
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,001
We think if you go out
and sell a box of cookies,

1005
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,605
we should give
you 5% commission.

1006
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,928
5% commission,
every box you sell.

1007
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,604
It was supposed
to be 10%, I think.

1008
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,604
That's right, we did say that.
Yeah.

1009
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,967
So far, you suck at this.
Just letting you know that.

1010
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,724
Okay, it's 10%.

1011
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,371
You come work with us, you
get a share of the profits.

1012
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,166
Okay. Or you can stay here!

1013
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,810
Be my guest and,
I don't know, build some

1014
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,201
dirty badger nests
in some kind of tree.

1015
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,089
Or what did you
have planned, Sandy?

1016
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,007
Well, actually, we were gonna build
a dirty badger nest in a tree.

1017
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,650
My God.

1018
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,768
My God! And I was
making that up.

1019
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,845
I was trying to think of the worst
possible scenario on Earth.

1020
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,649
What the hell is
going on in here?

1021
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,241
I leave the room for one minute
to talk to my landscaper

1022
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,845
and the meeting
goes into the toilet?

1023
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,525
Sorry, Helen,
we're almost done.

1024
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,444
Okay, you guys, the best part
about Darnell's Darlings

1025
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,444
is that, for each
box sold, an extra 10%

1026
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,648
will go into a college fund for you.
Okay?

1027

We are gonna help you save
for your college education.

1028

Wait, are you trying to poach
girls from a Dandelions meeting?

1029
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,530
No!

1030
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,524
Helen, we are not
trying to poach girls.

1031
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,685
We are actively and definitely
poaching girls from this meeting.

1032
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,761
HELEN: Get your hands off me.

1033
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,325
Fuck you, Helen!
You fuck you!

1034
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,605
Tell your little
shitty daughter,

1035
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,001
never talk to
Rachel like that again.

1036
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,128
Let's um, go, girls.
MICHELLE: Okay, girls!

1037
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,045
Whoever wants to go to the
fun room, come on with me!

1038
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,806
Just down the hall. The bigger,
the better room. We got foosball!

1039
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,162
Okay. And I promise,
no Helen!

with your product!

Oh, man.

1042

I mean, what is
it, anyway?

1043
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,801
It looks like just a bunch of homemade,
gluten-filled, sugar-filled,

what are we doing?

1051
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,842
GROUP: Selling brownies!

1052
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,922
Okay, what do we say if
somebody doesn't want to buy?

1053
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,610
"Buy my brownies
or I'll kill you."

1054

Don't say
that, Chrystal.

1055

Say that.
That's perfect.

leaves at 7:00!

If you're not back,
we will leave without you!

No, we're not gonna leave.

are nice, we double the price.

trust affordable snacks.

HELEN:Hey!

What do you
think you're doing?

We're participating
in the American Dream.

Not on this street,
you're not.

1093

This is
Dandelion territory.

1094

It's okay,
Helen, we'll just...

1095
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,970
HELEN: Shut up, Sandy!
Okay.

1096

00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,729

behave like this!

Michelle.

1102
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,407
A word?

1103
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,641
MICHELLE: I'd be delighted.

1104
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,805
First rule of business, pretend to
negotiate and then take what you want.

00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,324
Listen, jailbird.

1106
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,324
You think because
you used to be someone

1107
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,811
that the rules
don't apply to you

1108
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,087
and your pathetic
band of rejects?

1109
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,321
Well, you're wrong, bitch.

1110
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,090
Ugh. Helen!

1111
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,525
You got a case of
the old trench-mouth.

1112
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,524
Did you let a corpse
curl up and die in there?

1113

RACHEL: Forget it, Michelle.

MICHELLE: No, no, no.

Second rule of business <i>is</i> when
a stanky, hummus-eating bitch

gets in your face,

1117

you gotta regulate.

Oh. Rejected Mike.

1174

The rejected Mike?
Don't...

1175
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,329
You know, he is kind of cute. I think
you should toss him a pity date.

MIKE: I don't need the pity,

but I will take the date
if that's out there.

Oh, wow. I have two
personal heroes in my life,

and I am staring at
one of them right now.

No. Oh, no. No touching.

1189
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,288
Curious to know
who the other one is.

1190
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,681
It's Benedict Cumberbatch,
and you.

1191
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,608
Huh. I did not peg you
for a "Cumbersnatch."

1192
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,604
That's me. Cumbersnatch.

1193
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,045
You seem like
a real Cumbersnatch.

1194
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,929
Well, thank you so,
so much.

1195
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,081
You're welcome. Oh...

1196
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,250
Thank you.
Great encounter.

1197
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,767
It's always fun. And I
think I'm done with you.

1198
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,641
Absolutely. And, madam,
it was an honor.

1199
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,802
Off you go!
And here I am, okay.

1201
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,606
Okay-

1202
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,166
Claire, if this company is going
to work, I need you full time.

1203
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,805
I can't have you here.

1204
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,209
Are you in or are you out?

1205
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,203
I can't just leave my job!

1206
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,328
I mean, I have to
have a steady income.

1207
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,765
I have Rachel
to think about.

1208
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,241
No,no,no.
This is for Rachel. Okay?

1209
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,926
If this works out the way I
know it's going to work out,

1210
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,604
it's gonna set
you two up for life.

1211
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,281
We're already
making enough money

1212
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,044
to pay your rent
and all your bills,

1213
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,761
and I'm just about to put a very big
fish on the hook as our investor.

1214
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,001
This is what I do.

1215
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,650
Okay? You know that.

1216
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,010
You have to trust me.

1217
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,044
I do hate this job.

1218
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,523
I mean, it's a terrible job.

1219
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,328
My God. I mean,
look at him.

1220
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,286
He's slumped over, asleep.
I hope he's asleep.

1221
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,044
You don't want
to be that guy.

1222
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,006
What do you say?

1223
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,801
Okay-

1224
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,723
Yes. I'm all in.

1225
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,404
Dana, I quit.

1226
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,602
I'm gonna start my
own business, okay?

1227
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,842
I have my own business.
Yes, she does.

1228
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,769
Guys, it was lovely here.

1229
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,360
Not really, but I hope you
all have a wonderful day.

1230
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,647
Mike, would you still
like to go on that date?

1231
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,841
Uh, yes, I would.

1232
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,321
I'm free tomorrow at 7:30.
Bring your A-game.

1233
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,646
Tracy? Wake up! I'm out!

1234
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,404
MICHELLE: Wake it up, Tracy!

1235
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,527
No.
No.

1236
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,806
No, thank you.
I'm so...

1237
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,128
Ooh. No.
I'm very flattered.

1238
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,969
Seems like a good night for
sexual activity, Claire.

1239

1240

How long has it been since
you've had sexualacfivfly?

1241
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,211
Stop yelling "sexualacfivHyF
'Cause Rachel might hear you.

00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,490
You know, you're
the one that's yelling

1243
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,250
"sexual activity"
out in the hallway.

1244
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,284
Just answer
the question, Claire.

1245
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,521
I don't know.

1246
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,364
If I had to guess,

1247
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,604
maybe four, five,
six years?

1248
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,891
What? Oh, my God.
Did you take a vow?

1249
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,201
It's very hard to
find a good sitter.

1250
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,802
Okay. We'll go
with that. I just...

1251
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,689
I'm gonna say, it
probably doesn't help

1252
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,491
that you're dressed like
you grocery-shop at a CVS.

1253
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,121
What?

1254
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,565
I love this sweater.

1255
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,245
I don't know
why you would.

1256
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,408
This sweater goes with everything.
It's a neutral.

1257
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,888
It doesn't go with you or
your skin, oryourface.

1258
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,805
That sweater is the equivalent
of a sandwich board

1259
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,644
that just says,
"I give up."

1260
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,326
And then in the back, itsays,
"I never started tryin'."

1261
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,724
It somewhat
looks like you have

1262
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,601
sewn together two very long, sad
tube socks and then filled each end

1263
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,970
with wet sand and rocks.

1264
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,451
What are you
talking about?

1265
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,170
It just looks like
two basset hounds

1266
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,930
may have cried
themselves to death

1267
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,445
in your sweater.

1268
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,921
I like it.
I think this looks great.

1269
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,681
Can I...
(GASPS)

1270
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,091
Michelle!
Well...

1271
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,286
You are...
I had to check.

1272
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,600
I didn't know
what was in there.

1273
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,808
You're making me feel very
insecure right before my date.

1274
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,961
Don't!

1275
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,327
If your breasts
could speak right now,

1276
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,607
I think they'd be
saying, "Claire,

1277
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,888
"please don't zip me
up in yourjeans."

1278
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,331
That is... You're
gonna zip a nipple.

1279
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,606
That's not what
they'd say.

1280
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,603
May I adjust your strap?

1281
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,688
'Cause I'm trying to help you, Claire.
(sncsns)

1282
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,649
You say, "Be more helpful."
And I'm trying to be helpful.

1283
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,841
You can tighten
the strap.

1284
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,644
Okay. What...

1285
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,370
Just a little,
'cause I want it...

1286
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,646
What is that toggle?

1287
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,931
Oh, it's a nursing bra.

1288
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,767
Oh, my God. Are you
still nursing Rachel?

1289
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,242
No, it's from when she was a baby.
But it's very comfortable.

1290
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,442
That's not
comfortable to see.

1291
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,925
Now, let me see this.

1292
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,480
It's very often a fit issue.
(EXHALES)

1293
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,360
Why do these
have so much pull?

1294
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,726
All right, well...
(GASPS)

1295
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,565
Claire! It's
like Geppetto!

1296
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,881
Look at that. Look at this.
It's like, "Horses, horses."

1297
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,041
It's like I'm...
Oh, my God.

1298
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,724
Okay, Okay, okay,
okay,okay!

1299
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,404
It feels good. I need
to be comfortable.

1300
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,403
It doesn't feel
good to my eyes.

1301
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,130
Can I just put 'em where
they're supposed to be?

1302
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,407
And I want you to be able
to see the difference.

1303
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,723
You got "Happy girl",
and then, uh-oh.

1304
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,166
They just drop out.

1305
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,961
And I should not be
able to separate...

1306
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,121
Okay. All right.
They're heavier, but...

1307
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,202
So how do you like it when I just
get in there and bang around?

1308
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,845
I love it.
Why is there not...

1309
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,201
Oh, there's no give.

1310
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,487
Look at that.
I can't even feel that.

1311
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,641
That's when
you know...

1312
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,561
I don't feel it, okay?
100% silicone.

1313
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,484
And not the kind that's supposed
to ever be inside the body.

1314
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,204
(SNORTING) I know.
They're fantastic.

1315
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,361
That's something else.

1316
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,487
Might feel that.

1317
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,721
That's my nipple.

1318
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,522
Yeah, they're up here, where
they should be. Oh, my God.

1319
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,090
No, see, you need
to bring 'em down.

1320
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,770
No! They can't,
anyway, no.

1321
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,888
That's what you need to do.
They're too high, Michelle.

1322
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,331
No. There's a structure. Stop.

1323
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,526
If we were...
You need to...

1324
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,449
Look, just take 'em a little bit lower.
Oh, my God.

1325
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,681
How about that?
I paid a fortune for these.

1326
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,966
No, I'm gonna bring 'em...
I'm keepin' 'em up!

1327
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,041
Just gonna push
'em right down.

help you not...

1329
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,770
What're you guys doing?

Gals do.

1335

No, we weren't.

1336
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,884
I was just trying to help your mom
here get ready for her big date.

a little bit nervous.

Okay. Thank you for that.

Okay, well, we're
gonna leave you to it.

Hi. Oh, my God.
You look gorgeous.

worn it in a while.

Absolutely.

I wanted to tell you earlier
actually, on a serious note.

1359
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,087
When you walked out the
other day from work,

1360
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,003
quite dramatically,
I might add,

1361
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,445
six other people quit.

just walked out.

Oh, my God.
I know, right?

You started
a huge chain reaction.

Six people walked out

1367
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,090
and then immediately three
people walked back inside.

I think they were
outside smoking.

But it was like you
were a cult leader.

1370
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,044
It was like a tremendous
show of support.

1371
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,646
It was, like,
very inspiring.

Yeah, really.

hard to believe?

That I'm tremendously inspiring?
Yeah.

you something, lady.

a little inspiring.

Can you, uh, grab
the mic for a sec?

1380
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,289
Well, I, um...

1381
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,011
I got knocked up in
grad school by my TA.

1382
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,286

out I was pregnant,

00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,089
he pretended like we
didn't know each other.

1384
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,969
What?
Then gave me a

Yeah, nice surprise.

on! on, my God!

1395

Rachel,
it's the goriest part!

1396
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,807
It's the goriest part.
You're missing it!

Oh, my God. He's killing
her with a chainsaw.

1398
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,406
Oh.

1399
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,922
I have a felon
watching my child.

1400
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,201
That just occurred
to you, didn't it?

1401
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,520
Yes, it did.
Yeah.

1402
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,489
It's good thing I'm here.
Let's have some more wine.

1403
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,081
Absolutely, yeah.
Hey, excuse me.

1404
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,204
Hi. Do you think maybe we could
get two more glasses of the...

1405

No. Hold on.

1406
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,288
Bring us a bottle of
whatever the lady would like

1407
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,125
in the twenty-five to
twenty-eight doflarrange.

1408
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,440
Sure, I'll send somebody to
VValgreens to get you something nice.

1409
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,961
Cool. You guys do that?
What's with that?

1410
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,326
(LAUGHING)
Oh, my God!

1411
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,202
Is that like a really
cheap bottle of wine?

1412
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,204
IDA: You got a lot of balls
showing up here, Darnell.

1413
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,123
Listen, Ida, I know you're still
mad at me, and I don't blame you.

1414
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,208
I shouldn't have cut you
out of that Emerson deal.

1415
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,169
But if it makes it
any better,

1416
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,481
I made a blinding amount
of money onthatdeaL

1417
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,446
You know the first time I saw you?
Twenty-three years old.

1418
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,522
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
I knew right away,

1419
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,803
you were a tough,
money-hungry,

1420
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,884
self-serving,
see-you-next-Tuesday gal

1421
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,325
just like me.

1422
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,610
And that's why I decided to mentor you.
Just let you get too close.

1423
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,721
I started to think
of you as family.

1424
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,761
Well, families are
for suckers, right?

1425
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,766
That's for sure.

1426
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,683
What do you
want, Michelle?

1427
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,364
I need an investor.

1428
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,729
Oh, for your little
brownie venture?

1429
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,329
How do you even
know about that?

1430
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,968
Because I'm Ida Marquette.
I know everything.

1431
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,601
Here.

1432
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,966
Come on, Ida.

1433
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,202
I'm sure you got quite an overhead
on this glue factory here.

1434

Do you want in or not?
You know,

1435
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,362
I once made love
on a pool table

1436
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,442
in Hot Coffee,
Mississippi

1437
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,444
with six members of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

1438
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,921
Are you stroking out?

1439
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,286
What does this
have to do with

1440
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,328
what we're talking
about right now?

1441
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,729
The point is, Darnell, I have
very few regrets in my life.

You were my best protégée.</i>

Tell you what.

01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,890
I'll back you, if this checks out.
Just for old times' sake.

Okay-

If you'll
excuse me, Shawshank,

1447
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,202
I'm late for
my morning ride.

1448

IDA: Yes!

1449
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,561
Okay-

a shitload of money.

Well, I feel it's time you
become more adventurous.

I know you
don't like sushi.

Thank you, Michelle!
I'm starving.

When prepared incorrectly,
itcanleadto paralysis or even death.

But when it is
prepared correctly,

1471
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,250
it is like a volcano
erupting in my mouth.

Michelle, are you all right?

1478
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,806
When it's this perfect, it takes
you to the brink of paralysis.

it just lets you go.

a little heavy-handed.

I think, you know,
I'm not much into labeling.

1504

You say "family",
and we don't look alike.

that you two look alike.

RENAULT:
Congratulations, Claire.

1548
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,968
Honey, why don't you,
um, go on inside,

1549
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,162

before you cross, okay?

1550
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,241
Okay-

What're you doing here?

1552
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,890
Looks like you and Michelle have built
yourself quite a little empire.

1553
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,641
What do you want?

1554
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,167
I want to take what
Michelle Darnell has built.

1555
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,846
I want her to realize
that I have taken it away.

1556
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,481
And when she realizes it, when that
moment of realization crosses her face,

1557
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,568
and she realizes thatlhave
realized it as well...

1558
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,607

train of thought.

What is this?

1585
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,847
It's a phoenix, Claire.
It's my totem animal.

1586
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,130
Okay. So you leased a commercial
kitchen without telling me?

1587
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,851
Yes. I'm kind of waiting for
a, "Thank you, Michelle!"

1588
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,161
VVow, um. I'm having a hard
time with the "thank you"

1589
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,926
because you also hired all of these
people without consulting me.

1590
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,243
I do know that you've been
complaining pretty consistently

1591
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,766
about having to do all the baking
and doing it at your house.

mad than ever.

I don't get it, Claire.
You didn't...

1595
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,086
Michelle, you didn't consult
me on any of this, okay?

1596
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,440
I see a bunch of press.

1597

One of us, not you,
got the press here.

1598
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,002
Right. Okay.

1599

Well, maybe they
should know that

the new and
improved Michelle Darnell

1601

is just as self-centered and egotistical
as the old Michelle Darnell.

close to people

to push them away.

01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,448
Family, this is
Michelle Darnell.

1701
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,851
She's making me
a bunch of money.

(ALL LAUGHING)

1703
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,561
Why don't you join us?

1704
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,130
No, no, actually, I was just hoping
to talk to you for a minute.

1705
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,607
Oh, of course.

1706
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,167
No hurry, Mother.

1707
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,367
Okay, I got it.

1708
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,646

lamb you heard screaming this morning.

(SIGHS)

1710
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,961
I sold the company
to Renault last night.

1711
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,488
Or Ronald or whatever
name he's going by now.

1712
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,166
Whoa, sweet baby Jesus.
Yeah.

1713
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,924
You know, we went
to get sushi once

1714
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,128
and he tried to speak
Japanese to the waitress.

1715
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,851
I swear, some of the words
were Spanish.

1716
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,725
But, you know,
he's gonna sell it off.

1717
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,608
Whew, I'm gonna
make a mint.

1718
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,170
Yeah, you probably will.

1719
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,008
And I did it just like
you taught me.

1720
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,210
I took nothing, made it
into something

1721
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,726
and didn't let anybody
weigh me down,

1722
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,802
and got out of there
when the money was right.

1723
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,167
Perfect, kill or be killed.

1724
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,891
Take that money and run.

1725
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,089
You know, I kinda...

1726
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,724
I think I kinda
lost my friend

1727
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,489
and hurt a bunch
of kids in the process.

1728

gonna make a shh mad.</i>

a million shit loads.

(LAUGHING IN DISTANCE)

1731
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,845
I dunno what I'm doing. I'm keeping
you from dinner with your family.

1732
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,843
Come on, that's not
my family.

1733
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,767
Those are actors. I hire actors every
once in a while to play my family.

1734
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,330
My family is bonkers.

1735
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,925
All I want is money.

Money, money, money.
Ida "Money" Marquette.

Grandpa Joe... Joe.

01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,801
Psst, Joe!

1739
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,286
You have a fake family.

1740
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,851
I've been taking advice
from you for 20 years.

1741
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,403
And you hire and spend
the night with a fake family.

1742
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,523
I try to get better
actors, but I just...

1743
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,490
Bennett is unresponsive. The
actor who plays Grandpa Joe.

1744

He's always
playing possum.

This man needs
medical attention, stat!

Is that a line
from one of your soaps?

01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,641
Yes.

paid for this.

Oh... I'm gonna sue
the pants off her.

1755

No, I'm not because she'll
throw too many lawyers at me

Yeah. This is a test.

with this bagel knife.

you, milady, I'll do it.

are kissing.

What, have
a sleepover here? Ew.

01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,122
No, he didn't. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Yuck!
No, that would be terrible.

01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,247
I don't know
about "yuck".

1768
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,401
I don't mean "yuck."
I meant...

CLAIRE: Don't know if it'll...
MIKE: I mean...

01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,169
It could be nice.
Might be nice.

1771
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,368
It's nice for people to spend the night.
We don't know yet.

We don't know yet.

01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,167
Would you please grab
some more garbage bags?

1774
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,730
We have a
lot of trash.

1775
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,926
Yeah.

1776
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,730
Why did I make
that so weird?

1777
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,961
It's fine.
Didn't have to.

Uh...

1782
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,404
This is all seeming
probably so much

1783
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,410
stranger than
what I had intended.

1784
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,324
I'm sorry to
startle you, Rachel.

1785
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,528
What are you
doing in my closet?

1786
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,126
Well, uh, to give
you the whole...

1787
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,931
I thought I have
a great idea

1788
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,083
to surprise you
with an apology,

1789
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,606
and my sincere
"I'm sorry."

1790
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,048
Sol let myself in,
in the middle of the night.

1791
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,481
So once I was actually
waiting here in the dark,

1792
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,166
and you were getting up for the
morning, I thought, "Uh-oh.

1793
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,846
"This could seem kind of
threatening and menacing."

1794
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,644
And I panicked
a little bit

1795
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,690
and just darted
into the closet.

1796
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:07,365
So, surprise! I'm sorry.

1797
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,922
And, dang it, I shouldn't
have sold that company.

1798
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,969
I think we're done.
Okay, well...

1799
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,487
You know... So thank you, I
guess, for breaking into my home.

1800
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,971
I said I was sorry.

1801
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,088
Great.
We heard you. Okay.

1802
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,003
I apologized.
I heard you.

1803
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,731
There's the door.

1804
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,571
You sold us out.

1805
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,686
Yeah, I did.

1806
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:37,290
I sold you out. And I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.

1807
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:42,002
And I'm hoping, somehow,
you can forgive me.

1808
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,730
And I just wanna
throw it out there

1809
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,162
that I have completely
forgiven you, Claire,

1810
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:51,006
for trying to sell me out
first with Renault so...

1811
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,728
What are you
talking about?

1812
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,847
I saw you.

1813
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:59,166
Okay? I saw you and Ronald
outside the bakery.

1814
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,605
He was smelling
your hand

1815
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,041
and I know what that means, okay?
(SCOFFS)

1816
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,209
I mean, he has smelled
many of my parts,

1817
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:10,562
and I have smelled
many of his parts.

1818
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,764
I was telling Renault
that I'm not willing

1819
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,730
to sell him a single,
solitary brownie,

1820
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,768
let alone my
entire company.

(STAMMERING)

1822
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,888
That's a mix-up, huh?

1823
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,768
Michelle, I would never in a million
years do that to you, okay?

1824
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,923
You know... I mean, God.
What goes on in your brain?

1825
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,126
I don't know.

1826
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,842
I mean,
I don't have a lot of,

1827
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,843
you know, experience
or a reference point for...

1828
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,049
I didn't have a family,
or a mom, or a dad.

1829
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,364
And I totally get it
if you never talk to me again.

1830
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,491
So I don't want you
to feel bad about that.

1831
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,643
I just wanted you to know that I
think you're very nice people.

1832
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,322
Great people, actually.

1833
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,405
You're the closest thing
to a family I've ever had.

1834
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:07,281
And I'm real sorry
I screwed that up.

1835
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,604
I'm gonna miss you, Michelle.

1836
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:14,881
MIKE: Should I go?

1837
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,401
I think I should go.

1838
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,766
Oh, my God. It's an
awkward time for me

1839
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,524
to just be, like, creeping
around in the background.

1840
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,489
I had no idea you
were still here.

1841
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,204
Should I go, or should I...
No, you're fine.

1842
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,725
I do not like
what you did.

1843
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:31,286
I do not like it!
And I do not like it.

1844
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,042
She really
doesn't like it, guys.

1845
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:36,921
You know, I...

1846
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:42,202
If anyone's curious, I do
think I know how to fix this.

1847
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,964
I signed that contract with
Renault late Friday night.

1848
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,044
I wanna remind you I was
wounded, I was a little tipsy.

1849
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,690
CLAIRE: Oh, God.
Okay.

1850
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,403
And it's Sunday. No one
will be in his offices.

1851
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,881
Plus, he can't file for a
corporate change of ownership

1852
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,849
until tomorrow morning.

1853
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,286
I can get in there tonight,

1854
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,489
I can get that contract, and
I can take our company back.

1855
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,165
Wait, what do you
mean "get the contract"?

1856
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,607
He must have scanned and emailed
it a hundred times by now.

1857
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,331
No, no, no. Anybody else,
yes, but not him.

1858
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,609
Ronald is completely paranoid
about being hacked. Okay?

1859
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:18,208
He has no cell phones, no emails.
He leaves no digital trail.

1860
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,567
Claire knows this. He's all
old-school pen and paper.

1861
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,051
It's the samurai way.

1862
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,330
Okay, I'm in. Let's do this.
I'm in.

1863
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,640
CLAIRE: Why would you be in?

1864
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,165
MIKE: What do you mean
why would I be in?

1865
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,241
You've been talking
all morning about

1866
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,084
how you wanted to
get your company back.

1867
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,925
And you guys are gonna need
help, and I'm a helpful guy.

1868
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,331
How's that for a reason?

1869
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,211
You're gonna get
rewarded for that.

1870
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,408
MIKE; Well, that's
not Why I did it.

1871
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,928
I'm in, too.
MICHELLE: No, Claire.

1872
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,082
This is my fault
and I'm gonna fix it.

1873
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,003
Michelle, this is
my decision.

1874
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,525
And I want our
company back.

1875
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,090
Yes, Claire.

1876
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,049
All right, let's
fuck this shit up.

1877
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,282
Language.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1878
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,565
I need to get a sitter.

1879
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,480
Yeah, you do.

1880
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,006
MICHELLE: As soon as we get out I
want you to grab the gasoline,

1881
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,485
some rags,
and torch the van.

1882
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:04,641
MIKE: What are you
talking about?

1883
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,165
I rented the van.
It's on my credit card.

1884
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,480
You go down,
you go down alone.

1885
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,210
How would we
even get home?

1886
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,089
That's a good point.
MVP, Claire.

1887
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,607
Uh-oh. There's no door handle back here.
There's absolutely... Oh.

1888
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,650
Thank you, Claire.
(CLEARS THROAT)

1889
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,362
Okay. I still don't
think you should be here.

1890
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,441
But if we get caught,

1891
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,847
I want you to tell the police
that I forced you here by gun.

1892
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,046
You gotta watch
out for Rachel.

1893
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,009
Okay. You don't have
a gun, though, right?

1894
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,923
What am I, a thug?
Okay.

1895
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,606
MIKE: I'm such a badass!
This is gonna be amazing!

1896
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,967
Also, by the way, guys,
I was googling jail sentences.

1897
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,281
Since none of us are actually
armed, minimal jail time.

1898
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,888
Oops. Just excuse me
for one minute.

1899

(GASPS) Michelle! Well,
it's a collector's item.

1900
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,961
Ditch it.

1901
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,850
Chuckin' a gun in a garbage can.
That's smart.

1902
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:47,887
What?
Oh, my God.

1903
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,207
Okay! I know it was wrong.
I self-corrected.

1904

No, you didn't. ljustasked
you to throw...

Well, you made me
throw it away. Okay.

Okay, there it is.

Fine. Fine,

Hey! How you doing?

No, this is 9900.

I whistle.

01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,969
And then, mama
can get to work.

2002
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,571
Sometimes, before the dance,
I have to limber up.

2003
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,369
I do some
sexy stretches. Like...

2004
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,930
All right? How's that?
Jelly. Back to square one.

2005
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,490
We're good?
Yup! Yup, yup.

2006
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,085
I don't wanna overdo it. Phew.

2007
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,570
Okay. Well, hey.

2008
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,284
Kenny, you're one of the
good ones, man. Yeah.

2009
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,930
Yeah, not a lot of guys
would do that for another guy.

2010
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,724
I'll do it for you.
Thanks, man.

2011
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,604
But we'll hang. We'll do it.
Yeah, we'll totally hang.

2012
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,170
No big deal, buddy.
All right, have a good one.

2013
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,480
Bye, Jimberly.

2014
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,609
You buzz me up,

2015
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,648
and I'll give you a free dance
on the way down.

2016
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:08,841
How about that?

2017
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,566
I'll let you up.

2018
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,681
I like Gordon Lightfoot.

2019
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,080
Who doesn't?

2020
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:21,528
<i>The legend lives on
from the Chippewa on down</i>

<i>To the big lake they
call Gitche Gumee</i>

2022
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:30,964
The lake... Said and...
(MUMBLING)

2023
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,407
Oh, my God.
Pete! Pete! Pete! Pete!

2024
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,205
Did you just...

2025
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,327
Yes.

2026
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,481
Did you?

2027
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,401
No.

2028
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,085
God damn it, Pete.

2029
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,925
I gotta sit down.
Yeah.

2030
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,081
Okay.
I gotta sit down.

2031
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,648
I'm embarrassed.
Just“

2032
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,201
He seems nice.

2033
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,247
Jesus.

2034
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:01,883
Jimberly. "J", "J".

2035
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,721
Maybe it's "J-Y-M."

2036
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,768
What the fuck?
There's no Jimberlys.

2037
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,447
(SNORING)

2038
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,884
Well, then where
is his office?

2039
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,129
I don't know. The last time
I was here, I was tipsy.

2040
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,770
(ELEVATOR DINGING)

2041
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,971
Oh, my God. You guys, we're
total burglars. Look at us!

2042
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,485
How did you get
past the guards?

2043
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,881
That was a piece of cake. He
was, like, totally passed out.

2044
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,325
I don't know what was
going on there.

2045
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,447
Me neither.

2046
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,324
(LAUGHING)

2047
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,962
I feel like this is
going great.

2048
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:49,522
Michelle, you brought trash
bags, baby wipes, shower gel.

2049
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,921
Do you actually think
we're gonna need rope?

2050
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,247
Come on! Every story about a
burglar always involves rope.

2051
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,606
That's true.
It's in all the movies.

2052
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,887
I am a mogul,
not a cat burglar.

2053
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,088
I'm also the only one that
thought to bring provisions.

2054
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,524
MIKE: Michelle, stop!
I forgot, I'm sorry.

2055
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,520
I stole the guard's keycard.
What?

2056
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,761
You stole his key?

2057
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,041
Yeah. Okay.

2058
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,970
MIKE: <i>Somebody loves
Mortal Kombat.</i>

2059
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,530
CLAIRE: Let's just find the
contract and get outta here.

2060
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,091
Okay. I bet you he put
it in his panic room.

2061
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,685
That's what I'd do
if I had a panic room.

2062
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,728
It's probably voice-activated,
high-tech stuff in here.

2063
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,847
Open desk.

2064
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,570
Yeah. Open desk!
CLAIRE: Open...

2065
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,130
No, it was just manual.

2066
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,922
I got it! In his
desk drawer,

2067
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,843
in a file marked "Darnell."

2068
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,161
Probably overthought thatone.
It's classic Mike.

2069
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:36,282
MIKE: I do that a lot.
Let's go!

2070
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,488
RENAULT: Son of a bitch, Stephan!
You left the door open!

2071
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,121
Oh.

2072
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,040
Well, who do
we have here?

2073
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,800
Michelle Darnell, the
baker and Quetzalcéatl.

2074
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,082
That is impressive. I mean,
you gotta give him that.

2075
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,810
I'm not even
wearing the mask.

2076
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,444
That wouldn't be our contract
you're holding, would it, Michelle?

2077
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,526
You wouldn't be foolish enough to
back out of our plan, would you?

2078
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,291
You know what? It was never
her company to sell.

2079
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,330
I own 50% of it, so...
RENAULT: Yeah.

2080
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,091
I may have fudged the initial paperwork.
Yo u wh at?

2081
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,571
But I am sorry.
So, I'm not...

2082
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,607
And I will rectify...
Michelle!

2083
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,569
You will be. You will be.
I'm sorry.

2084
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:15,042
I wonder, how should
I approach this?

2085
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,890
Call the proper authorities
and turn you in?

2086
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,327
Or we could just talk it
out amongst ourselves.

2087
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,208
Do you know what the
fascinating thing is

2088
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,368
about the Japanese
martial arts?

2089
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,925
The discipline.

2090
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,411
(INHALES DEEPLY) Ya!

2091
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,805
The integrity.

2092
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,850
The loyalty.

2093
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,445
Okay, Okay, stop!

2094
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:46,766
I'll do it.

2095
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,490
I'll suck your dick.
What?

2096
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,846
MIKE: I don't wanna do it,

2097
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,241
but if you promise not to
hurt anybody in this room,

2098
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,566
I'll suck your dick.

2099
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,687
Mike, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2100
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,771
Oh, my God. Mike, no. What?

2101
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,490
No. You don't want
me to suck his dick?

2102
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,642
Wrong dick,
wrong time, Mike.

2103
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,721
Wrong dick.
Wrong dick.

2104
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,211
It was supposed to be
the security guy's dick.

2105
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,611
I was trying to
be a team player.

2106
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:07,842
Real eager, Claire.
It's a red flag.

2107
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,046
Idon%Hke
sucking dicks.

2108
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,281
It's not my business.

2109
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,691
RENAULT: Nobody's
sucking my dick.

2110
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,921
CLAIRE: Fair enough.

2111
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,810
Well, that's the first time
I've heard you say that, but...

2112
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:16,881
I'm going to plan B,

2113
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,530
my tongue has
always been my sword.

2114
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,601
MIKE: Okay.

2115
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,202
Put the knife
away, Ronald.

2116
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:26,165
It's not a knife.
It's a katana.

2117
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,366
Katana.

2118
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,888
You're not gonna cut anyone with
that knife and we all know it.

2119
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,487
(GASPS)

2120
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,686

2121
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,161
Big bird, blondie,
over there! Go! Scoot!

2122
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,685
MIKE: Okay. All right, easy!

2123
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,121
(GROANS)

2124
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,287
Oh, shit.

2125
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,802
Are you crazy, Ron?
I'm bleeding!

2126
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,491
Give me back what's mine.

2127
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,800
(BOTH GRUNTING)

2128
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,120
Michelle!

2129
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,085
Oh, hello, old friend! Get off!

2130
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,161
Oh, God,
I've missed this.

2131
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,641
God, you keep
that shit tight. No!

2132
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,121

CLAIRE: Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

2134
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,321
Michelle, get up!
Get up!

2135

(GROANING)

2136
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:04,921
MIKE: Just get up.

2137
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,010
MICHELLE: Okay,
let's be reasonable.

2138
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,321
You know, I'm sure we can come
to some kind of an agreement.

2139
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,886
Oh, we're past that point.

2140
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,167
For the first time in my life, I'm
trying to do the right thing!

2141
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,004
This is not about
me and you!

2142
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:16,730
You don't even
want our company!

2143
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,361
That's true, but you screwed me
over 25 years ago, you bitch.

2144
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,923
I thought sending you
to prison would help,

2145
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,049
but cutting you to ribbons is the
only way I'll get satisfaction!

2146
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:27,761
(GRUNTS)

2147
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,281
Had enough?
(GRUNTING)

2148
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,281
Shit.

2149
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,642
Oh, check this out.
MICHELLE: Fucking psycho!

2150
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:36,921
(GRUNTING)

2151
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,441
Back up.

2152
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,371
(YELLING)

2153
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,601
Look at that!

2154
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,849
Just a figure eight.

2310
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:33,690
Okay.
I can get in there.

2311
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,570
I can get the contract and I
can take back our country.

2312
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:37,801
DIRECTOR: What do
you mean "take..."

2313
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,081
God damn it. (GIGGLING)
(CREVV LAUGHING)

2314
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,131
I object to parolees
attending our meetings

2315
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,328
and I'd like to put that in
the official transcreept...

2316
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,686
(CHUCKUNG)

2317
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,842
I made a
good business...

2318
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,290
You know what? You made
a good business...

2319
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:57,490
Really? You fucking kidding me?
I can't say "decision."

2320
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,005
CLAIRE: Language, Michelle.
Yeah.

2321
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,606
Good night!

2322
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,051
(CREW LAUGHING)

2323
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:03,884
You think they'll
ever yell "cut"?

2324
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:05,691
(LAUGHING)

2325
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:06,921
No.
