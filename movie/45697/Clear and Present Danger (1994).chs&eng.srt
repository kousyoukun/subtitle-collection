132
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,316
"当心背后"
"Watch your back, Jack."

133
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:38,660
波比 你该是第一个知道 或者是第三 四个
Bobby, you should be the first to know, or the third or fourth.

134
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:42,331
赖将会做署理情报局副局长
Ryan is to be Acting Deputy Director, Intelligence.

135
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:47,836
那当然是暂时性的委任 直至哲时康复
It will be a provisional appointment, of course, until James recovers.

136
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,631
你向他简报一下 我们对哥伦比亚的援助计划
Get him up to speed on our aid programme to Colombia.

137
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:56,595
他要说服监督委员会 再拨款七千五百万元
He must talk the Oversight Committee out of another $75 million.

138
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,349
还千万别自暴其短
And not make a complete fool out of himself.

139
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,394
夏彼得被杀的案件又怎样?
What about the Hardin murders?

140
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:08,315
我在跟进 总统要全力调查
I'm on it. The President's calling for a full-court press.

141
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:13,528
你们要携手合作了
So, you guys are going to be working together hand in hand.

142
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:16,907
很好
That's great.

143
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:36,093
马嘉丽 别动他的东西好了
Margaret, why don't we leave all his things?

144
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:37,844
好吧 好的
OK, yeah.

145
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,360
赖杰克 我不能相信!
Ryan. I can't believe it!

146
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:57,197
你指他是个不合作的人?
He's not a team player, is thatwhat you're saying?

147
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,408
他是个白痴
He's a Boy Scout.

148
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:05,831
一个该死的白痴 相信忠心 廉洁和婚姻
A goddamn Boy Scout. Believes in loyalty, cleanliness and knot-tying.

149
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,083
别管他好了
So leave him out of it.

150
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,295
他当情报局副局长 那会很棘手
He's the Deputy Director of Intelligence. That will be tricky.

151
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:14,923
他要知道什么?
What does he need to know?

152
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:21,513
他什么也不必知道 也不会知道什么
Nothing. He needs to know nothing. He's going to know nothing.

153
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,516
我要一份总统授权
I want a copy of the President's authorisation

154
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,602
对毒窟采取新行动的副本
of this new action against the cartels.

155
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:32,149
- 你要什么?  - 你听到
- You want what?  - You heard me.

156
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,277
他不知情的
He doesn't know about it.

157
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:43,410
我给你简单地解释 这只是你的行动
Let me explain it to you very simply. This is your deal, not mine.

158
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:48,665
除非我有书面授权 否则这件事不会进行
Unless I have written authorisation, this thing is over before it begins.

159
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:53,920
我不想在出问题时 由我来负全责
I'm not going to be the only one left without a chair when the music stops.

160
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:38,006
"互惠" 一个聪明的代号
"Reciprocity." That's a clever name for it.

161
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:42,636
报复是个十分危险的动机
Revenge is a very, very, very dangerous motivation.

162
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:50,394
这个行动你可否应付得来? 我只要知是或否
Are you able to handle this operation or not? I'm looking for a yes or no.

163
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,480
你要卷入一个政治的烂摊子
You're looking for a political mess.

164
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,483
- 是或否?  - 他们要那样?
- Yes or no?  - Is that what they want?

165
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,196
每个首任政府都想获得连任
They want what every first-term administration wants. A second term.

166
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:05,909
我相信国会还没有批准这事
I don't imagine the boys on the Hill have approved this.

167
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,667
他们有没有?
Have they?

168
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,380
那是否说"不"?
Is that a "no"?

169
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:25,345
该死
Shit.

170
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:31,393
我在行动之前 户口里要收到钱
I want the money in my account before I move an inch.

171
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,103
没问题
You got it.

172
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,522
- 我要有通信卫星联系  - 好的
- I need a Comsat link.  - You got it.

173
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:39,026
- 一支小队  - 你可以有一支部队
- An insertion team.  - You can have a brigade.

174
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:42,487
只要12个熟识自决式作战的人
Just 12 men who understand discretionary warfare.

175
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,824
特别行动 西班牙语
Special Ops. Spanish speaking.

176
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:56,209
- 先生 你好吗?  - 很好
- How are you today, sir?  - Very well.

177
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:59,463
- 请问你到访的目的?  - 公干

- What business are you in?  - I sell tractors.

179
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:05,927
我制造和出售它们
Well, I build them, then I sell them.

180
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:10,098
- 你会逗留多久?  - 几天
- And how long will you be staying?  - A few days.

181
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,713
我知道很冒险 但还有什么方法?
I know it's a risk, but what's the alternative?

182
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,176
用六千拉德的钴切除视网膜? 不会乐观
Zapping a retina with 6,000 rads of cobalt? Not a pretty picture.

183
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:49,638
比扩散了的脑瘤好一些
Prettier than a tumour spreading in the cranial sack.

184
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:53,016
- 她叫什么名字?  - 我正吃饭呢
- What is her name?  - I'm trying to have lunch.

185
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:57,688
听着... 肚饿吗?
Listen... Hungry?

186
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:01,733
- 很饿  - 我们别吃午餐
- Starved.  - We could forget about lunch.

187
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,364
- 我们上次也试过 记得吗?  - 我可记得? 你呢?
- We did that last time, remember?  - Do I remember? Do you?

188
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:12,494
- 不大记得  - 也许我该提你一下
- Vaguely.  - Maybe I should refresh your memory.

189
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:17,874
- 也许是的  - 你们有台了
- Maybe you should.  - Your table is ready now.

190
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,086
- 我们不要了 我去叫计程车  - 梅丽?
- We don't need it. I'll get a cab.  - Moira?

00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:26,758
- 你好吗? 杰克怎样?  - 他很好

00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:39,896
- 他的样子像杰克吗?  - 是吗? 我看得不清楚
- Doesn't he look like Jack?  - Does he? I can't quite see.

196
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,818
- 只差是拉丁籍  - 拉丁杰克? 这个我得看一下
- Only Latin.  - A Latin Jack? This I have to see.

197
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,196
我要走了 再见
I have to go. Bye.

198
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,703
我们知道这不是海上劫掠 海盗会偷船的
Well, we know it's not piracy. Pirates steal boats.

199
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,666
他们身上有案发后翌早去波哥大的机票
They had plane tickets to Bogota the morning afterthe killings.

200
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,501
- 达恩  - 情况怎样?
- Hey, Dan.  - How's it going?

201
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:05,130
我们正追查着一个动机 莫达恩 联邦调查局
We're sneaking up on a motive. Dan Murray, Bureau.

202
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,175
- 外交部 韦乐帆  - 说过什么?
- Ralph Williams, DEA.  - Said anything yet?

203
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:12,721
- "我们是清白的 "  - 等检察官给他们提出交易吧
- Yeah. "We're innocent."  - Till the DA offers them a deal.

204
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:16,308
已经提出了 普通的还是特脆的?
He already has. Regular or extra crispy?

205
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,062
可以是指炸鸡或者那张电椅
Either referring to fried chicken or the electric chair.

206
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,773
你可觉得另有内情?
Are you picturing a hit?

207
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:27,069
发生在一个受敬重的美籍商人一样?
On a respectable American businessman and his family?

208
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,073
你假设他是受人敬重罢了
You're assuming he's respectable.

209
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:45,212
我们有便条 信件 信用卡结余单
We have memos, letters, credit card statements,

210
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:50,801

216
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:13,156
- 接近了  - 倒转次序?
- Close.  - In reverse?

217
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,911
他的生日是...
Alright, his birthday is...

218
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:24,292
那太容易了 是吗? 试一下倒转次序
That would be too easy, wouldn't it? Let's try it in reverse.

219
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:27,212
错 他太太的?
No. His wife's?

220
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,048
错 他儿子的?
No. His son's?

221
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,551
- 这可以做...  - 几个月
- This could take...  - Months.

222
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,678
儿子的生日倒转 这是给你的
Son's in reverse. This is for you.

223
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:40,100
错 太太的生日倒转
No. Wife's in reverse.

224
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:42,477
错 女儿的生日倒转
No. Daughter's in reverse.

225
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,689
你得更改你的提款机密码
You've got to change your ATM code.

226
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,861
不是 不是妻子的生日 不是女儿的生日 什么都不是
No. Wife, daughter. Nothing.

227
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:54,698
好了
Got it.

228
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:56,908
进去了!
I got it!

229
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:11,298
太太的出生月份 女儿的日子 儿子的年份
Wife's birth month, daughter's day, son's year.

230
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:14,217
但不是倒转次序 抱歉
But not in reverse. Sorry.

231
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,686
印一份给我
Print me out that one.

232
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:26,772
好孩子
Good boy.

233
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:31,943
三年前夏彼得收到一大笔外币
Three years ago, Hardin received an infusion of foreign capital

234
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:37,032
他用来投资在美国二十个大型购物中心
which he invested in 20 major shopping centres in the US.

235
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:41,828
在经济衰退期间 他获得破纪录的盈利
In the middle of the recession, he posted record profits,

236
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:46,500
至少对他畏惧的税局来说是这样
at least to the IRS, who he feared more than his own partners.

237
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:50,962
根据他给他们的股东声明
To them, according to the stockholder statements he was giving them,

238
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,299
那些购物中心的生意并不理想
the shopping centres weren't doing nearly as well.

239
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:58,804
但他撇去大部分盈利六亿五千万元
But he wasjust skimming most of the profits, $650 million,

240
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,474
还把它存进卢森堡 巴拿马
and putting it in accounts in Luxembourg, Panama

241
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,726
和开曼群岛的户口
and the Cayman Islands.

242
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,230
他们为此而杀他
They killed him for it.

243
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:10,315
谁?
Who?

244
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,694
- 他的拍档  - 谁是他的拍档?
- His partners.  - Who were his partners?

245
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:20,242
很明显他替哥伦比亚的毒窟洗钱
It seems clear that he was laundering money for the Colombian drug cartels.

246
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:26,248
天啊! 我认识了那个人四十年 我们是同学
Jesus! I knew the man for 40 years. We went to school together.

247
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,668
还几乎合作做生意
We almost went into business together.

248
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,462
那该会不错
That would have been good.

249
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:37,050
传媒会对这事件穷追猛打
The press is going to have a field day with this.

250
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:41,847
- 这房间以外没有人知道  - 他们总有方法
- No one outside this room knows.  - They will. They always do.

251
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:45,892
会揭露的 你说得不错 到时我们
It will come up, you're right about that. When it does,

252
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:51,565
会对你和夏的关系作轻描淡写
we'll downplay your relationship with Hardin somehow.

253
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,902
- 什么?  - 什么?
- What?  - What?

254
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:59,781
- 我们把它缓和  - 你不同意?
- We'll defuse it.  - Do you disagree?

255
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:01,450
不
No.

256
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:06,413
其实是同意 我会用另一种方法
Well, actually, yes. I would go in the other direction.

257
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,960
如果记者问你和夏是否朋友 我会说"好朋友"
If a reporter asked if you and Hardin were friends, I'd say "good friends".

258
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:16,840
如果他们问你们是否好朋友 我会说"终身好友"
If they asked if you were good friends, I'd say"lifelong friends".

259
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:22,721
令他们无从入手 没有新闻可报导
Give them no place to go, nothing to report. No story.

260
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:29,728
我意思是 既然炸弹已经引爆了...
I mean, it's no sense in defusing a bomb after it's already...

261
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,565
...又何须再拆除信管
...it's already gone off.

262
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,632
- 靠!  - 该死!
- Damn!  - Shit!

263
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,052
看到他吗?
Do you see him?

264
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:07,099
叫你的队员向左移两米
Alright. Move your team two metres to the left.

265
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,271
好了 停
That's it. Stop.

266
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:18,026
走到那片浅色草堆 狙击手在你的位置
Touch that light-coloured grass. Sniper at your feet.

267
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:20,737
军士长 这里没什么
Nothing here, Sergeant Major.

268
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:24,199
- 该死!  - 他很出色
- Damn!  - He is good.

269
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,094
很接近 他怎移动得这么快?
Thatwas close. How's he moving so fast?

270
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,979
我看见他 过来 一直过来 现在跑!
I see him. Come in. Straight in. Now. Run!

271
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,316
一直过来
Keep coming.

272
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:03,613
停 你的左面 你的左面
Stop. To your left. To your left.

273
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:08,493
停止 狙击手在你的位置
And stop. Sniper at your feet.

274
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,581
是什么?
What is it?

275
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,085
他在这里吃过午餐
He had lunch here.

276
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:19,921
麦当劳芝士汉堡包
McDonald's quarter-pounder.

277
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:22,007
加上奶酪
With cheese.

278
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:25,093
该死
Damn.

279
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:33,769
- 该死!  - 四个了
- Damn!  - That's four.

280
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:38,899
这次你蠃了 出来吧!
Alright, you won this one. Come on out!

281
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,862
士兵 你怎走得这么接近我?
Soldier, how did you get that close to me?

282
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:49,409
长官 狙击手做个鬼祟的混蛋 来接近导师!
Sniper approached instructor by being a sneaky bastard, Sergeant Major!

283
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:53,664
蔡维斯 可知道在加州 丢垃圾的罚款?
Do you know the fine for littering in California, Chavez?

284
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,291
知道 长官!
Yes, sir!

285
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,422
我在狙击手训练中见过你 你很出色
I saw you on the sniper course. You looked good.

286
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:06,259
- 中士 这里受训快完毕吗?  - 是 长官
- Just about finished here, Sergeant?  - Yes, sir.

287
00:28:06,426 --> 00:28:10,389
可渴望带妻儿去度假?
Looking forward to taking some leave with your wife and kids?

288
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:15,185
- 长官 我没有妻儿  - 你有什么?
- Don't have any wife or kids, sir.  - What do you have?

289
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:22,651
你很少打电话给别人 也没有多少来往的信件
You don't call anybody often, you don't write or receive many letters.

290
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,990
长官 我可否问你是谁?
Who are you, sir, if I may ask?

291
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:32,744
祁洛先生和我正策划一项行动 我的组是其中一部分
Mr Clark and I are putting together a mission. My team is a part of it.

292
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:37,666
你最多会去六个月 如果之后还活着
You'd be gone up to six months, after which, if you're not dead,

293
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:41,336
你有权选择特种部队内的任务
you'd have your choice of assignments in Special Ops.

294
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,483
...消除一个快将成为另一件丑闻的问题
...defusing an issue that was snowballing into another scandal.

295
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,904
时代日报 报导你和夏是好朋友
"The New York Times" reports that you and Hardin were good friends.

296
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:12,200
不是好朋友 我们是终身好友
No, not good friends. We were lifelong friends.

297
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:16,246
是我说的 是我说的
I said that. I said that.

298
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:20,459
我叫他那样说
I told him to say that.

299
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,338
- 什么?  - 我没有说什么
- What?  - I didn't say anything.

300
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:28,258
- 但你在想着一件事  - 没有
- But you were thinking something.  - No.

301
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:33,388
我只是想着 你跟你的同僚的麻烦
I was just distracted by the trouble you were having with your ensemble.

302
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:39,144
你不是每天都要装作可靠的
Well, it's not every day you have to look trustworthy.

303
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:43,106
- 谁叫谁说什么?  - 那不重要
- Who told who to say what?  - It's not important.

304
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,860
- 是总统吗?  - 是的
- The President?  - Yeah.

305
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:51,490
妈说她比总统赚更多钱
Mom says she makes more money than the President.

306
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,993
她可能是对的 再见
She's probably right. Bye.

307
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:07,547
赖博士 感谢你的资料
Thank you, Dr Ryan, for the information you've shared with us.

308
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,968
- 谢谢 参议员  - 我们一定要帮助哥伦比亚人
- Thank you, Senator.  - We have to help the Colombians

309
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:16,598
去制止那些毒窟的活动
in their struggle to curtail the drug cartels' activities.

310
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:22,270
但我不明白 你怎么认为额外的拨款
However, I'm confused. How do you see additional funds

311
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:25,983
有助这项没有功效的计划?
advancing this programme from the failure that it is?

312
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:30,487
- 你明白我的意思吗?  - 我不大明白
- You see what I'm getting at?  - No, I'm afraid I don't.

313
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:34,157
你说这项计划对我们完全有利
You said this effort would be totally benign on our part.

314
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:38,870
我们的协助只限于供应和建议
Our assistance is limited to supply and advice only.

315
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,789
我已经读过
I've read that.

316
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:45,127
我也读过一份三十五年前写的类似报告
I've also read a similar finding written 35 years ago

317
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:49,798
有关在东南亚 一处鲜为人知的丛林
regarding a little-thought-of sliver ofjungle in Southeast Asia.

318
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:56,096
对不起 你把反毒拨款申请跟越南作比较?
You're comparing our request for anti-drug funds to Vietnam?

319
00:30:56,263 --> 00:31:00,434
我们这个委员会每次被要求时
I'm comparing it to every time a committee such as this is asked

320
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,147
都会对资料不足的申请作出判断
to render judgement based on less than all the facts.

321
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:11,069
恐怕我不知道怎样回应
I'm afraid I don't know what to say to that.

322
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,448
你可以向我们保证 我们已取得所有事实
You can assure us that we have all the facts.

323
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:16,158
我认为我有
I thought I had.

324
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:21,913
那么你可以再向我们保证 这笔额外的拨款
You can further assure us then that this increase in funds

325
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,584
不会被用作秘密的军事行动
will not be used for any covert military action.

326
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,962
我不明白你怎会这样想
I don't know how you're getting to this.

327
00:31:29,212 --> 00:31:32,549
长期的经验
Long experience, sir.

328
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,843
没有军队?
No troops then?

329
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:40,766
我强调那点 因为我不想出错
I enunciate that clearly because I don't want there to be any mistake.

330
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,642
没有军队
No troops.

331
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:46,563
你可否说 我以你的话作承诺?
You could say I have your word on that?

332
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,941
你可以那样
You could indeed, because you do.

333
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:11,421
听着! 除下名牌 把它们传上来
Listen up! Dog tags. Take 'em off, pass 'em forward.

334
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:17,344
检查口袋里 可以认出身分的东西
Check your pockets for anything that can be used for identification.

335
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:26,645
到陆地了
We're feet dry.

336
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,662
降落区在望 准备
LZ in sight. Get ready.

337
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,915
祝大家好运 去抓他们吧
Good luck, boys. Go get 'em.

338
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:53,005
好了 现在降落
OK, let's take her down now.

339
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,690
快 快 快!
Go, go, go!

340
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:41,530
嘿 波比
Hey, Bob.

341
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,159
- 你好吗?  - 很好
- How you doing?  - Good, sir.

342
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,287
见到你真好
Good to see you.

343
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,714
- 杰克 早  - 赖! 进来吧
- Morning, Jack.  - Ryan! Come on in.

344
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,758
- 认识大家吗?  - 都认识
- Do you know everyone?  - Yes, yes.

345
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:06,096
- 咖啡? 甜甜圈?  - 麻烦你 黑咖啡
- Coffee? Bagel?  - Coffee. Black.

346
00:35:06,263 --> 00:35:09,349
- 家人好吗?  - 很好
- How's the family?  - Good, sir.

347
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:13,186
- 我何时可认识另一位赖博士?  - 她很渴望认识你
- When do I meet the other Dr Ryan?  - She's dying to meet you, sir.

348
00:35:13,353 --> 00:35:15,480
很好 坐下
Good, good. Sit down.

349
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:19,651
谢谢
Thank you.

350
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:22,029
那么...
So...

351
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:26,325
- 那些钱仍在那里?  - 先生?
- The cash is still there?  - Sir?

352
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,746
- 在夏彼得的离岸户口  - 六亿五千万元
- In Hardin's offshore accounts.  - $650 million.

353
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:32,998
- 和零钱  - 和零钱
- And change.  - And change.

354
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:36,710
- 我们还有那个户口号码  - 是的
- And we have the account numbers.  - Yes, sir.

355
00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:40,839
我们还等什么? 去拿它吧
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get it.

356
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,884
- 去拿?  - 我们把这东西转过来
- Let's get it?  - Let's turn this thing around.

357
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:46,219
六亿五千万元和零钱
$650 million and change.

358
00:35:46,386 --> 00:35:51,308
那是政治资金的十倍
It's worth ten times that in political capital.

359
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:55,062
什么?
What?

360
00:35:55,228 --> 00:36:02,903
夏和那些毒窟的关连 只是一个猜测
Well, this connection between Hardin and the cartels is a theory.

361
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,489
- 猜测?  - 我的猜测
- Theory?  - Atheory of mine.

362
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:09,326
- 这是个猜测?  - 我知道那些钱是在那里
- It's a theory?  - Well, I know the money is there.

363
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:14,289
但我不知道其实夏替谁工作
But who exactly Hardin was working for, I don't know.

364
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:20,170
我们在充公那笔钱之前 要先查证那一点
I think we would have to establish that before we could seize the money.

365
00:36:22,923 --> 00:36:26,218
那么就去那里查证它
So go down there. Establish it.

366
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,054
- 去哪里?  - 哥伦比亚
- Go where?  - Colombia.

367
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:33,350
谁 我?
Who, me?

368
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:41,525
我丢下你两个星期 你却踏进一个大陷阱里
I leave you alone for two weeks, and you walk into a big bear trap.

369
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:43,735
我在想什么?
What was I thinking?

370
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:50,283
你想令总统留下印像 你不该那样做
You were thinking about impressing the President. You shouldn't do that.

371
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,787
- 十一月  - 一月
- November.  - January.

372
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:55,747
是去年的
Of last year.

373
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:03,422
那里有一个人 他以前一直在那里... 祁洛
There's a guy down there, at least he used to be... Clark.

374
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:06,800
我们认识了很久 是个好人
We go way back. Good man.

375
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,928
如果你遇上麻烦 去找他
If you hit a brick wall, look him up.

376
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:13,348
纪上将?
Admiral Greer?

377
00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:16,935
- 化疗  - 该死
- Chemotherapy.  - Oh, shit.

378
00:37:17,728 --> 00:37:19,938
又来了
Here we go again.

379
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:23,567
雷洛培态度怎样?
How's Ritter behaving?

380
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:27,446
雷一贯作风 没有理会我
Ritter's Ritter. He's leaving me alone.

381
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:31,783
真的? 像一只鹰般盯着他
Are you sure? Watch him like a hawk.

382
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,202
- 你好吗?  - 很好
- How are you feeling today?  - OK.

383
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:40,042
我们会替你找个房间 给你一些毛毯 让你躺下
We'll get you in a room, give you warm blankets, get you lying down.

384
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:43,837
然后我们带你回去房间 休息一下
Then we'll get you back to your room and comfortable.

385
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:41,645
变量 这是刀子 准备通话 完毕
Variable, this is Knife, stand by to copy, over.

386
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:47,776
变量 这是刀子 准备通话 完毕
Variable, this is Knife, stand by to copy, over.

别那样 麻烦你给赖博士多点空气
Don't do that. Give Dr Ryan a bit more air back here, please.

405
00:41:34,443 --> 00:41:36,528

Bulletproof.

406
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:47,706

We don't have a picture. Escobedo's intelligence officer.

407

我们也不知道名字 但知道他存在
We don't have a name either, but we know he exists.

408
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:54,880
那个隐形人?
The invisible man?

409
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,300
慢慢地 用你的手
Gently, gently, with your hands.

410

雷斯 把双手放在一起

对了 很好
Yes, very good.

414
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:20,489
什么事?
Yes?

415
00:42:23,325 --> 00:42:24,951
我们又损失了一架飞机
We lost another plane.

416
00:42:28,288 --> 00:42:29,873
知道了
OK.

417
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:36,922
- 是谁干的?  - 如果要我猜...
- Who is doing this?  - If I had to guess...

418
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:40,676
我没有叫你猜 我可以猜
No, I did not ask you to guess. I can guess.

419
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:44,262
有人泄露给缉毒的警员
Someone has been talking to the drug police.

420
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:49,601
不可能 如果有人向警方告密 我会第一个知道
Impossible. If anyone spoke to the police, I'd be the first to know.

421
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:51,853
力图?
Ernesto?

422
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:58,402
是否我对付了那个美国人后 有人想摧毁我?
Is one of the others trying to ruin me after what I did to the American?

423
00:42:58,568 --> 00:43:04,032
我猜那不是你想像的那样
I guess that wasn't quite the deterrent you thought it would be.

424
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:06,785
找那个人出来
Find out who it is.

425
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:18,088
上校 你认为怎样?
What do you make of this, Colonel?

426

我肯定夏跟毒窟有关 那是贩毒的钱
I'm positive Hardin was tied into the cartels. It's drug money.

432
00:43:57,961 --> 00:44:01,882
- 但你证实不到  - 目前为止
- But you can't prove it.  - So far.

433
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,678
- 可介意我问你一个问题?  - 不介意
- Mind if I ask you a question?  - No.

434
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:12,851
为何你告诉我这些 我已经退出很久了
Why are you telling me all this? I've been out of the game for a long time.

435
00:44:15,062 --> 00:44:20,484
我知道你熟识这个城市 人脉也广
I was told that you were wired, and that you knew the town and people.

436

438
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,328

00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:37,250
不大好
He's not good.

440
00:44:38,377 --> 00:44:40,295

442

443
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,521
赖博士 你喝咖啡吗?
You a coffee drinker, Dr Ryan?

444
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:04,569
- 我喜欢喝咖啡  - 试一下连度牌

445
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:08,240
- 连度?  - 我相信你会喜欢它
- Lindo?  - I think you'll like it.

446
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:17,791
总统先生 我有好消息
Mr President, I've got some good news.

447
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:22,838
你可能认识夏在这里的拍档 颜力图
Hardin's partner here was someone you may know of. Ernesto Escobedo.

448
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:28,385
- 有理由  - 这是否你另一项猜测?
- Escobedo? It figures.  - Is this another of your theories?

449
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:34,599
不 这是事实 颜力图像这里的毒枭一样
No, sir. We can call this one fact. Escobedo, like every drug lord here,

450
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:40,439
也进行合法生意 夏跟这些生意有来往
also had legitimate businesses. Hardin was doing business with these.

451
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:45,902
其中是进口咖啡 那没什么大不了
Importing, among other things, coffee, which means nothing,

452
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:52,576
但他以高价购入这些咖啡 每磅六千二百元
but he was paying too much for this coffee. $6,200 a pound.

453
00:45:52,743 --> 00:45:56,288
- 那是昂贵的咖啡  - 我同意
- That's expensive coffee.  - I'd have to agree.

454
00:45:56,455 --> 00:45:59,291
这是好消息 我相信这个可以了
This is good news. I think this does it.

455
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:03,420
我也有些不大好的消息
Sir, I also have some other news which is not so good.

456
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:05,964
天啊
Oh, God.

457
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:12,095
外交部觉得这里的政府 想取得充公了的钱
The DEA feels that the government here would want the seized funds.

458
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:17,142

- Or at least a large portion.  - This is our money.

459
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:21,104

- We found it.  - We can try telling them that.

460
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:24,691
尝试? 向他们说或不说也好 我不管
Try? Tell them. Or don't tell them, I don't care.

461
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:29,571
- 恕我冒犯...  - 告诉他们这是我们的钱
- Sir, with all due respect...  - This is our money, tell them that.

462
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:34,826
我不懂得怎样说或是从何说起 我不是个谈判专家
I wouldn't know what to say or where to start. I'm not a negotiator.

463
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:37,245
你可认识政府里的人?
You know someone in their government?

464
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:40,082
他们的检察总长是我的同学
I went to school with their Attorney General.

465
00:46:40,248 --> 00:46:46,046
谢国士会过来 他来谈判 这是我们的钱
Jacobs will come down. He'll negotiate. This is our money.

466
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:47,255
谢...

467
00:46:48,924 --> 00:46:51,009
谢谢
Thank you.

468
00:46:53,887 --> 00:46:55,973
我讨厌这份工作
I hate this job.

00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:16,303

谢先生 你离去前 可否签这个?
Mr Jacobs, could you sign these before you leave?

478
00:49:32,754 --> 00:49:38,010
梅丽 你明天不如请病假

479
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:41,555
还有后天 我不会对人说
And the next day. I won't tell anybody.

480
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:45,183
你虽然不在这里 还有很多工作要做
Even when you're not here there's plenty to do.

487
00:50:54,336 --> 00:50:59,216
我告诉她你在工厂 请讲
I told her you were on the factory floor. Go ahead.

488
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:02,594

已经确认出几个从卢森堡

496
00:51:42,175 --> 00:51:46,221
至开曼群岛的户口 被用作洗黑钱
to the Cayman Islands, used for laundering drug money

497
00:51:46,388 --> 00:51:51,810
是前所未有的程度 牵涉五个外国政府

Also to seize 20 real estate joint-venture investments in the US

501
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:11,872
这些都是洗钱活动中的主要代理人
which were the primary agencies in the laundering operations.

502
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:15,792
你说是六亿五千万元?

不错 六亿五千万元和零钱

- Jacobs is not available.  - Someone will die for this.

509
00:52:43,236 --> 00:52:48,283
他亲身处理调查 而且很忙
He's personally involved in the investigation and is pretty busy.

510
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,091
要避过这条路 他们会从机场来
This avenue has to be avoided. They'll be coming from the airport.

511
00:53:04,257 --> 00:53:08,303
从艾多鲁机场一直到美国大道
Up Avenida Aeropuerto El Dorado all the way to Gran America.

512
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:13,392

Santa Fe's our spot. As much as I'd love to be here for this,

但我得去华盛顿办些事 琐碎的事务
I have to take care of business in Washington, tying up loose ends.

514
00:53:28,365 --> 00:53:31,952
别挂线 别挂线
Hello? Don't hang up, don't hang up.

我想你不该喝那些水?
So I take it you shouldn't drink the water?

527

你的房间里有水 但我还是喝瓶装的
They put water in your room, but I'd stick to the bottled stuff.

用瓶装水好了 否则你会全身不舒服
You use the bottled water, or you'll be in the can all yourtime here.

动的!
It's running!

549

552
01:02:56,391 --> 01:03:01,229

身陷其中 达恩死了
Right in the middle of it. Honey, Dan was killed.

554

555
01:03:10,697 --> 01:03:14,451
我距离十尺 什么也做不到
He was ten feet away. There was nothing I could do.

556
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:19,665
- 我回家了  - 谢天谢地

562
01:03:43,271 --> 01:03:45,899
- 是的  - 他们错了

他们直接挑战美国政府

不得再发讯息

565
01:03:56,243 --> 01:04:00,372

01:04:05,544 --> 01:04:10,048
他想含糊时便不能清晰
He can't be clear when clarity is what he wants to avoid.

568

他的意思是要强硬一点
What he means is the gloves come off.

我对你说 这件事跟我无关
I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with it.

570
01:04:34,573 --> 01:04:39,328
但愿是我做的 他们活该 但不是我做的
I didn't. I wish I had done it, they deserved it. But it wasn't me.

571
01:04:39,494 --> 01:04:41,621

你没有答案
You know, you have no answers.

573
01:04:48,545 --> 01:04:51,798
贾斯洛那时是这样的吗? 没有答案?

574
01:04:51,965 --> 01:04:55,177
- 你不想知道答案  - 我想
- You don't want to hear an answer.  - Yes, I do.

575
01:04:57,638 --> 01:05:01,350
是其中一人要把它做成是你干的
Itwas done to look like you did it. By one of the others.

576
01:05:01,516 --> 01:05:05,729
正如你怀疑 总是一个最憎恨你的朋友
As you suspected. It's always a friend who hates you most.

577
01:05:05,896 --> 01:05:07,981
把电话给我
Give me the phone.

578
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:17,240
- 卢艾力  - 是你干的吗?
- Rojas.  - Did you do this thing?

579
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:23,372
是否我干的? 你打电话来问是否我干的?
Did I do this thing? Are you calling to ask me if I did this thing?

580
01:05:23,538 --> 01:05:27,459
你没有我们和磋商 你危害大家
You don't consult with us. You put us in danger.

581
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:32,547
你要我相信不是你?
And now you want me to believe it wasn't you?

582
01:05:32,714 --> 01:05:34,508
艾力 不是我
It wasn't, Enrique.

583
01:05:34,675 --> 01:05:37,886
美国人会向我们报复
The Americans will retaliate against all of us.

584
01:05:38,053 --> 01:05:41,306
我发誓跟这件事无关
I swear I had nothing to do with it.

585
01:05:41,473 --> 01:05:45,560
你以为我会听你这些谎话?
Why do you expect me to listen to you when you lie?

I don't know what you said to him, but it was right.

594
01:08:16,586 --> 01:08:18,297
你觉得奇怪吗?
Strange, don't you think?

595
01:08:18,463 --> 01:08:23,218
谢国士和他的秘书同一天被杀
Jacobs and his secretary getting killed on the same day.

596
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:28,682
不是他的秘书 是一个保安人员
He wasn't his secretary. He was a member of the security detail.

597
01:08:28,849 --> 01:08:30,934

603
01:08:53,373 --> 01:08:57,544
- 她那样称呼他  - 问题是 他是个拉丁人
- That's what she called him.  - The point is, he's Latin.

604
01:08:57,711 --> 01:09:00,047
这把她和谢国士之死
Which connects her death and Jacobs's

605
01:09:00,213 --> 01:09:03,008
牵连到工作关系以外

606

你见过怀疑是两宗谋杀案的凶手?

保持目标

660
01:14:39,136 --> 01:14:40,762

I had nothing to do with the death of Mr Jacobs.

I'd say you'd been using too much of your product.

I'm cruising about five clicks south of the village.

1043
02:02:25,961 --> 02:02:30,048
- 留在那里 我再联络你  - 收到
- Stay there. I'll get back to you.  - Roger that.

1044
02:02:41,893 --> 02:02:44,730
- 没有人  - 那些囚犯!
- No one.  - The prisoners!

1045
02:03:31,234 --> 02:03:34,529
来吧 孩子 我们快走
Come on, guys. Let's go, son.

1046
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:38,325
我们要回家了
We're going home, boys.

1047
02:04:51,315 --> 02:04:54,067
到连度咖啡厂接我们
Pick us up at the Lindo Coffee factory.

1048
02:06:30,497 --> 02:06:34,459
不单我可以向传媒揭发你 士兵也可以
Not only can I expose you to the press, so can the soldiers.

1049
02:06:34,626 --> 02:06:41,341
你可想跟法庭和记者冒险?
Do you want to take your chances with the courts and the reporters?

1050
02:06:41,508 --> 02:06:46,179
结束你总司令的政治生涯?
Do you want to end the career of your commander in chief?

1051
02:07:30,182 --> 02:07:32,517
我们走!
Let's go!

1052
02:07:59,586 --> 02:08:03,090
快上来! 我们要走了!
Get your asses in here! Come on, we got to go!

1053
02:08:06,093 --> 02:08:08,345
来吧!
Come on!

1054
02:08:15,018 --> 02:08:17,354
慢着! 我们要等赖!
Hold it! We wait for Ryan!

1055
02:08:17,521 --> 02:08:19,564
什么? 我们要走了!
Yeah? We're out of here!

1056
02:08:26,822 --> 02:08:29,950
低飞! 他在下面!
Set it down! He's down there!

1057
02:08:42,045 --> 02:08:43,714
来吧!
Come on!

1058
02:09:03,025 --> 02:09:04,860
我抓到你!
I've got you!

1059
02:09:11,742 --> 02:09:14,286
蔡维斯 掩护我!
Chavez, cover me!

1060
02:09:23,128 --> 02:09:26,506
你的手 把你的手给我!
Your hand. Give me your hand!

1061
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:35,158
总统现在见你
The President will see you now, sir.

1062
02:10:47,421 --> 02:10:50,757
杰克! 你到来真好
Jack! I'm glad you're here.

1063
02:10:51,925 --> 02:10:56,054
坐下 要喝点什么?
Sit down. Can I get you anything?

1064
02:10:56,221 --> 02:10:58,557
不用了
No.

1065
02:10:58,724 --> 02:11:03,020
- 来吧 坐下  - 我宁愿站着
- Come on, sit down.  - I would prefer to stand, sir.

1066
02:11:05,105 --> 02:11:11,612
这里有一些事情 我正开始留意到
Some things have gone on here that I'm just becoming aware of.

1067
02:11:11,778 --> 02:11:16,033
我像你一样一直毫不知情
I was kept in the dark, as you were, for a very long time.

1068
02:11:16,199 --> 02:11:19,453
- 麻烦的事情  - 是的
- Troubling things.  - Yeah.

1069
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:23,957
现在我们要处理它们 看谁要负责
Now we have to sort them out, figure out who is responsible for what

1070
02:11:24,124 --> 02:11:27,878
和怎样处置它 我们还要小心行事
and what to do about it. We have to do this very delicately,

1071
02:11:28,045 --> 02:11:31,965
否则人们可能会误会
otherwise people might get the wrong idea.

1072
02:11:32,132 --> 02:11:34,343
我们要说谎
We have to lie.

1073
02:11:35,427 --> 02:11:40,098
- 我有那样说吗?  - 你没有
- Did I say that?  - No, you didn't.

1074
02:11:40,265 --> 02:11:43,935
- 你很生气  - 我很生气
- You're upset.  - I'm upset.

1075
02:11:44,102 --> 02:11:49,650
这是可以谅解的 可介意我给你一点忠告?
It's understandable. Do you mind if I give you a bit of advice?

1076
02:11:49,816 --> 02:11:52,110
你知道这件事 你很聪明
You know this because you're smart.

1077
02:11:52,277 --> 02:11:56,323
当你生气时别作重要的决定
Never make important decisions while you're upset.

1078
02:11:56,490 --> 02:12:02,037
你有 正因为它 美国士兵和平民都死了
You did. American soldiers and civilians are dead because of it.

1079
02:12:02,204 --> 02:12:06,124
- 我没有下命令...  - 你别跟我耍那套!
- I never ordered any...  - No. Don't play that game with me!

1080
02:12:06,291 --> 02:12:10,462
你别装作不知情 而令他们蒙羞!
You won't dishonour their memories by pretending you didn't know!

1081
02:12:10,629 --> 02:12:14,424
- 你竟敢训导...  - 你竟敢?
- How dare you lecture...  - How dare you, sir?

1082
02:12:14,591 --> 02:12:18,470
你竟敢到这儿来 像只疯狗般向我狂吠!
How dare you come here and bark at me like a junkyard dog!

1083
02:12:18,637 --> 02:12:21,974
我是美国总统!
I am the President of the United States!

1084
02:12:25,936 --> 02:12:29,481
这件事令我不好受
It gives me no pleasure to do it, sir.

1085
02:12:29,648 --> 02:12:32,901
作为署理情报局副局长
As Acting Deputy Director of Intelligence it is my duty

1086
02:12:33,068 --> 02:12:37,072
向参议院监督委员会报告这事 是我的职责
to report this matter to the Senate Oversight Committee.

1087
02:12:41,994 --> 02:12:44,162
你不能那样做
You're not going to do that.

1088
02:12:45,914 --> 02:12:47,874
- 我不能?  - 不 不
- I'm not?  - No, no.

1089
02:12:50,127 --> 02:12:54,089
你手上现在有个筹码
You've got yourself a chip in the big game now.

1090
02:12:55,382 --> 02:12:57,592
你大可把它留下来
You're going to tuck that away,

1091
02:12:57,759 --> 02:13:01,346
当你自己有麻烦时
save that for a time when your own ass is on the line.

1092
02:13:01,513 --> 02:13:04,599
就把它拿出来
And then you're going to pull it out.

1093
02:13:04,766 --> 02:13:09,229
我也可以助你换成现金 是吗?
And I'm going to cash it in for you. Right?

1094
02:13:11,023 --> 02:13:14,568
我没有其他事要向你说了
I don't think I have anything more to say to you, sir.

1095
02:13:15,861 --> 02:13:21,325
国家不能再有另一宗丑闻 为了自保
The country can't afford another scandal, Jack. To protect itself,

1096
02:13:21,491 --> 02:13:26,997
它不可让另一宗诡计 影响至高层
it won't allow another deception that goes all the way to the top.

1097
02:13:27,164 --> 02:13:31,043
你要受责 葛和雷也会负上一些责任
You'll take the blame. Cutter and Ritter will take some, too,

1098
02:13:31,209 --> 02:13:34,713
他只是很轻微
but it won't amount to much, a slap on the wrist.

1099
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:40,010
然后到讲学圈子赚时薪二万元
Then $20,000 an hour on the lecture circuit.

1100
02:13:40,177 --> 02:13:43,972
其余的责任将落在纪身上
The rest of the blame will fall on Greer.

1101
02:13:44,139 --> 02:13:48,101
不错 你会带着他下台
Yeah, you'll take him down with you.

1102
02:13:48,268 --> 02:13:50,979
你会摧毁他的名誉
You'll destroy his reputation.

1103
02:13:51,146 --> 02:13:56,652
但只会到那个地步 像古老的波托马克二步舞
But that's as far as it will go. The old Potomac two-step, Jack.

1104
02:13:59,488 --> 02:14:03,325
对不起总统先生 我不跳舞的
I'm sorry, Mr President, I don't dance.

1105
02:14:26,348 --> 02:14:28,934
赖 你有时间吗?
Ryan, have you got a minute?

1106
02:14:29,101 --> 02:14:31,603
没有
No.

1107
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:34,439
我们要谈一下!
We need to talk!

1108
02:14:34,606 --> 02:14:36,692
赖!
Ryan!

1109
02:15:01,008 --> 02:15:06,722
委员会会议正式开始 主席现在传召赖博士
The Committee will come to order. The Chair will now call Dr Ryan.

1110
02:15:27,659 --> 02:15:31,663
赖博士 感谢你今天出席会议
Dr Ryan, thank you for appearing before the Committee today.

1111
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:33,540
谢谢你 主席
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

1112
02:15:34,082 --> 02:15:37,544
请起立 举起你的右手
Please stand and raise your right hand.

1113
02:15:40,505 --> 02:15:44,468
你是否严肃地发誓 你即将作出的供词
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give

1114
02:15:44,635 --> 02:15:46,428
是事实 全部的事实
is the truth, the whole truth

1115
02:15:46,595 --> 02:15:49,348
只有事实 求主保佑你?
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1116
02:15:51,850 --> 02:15:54,019
是的
I do.

1117
02:15:55,604 --> 02:16:00,984
赖博士 你已作出宣誓 请坐
Dr Ryan, you may consider yourself under oath. Please be seated.
