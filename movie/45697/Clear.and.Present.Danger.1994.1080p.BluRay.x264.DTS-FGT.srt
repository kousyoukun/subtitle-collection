他们是在主人舱房遇害的
They were killed in their staterooms,

显然当时在睡觉

然后被拖到上层甲板，再扔到海里

你还好吗，詹姆斯？
You all right, James?

90

根据缉毒署的资料
according to DEA.

91

为什么？
Why?

92

没什么，总统，只是杀人抢劫嘛
Nothing exotic, sir. Straight piracy and murder.

这又不是头一遭

这可是头一遭我的好友遇害
It's the first time it was a friend of mine.

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,990
是的，总统
Yes, sir.

96
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,790
你刚刚怎么了？没事吧？
What was that in there? Are you all right?

97
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,040
没事
Yeah.

98
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,380
老天，我36小时没睡了，刚才有讲清楚吗？
Geez, I haven't slept in 36 hours. I make any sense?

99
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,550
不知道耶，你刚讲了什么？
I don't know. What did you say?

100
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,380
开玩笑的，讲得很好
Just kidding. Good job.

101

你该上上交际课，巴比
You ought to give diplomacy lessons, Bobby.

102

我只是照实说 这是我的职责
I call it the way I see it. That's my job.

103
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,230
詹姆斯！
James.

104

他找你
And he's yours.

105
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,850
等我一下
Wait for me.

106
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,320
把门关上
Shut the door.

107
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,450
我向美国人民保证过
I promised the American people

108
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,240
要扼止毒品入侵这国家
I would do something about the drugs pouring into this country.

109

对抗毒贩，提供设备而且…
against the cartels with equipment and...

112
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,710
而且一无所获！
And accomplish nothing.

113
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,250
这些毒贩怎么想？
What do these drug dealers think?

114
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,590
以为我们无能吗？是这样吗？
We're powerless, is that what they think?

115
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,920
他们自以为能为所欲为
They think they can keep doing this kind of thing

116
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,260
永远不受制裁！
and there's no response, ever.

117
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,270
你提议采取行动吗，总统？
Are you suggesting a course of action, sir?

118
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,830
我想提议的…
The course of action I'd suggest...

119
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,520
是我不能提议的
is a course of action I can't suggest.

120
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,900
这样我…
I'm...

121

不确定该怎么做
not sure where that leaves us.

122
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,340
贩毒集团对美国国家安全
These drug cartels represent a clear and present danger

123
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,550
是迫切的危机
to the national security of the United States.

124

（哥伦比亚，卡里市，埃内斯托·埃斯科贝多庄园）

我杀了一个偷我钱的…
a thief who was stealing

129
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,700
…臭小偷！
from me!

还有他太太、儿子、女儿
And his wife, and his son, and his daughter.

131
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,950
显然根本没顾虑到后果
Apparently with no thought of the consequences

132
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,580
哦，我好想等他的孩子长大
Oh, I want his kids to grow up

133
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,420
趁我没预料到时
and avenge their father's death

134
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,300
替他父亲报仇…
when I least expect it...

135
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,630
他是美国总统的
He was a good friend

我不感到意外
That doesn't surprise me.

139
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,730
你至少该担心了
It should at the very least concern you.

140
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,150
他们能拿我怎样？
What are they going to do?

141
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,650
通缉我？逮捕我？
Come after me? Arrest me?

142
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,490
你在吓唬我
You're scaring me.

143
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,430
你能不能停下来好好听我说？
Will you stop long enough for me to tell you something important?

and I am counseling you.

147
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,970
我的情报能让你活命
I'm keeping you alive with information.

148
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,390
如果你不听我
Now, if you disregard my counsel,

149
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,640
继续照自己的方式经营生意
if you keep running your business the way you have been

150
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,650
只用子弹，不用脑袋
with your balls instead of your head,

151
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,900
就会有两种结果
two things will happen.

152
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,740
我闪人，你丧命
I'll quit, and you'll get killed.

153
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,630
你忘了跟我报告出差的结果
You forgot to tell me about your scouting trip.

154
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,340
我没忘
No, I didn't.

155
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,420
你又找了一个通风报信的 他是谁？
You made another contact. Who is he?

156
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,630
卡斯特罗也常问我，我的情报来源是谁
Castro always asked me the same question about my sources,

157
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,680
我总是给他一样的答案
and I always gave him the same answer.

158
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,760
对，但卡斯特罗付给你的钱没有我多
Yes, but Castro didn't pay you what I pay you.

159
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,890
这个人不用花你一毛钱
This one will cost you nothing.

160
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,600
女人
A woman.

161
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,150
你在利用女人
You're using a woman.

162
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,450
浮不起来！
It won't float!

163
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,970
约翰，你要吐司还是…？
John, what do you want, toast or...

164
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,160
松饼
Waffles.

165
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,500
我没时间做松饼
I don't have time for waffles.

166
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,580
- 你只能吃吐司  - 有没有看到我的钥匙？
- You can have toast or toast. - Anybody seen my keys?

167
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,420
不是在大厅桌上，就是在你口袋
They're either on the front hall table or in your pocket.

168
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,880
- 约翰  - 煎饼！
- John. - Pancakes!

169
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,590
我的钥匙呢？真是的
Now, where are my keys? Shoot.

170
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,880
- 给我吐司  - 谢谢
- Toast, please. - Thank you.

171
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,590
- 拜  - 拜，宝贝
- Bye. - Bye, honey.

172
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,010
- 拜，爸  - 拜，小家伙
- Bye, Dad. - Bye, pal.

173
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,470
- 爸，这不会浮  - 喂？
- Daddy, it won't float. - Hello?

174
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,060
- 是的  - 它不应该浮的
- Yes. - It's not supposed to float.

175
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,390
这是潜艇，在水里航行的船
It's a submarine. It's a boat that goes underwater.

176
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,940
- 爸  - 杰克
- Dad. - Jack.

177
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,610
喂？
Hello?

178
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,780
什么时候？
When?

179

（男性杂志，60件事）

180
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
本来以为是感冒
I thought I had the flu.

181
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,040
他们要是没告诉我，我还会以为是感冒
I'd still think I had the flu if they weren't telling me otherwise.

182
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,000
他们说了什么？
Well, what... What are they telling you?

183
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,550
恶性胰脏癌
Pancreatic cancer of an aggressive nature,

184
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,880
没听错的话
if I heard them right.

185
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,340
老天
Jesus.

186
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,630
那是什么意思？
Well, what does that mean?

187
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,010
我想意思是我快玩完了
I guess it means I'm in big trouble.

188
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,890
不，我是说可以切除吗？
No, I mean, can they... Can they operate or...

189
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,920
也许吧
Maybe.

190
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,190
他们说也许吧
That's what they said. "Maybe."

191
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,020
在我听来应该是不行
But it sounds suspiciously like "no" to me.

192
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,150
他就是他们其中一人
There's one of them now.

193
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,160
嘿，我还没挂掉
Hey, I'm not dead yet.

194
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,620
不过我人在医院
But I am in the hospital,

195
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,620
不在办公室
which means that I'm not in my office,

196
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,290
因此不知道局里的状况
which means I don't know what's going on.

197
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,710
我需要你驻守
I need you there.

198
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,050
- 哪里？  - 我的办公室，代替我的职务
- Where? - In my office, doing my job.

199
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,130
慢点，我…
No, wait. I...

200
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,640
我最讨厌在状况外，杰克，这点你知道
I hate not knowing what's going on, Jack. You know that.

201
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,680
我怕我不能胜任你的工作
I wouldn't know the first thing about doing your job, sir.

202
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,810
你一直都有参与，我们没秘密
You've been around. No big mystery.

203
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,350
你也去过白宫
You've been to the White House.

204
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,520
一次而已，而且我不喜欢
Once. I hated it.

205
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,190
不，才不是
No, you didn't.

206
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,650
想知道华府的政治哲学吗？
Want to know about politics in Washington?

207
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,360

巴比？
Bobby?

210
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,920
你应该要第一个知道
You should be the first to know,

211
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,710
也许是第三或第四个知道
or I guess the third or fourth to know.

212
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,290
我指派莱恩为情报局代理副局长
I'm appointing Ryan the Acting Deputy Director, Intelligence.

213
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,770
当然这是暂时的
Now, it'll be a provisional appointment, of course,

214
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,880
直到詹姆斯康复为止
until James recovers.

215
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,200
我要你尽快跟他说明
I want you to get him up to speed

216

我们对哥伦比亚的资助计划
on our aid program to the Colombians.

217

他要跟监督委员会报告
He's got to brief the oversight committee

218
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,560
说服他们再拨七千五百万的预算
and talk them out of another $75 million.

219
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,560
而且不能让他像个大傻瓜
And not make a complete fool out of himself.

220
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,440
哈丁家族谋杀案进行得如何？
What's happening on the Hardin murders?

221

我在处理中
I'm on it.

222
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,240
总统要求彻底调查
The President's calling for a full-court press.

223
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,910
那么你们俩要密切配合了
So, you guys are going to be working together, hand in hand.

224
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,240
太好了
That's great.

Margaret.

226
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,930
他的东西留着吧
Why don't we leave all his things?

227
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,310
好的
Okay.

228

莱恩
Ryan.

229
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,280
令人难以置信！
I can't believe it!

230
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,370
你是指他不上道吗？
He's not a team player, is that what you're saying?

231
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,240
不只不上道
Not a team player?

232
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,950
还是个童子军
He's a Boy Scout.

233

该死的童子军
He's a goddamn Boy Scout.

相信忠诚、无私，还喜欢打童军绳
Believes in loyalty, cleanliness and knot tying.

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,050
那就把他排除在外
So leave him out of it.

236
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,550
他可是情报局副局长，詹姆斯
He's the Deputy Director of Intelligence, James.

237
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,340
这下有点麻烦了，你不觉得吗？
It's going to be a little tricky, don't you think?

238
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,930
怎么会？他需要知道什么？
Why? What does he need to know?

239
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,550
不需要
Nothing.

240
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,770
他什么都不需要知道
He needs to know nothing.

241
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,980
他也不会知道
He's going to know nothing.

242

你要什么？
You want what?

245
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,320
你听到了
You heard me.

246
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,410
这件事他并不知情
He doesn't know about it.

247
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,700
让我跟你解释清楚
Let me explain it to you very simply.

248
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,830
这是你答应的，不是我
This is your deal, not mine.

249
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,500
除非我有授权书
So unless I have written authorization,

250
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,540
否则你没戏唱
this thing is over before it begins

251
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,760
因为我可不想在东窗事发时
because I'm not going to be the only one left

你到底能不能负责执行这个行动？
Are you able to handle this operation or not?

263

我要的只是简单的能或不能
What I'm looking for here is a simple yes or no.

你要的是一场政治混乱
What you're looking for is a political mess.

265
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,030
- 能或不能？  - 这是他们要的吗？
- Yes or no? - Is that what they want?

266
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,530
因为这可要付出代价的
Because that's what this is.

267

第一任政府的人要的

对吧？
Have they?

271
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,260
你意思是不？
Is that a no?

272
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,640
可恶
Shit.

I'd say, "No. We were good friends."

426
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,800
要是问你们是不是好朋友
If they should ask if you were good friends,

427
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,300
我会说“我们是一辈子好友”
I'd say, "No, no, we were lifelong friends."

428
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,180
我不会给他们做文章的空间
I would give them no place to go,

429
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,930
没什么好报导，没故事好编
nothing to report, no story.

430
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,770
我意思是事情已经发生了…
I mean, it's no sense defusing a bomb after it's already...

431
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,780
…回避是没用的
It's already gone off.

432
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,090
（加州，杭特利格特堡）
该死！可恶！
Damn. Shit!

433
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,060
你看见他吗？
You see him?

434
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,240
好吧
All right.

435
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,640
小组往左移两公尺
Move your team two meters to the left.

436
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,600
好了
That's it.

437
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,020
停
Stop.

438
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,190
摸摸浅色草堆
Touch that light-colored grass.

439
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,070
狙击手在你脚下
Sniper at your feet.

440
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,080
什么都没有，士官长
There's nothing here, Sergeant Major.

441
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,410
该死！
Damn!

442
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,910
他真行
He is good.

443
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,310
差一点，他怎么移动得这么快？
That was close. How's he moving so fast?

444
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,190
我看到他了 直直往前
I see him. Come in. Straight in.

445
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,650
快点！用跑的！
Now! Run!

446
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,940
继续往前！
Keep coming.

447
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,100
停
Stop.

448
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,510
往左边
To your left,

449
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,950
往左边
to your left.

450
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,120
停，狙击手在你脚下
And stop. Sniper at your feet.

451
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,830
不然是什么？
Well, what is it?

452
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,130
他在这里吃午餐，士官长
He had lunch here, Sergeant Major.

453
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,000
麦当劳汉堡 足三两
McDonald's. Quarter Pounder...

454
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,680
加起司
with cheese.

455
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,810
该死
Damn.

456
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,060
- 该死！ - 第四枪了
- Damn! - That's four.

457
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,940
好了，你赢了！
All right, you won this one!

458
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,490
出来吧！
Come on out!

459
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,950
士兵，你怎么能靠得这么近？
Soldier, how did you get that close to me?

460
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,250
狙击手本来就是神出鬼没
Sniper approached the instructor by being a sneaky bastard,

461
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,460
士官长！
Sergeant Major!

462
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,290
知道在加州乱丢垃圾
Do you know the fine for littering

463
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,790
要罚多少钱吗？
in the State of California, Chavez?

464
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,210
知道，长官！
Yes, sir!

465
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,050
我看到你在训练场的表现，你很行
I saw you on the sniper course. You looked good.

466
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,050
这里的任务快完成了，对吧，中士？
Just about finished here, aren't you, Sergeant?

467
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,310
对，长官
Yes, sir.

468
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,230
期待放长假跟年轻妻子及孩子团聚？
Looking forward to taking some leave with that young wife and kids?

469
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,940
我没有年轻妻子及孩子
I don't have any young wife and kids, sir.

470
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,400
你有什么？
What do you have?

471
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,780
你很少打电话
I mean, you don't call anybody with great frequency,

472
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,530
信件往来也很少
don't write many letters, don't receive them.

473
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,870
容我问一下，长官，你是谁？
Who are you, sir, if you don't mind my asking?

474
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,160
克拉克先生和我共同负责一个特殊任务
Mr. Clark and I are putting together a special mission

475
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,370
任务领导人要我的小组参与其中
and the group commander wants my team to be a part of it.

476
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,170
为期大约六个月
You'd be gone a couple of months, maybe six,

477
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,800
之后要是没死的话
after which, if you're not dead,

478
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,880
你可以选择加入特种部队
you'd have your choice of assignments in Special Ops.

479
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,810
总统先生，你有没有任何评论？
Mr. President, do you have a comment on...

480
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,190
总统先生！
Mr. President!

481
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,070
总统先生
Mr. President.

482
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,690
显然回避问题
And that appears to be defusing an issue

483
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,490
就会让问题愈滚愈大，成为另一个丑闻
that was snowballing into yet another scandal for this administration.

484
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,200
纽约时报报导
The New York Times is reporting

485
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,950
你和哈丁是好朋友
that you and Hardin were good friends.

486
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,870
是不是真的？
Is that true?

487
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,320
不，不仅如此
No, not quite.

488
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,650
我们不仅是好朋友
We weren't good friends.

489
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,540
还是一辈子的好朋友
We were lifelong friends.

490
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,080
那是我说的
I said that.

491
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,330
那是我说的
I said that.

492
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,630
我叫他那么说的
I told him to say that.

493
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,710
怎样？
What?

494
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,420
我什么都没说
I didn't say anything.

495
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,090
- 对，但你心里在想  - 不
- Yeah, but you're thinking something. - No.

496
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,390
我只是被你今天刻意打扮
I was just distracted by how much trouble

497
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,850
分了心而已
you were having with your ensemble today.

498
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,020
- 你不必每天穿得…  - 快点，萨利，快点，走了
- Well, it's not every day... - Come on, Sally. Hurry up, we gotta go.

499
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,110
一副值得信任的样子
you have to look trustworthy.

500
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,860
- 谁跟谁说了什么，爸？  - 没什么
- Who told who to say what, Dad? - It's not important.

501
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,070
- 我可以自己走  - 我知道你可以
- I can walk myself. - I know you can.

502
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,950
- 总统吗？  - 是啊
- The President? - Yeah.

503
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,990
妈妈说她赚的钱比总统还多
Mom says she makes more money than the President.

504
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,860
拜，爸，再见
Bye, Dad. See you.

505
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,540
她也许是对的，再见
She's probably right. Bye.

506
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,300
莱恩博士，谢谢你今天下午
I want to thank you, Dr. Ryan, for the information

507
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,680
跟我们分享了这些资讯
you've shared with us this afternoon.

508
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,720
谢了，参议员
Thank you, Senator.

509
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,930
我同意我们必须协助哥伦比亚
I agree we have to help the Colombians

510
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,600
打击贩毒集团的活动
in their struggle to curtail the drug cartels' activities.

511
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,020
然而我不明白
However, I'm confused.

512
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,900
增加拨款如何让此计划
How do you see additional funds alone

513
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,200
从失败中起死回生？
advancing this program from the utter failure that it is?

514
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,240
明白我的意思吗？
You see what I'm getting at?

515
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,240
我恐怕不明白
No, I'm afraid I don't.

516
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,040
你刚说此计划我方完全采温和政策
You said this effort would be totally benign on our part.

517
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,520
报告上说得很清楚
Well, the finding clearly states

518
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,120
我方仅限于提供意见而已，参议员
that our assistance is limited to supply and advice only, Senator.

519
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,960
我知道，我看过了
I know. I've read that.

520
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
我这星期也看了
I've also read a similar finding,

521
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,630
35年前的一份类似报告
written 35 years ago this week,

522
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,800
关于在东南亚我们一无所悉的丛林
regarding a little-thought-of sliver of jungle in Southeast Asia.

523
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,930
不好意思
I'm sorry.

524
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,390
你拿我们的
You're comparing our request

525
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,310
反毒行动补助款申请案跟越战相比拟？
for supplemental anti-drug funds to Vietnam?

526
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,100
每次我都会这样比拟
I'm comparing it to every instance

527
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,530
在这种立法机构每次要对
a legislative body such as this is asked to

528
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,610
缺乏实证的案件做判断时
render judgment based on less than all the facts.

529
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,070
我不知道该说什么了
Well, I'm afraid I don't know what to say to that.

530
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,780
你可以跟我们保证
You could begin by assuring us

531
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,370
所有事实都已呈报
we have been given all the facts.

532
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,160
我想我是的
I thought I had.

533
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,660
你还可以进一步保证
You could further assure us, then,

534
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,240
这次增加的拨款
that this increase in funds,

535
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,720
或你说的补助款
this "escalation," to use your word,

536
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,130
将不会用在任何秘密的军事行动上
will not be used for any covert military action.

537
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,220
我不知道你怎么会这么想
I don't know how you're getting to this.

538
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,390
根据我丰富的经验
Long experience, sir.

539
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,760
绝不派兵
No troops, then.

540
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,560
我特别说清楚点，因为我不希望有任何误解
I enunciate that clearly because I don't want there to be any mistake.

541
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,270
绝不派兵
No troops.

542
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,940
你可以跟我保证吗？
You could say I have your word on that?

543
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,070
可以，因为我说话算话
You could, indeed, because you do.

544
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,960
- 数到三往下跳  - 好的

545
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,130
听好！
Listen up!

546
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,010
军籍牌！
Dog tags.

547
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,320
全部拿下来
Take them off.

548
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,260
往前传过来
Pass them forward.

549
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,970
检查口袋有没有任何辨别身分的物件
Check your pockets for anything that can be used for identification.

550
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,610
我们在陆地上空
We're feet dry.

551
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,660
看到降落点，请准备
LZ in sight. Get ready.

552
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,290
祝好运，去收拾他们吧！
Good luck, boys. Go get them.

553
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,180
准备降落了
Okay, let's take her down now. We're going down.

554
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,570
快！快！快！
Go! Go! Go!

555
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,580
（后备队罗伯特·里特有内部讯息，连接？是的）

556
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,770
（恭喜，詹姆斯，你的小小战争）

557
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,600
（已经展开了）

558
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,120
嘿，巴伯
Hey, Bob.

559
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,830
- 你好吗？  - 很好，先生
- How you doing? - Good, sir.

560
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,830
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

561
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,420
- 早安，杰克  - 早安
- Good morning, Jack. - Good morning.

562
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,440
莱恩
Ryan,

563
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,870
进来吧
come on in.

564
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,180
认识大家吗？
You know everyone?

565
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,720
认识、认识
Yes, yes.

566
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,760
咖啡？面包？
Coffee, bagel?

567
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,720
黑咖啡，谢谢
Coffee. Black, please.

568
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,270
家人好吗？
So, how's the family?

569
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,440
很好
Good, sir.

570
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,980
何时可以见见莱恩医生？
When am I gonna meet the other Dr. Ryan?

571
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,160
- 她也很想见你  - 很好，很好
- She's dying to meet you, sir. - Good, good.

572
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,480
请坐
Sit down.

573
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,280
谢谢
Thank you.

574
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,200
谢谢
Thank you.

575
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,330
钱还在吗？
So, the cash is still there?

576
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,290
什么？
Sir?

577
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,750
哈丁的海外户头
In Hardin's offshore accounts.

578
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,750
六亿五千万元
$650 million.

579
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,000
- 还有零钱  - 还有零钱
- And change. - And change.

580
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,420
我们有帐号吗？
And we have the account numbers.

581
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,670
有的
Yes, sir.

582
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
那么还等什么？把钱领出来吧
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get it.

583
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,300
- 把钱领出来？ - 把钱领出来
- "Let's get it"? - Let's get it.

584
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,720
把这些钱汇回来
Let's turn this thing around.

585
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,430
六亿五千万加零钱
$650 million and change.

586
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,520
这可比政治资金多十倍
It's worth 10 times that in political capital.

587
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,650
怎样？
What?

588
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,410
哈丁和犯罪集团的勾结是个…
This connection between Hardin and the cartels is a...

589
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,750
推论
theory.

590
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,450
- 推论？  - 我的推论
- "Theory"? - A theory of mine.

591
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,040
这是推论？
It's a theory?

592
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,410
我知道钱确实存在
Well, I know the money is there

593
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,360
不过哈丁究竟…
but who exactly Hardin...

594
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,540
替谁工作，我不确定
was working for, I don't know that exactly,

595
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,920
我想我们必须查清楚
and I think we would have to establish that

596
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,340
才能动那笔钱
before we could seize the money.

597
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,260
那就去啊，快去查清楚
So go down there and establish it.

598
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,180
- 去哪？  - 哥伦比亚
- Go where? - Colombia.

599
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,100
谁，我吗？
Who, me?

600
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,730
我才丢下你短短两周
I leave you alone for two weeks,

601
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,610
你就惹来一身腥
and you walk straight into a big bear trap.

602
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,530
不懂自己在想什么
I don't know what I was thinking.

603
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,030
你想让总统对你刮目相看
You were thinking about impressing the President of the United States

604
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,200
真不是明智之举
and you shouldn't do that.

605
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,620
十一月
November.

606
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,210
- 一月  - 那是去年的
- January. - Of last year.

607
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,130
那里有个家伙
There's a guy down there.

608
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,750
至少以前是的
At least, he used to be.

609
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,550
他就是克拉克
Clark.

610
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,550
我们交情很深 是个好人
We go way back. Good man.

611
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,060
有麻烦，就去找他
If you hit a brick wall, look him up.

612
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,310
格里尔上将？
Admiral Greer?

613
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,100
- 化疗  - 真要命
- Chemotherapy. - Shit.

614
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,270
又要来了
Here we go again.

615
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,240
里特表现得如何？
How's Ritter behaving?

616
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,670
里特吗？
Ritter?

617
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,990
里特还是老样子，根本不鸟我
Ritter's Ritter. He's leaving me alone.

618
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,120
你确定？
Are you sure?

619
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,330
你要小心他哦！
Watch him like a hawk.

620
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,700
你今天感觉如何，上将？
How you feeling today, Admiral?

621
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,870
还好啦
Okey-dokey.

622
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,540
好的，我们带你去房间
All right, now, we're gonna get you in the room.

623
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,290
准备暖暖的毛毯
We've got some warm blankets for you.

624
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,540
只要在那里躺几分钟
It's just gonna take a few minutes.

625
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,960
我们带你去躺下来
We'll get you lying right down there,

626
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,090
然后带你回到舒服的房间
then we'll get you back up to your room and all comfortable.

627
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,630
昨天的治疗还会有点晕吗？
Still a little bit of nausea from yesterday?

628
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,480
变数，这是刀子，准备接受信号，结束
Variable, this is Knife. Stand by to copy. Over.

629
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,780
变数，这是刀子，准备接受信号，结束
Variable, this is Knife. Stand by to copy. Over.

630
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,280
刀子，这是变数
Knife, this is Variable.

631
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,570
你的信号是5乘5，结束
Your signal is five-by-five. Over.

632
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,330
安全
Clear.

633
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,940
鸡在锅子里了，结束
The chicken is in the pot. Over.

634
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,400
- 煮了吧  - 收到
- Cook it. - Roger that.

635
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,800
亲爱的！
Honey?

636
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,300
我来不及了，拜
I'm late. Bye.

637
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,050
祝旅途愉快
Have a good trip.

638
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,930
我不想说
I'm not going to say it.

639
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,220
那就别说
Don't.

640
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,430
要小心
Be careful.

641
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,460
（哥伦比亚，波哥大）

642
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,090
当地时间是…
And local time is...

643
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,970
其实和华盛顿相同，早上11点16分
Well, actually, it's the same as Washington. It's 11:16 a.m.

644
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:39,140
气温是华氏69度…
Gonna be a temperature of about 69 degrees Fahrenheit...

645
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,150
莱恩博士！
Dr. Ryan!

646
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,030
莱恩博士！
Dr. Ryan!

647
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,740
缉毒署，琼·福勒探员
DEA Special Agent Jean Fowler.

648
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,990
- 你好吗？  - 你好，琼
- How you doing? - Hi, Jean.

649
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,250
- 第一次到波哥大，是吧？  - 是的
- First time in Bogota, am I right? - Yeah.

650
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,920
那就别站在这里等人向你开枪
Well, let's not stand out here and let somebody take a shot at you.

651
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,960
你才刚到耶
Hell, you just got here.

652
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,000
走吧，先生，我们走
Come on, sir. Let's go.

653
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,890
这两个是…
And these two are...

654
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,150
- 他们是兄弟  - 兄弟
- They're brothers. - Brothers.

655
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,780
别开窗，帮莱恩博士
Don't... Don't do that.

656
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,240
把空调开大一点
Give Dr. Ryan a little bit more air back here, please.

657
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,740
那是防弹玻璃
Bulletproof.

658
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,710
我们没照片
We don't have a picture.

659
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:49,040
他是埃斯科贝多的情报员
Escobedo's intelligence officer.

660
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,920
不知其名，不过确实有此人
We don't have a name either, but we know he exists.

661
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,510
隐形人吗？
Invisible man, huh?

662
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,930
手要轻轻的
Gently, gently with your hands.

663
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,260
路易斯，双手握好！
Luis, put your hands together!

664
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,230
不是！你的双手！握好！
No! Your hands! Together!

665
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,440
很好、很好
Good. Good.

666
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,110
路易斯，小心慢慢跑！
Luis, watch the canter!

667
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,070
现在小跑 好
Now trot. Good.

668
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,360
对！
Yes!

669
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,780
非常好！
Very good!

670
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,200
是的
Yes.

671
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,660
又失去一架飞机
We lost another plane.

672
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,750
现在短跑
Now go to a shorter trot.

673
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,250
好的
Okay.

674
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,710
是谁干的？
Who is doing this?

675
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,840
要我猜吗？
If I had to guess?

676
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,640
不，我不要你猜
No, that's not what I asked you, to guess.

677
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,220
我也会猜
I can guess.

678
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,180
有人跟缉毒小组告密
Someone has been talking to the drug police.

679
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,850
那是不可能的
Now, that's impossible.

680
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,490
要是有人告密，我会第一个知道
If anyone spoke to the police, I would be the first to know.

681
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,730
埃内斯托
Ernesto?

682
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,610
你认为在我把美国那家人干掉后
You think one of the others is trying to ruin me,

683
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,360
有人想毁了我，抢我的生意？
to steal my business, after what I did to the American?

684
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:03,450
我猜也不是你想的那样
I guess that wasn't quite the deterrent you thought it would be.

685
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,950
去查出是谁
Find out who it is.

686
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,930
你怎么看这件事，上校？
What do you make of this, Colonel?

687
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,800
一个机会
An opportunity.

688
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,430
一个大好机会
An opportunity, Sipo.

689
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,630
- 午安  - 午安

692
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:47,880
克拉克
Clark.

693
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,580
抱歉迟到了
I'm sorry I'm late.

694
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,040
我有十分钟
I got 10 minutes.

695
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,500
好的
Okay.

696
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,340
我确定哈丁和犯罪集团有关
I mean, I'm positive that Hardin was tied into the cartels.

697
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,800
那绝对是贩毒的钱
It's definitely drug money.

698
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,970
但你无法证明
But you can't prove it.

699
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,340
目前是的
So far.

700
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,870
介意我问你一个问题吗？
Mind if I ask you a question?

701
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,180
不会
No.

702
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,140
为什么告诉我这件事？
Why are you telling me all this?

703
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,690
我已经脱离这行很久了
I've been out of the game for a long time.

704
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,020
有人告诉我…
Oh, well, I was told that...

705
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,740
你在这里很吃得开
That you were wired in down here,

706
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,330
地缘、人脉都很广
that you knew the town, the people,

707
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,240
是个中好手
that you were a player.

708
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,370
谁告诉你的？
Who told you that?

709
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,080
詹姆斯·格里尔
Jim Greer.

710
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,210
他好吗？
How's he doing?

711
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,170
不太好
Well, he's not good.

712
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,550
他得了癌症…
It's cancer.

713
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,590
末期
Terminal.

714
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,840
他是个好人
He's a good man.

715
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,670
最好的
The best.

716
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,270
你喝咖啡吗，莱恩博士？
You a coffee drinker, Dr. Ryan?

717
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,900
是的，我喜欢喝咖啡
Yeah, I like coffee.

718
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,680
试试林度牌
Try the Lindo brand.

719
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,410
林度
Lindo.

720
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,410
我想你会喜欢
I think you'll like it.

721
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,630
总统先生，我有一些好消息
Mr. President, I've got some good news.

722
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,790
很好
Good.

723
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,920
哈丁在这里的合伙人，是你知道的人
Hardin's partner down here was someone you may have heard of,

724
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,720
就是埃内斯托·埃斯科贝多
Ernesto Escobedo.

725
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,130
- 埃斯科贝多  - 是哦
- Escobedo. - That figures.

726
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,550
这又是你的另一个推论吗，莱恩？
Now, is this another of your theories, Ryan?

727
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,810
不是的，这是事实
No, sir. I think we can call this one fact.

728
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,850
埃斯科贝多跟这里其他毒贩头子一样
Escobedo, like every other drug lord down here,

729
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,860
也经营合法生意
was also running legitimate businesses,

730
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,780
哈丁也参与这些生意
and Hardin was doing business with these businesses,

731
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,820
进口很多货品，包括咖啡
importing, among other things, coffee,

732
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,910
这件事看来似乎没什么
which in and of itself means nothing,

733
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,700
但他对咖啡出的价太高
but he was paying a little bit too much for this coffee.

734
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,590
每磅要六千两百元
$6,200 a pound,

735
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,660
我没算错的话
if my arithmetic is correct.

736
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,420
好贵的咖啡
Well, that's expensive coffee.

737
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,180
是的，我同意
Yes, sir. I'd have to agree.

738
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,860
好了，这是好消息
Well, this is good news.

739
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,250
就这样
I think this does it.

740
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,840
总统
Sir?

741
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,460
我还有另一个不太好的消息
I also have some other news which is not so good.

742
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,590
哦，老天
Oh, God.

743
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,130
缉毒署认为…
DEA here feels that the...

744
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,200
哥伦比亚政府会想要…
Colombian government would want the...

745
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,690
没收这笔钱或其中一大部分的钱
seized funds or at least a large portion of them.

746
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,390
这是我们的钱
Well, this is our money.

747
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,190
这是我们的钱，我们发现的
This is our money. We found it.

748
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,350
我们可以试着跟他们谈
We could try telling them that.

749
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,860
试？直接告诉他们
"Try"? Tell them.

750
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,240
或是不告诉他们 随便啦
Or don't tell them. I don't care.

751
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,530
总统，恕我…
Sir, with all due respect...

752
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,340
直接告诉他们 这是我们的钱
This is our money. Just tell them that.

753
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,120
我不知道该怎么说 也不知道从何说起
I wouldn't know what to say. I wouldn't know where to start.

754
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,000
我不是谈判专家
I'm not a negotiator.

755
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,080
你不是认识他们政府的人吗？
Don't you know someone in their government?

756
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,130
我曾跟他们的司法部长一起求学
I went to school with their attorney general.

757
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:44,250
雅各布斯会去 他会负责谈判
Jacobs will come down. He'll take care of it. He'll negotiate.

758
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,880
- 好的  - 这是我们的钱
- Yes, sir. - This is our money.

759
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,510
谢…
Thank...

760
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,340
谢谢你
Thank you.

761
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,520
我讨厌这工作
I hate this job.

762
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,100
小心前面！
Eyes up!

763
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,060
爆破小组，快往前！
Demo team, up!

764
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,650
准备安装！
Device set!

765
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,190
炸弹进洞！
Fire in the hole!

766
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,780
炸弹进洞！
Fire in the hole!

767
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,780
快走！快走！快离开！
Let's go! Let's go! Move out!

768
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,790
走！走！走！
Go! Go! Go! Go!

769
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:42,790
趴下！趴下！
Down! Down!

770
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,480
干这件事的人死定了
Whoever did this is dead.

771
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,190
敢对我干这件事的人死定了！
Whoever did this to me is dead!

772
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,650
听到没？！
Do you hear me?

773
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,650
有没有听到我的话？！
Are you listening to me?

774
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,630
到飞机上再讨论一遍
We'll go over it in the plane again.

775
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,710
雅各布斯先生，离开前能不能签一下这些文件？
Mr. Jacobs, could you sign these before you leave?

776
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,670
- 利兹，你跟我妻子说了吗？  - 是的
- Liz, did you speak to my wife? - Yes.

777
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,720
莫伊拉，你明天要不要请个病假？
Moira, why don't you call in sick tomorrow?

778
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,350
还有后天
And the next day.

779
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,850
我不会说出去的
I won't tell anybody.

780
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,480
就算你不在，工作也不会少
Just because you're not here doesn't mean there's nothing to do.

781
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,270
你的行程表
Your itinerary.

782
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,810
连这种事也要跟我争论吗？
You're gonna argue with me about this?

783
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,530
你工作太辛苦了
You work too hard.

784
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,610
再见
Adios.

785
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,360
祝愉快
Have a good time.

786

Roberto Landa, please. This is Moira Wolfson.

One moment, please, Ms. Wolfson. I'll see if I can find him.

796
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,020

797
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,240
好的

你这几天有空吗？

801
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,150
这几天吗？
The next couple of days?

802
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,600
我有空
I am.

803
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,770
我老板出国了
My boss is leaving the country.

804
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,590
我待会儿回你电话？
Can I call you later?

805
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,860
好的，打到我家，拜
All right. Call me at home. Bye.

806
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,070

午安，总统先生

809
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,080
打击毒贩方面有好消息
Good news in the fight against drugs.

810
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:38,550
我很高兴在此宣布，根据司法部的调查
I wish to announce that an investigation by the Department of Justice

811
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:41,470
已查获数个银行帐户

812
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,450
卢森堡及开曼群岛
from Luxembourg to the Cayman Islands

813
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,900
作为毒贩洗钱之用
used for laundering drug money...

814
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,930
金额空前庞大
on an unprecedented scale.

815
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,810
在五国政府合作下
In cooperation with five foreign governments,

816
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,210
我们已采取必要行动没收这笔赃款

817
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:00,570
总金额逾六亿五千万元
which amount to over $650 million.

818
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,650
该死
Shit.

819
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,700
并且，查封二十间房地产合资公司
Also, to seize 20 real estate joint venture investments

820
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,830
在美国境内的
here in the United States,

821
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,790
这些公司主要用来洗黑钱
which were the primary agencies in the laundering operations.

822
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,830
- 总统先生！  - 马丁
- Mr. President! - Martin.

823
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,750
总统先生，你刚说六亿五千万元吗？
Mr. President, you did say $650 million?

824
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,720
没错，六亿五千万加零钱
That's right. It is $650 million and change.

825
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,430
他们偷我的钱！
They're stealing my money!

826
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,090
- 伊莉莎白？  - 我们有多少胜算？
- Elizabeth. - What's our take?

827
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,970
- 我没听清楚  - 我们有多少胜算？
- I'm sorry? - What's our take?

828
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,770
我们的胜算 此刻很难说
Our take. It's hard to say at the moment.

829
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,430
- 才不是  - 很难说…
- No, it isn't. - It's hard to describe...

830
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,150
你偷我的钱，那是我赚的，你偷我的钱！
You're stealing my money. I made it and you're stealing it!

831
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,730
- 总统先生  - 什么？
- Mr. President. - Yeah?

832
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,980
我们可不可以请联邦调查局局长雅各布斯说明这件事？
Can we speak with FBI Director Jacobs about this matter?

833
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,740
雅各布斯局长目前无法回应
Director Jacobs is not available for comment.

834
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,030
有人要付出代价
Someone will die for this.

835
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,320
他亲自参与这项调查
He's personally involved in this investigation.

836
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:50,330
他和他的小组此刻无法分身
As you can imagine, he and his team are pretty busy at the moment.

837
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,580
（林度咖啡）

838
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,700
不，不
No, no.

839
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,090
必须避开这条街
This avenue has to be avoided.

840
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,800
他们从机场来…
They'll be coming from the airport...

841
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,140
沿厄尔多拉多大道
up Avenida Aeropuerto El Dorado

842
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,260
到阿美利亚大道
all the way to Gran America.

843
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,220
圣大非是我们的据点
Santa Fe's our spot.

844
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,560
我很想留在这里看好戏
As much as I would love to be here for this,

845
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,310
但我得到华盛顿办点事
I have to take care of some business in Washington,

846
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,520
有些事要做了结

好了，走吧
All right. Let's go.

859
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,700
食物好吃吗？
So how's the food?

860
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,770
就像墨西哥料理
It's like Mexican food.

861
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:46,150
- 我讨厌墨西哥料理  - 你讨厌墨西哥料理
- I hate Mexican food. - You hate Mexican food.

862
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,190
我秘书所知道的美国
The only thing my secretary knows about America

863
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,030
全都是从旅游手册及杂志看来的
is what she reads in travel brochures and People magazine.

864
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,280
这里好吗？
How's the place?

865
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,450
进来不就知道了
Come inside and find out.

866
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,740
好的
Okay.

867
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,040
这里…糟透了
It's awful.

868
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:47,920
是吗？
Isn't it?

869
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:14,910
我想你没喝这里的水
So I take it you shouldn't drink the water.

870
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,490
房间里有供应水，但我没喝
Well, they put water in your room, but I wouldn't trust it.

871
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,790
我还是瓶装矿泉水
I'd stick with the bottled stuff.

872
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,550
那你怎么刷牙？
So what do you brush your teeth with?

873
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,550
用瓶装矿泉水
Use the bottled water,

874
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,470
不然就得一直躺在医院里
or you'll be in the can all the time you're here.

875
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,060
持枪抢劫案和政府有关？
Our holdup was a government connection?

876
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,280
大有关系，不用怀疑
Yeah, yeah, that's the big connection. No doubt.

877
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,020
怎么回事？
What the hell?

878
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:16,820
我的天！
- Jesus! - Oh, my God!

879
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,580
后退！后退！
Back up! Back up!

880

快点！跟上！
Move it! Step on it!

881
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,670
趴下！趴下！
Stay down, boss! Stay down!

882
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,260
- 趴下！  - 该死！
- Stay down! - Damn it!

883
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,930
小心！
Watch out!

884
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:50,190
该死！该死！后退！后退！
Damn it! Damn it! Back up! Back up!

885
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,610
快走！快走！快出去！
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

- Take it easy, Andy. - We've got to keep moving!

快走，杰克！
Come on, let's go, Jack!

890
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,260
炸弹来了！
Incoming!

891
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,220
绕过去！
Get around it!

892
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,270
你后面！
Behind you!

893
00:59:58,590 --> 00:59:59,800
丹恩！
Dan!

894

丹恩、丹恩！
Dan. Dan!

895
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,890
不能留在这里！
We can't stay here!

896
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,140
车子还能开吗？
The car, is it running?

897
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,190
可以！
It's running!

898
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:56,480
浓烟可以当掩护 这是唯一的机会
The smoke will give us cover. It's our only chance.

899
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,440
我背他
I got him.

900
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,280
冲向驾驶座
Make for the driver's side.

901
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,650
预备…走！
Ready? Go!

902
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,370
进去！
Get in!

903
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,830
快走！快走！
Go! Go!

打扫房间
Housekeeping.

905
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,830
打扰了，夫人
Excuse me, ma'am.

联邦调查局局长埃米尔·雅各布斯…

01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,550
- 有电话找莱恩医生  - 请等一下，医生
- You have a call for Dr. Ryan? - Just a moment, Doctor.

…今天在波哥大街头遇难

请把莱恩博士的电话转到451
Please transfer Dr. Ryan's call to 451.

Five of the dead have been identified as security personnel attached to the...

912
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,770
凯西
Cathy.

913
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:01,360
别跟我说你也在场
Don't tell me you're in this thing.

914
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,780
我就在现场
I'm right in the middle of it.

915
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:06,850
亲爱的，丹恩死了

丹恩·穆雷

917
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,830
我近在咫尺却束手无策
I was 10 feet away. There was nothing I could do.

918
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,040
我要回家了
I'm coming home.

919
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,370
谢天谢地
Thank God.

920
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,830
我爱你
I love you.

921
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:30,220
我以为没人知道他去那里
I thought his going down there was a secret.

922
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,430
是的
It was.

923
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,180
那么我不明白
Then I don't get it.

924
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,390
怎么会这样？
What happened?

925
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,220
没人知道
Nobody knows.

926
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:38,930
这些人怎么这么蠢？
How stupid are these people?

927
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,900
他们认为可以为所欲为
They believe they can do anything.

928
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,190
知道吗？他们错了
You know what? They're wrong.

929
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,190
- 是，总统  - 大错特错
- Yes, sir. - They're wrong.

930
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,650
他们公然挑战
They've directly challenged

931
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,490
美国政府的公权力
the sovereign power of the United States.

932
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,120
不能再通讯息了
No more sending messages.

933
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,490
不管电话有没有响，他要他们全面监控
He wants them to get the message whether the phone rings or not.

934
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,420
他下的令吗？
Those are his words?

935
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,710
听来像吗？
Do they sound like his words?

936
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,590
他总是避免直接了当地把话说明
He can't be clear when clarity is exactly what he wants to avoid.

937
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,930
他真正的意思是采取强硬手段
What he means is the gloves come off.

938
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:15,930
对
Yeah.

939
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,790
我告诉你
I'm telling you,

940
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,660
我和这件事无关
I had nothing to do with it.

941
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,500
不是我干的
I didn't.

942
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,610
真希望是我，他们活该
I wish I had done it. They deserve it.

943
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,060
但不是我干的
But it wasn't me.

944
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:41,870
那么是谁干的？
Who did, then?

945
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:47,380
你总是没答案
You know, you have no answers.

946
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:52,840
你跟卡斯特罗是这样合作的吗？没答案？
Is this the way it was with Castro? No answers?

947
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,680
你不想听到答案
You don't want to hear an answer.

948
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,140
我想
Yes, I do.

949
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,380
这件事看起来像是你干的
It was done to look like you did it,

950
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,150
有人想栽赃
by one of the others,

951
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:03,600
如你所怀疑的
as you suspected.

952
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,690
一定是最恨你的朋友
It's always a friend who hates you most.

953
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,440
给我电话
Give me the phone.

954
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:18,280
- 我是罗杰斯  - 是你干的吗？
- Rojas. - Did you do this thing?

955
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:20,120
是我干的吗？
Did I do this thing?

956
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,910
你打来就是要问我，是我干的吗？
Are you calling to ask me if I did this thing?

957
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,580
你做事不找人商量
You don't consult with us.

958
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,920
害我们身陷危机…
You put us in danger.

959
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,500
（亚利桑那州，华丘卡堡）

960
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:32,460
现在还很狂妄地要我相信不是你干的？
And now you have the arrogance to want me to believe that it wasn't you?

961
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,340
不是我干的，恩里克
It wasn't, Enrique.

962
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:38,850
你惹到美国人了，他们会来找大家算帐
You have invited the Americans to retaliate against all of us.

963
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,990
我发誓，我和这件事无关
I swear. I had nothing to do with it.

964
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,310
完全无关！
Nothing!

965
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:46,310
你凭什么叫我相信你的一派胡言？
Why do you expect me to listen to you when you're lying to me?

966
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,980
- 再见，埃内斯托  - 不、不、不！
- Goodbye, Ernesto. - No, no, no!

967
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,230
别挂断
Don't hang up.

968
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,360
- 我们必须见个面  - 何时？
- We must have a meeting. - When?

969
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,450
愈快愈好，把这件事说清楚
As soon as possible, to straighten this thing out.

970
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,530
明天晚上
Tomorrow night.

971
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,410
不，我不是告诉你，我是要求你！
No, I am not telling you. I am asking you!

972
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,500
（拦截345）明天晚上见个面好吗？
May we please have a meeting tomorrow night?

973
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,040
- 明天晚上  - 谢谢你
- Tomorrow afternoon. - Thank you.

974
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:41,620
- 他吓到了  - 应该的
- He's scared. - He should be.

975
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,330
我不知道你跟他说了什么，不过说得好
I don't know what you said to him but it was right.

976
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,550
很怪吧？
Strange, don't you think?

977
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:23,140
雅各布斯和他的秘书同一天遇害
Jacobs and his secretary getting killed on the same day.

978
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,350
他不是秘书
He wasn't a secretary.

979
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,770
他是助手，负责维安的
He was an assistant, a member of the security detail.

980
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:30,930
谁？
Who?

981
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,060
我不记得他的名字
I don't remember his name.

982
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:37,480
我说的是莫伊拉
I'm talking about Moira.

983
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:38,780
什么？
What?

984
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,400
莫伊拉 你记得的，雅各布斯的秘书
Moira. You remember. Jacobs' secretary.

985
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:43,280
我知道莫伊拉
I know Moira, honey.

986
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,280
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

987
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:52,830
她说他是拉丁版的杰克·莱恩
She said he was the "Latin Jack Ryan."

988
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,960
是吗？
He was? I mean...

989
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:55,750
她是那么说的
Yeah, that's what she called him.

990
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:56,620
我知道
I know.

991
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,350
重点是他是拉丁人
The point is he's Latin,

992
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,090
让我不禁怀疑她的死和雅各布斯有关
which, in my mind, connects her death and Jacobs' beyond the mere fact

993
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,380
因为他们俩一起工作
that they worked together.

994
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:07,760
你见过跟这两起命案有关的嫌犯？
You saw somebody you think is responsible for both killings?

995
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,180
- 是的  - 是的
- Yes. - Yes.

996
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,680
她见过
She did.

997
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:14,980
莫伊拉，是妈妈，亲爱的…
Hi, Moira, it's Mom. Honey...

998
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,150
她见过
She did.

999
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:26,820
我从很远的地方看到他的背影
I saw him from a distance, from behind.

1000
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:29,540
身高中等、体形中等吗？
Medium height, medium build, et cetera?

1001
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:32,160
可以让我看看吗？
You mind if I look at these?

1002
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,410
度假小屋的人那么形容吗？
Is that what the people from the cabin said?

1003
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,210
是的
Yeah.

1004
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,710
你有查过委内瑞拉这几通电话吗？
Did you check out these calls to Venezuela?

1005
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:45,010
查无此电话
Disconnected.

1006
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,050
好吧
Okay.

1007
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,520
- 所以没线索？  - 我有很多线索
- So, you have no leads, huh? - I have a lot of leads.

1008
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,770
登记住房的假名字
I have a fictitious name on a register.

1009
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:56,020
盗用的信用卡帐号
I have a stolen, phoned-in credit card number.

1010
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,150
还有两名目击证人
I have two eyewitnesses,

1011
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,270
其中一名曾在房里看到嫌犯，但没看清楚
one of whom was in the room who saw a guy but really didn't see him.

1012
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,360
慢点，打断一下
Wait, wait, wait. Excuse me.

1013
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,400
那段留言可以再播一次吗？
Could you play that again?

1014
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:05,740
好的，长官
Yes, sir.

1015
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,870
答录机还开着，莫伊拉
The machine is still on, Moira.

1016
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,790
你有嫌犯声音的录音…
You have a recording of the killer's voice.

1017
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,290
…也许吧
Maybe.

1018
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,460
杰克，我们有新发现

1019
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,440
这是答录机的

- 他吓到了  - 应该的
- He's scared. - He should be.

1026
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:43,110
我不知道你跟他说什么，不过说得好
I don't know what you said to him but it was right.

1027
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:45,610
寇特，做个比对

- 你确定？  - 是的
- You're sure? - Yeah.

1035
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,590
多确定？
How sure?

1036
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,680

Yeah, yeah, I know. Find me the name and I mean quick.

1041

1101
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,640

1102
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,220
我是说你也遇过啊

是很漂亮

1123
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:04,860

美国国家安全顾问
of the United States.

1262
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:12,220
我是指他的老板
I mean to his boss.

1263
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:16,230
我也不是指总统
And I don't mean the President.

1264
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,770
你对他的老板…
You gave your word to

1265
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,440
发过誓
his boss.

1266
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:31,820
你对美国人民发过誓
You gave your word to the people of the United States.

1267
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:36,290
发过誓就要实现
Your word is who you are.

1268
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,420
你还带了什么？
What else you got there?

1269
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:52,300
我带了几本新杂志给你
I brought you some new magazines.

1270
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:06,690
东帝汶的局势似乎稳定下来了

1271
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,860
很好
Good.

1272
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:09,820
就这样吗？
Is that it?

1273
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:11,990
还有一件事
Except for the other thing.

1274
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:17,080
我们做得很成功，也看到具体成果
We've accomplished a lot. We're seeing tangible results.

1275

1279
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:32,930
我担心最近这起

1281
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:40,600

It's just the kind of thing reporters live for.

1282
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,810
他们最爱把事件做连结
They'd love to try to make a connection.

1283
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,860
你认为他们会
And you think they will.

1284
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,400
我认为是该做个了断了
I think it's time the whole thing went away.

1285
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:52,070
如果你是这么想的话
If that's what you think.

1286

我是这么想
I think so.

1287
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,410
那么就做个了断吧
Then it should go away.

1288
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:00,160
当作从没发生过
It never happened.

1289
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:03,500
是的，总统
Yes, sir.

1290
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:08,420
是有可能
Well, I mean, it's possible.

1291
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:10,720
如果能告诉我
It would be a lot easier

1292
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:14,800
你要我入侵哪个系统，会比较简单点

02:09:12,570 --> 02:09:14,410
崔维斯，掩护我！
Chavez, cover me!

1684
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:26,130
你的手！把你的手给我！
Your hand! Give me your hand!

1685
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:35,490
总统现在要见你了
The President will see you now, sir.

1686
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:50,880
杰克，很高兴见到你
Jack. I'm glad you're here.

1687
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:54,380
请坐
Sit down.

1688
02:10:54,510 --> 02:10:56,760
要喝什么吗？
Can I get you anything?

1689
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:57,930
不用了
No.

1690
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:01,310
来吧，坐下来
Come on. Sit down.

1691
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:03,600
我想站着，总统
I would prefer to stand, sir.

1692
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:08,900
有一些事…
Some things have gone on here

1693
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:11,360
…我刚刚才获悉
that I'm just becoming aware of.

1694
02:11:12,570 --> 02:11:16,240
我跟你一样，被蒙在鼓里好一阵子
I was kept in the dark, as you were, for a very long time.

1695
02:11:16,910 --> 02:11:18,870
棘手的事
Troubling things.

1696
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:20,330
是啊
Yeah.

1697
02:11:20,410 --> 02:11:22,370
现在我们必须彻底了解
And now we have to sort them out.

1698
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:24,830
厘清谁该负什么责任
We have to figure out who is responsible for what,

1699
02:11:24,910 --> 02:11:26,160
以及该如何解决
and what to do about it.

1700
02:11:26,250 --> 02:11:28,830
我们必须很小心地处理
And we have to do this very delicately

1701
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:31,750
否则人们会误解
otherwise people might get the wrong idea.

1702
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,550
我们必须说谎
We have to lie.

1703
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:37,880
我有说吗？
Did I say that?

1704
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:40,550
不，你没说
No, you didn't.

1705
02:11:41,050 --> 02:11:42,560
你很失望
You're upset.

1706
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:44,800
我很失望
I'm upset.

1707
02:11:44,970 --> 02:11:46,560
情有可缘
Well, it's understandable.

1708
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:50,270
介意我给你一点忠告吗？
You mind if I give you a bit of advice?

1709
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,900
当然，你知道的因为你是个聪明人
Of course, you know this because you're a smart guy.

1710
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:55,340
绝不要做重大决定
You should never make important decisions

1711
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:56,780
在你失望的时候
while you're upset.

1712
02:11:57,320 --> 02:11:58,570
你却做了
You did,

1713
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:02,830
美国士兵和无辜平民还因此送命
and American soldiers and innocent civilians are dead because of it.

1714
02:12:02,910 --> 02:12:04,120
我从没下令…
I never ordered any...

1715
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:07,160
不，别跟我来这一套
No, don't even think about playing that game with me.

1716
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:09,330
我不会任由你假装若无其事
I will not let you dishonor their memories

1717
02:12:09,420 --> 02:12:11,250
而让他们白白牺牲
by pretending you had nothing to do with it.

1718
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:13,960
你怎么敢进来这里跟我说教？
How dare you come in here and lecture me?

1719
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:15,170
那你怎么敢，总统？
How dare you, sir?

1720
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:16,920
你怎么敢进到这办公室
How dare you come into this office

1721
02:12:17,010 --> 02:12:19,380
像只疯狗对我乱叫！
and bark at me like some little junkyard dog?

1722
02:12:19,470 --> 02:12:22,180
我可是美国总统！
I am the President of the United States!

1723
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:29,440
我也很不愿意，总统
It gives me no pleasure to do it, sir.

1724
02:12:30,770 --> 02:12:33,300
身为情报局代理副局长
As Acting Deputy Director of Intelligence,

1725
02:12:33,390 --> 02:12:36,850
我有责任对监督委员会报告这件事
it is my duty to report this matter to the Senate Oversight Committee.

1726
02:12:42,990 --> 02:12:45,160
你不会那么做的
You're not gonna do that.

1727
02:12:46,830 --> 02:12:48,500
- 我不会吗？ - 不，不
- I'm not? - No, no.

1728
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:54,170
此刻你在这场大赌局里掌握了一个筹码
You've got yourself a chip in the big game now.

1729
02:12:56,340 --> 02:12:58,210
你要把它藏好
You're gonna tuck that away.

1730
02:12:58,450 --> 02:13:02,090
留在最紧急关头时再拿出来用
You are gonna save that for a time when your own ass is on the line,

1731
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:04,220
等你打算拿出来用时
and then you're gonna pull it out

1732
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:07,470
我会给你兑换的
and I'm gonna cash it in for you.

1733
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:10,140
对吧？
Right?

1734
02:13:11,980 --> 02:13:15,400
我想跟你没什么好谈的，总统
I don't think I have anything more to say to you, sir.

1735
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:19,900
这个国家承受不起另一个丑闻，杰克
The country can't afford another scandal, Jack.

1736
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:22,410
为了保护国家
To protect itself,

1737
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:25,240
国家不会让诡计
it won't allow the possibility of another deception

1738
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:27,830
影响到最高层的长官
that goes all the way to the top.

1739
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:29,750
你会成为代罪羔羊
You'll take the blame.

1740
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,200
卡特和里特也会负点责任
Cutter and Ritter will take some, too,

1741
02:13:32,290 --> 02:13:33,380
不过不会太严重
but it won't amount to much.

1742
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:35,540
只会受到小小处罚
They'll get a slap on the wrist

1743
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:38,710
并且在审查期间，每小时补偿两万元
and then $20,000 an hour on the lecture circuit.

1744
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:43,680
其他的责任会推给格里尔
The rest of the blame will fall on Greer.

1745
02:13:44,930 --> 02:13:47,680
哦，对，你会拖他下水
Oh, yeah, you'll take him down with you.

1746
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:51,730
你会毁了他的名誉
You'll destroy his reputation,

1747
02:13:51,850 --> 02:13:54,850
不过事情将会到此为止
but that's as far as it will go.

1748
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:57,230
古老的波托马克二步舞曲，杰克
The old Potomac two-step, Jack.

1749
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:02,820
抱歉，总统先生
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1750
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:04,410
我不跳舞
I don't dance.

1751
02:14:27,390 --> 02:14:28,890
莱恩，你有空吗？
Ryan, have you got a minute?

1752
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:30,560
没有
No.

1753
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:34,270
我们必须谈谈
We need to talk.

1754
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:36,900
莱恩！
Ryan!

1755
02:15:01,630 --> 02:15:04,220
委员会会议正式开始
The committee will please come to order.

1756
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:06,930
主席现在传唤约翰·莱恩博士
The chair will now call Dr. John Ryan.

1757
02:15:28,490 --> 02:15:30,120
莱恩博士，谢谢你出席
Dr. Ryan, thank you very much

1758
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:32,580
今天的委员会会议
for appearing before the committee today.

1759
02:15:32,660 --> 02:15:34,700
谢谢你，主席
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1760
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:37,500
请起立，举起你的右手
Please stand and raise your right hand.

1761
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:42,750
你愿意郑重发誓
Do you solemnly swear

1762
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:45,590
你在这委员会面前所说的一切
that the testimony you're about to give before this committee

1763
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:48,640
全部都是事实，没有别的，只有事实
is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

1764
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:50,350
愿主保佑你吗？
so help you God?

1765
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:54,180
我愿意
I do.

1766
02:15:56,390 --> 02:15:58,650
莱恩博士，你做了宣誓了
Dr. Ryan, you may consider yourself under oath.

1767
02:15:58,730 --> 02:16:00,360
请坐下
Please be seated.
