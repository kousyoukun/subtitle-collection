00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,985
Target bearing 0-2-0.

2
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:22,053
Contact 0-2-0.

- Range 20,000.
- Range 20,000 yards.

- Course 2-5-5.
- Course 2-5-5 true.

- Speed 13.
- Speed 13 knots.

6
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:35,662
Cowboys.

7
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,992
Man the guns.

8
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,252
Enchanter, Mobile.

9
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:48,187
Well, we're a long way from home.
Wake 'em up!

10
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:56,016
What's that?

11
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:00,351
The Navy!

12
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:03,566
Quick, show the flag!
Hurry up!

13
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:18,013
Enchanter!
This is the US Coast Guard!

14
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:21,281
Heave to and prepare to be boarded!

15
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:39,365
Enchanter! You are a US flagged ship,
and we are going to board you.

16
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,763
Heave to now!

17
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,377
l want to see your crew on the bow.

18
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,664
You two, move forward.

19
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:18,133
Randall, come with me.

20
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:26,669
- What do you want?
- Kneel down.

21
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:34,381
Captain... Captain?

22
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:36,041
Go ahead, Senior Chief.

23
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:41,915
lt's a bad one. l think you'd better
send over the video camera.

24
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,973
Jack, come on in.

25
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,707
- How high is the pile on your desk?
- About this high.

26
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,370
- Now it's this high.
- What have you got?

27
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:15,542
You heard about that business in
the south Caribbean? l need the details.

28
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:18,018
- By when?
- As soon as you can.

29
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,720
- OK.
- Jack? Be discreet.

30
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:27,127
What do you mean?

31
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:29,231
You'll find out.

32
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:33,262
Mysterious...

33
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,904
l love a mystery.

34
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,234
- Ryan, John P.
- Let him through.

35
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,273
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

36
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:53,009
- You know where you're going?
- Yes. Thank you.

37
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:57,519
- Oh, where do l park?
- Right over there.

38
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:10,594
...main passageway, going forward...

39
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:13,600
...master stateroom...
blood on the deck...

40
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,501
19 cartridges were recovered...

41
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:23,269
...as well as
the two weapons that fired them.

42
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:30,179
The blood samples taken were
consistent with the crew, Hardin...

43
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,808
...and his wife
and his son and daughter.

44
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:38,413
...blood on sheets and pillows...

45
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,118
...on both starboard and port side racks.
And on the mirror too.

46
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:48,288
They were killed in their staterooms,
apparently as they slept.

47
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:50,797
Dragged topside and thrown overboard.

48
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:57,295
The two men in custody surrendered
after a brief attempt to escape.

49
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:00,737
What do we know about them?
The men in custody?

50
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:07,313
Half a dozen arrests for drug
trafficking in Bogota, Mr President.

51
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:09,847
Drugs.

52
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,184
Suspected ties to the Cali cartel,
not Medellin...

53
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:16,755
You all right, James?

54
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:19,050
...according to DEA.

55
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:21,853
- Why?
- Nothing exotic, sir.

56
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:25,190
Straight piracy and murder.
lt's not the first time.

57
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:30,831
lt's the first time it was a friend of mine.

58
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,695
Yes, sir.

59
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:44,546
- What was that? You all right?
- Yeah.

60
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:47,272
l haven't slept in 36 hours.
l make any sense?

61
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:50,976
l don't know. What did you say?
Just kidding. Good job.

62
00:07:54,655 --> 00:08:00,058
- You should give diplomacy lessons.
- To call it as l see it is my job.

63
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:03,525
- And he's yours.
- Wait for me.

64
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,064
Shut the door.

65
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:18,041
l promised the American people
l'd do something about the drug problem.

66
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,176
You are.

67
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:24,473
We support the Colombians' efforts
against the cartels...

68
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:30,176
We've accomplished nothing. Do these
drug dealers think we're powerless?

69
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:35,654
That they can keep doing this kind
of thing, and there's no response ever?

70
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,322
Are you suggesting
a course of action, sir?

71
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:47,296
The course of action l'd suggest
is a course of action l can't suggest.

72
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:05,339
l'm...not sure where that leaves us.

73
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:13,218
These drug cartels represent
a clear and present danger

74
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,086
to the national security
of the United States.

75
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:55,643
- Cortez, Cortez!
- Hello, how are you?

76
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:59,070
Welcome.
Nice to see you, brother.

77
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:04,613
I'm waiting,
Throw the ball. You see?

78
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:07,789
- Like that. I'm ready.
- You know what you've done?

79
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,950
I killed a thief.

80
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:15,710
I killed a thief
who was stealing from me.

81
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,381
From me!

82
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,302
And his wife, his son
and his daughter.

83
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:25,224
Apparently without thinking
of the consequences.

84
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:27,889
Oh yes, sir.

85
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,731
Should I let his children avenge their
father's death when I least expect it'?

86
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:39,937
He was a good friend and
political ally of the President of the U.S.

87
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,594
That doesn't surprise me.

88
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:54,997
- lt should at least concern you.
- What can they do?

89
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:58,474
Come after me? Arrest me?

90
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:00,806
You're scaring me.

91
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:07,114
Will you stop long enough
for me to tell you something important?

92
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:11,620
Thank you.

93
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:20,862
Listen... You pay me to counsel you,
and l am counselling you.

94
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:24,796
l'm keeping you alive with information.

95
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:30,496
lf you disregard my counsel and keep
running your business like this,

96
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:35,041
with your balls and not your head,
two things will happen.

97
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,346
l'll quit, and you'll get killed.

98
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:54,783
You forgot to tell me
about your scouting trip.

99
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,622
- No, l didn't.
- You made another contact. Who?

100
00:11:59,331 --> 00:12:02,527
Castro always asked me
about my sources.

101
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,194
- l always gave him the same answer.
- Castro didn't pay you what l pay.

102
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:11,807
This one will cost you nothing.

103
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,072
A woman.

104
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:18,542
You're using a woman.

105
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,451
lt won't float.

106
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:31,623
- John, what do you want? Toast?
- Waffles!

107
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:35,317
- No time for waffles.
- Anybody seen my keys?

108
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:38,190
On the front hall table or in your pocket.

109
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:41,423
- Where are my keys?
- Pancakes!

110
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,126
- Toast, please!
- Thank you.

111
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:48,430
- Bye, pal.
- Daddy. lt won't float!

112
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:54,600
lt's not supposed to float,
it's a submarine. lt goes under water.

113
00:12:57,313 --> 00:12:59,338
Hello?

114
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:02,613
When?

115
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:07,520
l thought l had the flu.

116
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:11,351
l'd still think so
if they weren't telling me otherwise.

117
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:17,055
What are they telling you?

118
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:23,190
Pancreatic cancer of an aggressive
nature, if l heard them right.

119
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:26,461
Well, what does it mean?

120
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,896
l guess it means l'm in big trouble.

121
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:35,101
- l mean, can they operate, or...?
- Maybe.

122
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,944
That's what they said, ''maybe'', which
sounds suspiciously like ''no'' to me.

123
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:43,584
There's one of them now.

124
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:49,044
Hey, l'm not dead yet.

125
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:55,392
l am in a hospital, which means
that l'm not in my office,

126
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:57,587
which means
l don't know what's going on.

127
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:00,790
- l need you there.
- Where?

128
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:04,800
- ln my office, doing my job.
- Wait...

129
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,461
l hate not knowing
what's going on, you know that.

130
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,541
l wouldn't know how to do your job, sir.

131
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,146
You've been around.
You've been to the White House.

132
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,941
- Once. l hated it.
- No, you didn't.

133
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:25,176
Want to know about politics
in Washington? Four words...

134
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:27,083
''Watch your back, Jack.''

135
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:38,588
Bobby, you should be the first to know,
or the third or fourth...

136
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:41,963
Ryan is to be acting
Deputy Director of lntelligence.

137
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:47,595
lt will be a provisional appointment,
of course, until James recovers.

138
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:51,436
You brief him
on our aid programme to Colombia.

139
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,512
He has to talk the Oversight Committee
out of another 75 million dollars.

140
00:14:56,681 --> 00:15:00,047
And not make a complete fool
out of himself.

141
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,313
What about the Hardin murders?

142
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,082
l'm on it. The President's calling
for a full-court press.

143
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:13,251
So, you guys are going to be
working together hand in hand.

144
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,394
That's great.

145
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:34,142
Margaret...

146
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:38,214
- Why don't we leave all his things?
- OK.

147
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:53,093
Ryan. l can't believe it!

148
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:56,959
He's not a team player,
is that what you're saying?

149
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:59,066
He's a Boy Scout.

150
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:05,597
A goddamn Boy Scout. Believes in
loyalty, cleanliness and knot-tying.

151
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:08,002
So leave him out of it.

152
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:12,076
He's the Deputy Director of
lntelligence. That will be tricky.

153
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:14,838
What does he need to know?

154
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:20,974
Nothing. He needs to know nothing.
He's going to know nothing.

155
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:24,284
l want a copy
of the President's authorisation

156
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:27,446
of this new action against the cartels.

157
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,087
- You want what?
- You heard me.

158
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:35,020
He doesn't know about it.

159
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:43,195
Let me explain it to you very simply.
This is your deal. Not mine.

160
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:48,398
Unless l have written authorisation,
this thing is over before it begins.

161
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:53,639
l'm not going to be the only one left
without a chair when the music stops.

162
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:37,975
Reciprocity. That's a clever name for it.

163
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:42,349
Revenge is a very, very,
very dangerous motivation.

164
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,195
Are you able to handle this operation
or not? l'm looking for a yes or no.

165
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,331
You're looking for a political mess.

166
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:56,295
- Yes or no?
- ls that what they want?

167
00:17:56,467 --> 00:18:00,926
They want what every first-term
administration wants. A second term.

168
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,669
l don't imagine the boys on the Hill
have approved this.

169
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:13,208
Have they?

170
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:17,317
ls that a ''no''?

171
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:25,653
Shit.

172
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:31,626
l want the money in my account
before l move an inch.

173
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:35,095
- You got it.
- l need a ComSat link.

174
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:37,598
- An insertion team.
- Have a brigade.

175
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:42,330
l don't want a brigade. Just 12 men
who understand discretionary warfare.

176
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:46,306
- Special Ops people, Spanish-speaking.
- Cutter will get the military.

177
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,010
- How are you today, sir?
- Very well.

178
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:59,347
- The purpose of your visit?
- Business.

179
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:02,251
- What business are you in?
- l sell tractors.

180
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:04,323
l build them, then l sell them.

181
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:09,852
- And how long will you be staying?
- A few days.

182
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:41,383
l know it's a risk,
but what's the alternative?

183
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:46,186
Zapping a retina with 6,000 rads
of cobalt? Not a pretty picture.

184
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:49,386
Prettier than a tumour
spreading in the cranial sack.

185
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,588
What is her name?

186
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,465
Listen... Hungry?

187
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:01,732
- Starved.
- We could forget about lunch.

188
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:06,707
- We did that last time, remember?
- Do l remember? Do you?

189
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:12,242
- Vaguely.
- Maybe l should refresh your memory.

190
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:17,611
- Maybe you should.
- Your table is ready now.

191
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:20,779
- We don't need it. l'll get a cab.
- Moira?

192
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:26,451
- Hi! How are you? How's Jack?
- He's great, just great.

193
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:29,620
- You still with the FBl?
- The Director's office.

194
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:32,392
- Who was that?
- My new friend.

195
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,535
Señor Roberto Landa.

196
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:39,763
- Doesn't he look like Jack?
- Does he? l can't quite see.

197
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:44,501
- Only Latin.
- A Latin Jack? This l have to see.

198
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,012
l have to go. Bye.

199
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:54,441
Well, we know it's not piracy.
Pirates steal boats.

200
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,612
They had plane tickets to Bogota
the morning after the killings.

201
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,382
- Hey, Dan.
- How's it going?

202
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:04,925
We're sneaking up on a motive.
Dan Murray, FBl.

203
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:07,995
- Ralph Williams, DEA.
- Said anything yet?

204
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:12,566
- Yeah, ''We're innocent.''
- Till the D.A. offers them a deal.

205
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:16,191
He already has. Regular or extra crispy.

206
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,669
Either referring to fried chicken
or the electric chair.

207
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:22,566
Are you picturing a hit?

208
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:27,145
On a respectable American
businessman and his family?

209
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,810
You're assuming he's respectable.

210
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:44,957
We have memos,
letters, credit card statements...

211
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:50,498
...phone bills, everything
you could need to break his code.

212
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,794
- What's this?
- Old high school yearbook.

213
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:57,961
- Sweethearts, football team...
- You think?

214
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:02,838
- l don't know.
- OK, let's see what we've got.

215
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,341
- No cream?
- There wasn't any.

216
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:10,105
Let's start with birthdays.
Bet your ATM code is your birthday.

217
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:13,275
- Close.
- ln reverse?

218
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:17,354
All right, his birthday is...

219
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:24,226
That would be too easy, wouldn't it?
Try it in reverse.

220
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:27,022
No. His wife's?

221
00:22:28,165 --> 00:22:29,757
No. His son's?

222
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,196
- This could take...
- Months.

223
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:34,268
Son's in reverse. This is for you.

224
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,930
No. Wife's in reverse.

225
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,167
No. Daughter's in reverse.

226
00:22:42,343 --> 00:22:45,335
You've got to change your ATM code.

227
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:54,217
l got it!

228
00:22:54,654 --> 00:22:56,416
l got it!

229
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:10,894
Wife's birth month,
daughter's day, son's year.

230
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:13,934
But not in reverse. Sorry.

231
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:24,607
Print me out that one, will you?

232
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,873
Good boy.

233
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:31,610
Three years ago, Hardin received
a large infusion of foreign money,

234
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:37,017
which he invested wisely
in 20 major shopping centres in the US.

235
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:41,650
l say wisely because in the middle of
the recession, he posted record profits.

236
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:46,195
At least to the lRS, who he apparently
feared more than his own partners.

237
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:49,060
According to the figures he gave them...

238
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:53,964
...the shopping centres
weren't doing so well.

239
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:58,733
But he was just skimming most of
the profits, 650 million dollars,

240
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:02,867
and putting it in numbered accounts
in Luxembourg, Panama

241
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:07,983
and the Cayman lslands.
They killed him for it.

242
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,981
Who?

243
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:13,416
- His partners.
- Who were his partners?

244
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:20,083
lt seems clear that he was laundering
money for the Colombian drug cartels.

245
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:26,289
Jesus... l knew the man for 40 years.
We went to school together.

246
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,526
We almost went into business together.

247
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,761
That would have been good.

248
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,830
The press is going
to have a field-day with this.

249
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:41,671
- No one outside this room knows.
- They will. They always do.

250
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:46,748
lt will come out, you're right about that.
And when it does, we'll...

251
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:51,751
...downplay your relationship
with Hardin somehow.

252
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:55,550
- What?
- What?

253
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:59,454
- We'll defuse it.
- Do you disagree?

254
00:24:59,627 --> 00:25:01,390
No.

255
00:25:01,562 --> 00:25:06,498
Well, actually, yes.
l would go in the other direction.

256
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:11,729
lf a reporter asked if you and Hardin
were friends, l'd say ''good friends''.

257
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:16,636
lf they asked if you were good friends,
l'd say ''lifelong friends''.

258
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:22,370
Give them no place to go,
nothing to report. No story.

259
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:29,416
l mean, it's no sense in
defusing a bomb after it's already...

260
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:33,381
...it's already gone off.

261
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:59,073
- Damn.
- Shit.

262
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:01,709
Do you see him?

263
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:06,780
All right. Move your team
two metres to the left.

264
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:13,084
That's it. Stop.

265
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:17,283
Touch that light-coloured grass.
Sniper at your feet.

266
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,420
Nothing here, Sergeant Major.

267
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:23,695
- Damn!
- He is good.

268
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,808
That was close.
How's he moving so fast?

269
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:53,623
l see him. Come in.
Straight in. Now. Run!

270
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,251
Keep coming.

271
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:03,026
To your left. To your left.

272
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:07,792
And stop. Sniper at your feet.

273
00:27:09,804 --> 00:27:11,236
What is it?

274
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:16,766
He had lunch here.

275
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:22,947
McDonald's quarter-pounder
with cheese.

276
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,849
Damn.

277
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:33,924
- Damn!
- That's four.

278
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:38,692
All right, you won this one.
Come on out!

279
00:27:40,564 --> 00:27:43,657
Soldier, how did you get
that close to me?

280
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:49,169
Sniper approached instructor by being
a sneaky bastard, Sergeant Major!

281
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:53,501
Do you know the fine for littering
in California, Chavez?

282
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,938
Yes, sir!

283
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:02,310
l saw you on the sniper course.
You looked good.

284
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:06,009
- Just about finished here, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

285
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:09,951
Looking forward to taking
some leave with your wife and kids?

286
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,823
- Don't have any wife or kids, sir.
- What do you have?

287
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,290
You don't call anybody often,
you don't write or receive many letters.

288
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:27,662
Who are you, sir, if l may ask?

289
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:32,399
Mr Clark and l are putting together
a mission. My team is a part of it.

290
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:37,509
You'll be gone up to six months,
after which, if you're not dead,

291
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,307
you'll have a choice
of assignments in Special Ops.

292
00:28:57,663 --> 00:29:02,566
...defusing an issue that was
snowballing into another scandal.

293
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:07,531
The New York Times is reporting that
you and Hardin were good friends?

294
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,834
No, not good friends.
We were lifelong friends.

295
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:15,875
l said that. l said that.

296
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:19,776
l told him to say that.

297
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:24,215
- What?
- l didn't say anything.

298
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:27,877
- But you were thinking something.
- No.

299
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:32,389
l was just distracted by the trouble
you were having with your ensemble.

300
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:38,760
Well, it's not every day
you have to look trustworthy.

301
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:42,264
- Who told who to say what?
- lt's not important.

302
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:46,703
- The President?
- Yeah.

303
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:51,069
Mom says she makes more money
than the President.

304
00:29:51,242 --> 00:29:54,210
She's probably right. Bye.

305
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:07,083
Thank you, Dr Ryan,
for the information you've shared with us.

306
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:11,454
- Thank you, Senator.
- We must help the Colombians

307
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:16,120
in their struggle to curtail
the drug cartels' activities.

308
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:22,598
However, l'm confused.
How do you see additional funds alone

309
00:30:22,768 --> 00:30:25,601
advancing this programme
from the failure that it is?

310
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:30,070
- You see what l'm getting at?
- No, l'm afraid l don't.

311
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:33,641
You said this effort would be
totally benign on our part.

312
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,838
The finding clearly states our assistance
is limited to supply and advice only.

313
00:30:39,016 --> 00:30:40,415
l've read that.

314
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:45,384
l've also read a similar finding
written 35 years ago

315
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:49,651
regarding a little-thought-of
sliver of jungle in south-east Asia.

316
00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:56,023
Sorry, you're comparing our request
for anti-drug funds to Vietnam?

317
00:30:56,197 --> 00:31:00,188
l'm comparing it to every time
a committee such as this is asked

318
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:04,804
to render judgement
based on less than all the facts.

319
00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:10,706
l'm afraid l don't know
what to say to that.

320
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:14,073
You could assure us
we've been given all the facts.

321
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:16,076
l thought l had.

322
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:21,651
You could further assure us, then,
that this increase in funds

323
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:25,219
will not be used for
any covert military action.

324
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:29,253
l don't know how you're getting to this.

325
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:32,588
Long experience, sir.

326
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:34,456
No troops, then?

327
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:40,499
l enunciate that clearly because
l don't want there to be any mistake.

328
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,192
No troops.

329
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:46,103
You could say l have your word on that?

330
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:48,833
You could indeed, because you do.

331
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:11,016
Listen up! Dog tags...
Take them off, pass them forward.

332
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:16,893
Check your pockets for anything
that can be used for identification.

333
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,170
We're feet dry.

334
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:43,382
Landing zone in sight. Get ready.

335
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:46,421
Good luck, boys. Go get 'em.

336
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,521
OK, let's take her down now.

337
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,951
Hey, Bob.

338
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:45,687
- How you doing?
- Good, sir.

339
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:48,822
Good to see you.

340
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:58,333
- Morning, Jack.
- Ryan! Come on in.

341
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:01,267
- Do you know everyone?
- Yes, yes.

342
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:04,635
- Coffee? Bagel?
- Coffee. Black, please.

343
00:35:05,843 --> 00:35:09,243
- How's the family?
- Good, sir.

344
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:12,778
- When do l meet the other Dr Ryan?
- She's dying to meet you, sir.

345
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:15,007
Good, good. Sit down.

346
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,987
- The cash is still there?
- Sir?

347
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,324
- ln Hardin's off-shore accounts.
- 650 million dollars.

348
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,657
- And change.
- And change...

349
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:36,268
- And we have the account numbers.
- Yes, sir.

350
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:41,736
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get it.

351
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:45,967
Let's turn this thing around.
650 million dollars and change.

352
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:49,670
lt's worth ten times that
in political capital.

353
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:54,776
What?

354
00:35:54,951 --> 00:36:02,413
Well... This connection between
Hardin and the cartels is a theory.

355
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:04,990
- Theory?
- A theory of mine.

356
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:09,027
- lt's a theory?
- Well, l know the money is there.

357
00:36:09,197 --> 00:36:13,860
But who exactly Hardin
was working for, l don't know.

358
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:19,630
l think we would have to establish
that before we could seize the money.

359
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:25,734
So go down there. Establish it.

360
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:28,378
- Go where?
- Colombia.

361
00:36:30,582 --> 00:36:32,880
Who, me?

362
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,187
l leave you alone for two weeks,
and you walk into a big bear trap.

363
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,348
l don't know what l was thinking.

364
00:36:43,526 --> 00:36:49,828
You were thinking about impressing
the President. You shouldn't do that.

365
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:53,297
- November.
- January.

366
00:36:53,468 --> 00:36:55,230
Of last year.

367
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:02,933
There's a guy down there,
at least used to be... Clark.

368
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:06,344
We go way back. Good man.

369
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:09,436
lf you hit a brick wall, look him up.

370
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:12,917
Admiral Greer?

371
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:17,111
- Chemotherapy.
- Oh, shit.

372
00:37:17,288 --> 00:37:19,654
Here we go again.

373
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:23,257
How's Ritter behaving?

374
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:27,122
Ritter's Ritter. He's leaving me alone.

375
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:31,494
Are you sure? Watch him like a hawk.

376
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,157
- How are you feeling today?
- OK.

377
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:39,863
We'll get you in a room, give you
warm blankets, get you lying down.

378
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,341
And then we'll get you back
to your room and get you comfortable...

379
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:41,321
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

380
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:47,325
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

381
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:51,524
Knife, this is Variable,
your signal is five by five, over.

382
00:38:54,972 --> 00:38:56,939
Clear.

383
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,718
The chicken is in the pot. Over.

384
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,559
- Cook it.
- Roger that.

385
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:47,907
Honey? l'm late.

386
00:39:49,384 --> 00:39:51,511
Have a good trip.

387
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:55,582
l'm not gonna say it.

388
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:57,724
Don't.

389
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:00,120
Be careful.

390
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:34,113
Local time is, well, actually, it's
the same as Washington, 11.16 a.m.

391
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:37,780
Temperature is
69 degrees Fahrenheit...

392
00:40:44,397 --> 00:40:46,660
Doctor Ryan!

393
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,600
DEA Special Agent Jean Fowler.
How you doing?

394
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:01,903
- First time in Bogota?
- Yeah.

395
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,640
Let's not stand here
and let someone take a shot at you.

396
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:26,699
- And these two?
- They're brothers.

397
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:33,831
Don't do that. Give Dr Ryan
a bit more air back here, please.

398
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:35,905
Bulletproof.

399
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:47,247
We don't have a picture.
Escobedo's intelligence officer.

400
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:50,412
We don't have a name either,
but we know he exists.

401
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:54,352
The invisible man?

402
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:57,750
Gently, gently. With your hands.

403
00:41:57,926 --> 00:42:01,088
Luis, put your hands together.

404
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:04,761
No, your hands together!

405
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:10,497
Luis, watch the canter!

406
00:42:11,605 --> 00:42:14,596
Yes, very good!

407
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,644
We lost another plane.

408
00:42:32,456 --> 00:42:36,414
- Who is doing this?
- lf l had to guess...

409
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:40,153
No, l did not ask you to guess.
l can guess.

410
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,025
Someone's been talking
to the drug police.

411
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:48,932
lmpossible. lf anyone spoke to the
police, l'd be the first to know.

412
00:42:49,104 --> 00:42:51,128
Ernesto!

413
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,867
ls one of the others trying to ruin me,
after what l did to the American?

414
00:42:58,044 --> 00:43:03,572
l guess that wasn't quite
the deterrent you thought it would be.

415
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,717
Find out who it is.

416
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,188
What do you make of this, Colonel?

417
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,488
An opportunity.

418
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:24,224
An opportunity, Sipo.

419
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:41,944
- Good afternoon.
- Messages, please?

420
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:48,219
- Dr Ryan?
- Clark? Sorry l'm late.

421
00:43:48,387 --> 00:43:50,650
l've got ten minutes.

422
00:43:53,024 --> 00:43:57,289
l'm positive Hardin was tied into
the cartels. lt's drug money.

423
00:43:57,461 --> 00:44:01,056
- But you can't prove it.
- So far.

424
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:06,166
- Mind if l ask you a question?
- No.

425
00:44:06,336 --> 00:44:12,570
Why are you telling me all this?
l've been out of the game for a long time.

426
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:19,875
l was told that you were wired in,
that you knew the town, the people.

427
00:44:20,046 --> 00:44:23,538
- That you were a player.
- Who told you that?

428
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:26,908
Jim Greer.

429
00:44:29,389 --> 00:44:30,720
How's he doing?

430
00:44:33,859 --> 00:44:36,259
He's not good.

431
00:44:37,695 --> 00:44:39,686
lt's cancer.

432
00:44:39,864 --> 00:44:41,888
Terminal.

433
00:44:44,102 --> 00:44:47,764
- He's a good man.
- The best.

434
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:56,908
You a coffee drinker, Dr Ryan?

435
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:04,047
- Yeah, l like coffee.
- Try the Lindo brand.

436
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:07,585
- Lindo?
- l think you'll like it.

437
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:17,127
Mr president, l've got some good news.

438
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:23,859
Hardin's partner here was someone
you may know of. Ernesto Escobedo.

439
00:45:24,036 --> 00:45:27,835
- Figures.
- ls this another of your theories?

440
00:45:28,538 --> 00:45:34,340
No, sir. We can call this one fact.
Escobedo, like every drug lord here,

441
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:39,880
also had legitimate businesses.
Hardin was doing business with them.

442
00:45:40,482 --> 00:45:45,350
lmporting among other things,
coffee, which means nothing,

443
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,015
but he was paying too much for
this coffee. 6,200 dollars a pound.

444
00:45:52,192 --> 00:45:55,719
- That's expensive coffee.
- l'd have to agree.

445
00:45:55,896 --> 00:45:58,729
This is good news. l think this does it.

446
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:02,801
Sir, l also have some other news
which is not so good.

447
00:46:03,703 --> 00:46:05,294
Oh, God...

448
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:11,567
The DEA feels that the government
here would want the seized funds.

449
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:16,610
- Or at least a large portion.
- This is our money.

450
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,579
- We found it.
- We could try telling them that.

451
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,151
Try? Tell them.
Or don't tell them, l don't care.

452
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:29,018
- Sir, with all due respect...
- This is our money, tell them that.

453
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,253
l wouldn't know what to say
or where to start, l'm not a negotiator.

454
00:46:34,428 --> 00:46:36,726
Don't you know someone there?

455
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:39,626
l went to school
with their Attorney General.

456
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:44,429
Jacobs will come down.
He'll negotiate. This is our money.

457
00:46:45,605 --> 00:46:47,162
Thank...

458
00:46:48,374 --> 00:46:50,171
Thank you.

459
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:56,279
l hate this job.

460
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,607
Eyes up!

461
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:19,950
Demo Team, up!

462
00:48:27,057 --> 00:48:29,321
Fire in the hole!

463
00:48:33,796 --> 00:48:37,664
Let's go, let's go!
Move out! Go, go, go!

464
00:48:58,951 --> 00:49:01,181
Whoever did this is dead.

465
00:49:02,787 --> 00:49:07,349
Whoever did this to me is dead!

466
00:49:07,525 --> 00:49:12,895
Do you hear me?
Are you listening to me?

467
00:49:27,175 --> 00:49:30,941
Mr Jacobs, could you sign these
before you leave?

468
00:49:32,146 --> 00:49:37,515
Moira... Why don't you
call in sick tomorrow?

469
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:41,016
And the next day. l won't tell anybody.

470
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,883
Even when you're not here,
there's plenty to do.

471
00:49:44,624 --> 00:49:48,252
- Your itinerary.
- You're arguing with me about this?

472
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:53,357
You work too hard. Adios.

473
00:50:31,964 --> 00:50:34,796
- Landa & Landa.
- Roberto Landa, please.

474
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:39,630
- This is Moira Wolfson.
- One moment, please.

475
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:43,432
l think he's on the factory floor.

476
00:50:48,811 --> 00:50:52,246
- Yes?
- A Moira Wolfson is calling.

477
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:58,678
l told her you were
on the factory floor. Go ahead.

478
00:50:58,853 --> 00:51:02,083
- Moira... !
- Hi.

479
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:07,318
You free the next couple of days?
l am.

480
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:12,589
My boss is leaving the country.

481
00:51:12,764 --> 00:51:17,861
- Can l call you later?
- All right, call me at home. Bye.

482
00:51:26,577 --> 00:51:32,673
Good afternoon.
Good news in the fight against drugs.

483
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:36,579
An investigation
by the Department of Justice

484
00:51:37,186 --> 00:51:41,747
has identified several
bank accounts, from Luxembourg

485
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:45,723
to the Cayman lslands,
used for laundering drug money

486
00:51:45,892 --> 00:51:51,194
on an unprecedented scale.
Working with five foreign governments,

487
00:51:51,365 --> 00:51:55,061
we have taken action
to seize those funds,

488
00:51:55,234 --> 00:51:58,829
which amount to
over 650 million dollars.

489
00:51:59,004 --> 00:52:00,596
Oh, shit.

490
00:52:00,772 --> 00:52:05,300
Also to seize 20 real estate
joint venture investments in the US

491
00:52:05,476 --> 00:52:11,278
which were the primary agencies
in the laundering operations.

492
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:15,145
You did say 650 million dollars?

493
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:19,152
That's right.
650 million dollars. And change.

494
00:52:19,322 --> 00:52:21,551
They're stealing my money!

495
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:27,217
- What's our take?
- lt's hard to say at the moment.

496
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:31,956
No, it isn't. You're stealing my money.
l made it, you're stealing it!

497
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:38,434
Mr president, can we speak with
FBl Director Jacobs about this?

498
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:42,405
- Jacobs is not available.
- Someone will die for this.

499
00:52:42,574 --> 00:52:48,478
He's personally involved in this
investigation and is pretty busy.

500
00:52:59,356 --> 00:53:03,553
This avenue has to be avoided.
They'll be coming from the airport.

501
00:53:03,726 --> 00:53:08,322
Up Avenida Aeropuerto El Dorado
all the way to Gran America.

502
00:53:08,496 --> 00:53:12,762
Santa Fe's our spot.
As much as l'd love to be here for this,

503
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:18,894
l have to take care of some business
in Washington, tying up loose ends.

504
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:31,078
Hello? Don't hang up, don't hang up.

505
00:53:33,217 --> 00:53:37,415
- Hello?
- The machine is still on, Moira.

506
00:54:09,982 --> 00:54:14,179
- Emil, good to see you.
- Good to see you, Andy.

507
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:18,812
- Agent Murray, Ambassador Ferris.
- Hi, good to see you.

508
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:23,619
- This will bring you up to date.
- All right, let's go.

509
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:41,502
- How's the food?
- lt's like Mexican food.

510
00:54:41,676 --> 00:54:44,906
- You hate Mexican food.
- l hate Mexican food.

511
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,476
- Hi.
- Hello.

512
00:55:23,646 --> 00:55:28,582
All my secretary knows about America
is what she reads in people magazine.

513
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,149
- How's the place?
- Come inside and find out.

514
00:55:40,226 --> 00:55:43,058
lt's...awful.

515
00:55:44,963 --> 00:55:46,726
lsn't it?

516
00:56:10,518 --> 00:56:12,816
So l take it you shouldn't
drink the water?

517
00:56:14,921 --> 00:56:18,379
They put water in your room,
but l'd stick to the bottled stuff.

518
00:57:09,068 --> 00:57:12,036
So, what do you brush your teeth with?

519
00:57:12,204 --> 00:57:16,606
Use the bottled water,
or you'll be in the can all your time here.

520
00:57:24,347 --> 00:57:28,909
The hold-up was
a government connection?

521
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,544
Hey, what the hell?

522
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:23,260
Back up! Back up!

523
00:58:29,537 --> 00:58:31,834
- Step on it!
- Stay down. Stay down.

524
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:43,611
Watch out!

525
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:48,444
Damn it! Back up!

526
00:58:52,122 --> 00:58:55,113
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Take it easy, Andy.

527
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:59,459
Got to keep moving. Go, Jack!

528
00:59:15,476 --> 00:59:16,806
lncoming!

529
00:59:56,911 --> 00:59:59,003
Dan!

530
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:31,570
Dan! Dan!

531
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:45,009
We can't stay here!

532
01:00:47,153 --> 01:00:49,552
The car! ls it running?

533
01:00:49,722 --> 01:00:51,689
lt's running!

534
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:56,794
The smoke will give us cover.
lt's our only chance. l got him.

535
01:00:56,961 --> 01:00:59,828
Make for the driver's side. Ready? Go!

536
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:13,808
- Get in!
- Go! Go!

537
01:02:17,396 --> 01:02:19,626
Housekeeping.

538
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,532
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

539
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:44,686
- You have a call for Dr Ryan?
- Just a moment.

540
01:02:44,853 --> 01:02:51,554
...in the streets of Bogota today.
Ten were killed and eight wounded.

541
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:55,559
Five of the dead
were security personnel...

542
01:02:55,729 --> 01:02:59,391
- Cathy?
- Don't tell me you're in this.

543
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:04,599
Right in the middle of it.
Honey, Dan was killed.

544
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:06,868
Dan Murray.

545
01:03:10,175 --> 01:03:13,372
He was 10 feet away.
There was nothing l could do.

546
01:03:15,846 --> 01:03:18,872
- l'm coming home.
- Thank God.

547
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:21,347
l love you.

548
01:03:26,355 --> 01:03:29,722
- l thought his going there was a secret.
- lt was.

549
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:34,556
- Then l don't get it. What happened?
- Nobody knows.

550
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:39,131
- How stupid are these people?
- They believe they can do anything.

551
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:42,325
You know what? They're wrong.

552
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:44,834
- Yes, sir.
- They're wrong.

553
01:03:46,806 --> 01:03:51,902
They've directly challenged the
sovereign power of the United States.

554
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:55,369
No more sending messages.

555
01:03:55,547 --> 01:03:59,642
He wants them to get the message
whether the phone rings or not.

556
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:04,880
- Those are his words?
- Do they sound like his words?

557
01:04:05,055 --> 01:04:09,354
He can't be clear
when clarity is what he wants to avoid.

558
01:04:09,525 --> 01:04:12,585
What he means is the gloves come off.

559
01:04:30,175 --> 01:04:35,204
l'm telling you, l had nothing to do with it.

560
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:38,612
l wish l had done it,
they deserved it. But it wasn't me.

561
01:04:38,784 --> 01:04:41,980
Who did then?

562
01:04:42,153 --> 01:04:46,089
You know, you have no answers.

563
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:51,158
ls this the way it was with Castro?
No answers?

564
01:04:51,328 --> 01:04:54,319
- You don't want to hear an answer.
- Yes, l do.

565
01:04:56,766 --> 01:05:00,532
lt was done to look like you did it.
By one of the others.

566
01:05:00,703 --> 01:05:04,900
As you suspected.
lt's always a friend who hates you most.

567
01:05:05,073 --> 01:05:07,007
Give me the phone.

568
01:05:14,147 --> 01:05:16,547
- Rojas.
- Did you do this thing?

569
01:05:16,716 --> 01:05:22,711
Did l do this thing? Are you calling
to ask me if l did this thing?

570
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:26,517
You don't consult with us.
You put us in danger.

571
01:05:27,893 --> 01:05:31,851
And now you want me to believe
it wasn't you?

572
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,620
lt wasn't, Enrique.

573
01:05:33,798 --> 01:05:37,164
The Americans will
retaliate against us all.

574
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:40,599
l swear l had nothing to do with it.

575
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,830
Why do you expect me
to listen to these lies?

576
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,532
- Goodbye, Ernesto.
- No, no, no!

577
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:50,705
Don't hang up.
We must have a meeting.

578
01:05:50,878 --> 01:05:53,813
- When?
- As soon as possible.

579
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:02,451
Tomorrow night. l am not
telling you, l am asking you!

580
01:06:02,621 --> 01:06:07,523
- May we meet tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

581
01:06:37,918 --> 01:06:39,885
- He's scared.
- He should be.

582
01:06:40,053 --> 01:06:42,817
l don't know what you said,
but it was right.

583
01:08:16,035 --> 01:08:17,559
Strange, don't you think?

584
01:08:17,737 --> 01:08:21,694
Jacobs and his secretary
getting killed on the same day.

585
01:08:23,575 --> 01:08:27,977
lt wasn't his secretary.
He was a member of the security.

586
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,669
Who?

587
01:08:31,515 --> 01:08:36,315
- l don't remember his name.
- l'm talking about Moira.

588
01:08:37,086 --> 01:08:39,646
Moira, remember? Jacobs' secretary.

589
01:08:39,821 --> 01:08:43,587
l know Moira, honey.
What are you talking about?

590
01:08:48,963 --> 01:08:52,524
- She said he was a Latin Jack Ryan.
- He was.

591
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:57,068
- That's what she called him.
- The point is, he's Latin.

592
01:08:57,237 --> 01:09:02,640
Which connects her death and Jacobs'
beyond the fact they worked together.

593
01:09:02,808 --> 01:09:06,676
You saw somebody you think
is responsible for both killings?

594
01:09:09,715 --> 01:09:11,306
She did.

595
01:09:13,451 --> 01:09:15,646
She did.

596
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:25,051
l saw him from a distance. From behind.

597
01:09:25,228 --> 01:09:29,754
- Medium height, medium build, etc?
- Mind if l look at these?

598
01:09:30,431 --> 01:09:34,196
ls that what the people
from the cabin said?

599
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:38,902
Did you check out
these calls to Venezuela?

600
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:43,607
Disconnected.

601
01:09:46,512 --> 01:09:49,743
- So you have no leads?
- Oh, l have a lot.

602
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:54,409
A fictitious name on a register.
A stolen phoned-in credit card number.

603
01:09:54,586 --> 01:09:59,682
Two eyewitnesses, one of whom
saw a guy, but didn't see him...

604
01:09:59,857 --> 01:10:02,792
Excuse me,
could you play that again?

605
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,984
Yes, sir.

606
01:10:05,161 --> 01:10:07,390
The machine is still on, Moira.

607
01:10:07,563 --> 01:10:10,362
You have a recording of the killer's voice.

608
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,597
Maybe.

609
01:10:16,704 --> 01:10:21,937
Jack. l think we've got something.
This is from the answering machine.

610
01:10:22,109 --> 01:10:26,636
And this was recorded yesterday.
l'll play it for you.

611
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:28,737
OK.

612
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:33,885
The machine is still on, Moira.

613
01:10:34,053 --> 01:10:36,213
- All right.
- And...

614
01:10:36,387 --> 01:10:41,324
He's scared. l don't know
what you said to him, but it was right.

615
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:44,255
Kurt, run a match on that.

616
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:53,094
He's Cuban. 35-45.

617
01:10:53,269 --> 01:10:57,729
Educated in the United States.
Eastern United States.

618
01:10:58,773 --> 01:11:01,640
- lt's the same voice.
- You're sure?

619
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:03,333
- Yeah.
- How sure?

620
01:11:09,215 --> 01:11:10,876
90 per cent.

621
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:15,480
- l need a name.
- Could be hundreds of thousands...

622
01:11:15,655 --> 01:11:19,215
l know. l need a name,
and l need it quick.

623
01:11:37,474 --> 01:11:39,998
300 is topside.

624
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:26,744
Target is set.

625
01:12:29,084 --> 01:12:32,246
- Hector!
- Enrique!

626
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,611
Good to see you!

627
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:38,155
- lt was not easy.
- Enrique, how are you?

628
01:12:38,725 --> 01:12:42,593
Rojas, Diaz...

629
01:12:45,664 --> 01:12:47,632
What the hell is this?

630
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,701
What the hell is this?

631
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:55,439
My new toy. Like it?

632
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,970
You see this?

633
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:03,002
That's your new target,
unless it's not big enough.

634
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:11,477
Variable, this is Easy Rhino.
Do you copy? Over.

635
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,718
Loud and clear, Easy Rhino.

636
01:13:14,889 --> 01:13:18,824
- Do we have a gig?
- That's a rog.

637
01:13:24,664 --> 01:13:26,029
Target is lit.

638
01:13:27,834 --> 01:13:29,461
Start the music.

639
01:13:30,803 --> 01:13:32,360
lnto attack.

640
01:13:33,805 --> 01:13:38,639
Target is acquired and lit.
Coming down.

641
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:50,110
Fernandez, Vega...
Looks like a full house.

642
01:13:59,194 --> 01:14:02,060
Damn it! Why doesn't he fix this road?

643
01:14:03,164 --> 01:14:06,394
Shit! Thought we had everybody.

644
01:14:07,267 --> 01:14:09,565
Keep the target painted.

645
01:14:38,093 --> 01:14:39,856
Sir?

646
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,663
Boom.

647
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:57,072
Mother of God!

648
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,075
Circular error probability zero.

649
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:07,979
lmpact with high order detonation.
Have a nice day.

650
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:18,288
The man is completely out of control.
He has no...

651
01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:24,326
The man is completely out of control...

652
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:30,401
His name is Cortez, Felix Cortez.

653
01:15:30,939 --> 01:15:35,102
A colonel in Cuba's intelligence
service until a few years ago.

654
01:15:35,275 --> 01:15:40,211
Turned up working for the Macheteros
terrorist group in Puerto Rico.

655
01:15:40,379 --> 01:15:46,579
Disappeared again. Yesterday we taped
him talking to a Cali cartel subject.

656
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:51,313
l'll fax what l've got.
lf he shows, pick him up, OK?

657
01:15:51,489 --> 01:15:55,254
- You know l can't do that.
- l mean the police.

658
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:59,590
The Colombian police don't pick up
members of the cartel.

659
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:03,288
Unless they've got a death wish.
You've been down here.

660
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,263
Wait a minute.

661
01:16:06,768 --> 01:16:10,067
Oh Jesus...
Jack, something's happened here.

662
01:16:23,216 --> 01:16:27,914
At least 30 people were killed,
including women and children.

663
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:32,524
The bomb exploded in a car
belonging to a Rojas associate.

664
01:16:32,691 --> 01:16:36,557
- Jack...?
- Yeah, are you watching this?

665
01:16:36,728 --> 01:16:39,219
- Did this just happen?
- Just now.

666
01:16:42,866 --> 01:16:47,200
Send me all the stuff,
and we'll put a tail on him if we spot him.

667
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,501
lf he's still alive. l've got to go.

668
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,602
- A surgical strike, you said.
- lt was perfect.

669
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,943
- That's a dead kid. On NBC.
- Take the gloves off, you said.

670
01:17:03,117 --> 01:17:06,779
- l know what l said.
- A bit late to change your mind.

671
01:17:06,953 --> 01:17:09,217
l'm not changing my mind.

672
01:17:09,856 --> 01:17:13,689
l hadn't counted on
this kind of collateral damage.

673
01:17:15,128 --> 01:17:18,153
- Neither had he.
- lt will be interpreted as l said.

674
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:22,061
Rivalry that ended
in the blast of a car bomb.

675
01:17:22,234 --> 01:17:23,564
Goodnight.

676
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:43,112
- Morning, Rose. Finish the report?
- Hot off the press.

677
01:17:45,986 --> 01:17:50,013
Could any of the bombing victims'
names be aliases?

678
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:55,051
No. All lDs have been confirmed.
Who are you hoping for?

679
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:58,924
lf he's not here, he's not here.
Cortez. He's not here.

680
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:05,325
- Why was Operations copied on this?
- Ritter requested it.

681
01:18:06,538 --> 01:18:09,506
Ritter, huh? You look very nice today.

682
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:12,337
Thank you.

683
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:27,777
Car bomb...

684
01:18:37,497 --> 01:18:40,090
What happens
when a car bomb goes off?

685
01:18:40,265 --> 01:18:44,326
- lt explodes.
- lt blows up and out?

686
01:18:44,503 --> 01:18:46,902
And a missile?

687
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:52,833
- This deeper crater?
- That's characteristic.

688
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:55,205
Bring up the satellite photo.

689
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:05,008
HMX and TNT.

690
01:19:05,187 --> 01:19:08,713
When you mix it 70/30,
you get a compound called Octol.

691
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:11,984
Put enough explosives in a car,
you get a crater that big.

692
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:16,926
- lt's very stable. Very expensive.
- Would it still be in the crater?

693
01:19:17,097 --> 01:19:20,224
- Very violent.
- There would be pieces all around.

694
01:19:20,901 --> 01:19:27,806
- Where is Octol made?
- Lots of places. Europe. The US.

695
01:19:27,973 --> 01:19:32,740
But nobody uses it.
Nobody can afford it except the military.

696
01:19:32,911 --> 01:19:38,177
An aerial bomb would do that.
But that's not an aerial bomb.

697
01:19:38,349 --> 01:19:39,680
- lt's not?
- No.

698
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:43,478
There is also
a cellulose residue on everything.

699
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:46,849
There should be shrapnel.
Here and here.

700
01:19:47,023 --> 01:19:50,685
- But there isn't.
- No bomb fragments.

701
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:38,966
''Cellulose encased laser-guided bomb''...

702
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:42,627
Paper.

703
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:48,737
The Americans are here.

704
01:21:19,602 --> 01:21:23,799
We have something in common.
Neither of us can implement policy

705
01:21:23,972 --> 01:21:28,033
without at least tacit authorisation
from our employer.

706
01:21:28,209 --> 01:21:33,076
We also both know there are
American troops in Colombia

707
01:21:33,246 --> 01:21:35,840
fighting an illegal war.

708
01:21:37,316 --> 01:21:42,447
l will be at Hotel paloma de Oro
in panama City on Wednesday.

709
01:21:42,622 --> 01:21:44,248
l suggest we meet.

710
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:40,628
- Six, this is point. Over.
- Six here.

711
01:22:41,972 --> 01:22:49,467
The stuff's here, a lot of it.
l'm also looking at 100-1 50 men, armed,

712
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:52,442
waiting around for something. Over.

713
01:22:52,614 --> 01:22:55,139
Colombian Army? Over.

714
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,119
Negative. They look like mercenaries.

715
01:23:02,288 --> 01:23:05,780
All right. Get back here. Abort mission.

716
01:23:05,959 --> 01:23:08,688
l say again, abort mission. Out.

717
01:23:10,563 --> 01:23:13,224
150 armed men, huh?

718
01:23:34,183 --> 01:23:35,877
Raise your arms, please.

719
01:23:51,631 --> 01:23:55,567
Thank you for responding to my note.
And so promptly.

720
01:23:56,568 --> 01:24:00,436
l had nothing to do
with the death of Mr Jacobs.

721
01:24:00,605 --> 01:24:05,064
lt was an act of madness. But
a typical one from the men l work for.

722
01:24:06,844 --> 01:24:10,746
- What do you want?
- Same as you. Mineral water.

723
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:16,640
Do we agree that as long as Americans
demand drugs, they will be supplied?

724
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:19,412
l don't want to be here
longer than l have to.

725
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:23,183
You mentioned a gang war.
What does that mean?

726
01:24:23,357 --> 01:24:27,919
- That we want the same thing.
- Really?

727
01:24:28,094 --> 01:24:33,031
So far you've done all the work.
You've taken care of the little fish.

728
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,258
l will take care of the one that got away.

729
01:24:36,002 --> 01:24:40,995
Once Escobedo is gone,
l will be in a position to help you.

730
01:24:41,173 --> 01:24:45,370
- You want to help me?
- Your country. Your people.

731
01:24:45,543 --> 01:24:50,275
By restructuring the drug trade.
By regulating it.

732
01:24:51,648 --> 01:24:57,177
What would you say if l promised you
l'd halve cocaine shipments to the US?

733
01:24:58,822 --> 01:25:03,052
l'd say you'd been using
too much of your product.

734
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:06,786
l can also give you regular quotas
on major arrests

735
01:25:06,961 --> 01:25:10,157
that your police can take credit for.

736
01:25:10,331 --> 01:25:14,028
lmagine. Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions.

737
01:25:14,201 --> 01:25:18,933
No more senseless violence.
You'll have your victory.

738
01:25:23,343 --> 01:25:24,935
ln return for what?

739
01:25:26,244 --> 01:25:30,145
l also need a victory,
to establish my position

740
01:25:30,314 --> 01:25:34,978
with what is left of the cartel,
so l can help you.

741
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:40,588
l need to defeat those soldiers
blowing up everything they see.

742
01:25:40,757 --> 01:25:46,525
Give me maps of their locations.
Cut off their communications.

743
01:25:53,568 --> 01:25:59,302
DEA's sending the audio
surveillance tape. l haven't got it yet.

744
01:26:01,941 --> 01:26:07,277
You know what you think about...
when you're lying here?

745
01:26:08,647 --> 01:26:11,810
You know you're gonna die,
and you think...

746
01:26:13,786 --> 01:26:18,518
...that's all right. You lived a long time.

747
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:20,782
You had a family that loved you.

748
01:26:21,191 --> 01:26:25,490
You had a job that you thought
made a difference.

749
01:26:26,396 --> 01:26:29,194
That you thought was honourable.

750
01:26:30,166 --> 01:26:32,964
And then you see this.

751
01:26:36,971 --> 01:26:40,839
l'm afraid if l dig any deeper...

752
01:26:41,008 --> 01:26:43,602
...no one's gonna like what l find.

753
01:26:49,449 --> 01:26:52,781
You took an oath...

754
01:26:52,951 --> 01:26:55,044
...if you recall...

755
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:01,416
...when you first came to work for me.

756
01:27:01,593 --> 01:27:07,325
And l don't mean to the National
Security Advisor of the United States,

757
01:27:08,532 --> 01:27:11,797
l mean to his boss.

758
01:27:11,968 --> 01:27:14,458
And l don't mean the President.

759
01:27:16,104 --> 01:27:19,403
You gave your word to...

760
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:23,602
...his boss.

761
01:27:23,777 --> 01:27:26,371
You gave your word...

762
01:27:26,547 --> 01:27:31,006
...to the people of the United States.

763
01:27:32,286 --> 01:27:35,083
Your word is who you are.

764
01:27:40,358 --> 01:27:41,882
What else have you got there?

765
01:27:48,165 --> 01:27:51,225
l brought you some new magazines.

766
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:06,577
The situation in East Timor seems
to have stabilised during the day.

767
01:28:06,747 --> 01:28:10,547
- ls that it?
- Except for the other thing.

768
01:28:12,018 --> 01:28:15,078
We've accomplished a lot,
we're seeing tangible results.

769
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:18,985
Drug shipments are down.
The price on the street is rising.

770
01:28:19,158 --> 01:28:23,594
The administration is perceived
to be doing something right.

771
01:28:23,762 --> 01:28:26,730
What's the bad news?

772
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:34,131
l'm worried about the car bomb coming
so soon after Jacobs' assassination.

773
01:28:36,006 --> 01:28:38,736
Just the kind of thing reporters live for.

774
01:28:38,909 --> 01:28:43,037
- They'd love to make a connection.
- And you think they will?

775
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:48,609
l think it's time
the whole thing went away.

776
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:52,219
- lf that's what you think.
- l think so.

777
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:58,816
Then it should go away.
lt never happened.

778
01:29:00,327 --> 01:29:02,294
Yes, sir.

779
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:07,459
Well...it's possible.

780
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:12,797
lt would be easier if you told me whose
system you wanted me to break into.

781
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:14,939
- Morning, Dr Ryan.
- Morning.

782
01:29:36,491 --> 01:29:39,220
We're way beyond birthdays now.

783
01:29:40,194 --> 01:29:44,653
l'm gonna have to write
a special program here.

784
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:59,375
OK, sweetheart, let's get to work.

785
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:02,211
Fine, good.

786
01:30:03,647 --> 01:30:07,378
Yes... Here we go.

787
01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:07,691
Reciprocity. What's that?

788
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:23,447
l forgot to tell you, after you get the code,

789
01:31:23,615 --> 01:31:28,483
wait until he's off his system
before you log on. He will know.

790
01:31:28,653 --> 01:31:31,019
Jesus, Petey, it's too late.

791
01:31:31,188 --> 01:31:33,587
Oh, my God...

792
01:32:04,217 --> 01:32:05,877
Cutter...

793
01:32:20,563 --> 01:32:24,897
- Bob, Jack Ryan here.
- Good morning, Jack.

794
01:32:25,401 --> 01:32:29,427
Listen, maybe we got off to a bad start.

795
01:32:30,206 --> 01:32:34,732
lf we're gonna work together,
we should get to know each other.

796
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:39,073
Do you play tennis?
Tennis? Do you play tennis?

797
01:32:39,245 --> 01:32:43,648
- Yeah, l play tennis.
- How about we get together?

798
01:32:43,817 --> 01:32:47,115
Next week?
Maybe an hour before we start work?

799
01:32:54,259 --> 01:32:56,318
- Jack?
- Yeah.

800
01:32:56,994 --> 01:33:01,488
Computer theft is a serious crime.

801
01:33:04,701 --> 01:33:07,999
So are crimes against the Constitution.

802
01:33:09,606 --> 01:33:11,664
Son of a bitch!

803
01:33:23,551 --> 01:33:25,541
Son of a bitch!

804
01:33:29,722 --> 01:33:31,121
Come on, come on.

805
01:33:34,426 --> 01:33:36,087
Clark...

806
01:34:12,325 --> 01:34:13,986
You're going to jail, pal.

807
01:34:15,529 --> 01:34:19,259
What is that?
What do you think you have there?

808
01:34:19,431 --> 01:34:21,023
You broke the law.

809
01:34:22,233 --> 01:34:26,192
You are such a Boy Scout.

810
01:34:26,371 --> 01:34:29,772
Look at you.
You see everything in black and white.

811
01:34:29,941 --> 01:34:33,899
No, not black and white, Ritter.
Right and wrong!

812
01:34:34,076 --> 01:34:38,604
- You see! There you go again.
- Why was l kept out of it?

813
01:34:38,781 --> 01:34:42,045
You weren't, you're neck deep in it.
You went before Congress.

814
01:34:42,217 --> 01:34:45,084
You got the money for it.
You lied under oath...

815
01:34:45,253 --> 01:34:50,053
- l never lied to Congress!
- You told them no troops.

816
01:34:50,224 --> 01:34:53,625
- There are troops!
- You know l didn't know that.

817
01:34:53,794 --> 01:34:59,459
No. l have no recollection of that.
That's the term you have to learn.

818
01:34:59,632 --> 01:35:03,658
- Who authorised this?
- Sure, they'll ask you that.

819
01:35:03,836 --> 01:35:08,568
- Who authorised this?
- l have no recollection...Senator.

820
01:35:13,711 --> 01:35:18,079
l did not sign up for somebody's
bullshit political agenda.

821
01:35:18,248 --> 01:35:22,207
Who authorised this? Cutter?

822
01:35:22,385 --> 01:35:25,876
Cutter couldn't tie his shoes
without permission.

823
01:35:30,326 --> 01:35:33,783
- lf l go down, you're going with me.
- Wrong again.

824
01:35:33,962 --> 01:35:37,488
l have an autographed
''Get Out of Jail Free'' card.

825
01:35:39,466 --> 01:35:43,765
''The President authorises
the Deputy Director ClA, Robert Ritter,

826
01:35:43,936 --> 01:35:49,374
''to conduct Operation Reciprocity
including all support necessary.

827
01:35:49,542 --> 01:35:56,104
''This operation is deemed important
to the national security of the US.''

828
01:35:58,149 --> 01:36:02,642
You don't have one of these,
do you, Jack?

829
01:36:11,793 --> 01:36:16,820
Grey! The world's grey, Jack!

830
01:36:49,192 --> 01:36:54,287
You have any idea how l'm gonna
get out of this mess?

831
01:36:54,463 --> 01:36:57,557
Absolutely none.

832
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:10,073
Yeah. This is he.

833
01:37:14,046 --> 01:37:15,742
When?

834
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:22,614
James?

835
01:37:24,156 --> 01:37:26,385
Thank you.

836
01:37:26,557 --> 01:37:34,190
Admiral James Greer devoted his life
to his country and his family.

837
01:37:34,364 --> 01:37:38,494
Giving selflessly
of both his wisdom and his love.

838
01:37:39,735 --> 01:37:43,569
He served his country
for more than 50 years.

839
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:48,937
Enlisting in the Navy at 17.
Graduating from the Academy.

840
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:52,704
Achieving three stars for his flag.

841
01:37:52,879 --> 01:37:56,610
He lived through tumultuous events
in his country's life.

842
01:37:56,783 --> 01:38:01,185
He participated in them.
He made them clearer to the rest of us,

843
01:38:01,354 --> 01:38:07,781
with his knowledge, his honesty,
his integrity and his courage.

844
01:38:16,934 --> 01:38:18,697
l can't see them, but l know they're there.

845
01:38:19,535 --> 01:38:22,868
Five kilometres due east
from your position.

846
01:38:27,776 --> 01:38:31,303
Keep pushing forward. We'll trap them.

847
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,777
Never was he deluded
into thinking that one man...

848
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:38,183
...could solve the ills of the world.

849
01:38:38,351 --> 01:38:43,050
Always the soldier, on the battlefields
of the South Pacific, Korea...

850
01:38:43,223 --> 01:38:47,886
...Vietnam and Washington,
he fought as part of a unit...

851
01:38:48,527 --> 01:38:50,391
... to preserve the ideals...

852
01:38:50,561 --> 01:38:51,960
Knife, this is Variable.

853
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:54,030
...of his nation.

854
01:38:54,198 --> 01:38:57,167
Knife! This is Variable. Over.

855
01:38:58,135 --> 01:39:02,231
To the refuge of the earth,
we entrust our friend's body.

856
01:39:02,706 --> 01:39:07,108
To the protection of our God
in Heaven, we entrust his soul.

857
01:39:07,276 --> 01:39:11,837
To ourselves, we entrust his spirit...

858
01:39:12,013 --> 01:39:15,676
...and the principles he lived by.

859
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:17,784
We're gonna miss you, James.

860
01:39:40,605 --> 01:39:42,265
Variable, this is Knife, over.

861
01:39:43,607 --> 01:39:46,700
Variable, this is Knife, over.

862
01:39:46,876 --> 01:39:50,368
Variable, l am not receiving.
We are under heavy attack.

863
01:39:50,547 --> 01:39:53,811
Need air support, over.

864
01:40:15,167 --> 01:40:18,863
Variable, this is Knife, over! Switch!

865
01:40:51,432 --> 01:40:55,424
Variable, this is Knife!
Where the hell are you?!

866
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:21,322
On behalf of a grateful nation,
our condolences.

867
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:24,687
- He was a very great patriot.
- Thank you.

868
01:42:03,426 --> 01:42:07,759
- Hello?
- Jean Fowler for Dr Jack Ryan.

869
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:11,366
Jack? You've got to hear this.

870
01:42:11,533 --> 01:42:13,966
Picked it up this morning.

871
01:42:14,135 --> 01:42:20,095
Variable, this is Knife.
We are under attack, need air support.

872
01:42:20,273 --> 01:42:23,470
Variable, this is Knife,
where the hell are you?

873
01:42:24,144 --> 01:42:27,170
Jack, what do you want me
to do with this?

874
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:32,742
Make a copy, Jean. Make ten copies.

875
01:42:32,917 --> 01:42:35,852
Get them to me
as quick as you can. Thanks.

876
01:42:38,488 --> 01:42:42,822
Jesus. They're going to leave
those guys down there.

877
01:43:26,163 --> 01:43:31,998
He's on American 915.
He'll be in Bogota 7.50 p.m.

878
01:43:44,312 --> 01:43:46,212
-Yeah?
- lt's Ritter.

879
01:43:46,381 --> 01:43:50,180
- Where the fuck have you been?
- We have a problem.

880
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:53,080
We've got a disaster!
l can't get through to my men.

881
01:43:53,687 --> 01:43:56,985
We had to shut down the satellite link.

882
01:43:58,824 --> 01:44:01,190
- Clark?
- You had to what?

883
01:44:03,094 --> 01:44:09,055
lt's Ryan. He found out everything.
He threatened to tell Congress

884
01:44:09,366 --> 01:44:12,301
if we didn't shut down the operation.

885
01:44:12,469 --> 01:44:17,997
OK. lt's shut down. Just give me
some air and my men are out of there.

886
01:44:19,342 --> 01:44:26,179
Clark, maybe you're not hearing me.
There is no air. We are shut down.

887
01:44:27,481 --> 01:44:31,042
l'm on a plane. l'm gonna kill him.

888
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,684
Ritter?

889
01:44:36,323 --> 01:44:38,757
He's coming to you.

890
01:44:39,192 --> 01:44:42,889
American Airlines at 19.50
with no security.

891
01:44:43,062 --> 01:44:47,624
- Who is this?
- National Security Advisor Cutter.

892
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:50,359
Once Ryan's gone, we're back on line.

893
01:44:50,903 --> 01:44:52,733
You understand?

894
01:44:54,172 --> 01:44:56,299
Yes, sir.

895
01:46:17,342 --> 01:46:18,707
Clark...

896
01:46:18,877 --> 01:46:20,606
- Jesus!
- Get in the van.

897
01:46:20,779 --> 01:46:25,340
- Don't do this, l came to find you.
- You found me. Get in.

898
01:46:29,719 --> 01:46:31,414
Behind the wheel.

899
01:46:32,922 --> 01:46:34,389
Clark...

900
01:46:35,858 --> 01:46:37,586
Drive.

901
01:47:05,583 --> 01:47:08,177
- Ritter.
- Ryan's dead.

902
01:47:10,254 --> 01:47:12,312
How?

903
01:47:12,489 --> 01:47:15,616
l killed him. Turn the satellite back on.

904
01:47:19,128 --> 01:47:23,894
You said get rid of Ryan
and we're back in business, right?

905
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:51,111
What the hell are you doing here?

906
01:47:53,524 --> 01:47:56,687
l came to help you get those guys out.

907
01:47:58,329 --> 01:48:00,921
What can you do to help me?

908
01:48:06,602 --> 01:48:09,570
What do you need?

909
01:48:09,737 --> 01:48:11,103
A helicopter.

910
01:48:13,374 --> 01:48:15,342
A helicopter.

911
01:48:24,517 --> 01:48:25,848
No, thank you.

912
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:31,880
- ls this ''Happy Hour''?
- lt's always ''Happy Hour''.

913
01:48:32,056 --> 01:48:35,719
- Your pilot owns this joint?
- He lives here.

914
01:48:41,565 --> 01:48:42,896
Here he is.

915
01:48:54,276 --> 01:48:58,871
Morning. l'm here to rent the Huey.

916
01:48:59,046 --> 01:49:03,176
Sorry, we don't rent it any more.
But it is for sale.

917
01:49:04,851 --> 01:49:06,716
How much is it?

918
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:10,520
Two million dollars.

919
01:49:16,327 --> 01:49:18,955
My pilot and l would
have to do a test flight.

920
01:49:19,131 --> 01:49:22,099
Of course.
You just have to leave a deposit.

921
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,831
How much is that?

922
01:49:26,002 --> 01:49:27,492
Two million dollars.

923
01:49:33,242 --> 01:49:36,177
Would you take a company cheque?

924
01:49:43,117 --> 01:49:44,607
Yes.

925
01:49:52,558 --> 01:49:56,255
- Here we go.
- Big son of a bitch, ain't she?

926
01:49:58,496 --> 01:50:02,761
- Do you have any time in this type?
- Nine o'clock.

927
01:50:12,842 --> 01:50:19,007
- Get out of my chopper.
- No. My chopper. Let's go.

928
01:50:39,531 --> 01:50:42,659
Their last communication put them here.

929
01:50:43,936 --> 01:50:48,998
The closest extraction point is here.
ln this gorge.

930
01:50:49,906 --> 01:50:51,636
l got it.

931
01:51:11,593 --> 01:51:14,925
- ls that a body down there?
- Yes.

932
01:51:16,964 --> 01:51:20,490
- One of ours?
- One of mine.

933
01:51:24,036 --> 01:51:28,268
Find a place to set her down.
We'll look for the others.

934
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:16,779
Nowhere to run to. No place to hide.

935
01:52:16,948 --> 01:52:22,647
Blood trails everywhere.
They all lead to the river.

936
01:52:35,263 --> 01:52:39,392
These are the falls we saw from the air.

937
01:52:39,567 --> 01:52:43,162
The bodies should be
about 50 metres down.

938
01:52:55,481 --> 01:53:00,417
You left us!
You left us with no support at all!

939
01:53:00,586 --> 01:53:04,885
You left us out to dry!
You son of a bitch!

940
01:53:07,657 --> 01:53:11,092
- lt's not his fault.
- Whose fault is it?

941
01:53:13,095 --> 01:53:14,426
lt's my fault.

942
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:22,060
lt's my fault.

943
01:53:34,148 --> 01:53:38,083
l was on point
when the last attack came.

944
01:53:39,084 --> 01:53:41,211
Over a mile away.

945
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:44,751
By the time l got back it was over.

946
01:53:46,158 --> 01:53:49,320
They were taken to Captain Rosso.

947
01:53:50,493 --> 01:53:53,224
The others?

948
01:53:53,397 --> 01:53:55,091
l buried them.

949
01:54:04,206 --> 01:54:06,071
Road to the town.

950
01:54:06,241 --> 01:54:09,607
They loaded the prisoners here.
Blood everywhere.

951
01:54:09,777 --> 01:54:13,645
- God knows where they are now.
- Escobedo knows.

952
01:54:13,815 --> 01:54:17,113
What are you going to do?
Knock on his door?

953
01:54:23,756 --> 01:54:28,715
Morning. l'd like to see Ernesto
Escobedo. l don't have an appointment.

954
01:54:42,271 --> 01:54:44,102
OK.

955
01:54:46,175 --> 01:54:48,040
Hands up.

956
01:54:48,743 --> 01:54:50,904
Hands up!

957
01:54:52,246 --> 01:54:54,180
Wallet.

958
01:54:58,985 --> 01:55:00,613
lt's a tape recorder.

959
01:55:05,358 --> 01:55:07,416
He's in.

960
01:55:10,829 --> 01:55:13,559
Bird, this is Variable, over.

961
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:19,099
Bird, this is Variable, over.

962
01:55:35,483 --> 01:55:39,078
Dr Ryan... Come in.

963
01:55:53,065 --> 01:55:56,761
Sit down. What can l do for you?

964
01:55:58,169 --> 01:56:04,198
l didn't know who else to turn to.
l have a problem.

965
01:56:05,108 --> 01:56:08,805
An associate of mine,
a coffee buyer and his assistant

966
01:56:08,978 --> 01:56:11,776
were on a business trip in this area.

967
01:56:11,947 --> 01:56:15,678
They disappeared yesterday.
l'm very concerned.

968
01:56:15,852 --> 01:56:18,149
Coffee buyer?

969
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,982
lt's very important to me to find them.

970
01:56:21,156 --> 01:56:24,454
Coffee buying is becoming
a dangerous business.

971
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,924
Yes. Well, it was for Peter Hardin.

972
01:56:33,399 --> 01:56:37,028
- Who?
- He was a client of Lindo Coffee.

973
01:56:37,202 --> 01:56:42,162
- Lindo Coffee has many clients.
- You must have heard of this one.

974
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:45,901
He owed your company
a great deal of money.

975
01:56:46,076 --> 01:56:50,206
l'll have to talk to Accounting about that.

976
01:56:51,548 --> 01:56:53,913
650 million dollars.

977
01:56:57,053 --> 01:56:59,283
And change.

978
01:57:00,723 --> 01:57:05,989
Are you offering to help me
with the collection of an unpaid debt?

979
01:57:06,161 --> 01:57:09,061
- No.
- What are you offering?

980
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:15,297
A trade. Felix Cortez has sold you out.

981
01:57:15,468 --> 01:57:19,733
He will murder you and your family,
and take over the cartel.

982
01:57:19,905 --> 01:57:21,770
Where's my tape recorder?

983
01:57:28,379 --> 01:57:30,176
Play the tape.

984
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:05,704
Let's move.

985
01:58:35,636 --> 01:58:39,037
l'd like you to meet
my new friend, Dr Ryan.

986
01:58:39,206 --> 01:58:42,437
A doctor? Why? ls somebody sick?

987
01:58:56,054 --> 01:58:57,521
What does he want?

988
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:03,216
The safe return of his associates.

989
01:59:03,394 --> 01:59:07,591
And what does he offer us in return?

990
01:59:07,764 --> 01:59:10,095
You.

991
01:59:16,037 --> 01:59:20,201
Whatever this man has told you is a lie.
He lies for a living.

992
01:59:20,375 --> 01:59:24,936
He's in the intelligence business.
You're in the intelligence business!

993
01:59:31,517 --> 01:59:34,349
You've taken care of the little fish.

994
01:59:34,519 --> 01:59:36,749
l'll take care of the one that got away.

995
01:59:37,289 --> 01:59:42,123
Once Escobedo is gone,
l'll be in a position to help you.

996
01:59:42,293 --> 01:59:46,423
So, the question is...

997
01:59:47,731 --> 01:59:50,062
...what am l supposed to do with you?

998
01:59:53,670 --> 01:59:56,433
l guess l'm supposed to
kill you with this bat!

999
02:00:05,347 --> 02:00:07,279
Get up.

1000
02:00:11,985 --> 02:00:16,354
Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions, no more violence...

1001
02:00:16,522 --> 02:00:18,615
You'll have your victory.

1002
02:00:20,359 --> 02:00:23,055
ln return for what?

1003
02:01:02,661 --> 02:01:04,595
- Where are they?
- They're here.

1004
02:01:07,432 --> 02:01:11,368
The American killed Ernesto! Let's go!

1005
02:01:59,543 --> 02:02:01,773
Bird to Variable. Over.

1006
02:02:15,224 --> 02:02:19,922
Bird, this is Variable.
Where the hell are you?

1007
02:02:20,094 --> 02:02:23,689
l'm cruising about five klicks
south of the village.

1008
02:02:24,464 --> 02:02:29,163
- Stay there. l'll get back to you.
- Roger that.

1009
02:02:40,945 --> 02:02:43,379
- No one.
- The prisoners!

1010
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:32,851
Come on, guys. Let's go, son.

1011
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:36,356
We're going home, boys.

1012
02:04:50,122 --> 02:04:52,681
Pick us up at the Lindo Coffee factory.

1013
02:06:29,273 --> 02:06:33,266
Not only can l expose you
to the press, so can the soldiers.

1014
02:06:33,443 --> 02:06:40,041
Do you want to take your chances
with the courts and the reporters?

1015
02:06:40,215 --> 02:06:44,241
To end the political career
of your commander-in-chief?

1016
02:07:28,823 --> 02:07:31,087
Let's go!

1017
02:07:58,382 --> 02:08:02,078
Get your asses in here!
Come on, we got to go!

1018
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:08,148
Come on!

1019
02:08:13,761 --> 02:08:16,457
Hold it! We wait for Ryan!

1020
02:08:16,631 --> 02:08:18,155
Yeah? We're out of here!

1021
02:08:25,572 --> 02:08:28,506
Set it down! He's down there!

1022
02:08:41,119 --> 02:08:43,143
Come on!

1023
02:09:01,769 --> 02:09:03,397
l've got you!

1024
02:09:10,410 --> 02:09:12,435
Chavez, cover me!

1025
02:09:21,652 --> 02:09:23,677
Your hand. Give me your hand!

1026
02:10:30,778 --> 02:10:33,770
The President will see you now.

1027
02:10:46,090 --> 02:10:49,060
Jack! l'm glad you're here.

1028
02:10:50,528 --> 02:10:54,555
Sit down. Can l get you anything?

1029
02:10:54,732 --> 02:10:56,323
No.

1030
02:10:57,367 --> 02:11:01,667
- Come on, sit down.
- l would prefer to stand, sir.

1031
02:11:04,106 --> 02:11:10,271
Some things have gone on here
that l'm just becoming aware of.

1032
02:11:10,445 --> 02:11:14,676
l was kept in the dark, as you were,
for a very long time.

1033
02:11:14,848 --> 02:11:18,113
- Troubling things.
- Yeah.

1034
02:11:18,285 --> 02:11:22,618
Now we have to sort them out,
figure out who's responsible for what.

1035
02:11:22,789 --> 02:11:26,588
And what to do about it.
And we have to do it delicately,

1036
02:11:26,758 --> 02:11:29,592
otherwise people might
get the wrong idea.

1037
02:11:30,929 --> 02:11:32,260
We have to lie.

1038
02:11:34,366 --> 02:11:38,734
- Did l say that?
- No, you didn't.

1039
02:11:38,903 --> 02:11:42,532
- You're upset.
- l'm upset.

1040
02:11:42,707 --> 02:11:48,076
lt's understandable. Do you mind
if l give you a bit of advice?

1041
02:11:48,244 --> 02:11:50,711
Of course, you know this. You're smart.

1042
02:11:50,879 --> 02:11:54,336
Never make important decisions
while you're upset.

1043
02:11:55,316 --> 02:12:00,686
You did. American soldiers and
innocent civilians are dead because of it.

1044
02:12:00,855 --> 02:12:05,052
- l never ordered any...
- Don't you play that game with me!

1045
02:12:05,225 --> 02:12:09,126
Do not dishonour their memories
by pretending you didn't know!

1046
02:12:09,295 --> 02:12:12,856
- How dare you lecture me!
- How dare you, sir!

1047
02:12:13,032 --> 02:12:17,161
How dare you come here and bark at me
like some little junkyard dog!

1048
02:12:17,335 --> 02:12:20,497
l am the President of the United States!

1049
02:12:24,541 --> 02:12:27,408
lt gives me no pleasure to do it, sir.

1050
02:12:28,411 --> 02:12:31,539
As acting Deputy Director
of lntelligence, it is my duty

1051
02:12:31,714 --> 02:12:35,616
to report this matter
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

1052
02:12:40,655 --> 02:12:46,388
- You're not going to do that.
- l'm not?

1053
02:12:48,862 --> 02:12:52,628
You've got yourself
a chip in the big game now.

1054
02:12:54,067 --> 02:12:59,663
You're going to save that for a time
when your own ass is on the line.

1055
02:13:00,239 --> 02:13:03,230
And then you're going to pull it out.

1056
02:13:03,408 --> 02:13:07,605
And l'm going to cash it in for you.
Right?

1057
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:13,115
l don't think l have anything more
to say to you, sir.

1058
02:13:14,518 --> 02:13:19,955
The country can't afford another
scandal, Jack. To protect itself,

1059
02:13:20,122 --> 02:13:25,821
it won't allow another deception
that goes all the way to the top.

1060
02:13:25,994 --> 02:13:29,987
You'll take the blame.
Cutter and Ritter will take some too,

1061
02:13:30,164 --> 02:13:33,395
but it will only amount to
a slap on the wrist.

1062
02:13:33,567 --> 02:13:37,560
Then 20,000 dollars an hour
on the lecture circuit.

1063
02:13:38,738 --> 02:13:42,834
The rest of the blame will fall on Greer.

1064
02:13:43,009 --> 02:13:46,705
Oh yeah, you'll take him down with you.

1065
02:13:46,878 --> 02:13:48,971
You'll destroy his reputation.

1066
02:13:49,581 --> 02:13:55,176
But that's as far as it will go.
The old Potomac two-step, Jack.

1067
02:13:58,121 --> 02:14:01,818
l'm sorry, Mr President, l don't dance.

1068
02:14:25,277 --> 02:14:27,370
Ryan, have you got a minute?

1069
02:14:27,546 --> 02:14:29,343
No.

1070
02:14:30,349 --> 02:14:33,146
We need to talk!

1071
02:14:33,318 --> 02:14:35,285
Ryan!

1072
02:14:59,573 --> 02:15:05,238
The Committee will come to order.
The chair will now call Dr John Ryan.

1073
02:15:26,163 --> 02:15:32,031
Dr Ryan, thank you for appearing
before the Committee today.

1074
02:15:32,835 --> 02:15:35,531
Please stand and raise your right hand.

1075
02:15:39,407 --> 02:15:43,365
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you're about to give

1076
02:15:43,544 --> 02:15:47,877
is the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?
