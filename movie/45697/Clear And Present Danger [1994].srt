1
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,455
Target bearing 0-2-0.

2
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:17,439
Contact 0-2-0.

- Range 20,000.
- Range 20,000 yards.

- Course 2-5-5.
- Course 2-5-5 true.

- Speed 13.
- Speed 13 knots.

6
00:01:28,158 --> 00:01:30,492
Cowboys.

7
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,422
Man the guns.

8
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:34,366
Enchanter, Mobile.

9
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:40,059
Well, we're a long way from home.
Wake them up!

10
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,669
Enchanter!
This is the US Coast Guard!

11
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:11,803
Heave to and prepare to be boarded!

12
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:29,150
Enchanter! You are a US flagged ship,
and we are going to board you.

13
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,450
Heave to now!

14
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:45,468
l want to see your crew on the bow.

15
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:03,968
You two, move forward.

16
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,336
Randall, come with me.

17
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:14,524
- What do you want?
- Kneel down.

18
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:21,922
Captain... Captain?

19
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:23,514
Go ahead, Senior Chief.

20
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:29,148
lt's a bad one. l think you'd better
send over the video camera.

21
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,388
Jack, come on in.

22
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:53,888
- How high is the pile on your desk?
- About this high.

23
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:56,443
- Now it's this high.
- What have you got?

24
00:04:56,443 --> 00:05:01,404
You heard about that business in
the south Caribbean? l need the details.

25
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:03,779
- By when?
- As soon as you can.

26
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,289
- OK.
- Jack? Be discreet.

27
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,516
What do you mean?

28
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:14,534
You will find out.

29
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,401
Mysterious...

30
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,894
l love a mystery.

31
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,925
- Ryan, John P.
- Let him through.

32
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,759
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

33
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,342
- You know where you're going?
- Yes. Thank you.

34
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:41,668
- Oh, where do l park?
- Right over there.

35
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:54,210
...main passageway, going forward...

36
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,093
...master stateroom...
blood on the deck...

37
00:05:57,093 --> 00:06:00,835
19 cartridges were recovered...

38
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:06,368
...as well as
the two weapons that fired them.

39
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:12,996
The blood samples taken were
consistent with the crew, Hardin...

40
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:16,477
...and his wife
and his son and daughter.

41
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:20,894
...blood on sheets and pillows...

42
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:25,407
...on both starboard and port side racks.
And on the mirror too.

43
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:30,366
They were killed in their staterooms,
apparently as they slept.

44
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:32,773
Dragged topside and thrown overboard.

45
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:39,006
The two men in custody surrendered
after a brief attempt to escape.

46
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:42,308
What do we know about them?
The men in custody?

47
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:48,615
Half a dozen arrests for drug
trafficking in Bogota, Mr President.

48
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,046
Drugs.

49
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:56,165
Suspected ties to the Cali cartel,
not Medellin...

50
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,672
You all right, James?

51
00:06:57,672 --> 00:06:59,874
...according to DEA.

52
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:02,562
- Why?
- Nothing exotic, sir.

53
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:05,763
Straight piracy and murder.
lt's not the first time.

54
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,174
lt's the first time it was a friend of mine.

55
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:14,881
Yes, sir.

56
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:24,330
- What was that? You all right?
- Yeah.

57
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,945
l haven't slept in 36 hours.
l make any sense?

58
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:30,497
l don't know. What did you say?
Just kidding. Good job.

59
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:39,209
- You should give diplomacy lessons.
- To call it as l see it is my job.

60
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,535
- And he's yours.
- Wait for me.

61
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:47,848
Shut the door.

62
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:56,458
l promised the American people
l'd do something about the drug problem.

63
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,506
You are.

64
00:07:58,506 --> 00:08:02,628
We support the Colombians' efforts
against the cartels...

65
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:08,098
We have accomplished nothing. Do these
drug dealers think we're powerless?

66
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:13,353
That they can keep doing this kind
of thing, and there's no response ever?

67
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,790
Are you suggesting
a course of action, sir?

68
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:24,520
The course of action l'd suggest
is a course of action l can't suggest.

69
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:41,827
l am...not sure where that leaves us.

70
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:49,385
These drug cartels represent
a clear and present danger

71
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:53,095
to the national security
of the United States.

72
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:30,091
Cortez, Cortez.. !

73
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:22,789
That doesn't surprise me.

74
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:27,012
- lt should at least concern you.
- What can they do?

75
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:30,347
Come after me? Arrest me?

76
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:32,584
You're scaring me.

77
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:38,635
Will you stop long enough
for me to tell you something important?

78
00:10:41,168 --> 00:10:42,957
Thank you.

79
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,822
Listen... You pay me to counsel you,
and l am counselling you.

80
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:55,596
l am keeping you alive with information.

81
00:10:55,596 --> 00:11:01,063
lf you disregard my counsel and keep
running your business like this,

82
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:05,423
with your balls and not your head,
two things will happen.

83
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:09,552
l will quit, and you will get killed.

84
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:24,360
You forgot to tell me
about your scouting trip.

85
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,042
- No, l didn't.
- You made another contact. Who?

86
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,788
Castro always asked me
about my sources.

87
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:37,224
- l always gave him the same answer.
- Castro didn't pay you what l pay.

88
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:40,689
This one will cost you nothing.

89
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,821
A woman.

90
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:47,149
You're using a woman.

91
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,695
lt won't float.

92
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,697
- John, what do you want? Toast?
- Waffles!

93
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:03,240
- No time for waffles.
- Anybody seen my keys?

94
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,996
On the front hall table or in your pocket.

95
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:09,097
- Where are my keys?
- Pancakes!

96
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:12,649
- Toast, please!
- Thank you.

97
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,818
- Bye, pal.
- Daddy. lt won't float!

98
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:21,737
lt's not supposed to float,
it's a submarine. lt goes under water.

99
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:25,059
Hello?

100
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,423
When?

101
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:34,130
l thought l had the flu.

102
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,804
l'd still think so
if they weren't telling me otherwise.

103
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:43,276
What are they telling you?

104
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:49,160
Pancreatic cancer of an aggressive
nature, if l heard them right.

105
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,298
Well, what does it mean?

106
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:55,593
l guess it means l am in big trouble.

107
00:12:56,243 --> 00:13:00,586
- l mean, can they operate, or...?
- Maybe.

108
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:06,190
That's what they said, "maybe", which
sounds suspiciously like ''no'' to me.

109
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,723
There's one of them now.

110
00:13:10,644 --> 00:13:13,960
Hey, l am not dead yet.

111
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:20,049
l am in a hospital, which means
that l am not in my office,

112
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,154
which means
l don't know what's going on.

113
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:25,227
- l need you there.
- Where?

114
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:29,073
- ln my office, doing my job.
- Wait...

115
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:32,585
l hate not knowing
what's going on, you know that.

116
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:35,539
l wouldn't know how to do your job, sir.

117
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:39,956
You have been around.
You have been to the White House.

118
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:43,597
- Once. l hated it.
- No, you didn't.

119
00:13:44,821 --> 00:13:48,618
Want to know about politics
in Washington? Four words...

120
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:50,447
''Watch your back, Jack.''

121
00:13:56,245 --> 00:14:01,483
Bobby, you should be the first to know,
or the third or fourth...

122
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,720
Ryan is to be acting
Deputy Director of lntelligence.

123
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,123
lt will be a provisional appointment,
of course, until James recovers.

124
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:13,807
You brief him
on our aid programme to Colombia.

125
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:18,676
He has to talk the Oversight Committee
out of another 75 million dollars.

126
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:22,067
And not make a complete fool
out of himself.

127
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:26,159
What about the Hardin murders?

128
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,774
l am on it. The President's calling
for a full-court press.

129
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:34,732
So, you guys are going to be
working together hand in hand.

130
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,747
That's great.

131
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:54,771
Margaret...

132
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:58,677
- Why don't we leave all his things?
- OK.

133
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,949
Ryan. l can't believe it!

134
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:16,657
He's not a team player,
is that what you're saying?

135
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:18,678
He's a Boy Scout.

136
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:24,943
A goddamn Boy Scout. Believes in
loyalty, cleanliness and knot-tying.

137
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:27,250
So leave him out of it.

138
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,158
He's the Deputy Director of
lntelligence. That will be tricky.

139
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,807
What does he need to know?

140
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:39,693
Nothing. He needs to know nothing.
He's going to know nothing.

141
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:42,868
l want a copy
of the President's authorisation

142
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:45,901
of this new action against the cartels.

143
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:50,352
- You want what?
- You heard me.

144
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:53,166
He doesn't know about it.

145
00:15:55,224 --> 00:16:01,007
Let me explain it to you very simply.
This is your deal. Not mine.

146
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:05,998
Unless l have written authorisation,
this thing is over before it begins.

147
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:11,025
l am not going to be the only one left
without a chair when the music stops.

148
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:53,553
Reciprocity. That's a clever name for it.

149
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:57,748
Revenge is a very, very,
very dangerous motivation.

150
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:05,274
Are you able to handle this operation
or not? l am looking for a yes or no.

151
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,282
You're looking for a political mess.

152
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:11,126
- Yes or no?
- ls that what they want?

153
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:15,568
They want what every first-term
administration wants. A second term.

154
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:20,117
l don't imagine the boys on the Hill
have approved this.

155
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,349
Have they?

156
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,290
ls that a ''no''?

157
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:39,286
Shit.

158
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:45,015
l want the money in my account
before l move an inch.

159
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:48,343
- You got it.
- l need a ComSat link.

160
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:50,744
- An insertion team.
- Have a brigade.

161
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:55,283
l don't want a brigade. Just 12 men
who understand discretionary warfare.

162
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:59,097
- Special Ops people, Spanish-speaking.
- Cutter will get the military.

163
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,405
- How are you today, sir?
- Very well.

164
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:11,606
- The purpose of your visit?
- Business.

165
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:14,391
- What business are you in?
- l sell tractors.

166
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:16,379
l build them, then l sell them.

167
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:21,682
- And how long will you be staying?
- A few days.

168
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:51,927
l know it's a risk,
but what's the alternative?

169
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:56,534
Zapping a retina with 6,000 rads
of cobalt? Not a pretty picture.

170
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:59,604
Prettier than a tumour
spreading in the cranial sack.

171
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,716
What is her name?

172
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:07,353
Listen... Hungry?

173
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:11,446
- Starved.
- We could forget about lunch.

174
00:19:11,446 --> 00:19:16,218
- We did that last time, remember?
- Do l remember? Do you?

175
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:21,527
- Vaguely.
- Maybe l should refresh your memory.

176
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:26,677
- Maybe you should.
- Your table is ready now.

177
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:29,716
- We don't need it. l will get a cab.
- Moira?

178
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:35,157
- Hi! How are you? How's Jack?
- He's great, just great.

179
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:38,196
- You still with the FBl?
- The Director's office.

180
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:40,855
- Who was that?
- My new friend.

181
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:43,870
Señor Roberto Landa.

182
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,926
- Doesn't he look like Jack?
- Does he? l can't quite see.

183
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:52,470
- Only Latin.
- A Latin Jack? This l have to see.

184
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,838
l have to go. Bye.

185
00:19:57,727 --> 00:20:02,005
Well, we know it's not piracy.
Pirates steal boats.

186
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:06,965
They had plane tickets to Bogota
the morning after the killings.

187
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:08,663
- Hey, Dan.
- How's it going?

188
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:12,061
We're sneaking up on a motive.
Dan Murray, FBl.

189
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:15,006
- Ralph Williams, DEA.
- Said anything yet?

190
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:19,391
- Yeah, ''We're innocent.''
- Till the D.A. offers them a deal.

191
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:22,868
He already has. Regular or extra crispy.

192
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:26,204
Either referring to fried chicken
or the electric chair.

193
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,983
Are you picturing a hit?

194
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:33,375
On a respectable American
businessman and his family?

195
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,891
You're assuming he's respectable.

196
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:50,460
We have memos,
letters, credit card statements...

197
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,775
...phone bills, everything
you could need to break his code.

198
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:58,937
- What's this?
- Old high school yearbook.

199
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:02,934
- Sweethearts, football team...
- You think?

200
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:07,612
- l don't know.
- OK, let's see what we have got.

201
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:10,013
- No cream?
- There wasn't any.

202
00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:14,583
Let's start with birthdays.
Bet your ATM code is your birthday.

203
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,623
- Close.
- ln reverse?

204
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,536
All right, his birthday is...

205
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:28,128
That would be too easy, wouldn't it?
Try it in reverse.

206
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:30,810
No. His wife's?

207
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,433
No. His son's?

208
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,773
- This could take...
- Months.

209
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,760
Son's in reverse. This is for you.

210
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:43,191
No. Wife's in reverse.

211
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:45,337
No. Daughter's in reverse.

212
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,376
You have got to change your ATM code.

213
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,895
l got it!

214
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,005
l got it!

215
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,892
Wife's birth month,
daughter's day, son's year.

216
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:15,808
But not in reverse. Sorry.

217
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:26,046
Print me out that one, will you?

218
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:28,219
Good boy.

219
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:32,763
Three years ago, Hardin received
a large infusion of foreign money,

220
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:37,950
which he invested wisely
in 20 major shopping centres in the US.

221
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,394
l say wisely because in the middle of
the recession, he posted record profits.

222
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:46,753
At least to the lRS, who he apparently
feared more than his own partners.

223
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:49,501
According to the figures he gave them...

224
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:54,205
...the shopping centres
weren't doing so well.

225
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:58,780
But he was just skimming most of
the profits, 650 million dollars,

226
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,745
and putting it in numbered accounts
in Luxembourg, Panama

227
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:07,652
and the Cayman lslands.
They killed him for it.

228
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,652
Who?

229
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,864
- His partners.
- Who were his partners?

230
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:19,259
lt seems clear that he was laundering
money for the Colombian drug cartels.

231
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:25,212
Jesus... l knew the man for 40 years.
We went to school together.

232
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:28,317
We almost went into business together.

233
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:31,420
That would have been good.

234
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,323
The press is going
to have a field-day with this.

235
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:39,966
- No one outside this room knows.
- They will. They always do.

236
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:44,836
lt will come out, you're right about that.
And when it does, we will...

237
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:49,635
...downplay your relationship
with Hardin somehow.

238
00:23:51,654 --> 00:23:53,279
- What?
- What?

239
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,024
- We will defuse it.
- Do you disagree?

240
00:23:57,024 --> 00:23:57,774
No.

241
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:03,781
Well, actually, yes.
l would go in the other direction.

242
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:08,798
lf a reporter asked if you and Hardin
were friends, l'd say ''good friends''.

243
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,505
lf they asked if you were good friends,
l'd say ''lifelong friends''.

244
00:24:13,505 --> 00:24:19,005
Give them no place to go,
nothing to report. No story.

245
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:25,764
l mean, it's no sense in
defusing a bomb after it's already...

246
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,567
...it's already gone off.

247
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,211
- Damn.
- Shit.

248
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:56,740
Do you see him?

249
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,604
All right. Move your team
two metres to the left.

250
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:07,651
That's it. Stop.

251
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:11,678
Touch that light-coloured grass.
Sniper at your feet.

252
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,687
Nothing here, Sergeant Major.

253
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:17,829
- Damn!
- He is good.

254
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,081
That was close.
How's he moving so fast?

255
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:46,536
l see him. Come in.
Straight in. Now. Run!

256
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:50,016
Keep coming.

257
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:55,555
To your left. To your left.

258
00:25:56,745 --> 00:26:00,127
And stop. Sniper at your feet.

259
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:03,431
What is it?

260
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,735
He had lunch here.

261
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:14,664
McDonald's quarter-pounder
with cheese.

262
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:16,364
Damn.

263
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:25,193
- Damn!
- That's four.

264
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:29,767
All right, you won this one.
Come on out!

265
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:34,529
Soldier, how did you get
that close to me?

266
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:39,816
Sniper approached instructor by being
a sneaky bastard, Sergeant Major!

267
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:43,972
Do you know the fine for littering
in California, Chavez?

268
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:46,309
Yes, sir!

269
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:52,421
l saw you on the sniper course.
You looked good.

270
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:55,969
- Just about finished here, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

271
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:59,751
Looking forward to taking
some leave with your wife and kids?

272
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:04,424
- Don't have any wife or kids, sir.
- What do you have?

273
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:11,586
You don't call anybody often,
you don't write or receive many letters.

274
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:16,739
Who are you, sir, if l may ask?

275
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:21,283
Mr Clark and l are putting together
a mission. My team is a part of it.

276
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:26,185
You will be gone up to six months,
after which, if you're not dead,

277
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:29,828
you will have a choice
of assignments in Special Ops.

278
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:50,219
...defusing an issue that was
snowballing into another scandal.

279
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:54,982
The New York Times is reporting that
you and Hardin were good friends?

280
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:59,109
No, not good friends.
We were lifelong friends.

281
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:02,986
l said that. l said that.

282
00:28:05,036 --> 00:28:06,727
l told him to say that.

283
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:10,985
- What?
- l didn't say anything.

284
00:28:10,985 --> 00:28:14,498
- But you were thinking something.
- No.

285
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:18,826
l was just distracted by the trouble
you were having with your ensemble.

286
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,937
Well, it's not every day
you have to look trustworthy.

287
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:28,298
- Who told who to say what?
- lt's not important.

288
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:32,556
- The President?
- Yeah.

289
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:36,744
Mom says she makes more money
than the President.

290
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:39,757
She's probably right. Bye.

291
00:28:48,078 --> 00:28:52,105
Thank you, Dr Ryan,
for the information you have shared with us.

292
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:56,298
- Thank you, Senator.
- We must help the Colombians

293
00:28:56,298 --> 00:29:00,773
in their struggle to curtail
the drug cartels' activities.

294
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:06,987
However, l am confused.
How do you see additional funds alone

295
00:29:06,987 --> 00:29:09,867
advancing this programme
from the failure that it is?

296
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:14,154
- You see what l am getting at?
- No, l am afraid l don't.

297
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:17,580
You said this effort would be
totally benign on our part.

298
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,565
The finding clearly states our assistance
is limited to supply and advice only.

299
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:24,077
l have read that.

300
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:28,844
l have also read a similar finding
written 35 years ago

301
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:32,936
regarding a little-thought-of
sliver of jungle in south-east Asia.

302
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:39,049
Sorry, you're comparing our request
for anti-drug funds to Vietnam?

303
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:43,044
l am comparing it to every time
a committee such as this is asked

304
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:47,471
to render judgement
based on less than all the facts.

305
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:53,133
l am afraid l don't know
what to say to that.

306
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:56,362
You could assure us
we have been given all the facts.

307
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,284
l thought l had.

308
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:03,631
You could further assure us, then,
that this increase in funds

309
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:07,054
will not be used for
any covert military action.

310
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:10,923
l don't know how you're getting to this.

311
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:14,122
Long experience, sir.

312
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:15,914
No troops, then?

313
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:21,710
l enunciate that clearly because
l don't want there to be any mistake.

314
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,334
No troops.

315
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,086
You could say l have your word on that?

316
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:29,704
You could indeed, because you do.

317
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:50,983
Listen up! Dog tags...
Take them off, pass them forward.

318
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:56,620
Check your pockets for anything
that can be used for identification.

319
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:05,518
We're feet dry.

320
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:22,028
Landing zone in sight. Get ready.

321
00:31:22,028 --> 00:31:24,943
Good luck, boys. Go get them.

322
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,795
OK, let's take her down now.

323
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,802
Hey, Bob.

324
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:19,345
- How you doing?
- Good, sir.

325
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:22,352
Good to see you.

326
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:31,475
- Morning, Jack.
- Ryan! Come on in.

327
00:33:32,118 --> 00:33:34,289
- Do you know everyone?
- Yes, yes.

328
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:37,520
- Coffee? Bagel?
- Coffee. Black, please.

329
00:33:38,678 --> 00:33:41,940
- How's the family?
- Good, sir.

330
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,331
- When do l meet the other Dr Ryan?
- She's dying to meet you, sir.

331
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:47,469
Good, good. Sit down.

332
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:58,001
- The cash is still there?
- Sir?

333
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:02,161
- ln Hardin's off-shore accounts.
- 650 million dollars.

334
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:04,399
- And change.
- And change...

335
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,862
- And we have the account numbers.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:13,107
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get it.

337
00:34:13,107 --> 00:34:17,166
Let's turn this thing around.
650 million dollars and change.

338
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:20,718
lt's worth ten times that
in political capital.

339
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,345
What?

340
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:32,941
Well... This connection between
Hardin and the cartels is a theory.

341
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:35,413
- Theory?
- A theory of mine.

342
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:39,285
- lt's a theory?
- Well, l know the money is there.

343
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:43,921
But who exactly Hardin
was working for, l don't know.

344
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:49,456
l think we would have to establish
that before we could seize the money.

345
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:55,311
So go down there. Establish it.

346
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,847
- Go where?
- Colombia.

347
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:02,165
Who, me?

348
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:10,133
l leave you alone for two weeks,
and you walk into a big bear trap.

349
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,206
l don't know what l was thinking.

350
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:18,422
You were thinking about impressing
the President. You shouldn't do that.

351
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:21,749
- November.
- January.

352
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:23,604
Of last year.

353
00:35:26,617 --> 00:35:30,992
There's a guy down there,
at least used to be... Clark.

354
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,264
We go way back. Good man.

355
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,230
lf you hit a brick wall, look him up.

356
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,569
Admiral Greer?

357
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:44,592
- Chemotherapy.
- Oh, shit.

358
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:47,031
Here we go again.

359
00:35:48,218 --> 00:35:50,487
How's Ritter behaving?

360
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:54,195
Ritter's Ritter. He's leaving me alone.

361
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:58,388
Are you sure? Watch him like a hawk.

362
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:00,943
- How are you feeling today?
- OK.

363
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:06,416
We will get you in a room, give you
warm blankets, get you lying down.

364
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:11,671
And then we will get you back
to your room and get you comfortable...

365
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:05,367
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

366
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,126
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

367
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:15,154
Knife, this is Variable,
your signal is five by five, over.

368
00:37:18,461 --> 00:37:20,348
Clear.

369
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:45,076
The chicken is in the pot. Over.

370
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:49,719
- Cook it.
- Roger that.

371
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,237
Honey? l am late.

372
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:12,694
Have a good trip.

373
00:38:14,014 --> 00:38:16,599
l am not going to say it.

374
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,319
Don't.

375
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:20,952
Be careful.

376
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:53,558
Local time is, well, actually, it's
the same as Washington, 11.16 a.m.

377
00:38:53,558 --> 00:38:57,076
Temperature is
69 degrees Fahrenheit...

378
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:05,594
Doctor Ryan!

379
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:18,006
DEA Special Agent Jean Fowler.
How you doing?

380
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:20,215
- First time in Bogota?
- Yeah.

381
00:39:20,215 --> 00:39:24,759
Let's not stand here
and let someone take a shot at you.

382
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:43,999
- And these two?
- They're brothers.

383
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:50,840
Don't do that. Give Dr Ryan
a bit more air back here, please.

384
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,830
Bulletproof.

385
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,709
We don't have a picture.
Escobedo's intelligence officer.

386
00:40:04,225 --> 00:40:06,745
We don't have a name either,
but we know he exists.

387
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:10,524
The invisible man?

388
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:13,784
Gently, gently. With your hands.

389
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:16,986
Luis, put your hands together.

390
00:40:17,825 --> 00:40:20,509
No, your hands together!

391
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:26,011
Luis, watch the canter!

392
00:40:27,074 --> 00:40:29,943
Yes, very good!

393
00:40:37,922 --> 00:40:40,540
We lost another plane.

394
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:50,871
- Who is doing this?
- lf l had to guess...

395
00:40:50,871 --> 00:40:54,457
No, l did not ask you to guess.
l can guess.

396
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:58,171
Someone's been talking
to the drug police.

397
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:02,878
lmpossible. lf anyone spoke to the
police, l'd be the first to know.

398
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,985
Ernesto!

399
00:41:06,627 --> 00:41:11,449
ls one of the others trying to ruin me,
after what l did to the American?

400
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:16,921
l guess that wasn't quite
the deterrent you thought it would be.

401
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:18,978
Find out who it is.

402
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:29,022
What do you make of this, Colonel?

403
00:41:30,595 --> 00:41:32,188
An opportunity.

404
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:36,731
An opportunity, Sipo.

405
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:53,728
- Good afternoon.
- Messages, please?

406
00:41:55,492 --> 00:41:59,747
- Dr Ryan?
- Clark? Sorry l am late.

407
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:02,079
l have got ten minutes.

408
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:08,447
l am positive Hardin was tied into
the cartels. lt's drug money.

409
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:12,060
- But you can't prove it.
- So far.

410
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:16,962
- Mind if l ask you a question?
- No.

411
00:42:16,962 --> 00:42:23,105
Why are you telling me all this?
l have been out of the game for a long time.

412
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:30,112
l was told that you were wired in,
that you knew the town, the people.

413
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:33,625
- That you were a player.
- Who told you that?

414
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:36,858
Jim Greer.

415
00:42:39,237 --> 00:42:40,514
How's he doing?

416
00:42:43,525 --> 00:42:45,827
He's not good.

417
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:49,114
lt's cancer.

418
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:51,227
Terminal.

419
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,863
- He's a good man.
- The best.

420
00:43:03,398 --> 00:43:05,634
You a coffee drinker, Dr Ryan?

421
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,482
- Yeah, l like coffee.
- Try the Lindo brand.

422
00:43:12,482 --> 00:43:15,875
- Lindo?
- l think you will like it.

423
00:43:21,798 --> 00:43:25,028
Mr president, l have got some good news.

424
00:43:25,028 --> 00:43:31,486
Hardin's partner here was someone
you may know of. Ernesto Escobedo.

425
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:35,299
- Figures.
- ls this another of your theories?

426
00:43:35,974 --> 00:43:41,539
No, sir. We can call this one fact.
Escobedo, like every drug lord here,

427
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:46,853
also had legitimate businesses.
Hardin was doing business with them.

428
00:43:47,431 --> 00:43:52,100
lmporting among other things,
coffee, which means nothing,

429
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:58,493
but he was paying too much for
this coffee. 6,200 dollars a pound.

430
00:43:58,493 --> 00:44:02,046
- That's expensive coffee.
- l'd have to agree.

431
00:44:02,046 --> 00:44:04,933
This is good news. l think this does it.

432
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:08,839
Sir, l also have some other news
which is not so good.

433
00:44:09,704 --> 00:44:11,231
Oh, God...

434
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:17,248
The DEA feels that the government
here would want the seized funds.

435
00:44:17,248 --> 00:44:22,085
- Or at least a large portion.
- This is our money.

436
00:44:22,085 --> 00:44:25,892
- We found it.
- We could try telling them that.

437
00:44:25,892 --> 00:44:29,318
Try? Tell them.
Or don't tell them, l don't care.

438
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:33,987
- Sir, with all due respect...
- This is our money, tell them that.

439
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:39,008
l wouldn't know what to say
or where to start, l am not a negotiator.

440
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:41,380
Don't you know someone there?

441
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,162
l went to school
with their Attorney General.

442
00:44:44,162 --> 00:44:48,769
Jacobs will come down.
He will negotiate. This is our money.

443
00:44:49,897 --> 00:44:51,391
Thank...

444
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:54,277
Thank you.

445
00:44:57,321 --> 00:45:00,136
l hate this job.

446
00:46:14,123 --> 00:46:16,228
Eyes up!

447
00:46:18,507 --> 00:46:20,394
Demo Team, up!

448
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:29,383
Fire in the hole!

449
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:37,385
Let's go, let's go!
Move out! Go, go, go!

450
00:46:57,804 --> 00:46:59,943
Whoever did this is dead.

451
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:05,860
Whoever did this to me is dead!

452
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:11,179
Do you hear me?
Are you listening to me?

453
00:47:24,877 --> 00:47:28,489
Mr Jacobs, could you sign these
before you leave?

454
00:47:29,645 --> 00:47:34,795
Moira... Why don't you
call in sick tomorrow?

455
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:38,153
And the next day. l won't tell anybody.

456
00:47:38,153 --> 00:47:40,903
Even when you're not here,
there's plenty to do.

457
00:47:41,614 --> 00:47:45,094
- Your itinerary.
- You're arguing with me about this?

458
00:47:45,998 --> 00:47:49,991
You work too hard. Adios.

459
00:48:27,023 --> 00:48:29,740
- Landa & Landa.
- Roberto Landa, please.

460
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:34,376
- This is Moira Wolfson.
- One moment, please.

461
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:38,023
l think he's on the factory floor.

462
00:48:43,183 --> 00:48:46,478
- Yes?
- A Moira Wolfson is calling.

463
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:52,647
l told her you were
on the factory floor. Go ahead.

464
00:48:52,647 --> 00:48:55,914
- Moira... !
- Hi.

465
00:48:55,914 --> 00:49:00,935
You free the next couple of days?
l am.

466
00:49:01,615 --> 00:49:05,991
My boss is leaving the country.

467
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:11,048
- Can l call you later?
- All right, call me at home. Bye.

468
00:49:19,408 --> 00:49:25,256
Good afternoon.
Good news in the fight against drugs.

469
00:49:25,256 --> 00:49:29,002
An investigation
by the Department of Justice

470
00:49:29,585 --> 00:49:33,960
has identified several
bank accounts, from Luxembourg

471
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,773
to the Cayman lslands,
used for laundering drug money

472
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:43,021
on an unprecedented scale.
Working with five foreign governments,

473
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:46,731
we have taken action
to seize those funds,

474
00:49:46,731 --> 00:49:50,345
which amount to
over 650 million dollars.

475
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:52,040
Oh, shit.

476
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,552
Also to seize 20 real estate
joint venture investments in the US

477
00:49:56,552 --> 00:50:02,286
which were the primary agencies
in the laundering operations.

478
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:05,995
You did say 650 million dollars?

479
00:50:05,995 --> 00:50:09,839
That's right.
650 million dollars. And change.

480
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,140
They're stealing my money!

481
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:17,575
- What's our take?
- lt's hard to say at the moment.

482
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:22,121
No, it isn't. You're stealing my money.
l made it, you're stealing it!

483
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:28,334
Mr president, can we speak with
FBl Director Jacobs about this?

484
00:50:28,334 --> 00:50:32,143
- Jacobs is not available.
- Someone will die for this.

485
00:50:32,143 --> 00:50:37,969
He's personally involved in this
investigation and is pretty busy.

486
00:50:48,403 --> 00:50:52,429
This avenue has to be avoided.
They will be coming from the airport.

487
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:57,003
Up Avenida Aeropuerto El Dorado
all the way to Gran America.

488
00:50:57,003 --> 00:51:01,262
Santa Fe's our spot.
As much as l'd love to be here for this,

489
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:07,144
l have to take care of some business
in Washington, tying up loose ends.

490
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:18,831
Hello? Don't hang up, don't hang up.

491
00:51:20,883 --> 00:51:24,910
- Hello?
- The machine is still on, Moira.

492
00:51:56,148 --> 00:52:00,174
- Emil, good to see you.
- Good to see you, Andy.

493
00:52:00,174 --> 00:52:04,618
- Agent Murray, Ambassador Ferris.
- Hi, good to see you.

494
00:52:04,618 --> 00:52:09,229
- This will bring you up to date.
- All right, let's go.

495
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:26,382
- How's the food?
- lt's like Mexican food.

496
00:52:26,382 --> 00:52:29,648
- You hate Mexican food.
- l hate Mexican food.

497
00:53:04,374 --> 00:53:06,644
- Hi.
- Hello.

498
00:53:06,644 --> 00:53:11,542
All my secretary knows about America
is what she reads in people magazine.

499
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:14,964
- How's the place?
- Come inside and find out.

500
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:25,428
lt's...awful.

501
00:53:27,255 --> 00:53:28,946
lsn't it?

502
00:53:51,768 --> 00:53:53,972
So l take it you shouldn't
drink the water?

503
00:53:55,991 --> 00:53:59,308
They put water in your room,
but l'd stick to the bottled stuff.

504
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:50,776
So, what do you brush your teeth with?

505
00:54:50,776 --> 00:54:55,160
Use the bottled water,
or you will be in the can all your time here.

506
00:55:02,585 --> 00:55:06,961
The hold-up was
a government connection?

507
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:46,898
Hey, what the hell?

508
00:55:57,339 --> 00:55:59,095
Back up! Back up!

509
00:56:05,116 --> 00:56:07,319
- Step on it!
- Stay down. Stay down.

510
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,616
Watch out!

511
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:23,252
Damn it! Back up!

512
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,649
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Take it easy, Andy.

513
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,817
Got to keep moving. Go, Jack!

514
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:50,457
lncoming!

515
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:29,926
Dan!

516
00:58:00,415 --> 00:58:02,171
Dan! Dan!

517
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:15,062
We can't stay here!

518
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,420
The car! ls it running?

519
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,470
lt's running!

520
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:26,366
The smoke will give us cover.
lt's our only chance. l got him.

521
00:58:26,366 --> 00:58:29,277
Make for the driver's side. Ready? Go!

522
00:58:39,424 --> 00:58:42,686
- Get in!
- Go! Go!

523
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,820
Housekeeping.

524
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:57,240
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

525
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:09,857
- You have a call for Dr Ryan?
- Just a moment.

526
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:16,445
...in the streets of Bogota today.
Ten were killed and eight wounded.

527
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:20,287
Five of the dead
were security personnel...

528
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:23,963
- Cathy?
- Don't tell me you're in this.

529
01:00:25,346 --> 01:00:28,958
Right in the middle of it.
Honey, Dan was killed.

530
01:00:29,858 --> 01:00:31,135
Dan Murray.

531
01:00:34,307 --> 01:00:37,373
He was 10 feet away.
There was nothing l could do.

532
01:00:39,746 --> 01:00:42,649
- l am coming home.
- Thank God.

533
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:45,023
l love you.

534
01:00:49,827 --> 01:00:53,056
- l thought his going there was a secret.
- lt was.

535
01:00:53,056 --> 01:00:57,693
- Then l don't get it. What happened?
- Nobody knows.

536
01:00:57,693 --> 01:01:02,082
- How stupid are these people?
- They believe they can do anything.

537
01:01:02,082 --> 01:01:05,145
You know what? They're wrong.

538
01:01:05,145 --> 01:01:07,552
- Yes, sir.
- They're wrong.

539
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:14,332
They have directly challenged the
sovereign power of the United States.

540
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:17,657
No more sending messages.

541
01:01:17,657 --> 01:01:21,756
He wants them to get the message
whether the phone rings or not.

542
01:01:21,756 --> 01:01:26,780
- Those are his words?
- Do they sound like his words?

543
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:31,072
He can't be clear
when clarity is what he wants to avoid.

544
01:01:31,072 --> 01:01:34,171
What he means is the gloves come off.

545
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:55,867
l am telling you, l had nothing to do with it.

546
01:01:55,867 --> 01:01:59,136
l wish l had done it,
they deserved it. But it wasn't me.

547
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:02,367
Who did then?

548
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:06,308
You know, you have no answers.

549
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:11,171
ls this the way it was with Castro?
No answers?

550
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:14,203
- You don't want to hear an answer.
- Yes, l do.

551
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:20,162
lt was done to look like you did it.
By one of the others.

552
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:24,352
As you suspected.
lt's always a friend who hates you most.

553
01:02:24,352 --> 01:02:26,373
Give me the phone.

554
01:02:33,222 --> 01:02:35,524
- Rojas.
- Did you do this thing?

555
01:02:35,524 --> 01:02:41,437
Did l do this thing? Are you calling
to ask me if l did this thing?

556
01:02:41,437 --> 01:02:45,087
You don't consult with us.
You put us in danger.

557
01:02:46,407 --> 01:02:50,204
And now you want me to believe
it wasn't you?

558
01:02:50,204 --> 01:02:51,901
lt wasn't, Enrique.

559
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:55,300
The Americans will
retaliate against us all.

560
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,595
l swear l had nothing to do with it.

561
01:02:58,595 --> 01:03:02,653
Why do you expect me
to listen to these lies?

562
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,245
- Goodbye, Ernesto.
- No, no, no!

563
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:08,289
Don't hang up.
We must have a meeting.

564
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:11,270
- When?
- As soon as possible.

565
01:03:14,471 --> 01:03:19,556
Tomorrow night. l am not
telling you, l am asking you!

566
01:03:19,556 --> 01:03:24,421
- May we meet tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

567
01:03:53,576 --> 01:03:55,463
- He's scared.
- He should be.

568
01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:58,275
l don't know what you said,
but it was right.

569
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:29,153
Strange, don't you think?

570
01:05:29,153 --> 01:05:33,119
Jacobs and his secretary
getting killed on the same day.

571
01:05:34,923 --> 01:05:39,146
lt wasn't his secretary.
He was a member of the security.

572
01:05:39,146 --> 01:05:40,769
Who?

573
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:47,144
- l don't remember his name.
- l am talking about Moira.

574
01:05:47,883 --> 01:05:50,339
Moira, remember? Jacobs' secretary.

575
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:54,119
l know Moira, honey.
What are you talking about?

576
01:05:59,276 --> 01:06:02,691
- She said he was a Latin Jack Ryan.
- He was.

577
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:07,050
- That's what she called him.
- The point is, he's Latin.

578
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:12,395
Which connects her death and Jacobs'
beyond the fact they worked together.

579
01:06:12,395 --> 01:06:16,266
You saw somebody you think
is responsible for both killings?

580
01:06:19,181 --> 01:06:20,707
She did.

581
01:06:22,765 --> 01:06:24,870
She did.

582
01:06:30,924 --> 01:06:33,892
l saw him from a distance. From behind.

583
01:06:33,892 --> 01:06:38,403
- Medium height, medium build, etc?
- Mind if l look at these?

584
01:06:39,052 --> 01:06:42,664
ls that what the people
from the cabin said?

585
01:06:44,461 --> 01:06:47,178
Did you check out
these calls to Venezuela?

586
01:06:49,869 --> 01:06:51,691
Disconnected.

587
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:57,576
- So you have no leads?
- Oh, l have a lot.

588
01:06:57,576 --> 01:07:02,052
A fictitious name on a register.
A stolen phoned-in credit card number.

589
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:07,110
Two eyewitnesses, one of whom
saw a guy, but didn't see him...

590
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,093
Excuse me,
could you play that again?

591
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:12,196
Yes, sir.

592
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:14,504
The machine is still on, Moira.

593
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:17,354
You have a recording of the killer's voice.

594
01:07:18,286 --> 01:07:19,006
Maybe.

595
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:28,457
Jack. l think we have got something.
This is from the answering machine.

596
01:07:28,457 --> 01:07:32,965
And this was recorded yesterday.
l will play it for you.

597
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:34,301
OK.

598
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:39,918
The machine is still on, Moira.

599
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:42,151
- All right.
- And...

600
01:07:42,151 --> 01:07:47,053
He's scared. l don't know
what you said to him, but it was right.

601
01:07:47,053 --> 01:07:49,865
Kurt, run a match on that.

602
01:07:52,495 --> 01:07:53,395
He's Cuban. 35-45.

603
01:07:58,511 --> 01:08:02,789
Educated in the United States.
Eastern United States.

604
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:06,541
- lt's the same voice.
- You're sure?

605
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,165
- Yeah.
- How sure?

606
01:08:13,807 --> 01:08:15,400
90 per cent.

607
01:08:16,816 --> 01:08:19,816
- l need a name.
- Could be hundreds of thousands...

608
01:08:19,816 --> 01:08:23,399
l know. l need a name,
and l need it quick.

609
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:43,334
300 is topside.

610
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:28,173
Target is set.

611
01:09:30,418 --> 01:09:33,451
- Hector!
- Enrique!

612
01:09:34,289 --> 01:09:36,679
Good to see you!

613
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:39,119
- lt was not easy.
- Enrique, how are you?

614
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:43,376
Rojas, Diaz...

615
01:09:46,322 --> 01:09:48,209
What the hell is this?

616
01:09:48,209 --> 01:09:51,153
What the hell is this?

617
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,698
My new toy. Like it?

618
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,126
You see this?

619
01:09:58,642 --> 01:10:02,952
That's your new target,
unless it's not big enough.

620
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:11,082
Variable, this is Easy Rhino.
Do you copy? Over.

621
01:10:11,922 --> 01:10:14,191
Loud and clear, Easy Rhino.

622
01:10:14,191 --> 01:10:18,129
- Do we have a gig?
- That's a rog.

623
01:10:23,731 --> 01:10:25,040
Target is lit.

624
01:10:26,772 --> 01:10:28,332
Start the music.

625
01:10:29,619 --> 01:10:31,113
lnto attack.

626
01:10:32,499 --> 01:10:37,136
Target is acquired and lit.
Coming down.

627
01:10:41,395 --> 01:10:48,139
Fernandez, Vega...
Looks like a full house.

628
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,601
Damn it! Why doesn't he fix this road?

629
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:03,759
Shit! Thought we had everybody.

630
01:11:04,596 --> 01:11:06,800
Keep the target painted.

631
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,856
Sir?

632
01:11:41,109 --> 01:11:42,385
Boom.

633
01:11:51,094 --> 01:11:52,370
Mother of God!

634
01:11:57,014 --> 01:11:59,087
Circular error probability zero.

635
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:02,832
lmpact with high order detonation.
Have a nice day.

636
01:12:09,174 --> 01:12:12,720
The man is completely out of control.
He has no...

637
01:12:14,966 --> 01:12:18,512
The man is completely out of control...

638
01:12:21,142 --> 01:12:24,339
His name is Cortez, Felix Cortez.

639
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:28,848
A colonel in Cuba's intelligence
service until a few years ago.

640
01:12:28,848 --> 01:12:33,749
Turned up working for the Macheteros
terrorist group in Puerto Rico.

641
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:39,857
Disappeared again. Yesterday we taped
him talking to a Cali cartel subject.

642
01:12:39,857 --> 01:12:44,398
l will fax what l have got.
lf he shows, pick him up, OK?

643
01:12:44,398 --> 01:12:48,178
- You know l can't do that.
- l mean the police.

644
01:12:48,178 --> 01:12:52,337
The Colombian police don't pick up
members of the cartel.

645
01:12:52,337 --> 01:12:55,885
Unless they have got a death wish.
You have been down here.

646
01:12:57,047 --> 01:12:58,738
Wait a minute.

647
01:12:59,223 --> 01:13:02,387
Oh Jesus...
Jack, something's happened here.

648
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,506
At least 30 people were killed,
including women and children.

649
01:13:19,506 --> 01:13:23,928
The bomb exploded in a car
belonging to a Rojas associate.

650
01:13:23,928 --> 01:13:27,797
- Jack...?
- Yeah, are you watching this?

651
01:13:27,797 --> 01:13:30,350
- Did this just happen?
- Just now.

652
01:13:33,848 --> 01:13:38,005
Send me all the stuff,
and we will put a tail on him if we spot him.

653
01:13:38,488 --> 01:13:41,172
lf he's still alive. l have got to go.

654
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:48,942
- A surgical strike, you said.
- lt was perfect.

655
01:13:48,942 --> 01:13:53,106
- That's a dead kid. On NBC.
- Take the gloves off, you said.

656
01:13:53,106 --> 01:13:56,786
- l know what l said.
- A bit late to change your mind.

657
01:13:56,786 --> 01:13:59,124
l am not changing my mind.

658
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:03,414
l hadn't counted on
this kind of collateral damage.

659
01:14:04,794 --> 01:14:07,696
- Neither had he.
- lt will be interpreted as l said.

660
01:14:07,696 --> 01:14:11,444
Rivalry that ended
in the blast of a car bomb.

661
01:14:11,444 --> 01:14:12,886
Goodnight.

662
01:14:27,578 --> 01:14:31,637
- Morning, Rose. Finish the report?
- Hot off the press.

663
01:14:34,394 --> 01:14:38,256
Could any of the bombing victims'
names be aliases?

664
01:14:38,714 --> 01:14:43,089
No. All lDs have been confirmed.
Who are you hoping for?

665
01:14:43,089 --> 01:14:46,804
lf he's not here, he's not here.
Cortez. He's not here.

666
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:52,944
- Why was Operations copied on this?
- Ritter requested it.

667
01:14:54,107 --> 01:14:56,954
Ritter, huh? You look very nice today.

668
01:14:57,947 --> 01:14:59,670
Thank you.

669
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:14,480
Car bomb...

670
01:15:23,803 --> 01:15:26,291
What happens
when a car bomb goes off?

671
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:30,354
- lt explodes.
- lt blows up and out?

672
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:32,825
And a missile?

673
01:15:36,092 --> 01:15:38,514
- This deeper crater?
- That's characteristic.

674
01:15:38,514 --> 01:15:40,789
Bring up the satellite photo.

675
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:50,192
HMX and TNT.

676
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:53,746
When you mix it 70/30,
you get a compound called Octol.

677
01:15:53,746 --> 01:15:56,884
Put enough explosives in a car,
you get a crater that big.

678
01:15:56,884 --> 01:16:01,624
- lt's very stable. Very expensive.
- Would it still be in the crater?

679
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:04,788
- Very violent.
- There would be pieces all around.

680
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:12,060
- Where is Octol made?
- Lots of places. Europe. The US.

681
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:16,793
But nobody uses it.
Nobody can afford it except the military.

682
01:16:16,793 --> 01:16:22,008
An aerial bomb would do that.
But that's not an aerial bomb.

683
01:16:22,008 --> 01:16:23,450
- lt's not?
- No.

684
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:27,093
There is also
a cellulose residue on everything.

685
01:16:27,093 --> 01:16:30,327
There should be shrapnel.
Here and here.

686
01:16:30,327 --> 01:16:34,006
- But there isn't.
- No bomb fragments.

687
01:17:16,062 --> 01:17:20,318
''Cellulose encased laser-guided bomb''...

688
01:17:22,367 --> 01:17:23,829
Paper.

689
01:17:27,999 --> 01:17:29,690
The Americans are here.

690
01:17:59,296 --> 01:18:03,322
We have something in common.
Neither of us can implement policy

691
01:18:03,322 --> 01:18:07,383
without at least tacit authorisation
from our employer.

692
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:12,221
We also both know there are
American troops in Colombia

693
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:14,872
fighting an illegal war.

694
01:18:16,288 --> 01:18:21,209
l will be at Hotel paloma de Oro
in panama City on Wednesday.

695
01:18:21,209 --> 01:18:22,937
l suggest we meet.

696
01:19:13,122 --> 01:19:17,017
- Six, this is point. Over.
- Six here.

697
01:19:18,306 --> 01:19:25,496
The stuff's here, a lot of it.
l am also looking at 100-250 men, armed,

698
01:19:25,496 --> 01:19:28,349
waiting around for something. Over.

699
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:30,936
Colombian Army? Over.

700
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:37,632
Negative. They look like mercenaries.

701
01:19:37,632 --> 01:19:41,143
All right. Get back here. Abort mission.

702
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:43,933
l say again, abort mission. Out.

703
01:19:45,731 --> 01:19:48,284
150 armed men, huh?

704
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:10,013
Raise your arms, please.

705
01:20:25,124 --> 01:20:28,899
Thank you for responding to my note.
And so promptly.

706
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:33,570
l had nothing to do
with the death of Mr Jacobs.

707
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:38,009
lt was an act of madness. But
a typical one from the men l work for.

708
01:20:39,716 --> 01:20:43,459
- What do you want?
- Same as you. Mineral water.

709
01:20:44,356 --> 01:20:49,113
Do we agree that as long as Americans
demand drugs, they will be supplied?

710
01:20:49,113 --> 01:20:51,772
l don't want to be here
longer than l have to.

711
01:20:51,772 --> 01:20:55,389
You mentioned a gang war.
What does that mean?

712
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:59,932
- That we want the same thing.
- Really?

713
01:20:59,932 --> 01:21:04,835
So far you have done all the work.
You have taken care of the little fish.

714
01:21:04,835 --> 01:21:06,971
l will take care of the one that got away.

715
01:21:07,685 --> 01:21:12,474
Once Escobedo is gone,
l will be in a position to help you.

716
01:21:12,474 --> 01:21:16,671
- You want to help me?
- Your country. Your people.

717
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:21,376
By restructuring the drug trade.
By regulating it.

718
01:21:22,693 --> 01:21:27,996
What would you say if l promised you
l'd halve cocaine shipments to the US?

719
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:33,632
l'd say you'd been using
too much of your product.

720
01:21:33,632 --> 01:21:37,213
l can also give you regular quotas
on major arrests

721
01:21:37,213 --> 01:21:40,447
that your police can take credit for.

722
01:21:40,447 --> 01:21:44,160
lmagine. Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions.

723
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,865
No more senseless violence.
You will have your victory.

724
01:21:53,095 --> 01:21:54,622
ln return for what?

725
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:59,620
l also need a victory,
to establish my position

726
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:04,255
with what is left of the cartel,
so l can help you.

727
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:09,637
l need to defeat those soldiers
blowing up everything they see.

728
01:22:09,637 --> 01:22:15,331
Give me maps of their locations.
Cut off their communications.

729
01:22:22,087 --> 01:22:27,587
DEA's sending the audio
surveillance tape. l haven't got it yet.

730
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:35,237
You know what you think about...
when you're lying here?

731
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,585
You know you're going to die,
and you think...

732
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:46,019
...that's all right. You lived a long time.

733
01:22:46,019 --> 01:22:48,191
You had a family that loved you.

734
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:52,707
You had a job that you thought
made a difference.

735
01:22:53,576 --> 01:22:56,260
That you thought was honourable.

736
01:22:57,192 --> 01:22:59,876
And then you see this.

737
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,430
l am afraid if l dig any deeper...

738
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:10,080
...no one's going to like what l find.

739
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:18,885
You took an oath...

740
01:23:18,885 --> 01:23:21,056
...if you recall...

741
01:23:23,785 --> 01:23:27,168
...when you first came to work for me.

742
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:32,836
And l don't mean to the National
Security Advisor of the United States,

743
01:23:33,993 --> 01:23:37,125
l mean to his boss.

744
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:39,678
And l don't mean the President.

745
01:23:41,257 --> 01:23:44,421
You gave your word to...

746
01:23:45,962 --> 01:23:48,449
...his boss.

747
01:23:48,449 --> 01:23:51,105
You gave your word...

748
01:23:51,105 --> 01:23:55,551
...to the people of the United States.

749
01:23:56,778 --> 01:23:59,461
Your word is who you are.

750
01:24:04,521 --> 01:24:05,983
What else have you got there?

751
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:14,945
l brought you some new magazines.

752
01:24:24,074 --> 01:24:29,671
The situation in East Timor seems
to have stabilised during the day.

753
01:24:29,671 --> 01:24:33,479
- ls that it?
- Except for the other thing.

754
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:37,825
We have accomplished a lot,
we're seeing tangible results.

755
01:24:37,825 --> 01:24:41,573
Drug shipments are down.
The price on the street is rising.

756
01:24:41,573 --> 01:24:45,994
The administration is perceived
to be doing something right.

757
01:24:45,994 --> 01:24:49,002
What's the bad news?

758
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:56,101
l am worried about the car bomb coming
so soon after Jacobs' assassination.

759
01:24:57,899 --> 01:25:00,518
Just the kind of thing reporters live for.

760
01:25:00,518 --> 01:25:04,644
- They'd love to make a connection.
- And you think they will?

761
01:25:06,027 --> 01:25:09,988
l think it's time
the whole thing went away.

762
01:25:09,988 --> 01:25:13,451
- lf that's what you think.
- l think so.

763
01:25:15,436 --> 01:25:19,779
Then it should go away.
lt never happened.

764
01:25:21,228 --> 01:25:23,115
Yes, sir.

765
01:25:24,556 --> 01:25:28,069
Well...it's possible.

766
01:25:28,069 --> 01:25:33,190
lt would be easier if you told me whose
system you wanted me to break into.

767
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:35,244
- Morning, Dr Ryan.
- Morning.

768
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,535
We're way beyond birthdays now.

769
01:25:59,469 --> 01:26:03,746
l am going to have to write
a special program here.

770
01:26:14,093 --> 01:26:17,868
OK, sweetheart, let's get to work.

771
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:20,588
Fine, good.

772
01:26:21,965 --> 01:26:25,544
Yes... Here we go.

773
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:23,397
Reciprocity. What's that?

774
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,510
l forgot to tell you, after you get the code,

775
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:43,341
wait until he's off his system
before you log on. He will know.

776
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,774
Jesus, Petey, it's too late.

777
01:27:45,774 --> 01:27:48,237
Oh, my God...

778
01:28:17,617 --> 01:28:19,210
Cutter...

779
01:28:33,297 --> 01:28:37,454
- Bob, Jack Ryan here.
- Good morning, Jack.

780
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:41,799
Listen, maybe we got off to a bad start.

781
01:28:42,546 --> 01:28:46,888
lf we're going to work together,
we should get to know each other.

782
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:51,052
Do you play tennis?
Tennis? Do you play tennis?

783
01:28:51,052 --> 01:28:55,440
- Yeah, l play tennis.
- How about we get together?

784
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,766
Next week?
Maybe an hour before we start work?

785
01:29:05,618 --> 01:29:07,593
- Jack?
- Yeah.

786
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:12,552
Computer theft is a serious crime.

787
01:29:15,634 --> 01:29:18,798
So are crimes against the Constitution.

788
01:29:20,339 --> 01:29:22,313
Son of a bitch!

789
01:29:33,715 --> 01:29:35,624
Son of a bitch!

790
01:29:39,635 --> 01:29:40,977
Come on, come on.

791
01:29:44,147 --> 01:29:45,740
Clark...

792
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,093
You're going to jail, pal.

793
01:30:23,573 --> 01:30:27,151
What is that?
What do you think you have there?

794
01:30:27,151 --> 01:30:28,843
You broke the law.

795
01:30:30,004 --> 01:30:33,801
You are such a Boy Scout.

796
01:30:33,801 --> 01:30:37,235
Look at you.
You see everything in black and white.

797
01:30:37,235 --> 01:30:41,194
No, not black and white, Ritter.
Right and wrong!

798
01:30:41,194 --> 01:30:45,707
- You see! There you go again.
- Why was l kept out of it?

799
01:30:45,707 --> 01:30:49,008
You weren't, you're neck deep in it.
You went before Congress.

800
01:30:49,008 --> 01:30:51,923
You got the money for it.
You lied under oath...

801
01:30:51,923 --> 01:30:56,689
- l never lied to Congress!
- You told them no troops.

802
01:30:56,689 --> 01:31:00,115
- There are troops!
- You know l didn't know that.

803
01:31:00,115 --> 01:31:05,711
No. l have no recollection of that.
That's the term you have to learn.

804
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:09,739
- Who authorised this?
- Sure, they will ask you that.

805
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:14,449
- Who authorised this?
- l have no recollection...Senator.

806
01:31:19,382 --> 01:31:23,572
l did not sign up for somebody's
bullshit political agenda.

807
01:31:23,572 --> 01:31:27,531
Who authorised this? Cutter?

808
01:31:27,531 --> 01:31:31,051
Cutter couldn't tie his shoes
without permission.

809
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:38,635
- lf l go down, you're going with me.
- Wrong again.

810
01:31:38,635 --> 01:31:42,189
l have an autographed
''Get Out of Jail Free'' card.

811
01:31:44,086 --> 01:31:48,210
''The President authorises
the Deputy Director ClA, Robert Ritter,

812
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:53,590
''to conduct Operation Reciprocity
including all support necessary.

813
01:31:53,590 --> 01:32:00,046
''This operation is deemed important
to the national security of the US.''

814
01:32:02,007 --> 01:32:06,317
You don't have one of these,
do you, Jack?

815
01:32:15,095 --> 01:32:19,917
Grey! The world's grey, Jack!

816
01:32:50,968 --> 01:32:55,856
You have any idea how l am going to
get out of this mess?

817
01:32:55,856 --> 01:32:58,992
Absolutely none.

818
01:33:07,321 --> 01:33:10,998
Yeah. This is he.

819
01:33:14,809 --> 01:33:16,435
When?

820
01:33:20,922 --> 01:33:21,642
James?

821
01:33:24,506 --> 01:33:26,644
Thank you.

822
01:33:26,644 --> 01:33:34,131
Admiral James Greer devoted his life
to his country and his family.

823
01:33:34,131 --> 01:33:38,259
Giving selflessly
of both his wisdom and his love.

824
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:43,127
He served his country
for more than 50 years.

825
01:33:43,127 --> 01:33:48,276
Enlisting in the Navy at 17.
Graduating from the Academy.

826
01:33:48,276 --> 01:33:51,890
Achieving three stars for his flag.

827
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:55,636
He lived through tumultuous events
in his country's life.

828
01:33:55,636 --> 01:34:00,025
He participated in them.
He made them clearer to the rest of us,

829
01:34:00,025 --> 01:34:06,352
with his knowledge, his honesty,
his integrity and his courage.

830
01:34:15,131 --> 01:34:16,822
l can't see them, but l know they're there.

831
01:34:17,626 --> 01:34:20,823
Five kilometres due east
from your position.

832
01:34:25,531 --> 01:34:28,914
Keep pushing forward. We will trap them.

833
01:34:28,914 --> 01:34:32,247
Never was he deluded
into thinking that one man...

834
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:35,514
...could solve the ills of the world.

835
01:34:35,514 --> 01:34:40,182
Always the soldier, on the battlefields
of the South Pacific, Korea...

836
01:34:40,182 --> 01:34:44,821
...Vietnam and Washington,
he fought as part of a unit...

837
01:34:45,436 --> 01:34:47,224
... to preserve the ideals...

838
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:48,729
Knife, this is Variable.

839
01:34:48,729 --> 01:34:50,714
...of his nation.

840
01:34:50,714 --> 01:34:53,723
Knife! This is Variable. Over.

841
01:34:54,652 --> 01:34:58,581
To the refuge of the earth,
we entrust our friend's body.

842
01:34:59,036 --> 01:35:03,259
To the protection of our God
in Heaven, we entrust his soul.

843
01:35:03,259 --> 01:35:07,795
To ourselves, we entrust his spirit...

844
01:35:07,795 --> 01:35:11,477
...and the principles he lived by.

845
01:35:11,477 --> 01:35:13,499
We're going to miss you, James.

846
01:35:35,389 --> 01:35:36,982
Variable, this is Knife, over.

847
01:35:38,269 --> 01:35:41,236
Variable, this is Knife, over.

848
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:44,754
Variable, l am not receiving.
We are under heavy attack.

849
01:35:44,754 --> 01:35:48,057
Need air support, over.

850
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:12,087
Variable, this is Knife, over! Switch!

851
01:36:43,327 --> 01:36:47,157
Variable, this is Knife!
Where the hell are you?!

852
01:37:07,776 --> 01:37:11,998
On behalf of a grateful nation,
our condolences.

853
01:37:11,998 --> 01:37:15,226
- He was a very great patriot.
- Thank you.

854
01:37:52,385 --> 01:37:56,541
- Hello?
- Jean Fowler for Dr Jack Ryan.

855
01:37:56,541 --> 01:38:00,001
Jack? You have got to hear this.

856
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:02,495
Picked it up this morning.

857
01:38:02,495 --> 01:38:08,374
Variable, this is Knife.
We are under attack, need air support.

858
01:38:08,374 --> 01:38:11,611
Variable, this is Knife,
where the hell are you?

859
01:38:12,258 --> 01:38:15,160
Jack, what do you want me
to do with this?

860
01:38:16,129 --> 01:38:20,505
Make a copy, Jean. Make ten copies.

861
01:38:20,505 --> 01:38:23,488
Get them to me
as quick as you can. Thanks.

862
01:38:26,017 --> 01:38:30,174
Jesus. They're going to leave
those guys down there.

863
01:39:11,747 --> 01:39:17,344
He's on American 915.
He will be in Bogota 7.50 p.m.

864
01:39:29,156 --> 01:39:30,978
-Yeah?
- lt's Ritter.

865
01:39:30,978 --> 01:39:34,784
- Where the fuck have you been?
- We have a problem.

866
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:37,566
We have got a disaster!
l can't get through to my men.

867
01:39:38,148 --> 01:39:41,312
We had to shut down the satellite link.

868
01:39:43,076 --> 01:39:45,345
- Clark?
- You had to what?

869
01:39:47,172 --> 01:39:52,889
lt's Ryan. He found out everything.
He threatened to tell Congress

870
01:39:53,188 --> 01:39:56,003
if we didn't shut down the operation.

871
01:39:56,003 --> 01:40:01,467
OK. lt's shut down. Just give me
some air and my men are out of there.

872
01:40:02,757 --> 01:40:09,315
Clark, maybe you're not hearing me.
There is no air. We are shut down.

873
01:40:10,564 --> 01:40:13,980
l am on a plane. l am going to kill him.

874
01:40:15,205 --> 01:40:16,514
Ritter?

875
01:40:19,045 --> 01:40:21,380
He's coming to you.

876
01:40:21,797 --> 01:40:25,343
American Airlines at 19.50
with no security.

877
01:40:25,343 --> 01:40:29,885
- Who is this?
- National Security Advisor Cutter.

878
01:40:29,885 --> 01:40:32,509
Once Ryan's gone, we're back on line.

879
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:34,786
You understand?

880
01:40:36,166 --> 01:40:38,206
Yes, sir.

881
01:41:55,944 --> 01:41:57,253
Clark...

882
01:41:57,253 --> 01:41:59,074
- Jesus!
- Get in the van.

883
01:41:59,074 --> 01:42:03,615
- Don't do this, l came to find you.
- You found me. Get in.

884
01:42:07,816 --> 01:42:09,442
Behind the wheel.

885
01:42:10,888 --> 01:42:12,295
Clark...

886
01:42:13,704 --> 01:42:15,362
Drive.

887
01:42:42,217 --> 01:42:44,705
- Ritter.
- Ryan's dead.

888
01:42:46,697 --> 01:42:47,697
How?

889
01:42:48,841 --> 01:42:51,841
l killed him. Turn the satellite back on.

890
01:42:55,209 --> 01:42:59,781
You said get rid of Ryan
and we're back in business, right?

891
01:43:23,946 --> 01:43:25,888
What the hell are you doing here?

892
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:31,236
l came to help you get those guys out.

893
01:43:32,811 --> 01:43:35,298
What can you do to help me?

894
01:43:40,747 --> 01:43:43,594
What do you need?

895
01:43:43,594 --> 01:43:45,064
A helicopter.

896
01:43:47,243 --> 01:43:49,130
A helicopter.

897
01:43:57,931 --> 01:43:59,208
No, thank you.

898
01:44:02,059 --> 01:44:04,994
- ls this ''Happy Hour''?
- lt's always ''Happy Hour''.

899
01:44:04,994 --> 01:44:08,676
- Your pilot owns this joint?
- He lives here.

900
01:44:14,284 --> 01:44:15,560
Here he is.

901
01:44:26,476 --> 01:44:30,884
Morning. l am here to rent the Huey.

902
01:44:30,884 --> 01:44:35,013
Sorry, we don't rent it any more.
But it is for sale.

903
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:38,409
How much is it?

904
01:44:39,756 --> 01:44:42,058
Two million dollars.

905
01:44:47,628 --> 01:44:50,149
My pilot and l would
have to do a test flight.

906
01:44:50,149 --> 01:44:53,164
Of course.
You just have to leave a deposit.

907
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:56,744
How much is that?

908
01:44:56,744 --> 01:44:58,337
Two million dollars.

909
01:45:03,853 --> 01:45:06,668
Would you take a company cheque?

910
01:45:13,325 --> 01:45:14,754
Yes.

911
01:45:22,381 --> 01:45:25,927
- Here we go.
- Big son of a bitch, ain't she?

912
01:45:28,077 --> 01:45:32,168
- Do you have any time in this type?
- Nine o'clock.

913
01:45:41,838 --> 01:45:47,751
- Get out of my chopper.
- No. My chopper. Let's go.

914
01:46:07,438 --> 01:46:10,438
Their last communication put them here.

915
01:46:11,663 --> 01:46:16,519
The closest extraction point is here.
ln this gorge.

916
01:46:17,390 --> 01:46:19,049
l got it.

917
01:46:38,192 --> 01:46:41,388
- ls that a body down there?
- Yes.

918
01:46:43,344 --> 01:46:46,726
- One of ours?
- One of mine.

919
01:46:50,128 --> 01:46:54,187
Find a place to set her down.
We will look for the others.

920
01:47:36,049 --> 01:47:40,719
Nowhere to run to. No place to hide.

921
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:46,348
Blood trails everywhere.
They all lead to the river.

922
01:47:58,449 --> 01:48:02,410
These are the falls we saw from the air.

923
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:06,026
The bodies should be
about 50 metres down.

924
01:48:17,843 --> 01:48:22,577
You left us!
You left us with no support at all!

925
01:48:22,577 --> 01:48:26,863
You left us out to dry!
You son of a bitch!

926
01:48:29,522 --> 01:48:32,817
- lt's not his fault.
- Whose fault is it?

927
01:48:34,738 --> 01:48:36,015
lt's my fault.

928
01:48:41,363 --> 01:48:43,337
lt's my fault.

929
01:48:54,932 --> 01:48:58,707
l was on point
when the last attack came.

930
01:48:59,667 --> 01:49:01,707
Over a mile away.

931
01:49:02,867 --> 01:49:05,103
By the time l got back it was over.

932
01:49:06,452 --> 01:49:09,485
They were taken to Captain Rosso.

933
01:49:10,611 --> 01:49:13,230
The others?

934
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:15,021
l buried them.

935
01:49:23,764 --> 01:49:25,553
Road to the town.

936
01:49:25,553 --> 01:49:28,945
They loaded the prisoners here.
Blood everywhere.

937
01:49:28,945 --> 01:49:32,818
- God knows where they are now.
- Escobedo knows.

938
01:49:32,818 --> 01:49:36,145
What are you going to do?
Knock on his door?

939
01:49:42,517 --> 01:49:47,274
Morning. l'd like to see Ernesto
Escobedo. l don't have an appointment.

940
01:50:00,277 --> 01:50:01,027
OK.

941
01:50:04,021 --> 01:50:05,810
Hands up.

942
01:50:06,485 --> 01:50:08,557
Hands up!

943
01:50:09,845 --> 01:50:11,700
Wallet.

944
01:50:16,309 --> 01:50:17,870
lt's a tape recorder.

945
01:50:22,422 --> 01:50:24,396
He's in.

946
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:30,288
Bird, this is Variable, over.

947
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:35,602
Bird, this is Variable, over.

948
01:50:51,318 --> 01:50:54,766
Dr Ryan... Come in.

949
01:51:08,183 --> 01:51:11,728
Sit down. What can l do for you?

950
01:51:13,079 --> 01:51:18,862
l didn't know who else to turn to.
l have a problem.

951
01:51:19,735 --> 01:51:23,281
An associate of mine,
a coffee buyer and his assistant

952
01:51:23,281 --> 01:51:26,131
were on a business trip in this area.

953
01:51:26,131 --> 01:51:29,874
They disappeared yesterday.
l am very concerned.

954
01:51:29,874 --> 01:51:32,244
Coffee buyer?

955
01:51:32,244 --> 01:51:34,961
lt's very important to me to find them.

956
01:51:34,961 --> 01:51:38,292
Coffee buying is becoming
a dangerous business.

957
01:51:39,544 --> 01:51:44,498
Yes. Well, it was for Peter Hardin.

958
01:51:46,872 --> 01:51:50,353
- Who?
- He was a client of Lindo Coffee.

959
01:51:50,353 --> 01:51:55,277
- Lindo Coffee has many clients.
- You must have heard of this one.

960
01:51:55,277 --> 01:51:58,864
He owed your company
a great deal of money.

961
01:51:58,864 --> 01:52:02,993
l will have to talk to Accounting about that.

962
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,549
650 million dollars.

963
01:52:09,561 --> 01:52:11,700
And change.

964
01:52:13,081 --> 01:52:18,132
Are you offering to help me
with the collection of an unpaid debt?

965
01:52:18,132 --> 01:52:21,079
- No.
- What are you offering?

966
01:52:22,489 --> 01:52:27,061
A trade. Felix Cortez has sold you out.

967
01:52:27,061 --> 01:52:31,316
He will murder you and your family,
and take over the cartel.

968
01:52:31,316 --> 01:52:33,270
Where's my tape recorder?

969
01:52:39,609 --> 01:52:41,333
Play the tape.

970
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:15,412
Let's move.

971
01:53:44,123 --> 01:53:47,385
l'd like you to meet
my new friend, Dr Ryan.

972
01:53:47,385 --> 01:53:50,646
A doctor? Why? ls somebody sick?

973
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:05,115
What does he want?

974
01:54:07,195 --> 01:54:10,578
The safe return of his associates.

975
01:54:10,578 --> 01:54:14,774
And what does he offer us in return?

976
01:54:14,774 --> 01:54:15,774
You.

977
01:54:22,876 --> 01:54:26,870
Whatever this man has told you is a lie.
He lies for a living.

978
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:31,412
He's in the intelligence business.
You're in the intelligence business!

979
01:54:37,724 --> 01:54:40,441
You have taken care of the little fish.

980
01:54:40,441 --> 01:54:42,743
l will take care of the one that got away.

981
01:54:43,261 --> 01:54:47,898
Once Escobedo is gone,
l will be in a position to help you.

982
01:54:47,898 --> 01:54:52,022
So, the question is...

983
01:54:53,277 --> 01:54:55,513
...what am l supposed to do with you?

984
01:54:58,974 --> 01:55:01,624
l guess l am supposed to
kill you with this bat!

985
01:55:10,174 --> 01:55:12,028
Get up.

986
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:20,732
Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions, no more violence...

987
01:55:20,732 --> 01:55:22,901
You will have your victory.

988
01:55:24,574 --> 01:55:27,160
ln return for what?

989
01:56:05,151 --> 01:56:07,006
- Where are they?
- They're here.

990
01:56:09,727 --> 01:56:13,502
The American killed Ernesto! Let's go!

991
01:56:59,712 --> 01:57:01,851
Bird to Variable. Over.

992
01:57:14,754 --> 01:57:19,260
Bird, this is Variable.
Where the hell are you?

993
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:22,873
l am cruising about five klicks
south of the village.

994
01:57:23,617 --> 01:57:28,124
- Stay there. l will get back to you.
- Roger that.

995
01:57:39,426 --> 01:57:41,760
- No one.
- The prisoners!

996
01:58:26,595 --> 01:58:29,214
Come on, guys. Let's go, son.

997
01:58:30,787 --> 01:58:32,576
We're going home, boys.

998
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:45,788
Pick us up at the Lindo Coffee factory.

999
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:22,270
Not only can l expose you
to the press, so can the soldiers.

1000
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:28,769
Do you want to take your chances
with the courts and the reporters?

1001
02:01:28,769 --> 02:01:32,798
To end the political career
of your commander-in-chief?

1002
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:17,733
Let's go!

1003
02:02:43,914 --> 02:02:47,460
Get your asses in here!
Come on, we got to go!

1004
02:02:50,282 --> 02:02:51,242
Come on!

1005
02:02:58,666 --> 02:03:01,252
Hold it! We wait for Ryan!

1006
02:03:01,252 --> 02:03:02,881
Yeah? We're out of here!

1007
02:03:09,995 --> 02:03:12,810
Set it down! He's down there!

1008
02:03:24,908 --> 02:03:26,850
Come on!

1009
02:03:44,716 --> 02:03:46,277
l have got you!

1010
02:03:53,004 --> 02:03:54,947
Chavez, cover me!

1011
02:04:03,788 --> 02:04:05,730
Your hand. Give me your hand!

1012
02:05:10,094 --> 02:05:12,964
The President will see you now.

1013
02:05:24,782 --> 02:05:27,630
Jack! l am glad you're here.

1014
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:32,901
Sit down. Can l get you anything?

1015
02:05:32,901 --> 02:05:33,651
No.

1016
02:05:35,599 --> 02:05:39,723
- Come on, sit down.
- l would prefer to stand, sir.

1017
02:05:42,063 --> 02:05:47,976
Some things have gone on here
that l am just becoming aware of.

1018
02:05:47,976 --> 02:05:52,202
l was kept in the dark, as you were,
for a very long time.

1019
02:05:52,202 --> 02:05:55,498
- Troubling things.
- Yeah.

1020
02:05:55,498 --> 02:05:59,820
Now we have to sort them out,
figure out who's responsible for what.

1021
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:03,628
And what to do about it.
And we have to do it delicately,

1022
02:06:03,628 --> 02:06:06,509
otherwise people might
get the wrong idea.

1023
02:06:07,792 --> 02:06:09,068
We have to lie.

1024
02:06:11,088 --> 02:06:15,278
- Did l say that?
- No, you didn't.

1025
02:06:15,278 --> 02:06:18,921
- You're upset.
- l am upset.

1026
02:06:18,921 --> 02:06:24,239
lt's understandable. Do you mind
if l give you a bit of advice?

1027
02:06:24,239 --> 02:06:26,767
Of course, you know this. You're smart.

1028
02:06:26,767 --> 02:06:30,244
Never make important decisions
while you're upset.

1029
02:06:31,184 --> 02:06:36,335
You did. American soldiers and
innocent civilians are dead because of it.

1030
02:06:36,335 --> 02:06:40,523
- l never ordered any...
- Don't you play that game with me!

1031
02:06:40,523 --> 02:06:44,431
Do not dishonour their memories
by pretending you didn't know!

1032
02:06:44,431 --> 02:06:48,008
- How dare you lecture me!
- How dare you, sir!

1033
02:06:48,008 --> 02:06:52,138
How dare you come here and bark at me
like some little junkyard dog!

1034
02:06:52,138 --> 02:06:55,338
l am the President of the United States!

1035
02:06:59,217 --> 02:07:01,967
lt gives me no pleasure to do it, sir.

1036
02:07:02,929 --> 02:07:05,929
As acting Deputy Director
of lntelligence, it is my duty

1037
02:07:05,929 --> 02:07:09,840
to report this matter
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

1038
02:07:14,673 --> 02:07:20,173
- You're not going to do that.
- l am not?

1039
02:07:22,546 --> 02:07:26,158
You have got yourself
a chip in the big game now.

1040
02:07:27,538 --> 02:07:32,906
You're going to save that for a time
when your own ass is on the line.

1041
02:07:33,459 --> 02:07:36,328
And then you're going to pull it out.

1042
02:07:36,328 --> 02:07:40,524
And l am going to cash it in for you.
Right?

1043
02:07:42,514 --> 02:07:45,809
l don't think l have anything more
to say to you, sir.

1044
02:07:47,155 --> 02:07:52,370
The country can't afford another
scandal, Jack. To protect itself,

1045
02:07:52,370 --> 02:07:57,997
it won't allow another deception
that goes all the way to the top.

1046
02:07:57,997 --> 02:08:01,993
You will take the blame.
Cutter and Ritter will take some too,

1047
02:08:01,993 --> 02:08:05,262
but it will only amount to
a slap on the wrist.

1048
02:08:05,262 --> 02:08:09,257
Then 20,000 dollars an hour
on the lecture circuit.

1049
02:08:10,387 --> 02:08:14,316
The rest of the blame will fall on Greer.

1050
02:08:14,316 --> 02:08:18,029
Oh yeah, you will take him down with you.

1051
02:08:18,029 --> 02:08:20,203
You will destroy his reputation.

1052
02:08:20,788 --> 02:08:26,155
But that's as far as it will go.
The old Potomac two-step, Jack.

1053
02:08:28,980 --> 02:08:32,526
l am sorry, Mr President, l don't dance.

1054
02:08:55,028 --> 02:08:57,036
Ryan, have you got a minute?

1055
02:08:57,036 --> 02:08:57,786
No.

1056
02:08:59,893 --> 02:09:02,576
We need to talk!

1057
02:09:02,576 --> 02:09:04,628
Ryan!

1058
02:09:27,925 --> 02:09:33,359
The Committee will come to order.
The chair will now call Dr John Ryan.

1059
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:59,059
Dr Ryan, thank you for appearing
before the Committee today.

1060
02:09:59,830 --> 02:10:02,416
Please stand and raise your right hand.

1061
02:10:06,134 --> 02:10:09,931
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you're about to give

1062
02:10:09,931 --> 02:10:14,259
is the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1063
02:10:17,399 --> 02:10:19,253
l do.

1064
02:10:20,343 --> 02:10:24,402
Dr Ryan, you may consider yourself
under oath. Please be seated.
