1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,722
...a matter of establishing
what this is.

2
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,221
If indeed this was an act of terrorism,
then who caused it?

3
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,771
All of the electricity
across the entire Eastern Seaboard is out.

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,020
People ordered to stay
indoors until further notice and to...

5
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,776
is nothing short
of apocalyptic.

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,575
Metropolitan areas,
in addition to Chicago,

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,198
are completely surrounded.

8
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,239
We're still awaiting
an official announcement,

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,792
but Congress is believed to
have accepted unconditionally

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,915
all terms of armistice offered.

11
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,419
And with power restored
in the last few hours,

12
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,420
- martial law...
- This is taking too long.

13
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,674
Now all US military forces
are returning to their bases

14
00:00:55,764 --> 00:01:00,099
with orders to turn in arms
and stand down until further orders...

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,388
Reports are spreading now
from Tokyo, Jakarta, Rome.

16
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,689
Contact with outside news sources
has been sporadic

17
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,393
since the devastating failure
of the Trenton power grid,

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,319
but eyewitnesses confirm...

19
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,649
that the majority of international
governments appear to comply...

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,696
Officer, I need to get up north.

21
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,660
Where you going, Detective?

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,241
You not get orders?

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,873
Stop the car. Stop the car.

24
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,533
Take your hands off the wheel.

25
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,617
Stop the engine.

26
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,123
- Oh, my...
- Stop the car!

27
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,884
Appear to have followed the US' lead

28
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:40,716
and are entering into negotiations
with this first wave of Legislator forces.

29
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,770
Look, should we call the school?
There may be a plan.

30
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,724
I'm not rolling over! We need to get out
and regroup, then fight back.

31
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,568
John!

32
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,238
John.

33
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,253
Turn around.

34
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,048
Turn around!

35
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,088
Come on, John.

36
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,631
The shutdown was very orderly.

37
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,932
There's been
a sort of a level of cooperation

38
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,099
that you can see here.

39
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,815
I love you, Rula.

40
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,739
Another reminder
to avoid Lake Shore Drive

41
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,114
if you're not one of the lucky thousands
invited to tonight's unity celebration.

42
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,288
This event has been in the works
for the better part of a year,

43
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,957
with Mayor Ed Lee expected to attend.

44
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,705
All signs are pointing to this...

45
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,804
You ever see the sun set
on the other side of the lake?

46
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,426
No. The sun sets this side, dummy.
West side.

47
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,552
Yeah.

48
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,930
I know.

49
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,649
I'll come and see you later, all right?

50
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,108
Hey, yo.

51
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,189
Boat's all ready, man,

52
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,069
so you pull this off today,
we're out of here.

53
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,901
Hey, cool it.

54
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,612
Got eyes on me 24-7.

55
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,745
No shit. Check her out, up there.

56
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,371
Yo, every day,
that witch be watching me like clockwork.

57
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,119
Hey, I see a rat.

58
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,920
Narc!

59
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,392
Let's go.

60
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,820
- Your bro's a legend, man.
- Yo, come on.

61
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,648
When's the last time you seen one?

62
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,269
A roach?

63
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,692
A long time ago. Come on, man, let's go.
Look, I can't be late today.

64
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,153
I should break in like your brother did
and bulldoze that whole ant heap.

65
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,080
They can't hide down there forever, man.

66
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,257
I'll be ready in a minute.

67
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,670
I don't have much time.

68
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,840
But I wanted to see you.

69
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,806
Well, then we'd better get
business out of the way.

70
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,322
I can't do this.

71
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,620
Let's go to bed.

72
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,962
What are we doing? This is a mistake.

73
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,086
There's no such thing as a mistake.
There's only fate.

74
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,258
- You're a cop. You won't get caught.
- I'm sorry.

75
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,431
Wait. Wait.

76
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,052
You forgot what you came here for.

77
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,866
Beware Greeks bearing gifts.

78
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,758
- I got a secondhand ID.
- So the Eagle has landed?

79
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,388
Phoenix. You should pay attention.

80
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,937
You got a visual?
Secondhand is secondhand.

81
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,390
You still got authorization from below?

82
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,849
They're planning something big.

83
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,480
They don't exist.

84
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,400
That's what we said about aliens.

85
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,821
That's funny.

86
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,985
Remember Wicker Park?

87
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,162
Yeah, the roaches fucked them into dust.
They're gone.

88
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,330
Don't use that word.

89
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,703
What?

90
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,539
Since when has this become
your personal work space?

91
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,621
The resistance wasn't wiped out
after Wicker Park.

92
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,798
They went to ground. I figured it out.

93
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,714
They're communicating
through the classifieds.

94
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:31,224
Their network regrouped here in Pilsen,
right under our noses.

95
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,893
You got nothing that shows that.

96
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,478
These... These are memorials.

97
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,728
Legislators got 'em all.
You're searching for ghosts, Bill.

98
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,435
If we don't act now,
we're facing a full-blown insurgency.

99
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,021
I suggest you keep that idea to yourself.

100
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,903
Well, too late.
Already kicked it downstairs.

101
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,483
It's on the commissioner's desk.

102
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,034
Why did you do that?

103
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,200
They're not gone.

104
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,848
- You weren't followed?
- No.

105
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,269
Training's over.

106
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,111
And you back this?

107
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,530
I back Number One.

108
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,494
The way to the Closed Zone
is through Soldier Field.

109
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,705
Team goes tonight.

110
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,867
It's Soldier Field.

111
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:21,952
The Unity Rally?

112
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,457
Get what you need from Barbosa.

113
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,505
Soldier Field
is miles from the Closed Zone.

114
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,582
- How's that get us back inside?
- I'm trusting you.

115
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,005
- He'll deliver.
- He has to. Today's the day.

116
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,608
Gabriel Drummond, 7:04 a.m.

117
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,133
Oh, there it goes.
There it goes...

118
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,060
Oh, it's over. It's a squeaker.

119
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,185
That was a matter of a minute and a half.

120
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,772
Walk around,
take a look from other angles.

121
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,043
Fifteen minutes.

122
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,972
Another reminder
to avoid Lake Shore Drive

123
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,552
if you're not one of the lucky thousands
invited to tonight's unity celebration.

124
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,513

125
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,019
with Mayor Ed Lee expected to attend.

126
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,023
All signs are pointing to this being
one of those rare occasions

127
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,320
when the Legislators
might just make an appearance.

128
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,775
Traffic's being routed
around Soldier Field,

129
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,484
and folks are showing up early.

130
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,195
What a night here this is.

131
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,160
Lots to celebrate. Another reminder...

132
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,240
You got it or what?

133
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,200
If you're not
one of the lucky thousands

134
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,286
invited to tonight's unity celebration.

135
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,497

141
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,104
What a night here this is.
Lots to celebrate.

142
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,180
Here.

143
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,193
Another reminder
to avoid Lake Shore Drive

144
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,566
if you're not one
of the lucky thousands...

145
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,272
Hope you put it to good use.

146
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,158
This event has been in the works
for the better part of a year.

147
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,953
All signs are pointing to this being

148
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,997
when the Legislators
might just make an appearance.

149
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,952
Please.

150
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,334
I haven't done anything.

151
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,300
- I haven't done anything.
- Hey. Hey, leave her alone.

152
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,385
Please, can we just...

153
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,624
Off-planet transport...

154
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,367
Hey, hurry up, bro.
You got to check this out.

155
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,917
All she needs is gas.

156
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,422
- Damn, yo.
- Right?

157
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,251
She's fast too.

158
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,670
Got to be to get past what's out there,

159
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,507
but there's no checkpoint,
so we get to the other side,

160
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,596
and it's freedom, baby.

161
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,310
Let's hope so.

162
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,805
So, did you get the cigarette?

163
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,234
- Of course I got it.
- Shit, then we're out of here.

164
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,527
Yo, I'm about to come like Scarface
on these roaches.

165
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,615
I'm not going down without a fight.

166
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,207
Yo, what did you trade for that?

167
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,956
Straight cash, and it's fully loaded.

168
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,583
Oh, the cash we need for gas?

169
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,129
Chill, man. It's an investment.

170
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,130
Why are you always trippin', man?

171
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,803
People are jonesing
for what we got out here!

172
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,927
What, you think you in
the big leagues now, Jurgis, huh?

173
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,009
Yo, that shit right there
will get us in some serious trouble.

174
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,686
I'm sick of this hand-to-mouth hustling.

175
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:56,763
You think I'm not?

176
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,850
- I got to go, man.
- Go?

177
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,235
- We're partners, man. Any...
- Partners?

178
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,567
Man, I take the risk.

179
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,778
I saw someone get taken today.

180
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,950
Yeah, well, I'm out here hustling,
closing the deals,

181
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,153
while you're at the crib
just kicking back, chilling, huh?

182
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,330
Look, I got to take care
of myself and Rula.

183
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,328
You and Rula?

184
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,707
All right, man, fine.

185
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,539
Have your side piece. I'll go solo.

186
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,249
I'm not playing with you, Jurgis.

187
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,171
- Hey, come on. Chill, chill.
- Yo, I'm not...

188
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,502
Hey, hey, hey, chill, yo.

189
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,046
Shit!

190
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,322
Get in the car.

191
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,848
Special Branch
ain't got nothing better to do?

192
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,103
From your local.

193
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,439
What do you want?

194
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,400
What do you know about Phoenix?

195
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,449
I'm not one of your narcs.

196
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,995
What are you doing down here, Gabriel?

197
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,198
You're lucky to have your job.

198
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,829
I didn't ask you for it.

199
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,752
I don't want you winding up
like your brother.

200
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,170
- You mean dead?
- I mean on the wrong side.

201
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,040
It runs in the family.

202
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,966
You have no right
to be talking about my family.

203
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,384
Your dad was my partner.

204
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,805
I have a responsibility to that.

205
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,184
You have a choice to make yourself.

206
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,637
Don't make the wrong one.

207
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,102
Get out of here.

208
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:43,763
You got my money?

209
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,475
Hey, let's do this. I got the cigarette.

210
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,822
Hey, hey, hey. You said to bring it here.

211
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,366
Get in.

212
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,196
Yo, I'm just trying to get paid, man.

213
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,161
- No, I'm not getting in, no.
- Come on.

214
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,543
Hey, hey, hey.

215
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,207
Hey, yo, look, man.

216
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,460
Man, you came to me, remember?

217
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,967
- Put this on.
- Yo, what is this?

218
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:19,932
Yo, what is this?

219
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,474
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

220
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,102
Yo. No one said nothing
about going nowhere.

221
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,188
Get out.

222
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,402
Follow me.

223
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,280
Let's go.

224
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,264
Wicker Park.

225
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,891
What are we doing here?

226
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,110
You want to get paid, don't you?

227
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,240
That jacket's still too big for you.

228
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,424
Baby brother.

229
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,768
What happened?

230
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,148
Before we could get the roaches,
they got us.

231
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,150
I'm the only one that made it out.

232
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,859
Wait, your...

233
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,692
Your bug...

234
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,402
- Where's it at?
- Gone.

235
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,077
- No, that's impossible.
- A few of us are off the grid now.

236
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,623
- Few of who?
- I don't know the others.

237
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,122
The others don't know me.
It's better that way.

238
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,581
I don't exist anymore.

239
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,958
In some ways, I am dead.

240
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,676
You couldn't come find me?

241
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:52,228
I wanted to, but there's narcs everywhere.
You know that. Even in Pilsen.

242
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,020
The Drummond brothers are back.

243
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,772
For good. I'm dialed in, Rafe.

244
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,197
My friend, he lives by the lakeshore.
He has this boat.

245
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,318
- We have this plan and...
- G.

246
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,649
We're gonna go across the lake...

247
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,956
This... is the plan.

248
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,625
I knew you'd get it.

249
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,670
So, what'd I get you?

250
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,380
Information.

251
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,177
Information for who?

252
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,134
Only Number One knows.

253
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,721
Number One?

254
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,805
Who the hell is that?

255
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,640
No one knows. It's like I told you.

256
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,854
It's better that way.

257
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,902
Bad times coming.

258
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,828
Here. This will help you get out.

259
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,913
Go to the lake house.

260
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,747
Not next week, not tomorrow. Now.

261
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,496
- Before it get dark.
- Come with me.

262
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,548
Not again, Rafe. Not again!

263
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,254
We just got to take care of ourselves.

264
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,214
What'd Dad say
the day we tried to get out?

265
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,100
Regroup. Fight back.

266
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,595
- And he dead now.
- Watch your mouth.

267
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,397
Let the roaches come and take
what they want if they want it so bad.

268
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,019
And we can start all over, Rafe.

269
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,067
We can get back to the way
that things used to be.

270
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,360
Don't you get it?

271
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,400
Harmony, peace, unity...
It's all bullshit.

272
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,368
It's a lie, Gabe.
They gonna take everything.

273
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,113
In a few years,
they'll have stripped us to nothing.

274
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,706
Got one more chance to light a fire
big enough so the whole world can see.

275
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:48,090
To prove to everybody out there
that the roaches can be beat.

276
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,546
Light a match.

277
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,431
Ignite a war.

278
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,053
Long as we fight back, we got a chance.

279
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,434
Why you always got to be the hero?

280
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,019
You got to pick a side.

281
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,978
You got to pick a side, Gabe.
One day, you have to, or this is it.

282
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,526
You got to go.

283
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,911
Gabe, when this is all over,

284
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,422
I'll find you.

285
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,416
I promise.

286
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,794
You just got to go.

287
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,172
Now.

288
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,758
Got him.

289
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,785
Baby, what's going on?

290
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:22,990
We're getting out.

291
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,788
Okay.

292
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,630
Well, before we do that,
why don't we just...

293
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,802
Grab this.
And take only what you can carry.

294
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,671
What did you do?

295
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,303
There's gonna be some trouble.

296
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,765
Gabriel, what is that supposed to mean?

297
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,264
What, come on, you're freaking me out.

298
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:49,934
Rafe...

299
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,102
is alive.

300
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:54,939
Your brother?

301
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,073
Yeah.

302
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:58,901
Nice try, Gabriel.

303
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,041
What did he say? Where did you see him?

304
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,586
That's about enough
to last us a couple weeks.

305
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,835
After that,
we're gonna have to make it on our own.

306
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,916
No, we won't make it past
the first checkpoint.

307
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,421
Not if we go across the lake.

308
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,086
I've got a boat that we can use.

309
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,672
There's nothing over there.
There's no law. It's dangerous.

310
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,927
You're not listening to me.

311
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,808
They're planning something.

312
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,560
Okay, and if we go, we are involved.
No way.

313
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,854
- Baby, baby. Come on.
- No.

314
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,983
Gabriel, if you want to keep me safe,
you need to stay.

315
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,235
Please.

316
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,611
- No, I can't.
- No, Gabriel.

317
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,413
- I can't, I can't.
- Gabriel, this is crazy.

318
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,739
Please, let's talk about this!

319
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,417
Type this. Send it to PDHQ. Fast.

320
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,053
Move!

321
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,366
- Can they track us?
- No. I got a few mirror IPs.

322
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,432
Got him. There's your target.

323
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,639
Consider yourself
as informed as Special Branch.

324
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,352
So, who is he?

325
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,402
Just another collaborator.
Mayor's deputy.

326
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,607
No, no.

327
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:15,694
Who is he?

328
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,949
He carries the bomb.

329
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,724
- Classifieds.
- Got room for one more?

330
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,667
One more.

331
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:07,746
The late edition?

332
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,881
They proofread the scratch till 3:30.

333
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,302
Real important, Rittenhouse.

334
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,718
Yeah. Thank you.

335
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,478
This is a request going out.

336
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,375
Hi.

337
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,354
Who wants to go first?

338
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,599
Get him off the table.

339
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,726
Next. Hurry.

340
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,057
Get her in here.

341
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,647
His heart rate went below the limit
and distressed his bug.

342
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,324
Drones are maternal to all bugs.
We have to get yours out now.

343
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:02,999
Got it.

344
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,341
Don't move. I'll stitch you up.

345
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,497
All right.

346
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:46,259
These three bugs are the three insiders.
Heart attack, cancer, unlucky car wreck.

347
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,211
Downtown folks, spotless records.

348
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,172
The other three are good enough
for your drivers.

349
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,427
I need two now.

350
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,301
All right, my shift ends
at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

351
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,432
That's the latest
I can log them in as deceased.

352
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,230
That's as long as they're good for.
They get ID'd after that, they're it.

353
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,023
You're gonna need these plates
to keep the bugs down in their mouth.

354
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,449
Semper fi, Sergeant.

355
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,448
I always did believe in life after death.

356
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,711
Is that you, Father?

357
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,172
Come on back.

358
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,306
What you got me?

359
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,433
The last of it.

360
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,153
Wait here.

361
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,332
Now, I assume I don't have to
tell you what they'll do

362
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,462
if they find this on your person.

363
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,964
Where'd you get this?

364
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,135
Their ship crashed too.

365
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,390
Attaches best to natural fiber,
human hair, cotton or wool,

366
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,888
but because it's not chemically based,
it's undetectable to scanners.

367
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,470
Because it's organic,
it passes through all security.

368
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:03,896
You can smuggle this in anywhere.

369
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,857
And when you arm it, it's a chameleon.

370
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,646
How do we arm it?

371
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,271
Double tap gives you about 60 seconds.

372
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,066
Drivers are downstairs.

373
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:54,791
Holy hell.

374
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,292
Take that off.

375
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,505
You may as well be wearing a target.

376
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,431
All right, these implants get logged
as deceased at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

377
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:10,936
After that, you're dead to the world.

378
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,769
You know what happens to Pilsen
if they correctly ID us.

379
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,614
Any contact, before and after,
with any friends or family

380
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,486
puts the entire operation at risk.

381
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,281
Remember...

382
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,249
he gets us to them.

383
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,091
No one gets taken alive.

384
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,107
Okay.

385
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,569
You ready? Here we go.

386
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,162
Courage.

387
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,691
- Make a right out of here.
- I got it.

388
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,042
People of Chicago...

389
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:07,682
welcome to a special night
of coming together,

390
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,759
of sharing.

391
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:14,226
And tonight, we have
some very special guests joining us.

392
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:19,360
Before first contact,
our political system was broken.

393
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,318
We were fighting among ourselves
in the halls of Congress

394
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,650
and on the streets of this great city,

395
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,031
slowly bleeding to death.

396
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:31,034
And we needed change.

397
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,334
We needed someone to show us a better way.

398
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,041
Well, the facts speak for themselves.

399
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,963
Natural resource production
has increased tenfold.

400
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:49,174
Employment is at record levels.
Crime at an all-time low.

401
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,139
Pays to play the game.

402
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:56,098
And we have the Legislators to thank

403
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,398
for this American renaissance!

404
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:21,376
So, will you please join me
in giving them a real hometown welcome

405
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,380
that truly shows our appreciation

406
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:28,464
for nine years of peace and prosperity!

407
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,739
Mary Johnson, 8:39 p.m.

408
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:56,991
Window down, sir.

409
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,167
Enjoy the show tonight, sir.

410
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,474
I'm inside.

411
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,558
E section.

412
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:05,018
Ladies and gentlemen,
the United State of America.

413
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:20,329
What a performance,
ladies and gentlemen.

414
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:24,162
A colorful reenactment of nine years ago.

415
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,378
They're running this thing like clockwork.
We got to give it to 'em.

416
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,762
He's leaving the VIP section now.

417
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,196
What a privilege it is...

418
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,485
Can you see him?

419
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,117
I see him.
He's on the field. We're in position.

420
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:30,937
He's not coming to E.

421
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,193
He's going the other way,
towards the tunnel behind you.

422
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,273
Got it.

423
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:42,908
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise to greet our Legislature.

424
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,010
<i>Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the light</i>

425
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,346
<i>Neither army nor a bullet fired</i>

426
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,389
<i>Did stop them at first sight</i>

427
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,094
<i>They have gifted us with harmony</i>

428
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,846
<i>And sweetest sleep at night</i>

429
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:11,982
<i>Their truth is marching on</i>

430
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,859
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

431
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,323
<i>Glory, glory</i>

432
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:23,122
<i>Hallelujah</i>

433
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:27,577
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

434
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,082
<i>Their truth is...</i>

435
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,162
He's coming right at you.

436
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,874
<i>...is marching on</i>

437
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:40,882
<i>...fore the dawn,
now we're alone no more</i>

438
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:44,014
<i>On a wing away,
the night takes flight</i>

439
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,311
<i>The sun has won the war</i>

440
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:51,484
<i>Their light will carry on</i>

441
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,023
<i>Glory, glory</i>

442
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,981
<i>Hallelujah</i>

443
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:02,070
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

444
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:03,370
<i>Glory, glory...</i>

445
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,743
Robert Watts?

446
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:09,243
It's Ben. Ben Simon. Drexel Drive.

447
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,752
Keep it moving.

448
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:12,375
Sorry about it. Sorry about it.

449
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:13,914
Hands off of me.

450
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,799
Allow me time to translate.

451
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,385
Breathe between sentences.

452
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,102
<i>And answer to their call</i>

453
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:31,524
<i>This peace we carry on</i>

454
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,320
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah...</i>

455
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,110
We need to allow them
to communicate first.

456
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,488
<i>Hallelujah</i>

457
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,867
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

458
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:53,957
<i>Their truth is marching on</i>

459
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,311
This is Zero-4 citywide dispatch.
Heavy smoke.

460
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,853
We got half in zone security unit...

461
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,182
unaccounted for, possible Legislator.

462
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:34,893
Come on.

463
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,981
Don't move!

464
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,112
Get in the car! Get in!

465
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,285
Keep them out there!

466
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,783
Keep that crowd back!
You are hereby ordered...

467
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:51,074
Come on! We got to go!

468
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,210
Oh, no.

469
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,420
Oh, fuck.

470
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,869
You and me go together.

471
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,271
We got till 7:00 a.m.

472
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:50,792
What people need to understand
is this is a war.

473
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,248
Between order and chaos.

474
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,843
Between democracy and anarchy.

475
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,800
Commissioner Igoe,
is the insurgency reorganizing?

476
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,433
Insurgency. No one's mentioned
that word since Wicker Park.

477
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,890
There are rumors
that hunters are being brought in.

478
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,393
Measures are being taken,
but to preserve their effectiveness,

479
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,974
I'm not gonna discuss them.

480
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:14,027
And we will keep you updated
as the situation evolves.

481
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,569
- No, a question over here.
- Thank you.

482
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,703
Commander.
Commissioner Igoe is ready for you.

483
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,754
They're bringing in hunters this time
from off planet.

484
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,956
- They can't do that.
- The one ID we have,

485
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,964
the ex-priest from Saint Anthony's,
points to Pilsen.

486
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,260
You know what that means.

487
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,929
We can clean this up ourselves.

488
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,676
Yeah, nobody's talking about a cleanup.

489
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,804
Pilsen isn't Wicker Park, Commissioner.

490
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,884
Yeah, not yet.

491
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,561
They torch this neighborhood,

492
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,059
the network will go to ground
just like they did last time.

493
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:54,017
You know, you're too sentimental, Bill.
Pilsen's a goddamn armpit.

494
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,602
Only good for whoring.

495
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,022
Their leadership is in Pilsen.

496
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,324
- You know that for a fact?
- I'm working on it.

497
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,572
Not fast enough.

498
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:07,406
If we do our job, we can locate
the end of the thread, their Number One,

499
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,161
and unravel the whole network.

500
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,834
Look, let me stop you right there.

501
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:12,957
Hey, that ship has sailed.

502
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,165
And I have to explain why
to them in there.

503
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:21,504
I got a positive ID at Soldier Field,
the man I've been tracking for two years.

504
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,134
I need time to bring him in alive.

505
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,680
You're not listening.

506
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,934
Right now, we have resources behind us.

507
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:31,642
Now, you might not see them,
but they're there. They're protecting you.

508
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:36,356
And the more irrational you become,
the more unnecessary noise you make,

509
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:39,234
the harder it's gonna be
to invite you into the lifeboat.

510
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:40,314
Do you understand me?

511
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,367
If there's any chance
of getting off this dying rock,

512
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,660
I'm not gonna waste it.

513
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,201
Pilsen is already dead.

514
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,167
They just don't know it yet.

515
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,839
They hate the way we smell.

516
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,883
How about that?

517
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:16,896
Sorry I got to leave you here, Bill.
Can't take anybody with me.

518
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,648
If you only knew
what was inside this place.

519
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,942
The commissioner's privilege, sir.

520
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,398
You know it.

521
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:28,863
And don't get hung up on this, Bill.
Play ball.

522
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:32,866
And keep your hands clean.
Let the hunters do the dirty work.

523
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:37,796
And I'll tell our friends down below
they got our full operational support.

524
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:42,171
Now, go home, relax,
take the night off for once, huh?

525
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,712
All the second-stage tanks
now pressurized.

526
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,468
Thirty-five seconds and counting.

527
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,220
We are still go.
Thirty seconds and counting.

528
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,640
Feels good. T-minus 25 now.

529
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,972
Let's ride this one out, Bill.

530
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,603
Confirming rank and identity.

531
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,059
Commissioner Eugene Igoe.

532
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,895
Let them take the lead.
Just until it dies down.

533
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,571
Security clearance complete.

534
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,569
- Ten, nine...
- Prepare for descent.

535
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,321
Ignition sequence start.

536
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:12,907
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

537
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,419
I can't protect you now.

538
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:26,920
I know.

539
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,470
I have faith in you.

540
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:36,646
Why?

541
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,607
Why do you? Nobody else does.

542
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,272
We could go away together.

543
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:52,787
That's not our story.

544
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,120
Dance with me.

545
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,570
You have a job to do.

546
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,088
Move, move, move!
Let's go! Let's go!

547
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,511
Get back! Move back!

548
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,172
Dad, wake up!

549
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:57,644
You got to get moving now!
You got to move back! Hurry up!

550
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,062
Mom, wake up. Mom, wake up.
Specials are here!

551
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:06,561
Everyone, get on the ground now!
Get down! Get down!

552
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,198
Specials are here! Specials are here!
Specials are here! Wake up!

553
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:27,332
That's it. Enough of this shit!

554
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,506
Move, move, move!

555
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,678
Don't turn your head. Face the wall!

556
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:36,633
Specials! Specials are here!

557
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:40,553
Move now!

558
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,869
- Gabriel Drummond.
- Get your hands on the wall.

559
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,076
Do you know him? Have you seen him?

560
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,332
Rafael Drummond. Who knows him?

561
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:07,414
- Hands on the wall.
- Hey, look what we got here.

562
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,916
Hey, where'd you get all this money, huh?

563
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,048
What are you selling to get
all that money? Carry a weapon?

564
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,759
I asked you a question, punk.

565
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:21,015
Try that cowboy shit with me?
Let's see where that goes, huh?

566
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,516
Are you kidding me?

567
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,143
Who the cowboy now, huh?

568
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,770
What are you gonna do, Gabriel?

569
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:32,689
Shoot him?

570
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:34,608
Go ahead, shoot.

571
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,278
Kill the bastard.
You know it'll make you feel better.

572
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,997
Come on, get rid of some of that rage.

573
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:43,658
- Take them all in.
- Move, move, move!

574
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,958
In this neighborhood,
we shoot our own guys.

575
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:51,087
Target one man, Rafael Drummond,
moving on a fraudulent implant.

576
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,043
Hello?

577
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,841
I'm sorry I couldn't say it before.

578
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,386
I'm doing this for Charlie.

579
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,635
There's someone here
who wants to talk to you.

580
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:47,351
Hello, Evan.
Tell us where your friends are going.

581
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:57,570
This is a security message.
If you see something, say something.

582
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,617
Ladies and gentlemen,

583
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:03,572
last call for boarding for buses heading
to New York City and Montreal,

584
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,248
departure set for 7:00.

585
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:24,350
All units, stand down.
Requisite hunter units traveling.

586
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,938
I don't want to go in.

587
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,186
Last call for boarding

588
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,267
for buses heading to New York City
and Montreal.

589
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,943
Just push the door and come through.

590
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:35,437
I don't want to go in.

591
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,068
You're making us late, Charlie.
Would you just push the door.

592
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,820
Fine.

593
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,538
Thank you. Thank you very much.

594
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,530
On the ground now!

595
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,574
Hands behind your head!

596
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:41,104
Sit down! Sit down!

597
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,416
Hey!

598
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:45,084
Hey!

599
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,297
You! Get down now! I said down!

600
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:58,188
It's not over.

601
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,182
Somebody kill me!

602
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:00,288
I want a lawyer.

603
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:02,874
In another ten...

604
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:06,916
nine and a half hours,
there'll be nothing left of Pilsen.

605
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:08,217
I said I want a lawyer.

606
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,421
You and I both know those days are gone.

607
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:15,091
I didn't need a warrant
when I burned your boat.

608
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,519
You work for me now, Gabriel.

609
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,638
I told you...

610
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:22,765
I'm not one of your narcs.

611
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,362
I'm not gonna do shit for you.

612
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,690
I'm not asking you to do anything for me.

613
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:33,401
I'm not even asking you
to do anything for your community.

614
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,113
Even though plenty of people
are going to die.

615
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,122
Like your father,
you're more of a family guy.

616
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:44,203
Blood first.

617
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,089
When's the last time you saw your brother?

618
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,466
I'm not gonna tell you shit.

619
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,394
So you can do
whatever you want to do to me.

620
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:46,770
You got a visitor.

621
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:50,611
Family day.

622
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,609
You want to say something?

623
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,485
Go ahead. He can hear you.

624
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,455
Baby brother, why...

625
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:05,167
Why didn't you listen?

626
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,586
What you doing here, man?

627
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,459
No.

628
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:18,014
No! No! Gabe! Hey, don't!

629
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:22,226
Don't let 'em use you!
You hear me? You hear me?

630
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:25,271
Man, I told you not...
I told you not to be a hero, Rafe.

631
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,644
- Don't do it!
- I told you not to be the hero!

632
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,441
Look, don't do it, Gabe.

633
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,653
I told you, I'm already dead, man.

634
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:34,150
Do it, and I'll make sure he lives.

635
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,190
You expect me to trust you?

636
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,702
Gabe, you there? Gabe?

637
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:43,990
Fuck!

638
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,375
Listen to me carefully, Gabriel.

639
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:59,806
Right now, the Legislators
are preparing to level Pilsen

640
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,348
for what your brother's done.

641
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,931
Same way they leveled Wicker Park.

642
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,896
Our roundups are over.

643
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,858
You are our one way into the network.

644
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,272
I need you to deliver a message
from the Phoenix.

645
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:19,909
You will not ask questions.

646
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,659
Do exactly what I say,
and your brother will live.

647
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,033
Understand?

648
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:44,224
When you wanted to deliver
something before, where did you go?

649
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:50,932
Give them this.

650
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,343
Is that Gabe?

651
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,465
What are you doing here?

652
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,218
I got a message
from the Phoenix.

653
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:27,309
He's inside the van.

654
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:51,708
Come on, man, move, move!

655
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:01,669
The door's open.

656
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,716
Show him what you showed me.

657
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,270
Don't, don't, don't. Don't.

658
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:17,188
I'm Rafe's brother.

659
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:20,896
Put it down.

660
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,109
Put it down.

661
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,286
There's no Rafe here.

662
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:32,870
What do you want?

663
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:43,760
How'd you know about this?

664
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,214
Make the call.

665
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,434
Subject moving west.

666
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,814
- Now, boss?
- Not yet.

667
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:05,862
You should've left already.

668
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,323
No, our orders are to stay until the end.

669
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,864
I think this is the end.

670
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,540
They got him at the bus station.

671
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:14,617
What if we got it wrong?

672
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,213
He's asking to be taken to Number One.

673
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,131
Says he knows a way into the Closed Zone.

674
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:35,805
Gabriel?

675
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:38,565
You know him?

676
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,400
He was a student of mine.

677
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,401
So, what do we do now?

678
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:47,699
Deliver the message
to Number One.

679
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:51,987
Subject moving north.

680
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,550
Subject traveling.

681
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,307
All units, remain out of sight.

682
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:34,034
It's the Pilsen brothel.

683
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,076
Follow her upstairs.

684
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,399
Now we go.

685
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:09,982
- All right!
- Move, move, move!

686
01:28:58,667 --> 01:28:59,748
Hello, Gabriel.

687
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:03,831
How...

688
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:05,332
How do you know my name?

689
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:08,752
Now.

690
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,460
- Down! Come on! Don't move!
- Gun!

691
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,441
Stand down until I arrive.

692
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:55,925
You know this place?

693
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:58,007
No.

694
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,235
Hooker is a history buff.

695
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,710
Clip's empty. I don't get it.

696
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:44,803
Only picture on the wall.

697
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:04,239
This us?

698
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,119
It's her own setup.

699
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:21,233
Communication line
to the Closed Zone is now open.

700
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,795
Name, rank, department.

701
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:35,464
Mulligan, William.

702
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,793
Commander. Pilsen Special Branch.

703
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:44,715
Let's begin the debrief. Proceed.

704
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:49,599
The computer we found contained
all names, aliases and locations

705
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,225
of the Chicago network.

706
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:55,643
This communication sent
some years before restrictions.

707
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:58,980
Proof of a national network.

708
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:05,364
The computer belonged to the prostitute?

709
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:06,445
Number One.

710
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,164
She recorded her interactions
with her johns

711
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:12,663
and sent relevant information out
through the network's chain.

712
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:17,630
Her second in command
was Charles Rittenhouse, communications,

713
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:21,756
responsible for activating the operation
known as Phoenix.

714
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,173
Go. Get in.

715
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,598
Number three,
Patrick Ellison, operations.

716
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:28,550
- Before demobilization...
- Wait here.

717
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:30,886
Marine Corps, ordnance.

718
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:34,431
Wait, wait. No. I'm staying with you.
I'm staying with you!

719
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:42,110
Number four, Raul Casillas,
materials and transport.

720
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,988
Foreman at the Pilsen Auto Yards.

721
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,828
Systems analyst Ivan Leviev

722
01:33:48,915 --> 01:33:50,906
hacked into our central
surveillance database

723
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,460
and tracked Deputy Mayor Robert Watts,
the unwitting courier of the bomb.

724
01:33:57,298 --> 01:34:01,041
Harrison Ma, a medical student
before the closures,

725
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:04,470
developed a procedure
to remove identity implants,

726
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:08,049
enabling the cell to remain invisible
to tracker drones.

727
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:12,595
These were the principals
hiding in plain sight

728
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:15,898
who enabled the cell
to carry out the attack on Soldier Field.

729
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,646
The search for militant suspects
has accelerated.

730
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:23,314
An unidentified female resident
is reported to have been shot and killed.

731
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:25,274
But once we had
their Number One,

732
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:27,279
they knew we had them too.

733
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:10,994
The Chicago network...

734
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:13,868
is neutralized.

735
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:28,257
What was her name and background?

736
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:32,641
Her name was Priscilla Scott.

737
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:36,679
She was a history teacher
at Pilsen Elementary.

738
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:41,691
She was off the grid for nine years,
so there's nothing else we know about her.

739
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:49,650
A prostitute. Why?

740
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:50,734
Access.

741
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:56,407
She groomed her clients very carefully,
procured members of the Unity government,

742
01:35:56,501 --> 01:36:00,119
and manipulated them
into divulging classified information,

743
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:04,207
which she recorded
with her concealed wire.

744
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,250
Play the tape, please.

745
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,295
Can you imagine what they do down there?

746
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:13,006
Stripping everything.

747
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,513
Every crevasse.
Fracking to the power of ten.

748
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,889
Taking it all off planet.

749
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:18,933
You felt those earthquakes.

750
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:21,598
They'll crawl. They stand.

751
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:22,975
It's all the same to them.

752
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,485
They have this network
of tunnels under the surface...

753
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,858
Wait.
You've been inside the Closed Zone?

754
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:30,316
No, not me. The commissioner.

755
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,525
He's the guy with the access.

756
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:36,829
Well, then we better
get business out of the way.

757
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:41,125
Yeah, it's a big deal.

758
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:44,045
How often do they come out
of the Closed Zone?

759
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,292
Robert Watts,
he's just this alderman's bagman,

760
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,627
but he'll be handling them
out at the rally.

761
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:52,338
Greeting them, taking them in.

762
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,676
That's an incredible responsibility.

763
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:58,761
What if I told you that
the roach governor may be one of them?

764
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:02,188
Stop the tape, please.

765
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:04,520
Eugene.

766
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,400
Our own chain of command was compromised.

767
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,281
What about you?

768
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:21,992
What about me?

769
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:28,172
You live in this neighborhood.

770
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,334
Yes.

771
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,012
These are your people.

772
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,279
Evidence will be analyzed
by the Legislature.

773
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,281
In the meantime, as acting commissioner,

774
01:37:57,372 --> 01:38:00,114
you are to report to the Closed Zone
for further orders.

775
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:01,198
No more questions.

776
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:15,341
Loading up!

777
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,818
Lines in a single file.

778
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:40,672
Rafe's alive.

779
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:41,847
Yeah, so what?

780
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,051
I don't mean nothing to him anymore.

781
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:47,228
- You had a purpose.
- There was no purpose.

782
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:49,021
Rafe's plan failed.

783
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:54,443
What if the plan was to fail?

784
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:06,740
Like I said, you work for me now.

785
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:14,872
And what do you want me to do with this?

786
01:40:16,469 --> 01:40:18,801
Did you pay attention
in history class, Gabriel?

787
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:25,801
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

788
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:29,721
Now, get out.

789
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:43,323
Commissioner Mulligan.
They made you the big man, Bill.

790
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:45,949
Look out for us
when you get down there, Commissioner.

791
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,010
Here we are.

792
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,938
Oh, Lord. Johnny, no.
Well, I'm all sweaty.

793
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:56,392
- Come on, baby, you look beautiful.
- No...

794
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:03,397
- Priss, Charles!
- Hi!

795
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,608
Words of advice
from a history teacher

796
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:07,193
to the future generation?

797
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:10,576
Hi, baby Gabriel.
I can't wait to cuddle you.

798
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,623
That's not advice.

799
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:30,929
Bill, how about you?

800
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,808
I'm off duty, John.
You got a problem, call 911.

801
01:42:33,898 --> 01:42:35,434
Get up here. You know Priss.

802
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:37,356
She teaches at the school with my wife.

803
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:39,025
- Hi. How are you?
- Priss.

804
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:40,647
Bill, any advice?

805
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,524
Oh, yeah.

806
01:42:42,615 --> 01:42:45,528
Teacher or cop, kid?
You got to make a choice.

807
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:47,404
Whatever you are, be a good one.

808
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:57,915
You got
a hell of a family here, kid.

809
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:01,088

- And not just them. All of us.

810
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,212
Pilsen's got you covered.

811
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:04,959
The future is yours, kid.

812
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:09,198
Confirming rank and identity.

813
01:44:09,285 --> 01:44:10,696
Commissioner William Mulligan.

814
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:12,368
Security clearance complete.

815
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:13,903
Prepare for descent.

816
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:16,285
Fifteen seconds.
Guidance is internal.

817
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:20,543
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine...

818
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:22,996
Ignition sequence start.

819
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:28,210
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:29,294
Drop.

821
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:32,338
Light a match.

822
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:34,299
Ignite a war.

823
01:44:35,478 --> 01:44:38,721
Long as we fight back, we got a chance.
