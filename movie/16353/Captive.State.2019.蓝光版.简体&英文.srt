…确定这是什么的问题

如果这确实是恐怖主义行为 那么是谁造成的
If indeed this was an act of terrorism, then who caused it?

3
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,780
整个东海岸的所有电力都用光了
All of the electricity across the entire Eastern Seaboard is out.

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,250
我们仍在等待官方公告

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,800
但是国会被认为是无条件接受的

所有停战条款

-戒严…-这太花时间了

现在所有的美国军队都回到了他们的基地
Now all US military forces are returning to their bases

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,110
带着命令转身退后直到下一个命令…
with orders to turn in arms and stand down until further orders...

与外部新闻来源的联系是零星的
Contact with outside news sources has been sporadic

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,400
由于特伦顿电网的毁灭性故障

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,330
但目击者证实…

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,660
…大多数国际政府似乎都遵守…

警官 我要往北上去

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,250
你没有接到命令
You not get orders?

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,880
停车 停车
Stop the car. Stop the car.

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,600
把手从方向盘上拿开
Take your hands off the wheel.

25

Look, should we call the school? There may be a plan.

30
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,730
我不会翻身的 我们需要出去重新组合 然后反击
I'm not rolling over! We need to get out and regroup, then fight back.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,580
J.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240

我应该像你哥哥那样闯进来 把整堆蚂蚁都铲平
I should break in like your brother did and bulldoze that whole ant heap.

66

他们不能永远躲在那里 伙计

我们在做什么 这是个错误

这是什么时候开始成为你的个人工作空间的

在柳条公园之后 抵抗运动没有被消灭

论文…这些是纪念物

立法者把他们都抓起来了 你在找鬼 比尔
Legislators got 'em all. You're searching for ghosts, Bill.

如果我们现在不采取行动 我们将面临全面的叛乱
If we don't act now, we're facing a full-blown insurgency.

Harmony, peace, unity... it's all bullshit.

275
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,370

It's a lie, Gabe. They gonna take everything.

276
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,160

282
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,440
为什么你总是要成为英雄

你得选一边

298
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,310
会有麻烦的
There's gonna be some trouble.

299
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,780
加布里埃尔 这是什么意思

"Insurgency." No one's mentioned that word since Wicker Park.

455
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,950

467
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,810
皮尔森不是威克公园 局长

469
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,570
他们在这附近放火
They torch this neighborhood,

470
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,070
网络会像上次一样接地

速度不够快

If we do our job, we can locate the end of the thread, their Number One,

477
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,170
解开整个网络

478
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,840
听着 让我在那儿拦住你

嘿 那艘船已经开航了

我必须向他们解释为什么在那里
And I have to explain why to them in there.

我在士兵场找到了一个身份证 那是我追踪了两年的人
I got a positive ID at Soldier Field, the man I've been tracking for two years.

你没在听
You're not listening.

484
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,940
现在 我们有了资源
Right now, we have resources behind us.

485
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:31,650
现在 你可能看不到他们 但他们在那里 他们在保护你
Now, you might not see them, but they're there. They're protecting you.

486
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:36,360
你变得越不理智 发出的噪音就越不必要
And the more irrational you become, the more unnecessary noise you make,

487
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,240
邀请你上救生艇就越难了
the harder it's gonna be to invite you into the lifeboat.

488
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,320
你明白我的意思吗

491
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,210
皮尔森已经死了
Pilsen is already dead.

492
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,170
他们只是还不知道
They just don't know it yet.

493
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,850
他们讨厌我们的气味

对不起 我得把你留在这里 比尔 不能带任何人和我在一起
Sorry I got to leave you here, Bill. Can't take anybody with me.

496

如果你只知道这里面是什么
